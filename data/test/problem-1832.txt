There are questions asked, clarification on the potions and some probing to find out his identity, but for the most part, Professor Snape’s testimony was clear enough that they’re unnecessary.
“You spoke to them?” Lord Nott sounds shocked.
Okay, sorry this one took so long to get out. I've been having a little bit of writer's block. Not in terms of plot--no, I have plenty of ideas and plans. But, like, words??? on paper??? whaaaat? So, yeah. I'm doing what I can. To try and combat this, I've started another fic that I'll begin posting once this series is done. It's Harry, but raised by goblins. Idk. It seems interesting. So there's that. This one, though, will not fall to the wayside. I promise <3
“Good. I got one I’d like, too. We’ll trade and read them,” Draco smiles sweetly, “Mother gave me the idea. She said we’d learn a lot about each other that way.”
“Wait…” Hari tilts his head. “That blood-purity guy was really extreme on his views.”
Draco’s pupils flare and his gaze somehow becomes even more intense, even as he smiles, pleased with Hari’s answer, “I’m glad. I wanted to dance with you, too. You needed the time with Daphne, though.” Little does Hari know, Daphne had confirmed that Hari is interested in Draco after their first conversation, but that he had reservations about the relationship.
“Of course,” Daphne nods. “Let’s go get some.”
“It’s alright,” Hari assures her, “it’s better to know reality than have passed a class.”
“Right?” Blaise is practically bouncing in his seat.
It's been a while.
“Aw, don’t throw him out, Professor Snape,” someone whines, “it’s only a theory day.”
“Thanks, by the way, Daphne,” Hari peeks out at her, “for giving me that push.”
“Snake pit,” Hari mutters, turning to take in their surroundings. The area is grand and practically the opposite of Potter Manor. The marble is black and polished until practically a mirror. The furniture is a pale wood and the detailing is in silver. The carpet and accents are in a rich, emerald green. Hari walks slowly into the house.
“You, as well,” Hari smiles. “This is my guest, Miss Hermione Granger. Heir Longbottom, I believe you two are in the same Hogwarts House?” He’s careful not to say ‘in the same House’, as that could be taken wrong by any casual observer.
“Just the two of you? What will come of Miss Granger and Heirs Greengrass, Parkinson, and Zabini?”
“I did,” Hari points to the order form, “I went with basic ones that I’d be able to wear for a variety of occasions.”
“The keystone is in there,” Draco points out when Hari starts to grab the vase of powder off the mantle. Hari scoops it out, takes a pinch of powder, and tosses it in. The fireplace expands to be large enough to fit them and Hari steps in after tossing in a handful. He’d learned from Narcissa that the best way to ensure you don’t mess up your pronunciation by sneezing is to throw the powder before stepping in.
“Not to mention WizCul,” a Ravenclaw adds. “I think that’s the best part.”
“Looking at the book list,” Daphne hums, “I kind of am interested in every elective except Care.”
After a quick visit with Galeru, who is happier than ever in his habitat away from the kneazles and crups, they go inside and sit in the formal dining room for lunch.
“Would Master Hari like Critter to give him a tour?”
“My apologies, but I don’t feel comfortable speculating,” Hari apologizes, “They’ve clearly kept the victim’s name a secret for a reason.”
“Well, it’s just, I’m the owner,” Hari nods at that, “and I was disturbed by the idea that you didn’t know these books were being sold.”
“I will look into it,” Professor Snape promises, seeing that this is something Hari will not bear.
Someone starts to laugh, “well, we’ve been calling him Handsome, anyway!” Laughter rings through the common room and, though he understands them clearly, Hari lets out a plaintive mewl, sounding upset at the mocking of his name. Coos echo around him, promises that they didn’t mean anything by it.
“That’s not to say they won’t try to figure you out,” Draco warns, pointing his fork at Hari over lunch.
“Start the train again,” Remus tells the wizard.
“The third,” Hari looks at her curiously. “They’re always on the third, seventh, fifteenth, twenty-first, twenty-eighth, and thirty-first.” She should have known that. She winks at him and tilts her head slightly to indicate someone behind Hari. Hari waits a long moment, then peeks quickly. It’s the Longbottom Heir looking utterly confused by everything, as usual.
“Good luck,” Draco whispers in Hari’s ear.
“Right, get them both to think they’re sneaking off to give the other couple ‘alone time’, but there’s more to this—there always is with you.”
The reaction is instantaneous. She spins on the spot several times then darts off to explore the shelves.
“We are, Lord Potter,” Neville replies. “It’s good to see you again, Miss Granger.”
“I—of course not. I simply mean that he is not yet of age.” Hari makes brief eye contact with Lucius and rises. He needs to defend himself.
Hari glances around the room. He’s rather surprised to find that most of the eyes on him are filled with respect, rather than distrust. A few look apathetic, but Hari takes that as boredom over anything else.
Hari giggles and nods excitedly, “Yes! Draco and I are going together. I can’t wait!”
“I almost grabbed the earrings,” Draco admits, “but then remembered you don’t have your ears pierced. So I snagged this instead.”
Blaise practically wails, whining about how she’d betrayed him and why she couldn’t just let him have that one moment. Daphne smirks at him and watches him rage at her with an amused gleam in her eye.
“Sirius can transfigure our clothes for us,” Pansy suggests. Draco doesn’t look pleased at the idea of altering his clothes, but accepts this as the best option.
“It may also be beneficial to pair up students scion to peer,” Lord Nott muses, “if only to assist them in understanding each other’s ways.”
“I’m positive,” Daphne promises, “Now, as for liking boys, it is an entirely muggle mindset to disapprove of it. Love is love and it isn’t like we don’t have magic to see to reproduction.”
“I haven’t gone as sophisticated me or nerdy me, yet,” Hari says. “But yes, the other two, I have. I don’t want to play all my cards yet. I don’t want them to know all the versions I can become.”
“Did I say that?” Daphne snaps and Hari flinches.
“There are,” Draco nods, “but House families tend to go with private tutoring to ensure their children are getting the education they want. And the schools don’t teach magical theory, government, or etiquette. So we’d still have to do studying at home.”
“Okay, because Luna has this really interesting way of seeing the world and I just thought it hit a little too close to the truth,” Hari says quickly.
“Hey, cub,” Remus snatches him into a hug, “are you all alright?”
Hari thinks for a few turns before answering, “it’s you.” He knows he’s blushing, but can’t offer a better answer than that. Draco searches his face intently and Hari struggles not to look away from the piercing gaze.
“There is,” Hari assures her. “Didn’t you get the schedule?”
“You’re sure?” Hari asks uncertainly.
“Good to meet you both,” Hari says, “and thank you for responding so quickly.”
“I have to wonder where you got your information, Miss Umbridge,” Lord Crabbe asks.
“Thank you, Critter,” Hari smiles at him, “why don’t you see about designing a suite for her. She loves books and studying,” Hari says, “so maybe she’d prefer an extra family suite?”
“I want to buy ‘Mione an owl,” he whispers, “so we need to hang back and make sure we’re the last in line for the floo.”
“Eat!” Blaise orders, “and we will gossip about what the heck happened in there. That was so beautiful!”
“That would be great, thank you, Critter,” Hari smiles at the elf.
“Brilliant,” Pansy grins.
“So?” Pansy whispers, “how’d it go?” Food appears in front of them and they load up their plates.
“Ah, yeah,” Hari turns pink, “I may have done that intentionally.”
Eight inches isn’t bad. Hermione points out rather frequently that it’s the size of one sheet of muggle paper and that muggles don’t handwrite essays, they type them, so the writing is much smaller. Hari’s own handwriting is somewhat large still, since Narcissa had chosen a long-letter style for him. It looks interesting, though, and is clearly legible. After Draco had finished reading, it only takes them ten minutes to all put their quills down.
“We elveses can be doing that,” the spokeself nods, “and we can be coming if a student is needing us.”
“I don’t know…” Hermione twists her fingers.
“I’m really liking how short these essays are, now,” Daphne sighs, stretching.
“Any objections to Grimmauld Place?” Hari offers. No one objects, so he holds out his hand and they all place a finger on his ring. “
A chime goes off—time for ninth hour. Draco scoops up his bag and heads out for Arithmancy. A bunch of others leave, too, so Hari scurries along beside them and weaves through their legs. If nothing else, Professor Snape will let him sit on his desk during seventh year potions and watch.
“Ugh,” Daphne groans and flops onto Blaise’s shoulder, “tell me about it. I was stuck with pigtails and schoolgirl braids until I learned to do the charm for myself on my great-great-grandmother’s wand.”
“Yes,” Hari nods, “I would think that it would be possible for her to teach both first and seventh years during the year this year, then take the month of July for fifth and sixth, and August for my year and the year above. She would then do one more year of first and third years and implement the government class after two years, instead of three.”
Let me know your thoughts!
“Are you ready?”
“Hey, there,” she sits next to him and he lays with is head in her lap, “I wanted to talk to you about something.” Ajay rolls so his eyes are looking straight at her. “I… I’m not certain, but I think I like Blaise and I don’t know what to do about it.”
“Busy morning?” Blaise asks in a low murmur as Hari passes him.
This chapter--it's interesting. I don't know how else to explain it. I had some fun writing it and Draco is a character. So... yeah. Let me know your thoughts!
Hari groans and turns to Pansy, “any chance I could get one of those transcribing quills your mother uses?”
“Okay…” Hari trails off. That’s a little thin. He studies Draco, then groans internally. He’s been had. Draco’s plan wasn’t about how to get the others together the quickest, it was how to sneak off the quickest to get alone time with him.
“I am,” Hari confirms, eyeing him warily. Fudge may have been on his side last meeting, but the man is notorious for being… flighty.
“Spells,” Draco replies, “It was rumored Salazar Slytherin didn’t own house elves and had instead warded all his possessions against getting dirty.”
“Oh, Hermione, dear, you’re back,” Mrs. Granger peeks into the room from the kitchen.
“We went and spoke with the muggles, to inform them of our plan to keep Lord Potter from them. Cursebreaker Weasley had already set up the room Lord Potter would be staying in, but we needed to ensure the secret would not be revealed. When we arrived, we were immediately turned away, as the muggles would not abide ‘our kind’ at their door. We informed them that we intended to ensure they wouldn’t have to see Lord Potter for the summer and they leapt at the chance to hear our plan. They showed nothing but contempt and hatred of the then-eleven-year-old Lord Potter. They were only disappointed they would have to see him at all. They informed us that the amount of time he would be around them that summer was enough to be unbearable—they saw him only for the trips to and from King’s Cross Station, which totaled an hour. Since leaving their house at the age of eleven to attend Hogwarts, Lord Potter has spent a total of an hour and a half in their presence. If asked, I believe they would claim that to still be far too long.”
“She was talking about something called nargles,” Hari adds, “she said they create bad thoughts, that they can be people or habits and patterns of thought. She said Professor Snape has an infestation.”
Merlin.
“I hope so,” Hari mutters, “she seems to believe everyone’s infested with nargles.”
“Of course, of course,” Minister Fudge grins, but it doesn’t meet his eyes. Thankfully, Hari is saved by the bell—literally.
“I know,” her voice is peaceful, “I chose to wait for you, Hari Potter.” She smiles at him and it’s unnerving how calm she looks.
“Hari!” Draco calls, poking his head out of one of the rooms, “you’re done with the meeting! What took you so long?”
“Nope, not just you,” Hari groans, “the whole thing was pointless either way. Your father confirmed that, too.”
“They knew you would stop rather than hit them,” Remus tells him, “so they blocked the tracks. Next time, just keep going.”
“Hey! My buddy’s the best!” In moments, there’s laughing arguments and buddies clinging to each other, despite the year only being a month and a half in. They’ve only had their buddies for a month. Hari lets out a little trilling noise, pleased with the development.
“I was just pointing it out!” Pansy holds her hands up.
“Would someone like to tell me why I need formal robes?”
“Thank you, Critter, for making this for me.”
He keeps his eyes straight ahead. This allows Hari to watch the moment Dumbledore sees him. The man’s face goes red from rage under his beard, pinching hilariously. There’s shock and awe written there, too. Pride swells in Hari. He’s made it.
“Why did you marry her?” Draco’s voice has lost some of its edge now, the hurt clear behind his words.
Hermione had told Harry he should be there for Malfoy and he is. Visiting him every afternoon after class. But he feels uncomfortable about it, like he’s selfishly stealing Malfoy’s time. Malfoy tells him he wants him there but Merlin, is it really Malfoy? Does he really know what he wants?
“My wand, Potter,” Draco says through gritted teeth, not looking directly into Harry’s eyes, instead somewhere near the centre of his nose.
“And what were they looking for?”
“I’m sorry, Draco.”
“Harry, my boy, would you mind?”
“Excellent,” Pansy interrupted. She turned to Harry. “Potter, you should go with him.”
“Oh, but it does,” Malfoy disagreed. He smiled brightly as if an idea had just come to him. “Oh, wouldn’t that be sporting?”
And then Potter mouthed a word at Draco that took a second to interpret.
“Oh, mate,” Ron said. “You are so fucked.”
“The werewolf, you mean?” Travers asks.
Malfoy turns and stares past Harry to the door. “Although I was hoping you would.”
Harry takes a breath. Surely the boy who lived (and died!) can handle Blaise Zabini. “Hi,” he begins, discreetly rubbing his sweaty palms on his trousers. “Is Malfoy okay?”
“I asked you to trust me,” Malfoy says which really should be an accusation, and considering Harry’s behaviour, it would be justified, but there’s no malice to Malfoy’s tone.
Now, you’re just talking nonsense. I don’t know why I expected anything else from you. My mistake.
Draco blinked. Sit at Potter’s couch? With Granger and Weasley? Surely that’s not what he meant.
“None.” Potter raised his eyebrows - he was trying to get a rise out of Draco, Draco knew it.
“Look Malfoy, you know I don’t want this to be true–”
“If only what?”
He leaned in and kissed Harry exactly as he knew his boyfriend liked it, hands gliding up Harry’s neck to rest in his hair, lips moving effortlessly.
Harry still hadn’t quite worked out that something but it was beginning to play on his mind more and more.
The dinner was a ride off. At least, in terms of spending time with Draco. Harry spent the entire time entertaining Teddy while listening to Draco gossip with his friends in the next room. Despite Draco telling him so quite plainly, he didn’t realise he’d been invited to play nanny. He had thought - or hoped - Draco was playing their game of saying things they didn’t really mean. But clearly not.
me. Whatever has happened to him, you said it yourself, it’s made him
“When are you going to learn needing people isn’t a weakness, Draco?”
“So, neither you nor your husband have ever been to Malfoy Manor?” Hermione asks.
There was too much at stake to give a single thought to celebrating his birthday.
to see.
Blaise! Are you two - “
He leaves Anne with all the muggle money he has on him which must be a lot because her eyes get watery and Draco has to take a step backwards to avoid a hug. She must think he’s being generous towards her because he’s a good person. But he’s not. He has used her patronage at dinner for selfish reasons and all the muggle money she holds is the product of guilt and guilt alone. Nothing pure about it. Draco hates that she thinks otherwise.
“It means,” Draco tightens his arms around Hari, “that the Ministry can only enter Hogwarts on the Headmaster’s say-so. So even to arrest someone, they’d have to get permission or wait for the person to leave the wards.”
“No, I won’t,” Hari smirks at Draco, “you’re forgetting my rings. They’ll take me directly there.”
“Okay, but how similar?”
“I’m sure,” Daphne placates, glaring at Blaise, “and I’m sure you’re giving Hermione that design because of how she named the owl?”
“If you’ll excuse me,” Hari slips into the chambers and down to his seat. Within a minute, Minister Fudge is at the podium calling for the doors to be sealed.
“That’s right,” Blaise confirms, “it’s pretty neat you remember that despite only hearing it once.”
“Well, first, you are,” Hari gives him a pointed look, “but I see your point. And they’re spectacular friends. Who all maybe have a crush on someone else in that group. So they’re all okay sticking together as ‘just friends’.” Hari winks and Professor Snape chuckles.
Hari smirks, “I couldn’t.” His voice has much more bravado than he’s actually feeling.
“Oh, yes, I’ll get Manja!”
“Draco,” Daphne chides, “they’re doing better than some people in our year.”
“I imagine they’re looking for Pettigrew,” Pansy says.
“Everyone ready?” Blaise asks. When he gets a sea of nods, he tells them to pass. The essays slide two people over to be edited for spelling and grammar and blatant, obvious errors. Although, with the way they work, errors don’t happen too often. In five minutes, the parchments are being passed back, corrected and neat.
Hermione returns her hand to the crook of Hari’s arm and allows herself to be guided in. When they enter, guests are already mingling. Scanning the crowd, Hari finds Lady Longbottom and her Heir.
Dumbledore’s voice is shaking as he says, “All those in favor of granting the Goblins’ application.” There’s a pause, and his voice comes back stronger. “All those in favor of denying the Goblins’ application.” Another pause, this one longer. “The application has been denied.” His voice sounds cheerful and Master Tomeaxe nods to Hari.
“Sirius!” Hari yells and sprints for the stairs.
“Right,” Hermione agrees, “they know you’re the most likely candidate, but because of your age and status as a fellow student, you can’t possibly be Headmaster.”
“Now I am,” Draco nods at his reflection.
“Yeah,” a Slytherin agrees slowly, “but I don’t think they’re bad. There’s those new electives—I’m in Healing and it’s going to give me a leg up when I get my apprenticeship. And the Heirs and Lord Potter getting to use their Family Suites? They pay a lot of money for that and Dumbledore has barred access for ten years.”
“What are Dementors?” Hari asks, when they’re all trying to calm down, reassured that nothing can get into the compartment.
“Yeah,” Hermione smiles sheepishly, “I’ve been having fun with all the different hair-dos. It’s easier to try them out when you don’t have to spend hours laboring over them.”
“He probably wanted me to figure it out myself,” Draco winces. Hari chuckles and nudges their shoulders together reassuringly.
Hermione just laughs and puts the book back. “Hi, there, Uluka. I promise to be a good owner.” She carefully settles Uluka back in his cage and takes her seat.
“Fair warning,” Draco says, “if anyone sees you with him at school, they’ll get upset. Most families tell the elves not to follow a summons at Hogwarts.”
“Stay here. You were upset earlier about not having enough time with me, weren’t you?”
In a flash, Hari is sitting next to her.
Hari breathes in and takes his first step. His shoes click tellingly on the floor and if every eye hadn’t already been watching the doors, they would be now.
“It’s very interesting every time I learn more about you,” she nods seriously, “and your mind isn’t overtaken by the nargles, despite everything.”
The hippogriff’s head bobs.
And so Hari finds himself sitting and revealing everything that had happened that day to Draco.
“How did you know our names?” Draco asks, edging closer to Hari protectively. Hari braces himself and gets ready to transform.
Draco stops in the middle of the hall, walks over to one of the suits of armor and starts climbing it.
“Okay, spill, what happened?”
“Madam Malkin’s first?” Daphne asks. There’s agreements all around and they set off.
“Oh good,” Pansy sighs, “you found ‘Mia.”
They go into the dining room, where Narcissa and Lucius are waiting with a laden table.
“Let’s take that in order,” Lord Flint says. “Why fire Argus Filch?”
“Everyone’s going to be upset about
“Maybe not,” Hari allows, “but you’re good enough to pretty much keep up with me, so you could take my spot.”
“We need to go visit Granger,” Draco declares, “the Fall Festival Ball is usually a week before we leave for school, which gives us only about two weeks to get her ready for it.”
“So basically, it’s the argument of affordability versus aesthetic?”
“Don’t worry about it now,” Hari says, “you’ll get the book when your father visits for Halloween. Just write him a letter.”
“What charges?” Fudge laughs, “I’m just doing my job.”
!” Zabini says as if it is a dirty word.
, as you put it, in sending such filth through the mail?
Harry’s hands found their way – completely of their own accord – to Draco’s hips, holding onto the bare flesh tightly for support. His legs were firmly backed up against the bed, and with his upper body pushed back with the force of Draco’s kiss – not that he was complaining – Harry could feel himself starting to fall. He dug his fingers further into Draco’s hips but the only good it did was bring Draco down with him.
Potter leaned up to Draco’s ear - if he was going to make a habit of this, Draco was definitely in favour. “I don’t have quite so many buttons,” he whispered, “and I don’t mind magic.” He held out Draco’s wand which Draco hadn’t even realised Potter’d fished from his robes. He’d been a little…distracted.
Harry didn’t bother to reply to that. Polite small talk rarely required an actual answer. But there was something he needed from Draco. He really hated to ask, especially when Draco was playing this game. “Can you stay and look after Teddy for a bit? I’m going to be at this for a while.”
The room converged into a circle with Parkinson at the centre, some on the couches, some cross-legged on the floor. Malfoy hadn’t moved from his stool, but Zabini now sat between him and Greengrass. Harry tried not to be so pleased by that small detail.
The words sit in the air between them. Harry returns his gaze to the sky above them, unsure what to say. Of course, he had always figured Malfoy’s cockiness to be masking his insecurity in some form, but he didn’t expect
that easy. What’s the point of even locking doors in a wizarding school anyway?
Draco couldn’t make sense of it, which may have been in part to his residual lightheadedness. “What do you mean?”
Potter’s lips were everything. Soft and hard. Gentle and demanding. Bracing and warm. How had Draco gone this long without kissing Harry Potter? He should have realised from the way Potter’s lips felt on his neck and his cock, that they’d feel this wonderful on his own. And he certainly knew how talented Potter’s tongue could be if it were to make an appear -
“I’m afraid I can’t quite - “
“So, back with Zabini, huh?” Thankfully, his voice comes out stronger than he expected.
, in my head, so I kept as far away from him in the Manor as I could. I was being selfish again.” Draco shakes his head. “If I had stayed with him, then he wouldn’t have got away, he wouldn’t have tried to hurt you.”
Before Harry can even raise his wand in preparation, he is thrown backwards by a silence force. Instinctively he points his wand at Malfoy to disarm him, but Malfoy throws up a silent shield charm and then throws something else back Harry’s way. Harry dodges the spell’s path as he pulls himself up from the floor.
who lived, a second look.
The woman on stage – she had finally introduced her name as Hermione – was still talking, boring the crowd with the obligatory romanticizing of the year’s politics and all that the Mayor had done for his community, etcetera. It would have been more convincing had the Mayor bothered to attend the event he was hosting.
Harry jerked his head up. “No– I didn’t– that wasn’t– he said it was a meeting.”
Harry waits for the challenge. Waits for Malfoy to tell him he was going easy on him, waits for the declaration of another game in which Harry will surely lose.
“You’re an Auror, aren’t you? Can’t you work it out yourself?”
“You want me to keep visiting?” Harry asks, already ignoring the no questions rule. As curious as he finds the mystery of Malfoy’s condition, the thought that Malfoy might enjoy spending time with Harry is even more so.
, Malfoy.”
– flashed in front of his eyes over and over again. Maybe Malfoy was right – maybe the bed really was haunted.
“What do you mean?” Harry asks quickly, not yet understanding. The weight in his chest increases.
Draco leans up from the hospital bed, feeling stronger already. He’d like to be a romantic and say its thanks to Harry’s presence but that would do a disservice to the St Mungo’s staff who’ve been looking after him all day, to the nutrients they’ve ensured reach his stomach and refuel his body (although he’s still trying not to think too much on exactly what they put inside of him), and to the progress Draco’s made in simply accepting help from others. It’s not Harry’s presence at all. And maybe that’s more romantic. He doesn’t need Harry. But he wants him. By merlin, he wants him. So he cuts off Harry’s green apple rant – he’s now going on about Green Apple sorbet – with a soft kiss on the lips.
“Well? “ He asked, expectedly, without giving Harry any time to react. “Are you going to spoon me or not?”
Pansy cackled. “A threefold twin bond doesn’t exist, Draco. I just made it up.”
“Why’d you bring Ron and Hermione?” Draco countered.
Harry only glanced down at the bill as the waiter hurriedly moved to retrieve it, less the rich table who ordered lobster, caviar
But all too soon, Malfoy pulls away, straightens himself up and takes a step forward. Harry’s come-covered hand fall outs from where it’s been resting in Malfoy’s trousers and drops limply to his side.
“Do not lecture me, Potter when you clearly know very little about werewolves. Wolfsbane Potion needs to be taken every night for a week leading up to the full moon or it isn’t effective.
Now he just has to wait.
” Draco said, hating himself for the way his scathing tone took over. “Don’t leave your stuff on my side of the room next time.”
It seemed like Potter was having his own sulk if the sight of a bed canopy was anything to go by. Ronald had long left Potter, leaving an opening. Draco set off for their room, confident he could find his way through the castle by feel, but on his first staircase, he got turned around and became very very lost. Still, he continued, rationing he’d have to get to Potter eventually, even if it meant visiting every room in Hogwarts.
eye contact.
That was all it took for Draco’s own orgasm to start, the residual panting from Potter egging him on, Potter’s eyes challenging him, daring him to - and
Harry snorts. He’s used to insults from Malfoy but this one doesn’t sting as much. “Thanks.”
Since the first incident, Harry has begun to notice Draco more and more. He is only just starting to realise he’d spent the whole eighth year ignoring Draco. How could he have missed the way Draco took absences midway through every class? Was he really so wrapped up in himself?
Malfoy lifts his gaze. “Isn’t it obvious? What does an animal do when they’re in heat?”
“I see ‘The Chosen One’ still likes to throw his weight around.”
. “Fine.” He can’t make sense of what has just happened. Not his own reaction and certainly not Malfoy’s reaction. With his potion playing up, Harry just panicked. He can’t explain it more than that. Brewing potions used to calm him but now, he can barely wait for class to finish, so he never has to look at this one again.
Potter grimaced. “An unfortunate coincidence.”
flying and yet he’d only just picked up a broom at the start of the school year. How could Draco compete with that natural talent?
“Pyjamas, then? Silk ones I bet.”
enhancing potion.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “That didn’t
Now, Harry isn’t sure how he’s going to face Malfoy when they see each other in class. He’s become more and more obsessed with him and now that he’s seen his dick…Good lord. He’s in trouble. But unexpectedly it’s breakfast he needs to worry about.
“You should probably know I borrowed Ron’s wand,” Harry said in the casual way he always delivered earth-shattering news.
Draco hadn’t actually thought that far ahead. He’d imagined that because it was November third, Potter would just be amenable to… Well, he didn’t think he’d have to work for what he was after, is all. “I just called...to check up on you. It’s been a year since your visit to St Mungo’s and protocol requires me to…to make sure you’re…healthy?” Yeah,
“I have reason to believe you’re involved in a conspiracy against the Ministry of Magic,” Harry says, trying to maintain a professional tone. He’s not here to get into it with a childhood rival, however much Malfoy’s prickliness provokes him.
“You should sit down,” Potter says.
Malfoy smiles sweet and simple, and Harry can’t remember ever seeing someone so beautiful. He shakes the thought from his head. Despite whatever happened with the dittany the other night, their relationship is still professional.
He is sure his mother is happy to have him every day and practically force feed him as if he is a baby. And for this reason he is not currently on the best terms with her. So of course, Draco is forced to make other arrangements. Yesterday it was Zabini – unfortunately he was only in town for the weekend, the day before it was Goyle – who was an atrocious slob and certainly would not be invited again, tomorrow it will be Pansy – flooing from Portugal especially, and today it is Harry Potter.
Harry opens his eyes to find Malfoy staring openly at his crotch. Good god, he hopes it’s not obvious. “That’s not what I meant. Just – how do we fix this?”
They’re STILL bleeding? His chest constricts so tightly, Harry expects his ribs to break.
“He looks good,” Ron whispered in Harry’s ear.
And he’s all too happy to move on when Malfoy moves his hand up a little to fiddle with his waistband. Yeah, Harry is most certainly on board for that. Malfoy snaps it back a couple of times, teasing. Really teasing. And Harry’s tempted to reach out and pull them down himself. But he’s not sure if he can. He’s never touched Malfoy in the dreams before. He supposes he’s never spoken before until this time either.
Draco thought carefully. He didn’t want there to be any miscommunication about what Potter was suggesting. “You can pick me up at 6pm and we will apparate,
Shit. Draco was an idiot. He’d completely forgotten it was November third. He’d been thinking about the day all week. And all the day prior as well. But this morning, he’d gotten up and headed straight to his favourite coffee shop without thinking. He’d sat down at his usual spot by the door with his usual caramel macchiato (with extra foam), forgetting there was nothing usual about the day at all.
“Just the pitch? Or the players too?”
“What impressive detective skills you have, Potter,” Malfoy says, ignoring Hermione in favour of eyeing Harry as he leans back in his grand chair. “Now here’s a riddle for you, who’s responsible for the raid on the Dunbergs?”
With Teddy occupied, Harry should have been able to concentrate, but he hadn’t really anticipated how much Draco’s presence would affect him. He was sitting by the door casting colourful shapes for Teddy to catch . They were both giggling. Clearly a trait inherited from the Black family for both of them then.
At Draco’s belly button, Potter paused and looked up. “Couldn’t you just slip out of it now?”
“I’m sorry,” Harry apologises, surprised to see Malfoy’s eyes watering. “You really should go to St Mungo’s and–”
“It goes both ways, Potter,” Draco pointed out, very much annoyed. “You hate me, so what does it matter how I feel?”
Draco sat up, a familiar anxiety settling in his stomach. He’d been at college less than half an hour and, of course, he’d already made an enemy of his dormmate. “Well,” he said defensively, “what was I supposed to make out of
Harry jerks his head up and locks eyes with Malfoy. “Sorry I didn’t– I wasn’t–” he splutters.
“Why is he coming here?” Ron asked.
“They won’t– I mean they don’t– “
“Harry. Think for a moment. The full moon is only a week away.”
Malfoy smirks. “Too easy again, Potter.” He stacks his breakfast plate casually, as if he hasn’t just claimed to be dating Harry. “Have some self-control.”
Harry wants to curse but he has no choice but to remain silent. How could he be so stupid as to add asphodel root without knowing what it would do? He had read that it enhanced the properties of other ingredients and didn’t bother to look into it further. If he had, then Malfoy wouldn’t be in this situation.
Potter ducked his head back around the door immediately, smiling as soon as he saw Draco. “Malfoy! I can’t believe I didn’t see you there.”
Draco almost dropped the phone.“Excuse me?” Potter couldn’t just
Sure enough. Potter jumped straight into accusations: “What do you think you’re doing in here?” There was anger in his voice of course - Potter’s temper was a precarious thing - but glee too - clearly at the excitement of catching Draco out.
“Can you shut your arrogant assuming mouth for one minuscule second?”
Harry winces. He’s used to Malfoy’s harsh words riling him up but Zabini? His wrath is new. And cruel.
Harry stares at the question mark, utterly perplexed. Never in his five years of using the Marauder’s Map has he ever seen a question mark next to anyone’s name.
” Potter’s voice was breathless and needy and Draco loved it. He could tell any second now -
He knew it was coming, but Harry still groaned when Pansy Parkinson announced it was time for truth or dare. “What are we? Twelve?” He muttered to Ron.
New heat flooded Harry’s face. He’d made it without thinking – if he’d given any real thought to it, he would never have planned to present Malfoy a cupcake decorated with a green snake coiled around a small red heart. “It’s not– ” he tried to explain– “it doesn’t mean any– ”
fault Malfoy and his boyfriend, Zabini, seem to think it’s okay to snog and walk at the same time with their eyes closed. It’s
Potter was making Draco’s erection situation worse - if that was possible. But at least his words had drawn all the attention of the room now. No one seemed interested in witnessing Draco’s erection when they could hear about Harry Potter’s blowjobs. Typical.
“Theodore Nott,” Harry spits out, letting the wolf indulge in a soft growl.
“Do you not like it?” Potter asks, his eyes darting down to Draco’s untouched knife and fork.
“It’s not...I…Sorry…” Harry closes his eyes as the shame and guilt burn through his skin. “I vanished it.”
Without another word, Potter sits by Draco’s side and takes his hand, gently. How else? They both turn to the Doctor.
Somehow Potter had gotten it into his head that he could lead. He took Draco’s hand with one of his and placed the other on the arch of Draco’s back - which seemed far too low for any ballroom dance style. Then Potter starting waltzing.
“Kiss me again,” Malfoy said. “If you want.”
“My father already - ”
“That’s what Malfoy – “
Malfoy’s eyes close a moment and he lets out an angry sigh before replying. “It’s a duel, Potter. We’re
“That’s not true,” Harry counters automatically.
“So are you!”
Potter straightened his glasses, peering at Draco with new concentration. “That’s my jersey,” he repeated.
Harry tightened his grip on Draco’s hands and swivelled the both of them around so he had Draco pinned to the wall. He held their hands against the wall by Draco’s head and pushed his hips forward, so Draco could
“But you are about me?” Harry questioned, turning back to Malfoy.
“I accept your dare, Malfoy,” Harry said loudly, his voice more confident than he really felt. “Go on.”
“Oh great, so you accidentally ruined my first day as a Minister. That makes it so much better, Potter.”
“So was that a yes? Monday night?”
Draco woke up in darkness, his surroundings taking some time to make sense. He had fallen asleep. He wasn’t supposed to have fallen asleep. Shit. He went to get up - he had to check the time -  and only then did he notice the arms wrapped around him, weighing him down.
Harry swallows. “Okay,” he says pulling the stopper from the bottle. “I think this is going to hurt.”
Harry didn’t let himself read into that too much. He’d already decided Draco was not flirting. Just tipsy. He turned his back on drunk Draco quickly and headed down to the Manor’s Sitting Room, careful to keep his gaze fixed ahead. Why did Draco have to be a giddy drunk? He could hardly fight Draco like this. Perhaps it would be better just to leave now. Why, then, was he not heading for the door?
“I had The Daily Prophet write a redaction,” Harry blurted out, as if that would help. Although at least he managed to get the words right this time.
“I’m bedridden with a horrid case of splattergroit.” Pansy says, attempting to prove this by scrunching up her face unattractively.
Perhaps he wouldn’t be seeking revenge on whoever cursed Malfoy’s bed after all.
“You don’t like pineapple on pizza,” Harry returned.
Draco. Then they both start shaking uncontrollably, vibrating faster than Harry’s eyes will allow him to monitor. Draco’s grip on Malfoy’s releases, but seems to fall into one single arm. The vibrating continues, faster now, so that when Harry blinks, he misses it completely.
“Truth or dare?”
Unable to restrain himself anymore, one afternoon on their way to the library, Harry tries to excuse himself.
Draco had already decided there was no way he was choosing truth. That no matter how awful a dare, there could be nothing more awful than being forced to reveal the truth of his feelings. Because that was the only question anyone ever asked in these stupid games. And Draco wasn’t a fool.
Harry leaps over the spreading solutions to join Malfoy at the entrance. He watches as Malfoy’s wand twirls between deft fingers, vanishing charm under way. Malfoy’s sharp features tighten, all focus directed forward. The distraction helps resurface Harry’s Gryffindor courage.
“It’s – that’s not how it works. It’s not natural.”
“It’s an acquired kink.”
He stands up immediately under his mother’s control, eyes glassy, body limp, as if held up by puppet strings alone. The other Draco grips him by the arm, squeezing tighter than strictly necessary.
Teddy turned around and started a chant of “Lalalalala…”
It appears that all Harry is going to learn from this expedition is that Malfoy is living in a tiny little dormitory alone. It’s not exactly going to help him work out what’s going on with Malfoy, but at least he knows where to find him now. Perhaps he can break down Malfoy’s careful façade slowly, wait for something to slip accidentally. “I’m rubbish at Chess. What about Exploding Snap?”
“What a waste of my time,” Malfoy is saying as he continues to pace back and forth in front of Harry. “I can’t even kill you.  It’s
It didn’t. Harry’s eyes followed the action. After years of being completely oblivious,
He kept as still as he could manage – even keeping his breaths shallow to avoid too much movement of his chest – while he thought of possible escape options. If they weren’t at Hogwarts, he would have just apparated away, far far away, so he wouldn’t be around to witness Malfoy’s reaction. Here, the only choice was to slip out of Malfoy’s grasp slowly. But as soon as he started slinking away, Malfoy only gripped on
Harry sits up a little straighter, drawn into the mystery immediately. “What are you going to do?”
“And here you thought his feelings to me were unbiased. Guess you’re not as clever as you– ”
“Have you not seen my arm, Potter?” Interrupted Draco before he could be guilt-tripped - that was Potter’s speciality. “I was
Draco skips over this. For once, he’s happy for someone else to be a couple of steps behind. “I’m going to see my mother tomorrow.”
Draco paused. “Yes?”
What do you want me to say?”
Harry rolled his eyes as he leant back in for take two. This time, Draco laid another charm on him, but it wasn’t so much magic as it was
Malfoy tugged the robe tighter over his chest and crossed his arms. “But you came.”
Harry looked up at Draco, suspicious. “Are you just trying to make this up to me out of pity?”
Despite the exciting prospect of the activities to follow, Draco was still disappointed when the dance ended. He’d have much rathered they be the last ones to leave the dance floor. But he couldn’t help Potter’s hormones, so he reluctantly (gladly) allowed Potter to lead him from the Ministry, only stopping to exchange various pleasantries with familiar faces. If they thought anything of Draco and Potter’s linked arms, they didn’t show it, which was a relief. Draco really didn’t want to explain they were leaving the ball early to fuck. It really wasn’t proper at this sort of event.
Draco stood up and moved closer to Harry. How to make him understand? He still didn’t seem to be able to see what was right there in front of him, even when Draco had explained it so clearly. Draco had to try another approach, something Harry couldn’t interpret any other way.
“If you’re going to flirt with me, Potter, do it louder so people will overhear.”
They stared at each other for a moment longer, Harry held completely by Malfoy’s eyes, until Malfoy turned away and the spell was broken.
Draco nods and looks back down. “The spell. There’s no cure,” he explains. “They keep reopening. Severus taught me how to stop the bleeding but it’s only ever temporary.”
When Harry had accepted Remus’s offer to be Teddy’s godfather, although in the thick of war, he still never considered he’d actually have to raise someone else’s child. Teddy’s grandmother, Andromeda, had taken care of Teddy originally, which Harry was glad of - a 17 year old did not a father make. Still, he made sure to visit often. He knew what it was like to grow up without parents.
Draco caught Harry’s eye – he was currently enveloped in Molly Weasley’s arms – and smiled. For the first time, Draco felt like perhaps he belonged.
“She doesn’t have one,” Harry says stiffly. He’d sometimes been jealous of that. Not having a soulmate might have been easier. Anything would have been easier than having Draco Malfoy as his. “We both wanted children.” He adds by way of explanation. That had been the whole basis of their marriage. Harry had lied to Draco of course. He’d never really moved on.
on me,” in response. Although, it was clear Potter appreciated it from the muffled grunt that came through the phone line.
Well, someone in dreamland is listening to Harry’s thoughts (perhaps his own subconscious which is controlling this whole charade) because the very next thing that happens is Malfoy kicking the blanket off his body completely and okay, he’s wearing underpants, but it’s the most Harry’s seen so far and he’s not ashamed that it makes him lose his breathe a little. He’s not the MOST experienced person. And he’s never had dreams as vivid as this before.
Draco looked at him expectantly, remaining half behind the bookshelf as if afraid to come out any further. Harry realised Draco was still waiting for an answer. “Nothing,” he said, shaking his head. “It was stupid.”
“But you already have detention together and–”
of you.” He drops his voice to a whisper, conscious his voice has been raising with every word. “Let me fall in love with all of you.”
And if Potter doesn’t turn up, Draco is going to need to find another dinner partner, and he doesn’t fancy seeing his mother (obviously) or enduring another guilt-ridden dinner with a stranger.
“Come on, then,” Harry urges, taking another step forward. “Tell me.”
“I don’t know either,” Harry admitted. “Why don’t we forget it for now and just do what feels good?” he suggested.
Malfoy turned away back to his table, crossing his arms. “I suppose you wish Weasley was your soulmate,” he said quietly, the bitterness of his tone revealing something more than just his usual irritation. Malfoy was upset.
“I took a break.”
He’d been so focused on his high, he didn’t even know if Potter had, you know, swallowed his come or not. Which wasn’t really important of course. But now that Draco thought about it, he really wanted to know. He
Tonks actually jumped with relief - making Harry immediately regret his decision - and clapped Harry on the shoulder appreciatively before wasting no time in rushing back into the office in the cafe kitchens.
“Malfoy!” Potter’s voice called out behind him.
Harry loved it when Draco said his name like that. There was need, appreciation, affection, urgency and patience all in the one word. And Harry was more than happy to deliver. He wanted to give Draco everything, and right now that included the best fucking blowjob he’d ever received.
want me to call you. What’s your problem?”
“No,” Potter confirmed, stretching out the word. “I’m a waste of money.”
“You don’t - “ Draco started to repeat, frustration leaking into his voice. “What are your symptoms? How has this mystery curse affected you?”
“You have to see this,” Harry said. “Look down. Look at your chest.”
“Until the full moon?”
“Know what, Potter?”
Harry lets him go, the image of the scars burnt into his brain. They didn’t seem a year old, they looked almost fresh. But there was no mistaking the pattern. Those scars were Harry’s work.
“Malfoy.” Harry prodded Malfoy’s side. “Malfoy.”
And Harry wakes up with another erection he has to ignore.
But why couldn’t you just let me have this? Just one silly desperate hope to cling onto. That’s all I–“
“Speaking of duty, there are some old conservatives arriving that I need to schmooze. Harry - good to see you as always. Healer Malfoy, glad to have made your acquaintance.” The Minister took her leave politely, striding over to the entrance and greeting two elderly men who appeared to already be arguing with one of the waiters.
Harry stood his ground. “
“Word travels fast.”
“Now,” Potter said, his voice half serious, half teasing, “in your imagination, how were you picturing my hands? Was it one on my cock, and perhaps the other playing with a nipple, or did you like the idea of
Harry was gentle and patient and more likely to start speaking in fluent French than to ever push Draco’s boundaries. The pressure to explain came from Draco’s mind alone.
Yes! Draco shouts internally. “I suppose so,” is what he says aloud to Potter. “Only because you begged so desperately.”
“Every night?”
Draco held back a snort. Of course Potter wasn’t leaving. It was November the effing third. “Neither am I.”
would be the one moaning with the sensation of
Malfoy pushes him aside and begins working on Harry’s potion. Slicing, crushing, adding, stirring, too fast for Harry to follow. The fumes begin to subside. Harry’s head is still spinning.
“Has Mr Weasley left for work yet?”
“We’re here to make you a deal,” Harry offers.
November third. It should have been a day like any other. Except it never was. Not for Draco Malfoy.
“No.” Was that a dig? There was nothing wrong with silk pyjamas. A fact Potter should already know having had his own pair at Hogwarts, not that Draco ever received any thanks for that. “Don’t presume to - ‘
“Sure,” - Draco’s whole body heated up in anticipation, finally! - “but that’s not my desk anymore.” Harry took a step back.
Potter’s soft laughter through the phone line did nothing to help Draco’s painfully hard cock. “I can’t quite work you out, Malfoy.”
“Here,” Madam Pomfrey says, conjuring two small medicine cups and holding them out to Slughorn to pour the antidote into. “How are we going to get them to drink it at the same time?”
He’s…
“Well, all the stars look the same.”
“Come on,” Harry says, standing up – a little too fast, his legs wobble precariously but he keeps his balance. He’s used to the feeling. “I’ll take you to St Mungo’s.”
“But what has that got to do with me? I can’t help it if I’m not his true love.”
Harry follows Ron’s pointed finger to find Malfoy’s dot accompanied by the description:
Malfoy looked away, immediately disinterested and Hermione stopped the pretence and ran to Ron, settling into his lap before finally kissing him. The room groaned again.
“I wouldn’t want them anyway.”
“Don’t – “
Harry quickly turned back to his doily. ‘Nothing.” The desire to return to biting his nails was strong but Harry resisted. He’d need to be brave if he was going to meet his soulmate in front of Draco fucking Malfoy. He settled on tapping his fingers under the table instead.
The next day when Malfoy walks into their morning DADA class, Harry’s eyes hone in on him as usual. Only this time he’s also thinking about Malfoy shirtless, instead of just mid-orgasm. It’s a little disconcerting. But I’m sure you’ll agree that what’s even more disconcerting is what happens next.
“Ah,” Draco draws out the word. “I just wasn’t good enough, was I?” He asks, his cold humour cutting as always. “Thought you could pick again?”
“Yes, my place,” Potter continues, all the while smiling across the table. “Draco won’t be able to resist my homemade risotto.”
It did.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione’s eyes widen. “Why didn’t you say so before?”
“I was going to kiss you,” Harry said. “I
Mr Weasley appeared seconds later, ash covering his shoulders. “What is it, Molly?”
“That’s not what I said,” Draco said quickly. He downed the last of his glass and held it out to Potter – an easy escape from a conversation that had become too serious. “Get me a refill, would you?”
“Gladly,” Zabini answers without blinking.
,” Draco interrupts again, knocking past Harry violently. He strides down the corridor alone heading to the entrance. Harry considers following him.
pulling up his pants! What kind of atrocious etiquette was that? Draco wasn’t expecting to be spooned or anything - but now that Potter had gotten off, his next priority should be giving Draco a hand - either literally or figuratively - not adjusting his belt buckle!
“Then we do our job and arrest him,” Harry says in his responsible matter-of-fact voice. It always impresses the new recruits but never Hermione.
Please read The Daily Prophet tomorrow morning.
a little faster than normal,” Draco said quietly, dropping his hand. "Do you often feel out of breath?” He asked, eyes flickering back up to Harry’s face.
do that?”
“She is not!” Harry laughs because the idea is so ridiculous. Ron and Hermione are the most revolting lovey-dovey couple Hogwarts has likely ever seen. They’re always holding hands, even beneath the table during classes, and their public snogs are infamous.
Pansy’s face splits, no relaxes, into a smile and – oh no – there’s a hint of water swimming in her eyes. “Oh Draco. Thank Merlin. We can go to the hospital now if – “
Fuck. Fucking fuck. Fucking fuck fuck. Well, he won’t be so cocky tonight. Or perhaps he will be cocky, very cocky, but in a completely different way. And Harry’s alright with that. Because he’s pretty sure that while he’s getting off with Draco Malfoy every night, he can win over Draco Malfoy in the morning, day by day.  It’s a challenge. And Merlin knows, Harry Potter’s more than a match for Draco Malfoy.
The green paint turned out exactly as he wanted it, a perfect replica of its inspiration, Draco thought. He set it aside, eager for the chance to use it later. Since he had time to kill, he figured he may as well get a start on the background, so he began lightly sketching in the lines of the Quidditch pitch and the surrounding stadiums with a thin pencil. He’d just started drawing the hoops at the far side of the pitch when a voice pulled him out of focus.
“You – you can’t just stand in the middle of the footpath!” Malfoy yelled, his indignance marred by the ridiculousness of what he was saying.
Potter’s smile covered a laugh as he followed instruction and sat down - he didn’t look sick at all. “Good Afternoon, Healer Malfoy,” he said in a serious voice that only Draco could tell was mocking.
“Okay,” Potter said slowly. “Do you know what it does? How it works?”
To Harry’s disappointment, for lack of a much stronger, heartbreaking word, Malfoy and Zabini appear to make up. At least, now that Malfoy’s back in the Great Hall for meals, he’s sitting with his Slytherin buddies of course, but always next to – and much too close to – Blaise Zabini.
Harry pauses a second, his brain ticking over, processing. “Ever? But – “
Draco watched the words fall easily from his mouth. “I’m sick of thinking about this. And I’m sick of acting the opposite to how I feel and saying things that don’t mean anything. I don’t care if I’m not your soulmate and you’re only going to leave me for some brown eyed jerk with far less style and class– ”
“What?”
Ron looped his arm around Draco and pulled him away from the column. “I can almost see what Harry sees in you if I squint and pretend to have a bad sense of humour.”
Draco was furious. First, that wild animal of Hagrid’s had attacked him - and he still had the sling to prove it even if it wasn’t completely necessary - and second, one of the horrid nifflers that same oaf had brought onto school grounds had ambushed Draco and stolen the shiny Malfoy crest pin right off his robes.
“Yes?” Harry prompts. Merlin, he’ll listen to any theory. He just wants this all to start making sense.
Harry pulls out his notebook, determined to get
“How many werewolves do you supply?”
Malfoy frowns and looks Harry up and down. “I will do no such thing. Perhaps
“Oh.” Draco took a step away from it. “Whatever, Ronald. I want to talk to Potter.”
“So…Monday? Am I invited?” Potter asks, back to his typical direct fashion. It’s really quite unsettling.
Despite his words, Draco was still disappointed when Potter did exactly that.
that.
Harry crosses his legs for the rest of the lesson and tries only to glance at Malfoy every 20 or so seconds. It takes great personal restraint. He’s a little (okay, very, are you happy now?) disappointed that Malfoy doesn’t look his way again.
, -“ perhaps that was a bit of an exaggeration or  an outright lie - “waiting for
Potter,
“I’m not sure, Malfoy. You’re the one flirting with me this time.” Potter says, his tone feigning innocence, his expression more smirk than smile. The bastard!
Draco’s lips twitched. “You didn’t last year.”
Harry’s eyes drifted involuntarily to Malfoy’s chest, but just for a second. “That was – but – I don’t –
Ron turns to Hermione. “I’m not leaving you here with –” he looks over at Draco uncertainly and then to Malfoy on the floor, before turning back to Hermione – “you know.”
“What?” Draco says, surprised. Although he hasn’t failed to notice how Potter did not answer his question.
Draco stops laughing. “A date?” He repeats. “You think this is a date?” Draco goes back over his actions. He asked Potter out for dinner. Dinner. Dates and flirting were certainly not mentioned. Draco doesn’t remember the conversation all that well but he certainly would have picked up on
“You have a lot feelings,” Potter repeated blankly.
Harry wants to tell Draco he’s wrong. Of course, he’s wrong. After all the time they’ve spent together, with everything that Draco has made Harry feel. How can that be nothing? How can
Teddy wasn’t fooled. “Mrs Oakson said - “
They break apart as the rain begins to wean off, both panting, although Harry notices Malfoy trying to stifle his heaving breathing, as if not willing to show how affected he is. Which seems rather pointless following the sounds he’d been making during the kiss.
(See the end of the chapter for
Okay, Harry should probably be used to dying and rising from the dead by now, but for those who aren’t personally familiar with the feeling, it’s very odd. Not quite like sleeping like they say,
Draco swivelled around and leant back on Hagrid’s table - better to be facing his opponent when the first curse was cast. “One of that half-breed’s nifflers is what - “
“That’s what I would have done,” Harry responded when he realised he’d been staring at Draco for too long.
Harry doesn’t recognise the song.
Draco wanted to scream Yes! Nothing had been more okay in his life than this moment. But, he settled for a snarky comment, although even then he couldn’t hide his eagerness to see Harry Potter naked. “Shut up, you gorgeous bastard and take your pants off.”
“Sorry, sorry, sorry,” Ron whispers guiltily as he scrambles into the bed next to Harry’s, “I didn’t realise the damn door was going to be that loud.”
Malfoy spins around the bedpost and sits down on the edge of the bed. His eyes land on Harry’s with dizzying intensity. “I don’t have any injuries but I’m sure you can come up with another excuse to touch me.”
“If you just want to have sex again, choose someone else,” Draco interrupted quickly, his recent uplift in mood taking a turn in the other direction. Sex with Potter was great but it wasn’t enough anymore. And if that’s all Potter wanted… “I’m sure there are plenty of people here who would jump at the opportunity.”
Malfoy’s eyes threaten to bug out of their sockets. “Wait it out?” He repeats incredulously. “Wait it out!? You want me to wait this out? Are you fucking kidding me, Potter?” He lets out a frustrated growl. “Why do you have to be so noble all the time?” He moves in closer to Harry. “I know you want me so let’s fu – Granger!”
Harry would love to be as confident as Hermione but they haven’t exactly learned anything. “We still don’t even know what ingredient – “
It explains Hermione’s Patronus. And the hole. He can’t believe the Department of Magical Creatures went ahead with the raid so quickly. “A baby?” He finally manages to choke out. “Why didn’t they regist–”
Pansy relaxes her face and looks at Draco seriously. “I’ll keep it up for as long as I need to. As long as you need me.”
Malfoy kept his eyes on Harry as he took a small sip of firewhisky. “Then next time,
“Ginny’s not even here– ”
Sleeping Potter shrugged against the wall. “You were mean to Ron.”
“That’s a fairly obvious one, Potter. Anyone who's seen my skin would know that.” They reached the Dungeons and Malfoy whispered a password to what looked like an ordinary wall but immediately sprung open at Malfoy’s words. “Your hair gets messier the madder you are,” Malfoy said over his shoulder as he led Harry into the Slytherin Common Room.
“You…?“ Potter prompted, waiting to hear Draco’s ill-thought out confession.
“Trust you?” Harry echoes automatically in disbelief, before realising he actually might. This smiling Malfoy, has a calming effect on Harry and he isn’t sure what to make of it. “Sure,” he adds before he knows the word is coming out his mouth.
Instead of asking the obvious, as Harry could only imagine the horrible circumstances in which Draco would have been fed the potion, he asked: “What kind of things?”
“Truth or dare,” he said, placing his cup back down. It wobbled but Ron’s hand shot out and grabbed it just in time.
“I wouldn’t have to be if
Draco pulled at Harry’s collar loosening the buttons. “Tell me later,” he insisted. He didn't think he could concentrate on anything else right now.
my permission.”
But Potter didn’t say anything further. He simply winked at Draco with those devilishly charming eyes (that made Draco’s knees go weak) before mounting his broom and flying off towards the pitch, his shape growing smaller and smaller until he was just a speck in the distance.
Harry tried to imagine the implications himself but thought better of it when a number of images appeared in his head too inappropriate to entertain in a library. He shuffled in his seat. “I like your cheekbones,” he said.
“He’s being
“Because of you - “
Draco averted his eyes from Harry’s crotch - it wasn’t his fault it was at his eye level from where he sat, like a regular person, on a CHAIR. “Well, you’re certainly not as hard as I’d like you to be,” he commented, safe in the knowledge it would go straight over Harry’s head.
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter was being especially cryptic today. “Returned
, there it was. The first splash of come on Potter’s face and wasn’t that a fucking spectacular sight? The rest came out of Draco in a brilliant high, all the while Potter blinked up at him.
“No. We specifically said – “
Harry swallows. “Did you want to–” he starts.
It was something Harry had seen in muggle movies as a kid. The sunlight would stream in from the window, highlighting the sleeping face of the heroine. The protagonist would stare at their lover fondly and have an epiphany, or realise their love.
“You’re not leaving,” Harry observes.
Somehow Draco figured Potter was going to say something like that. “Fine, but I - I don’t know what to say.”
Harry resists the urge to roll his eyes. He is determined to be a mature adult even if Draco isn’t. “Malfoy, don’t be dramatic.”
“You weren’t too bad yourself, Malfoy,” Harry said over his shoulder, bright sunshine lighting up the winning grin he did ever so well. Reporters loved it. Fans loved it. And Draco was absolutely besotted with it.
. “He called me Harry. He’s never called me Harry!”
Draco froze for a second and considered denying it…before realising how pointless that would be. “How did you know it was me?”
It’s not the first time Harry’s died. In fact, it’s the third time the lightning green bolt of Avada Kedavra has hit him. So, he shouldn’t be so surprised when his brains flickers to life again. But, he really thought this time was it. In the split second he had to comprehend what was happening before the green bolt hit him, all he could think was
Or last week when Draco had to reschedule their agreed custody routine because he had a date on Thursday night and Harry said, “Hope you have a lovely night,” but what he’d really wanted to say was, “I hope your date throws wine in your face and leaves you with the bill.”
His target, a too-thin and too-angular boy with white-blond hair and pale grey eyes like the clouds on a sunny day, stands by the grand doors, as if readying an escape.
And when Harry pulled himself back up, and started laughing too, Draco found that he couldn’t stop. As much as he still wanted that kiss, he didn’t think there could be anything better than laughing with Harry Potter.
“Ahhhh, yes very interesting ingredient, asphodel root. Excellent choice Miss Granger.” Slughorn beams down at her.
Merlin, this was embarrassing. He’d wanted this for ages, and now, when it was literally at his fingertips, he couldn’t go through with it. He dropped his head to avoid Harry’s eye. “Sorry, I know I said I wanted to - but I - it’s just - I’m a virgin.”
“There,” he says, a little breathlessly.
“We love you too, daddy!"
Mrs Dunberg nods.
When he fell asleep, he was pleased to return to a journey of space travel with Draco on their magical unicorn.
A fucking what. It’s pathetic. So pathetic. And bad. And Draco knows. He fucking knows.
Draco’s point about Champagne on the floor was lost, and gladly. Because instead of teaching Potter about basic etiquette, Draco was being taught by Potter how to kiss. Not that he didn’t know how to kiss. He hadn’t just been pining after Potter for four (eleven) years. But Potter’s lips were something else.
Master Tomeaxe takes the floor after Narcissa for one last statement. “We request that we, the goblins, be allowed to take the wix responsible for the actions of the muggles—the wix who assumed illegal custody, who
“I’ll pick yours out,” Draco offers, “you focus on getting one for Hermione.”
Hari is blushing like mad by this point, but he can’t look away from Draco.
“I see,” Mrs. Granger looks at him concerned. “And no one else could hold the titles until you’re older?”
“Those things got on the train and are terrorizing students! Remus had to throw them off! Start the train, now!”
Draco and Hari nod and Professor Snape releases them. They practically run to the R.O.R, where the whole group is waiting for them.
.” He’d looked up the word and turns out, it translates to home. They’re whisked away to Potter Manor.
“It’s a nice room to look at,” she says. “It’s nice to meet you, Hari Potter, Draco Malfoy, Daphne Greengrass, Pansy Parkinson, and Blaise Zabini. Shame I didn’t get to meet Hermione Granger.”
“Sorry?”
“What will she be needing today?”
Hari reaches for Draco and places his thumb over his ring, “
Master Tomeaxe looks up, slightly surprised, but his lips curl and he nods towards Hari, “Lord Potter.”
“Dray, I need a witness,” Hari looks to his best friend.
This even smaller area has what appears to be only seven shops. There’s a book shop, apothecary, tailor, general clothing shop, a café, a bar, and a restaurant.
“But we hardly got to kiss at all yesterday,” Draco whines, following Hari out of the alcove.
“Dobby!” In an instant, the little house elf is in front of them. “Take a message to Mother that my friends and I are going out and will be back in time for dinner.”
“I’m not concerned about that,” Hari hisses, “I want the Dementors
“Oh, yes,” Draco lays them out, then turns to study Hari. “I’m going to do your hair. I think something Viking-esque would be ideal.” Hari jumps up and starts to change, not noticing Draco go pink behind him.
) is something distinctly prey scented. He prowls that way and is immensely pleased to see a replica of a large cattle-like animal grazing on its own. Foolish on its part. He licks his lips and prepares to spring.
“No. She’s too…” Draco waves a hand after her. “I don’t really know how to say it. Yes, she’s very loyal and hard-working, but she’s also absolutely crazy. I swear, you say one bad thing about someone or something she cares about, you’ll find yourself dead and buried before you have a chance to apologize.”
“I believe we told you to use our names,” Hari chides teasingly and Hermione blushes.
“Master Hari is liking to cook for fun? Lady Lily be doing the same! Critter will teach Master Hari all the recipes Critter is knowing.”
With that cleared up, the teachers actually look pleased.
“Oh, Merlin,” Draco crinkles his nose, “I remember that. I always got grouped with Crabbe and Goyle and they are so
Hari turns away, guilt churning in his stomach.
will remove that. Leave it on until just before classes tomorrow,” he tells her, “then just brush it off.” Hermione nods and studies the design with a small, happy smile. “And someone tell me why I decided to be mature and step out for the part of the meeting where they discuss students?”
“I’ve heard there is some debate over who counts as a scion?”
A rumbling chuff comes from her right. Ajay strolls out of the vegetation and nuzzles her hip with his nose.
“Works for me,” Hari grins, then thumbs his Slytherin ring and calls, “Hogwarts.” The swirling lasts only for a moment, ending when he lands in the Entrance Hall.
“We’ve got a half hour, then,” Draco says after flicking his wrist to cast a Tempus charm. “I’d say more, but you’ll have to floo to Hogsmeade and walk up.”
Hari smiles back, “remind me to show you my memories of him realizing what was happening, it was beautiful.” Hari shows Sirius into the room they had landed. “Padfoot, these are my friends, Heir Draco Malfoy, Heir Daphne Greengrass, Heir Pansy Parkinson, Heir Blaise Zabini, and Miss Hermione Granger.” They all nod to him, but Hari can see that Hermione almost slipped into a bow. “Everyone, this is Sirius Black, my godfather. Oh, and Padfoot, I did a ritual to accept Hermione into my House.”
“Okay,” Hari says when they’re huddled in a little alcove, “what’s your plan?”
“This will tell you everything you need to know for that,” he says smugly. Hari smiles gratefully and snatches the book out of the air.
“Because you’re not a gossip monger, like some people,” Draco corrects, shooting a pointed glance at Pansy. Hari laughs and cuddles into Draco’s shoulder.
“Dray, I’m going to be going between the castle and the Wizengamot. I’m already thinking I’m taking too many electives,” Hari explains, holding Draco’s wrists, “Wandlore and Arithmancy and Runes might have to get dropped, too.”
“Oh, I want to do them all,” Hermione sighs somewhat dreamily, “I just hope there’s enough time in the day.”
“Or floo. Or take the Knight Bus.”
There’s a prickle of magic in the air and then he can hear even more—creatures. There’s creatures in the room. Ajay lets out a happy snarl and crouches low, slinking through the undergrowth. Off a little ways, close to the door where Draco and the others (
“Well,” Blaise snickers, “that’d be willful blindness.”
Mr. Granger nods once, sharply. “Please, do the charm.”
“Oh,” she looks incredibly pleased and surprised at the question, “you want to know my name?” Hari studies her, concerned by this statement. “I’m Luna Lovegood,” she bows politely, “it’s good to meet you.”
“I—I don’t know what to say,” he whispers.
This.
Draco laughs, “yeah, but your appetite is pretty much up to where it should be, so that shouldn’t be an issue.”
“Of course,” Hari nods, “I’ll see you after the meeting.”
“Lord Potter,” Theo approaches their table a little while later, “Heirs.” He bows neatly and Hari nods back. Pansy and Blaise rise and bow to Theo, greeting him politely. He nods.
“Would you like to floo or port-key there?” Hari asks Hermione.
“Not right now, actually,” Hermione shakes her head, “Hari was just teaching me how to call you.”
On the way through the Manor to the back exit, Daphne manages to give Hari a discrete thumbs up. They pass out the back door into a wide, open garden that appears to have a building at the back of it.
“Smart move,” the witch smiles at him. She extends her hand, “Auror Nymphadora Tonks, but just call me Tonks.” Hari clasps her wrist. “This is my partner, Auror Kingsley Shacklebot.”
“Hari, Draco, Daphne, you, and Blaise, right? Theo was pretty much in the middle if I remember correctly,” Hermione tilts her head, sleek waves falling off her shoulder. Daphne eyes them enviously.
“The motion is carried,” declares Lord Greengrass.
Lady Zabini sighs, “Miss Umbridge, this is getting tiring. Lord Potter just stated that Fenrir Greyback is a known outlier. Arguing that he is not an outlier based on statistics that include him is foolhardy.”
“All the Heads of Houses are trained,” Draco confirms. “So, I’ll let Professor Snape know, although I would bet Professor Flitwick is already looking at testing her.”
“Because if they don’t know a personality they should prepare for, you can use it to get under their skin and win,” Professor Snape presumes. Hari nods excitedly.
“Listen,” she can’t outright say Draco had told her, but she can point out the obvious. And clear up the muggle misconceptions. “He stares at you all the time, gets jealous whenever you hug anyone else, is constantly finding excuses to touch you, and buys you random treats.”
“Oh, Hari,” she breathes, “yes, yes, it’s all absolutely alright.” Hari takes in a shaking breath. “Listen, sweetheart, it’s okay, you’re okay. Whatever you want to be, whomever you want to be with, it’s
Hari thinks about this for a long moment, then says, “I can understand not wanting someone with different views than you to be in charge. However, I think it’s beneficial if the Chief Warlock isn’t a Lord or Lady. In fact, I think they shouldn’t even be part of a House. It would prevent them from being biased and prejudiced. But from what I’ve heard of Madam Bones, she’s able to maintain neutrality even when faced with people her House is pitted against. She’s fair and she’ll hear everyone out equally.”
“What about the half-blood prince?”
The days in the Hospital usually went quickly as there was always a constant stream of patients to be assessed. Draco was hoping this particular day would be the same, as it was November third, and as soon as he got home, he was going to call Harry Potter.
?” Harry repeats a little too loudly. He looks around and lowers his voice. “Malfoy, I mean, just so you know, you weren’t the only one who enjoyed–”
“Hey, I’m Harry,” he said on approach, holding out a hand. The man stared at it, his expression unchanging. “This is the part where you tell me your name and we shake hands,” Harry prompted.
“I have a friend who wants to take the next step –
“It wasn’t an insult.”
“Did you get them?” Draco asked, without looking up. He hadn’t torn his head from the screen all day. Not since Harry had introduced him to “viddy” games, as Draco was calling them.
Harry’s mouth fell open on its own. But it wasn’t the fire show that surprised him. He had seen it at Draco’s hand a million times before - each time as unique as the last. No, it was what Draco was wearing: a scarlet hand-knitted sweater. And Harry didn’t need Draco to turn around to know there was a big golden ‘D” knitted into the front.
“Worry isn’t how I’d describe my thought process,” Potter says his eyes firmly focused on the final bag he is unpacking.
“He means why do you speak parseltongue when you catch the snitch,” Blaise translated.
“You like the rain.”
Draco certainly wasn’t the only one in the office charmed by Harry. He’d noticed some of the other aurors staring too - during the rare moments when he could pull his eyes away from Harry. And it wasn’t just Harry’s looks. If it were just that, Draco would have gotten over it years ago. No, Harry had to be brave too. And powerful. And a little wild. And above all, kind.
Parkinson smiled wickedly and moved onto the next person. Harry felt sick. He should have walked away, but he was curious about Malfoy. Ron rubbed his shoulder.
The second time Harry Potter sees the scars he left on Draco Malfoy, it’s somehow even worse than the first.
Out of nowhere, Potter said, “You know you can call me Harry, right?”
“Hermione!” Harry calls after her but she’s already left the office.
“As stupid as this?” Draco asked. His hand went to the cuff of his sleeve but then he pulled back and just pointed at his left forearm instead. Harry understood all the same, although he couldn’t quite get Draco’s tone. Was he joking?
Ron, although slow on the uptake, came to Harry’s rescue as usual. “Malfoy must have mentioned it before.”
“No, it’s not,” Draco lied again. He knew now he could not escape impending humiliation, only delay it. His entire body tensed uncomfortably in anticipation.
“I’ve been testing some vision-enhancing spells to help with training,” Potter explains as he places the glasses on. “Most of them don’t last very long so I’m usually walking around with – Malfoy!” Potter shouts having finally looked up over at Draco. “You’re…I mean you look…are you…”
“Draco.”
(See the end of the chapter for
?” Draco whispered urgently to Potter. He couldn’t seriously be intending to give Draco a blowjob
things?” Pansy repeated, her face lighting up - that was never a good sign. “Like a tingly feeling in your - “
“Malfoy,” Harry interrupts. “Go home, that’s an order.”
Draco must have gaped too long, because Potter snatched the note back and added another line.
“I love you,” Narcissa says, still holding him as if he hasn’t shut her out for the last week, as if he hadn’t yelled at her, berated her, and said the most dreadful things.
“Potter,” drawls a voice behind Harry.
Harry ignores this and tries to focus on Hermione’s earlier words.
“It’s just a scratch,” Malfoy says quickly.
Malfoy leans back down and claims Harry’s lips, soft at first, but the wanting quickly gives way to something harder, and soon Harry is a mess of desire, fighting against Malfoy’s legs for more friction. It’s Malfoy who pulls back, laughing, as he releases his legs and rolls onto his back beside Harry.
care for you.”
“He never touched me like this,” Draco said, his voice automatically dropping to a whisper in response. Blaise had been passionate but he was hard and fast. There never seemed to be any time for caresses like this or even just eye contact. Potter’s bright eyes
the right question to expose Draco, and render his choosing truth absolutely pointless.
“You’re getting
Harry didn’t bother to reply. He couldn’t help but think that without their connection of Teddy, Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter weren’t anything to each other anymore. Not even enemies.
“It is your name after all.” Potter says in feigned lightness. Draco doesn’t look up, he can’t make eye contact, but he hears Potter breathe a deep sigh and then: “I know.”
But it was too late for that. Now Harry had to know what, or who, could possibly make Malfoy blush that hard. “I’ll find out soon enough so you might as well tell me,” he teased.
He doesn’t bother to dwell on the consequences any further and Apparates directly to Malfoy Manor. The gates are already open. And when he walks up to the door, it opens immediately to reveal a grave looking Malfoy.
Harry nodded politely. “Sure,” he said, pulling on his fake smile.
“And you like tea,” Potter added, suddenly the expert on Draco.
“Subtle,” Draco remarks, although he’s unsure if Potter meant to refer to Voldemort’s reign in general or Draco’s trial. Each are fairly terrifying on their own. He has to remind himself Potter asked him a question before he replies. “I moved out.” Draco tries to think of anything else. He can’t. “That’s it I suppose.”
“I didn’t steal your hair, Malfoy. At least not on purpose.”
Hermione’s eyebrows knit together, her mouth becomes small.  “Do you think you’ll kiss again?”
Draco only pulled away when he thought his knees might give up. His light headedness had travelled to the rest of his body and he knew he didn’t have much standing left in him. Not when Potter was doing those things with his tongue.
Harry blushed. “Charlie and I never– ”
“Come back tomorrow,” Draco said from behind him - Harry froze, hope rising in his gut. "Just make sure you have some better material.”
“Teddy will need a responsible adult to look after him in case I have a few drinks.”
Potter smiled, sweet and innocent, and absolutely maddening. “I haven’t suggested anything.”
Draco couldn’t think of a single objection to Potter’s incredibly brilliant plan.
At the end of class, Malfoy jumps to his feet first, moving swiftly to the door at the back of the room. As he passes the back row, he catches Harry’s eye and smiles, actually smiles, not smirks, and says with a nod, “Morning, Harry.”
Potter didn’t say anything for a moment. With his eyes closed, the silence felt longer for Draco. He couldn’t decipher what Potter was doing - until he felt a heavy weight next to him. Draco’s eyes jerked open in surprise. Potter was lying next to him.
pick someone else this time, Weasley,” Parkinson said. “You can’t keep doing the same dare every week.”
“Yes I did,” Harry said honestly. “I just didn’t know if you wanted me to say anything.”
“And you’re always right, of course,” Draco said, a touch of sarcasm under baked in his tone. Harry suspected this would be a very different conversation with a sober Draco.
“Thirty-four and counting.” Malfoy winked. “You know, Potter, if you were to take me out to dinner, I’m sure the outing might be scandalous enough to make the front page. We could add to both our collections.”
“You’re staring.”
“So it
Draco nods, his gaze fixed on the train. “If soulmates are real, so is destiny, or fate, or whatever you want to call it. I know I was meant to have Scorpius. He’s changed me, Harry, he really has. I’m a different person.” He turns to Harry as the train horn sounds. “I think now I could be who you wanted me to be. Who
“I stand by my position, hardly at all.”
“Thanks, Draco,” Hari calls to his friend, who’s getting ready next door in Hari’s room.
“Would you be able to take a look at Hermione’s feet?” Hari winces, looking incredibly like a guilty puppy. “I forgot to cushion her shoes before we came.”
After the others have their turns, the Wizengamot will have their say.
“Owner must’ve owl ordered,” a third adds. Draco smirks from his seat.
“This is more extravagant than my Manor,” Draco says, in awe.
“Are you ready to go?” Hari whispers to Hermione.
“I call Goblin Solicitor Tomeaxe to the floor.”
“It’ll pass, right?”
“Like this morning wasn’t bad enough?” Pansy whines, “Aside from you breaking up the monotony, that was the dullest morning yet. Mostly because of who was speaking.”
“Hermione,” Daphne calls out instead of responding. “There you are.”
“She definitely would.”
“Well, you’re not big,” Draco snorts and sets Hari gently into a chair. He starts scooping food onto Hari’s plate. Narcissa settles across from Draco’s seat.
“I do.”
“You were almost late.”
“This is true,” Hari concedes, “however, as someone raised in the House of Black, Professor Tonks is educated in both our government and politics. After the tiered period of three years, we could add one class from fifth year and up on this subject with her as the teacher.”
“Of course,” Hari rises and crosses to the counter quickly to pay, then returns. “I’ll see about getting you those port-keys before Monday. And hopefully, your house will be on the floo network by then. I’ll keep you updated by owl.”
We visit some properties and learn to dance in this one. No big plot events here. Let me know your thoughts!
“I thought that was Madam Malkin?”
“He’s been trying not to think about it,” Draco informs them.
“Great idea!” Pansy agrees immediately, “although, your parents will have to share where they found it. It’s a gorgeous bag and I must have one for the school year.”
permission to so much as step foot in these wards, let alone send Dementors here.” Fudge goes pale, just then realizing Hari had actually studied this. “I believe those charges would include trespassing, attempted false arrest, and human rights infringement. What, fifteen years in Azkaban? If the court chooses to be lenient?”
They eat with idle chatter about their days, although the details of Hari’s meetings are left out by Lucius’ design. Not that it matters. As soon as they get up to their joined rooms, Draco rounds on Hari.
Draco stares at him for a long moment, eyes wide, before breathing, “Loony Lovegood…” He shakes his head, “yes, they could. They most often do, to be honest, until someone recognizes it as Seeing.”
“Okay, well, I don’t feel the need to look at those,” Hari sighs, “since I presume I won’t be using them, at least not any time soon. Let’s just see the Lord’s suite and study.”
“Did you see who he voted for?” Blaise asks.
Hari laughs, “I felt the same way at first, but they both have their uses. Come on,” he leads her towards the apparition point, “Narcissa should be over here.” A few too many people bow as they pass for the walk to be comfortable, but they find Narcissa quickly.
“Good. Master Hari be teaching Miss Hermione, as well.”
“What else do we need after this?” Daphne asks.
“Ah,” Lady Longbottom smiles almost fondly, “I do recall your mother saying the same about hers.” Hari’s heart practically stutters at that. He’s only ever been told stories about his father, except by Professor Snape, who shared memories like gold: rarely and with reverence.
“This is really a good thing, sweetie?” Hermione’s mom looks at her worriedly.
“And one of the lesser ones?”
Hari stands and straightens his robes, looking at Lord Macmillan out of the corner of his eye, “I think that everyone in here is human and just as capable of evil as the people not in this room.”
“She’ll become Minister,” Blaise waves his concern off, “and show us all up.”
“The new time schedule for our year was on the back of that. Within the Houses, students have the same schedule,” Hari explains. “It’s less work for the teachers that way.”
“Just to let you know that we’re going to go visit another property today,” Hari says, “so we’re going to leave now that we’ve finished lunch.”
“She was walking around yesterday without shoes and said ‘nargles’ took them, then explained nargles can be people. She also said most people call her ‘Loony’.”
“Two, quickly.” Draco demonstrates and Critter nods.
“Critter?”
“Critter will.”
Hari shrugs and takes another bite of cake. Somehow, he manages to clear his plate before the chime goes off for the third time that day.
“Draco, do me a favor and run into that shop there and ask them to send for the Aurors.” Draco nods and darts off.
“We’ll set something up,” Tonks agrees.
Blaise stares at him horrified for a long moment then starts to go on and on about how that’d be the worst idea in the history of time. The group lets him go and returns to their breakfasts.
“Eight,” Pansy corrects, “Us four, Theo, Millicent, Crabbe, and Goyle. And we had two tutors, plus Lady Malfoy for etiquette.”
The Ministry will have to select someone new to fill in her seat on the Wizengamot, as you cannot both hold a seat and be Chief Warlock at the same time. It makes Hari wonder about the logic of voting for other Lords and Ladies, unless you want them out of the voting pool.
“You ready?” Hari asks Hermione. He offers her the book. “My part is easy to remember.” She skims it over and then nods.
“I, Lord Hari James Potter, do hereby call Hermione Jean Granger into my House and protection,” Hari intones.
“Oh, well I’m sorry I didn’t bow to Your Highness,” she sneers at him.
“Oh, please, no formality with me,” Hari waves it off, “I view you as a friend.” Mr. Lazwell smiles gratefully and ushers Hermione to change into measuring garb.
“Right away,” the server nods, scuttling off.
“If you’re on time, you’re late,” Draco points out.
“Thank you for having us,” Hari replies.
“I see,” Professor Snape steps forward, looking them both over. “You seem unharmed.”
“I need a piece that can be worn at essentially all times,” Hari explains, “it’s going to be a port-key.”
“I see here you have detailed werewolves as being non-human. You are aware this is inaccurate, correct?”
“Yes,” Hari grins, and snaps twice, “because Critter has a surprise for you.”
“I’ve got plenty,” Pansy nods, “you can have as many as you need.”
“Well, I suppose?” Hari tips his head, “I have different personas I use in court. Like, one that’s cute and innocent. One that’s more bad boy and one that’s more nerdy. And one that’s sophisticated, like Lucius.”
“Then,” Lord Flint rises, “have a wonderful week.” They all rise and bow to Hari. Only Lucius remains behind.
In moments, the magical creature is taken down, pinned beneath his fangs and claws. He releases it and watches the magic within fix the toy so it can stand and go off to be a target once more.
, my mother, would protect me. Blood wards that require love to function and therefore, never existed.
“Don’t.”
“I’m really glad that was one of the things I managed to fix,” Hari admits, “I thought I was going to have to stagger meals, which I might have to later when I mix in different classes, but I haven’t decided yet.”
“This side is the sitting room and formal dining room,” Critter tells him, “The Potterses be using it when friendly guests be coming over.” The doors open directly to the sitting room and on the left side, there’s another set of open doors that show off a long table. Critter guides them to the other side of the entrance hall and opens the doors there, “this side be where the Lord or Lady be having parties and meetings.” The first room is a large, open ball room and, off to the side, like with the dining room, is a set of open doors showing off a smaller sitting area with more tables and lined with bookshelves.
“He did,” Draco confirms. “Sorry, I forgot to include that in the letter.”
Draco laughs, “you’ve got me there! The more you and I do together as a couple, the more they’ll want to be couples. They’ll get subconsciously more and more obvious about their affections until, bam! They’re together!”
“What?” Hari looks at her confused. “We’ll use all of it. Besides, do you really want to wander Diagon Alley in muggle clothes all the time? We come here a lot.”
Hari snorts and looks at Hermione, “got a CD player?” Hermione gestures to the side table and Hari skims through her CD collection until he finds one that suits their needs. In a moment, a soothing, slow waltz is playing. Pansy starts to step forward, but Blaise makes it there first.  With all of them helping, they manage to get Hermione successfully through a full dance.
“We did,” Daphne laughs. “We figured no one would mind if our friend ate with us.” Hari gives a sharp look to the other heirs in the room, daring them to argue with Hermione’s presence. They look away and say nothing.
Draco grumbles, but eventually says, “if Hari is fine with it, I’ll take it.”
Recalling what he had read in the Charter, he calls out, “Potter Family Suite,” and holds up his wand, lighting the tip with a Lumos. Technically, Professor Snape could show him to his Suite, but it is simply easier to call for it with his magic. It’s a few tapestries down from Professor Snape’s quarters. Hari makes his way there and reaches out. Magic is the only way to find the door—that, or being Head of House or Mediwitch. Hari will have to add his friends to the wards wrapped around the suite.
Hari blushes, then, too, and averts his eyes, drumming his fingers on his mug. Draco’s fingers suddenly trace over his cheek and Hari’s eyes shoot to his.
. Pettigrew finds himself unable to move.
“Oh, I like to get my work done earlier in the day,” Luna says, “but I could bring a book to read.”
“I’ve heard that before,” Hermione murmurs. “The losing the battle thing,” she explains. “I’ve read it in a book somewhere.”
“Of course,” Hari nods, “and I am only a thirteen year old boy entrusted with far too much political power to truly be logical.” Hari stares beseechingly at them. “I’m sorry for not requesting your permission. I acknowledge your place as her parents and view myself as more of a liaison between this world and yourselves.” He pauses, then adds jokingly, “and a bank.”
“Has there been an application for the Defense position?” Professor Flitwick asks.
“And would you have every student take this class, or only muggleborns?”
“I would argue that, given your size and general appearance, you’ll actually have a decent amount of time before you have to be concerned about that,” Professor Snape assures him.
“Right,” Draco nods, “legal problems.”
“You’re certainly welcome,” she replies magnanimously.
“What?” Hari asks, blinking innocently.
“Of course, Lord Potter,” the witch smiles brightly at him, “I will be sure to do so. I am Miss Evelyn Monroe.”
“There’s a test for that?” Both Hari and Hermione are staring curiously at Draco.
“We elveses can be doing that,” the elf promises.
“Over the course of three years, beginning with seventh and second years,” Hari says. “Because the current seventh years need to learn it, but students will be more prepared to accept it at a younger age. If we continued with this plan, the next year, it would be seventh and fourth. The last year would be seventh and sixth. After that, all current students would be caught up and the class would revert to being solely first years.”
“That sounds good,” Hari nods and they wander into the shop. Inside, it’s an emporium of books, almost as large as the Malfoy library.
The group stares at him for a long moment before they burst out laughing.
“No, that’s fine,” Hari waves it off, “I just wanted to make sure I wouldn’t have to port-key to my Manor and then floo over during the school year.”
“Is Master Hari having fun at the Ball?”
“Critter,” Hari rises and Critter appears in front of him.
“Yes,” Theo nods, “though I presume the other day wasn’t a one-off.”
“You’re incredibly confident, even though you’re so shy sometimes. The contradiction makes you so sweet, I can’t put it into words.” And Draco likes sweets, Hari knows.
“If he keeps bringing her to sessions, you mean,” Blaise clarifies.
This gives Hari pause. Yes, he’ll need to take either Hermione or Sirius, but he’d yet to decide who to bring first. Truthfully, he’s not certain it’s a good idea to take Sirius with him until the guardianship goes through.
“Burning the food or otherwise ‘damaging’ it was met with the punishment of burning my arms. Cheek or backtalk would earn some kind of blow to the head. Vernon used his fists, but Petunia favored her frying pan.” Hari detaches himself from the words he’s saying entirely. They come out mono-tone and bland. Daphne is turning pale, so he shifts his gaze to Blaise, who meets it readily, with his chin lifted and jaw set.
“That’s unlikely,” Draco huffs, “while goblin law would enforce a stricter punishment, wix usually prefer to try their own. And,” Draco glances at Hari briefly, “when they find out the victim and perpetrator, they’re unlikely to want to press charges anywhere else.”
“Oh,” she takes a few steps, “that actually feels a lot better.”
“I-I… of course he was included, he is a werewolf, and certainly not an outlier. Just look at the numbers!”
“Come on,” Daphne waves them over, “we’ve got to tell Hermione everything.”
On the floor—he practically chokes. One of the couples is two women. He glances at Draco and flicks his eyes over to draw his attention to the couple. Draco’s eyes widen, then he smiles softly and nods understandingly.
“Critter is being happy to be helping!” Critter’s ears wiggle excitedly. “Call Critter to clean up when you is being done, Master Hari.” Hari agrees and Critter pops away.
“Hence, none of them know how to grocery shop,” Hari says with a dramatic eye roll. “We’ve got to get to dinner, but I’ll see you the day after tomorrow. Could you arrive a bit early? I’m expecting quite a few people will stop us to talk.”
“We are,” Hari says and offers his hand to Hermione. “Make sure you can feel my ring,” he warns, setting his thumb over the center stone. Hermione shifts her hand, then nods at him. “Wizen Session,” Hari announces and the ring whisks them away.
“You like it, then?” Draco giggles as Ajay rubs their faces together, eyes closed and chuffing happily. He releases Draco after a moment and drops down, changing into Beau. “Beau wants a turn, too?” He lets out a high-pitched meow and darts into a tree, waiting for the prey he can catch to be released.
Griphook explains what occurred with Hari’s accounts and his parents’ will, revealing that the people who had abused him had illegal custody of him.
“No,” Daphne sweeps in behind them and pushes them towards the dinner buffet. “You are going to at least eat something healthy first. Preferably a meat and a carb.”
“Draco, you can bring Hari with you,” Lucius orders and apparates himself.
“So… you’re in my house because…” She twirls her wrist, gesturing for them to talk.
“Anytime.”
“Which property should we visit next?” Blaise asks over dessert. Hari twists his ring around his finger absently.
“Hari, I don’t think I can afford this,” she whispers in his ear.
“Crups have larger litters than kneazles,” Pansy explains.
“We’ll sign off on that, I believe,” Lucius announces and everyone around the table nods. Lucius makes a mark on the paper in front of him. “Next, let’s talk about who would teach a Wizarding Culture class and whether or not we have it in budget.”
“Thank you,” Hari smiles and Draco pulls him close for a long hug. Tension drains out of both of them. When they pull apart, grinning, something catches in the corner of Hari’s eye.
“Very well,” Lord Flint agrees. “We shall put it to a vote.” They take a moment to read over the paperwork Hari has presented, along with Andromeda’s proposed curriculum and plans. The vote passes the class and the hiring of Andromeda Tonks.
“Could you mark them in some way that isn’t permanent and doesn’t hurt them?”
“Hogwarts will also begin teaching Latin as a requirement for every grade level,” Hari lifts his chin, “the vast majority of our spell-work is based in Latin. It is a class that was required in the original Hogwarts Charter. We have also decided to add Healing, Dueling, Wandlore, and Advanced Spellcasting as electives beginning in year three. Professors are still being selected for these positions.”
“I usually just spend my days studying,” Hermione admits.
“You’re right,” Hari agrees after a moment, “you’re right. He’d have to walk here.”
“But why go out as a human if you have literally the perfect disguise?”
“I am Augusta,” she responds, “and this is Neville.”
This one is about Hari meeting with the Board of Governors. That's it.
“Alright, miss,” Mr. Lazwell helps her down, “you can change back. Would you like me to write down your measurements?”
“It’s my job to pay for her here,” Hari defends himself, “how would it look if I didn’t?”
“Maybe it will,” Daphne agrees. They sit in silence, watching the magical prey wander around them. “We should go back.”
“So, at least partially a Worldly Seer?”
“All those in favor of passing this bill.” The room is silent except for the sound of wands being tapped on arms of the seats.
“Dray, put me down.”
The magic causes his fur to stand on end and then he’s off like a shot, leaping along tree branches until he sees a bird just a few feet away that hasn’t noticed him yet. He prowls closer slowly, keeping low and quiet just as Minerva taught him. The bird ducks it’s head to preen and he takes it down, catapulting them both out of the tree. The bird lands heavily, but he makes it  onto all four paws and runs off the momentum in a circle, coming back around to sink his teeth into the bird’s neck and finish the kill.
“Thank you, Hari,” Hermione scoops him into a hug.
“Always,” Pansy groans, “and I’ve been dealing with her since Christmas.”
“There’s no reason for me to live! You’re taking the greatest gift from this world, Potter,” Draco warns, standing up on the armor’s shoulders. Suddenly, he’s lifted off it and set gently on the floor.
“And my mother,” Blaise agrees.
“And look, I am,” Hari smiles over his shoulder at Draco. “Now, if you let go, I’ll give you a hug.”
“As long as you’re not calling him frivolously, you should be fine.” Hari assures her, “if you miss dinner and don’t want to go hungry, want a book specifically from the Potter library, wake up in the middle of the night and need a drink, or things like that.”
“Then, I’m happy for you.” Remus gestures to a door, “this is where the conductor is.” He guides Hari through.
“Okay, how’s this?” Hari raises an eyebrow, “I tell the Board the new schedule doesn’t seem to be working as well as we’d hoped and we push it back an hour. To 8:45. Does that sound good?”
“That would be lovely, Critter, thank you.”
“Come on, let’s go eat, we can come back after dinner.”
“I am,” Hari confirms. “Lord Nott was kind enough to help me find you.”
This blog is from my Haikyuu fandom days. So nothing related to HP and I never use it.
“As is mine.” They stand next to the bed.
“Exactly,” Draco nods. They make their way through the buffet with lunch foods. Everything looks divine, even more-so than the food from Hogwarts. Hari glances to the dessert buffet.
Hari grins at his friend and slips into the room where the group is waiting. “Sorry, they were arguing over who should be Chief Warlock.”
Right, only Lords and Ladies have to be there for this part.
“Think of it as endurance training,” Professor Snape suggests and Hari laughs.
“I disagree,” Hari sighs, “if we choose someone biased, what’s to say they won’t change their mind? If we choose someone with a bias and encourage them to use it to benefit us and then they turn against us, they’ll have no problem using that bias for the other side.”
Hari grins at Draco, “I love it.”
“You have someone in mind,” Lucius says.
Time stalls.
“Well done, Lord Potter,” Lucius nods to him in the hall.
After studying, they’re sure to walk Luna all the way back to Ravenclaw Tower before moving back towards Gryffindor Tower.
“I… think I can do most of that. Definitely the sweets,” Hari taps his fingers on the back of her hand, “but we were supposed to be talking about you.” Adjusting to this new mindset would be difficult, but at least he knew his friends would be on his side.
“This is getting to be a bit more than a crush,” Daphne murmurs, wrapping an arm around him.
“Severus will not allow it,” Lucius assures him. “And as the changes have already been ratified by the Board, the professors cannot truly fight you on it.”
“How are we supposed to know when it’s safe to go home?” Daphne asks softly.
“Likewise, Lord Malfoy.” Hari continues on to the port-key room where he meets up with Hermione.
“It is, Mom. I want to be Minister of Magic someday. And I want to be friends with Hari. He’s pretty much handed me both on a silver platter.”
Professor Snape grimaces, “I’ve lost my edge.”
“Why would she?” Draco huffs, “she’s pretty much tied with me for top of our class.”
The speech doesn’t take its full allotted time, but then someone else steps up to fill the empty space. Apparently, the Wizengamot is picky about timing. In the end, they approve more money to be spent to support the study of cars. Hari finds it somewhat pointless given the advanced forms of travel wix have, but he can see why it would be beneficial for them to understand muggle technology, so he approves it.
A chime rolls through the Ministry and the group sighs. Hari eyes flicker longingly to the dessert table.
“Except for the tester,” Luna chimes in. Draco glances at her. “She was going to ask,” Luna shrugs. Draco makes quick eye contact with Blaise, Pansy, and Daphne.
“Sorry,” Hari says, “but at least it isn’t her speaking this afternoon.”
“They’re in the way!”
His wand vibrates in its holster and he gets up, walking briskly back to the meeting room. It’s time to face down the teachers.
“What? Why? No!” Draco grabs Hari’s shoulders. “Our team is finally winning!”
“I don’t think he could take the Knight Bus,” Daphne muses, “Stan probably wouldn’t let him on. He’d recognize him.” She pauses, “I hope. But as for floo, he’d have to start somewhere there was no people and come out somewhere without people. The second is nearly impossible to guarantee and in Hogsmeade, it essentially is impossible. There’s only two floos and they’re in pubs.”
“I truly believed it couldn’t get worse, but a few days after Christmas, I offered to help him. I am a certified Mind Healer. My skillset is unique. Hari allowed me into his mind, let me view the memories of what had happened to him. These atrocities were committed against a child out of hatred. The people he lived with didn’t just dislike him or fear him, they truly hated him. I didn’t understand then and I still don’t understand now how someone can hate a child.
“Sometime over the summer, we could come here to shop, instead of sticking with Diagon Alley.”
“It’s so people can’t tell which is which and steal your wand,” she explains. Hari grins at her.
“Do something cool again today. You’re dressed for it,” Blaise orders. “You look like a warrior.” Hari rolls his eyes with a fond grin and hurries off to his seat.
“I call to vote,” Lord Malfoy’s voice booms.
“They’re just huffy because you’re outside their control,” Blaise rolls his eyes. “The whole Ministry is made of control freaks and the Wizengamot defies that. Not that they can do anything about it.” The group, minus Hermione, snickers at that.
“It appears sound to me,” Hari says thoughtfully, “the evidence presented cannot be disputed. After all, multiple healers who did not previously have contact with each other agree on the injuries listed. I’m curious to see where they’ll go with this and who they’ll be pressing charges against.” If you have the power to make people consider your case with a single statement, why not use it?
“And you call me Daphne,” she orders. “What do you make of the goblin’s case?” Hari immediately catches on to what she’s doing.
“Okay, change back, we’ve gotta get down to business,” Draco snaps his fingers at Hari. Beau nips at them harshly before changing back and glaring.
“Indeed,” Hari nods, “I’ll see you later, Lady Zabini, Blaise.”
“And you, as well,” Hari and Lady Longbottom—Augusta reply. Hermione and Neville bow smoothly, leaving the words for their Heads of Houses.
“Okay.”
Hari reaches the exact center of the room and turns on his heels to face the Wizengamot instead of Dumbledore. He looks up at them, at the faces awash with awe. Nerves are the only thing keeping him together. He wants to look to Draco, but he’d have to turn his head. His eyes seek out Blaise instead and the boy gives him a subtle, but encouraging nod.
So--guess who's back? I'm sorry for vanishing like that. I've been getting my life in order--everyone who read that rant I posted knows what I'm referring to. You'll notice I pulled that down.
“Seconded,” Lord Bones rises.
Draco’s eyes go wide when he looks back and he darts over, wrapping Hari up in a hug. “Of course I don’t mean it, Hari,” he soothes, “I was just being mean and stupid and I’m sorry.”
Hari holds out his other hand, the one with the Slytherin ring, and calls out, “
Hermione already has those port-keys, both simple, chain bracelets.
“She was a Fate Seer, yes,” Luna offers a peaceful smile, “and, since you’re going to ask, I’ve not been tested myself.”
“Hello, Lord Potter.”
After Madam Bones’ speech, Hari is quite pleased with how it went. Glancing around, he can see some of the more moderate Lords and Ladies seeming impressed by her. Madam Bones is concise, polite, and decidedly neutral, even more-so than the two others with those tendencies.
“And when is the next session, again?” Daphne pokes at her pie curiously with her fork before taking a bite. She makes a surprised but pleased sound and chomps away happily.
“You’re going to have to pretend to be excited,” Blaise warns.
“Oh, sorry,” Hari turns to her. “We’re going to be invited to a Fall Festival Ball by Lord and Heir Nott.” Hermione looks somewhat confused, so Hari explains, “by Theo and his father.”
“Exactly,” Hari nods. “I feel she could easily transfer that to the position of Chief Warlock.”
“Yes,” she whispers back, “but why…” She trails off, following Hari’s line of sight. “Oh.”
“I welcome you and name you my cousin. Rise and bow to me no more. So mote it be.”
“Pleased to see you too, Lord Nott.” Hari turns slightly to gesture to Hermione, “Have you met Miss Hermione Granger?”
“I would call for a vote,” Lord Malfoy calls.
https://hunters-g1rl.tumblr.com/post/189784780232/its-very-very-small-text-im-sorry-for-my-fic
“Father did it on purpose,” Draco crows and relaxes in his seat. “Merlin, I was so angry with him for a moment.”
“That’s wise. Too many may end up confusing you.”
Their second song ends and they quickly sweep off the floor, making the rounds and catching Hermione again. After some food, a short, but warm speech from Lord Nott, and a lot more dancing, the Malfoys are getting ready to head out.
“Lord Malfoy,” Hari calls politely. Lucius turns and his lips quirk. He bows politely before addressing Hari.
“Are you ready to go, then?” Hari looks Draco over. His pale gray robes fit the bill, but his hair and make-up aren’t done yet and there’s no way Draco would ever leave the Manor, or for that matter, their suite looking like that. Draco glances into the mirror, winces, and fixes the two.
“I’ll be upstairs if you kids need anything,” Sirius tells them, then strides from the room, leaving them to sit, waiting.
“Always,” Hari chirps and changes back into Beau, darting over to scratch at the door. It opens and he races out, darting around the school with ease.
“Yes, please.” He waves his wand and then hands her a slip of parchment. “Thank you.”
“What are we going to do for the rest of the day?” Blaise asks.
Hari nods to the man who then proceeds to offer a bow to the Heirs. Draco has had his nose turned up since the first person bows and Blaise refuses to stop making fun of him for it. It’s a long ten more minutes before they find Hermione. She darts over as soon as she sees them and bows gracefully. She’s clearly practiced for this moment.
“Eat some, it’ll help reverse the effects,” Remus tells them, “I need to speak to the conductor.” Hari grabs a chocolate frog and takes a bite. Warmth spreads through him.
“Technically, but I don’t know if she really feels like she is. I’ll do my best to acclimate her,” Hari promises, “but I know it was hard for me adjusting to the fact that I have all this stuff. What made it easiest for me was that I had to accept it to keep myself and everyone else safe.”
“Do you know how to dance?” Daphne asks.
They both study her.
“My father voted someone similar up,” Daphne realizes. “Someone more extreme than he’d usually vote for.”
“I trust her,” Hari allows and they start walking back to the dorms. “And I know she’ll get both of them. I’m just concerned. If she signed off on this, I’ve just stepped on her toes.”
Pansy shoots Theo a look, “she is, isn’t she?” Her voice is kind of sharp and Hari realizes it’s the same look Draco has whenever Hari hugs someone else.
“Rash?” Hari feels his anger start to swell, but keeps his voice in the same monotone, eyes and posture steady and confident. “Do I look like I’m being rash to you? Rash was thinking it a good idea to send Dementors to a school. There’s children here, not criminals. You will remove them, or I will remove you from the general populace,
“The list for today?” Draco asks.
Professor Snape shakes his head, “Closer to the next trip. No sense discussing it now when things could change in the coming weeks.”
“It’s time for dinner! You said you’d be back for dinner!”
“No, Hari, no,” Daphne wraps her arms around him. “You don’t really get to choose who you fall in love with or which gender you prefer. So if you want to date Draco, you can date Draco. Have I ever lied to you?”
Ajay chuffs and butts his head against Draco’s hip. Ajay is more than ready. He prances slightly on his toes in anticipation. Draco opens the door and reveals the room has been transformed.
“Well,” Blaise corrects, “it’s not actually a court case. It’s a petition from the goblins to receive the right to arrest a wix and try them under goblin law.”
“I love how sweet you are,” Draco murmurs, “and so like a cat. They’re my favorite, you know.”
“In reference to what actually occurs in the classroom, I would like them to be more focused on the practical. Students should be studying the theory outside of class and practicing within class under supervision. This way, there is no temptation to be practicing spells outside of class where someone could get hurt. That is not to say no theory should be reviewed in class, but that it should be student-driven. Responding to questions they had on the reading, rather than lecturing. Is everyone amenable to this?”
“But the trace,” Hermione warns a second too late.
They leave the next morning at ten. Hari doesn’t know how long the paperwork will take him to fill out, but he’s certain it won’t be easy.
“I don’t know about voracious, but certainly normal for a teenage boy,” Hari allows.
“I am the King of Drama Queens,” Draco corrects him and sticks his nose in the air, “I could put Pansy to shame. But only if I wanted to.” And he flounces off to the suit section. Blaise and Hari share a glance, shake their heads, and trail along after him.
“Let’s do that,” Hermione agrees.
“I’m just going to go do my homework now,” Hari informs Professor Snape, “please tell my overly dramatic boyfriend that if he’d like to spend time with me ever again, he should stop throwing fits over doing homework.”
“Now, I know you two would never intentionally miss the carriages,” Professor Snape raises a brow at them, offering a chance to explain themselves.
“We’ll tell Pansy to bring Hermione,” Draco corrects immediately, “but I agree. She would love this place.”
“Moony!” Hari cries and leaps to his feet, opening the compartment.
“And why would it seem like that?” Professor Snape asks, leaning forward suddenly.
succeed.
“Do you have chocolate?”
“I did a little bit of research,” Hari tells them, “and I’ve found someone who has had a Ministry seat on the Wizengamot for a while, is a scion of a Noble House, and is known for neutrality.” They stare at him as if they’ve never heard of such a thing. “Madam Amelia Bones.”
“Ugh, don’t remind me,” Draco whines and leans in, kissing Hari deeply. Hari’s brain shorts for a (long) moment and then he remembers what they’re supposed to be doing.
“So,” Hari squirms a little, “what now?”
“And Hari’s wearing a freaking snake,” Blaise teases. Sure enough, Galeru is draped around Hari’s neck.
“Yeah, but this place is historic,” Hari argues, “and I don’t know the spells used to keep it like this or how they lasted for this long.”
“No,” Hari agrees, “no, I wouldn’t. You’re right, she’ll understand.”
“I will let the Board know at our next meeting. Now, is there anything anyone would like to discuss with me?” No one brings anything up, so Hari moves on. “I realize this is the part where you all usually discuss students. As a student myself, I don’t feel comfortable sitting in on this. I will step out. If you need me, Professor Snape will know where I am. And I request that any identifying factors be kept out of the information I am given.”
“Wonderful,” Hari smiles and stands. “I have to get to a meeting. Could one of you show me to the conference room?” The elves start to clamber over each other to be the one to go, when finally the spokeself claps his hands and stops them.
“If I’ve gotta go, you’re coming with me,” Hari says, tone slightly threatening.
“My feet feel like they’re going to fall off,” Hermione replies, wincing slightly. Hari’s eyes go wide.
Hermione bites her lip, “what are you doing?”
“I guess I can see not wanting to buy a home larger than strictly necessary,” Pansy muses, “if you don’t have generations of family money to justify the flashiness.”
Hari shakes his head, “no. I know I have to decide soon, but I’m not sure if it’s worth it to miss a day of school for this one.”
“Makes sense to me,” Draco says and settles into one of the desks that have appeared. The Room has designed a study area for them in a little circle, with all the desks touching corner to corner and facing each other.
“Which is why you went to talk to Daphne,” Draco guesses. “I figured. You seemed pretty shocked by the ladies.”
“Would you like the tour before or after dinner?”
“This place is actually really cool,” Pansy says, running her hand down the dining room table.
“You don’t truly believe that hint about the perpetrator being in this room is true, do you?”
“Dray,” Hari gives his friend a bland look, “It’s barely six.”
“We’ll have a sleepover,” Draco declares, pulling back, “we can sleep in my room.”
There’s the chocolate, from the treats and the drinks. The butterbeer from earlier. And some flavor that is entirely Draco and Hari knows if he ever tasted it again, even without seeing or feeling or smelling Draco, he would know it.
“Critter is being pleased Miss Hermione is liking her rooms.” He looks to Hari.
“Right? It tastes better than it looks,” Pansy gushes.
“Do.”
“Your outfit is perfect; color, fit, shape—everything. It’s perfect on you.
“We’ll have to bring Hermione next time.”
“I do not want to share you,” Draco whines. Hari laughs. Beau can make an appearance tomorrow. For now, they have a welcome-back speech from Professor Snape to hear. And, from the glint in the Professor’s eyes and his curling smirk, it’s going to be a good one.
“I know.”
“Oh, my goodness, Draco, you don’t. Deal with it,” Hari huffs and shoves Draco backwards onto the bed.
“The room is perfect, Critter,” Hari grins, “I love it.” Hari stands back up, “why don’t we go take a peek in my study.”
“Okay, that glance was panicked,” she turns to him, “what’s wrong?”
“Some are,” Luna agrees, “some are habits and ways of thinking. They’re fascinating creatures.”
“Hari?”
“Dray, school comes first. We’re thirteen. You know this.”
After an hour and a half of exploring, they settle into the sitting room.
“My godfather, Scion Sirius Black.”
“Hari!” Draco wails and throws himself onto the smaller boy. “I was just about to make Father go look for you.”
“Not y—no, I couldn’t.”
“Port-keys be working in the entrance hall,” Critter informs him. “Master Hari be coming back soon.”
Draco turns to Luna, eyeing her with curiosity.  “Luna? Your grandmother was a Seer, correct?”
“Meaning that much like Diagon Alley, there’s a part of Hogsmeade that has the types of stores my mother frequents,” Draco explains, “We’ll stick to that area. And Honeyduke’s, because apparently, they have the best sweets in the whole villiage.”
“I forgive you,” Hari replies. “I’m sorry for not telling you or having Critter tell you.”
“You can have more at dinner, Hari,” Draco promises and leads him away by the hand.
“Let’s go, then,” he smiles at Draco, “we’ll see you later.”
“It does,” Professor Sprout smiles at him, “thank you.”
“Don’t talk to me l—“
“Actually…” Draco winces.
“They’d be the first, wouldn’t they?” Daphne agrees, “since they’re not raised here and Hari’s already Lord, it wouldn’t be hard for them to just assume that’s normal. And maybe even assume that it’s so normal, no one’s talking about it.”
“We’ve gotta go,” Draco taps his toes at the group. “See you later, Lord Potter.”
“Thanks,” Hermione smiles, “Mum and Dad got it for me as an early birthday gift. It’s featherweight and bottomless.”
“That’s fine,” Hari agrees immediately, still grinning like a loon.
“We are,” Hari grins at her, “want to join us?”
“I, Lord Hari James Potter, as Earl of Gryffindor and Duke of Slytherin, hereby claim my rightful position as Heir to Hogwarts. So mote it be.” Four magics swirl around him, red, green, blue, and yellow. The chairs of each Hogwarts founder glow brightly for an instant, than everything fades.
Professor Snape does not look pleased, but at the same time, he doesn’t look displeased. Perhaps the visits he’s had with Moony have helped them come to somewhat of an understanding. Though, Hari’s still not entirely certain what the initial dislike was over.
Hari bursts out laughing, “that sounds about right.”
Back at the Manor, Hari takes a second to talk to Lucius.
“Luna Lovegood.”
“And I get to bring Galeru without waiting for him to fully become my familiar!”
“Dray.”
“Yes, well, I did say I might need a rescue if I wasn’t back sometime during the dinner hours,” Hari admits.
“Okay, you win that one.” They find their seats with the others. “At least my stomach can handle all this food now.”
Let me know what you think!
“Would it not be possible to have first years study this year and implement the government class now, with the other six grades taking the class over the summer?”
“Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Granger,” Hari bows gracefully to Hermione’s parents. They raise their eyebrows at him. Hermione whispers something discreetly to them.
Draco strokes his fingers through Hari’s hair and feels the soft rumble of Hari’s purr. Somehow, that being the hanger-on from his animagus transformation simply makes Hari all the cuter.
“I just thought it’d be interesting to get a wix perspective on all things muggle!”
“And your obstacles crumbled,” Hari rises and bows in unison with his friends. Theo has caught on to the process, as has Lord Malfoy and the others’ parents. Everyone else looks on confused.
“I just…” he flicks a subtle gesture to the dance floor, “I wasn’t prepared for that. I know you said that it’s okay, but seeing it changed something.”
“Why didn’t you tell me you were in pain?”
“Master Hari has brought Mister Draco!”
“Good,” Hari nods shortly, “I can’t wait.” Hari enters the Common Room, where some of the older years are already wondering aloud if the cute kitten from last year will be back. He smirks up at Draco.
They tear through their food and Hari makes his way down to the floo room five minutes early.
“Meaning?”
“Just think,” Daphne smiles, “we make it through the speeches, and they can’t re-hire Dumbledore.”
“He’s already part of the Wizengamot, Dad. He has six titles.” Hari winces slightly and looks sheepish. “He’s the most powerful singular wizard on the Wizengamot, and that’s without allies.”
So here's the thing:
“No,” Hari shakes his head, “The time constraint is now an hour per class. The varying timeframes and schedules were difficult to follow and keep track of.” Hari leans forward, “I’ll let you in on a secret: we’re children, we like routines. Knowing what to expect is good for students.
“Just get dressed!”
“Weeks will go on an A or B schedule. I would like this to be posted somewhere, such as the Great Hall, so that students and professors alike can keep track of what classes they will be having that week. The schedules work like this: A week might have Transfiguration on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Therefore, on B week, Transfiguration would be Tuesday and Thursday. These weeks will alternate so as to distribute classes evenly.
For this chapter, we go back to school. It's book three, guys, what do you think happens on the train? Featuring BAMF Hari.
“I think I’ve been here before,” Draco hums, “but we came through floo, so I didn’t recognize it from the outside.”
“How about they take it during the year and have the first years study over the summer?”
“Alright, then how about between lunch and tea time, every other day excluding session days.”
“Would you bring some snacks up to my spot in the library?” Hari asks, looking up at Critter, “small finger foods that won’t make a mess and maybe some hot chocolate.”
“It’s perfect, Draco, and so beautiful.”
“Ah,” Lucius’ eyes gleam, “thank you, Lord Nott.”
“You as well, Lord Potter.”
“Don’t mumble,” Draco chastises, “but that’s really cute.” He goes right back to petting Hari and Hari falls asleep still purring.
Thank you for your patience. It was... really strange realizing I couldn't even remember writing one of my most popular works. Really, thank you for understanding that I cannot pick up where I left off. It literally feels like reading a stranger's writing.
“The applicant is Mr. Remus Lupin, a close friend of my father and my godfather.”
“You,” Hari says without hesitation, “I’ll be here often enough over the school year, there will be plenty of opportunities for me to eat with them.”
“It’s great to meet you, then,” Hari smiles at her brightly. “We’ll have to meet for tea sometime. You can contact me through Gringotts.”
“Mr. Potter,” Professor Sinistra sniffs at him. “What are you doing in a staff meeting?”
“No,” Draco shakes his head, “she’ll understand. Her niece goes here, remember? Would you want Dementors near anyone in your family?”
“What a load of hogwash,” the toad in pink is crying as she shoves past him, “just because the brat can’t take any discipline.”
“Surro—oh, no, we wouldn’t need that. Magic,” Draco waggles his eyebrows, “is spectacular.”
“You looked just like him,” Blaise snickers. “That was a classic Malfoy smirk.”
“But the dessert is the best,” Daphne adds.
“Maybe you could try showing you like him, too? I mean, you already do some of that subconsciously, letting him cuddle you more and such, but maybe initiate?”
“You all have family money and titles to inherit,” Hari points out, “Hermione’s just a normal girl who’s good at school.”
“Exactly,” Hari grins wickedly.
Chugging right along. Plot. Plot. Fluff. (Okay, it might be moreso fluff fluff plot, but sue me.)
Two Aurors stalk over, Draco on their heels.
“Now, we remove all Heirs and myself from the stack,” Hari adds. “We have our Family Suites.” The stack separates again, withdrawing a much smaller amount. He looks, somewhat dismayed at the large pile, “Can you search it by magic for the word ‘Scion’?”
“Except that the furniture is a pale wood instead of a dark one,” Blaise agrees.
“Sorry,” Hari flicks his wrist and the curse is gone. In moments, the first Auror has Pettigrew in shackles.
“Don’t thank me,” Hari shakes his head, “it’s the least I could do.”
“The Potterses used to use the crups to go hunting,” Critter says as crups race to them. “And the kneazles were sold as familiars.” Hari looks around and, sure enough, there’s kneazles along the perimeter of the garden. “We have lots of kneazles now. Many to be sold.”
“If we do it somewhat regularly, he’ll end up telling us something someday,” Blaise agrees, “and probably sooner, rather than later.”
“Hello, dears,” Narcissa smiles at them and quickly casts the charm to allow Harry to see without glasses. “Are you both ready?”
Critter marks the crups as well, then leads Hari past the building at the back of the garden.
“Are you going to spend time with me?”
“It was,” Hari agrees, “I’m sure those books generate a lot of income for her, too.”
“I don’t want to,” Draco murmurs, “but we need sleep.”
“No. You might know the location for yourself, but you wouldn’t be able to share it.”
“Draco,” Hari warns, “I’m not tiny.”
“And you’re amazing,” Hari responds breathlessly.
“Are those Dementors?”
“Let’s walk the grounds,” Hari suggests.
“That’s still cool,” Hari insists. Draco shrugs uncomfortably, so the group drops the topic.
“Lord Malfoy, actually. He’s my ticket home,” Hari smiles cheekily and Lord Nott chuckles at him.
“All those in favor of discarding this bill.” The tapping is louder now and Hari knows they have won this round. Of course, he didn’t have any doubt originally, but this only confirms it.
“As I would expect,” Hermione says rationally, “though I am surprised he didn’t tell you.”
“Well, he does get down on himself quite a bit,” Draco mutters. “It’s likely that these nargles are how she sees the negatives in life.”
“Lord Potter, you seem to have put a lot of thought into this,” Professor McGonagall smiles at him. “Your ideas are sound and I am most certainly pleased with the new teaching arrangements.” If only because it offers more free time.
“Of course, sweetie,” Narcissa smiles sweetly.
“I know this is hard and difficult to process,” she murmurs, “and you have to override years of experiences, but please, do yourself a favor, and ask Draco to dance. Or indicate you’d like him to ask you.”
The others study him, then nod.
“Here, Beau,” a sixth year girl holds a treat in front of him, “sorry for laughing.” He takes the treat with delicate precision, gobbles it down quickly, then stands up, front paws in her hand and mews at her. She melts and strokes his head gently.
That kiss.
“We’ll start now. Just the basics,” Pansy declares and steps up. “Hari, can you give us some music?”
“Dangerous enough that the commonly accepted ‘most dangerous wizard of the era’ was frightened of him,” Sirius deadpans.
“Meanie.”
“When truly needed,” Hari agrees, “and only then. I’d rather they go to their Head of House if possible.”
Hari nods, “Andromeda Tonks. She was part of the House of Black and rescinded the title to marry her husband. She has a unique view of our culture and traditions and will be understanding towards muggleborns because of her husband.”
“Draco, get down.”
“Oh, that’s wonderful,” Hari’s eyes go wide. Having that for school… He’d never have to stop back at the room to switch books.
Yes, Draco decides, they can tell the others on the train, when everyone’s together and in person. When he can give Hari a little kiss on the cheek as he tells the others and watch him blush preciously and lean into Draco’s shoulder.
None of the other Ministry members will be voted into the top ten. That’s a given. When it comes down to it, the Ministry will vote for one of its own. That will let Hari maintain his lead.
“I thought of that, but I figured her sense of morality would outweigh her loyalty to them,” Hari smirks, “and if it doesn’t, I’ll just vote against the Ministry.”
“That…” Lucius looks at him thoughtfully, “might just work. Hogwarts is capable of expanding the dormitories as needed as it has built-in extension charms.”
“Okay,” Hari extends a hand to her, “let’s go in.” Luna stares for a moment, confused, then accepts the offer of help up and follows Hari and Hermione into the room. “Welcome to the Room of Requirement,” Hari grins at her. She smiles, somewhat more brightly, in return, bobbing her head in thanks.
“Master Hari!” Critter notices Hermione, “Oh, and Miss Hermione! Yous is being here for dinner?”
“It makes sense to me,” Pansy declares, “if she won’t take our side, at least we know she won’t take theirs.”
“Well, I’m off.” They all wave to him, still chowing down on the delicious treats. Hari rolls his eyes at them and hurries off.
Hari reaches the entrance to the Slytherin dorms and studies the hall. Professor Snape’s quarters are directly across from the common room. Given there are no classrooms on that side in this hall, Hari assumes their suites will be there somewhere.
He pushes open the door and steps in to find a sitting room with a small dining area off to one side. There’s three doors, as with the suites in the Potter Manor. One is a bathroom, another a bedroom, and the last a small study space. Hari makes his way through each room, smiling to himself at the luxury within. This, he knows, is why Dumbledore removed it. The luxury would ‘make other students feel lower.’ It’s not about who’s lower and who’s higher. It’s about safety and comfort. The dorms themselves are incredibly nice. But, Hari isn’t afraid to admit, as he jumps onto the soft, animal-fur blankets, the luxury definitely is worth it.
“One from Slytherin?” Daphne suggests. “Or Peverell?” Hari looks up with a grin.
“I call the victim to the floor.” Master Tomeaxe neglects to address Hari by name and it makes his hands tremble. This, here, is the moment of truth. Will his Wizengamot sessions ever be normal? Hari closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, catches Draco’s eyes for just a moment, then rises. His steps are slow and measured and he ignores the whispering, focusing entirely on Narcissa’s steady gaze. When he reaches the floor, she nods slightly and he turns around. The whispering has faded, but the look on Dumbledore’s face is what really drives out his nerves.
“I was tested as a kid,” he mutters. “I had some… tendencies my parents were concerned about. It turned out to be so minor, it doesn’t even matter.”
“For the time being, I have opted to keep this victim’s name private, so as to prevent biases from influencing your reactions. For now, all evidence provided will have the victim’s name stricken from it. This will continue until the victim themselves comes up to speak.” He looks to Dumbledore to ensure this is acceptable. Dumbledore nods his permission. “For the most part, witnesses will be called in the order in which they discovered the crimes. However, as several witnesses, the ones who uncovered the crimes, would give away the identity of the victim, they will be called last. I will now call the first witness to speak. I call Potions Master Severus Snape to the floor.” Snape rises and strides down to the floor, standing tall and ready to speak. “We will allow questions after his statement is complete.”
“Don’t.”
“Please,” Hari nods. Critter takes them up, explaining that it doesn’t matter which stairway they take since they connect at the top. To the right is the East wing and to the left is the West wing.
“But…”
“I arrive, my Lord,” Hermione bows over their hands.
“At this time, we will vote for our top ten,” Fudge announces. Hari groans internally. This could be bad for him. He hadn’t considered that the voting would go like this. No—Lucius hadn’t informed him it would be tiered. Glancing at his friends, he can see them peeking at him nervously. It seems they hadn’t known either. Hari makes sure to keep his mask on and tip his head reassuringly.
“Lord Potter, you’ll need to remove the curse before we can take him in,” the other Auror says. She’s shorter and trips over herself as she bows. Her hair is streaked with bright pink.
“Or we could go check out some of my properties,” Hari adds. They’d all seen and transformed Potter Cottage into Moony’s ideal living space, but had yet to have the chance to visit anywhere else.
“Well, there’s all the Potter properties,” Draco takes in Hari’s nervous movements, “or we could go to one from a different House.”
“Very well.” They move on to debating History of Magic teachers and end up selecting someone distantly related to the House of Nott who has dedicated their life to studying magical history.
“Dray,” Hari whines and rolls so they’re as closely cuddled as he can get, “I’m sorry. I promise, I’ll make sure you either know or are coming with me next time.”
Oh, they’re going to flip when they find out Hari and Draco had been keeping this from them for a week, but how do you not explain in person? Their relationship is deeper than that, isn’t it? Deeper than just saying, ‘we’re dating,’ over floo?
“But… I want to tell you all that, too,” Hari practically whines.
“That works for me,” Draco agrees quickly.
“They’ll be just as early as we are,” Draco assures him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s different,” Hari says, “it’s more of a safety piece. You get the information you might’ve gotten in Care, without direct interaction with any creatures. It’s just: this is what’s dangerous and this is how to protect yourself from it. And now, Defense can be primarily focused on spells, creatures, and what Beasts doesn’t cover.”
“You all are aware Hogwarts has elves, correct?”
“You did very well today, Lord Potter,” Lord Nott tells him. “It was quite impressive.” The man bows and Hari accepts it with the expected nod.
“Lord Potter, welcome,” Lord Nott bows politely, gesturing into the large Manor.
Draco smiles at him.
“Come,” he leads her to the Longbottoms, “let’s speak with them.”
“Dray, we made out for fifteen minutes straight in the middle of homework time yesterday,” Hari rolls his eyes, “and that’s not counting what we did before breakfast, during lunch, and during dinner.”
“There you two are,” she sets a hand on Hermione’s shoulder, “we’ll go up to the gallery to find some seats. You’ll make it to yours alright?”
“Yes, thank you…” Mr. Granger lets the sentence trail off awkwardly.
“That’s fair,” Blaise nods. “Let’s check out the upstairs.”
She hums and, after a beat, nods her understanding. “Let’s open your presents, now.”
When the last class of the day is over, Hari hops up and excuses himself, racing off to catch the others before they get to the room. He snags Draco out of the group and pulls him into an alcove.
“If you select the design and fabrics you would like, I can have them prepared for fine-tuning the next time you come in,” Mr. Lazwell says and points him to a booklet on the counter.
“Well,” Hari sighs and leans back, “so long as it doesn’t seem like nepotism.”
Hari crawls up first, snuggling back against some of the pillows piled up and curling a blanket around his shoulders. Draco takes a seat across from him, leaving the tray between them. It takes a moment of hesitation, but Hari reaches out and tugs the little rope that will cause the curtains to fall shut. As soon as it does, there’s no other light entering the area except the moonlight from outside, painting the area in a soft white glow with patches of rich color.
As for this chapter, let's pay a visit to one of the Potter properties. Because why not?
“I would love that,” Hari practically breathes, “I’ll send you an owl, sometime, and we can have tea.”
“I take it the rooms on this floor are all essentially the same?”
“We elveses be liking that,” the spokeself assures Hari.
“Or give him sweets and things like that,” Daphne’s lips curl, “let him catch you watching him a few times. Smile at him just because he’s looking at you. That kind of thing.”
“I belong in my Wizengamot seat more.”
Draco enters the room a minute later, perfectly put together and Prince mask perfectly in place. He sits in his desk next to Hari and calmly draws out his books. Hari glances at Pansy and shoots her a grateful smile.
“Sorry to call you away from your preparations,” Hari apologizes and takes a seat in front of them, “but there’s a few things I wanted to talk to you about.”
“Alright,” Blaise stands, “let’s bid our host farewell.”
“Alright,” Hari nods.
“I call for the doors to be sealed and this session of the Wizengamot on the third of August to begin,” Dumbledore intones and the doors close. His eyes scan the waiting witnesses and goblins in the gallery. Madam Pomfrey, Professor Snape, Professor McGonagall, Healer Ripclaw, Bill Weasley, Griphook, and several goblins he doesn’t recognize. “The first piece on our agenda is an inquiry from the goblins. I call Goblin Solicitor Tomeaxe to the floor.”
“We are!” He flops down next to Draco and leans into him. Draco’s arms automatically wrap around him and he finds himself pulled directly onto Draco’s lap. Hari snuggles in further and sends a quick smile at Daphne.
“I am quite certain it was not your fault, Lord Potter.”
“Critter be showing Miss Hermione the surprise?” Critter asks, rubbing his hands together happily.
“Of course. If you ever need something clarified, I’d be more than willing to answer your questions,” Hari nods, giving the slightest smile and taking his seat again. He glances over to Lucius and Draco. Lucius is ‘coughing’ into his hand and Draco is turning pink and shaking from the effort of holding in his laughter.
Laughter reigns in the room once more.
“I collected the student in such a way that their friends were not implicated and took them to have a medical exam performed by Madam Pomfrey, the Hogwarts mediwitch. I will leave it to her to explain the medical aspect of all this, but suffice to say, the victim’s injuries were numerous and even consuming small amounts of food could have caused them to become gravely ill.
“With that outfit, how could you lose?” Draco adds in a low tone.
“Certainly,” Narcissa nods sharply. “I wasn’t truly pleased you would choose to stay there alone, darling,” she tells Hari. “I’m glad you’ll be taking Draco with you.”
“I’m going to go run around the Jungle Room for a bit,” Hari jumps up, “I’ll be back soon.” They wave him off and keep giggling to themselves. Hari rolls his eyes and strolls out.
“I can understand why,” Hermione grumbles, not looking too pleased about having to go, either.
“Seconded,” says Lady Zabini.
“That wasn’t in my lessons,” Hermione starts to fret.
“Let’s,” Hari agrees. Daphne passes over her gift. It’s a bracer designed to look almost exactly like Hari’s wand holster.
“Some blood-purity guy,” Draco groans. “I thought we were past that. Honestly, I thought he never even believed in it.”
“So I shouldn’t be calling him?”
“Very well, Lord Potter,” Professor Sprout agrees. “We will send for you if necessary.” Hari nods and slips out of the room. Once through, he shifts into Ajay and takes off, running for the Room of Requirement, where he can play.
“Thanks,” Hari grins back. “Will you want to come for dinner or go home?”
“You know,” she says when they’re getting close to Mr. Lazwell’s, “I just realized I’ll have to tell my parents I essentially got magically adopted. Without their permission.”
“We have a good reason,” Draco defends. “Hari, be a dear and clean us all off, please.” Hari rolls his eyes, but casts quick cleansing charms on each of them with his still trace-free wand.
“Elveses are listening,” an elf steps forward, blinking up at him.
“Quite understanding of them,” Professor Snape’s lips curl slightly, “I do not know if I could be quite so kind were I your friend.”
Minister Fudge calls for the nominations to be put forward and over fifty different names are submitted. Some members put forward repeats of others’ suggestions, but no names garnered more than two nominations. Hari leans back in his seat. As long as there is no major upset, he’ll be able to get Madam Bones as Chief Warlock with his vote alone. Even the Ministry is split on the subject.
“Don’t care.”
They start to walk, when Hari pulls Draco back a little.
Hari flinches away from this news and Draco rubs his back soothingly. Hari tucks his face into Draco’s neck to take a moment to just breathe. When he pops back up, he feels significantly better.
“If we’re talking about relationships, can I ask about Draco?”
“Then… How
“Okay, but who goes?” Draco asks.
“Quite right, Mr. Potter,” Professor McGonagall nods, smiling supportively despite the incorrect honorific.
“Books next,” Blaise decides. Hari checks his list—he’ll be taking Healing, Dueling, Wandlore, Advanced Spellcasting, Arithmancy, and Runes, although he might end up dropping Arithmancy. He never really was one for math.
“He had that last year,” someone else calls. “Got it after being here a few days.”
“Mom, Dad,” Hermione looks up at them, “he got me political lessons and his friend’s mom sent me that handwriting book. Because of him, I can go see Wizengamot sessions. That’s the governing body,” she explains hurriedly, then continues, “He’s also going to connect our house to the floo so I can see all my school friends without disturbing you.”
“Draco, if you would kindly not mess up my robes, that’d be appreciated,” Hari says dryly. “You’re running ten minutes ahead. It’s only school shopping.”
“That’s fine,” Hari promises. “I just want to ask which kneazles are alright with being sold and which aren’t.” He looks around at the nervous cat-like creatures around him. “I’d like to see that you get taken to homes where you can receive love and attention. I can’t offer you that here. Those of you who are willing to leave Potter Manor to live with another wix, please stay. Those of you who aren’t, you may go.”
“That’s right!” Hermione perks up, “there’s several generals who’ve said that because it is a pretty solid strategy if used correctly.”
“According to Dumbledore,” Hari corrects. “According to the elves, they’re bored as they are now and would be grateful to have Filch removed so they can properly do their jobs.”
“Essentially. It’s more like, they own a house that suits their needs,” Hari explains, tilting his head. “Her whole family is very pragmatic, apparently, so while their house is on the big end, it’s not so large that they have unused space.”
“Master Hari is moving in?” Critter chirps, looking up hopefully.
“As you wish,” Draco smiles and leans in.
“I will not. You can even hold my hand for good measure.”
spoke to me about this.” Hari growls and that’s the moment they discover that it’s not just purring that carries over from his animagus form, but the voice boxes entirely.
“So,” Hari turns back to Hermione, “do you really want to stay the night?”
“What? Do you expect me to cry out for my Uncle Wormtail and jump into your arms?” Draco’s lip curls at Hari’s words, too. Pettigrew looks shocked and upset, almost remorseful. “Don’t make me laugh. You’re the one who betrayed my parents.” Hari flicks his wand into his hand and silently casts
“No,” Draco shakes his head firmly, “typically, the only people who do are muggleborns themselves. And that’s because that’s what they grew up with. But we start Hogwarts young and they almost always assimilate well. If they don’t, well, then they return to the muggle world where they don’t have to see it. There’s too many same-sex couples here to not see at least one daily, if you’re out and about.”
True to form, they spend over an hour picking their books. The fiction section alone has thousands of options and with magically expanded bookshelves, Hari’s sure there’d be more if he lifted a book off. His fingers skim along the spines until he settles on one that’s got a fair amount of fantasy with a touch of action—something like the wix version of Narnia. He takes his chance to pay, then leans against a pillar and watches while Draco finishes making his selection. Draco pays and walks over.
Hermione gets down on one knee in front of Hari and they clasp wrists.
Hari sighs, “yeah, well, it means I get carried around, so I’d be fine if you were a little less of a spoiled brat.”
“Sorry,” Draco laughs. “Come on,” he holds a hand out to Hari, “let’s go.” To Draco, the chat feels long overdue, but to Hari, who’s only just becoming aware of the depths of his feelings for Draco, it seems almost rushed. He sets his hand in Draco’s and lets the taller boy lead him into the library.
. A series of several, very small, almost-mandala circles connected with dots extending from the very tip of her middle finger down the back of her hand. The final piece is what looks like a large mandala that’s been quartered, so only one portion is visible, arching over her wrist. Hari listens absently to the conversations around him.
“Stay here tonight,” Hari murmurs shyly.
“I was, but not in a bad way? Just surprised, honestly.”
“It went well enough,” Hari says, “but it was hard to do. And Dumbledore escaped. This place is still under Fidelius, isn’t it?”
The world swirls around them for an instant and then they’re to safety.
“Is there treacle tart up there?” Hari asks when he’s finished his plate.
“Right, but my point is that she might have been uncomfortable touring these and knowing that I technically own them all by birthright,” Hari says, “I don’t think she would have said it outright, but she might have felt inadequate. I’m actually concerned she already does.”
“I’d like to know where you learned that,” Lucius raises an eyebrow, “it wasn’t in the charter.”
“Alright then,” Professor Snape picks him up, “perhaps he can help me teach.” He settles Beau on his shoulder and crosses to his blackboard. With a swish of his wand, the chalk begins to write.
“Hari’s the reason we’ll all be referred to by title again,” Draco adds, “and we get our Family Suites.”
“Nope,” Draco pops the ‘p’, “you’re all set. Hey, did you finish picking out colors?”
“Is she wearing shoes?” Blaise asks. Hari’s eyes narrow.
“Perfect,” she slips it over her head. Hari holds his hand out to her.
“As the only other member of his House, you’ll be expected to go to events with him,” Daphne says. “Usually, Houses have dozens of members, so no one has to go to too many events. But the burden falls solely on you and Mr. Black right now.”
“No,” Daphne agrees, “but we’re doing all the homework for Monday and Tuesday on Saturday. Don’t get too excited.”
“We’ve got some time before dinner,” Blaise announces, setting down his cup. “Shall we go ruin our meal with copious amounts of ice cream?” His grin is cheeky and they all immediately jump up.
His eyes seek out Draco next, finding the boy already staring at him. Draco’s smile is a little more obvious than his mother’s, but what can you expect from a thirteen year old boy looking at his best friend? Hari smiles back, then faces forward. The meeting is beginning.
“Good morning, Hermione,” Hari smiles and holds out the necklace he’d found her, “this is a port-key to your house.”
“I think they’ll take from another table if they have to,” Draco snickers. “They’ll be desperate to do well and keep us coming here.”
“That’s true,” Hermione agrees, “Neville is kind, if a bit nervous.”
“Please do,” Daphne pleads, “I don’t like flooing. It gets my robes dirty and makes me slightly nauseous.”
“You’re incredible, Hari,” Draco whispers.
“Good observational skills, Dray,” Hari mutters sarcastically.
There’s a pause as the Board thinks this plan over.
“Right, who did you end up suggesting?” Blaise asks. “We’re not allowed to nominate anyone and we don’t get to vote on anything, so no one’s telling us anything.”
Hari’s birthday is almost over.
The town comes into view once they pass through the Hogwarts gates. Hari sits up, trying to take it all in.
Draco doesn’t seem to have a response to that, so he just huffs and hands over his measurements to the worker. Once delivery is arranged, they leave to collect potions ingredients.
Hari realizes then why Draco assumes the two shops he wants to visit will take all afternoon. They’re both horribly slow at picking new books.
Sorry again! Let me know your thoughts on the correct chapter :P
“So, Lord Potter,” Minister Fudge catches him before he can get inside the chambers. Hari holds his sigh inside and turns to face the man. “I hear you are submitting a nomination for Chief Warlock.”
“Terrible,” Blaise says teasingly, “everyone’s going to be upset about a thirteen year old forgetting to pay for his friend.”
