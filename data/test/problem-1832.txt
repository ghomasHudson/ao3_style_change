Harry eventually nodded in agreement. He wasn’t convinced he needed a mind healer, but he supposed it wouldn’t hurt to read some of the material Hermione had given him. McGonagall looked at him so intently as she tried to gauge his sincerity that Harry would have worried about legimency if it had been Dumbledore or Snape.
“It’s not foolish. I think it’s quite normal, actually,” Harry responded. He recalled how sad Sirius looked when he spoke about his brother. Even Harry understood it on a personal level. He didn’t like the Dursleys any more than they liked him. Still, he’d spent his pre-Hogwarts years trying to be better so that they’d love him. Even now, there’s some small part of him that wondered what would happen if he brought James to visit them. It’d be a disaster, but part of Harry hoped Dudley had grown up enough to treat James better than he’d ever treated Harry. He won’t risk it, but every so often Harry wondered what it would be like to invite the Dursleys back into his life.
Harry was completely lost. He wasn’t holding anything. He watched the dementor helplessly. A particularly pitiful groan from one of the cells eventually broke Harry from his staring contest with the dementor.
“I know, Hermione. You don’t have to say it. I’m being irresponsible. I can’t get drunk when I have a child relying on me. I know I fucked up,” Harry said.
Harry didn’t explain that he’d initially projected the Dursleys on to his interpretation of the Malfoys. While there were similarities, Harry knew they were not the same. Suggesting they were, especially after Lucius had seen some of Harry’s memories of them, would be a huge insult. If Harry had any lingering doubts about the similarities between the two, it was squashed by Lucius’ reactions to the memories he saw.
As the days went by, Harry had to wonder if Dumbledore had been wrong about the side effects. Harry didn’t feel different. Not really. He still cared about Hermione and felt guilty for how he contributed to her problems. He was still hurt and angry that Ron left, but prayed he was okay wherever he ended up. He was disgusted with himself for everything he did to create a horcrux. Unlike Voldemort, he had no desire to create another one. Harry would have worried that it didn’t work, except he’d felt the pain of cutting out a piece of his soul and placing it outside of his body. Every time he looked at his mother’s ring, he just
“Come on now,” Burke spoke over him. There was clear anger in his voice now and his grip on Harry’s arm was bruising. A sharp tug pulled Harry forward and he stumbled.
Perhaps because he’d used Crabbe’s gift as the inspiration for Neville’s, Harry immediately considered the brush and mirror he’d made for Lucius. It felt uninspired to create the same gift, but Harry hoped that like with Neville’s gift, he would figure out a way to make it something unique as he went. He started by changing the design. It would have been a little embarrassing to use a dragon motif. He didn’t think Draco would immediately jump to the conclusion that Harry had a crush, but Harry had gotten used to Mulciber’s teasing that it felt like too big of a statement. Still, Harry thought Draco would appreciate some significant design, so he fashioned the handle of the mirror with peacocks.
“Good,” Theo responded. Harry blinked in surprise. He wasn’t sure why that would be good, unless Theo was interested in Ginny. If that was the case, then Harry worried it would set back all progress Theo had made with Ron if the redhead figured out Theo was interested in Ginny.
the bad guy? Playing innocent and helpless but you’re nothing but a filthy dog,” Burke spat and punctuated his point by backhanding Harry again. The force of it brought tears to Harry’s eyes.
Harry looked at Lucius in shock. He didn’t know what Draco was writing in his letters home to make Lucius come to this conclusion. Harry wanted to believe it would be as simple as asking Draco. He didn’t think Lucius was setting him up for failure, but it was hard to wrap his head around the idea that Draco might like him back.
Harry didn’t look at any of the other prisoners as he made his way down the hallway. He just wanted to lie down, hopefully sleep, and pretend that nothing had happened.
“Nonsense,” Draco replied, but he picked up James and gave him a hug. Draco continued to send worried looks towards Harry, but he wasn’t mad. Seeing the two of them together just made him want what he couldn’t have. It seemed he and James shared the same fantasy.
Figuring the best place to start was at the beginning, the others told Harry of the chaos in the great hall right after the aurors had taken Harry away.
“I don’t know how to do this. The Dursleys only showed me how to fuck up a child. I have no clue how to raise a well-adjusted one,” Harry said. Dudley might have grown up knowing he was loved, but he was far from a healthy and functioning member of society.
“What?” he asked blankly. The entire hall was so silent that Harry heard his own heartbeat. It was pounding in his chest.
This time, instead of a solitary figure gliding past the cells, there were three of them. Harry could not tell one from the other, so he didn’t know which, if any, had been the one from last night. All three had stopped at his cell door and turned towards him.
“I wanted to come back. I was given the choice, and decided to come back. Do you think that’s why – when I chose to come back the universe, or whatever, tried to do it by having my soul be reborn?” Harry questioned aloud. He continued before Draco had a chance to answer. “No, that doesn’t make sense. Ginny would have already been pregnant... and I returned to my original body. Eventually,” Harry added as the thought it through more. He remained uneasy about his choice to come back, even though it couldn’t have been a direct cause to creating James.
“Back where you belong,” murmured Burke as Harry stepped into his cell. His hands were unspelled and the cell door closed. Harry turned towards him but said nothing. He just wanted Burke to go away.
“Well, good on you, Potter,” an unknown voice announced. It sounded like it was coming from the cell next to Malfoy.
“Mr. Potter was imprisoned without a trial, and subsequently kept in an unsafe environment for weeks. While there, he was not only permanently marked with an Azkaban serial number, but sexually assaulted by one guard. The other guards did not heal his injuries until I insisted,” Hale counted off the ministry’s offenses. “Furthermore, he was denied his right to attend his own trial-”
“How are you doing this?” asked Lucius. Harry launched into an explanation of how he managed to create a new mirror and connect the two. He worried that Albert would be upset about the risk Theo took to help, but Harry wanted to give credit where it was due. Fortunately, Albert was far too impressed to be upset.
He saw the anger, and then the pain that crossed Draco’s face. “Potter, that’s bullshit and you know it.”
Harry accepted the mirror from Theo and glanced down. He expected to see Albert, or perhaps Crabbe since he didn’t get a chance to talk to him earlier, but it was Mulciber who smiled at him from the depths of the mirror.
“Raspberries,” said Crabbe immediately. Harry thought it was an odd choice but was more than happy to provide. All the other prisoners were equally grateful despite remarking on the disconnect between the sight and smell, and the taste. But they agreed that it was best not to chance the guards seeing any accidental leftovers that didn’t look like Azkaban’s standard meal.
“I’m a Malfoy, Potter. I’m perfectly capable of learning any branch of magic I set my mind to,” Draco said arrogantly.
They eventually came to a fork. Mounted on the wall was a sign that read ‘Block A’ with an arrow pointing towards the left and ‘Block B’ with an arrow pointing towards the right.
“That was dementors,” Harry interrupted despite the warning look he had received. This time his voice wasn’t as angry though he knew his tone clearly expressed that he thought the auror was an idiot. Probably not the best way to go either. “One was about to kiss my cousin. Do you think-“
Draco took a moment to think it over. “Given the circumstances, I think you’re doing well,” Draco decided.
Anton made a few more notes on the form. He then opened a drawer and he pulled out a weird looking camera from his desk.
“But…” Harry glanced at Anton for confirmation. The man wasn’t looking at him and looked mildly uncomfortable. Harry turned to Perkins who was frowning. Harry waited a moment and eventually Perkins nodded in confirmation.
McGonagall informed him that she would be the one to take him to the ministry. It left him worried about what she would think about his testimony, but he couldn’t do anything about it.
Harry didn’t know how to respond. Hale’s plan might be working for the moment, but the public was fickle. Yet, Burke wouldn’t be so upset if he wasn’t worried about Hale succeeding and painting Burke and the ministry in a negative light. As much as Harry wanted their plan to work, he didn’t want Albert to pay the price.
“I could-” Harry once again stalled on what he could offer. Draco let out a strained laugh and Harry cringed in response.
“You’re Burke’s lapdog now?” Nott butted in as he scrubbed at his armpit. It was hardly a threatening stance, but it gave Jugson reason to pause. He looked between the two men on either side of Harry as it became clear that anyone who wanted to mess with Harry would have to go through them first.
“Right, well, common,” Theo said impatiently and the others couldn’t miss his excitement. He started to walk away, and Harry was glad to see the others follow. Theo brought them to an empty classroom. After quickly scanning it to ensure no one was there, he announced, “this will do,” and looked at Harry expectantly.
“You know, this was Belly’s favourite curse before she mastered the cruciatus curse,” Rodolphus reminisced, sounding fond. It took Harry a moment to realize that ‘Belly’ was Bellatrix. He would have laughed at the nickname if he didn’t have such a vivid mental image of the woman cursing a bunch of men to feel the pain of labour and then cackling at their misery.
The tone of voice the two of them used made it seem as if they had been threatening Harry with the curses for the past hour instead of teaching him a few. If Harry hadn’t already been warry of Burke, the smirk he gave at Malfoy’s answer would have done the trick.
“Shut up. It is. You’re beautiful,” Harry said. He skirted around the projection, so he could marvel at it from different angles. When he neared Draco, he crowded at his back, wrapped his arms around Draco’s stomach and watched the slow movements from over Draco’s shoulder. They stood there for several minutes and just watched the beautiful light. When Draco finally cancelled the spell, Harry couldn’t help but feel bereft.
“Are you sure?” Lucius asked. “I don’t want to jeopardize your release if the guards find the letter,” Lucius provided Harry an easy way to decline, even though he clearly hoped Harry would be willing.
Potter?” asked another voice down the hall. Murmuring broke out in various cells as word spread down the hallway. Harry figured when he arrived last night, many of them must have been asleep and were only noticing now that they had a new prisoner amongst them.
“... away. I got this,” Burke was saying to a dementor that had stopped at the open door to Harry’s cell. It hovered on the threshold, neither moving in nor leaving as Burke requested.
“Help,” Harry whispered as he watched the unmoving dementor. He pushed feebly at Burke while the man’s attention was off him, but barely managed to get the man to budge.
Harry panted through the onslaught of information and the accompanying headache that came with connecting to another’s mind. It wasn’t something he could put into words and explain like any other magical theory, but he suddenly knew how dementors pulled out someone’s soul. If Harry had time to think, he would have convinced himself that it was a magic he couldn’t perform since he wasn’t a dementor. But he knew he had to try when Burke pushed Harry’s legs wide open so that he could settle comfortably between then. Harry trembled, closed his eyes, and tried to call on his magic to coax Burke’s soul out of his body.
“When you get out, you mail my wife,” said Crabbe. “Tell her to check the family library. Any books that mention horcruxes are yours.”
“But it can happen. It happened with me. Volde-sorry, You-Know-Who didn’t mean to make me his horcrux, but it just happened anyway,” Harry pointed out.
“You’re not a shit dad. You’re patient with him. You make sure he’s healthy and happy. You do more than you know,” Draco reassured him. Privately, Harry thought about the reasons why he did those things. He remembered his own childhood filled with hurt and a desperate need to be loved. Thus far James had not been burdened with those memories. In many ways, the baby was innocent, even if the soul in him was not.
“You think I don’t know that you went crying to the minister about your well-deserved tattoo?” Burke sneered. “Did you think you would get me fired? Well boy, I have news for you. It doesn’t matter who you know, or how much money you have, it means nothing in Azkaban.”
Harry looked to Lucius even though he wasn’t sure what he expected the man to do. Burke clearly wouldn’t listen to reason. They had no other recourse. Harry flinched when the door at the end of the hall opened and closed again.
Lucius’ drawn expression offered no comfort. Harry grew increasingly fidgety as the seconds ticked by.  Harry couldn’t suppress his jump when the door at the end of the hall finally opened. It seemed to take forever for Burke to return Albert to his cell. Harry wondered if Burke was purposely trying to torture them by building the suspense.
?” asked Zabini with a raised eyebrow. He sounded like Ginny had when she’d questioned Harry’s use of Lucius’ first name.
“Of course, towards the end, they were mostly killing their own,” Lestrange laughed from the cell next to Harry. Harry felt a little sick at the thought regardless of who the victims were.
Harry glanced at Hale, but he couldn’t tell what Hale wanted or expected him to say, so he settled on the truth. “Not the guards, no.”
The other prisoners were interested in what other hijinks Harry had gotten into over the years. He didn’t want to mention anything that might still get him or his friends in trouble. He also thought it best to steer clear of anything that directly involved Voldemort. He settled on telling them about the time in first year when Draco had caught him out after curfew. Only when he went to tattle on them, McGonagall ended up giving him detention as well.
The second guard shushed the first while elbowing him. They both left without further comment, so Harry morosely picked at his food.
“Pregnancy?” Harry asked faintly. It didn’t make any sense. How could Ginny be pregnant? How could Ginny be
“As for the second time...” Harry paused, realizing he was about to share another big secret with Draco. He instinctively balked at the idea of telling anyone, but immediately realized he was being ridiculous. He trusted Draco with his worst secret already.
Harry panted into the rough thin sheets, eyes still pressed tightly together. He didn’t want to open them to amused Death Eaters. Taking a few deep breaths, Harry braced himself to be taunted before he sat up and opened his eyes.
“Not like that,” Harry said. He wanted to comfort Draco and say Lucius was alright, but a beating from the guards wasn’t the only danger in Azkaban. Harry was worried about them himself. However, he didn’t want to say any of that given that Draco was clearly hoping for reassurances. Not sure what else to say, Harry offered “your dad is mostly worried about you.” He hoped it would bring some comfort to know that Draco was still Lucius’ top priority.
“Except we’d be stuck smelling him every time he came to visit us,” pointed out Harry, but he couldn’t stop giggling at the mental picture.
“You’re not half a person, Potter,” Draco said, he wanted to stop that ridiculous notion right away. He kept a firm hand in Harry’s hair and brought the other to cup his cheek. “You’re right. I do know you. I know you’re the most generous person in my life. I know you fight for everyone, except perhaps yourself. I know you try to make a better world for the people you care about. What I don’t know is how you don’t see it yourself.”
The guards were all riveted on Burke’s unresponsive body. Fortunately for Harry, they assumed gravity was the cause of Burke falling over. Harry’s accidental magic had either not reached them or was mild enough to overlook while coming to terms with this crisis.
Tired of the scrutiny, Harry decided to skip his afternoon classes. The pitying looks from his classmates were hard deal with, but he knew it would be nothing compared to whatever Snape had in store for him. Harry didn’t have the energy to deal with it even if it gave Snape more time to think up ways to humiliate Harry when he inevitable had to go back to class.
“Never getting rid of you if you’re determined to stay,” Harry admitted. He watched his soul struggle to stay together. In some ways it was like their relationship. Harry clung to the most healthy thing in his life, determined to keep it together. It was a struggle only because he still didn’t feel worthy of it. And yet he was the luckiest asshole on the planet because Draco will wanted him despite everything. Some days Harry didn’t know what to do with that love; it always left him feeling breathless. As he’d done many times over the past few years, Harry vowed to be worthy of it.
“I’ll tell you,” Lucius suddenly interjected. Harry was surprised at how much it hurt his heart to think that Lucius was about to sign his death warrant.
At this pronouncement, some of the teachers started voicing their protests. Dumbledore moved around the head table and started making his way towards the ministry employees.
“I suspect Draco was attempting the pulling-pigtails approach to discovering a crush,” Lucius suggested. “If he knew he has a chance with you, I imagine he would be less… mean.”
“Asherath showed me how,” Harry said. He thought back on the dementor's (in)actions and wondered if it had been another weird test of theirs. “I think he wanted me to do it. Maybe to see if a human could?”
Harry was taken aback, not expecting that, especially from his dour professor. The other professors gave Harry time to mull over the suggestion.
“Why? It’s nothing he hasn’t seen already,” Albert countered immediately before Harry was forced to leave.
“It was a compliment,” Mulciber brushed off Lucius’ warning. “So Pots, why haven’t you asked Draco out yet?”
“Pity we can’t owl order one for Burke,” stated Mulciber. Harry laughed as he imaged the look on the man’s face as he accidentally set it off as he opened the package.
“Yes. Well, I didn’t know her name, but I knew it was Goyle. And I was just trying to scare him. Jesus, Parkinson, I’m not perving on eleven- and twelve-year-olds,” Harry said defensively.
“You’d know all about delinquency,” Harry muttered. He didn’t need Hermione’s elbow to his side to let him know he said it too loud. Snape’s frown grew more pronounced than ever as he leveled Harry with a look that could rival aunt Petunia’s look of utmost disgust. Harry didn’t care. He didn’t need Snape of all people throwing proverbial stones. When Harry chanced a glance in Draco’s direction, he was somewhat mollified by the blonde’s annoyed expression. Harry knew it wasn’t for his benefit. Half of Snape’s comments had referred to Harry’s stay in Azkaban, which was where Draco’s father still resided.
“Then it actually is pretty remarkable. Very few people can get a reaction - no matter how short-lived - on their first try.”
Evenings were spent casually conversing. Occasionally someone would ask Harry about his life, but often the men seemed inclined to share details about their lives. Harry tended to pay more attention whenever Lucius or Crabbe talked about their sons. Harry thought it was because he knew Draco and Vincent, though both Lucius and Albert noticed Harry perked up more whenever Draco was mentioned. Harry became suspicious when Albert started asking Lucius questions about Draco, successfully steering the conversation back to Harry’s rival. It seemed especially odd given that Albert rarely talked about his own son. Whenever Harry asked a question about Theodore, Albert would merely say something along the lines of his son was a smart and capable boy. It left Harry with the impression that Albert didn’t spend much time with his son. It was odd given how much fatherly interest Albert was showing Harry.
He did appreciate that Narcissa gave Molly some areas that she could be involved in. Harry suspected they were carefully chosen to be things Narcissa didn’t care as much about, or she expected Molly’s decisions would be forced to compliment the rest of the wedding plans.
Harry didn’t specify his relatives. He figured Theo would find out soon enough anyway, and he didn’t want to be present when he did. If Theo had already made the link to Harry’s earlier statement about personal information, he didn’t try to confirm it.
“I told you the other prisoners taught me these subjects. Lucius covered charms,” Harry said. For a moment Harry was tempted to tell them he’d been able to cover more than just the theory. He held back because doing so would mean explaining the whole soul eating part and he feared their reactions. It wasn’t a mostly failed crucio casting that his target had laughed off. He took Burke’s soul and would never be able to give it back. Worse, he was damaging the soul each time he used magic. He feared what they would say if they knew.
Before Harry could ask what that had to do with anything, the sound of the door opening at the end of the hallway interrupted their conversation. As the other prisoners did not immediately start moaning, Harry figured it was the guards this time instead of more dementors. His suspicion was confirmed as he heard them passing out lunch. Harry was surprised when it sounded like the guards were having a more difficult time rousing the prisoners than they had that morning. A large number of the ones that were responding were refusing the food.
“It’s not though, is it? I mean the Malfoys...” Harry said, but trailed off at her confused look. “Oh, did they die in the battle too? I hadn’t heard. The last I saw of Malfoy, er, Draco, he was alive, but...”
When he finished his tale, he paused, standing in the middle of his cell and panting slightly. He watched the only two people he could see clearly. Both Malfoy and the man he called Albert looked noticeably shocked.
“Draco, I can’t. It’s too...” Harry put down his fork and pushed away his meal as his stomach churned just thinking about what he’d done.
“I could, couldn’t I?” Draco said arrogantly, before he snorted in not-so-elegant manner. The two laughed, and Harry relaxed as the conversation turned light-hearted. Harry still worried Draco would come to regret being with him but let himself bask in the feeling of being wanted. A weight had been lifted knowing Draco’s love was given in full knowledge of Harry’s worst flaws.
Before Harry could respond, he heard a surprised “Neville?”. Harry’s heart stuttered. He feared that the ministry had decided to arrest Neville after all. He looked around the room in panic, but instead of seeing his fellow Gryffindor, Harry spotted Stan Shunpike. The man had paused in the middle of getting dressed to stare at Harry in shock.
“We may never know for sure,” Draco said one day while he and Harry cuddled on their bedroom floor with Harry’s soul projected above them. He’d run every test he could think of and had no conclusive answers. The next step would be to observe James, or to consult outside help but that might also mean letting them know what Harry had done.
“Please don’t. The ministry would just assume it was me and send me right back to my cell,” Harry said.
They didn't jump into teaching Harry spells like they had planned. Instead, Nott gave Harry an overview of what to expect during his first meeting with his judicial-wizard and what to say to the guards if they stalled and tried to deny him access to representation.
As Harry expected, Snape was the only professor he saw that day that wasn’t understanding or supportive. He’d started the class by making a big spectacle when he announced they would review the past several classes, specifically so Harry could catch up. From any other professor it might have been a kindness, though they wouldn’t single him out like Snape did. Snape tried to use the opportunity to show how little Harry knew. This became clear when he posed more questions to Harry than any of his peers who had attended the lessons. Unfortunately for Snape, Harry was unwilling to pretend to struggle and answered all of the questions correctly. When it became apparent he couldn’t humiliate Harry this way, Snape decreed that since Harry did not need their help, he had until Monday to hand in all of the assignments he missed. Since it was already Thursday, it was clear he expected Harry to spend the entire weekend catching up on weeks of Defense lessons. Snape didn’t bother to actually give him a list of the missed assignments. Hermione likely had a record of them, so Harry knew he’d be fine. Still, it seemed like Snape hoped he’d miss some so that he’d have an excuse to fail Harry.
“Disorderly conduct,” Burke shrugged. It was a laughable excuse given that Burke encouraged Jugson to act disorderly just a few minutes ago.
When Burke stormed in, he interrupted their lunch where Lucius was insisting Harry hold his spork (the only utensil Azkaban provided) in a more “dignified” manner. He was also suggesting how much food ought to be picked up and eaten at a time. Lucius was disappointed he didn’t have a full range of utensils to show Harry how to “eat properly”. Harry found that his posture, portion control, and the placement of the spork in his hand was more than enough as far as these etiquette lessons should go.
Harry cast a low-level light spell in his own cell. He then transfigured a portion of his wall to be reflective so he could see the areas that required an illusion. Thanks to a childhood spent with Dudley, Harry knew exactly what he looked like with a black eye, so he gave himself the appearance of one now. The other injuries were harder because they required Harry to think back on his assault and remember exactly what Burke had done to him. It wasn’t something he wanted to think about. Ever.
“Only because I feared Mr. Potter’s illegal detainment would go on indefinitely otherwise,” Hale explained. “So, yes Mr. Runecraft, I would like to discuss how the ministry will compensate Mr. Potter for the mental, physical, and emotional pain they have caused.”
Anything Harry would have said in response was quickly forgotten as he spotted something even more threatening once Burke had moved out of the way. In one of the cells across from him, a pair of grey eyes were watching him. Harry wondered if Burke planned this when he picked this cell for Harry or if it was just an unlucky coincidence. Being surrounded by death eater was bad. Terrible even. But being in the cell across from Lucius Malfoy was going to be hell.
“Wiblin,” Burke gestured to the other guard to open the door. Wiblin waved his wand and the door swung open.
“He’s just a boy!” interjected Madame Pomphrey. Some of the teachers had followed Dumbledore towards the ministry workers. Harry was touched that Pomphrey was sticking up for him as well.
Two guards passed out breakfast without their usual sneers or loud noises that woke the dozing prisoners. They worked quickly and efficiently. When they neared Harry, he made sure to move slowly as if he was still injured. The guard passing Harry his food, cringed at the sight of his injuries and looked away. He left without offering to heal him.
“Do you still have your old Ancient Runes notes?” he asked. Hermione obviously hadn’t brought them as she didn’t anticipate Harry’s new interest in the subject.
“Sorry, sorry,” Harry said as all nearby prisoners groaned at the brightness. He quickly dimmed the light to a more suitable level.
They asked Harry to recount what he had been learning so far that year. Harry was surprised how difficult it was to remember. He knew Hermione would have been disappointed at his fumbling attempts to recall what happened in class even just a couple of weeks ago. In all honestly, most of his attention span was taken up by either Ginny or Draco. He hadn’t been paying that much attention in class. Not that he would have admitted that aloud.
“Common, let’s get you to bed so you can sleep it off. Postpone feeling bad about this until the morning,” Draco said, and helped Harry up.
Harry stared at the wall separating him from Lestrange incredulously. The man wanted to talk about quidditch now? Harry couldn’t help thinking the man was an insensitive arsehole. Harry figured the man must have as clear a view of Malfoy as Harry did. Clearly it wasn’t the time to talk quidditch.
A few moments later, Harry heard the sound of a door opening and closing. The pitiful moans from the other inmates eventually tapered off. Despite believing that the dementor was gone, at least for the moment, Harry could not stop staring at the spot he last saw the creature. Harry did not move from his spot on his bed for a long while.
*and another teaser* Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts, you can expect Draco to make an appearance in the next chapter.
“Quidditch doesn’t count,” argued Rodolphus. “A little bit of violence is expected to make the game interesting.”
Harry had no delusions about his own fatherly skills. He tried. The last thing he wanted was to be anything close to the Dursleys, so he vowed to give James a better childhood than he had. Still, he couldn’t look at James without being reminded of what he’d done. Consequently, he couldn’t provide the easy affection that the rest of the family gave. He let them pick up his slack and prayed it was enough for James.
“Wait… are you saying- did you use an unforgiveable on my wife?” the man asked letting Harry know that the Lestrange next to him was in fact the one married to Bellatrix. As far as Harry knew, the other Lestrange brother wasn’t married. Harry didn’t answer him and refused to look at either Malfoy or Nott in case his guilt was plainly written on his face. His silence was probably just as damning.
The dementors made a rattling sound that Harry assumed was their version of “hmmmmm”. They took a moment to assess the young wizard before them, unperturbed by the pitiful moans of the other prisoners.
Hermione gave him updates on their classes the whole way to the library. She once again expressed her worry about Harry being able to catch up in time for exams.
“Of course you did,” said Nott with an amused snort. “I might have a book in my dorm. Not sure it’ll help for this particular situation though.”
“-unstable,” sneered Snape’s voice. Harry was able to hear it from the other side of Dumbledore’s door. He stopped to listen to the conversation instead of letting them know he was there.
“Yeah,” Harry said nervously, but when Draco moved away, he stood in Draco’s vacated spot and waited.
“I’m fine. I’m going to go get some books from my room and start on the assignments I got today,” he said. He took a few minutes away from them to calm down, but was still annoyed that Ron and Hermione immediately cut off their conversation when he rejoined them. It didn’t take a genius to know they’d been talking about him.
“Er, why don’t you need a shave?” Harry asked Lucius as he realized the man was as cleanshaven as ever.
Draco had Harry explain as much as he was comfortable sharing. Harry gave a vague account of when it happened, how he knew what to do, a PG version of when he gave Ginny the ring, and finally how he’d woken up from the coma to be handed a broken ring and a new baby. Draco wasn’t as certain as Harry that James was his horcrux, but he couldn’t offer any alternative theories before he researched soul magic. He promised to keep Harry updated on his progress.
“Thank you,” Harry said, grateful for Ron’s foresight. Harry didn’t like the idea of people going through his things, and he would have hated it if the aurors had taken his dad’s cloak and map. He hoped his family album was safe.
Harry moved quickly through the halls, trying to pass the other students before they realized he was there. Harry alternated keeping his map in his pocked and pulling it out for quick glances until he was able to confirm that Draco was headed towards his common room. Harry shoved the map back in his pocket and picked up his pace so he would catch them in time.
Harry hesitated at the waistband of his jeans. He’d changed around his dorm mates and the quidditch team loads of times but this felt different. Harry glanced at Anton but the man appeared to be busy writing down and packing the articles of clothes Harry had removed so far. Perkins seemed to be staring at Harry’s shoes. Bradley was standing behind him but when Harry glanced at him, he noticed that he was watching Harry and his wand was still trained on him. Burke seemed to be watching him even more intently than Bradley which made Harry rather uncomfortable. Burke waved his wand in a ‘go on’ gesture so Harry removed his trouser and quickly grabbed the Azkaban ones. He was glad there weren’t special Azkaban pants too.
The others argued with Theo, but Harry paid it no mind. He was too focused on Draco, who sat down next to Harry as he continued to look over his notes. Harry felt ridiculous at how happy it made him to have Draco sitting next to him.
dark magic. It’s a way to gain immortality. Sort of. The theory is that, you can break off a portion of your soul and store it in an inanimate object. If you died, you’re still tied to this world. Someone else can use that portion of your soul to bring you back,” Harry said.
“You are under arrest for casting the cruciatus curse on Bellatrix Lestrange last June,” stated the auror who has his wand trained on Harry. While the man didn’t have the same dramatic flair as the other wizard, his voice was loud and clear as it carried across the hall.
“Perhaps not condone it but I can understand it,” Malfoy answered. “Don’t pretend that you would have done differently. Either of you.”
“With your permission, I would like to photograph your hand,” Hale said as he observed the hand in question. “And the tattoo you were unlawfully given by Azkaban’s guards.”
“She told us you gave her your mother’s ring, and promised to make it back to her,” Mrs. Weasley said softly. Harry looked at her with worry but noted neither she nor her husband were looking at Harry with anger or disgust. Ginny must not have told them what the ring was. In fact, it almost sounded like Ginny had led them to believe it had been – well, perhaps not an engagement ring, but some sort of promise ring. In a way it had been, but not how Mrs. Weasley assumed.
“Yeah, well, that wasn’t me. I mean, I wasn’t controlling it. I’m usually treated to my worst memories,” Harry said. He realized he probably shouldn’t be so candid with death eaters, but the entire situation was freaking him out. What could the dementors possibly want with him? “It was one of the dementors that stopped it. He stated he
Nott lent Harry his book on blood magic, and a second one he’d borrowed from a housemate. Harry expressed concern about someone else knowing they – or at least Nott – were suddenly interested in blood magic. Nott reassured Harry that he didn’t tell them why he wanted to borrow their book, and he certainly never mentioned Harry’s name when he asked.
“To be honest, I don’t think they want you back,” Draco said. When Harry flinched at the news, he amended, “they’re all understanding about why you’re sloshed. They just want to spare the kids from seeing it.”
“I suspect Scrimgeour and his like feared Dumbledore would snatch you away the second you were out of prison. They hoped to give you a guilty verdict without having to move you,” Hale groused.
Harry didn’t mind. The slew of papers Hale was carrying made it easy to hide away the letter Rodolphus begged Harry to pass on to his wife.
“Do I smell good then?” Ron broke the tense silence. He moved slower than Hermione had, but drew Harry into a hug as well. Surprised but grateful, Harry hugged him back.
“You thought the dementor would help you, but not the guards?” asked one wizard. He sounded thoroughly confused.
Harry lingered in the shelves, watching them, and he tried to think of what to say to Draco specifically. Unfortunately, he could only think about how tired Draco looked and mentioning that was unlikely to go over well. Harry itched to comfort him but had no idea how to go about it in a way that wouldn’t be rejected.
“But that’s another thing. He’s actually more kind than I ever gave him credit for,” Harry admitted. He was still embarrassed about being so candid with his feelings, but he was starting to appreciate finally being able to talk about it openly and not feel judged for who he was crushing on. “I used to think he was spoiled-”
“It’s no more of a risk than creating pictures, and hairbrushes and whatnot,” Harry said. He levitated the letter towards him before Lucius could add any more token protests. Harry used a mild sticking charm to ensure the rolled-up letter wouldn’t unravel. He added another sticking charm to keep the letter on the inside of his shirt. He didn’t know when Hale would be back, so he had to keep the letter on his person. At Albert’s suggestion, he also added a notice-me-not charm.
“No. No one should know what they are. They’re horrible. You break off a piece of your soul and place it in an object. If you die you can come back because a piece of your soul remains. But you have to kill someone to make it. Kill them and... and... Draco, I can’t! It’s too horrible. The things you do to make one! No one should make one. And he made so many. We couldn’t find them all. And they all had enchantments to protect them. We didn’t know how to destroy them for the longest time. It seemed impossible, you see? You understand? Draco?” Harry looked at him, worried Draco wouldn’t understand.
“For you losing your faith in me, my boy,” Dumbledore said. “I had not anticipated that you wouldn’t believe I would do everything I could to get you released.”
Harry agreed with Malfoy’s assessment of the food being bland. The texture of the mystery meat bothered Harry just as much as its look did. However, Harry once again compared it to staying with the Dursleys. He was at least getting a full meal and he didn’t have to do the cooking.
“Potter, your hair is getting rather long,” Draco observed. He emphasized his point by running his hand through Harry’s locks. It wasn’t the first time he’d done that, so Harry didn’t think much of it.
Harry wasn’t completely convinced the plan would work. He knew the minister was desperate to gain public support. Since Harry made it clear he wasn’t going to help with that goal, the ministry would likely fight back by painting him as a delinquent. There was no guarantee that people would believe him over the ministry.
“You’re ok,” Lucius said. He needed to be reassured just as much as Harry. Harry found himself fighting back tears as his mind traveled back to his last encounter with Burke. Harry was reluctant to show any weakness in front of the guards and prisoners but could not help but cling to Lucius. Hugs were a novel experience for Harry. He only pulled away once the hug was boarding on a socially acceptable amount of time.
“I bear the guilt of Nymphadora’s death too. I told her to stay home, that she had a child and shouldn’t be involved in the fighting. But she said she needed to make sure the world was a better place for him, and I didn’t stop her. I should have, but I let her leave and have regretted it ever since,” Andromeda admitted.
“No… he, well, he told Bellatrix not to curse us,” Harry said. He knew it was more to preserve the orb than any concern for their wellbeing, but he saw how Hale would reframe what had happened. With Bellatrix as the villainous leader, the others were helpless not to follow orders, however reluctantly, though they tried to stop any harm from occurring to the hapless children. Harry tried to answer Hale’s question with this idea in mind. He knew his friends wouldn’t be happy if they found out Harry was willingly going along with it, but perhaps he could pretend his words had been twisted if it became an issue.
Harry shouldn’t have been surprised that Burke was back. He was beginning to think the man must live in Azkaban since he was always there.
“Not even if you’re sick, or...” Harry scrambled to think of another reason, “or to feed your young?” Harry knew it was extremely unlikely that the dementors fed their children like birds fed their chicks, but he was desperate. Both dementors made loud rattling sounds. It took Harry a moment, but he realized it was a dementor’s version of a laugh.
Harry talked a little of current events that he picked up mostly from Hermione, but it quickly became clear that that wasn’t the main topic Malfoy was fishing for.
Harry transfigured more rocks into parchment, roughly the size of a standard muggle photo. He focused on a new memory. When he opened his eyes, Draco’s smile greeted him. Harry sucked in a breath as a sense of longing hit him hard. It was no wonder Lestrange sounded so grateful for his photo.
“How could I know?” Harry said, somewhat defensively. He let some of his bitterness bleed into his voice when he added, “you never came to see me.”
“Oh, Ron, don’t be rude,” Hermione reprimanded. Harry didn’t think it was for Crabbe’s sake, but more of an automatic response.
He settled in for another day at the library. Ron and Hermione joined him once again. Harry wasn’t too surprised when Nott joined them a little later as well. Both Ron and Hermione still watched him suspiciously but didn’t protest aloud.
“I did. I’m pretty sure it was ugly sobbing too, though my memory is a bit spotty. Maybe it wasn’t bad. He did give me breakfast and lent me some clothes, so it couldn’t have been that bad, right?” Harry said.
“Do we really have to wait for Parkinson and Theo?” Harry asked once he was certain Parkinson was far away enough not to hear him. He didn’t like the idea of waiting in the hallway. By now Lucius must be impatient hearing Draco but unable to speak to him.
“You wouldn’t believe the rumours going around,” the man continued. He paused, but Harry was determined to say nothing. He knew from the time that Scrimgeour visited at Christmas that the man would eventually come around to what he wanted to say.
While Draco didn’t confirm he knew how to get in touch with his escaped convict aunt, he accepted the letters when they were passed to him.
“No. I don’t know. It’s dark magic, so they wouldn’t admit it if they were experts. I could probably ask professor Dumbledore. He’s the one that told me about the others. If anyone is able to-” Harry suddenly stopped talking as another horrible thought occurred to him. Professor Dumbledore had been looking into Lord Voldemort’s horcruxes. If Harry was one, the man probably already knew. Equal parts anger and despair rose in him as he contemplated the likelihood that Dumbledore had already figured this out but held back that information from Harry. Was the man ever going to tell him? Was he saving it as the grand finale as he took Harry on a journey through Voldemort’s past? The hurt festered as he realized Dumbledore planned to destroy the horcruxes. What did that mean for Harry? What did Dumbledore expect to do about that one? Harry feared the answer.
“It probably hindered you more than helped,” suggested Malfoy. “Anger can provide the desire for the curse to work, but likely made you lose focus.”
Draco frowned at the door that appeared in front of him. He grabbed the handle and stood there for a moment. “What I need is... I need my father,” Draco finally decided. The words just as much as his tone made it clear that whatever he’d been doing all year, it was out of Draco’s depth. With an almost savage strength, Draco opened the door, resolutely stepped into the room, and closed the door behind him.
This hadn’t changed much once he got to Hogwarts. Despite having the time and resources to do schoolwork properly, Harry preferred to learn more in class than out of it. Perhaps if he and Hermione had been close from the very start, she could have changed his habits. However, his closest friend from the beginning was Ron, who was just as ‘intellectually lazy’. Harry felt that had recently changed, but by now his habits were set. He assumed he had excelled with Lucius and the others because they had been teaching him themselves, answering all questions, and never once told him to read dry books on the subject.
It was surreal for Harry that shortly after the men in the cells closest to him started suggesting various hexes and curses that one could use against enemies. They seemed amused and tried to one up each other with their suggestions.
“And yet, you threw in someone like Stan Shunpike into Azkaban without the same curtesy,” Harry pointed out the minister’s hypocrisy.
“If it was my underage son in this shithole, I would hope someone would do the same,” Nott responded.
The hallway lead to a changing room. It looked like the quidditch locker rooms, though there were no actual lockers. Instead the prisoners were expected to place their shoes along the wall, while their dirty clothes were dumped into one communal hamper.
“Er,” Harry once again felt the need to check his surroundings for eavesdroppers. “It’s probably best not to say how.”
“I supposed it’s now time to discuss my client’s compensation,” Hale stated loudly before everyone was dismissed.
“I...” Draco’s eyes teared up, and Harry panicked. He didn’t know why he always screwed things up so badly he made the people he fancied cry.
To pass the time while he waited for the others to finish eating, Harry brainstormed spells that would improve the quality of life around Azkaban. When Lucius swept his tangled hair away before it fell into his beans, Harry grew inspired to create the man a brush. He engraved the back of the brush with etchings of a couple of dragons. He used the same mind magic he learnt for the pictures to create realistic dragons based on his memories. Harry tried to tell himself the design was chosen because Lucius would appreciate it, but he knew that wouldn’t fool anyone anymore.
No one spoke while the guards were still in the hallway. Burke made the “I’m watching you” hand gesture as he passed Harry’s cell. In return, Harry exaggerated his eyeroll and smirked when Burke frowned. He was glad the man was too busy watching Harry’s expression to notice that his hands were trembling.
a prison…” Ron said slowly. Harry knew this sentiment would be the biggest challenge he’ll face. The wizengamot had basically said the same thing when Harry had brought it up during his trial.
“You’ve made your point,” Lucius said angrily from his cell. “The boy is successfully frightened. You should stop.”
“Thank you,” Harry said shyly, though he couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride with all he had accomplished. He wondered if this was how Fred and George felt every time they created a new product for their shop.
“He’s healthy. As I said, it was a difficult birth, but he’s a fighter... just like his dad,” the woman said kindly. She continued to say more, but Harry stopped actively listening as he cast his mind back to when he’d last seen Ginny, and the terrible reason he’d asked to meet her. It was something he hadn’t told anyone else. He couldn’t, because it was the source of his greatest shame.
, Potter,” Snape said. Harry was surprised that Snape hadn’t been able to undo all of the damage. On the one hand, Harry hoped that meant Snape was unaware of the spell he’d used. On the other hand, Harry did feel bad for damaging the school. He couldn’t offer to fix it though. Snape wouldn’t believe Harry capable of something he couldn’t manage. And Harry wasn’t telling him his outburst had been a dark arts spell, even if that knowledge could fix the wall.
“They couldn’t arrest them, but the aurors gave them a hard time for awhile. After the papers started reporting on Umbridge, the aurors stopped showing up at Hogwarts to question them. However,” the man paused and Harry knew he wouldn’t like whatever was next. “Arthur Weasley had been asked to take a work leave. The papers got wind of it quickly. The ministry tried to present it as a positive thing, as if Mr. Weasley could use the time to focus on his family during their legal troubles. Since the ministry imposed an unpaid leave, everyone could tell that was utter horseshit. Mr. Weasley was reinstated quickly. I think he even got a slight pay raise.”
“Hale thought the same thing,” Harry said. “I think it worked... wish I knew exactly what was said about me though.”
“Compensation?” asked Runecraft snidely. “He just got away with an unforgivable, and you suggest we further reward him?”
“But if it’s any consolation, my friends doubt that he’s marked. They too doubt Vol- you-know-who would mark someone still in school,” Harry attempted to reassure Malfoy despite his own doubts. Although Malfoy was wearing his best poker face, he seemed paler and more drawn than Harry could remember seeing him. Including the times just before dementors started patrolling their hallways. Faced with Draco’s father’s clear concern, Harry almost felt guilty about his suspicions.
“It might not, but I figured it won’t hurt me to try. If I can’t use anything you say, then I’m no worse off. But if there’s something there, well, to be blunt, your word will go a long way right now,” Hale explained. Harry still wasn’t seeing how anything he said would help. It wasn’t like Albert could pretend he didn’t have dark mark. Still, he told Hale he had no problem with it and gave permission to record his answers with the same quill that was used when he’d been interviewed in prison.
Nott raised his eyebrows, then quickly cast a privacy charm around their table. Harry thought it over. Telling Nott would be a serious risk. Harry trusted Albert, but he didn’t yet know his son. If he told Nott about his goal, he’d have the power to get Harry in serious trouble. It would also jeopardize Albert. If anyone found Lucius’ mirror or the other gifts, they would all be in trouble. He didn’t think Nott would risk it, but Harry knew that family connections don’t necessarily mean loyalty. The Dursleys taught him that early on.
smudge your copy with lube, don’t expect me to replace it,” Harry threw back and was satisfied when Lestrange laughed uproariously.
Desperate for something happy to think about, Harry tried to focus on Draco. Unfortunately, Harry got hung up on the disastrous scene in the library. He felt he’d wasted the perfect opportunity to impress Draco and hopefully get closer to him. For fuck’s sake, he’d admitted to stalking him like some creep. Even if Draco miraculously overlooked that, there was the whole Burke issue to consider. Logically Harry knew what happened wasn’t his fault. Burke was a sorry excuse of a man and his actions didn’t reflect who Harry was. Albert had repeated this fact to him multiple times following the attack. Harry had believed him, but every so often doubts came back. It made Harry feel weak, dirty, and scared that any future relationship he tried to build would be tainted by it. Harry used to get an excited thrill imagining being in bed with someone on top of him. Now, Burke lurked in the background and Harry was terrified about what would happen if he ever found himself in that position again.
“That one might be a bit hard,” observed Nott. Harry agreed, but wondered if he could ask some theoretical questions. Snape had never been clear, preferring to berate his students for not automatically knowing. And Slughorn assumed Harry had an excellent grasp of potions. Harry feared that posing too many questions would give him away. However, Harry discovered a new-found appreciation for the subject ever since discovering the half-blood prince’s book.
“You should also ensure you know all of the right spells too,” Lucius said, using the same tone of voice that he used in their lessons. “Harry, have you mastered all of the safe sex spel-”
“Don’t just focus on the... scars. Look at its size,” Draco directed. When Harry only frowned in response, Draco pointed out, “it’s the same size as mine was.”
The hallway was soon filled with pitiful moans. Harry thought the other prisoners sounded even more pained than they had the previous evening, though Harry himself remained unaffected. Even Malfoy and Nott in their animal forms were huddled in the back of their cells. Harry finally got a good look at Nott’s animagus form and it was a porcupine.
“There’s nothing between me and any Weasleys,” Harry said with a laugh. It surprised him, but he was actually OK with just being Ginny’s friend.
“Minister,” Harry responded somewhat hesitantly. He didn’t bother getting up from his cot. Instead he sat cross-legged, facing the man.
“Yes, that Potter,” drawled Malfoy. Harry thought he was enjoying himself. Someone a few cells down let out a loud laugh. The murmuring got louder and Harry’s defenses, which had been shaky since his arrest, were suddenly up and he was annoyed.
,” Draco sounded devastated, but instead of marching out the door and out of Harry’s life, he blindly grasped for Harry’s hand, unable to look away from the display in front of them. “I knew... It makes sense you’d have some scars.”
“There are other curses you could use. Doesn’t have to be an unforgivable,” suggested Lestrange. A moment later he seemed to realize what he has suggested so he hastily added, “though my wife would know the counter curses, so it would be unwise to use them against her.”
Harry froze for a heartbeat. He felt himself flush and feared his face was an unpleasant shade of red. “I should head back before Hermione comes looking for me,” he said. He followed his urge to flee and turned away from them, and started to walk back the way he came.
“No. You’re staying with me tonight,” he said and helped Harry make his way to Mrs. Weasley to say goodbye.
“I’m sure you’re aware that Dolores Umbridge was a professor last year,” when both Nott and Malfoy nodded he continued, “well whenever someone pointed out the ministry’s stupidity or said Vold- you-know-who was back, she’d give them detention. It might not surprise you that I got detention a lot. She made students write lines during detention with a blood quill. Mine eventually scarred.”
As he ate, Harry reflected on Draco’s words. He couldn’t get Lucius released from Azkaban since he didn’t have Hale’s skills. Perhaps there was something else he could do. Both at his trial and during his conversation with Dumbledore, Harry spoke of his desire to have better conditions for the prisoners. He wasn’t sure how to go about that, but perhaps he could think of ways to make their time in Azkaban less miserable. Perhaps Hermione would have ideas. Assuming Harry figured out a way to get her to care about the prisoners. She was a compassionate person. She wouldn’t have made SPEW if she wasn’t. However, she might be less sympathetic about helping a bunch of Death Eaters. Harry hoped to help all prisoners, but he knew Hermione would focus on the fact that mostly Death Eaters would benefit. Harry remembered the look she’d given him when he talked about the other prisoners. He would just have to count on her sense of justice outweighing her hatred and distrust of Death Eaters.
“The man was an auror. A very paranoid one. I’m pretty sure he mostly used that eye to sneak up on criminals or see through enchantments,” Lucius countered.
“I’m not going to hurt you,” Wiblin seemed offended that Harry assumed he would go to such an extreme. Harry let out a harsh sound that could only loosely be called a laugh. One of his hands unclenched from the sheets and covered the area where the tattoo Burke and Wiblin had force upon him was. It served to remind Wiblin that Harry had no reason to trust the man. The closer Wiblin tried to get, the more Harry became aware of his magic ready to rise to his defense. As much as Harry wanted to lash out at the man, he knew it wasn’t the smartest move. His inner Hermione was urging him to hold back on those impulses. So far it seemed like he was getting away with what he did to Burke, but if he cursed the guards then he’d be in trouble once again.
“No, this is heaven,” Lucius said. Harry wisely did not inform the man that it was based on Weasley cooking.
“We should try to add wards to the showers as well,” he suggested. Unfortunately, there was no easy way to draw the needed runes without attracting the attention of the prisoners. Harry worried he could not hold a large illusion with so much scrutiny on him already. They returned to their cells without putting anything in place.
“No one was as bad a Burke, but… some do hurt prisoners, most just say mean things or ignore you… which means they ignored what Burke did,” Harry said. He knew that some guards might have stood idle because they feared Burke rather than from genuine malicious intent. But the result was the same for Harry either way.
They asked if Albert ever told Harry what he’d do if he was released. Harry said he didn’t know Albert’s plans, but he obviously missed his son just as much as Theo missed his dad, so he’d likely try to contact him. Hale gave him a miniscule nod at his response.
“That’s just one part of it. It’s not just about the guards. They’re part of a system that needs to change,” Harry said with a sigh. An awkward silence fell. Harry pulled Hale’s scroll close and started to read through it.
“Harry,” Mrs. Malfoy spoke with obvious concern, but Harry had already turned away and rejoined Draco and the boys. He claimed not to be thirsty after all when Draco realized he came back without a glass of water.
“Potter, if you cast an unforgivable on ministry grounds then it’s safe to assume they have irrefutable proof,” Malfoy explained.
“Who?” Harry asked. He couldn’t help but wonder if his friends had been interviewed and if so, what they said.
Harry tried not to respond, not wanting to give the man the satisfaction of knowing he was scaring him. But his resolve crumbled when Burke started tugging his shirt collar away from Harry’s neck.
“We’ll bring him after Potter is returned to his cell-” the guard started to say but was cut off by one angry judicial-wizard.
“Here, Potter,” one of them said before sliding a food tray into Harry’s cell. Harry got up and made his way towards it. He nodded vaguely at them in thanks. They moved to give Malfoy his food, but each of them kept shooting glances back towards Harry. Self-consciously, he moved back to his cot and started picking at the food.
“Just hold this up… and look towards me… now look to right…” Anton quickly snapped a couple of photos then took the plaque back.
A few people asked him random questions, such as what he’d been wearing that day, or what time he’d encountered Lestrange. More often than not Hale jumped in and challenged the relevance of question, which spared Harry from having to recall inane details. The only time Hale did not immediately stop Harry from answering a question was when Harry recounted how there hadn’t been any ministry workers around when he’d arrived that day. Naturally, Hale took the opportunity to criticize the ministry further. Unfortunately, Scrimgeour deflected the blame to Fudge rather than the current ministry employees.
“Obviously not,” Harry sassed before he could sensor himself. There were some titters behind him. He thought he saw Hale suppress a smirk.
“Don’t know. I’m happy enough to be able to still do magic,” Harry said. Even though he had regained the ability once he’d consumed Burke’s soul, Harry still felt reassured to be holding his wand.
“I need a shave,” remarked Albert as he ran his hand along his chin. He patted Harry’s shoulder and told him “stick close to Lucius,” before he walked away. Harry watched him move towards a small line up of prisoners that were waiting for a guard to spell away any unwanted facial hair.
Hermione inhaled sharply causing Harry to instinctively step in front of her protectively despite knowing on some level that she was likely better equipped to handle this situation than he was. He could barely process what was happening.
“I think they broke some quills and a sneakoscope, but mostly they just made a mess,” Ron reassured Harry.
As they approached the man, he lifted a surprised eyebrow but didn’t ask why a teenager was being brought to Azkaban. Even if said teenager was still wearing his school robes. He merely handed Bradley some forms to fill out before moving towards a filing cabinet that also looked surprisingly muggleish to Harry. It seemed like John was the only one here willing to protest this madness… and even then it was only a minor objection. Everyone else seemed alright with locking Harry away.
Harry scrubbed as fast as he could without it being too obvious that he was rushing. He was scared that another man would soon come up to him with new threats. He didn’t know if Lucius and Nott’s threat of Voldemort’s displeasure would work on everyone. Harry was pretty sure it was just a ploy on the men’s part to keep him physically safe. “Thanks,” he said quietly to both men.
The password had not changed during his imprisonment, so he didn’t have a convenient excuse to postpone whatever the meeting was about for another day.
“Thank you,” Harry whispered as he didn’t the others to overhear him. “I could have worn my own robes though...”
Another uneasy silence descended. Draco and Zabini looked at each other and made subtle gestures. Harry feared they were trying to decide which of them was going to ask him about the Dursleys. Fortunately, before either of them could, Theo came running around the corner. A second later, he was followed by Pansy, Crabbe and Goyle.
“I’d known your relatives weren’t... the good sort, but I had not imagined they would resort to... well, I should have made more of an effort to check in no matter how busy life got,” she said.
“I know this can be hard to talk about, so I got legal permission to extract and use your memory of the attack,” Hale stated.
Despite his lack of progress with Kingsley, he still made enough waves to get noticed by the ministry workers and start a wave of gossip that eventually landed on some journalists’ desks. And despite his general distrust of reporters, Harry agreed to an interview where he explained he hadn't been able to provide testimony on behalf of Draco and Narcissa due to his coma. Now that he recovered, he wanted to rectify it.
