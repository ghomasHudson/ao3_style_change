“Come on, you said you wanted to wake up early so we could get some flying in before breakfast, remember?”
"I don't want to hear it!" Draco yelled, wiping furiously at his eyes. "Why did I bother helping you if you were just going to throw it away? My career is over, Harry, but yours is just getting started! How can you be this selfish?"
Draco arrived in London and made his way to the Bed and Breakfast that the Potters owned in Godric's Hollow. He secured, a quaint little room painted in green and silver, leaving the reservation open-ended. The room size was going to be a problem once the rest of his stuff got there, as it wasn’t even the size of his walk-in closet back home.  He was having quite a lot shipped over from his flat in Paris. But if he was going to be there for a while, he was going to need all his stuff.</p>
Harry scratched at his chin pensively as he mulled it over. “I wouldn’t say I don’t like you,” he finally responded. “I would say I don’t know you all that well. You still keep a lot hidden, Draco, even after all these years. I want to know more, though. There’s at least some potential, yeah?”
Draco captured his lips as he fucked him through his orgasm. He didn't think he'd ever grow tired of the way Harry looked when lost in complete surrender to his pleasure. He was stunning and Draco felt greedy for how much he wanted him. It only took a few more thrusts for him to finish, exhausted and drained from the day he'd had.
Draco pursed his lips together unhappily. He waved his hand and the curtain closed itself again. Sliding gracefully to his feet, he went into the kitchen and decided that if there was nothing to be done then he was just going to enjoy his breakfast. He dropped heavily back into his chair and did a quick heating charm on his food that had gone cold.
Draco dislodged his mouth with a wet pop and smiled up at Harry. "You're so beautiful," he said adoringly, easing his fingers from inside Harry. "On your hands and knees is better for your first time."
It took a while and a lot of work to get Harry back to the weight he had been during his last Grand Prix series. Draco refused to let Harry skate until he shed the weight, so their days were spent jogging and hitting the gym instead. Draco did everything he could to try and get close to Harry, but it seemed like Harry wasn't interested in them getting to know each other.
After a few weeks off, they headed to France for Harry's next event. It was nice to be going home after months away, finally getting a chance to see Pansy and Bruno again, and to stay in his own flat instead of at a hotel. Since most of his stuff had been packed up and shipped to England while he was training with Harry, his apartment was looking a little sparse.
“Well you’re not breaking your dry spell tonight, Potter,” Draco shot back, deftly undoing Harry’s belt and then undoing the top button of his jeans. Harry’s hand shot out and wrapped around Draco’s wrist.
“Very presumptuous of you, Potter,” Draco said, straightening Harry’s glasses on his face. “That I’m going to invite you home with me after our date.”
Draco couldn't help recalling his own mistakes during competitions, all the times Karkaroff had yelled at him at the kiss and cry, how hard he had always taken it when he failed. He found he didn't miss it at all. It was nice to still be involved in the sport he loved without all the weight of expectation on his shoulders. His time in the limelight was over. Now, he wanted to build something new with Harry.
Harry kissed with very little finesse, as if he'd never properly kissed anyone before, but had seen the act on television. Draco directed him in what to do, giving little tips and tricks, despite his alcohol-soaked brain. If Harry took offense to being told what to do, he didn't show it, and he was a quick study. Before long, Harry was kissing Draco so well that it made Draco's toes curl.
Draco groaned and scrubbed his hand over his face. Did he really need to explain this to Harry of all people? “Let’s start with this,” he said, thrusting his arm forward to show off the dark mark.
Draco felt his mind overload with information for a moment and realized he was still holding Harry’s belt, his fingers mere inches from Harry’s very obvious erection. He risked a glance towards Harry’s face and found Potter staring at him. “I haven’t had sex in over a year,” Harry confessed, meeting Draco’s gaze almost defiantly, as if daring him to say something scathing.
Draco undid the last few buttons on his shirt – a task Potter had abandoned halfway through – and shoved it off his shoulders. “Wanker.”
"I want you to fuck me," Harry said, chewing on his bottom lip nervously. "I've wanted it for a long time."
“Really?” Draco asked, sounding skeptical. “I would have thought I would be the last one you’d want as a soulmate.”
It didn't take Draco long to figure out that Harry had disobeyed his order and was going back to doing the quads. When Draco knew the first one was coming, his heart felt like it was going to burst, and he found himself holding his breath. The moment Harry's feet touched the ice, Draco threw his arms in the air in celebration. Considering Harry hadn't landed it in practice, the speed and height of the jump had been perfect.
Draco pulled back and gripped Harry around the middle, rolling them to switch places. “Shall I show you how it’s done, Potter?” Draco was thankful for the chance to not have to speak. The last thing he needed was to say something stupid and ruin this. He tugged Potter’s boxers down and off to come an up close look at the Chosen One’s cock. Draco had to stamp down the feeling of hysteria bubbling up inside him. He was in bed with Harry Potter, about to put his dick in his mouth. If only his fourteen-year-old self could see him now.
"Salut Draco!" Pansy greeted him, answering the phone with her arm around Bruno. She had graciously agreed to watch Draco's dog for the time being so he could focus on Harry. Seeing his beloved dog on his phone screen made Draco tear up and regret leaving him behind. Pansy seemed to take in his demeanor immediately. "What's wrong?"
Harry snorted. “Try again,” he teased, his tongue doing the same to the tip of Draco’s cock, lapping teasingly at his foreskin.
"Harry, if I am to be your coach, it is important that we get to know each other," Draco said firmly, coming to stand in front of Harry. "I want to know everything about you, your friends and your hobbies."
to Zabini to keep him thinking he had done something wrong when he really hadn’t. They hadn’t really talked about it but Draco must have wanted to snog Blaise, right?  “I’m not Draco,” Harry told him. “I’m Harry Potter.”
When they arrived back at the hotel room, Draco made sure to take care of Harry the way he wished someone had always taken care of him after a bad performance. He iced Harry's feet for a bit and then drew him a hot bath. Harry sat amongst the bubbles still looking a little lost with Draco sitting on the floor beside the tub. Draco wished he knew what to do – either as Harry's coach or as his partner – but he was sadly ill-equipped to deal with this situation. He knew that nothing anyone said had ever made him feel better after he'd messed up a routine. He had a feeling that Harry was very similar to him in that regard.
When he stepped into the room, his mother stood up to greet him. He smiled warmly at her and embraced her when she put her arms around him. Despite some of her shortcomings, Draco really did love his mother. She was the main reason he was even there for lunch. Both his parents came from a long line of French aristocrats and had very conservative ideals. So while his mother didn't exactly support his being gay, she did her best to still love him, and that was about as much as Draco could ask for under the circumstances.
Draco got his answer when he left the bathroom just in time to see Harry slip out of the guest bedroom. In just his pants, Draco could see the flush of Harry’s skin, the bite marks on Harry’s lips, and the waning erection. Harry ducked his head down and went into the bathroom, locking the door behind him. Draco went into his own bedroom and spent the night wondering if he should have let himself have this one thing or if it would have made everything a million times worse to give in to Harry Potter.
"It was my goodbye," Harry cut him off, beginning to pace his room. "A goodbye to the sport I love."
was speaking to him of all people? Draco turned his face up to see who was standing over his bed and was shocked to find everything was blurry.
Draco had always felt like he did everything alone. After turning fifteen, he began picking his own music and choreographing his own routines to tell a story. Karkaroff had mostly just been there to yell at him when he screwed up. He hoped that Harry knew – whether he got on the podium or not – he wasn't doing this alone.
“Have you lost your mind?” Harry asked, struggling against the ropes binding his arms and legs. He could only hope this wasn’t what Draco and Zabini normally did when they were “having fun.”
"You're the one who shot the video, right?" Draco asked, leaning against the doorframe. It was a rare moment to get Hermione alone without Ron. He had a feeling Ron didn't like him all that much, but Hermione was a decent sort. "Why did he do my routine?"
Draco looked up at Harry expectantly but Harry just looked away from him. Exhaling loudly, Draco got to his feet and held out his hand. "Tell me what you do for fun around here, Harry. Or better yet, show me."
“So you’re into me because you want to be unhappy,” Draco said, snorting with derision. “You really are ridiculous, Potter.”
"I'm not going to be uncomfortable," Harry insisted, smiling warmly up at Draco. "You'll take care of me like you always do."
“Zabini, I’m partnering with Malfoy today,” Draco said, taking Zabini’s books and depositing them on the seat in front of where he was currently sitting. “Move.”
Draco forced a smile onto his face. Harry didn't know his parents at all, and in that moment, Draco was kind of glad of that fact.
"We should change the quads in the second half to triples," Draco told him decisively as he handed Harry his water.
"I've made a decision," Harry said, sinking lower into the tub. "Tomorrow will be my final skate. I'm grateful for everything you've done for me and I never could have gotten where I am without you. I think we should end it though."
“Sometimes,” Draco said with a noncommittal shrug. Since the war, Potter, Weasley and Granger had started almost an outreach programme, helping people whose lives were destroyed by the war regardless of side. It had made Draco feel like their pet project but Draco hardly would have been employable without Harry backing him. Sometimes the knowledge of that had Draco seething with anger. He and Potter weren’t exactly friends but they tolerated each other on occasion. Now that apparently included late night visits and cups of tea with impromptu kissing.
Harry had decided that the theme for his skate performances this season would be perseverance. Draco had completely agreed, as this was Harry's comeback after his accident. The truth was that Draco was so proud of Harry and everything he had accomplished so far this season. He knew Harry had his heart set on gold, but Draco thought the fact that he was even competing again was a huge accomplishment already. A lesser skater would have let an accident like that take them down for good.
After years of searching for something to give him purpose, remaking himself on the ice year after year, he felt like he'd finally found what he’d been looking for with Harry. There was a strong foundation, and Draco wanted a chance to see it grow. He'd been chasing the dream his father had set for him when he was eleven, but now he wanted something different. A new dream to call his own.
Draco ripped himself away and began to pace the length of the courtyard. It was impossible. He couldn’t be Harry Potter’s soulmate. The idea was just too preposterous to comprehend. It had to be something else. Dark magic or some kind of mistake.
He took his time opening Harry up, making sure Harry wasn't in any kind of pain or discomfort. He ignored Harry's pleading for more and made sure that Harry felt nothing but pleasure. In order to accomplish this he took Harry into his mouth, bobbing his head and moving his fingers in unison. Every time his fingers pressed against Harry's prostate, Draco would take Harry as deep as possible, so that if Harry moved or bucked off the bed, he wouldn't choke Draco as he had nowhere left to go.
Harry huffed indignantly and crossed his arms over his chest. "I'm not looking for a coach. I don't even know if I want to continue my skating career!"
you idiot!” Draco hissed, diving for the sofa and pulling Harry down with him. Draco ended up on his back with Harry on top of him. The last thing he needed was the papers getting a picture of Harry in just his pants at Draco’s flat. “How did they even know you were here?”
Harry opened the door and tugged Draco through it. The flashing of the cameras was almost blinding and the shouts of the reporters calling out questions was almost deafening. Draco fought the urge to got back inside and slam the door. Instead Harry guided him forward, Potter ignoring all the questions being slung his way, no matter how invasive or rude they were. Harry kept his shoulders back and his head high as if daring them to print one bad word against him.
There had been some speculation about what would happen to Potter's career, but the English skater had been remarkably quiet about the whole thing. It had been six months and not a word to the press about it. His coach, Minerva McGonagall, had stayed remarkably tight-lipped about the whole thing as well. All his posts on his Instagram had just been of his family and friends, nothing whatsoever about skating. At least not until that night.
Draco glanced over at Harry and sighed. “I don’t know if this makes everything more or less confusing than it was.”
"I don't think you could handle that amount of competition," Harry quipped, sliding his hand out of Draco's and skating backwards to take his place at center ice.
"You –" Harry groaned in frustration and tugged his fingers through his messy hair. "That night after the banquet when you took me back to your hotel room and we snogged. You had no idea what that night meant to me. You were like a God to me and I looked up to you. Then you left me there all alone without saying a word to me, and I realized what a sodding fool I'd been thinking I meant anything to you. It fucked with my head and that's why I missed my jump." Harry glanced up at Draco, tears sliding down his cheeks. He laughed awkwardly and wiped them away with his sleeve, but more fell despite his best efforts. "Your free skate was right after mine so you were standing there waiting to go next. The moment I saw you, I lost my footing and that's why I had my accident. And all this time, not a word from you, but then you show up here and you make me think you care about me again."
Harry put his arms around Draco's shoulders and pressed their foreheads together. "And you're certain you won't miss skating in competitions?"
Harry laughed and shook his head. “With everything I’ve been through this is hardly enough to surprise me.”
Draco’s brow furrowed in confusion. He couldn’t recall saying anything of the kind. And why did it sound like
“Likewise,” Draco shot back, watching Harry smile faintly. It had been four years since he’d last attended Hogwarts with Potter and yet they still couldn’t help falling into their old schoolyard bickering. Something about it was almost comforting. “Cream and sugar?”
“I suppose,” Draco said, glancing around the room and noticing quite a few sets of eyes staring at them. He tightened his grip on his book and elected to ignore them.
Draco watched from the side as Harry went up onto the podium to receive his first place medal. The cameras flashed and Draco cocked his head to the side, taking it all in. He thought he might feel something, an ache in his chest or some type of jealousy. Instead, all he felt was the love he had for Harry as he stood at the top of the podium with Viktor and Cedric on either side.
Draco felt his own nerves ratchet up when it became time for the quad flip. He knew how bad Harry wanted to land it, and Draco felt his breath hitch as it got closer. Harry had good speed going into the jump and he just had to keep up his momentum. As he landed, one hand touched the ice, but at least he hadn't fallen. Still, Draco could see how visibly upset Harry was as he finished out the program.
Harry shrugged. “You don’t want to shag, you don’t want to talk about marriage, neither of can see the weather so that’s out. Do you have a better idea for passing the time?”
"Come in," Draco said, tugging Harry inside. He was excited to show Harry around and share this part of his life with him. He gave Harry a quick tour of his flat and hoped that Harry loved it as much as he did. It had a balcony with a spectacular view of the Seine. He wanted nothing more than to sit at the little two-person table out there, drinking coffee and watching the river.
Draco laughed and finally managed to get his key out of the door. He kicked it shut behind him and pressed Harry up against the closest available wall. "I love you," he said and cupped Harry's face in his hands, tilting it perfectly so that he could control the kiss. Harry's arms fell limply to his sides and he moaned against Draco's mouth.
"You said anything I want," Harry reminded him, wrapping his legs around Draco's waist and using them to pull Draco more fully on top of him. "Come on, I won't break and the competition isn't for a few days."
"Harry!" Mrs. Potter said, waving him over. "This is Draco. He's booked the Slytherin room for the time being."
"It's worse than that, father," Draco said, keeping his voice as even as possible. "I'm not just fucking him – I'm also in love with him." Draco let his lips curl into the distinct Malfoy sneer. "Just wait until the papers hear about that."
"Aren't you two just adorable?" Blaise cooed, clasping his hands together. "I never thought I'd see you two doing more than hate fucking each other."
"You didn't even tell them you were taking a year off?" Pansy asked, raising a skeptical eyebrow at him.
"Harry!" Draco threw his arms around him and hugged him tightly. "You don't know how happy I am to hear that!"
Draco looked around the room, slightly stunned that he hadn't gotten more of a response. What was wrong with these people? "And I expect you to make it to the Grand Prix Final and win gold. It shouldn't be too difficult since I won't be competing myself. Facile."
Draco’s brow furrowed in confusion until Harry leaned forward and kissed him. The flashes on the cameras went crazy to capture the moment. Draco slid his eyes shut and tried to block out everything that wasn’t Harry. Harry pulled back and laughed softly before disapparating them both, their bodies twisting around each other, the rest of the world falling away until it was just the two of them.
Draco dropped his hand and cocked his head to the side, studying Harry in his body. “Don’t pretend like this isn’t a big deal, Potter. It’s infuriating. You’re acting as if you don’t
"Mm, you're a really good teacher," Harry murmured softly between kisses. "Maybe you should be my coach."
Harry landed the jump, but a moment later his hand touched the ice briefly to stabilize himself. It would mean a deduction in points, but he definitely had enough rotations for it to count as a quad. Draco had never felt anything quite like this – a heart pounding rush of emotion – not even during his own skating career. When Harry finished out his routine, Draco was already moving, rushing to meet Harry as he got off the ice.
"Of course," Draco whispered, clasping his hand in the back of Harry's hair and bringing their lips together. This was nothing like the chaste kiss they had shared in front of the cameras. Already it was something deeper, something heated, Draco licking his way into Harry's mouth to claim what Harry had offered gladly.
“There is one way in and out of this flat, Potter,” Draco said, sighing heavily. “It’s the front door.”
Harry's free skate had more jumps in the second half to up the degree of difficulty. If he didn't pull himself together, he would never make it through them all. Draco felt his heart pounding and he wanted nothing more than to hide his eyes behind his fingers like a child watching a scary movie. But there was no way he could look anywhere except at Harry in that moment, even if it made his stomach clench.
Harry sighed. “Ron and Hermione switched bodies a few months back. So did Seamus and Dean. You’ve heard the stories. We’re –“
“We’ll see,” Draco said, slipping past Harry and out into the hallway. Harry followed him and they stood together at the front door. Draco glanced at Harry nervously, wondering if perhaps Harry was having second thoughts. “We won’t be able to disapparate until we’re a block from my flat. Tell me now if you want to make a run for it.”
“I’m not the one having a strop in his bedroom,” Harry said with a smirk. Draco very much wanted to walk over and slap it off Potter’s face. He imagined it would make a very pleasing sound and cause a very nice mark on Potter’s cheek. “Is now one of those times when you hate me?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Yeah, next time,” he repeated, tugging on Draco’s arm until Draco moved and settled next to Harry on the bed. Potter arranged them so they were pressed up against each other with Potter half on top of him, one of Potter’s legs thrown of Draco’s, his arm around Draco’s middle.
“I am glad to still be alive,” Draco told him, letting Potter off the hook just slightly. “Despite everything.”
“Draco, I…” Harry pushed his glasses up to his forehead and rubbed the heels of his hands into his eyes hard. He wiped away the tears quickly as if he was embarrassed to let Draco see them. “Fuck.”
Making a decision, Draco went to the rink office where Hermione was doing the accounting. She glanced up when Draco entered the office and smiled politely at him. "Did you need something, Draco?"
“A list you’ve been number one in for the past three years running,” Draco scoffed, transferring some bacon onto a plate and slapping Potter’s hand when he tried to reach for it.
Blaise laughed and walked over to Harry’s bed. He put his finger under Harry’s chin and tilted it up, pressing their lips together. “Thought I might have tired you out too much last night, Draco. It was fun though, wasn’t it?”
Draco awoke the next morning in the hotel room he was sharing with Harry. He was spooning Harry with his nose pressed against Harry's nape and his hand resting on Harry's chest just over his heart. It was quickly becoming Draco's favorite way to start the morning. He'd gotten spoiled in Paris when they were sharing Draco's apartment and then when they'd gone back to London, Draco had slept in Harry's bed every night. All the time in London spent trying to find a way past Harry's defenses and he'd finally gotten there. He felt complete in a way he never had before with another partner.
Harry leaned forward, placing his elbows on his thighs, fixing Draco with a challenging stare. “Just try and get rid of me.”
here! Besides, they clearly already know you’re here. The longer you stay the more it looks like…like…”
“Enjoying not being you,” Draco quipped, getting to the end of the scar and moving his finger back up to the top to trace it again. They’d decided last night that the best course of action would be for both of them to stay the night just in case they didn’t switch their bodies back. If they woke up still as each other they would go to the infirmary first thing. It seemed like that wouldn’t be necessary anymore and that meant that they really were soulmates.
Draco sighed and rubbed his temples. Even though sleep still evaded him most nights, it didn’t mean he wanted drunk wizards showing up at his flat at all hours. He especially didn't want this particular drunk wizard on his doorstep. “I haven’t the foggiest, Potter.”
Draco fought the urge to roll his eyes. “If you think that owl would get  anywhere without being intercepted you’re a fool.”
“You feeling alright?” Ron asked, wrinkling his nose. “There’s plenty of other seats if you don’t want to sit next to
"How long are you going to keep me waiting?" Draco asked, softening his tone slightly. "You're better than everyone here. Show them."
"About that…" Draco carded his fingers through his hair nervously. "I don't know if it will just be the one year."
Draco felt his cheeks heat with embarrassment. He should have cast a silencing charm. If he’d had his wits about him a bit more he would have remembered that. It wasn’t like him to be so careless.
Harry brushed his fingers over it softly as if he touched them with enough reverence they might disappear on their own. His eyes flickered up to meet Draco’s and the heated expression from moments ago was gone and replaced with something unbelievably sad. Draco worried for a moment it was pity but at a closer look it seemed something more like guilt. Draco wasn’t interested in either so he rolled his hips suggestively. “Come on, Potter, I believe you were on your way to sucking my cock.”
He let his mind wander back to the kitchen where Harry had kissed him. He let it play out different in his head, pressing Potter against the kitchen counter and fucking him roughly while Potter begged for it. Draco came with a gasp, tugging his cock to completion. As he washed the evidence away in the sink, he wondered if Harry was doing the same.
His declaration was met with a moment of silence before Mrs. Potter cleared her throat. "Well isn't that nice, Harry? You were just saying the other day you were thinking of going in a different direction. You know, since Minerva has so many students and can't really give you the one-on-one training you need."
He pulled off and sucked in a breath, resting his forehead against Harry's hip for a moment. Then he stood back up and tugged Harry to the bed. "Mon coeur," Draco whispered, gently pushing Harry down and climbing on top of him. "Mon coeur est à toi."
Draco shoved the glasses onto his face and suddenly the world went into focus. He glanced around and realized why all he’d been able to see was red. He was in the Gryffindor dormitories instead of his own. But why on Earth had he fallen asleep here? Was it some sort of plot between Potter and Weasley? Had they hexed him?”
“Well I can’t have you running your mouth, can I?” Draco hissed at him quietly. “You’ll give everything away.”
"It doesn't always have to be about love," Draco said, gently pushing Bruno away as he put his paws up on Draco’s legs and tried to steal some food. "No begging."
"I won't," Draco promised, wrapping his hand around Harry's cock and slowly stroking him. He could feel Harry shivering under him every time Draco swiped his thumb over the head. He did a few experimental thrusts and was rewarded with Harry making little mewling noises under him. Harry dropped onto his elbows, grabbed a pillow and pressed his face into it,, his back arched enticingly, ass still in the air.
Draco and Harry went crashing into Draco's apartment, their lips locked on each other as Draco struggled to get his key out of the door. Harry was hanging off Draco with his arms around his neck, his cheeks flushed and his mouth tasting of champagne. Harry had placed third, a bronze medal to go along with his silver, and they had done a bit of celebrating afterwards.
"I – well – I – " Harry stammered, his face going a bit red. Draco had to keep from laughing or telling Harry just how adorable he was. Something behind Harry's head caught Draco's eye and he stepped around Harry to take a closer look. "No! I – Oh god!"
Harry exhaled loudly in exasperation. "You must know what I mean. You kissed me for the whole world to see and since then you haven't done so much as hold my hand. I'm not going to lie – I expected a little more than that – especially now that you've got me alone in your flat."
Harry joined him a few moments later and warmed up his own food. They sat in silence, eating their breakfast and drinking their coffee. If Draco closed his eyes it almost felt like he was blissfully alone and not in the company of one of the most infuriating people he had ever met.
Draco took Harry deep, his nose bumping up against the trimmed bit of pubic hair at the base. He kept his eyes trained on Harry as he deep-throated his cock, pressing his tongue against the underside and massaging it. Harry had his eyes screwed shut as he made little mewling noises. Draco couldn't help feeling a bit smug that he'd gotten Harry worked up so quickly.
Harry sighed. “Fine, I’ll leave you be. Let me know when you’re through having your little tantrum.”
After the party, Draco dragged Harry back to his room, the two of them laughing and stumbling over their own feet. While Draco fumbled the key card into the slot, Harry squeezed in close behind him, making his interest known, pressing sloppy kisses to Draco's neck. Once Draco finally succeeded in opening the door, he shoved Harry inside and led him over to the bed.
"Draco…are you crying?" Harry asked, clearly surprised. Draco couldn't remember ever crying in front of Harry before. It must have been quite the sight.
Draco froze for a few seconds, his mind whirling with questions, and then he reacted. He shoved Harry back, taking some satisfaction at watching Harry stumble. “What the hell, Potter!”
"You don't have to say anything," Harry said quietly, wiping the tears away from his cheeks. "You asked me to trust you, and I do. But it goes both ways, Draco. You have to put a little faith in me too."
“Don’t say it,” Draco snapped at him, his whole body tensing up just thinking about it. “Don’t be ridiculous. We couldn’t possibly be…”
Harry grinned as Draco walked over. “Fine,” he conceded, undoing the top button on Draco’s shirt so it was no longer buttoned up to this throat. “But I might not be responsible for my actions once we get back here.”
It wasn't until they neared the final jump that Draco began to get nervous. It was another quad flip and based on how things went the day before, Draco didn't want Harry  upset again if he didn't land it. Draco held his breath and released it in a surprised gasp when Harry landed the jump perfectly. Draco covered his mouth with his hand, the ring Harry had chosen for him resting against his lip. He would have sworn he'd never witnessed anything as extraordinary in his life.
As Harry's music began, Draco could tell that he was different. At the qualifier, Harry had been able to just focus on skating and not get bogged down in the competition. It was all just about scoring points with no medals involved. This time, though, there was a chance to get on the podium, and Harry was skating like a real competitor.
Draco stood beside Harry at the pre-competition banquet. Harry was very deliberately not drinking after what had happened last year, but Draco had decided to partake in a little champagne.
Draco had about half an hour without Potter breathing down his neck before the Savior appeared back in his doorway. “I’m bored.”
"This is nothing like last time," Harry murmured, pressing a few kisses along Draco's jawline. "This time you'll stay with me."
"Considering the whole world of figure skating has gone crazy wondering that, kind of, yeah," Harry said, glancing shyly over at Draco.
“I’m not done,” Draco snapped at him. Honestly, Harry was absolutely infuriating. Draco wondered how Weasley and Granger could stand it. “You saved everyone at Hogwarts, year after year, defeating the Dark Lord. It was the one thing you were good for at school and you always came through except for me. You never saved me.”
He barely had enough energy to pitch the condom in the rubbish bin and do a rudimentary clean up before he passed out with Harry in his arms. Before he fell asleep all he could think was that he wished this could be all the time. That Harry would be there in the flat Draco loved and belong to him completely.
The kettle began to whistle and Draco carefully slid past Harry to get two cups down from the shelf. He dropped a teabag into each and then poured the water over it. He could feel Harry watching him, his gaze almost like a physical weight on Draco’s skin. “So why did you kiss me then?” Draco couldn’t help himself from asking. “Years of pent up regression finally bubbling to the surface? Or am I just that enticing that you couldn’t help yourself?”
Harry rolled his eyes and stepped into the room. Draco watched in horror as Potter came over and crawled onto the bed, sitting at the end of it and looking at Draco. “There’s twice as many reporters as there were this morning,” Harry informed him.
Draco took Harry’s hand, warm and solid in his own, holding it tightly. “Come on, Potter. Your public awaits.”
“I tried and failed to tame this fucking monster you call hair, Potter,” Draco said, blowing some of the unruly fringe off his forehead. “Honestly, how do you live like this?”
Harry huffed in amusement and kissed Draco again. “As if I’d expect you to let me get away with anything.”
Draco shook his head. He’d rather go outside and streak naked for the reporters before he’d tell Harry any of that. “I thought you’d be better at this,” Draco said snidely, his face falling into an impassive mask.
Draco had one final trick up his sleeve as Harry's coach. He grabbed the front of Harry's costume and pulled him forward. "Harry, I took a year off to be your coach. I've now extended that to continue on helping you. But I have no interest in coaching someone who can't win gold."
Draco liked to imagine he would handle this sort of thing very calmly. His father had taught him to be calm and collected under pressure.
"Selfish would be keeping you as my coach!" Harry insisted, grabbing Draco's arm to stop him pacing. "That would kill you as a competitive figure skater. You're going to have a hard enough time returning as it is."
“Still moping I see,” Blaise said, sitting down next to Harry. “Honestly Draco, if I’d known you were going to behave this way I wouldn’t have snogged you last night. I know I’m not the Great Harry Potter but it can’t have been
Draco’s eyes fluttered open and was relieved to find himself staring at the face of Harry Potter. He reached out and brushed Harry’s fringe off his forehead, getting a good look at his scar for what felt like the first time. He hadn’t really paid much attention to it when he’d been in Harry’s body. He traced it with his fingertip and Harry smiled with his eyes still closed.
Draco laughed and captured Harry's lips again, ignoring his ridiculous suggestion. Coaching was what you did when your career was over. Draco wasn't about to give up his career when he was just twenty-five. He still had at least two years before people started saying he was too old for the sport, maybe three if he stayed in top form.
"It's raining outside," Draco informed him, feeling numb. Not even seeing Harry was enough to pull him from his stupor. Suddenly, he just felt so tired.
Draco blinked a few times, caught off guard by Potter’s little outburst. “Well if that’s how you feel about me then why do you fancy me?” he finally asked, unsure what else to say.
"Yes, but it's not the same," Blaise said, pouting his lips. "Having you take part as a coach just isn't as fun as having you as a competitor. My motivation is completely shot."
Draco stood up gracefully with a bit of a flourish. "Harry Potter, I'm here to offer my services as your new coach!"
It was supposed to be their first day of training together, picking Harry's short program and free skate. Draco had a playlist on Spotify of songs he thought might fit in case Harry didn't have any music picked out. Draco had always picked his own music, but he didn't want to overwhelm Harry, especially not after their disastrous interaction the day before.
Harry smiled and took his glasses off Draco’s face, breathing on them and then cleaning them on his robes. Gently, he placed them back on Draco’s face. “They’re always getting smudges, even when I don’t touch them,” Harry told him, his fingertips resting against Draco’s temples for just a bit too long. “We should get to classes. I’ll see you in Potions later. Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do!”
Harry did eventually break the kiss, an easy smile on his face as he did so. He looked so content that Draco hated to kill the mood but unfortunately it seemed to be what he did best. “You’re not actually dense enough to think this will actually work, are you?”
“I don’t like it any more than you do,” Harry said, watching Draco pace. “It’s the only logical explanation for what’s happened to us.”
"Draco, darling, you're looking well," his mother said, taking his arm and guiding him over to the empty chair.
Harry grinned. “Yeah, I do,” he said, pressing a kiss to the corner of Draco’s mouth. “I’m thinking Indian for lunch.”
"Anything Harry," Draco told him, gathering the precome at the tip and sliding it down Harry's shaft. "Whatever you want."
Harry was a vision beneath him – his lips kiss-swollen, his skin flushed down to his chest –  as Draco slowly opened him up with his slender fingers. Draco's hands were shaking as he went to put the condom on and lubed up, his emotions making him sloppy in his movements. As he slid into Harry's body it was much smoother than their first time, but Draco didn't think he'd ever get used to the feeling of Harry clenching so perfectly around him.
Draco closed the book on rare potions he’d been reading and raised an eyebrow at Harry. “You’re always welcome to leave and find entertainment elsewhere.”
Harry slumped down in his chair. “We’re stuck here for a while at least. We might as well talk about something.”
"No, Harry, I'm sorry," Draco said quickly, internally chastising himself for snapping at Harry like that. "I didn't mean it."
“So I’m the next crisis then?” Draco said as evenly as he could considering Potter was right in his face, their breath mingling, making Draco’ far begin to race.
Harry stepped closer and Draco took a step back. His Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed thickly, watching Harry. “Do you want me to care?”
Draco shook his head slightly and slid his arms around Harry's waist. He thought about all the new emotions he'd let himself feel this year by being Harry's coach, how he'd learned to find happiness outside of himself and his abilities. "No," he said softly, indulging in the feeling of getting to hold Harry close and just being himself. "What could be better than this?"
"Actually, father, I haven't decided what I'm going to do in terms of my career," Draco informed him, not letting himself be intimidated. Since coming out to his family, he had lost a lot of the respect and admiration he'd held for his father. But somewhere deep down there was that little boy that wanted his father to be impressed. That wanted to be seen as a winner and someone worthwhile. "I think I might stay on as Harry's coach."
Harry's breath hitched slightly, and he wrapped his hands around Draco's wrists to hold him in place. "You mean that?"
Harry reached out and took Draco’s hand, lacing their fingers together. It was beyond strange holding his own hand. “I’m not…upset that you’re my soulmate. If that helps.”
Draco continued on as if Potter hadn’t spoken. It was easier that way and he hadn’t finished speaking his piece. “Then when we dueled in the bathroom and you nearly killed me, I think I hated you most of all for not finishing me off,” Draco confessed softly. “I wanted to die so badly. It would have been a relief. You couldn’t give me that either.”
"I can't make this decision for you, Harry," Draco said softly, letting his thumb caress Harry's cheek. "I am retiring either way, but I would really love to stay on as your coach for as long as you'll have me."
Draco had to bite his lip to keep from grinning. Lips that moments ago had been touching Harry Potter’s lips. They still tingled a bit. Merlin’s beard. “If you think I would read that drivel, let alone give them a story, you’re out of your mind, Potter.”
"Absolutely incredible folks, Harry Potter's total score is 221.58. He's beaten the world record previously held by his coach, Draco Malfoy! He is currently in first place!"
"As if I'm not under enough pressure skating in your home country," Harry shouted, the tears continuing to fall freely. "Everyone out there already hates me for taking you away from the sport, and if I don't do well today, they'll all feel validated. I've been worried this entire time about how my performance reflects on you and I always skate better when you're here with me. But I don't need you piling on and making me feel like I'm not good enough!"
“Hey,” Harry said, resting his cheek on Draco’s thigh. Draco hadn’t even noticed Harry pull off his cock. “Where did you go just now?”
Harry rubbed the heels of his hands into his eyes as if hoping everything would shift and the green of his duvet would be switched to red. Maybe this was just Fred and George playing a very elaborate prank on him. He really hoped so.
"I need you to trust me, just a little," Draco pleaded, pressing their foreheads together. "Forgive me and let us build from there. I will remain your coach for as long as you want me."
“You can’t,” Draco snapped at him. Stupid Potter always ruining his life. “There’s wards on my flat that prevent anyone apparating in or out.”
Draco growled angrily. “Well that’s just great, Potter! Why did you have to come to my flat? Now when you leave every wizard paper in Britain is going to have a picture of it.”
Harry scowled at him from where he’d landed less than gracefully. “Maybe I could send an owl to Ron or Hermione and they could bring me my invisibility cloak.”
It was the first night of the Grand Prix. Before the competition began, they always held a banquet for all the skaters where everyone played nice and usually drank too much. Luckily no one would have to skate the next day and everybody usually spent the afternoon sightseeing or nursing their hangovers.
Draco shoved his plate away, having lost his appetite. He got to his feet and stomped down to his bedroom, slamming the door shut after him. He may have been stuck with Harry Potter in his flat but that didn’t mean that Draco had to spend every sodding minute with him. Harry bloody Potter could just entertain himself for a while.
Blaise snorted. “Angry with you?” he said with a knowing smirk. “I doubt it. I’m pretty sure this is the best day of his life. I mean Harry Potter is his soulmate.”
They ended up falling asleep with nothing happening between them besides the snogging and a bit of light groping. Draco woke up the next morning and realized what an absolutely terrible decision he had made. Harry was the competition and Draco'd never done anything like this before. He couldn't let himself get distracted when he had come here to win. So with one last indulgent pet to Harry's messy hair, Draco slipped from the room and left Harry to sleep. Since that night, he had often wondered what would have happened if he'd stayed.
Harry rubbed his wrists where they had been bound tight. “He can’t be any angrier with you than he is at me.”
"It's nice to meet you, Harry," Pansy said, shaking his hand. "Pansy Parkinson, Draco’s long-suffering best friend. I've heard a lot about you."
Harry had easily gotten a personal best in the local qualifier and that meant his next two events were Skate America and Trophée de France to find out if he would make it to the Grand Prix Final at the end of the season.
Draco dropped gracefully to his knees and undid Harry's flies while he grinned up at his lover. He fished Harry's cock out and stroked it a few times to bring it to full hardness. Holding it by the base, he licked slowly from root to tip. "D-Draco," Harry whimpered, canting his hips forward towards Draco's mouth. He reached out and slid his fingers through Draco's silver-blond hair. "It feels almost unreal, having you like this."
"My apologies," Draco said with a smirk. "I had no idea what terrible etiquette I was displaying. Forgive me."
As far as cocks went it seemed Potter’s was fairly ordinary. Draco was pretty sure his own cock was longer than Potter’s – which he took a moment to feel smug about – but Harry’s was undeniably thicker. The foreskin was already retracting a bit to reveal the head. Draco wrapped his lips around it and gave it an experimental suck. Harry gasped above him and Draco had to keep from smiling.
"Oh how I've missed these little pep talks, Igor," Draco said, slipping out of Karkaroff's grip without ever even looking at his old coach. "Now if you'll excuse me, I must congratulate my skater on a wonderful performance. Dasvidaniya."
Draco groaned in frustration. He’d never be rid of Potter if this kept up. It seemed Potter hand managed to put his shirt back on although he still hadn’t bothered with trousers. “This is intolerable.”
Harry rushed off towards the bedroom, and Bruno went to follow him. "Bruno stay," Draco said sternly. Bruno sat, but immediately looked back at Draco and whined at him. "Don't give me that. You'll live."
“Merlin’s beard, I can’t see!” he said in a panic, reaching his arms out in alarm, looking for something familiar. Everything looked so sodding
He refused to stop kissing Draco but then again Draco wasn’t exactly protesting. In fact he couldn’t recall asking Potter to stop – and the way his hand was firmly in Potter’s hair, making sure Harry couldn’t go anywhere – might have given the impression that Draco didn’t want him to stop.
“My flat isn’t hooked up to it for the same reason!” Draco said, quickly losing his patience. Potter was still only clad in his underwear, currently lying on top of Draco, his face uncomfortably close.
He found sucking Potter off to be much more pleasurable than Blaise. Perhaps it was the actual interest in getting Potter off that added to the sensations, listening to each exhale and curse word that slipped from Harry’s mouth as Draco took him deep into his mouth. It spurred on Draco’s own arousal and Draco found himself fisting his cock with need.
Harry was about to head down for dinner when someone grabbed him and shoved him onto a bed. “Alright then,
Cormac McLaggen was new to the senior division that year and was still fairly inexperienced. Draco had never skated against him before so he didn't know that much about him. Cedric, Theodore and Blaise were all worthy opponents as they all had been in the senior division for years, and Draco had shared a podium with each of them at different events. He just wished Harry had an easier climb to the podium.
Harry’s eyes darted around behind his glasses, examining Draco’s face. Draco wished he were better at Legilimency so he could read Potter’s mind. Although he thought getting lost in Potter’s mind at the moment would be absolutely maddening. He was lost in his own thoughts and didn’t noticed Harry leaning closer until he could smell alcohol on Harry’s breath. Draco barely had a moment to register what was happening before Harry was kissing him.
"Of course that's what he wants," Lucius said, staring past his wife to fix Draco with his gaze. The same gaze that had forced Draco into obedience his entire life. A gaze that brokered no argument. "He's a champion."
Draco appeared from under the invisibility cloak and Blaise screamed, backing away so quickly that he stumbled and fell on his arse. “How did you do that?”
"You have with all the others," Pansy reminded him. Bruno bounded back into the kitchen with the ball in his mouth. "Drop it."
Draco put his arm down and chewed his bottom lip. “You don’t even like me. We’ll drive each other crazy.”
Draco pressed his thigh between Harry's legs and felt the beginning of Harry's erection. "I love you too," Harry gasped out, letting himself rut against Draco's thigh. "Take me to bed."
Draco held out his hand and let Harry slide the ring onto his finger. "It almost seems like you're proposing," he managed to tease even though it felt like his heart had relocated to his throat.
"Hush," Pansy said, flipping her hair expertly, a move she had perfected when she was twelve. "While you're away, Bruno is basically my dog and that means I get to give him whatever I want."
Harry turned his head and smiled warmly at Draco and Draco couldn’t help finding it infectious, a smile spreading across his own face. “Are you sure about this, Harry?” Draco asked, his eyes darting around to all the cameras currently taking their picture.
Draco pulled off and rolled onto his back, staring up at the ceiling with his legs dangling off the bed. He wasn’t sure he could look at Harry – maybe ever again. Unfortunately, Harry apparently had no such hang-ups because Potter appeared in Draco’s field of view – upside down as he leaned over Draco. “Damn it, I wanted to get you off,” Harry said, his lower lip pouting slightly. “Oh well, there’s always next time.”
Draco fixed Harry his tea and then slid the mug over to him. He poured sugar into his own tea and stirred it slowly, mostly because it gave him an excuse not to look at Harry.
"If anything I would have thought Draco was a pain in yours. Unless he's decided to switch up his bedroom habits."
When he arrived home, Draco booked a flight to London without giving it much thought. He wasn't often impulsive – the last impulsive thing he had done was getting Bruno five years earlier – even though his best friend Pansy had warned him he wouldn't have the time or energy to care for a dog. Luckily, Pansy had fallen in love with Bruno as well and was happy to dogsit when Draco was out of the country for competitions. Other than that, Draco had always kept himself in check, doing what it took to win, except that one night with Potter, of course.
Harry nodded and then folded himself into Draco's arms, his head tucked under Draco's chin, just where he belonged.
Harry laughed and hugged Draco back. They stayed holding each other until they could hear them call Harry up next. They walked together through the curtain and prepared for Harry to go onto the ice.
“Very perceptive of you, Blaise,” Draco said, walking over to his bed and sitting down. “Now leave. Potter and I have things to discuss. And keep everyone else out while you’re at it.”
Harry spun around and sauntered away. Draco stared after himself in complete bafflement. Did he always walk like that or was that Harry’s influence on his body?
"Oh Draco!" Blaise Zabini called out, making his way through the crowd. "I can't tell you how I've missed you!"
<p>Draco was downstairs chatting with Mr. and Mrs. Potter when the door opened and Harry came in with his skates over his shoulder. ">
Draco smiled and brushed Harry's hair to the side in order to trace the lightning scar on his forehead. "Harry, I want to see you win," he confessed, taking Harry's hand and sliding his matching ring onto it. "More than that though, I want to see you skate the way I know you can. The way you skated in that video with no stress or expectation. Skate because you love it and you're good at it. Show the world tomorrow the beauty and strength inside you that I see every day. That's what I want more than anything as your coach."
"I'm angry, okay?" Draco said, trying to blink the tears away. "Harry, you can't let one little mistake derail your whole career."
"Wait – " Draco began but Pansy had already ended the call. Exhaling loudly, Draco got up and went down the hall to Harry's room. Yawning slightly, he stretched his arms over his head and then knocked on the door. Harry poked his head out and his face visibly crumpled when he saw it was Draco.
Harry stopped on the corner where they would finally be able to disapparate. Harry tugged on Draco’s arm until they were standing together facing each other. “In for a penny, right?” Harry said, glancing up at Draco with a knowing smile.
Harry scowled at him, but Luna was immediately apologetic. "Oh Harry, you didn't tell me you had practice. I wouldn't have kept you."
Draco stared at Potter in surprise. “And what if I end up making you happy? Will you get bored of me as well?"
Blaise smiled and sidled up to Harry, pressing his hand against Harry's backside. "What Harry, no dance off this year? I wore my good underwear in case you and I decided to strip again."
Harry proceeded to turn bright red and Draco couldn't help finding it just a little bit endearing. He bit his bottom lip to keep from laughing. "Yes, we've met before," Harry said, narrowing his eyes at Draco just a little. "Why are you here?"
Harry was skating hard and fast, hurrying to get to Draco. "Draco! Did you see me? I did great, right?"
"It's just that I'm not getting anywhere with Harry. He won't speak to me and I'm starting to feel like this whole idea was stupid."
Harry wrinkled his nose in distaste. “I really don’t want any details.” He already was well aware of what it felt like the kiss Zabini. He didn’t really want to hear about Draco doing the same. Especially not now that he knew Draco was his soulmate. Thinking about it made something unpleasant twist in his stomach.
Draco brought his finger to his chin and examined a poster of himself. It was from two years ago, when Draco had kept his hair on the longer side, falling well past his shoulders. He had picked a dark blue costume with silver accents to bring out his grey eyes. The program had been soft and romantic in mood with Draco focusing more on his ballet training to enhance the gracefulness of his movements. Looking at it now, all Draco could see was that the long hair made him look unbearably like his father. "So you're a fan then, hm?" Draco asked, flashing Harry his most charming smile.
When Harry got off the ice, Draco wasn't quite sure what to say. He certainly wasn't going to yell like other coaches and make Harry feel bad for his mistake. Harry's face fell even more as they announced his score and he didn't even break one hundred points. Harry dropped his face into his hands, and Draco sat beside him wondering how he could make Harry feel better.
"Just the rest of the week," Draco answered with a deep sigh. He hadn't realized how homesick he was until he was back in the flat he had painstakingly decorated. He'd missed his best friend and his dog. He'd also begun to miss skating. The local rink had been like his second home growing up, and he would often trek up there when something was on his mind. It would be hours of skating until he solved it or worked through it. He'd spent a lot of time there after he'd come out to his parents. Sometimes he could still see the look of disappointment on his father's face, and his mother covering to try and seem supportive.
Draco sat up in his bed and glared at Potter from across the room. “My marital status is none of your business. My life in general is none of your business. Just because you barged into my flat doesn’t mean you’re allowed into my life, Potter.”
"No, you didn't!" Harry said angrily, shoving Draco away. "You came so I'll make things more interesting for you. You came to get me back on my feet so that we can go back to being rivals. That means, the minute you think I'm good enough, you'll quit on me. Never mind that you're the reason I'm like this to begin with!"
Draco nodded. "I've decided to take a year off and think about my career. In the meantime, I thought I might help out Harry."
"A gentleman never kisses and tells," Draco informed her. He turned his back and began to make them coffee. He knew that wouldn't be the end of it, but he could at least pretend.
Draco had never felt like this before, like every emotion inside him was going to spill out if he so much as removed his hand from his mouth. He was proud and humbled and in awe of the skater Harry had become.
Draco moved in front of Harry and took both his hands in his own. "It doesn't have to be, Harry. Everyone is waiting to see what you'll do next. You can't disappoint them. You can't disappoint me."
“Suitable?” Draco echoed with a sneer to cover up the hurt in his voice at the insinuation. “Tell me, Potter what’s so unsuitable about me?”
“Not very friendly this morning, eh?” Blaise said with a shrug as if he expected the cold reaction. “You’re always such a drama queen in the morning.”
"Oh hello," the woman, who Draco could only assume was Luna, said in the softest voice he had ever heard. "You must be Draco. Harry told me you were here to help him with his skating."
"Oh," Harry said, shuffling a little. "You should go, right? I mean it's your parents. It would be rude not to go."
Narcissa reached out and cupped Draco's cheek in her hand. Her grey eyes turned sad as if she knew the chances of Draco returning to the Manor were slim. "Be well, my son."
"And that's my cue to leave," Harry said, sliding out of Draco's embrace and going over to the buffet table.
Draco huffed, his exhale of breath causing Harry’s fringe to blow up and reveal his scar for a moment. “Gee, Potter, why would an ex-Death Eater prefer that strangers not be able to randomly appear inside his house?”
Harry disappeared from the room and Draco listened as his footsteps went down the hall towards the guest bedroom. Draco performed a quick cleaning spell on himself and then got out of bed. He went through his wardrobe for something appropriate to wear. He assumed it was some Muggle place that Potter was taking him to and he figured he should dress accordingly.
“Me?” Harry shot back challengingly. “You’re the one who apparently goes around snogging Blaise Zabini and who knows who else! He kissed me this morning. He didn’t even ask. You two must be pretty cozy!”
Harry's eyes widened in surprise and he blushed a deep red. "Oh god, I'm sorry. I didn't know anyone else was here."
“Yeah,” Harry said, wrinkling his nose at the memory. “I’d appreciate it if you didn’t do that again.”
“I heard you tossing one off in the bathroom last night,” Harry said, stabbing at some of his eggs a bit more forceful than was strictly necessary. “So apparently I’m not the only idiot here.”
"Harry, I don't want it," Draco told him, reaching out and cupping Harry's cheek. "I want you. I want to continue seeing how you'll grow as a skater. You cannot deprive the world of the beauty of your skating just when they are starting to fall in love with you."
"Thanks!" Harry looked over the pastries and picked out a chouquette. Draco got another mug down and filled it with coffee for Harry to enjoy with his breakfast. He wasn't sure how Harry took it so he pushed it over to him and watched as Harry put in two sugars and a splash of milk. Draco made a mental note of it for the next morning.
“I know.” Harry slipped off the bed, pulling his pants up in a little hop movement that Draco did his best not to find kind of adorable. “Get dressed.”
Draco arrived at the Manor at 12:45 because fifteen minutes early was late by his mother's standards. He also hoped that the earlier he was the sooner he could get out of there and get to the competition. He handed his coat to one of the servants and was told his parents were in the parlour having tea.
"You know you will never be a proper coach to him, don't you?" Karkaroff said, putting a hand on Draco's shoulder. "You're much too selfish. You'll only end up ruining him."
be your excuse. The Daily Prophet has written so much awful shit about me that I’ve lost track. If a bit of bad press is enough to dissuade you then you’re a bloody coward, Malfoy.”
"You've been less than welcoming since I've been here," Draco reasoned, pressing Harry against the side of the ridiculous purple building.
“I’m perfectly fine, thank you!” Draco scoffed, turning around and pulling his chair in to get as far away from the weasel as possible. He could feel Harry staring at him and so he glanced over. “What?”
Draco risked a glance at Harry and noticed his jaw was dropped in surprise. Whatever he had been expecting Draco to say, school rivalry or some such thing, it hadn’t been what he’d thought. “And when was I meant to do that?”
It took a bit of work to get the head past the ring of muscles. "Relax," Draco whispered, pressing a kiss between Harry's shoulder blades. "Let me in."
“I don’t,” Potter insisted, tugging his fingers through his hair. “It’s embarrassing. And imagine if they found out I like cock. I’m not sure if that would put me down a few places or not.”
"I'm not stalling for your information," Draco said, sticking his tongue out at her. He often thought of Pansy as the sister he'd never had, and they tended to get a bit childish around each other. "He's in the shower."
Draco ran down to the great hall and found his body sitting down next to Blaise, looking like a lost puppy. He would have rolled his eyes if he hadn’t been absolutely mortified of what Blaise had potentially done. He walked up and grabbed his own arm, which was just bloody bizarre, and dragged his own body from the Great Hall and out into the courtyard.
"I'm not incapable of it, you know," he said indignantly. He rifled through the pastries until he found a cheese Danish and bit into it.
Draco could feel his stomach clench as Harry went into his first combo, a quadruple toe-loop, single loop, triple lutz combination. Harry landed them all beautifully and Draco found himself struggling to breathe. He was struck by the way Harry was skating, as though every movement was new and unique. He looked more relaxed this time, more in control, and Draco hoped he could keep this up until the end.
“Fine,” Harry said with a shrug. “You go on looking for another explanation and I’ll just wait for tomorrow when we switch back.” Harry turned to leave and started back inside.
"Harry and I – well he needs me. He needs a coach and I want to be with him. If that means that I retire then –" Draco cut himself off when he heard footsteps coming from down the hall. Pansy gave him a look that very much meant the conversation wasn't over. Harry walked back into the kitchen fully dressed in a t-shirt and sweatpants and only looking a little mortified.
Harry walked over and sat beside Draco on the bed. Draco wordlessly handed over the invisibility cloak and Harry tucked it under his arm. “So what did you want to talk about?” he asked, breaking the uncomfortable silence.
Draco patted himself down and found his body was a little more filled out than normal. Had they hit him with some kind of bloating spell? He put his hands out in front of him and was surprised to find his skin had darkened. Was that part of the spell also? Strange, it almost looked like the same skin tone Potter had.
It had taken a lot of fighting, yelling and crying (on Harry's part) to get his routines where Draco wanted them. Harry had been hesitant to try any quads again, and it had taken a lot of pushing and encouraging (on Draco's part) to get Harry there.
“Is that the best you’ve got?” Harry asked, crossing his arms over his chest stubbornly. “I don’t care about that.”
Since neither of them had a hangover to nurse, they decided to do a little sightseeing in Barcelona and maybe some shopping. Harry liked to buy little gifts and souvenirs for his family and friends when he traveled. He spent a long time picking out the perfect gift for his parents, Hermione, Ron, their kids, and Luna. Draco watched Harry pour over the street vendors’ wares with a determined look on his face that just made Draco want to kiss him.
Draco turned around and nearly jumped out of his skin when he found Harry standing right behind him. “What the fuck, Potter!”
Draco exhaled loudly and went into the kitchen. He waved his hand at the kettle and it began to heat. One cup of tea and then he was throwing Potter on his arse. It was more than the bastard deserved anyway. It wasn’t like every bloody wizard family in Britain wouldn’t line up to give Harry sodding Potter a cup of tea.
Draco pulled back and nodded. "Of course," he said softly. He bent down and pressed a kiss to Harry's forehead. "Let's go."
Draco turned away, sliding his fingers through his hair and his palm resting against his forehead. "I'm not so good with people crying. Should I just kiss you again?"
Draco had just taken a sip of his coffee and immediately began to choke. Once he had gotten his breath back he glared at his bitch of a best friend. "Can't you behave yourself just once?"
Harry worked his jaw, looking ready to argue some more, but they called for all the skaters to get off the ice except for Harry. Draco reached out to touch Harry's hand, but Harry pushed away from the wall before he could. He still looked angry as he made his way out onto the ice, and Draco could only hope he would be able to use it in his performance. Maybe Draco had managed to light a fire under him that would help him forget all his other insecurities.
“You’re awfully chipper this morning,” Draco said, trying and failing to not look at the alarming amount of skin Potter currently had on display. “I would have thought you’d be terribly hungover.”
Draco had been right – Harry was even more determined once he was told he couldn't do something. Such knowledge would come in handy as his coach. He was annoyed that Harry had ignored his advice, but then again, Draco had done his fair share of ignoring his coach.
“You went through my stuff?” Harry said incredulously. “Why not just invade all my privacy while you’re at it!”
Draco knew he had to be brave – to show even a small bit of the courage Harry had just displayed out on the ice. He took a deep breath and finally released what he'd been trying to say to Harry for so long. "I love you."
"Harry," Draco said, his tone chiding. "I didn't fly to London just to speak to you through the door."
Draco knew there would be quite a story of them in the papers the next day, but they wouldn't be reading it anyway. Draco found he had something a lot more interesting to occupy his time now. He might have ended up picking up a copy of the Prophet, just to clip out the picture of their kiss. It was the only true part anyway. Draco barely recognized his own face, beaming at Harry in the split second before Harry had kissed him. He looked soppy and smitten, two things he had rarely been before. He had to admit it was quite a good look on him. While the picture was meant to be revealing, instead it just felt like another secret he and Harry shared.
"Harry, we can't," Draco told him, shaking his head slightly. He dropped his hand down to Harry's balls and rolled them against his palm. "Having anal sex this close to competition might affect your performance."
They moaned in unison as Harry's body unclenched, and Draco was able to thrust deeper inside. He continued until he was in to the hilt and then stayed still to allow Harry to adjust. "Oh," Harry gasped, dropping his head and letting it hang between his shaking arms.
Sliding an arm around Harry, Draco kept him close as they walked together to the bedroom, kissing the entire way there. Once inside, Draco began unbuttoning Harry's shirt, licking at Harry's pulse point and feeling it jump under his tongue. Harry groaned and dropped his head back, letting Draco slide his shirt off his shoulders, as he bit playfully at Harry's collarbone.
"Why you –" Lucius raised his arm to strike, but Narcissa grabbed his arm. Lucius looked back at her for a moment and then lowered his arm. "Get out."
Harry had turned his face away, his jaw set in a harsh line. “How was I supposed to work all that out, Malfoy?”
As Cedric Diggory took the ice, Harry dropped his hands down to watch his skate. Cedric was impressive, and Draco could see Harry starting to despair the longer he watched. "Come on," Draco said, tugging on Harry's sleeve. "We don't need to watch. Let's go."
After leaving his parents’ house, Draco walked around for a long time, trying to decompress by walking around the city he loved so much. He let himself get a little lost along the familiar streets, his hands in his trouser pockets, and his gaze on the road beneath his feet. He wished that after telling himself for so long that his parents' opinion didn't matter that it was actually true. He wished that an afternoon with his parents wasn't enough to send him spiraling.
Draco wrenched himself out of the bed and hurried to the nearest door. He was relieved to find himself in the bathroom. He ran up to the mirror and Potter’s face stared back at him.
Harry snorted in amusement. “Come on,” he prodded, poking Draco in the foot. Draco immediately pulled his knees up towards his chest, getting every part of him away from Potter. “I want to know.”
“What is this?” Blaise asked, gesturing towards Harry with his wand. “Polyjuice potion or something?”
"I couldn't possibly," Draco said definitively. "That's your free skate and if you have to go first I might miss it. I'll just have to tell her I can't make it."
Now that Draco was actually getting a chance to do it, Draco found he was enjoying being a coach. Sure, Harry was stubborn, and sometimes he drove Draco crazy, but mostly things had gone better than expected. Considering their rocky start, Draco and Harry had settled into something Draco couldn't quite name. It was very different from the relationship Draco had had with his coach, Igor Karkaroff, who had been a gruff Russian man with high expectations. Perhaps it was because Draco and Harry were so similar in age that their relationship felt different.
Once the video was done, he pulled up a side-by-side comparison video of Potter and Draco doing the same routine. Potter wasn't quite as graceful as Draco, but that might have had something to do with his height and weight. He had put on at least a stone since last year's Grand Prix, probably from just sitting at home and not skating. Yet, there was something about the way Potter skated – a melancholia and beauty to it – even if Draco's version was perfect on a technical level. It also seemed Potter had turned all the quads into triples, probably because he was hesitant after his accident.
Draco slid his hands up Harry's arms and then put them above Harry's head, lacing their fingers together. Their bodies moved in tandem, so close that Draco could feel Harry's cock sliding against his stomach. He could hear Harry panting in his ear as he kissed along his jawline, his breath hitching every time Draco's cock pressed against his prostate.
Draco dropped his head back onto the bench and stared up at the cloudy London sky. "I had just come off a triple win at the Grand Prix, the Nationals and the Worlds. It was time to start a new season and I was just…so bored. It felt like no matter what I did, I was guaranteed a spot on the podium. No surprises, no surpassing myself, and no real competitors. Then the season started and I kept hearing your name, Harry Potter, the skating world's new golden boy. Might even be able to give Draco Malfoy a run for his money." Draco leaned forward with his forearms on his thighs, his head bowed and his hair falling into his eyes. "Then you had your accident and I was so angry with you. I was hoping you might make things interesting again."
"Don't decide anything now," Draco begged him. He had a feeling that Harry was going to continue to argue with him. If they did that then it would be a no and Harry would retire. Draco didn't want him to. "Make your decision after the final skate when you win the gold."
The voice laughed and something was shoved into Draco’s hand. “Might help if you put those on, Harry.”
It began to rain, and Draco gave up on his walk. He whistled for a taxi and gave the address for the competition. He still felt out of sorts as they pulled up in front of the venue and he paid the cab fare. His hair was sticking to his forehead, and rain water dripped into his eyes, but he couldn't even be bothered to wipe it away. When he entered the rink Viktor Krum was skating. Although a good precision skater, Viktor wasn't exactly graceful; his skating was much more about power and that had its own beauty. At the last Grand Prix, Viktor had come in second to Draco's first. Draco watched for a moment and then went to go find Harry.
Draco watched the video again and then again. When he took Bruno for a walk,  the vision of Potter was still swimming behind his eyelids whenever he blinked. He couldn't get it out of his mind. He pulled his phone out while Bruno sniffed a patch of grass, and read a few of the headlines about it.
Harry looked beautiful, strong yet graceful, showing no sign of fatigue as he went into his final jump. Draco bit his bottom lip hard enough to draw blood, clutching the siding in front of him. Harry was already in the air, taking what felt like forever to touch back down. In anticipation, Draco’s breath caught and his hands flew to the side of his face.
“I thought you’d notice. Stupid really, but I thought maybe once I stopped doing Quidditch you’d realize something was off, or perhaps when I stopped our usual banter. No, the Great Harry Potter didn’t notice all my cries for help.”
"Oh Christ!" Harry cried out, his hand tightening in Draco's hair as the other slapped against the wall as if he were trying to keep it upright.
When he opened his eyes everything was the same. Baise was looking at himself in a handheld mirror and Harry reached out to grab it. “Oi!” Blaise said indignantly.
"I thought you came here for me," Harry said accusingly. He turned his face away and clenched his jaw, clearly upset with himself for having said anything.
Zabini’s eyes widened and he looked at Harry as if he’d just said he wanted to live with Moaning Myrtle in the girl’s bathroom. “You only talk about him
"It's okay," Harry said, walking to the side of the room and grabbing his bag. "It wasn't anything important. See you later, Luna."
Harry’s short program was about a triumph of will, a man forced to beat three tasks: fighting a dragon, stealing treasure from mermaids and fighting his way through a maze with many monsters.
"I want it too," Draco confessed. He realized that Harry was still holding his hand as they walked together up the street. Draco concentrated on bits of Harry at a time in order to block out the noise of the reporters. The way Harry’s hair curled over his ears, the way his lightening scar was just barely peeking out from under his fringe, the wrinkles in his t-shirt from wearing it two days in a row.
Draco frowned. “Absolutely not,” he said snippily, turning his nose up. “I’m saying if that’s the explanation you’ve accepted then why aren’t you more concerned?”
Draco bit his finger for a moment and then reached out to grab Harry and pull him closer. "Enough about me, Harry, I want to hear about you."
Harry nodded and then pressed his forehead against Draco's. "Gold or not – I want to keep fighting and winning with you as my coach."
Draco was about to come up with a scathing retort when a flash of something by his front window caught his eye. He stood up, thinking Zabini’s stupid owl had gotten turned around again. He pushed aside the curtains and was met with about six or seven different reporters standing on the sidewalk outside his flat. When they noticed him at the window, they all turned and began flashing pictures.
Harry nodded and flipped over, pushing himself up onto all fours. Draco bit back a groan at the picture Harry presented. Draco let his eyes rake greedily over Harry's form for a moment and something possessive growled deep in his chest. He tore the condom wrapper open and slipped the condom onto his aching prick. He poured lube over it and then lined himself up, reminding himself to go slowly and not just bury himself inside Harry's eager body.
