“Are you coming?”, Harry asked, gone was the flustered look.
“What are you guys talking about?”, Harry asked from the doorway, slipping into a green jumper.
He straightened his shoulders: “Right”, he said then but was rudely interrupted by Garrick wandering in with gloves on both his hands carrying a steaming hot cup of tea.
“And hit you with a killing curse?”, Potter asked: “No, this is a dark wizard yearning for power, Malfoy, I know it”.
“I’d get the kids but they are for once entertaining themselves, so I won’t disturb them”, George said.
Potter hurried to gather the files and leftovers from the chair and Draco plummeted down onto it rather ungraciously.
She hugged first Ginny, then Harry and to his great bewilderment she hugged Draco just the same.
“Also you were proper evil back then, don’t forget that”, Harry said with a mouth full of meat.
“Hello”, the woman chuckled: “I’m Molly”, she said and beamed at him.
“It must be nice to have a proper family now”, Draco said: “With the Weasleys”, he nodded towards a family photo of the Weasleys with Harry around Christmas time. They were all wearing matching holiday sweaters.
“Good night, Harry”, he mumbled but the door had already closed behind the man.
“How long will I have to be there?”, Draco asked.
“Porridge sounds fine”, Draco said: “But if you want I can cook something, I’m quite good, not to toot my own horn”.
They sat there, no one was talking, Draco looked around, Luna Lovegood was dreamily staring at the cake (corpse), Ron Weasley looked furious, Nevil Longbottom was trying hard to supress his laughter. Draco decided to befriend him next.
“Do you want to bring the cat or not?”, Potter asked: “Because you’re not very good at persuading me at the moment”.
Draco did not know what to say to that, Harry was right, of course, he was very lucky that both of his parents had survived the terrible war and the stay of the Dark Lord at their Manor, he should not let the fear of societal repercussions hinder his having a relationship with his family.
This morning had started just like any other. He had woken up at precisely 6:45 am, he had taken a shower for 13 minutes and afterwards spent 8 minutes trying (and failing) to detangle and flatten his blond curls, had brewed himself a strong black tea with milk (no sugar) and read the morning newspaper until exactly 7: 34 am at which point he had rolled the newspaper neatly into a tube, squeezed it into his newspaper-holding-barrel (an invention of his own design), fed his cat (yes he had been lonely after prison, there was nothing unusual about having a pet, thank you very much), put on his coat and climbed down the three wonky staircases to step out onto Diagon Alley at exactly 7:45 am.
“You have a cat?”, Potter chuckled: “Didn’t take you for a pet guy, but then again a cat suits you, just as proud, just as impolite”.
“You’re not too bad yourself”, Malfoy whispered still staring into Harrys eyes with wild intensity. Harry felt his stomach twist and turn.
“I am sorry”, Draco said: “I didn’t want to intrude”.
It had started to rain now, the drops pattered against the high windows and lulled Draco in. Draco closed his eyes.
“So it’s true?”, she asked him, staring into him with bewildered force: “That you changed, that you’re good now?”.
Breakfast was terrible, stale bread with blue cheese, Draco hated blue cheese almost as much as being locked up in here.
He looked surprised at first, then delighted: “Thank you”, he said and closed his eyes in the warm breeze: “How very thoughtful of you”.
He was a mere three meters away from the assailant when it happened. He had placed his hands on top of one of the showcasing tables to not put too much weight on one particularly noisy floorboard when his fingers brushed the wand displayed on a big cushion on top of the table. He barely even touched it but the wand started moving and with one earth shattering bang it fell off the cushion and onto the glass tabletop. Tip and End and Tip again.
“I am sure”, Draco said and smiled at her.
“You’ll be there until we catch the guy”, the man said and that was the end of it.
“So where do we start?”, he asked: “The investigation”.
“We are”, Harry said sadly: “Sometimes”.
“So this is what I’ve come up with”, Martha said and held up a piece of paper: “It’s not much but it might give you a place to start”.
“Let me call for a sketch artist this instant”, Harry said and made his way to the door, leaving Draco behind.
He loosened his fathers grip and held him an arms length away from him, there were tears swimming in Lucious eyes, his thin mouth an exuberant smile. He didn’t smell good, stale and old but Draco didn’t mind, his eyes were glistening.
“Thank you for taking care of her”, Draco said, cuddling his cat to his (still bleeding) chest.
“Malfoy?”, Potter asked bewildered and threw his Gameboy on the table: “What are you doing here?”.
There were people already sitting at the table, glasses of wine in their hands, talking vehemently with each other. Children were playing catch over by the chicken coop with grass stains on their knees and bloody palms from skidding to a halt violently. Draco saw another table, smaller this time with a big pile of presents on it and promptly put the small present he had hidden inside his coat on the top. He tried not to imagine how thoughtout and intricate the other presents may be, how much better than his.
“Please don’t”, Draco handed over the bag: “We only have a limited stock of Troll Whisker Cores”.
Draco smiled at her, relieved: “Great”, he said: “See you soon then”.
“Yes”, Harry hurried: “Of course”.
Hermione came over and saved him, talking a mile a minute, not noticing Krum at all who was desperately trying to gain her attention.
“Of course”, Lucious said and thought about it: “There was Fenrir”, he said: “He was in a very bad mood that day. And Dolohov. And the siblings Carrow”, he hesitated: “That was it, it was the five of us”.
“He might be dangerous”, Weasley was hissing now and Draco was perfectly offended. He couldn’t think of the last time he might have been dangerous, not even in his darkest days he had the guts to seriously hurt someone, not even when the Dark Lord was looking over his shoulder, demanding blood. So the thought that he might be dangerous, might hurt someone was equally hurtful as it is ridiculous.
“We’re going to be a family”, Draco sobbed into Harrys shoulder.
“Yes very much so”, Draco said struggling against the dry crumbs in his mouth: “Mr. Olivander is a very patient teacher”. That was very much a lie, since Garrick never let a chance pass where he might be justified in screaming at his employee but Draco felt it was no use mentioning that.
“He was sentenced to five years incarceration”, Draco said: “He has one and a half left now”.
His heart sped up, he was close.
“We should”, Draco said and let the rest of the sentence hang in the air.
Harry tried to look away, but he couldn’t. That would have made him seem weak and insecure and unsure of his actions, he didn’t want to give Malfoy any ammunition for his insults.
“What do you do Ginny?”, Draco asked and looked at her.
Potter blushed a little at that and it made his freckles stand out from his pale face: “I’m working towards entering the task force later this year, but I had to work myself up like every new guy straight out of the apprenticeship”, he sighed: “I don’t get as much special treatment as you may think I do, you know”.
“No”, Harry said loudly: “It’s not okay. I fucked up, I was a bad Auror and an even worse friend and I am sorry”.
“The second curse, are you sure it was the killing curse?”.
Harry looked at him, astonished: “That is horrible, Draco”, he said finally: “To not have your parents be your best friends growing up, your play mates”.
“Already?”, Draco asked and fidgeted nervously with his collar.
“Just a normal muggle elementary school”, Harry nodded: “He’s too young for Hogwarts”.
Draco nodded and squeezed his father one last time, then he turned around and followed the man out of the ward.
Draco was shaking. To Azkaban. Like his father. Like a criminal.
“Don’t you see the hilarity in this?”, Potter asked and wiped a tear from the corner of his eye: “Of course someone wants to kill me, it has been six long years without mortal danger, I should have known it wouldn’t last”.
“The commute is a bit tedious, but other than that I enjoy the work, it’s very quiet mostly”, she said, then she looked at Harry: “By my word, you’re Harry Potter”, she breathed.
“Fuck them, then”, Harry said sternly.
Draco wanted to laugh at the request, don’t move, hilarious with a body binding curse on you, utterly hilarious.
“I mean I did defeat Voldemort”, Potter said: “It has to come with some perks”, he grinned: “But I hate the statue”, he admitted and waved his hands around wildly while describing: “I look like I’m fifty and that grin”, he paused: “I look just as evil as Voldemort on that statue, I’ve seen little children cry after they saw that face”, he shook his head: “That’s not right”.
Harry blushed again and it made Dracos ears tingle.
“He is very proud”, Draco said: “At least when I saw him last, you will do good to appeal to his pride”.
Draco chuckled: “Apparently not”.
“Speech! Speech!”, he heard them chant dully through the sound of his own blood rushing through his veins but Harry was kneeling in front of him.
A mental picture of Potter with mud on his head popped into his mind. Still better.
“Did you”, Draco hesitated: “Did you break up?”.
“It’s Ginny”, he blurted out finally.
He went over to Molly and Arthur, who seemed happy and exhausted: “Thank you so much for allowing me to be here”, he said: “I had a wonderful day”.
All in all Draco was shell-shocked.
Draco turned around with a blush and went silently into the kitchen.
“Expelliarmus”, someone shouted and the mans wand flew through the air. Then a second loud bang and the man was gone.
Harry came back into the shop, accompanied by a young woman in her early thirties, she was holding a sketchpad and pencils.
Draco cackled: “As if”, he said: “Dumbledore wouldn’t just let us die down there, you ought to know that”.
“Potter?”, Martha said without looking up: “Are you having your fun with me again?”.
Lucious seemed to think for a moment, then he said: “I am not sure, fifteen years you say?”.
“He doesn’t know what effect he can have on people”, Harry said, but he didn’t smile, he was looking at Draco somberly.
“What do we have?”, the tallest one asked Potter immediately.
Draco wondered when he had started to want to kiss Harry Potter, somehow that had passed him by these last few days but here they were and Draco was all tingly and hot and he couldn’t stop smiling.
“Good”, Draco said and cleared his throat.
No he first noticed something was off as he pushed open the door to the workshop behind Garrick’s storefront and saw him sitting there, feet restlessly jumping up and down, both knees incrusted with lumps of fabric and eyes staring into his empty mug, murmuring at his hands with anxious excitement.
“Listen”, he said: “I was wondering”, he interrupted himself, not sure where he was going with this.
What was happening here? This was all sorts of peculiar. Was he bantering? Just having a playful bicker with Harry Potter.
“That’s great”, Harry said: “Who were the people associated?”.
“Very nice to meet you, Martha”, Potter said and shook her hand: “Have you met Mr. Malfoy?”, he asked, trying to introduce them.
“So”, he started: “Thank you for your help today.”
Now he stood there, unsure of what to do and looked around. There were a few groups of people talking with each other, but they seemed so engrossed Draco didn’t want to disturb them. So he decided to go and check out the house and the garden, have a look around. He walked through the crowd and into a small living room with a hot fire burning, he didn’t appreciate the fire, it was already too full and hot inside the house, the sun was burning down restlessly.
“Mr. Olivander was kidnapped by our assailant”, Harry said then quietly.
Rummaging.
“Very good choice”, Harry hummed.
Draco huffed: “Well I wouldn’t say that, granted we were friendly and got over the initial awkwardness but I’m not sure if he particularly likes me still”.
“I was not”, Draco defended himself: “I thought I was, but I was nothing but a scared little kid”.
“Would you want to practice with me?”, Draco asked then.
The woman smiled at him: “Sure”, she said: “What kind of Game Boy does he have?”, she asked.
“What are you doing here?”, Draco asked bewildered.
“Thank you”, Molly tried to sound normal but failed miserably.
“Why wouldn’t I want to use magic for that?”, he asked.
“I’m sure you didn’t know of its origin”, Harry assured the man: “Don’t fear, we have no interest in investigating the dealings of you buying your products”.
“But a patronus won’t hurt”, Harry said: “It’s still pretty gloomy, you know”.
When Harry sat down this time there was already a piece of paper in front of him. Harry smiled a little and picked the note up, unfolding it carefully. He read it five times.
Garrick turned around and left.
“We?”, Mr. Creston asked incredulously.
But Ginny threw her napkin onto the cutlery, a loud chinking sound, and stomped back into the house.
“What should I know about the Weasleys?”, Draco asked and Harry looked up from his letter.
Draco spent his Saturday trying to stop his cat from destroying his furniture and had gone to bed late after reading a new book about wandlore that was both intriguing and dull as can be, the weird mixture that makes you too interested to lay a book down yet too bored to really pay much attention.
“We have a pretty nice Cognac for twenty eight”, the man told him and put a bottle on the counter.
“She’ll be very confused and she gets angry when she’s confused, just so you know”, he explained with a knowing frown.
“I can’t stop thinking about you, Draco”, he said: “I tried, I just can’t”.
“I thought it unwise to associate myself with my family”, Draco said: “Too much has happened, and I am disgruntled with her way of acting during the time of the war”.
“That’s alright”, Draco said to both: “What are you reading?”.
Draco lay on the floor when the wardens finally realised something was wrong and pulled the inmate off him.
“It is not”, Draco said, unsure of himself: “I thought you might not have it yet”.
“Good to see you too, Ron”, Harry said and waved across the room, where Hermione Granger tried to politely shove people out of her way.
“Well I’ll have to check if we have any”, he said to his own surprise and – worse of all – a small grin curling his lips.
“I’m exhausted”, he said: “I think I’m going to head to sleep”.
“Maybe she had to work longer”, Harry said as he looked around the room, shrugging out of his coat.
Dracos heart fluttered again, cold it be Harry? But why would he want to see Lucious as well? He deflated immediately.
Harry smiled at him: “There was an incident about fifteen years back”, he explained: “There was an attack on two muggle teenagers, you were cited as a witness where the wand that attacked your son was left behind, do you remember the incident?”.
“Yes”, he said: “I’m ready”.
That’s how he came to know that a Gameboy was illuminating this particular face. And what a face it was.
“Is this your version of a sick joke?”, Harry bellowed.
“We don’t want to be late, do we?”, Harry asked and put on his shoes: “We have to apparate a good mile away, there are still strong protections around the Burrow”.
“But she’s not going to serve time?”, Draco asked.
“Are you one of the bad Malfoys?”, Teddy asked and Draco swallowed. “Nana told me the Malfoys were on the wrong side of the war”.
“Fuck”, he said again and sat up, holding his throbbing shoulder.
Draco sighed: “I haven’t done anything, father, I’m in protective custody”.
Draco blushed: “No it’s not that”, he said: “I’d just like to be prepared”
“Good morning”, she said: “What can I help you with?”.
“That kind of depends on your statement at her trial”, Harry said.
“So much”, Harry chuckled: “He’s a metamorphmagus like his mother, it gets him in trouble all the time”.
Potter barked a laugh: “No”, he pleaded: “Please no troll whiskers”.
There was silence for a minute. Two. Three.
“Oh no don’t do that boy”, the old man exclaimed.
He saw Malfoy raise his hand in the front of the class.
“Are you almost done?”, he asked the healers then. One was still trying to fix the knee, the other had addressed Dracos head and Draco could see small shards of glass flying into the tip of the mans wand.
Draco nodded curtly: “Of course”.
Draco blushed a little but he kept the wand where it was and watched Harrys hair ruffle in the breeze, he smelt him too, so young and fresh and sweet.
Draco nodded and knelt down next to Mary Antoinette: “Can I let her out?”, he asked and looked at Potter.
“Probably not”, Harry said sadly: “But she’s been here”, he said, looking around: “Some of her stuff is missing”.
Potter grinned: “No but I’ve been known to make you, so don’t test me”.
“Thanks darling”, Ginny said and gifted him a warm smile.
Malfoy held up his end of the bargain like a champion. It was awkward in the beginning, Malfoy would go out of his way to avoid Harry as not to have to be nice to him and Harry got more and more annoyed by that. He checked the Marauders Map even more often than before, looking what Malfoy was doing.
This man was trying to kill him.
“Malfoy”, Potter said, too surprised to bring an acceptable level of animosity into his voice.
“Don’t worry about that”, Harry smiled: “You can bring the bottle of wine Ginny and I bought”.
“We’re done here”, a voice interrupted his thoughts and Draco jumped a little. Harry blinked a couple of times and finally turned around towards the origin of the interruption.
Martha rolled her eyes but looked up, apparently Mr. Creston was big on practical jokes and she didn’t expect to see Potter waiting there, still smiling, still smelling so darn good.
“You too”, Mr. Burgin said.
“Cats make very loyal and smart companions, I’ll have you know, Potter”, he defended himself.
“She’s been looking at you lovingly for the last ten minutes”, Potter said and Dracos eyes snapped open: “I’ve never thought I would see someone looking at you like that, congratulations”.
“What kind of wood?”, Potter asked, he looked worried all of a sudden.
It was silent for a second. Then two. Then three. They were just standing there. Four. Five. Looking at each other with wondering expressions on their faces. Six. Seven. Draco had to say something, it was getting uncomfortable. Eight. Anything really, but he had to stop staring down at the man. Nine. Ten.
There was a long silence.
There was movement around him and he opened them again. Thick brown rope was slithering around his body like snakes, tying him up. Draco couldn’t breathe, he felt the panic settle in his bones as a cold shudder ran down his body.
Then he waited. For something. Anything. But the hours ticked by and the store stayed empty and Garrick became more and more grumpy with every obnoxiously loud click on the clock telling them another eventless minute had passed by.
“Nothing”, Malfoy said and Harry could hear the smile in his voice. “So do we have a deal?”, Harry asked tensely.
“Not even a little”, Draco said and kissed him.
“I’m not your dog, you know”, he said, trying to keep up the pace of the other man: “You could wait for me”.
“I love you so much”, Draco coughed out between his tears.
“The damage is quite severe, isn’t it?”, Potter said and looked around the dirt covered floor.
“Have you heard from your mother recently?”, Lucious asked.
Harry laughed at that: “We should punch each other a bit more, then it would be really authentic”.
Harry sighed and closed his eyes: “I wanted to do it after my birthday”, he said and shook his head.
“You’re very beautiful”, it burst out of Harry before he could stop it. He bit his tongue painfully but it was already too late. Malfoy was looking at him with wide eyes, little crumbs in the corner of his mouth.
“And you’re Harrys friend?”, he asked cleaning his palms on his pants.
He was walking behind Harry and from time to time the former would turn around and smile at Draco and Dracos heart would flutter a little every time. Then, after a few minutes Harry came to a stop so abruptly Draco almost ran into him.
She took the letter: “I have to read it”, she said, apologetically: “Just to make sure there’s nothing dangerous in here.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes: “Meet me on the astronomy tower tonight at six”.
Lucious closed his eyes: “No”, he said: “I remember attacking the two kids”.
“Are you sure?”, Lucious asked finally, tired.
“I have no idea how it tastes”, Harry admitted: “I bought in on sale at Aldi”.
The warden, a young woman, smiled at him: “Of course, Mr. Malfoy”, she said and Dracos heart fluttered, she was being nice to him.
“Yes”, she said: “Apart from the weekends obviously, although during active Season we do train on the weekends sometimes”.
“How long will you be here?”, Lucious asked, lying down the book on the table.
The rest of the afternoon went by in a blur, Harry unwrapped the rest of his gifts, then Molly brought out a huge dinner nobody really needed anymore and after that Arthur brought out the booze (the kids were already asleep on their dads laps, or in Teddies case, his godfathers lap) and Draco saw his Cognac in between two bottles of Firewhiskey.
Draco turned around and went out onto the street again. Then he looked around.
“What?”, Harry asked angrily.
“But not unforgivable”, Harry said and looked at him, Draco felt his green eyes on him.
“Don’t tell me you never thought of Malfoy that way”, she said, kindly.
“Me too”, Harry smiled at Malf- Draco.
Malfoy nodded and took out a bowl from the inside of the basket: “Some red wine with that?”.
“That’s good”, Teddy said and smiled.
He leaned across Draco and pressed a little button, Draco held his breath. Potter smelled nice, like lavender and lemon, his hair was slightly damp from the shower.
“Is it very expensive there?”, Draco asked, not daring to drink any more wine, what if the bottle had cost him a hundred galleons?
“No”, Draco admitted: “I’m sorry, I’m sure Olivander would know”.
“Well, it’s a good thing you now know the common life”, Harry said: “Are there wizard supermarkets?”, he asked: “I never checked”.
“I think all that sexual tension between you two has finally found an outlet”, she grinned.
Draco sat there petting his cat and felt unnaturally not out of place, he somehow felt like belonging here in this fancy apartment he would never have been able to afford, just a few meters away from Harry Potter who was humming happily while pouring the wine and it felt all so very not strange that it was most peculiar.
“Terrible as always”, George admitted and kissed his sister on the cheek: “And you’ve brought Malfoy”, he said and looked at Draco with unveiled curiosity.
“Oh nothing”, Harry said and shook his head: “It’s just”, he paused: “It’s been a while since we were happy last”.
“I like you too”, Draco whispered. He was looking into Harrys eyes, they were so green.
“I never thought of it like that”, Draco said: “I always thought they did exactly what was expected of them, they raised me to be just like them”.
He risked a look at his watch, only a couple of minutes left now, he had to decide quickly.
“What do you have?”, Harry asked and looked at the basket.
Draco looked over the railing and into the sea and wished he was back at the Weasleys, back in the field of sunflowers. How could this evening have taken a turn this badly? Not only an hour ago he had kissed Harry, really kissed him, on the mouth! And now he was on his way to Azkaban.
They put him into the protected ward after that.
“Oh my dear”, Molly squealed: “You shouldn’t have”, she took the bottle and looked at the label.
“Oh”, the man that had opened the door said sleepily: “You’re early”.
“Yes, Draco”, Harry said and rolled his eyes: “But have you never rolled around with them on the floor, play fighting, or sledded through the mud with them, had a snowball fight?”, he asked.
Yes, Draco knew, his own little place was tiny and full of junk but it was his junk at it was his tiny place, it was home.
“I’ll take some Olives, thank you”, Harry said.
Please answer at your earliest convenience,
Draco hesitated: “Your brother”, he started but she interrupted him.
Harry blushed profusely, somehow that seemed like a really intimate thing.
“Garrick is the creative genius behind it.”, Draco explained and put a small wand caring kit into the bag.
“Yes almost”, the man said and rolled his eyes.
“I have not”, Harry said and ran a hand through his hair: “He is quite peculiar, your father, I know not what to make of him”.
“Did they”, Draco hesitated: “did they hit you?”, he asked.
“Alright”, he hesitated: “Draco”.
“I can’t blame you for that”, Draco admitted and took another sip of tea: “Sometimes even I can’t believe how lucky I am”.
“With Olivander?”, Lucious asked and Draco nodded: “Oh how great for you”, he said.
“What kind of crime?”, the voice (it was a very tired sounding lady) asked next.
“You didn’t have the heart to buy a new owl then?”, Draco asked silently.
Murmurs erupted around the table but Draco didn’t care, Harry liked his present, no, he loved it.
Draco tried another smile and this time the corners of the mans mouth tilted upwards ever so slightly. Draco let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding and stared towards the doors.
He turned around and went through the store to the front door. Everything was in shambles where the curses had hit the walls, burnt paper and wand boxes, glass and splinters of wood from the showcasing tables covered the floor. He could see the dust particles dancing through the air in the faint moonlight illuminating the room. Draco, and the assailant for that matter, could count himself lucky that none of the many wands had exploded with the impact of the curse. Wands were rather sensitive about being hit directly by a curse and the explosion would have been enormous. He went outside the front door and looked around. The street was empty and silent again, no sign of the mysterious man that had attacked him.
“Yes, Mr. Malfoy”, Snape said kindly.
“Why did we hate each other so much in school?”, Harry asked and chewed on his kebab.
There was only one thing left to do, Draco prepared to apparate.
“It has not been easy”, Draco admitted: “But I make do”.
“So we don’t have a name registered to the wand”, she said and came over to them: “But we do have an incident report where the wand was left behind after the attack on two muggle teenagers. The wand was later stolen from evidence Lockup”.
“Well here I am”, he said: “I’ve come for a wand”.
“Oh my Lord”, she whispered: “Mr. Potter it is an honour”.
“If nothing comes of it we take his picture to the Prophet and see if anyone reckognizes him”, Harry said: “There has to be someone out there who knows him”.
“Are you okay?”, he blurted out immediately.
Draco laughed: “How promiscuous of you”, he said.
“Why is that?”, Draco asked.
“What are you going to do?”, Draco snickered: “Expelliarmus me to death?”.
“I know you are”, Draco said towards the horizon: “It’s fine”.
“Will do”, Draco said and made a mental note to hop into the shower at exactly half past seven: “Anything else I need to know?”, he asked then.
Draco hesitated: “Maybe it would help you to let it out”, he said tentatively: “Punch me, or yell at me”.
“Garrick”, Draco shouted, eyes still fixed on Potters back bobbing away through the crowd of people: “Do you reckon this day is getting any bigger yet? Because in that case I need to take a break”.
Fleur came to him and kissed him twice on each cheek, she was saying something, thanking him, but he barely heard her.
“I assure you that I love my parents deeply”, Draco said, blushing a little: “This merely shows that I respect them enough for common politeness”.
“Harry”, Teddy yelled and jumped up: “I’ve missed you so much”.
“Oh”, he said: “There isn’t much to know”, he thought about it: “They are very close, the family you know”, Harry said.
“No”, Draco said sternly and walked towards a semi free chair in front of Potter: “It was committed on me”, he paused: “to me”, he paused again: “Upon me if you so please”.
“He seemed just fine to me”, Harry said: “I think he missed you”.
Harry stopped abruptly and turned towards Draco: “Listen, if I thought you had anything to do with this I would not let you come, but you might be my best chance to get Lucious to open up, you’re coming with me, or is that a problem?”.
His parent nodded.
“Yes of course”, Mr. Burgin said: “But what is this about?”.
“Thank you for today”, Draco said and held them out to him.
“Come on, I won’t tell anyone”, Draco tried, but to no avail, Harry just smirked and continued walking.
“I would enjoy that very much”, Lucious smiled, then he stood up and walked over to his son: “You’re a good man, Draco, better than I ever was”, he hugged Draco tightly.
Draco got nervous again: “I actually wanted to talk to you about something”, he said through gritted teeth.
“It is late”, Harry answered: “Let’s go home, we can investigate further after the weekend”.
“Malfoy, Harry? Really?”, Ron looked completely shell shocked. “I don’t know either, Ron”, Harry sighed.
Potter smiled at that and reached out to shake the old mans gloved hands.
The laughter came out before Harry could do anything about it. He clapped his hand over his mouth but it was already out and he could feel Malfoy staring at him in disbelief.
“I hope you practiced your patronus”, Harry said and stood beside him.
“Of course I have not”, Draco said, astonished: “We had houseelves for that kind of thing”.
“Happy Birthday, Harry”, Molly shouted over the noise of the crowd.
Draco sighed: “Until Harry comes to his senses”, he said: “Which could be a long time”.
Draco pretended not to notice, looking at the stars instead.
“What do we do if this yields no results?”, Draco asked and together they made their way through the crowd.
“It is”, Harry was walking up the stairs towards his apartment door.
They woke him up at seven, which was horrible on its own, also horrible was his back, aching from the thin mattress and his sense of pride for being locked up after all.
“Why does it not surprise me that your father is slap dap in the middle of this?”, Harry hissed and walked towards the elevators.
“What do you do nowadays?”, Lucious asked and leaned forward.
Harry looked over his shoulder and chuckled: “How formal”, he said: “Do you always talk to your parents like that?”.
Draco woke up to a very small, very spikey tongue licking his chin.
“There’s the bathroom over there”, Potter said and signed towards a door to their right: “Do whatever you please with it but make sure not to use the shower shortly before half past seven, since that’s the time Ginny leaves for work”.
Mary Antoinette was still sleeping under Dracos blankets and meowed happily when she saw him.
“Scared, Potter?”, Malfoy asked silently. He leaned in closer. “Terrified”, Harry whispered and leaned in closer too.
“I’ve got red and white”, Harry yelled from the kitchen: “What do you fancy?”.
“They’re very underrated”, Draco explained while hiding the chosen wand in the highest part of the shelf he could reach: “It serves its master quite nicely if said master is, what do they call it – a knob head?”, he looked down at Potter: “And even better if he is also entitled, moody, vastly overrated and full of himself.”
Draco went into the Stall next to him, stepped into the toilet bowl and flushed.
“He’s in St. Mungos but he’s physically unharmed”, Harry reassured him: “Apparently he gave Gordoff quite the hard time”, he smirked.
Harry opened the door and Draco recognized Harrys partner, he had forgotten his name.
“Much like a cockroach”, Draco continued: “Or a tick”.
Draco couldn’t help the tears from falling down his face: “Are you serious?”, he sobbed and Harry walked over, hugging him tightly.
Harry swallowed. Why would he do this in front of the whole class? Harry wanted to hide behind his cauldron.
It wasn’t too bad in prison, granted, the food was terrible and he longed to go on stroll through Diagon Alley but he managed.
“He’s a great kid”, Harry smiled and sat down next to Draco.
Draco took out his wand and unlocked the door again, he had to force himself to remember that he didn’t have to be quiet this time and instead yanked to door open quite indelicately.
“Harry”, a voice boomed through the room and Ron Weasley made his way through the crowd towards them.
The man chuckled: “How much are you willing to spend?”, he asked Draco and he hesitated.
“Thanks for telling the truth then”, he said and took a sip.
“I think I can handle a disgruntled feline, Malfoy, I killed Lord Voldemort”, he clarified.
“Right”, Draco said and nodded: “Remind me again of how exactly this day is going to be big?”.
After what felt like only a second and an eternity at the same time they parted and looked at each other. Harrys lips were tingling.
“I’m just scared, you know”, he said quietly: “Scared that people will think we have not changed, that I have not changed”.
It became harder and harder to breathe all of a sudden, he tried to keep the smile on his face but it didn’t surprise him when Harry leant down and whispered: “Draco, are you okay?”.
“I don’t think I have”, Draco admitted.
“That’s good”, Potter said and went over to grab the assailants wand from the floor: “And we have his wand”, he held it up triumphantly.
Draco laughed: “We are not Savages, Harry”, he said and shook his head: “And politeness is one of our highest virtues”, he said and folded the letter.
Draco went over and filled the kettle.
Harry didn’t say anything for a long time.
Potter blinked at him: “I didn’t ask a question”.
“It’s Blackthorn, very sturdy, with a core of both Thestral hair and Horned Serpent Horn, it’s perfect”, he outright beamed when he reached the desk again: “It’s very loyal to it’s master, especially to a parsle mouth, maybe a bit temperamental at times but powerful and robust and perfect for defensive spells”, he breathed a little heavier as he pulled the lid from the box and showed the wand to Potter.
Harry swallowed nervously: “I was looking out for a trap”. Malfoy frowned: “I see”, he said.
“I surprised him in the workshop”, he said and led the two police men into the store.
“Yes they did”, Harry laughed: “You need to learn a lot before you have children, Draco”, he shook his head.
Teddy must have realised that this was important because he was very still, looking at them with interest.
Draco started to laugh.
“It could be a horrible trick”, Ron said, doubtfully: “A trap”.
“I’ll explain everything to them, I’m sure they will be civil”, Harry reassured him: “I can tell them you have changed”.
“I’m going to need your help carrying that to my flat”, Potter said then and flattened his hair while gesturing towards the huge wooden trunk overflowing with potions: “I’ll buy you lunch in exchange”.
“We have the sketch of the man who bought the wand from Burgin and Burkes”, Harry explained to her and Draco could see her realx visibly.
“I’ll talk to Molly beforehand”, Potter sighed: “I’m sure they’ll understand”.
How are you? I hope this letter finds you in good health and spirits. I have gone to visit father this morning and he seems worried about you for you have not visited him for these last three weeks. Is something the matter, are you unwell? I wish not to intrude upon your privacy and only inquire of you to answer me weather I can be of assistance. I would enjoy meeting with you in the near future to show you my flat and talk over a cup of tea if that is convenient for you.
Draco took it and looked at it for a long while: “It’s Cedar”, he said then: “With unicorn hair for the core, maybe fifteen years old”.
“Well, take a look now then”, Potter said and wandered around the rubble: “And tell me of anything that’s out of place”.
Harry folded his letter into a paper airplane and swished it out of the window, then he sat down beside Draco again.
“Yes”, Draco smiled: “Because you like me”.
Draco sat up and put Mary in his lap, he looked up at Potter with his steaming mug of coffee and a broad grin on his face.
“Yes indeed”, Draco said: “They decided it was better to take away his money and started a foundation with it, it is in favour of houselves and magical creatures, it is sure to irk my father to no end”, he laughed.
“Good morning”, he said and the woman smiled, she could not be older than twenty.
“This is muggle London”, Draco realized immediately and frowned.
The door was unlocked for a second time tonight as they ran towards it. Draco didn’t slow down and ran though it: “Garrick”, he yelled and stormed through the storefront, Potter hot on his heels.
Harry smirked and carefully unwrapped the newspaper.
“What’s so funny?”, Harry asked, perplexed.
Draco tiptoed out into the hallway and opened the first drawer of the cabinet. Bills. Spare keys. Scarfs and gloves. He sighed and opened the second drawer. There was tape, finally. Draco had just wanted to close the drawer when he realized it was smaller than the first one he had opened. He looked at it bewildered, the back wall seemed multiple centimeters nearer than the other drawers. He knocked against the wood and a hollow kind of sound travelled to his ear. There was a false bottom there he realized with bewilderment.
Muggle machines and how they work. Volume 3 – Refrigerators.
“Hello father”, Draco said stiffly and walked towards him.
“No Harry, I promise”, he began but Harry wouldn’t allow him to speak.
“Hey Harry”, Teddy smiled and hugged the man back.
Harry finally fixed his shirt and rolled up his sleeves: “Well I can’t leave you here on your own”, he said: “You’re going to have to come with me”.
“Everybody has been talking about your arrival here”, she said and shook her head.
“Sure”, he said: “Why not?”.
Oh no, Draco thought with a grin, she would know he was here. He would moan and snore and raid her fridge, whatever necessary to make her life just a tiny bit more difficult. It was the only thing he could do in this situation, he would have been a bad Malfoy if he didn’t at least try to be as inconvenient as possible. He looked around the entrance hall and studied the large abstract painting. It was beautiful, it looked like a rainy afternoon in Norway, somewhere far away from the next building, somewhere next to a fjord or by a big lake, somewhere where little people ever made their way to.
“I’m in for torturing deatheater scum like you”, the man said.
“Yes”, Harry said: “Somehow I thought that might fix things, but the more time goes by the less sure I get. I think it isn’t meant to be, the Baby and Ginny and me”.
“Are you going to tell him?”, Narcissa asked.
Potter looked equal parts amused and concerned.
Harry took them carefully and smelled them, eyes closed.
“I don’t know”, Potter said a bit embarrassed: “Some people find the spell a bit difficult”, he paused: “So I’ve heard”, he added quickly and looked away.
Potter looked at him with confusion.
“Do you do your own shopping?”, he asked.
“Yes, here is good”, Draco agreed, they were standing really close.
Lucious Malfoy was sitting on his bed, gaunt face excitedly facing the door, he was wearing the grey striped prisoners uniform over his thin body, there was a thick blanket around his shoulders.
“I have a cousin?”, Teddy asked sleepily: “Neat”, then he fell back asleep.
“Yes”, Lucious said: “You do that”.
What could they have taken? His broomstick maybe? He would sorely miss his broomstick and he couldn’t risk losing it. He pushed further into the black water.
“Don’t make yourself more lonely than you have to be, Draco”, Harry said and shook his head.
“What?”, he asked, completely taken aback.
“I’m glad we’re getting along now”, Harry said and tried to turn away from Malfoys face, but couldn’t.
The witch that was sitting there seemed stressed and preoccupied, currently talking to a man in his fifties. Harry and Draco got in line and waited.
“I’ll call for a Mediwizard anyway, you’re a bit too bloody for my liking”, he said and folded a piece of his notes into a paper airplane and sent it through the open window: “They’ll be here in no time and until then you can tell me exactly what happened”.
Draco felt himself blushing, embarrassed, of course he hadn’t done it for him, he knew that.
“Elder wood”.
“But in these last fifteen years he might have quit London altogether”, Draco said.
Harry blushed a little: “Don’t”, he said: “I only told the truth, I didn’t do it for you”.
“Only temporarily”, Harry said quickly, but Martha had already chimed in: “Oh we don’t judge, darling, Mortimer and his husband have been together for twentyseven years now”.
“Honey”, Potter shouted back: “You’re still awake?”. Honey? Draco blinked at Potter. Well this was a development he had not anticipated.
Mr. Creston and Martha gasped and Draco felt very much like the hero he had never been.
“Come on”, Harry said and made his way into one direction.
“Draco”, his father gasped: “Is this true, are you alright?”.
The march was long and the hot sun burned down on them with verocity but after a couple of minutes Draco could see the Burrow in the distance. He had heard it had been badly damaged a couple of years back but it seemed the Weasleys had built everything back up in time. It looked just like he had imagined it, high and intricate and like it might be toppled by a gust of wind
“Oh I’ve read about that in one of the muggle books in the library”, Lucious winced: “Have the hot flushes started already?”.
“Malfoy”, Harry said and nodded.
“Right”, Potter said and nodded: “Mine broke this morning and I can’t really work without one so I need a new one as soon as possible”.
Something furry and soft caressed his ankle and a big smile spread over his lips: “Mary”, he yelled and picked up his cat, she was purring softly.
Harry chuckled: “You ask like someone who has a Baby on the way”.
The man rummaged through his register and gave Draco a few paper notes, he knew not what to make of them.
Draco didn’t say anything, his whole body was tingling from the hug, he was very much confused.
“Andromeda”, he said: “It’s so nice to finally meet you”.
“See?”, Hermione asked when Harry didn’t answer.
He saw Molly walk by and tapped her on the shoulder.
Harry smiled and lead the way onto the boat.
“Goodbye”, Draco said and made a slight bow.
“In here”, Draco said and pointed to the shop. Potter and his partner were looking down the dark alley, the partner yawning loudly as he scoped out his surroundings, Potter seeming alert to any possible dangers lurking in the shadowy distance.
We've taken what you'll sorely miss
Harry held him at arms-length, tears streaming down his face too: “She is wonderful, do you want to see a picture?”.
“That I am”, Potter smiled.
“Thank you”, Potter said with barely veiled surprise: “We’ve been here for the last three years”.
Or maybe he was too stupid to use magic. That was very much a possibility.
Draco didn’t know how long they stood there, air heavy with the scent of sunflowers but way too soon Harry pulled away, cheeks pink and lips shiny. Harrys eyes were glazed, like he had a fever.
“You forget that I killed the Dark Lord”, Harry said: “Your nasty curses are nothing against me”.
Draco would stay alone, he had long given up on finding someone who could stand him enough to fall in love with him and Potter would have seven children, one more insufferable then the other and he would get a bit chubby as he grew older and balder hopefully.
“What’s happening?”, Draco asked.
Thinking about it he had been rather preoccupied with Potters mouth. What he meant by that of course were Potters words (not his lips, very much not his lips).
That meant it was not only morning, it was also a worse morning and one with flared up knees on top of it, but that wasn’t the end of Garrick’s suffering, his hurting knees were now also probably baking under a thick layer of otherwise useless cloth which had to worsen the pain and keep Ollivander painfully sober through the lack of white rum fog that normally filled the air. Why then was his employer so very excited?
“I will have to confiscate your wands for the time being”, Claire said and held out her hand.
“It’s good you boys are having your fun”, Mr. Creston said and smiled at them. Draco decided to like him, he was nice if a bit simple and he seemed all too eager to forgive him now that he had seen that Potter had done so as well.
“We will take our leave”, Harry said and shook Mr. Burgins hand: “Have a nice day”.
“I know”, Harry said: “You’re doing a good job”.
Narcissa smiled one of her rare smiles and warmth spread through Dracos chest, he had missed her.
Draco looked at him, Harry was smirking: “What are you grinning at?”, Draco asked.
“You could give me a blowjob”, Harry said and immediately regretted it.
“I’d love that”, Andromeda said out of the blue.
“I can’t take him”, the man said: “Ellie just started teething”.
They apparated from the same spot where they had landed the night previous, behind the sandwich shop and came to a stand in front of the hideous police building with the yellow paint.
“And you shouldn’t have”, Draco said: “What he did was not to be defended”.
The woman behind the counter smiled at him a bit confusedly and Draco imagined not many people in a suit frequented this establishment.
Draco looked at him and suddenly he looked into the horribly swollen and disfigured face of a boy the Snatchers had captured in some random forest. He felt the fear inside his bones, felt the dark mark burn under his sleeve.
“I was stupid once”, Lucious said: “Stupid and scared and I did not protect you like I aught to have”, he shook his head: “I am sorry for that, son, I am seriously sorry”.
I’m awaiting further instructions,
“How are you?”, Harry asked and looked into Teddys eyes.
I have been attacked here as well and am now in the protected ward, I have heard that father resides here as well and am looking forward to seeing him again.
Everything hurt, even though the prison nurse had patched him up pretty nicely. Some of the scars on his chest (Harrys scars) had ripped open again and she had not known how to close them back up again, so she had bandaged them up and they were slowly bleeding through his jumpsuit.
He walked up the last flight of stairs and into his flat. He was just thinking about what had happened to that partner Potter had taken with him, had he vanished, had they just left him there alone at the crime scene, when the curse hit him.
Dracos mouth fell open, wild hope spreading through his chest.
Harry nodded. They were silent again. Harry took a sip of wine and felt the warmth spread through his belly.
They could hear yelling from the house.
“Yes”, Potter said and put away the newspaper he had been reading while Draco had rushed through the house chasing Mary Antoinette: “My flat is protected but we can apparate to the store on the corner”.
“How come?”, Draco asked: “What did you do?”.
Potters lips parted into a grin. He had dimples on his cheeks. Draco hadn’t noticed them before since they were almost lost between his dark freckles. Why had he noticed them now? Because the light was different, he thought, of course, the light inside the storefront was completely different to the light inside the castle.
Harry tried to concentrate on Snape when the note landed back on his table.
“Sleep well, Draco”, Harry said and disappeared through the door.
“Bye, bye now”, Draco said and took the biscuits.
He took out his wand and severed the stems of three sunflowers, he would give them to Harry back home. Back at Harrys home, he meant of course.
“That’ll be 10 Galleons”, he said and put the box into a bag: “Are you a member of our Discount Club?”, he asked and Potter made a grimace.
“What is an Aldi?”, Draco asked curiously and took the glass.
“Morning”, she said and gave him a cold smile.
“Thank you”, Harry said and took a pen and paper from the table. He started to write in a hurry, his handwriting was almost not legible.
Harry shook his head: “No”, he said: “I wanted to write them a few times, let them know I’m still alive, find out what became of Dudley, but I never have the nerve”.
“That’s fine”, he said simply and followed her.
“You wanna know what I’m in for?”, the man asked menacingly.
Martha looked at it for a long time, then she sighed and took it, Draco smiled and she blushed a little.
“And you train everyday?”, Draco asked her.
And he had, strolled in casually that was. So damn casually. With a light sway of hips and bringing in the buzz from the Alley outside so god damn casual and alive. It was quite astonishing (and reassuring) to see Potter being so, well, casual.
Harry stared after him in disbelief. What was going on here?
“No”, Harry said, serious now: “I’m glad your father has understood what the meaning of a second chance is, and I’m glad he is determined to deserve one”.
“We will wait outside as not to disturb you”, Harry said and nodded for Draco to follow him.
Someone with character. He looked at himself in the bathroom mirror, someone who wasn’t afraid to tell him when he was being an insufferable bastard.
“I play Quidditch”, she said proudly: “For the Holyhead Harpies”.
The door swung open with a soft shriek as he slowly made his way into the shop. He was careful to avoid the creaky floorboards and put his leather loafered feet down carefully at every step, as to not make any unnecessary noise. He heard something from the workshop.
“I will”, Draco said: “Visit you. Often”.
“How do you do?”, Miss Mortimer said and sat down on an armchair opposite Mr. Burgin: “Let’s get started straight away”, she said and opened her pad.
A man looked out at them, thirtyfive years old maybe and with a big scar on his cheek that ran down from his right eye to the corner of his mouth.
“Yes”, Draco said silently: “I didn’t know that Harry was his godfather”.
“Don’t know really”, Harry said: “Molly and Arthur are still a bit weary and they don’t like unannounced company”.
“Draco”, she said warmly: “Lucious”, his father smiled at her.
“That he did”, he said: “I was just about to summon you, Garrick”.
“Oh yes”, Mr. Burgin nodded vehemently: “There are some families who have supported our business for generations and they still do, new customers are hard to come by”.
“How much do I owe you”, Potter asked and wiped his forehead, it was quite warm in the store.
Teddy remained on Dracos lap until everyone else had gone home.
He immediately got paper and ink and started writing.
Lucious finally let go of Draco and turned towards Harry, still the biggest smile on his face: “Mr. Potter”, he said and walked over to him, hand outstretched: “What an honour to have you visit me in my humble abode”.
“They won’t hold that against you”, Harry said: “After all, Molly killed your Aunt in that battle”.
“Alright”, Malfoy said and sat down on the bench again, putting the basket beside him. Harry hesitated a little but then he sat down beside him, far enough away so they wouldn’t accidentally touch.
Harry made sure to read the cards first every time, saying thank you even before opening the present. He got a magical cookbook, a mirror that told him what his best outfit would be, a strand of veela hair (Draco really wanted to get his hands on that), a mug that stirred itself, an amulet that protected him from minor spells (Draco highly suspected that that was Ginnys gift), before he got to the small parcel wrapped in newspaper.
“Oh how exciting”, Draco said and Ginny blushed a little.
“There is this thing tomorrow”, Harry said and stared at his hands: “A family thing”.
“Not well”, Harry admitted: “We have a lead thought, we will investigate that further after the weekend”.
“You seem changed”, she said then: “From the man I knew in school”.
“I’m a deatheater, Harry”, Draco reminded him.
He had not seen the stars this clearly in a long time, you couldn’t really see the stars from his flat, the city lights were too bright. He had always watched the stars back at the manor, but he would never go back there again, not only had the state repossessed it, no, he would have never gone there ever again, even if his parents still owned it.
A man was standing there, he looked angry.
Harry took out his wand and Draco flinched away but Harry just cast a Patronus. A moment later there was a knock at the door.
“I am well, thank you”, Narcissa smiled: “I have been diagnosed with an illness called Menopause”, she disclosed then, seriously.
“When would I have done that?”, Draco asked and raised his eyebrows.
“Why?”, Draco asked and put on his own shoes, his birthday present burned in his trouser pocket.
He hadn’t even thought about it, he’d just done it as if they were old friends, Harry smiled at him though. Dracos stomach twisted. He was just hungry, that was it.
Draco was by now greatly concerned about Potters mental state: “I’ve been here the whole time”, he said and shifted his head slightly to look into Potters eyes more directly: “Did you just notice me now?”.
“You’re bleeding”, Harry informed him immediately.
“Hello, my name is Harry Potter, Auror Department 13f and I have a wand that I want to check against the registry”.
He couldn’t just let the git die, could he now. Harry sighed deeply, twice and got to work.
Harry looked offended: “Well it worked before, I’ll have you know”.
Draco was brushing his teeth by now.
“A break-in”, Draco answered, then added: “And attempted murder”, he said then.
“I have it here”, Mr. Creston sighed and gave her the plastic bag.
“Of course I did, they’re excited to meet you”, Harry said but would not meet Dracos eye.
“What am I supposed to do all day?”, Draco asked.
“Thank you”, Harry sighed: “Sometimes I feel like it isn’t meant to be, you know”.
The first one had not been great, Draco had to admit, it had been wonky and a bit too bad tempered to sell, so had his second and third wand. But his fourth had been okay, great for experienced wizards who didn’t shy away from a challenge. The wands he made today were spectacular. At least Draco thought so, Garrick was almost satisfied with his results.
It’s Sunday, he thought so why was his alarm going off in the first place? Not many people knew of it, but Draco Malfoy was not a morning person and on the rare occasion his cat would allow it he would spend his weekend mornings contently sleeping until the rays of the noon sun pierced through his eyelids. There were no sunrays now though.
He went over to her.
“How should I behave then?”, Draco asked.
Or other such notions.
“Who will be there?”, Draco asked, afraid of the answer.
“She’s not though”, Harry hurried: “We’ve broke up, about half an hour ago actually”.
“They do, don’t they?”, Angelina chuckled.
Harry and Ginny weren’t stirring when Draco opened the door carefully. He walked into the flat and slipped out of his shoes, tiptoeing towards the living room.
They walked out the door into a narrow, dark hallway illuminated by torches that gave little light but also little warmth which Draco appreciated, he was frozen to the core. They walked up several flights of slippery stairs until they came to a stop inside yet another narrow hallway.
And wanting to win he did. He wanted to show everyone that he wasn’t this weak fourteen year old child that couldn’t handle a challenge.
He thought about his mother and suddenly he missed her so much it hurt.
Mr. Burgin sighed and looked around his dusty cabinets: “We have not the best reputation, as you may know, Mr. Malfoy”, he said: “We are struggling, I have to admit, but we make due”.
“No, tea is fine”, Draco said and almost fell over his cat lovingly chewing his ankle.
“How would you address them?”, Draco asked.
“I meant no disrespect”, Draco said and Mr. Creston looked appeased.
“Thank Merlin for that”, his father shook his head: “How may I help you?”.
“Dead serious”, he murmured.
“We better hope Mr. Burgins remembers then”, he said and nodded to himself.
“Oh look at the time”, Harry said then: “I better get dressed”, he said and went from the kitchen: “Don’t kill each other”, he said jokingly but Draco swallowed thickly.
“I’m well, thank you”, Lucious said: “Son”, he paused: “There is blood on our overall”.
“You were borderline obsessive”, Draco said and took another spoonful of porridge: “You were stalking me”.
“What do you fancy?”, Draco asked: “In the leaky cauldron?”.
Harry coughed loudly.
“Molly”, Harry said: “You shouldn’t have”.
“I’m sorry”, Draco said uneasy: “Do I know you?”.
So sorry for the long pause, I'm back on it now!
Harry hurried along: “It is only for the duration of this investigation”, he explained: “The Prophet neglected to mention that Mr. Malfoys life had been put in jeopardy twice that evening when he tried to stop the assailant”.
“I think so, yes”, Draco answered: “It is my duty as the only son”.
He walked over to where Molly was serving the Badge, he felt curious looks on him but he didn’t care. Harry had kissed him. On the mouth! And it hadn’t been a dare or anything like that. Well it hadn’t exactly been out of love either, sure, but it was better than nothing.
As he perceived his son, his eyes widened.
“What would you like?”, he asked: “I’ve got camomile and black tea and chai”, he trailed off.
Potter raised an eyebrow with clinical precision: “Well that will come in handy”.
“Oh, I’m hoping you will, Malfoy”, Harry said with an equally mischievous grin.
“No one will know”, Harry said and rolled his eyes.
“I love you too”, Harry said and kissed him.
“What am I supposed to do with him when you’re at work?”, she hissed.
“That would be wonderful”, Potter nodded and turned around: “Good night”, he said then, a bit awkwardly.
He tried imagining Harry while grocery shopping and failed miserable.
“What is that?”, Draco asked and hurried behind him.
“It’s nothing really”, Draco said and felt his palms become sweaty.
“Really?”, Draco said: “I’ve never been there”.
“There was a break in at Olivanders”, he said: “I’m sure you read about it in the papers this morning”.
Draco smiled and so did Harry.
“I do not know, indeed”, Draco said and shook his head: “But maybe you are right, maybe he will talk to me, though I doubt it”.
Ginny Weasley looked exactly like she had the last time Draco had seen her, with her flaming hair and porcelain skin, the freckles and the plump and shiny pink lips. She came into the Hall in a silk pyjama and frowned at Potter, then she looked at Draco and stopped dead in her tracks.
“I’m just joking, relax”, he paddled back.
“Don’t think I won’t curse you, chosen one”, Draco said with an evil grin.
“Do you want children then?”, Draco asked.
Draco didn’t know how much 3 pounds were but he imagined it wasn’t much so he took another sip himself.
He swallowed thickly, hands sweating. He sat up straight, bracing himself for what was to come.
“Indeed I was”, Claire said and smiled.
“No”, Harry said: “Not really, they just locked me away a good bunch”.
“Yes father”, Draco said, very confusedly: “I am unharmed, it was but a scratch”.
“I don’t know if he has that”, Draco admitted.
“Of course I came”, Harry whispered, not looking at Malfoy who was still standing by the door.
“I’m Andromeda”, she said and Dracos eyes widened.
Draco swallowed and stood up straight: “Very well”, he said: “Take care of my cat for me”.
“Certainly”, he said, as convinced as possible and Potter smiled in agreement. Good thing they had clarified that, Draco thought with a huff.
Martha sighed: “So far it does not look good, Mr. Potter”, she said: “But give me two more minutes and I can be sure”.
“And what about this weekend?”, she asked.
“Start in the workshop”, Potter sighed but said nothing more.
Draco nodded and didn’t trouble himself with explaining that he couldn’t even get a coffee bean out of this machine, let alone freshly brewed coffee.
Harry breathed in shakily: “I would like that”, he said to his hands.
And he was an insufferable bastard sometimes, oh how insufferable he had been all those years in school, the hissed insults and the suspicion (sure he had been right but still) and the relentless plotting against him. Draco had always wondered where Potter took the time to be so very annoying while still playing Quidditch and (almost regularly) attending classes. Draco hopped into bed. His cat was already curled up beside his pillow. It must have been exhausting. Draco yawned. Tiring. He fell asleep.
Draco huffed: “Because I was a condescending prick”, he said and picked a piece of lettuce out of his box: “And you were a mistrustful drama queen. It’s not like we were a match made in heaven”.
“Oh you were there?”, Harry asked: “I can’t remember seeing you there”.
They were staring at each other, not blinking.
“Alright, your loss”, Draco said and shrugged.
“Yes that is him”, he said.
Draco looked around him, now he needed something to wrap this with, he looked through the high bookshelves but nothing seemed to fit. He looked at the books, there were two whole rows of muggle crime novels, some non fiction, some autobiographies, some spell books, he even saw Harrys old school books, but nothing to wrap his gift with.
“No”, Draco had whispered: “It’s Draco”, he hesitated: “Your cousin”.
“What are you looking at?”, he asked, uncomfortable.
“Your mother and I are friendly, nowadays”, she told him once she folded the letter back into its envelope: “We talk a bit every time she visits your father”.
“We are here to see Lucious Malfoy”, Harry said and nodded, coat wrapped around him against the rain.
They walked down the empty street towards his flat, the breeze rifled through Potters hair and made Dracos cut up pyjama leg billow in the night.
“No I don’t think so”, Harry said, contemplating.
So when the shrill alarm went off at 3:37 am on the right side of his head Draco was rather grumpy and reluctant to address it.
He was last. Dead last, he had not completed the challenge in the time that was allowed.
“Nice day today”, Potter said now: “Do you have any plans or are you stuck working here the whole day?”.
He hugged Harry: “So good to see you, man”, he said and patted his back violently.
“You told them I’m coming, didn’t you?”, Draco asked and swallowed.
He choked himself up with that and hid his laughter inside his sleeve.
“A crime”, he said and breathed in heavily. He was very astonished that the other guy hadn’t woken up yet, between his panting and Potters earsplitting confusion it was quite loud inside the small office.
“Thank you Martha, Mr. Creston”, Harry rose from his chair and nodded at them both: “It was a pleasure”.
“You want some coffee?”, Potter asked and turned towards him.
“Shut up”, Harry said with an unbelieving smile on his lips. Draco chuckled.
Draco huffed: “That can’t be true, what about Hogwarts? We practically lived together for seven years”.
Potters eyes grew wide and he blushed again. What was it with the blushing today, it seemed everyone just blushed away happily at the mere thought of words.
“Hold still”, Potter pointed his wand towards his shoulder and with one sickening crack and a flare up of pain he had repaired the break.
“No nothing, my dear”, Molly said and ran a hand through her hair: “I’ve got everything under control”.
“It’s so good to see you Draco”, Lucious said, muffled into Dracos shoulder: “So good to see you”.
He saw Harry nodding as he stepped out of the door.
“Thank you”, Harry said and sat down.
“But maybe it’s not so bad”, Draco insisted: “Maybe it’s just some kid wanting to experiment?”.
Potter chuckled: “Come on”, he said: “I’m making breakfast”.
“I don’t know, she just knows stuff, that one”, Angelina huffed.
“Don’t be daft”, Garrick barked either at Draco or the mug, it was impossible to know for certain and limped out of the workshop.
“All thanks to me, don’t you forget that”, Harry grinned and Draco rolled his eyes.
“I didn’t know Harry had a godson”, Draco said immediately and turned further towards the child.
“Draco Malfoy, Ma’am”, Draco said and held out his hand.
He thought about telling Harry that his girlfriend was involved in this, he thought about Ginny being taken into custody and felt bad, she had only wanted to help the man she loved.
Draco beamed and finally Harry looked at him, a huge smile on his face.
Harry blushed furiously behind his glasses. Was Malfoy for real? Did he...did he fancy Harry? No that couldn’t be it. There had to be a devious plan behind it.
“Maybe not”, he said: “But let me tell you as someone who does not have the luxury of parents, you will be sorry for casting them out once you have lost them completely”.
The silence was complete, apart from the children that were still carelessly playing on the lawn.
And lonely he was, so very lonely, he didn’t have friends, he didn’t have a family, he only had work and Garrick and even though he enjoyed it that was not enough.
“Yes”, Lucious said: “I think I remember the day, it was particularly hot”.
Again there was silence. Four. Five. Now it was Potters turn to say something, Draco thought, but Potter didn’t show the slightest inclination to open his mouth. Six. Seven. Potter was still bobbing up and down on his toes, looking at Draco. What was he looking at? Eight. Was there something on Dracos face? Nine. Maybe there was dirt on his face. Ten.
Potter had a look of bewildered fascination on his face which Draco found both infuriating and weirdly endearing. No, not endearing, amusing, yes he meant amusing.
“Yes”, she said: “Soon”, then she walked over to the garden gate.
Potter had been polite towards him, that was good. He seemed quite professional in his job, that was also positive.
They sat down beside the entrance on a small bench.
She sounded sincere, Draco couldn’t help but pity her, she was in way over her head.
“How did you know it would work?”, he asked.
“So”, Draco said into the silence: “Does that mean I can leave?”.
Harry sat down at his desk and layed a clear plastic bag in front of him: “We start with the wand”, he said: “See if it is registered with the Ministery”.
Draco nodded: “So I’ve heard”.
“I’ll wait outside”, Harry said, relief flooding over his face.
“Yes, son?”, he asked.
“Well”, Harry said: “It will be Ginnys parents, Ron and Hermione, Ginnys siblings and of course Fleur, Bills wife”.
Harry sighed: “She’s looking at seven years probation for accessory to attempted murder and abduction with false imprisonment”.
“Yes”, Draco nodded, still a bit dizzy from Georges trick with the electricity: “Nice to see you, Ron”, he said.
“Is this a good likeness of him?”, Harry asked Mr. Burgin and the former nodded.
“You were a deatheater, Draco, now you’re a wandmaker, a spellbreaker. You’re a survivor, just like me, we are equal”, Harry said.
No there needed to be a way to make this all go away without anyone being harmed even more.
“No”, Draco hesitated, this wasn’t a particularly brave injury: “I fell down my stairs when I rushed out to confront him”, he murmured and looked down.
“Thanks, Ron”, Harry said.
His father. Of course, Draco should have seen it coming, whenever dark wizards lurked around the surface his father was not far.
Harry looked to his side, Malfoy was sitting there, slowly chewing on the Baguette he had brought, the lights were dancing over his pale face, glistening in his grey eyes his long lashes caressing his cheeks.
“Then how come you can’t even look at me?”, Harry asked silently.
“Good”, Draco said, managing a small smile: “I am glad to hear it”.
“I do”, Harry whispered: “Like you, that is”.
Harry looked down at his fingers: “I don’t know”, he said then: “What do you think?”.
Malfoy unfolded the piece of paper immediately and Harry couldn’t see his face from here but he could have sworn the gits shoulders were shaking with silent laughter.
“It still counts though”, Malfoy said then, blushing profusely: “I owe you one”.
“Is it true you lived in a cupboard until you were eleven?”, Draco asked tentatively.
“Hello fellas”, a young woman said. She was wearing a thick yellow raincoat and held a lantern in front of her, trying to illuminate the fog.
Reluctantly the two separated from their wands and gave them to her.
“Oh I know”, and to Dracos big astonishment Potter chuckled.
He landed in front of a big house that looked as if a cliché fairytale witch with wart on the nose and a black cat for company had constructed a big office building. The crooked walls were a meagre yellow tone with a good bit of dirt mixed into it and every window had its own brown shutters. It looked too big for its windows and ugly paint. Draco was still panting when he knocked on the front door.
Potter swallowed and Draco saw his Adam’s apple hop up and down anxiously.
Harry was changing, he saw it immediately through the door that was slightly ajar. He was wearing blue jeans and he was barefoot, he had just taken off his Pyjama top and his upper body was naked. He looked tan and wiry and muscular and his skin shifted with every movement.
So start in the workshop Draco did.
Draco wanted to say something but he didn’t know what, so he just burned his mouth on the hot tea.
“It’s complicated”, Draco sighed.
So they despised him, he thought, of course they did. This was going to be a miserable afternoon, this was going to be horrible.
Harry came out of the house after about twenty very silent, very awkward minutes with an angry expression on his face.
“Of course”, Harry said: “You’re not your father, aren’t you?”
“Oh is it now?”, Draco asked, smirking.
“Well I’ll be sure to have more panic attacks from now on”, Draco said it without thinking about it, he regretted it immediately.
“Draco was attacked”, Harry said and Lucious gasped: “Quite violently and not only once, we have reason to believe the attacker is known to you”.
“That’ll be twentynine pounds”, she said and Draco hoped he had enough.
“Wow”, Harry said mockingly: “How intimate”.
He heard muffled laughter from the window and went over to a small door that led out into the garden. He stepped outside onto dry grass and winced against the bright sunlight. He held a hand over his eyes to shade his face and looked around. There was a huge table on the far side of the garden with seats for at least thirty people, big bright balloons were magically flying in place over the lawn and fairy lights were buzzing over his head.
“It’s in the papers?”, Draco asked incredulously.
“I am glad”, Draco said and smiled a sincere smile, Harry stared at him. Draco stared right back. Draco could feel the heat rise in his stomach, could feel it hot and pulsating against his ribs. Harrys eyes were so green, so very green and wild and beautiful, he thought he might drown in them. He wet his lips and Harrys eyes darted down towards his mouth, his own lips parted slightly and Draco could see the tip of Harrys tongue stealing itself outside and wetting his lips. It was all a bit too much. They were very close, so close indeed that Draco only would have to lean in slightly and their lips would touch. Draco wanted desperately to lean in, to taste his companion, sweet and hot against his lips.
“I’m glad to hear it”, Harry said and crumpled up his tissues to throw them away.
Draco smiled at her, then he nodded at Arthur who nodded back curtly and turned towards the garden gate where Harry was waiting.
“I have something amazing too”, Harry said then, looking at Draco.
Harry looked around for Crabbe or Goyle hiding in one of the corners, but all he found were little fairy lights Malfoy must have conjured flying through the black sky.
“No”, Harry sighed: “I don’t think so, she’ll be at Ron and Hermiones”, he took off his shoes.
It was five to six and Harry was fidgeting. He was sitting in the common room with Ron and Hermione and they were talking, he just didn’t know what they were talking about.
“Thank you”, she said and tears were glistening in her eyes.
“Yes”, Harry said and sighed: “As much as was possible”.
“Alright”, Draco said and took the last sip of wine: “Good night Harry”, he said.
“You could shut up and sleep”, Potter said.
“I work as a wandmaker”, Draco said proudly and smiled.
“So what do we do now?”, Draco asked eagerly and looked at Potter, he had now completely given up hope the other policeman would ever wake up and contribute to the investigation.
Harry was waiting by the boat.
“We should get back”, he said and Draco nodded, not trusting his voice.
Harry chuckled: “But how have you survived without your family fortune?”, he asked.
“Right”, he said: “Of course”
“What’s up?”, he asked in a high voice, still out of breath from playing.
Harry smiled: “Yes”, he said and looked at the picture: “They have become my family, the best one I could hope for”.
“What is she doing?”, Draco asked Angelina in a whisper.
“Okay”, Draco said slowly: “What kind of thing?”.
They walked back into the field of sunflowers again, the night was moist and hot, Draco had taken off his jacket and rolled up the sleeves of his dress shirt.
“Hello”, he said and smiled: “It’s nice to meet you”.
Harry looked between them: “So Greyback, Dolohov and the Carrows”, he said: “Anyone else who was there?”, he asked.
“Yes?”, she asked him with a stressed smile.
“I’m sorry, no”, Draco admitted and studied her face. She was pretty, in a peculiar sort of way, her eyes were big and far apart, her mouth plump but devoid of colour.
He saw the bright light of a lumos spell wandering over the room and ceiling jerkily as he crept closer.
“Well this is a lovely party”, Draco said nonchalantly: “And a beautiful cake, Molly, very thoughtful”.
“Okay, let’s set a few ground rules”, he said but weirdly he was smiling again: “No Blowjobs, nothing illegal and nothing too expensive”.
“But how shall I do that?”, Harry asked as the ship plunged down a wave.
“Did you unarm him?”, Mr. Creston asked Harry with unveiled pride in his voice.
“Okay”, he said and took the game: “No worries”.
“You might do good advertising some non stolen items from time to time, those not associated with the dark arts”, Draco said with a smirk.
“What’s the Freeman case?”, Draco asked as they walked down the stairs.
Draco looked at him for a second then generously retrieved the wand and put the open box on top of the table again.
“Sure, sure”, Teddy rolled his eyes: “But I know Harry”.
Harrys chest ached from longing to touch Malfoy more, he wanted to put his whole hand through the curly hair, he wanted to trace the veins on his hands, wanted to breath him in.
Draco awoke early the next morning. He had told himself to wake up early yesterday when he went to bed, because he had things to do this morning, secret things.
He needed a birthday present for Harry, but where should he start, what even did that man want? He wandered around the street for half an hour without coming to a great conclusion until he saw it.
“So I’ve heard as well”, Draco said and felt the warm breeze in his face, he turned his wand around to face Harry.
Malfoy stood up and turned around: “So what is it Potter? Are we on?”.
Draco nodded and she buzzed off.
“Yes indeed”, Harry said and cleared his throat: “That was quick”, he said.
There was silence around the table when Harry stepped back. Only a few seconds had gone by, a few wonderful seconds and Draco could breathe again. He stared at Harry, who was watching him closely. He could feel that his mouth was open in surprise but he couldn’t do anything about it.
The woman blinked at him: “No sorry”, she said: “I don’t have any wrapping paper, only during the holidays”.
“So you think me refined, do you now?”, Draco grinned and Harry blushed a little.
“We have muggle friends who come over from time to time”, Potter shrugged: “It’s good to keep up appearances”.
“Then put him in jail where he belongs”, she said and Draco stood up straighter. Now that wasn’t quite fair. Draco had been well on his way to jail, it had been Potters testimony at his trial that had spared him from Azkaban. Three years probation was all they put upon him and Draco had felt that it was too little. But he accepted the sentence with as much grace as was possible and had vowed to turn his life around. And he had managed quite well in his own humble opinion.
“We were just about to go to the Ministery and have the wand checked”, Harry explained and Martin nodded.
“Listen”, Draco said: “I’m sure we can work something out here”.
They had taken his wand, safety precaution, they couldn’t risk one of the prisoners get a hold of one. Draco sighed. He thought of Harrys lips on his, he thought of sunflowers and wondered if Harry had kept the ones he had given him. He fell asleep.
Draco didn’t talk much the whole evening, but he did tell a few comical stories about Garrick and his eccentric ways only stopping once he realized that he didn’t know when, if ever he would see his boss again.
“Might you remember whom you sold it to?”, Harry asked, excitement in his voice.
Garrick looked up from his hands, a wonky smile wrinkling the skin of his face into an almost unrecognisable sheet of damp parchment: “Stellar, boy”, he said and hopped on his feet.
And suddenly Draco knew that now was the time.
“Malfoy, I heard you’d be here”, Ron said with disgust on his face.
“They won’t be exactly happy to see me, I’m sure”, Draco said.
“Martha, I’ve asked them already, don’t be tedious”, he said and Martha turned towards him: “The have a wand here, want it checked against the Registry”.
“You know”, Draco said: “Some would say your godfather is rather cool too”.
Draco couldn’t move as the body bind took effect and he plummeted towards the floor with great speed. Someone was in his apartment, he thought, someone was attacking him, again. He collided with the floor with a deafening crunch. A sharp pain shot into his right shoulder and lingered there. His shoulder was broken.
Draco was surprised by the personal question but thought about it: “She is unwell”, he said finally: “The loss of my father and the memories of the war are gnawing on her”, he said.
“Do you enjoy it?”, Draco asked.
Draco smiled a little: “Red if you don’t mind”, he yelled back.
“You almost died tonight”, Potter said and looked very happy indeed: “You did enough for one day”.
Molly beamed at him: “Of course, Draco, any friend of Harrys is a friend of ours”.
“Son”, Lucious Malfoy breathed and stood up. He stood there for a couple of moments, unsure of what to do, then he walked over to his son, who was quite surprised by the action and hugged him tightly.
“Hello and welcome to the Ministry, how may I assist you today?”, the witch at the desk asked and Harry put on his brightest smile.
“Can I talk to you in private for a minute?”, Weasley asked and left through the wooden double door.
“Get behind me”, Potter shouted behind him but Draco didn’t listen, he had his wand outstretched and ran towards the backdoor leading to Garricks living quarters. The silence was complete inside the store and Draco had a sinking feeling inside his stomach, he knew what they would find.
And it satisfied Harry immensely. He never wrote back, what should he have written?
He looked at Malfoy then. His hair was in disarray, flying around his forehead in white curls, his cheeks were flushed, lips a little wet still and his robe hat slipped a bit so he could see Malfoys right collarbone poking through. Harry blushed again.
With the highest regards,
“Sure”, Draco nodded.
Now that was offensive, Draco was a lot of things, he could admit to that, but impolite? No no. The Malfoys were nothing if not polite to a threatening degree.
“Five against two”, Draco shook his head: “How could you do that, father?”.
“What’s missing?”, Potter asked as his partner excused himself for the search of the outside perimeter.
“You’re coming with me”, Potter said to Draco as they headed for the door: “It’s not safe for you to stay in your flat alone”.
“Thank you, Harry”, Draco said: “Harry”, he was savoring the word: “I like it”.
Potter looked at him with wide eyes.
Draco turned towards her and smiled: “Hello Angelina”, he said and held out his hand, she shook it with a grin.
Harry grabbed it and shook it with a smile: “Thank you”, he said.
“Why yes”, Mr. Burgin said: “He had come in to look at my collection of wands, he bought six of them, he had a great scar on his cheek, right down by his right eye”.
“Nonsense”, Molly smiled and put a shit ton of glasses next to the bottle: “It’s very thoughtful of you”.
“Nothing”, Harry sighed: “Malfoy will stay with us for the foreseeable future, he is in danger”.
“Oh how nice”, Mr. Creston exclaimed: “And is it how you imagined it to be?”.
A loud bang cut through the nightly silence. The door.
Harry laughed: “Yes that is true”, he said: “The cupboard under the stairs”, he shook his head in memory.
“Yes, please”, Draco said and stole a peak at his watch, a quarter to nine, he hoped Harry liked to sleep in.
“No problem”, Draco said and shoved another cookie into his mouth: “Want one?”, he asked Harry but he only grunted, disgusted.
“I could help though”, Draco insisted.
It wasn’t an easy feat to persuade Mary Antoinette into her traveling cage but after a lot of cooing and a healthy dose of fish fingers she was stored away safely and contently.
“Yes”, she said: “We’ve all been wondering what became of you, you know”.
Draco looked around the room, half the shelves contents were thrown on the ground or discarded on the workbench and he didn’t know where to begin his search. So he started somewhere between the chisel and the unicorn hairs.
“Fucking panic attack”
It was quiet between them then. They were just standing there not looking at each other. Harry could feel his cold hands becoming sweaty.
“That is true”, Harry admitted: “And you look very nice”.
“You do that”, he said: “I’ll work on the Freeman case in here”, he sat down at his desk.
Mr. Burgin took the small bag and investigated its contents.
“Fancy much”, Harry teased him and Draco smiled, he could already feel the wine buzzing in his head, he didn’t drink very often.
“Don’t move”, a familiar voice told him, where had he heard it before?
“There’s a lot out of place here Potter”, Draco said dryly, he was quite poignantly looking at a piece of pillow on top of the chandelier: “Where should I begin?”.
“Oh you heard that, did you?”, Harry said and smiled a sad smile: “Don’t worry about it, she will understand”.
“How?”, Draco asked, astonished.
“Malfoy”, Mr. Creston said: “Interesting”.
“We love you, Draco”, his mother said then: “And if he makes you happy, we are happy”.
“The Adoption Agency wrote to me today”, Harry said very slowly.
Harry blushed. No, of course not. Dumbledore would never do that.
Draco interrupted him: “Not about that”, he said hastily: “It’s got to do with the case”.
“I did not”, he defended himself: “And I had good reason”.
And at that Potter blushed. He fucking blushed. A rosy tint spread from the bridge of his nose outward over his cheeks and up his temples and Draco was pretty sure he was going to die from the sight of it.
“Could imagine something nicer”, Ron said and shook his head.
“Oh too muggle for you, is it?”, Harry asked.
They clinked their glasses together and took a sip.
They ate their breakfast in pleasurable silence then, Harry got distracted by Mary Antointette who made it her mission to steal some of his porridge and Harry laughed happily while fighting her off.
Draco smiled: “Well I’ll be sure to ask him anyway”.
“I’ve gotten out of it with barely a scratch”, he said and leaned back in his chair coolly.
“Hey”, Potter exclaimed still chuckling.
Harry blinked a couple of times. Did he mean that? Anything?
“Oh is it that late already?”, Draco asked.
“Yes”, Harry said: “It would have been in London, it was July”.
Potter looked at him wide eyed, looking quite surprised by the fact somebody had said something.
Draco laughed: “I can only imagine”.
Somewhere deep down he knew he deserved it, deserved to be punished like this. And maybe Azkaban wasn’t this bad now that the Dementors were gone? Maybe he could spend some quality time with his father?
“That is not all of course”, Draco hurried: “I would like to raise a child and give it everything I never received, you know”, he stopped: “Have it be safe and happy and content”.
It was silent for a good minute and Draco felt Potters eyes staring holes into his back.
“Fuck”, he exclaimed.
“And how is your position as an Auror suiting you?”, Mr. Creston asked and turned towards Harry again.
“I’m glad”, Draco said and turned towards Angelina again.
They were silent then, watching the fairy lights dance around the dark sky. It was magical, the magic was buzzing in the air and made Harrys insides warm up, his fingers tingle and the wine made his brain twirl.
Narcissa Malfoy
“I’ll get you a slice of your cake”, Draco said and took Harrys plate before he could protest.
“There must be something I can do”, Draco said, outraged by the lack of his involvement in Potters plan.
And make a fuss she did. Out came Molly Weasley, levitating a huge cake in front of her in the shape of an Aurors badge. In huge letters there was written: Homicide Department.
“That was..”, Malfoy didn’t continue his sentence.
At 6:25 Malfoy stood up and gathered his belongings, he was shaking now. He took the basket and made the clock disappear with a swish of his wand.
“They liked you”, he said then, quietly.
“Drink up now”, Harry said and gulped down the last of his tea: “We better leave”.
Dracos priorities were not aligned with those of the wand master, he was all about searching for new cores, new combinations in wood and length, new processes of melting the core into the wood, while Olivander in his old stubbornness was quite satisfied with the way things were done already and didn’t understand nor condone Dracos tireless search for innovation.
“It’s just over there”, Potter said and walked towards an old wooden door.
There was a roll of parchment and a key. Draco took out the key, it looked old and rusty, there was no tag on it. Draco frowned, what might that be to? It could be the key to their Gringotts vault, he realized and put it down quickly. He wanted to put the board back, he really did, but his curiosity got the better of him and he took out the parchment.
“Oh is that so”, the lady yawned and opened the door: “Department 13 f if you don’t mind”, she gestured towards the dark hallway: “Up the stairs until you’re on the fifth floor then to your left”.
“Angelina must be somewhere around here too, I’m sure you’ll find her sooner than later”.
“Running mostly”, Harry said: “Weight lifting, sit ups, all the good stuff”.
“Thank you”, Draco said and took the bottle.
“Step away from the door, please”, Claire yelled once more and opened the door with the flick of her wand.
“I think so, yes”, he said: “My ego is, I have to admit, more wounded than I am”.
“Well let’s see”, he started, more to himself than to Potter at that point: “Your first wand was holly and phoenix feather, but that might have been only because The Dark Lords was as well”, he rambled on looking at the etiquettes on the boxes: “You’re certainly powerful, so maybe dragon heart string could fit, but you’re also loyal which dragon heart string isn’t so that might be a problem”, he went to the next rack: “Thestral hair could work, since you’ve been known to be quite angsty at times and they value bravery but I’d rather”, he stopped and turned towards Potter, face light up with certainty: “I got it”, he exclaimed.
“Martha”, he yelled over to a witch around his age who was sitting behind a big wooden table: “Misters Potter and Malfoy are here for the Wand Registry”.
“You still want me to come with you?”, Draco asked.
“Wait”, he said a little too loudly and Malfoy flinched.
The green flash of light hit the back of the storefront and shards of glass and burnt paper rilled down onto him as he heard the man scramble to his feet and run out of the shop. He heard a loud bang as the man disapparated.
“Father, what”, he started but grew silent as his father only gripped tighter.
“Is that so”, Mr. Creston said and looked at Draco with unveiled curiosity: “How good of him”.
“I would love to”, Harry said
“You think I’m powerful?”, Potter asked with a smug grin on his face.
“Bye”, Martha and Mr. Creston said then Draco followed Harry out of the door.
“Oh no you heard about that?”, Harry asked, disgruntled.
But Harry laughed, his real laugh, all belly and happiness and Draco couldn’t help but grin like a dumbass.
Draco inhaled sharply: “Does she have any idea?”, he asked.
“And you’re a condescending prick, we make quite the team”, Draco said and stood up, he was ready to go.
“I have sources”, Potter sighed: “And I’ve had my suspicions for a while now”, he put his hand through his unruly hair.
His first thought when he saw one of the merepeople was, wow those are ugly. They looked peculiar, not at all like the muggle mermaid legends.
“No not at all”, Draco said indignantly: “But I can win a duel, have you looked at my biceps?”.
She flicked her wand and a tray with three cups of tea and a truckload of biscuits appeared in front of them.
“I’m good”, Teddy said and nodded: “I’m just playing catch”.
“Yes”, Draco said apologetically: “I need a bottle of your finest Cognac, please”, he said and went over to the counter.
Draco nodded: “Very well”, he said.
Draco swallowed: “You can’t postpone it just because I’m here”, he said and put a hand on Harrys shoulder: “That’s not fair, to you or her”.
Harry felt the anger rise as Snape wrote something down on the blackboard. He took out his quill. And furiously began to write.
On the other half of the table Hermione Granger got up and, nodding once at Harry, left for the garden gate.
“Very pretty”, Draco said and fixed his gaze at the coffee machine, apparently a muggle concoction he didn’t quite understand. He was no big coffee drinker, he preferred a strong tea for his caffeine fix in the morning but whenever he had coffee it would come out of a simple French press everyone could handle.
Malfoys eyebrow raised on his forehead: “And what were you doing? Just watching me?”.
Mr. Burgin chuckled: “Oh dear boy, we have to stay loyal to our calling”.
“I do actually”, Harry said proudly: “But I will only contact them once other sources of information fail”.
“This is no funny business”, Draco replied dignifiedly: “I could have died tonight”.
“And what a great loss that was”, Draco rolled his eyes.
“Yes and they might be set on concealing him as well”, Draco said, unsure of this plan.
It took a minute for Draco to realise he was alone once more. He was still crouched behind his desk and breathing heavily.
“What about this one?”, Draco asked and held up a game.
“Your house is very nice”, Draco said and put his luggage down next to the sofa: “How long have you lived here?”.
So they had to go to Azkaban and to go there was a wild ride on its own, first they had to apparate to the coast and then get into a stingy sailboat that brought them more or less safely to the island where the prison was located.
“Harry”, he exclaimed, surprised.
For a millisecond the world stopped and Draco blinked slowly to realise what had happened. The next second everything sped up again and he heard a raspy voice yell out: “Stupor”. A red bolt of light crashed into the closet behind his left ear and Draco jumped to the side to hide behind a table.
Potter had looked good, so grown up but still there was this mischievous look in his eyes, almost childlike. Draco smiled a little as he put on the kettle. He remembered that look from school, of course he had never been the recipient of such a look, no Potter had always been very determined to fix him with the scowliest of scowls or the frowniest of frowns, but when with his friends Potter had always brought out this look.
“Yes, duh!”, Teddy insisted: “He cut off Naginis head”.
He opened the door after a stern nock and went inside.
Everyone was looking at him, eyes wide open, mouths gaping.
Potter furrowed his brows: “I know that”, he said.
“No”, Draco said: “It’s fine, just give me five minutes”.
The leaky cauldron opened at eight o clock sharp and Draco went inside immediately.
“Yes, thank you Sir”.
“I certainly shall”, Draco said: “How is business nowadays?”, he asked.
“I’ll take him with me”, Potter said.
He folded the piece of paper and sent it on his way to the front of the class with a swift blow from his lips. It hit Malfoy on the top of his head.
“Alright”, Draco sighed: “If you say so”.
Potter took out his wand and looked around sheepishly for any possible witnesses.
“I’m sure you won’t”, she said: “Have you met my husband?”.
He tried to imagine the Weasley girl as a criminal mastermind and couldn’t. No he was quite sure she hadn’t wanted anyone to get harmed, sure she had just invested her trust in the wrong man who had taken things into his own hands without her consent.
“No”, Draco said and shook his head: “I presume not”.
“Potter”, Draco said equally as dumbfounded.
Harry didn’t say anything, they had had that discussion far too often already.
Draco was blushing again and because he didn’t like himself blushing and because he was sure he would only continue to blush he lay a muffliato over the table when nobody was looking.
“Indeed you are not”, Harry admitted and took a huge bite: “But someone out there still is and I don’t know how we might find him”.
“We’ve come to inquire after a wand that might have been in your possession fifteen years ago”, Harry said and took out the wand: “Do you reckognize it?”.
“I got the news this morning”, Harry explained: “I’m homicide once I’m done with this case”.
Harry laughed loudly: “No, don’t worry, the bottle cost me three pounds”, Harry chuckled along and took another sip, his lips were already stained red a little.
“Teddy lives with Tonks mother now”, Angelina explained: “He’s a very happy child nowadays”.
“We were hoping a wand might be registered”, Harry said and showed the man the wand.
“You don’t know that and neither do we, maybe he comes back, maybe he wants to eliminate witnesses”.
“Has been since I knew him”.
Draco was alone.
He went towards his luggage and put on black trousers and a white button down shirt and stole himself over to the door. He grabbed a key from the cabinet in the hallway and stepped outside.
He spent the rest of the evening watching Harrys hand stroking through Teddies hair, whispering soothing nothings in his ear from time to time.
“Harry are you alright?”, Ron almost yelled at him.
“Of course I came, darling”, she said and took his hand. Her hand was dry and cold but Draco felt his spirits lift momentarily.
“Don’t recognise me, do you?”, the woman said, smile wavering a little.
Draco stood there, stunned.
Draco shook his head sadly: “No but I know his voice, I just can’t place it yet”, he said.
“About thirty Galleons”, he said then, a little bit ashamed.
“So where do we go from here?”, Draco asked cautiously.
“Are you SURE?”, Narcissa asked this time, looking at her son like he was out of his mind: “Harry Potter?”
“I could cook you dinner”, Draco said reluctantly: “To say thank you”.
“You’re right”, Potter said: “I’m sorry”. Silence.
Draco had experienced three of those mornings so far and he had spent weeks getting over each of them, not to mention the cleaning up he had to do every time Garrick decided (on those days it was about four or five times) that all of this wasn’t worth it anymore and he should just go in a home for old people to play Bridge and decompose. Those comments were heavily underlined by an angry throw of boxes and one or the other rather vicious jinx at their shop window. Draco would spend those days hiding himself and any unlucky customer who had wandered in behind thick doors and a Protego so strong it made the air flutter with magic.
“What did they say?”, Draco whispered.
Draco swallowed: “But I have stuff to do”, he said: “And my cat needs me”.
“Would you be able to describe him to a sketch artist if I brought one by?”, Harry asked.
There came a chuckle from the living room door, Draco looked up to see his husband standing there, a warm smile on his lips.
“You’re late”, Malfoy said then and walked over towards him. “I’ve been here for a while”, Harry admitted.
The morning was mild and busy, fruit sellers shouting out prices and arguing loudly when someone disagreed with said prices, businessmen in suits and polished robes hurrying along with bags from a bakery in one and a newspaper in the other hand chewing passionately on the contents of the first (unless it was just one of those days and they took a hearty bite off todays headline), there were children not wanting to go to kindergarten, screaming and begging their parents to take them to work instead and parents equally devastated to do exactly that. It was awake and loud and so alive.
What was happening? What was this man planning with him? He wasn’t out to kill him this time, that seemed certain, if he had he could have done so already, was he here to torture him? Take him?
Draco stared at him. Home? Potters Home? No this wasn’t right.
“I’m allowed to leave, they’ve captured the culprit”, Draco informed him.
“We have a deal”, Malfoy said finally.
“Okay”, he said and looked down onto his hands: “Just know, I’m very sorry”.
Draco tried to answer, but still couldn’t move.
“How very observant of you”, Potter said and let go of his arm: “Thought it was safer that way”, he explained: “Also more anonymous”.
Draco coughed.
“Of course I did”, Draco yelled: “I was there, I’m responsible”.
Draco nodded and smiled shyly at him but Mr. Creston gave him a look that made the smile die on his face.
“That is very good”, Mr. Burgin said: “Tell him he is greatly missed at Burgin and Burkes, when you next see him”.
The cake was delicious and Draco didn’t have to talk at all because Harry was gushing about the opportunities of his new job and how exciting it would be and for some reason he didn’t seem upset about Ginny at all.
“Mr. Malfoy”, Harry said poignantly: “Is helping with an investigation, you see”.
“I did”, Harry said and smiled: “As I’m sure you’ve heard I know my way around the Expelliarmus”.
“Solitude gives much time for thought”, Harry said: “He might have thought about his dealings prior to his trial and came out dissatisfied with them”.
“Will that be it, Mr. Malfoy?”, Snape asked, still mildly.
“How are you, Cissy?”, Lucious asked and Draco looked at him in shock, never, NEVER, had he heard his father call his mother by her childhood nickname.
“It’s nice to meet you, Molly”, Draco said: “I’m Draco”.
“I couldn’t”, Draco started but Potter interrupted him: “I’ve already talked to my supervisor, there’s no use in arguing, you’re coming with me”.
“He must have apparated with him”, Potter breathed heavily and looked around the room for nothing in particular.
“Sulk”, Harry said with a grin: “Throw curses at me, cry, I don’t know”.
Ginny chuckled: “I’m glad”, she said: “I still think you got off too easily”.
“Can I help you with anything?”, Draco asked and felt very nice indeed.
“Why do we have to use the Toilet Entrance”, Draco whined.
Harry nods: “Thank you”, he said and turned around. Draco smiled at the woman who looked after Harry with amazement and turned to follow him.
“Potter”, Malfoy said hoarsely and sat down next to Harry.
Draco nodded: “I need to buy something as a present”, he said: “I don’t want to go there with empty hands”.
The day, it turned out wasn’t about to get any bigger, not that Draco was complaining, he had had his proper share of excitement for a day and was not prepared to cater to any more surprises just casually strolling into the shop like Potter had.
“Oh my dear Lord”, Martha gasped and put a hand against her chest: “Is he alright?”.
“Beautiful as ever”, she said and smiled.
“Spiderman maybe?”, she asked and gave him a game.
“Is this your plan to break us up?”, Harry asked, venom in his voice: “We kissed once, Malfoy, I don’t even know why”.
“What is it?”, Harry asked and leaned forward.
They made their way over to the elevators and got in with five more people going up.
“And you’re a wandmaker now?”, Ginny asked, eyes on the Daily Prophet.
“Of course”, Harry said: “We’re not in a hurry”.
“Oh I see”, Martha said and smiled, she had a very nice smile, Draco realized, warm and bright and it made her eyes flicker with mischief.
Alrighty then, Hermione it was. He swam over to her and began slicing at her ropes, when the half man, half shark figured Krum appeared. Harry nodded at him and continued his pursuit, but Krum was faster and had Hermione by his side in an instant. He was about to swim away with her when Harry, in utter confusion, yelled out to him: “No you got the wrong one”, but only bubbles escaped his mouth, he didn’t care: “Malfoys over there”.
“Then you’re in great danger”, Draco hurried: “You’re the last master of the Elder wand, whoever fixes it needs to kill you before they can use it themselves”.
“Your family is in good health, I hope?”, Mr. Burgin asked as Harry was outside.
“So maybe I can help you”, Mr. Creston said: “What is it you needed?”.
“You want a taste?”, the man asked and stepped into the cell. Dracos heart was racing.
“Well”, Harry shrugged: “You know my experience with parents is very limited but from what I have experience through my friends it is uncommon to address them by mother and father”.
“Don’t worry about it”, Potter said and yawned: “Go use the bathroom, I have to do some paperwork before I go to sleep”.
“Alright then”, Molly cleared her throat: “Who wants cake?”.
“It’s great”, Teddy said: “We’re learning all this cool stuff”.
“I just wanted to give you this”, Draco said and gave her the bottle of Cognac: “Thanks for having me”.
“There you are”, she beamed and held out her arms to envelop them in a hug.
He signed at Cho, than back at his own chest. Harry frowned. Cedric signed again, took out his wand and sliced through Chos ropes with ease, Harry just stood there and watched he two of them vanish into the darkness.
Potter beamed at him: “I’m glad you asked, for I am in need of a new wand”.
“But only barely”, she whispered and crushed the paper between her fingers.
“Are you okay?”, Potter asked again and stared at him.
“You won’t even know he’s here”, Potter whispered back.
Malfoys lips parted slightly at the touch, but he did not flinch or shy away, his eyes fluttered shut for a second as Harrys fingers brushed over his lips.
“Why do you work this case?”, Draco asked: “I thought you were such a big shot you wouldn’t even move for anything below an outright murder, or maybe a kidnapping”
“Like a normal human being”, Harry sighed in exasperation: “Just be polite and charming and don’t make my colleagues hate you”.
And impressive he was unfortunately. Draco was relieved to see he still remained the taller of them both, he would not have survived the indignity of having to look up to Potters face as if seeing the messiah in the flesh. He was sure a lot of people did that on a daily basis anyhow, he needn’t be one of those.
“Mr. Burgin”, Harry said as he walked over to them: “May I introduce Miss Mary Mortimer to you, she will sketch the man you are describing”.
Draco nodded curtly and returned to his cell.
“Very good”, Draco smiled and walked after Harry into the living room, Mary hot on his heels.
Draco watched him, in his jeans and the blue socks on the wooden floor, so very domestic, so trusting, his wand lay in the hallway, far away out of reach.
It was cold, so cold that he couldn’t feel his fingers, or that might have been the lack of oxygen, who knew.
“I’m sure they’re lovely”, Draco insisted: “But they’re just so”, he paused: “Different from us”.
“Night Mary”, he whispered and she purred in response.
“We have to go with the times”, Draco said and handed him a small punching card: “Your tenth wand is free”, he explained.
“I did what everybody would do and got myself a job”, Draco said proudly: “I struggled for a few months, living in cheap muggle motel rooms until I had enough money to rent the flat I currently live in”.
“They’re not bad, you know”, Potter said: “Muggles”.
“Maybe tomorrow”, Harry said and put milk on the stove.
Before he could think about it he reached out and, with his right thumb, brushed away the crumbs in the corner of Malfoys mouth.
“Hello”, Draco and Harry said and walked over to her.
Draco smiled back, relieved to be forgiven so quickly.
Why hadn’t they done this years ago? This was so good, this was how it must feel to be completely safe and secure. Harry had never thought he would feel that way with Malfoy, never. But here he was and he only wanted more.
“Thank you”, Potter said and smirked: “That’s quite considerate.”
Lucious smiled: “Yes, alright”, he hugged his son again: “See you very soon then”.
“Nonsense”, Harry said and clapped in his hands, a smile on his face: “Let’s drink a glass of wine and forget about that”.
“What do you mean, work?”, he asked and played with the tag on his tea bag.
“Yes”, Ginny said and blushed a little: “I’m sorry you got attacked”.
Inside the house it was loud and vibrant, there were kids running around, no space to stand because every centimetre was already occupied, it smelled like sugar and heavy whipping cream.
“I’m just messing with you”, he said: “Sorry about that”.
“Anytime”, Mr. Burgin smiled.
Draco looked at him wide eyed. Somewhere deep inside his belly there was a heat that had not been there a minute prior but he ignored it best he could.
Draco just stared at him. Potter had lost his mind, there was no way around it, sometime between the great battle and now the Boy who lived had lost his marbles and Draco was the first to notice. How sad, he thought, just a couple of days ago Draco had been almost proud of Potters functionality in society, but he had been wrong.
“He should be in any minute now”, Harry answered: “He probably went for a coffee yesterday, he has a five month old at home and sleep is hard to come by”.
Harry sighed: “Yes”, he said: “But you had nothing to do with that”.
“Just go”, she said and rolled her eyes: “We all know you want to”.
So Draco prepared for a big day. He made tea in a hurry, simultaneously chewing down his rather spectacular tasting croissant and therefore not giving it nearly as much attention as it deserved, sorted through their new arrivals in record time and cleaned up the window to be ready for when this day decided to make a turn for the big.
The next two weeks went over without incident, his mother came to visit every day and Draco spent his days reading and playing cards with his father.
“Just open the damn present Potter”, Draco said, no harshness in his voice.
The woman looked at him: “It’s about Spiderman”, she said and Draco realized he should know what that means.
“I understand they took away his fortune once his illegal dealings became known?”, Harry half asked, half ascertained.
They stared at each other for a long time. Potter had gotten recognisably taller since (the trial) the last time he’d seen him and Draco didn’t know how that was possible, he had stopped growing when he was 16, 18 the least and here Potter was in his mid twenties and apparently still busy with becoming an even more impressive figure than he already was.
“But this much of a change of heart”, Draco shook his head: “My father has never hugged me before, never Harry, and now he’s hugged me two times in the span on half an hour. I am in serious worry over his mental state”.
That’s when he saw them, four dark figures in the middle of the water, floating breathlessly. Harry furrowed his brows and swam closer so he could see who it was.
They walked through the garden gate and a small, round woman with red flaming hair waited for them in front of the door.
He knew, Draco realised, he knew Draco had not lied.
“Harry dear”, Molly said: “Is everything alright?”
Teddy pretended to throw up.
“Be civil Ron”, Harry told him: “He’s not so bad now”.
I have found the pieces of the wand where you have described it. I will need further materials and will try to acquire them by tonight.
“Yes”, Draco said and stood up, following Harry into the store.
“I think I want to kiss you again”, Draco said, frowning: “I want to kiss you in front of everyone, the whole school, my father, my mother, everybody”.
“Muggle friends?”, Draco asked and raised an eyebrow: “What do you talk about?”.
But he wasn’t as lucky and on the fourth day he slowly came to terms with the fact that Potter wasn’t about to just appear on his doorstep and ask for more stuff just so Draco could apologise. Also the more days went by without Potter coming in the less convinced he became that Potter had sought out his company in the first place.
“He’s such a smartass, this one”, he said to Potter who had the audacity to laugh and nod.
“No worries”, the woman was still smiling: “I know which one he probably has, I’ve got a few good games for that”.
“I don’t know”, Harry said and gulped a bit of wine: “She must know we’ve been struggling, but I don’t think she knows that I’m done”.
“Morning”, he said shortly and hung his coat at the door.
Draco blushed so much Harry only looked at him, then back at the parcel: “Is this from you, Draco?”.
“What brings you to me?”, Lucious asked and turned around to sit on his bed again: “Please sit down”, he signed for two chairs opposite him.
Harry was running out of time. He had been swimming for a good while and still he was no closer to finding what he was looking for. He had evaded the cruel, evil things inside the lake with more or less ease but he had to hurry up if he wanted to win.
He sat down on the bed. He was wide awake, replaying this evening in his head, searching for a turn of events that wouldn’t land him here, but no matter what he did inside his mind he always woke up in this cell again.
“The weather”, Draco said immediately.
“Oh my word”, Mr. Burgin said: “Mr. Potter, what a surprise to see you. And Mr. Malfoy, how do you do?”.
your son Draco
“Yes?”, he asked silently, as not to wake Teddy.
Harry spun around: “Ginny”, he said: “Ginny come on”.
Krum must have talked to Malfoy more than Harry had realized or Malfoy wouldn’t be in the lake now. Harry rolled his eyes and realized the merepeople were still staring at him intently.
Harry laughed: “I think I could handle that, Malfoy”.
“Thank you”, Draco murmured to Harry.
Draco had a speech when he opened the shop the following day. Explaining his lack of manners sufficiently but without sounding too eager to go on said lunch meeting (date) after all. But Potter didn’t come in.
“Oh”, Draco said: “How does she look?”.
“Where were you yesterday?”, Harry asked.
I have therefore not visited your father as often as I ought to.
“So would you like it?”, she asked.
Draco got his toothbrush from his luggage, his cat was still sitting inside her cage, looking around warily, meowing confusedly at him as he walked by.
“Yes”, Potter smiled cheekily: “It’s a piece of wood with different supernatural cores to channel someone’s magical abilities”, he explained and it made Draco’s toes curl up. He knew that.
As if he had heard it Harry asked: “Would you mind taking Teddy for a minute? I really need to go to the loo”. He hadn’t really asked for an answer, he had stood up and lifted the boy from his lap and onto Dracos.
Harry laughed: “I didn’t know you could get alcohol from the kitchens”.
“We”, again he emphasised the word: “Aren’t doing anything, Malfoy”, he had stopped chuckling now: “I’m going to hunt down whoever it is and end this before it even starts”.
He looked at the girl again and wondered if he had ever met her before. He wrecked his brain searching for a memory, for something recognisable that would make this little girl the treasure they had stolen from him, but he came up empty.
“Thank you”, Draco said and turned around.
The library was stocked horribly, but Draco made do, selecting about half a dozen mediocre textbooks on wandlore to keep him occupied.
Malfoy looked absolutely shocked: “Just like that?”.
She stopped and instead started gnawing on his earlobe.
“You’re not so bad, you know”, Harry said suddenly and Draco looked at him. Harry wasn’t looking at him, he was watching the pot intently, stirring from time to time.
“I missed you too”, Harry said quietly, it made Darcos heart ache.
“I’m not going to”, Draco said slowly, “Since you are already here if you haven’t noticed”.
“I hope I won’t disappoint”, Draco said and swallowed.
Did that mean…was Potter lying to see him again? Dracos heart squeezed tight and made him a bit dizzy. No that couldn’t be it. Maybe Draco had forgotten to put it in? But he was sure he hadn’t, so maybe Potter did lose it already? He was known do be rather unorganised, bordering on negligence in some instances, so maybe he had lost his kit and was embarrassed to admit to it in front of Draco, someone who had his life together and was a functioning adult man.
Draco raised his eyebrows, now was not the time for Harry to talk about his genitals.
“I know”, Draco said and squeezed Harrys shoulder: “I know”.
“The pleasure was ours”, Martha said and gave Draco another three biscuits for the road.
“Oh”, he said, blushing vividly: “Very good, we’ll be right in”.
Draco frowned: “We always have, he was my favorite when he still worked for us”.
Harry took in a shuddering breath: “They did”, he said: “It’s in the evidence lockup”.
Draco went to brush his teeth and take a quick shower. Then he went over to his luggage and put on a pair of black dress pants and his grey cashmere sweater.
Backup arrived fifteen minutes later, ten stern looking aurors apparated into the shop all at once with one single deafening bang.
“I’m sorry to hear that”, Draco said and layed a hand on Harrys thigh: “I’m sure you will be successful sooner than later”.
Draco smiled. This wasn’t too bad actually. But why? Why was Potter being so nice to him? Not only that but he seemed honestly concerned about his wellbeing, that was a premier. Potter must take his responsibilities very seriously, so seriously he managed to forget their long lasting fiend and treat Draco like an actual human being. But then again hadn’t Potter always been nicer to him than Draco had been to him? Draco swallowed. That was an unpleasant thought.
Draco hadn’t even thanked Potter for testifying on his behalf. He hated owing people something, hated it with a passion, and now Potter had saved his life (presumably). Great. He had to think about something to repay his debt, something to make them even, it couldn’t go on like this.
“No they would never”, Harry said: “And they don’t know where I am anyway, so no use waiting for a letter”, he took his glass again.
“Oh that’s great”, Draco laughed and clapped Harry on the shoulder.
“Hello yourself”, George said and shook his head.
“Very well”, Harry ripped out the page and pocketed it: “Thank you very much for your cooperation”.
Harry chuckled: “You’re funny and kind and brave, what is there not to like?”.
“Alright”, Harry nodded, feeling a little pang in his chest: “Stop bullying me then”, he said deliberately.
He turned around abruptly and stalked down one of the many narrow corridors in search of that wand.
But he did keep the notes in the darkest corner of his trunk.
Draco looked at Teddy, he was maybe six years old, he wondered what school he was going to.
“Get yourself a coffee or something from the fridge if you’d like, I don’t mind”, Potter said and waved towards the fridge.
Draco huffed: “There are no more Dementors in Azkaban”, he said confidently but internally he was shivering. He had never managed to produce a corporeal patronus, ever, not even in the safety of his own home or the darkness of Garricks workshop where he had spent more than one evening trying desperately to make something come from the thin silver fog that sprayed out of his wand. It didn’t work. Draco was either too stupid or not talented enough for a patronus and Harry was never to find out and if it was the death of him.
They were silent then, Harry looking between them with unveiled curiosity and Draco kneeding his palms nervously.
“Come with you where?”, Draco asked confusedly.
“I hope your wand’s good”, it erupted out of him before he could stop it.
“I see”, Draco closed the lid of the box again. “On further consideration, give me a moment to get the one with the Troll whiskers, it might be suited better for you”.
Draco followed him, sniffing the flowers now and again, they smelled beautifully.
“Well then I shall”, Draco said eagerly: “What is there to know?”.
“How was it where you grew up”, he asked Harry then: “I’ve heard so many different tales, all I know is that you grew up with muggles”.
Draco liked the workshop, it had taken over two years before he had been allowed inside without supervision and some months more until the old master had deemed him worthy to try his expertise on creating his own wand.
“I suspected as much”, Narcissa said then: “But I never thought you’d fall for Harry Potter”.
“That’s fascinating”, Draco said and he meant it.
“But you didn’t”, Potter replied and watched the Mediwizard as he tried removing the fabric from Dracos skin: “Which is almost a shame because then you wouldn’t have been my case and I could have played Legend of Zelda in peace”.
M. G.
Draco nodded and followed him.
“Deatheater”
Teddy looked over towards Draco and smiled: “Hi”, he said and held out his hand.
Draco had to surpress a grin and just nodded.
“Hey George”, Harry said and hugged the man back: “How’s the kids?”.
Harrys partner didn’t say anything the whole way to Azkaban, he was visibly annoyed by his task.
“Harry”, he started, sighing but Harry interrupted him.
“We caught him”, Harry said passionately: “His name is Martin Gordoff, he’s a low level criminal, he’s a fan of Ginnys that’s how they met”.
“Who is the other kid?”, Draco asked, still looking at the children.
“My shoulder is broken”, Draco said and winced as he tried to move his arm.
A hopeful, small smile spread over Harrys lips.
“So when are you and Ginny going to ty the knot?”, Draco asked and grinned: “Or did you already?”.
Harry blushed: “So Dobby and you get along now?”.
“I don’t want her in prison”, Draco said immediately: “She didn’t want anything bad to happen”.
Someone was looking for something.
“Sorry”, Draco said a bit sulkily: “Why don’t you have one? A baby I mean”, he asked.
Your son, Draco.
“Well yes”, Harry said: “Haven’t you read the Daily Prophet?”.
“That is serious matter indeed”, Potter murmured and looked worriedly at Draco: “Are you alright?”, he asked then.
“He will be happy to have a visitor”, the woman said and opened a heavy steel door. They walked inside, it was barely any warmer, but it was dry and the loud patter of the rain was muted by the thick walls.
Malfoy turned around with wide eyes and searched the platform for the source of the voice.
Harry didn’t look at him, he didn’t say anything.
“Thank you for your service”, Harry said and she disapparated.
So Potter (Harry) was still with the Weasley girl, how romantic. He huffed and spit out toothpaste. Maybe they were engaged already, it had been long enough, but Draco had not seen an engagement ring on her finger. Maybe she only wore it outside? He made a mental note to investigate in the morning, maybe sneak around the house a little, look at the pictures, rifle though their mail, all the things a good guest should not do.
“This one”, he said and signed towards Draco.
He sat down next to Draco and stared at his hands.
“And you train up into the night sometimes?”, Draco asked: “Since you weren’t here yesterday when we came back”.
Thick teardrops plopped on the letter when Draco was done reading it. He had seldom felt this alone.
“Probably not, the older ones seldom are, but it’s worth a shot”, Harry answered.
“Fuck”, said Draco for the third time this night, he wasn’t a big curser usually but under these circumstances he couldn’t help himself.
“Yes very nice”, Draco said absentmindedly checking the expiration date on each bottle he chucked into the trunk, most of them had expired a good 35 years ago and he wondered if they would still be good. “A bit too hot for my liking, so I’ll hide myself inside the store”.
“Hello”, Draco said and held out his hand.
Harry felt the heat of anger rise in his stomach as he looked at Malfoy. But the longer he looked the calmer Harry felt, Malfoy looked weirdly innocent, with his closed eyes, no trace of the usual sneer on his relaxed face, he looked vulnerable.
“Thank you”, Draco said and sat down in front of Mr. Crestons table, Harry doing the same.
Draco taped down the edges of his wrapping paper and put back the tape.
They realized it the exact same moment, their heads shot up and their gaze met each others: “Olivander”, they shouted at the same time and ran towards the door.
They looked warily at them but stayed silent, until a small man in his fifties turned towards Harry and said: “Great to see you, Mr. Potter”, he held out his hand.
“I’m gay”, he said then and only once he said it he knew it was true.
“Of course he wasn’t”, Draco said and shook his head.
Draco deflated: “Harry, if you would just listen to me”.
“Thank you for coming”, Draco said thickly: “So quickly”.
“Mr. Burgin”, Draco said and bowed slightly, then they left the door with a high ring of a bell.
“Well it isn’t quite morning anymore, you two”, Harry said: “We have to hurry, your parents expect us in an hour”.
“How did you know?”, Draco asked the man in front of him.
Draco had also gotten used to that (looking at it like that he thought him rather tolerant now, he had gotten used to an almost ungodly array of things) and only rolled his eyes half way.
“Didn’t the Weasleys lose a son in the battle of Hogwarts? Fred, wasn’t it?”, Draco asked tentatively.
He leapt to his feet and grabbed his coat, his body doing things before his head could think about them. He put on a scarf and gloves before realising it was the mid of June and the night had come with a gentle, warm breeze. He was out of the door in a matter of seconds and on his way down to the front door he tripped on the stairs and almost ripped his knees into two pieces. He got himself up and only barely realised his bleeding and throbbing knee as he sprinted down towards the the alley.
“I told him about you though”, Draco said and Harry could see the blush spread over his cheeks.
Draco wondered why his father was not invited, sure it would be his mother who was waiting at the round table. But when he rounded the corner there was Harry Potter sitting there, chewing on his fingernails.
“Sweety, we’re home”, Harry yelled out as he closed the door behind him.
His father was sitting in a chair reading a book when Draco came through the door.
“Maybe he wants to kill the Minister, I don’t see him sleeping on your couch”, he whined and trotted up the stairs alongside Potter.
“Wait, wait”, Potter said and held up a hand: “You’re not going anywhere right now”, he shook his head: “You’ve just been attacked again, who knows what he’ll try next”.
Draco was taken aback a little, though he didn’t know why exactly until he realised that no one had ever asked him that question before.
“Mother”, he said and came to a stop before her: “It’s so good to see you”.
On the third day Draco thoroughly regretted the amount of products he gave Potter and silently hoped one of the expired potions would blow up and send him in for a complaint.
“What kind of school does he go to?”, Draco asked.
“There is so much I don’t know about you”, Lucious said: “So much we have to catch up on”.
And at the beginning or end of those classes Harry would find a note on his table or a note would collide with the back of his head and it would read: Have a nice day.
“Yes I know”, Draco said silently: “You said so during her trial”.
He went over to the kitchen and saw the Daily Prophet from the day before and since he had no better option he ripped a page away from the paper and began to clumsily wrap the game with it. Now all he needed was cellar tape or duct tape or any sort of tape, but where to look.
Draco looked at his fathers frail hand and had to surpass a shudder: “Why?”, he asked.
“You forget that the Dark Lord personally taught me”, Draco said silently: “I know my way around some nasty curses”.
“Very interesting”, Mr. Creston said and walked towards a door on their left: “Please come in”, he said and held the door open.
“The Weasley, I mean, Ginny, doesn’t really rejoice about me being here”, Draco said: “I’m sorry if I caused you any trouble”.
In the reflection of the glass door he could still see Potter standing there (looking at him) as he opened the door and vanished inside. His heart was pounding even before he started up the three flights of stairs and he felt slightly dizzy. This had been a very eventful night after all, with him being attacked, it was normal to feel a little out of sorts under these circumstances.
“Look, honey”, Potter pleaded: “I didn’t have a choice, I’m sorry but we’ll just have to make it work”.
“How about I show you some of the lesser known ones?”, she asked: “That way the likelihood that he has it is smaller”.
Draco swallowed and watched the kid run towards them.
“What are you planning to do with the sketch?”, Draco asked.
“Unfortunate circumstances force us to work together”, Harry explained: “We have to make do”.
Draco nodded and turned around. What could be a good fit for the chosen one? He ran through his mental catalogue of wands and was tempted to just start with the ugliest one, a stubby little thing with a greenish shade of wood and a little loop at the end but he was too much of a perfectionist for that. Damn him.
“Let me show you everything”, Potter said and walked towards the door.
The door opened and a tall and skinny man in his early thirties rushed in.
“Right”, Draco said and nodded: “Thank you very much”.
Malfoy had gotten a hold of himself again and looked at Harry through long lashes.
“I knew one day you would find your way to my cell”, Lucious said still completely ignoring the other man inside his living quarters: “Every day I’ve waited, four years now, I have waited and I knew one day you would come”, he smiled: “Thank you for coming”.
And then they were gone and it was quiet, the judges were deliberating their scores and Harry was miserable.
“Oh you two boys live together?”, Mr. Creston asked with a grin: “I’m sure that isn’t always smooth sailing”.
“So amazing”, Teddy breathed.
Harry came back into the living room with two full glasses of red liquid and put them down on the coffee table before them.
“Oh”, she said, trying hard to sound disinterested: “What kind of lead?”, she asked.
“That’s great”, Harry said and let go of his shoulder: “Then go on and play some more”.
Lucious nodded: “I know everything about Toasters and Washing machines now”, he said proudly: “They are quite clever, muggles, I’d never known”.
“I see”, she said and nodded: “I am happy to see it”.
“I’m fine”, Harry shivered.
“I need to be relieved from protection duty”, Harry said curtly: “Take him or put him into protective custody, I don’t care”.
“I thought illegal would be exactly up your alley”, Harry said and felt his lips twitching. Stupid lips.
“Apparate?”, Draco asked and took the cage and a bag with some of his belongings.
“Alright I’m going”, Harry said sternly: “But I’m taking the invisibility coat”.
“You hungry?”, Malfoy asked into the silence. “Sure”, Harry shrugged.
“We should do that again”, Malfoy said, shaking his head: “Like all the time”.
Harry grinned a little: “Sometimes I don’t mind it, when I’m stressed and need to get rid of the tension, but mostly it’s a chore that has to be done”.
What you heard is true, I should inform you of the following events as I am currently in protective custody in Azkaban and long for a friendly word.
“What does it say?”, Draco asked coldly.
Malfoy smiled at him: “I guess it’s about time you call me Draco”.
“Malfoy”, a pretty woman to his right announced immediately: “How curious to see you”.
“Typical”
“My name is Draco Malfoy and I need to report a crime”, he said and stood on his heels. This was all taking very long.
“Harry”, Hermione yelled, apparently for the second time.
Draco blinked.
“Don’t you have informants or something like that?”, Draco asked as they stepped further towards the desk.
“What should I care about your colleagues?”, Draco asked.
“I had no choice”, Potter replied in a hiss: “He needs protection”.
“Did you check the drawer?”, Draco asked: “Or how did you find out?”.
He waded through the rubble towards the workshop. It was a small room with a wooden workbench the size of a queen sized bed in the middle, there was a carving station with chisels and gouges and knifes and something that looked like a weaving loom for the preparation and processing of different wand cores.
“Maybe we should sit down”, Draco suggested.
“I haven’t seen him yet”, Teddy said sadly: “He didn’t say hi yet”.
Potter cleared his throat and breathed in deeply: “Hello”, he said then, with a somewhat wonky smile.
He was just telling Potter about the limp the assailant had been walking with when two bored looking Mediwizards came into the office without knocking.
They sat down opposite her.
They walked out of the alley onto a quaintly lit street with orange streetlights illuminating the night.
The door opened again and the Weasley and Potter came back into the hall, she looked angry, red blotches on her pale face, Potter looked tired.
“Pleasure”, the man said.
He found the old man sleeping in his bunk just like he had hoped and went about to wake him. That was no easy feat since Garrick Olivander was a quite heavy sleeper and a quite grumpy waker which didn’t make it a very pleasant experience for whomever did the waking up.<
“Wand?”, Potter coughed out the question so suddenly it startled Draco into a little unfashionable jerk. His eyes darted back to Potters face (they might have wandered a bit – Potter was definitely going to the gym) and to his horror he felt heat spread over his chest and up his throat.
“I am”, Draco said: “It was delicious”.
“It was fifteen years ago”, Draco said: “They will hardly remember him, I think”.
Potter gave him a questioning look so he nodded lightly and waited.
“Very well, Sir”, Mr. Burgin said and sighed, relieved.
“Well, we better take our leave”, Draco said and stood up.
“I don’t know about good”, Draco admitted: “But better at least”.
“That is an excellent idea”, Harry agreed: “We ought to go to Burgin and Burkes, there we might inquire after it some more, are you almost done with your food?”.
Draco stared at the parchment as the realization dawned on him. Ginny was behind this. She was the one who had sent out the man to repair the Elder Wand. He got slightly dizzy. How could that be? Surely she didn’t want the wand for herself, surely she wanted to give it to Harry some way or another, maybe she was scared for him being out there as an Auror and she wanted the best wand possible for him. But the man had attacked Draco, had kidnapped Ollivander, surely she hadn’t approved of it, maybe the man had just made a spur of the moment decision and now she had to deal with it.
“How could you bring him here?”, the girl whispered furiously.
“Garrick”, Draco shouted now after feeble attempts of lot more gentle methods: “The store was broken into”, he screamed into the old mans ears.
“I know what’s missing”, Draco yelled into the darkness behind him half an hour later.
“How did you track him down?”, Draco asked.
Draco nodded, the Zabinis had played only a small part in the Dark Lords rising but the wizarding world had been fierce and harsh with their judgement.
“You certainly do”, Harry said.
Draco stammered: “I don’t know”, he began to sweat.
“Sure”, he said: “Harry then”. It sounded very wrong and it felt wrong on his lips, like kissing his grandma with tongue. Draco shuddered.
“We’re not that perfect”, Harry sighed and rubbed his eyes with his hands: “We fight a lot”, he shook his head: “I shouldn’t even be telling you this, only Hermione knows, and if she knows so does Ron probably, but we’ve been having troubles for the last couple of months, almost since we moved in here together”.
Harry grinned, "'Course, sir!" As he sped off into the shop, Severus dawdling behind. He got a few odd looks, but otherwise no one really cared. Harry asked his opinions on things, but he didn't have much input.
"You know, Tom, my Tom, I mean, still won't talk to me about you. How do I get rid of you?"
Harry was almost giddy, "Lord Voldemort."
Have purebloods never heard of nappies?
The small boy looked up with watery eyes, "B-but you were angy- I dun w-wan you be angy at Sev'rus."
"You know, you're a lot smarter than anyone gives you credit for. Your name is Zachariah LeStrange, and you are the lovechild of Rabastan and a witch who is not mentioned. It is believed she passed away."
Snape looked slightly taken aback, and cautiously replied, "First off, you are most welcome, second, I do not think there is. And thirdly, how could you tell that so simply? None of the others were aware, I wasn't even aware there was three muggleborns." He asked, "I am a great observer professor. You have to be when you live with my family. Always think ten steps ahead, just to make sure you aren't hit over the head with a frying pan or something." He shrugged, "I suppose figuring people out came along with that, to see if I should avoid them or not. I have figured nearly everyone out standing in this very room." He said, almost as if it was nothing, and people were gaping.
Potter, Harry
The boy was still not happy with the answer, "Wasn't the troll enough?"
Tom sighed, "It is difficult, but if I let the anger get the best of me, I would of died out as a dark lord in the fifties."
T: Alright enough with your shenanigans. Just sneak your way up to Quirrels office. You are a Slytherin after all.
H: I was joking!
"And why, I beg, would you need to go to mother care?"
"Hang on just a moment, a second ago you asked if I got him pregnant!"
T: I am fully aware you cried, you are currently crying. Now stop being so self degrading, wipe your face.
H: Wait, which potion am I making?
He picked out some outfits, mostly pattered trousers with a matching waist coat. Severus nearly laughed, as they were huge. They didn't seem to make them in children's sizes. Harry bought them, and they trotted off to another clothes shop.
People were looking bewildered, and dumbly nodding.
"Well, minister, growing up in an abusive household it's quite easy to spot the signs. I did some digging, and found out that Koden and Ginny's birthdays were too close together- I heard Draco mention in passing about his cousin who had been stolen from his crib. The birthdays matched up, so I took a long shot. And I was correct."
"Now," All the attention was back on the minister, "Mrs Molly Weasley is going to say her piece. After that, the children will be moved to a back safe room and every one who is not a voter or myself will leave for the viewing of memories."
Do you know where this is?
Ron's face lit up, "Course! I'm just gonna finish my breakfast." Harry nodded, waiting for his newfound friend to finish eating. He could feel Dumbledores pleasure at the head table, and he couldn't help but sneer to himself.
H: Bye Tom!
He knew he sounded needy, but he wanted to learn.
Zabini, Blaise
T: Why of course dearest Harry, What do you wish to learn?
Harry was too close to tears, his eyes 'leaked' as he was jolted forward, his uncle obviously had enough, "Now you, boy, will stay in here until I unlock the door. You wont be leaving. No meals tomorrow, and extra chores on Monday." The whale of a man grumbled, practically throwing Harrys small frame into the confides of his cupboard.
Entwhistle, Kevin
Harry made his way back to Snape's office and knocked before walking in an seeing the feared look on Draco's face, he smiled politely and sat down in his previously occupied seat. "That didn't take long." Draco mused before turning to his smirking friend, "Why are you smirking? What did you do?" Draco said, suddenly concerned. Harry chuckles, "That's for me to know and your parents and Professor Snape to find out. In a few months." And he stared at his left forearm, as if checking an invisible watch.
Harry nodded his thanks without really asking how the snakes knew he changed his plan.
T: Valid excuse. Now, which subject today?
"I really am her son." He whispered, and Harry could feel the pride.
"Miss Weasley, what was your relationship with your mother like?"
Severus, now sitting at the front of the class, snapped out instructions and the class got to work.
"Rude." He mumbled, before wandering. He was going to purposefully disobey.
Harry huffed under his breath, "Shut up Tom."
H: I want to know how to do wandless magic, I'm itching to try.
H: What?
"She does?" Percy asked, one eyebrow raised. "That sounds quite lovely. Get the childhood she never had,"
"I'm not sure how to explain it, really." He started, "When I was younger, something awful happened. And since then, as I've grown, I found myself slipping to a younger age, in my mind, only sometimes. From before it happened. I originally went to father about it, and he thought it was adorable. He encouraged it."
"No. But may I ask you to terrify them a small bit?"
"I'm not sure, my lord, why don't you pick for us?"
"I'll still kill her, you know." Harry murmured, and Kode smiled, "I know."
"M drawin' fam'ly!" He replied happily, and Harry could make out a few of the figures. Lucius, Narcissa, Severus, Draco himself (who was drawn a lot smaller that every one else, at toddler size, which Harry found unmistakably adorable). There was quite a few more people, though, and he wasn't quite sure who they were.
He was abruptly thrown from the car, dragging his trunk behind him, and somehow, in a blur, made his way onto platform 9 3/4. He boarded the train, and claimed an empty compartment as his own. He leaned against the wall, a little behind the window, when he saw the initials T.M.R carved into the wooden window pane. Harry never thought Tom (his father?) to be one for graffiti, if that's what you could call it.
Weasley, Ronald
Harry re-entered with the snake, and eye brows were raised. "This is Belladonna, she slithers off most of the time. She says hello."
Ron nodded strongly, wiped his face, and stood up. "Do you think they'll let me visit her?"
"Forty feet I think. Goodnight."
Harry's plan was officially in action, "Wh-who's there?" He was pleased with how his voice sounded; small, pleading and scared.
Harry, Snape and the Malfoys had a tea brought to them by a house elf and Draco sat on his fathers lap the entire time- if this is what Draco was like from being from his father from not even a full twenty four hours, how was he going to last from being from him for a year? This would definitely make Harry's work ten fold difficult.
People stared, mainly mudbloods, Harry noticed. Harry sensed Draco's insecurity and hexed a few of them. That made him giggle, and before they knew it they were seated at the table. Harry hadn't gotten away without a few glances, of course, one from Quirrel/Tom and another from Snape.
T: I'll get back to you on it, child. Now run along, I can sense you're anxious.
"Blowing up part of the castle could become a hazard. We'd still be going to lessons, there would just be more watchful professors because they would know it was a student. It would just cause more hassle. Plus, I'd never want to destroy this beautiful place."
H: No Tom, I do listen to you, you know.
It was a mistake though as his Uncle came thumping down the stairs, and Harry barely managed to throw the various food items to the depth of his cupboard, on his pile on oversized clothes, before the whale of a man found him, he took it as him only just getting out and dragged him from the kitchen, throwing him into the small confines of his cupboard, which he was thanking everyone he could think of for.
But right now he was quite lonely. Severus spent most of his time with Quirrel, and Dumbledore was happy that Severus had finally stopped being so hostile.
S: You don't have to be sorry.
"No thats okay, thank you minister. The way our mother treated us got a lot worse after Bill and Charlie left for Hogwarts, and worse after they'd left home. I was under the impression I was taking all the physical abuse and protecting my younger siblings, but I now realise that was not the case. She would berate us for random things, and had a habit of throwing things at my head. She- she'd, uh, whip me with tea towels and wooden spoons. I have memories, but.. they aren't very nice." His voice was shaking, and the minister called a break, and thanked Percy for his time. He rushed back towards his new found family.
Draco chuckles, nodding. “At the time, I thought I wouldn’t get another chance with you. That was it. I had my shot, and had lost it.”
"No need. I understand," Draco said. Draco offered a handshake, and Harry took it even though it felt like a weirdly formal gesture. Draco’s hand was warmer than he expected.
Harry didn’t think he had a lot of fashion sense, but even he doubted black Nike tech fleece was going to cut it wherever they were going.
When Draco mentions again that Harry studied at a Muggle art college, Harry’s eyes gleam, and they agree to visit the school on Draco’s next day off.
Draco just wishes things could go back to the way they were. He knows they won’t. Nothing will ever be like it had been. And that’s… That’s something he has to accept.
We hugged when we parted, and I felt so dirty after that I spent the next day in bed.
Coach yelled himself hoarse at halftime, but nothing helped. Milo took a nasty spill by the Wanderers’ Keeper and just narrowly missed a hoop. He was out the rest of the match. They took a beating with a final score of 70 - 300. It was not fun being on the other end of a score like that, and it was by far the worst game of the season.
"Do you want me to leave you my keys again?" Harry asked, unsure of what was going on.
“What...” he starts, trying to disentangle himself from her and to contain the tears suddenly welling in his eyes. Mrs Weasley’s arms tighten around him for a second before releasing. “I’m... what are you doing here, Mrs Weasley? What is all this?”
He allows himself some degree of relief and pride for a second and adds, “Nice to meet you all, Harry’s talked so much about—”
"What the fuck is this?" Harry said, once he had dragged Draco into the kitchen.
Harry had been so alone, so hopeless, that the possibility of having their cat for a little while seemed better than anything else. Draco can’t help the pain that spreads through his body at the thought of Harry here, trapped, lonely forever. He frowns, his breathing becomes shallow. Then he chides himself.
It’s not like he has to repeat the night, or drink and smoke whenever he wants to feel good. He’s feeling good
This is
his mind, the bond, something inside him repeats. Isn’t that the point, though?
Draco looks up, poking Harry in the ribs. “I can’t believe you, Potter! Your place is double the size of mine. We could be hanging here this whole time.” Draco rolls his eyes with a snort, rummaging through the box and pulling out a pair of maroon sandals with at least fifty straps attached to it. “Where did you get these things?”
"I'll have to do some research to find out what happened to this." Draco brandished the vault contents parchment before slipping it into an inside pocket. "I won't be back until Monday. Keep up the magic transfers, please. Farewell."
Draco repeats, “I bonded our souls. Mine is acting as a—a beacon, a lifesaver. It keeps yours grounded here. Harry, I still feel you slipping away. I know you’re feeling it too.”
the magic alive through him somehow. He wonders what it would be like to have the support of his family’s magic with him, but shakes that thought away. It's impossible. Draco sighs, waving his wand to cast a series of diagnostic spells on Elle.
When he was little, he would rise before the sun, tip-toe quietly through the halls of the Manor, and slither through a crack in the kitchen’s back door into the cool, misty morning.
"Can you die playing Quidditch?" A shy boy had spoken up without putting up his hand. If Harry hadn't gone through this with Teddy, he might have got himself in trouble. It turned out, children did not react well to a rather flippant attitude about death. Instead, he took a deep breath and made his voice slow and even.
“Go on,” he coaxes coolly, though he doesn’t want to hear another word about it.
He finishes his soup and pushes the bowl away, before the words escape through gritted teeth. “To summarise, he wanted to be free to bang people, especially since it would surely end up in the papers.”
One day, Draco comes back from work to find Harry sitting in their bed. Harry's wearing the same shirt he had when he went to sleep the previous night, the orange glow of the twilight enveloping him in warmth. This is the day Draco’s hopes are shattered.
And he’d give
He hasn’t left his home in days, and he can’t recall the last time he took a bath. His hair is sticking up everywhere, and he knows for a fact that the bags under his eyes have grown to a worrying level. He feels he’s lost some weight, although the idea of looking at his paler-than-normal figure in the mirror is nauseating. If he does this, he knows all he’ll see reflected in him is the man Harry hates.
"Team strategy," Harry said. Curiosity must have won out, because Draco bent over the playbook.
The next day, Draco asks Harry if he can take Draco through the path to Hogwarts' Tree of Life. Harry seems reluctant about it, but doesn’t resist much after Draco explains Hermione’s theory about the trees and Voldemort.
"She draws tits," Astoria said dismissively.
Except he is.
"Stop trying to make it sound sordid for Potter. We were children," Blaise said. "I wanted their undying devotion." And for all his bluster, Harry knew that Blaise could be sweet underneath it all. He was stuck up, mean, and unfairly hot, but he was also more than that.
He doesn’t, and thankfully they don’t stay long after their thirty-minute gathering in Harry’s room.
Luna turned around and said, "Miles, leave him alone."
“If you must.”
"Is it—"
When it was all over, Draco was done. He had refused to visit his father in prison and refused to visit his family home. What reason would there be to go to a place tainted by so much evil? Malfoy Manor died before the war had even ended. Draco didn’t want any part in it.
"You’re being told off for your disloyalty," Ginny corrected. Even Hermione had been photographed wearing a tiny Falcons or Harpies pin on her barrister’s robes on match days.
, why Harry accepted to spend the rest of his life with someone as unworthy as Draco. Harry shouldn’t be the one begging. This shouldn’t be happening at all. This is all wrong.
"Yes, I do," Draco said. He said it as if he was braced for an argument, but Harry didn’t give him one.
, Harry had said, but he didn’t sound too vexed by it.
They both watched as the piano wheeled around and then disappeared with a loud pop. "Thank you." Harry said quietly to the house. Then it occurred to him.
“It’s impossible to know,” Draco says, and shudders as the words hang in the air, heavy and loaded. She should know—she’s married to Harry’s Healer. She should know, but she still hopes anyway. Draco can’t hold onto that kind of hope when he’s already lost
Draco averts his eyes from the glossy green, staring at the shells on the top of the closest pillar again. They are beautiful things, and he wonders who went to the trouble of positioning them just so.
“I can move,” she says, and it’s barely a whisper, followed by a soundless chuckle. Then, she repeats with more force, and turns to him. “I can move, Healer D.”
Blaise glared.
Second, and most shocking, he learned that most people can’t see thestrals. It had never occurred to him to think otherwise, since every stable hand, every breeder and potential buyer, every jockey and trainer, even his mother and father, could all see them.
Only, Harry shakes his head and rolls his eyes. “You Healers are all the same. I drink a normal amount of coffee.”
Draco nods.
"What if they were journalists?" Harry asked. Draco scoffed and tapped his keycard on the door.
The hope that he might, one day, get his husband back dissipated during those groveling weeks. But he can, at least, ease their path, and answer whatever questions Harry might have. If Draco can convince the wizard that he’s a better man now then maybe… maybe Harry’s magic won’t flare again when he sees Draco. Perhaps Harry won’t hate him so much.
No, he can’t make it in two seconds, and she’s already rushing towards him,   as if she knows exactly what he’s thinking. She probably does, given that she's known Draco for at least ten years and is very familiar with his quirks.
, Draco tells himself. Harry is… Harry is gone.
"No, I think I’ve seen enough," Draco said. "Are you free tomorrow?"
as the claws of panic grip his chest.
"Not to me, to the house," Draco snapped.
Harry slowly sat up, confident that Draco wouldn’t make a move now, he turned around and faced him, looking him solidly in the eyes.
He stretches a hand towards the tree, fingers fumbling on the cold and rough wood. “Please,” Draco’s voice is low, his throat hurts as the cold breaches his body. Still, he goes on, because that’s the only thing he can do now.
As much as Draco wants to know all the ways this new Harry sees the world, Harry also seems curious about him. He’s always asking questions that leave Draco’s cheeks burning and the bond pulsing happily in his chest.
When Pansy and Hermione finally adopt the sweetest twin girls, Ava and Emma, Harry and Draco fall in love with them immediately, and the single bed in Teddy's room becomes triple beds. They come over often, and love Uncle Draco and Uncle Harry.
Harry’s face falls. All the emotions he’s been hiding—consciously or not—drag the corner of his lips down. “I’m… I’m sorry too” he says, voice heavy, eyes pinning Draco to the spot. “Were you alone all this time?”
It occurred to Harry while flying at training the next day that it might not have been the house he wanted to say he loved.
is a big deal," Barbara said. Harry was inclined to agree, and then remembered what the Body Issue entailed.
"Is this a bad time? I’m just off for the week with the shoulder, so I thought…sorry, I should have sent a message or asked. You’ve got a guest?"
"Give me a tour," Draco said.
"Good," Draco said to the bannister. It shone a smidge more brightly.
They cracked open the second bottle. Draco's mouth stained even deeper red, and Draco was flushed a bit more. Somehow like this, in his study, Harry found Draco even more lovely than he ever had before.
more, the bond does too. And his magic, that missed Harry’s so much it seems like only now it’s become alive again. He kisses Harry as if it’s their last day. And as far as Draco knows, this might be.
Too much mess, light. And noise.
Harry grins softly, kissing Draco’s hand before taking it in his own. “I will always forgive you, Draco. And love you. You know that.”
Harry wasn’t all that good at Galleons to pounds conversion but he nearly had a stroke. He didn’t spend that much on anything that wasn’t practical, and this was an eye-watering expense. These sheets must have been woven and enchanted by Merlin himself.
"What does that have to do with the house?" Harry asked in a flat, annoyed tone.
Elle snaps her head to the side, apparently only now noticing a third person there. And then, back to Draco, eyes wide and mouth agape, when the realisation that there’s no pain seems to dawn on her.
“Brave,” Harry supplies.
Taking his hand back, Draco worries his lower lip, surveying Harry’s face, but he can’t find any of the answers he wants there. He asks, “Is this the end?”
