Harry was highly sceptical about this not because he didn’t want to wear the Red Riding Hood costume but because he didn’t know if he would look good in it.
Draco really hoped he couldn’t hear how he let out his breath, being relieved about that but in the next moment his mind went on a rollercoaster again. Piercings… where? How much? So many questions but he didn’t want to ask because in the end he would reveal himself with his thoughts.
His hands caressed his girls’ inner thighs and pulled him more towards him before he lined up his erection on his hole and bottomed out in one single thrust. A little scream escaped from Harrys lips and he shivered in the ropes. “N-No… No, D-Draco, c-cumming! Cumming!”
“I should go. Granger should look more after you in that outfit. I don’t like it when someone else touches you.” He said and looked at him once more to savour this moment before he turned and walked away.
“Their” café was a small café in front of the British Museum with handmade scones and a delicious tea. They found it some years ago when they were roaming around the area to look at the stores and since then they always found their way back to it. The owner always greeted them and also gave them some discount on the food for being regular clients.
Of course his parents were head over heels for that especially because their son refused to go out for some weeks and after his fathers stare he wasn’t able to say “No” if he wanted to avoid an argument. But even with this special night he didn’t dress up, he just… wasn’t in the mood for it. He wasn’t in the mood for anything honestly since a while and he was sure it wouldn’t change on Halloween.
It was still a little bit awkward to stroll around after everything but at the same time it felt like nothing changed at all and Harry wanted to cherish this feeling as long as it was possible. After some time they entered a shopping mall and Draco went straight to the underwear section in a clothing store.
He snapped out of his thoughts and turned around just to see Harry standing in front of him, wearing a plain shirt and jeans. His hair got slightly longer now and he started to put it into a very small ponytail but damn it was cute.
“When I’m back from Feo I want you to be up in our room, naked on the bed on all fours, your ass facing the door, pussy on display. Understood?”
Hermione turned him back so he could look into the mirror and for a moment he stopped breathing. He wasn’t sure if that person in front of him was him or him with a different sex.
“Yeah I want that baby girl. Isn’t that what you already wished for since I put a spell on your tit clits? I bet it will feel amazing not only for you but for me too. Of course it will only happen when it’s fine for you and you know that.”
“Yeah… It’s okay. It’s just… please talk with me? I think we could solve a lot with just talking about things, it’s- I really like you. You’re an important friend to me and it’s… it wasn’t the first time.”
She winked at him and waved a little so he would follow her. Yeah, his girlfriend… he had to suppress a laugh and just ruffled his hair a little while walking with her. They went in one corner of the section and the woman pointed at some shelves and a rack.
“Didn’t you listen to her? She said she was not interested. Now how about you would bloody fuck off and stop harassing her?”
“Oh… oh no! My underwear is in my bag already. I… this is for you.” Draco said and really blushed a little.
Harry looked at her and saw how worried she was about him and he just couldn’t say “No”. He rolled his eyes and threw the book away he was reading till Hermione came into his room.
Draco took a deep breath and closed his eyes for a moment before he turned to the girl and smiled at her.
“Yes… yes it’s okay for me.” Harry whispered and bit his lips a bit and Draco had to hold himself back at this look. God damn it.
When the boy started to let his hair grow out his mind went blank and there was nothing more beautiful than playing with it. He was even more disappointed when summer holidays started and Harry showed up at their secret place with short hair again. And when he realized this was not normal he decided to stay away from him.
“Well alright. Tongue piercing and nipple piercings. The tongue one will take longer to heal and don’t eat milk products for the next few days.”
And now Draco decided it was time to go one last step forward. He knew his Alice would be ready for it, even eager for it because she knew her Daddy would like it and that’s why she also would like it even though it meant to train again to push her needs back to please him.
“Well…. It’s not something I could ever forget you know. I still can’t stand Granger but she has a hand for making you look absolutely gorgeous and beautiful.” He said honestly. “I liked you in that costume.”
Harrys reactions when he complimented him on his costume led him to the thought of gifting him female clothes and today was the day where he wanted to do it. He chose exactly this clothing store because they had clothes for girls and young women that were not
Hermione smiled and looked at him while she changed into a furry black white overall and a black white hoodie with fur on its ends before she patted on the small chair in front of heir make-up table, looking at him.
Draco laughed for a moment and felt instantly bad about this situation. He manipulated him into doing this, all while Harry basically had
Draco was sitting in his room in the evening when his phone vibrated. Everything was uninteresting all of a sudden because he knew Harry would send him another little shooting. He opened the message and downloaded everything before he opened it.
“Wow… Hermione… That’s… awesome.” He murmured and carefully caressed his face. He looked so… delicate. Soft. So… female.
But it was too late to do anything against it because after some minutes a new message popped up and a picture was attached.
While he was looking around he recognized a girl with very bushy hair and immediately his mood was a mix out of anger and a little bit of hope. Though he couldn’t stand Hermione Granger at all (mostly because she was the best friend of Harry) he knew Harry couldn’t be far when she was also here.
“Harry you know I always said that he isn’t good for you. How many times did he quit this friendship? Four times for now? This… I mean… When do you realize he’s a bad influence?”
It was wrong to feel like that towards a boy and especially because Harry was two years younger than him. In puberty two years could already change a lot in relation to how people see the world or feel emotions. Harry was still too much of a “child” for Draco and he could see it in some of his reactions.
Now it was on Hermione to roll her eyes and with a move she got up, took Harrys Hand and pulled him into her room. She opened her wardrobe and dug a little bit before she pulled out two costumes.
feminine on one side and cute on the other side. Perfect for Harry. He really wanted to see him in a fluffy oversized sweater, cute socks and fluffy pumpkin pants… for the start.
“Well… I don’t care. You’re still Harry to me. My little red riding hood.” He answered and couldn’t hold back with that comment. His friend looked at him and blushed, grumbling something between his teeth while he went back to the front store to pay for his new jewelry while Draco stayed back and bit down a laugh. He didn’t forget, huh?
He looked at himself in the mirror afterwards, very satisfied with the outcome of this appointment and turned to Draco, grinning a little.
“You can wear my Mary Jane shoes, we have the same shoe size anyway. What do you think? I can also give you a wig and apply some make-up.”
The hold up their hands in a defensive meaning and grinned once more at the girl before they went away to go after other people.
Dracos finger digged deep into Harrys hips to get some self-control back and with a gasp he concentrated some more. He even forgave him for not calling him properly in this state but everything was new and he had to get adjusted to it.
“PrimeInk Tattoo and Piercings” was written in graffiti like letters above the door and Harry grinned at him. It took him some time to finally realize what the boy wanted to do with the money.
But he didn’t have much time left and he had no choice but to pray that Cassiopeia just wanted to go to bed and so Harry got rid of his skirt, his blouse and frilly panties. He placed them on the chair next to their bed und crawled on it before getting into the demanded position. His hands went to his ass cheeks and spread his ass cheeks so his hole was on display just like Draco wanted it.
“You look so adorable with long hair, Harry. I already told you that, remember?” he murmured and looked at his green eyes.
“You have to get used to that feeling… it will always be there from now on and you can’t forget that your pleasure isn’t as important as mine. What are you? Tell me.”
His heart thumped in a rapid speed and his hormones danced through his whole body. All the way back to the bench were he first sat to wait for Crabbe and Goyle he couldn’t stop looking at the pictures he took of him.
Draco had noticed that the last times Harry sent him pictures he somehow tried to be more… feminine. It was strange to think about it but it was exactly like that. His hair got longer over the time and all he did was putting it in little pony tails when he was taking the pictures. It made him think of a little girl and his kink just got stronger with each one he received.
In the end nothing of those piercings really hurt in his opinion, maybe the tongue one a little bit more but the man knew what he did and everything was perfect.
It was 5pm and Hermione was looking at him with pleading eyes while standing in his bedroom. To be fair Harry never skipped Halloween and always loved this particular holiday. He loved to search for costumes with Hermione and have kind of matching costumes and to collect candies but right now was not a good time.
Harrys heartbeat went faster when Draco said these words and he nodded while stroking his hair that got longer after that Halloween night.
He always found Draco very attractive with his blonde hair and his what looked like a cold look but that look was only for people who didn’t have any contact to him. For Harry his look was warm and caring since the beginning of their friendship.
His heart stuttered for one second and he bit his lip. Fuck. Harry was sitting in front of his mirror again, his knees, covered in socks were pulled up against his body while he leant on it. He had a small ponytail and through his fringe you could actually see that he put on make-up.
With a beaming look she showed him a red cape with a hood, together with a cute dress in black with a white blouse under it and white thigh-high socks.
All Harry did was giving small sounds with each touch and he felt how eager his body was to all of this. Every time Draco touched him just the slightest his body reacted to it… and he really wanted to know what he wanted to do with him. Even though both of them liked to try out new things and play with different toys Draco was the one who had the biggest changes in mind every time he said he wanted to try something new.
But he always looked so good in black jeans and a white button-down shirt, covered by a simple black jacket.
He couldn’t describe that feeling that just went through his body right now but it didn’t stop there. Every time Draco circled around his hole he got even more aroused and pushed his hips up a little, closed his eyes.
Satisfied with the decision Draco took his wand and stroked over that hole before he quietly said the spell he looked up (because believe it or not even wizards have their kinky books) and watched as there was a little glow coming from his wand before it disappeared again.
He broke up his contact with Harry… again and he shouldn’t be even hoping to see him but yet he did. He knew it was not a good idea but the feelings he had for this boy were just too strong.
It felt like hours till he heard footsteps in the hallway and for a moment his heart stopped beating because he thought Cassiopeia showed up but when the steps got nearer to their bedroom he recognized them as Dracos and a sigh left his lips. Everything was fine. He closed his eyes and pushed his face into the pillow underneath him while his body relaxed.
“Yes… yes… everything okay…” Harry whispered and leaned into his touch, closed his eyes for a moment while he could still feel Dracos cock deep in him but he loved this feeling. He felt loved and owned and that was everything for him. His body started to come down after his husband pulled out his cock he put his arms around him, pressing him to his chest.
“And I decided it was time to move forward. Your pussy is tight and wet just how I love it but I think something is missing to make you the most perfect little girl. So why just having tit clits when I can make your hole finally feel like it’s the cunt of a real girl?”
It took her around 30 minutes to apply make-up on him with eye shadow, rouge, a little bit of lip gloss and mascara before she sat back and nodded to herself satisfied with the result.
It began with Harry letting his hair grow out and starting to dress feminine and taking a female name. Under his clothes he wore a cock cage just like any good girl. He learned that Dracos pleasure was more important then his own to the point where he never came without permission. His cock got smaller (maybe with a little help through magic, but who knows, ha) and after a good yearly long training with the cage he didn’t get an erection anymore. So all that was left was a useless little clit squirting when he had a sissy orgasm but it was just they way Draco wanted it because he taught Harry that good little girls don’t need that thing between their legs anyway. Real girls also didn’t have it and girls themselves were only there for taking, never for giving except when it’s with their head.
To be honest he didn’t even know why he was so mysterious like this. It was just clothes to try on. But something about this felt pretty private and somehow he didn’t want to share it.
It wasn’t really Dracos intention to be out tonight. In fact he would have rather enjoyed it if he could just stay at home, reading books or practicing spells but it was Halloween and Crabbe and Goyle were standing in front of the door to dumbly ask his parents if he wouldn’t have time to go out with them.
The blonde boy threw his cell phone on his pillow and lied down to look at the ceiling of his room. He liked it… He really liked to wear it and he thought it’s cute. That meant Draco had more freedom to chose clothes he wanted to see him in and maybe… just
idea what Draco wanted to accomplish with it. Also he was still so young he probably didn’t even know what kind of kink he fed with wearing something like this.
Over the time he learned it was perfectly fine to have a kink like this but he couldn’t help but to feel ashamed from time to time when he looked at the pictures Harry sent to him without knowing what Draco did with it.
“You mean the dress? I mean I already told you I like you in dresses. And I like to repeat myself in order to compliment Granger on her make-up skills.”
Draco couldn’t wait anymore. He thought he could have had more self-control but the look of Harry beneath him, how he jerked in his bindings every time he played with his rim or thrusted his fingers into his body and how quickly he opened up to him. Not that it was explicitly necessary nowadays but he still liked to feel it.
“Eager little slut. You can’t wait till you get some cock in that greedy cunt huh? You’re already wet just from one finger…” Draco laughed and took his finger back, gave him a smack again and looked at him.
At Dracos words Harry looked up from the dishes he was just washing and blinked a bit before he nodded. “Yes Daddy” he answered and hurried with cleaning up before he went up to their bedroom. A look from out of their window told him that Draco was indeed on his way to the dragon stables to take care of Feo, his dragon and Harry knew it won’t take long for him to get back to the house, not after the order he just made.
“Okay baby girl. I’m sure you’ll love it. Especially your hole. We both know what a slut you are for it.”
Draco waved and grinned at him before giving him the bag. It was glued with some tape he asked for so Harry couldn’t see what was inside of it.
“You didn’t forget. Very good. Now don’t ignore that again otherwise I probably have to slap your clit as a punishment and we don’t want that do we?”
“No, you silly! I’m still too young and that’s nothing the Grangers would allow in my age so they allowed something else. Piercings are fine for now.”
They started to know each other when Harry was 10 and Draco was 12. And when Draco got older he realized he had feelings for that raven haired boy with his beautiful green eyes. He started holding his hands, telling him it was okay between friends, he started hugging him because Harry was okay with it but Draco thought it was wrong. It shouldn’t be like this.
The boy looked at her and smiled before turning to go upstairs, the paper bag still in his hand. He was so tempted to just look inside but he promised Draco to not do it till he was home and for himself.
Harry took out a paper from his bag and handed it to the man who looked at it before he put it by his side.
Harry was waiting in front of the fountain of Picadilly Circus, constantly checking his phone for a message from Draco. He was nervous. It was the first time after their friendship “break-up” and their meeting at Halloween that they decided to see each other again and he didn’t know if he should have given in.
And Harry was even more perfect when Draco turned his nipples into sensitive tit clits able to feel the same arousal like when a girl gets played with her clit between her legs and lube wasn’t a thing anymore after his hole started to get wet just like a girl. This change was a little bit too much for Harry in the beginning and he needed some time to get adjusted to it as well as to train his body yet again to control his pleasure and selfish greed but he managed it perfectly just like the rest of all the modifications he got. He was happy with it, he was pleased with it and over all he was pleased that Draco was pleased.
She walked up to the door, Ron and Ginny behind her, and muttered every unlock spell she knew- none of which worked. She huffed in annoyance, and remembered all it took to open the door was a flush of magic.
Draco looked him up and down with an expression which only meant one thing, ‘Who are you to talk?’ Harry narrowed his eyes before looking down at his shirt, in which his whole meal rested. Harry scoffed, and looked back to Draco with a ‘So what?’ expression before rolling his eyes.
Blaise fell back down in his chair, his mind doing somersaults over the fact that Harry had called Draco ‘
“My cock! Suck my cock, please Draco!” Draco smiled, pleased with the answer, before gripping Harry’s right thigh harder, and placing his face in front of Harry’s hardened penis. He breathed on the tip, and Harry moaned at the stimulation. Harry’s hands in Draco’s hair tightened when he leaned forward even farther, and licked the tip; dipping in the slit and collecting pre-cum before suddenly taking the whole of Harry’s cock in his mouth.
! Draco thought as he removed the small glass jar from the bedside table and broke the kiss with his beloved.
Severus tentatively approached the boys, and kneeled beside his godson. His hands shook as he placed them on the blonde's chest. He began to panic as he felt
He took a strip of his steak, and drug it through the potatoes, before licking the tip. He then drug his tongue down the underside of the medium-well piece of steak, before putting the whole piece in his mouth and hollowing his cheeks as he sucked; like Harry he dramatically moaned as he pulled the piece of steak out of his mouth. He mentally thanked the gods that the first years had already left- or at least that's what it looked like.
direction Draco pointed just as Hermione, Ginny, and Ron shouted the last of the chant over the wind.
and Draco hadn’t denied it. Also why were they making such a ruckus at 1- he paused lifting his wrist to look at his watch- 1.37 am for a book? And what had Harry meant when he said that he had ‘forgot how bad his anger issues
Harry screamed, and his back arched off the bed, face contorted in ecstasy as Draco began bobbing up and down while sucking and licking. Draco’s teeth barely scraped along the flesh, and Harry was coming down Draco’s throat, his hand shoved in Draco’s hair forcing him to swallow it all. Harry’s breathing was heavy and face flushed when he pulled Draco up by his hair and dragged the angel into a kiss.
“You know what?” Blaise said as he ran his finger tips over the spines of multiple books before finding one he liked and pulling it from the shelf. He turned towards Draco, “I don’t think I will,” he grinned at the blonde as he walked to a plush armchair just right of the bookcase on the other side of the window and curled up in it, intending to stay there and read the whole night (if only to annoy Draco). Draco scowled, but didn’t bother to argue, knowing from
). Harry’s head jerked up so fast, he headbutted a healer, causing a sickening crush to fill the room. He turned around to said healer, whose nose was clearly broken, “I’m so sorry!” he said bringing his hands up in an ‘im innocent pose’ and flicked his wrist casting a wandless
Harry moaned as Draco kissed, licked, and nibbled his way down his chest. Draco kissed Harry’s inner thigh, teasing with bites here and there, leaving hickeys.
“There’s nothing going on between me and Potter!” Draco said in a panic, and he knew he should’ve valued those occlumency lessons his father had given him when Pansy giggled.
Now that Draco had thought about it, it didn’t make sense why that was in Hogwarts’ library to begin with. He gathered the books back into a neat stack and placed them on his desk before turning back around to face Harry who was gathering the ten books he looked through back up as well, “Any luck?” he asked. Harry turned around to face him, his expression grim, and he shook his head.
in the great hall. He quickly turned from the rest of the hall, which was silent for some reason, to search for Draco. His eyes scanned the slytherin table for a couple minutes before landing on his favorite beach blonde.
The others nodded in agreement, and Snape immediately moved to find parchment, Blaise went back to the room to gather the books, and pansy began to… nap. It was deserved, Harry thought. She’d been through so much in the past couple hours, learning that your best friend might die isn't easy.
“I’m still sorry,” he said, “and i’ll try my best to find it,” Harry nodded his thanks and just as he was about to go back to the bed a voice from behind them spoke.
He held eye contact with Draco and brought the fingers to his mouth, and slowly, he seductivly licked the potatoes from the surface of his pointer and middle finger. The whole hall, including Draco (especially Draco), gasped as Harry shoved both fingers in his mouth. He dramatically moaned at the taste of the potatoes, before bringing them out slowly and lowering his pointer finger so he was successfully flipping draco off.
She tip-toed towards the door that was open a crack and pushed it open further. She gagged at the sight that greeted her, the two of them in a loving embrace; she hated it. Not the sex, or the sweat covered bodies, but the smiles on their faces, the love in their eyes- even while asleep they radiated it. Ginny behind her held in a squeal, and looking at their cum-covered bodies, Hermione was struck with an idea.
Draco sighed and squeezed Harry’s hand, “I-,” He paused not wanting to make Harry angry once again. He rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly, “I don’t remember bringing it in,” he said a blush on his cheeks.
He couldn't handle it, not after lily. Losing a best friend was enough, losing his godson, it was something he wouldn’t be able to handle. He set the blonde down gently, wiping his tears away as he crawled to Harry. He placed his hand on the boy's chest, nothing. He searched for a pulse on his neck, his wrists, and screamed in agony as he realized he’d not only lost his godson, but he’d lost Harry as well. Harry who was too kind, too selfless for his own good. He couldn’t breathe, his chest was burning and his lungs, they wouldn’t inflate. He continued to sob as he used his shaking hands to pull both bodies close; and he held them. Held them as though they were still alive. “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry,” he said repeatedly, as if they would hear him. “It’s all my fault,” he whispered, voice full of grief and finality.
“A luna, non potentiam trahunt; misit hostis ad alias alibi!” They only had time to take into account the runes on their chests, the full moon, and the end of the chant before their bodies involuntarily arched, and started floating in the air. The naked men registered the pain, searing and hot, felt in their veins before they blacked out completely. And this time it wasn’t from tiredness.
We're getting close to the end- I can't believe it! I'm gonna cry. The fact that this is my second story and its going to be finished first- you can really tell which story I had the motivation to write. These last chapters have been short though, I apologize. Normally my chapters are over 2,000 words :(
Harry looked up at him and placed his hand on Draco’s chest, which was clothed with a gray long-sleeved t-shirt, his face was suddenly serious, and he sat up. Draco got a bit worried. “I was reading for a while, and I was almost asleep. I was so tired, but just as I was about to fall asleep, I spotted the word ‘mors’,” he said and Draco nodded, “It referenced that potions book you were reading the other day. Do you remember?” Draco’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion as he tried to remember.
years of friendship with the italian that once he decided something he stuck to it. He leaned back against his beds backboard and continued to read, he faintly heard the sound of Pansy leaving.
“What do you want Harry?” He asked, shoving Harry’s left leg over his shoulder, and griping the others thigh.
Draco looked at Harry who had just gotten the weasel to stuff his face with pie, and nodded his head towards the door once he was sure he had the ravens attention. Harry nodded to show he got the sign, and draco grabbed his jacket before saying goodnight to his friends and leaving the hall.
It was two months before Snape made any usable potion to counter the Tempus Mors, they still didn’t know if it would work, but it was worth a try. Harry had been making calculations and in order to go back, the ritual would need to take place on a new moon. In order for the ritual to work, everything had to be opposite- the brightest moon, to the darkest moon, words wishing death, to words wishing life. They just hoped it would work.
“More like walked in,” Harry said, interrupting Draco, “because we were dumb enough not to change the wards,” Draco scowled at him for interrupting, but continued on as if he hadn’t said anything.
She waved her hand towards Ron and Gin who were just down the hall, signaling the all clear. They both came running, Ginny rather quietly, but Ron was making a bit too much noise- and eating Bertie Botts every flavor beans?
made you,” Draco said and ruffled Harry’s raven hair before leaving the smaller man standing there with a goofy smile on his face. Harry quickly followed, and took his seat in front of Draco who, at the time, was cutting Harry’s chicken into tiny cubes.
married the boy-who-lived. So now, 10 years after the war, it became clear that Draco was absolutley stupid to think something
Harry was surrounded by voices overlapping and he was getting the biggest headache, he’d honestly had enough. “Hey!” he shouted, loud enough to be heard over all of the other voices, “We should find a way to get home,” he began, picking draco's hand from his side and holding it in his own. “I don’t know about you but I’d really like to get back to our pansy and blaise and possibly kill a weasel?” he said, and grabbed pansy’s cat cup, sipping at the tea and hoping it would curb the tickle in his throat.
Hermione opened the jar, and dipped the brush inside, before drawing the runes prescribed on the jar, onto the boys chests. She stood back to admire her work, and then painted a stripe of the black sludge on both the boys left forearms. She scoffed when she caught sight of draco’s dark mark-
The menu tonight was, of course; chicken. Harry was a very picky eater, but that was just one of the things Draco loved about him. Another… was the way he made a mess of absolutely
Harry stepped outside, fully clothed, and holding his love’s hand; he turned to the blonde, “I love you,” he said, “I just- I want you to know, if this doesn’t work or if something bad happens- because it can you know, that I love you. I love you and-” he was promptly shut up with a pair of lips not his own. The kiss was gentle, sweet.
“Thanks,” Draco said, and re-adjusted to lean against the headboard placing his book in his lap, “what’s the reason for your visit?” he said in a fake posh voice, and Harry smiled before taking the place beside him and laying his head on Draco’s chest, listening to his heart.
“Who am I to deny, your demand?” Draco bit Harry’s ear lobe as he lined up to Harry’s entrance and shoved all the way in with one thrust.
But after his son's rather blatant defiance of him, Draco had almost made his choice for him. Unless the Dark Lord was much more forgiving than he remembered, his son was not long for this world.
The only issue was that he was currently locked up in Azkaban for murdering twelve muggles and Peter Pettigrew. Both men pulled some strings where they could and arranged for a meeting with the man.
Either way, Lucius Malfoy planned to ensure that he'd always have a large supply of Ogden's finest. Merlin knew it was the only way Lucius could get through his son's incessant whinging without doing something he'd regret.
The boy hadn't even gotten off the train, yet he deemed it necessary to burden him with his pathetic, childish problems. Who actually cared that much about a silly skirmish on the train? He would reassure his son about the mudbloods and blood traitors would get their comeuppance soon, but there was not much he needed to write about. Maybe he could attach some of Draco's favourite chocolate to shut him up for a little bit, or at least delay his next letter by a few hours.
Lucius Malfoy sighed, picking up a quill. It seemed that he was not writing one letter, but two today. He wasn't looking forward to Severus' imminent protests, but it could be done. While Draco was going about it for the completely wrong reasons, Lucius Malfoy agreed that the boy would make a powerful ally in the future. With the political power of being the saviour of the wizarding world, they could push through legislation that he had only dreamed of presenting to the Wizengamot.
Attempting to compose himself. Lucius Malfoy snatched the letter from the owl and strode out of the Wizengamot session, with many of its members showing their amusement to various degrees.
Actually, that was a rather good idea. Maybe a howler would finally get the point across that Lucius Malfoy didn't care about his son's crush on the Boy who Lived. Then again, it would be a public scolding and would do significant damage to the Malfoy name among the younger generation. As much as he longed for some peace and quiet, Lucius Malfoy still enjoyed his financial and political positions and would not put them in jeopardy. Yet.
Harry had been chewing on a piece of steak for the past five minutes now and observed the busy chatter in the Great Hall. The atmosphere was light, the excitement over lunch was big, Harry looked down the Gryffindor table where Hermione was massaging her temples and Ron talking insistently to her. Harry looked away again and searched for Draco on the Slytherin table.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake, maybe I shouldn’t have said anything.” Harry managed to say and leaned back in his armchair looking out of it.
No sooner had the door fallen closed, Draco let his quill fall propping his head up, hands under his chin. Harry eyed him surprised.
Thank you so much for reading! And thank you to everyone who leaves encouraging comments down below, it means the world to me and motivates me like nothing else :)
As Harry stepped into the Gryffindor common room he instantly forgot his contentment. Ron was sitting on the red armchair, Hermione was nowhere to be seen but Seamus and Dean were sitting across from Ron talking with him. Neville who had been mindlessly looking through a book was the first to notice Harry.
The updates might be a bit more sporadic from now on due to uni, thanks for understanding! And thank you to everyone for the support. It's much appreciated <3
“Come on, it’s Seamus. He’s cool,” Ron defended himself. Harry sighed. Seamus just looked confused at them.
Already after dinner, Harry watched his two best friends being all lovey-dovey with each other again. Harry was happy that it had worked out and that they both were on good terms again. No matter how angry he was with Ron, he knew very well how good Hermione and Ron were for each other. Draco didn’t show up for dinner but a friendly nod from Theo let Harry draw the conclusion that Draco was probably actually getting some sleep.
Harry still tried to struggle out of the hold. “Don’t make me laugh. For the best?! You have no fucking idea!” Harry heard himself yell after him.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Malfoy!” said suddenly another voice. Draco looked over to the table next to them. Instantly, his eyes narrowed.
“Nothing,” Harry said. “I felt nothing. Can’t even remember if I dreamt something.” Ron finally put the piece of bacon in his mouth and chewed thoughtfully. Harry couldn’t hold back and gave his friends a quick run-down of his conversation with Draco and his dream afterwards as soon as they sat down for breakfast.
“Go on.” Ron’s voice sounded strangely empty but neither accusing nor judging why Harry felt brave enough.
“I have to point out that we cannot exclude the possibility of the brew having dangerous side effects. After you said to me that you hadn’t taken in any of the potion on Tuesday, I had it thrown away. But it shouldn’t be impossible to recreate it. Only then I can tell you for sure what effects and side effects the potion has and of course, if a cure will be necessary,” Slughorn explained calmly and decidedly.
Harry waited in front of the classroom fidgeting while his other classmates went in one after the other. He didn’t even mind Ron and Hermione and pretended to tie his shoes. Shortly before class was about to begin, Harry finally saw a dark-clothed figure with blonde hair walking towards Potions class. Draco slowed down for a moment as he noticed Harry but then fastened his pace even more. Harry had to cut him off unless he wanted him to walk by him.
Harry paid no mind to them as he noticed the arrival of a certain Slytherin followed by his friends. Draco was speaking with Blaise Zabini. He seemed a bit out of it. Blaise kept shaking his head talking seriously.
Ginny seemed to think for a bit. “Maybe you could try to explain it. And then I’ll tell you if it’s understandable or not.”
“Look, Draco,” Harry began patiently. “I understand that it won’t be easy to explain. I don’t even want to guarantee that this will work and that we become best mates forever but I feel like I’m starting to like you and to not try it at least would be cowardly.”
“No time to explain, I dreamed of him again. We have to wake up Hermione!” Ron looked confusedly up at Harry until it clicked and gave him a shocked stare.
Harry was glad that the atmosphere had loosened up a little and smiled crookedly. “Had to think,” he admitted.
For half an hour Ron argued with Harry on Saturday morning about how Harry should get out of bed and take a much-needed shower. Harry finally did give in but only under great protest. So, he ended up sitting in the Great Hall for breakfast freshly showered and changed meanwhile looking depressed as hell. Ron joked a little to brighten his mood but Harry didn’t really feel like laughing.
The rest of the day went on forever, Hermione spent most of it scolding them for their messed-up Potions tests. Malfoy didn’t show up at lunch but it gave Harry a chance to do some small talk with Ginny which was nice. Seamus asked Harry later on that day if he was still “dreaming about Draco” which Harry answered with a small stinging hex Seamus’ way. Ron offered bringing him some food for dinner because apparently, he was not eating enough. Harry declined thankfully and got the sandwiches from the elves again instead. The elves insisted he take two muffins with him as well. After a bit of arguing Harry gave in and headed to the potion’s classroom with the food in his bag. Draco was even already there this time so Harry sat down next to him at his table without asking. Slughorn gave them the assignment and went about his evening after a few minutes as usual.
Draco quickly muttered five whole silencing spells and just about warned his friends before the Howler exploded with the loudest noise possible from a small envelope like that. Draco had noticed while experimenting that Howlers don’t react well to silencing charms and just explode even louder.
Keeping the Map on his person, Harry quickly pulled on a sweater, a pair of shoes and hurried also to the seventh floor where the flight of winding stairs leads up to the viewing deck of the tower. He didn’t know why but he was somewhat worried. And that was definitely a new kind of emotion in relation to Draco. The dreams made Draco’s feelings seem so real and with that he felt and understood Draco’s feelings of powerlessness and despair. He still felt the Slytherin’s bitter wish for death in his veins. It was only logical that his empathy would spike
Ron sighed. “Trust me, I’m anything but excited. Anyone else would’ve been better but I understand how it is to be in love with someone. That is nothing that you choose and sometimes I guess it hits a complete idiot. In the end, it is your business, Harry. Of course, it’s something I will need to get used to but if it’s friendship or more, it doesn’t really matter now anyway.”
Harry raised his eyebrows, surprised. “That’s not it, Professor. I think, just… well you see- what do you think would be the consequences if one had happened to ingest some of that brew?”
“If you had even a speck of humanity left in you, you would’ve known that Harry deserves a better friend than you, so, piss off and don’t come back.” Ron thought he saw all colour leave Malfoy’s face and any life disappearing out of his eyes. But before Ron could regret his decision he turned away and hurried to his Charms class.
Hermione sighed. “Maybe we should let the topic be. You will survive detention just fine and, in the future, you just won’t work with Malfoy again.”
“Then study with me.” Harry observed how Draco’s expression went from surprised to confused to sceptical.
“I don’t care, okay? It doesn’t bother me. For all that I care we could pretend as if nothing had happened,” Harry interrupted him probably sounding not all that convincing. Draco furrowed his brows but his stature relaxed.
Harry found it curious how Draco treated his friends. He seemed to have the perfect poker face which his friends just accepted and ignored. So, when Draco rolled his eyes in annoyance Blaise would just add even more excruciatingly boring details to the story rather than finish it. Maybe that was their way to tease Draco a little.
Draco smiled amused. “It only gets fun when the date was good. And unfortunately, it wasn’t regarding to your highly valued opinion, Potty,” Draco teased.
He actually did spot him but Draco didn’t look very happy. He had his head in his hand and was nervously tapping with the other on the table in front of him and looked just... Tired. His friends seemed to be trying to involve him in conversation but Draco was more focused on his lunch. He didn’t look back at Harry.
Ron crossed his arms in front of his chest, which Hermione observed concerned. “But do you have to talk to him between classes too? Or greet him in the mornings when you see each other even if it’s just a stupid grin? Or do you really have to call him by his first name? Is that all part of this ‘detention’ as well?”
Draco met Harry’s look challengingly, grabbed his own handful of grass and threw it towards Harry. Before Harry had time to get worked up about it, a passionate war of grass-throwing erupted between the two wizards. Harry could sense his victory coming when Draco grabbed his wand for help and Harry nearly fell backwards at the force of green stuff landing on him. Before Draco could claim victory, Harry threw himself onto the Slytherin with a war cry.
Harry shook his head. “I don’t believe him. Something must’ve happened. Maybe his parents threatened to disinherit him or something. I can’t imagine why he would do this to himself out of his own free will.”
Harry grimaced at Dean but then got up from the picnic blanket. The others had now noticed him as well.
Pansy Parkinson, Theodore Nott and Blaise fucking Zabini were walking towards them. Harry turned quickly to Draco to say goodbye but his friends had already noticed him.
“Do you want to head back?” Harry heard himself say suddenly. His voice sounded raw as if he had cried for hours on end. Draco glanced at Harry, then nodded slowly. The two wizards got up and brushed carelessly the snow off their cloaks. The wet cold had completely soaked through. To Harry’s disappointment, Draco let go of his hand but he accepted it. He accepted the quiet that fell over them as well. He knew that Draco was waiting for him to talk about it. But Harry rather not think about anything so he embraced the silence.
A few seconds later the burning pain on his face subsided. Draco thought he tasted something salty. Draco looked around not able to process what had happened. The cauldron which he had thrown over was lying somewhere between all the staring students, Harry just got up and cleaned his glasses of a purple-coloured liquid and Slughorn waved his wand over another cauldron. The liquid, which turned out to be the potion Draco and Harry had just brewed, flew over and landed blubbering into the cauldron.
Harry expectantly observed Draco’s reaction which changed from confused to satisfied. Almost a little condescendingly a smirk made its way to his lips. “I forgive you, Weasel.”
Before everyone could turn towards Draco, he already made his way to the front. “It’s alright, I’ll follow later.” Harry felt relief wash over him and his heart began to beat a little faster.
“I see,” Harry murmured and he didn’t even hesitate to put his hand now over Draco’s. The moment he felt the ice-cold skin beneath his own, Draco had already turned to him.
Harry shut his eyes and leaned his head back against the wall behind him. He tried to rationalize things and calm down. This wasn’t the end of the world. Ron said some things, he said some others. Now they knew and could maybe talk about it all later in a proper way. Harry wished he knew why he even let himself get pulled into that fight. The right to a friendship with just someone couldn’t be it. Was it Draco? Maybe. He really did like him, even if it was difficult to admit to his friends.
Draco’s fingertips started tingling and heat rushed to his face. He turned to Harry dangerously slow.
“Your call,” Blaise said and the Slytherins turned away to keep walking. Harry didn’t even wait for them to be out of sight before grabbing Draco’s wrist and dragging him into the nearest empty classroom that he could find.
Draco was still looking ahead but his posture tensed a bit. “Yes. But my Mother did not just vanish back then.”
Harry wasn’t even half bad as Draco’s partner. He was smart enough to not get in Draco’s way and got all the necessary ingredients ready. The water was already boiling in the cauldron when they were done with the preparations.
Harry smiled stupidly. He was glad that Draco had liked that. Then they sat down on their robes in place of a blanket and Draco got a huge pile of books.
“I’m afraid that this is the worst idea you’ve ever had,” Ron said decidedly while he looked over the index in a Transfiguration book. Harry had just told his best friends about the planned meeting with Draco this evening.
He startled a bit as his pillow moved and then... it groaned? What? Did he fall asleep on some weird hexed pillow? Before he could finish his thoughts though, his pillow squeaked like a teenage girl and fell out of bed.
Draco couldn’t help the smile. “Alright, fine. Just don’t run around and yell about us being friends to everyone or something. And if I know anything about you, that would definitely be something you’d do.”
Ron leaned a bit in and put his hands together, fingertips touching. “And why are you telling me about this then?”
“Not funny. I thought today morning I was going to die, again.” Harry replied quietly. He noticed out of his periphery how Ron’s attention turned to them as well.
Ron’s eyes were still on Harry, unrelenting. “Are you actually studying with him?” It suddenly came from him a little to calmly.
“I have to study.” Harry nearly laughed. If one of them didn’t need to study, that would be Draco. “I heard that you’re going to Hogsmeade.” Harry looked at Draco surprised, who answered with a shrug. “I think you Gryffindors aren’t quite aware of your volume when speaking.” Harry laughed. His friends didn’t in fact argue quietly.
Draco’s look got a bit softer. “Fine but you will do exactly as I say. If you start complaining, you can do it alone.”
“Up until now I’ve dreamed a mix of memories and a bunch of dragon shit. I doubt that it makes sense to anyone,” Harry thought out loud.
Ok, so, what is my excuse this time for leaving everyone - especially Sam - hanging? Well, I got covid ^^" It was bad lol. But I got better! Which meant lots of uni stuff to catch up on and exams to write. I still got 2 papers left but I'm slowly getting everything in order. I am incredibly sorry for making you all wait and I hope to upload the next few chapters soon. Thank you so much for you guys' understanding and support <3 Enjoy!
“Well, you don’t have to decide now. You can go to the medical wing if you decide to take the draught,” McGonagall assured relaxing the tense atmosphere.
“How do you know for certain that those are memories and not just dreams that happen to be out of Mr. Malfoy’s perspective?” Slughorn insisted.
Fifteen minutes later Slughorn decided to leave them to probably go have dinner himself and warned them to keep on working diligently or else.
“I didn’t think that it would be so hard on you. I thought that would pass as soon as we were on good terms again.”
Slughorn eyed Harry first, then Draco. “Did you ingest any of that potion?” he asked sternly. Draco looked at Harry who looked back angrily.
Eventually, they changed the topic to their plans for the upcoming weekend to visit Hogsmeade. Hermione hoped for snow but Harry doubted that would happen. November had just begun and was rather showing its autumnal side this year. Harry really wanted to go on a little trip with his friends but the debate on whether to go to Three Broomsticks Inn or Hog’s Head didn’t interest him much. After a bit, Ginny, Seamus and Dean got involved as well and Harry realized this was quickly becoming a full-on discussion, so he decided to stay out of it.
He sighed out in relief. The Room of Requirement. As he opened the door and got in, the first thing he noticed, was the large king-sized bed in the middle of the room. He sighed again and stripped down to his pants before he climbed in under the black satin-cover.
“How likely is it that he’ll kill you?” Ron asked glancing at the Slytherin-table where Draco was spending his time glaring at Harry.
“Tell him!” Hermione almost ordered. “Tell him what you told Malfoy then he can decide on his own who the reason is for his misery!”
Draco sighed again and rubbed his forehead. “I know it is a bit complicated but you know as well as me that-,”
"Oh yeah? You walk around like you've got a stick up your arse anyway. I bet a cock up there wouldn't be something new to you."
Ron stared at Harry for a while in concentration but then just shook his head and mumbled a “’s is too much, mate”.
Hermione shook her head. “Harry you are not just dreaming from his perspective. You are dreaming Malfoy’s dreams! You are in his head.”
Draco shot Harry a heated look while leering at him. “I will leave that to your imagination but it isn’t as demure as Madam Puddifoot’s Café.”
The studying was quite productive. Harry held back on complaining and Draco tried to see the positive in Harry’s work. They moved along quickly but after three hours, Harry’s concentration started fading.
“So, you’re dreaming about Mr. Malfoy and deduce from that that you’ve ingested a failed potion?” Slughorn asked slowly.
“Holy shit!” Harry shot up in his bed and looked around confusedly. It was the middle of the night. Draco must have woken up and therefore kicked Harry out of his dream. Harry rubbed his eyes still out of it. What did he just witness? Blaise and Draco? Draco and another bloke? He wasn’t sure which surprised him more. And the worst part was he could feel his own erection demanding his attention.
He was failing this test miserably. He definitely put studying on the backburner because of detention which he was regretting now. One after another they were handing in their tests, Hermione obviously as well, and the classroom started getting emptier. Harry was stuck at the last question and was certain he messed up the other questions anyway.
Harry sighed. “You wouldn’t understand. Nobody does. That’s also why Ron flipped out. If I had any say in this, none of this would’ve even happened.”
He opened the door and made his way inside with some difficulty. He was in a cozy room with a large king-sized bed in the middle of it. It had black satin covers - fancy - and looked just so inviting with the many fluffy pillows. Harry quickly - and clumsily - got out of his clothes until he was only dressed in his pants and climbed into the large, comfortable bed.
After a much too short time, they both gave up and preferred to enjoy playing chess instead. Harry quickly realized that this was probably a one-time opportunity to talk to Ron seriously about him and Draco. As soon as they finished the game (Ron obviously won), Harry sat up a little and watched Ron carefully put away the chess figures.
“Potter, are you actually pitying me?” Draco asked suddenly. Harry looked up in surprise. Draco’s expression told him that he didn’t like that idea but also, that he couldn’t think of any other explanation for Harry’s behaviour.
More and more students started noticing the heated argument and as Slughorn noticed it too, he started making his way back over to them.
As they arrived in the entrance hall Harry turned to Draco a little nervously. “I think I better go take a shower.” Draco nodded slowly. “You should too,” Harry added. Draco nodded again. “Could we perhaps postpone the study session? I might go lie down.” Draco’s eyes wandered uncertainly to his feet but he looked back up then and mumbled a “’course.” Harry nodded relieved.
“You will be working alone today. Mr. Malfoy wasn’t feeling very well so we agreed that he would write a paper instead.”
Draco noticed the look and cocked his eyebrow leaning back and crossing his arms. “What?” Harry shrugged. “Nothing. I would have just assumed you would want to hurry up so you could go have dinner after.”
Harry frustratedly whined inside while he kept staring at Draco’s profile. “We’re only fighting because you’re avoiding me and taking that stupid potion without telling me anything about it. And besides that, fighting is also a part of it!”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Do we have to discuss this now?” he asked too tired for yet another argument.
Harry knew that Blaise meant it as a joke but he couldn’t help the uncomfortable blush crawling up his neck. He hoped the bad lighting hid it.
Draco looked like he was considering how to reply and decided to go with the truth. “Potter, I have told you, we are not friends.”
“Surely, you both have learned from last week and will now work very productively with each other,” he replied self-assuredly. “Please go over the questions together that you had difficulties with on the test. I’ll be back in an hour.” With that the potions professor escaped the room. Draco groaned in annoyance. Harry could guess why. He was surely not the most competent study buddy. This would be a rather one-sided study session.
“I was not going to jump…?” Draco finally said slowly. Harry actually felt like Draco was being sincere which is why he let out a breath of relief.
“I want to be honest with you,” he started calmly. “I already marked both of your tests and I’m convinced that you would profit immensely if you studied together.” Harry stared at his professor taken aback.
Hermione sighed now as well. “And how do you know that? You have to share dreams at least for a couple more days for sure so it would be smarter to leave this be and keep your conversations as shallow as possible.” Harry knew that Hermione was right but it was too late now.
He was angry. Furious. What were his friends thinking to assume to know anything about what was going on with him? He had told them more than enough for them to know that a compromise with his parents was NEVER a compromise because the only one suffering would be him. Perhaps they should not have become criminals if they feared the Ministry this much.
Draco nodded satisfied and finished his work by thoroughly tousling Harry’s hair once. “That’s what I thought.”
But instead of Draco he spotted Hermione, Ron, Dean, Seamus, Neville, Ginny and Luna outside walking towards him. Harry would’ve loved to disappear instantly but Seamus had already seen him.
Draco nodded thankfully as he heard the familiar screeching of the owls which weren’t that many on a Sunday. Because of that Draco noticed the eagle owl making calmly it’s way to him instantly.
Harry shrugged. “Probably. I don’t know, maybe I also feel a little abandoned because of the potions accident. Before I had the feeling that Draco and I would at least in that sense understand each other. But now I’m all by myself.”
Theo, who just sat down too, cleared his throat awkwardly and gave the students near-by a look signalising them to go back to minding their own business.
Draco sighed frustratedly and put his head in his hands. “I am taking the Dreamless Sleep potion.” He spoke so quietly that Harry nearly didn’t hear him.
"Electing to use thinner cauldrons for muggleborns and half-bloods with little exposure to magic will make them aware of the dangers of brewing, ensuring that they understand the subtlety and care required in the art of Potions." Lucius declared. Here on the Wizengamot floor, he was in his element. Away from the loud complaining of his son, he could focus on his strengths. One of which was navigating the political minefield with ease. "Aside from boosting our economical might thanks to the reduced production costs, they will considerably reduce the quantity of accidents during brewing."
However, there was one final question: would this new development result in less or more letters? On one hand, the venture would take up plenty of Draco Malfoy's time. But, considering that the main focus of said letters was Harry Potter, there was a high chance the number of letters sent by his son would increase.
The most promising of said leads revolved around Herpo the Foul. Multiple sources claimed that Herpo was slain in a duel around 1100BC, however a handful of historical tomes mentioned sightings of a wraith taking the shape of the dark wizard up until 920 BC. Those centuries also reported multiple possessions around a similar area to the Herpo sightings.
Lucius could eliminate Draco's detention rather easily, but the prospect of a night where Draco would not have time to write to him was much more interesting. So, Lucius Malfoy did absolutely nothing. If Draco asked, he'd just say that he received the letter too late to do anything.
Narcissa stifled an uncharacteristic laugh as Lucius Malfoy picked up the letter with a wine stained hand. Somehow Draco had found enough time to write a letter and send it off, even with an evening detention. Lucius just couldn't get a break…
It didn't help that Draco had an unsettling obsession with Harry Potter. Lucius Malfoy had no issue with the fact that his son was spending all his time stalking Potter, scheming about Potter, or just whining about Potter, but his son's lack of interest in pursuing a potential spouse. Maybe now was a good time to consider having a second child. At least then, the Malfoy line wouldn't be in danger of dying out.
The married couple would go on to be highly successful in their respective careers. After a short period of time out of the school, Harry returned for the vacant Defence Against the Dark Arts post where he remained until he finally stepped up to become headmaster of Hogwarts many years later. Draco opted to focus on the Wizengamot, taking up the position of Chief Warlock after acquiring his father's seat.
Devoid of any horcruxes anchoring his soul, Voldemort's spirit dissolved into nothingness in the middle of some Albanian forest.
In the span of a few months, Dumbledore and himself tracked down and destroyed all of Voldemort's horcruxes. As much as Lucius Malfoy hated the man, he had to admit that Dumbledore somehow knew far more about the Dark Lord than anyone else. It also helped that he was one of the most powerful and knowledgeable wizards in the whole world.
Next came the locket once the fake had been retrieved. Lucius recognised R.A.B as Regulus Black, one of his former friends from Hogwarts. The Black family home was the most logical place to look for the real locket. However, neither Lucius nor Dumbledore could bypass the wards surrounding it.
Dobby nodded, apparating away with a snap of his fingers. Lucius Malfoy exhaled as he attempted to reorganise his notes. By the time the house elf returned, Lucius had sat down, ready to read his son's letter.
If he were to discover how Herpo the Foul cheated death, it could shed some light on the Dark Lord's survival also. Perhaps the Ministry had some confiscated tomes they wished to part with, or maybe Borgin and Burke's had acquired some new merchandise recently.
Over the past few months, Draco's relentless writing continued. Each letter still focused on a single topic: Harry Potter. Almost anything else would only receive a brief comment at most. Even the troll attack on Halloween barely got a passing comment about it probably being Potter's fault. Of course, according to his son, everything was Potter's fault. Speaking of Draco, he decided that now was the perfect time to whine some more as his eagle owl dropped the letter onto Lucius Malfoy's lap.
Perhaps he could spearhead the cauldron thickness movement, which failed to garner too much support thus far. That would take up plenty of time. Time that he could spend avoiding his son.
"Dobby!" he called, the house elf appearing almost immediately. "Bring me a bottle of Ogden's finest."
Excusing himself from the conversation, Lucius Malfoy opened Draco's letter, eager to have an alibi to leave the meal early. But maybe he was a little too eager as he placed his hand into the envelope, touching the tearstained parchment. Disgusting.
There was always the option of finding a surrogate parent, however that would be looked down upon by the other old families. Furthermore, the child would also not be recognised as an official heir. The current circumstances highlighted the necessity of a second Malfoy child. He would have to speak to Narcissa about this soon.
If the opportunity presented itself, he could prevent the Dark Lord from properly returning to power. After all, war was not good for the economy or political landscape. But until then, the best thing he could do was ensure Draco kept him informed of the situation in order to choose the best tactics to keep his family alive, his socio-political status intact, and his wealth secure.
Feeling elated at the prospect of a night free from his son's complaining, Lucius prepared dinner plans for a night with his wife. There was a fancy new wizarding restaurant that had opened recently just around the corner from Diagon Alley. Very rarely did Crabbe regard food to be any better than 'decent' or 'good', but in this case, Crabbe told him the food was brilliant. Considering that the man mostly thought with his stomach rather than his brain, it piqued his curiosity.
His musing was interrupted by the subject of his ire. Or at least the subject of his ire's owl. It was only yesterday evening that he was at Hogwarts! He even spoke to Draco while he was there! What could have happened within the past ten hours that warranted yet another letter?
Not the greatest start. Lucius motioned for Narcissa to prepare to leave, before reading the rest of the letter.
Which reminded him, his son would be arriving back home tomorrow. Great. After the events of this evening, he would be absolutely insufferable. It was bad enough with the constant barrage of letters he received over the course of the year, let alone when Draco Malfoy had permanent access to him.
Since Lucius was requested to protect one of the horcruxes, it was highly possible that other high-ranking death eaters had been tasked to do the same. Being one of Voldemort's inner circle, Lucius Malfoy knew that Bellatrix was the only other one of the Dark Lord's followers who he would have trusted enough. Snape might have been an option, but his role as a spy put him out of the picture.
Of course, this was one time he didn't get caught. All his son had to do was be his usual self and Lucius Malfoy would have had an excuse to leave. But because Draco displayed an ounce of cunning for once, he was stuck having breakfast with Dolores Umbridge, discussing that infuriating law on cauldron thickness.
In the end, Harry Potter was not expelled from Hogwarts, nor did he receive any punishment whatsoever. In fact, the entire scenario was created by his son overreacting. Of course it was. He couldn't enjoy a single meal alone with his wife without his son interrupting, despite Draco Malfoy being on the opposite side of the country.
Of course he did. Despite his son having a near death encounter with the Dark Lord just yesterday, Draco was already back to his relentless complaining about Harry Potter. What minor thing did Potter do this time?
But fate had other ideas. An unfortunately familiar eagle owl glided through the open window, before dropping a letter in his lap. It hadn't even been a day. In fact, Lucius was pretty sure that the Hogwarts Express hadn't even arrived yet. Lucius Malfoy sighed and closed the window, before opening the letter from his son.
But he did make one thing abundantly clear to the headmaster. He wasn't doing it out of the goodness of his heart, he just didn't want to deal with the Dark Lord again, or the socioeconomic repercussions surrounding his quest for total dominance.
As if Draco always knew the worst time to arrive, his owl flew through an open window, distracting Lucius Malfoy's train of though. The eagle owl flapped down, scattering his meticulously placed notes and dropped a letter in the middle of his desk.
Lucius Malfoy looked up, yet another owl was outside. This one was a tawny owl, probably owned by the school. He let it in by flicking the window open, awaiting the next letter. The quicker he got through these, the quicker the owls would leave, and he could attempt to salvage his evening. A nap sounded good at the moment, at least he'd be able to ignore the barrage of letters from his son.
It was times like this where Lucius Malfoy strongly considered having another child. Not because he liked children, he absolutely despised the vermin. But purely because he was genuinely terrified of leaving the family name and fortune in Draco's hands someday.
Lucius took a large sip of firewhiskey and sighed. Another letter, another complaint about Harry Potter. He wondered why he still read these letters. There was never anything of worth written, with the one time it seemed there was a matter of urgency, it was just Draco overreacting a spoiling an evening with his wife. Thankfully, his son didn't interrupt the rescheduled dinner, otherwise he would've received a strongly worded howler.
However, unicorn blood was one of the few known substances which could save one from death. If the Dark Lord had somehow survived that fateful night, he must have fled to the Forbidden Forest, living from drinking unicorn blood. Or he possibly travelled even further, unicorns weren't exclusive to the Forbidden Forest after all. Unicorns could be found all over Europe, along with select regions of North America and Asia.
Said meeting went far more smoothly than anticipated. Apparently, he'd been framed and wrongfully imprisoned. In exchange for a trial, Sirius allowed them access to 12 Grimmauld Place. The trial was easy enough to schedule and in the end, Sirius walked out of the courtroom a free man, accompanying Dumbledore and Lucius Malfoy to the Black home where they destroyed Voldemort's final horcrux.
The diary was destroyed first. With time on their side, the two were free to extensively test what could and could not destroy a horcrux. In the end, it was Fiendfyre that finally took the diary out.
It was a relatively quiet few days for Lucius Malfoy, mentally patting himself on the back for that. Sending back some pity chocolate seemed to work. Maybe he should try that more often, or better yet, shove it in his face if he began to whinge at home. With much less ire than Sunday, Lucius Malfoy opened his son's letter, hoping for the contents to be worthwhile rather than about Harry Potter. (Spoiler: it wasn't)
At least it provided a distraction from the woman across the table from him. Despite the two having similar beliefs and goals, Lucius Malfoy absolutely detested the foul woman known and Dolores Umbridge. He was pretty sure that the only reason she was kept as Senior Undersecretary was solely because she was able to distract any opposition with her vileness, allowing the more important players to make their moves with relative ease.
Once he confirmed that the letter was indeed from his son, Lucius poured a generous glass of firewhiskey and sat down. Pinching the bridge of his nose, Lucius read Draco's second letter of the day. The first day of Hogwarts wasn't even a full day, yet his son somehow required his father to correspond to two different letters in the same day.
Lucius Malfoy had thrown himself into his research. Of course, it helped that the Malfoys had an extensive library with a heavy focus on the dark arts. Just what he needed to find the answers he required. Some selective visits to some of his allies involving gold changing hands filled some of the gaps and were invaluable in the discovery of a handful of leads.
Harry worried his lip with his teeth. If he was being honest, he wasn’t all that bothered. One month was absolutely manageable.
“I suppose Father thought it was some kind of honour and besides that, they were much too afraid of the consequences. In their own way they did everything to not let it happen.” Draco swallowed. “The Dark Lord does not ask for favours; it is not as if they had a choice.” That sounded plausible. One shouldn’t forget how deep and long Draco’s parents were caught in this whole deal.
Draco looked down. “So, Draco, huh?” Harry furrowed his brows. He had indeed called Malfoy Draco just now.
Harry nodded slowly but didn’t pry any further. Uncertain if he should talk about the war with Draco now, he stayed quiet. He couldn’t quite tell how far he was allowed to go. Without feeling Draco’s emotions, it was much harder to avoid misunderstandings. Especially with difficult topics talking in a dream was really helpful.
Goyle was one of many Slytherins that had been – for a lack of a better word – forced by the Ministry to go back to Hogwarts for their finals. Most of them weren’t exactly looking forward to returning. And most of the other students shared that sentiment and decided to show their dissatisfaction through malicious comments or simple disregard. Draco was quite glad that him and his friends were more feared than hated which kept them out of a lot of trouble but they were still cautious to not wander around alone in case they were to run into a group of students that had lost loved ones in the war.
He heard a gasp, a crash and suddenly a burning hot liquid hit his face making him stumble. Distantly he could hear Slughorn’s voice taking off points of both of their houses and reprimanding them for their behaviour.
“That’s not- I don’t like him, I’m just beginning to understand him!” Ron and Hermione exchanged a meaningful look. “Don’t look like that, at least I’m telling you now.” Harry had no idea how to get out of this.
Seamus just about managed to hide his burst of laughter and Ginny just rubbed her forehead shaking her head.
Harry woke up gasping for breath and looked around. Ron was just getting out of bed and looked at Harry in surprise.
The Great Hall was already full when Ron and Harry walked in a little later than usual. Hermione was already there talking happily with Ginny over the table. Harry wasn’t too happy about needing to sit next to his ex, especially now when he was trying to figure out how strong his desire to kiss Draco was but Ron didn’t give him a choice since he wanted to sit next to his girlfriend and Harry would have a better view to the Slytherin table this way.
The others stayed quiet. Seamus and Dean were suddenly very interested in their shoes but Ron didn’t look like he had calmed down yet.
Harry’s steps quickened and after another glance at the Map he saw that Draco had arrived at his destination. Harry climbed the flight of winding stairs as fast as possible and put away the Map. As soon as he swung the door to the viewing deck open, he stopped, breathing heavily. Draco who was standing a few meters away at the railing nearly fell over in shock but just caught himself in time and stared at Harry like he lost his mind.
Hermione picked thoughtfully at her hair. “I’m sorry, Harry. Perhaps we should’ve been a bit more considerate. But you have to understand that it is difficult for us, and especially Ron, to simply forget the past.”
“You know, even if I did that, you shouldn’t give a shit about it,” Harry replied. He had no intention of losing this playful debate.
“Are you certain that you are able to not be curious for a minute?” Draco asked, still drily, but Harry saw a slow smirk build on Draco’s lips.
It was nice walking through the melting snow, telling each other dumb stories and just having fun. They didn’t meet many other students which helped them relax further. Harry knew that his friends had wanted to go to the Three Broomsticks Inn so he lead Draco quickly to the Hog’s Head straight across the field instead. He could imagine that Draco was grateful for it. They stepped back onto the path that was barely free of snow and came to a halt in front of the worn-down inn. Draco suddenly decided to wait outside, probably to avoid running into any other students which could turn the situation uncomfortable. Harry agreed and stepped into the inn alone.
Professor McGonagall was prepared for anything but not for a dishevelled-looking Harry Potter running towards her on her way to her office.
Harry simply nodded slowly even if he knew that it wasn’t so easy. Theo moved next to him and watched just as expectantly at the bleak stone wall. Harry considered saying something but decided against it. Theo also didn’t seem like he was in a talkative mood. So, they remained silent and waited. Harry couldn’t help nervously worrying his lip with his teeth. Which he instantly stopped when he realized. Instead he started nervously moving his body minutely up and down. Fuck, what was taking Draco so long?
“I’m at least catching you up in all the other classes. But don’t you dare not keep up next week with your studies or I will have to beat it into your brain again,” Draco said and Harry sighed.
Slughorn deemed it a good idea to do a surprise test explaining that it was a good way to find out for themselves how well they were doing. Hermione was actually happy about it while Ron and Harry groaned in annoyance. The other students sat down and took out their quills. Harry who was sitting in the front row – not by choice, mind you – next to Ron, who just sat there to copy off of Hermione, suddenly felt a paper ball hit the back of his head. Surprised, he turned around and was greeted by Draco’s satisfied smirk.
“Good, don’t you want to sit?” Harry asked quickly and moved over a bit. Luna sat down next to him but not so that her feet were under the table but so that she could stand right back up again.
Draco interrupted Harry by standing up straight and shouldering his bag. Harry shot a look behind him and saw Blaise leaving the classroom. He looked a bit annoyed but his expression was controlled. Just a few seconds later, Ron also came out. His desperate expression spoke volumes. Harry gave Draco a quick look who nodded at him and quickly walked over to Blaise. Ron joined Harry.
“I’m always on your side, Draco, but ignoring your parents is only going to worsen things,” Pansy decided to add too which was the last straw for Draco.
Draco shot him an evil look. “Not like you asked me.” Harry looked down at his hands and wondered whether he should be ashamed of his dreams or if it was all the same to Draco.
“Come on. It’s getting cold,” Draco said as soon as the laughter faded and held out a hand for Harry. Harry took it and let himself be pulled up.
Draco pulled his hand back in mock-offence. “Hey! In comparison to you, I still walk around. For the last few days, it was like you disappeared off the face of the earth.”
Instead of making a biting remark over Potter’s lacking Potions expertise, Draco bit his tongue and ignored Harry’s question.
“Could you just please wait a second?” Harry asked without really allowing a “no” for an answer. Draco didn’t say anything and just gave him a questioning look. Harry frowned.
“The bloke can hear you,” he grumbled sleepily. The surprised looks from his friends fell on him. Hermione threw Ron a challenging look and pushed a sandwich into his hand. Ron nearly rolled his eyes but then slowly approached Harry.
Not ten minutes later Harry wrapped up his detailed recounting of his dream and watched his friends expectantly. Ron just stared at him in that flabbergasted way and Hermione looked at him with only concern in her eyes.
“If you do not speak to Professor Slughorn today in class, I will!” That was the last thing Hermione said regarding the topic.
He told Ginny about the potion and how he and Draco were sharing dreams. He also told her how he had begun to understand Draco’s actions from the hours spent in detention and how they started becoming friends. He also admitted that he didn’t always tell the truth to Ron and Hermione to avoid confrontations. Ginny listened patiently and didn’t move a muscle. Finally, she nodded slowly and looked at Harry in a thoughtful way.
Harry went silent again. But he could not think of any plausible reason for Draco to keep this whole thing a secret considering he loved to complain about everything. Suddenly he remembered something.
“Draco would definitely have been the Seeker again!” Draco tilted his head hearing his name being dropped.
Harry’s heart did a little flip, despite knowing that potions coaching would probably be the better thing to do. “Okay!” He turned in his chair towards Draco. He did the same so that they were facing each other. Draco looked tired. Harry wondered what Draco did in his free time. Probably studying. That would definitely explain the tired look.
Harry shot up shocked and looked around in the Gryffindor dorms. It was still the middle of night and the last dream made him shudder. That Draco wasn’t here completely out of free will was something Harry had assumed but he definitely didn’t imagine it to be like this.
“No, thanks,” Harry replied. He couldn’t think of anyone who would need to know besides his friends who were patiently waiting outside for the story.
Oof looks like it's been a month. I would apologize if it were for any other reason so instead I want to thank you all for your patience, especially Sam. You are truly a sweetheart.
Harry looked up and went still. “You are the only one without a partner so do not give me that look,” hissed Draco letting his bag fall next to him and eyed Harry warily. Harry shot a pleading look to his right where his best friends were discussing some ingredients. They didn’t notice the distress exuding of their friend from their left.
Harry tilted his head pensively while he watched Draco closer. That the Slytherin was attractive was obvious but was he attractive enough for Harry to want to kiss him? His lips did look quite enticing. Harry couldn’t help but imagine how they would feel. They looked damned soft so Harry knew that they had to feel good. The fluttering in his stomach increased just like the pressure on his chest.
“That wasn’t fair!,” Harry yelled while trying to hold Draco down beneath him and smear greenery onto him. But Draco proved a worthy opponent as he got free from Harry’s hold, grabbed him by his neck and nearly managed to push him face first into a heap of leaves. Harry made a sound of indignation, moved out of the grip, jumped up and stumbled a few steps back.
A relieved sigh released the tense atmosphere and Harry let himself fall back into the couch. He knew that he couldn’t just forgive Ron but Ron probably felt the same way so this was the best solution for now.
Happy Easter! Enjoy this little chapter and new fun fact about Draco ;) Hope you are all staying inside and treating yourself. You deserve it <3
“The Jobberknoll feathers and dirigible plums at the same time in three… two… one!” Harry quickly grabbed the ingredients and threw them into the kettle as he was told.
“Well, it is completely irrelevant now that we don’t have a team this year anyway!” hissed Theo before Draco could reply. Pansy looked miffed but didn’t comment any further.
Harry glanced to the teacher’s table where Slughorn was having an animated conversation with Professor Sprout who was smiling at him too brightly.
“Okay,” Draco broke the silence and took the sandwich. He eyed it again a bit suspiciously but then took a bite. Harry observed him tensed. Draco put down the sandwich next to him and took his quill back into his hand. Before he started writing again, he glanced up at Harry.
Right before dinner, he headed towards the dungeons and got, as planned, two sandwiches from the house elves in the kitchen. Nervously, he headed to the Potions classroom. Slughorn was already waiting for him, Draco hasn’t arrived yet, though. He got informed that a cure potion was being worked on but it would take a while still. Harry simply nodded and began his usual copying assignment.
Ron was still incredibly angry. He couldn’t understand why Harry hadn’t yet apologized to him and he was also angry with himself because Hermione made him feel guilty and that by being right.
“I don’t want- I just- You don’t understand!” Harry tried to explain but realized soon enough that he himself had no clue why he was behaving the way he was.
Something must have woken him considering that he usually didn’t wake up between his and Draco’s dreams. Harry groaned and turned in bed before reaching under his mattress to grab the Marauder’s Map. He activated it hurriedly and feverishly searched for Draco’s name in the Slytherin dorms. He didn’t find him anywhere in the dungeons, instead it appeared that Draco was slowly but surely moving to the astronomy tower.
Harry moved out of Draco’s reach and fixed his hair again which probably didn’t help anyway. “Do you want to keep studying?” Harry asked seriously and very unmotivated.
“Uhm,” was the only thing Harry managed to say before he turned to Ron looking for help. But he just seemed deeply satisfied with Harry’s fall from grace. Even Hermione was hiding a grin.
It looked just as dirty and poorly lit inside as he remembered seeing it every year before this. Harry greeted Aberforth in a friendly manner, even entertained a little small talk but quickly ended the conversation before the topic of school grades could come up. Aberforth handed him the two ordered butterbeers in the usual dusty bottles and wished Harry a nice weekend. Harry thanked him and left the Inn with the bottles in hand.
Harry turned around surprised. He hadn’t even noticed Neville walking over to them. Harry shot Draco an inquiring look who shook his head in indifference.
“This fight is stupid and would like to bury the hatchet,” Ron stumbled over his words while he held the sandwich out to Harry. Harry noticed Hermione looking proudly at Ron out of his peripheral.
Harry’s behind hurt from the fall. Apparently, he fell back with his chair. Slowly, he got back up. Draco was still sitting cross-legged in front of him grinning contently.
Harry couldn’t help but keep his eyes on his hands. He fought the urge to hide behind a pillow. It was out now. He would’ve died if he had kept that in any longer. He didn’t even want to linger on the meaning of the dream, he just wanted to say it out loud so the pressure on his chest would loosen up. But it didn’t lessen, and Ron was already quiet for a dangerously long time. Harry finally dared to look up. Ron looked a little pale around his nose but other than that he didn’t seem angry at least.
Draco pensively rolled his wand between his fingers back and forth. Then he lifted his wand, pointed it at Harry and before he could react he heard Draco say “Somnium Lucidum”.
“You were gone for an eternity, I didn’t know you would just suddenly fall over,” Draco explained himself, still amused.
“That is mad!” Ron replied after Harry had recounted the story of his dream at the breakfast table. Hermione furrowed her brows in concern and seemed to be thinking intensively about the meaning of all of this.
Draco shook his head defensively. “That is enough, Potter. We are not friends, what is wrong with you?” Harry wasn’t so sure himself but the concern for Draco opened a door to a whole new set of emotions for Draco. Positive emotions.
Harry fidgeted impatiently during the whole breakfast. His leg kept bouncing throughout and kept making everyone around him just as nervous. Draco just didn’t seem to want to show up. Not even his friends did. Besides Theodore Nott and Pansy Parkinson who barely ate something for five minutes before leaving again. Even though Harry wasn’t particularly hungry he forced himself to eat at least a little. Ron just annoyed him more by giving him looks and also being in a bad mood so Harry started making his way to class earlier than usual.
“Do you maybe want to tell us now what happened last night?” she whispered trying not to catch Seamus’ attention but Seamus would not be Seamus if he didn’t hear them still.
“The fuck,” Blaise hissed at Draco and ran his hand through his hair getting out some scrambled eggs.
Draco stayed silent for a moment before he relieved Harry with a light smile. “Yes, fine, silly. As long as your honourable best friend doesn’t attack me, I’m fine with that.”
The rest of the students lingering about didn’t seem to care much for the both of them so Harry did sit down. Draco observed him unimpressed.
“Then ignore it. Show him that it’s not important to you and that he shouldn’t be ashamed of it,” Hermione said insistently.
“You said you’d rather die than come back here. It didn’t really sound like a joke and then I woke up. I usually never wake before morning,” Harry tried to explain himself while he walked over to the Slytherin. Draco fought the desire to move away and kept eyeing him. Harry was certain that even a blind person could notice his serious concern but for Draco this all seemed to be rather strange than comforting.
Harry shook his head mechanically. “Damn it, Ron. I just had a stupid dream. I didn’t want a complete analysis of mine and Draco’s existence.”
Draco closed his eyes relaxing while leaning his head back against a shelf. “Are you planning on raiding the kitchens again?”
Slughorn stared doubtfully at him for a couple of seconds, then he looked up noticing someone behind Harry. “Mr. Malfoy, please follow me and Mr. Potter right now into my office. The rest of you get the ingredients listed on the board ready.”
At that Harry’s pride made itself known which is why he immediately protested. “Alright, I’m in but I actually have no idea how to lose.” Harry said confidently. It couldn’t be that hard.
Harry knew for an unexplainable reason that Draco wouldn’t change his mind which was why he didn’t even try to stop Draco as he got up and walked to the door.
Draco shrugged. “I don’t call you Harry either.” Harry’s skin prickled slightly. Draco had never said name this calmly, almost soft.
Ron eyed him still nervously. “Harry, I-,” Ron started but Harry held up a hand stopping him mid-sentence.
I had planned on updating this before I went on a little vacation but life happened so yeah. But I hope you enjoy this chapter and the next one should be done soon too ^-^
They spent the rest of the way back discussing various Quidditch teams. Draco wasn’t all that involved anymore why he let Harry catch him up on the newest results. Their hands only separated just before the Entrance Hall, where their ways would part as well but they only paused their conversation to pick it back up in their dream.
“Fuck,” murmured Harry into the room. He got up and went to shower. The others would get up soon too and he needed to compose himself first.
After they were free from Voldemort, they had to bury their loved ones who they had lost during the war. Then they partied - well, if you can call it partying that is. Most of them got drunk in attempt to forget the grief or, the other few ones, to celebrate their victory. It was too loud, sad and filled with hysterical laughter.
“You said that not everyone is as careless about their grades like me. I figured you do care.” Harry felt proud of his lie but still felt a little strange.
Harry gaped. “That was-,” he stopped and pushed Draco a bit, outraged. This time the Slytherin even laughed and got up to save himself from Harry’s attack.
Harry’s heart didn’t want to calm down which he blamed on missing Draco so damned much. Before Draco could say anything, Harry grabbed the blonde by his hand and dragged him behind him. They didn’t have to walk for long before Harry found an empty classroom into which he pulled Draco. Harry let go off Draco’s hand and shut the door. Then he turned to him. Harry opened his mouth, wanted to say something that would explain everything but he couldn’t think of anything. Draco just stood in front of him and looked back unyielding.
The grip on Harry’s hips tightened as he tried to find friction once again, he whimpered, and pulled back, but Draco’s lips didn’t leave his skin; and instead continued trailing down his neck to find that special spot below his jaw. Draco’s lips were soft at first, but became more demanding, and his grip on Harry’s hips lessened as Harry’s hands wove their way through bleach blonde hair and tugged. Draco groaned, and Harry took advantage of the loosened grip; he ground his cock against Draco’s getting the friction he so desired, and moaned as Draco began nibbling and sucking at his neck.
Just when they were on the verge of passing out, they noticed that they definitely weren’t floating. Their hands still connected, their eyes simultaneously rolled into the back of their heads and everything went dark.
“So.. you’re married?” Harry whirled around, his wand in his hand fast as the flash. He faltered when he saw it was just Blaise. He put his hand to his chest as if to calm his racing heart.
Hermione took a deep breath to calm herself, and stepped over the wards. She felt the wards accept her, and she gave the thumbs up to Ron and Gin behind her without turning around. She heard their footsteps follow her in, and she looked at the messy kitchen in disgust before turning back to her objective; the bedroom.
“I was reading a rune book, because I was bored of potions,” Draco scoffed, and brought his hand up to massage through Harry’s hair.
Draco was sitting in his dorm when Pansy approached him, “You can tell me anything you know,” she said, flipping a piece of her short hair over her shoulder dramatically. Draco looked up from his book, one on runes, and gave her a once over before looking back down to his book and continuing to read, he wanted to get home
It was just the potter luck to have the solution to your problems right in front of you, only for them to be ripped away. Harry sighed as he woke, his head was resting across his arms on a desk- wait, no it was a coffee table. A book was splayed open to page 274 beneath his arms. Potions, ew! Harry sighed again, but this time it caught in his throat, and turned into a cough. He tried to stop, his hands clutching at his throat, he felt as if he was choking. He reached for pansy’s cat mug with shaky hands, and managed a sip before coughing again. He knew what this was. It meant that he was right, which also meant that they only had 4 months to leave before they died. Tears spilled out of his eyes as the coughing got worse, and he gripped the table beneath him hard enough to crack the wood.
“You and Potter kinda,” Blaise hesitated, “Just passed out at the same time. It was pretty loud, WHO KNEW POTTER HAD SUCH A HEAVY HEAD!” Blaise yelled across the hall, which was now filled with it’s usual chatter.
“Ouch!” Harry spoke as his head banged against something wooden. He brought his hand up to rub at the sore spot, before he realized he couldn’t see and began to panic. He was hurriedly feeling around when he heard a soft thump from his left.
“What was that?” Harry said, shoving a piece of chicken in his mouth before cupping his ear as if it would increase his hearing.
“Of course he wouldn-,” he stopped himself and he turned to glare at both Pansy and Blaise, “Get out,” he growled. They both just grinned at each other like idiots,
“Holy fuck Draco,” a voice whispered to his left, he turned towards the voice and saw it was his tall, dark-skinned handsome bestfreind,
up, for now anyway. Though it was a disgusting sight, seeing the weasel stuff his mouth is much better than hearing what comes out of it.
Potter,” she smirked, “So now, I know that not only is there something going on with Potter that you know about, but there's something going on between the two of you as well!” she said with a triumphant smile, and Blaise chose that time to walk in as well.
The healer nodded and pointed to a brunette woman talking to the headmaster, “That’s my partner, she checked up on the Malfoy kid, seems he’s doing pretty well. Nothing to cause the blackout either,” Harry nodded his thanks, and the healer left to be with his partner, who blushed as he approached.
“If you wanted to fuck, all you had to do was ask,” Blaise said as Draco finally snatched the book after rubbing himself all over Blaise, on accident of course, and had fell back down into place. “Though I don’t think Potter would be happy about that,” Draco scoffed.
A couple minutes later Harry came through the doors, and Draco led him to the prefect's bathroom in which the password was ‘tide’. The walls were a grey stone, and the floors a light blue tile. A tub as big as a pool filled the right side of the room, and through a door to the left were the showers and commodes; along the left wall, there was also a set of sinks.
His coughing must've been loud, because there were hands on his back, rubbing in soothing circles. “Harry,” the voice sobbed, and Harry instantly knew it was Draco. He raised his hands from the table just in time to catch the small black rose petal covered in blood, before it hit the floor.
“How did it happen?” Snape persisted, his face completely bewildered, “You guys were complete enemies. I ju-”
Harry nodded sheepishly, “Yeah sorry,” He blushed, and brought his hand up to scratch the back of his neck, which Draco smacked away.
After a while, Blaise had fallen asleep and Draco had finished his book with not a peep of the word ‘mors’ or potions that worked with time, flower, and death runes. He sighed and stood, cracking his back as quietly as possible and walked softly over to his chest. He opened the black container and placed the book in a compartment to the left, reaching his hand into one on the right, grabbing a new one, this time potions. He was just about to lay back down when there was a soft knock at his door. His eyes darted to Blaise to make sure he was still asleep, he was, before stalking quietly towards the door. He pulled the handle open and saw nothing, knowing it was Harry, he stepped to the side and let him in before closing the door soundlessly. Harry pulled the cloak down from his head and smiled at Draco, his right hand was holding the cloak together, so his left hand stuck out and grabbed Draco’s free one, the one that wasn’t occupied by the book, in his and led him to the bed. They sat on the surface carefully, Harry haven taken note of the sleeping man in the corner. He closed the curtain and wordlessly placed multiple silencing wards and sticking charms on the bed to make sure the curtains couldn’t be opened, and no noise could escape.
Draco smirked and stood. He shrugged off the leather jacket he was wearing; allowing his muscles to bulge more than necessary, and sat back down. He brushed off his grey tee-shirt, and took his knife and fork, carefully cutting his steak. (Why was he hungry? He just ate for Merlin's sake!)
“I love you too,” Draco said, staring into his darling's bright emerald eyes. He was, and would always, be in love with this man. He couldn’t help but thank Merlin that they’d found each other, no matter how ugly they were to each other at first. Draco sighed, wishing he could just stare into those eyes forever. All things had to come to and end, however, and so they began the trek out to the quidditch field. The walk was slow, and though it was spring, the wind still had a chill.
Their tongues twined together, and Draco blindly shoved his hand into the bedside drawer, looking for the jar of lube.
” he said, anger saturating his voice, and his jaw clenched before he spoke once more, “We need to go talk to professor Snape,” his voice left no room for argument, and so the couple followed him out of the common room and down to the hall by the girls dorms.
“Draco said he lost your only chance to get back home, what did he mean by that?” Blaise asked, crossing his arms as he leaned back in the gray chair.
“Yeah! The whole of Hogwarts was so shocked, as if it wasn’t inevitable! Do you remember how many gallons Pansy earned?” Harry giggled.
Hermione turned around, “Insurance, in case we’re not in their wills!” she giggled. Ron and Ginny looked lost for a moment before they got it,
“Please Draco!” Harry pleaded, as Draco continued kissing around the area he desperately wanted touched, but not touching it at all. Draco chuckled before looking up at Harry,
Draco placed his hands on Harry’s hips and pushed him away lightly, “Yes, I know. That’s because I made dinner,” Harry’s head tilted in confusion,
- I shouldn't have written this, because knowing me, I won't update for forever. I mean... take my other story as an example i haven't updated in weeks, sigh, and that was just with one now I have two-
in his life had he seen Draco treat books with such disrespect. He blinked rather harshly as he saw a short brunette run from the bed and grab Draco’s arm.
Draco blinked tiredly, but his eyes flew wide open when he saw the people at the foot of the bed. He shoved Harry awake, just registering the wind. Harry opened his eyes, and looked at Draco in silent question, Draco just pointed towards the end of the bed. He looked in the
“Hey draco! I think I’m in a coff-” he began to yell before his words were cut off by a rather harsh tug at his navel.
lost our only chance to get back home,” he gripped the fabric of Harry’s (his) black turtleneck tightly and cried into Harry’s chest. Harry’s hand on his back paused for a moment before his motions resumed as comforting as ever.
“No Harry,” the blonde sobbed, “It’s- Oh Harry, it’s not your fault, you did everything you could,” he shifted and pulled his darling into his side, holding him close. Tears fell from his eyes and into the raven's hair. “Oh, Harry,” he sighed sadly.
“Best day of my life,” Harry said, and then he thought for a minute, “well… besides the day we came out,” Harry smirked just thinking about it, and Draco matched him, letting out a little laugh before he spoke,
Draco obediently sped up, “Fuck, Harry,” Draco groaned, “So tight, so warm” One of Draco’s hands left the headboard and griped at Harry’s cock, stroking with ferocity; he could feel his orgasm coming, and he wanted Harry to finish with him.
“Draco!” Harry yelled, pulling on Draco’s arm and trying to get him to stop. “Draco Malfoy!” he said and stepped in front of his husband, but he was pushed aside lightly in Draco’s panic to look through the books. Harry scoffed and put his hands on his hips, his face red in anger. “DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY-POTTER!” he screamed, frightening not only Blaise but Draco as well, who instantly stopped what he was doing and looked at Harry. Blaise really was grateful for the silencing charms that were built into each dorm, he didn’t, at the moment, want to be part of a brawl at 1am because of the potter boy’s yelling.
, Hermione thought. After gathering allies, she simply joined the dark side. The day of the battle, when Harry went into the forest and came out dead, she was so Happy she wouldn’t have to kill the
Draco added the second and third fingers before he pressed against that spot, “Yes! Yes! Fuck, Draco! Right there!” Harry moaned as Draco rammed his fingers against his prostate over and over again.
,” Draco opened his mouth to say something but hesitated, and then looked down; a blush maring his cheeks,
“Yes! Oh Merlin!” Just as Draco’s warm cum filled Harry’s channel, Harry’s own cum splattered over their chests.
A smile took over Harry’s face and he all but flew over the table to attack Draco. His lips, red and full, connected with Draco’s pink ones. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck, and twined his fingers through the soft, untamable hair, before grabbing Harry’s sides and dragging him the rest of the way across the table.
“Diei tempus removere ab ibamus subsidat montem morte draco Harrius et cetera,” Hermione and the weasels paused as the room was flooded with a strong gust of wind, and the window above the bed flew open. Harry and Draco shifted, and their eyes opened groggily.
- Do you like the plot? I mean, it's not hard to see how the story ends -_-, but i hope it livens up.
“So I’m ok? What about him?” Ronald looked at Harry like he was crazy for worrying about Malfoy's health.
“Take the sperm, produce the heirs, get the fortune!” Ginny grinned. Hermione nodded with a grin of her own and placed the tubes in her bag.
. Not a single breath, not a single beat of his heart. Snape began to sob as he held the boy's head to his chest.
A few hours later, mashed potatoes, green beans, and chicken (Harry’s choice meal) lay on a small table for two covered in candles. Draco dimmed the lights and made it to the door just in time for Harry’s own magic to flux over the locks. When Harry stepped over the door frame he sniffed and shoved his coat by the door, before turning to face Draco, “Hello, Love,” Harry smiled, and strolled towards Draco.
Blaise's thought was interrupted by Harry’s scolding. “You. Pushed. Me,” Harry said, each word filled with anger, and when Draco went to talk, Harry put his finger in the air, Draco’s mouth closed audibly. Harry took a few deep breaths and put his hand to his forehead to quell the oncoming headache. He took a deep breath and looked back to Draco, softening instantly at the guilt and apologies bared in his gray eyes, “What has you so panicked?” he asked, taking one of Draco’s hands in his.
which quickly healed the blondes nose. The man reached up and wiped the blood from his nose, before turning to Harry with amazement,
The posts went out without a hitch, and Draco made his way home. As it was July 31st, Harry’s official birthday, Draco made quick work of the post and hurried home to cook His husband a birthday dinner, something he did every year.
Draco led the teenage version of his husband to the big bath, and they stripped down before stepping in. Harry turned to his love and sighed, Draco looked back at him, the face usually full of love and hopeless adoration, marred with stress. They were both thinking the same thing;
In the end, Draco and Harry found out that the weasels and bushy haired bitch have been planning to kill Harry since 5th year, he was just added to the plan when he
Draco’s face scrunched up, “You’re right!” he said before shoving a big spoon full of mashed potatoes in his mouth, Harry giggled and Draco smiled; because
“Draco,” he rasped, tears in his eyes from the coughing and from the thought of dying, of leaving Draco. “I’m sorry,” he said, “I should’ve- I should’ve figured it out sooner,”
“When we slept out by the lake, accidentally,” Draco’s eyebrows shot up and he looked at Harry in surprise before he nodded. Harry smiled before continuing, “Well, I found the runes that match our sequence, the potion can only be found in that book,” Draco smiled at the thought of going home and getting revenge, before he stretched his mind to the memory of that morning, trying to remember where he placed the book. Harry looked at him curiously as he thought for a few minutes
Draco sat down in his desk chair and slouched guiltily, “I’m so sorry,” he said, his eyes brimming with tears. Harry hurried over, and dragged Draco’s head into his chest, rubbing his back as tears leaked silently from the blonde’s eyes.
Draco pulled his fingers out, and Harry whimpered at the loss. “Draco Please! Please fuck me already!” Draco moved his head to whisper in Harry’s ear,
The door to the flat was locked, and a simple flex of his magic allowed Draco in. He shook his head at the clothes scattered across the living room, with a small smile on his face.
Harry ended up laughing just because Draco was laughing and Draco bent over to clutch his stomach making Harry fall out of his lap with a small thud. He laughed even harder as Harry glared at him, and the wheels of his chair slid across the ground catching on the edge of the desk causing the chair to fall backwards. This time it was Harry laughing as Draco groaned in pain, and Blaise stared at the couple bewildered. “Hey!” he yelled, catching their attention, and the laughing stopped. They both looked up at him from their positions on the floor, Harry smiled at him and stood up before extending his hand and helping Draco up. Once they were both sitting on the bed, all spells taken down, they turned to him to await questions. Blaise sighed in relief,
Hermione scoffed, and focused on the task at hand: break into the bastard’s apartment. It should be easy considering Harry wasn’t smart, right….
Draco’s eyes looked into Harry’s, “What are you looking at me like that for?” he asked, a slight blush on his face.
Blaise stood and walked over to a bookshelf on the far wall near a wall-length window showing the depths of the black lake.
Draco nodded, “Yes darling, I always do on your birthday,” Harry’s eyes widened, and he pulled back even further from Draco. Draco closed his eyes and shook his head with a minuscule smile, “You forgot your birthday, didn’t you?” he opened his eyes to look into Harry’s jewel like ones.
, “and your enemies closer. Anyway,” He turned his eyes back to his plate after spelling his shirt clean, “What happened?” He shoved the piece of steak into his mouth, chewing it thoroughly.
Harry’s hands speedily made their way to Draco’s buttons, and ripped the shirt, not caring about the buttons clattering on the floor. Apparently Draco had enough of the chair in the dining room, because he apparated to the bedroom, where he promptly shoved Harry on the bed, and spelled their clothes away with a flick of his wrist, before crawling his way over Harry, and straddling the poor man.
Draco shook his head before putting a hand to his forehead, and pulling it away with the piece of mashed potato. He looked back up to Harry in horror, said boy was covering his mouth with his hand choking on laughter. Draco scoffed and waited before he was through laughing to point his hand at his face with a smug expression. Harry paused before bringing his hand up to his face, scooping something white from his chin. He looked at draco in suspicion, and raised an eyebrow. This
As the only remaining Black outside of Azkaban, Narcissa was able to access Bellatrix Lestrange's vault. Dumbledore immediately identified the cup amongst the sea of valuables. From there, the diadem and ring followed soon after.
When the Dark Lord attempted to kill the Potters on Halloween, he unintentionally turned Harry Potter into a living horcrux. Through a plan involving weeks of research, precise dosages of basilisk venom, and a crying Phoenix, Harry Potter was freed of Voldemort's influence once and for all.
"Of course. It wouldn't do for our family to be the reason for the Boy who Lived's banishment from our world. So, same time tomorrow then?" she asked dejectedly, giving a half-hearted smile to her husband.
Today was one of those days. First of all, it was a Sunday so there was very little work carried out in the Ministry, and even less that involved him. But secondly (and most importantly), it was the first day of term at Hogwarts. With his son having departed on the Hogwarts Express that morning, he was no longer obligated to listen to his incessant whining in regards to that Potter boy.
He had planned to enjoy the peace and quiet of Malfoy Manor today, basking on front of the fire, and getting started on his reading list. Augustus Rookwood's younger cousin recently published a dissertation on blood purity, which apparently was quite enthralling. One of the house elves placed it on the side, along with a nice cup of tea for him. It was now time to get some well deserved rest.
Lucius Malfoy smiled at Draco displaying some competence for once. He skimmed past his complaining of Potter, expecting that to take up the remainder of the letter, but one line caught his eye:
"I'll have to alter my schedule, but yes, tomorrow for certain." Lucius Malfoy replied, before kissing his wife's cheek. He took a handful of floo powder, heading off to Hogwarts.
Over the many years that ensued, there were many changes within the wizarding world, both big and small. But if there was one thing that stayed the same, something that made Lucius Malfoy want to hex the nearest person: Draco's letters. They just never stopped. No matter what he was doing, or how long it had been since the last one, Lucius Malfoy constantly received his son's letters.
His eldest son had fallen for the Potter boy, that much was obvious. At least he didn't have to worry about his son failing to find a spouse anymore, although this posed a new problem.
Draco Malfoy mellowed out considerably towards the latter portion of their Hogwarts education. He even befriended Hermione, who was made his best woman at the wedding. Naturally, Harry chose Ron to stand with him as best man.
Summoning a quill and parchment, Lucius began his reply, only to be interrupted by the sound of scraping outside the window. Hopefully, the stupid owl managed to get locked out, or a tree had grown too close to the window. Lucius paid it little mind.
Despite the Wizengamot's obvious ill feelings towards the bill, Lucius continued. "Since those children of wizarding origins will have received a certain amount of tutoring before arriving at Hogwarts, they will have already been made aware of risks surrounding the subject. Thus a more economical option has been chosen, by maintaining the current cauldron thickness for those students, it will reduce the need for replacements."
Perhaps it was time to look into the ability to survive certain death. Unicorn blood would keep a person alive, at a terrible price, but even it couldn't stop a killing curse. There had to be something else in play here and Lucius would be the one to discover it.
Skimming over the letter again, Lucius could only find a single instance where the house points could be altered. Either Draco's reward should be increased to sixty points, or Weasley and that Granger girl should lose ten points each to make it even. The headmaster would probably argue that the cup had already been awarded (like that stopped him) or would choose the first option. That would leave a difference of five house points. And no, Lucius Malfoy was not going to comb over the list of every single points addition and deduction throughout the year, just to please his spoilt brat of a child.
Elphias Doge, his main opposition regarding the currently debated legislation stood up. "You appear to have neglected mentioning how this will affect pure-blooded children. I presume that they will continue using the current standard size two cauldrons."
