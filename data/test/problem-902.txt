. Next to them sat the Christmas tree, its strings of golden lights filling the room with warmth, and there was a fire crackling away in the hearth.
After a few minutes of listening to Teddy explain his Crayola crayons coloring methods, Andromeda walked back into the room, two filled wine glasses in hand, and sat down on the couch next to Harry.
“Ah,” Draco said, as though that was explanatory enough.
Harry hadn’t expected to feel so shitty after the war.
“No, no,” Draco said, shaking his head. “This is lovely, and I’m sure Mother is going to be over the moon. Please, come in.”
. I’m
“I know you’re awake, Harry. Really, you’re a
He swore he could see Malfoy smirk as he set about putting the bouquet together. Meanwhile, Harry wandered around the shop, putting all of his frazzled energy into admiring the different flora.
“Thank you, Harry. I love it,” Draco said, smiling warmly as he put the cauldron back in the box.
“—No,” Malfoy said, grabbing Harry’s arm to stop him from turning around. “No, sorry. I just hadn’t expected that you’d come.”
he countered,
Hermione gave him a warm smile, although Harry noted that it didn’t quite meet her eyes.
“Rest your legs on my shoulders. It’ll make it easier,” Draco instructed, and Harry complied. “I’m going to start with a finger.”
said so.”
Twenty minutes later, Harry and Draco shrunk the two boxes to pocket-size and bid their goodbyes, promising to come back to the farm soon. As they made their way down the driveway, Harry felt a twist of dread in his stomach. He wasn’t ready for today’s adventure to be over.
― Narcissa would look. Being able to physically see the years that we spent apart is more difficult than I’d imagined, and knowing that she’s lost so much time with Teddy is heartbreaking.”
“No, no,” Harry said. “Stay. I was just thinking of spending the afternoon wandering around the shops, and I’d love your company.”
“I’m not drunk, or high, or under the influence of any kind, if that’s what you’re thinking,” Draco said, lightly trailing his fingers up and down Potter’s chest in a way that made Potter squirm. “All I’ve got is a bit of luck.”
Harry reached across the table, pointing to the dessert section. As he was pulling his hand away, his fingers brushed with Draco’s, and a wave of warmth rushed over him. He reluctantly moved his fingers away, stuffing them in his lap in an attempt to drown out the urge to hold Draco’s hand.
“That doesn’t make very much sense.”
Realizing he didn’t recognize the owl, he stepped down the ladder and headed towards the front door, curiosity getting the best of him. After opening the door and beckoning the owl inside, her sleek feathers slick with rainwater, he swiftly untied the rolled piece of parchment tied to her ankle by a neat white ribbon and straightened it out in his hands.
“Yep. Follow me,” Draco said, steering his broom so that he was facing west. “It’s an hour ride to Wiltshire.”
“Sure,” Harry said, picking up one of the presents he’d so carefully wrapped and handing it to Draco. “Here you are.”
“Draco doesn’t know about your surprise, does he?” Hermione asked.
Draco nodded stiffly. “Yeah, I am.”
Harry handed Draco a much slimmer package, wrapped in only tissue paper and a bow. He could feel anxiety working through his body as he watched Draco open it, his mind churning with doubt. At last, Draco unwrapped it, revealing the navy, cream, and lavender beanie that Harry had knit him. A medium white pom pom was attached to the crown, which bobbed around as Draco picked up the hat, running his fingers over the different stitches.
The frosty day had gone by in a blur, having helped at least fifty customers. However, no matter how engrossed he had been in any given conversation, he couldn’t help but notice that his thoughts kept returning to Draco, wondering if he’d practiced any knitting since the workshop. Hell, he wondered if he would even see Draco again, worrying that he’d scared him off the previous day with his abrupt forgiveness.
Harry let out a light laugh. “Well, that’s because I’m closed on Fridays.”
Harry smirked. “Already planning on coming tomorrow?"
“Potter,” Draco said with a nod. “Where’s Aunt Andromeda? And Teddy?”
They stayed like that for a while, savouring each other as the sky faded from lilac to a powdery blue. By the time they broke apart, clusters of twinkling stars had appeared and the cool breeze had developed a nip to it. They took their time getting back into the car and turning on the engine. The headlights cut through the night as Harry navigated them back onto the road; all the while, one hand clasped Draco’s.
Their lips met, and the rest of the world fell away.
By the time lunch rolled around, Harry was in a far better mood, having found that helping customers did always manage to cheer him up. As he hung up the sign in the front window reading
As he went about procuring breakfast for both Stockinette and himself, he heard the Floo roar to life. Glancing at the clock, he felt his stomach twist.
Once content with his letter, Harry pulled on his winter coat and headed out of the shop. Although the cobblestoned street was dry, the dark clouds above were heavy with rain, threatening to unleash a violent downpour at any moment. Harry picked up his pace, hoping to not get caught in the inevitable storm.
“I imagine so,” Harry said, glancing briefly at Draco. “We can sort where we eat later.”
The evening sky was painted a liquid gold, and there wasn’t a single cloud in sight. Thanks to the heatwave that had been rolling over most of Europe, the August air smelled like sunbaked grasses and wild snapdragons that grew off the side of the road. Although the day had been warm, a cool breeze had picked up. Draco inhaled deeply, savoring the moment.
Draco grinned, offering him a small wave. “Happy New Year’s, Potter.”
, he thought to himself.
“Huh. I didn’t know there was another basic stitch,” Draco said, pursing his lips in thought.
Draco’s eyes flicked upwards, catching Harry’s. “Yes, I know the feeling. Who are you winding with?”
He turned towards Potter, taking a step forward. “You look good today, Potter.
“I know how it sounds. I
“Of course. Listen, this isn’t going to be easy for any of you, but I’m just glad you’re all trying. That’s what matters,” Harry said.
Draco walked into the ice cream parlour and was immediately hit with the smell of sweet cream and rich chocolate. He stood at the back of the long queue, surveying the flavours in the case: chocolate hazelnut, vanilla bean, marshmallow and Chocolate Frogs, peppermint, and lemon sorbet. After a moment of contemplation, he landed on the lemon sorbet.
The rest of their walk was quiet, and Harry led them to Bewley’s, a cafe and company known for their teas. Inside was warm, and Harry could feel his fingers beginning to thaw out as they wandered up to the host.
“Oi, I thought you didn’t mind Malfoy!” Harry said.
Standing next to him, Harry realized that Draco had grown taller since last seeing him, towering at least three inches above Harry. He shifted his weight uncomfortably.
Harry glanced up and saw that Draco was staring at him.
Silently, Draco peered into the cubby hole, his hands skimming through the different colors. After a moment, he picked up a dusty pink skein, a lavender skein, and the same light grey that Harry was holding.
Harry let out a huff of air. “You’re on my bench.”
“Did I work you too hard, Harry?” Draco teased, doing the same with his broom before plopping down on the couch.
Ron slumped in his seat. “ … Yeah, I guess.”
“Well?” Harry asked.
,” Harry murmured. “I like Malfoy.”
“Well,” Draco began, “alright. That sounds fine. It’ll give me time to give you your presents, too.”
“Sure.”
Harry clenched his jaw as he took a seat on the far left side of the bench. “Fine.”
you’re a bloody Gryffindor. Can I kiss you?”
“Oi!”
Just as he had moved from the first wall of cubby holes to the second, Harry heard the bell above the door go off. Confused as to who would be coming by mere moments before closing, he looked up and was met with a sight he hadn’t expected.
“Narcissa would sneak off to visit me after I married Ted, bringing Draco along when he was born,” Andromeda said, leaning into the back of the couch. “She was the only one who missed me, I suppose. And each visit, for a few hours, the both of us were able to forget everything: my disownment, the war, her involvement with Voldemort. It was as though everything just fell away.”
The tips of Malfoy’s ears grew a steady pink, and he shot Harry a soft smile. “You’re not too bad yourself, Potter. Dinner sounds lovely.”
“Merlin, yes,” Draco murmured before looking back up at Potter. “Can I touch it?”
that Narcissa doesn’t want to see you. Let yourself imagine having a relationship with her again ― and Draco too, for that matter. You could get to know them how they are now, not as who they were nineteen years ago. I haven’t seen Narcissa since the trials, so I can’t speak for her as of now, but I do know that she saved me when it mattered most, and that’s something that I can’t ignore. And as for Draco, he’s not the same bully I went to school with. He’s softer now, although he’s still an a ―” Harry paused, remembering that Teddy was in the room, “a
“Because I’m winding with you too.”
Harry snorted. “I don’t blame her.”
There was a moment of hesitancy on Harry’s part, an instant of trepidation before he leaned in, capturing Draco’s mouth. His lips were dry and rough, but his touches were soft, fingertips grazing across bare skin. It was different; gentler, somehow, as they pulled each other’s shirts over their heads and cast them to the stone floor.
Harry couldn’t discern who started it, but suddenly Draco’s lips were on his and it was if everything had fallen into place. The kiss was warm, and Draco tasted like the salted caramel hot chocolate he’d ordered at Anise Café. And his arms ―
He turned the glass over in his hands, cool and smooth compared to his roughness of his fingertips. Ridges had been blown in the glass to replicate the geometric design that donned the body of each Snitch, and the iridescent whiteness of the wings glowed in the honey colored light coming from the lanterns.
“I know you’re about to close,” Draco began, shifting his weight, “but I have a couple questions about knitting that I hoped you could answer.”
Harry nodded. “More than okay. Come here.”
Draco stopped after a few minutes, pressing wet, open-mouthed kisses to Potter’s collarbones. “Need you inside me.
“Which is?”
“Oh?” Andromeda said, setting down her glass of water and holding her arms open for Teddy as he wandered towards her.
Malfoy glanced over at the alarm clock that sat on his nightstand. “Ten till.”
As Harry took in Draco’s words, his heart began to sink. Ever since they’d planned to meet up last night, it was all he’d been thinking about. There was something so ridiculously charming about watching Draco desperately try to grasp different concepts and techniques, and knowing that he’d have to wait another day and a half sent a sharp pang of disappointment through his chest.
For a moment, he could pretend that this was his life — a cottage that sat on a grassy cliff overlooking the Aegean Sea, the smell of salt and citrus, the sound of Harry puttering around in the kitchen down the hall. He closed his eyes, nails cutting into his palms to remind himself that this was nothing but a foolish pipedream.
warn you. Now, would you rather work on the toy train that needs to go in the front window or the tree that’s to go near the back? I don’t mind.”
“You do the honors.”
“You two absolutely spoil her,” Harry said, grinning as he slung the satchel over his shoulder and pushed up his round glasses.
“ —so I suppose those things qualify me as a happy individual.” He chose not to mention his heartache. “What about you?”
“Please, Teddy,” she said, her voice weary. “We’ll be late.”
between you two, so I’d like you to look at this as an opportunity to leave your past relationship behind you.”
Before Harry could respond, he was being pushed against the wall as their lips met in a harsh collision. Whatever moment of trepidation Malfoy had felt before was certainly gone, because now there were only rough touches, and roaming hands, and wandering tongues. Malfoy’s mouth was warm and welcoming, and the way his fingers dipped underneath Harry’s jumper and grazed against his skin felt like a trail of fire blazing across his torso. He shifted his hips forward, desperate for some friction against his now fully hard cock, which was straining painfully in his jeans. Malfoy seemed to notice because he quickly slotted his leg between Harry’s thighs, rutting it against Harry’s length.
“So, what’s the company’s name?” he asked.
Draco stiffly stood up as Ron approached him, sticking out his hand. Ron took it rather briefly.
Instinctively, Harry took both of Draco’s cold hands in his own and immediately began sinking into the sensation of skin on skin. “Draco … you’ve somehow become one of the most important people in my life over the past fifteen days, and, quite frankly, I feel like Christmas wouldn’t
After scrawling a messy confirmation back, Harry sent Artemis on her way and settled back down onto the couch, where Stockinette wasted no time in slinking into his lap, staring up at him with her bright blue eyes.
They stood in silence for what seemed like forever, waiting impatiently for this to be over so they could go their separate ways. Harry leaned against a tree as he watched Malfoy pace back and forth while absently fiddling with his wand — a nervous habit that he had grown used to observing while at Hogwarts.
“Small talk.”
Draco sodding Malfoy. He looked better than he had the last time Harry had seen him, which had been at his trial seven years ago. Malfoy had looked worn then, his skin sallow and taut and a dull look in his pewter colored eyes. Now, though, there was a light about him, as though someone had flipped a switch. His soft, ashy blond hair was cropped just above his ears, shorter than it had been, and the frown lines that had riddled his face were now faded.
Draco paused. “What, here?”
Harry offered him a warm smile as he wandered over. “I’d love to, but I’m meeting Ron and Hermione for dinner in thirty minutes. How about you come with me, and then you, Hermione, and I can do some knitting together and answer any questions you have?”
Looking at Draco, Harry swore he saw a hint of jealousy. It made sense, he supposed. The way Draco described his Christmases sounded very lonely, especially compared to the chaos that ensued every time the entire Weasley clan got together. Harry racked his brain for ways to remedy the sad look in Draco’s eyes, eventually landing on the fact that he would need to consult Ron and Hermione about it.
The day was warm and sticky as mid-morning light fell over the wide meadow. Harry dabbed at the large beads of sweat that were rolling down the back of his neck, and Hermione took a long swig of water from her flask. They, along with the rest of the Ministry office heads, had been roped into a mandatory weekend retreat that was supposed to focus on unity, team building, and interpersonal relationships. However obvious it was that
“Listen, I know it’s mad, but hear me out. He’s changed since the war. He’s not the arsehole he was as a kid, and he’s really trying. I’m not asking you to immediately like him. I’m just asking that you give him a chance.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “
“Yep,” Ron said, crossing his legs. “I’ve been a full-time Auror for a few years now.”
Harry let out a shaky exhale. “What are you thinking?”
Harry smiled. “Nice to meet you, Mark.”
. Then, he got to knitting.
“Can I kiss you?”
Malfoy shrugged. “Why not?”
“Sure,” Harry said, leaning back in his chair.
“How’d you like to come with me on an errand tomorrow?” Harry asked, having barely processed the words before they were out in the open.
been sleeping on the job, Harry and Hermione made their way past the rest of the tents and to the fire pit, where everyone else was milling about. Harry spotted Malfoy across the circle, and his stomach gave a funny flip.
Harry glanced down at his wrist watch, which read 3:57, and winced. Draco would be arriving any minute, and the sheer knowledge of that sent a wave of anxiety through him. Not sure if Draco was going to be wearing something casual for flying or actual Quidditch gear didn’t help Harry’s fears either, especially as he’d gone on to dress only in a yellow hoodie, grey joggers, and ratty trainers that had seen better days.
Harry let out a weary sigh. “You two must have figured this out before tonight, since neither of you seem surprised.”
Harry’s cheeks flushed as he sat down. “Am not.”
“You … have a phoenix tattoo.”
Unfortunately, he found it oddly endearing.
“My mother is looking into getting a pet,” Draco explained. “She thinks it might help keep her occupied.”
“Makes sense.”
Draco’s hand slowly made its way down to Potter’s cock, barely able to wrap around its length. It felt thick and heavy in his hands, and as he gave an experimental pump upwards, Potter gripped the hair at the nape of his neck and let out a breathy sigh.
Draco huffed a dry laugh. “Yeah, I was alright. I don’t know, I’ve never considered Potions.”
As the waitress left, Harry took out his knitting and began to work more on his cowl.
Harry’s stomach sank, and he instinctively looked towards Malfoy, whose mouth had curled into a severe frown. All at once, they both began to fervently protest.
“What now?”
Their movements weren’t rushed, instead coming together with a softness that Harry hadn’t expected. As their lips met, Harry could feel the rest of the world fall away. The only thing that mattered was right in front of him.
Hermione nodded in agreement. “Yes, sounds good. Should we meet back here in an hour?”
Draco let out a light laugh, rolling his eyes. “Relax, Harry. I was just messing.”
Maybe Harry would tell Hermione after all.
Harry flipped him the bird. “Get stuffed, Malfoy.”
A while later, Draco briefly glanced back and shouted, “look down!”
“Yeah, sounds good,” Harry said, nodding. “By the way, how would you feel about me dropping by on Christmas Day to give you your presents?"
Draco blinked. “Pardon?”
“Liquid Luck, to be specific,” Draco said, wrapping his arms around Potter’s neck. “Pansy knows how desperately I want to fuck you, so she helped me out this morning. Poured it into my cappuccino. I drank it willingly.”
An abruptive knock on his front door startled Harry, causing him to jump. He recognized the knock immediately as Hermione’s, and he smiled to himself as he wandered back down the hallway. Every Saturday, Hermione and Ron came by the shop to help out with sales and spend time with Harry. As Hermione was now head of the Muggle Liaison Department and Ron was a full-time Auror, it was one of the few times during the week where all three of them were able to carve out time in their busy schedules. Saturdays had, not surprisingly, quickly become Harry’s favorite day of the week.
Draco nodded. “Yes, Potter. I’m sure.”
Draco made a face. “Yes, I … suppose that works.”
Harry swore he saw Draco smile back.
“Then why are you crying?”
“Can we talk about something else?” Draco asked, looking away.
“Alright, why don’t we go to a different stall, then?” Harry suggested.
In many ways, he wished he couldn’t pin-point the exact moment in which everything had changed, all light in his life dissolving into darkness. Perhaps it would have been easier knowing that things hadn’t become so completely different the moment he walked through the threshold of Number Twelve Grimmauld Place on the 3rd of May. The house had been stuffy and humid, and there was a thin layer of dust on every surface. Kreacher had begrudgingly welcomed Harry home, showing him up to Sirius’ old room. Harry had tried to settle into the house ― he really had ― but the feeling of ease never came.
“Listen, you were a suspicious little twat,” Harry said, wiping the tears from his eyes.
Draco complied, his hips snapping deeper and faster. Harry let out a whine as Draco’s cock hit a certain spot inside him, sending sharp tendrils of pleasure throughout his body.
Harry grinned sheepishly, ducking his head as a crimson flush spread across his cheeks. “Yeah, they are. We went out to dinner two nights ago, and then I took Draco to see his first Muggle film ―
“Harry, what the bloody hell are you doing?”
Andromeda let out a heavy sigh, briefly closing her eyes. “You know, I just can’t find it in myself to fault Draco. Being brought up in such a harsh way … well, you know the effects it left on both Sirius and myself. I don’t blame him for having been horrible, no matter how much I want to. I suppose I can’t help but wonder if that’s how I would have ended up ― so young and so angry ― had things been different.”
Harry nodded. “Yeah, I started thinking about it while we were still at Hogwarts. After the war, though … I decided that route wasn’t for me. I needed to find something that didn’t revolve around adrenaline and vigilance.”
“Oi!” Harry said, chuckling. “I’ll have you know that I’ve grown into a very patient adult.”
Harry stared at the oven’s digital clock, pondering how he was going to make it through an entire knitting lesson without making it completely and utterly obvious that he was head-over-heels for Draco. As he took turns stirring the risotto and glancing at the clock, he found that he was making himself dizzy with excitement and was forced to remind himself that this was, in fact, not a date ― nothing near it, really. Just a knitting lesson and some dinner. That was it.
Ron shrugged. “You’re not wrong.”
“So much. You don’t even know.”
A minute went by. Then two. Then three.
Harry grinned, sticking out his hand. “It’s a deal.”
“ … Do you want me to go first, Andy?” Harry asked.
Harry had been sleeping when Ron and Hermione had let themselves into the house. He had cracked his eyes open as Walburga’s portrait screamed profanities, warning him that his friends had arrived. After a second or two, her shrieking came to a halt, and Harry knew that Hermione had cast a Silencing Charm.
He let out a weary sigh, folding the note and stuffing it into his trouser pocket before surveying his own living quarters, which looked rather clean in comparison to their usual state. He’d spent the past week slowly packing for the much-needed Christmas holidays, which he would be spending blissed out at the Burrow, eating rich foods and power-napping multiple times a day. Yet, as he thought about leaving, a sullen, melancholy feeling draped over him. Although it was his first year as the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, he felt like he’d settled so readily into his role. The idea of leaving this—the castle, the students, the staff—behind for two weeks made his stomach knot more than it should have.
, exactly?” Harry asked.
They spent thirty more minutes browsing the shelves of Flourish and Blotts before Harry landed on four books for Hermione. Surprisingly, Draco picked up a book of his own,
He hadn’t seen Andromeda and Teddy in a little over a month, and a visit was very much overdue. Harry grabbed a sheet of parchment from the check-out counter and began to write, hoping that Andromeda would be available.
’ new collection, which is called Cróga ― Irish for brave. It’s fingering weight and should be amazing for mosaic work. The owners are a couple, Oisín and Laoise. Just a heads up that Oisín is agender and uses the pronouns they/them.”
As the blistering summer of 1999 vanished into crisp autumn, Harry’s health took a turn for the worse. His days were filled with fits of crying, vomiting, and convulsions as he lived through memories that he didn’t particularly care to remember. He no longer knew what day it was, never mind what month, and he would occasionally find himself in places of the house that he couldn’t recall walking to. His nights weren’t any better, as sleep rarely came to him, and he more often than not spent the quiet hours before dawn sitting numbly in front of the telly that he had purchased the year before.
As Harry watched a large number of people pass by with bulging shopping bags, he was reminded of the fact that he desperately needed to begin thinking about Christmas presents for everyone. Hermione was easy ― books reliably left her overjoyed. The Weasley clan was a bit more difficult, although Harry knew that Bill and Fleur had been looking into taking Victoire to the Muggle cinema for the first time, so perhaps surprising them with fully funded tickets would be a good gift. Molly was in need of a new sewing machine, and Arthur had struck a curiosity for Muggle cameras, so those were daily straightforward purchases. Charlie, George, and Percy were mysteries, so Harry knew he’d need to do some poking around to find out what they wanted. As for Ron, he knew that Hermione was knitting him a hat, so that was out of the question. However, as he mulled the idea of a hat over, he realized that a knitted beanie would look particularly lovely on Draco.
“Luck?” Potter asked absently, his eyes watching Draco’s hands. “What kind of luck?”
And with that, McWeenie rushed towards the center of camp without so much as a glance behind him. Harry turned to Malfoy, whose face was now a shade of bright red, and winced.
,” Harry sighed.
“Yeah, actually. How would you feel about coming over on the 20th to help us put together some arrangements?” Draco asked.
Harry nodded as he forced a chuckle. “Yeah, I think I should limit the Snowfall Spell to the window display. So, any plans for the rest of the evening?”
Harry shrugged. “Sure.”
“Harry! It’s you!” Teddy said enthusiastically, showing off the doll.
Harry led them out of the bedroom and down the hall. There, they found Andromeda sitting in a stupor on the couch, a glass of undrunk water in her trembling hands. Her tears had dried, although there was still red rimmed around her dark eyes.
Harry led him through the maze of customers and towards the right side of the store, stopping in front of a long, sweeping shawl that was turning slowly in the air. Harry had a particular fondness for this shawl, the yellow, turquoise, and light blue rectangular pattern making it pop.
Then, he was in a place that felt all too familiar.
hard work, after all.
When Draco looked to Harry for backup, he simply shrugged. “She’s got a point.”
As Harry stood, coaxing a pouting Teddy into the kitchen and towards the silverware drawer, he found himself staring at the dining room table, longing for two more seats to be filled.
Harry swallowed thickly. “Why?”
“I’d like a Butterbeer, please,” Draco said softly, averting his eyes.
Harry squeezed Draco’s arm. “Well, I’m glad we did. I don’t know what I would do without you. I mean, who else would be willing to go to London Zoo with me every other weekend?”
It wasn’t until after dinner that Harry began to feel a little more at ease. Teddy volunteered himself to help Narcissa put together the platter of Cauldron Cakes, and Andromeda cautiously tagged along. Harry figured it would be a good excuse for the three of them to spend a few moments alone, so he requested that Draco bring him around the Manor’s garden.
So, for any of you who don't know, Stockinette's name comes from one of the most basic stitches in knitting - the stockinette stitch! Also, thank you all so much for the comments, kudos, and subscriptions I've received so far. It means the world to me ❤
Clearing his throat, Harry began, “so, Malfoy … I see you have some dropped stitches. Do you want any help ―”
“Hey,” Draco said, giving Stockinette one last pet before standing up. “Sorry I’m so early. One of my mother’s most important clients unexpectedly popped over, so she kicked me out.”
“Yeah?” Harry asked, joining him.
Stockinette promptly stretched further, taking up a seemingly impossible amount of room for such a petite cat.
TW - VERY brief mention of homophobia. Like one line!
Their ice skating date was a disaster ― a true, magnificent disaster that resulted in what would likely be many bruises and a slightly deflated ego for Draco, who fell more times than Harry could count. Harry, however, wasn’t much better, and while he happily would’ve accepted help from a penguin skating aid, Draco outright refused to sink to that level, claiming that he “certainly did not need something meant for children.”
He wandered for a while, eventually hitting a clearing that edged up against a stream. He took a seat in the long grass, leaning against the trunk of an old tree, and watched the water run swiftly over stones. Yellow wildflowers that dotted the clearing swayed gently in the wind as the evening’s last hour of light fell over the forest, blanketing the world in a soft twilight.
“Cissy,” Andromeda murmured, her eyes once again filling with pools of tears as she stared at her sister.
Ron tipped his head back, letting out an audible groan.
“Oh. Alright. I’ve been eager to meet Teddy,” Draco said, a blush spreading across his face as he admitted this.
Harry’s stomach growled, acknowledging that it was well aware of the treat he was about to consume. The shop, called Gino's Gelato, was located at the seafront, its doors only a few steps away from the rocky shore. He inhaled deeply as he made his way to the end of the queue, savoring the smells of rich chocolate and sweet cream.
“Sounds good. I’m going to go with the yellow curry,” Harry said, knowing the menu by heart. “Do you want to split a plate of fresh spring rolls?”
Harry swallowed thickly. “Right. Okay. Follow me.”
A moment later, he stepped out into Andromeda’s spacious living room. Fairy coloring books littered the carpet, as did a few plastic horses and other various animals. Careful to navigate his way around them, Harry made his way towards the hallway that led to the bedrooms.
He swallowed thickly.
Draco nodded. “I’d be open to meeting with her and Teddy, although I think Mother would take it best hearing it from you. Would you be up for writing her a letter explaining the situation?”
Draco nodded. “Yes. She’s been talking about this shop for ages, but she’s not able to visit due to her … house arrest sentence, so I thought I’d surprise her for Christmas.”
“Fine.”
Harry snorted. “I’d bet money on that.”
Oisín nodded, pointing to a particular sheep that was milling nearby. “Yep. See that one? Her name is Curry, and she’s one of our oldest Shetland sheep. We’ve still got around ten of them left.”
Draco pursed his lips in thought. “I might try the raspberry hot chocolate.”
Because although everyone was matched with a soulmate, it could take years to find each other. Pansy had been marked with a small broom on her wrist for nearly nine months now, yet she wasn’t any closer to figuring out who her soulmate was. Greg was more or less in the same boat. Opposite them, however, Blaise and Theo had somehow managed to match with each other, each bearing a diamond.
For the next thirty minutes, Harry went about drying himself off and getting dressed, picking out one of his favorite outfits: a deep purple jumper with a cream colored yoke in the pattern of snitches that Hermione had knit him several years ago, dark denim jeans, and a pair of black high top Chuck Taylors. After adding his round, wire rimmed glasses as a last touch, he managed to coax Stockinette into the kitchen with the promise of food.
Before Harry had time to react, Draco’s right hand wrapped around the base of his cock. Harry’s breath hitched, the pressure feeling both intoxicating and overwhelming as Draco leaned forward and slowly licked a stripe up the underside of his cock. Harry tilted his head back against the wall, and his eyes fluttered shut.
“This is absolutely mad, Hermione.
“Merry Christmas, love.”
Staring at Draco, whose pale skin was flushed in the dim amber glow coming from the living room lamp, Harry felt a wave of courage coursing through him, and he realized that if he didn’t say something right here, right now, then he never would.
Harry felt heat rushing to his cheeks.
“Sorry, ‘Mione,” they both mumbled in unison.
“Thanks, mate.”
“Well,” Harry said, shifting in his seat so that their thighs were pressing together, “I need to collect inventory from an indie yarn brand called
Draco made a face. “I was never particularly fond of sheep. I had an … incident with one when I was eight.”
Draco let out a heavy breath. “I’ve just ― well, have you ever had that feeling where you’re just not good at anything?”
?” Draco asked, crossing his arms.
Because I'm an absolute nitwit, I totally forgot to wish you all a happy Hanukkah last update!! I hope everyone who is celebrating has been having a wonderful (and safe) time filled with love and lots of good food.
“Sounds good,” Harry said, his chest heaving with lust and nervousness.
“Alright, how about you come over to my flat for dinner that night? Say, seven o’clock?”
“Yeah, you weren’t nearly as horrible as I was expecting,” Ron chimed in.
Harry smiled, picking up a light pink soap and smelling it. “This one is Sugar Quill scented.”
Hermione sighed. “It’ll take two seconds, Harry. I’ll give you a quick
Draco leaned forward so that his lips were even with Potter’s ear. “Come for me, Harry.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, averting his eyes. “I didn’t mean to insinuate ―”
Ron let out a heavy sigh as he collapsed onto the couch. “Dunno. Pizza kind of sounds good ― that Muggle place near here, what’s it called?”
“I―” Harry began, his tongue suddenly feeling dry and far too large, “I didn’t know you worked here. Why … why
Draco leaned in, kissing him deeply. Harry could taste himself on Draco’s tongue, bitter and musky. For a moment, he forgot that Draco hadn’t been taken care of; that is, until he felt Draco’s erection pressing fiercely into his hip.
“Very interesting,” Andromeda said softly, leaning into the back of the couch. “Merlin, I haven’t seen Draco in years ― not since he was four or five, I suppose. What’s he like?”
Harry snorted as he dropped his things off on the kitchen counter and walked into the living room. “Yeah. I’ve got to say, it’s bloody convenient. Now, feel free to take a seat on the couch. They won’t be able to see you from there.”
“Okay,” Harry said, clearing his throat awkwardly as he wandered to where Draco was standing. “Ready?”
Draco began to toy with the hem of Harry’s jumper, lifting it up just enough to run his fingers over Harry’s hips and abdomen. Harry leaned into the touch as he broke their lips apart, instead leaving hot, open-mouthed kisses on Draco’s neck. Draco, in turn, began to card his fingers through Harry’s curls, desperately tugging their bodies together.
Teddy nodded eagerly in response as his hands began to make a grabby motion in the direction of the dinner rolls.
Draco arched an eyebrow as he stripped off his coat and hung it on the coat rack next to the door. “Alright, Potter?”
“Merlin. Well, if you need an extra set of hands, I’d be happy to help,” Harry said, smiling.
Draco took another step forward, placing a hand on Potter’s chest as he looked up into his deep green eyes. “You know what I’ve always been curious about? Whether the rumors about your cock are true or not. People say your cock is big enough to leave a poor sod ripped open and begging for more. I can’t tell you, Potter, how many nights I’ve imagined you buried inside me, fucking me so hard until I can’t see straight—”
“Sounds fine by me,” Draco added.
“How does a Quidditch match sound? Just you and me, a week from tomorrow evening,” Harry said, smirking.
“Mind if I sit here?” Draco asked.
“Ready,” Draco said.
“I see,” Harry said, tickling Teddy’s bare torso as he thought about solutions. “It does seem a bit uncomfortable, doesn’t it? Why don’t I see what else you’ve got to wear?”
The warmth from Draco’s palm felt steady against Harry’s chest, reassuring him that this was real ― that Draco was here, in his flat, saying that he felt the same way.
“Like what you see?”
After a moment of contemplation, Harry relented. “Alright. Fine.”
“Have you ever thought about reconnecting with Narcissa?” Harry asked, a spark of inspiration igniting inside him. “You know, I could always talk to Malfoy about arranging a visit ―”
Harry swallowed thickly, the conversation suddenly turning somber. “You said that you hoped Hermione would be killed.”
will be put off by us trailing along?”
Draco’s face went blank as he took the measuring cup. “Well, I would, but I don’t know what the hell a microwank is or how to use it.”
Draco shrugged. “Because I’m the best in all of England. The
Draco looked particularly lovely, clad in an eggplant colored jumper and form-fitting black trousers. Harry watched as Draco greeted Hermione and Ron, his face lit with what Harry recognized as both nervousness and excitement. Stockinette had hopped down from her spot on Ron’s lap and was now parading around Draco’s ankles, occasionally butting her head up against his legs in request of pets.
As Harry lazily flicked through the television channels a few hours later, he found himself watching Draco fall asleep next to him, his soft breaths quickly turning into abhorrent snores. Harry had never pinned Draco as a snorer, although he supposed there were a lot of things he still had to learn about him.
this one bloke who keeps wandering into my store,” he said, biting his lip in anxiety.
“Good.”
They still had a while until they reached home, although Draco’s heart hurt more with every landmark they passed. Going home meant having to face the fact that they were nothing but roommates, and he didn’t know if that was enough anymore.
Harry, with his eyebrows raised, confusedly began to open the package, quickly pulling out the very last thing he’d expected. In his hands was a hat, which looked more like a …
Draco shook his head. “No, we’ll have plenty. December is always our busiest month, with the Winter Ball, business parties, get-togethers. We’re always worn out by the time New Year’s comes around.”
“Alright. See how I can’t get my needle through the stitch because it’s so tight? However, if I hold it like this,” Hermione said, adjusting her grip, “it works much easier. It’ll still be a little tense due to the fact that your other stitches are so tight, but it should get better. Can you see the difference?”
Harry let out an incredulous bark of laughter. “That’s rich, coming from you. Need I remind you of that one time ―”
“Are we going out to dinner after the fair?” Hermione asked.
Harry nodded. “She is. I’ll have to give her lots of love when we get back.”
Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes. “I was the one who dragged you along, so I’m buying.”
Malfoy smiled softly at him — a real, genuine smile that lit up Harry’s insides. “You think so?”
“Ronald, you sound like a child in a toyshop,” Hermione said, rolling her eyes. “So, Harry, how about we have some dinner?”
“Thanks for having me. Your farm is beautiful,” Draco said.
“What’re you working on?” Harry asked, glancing over at her.
“Cold?” Draco asked, rubbing his hands together.
He would undoubtedly be fired for most of them, but at least he would be home.
are you doing here?”
He looked up, staring Draco directly in the eye. “Do it, then.”
After unlocking the front door and turning the closed sign to open, he wandered back to where Ron and Hermione were perched on stools behind the check-out counter. Once he had taken to his own stool, he pulled his project bag out of his satchel, seeing that Hermione had done the same.
“I’ve ruled out the possibility, Harry,” Andromeda said, her voice breaking as tears threatened to spill over. “I doubt Cissy wants to see me, especially after everything that’s happened, and I don’t want to pressure her into healing wounds that she isn’t ready to. Plus, too much time has passed for us to ever reconcile, and I’ve accepted that. I’ve got Teddy now ― and you of course, love ― and that’s all that matters.”
Before Ron could protest, Hermione interjected with light laughter. “I suppose he’s got a point, Ron.”
Harry nodded all too eagerly, not paying one lick of attention to the gelato dripping onto his hand.
While Hermione and Ron sat on the couch and amused Stockinette, Harry wandered back to his bedroom. There, he quickly changed out of the hoodie that he’d worn to the shop and pulled on a pine colored jumper that was donned with white and pastel blue stripes. As he quickly attempted to flatten his hair, which was curling in peculiar angles, he heard the Floo roar to life and Draco’s unmistakable voice.
Draco set down his knitting, which looked more disastrous than it had the last time Harry had seen it. “You too. Harry, I’m really sorry for not writing sooner. I didn’t mean to scare you; I just couldn’t find the time ―”
“They’re called Viridi Gigas,” Draco said, squinting up at the huge stalks, “and they’re one of my mother’s most prized possessions.”
It felt right.
Draco nodded. “Yes. Merlin, I spent so much time here as a child. It was the one place where I could lose myself. Did you have somewhere like that?”
“Bye.”
Draco promptly dragged him across the road to a back alleyway and, once ensuring that they were out of sight, Disapparated them back to Harry’s flat. As soon as their feet were back on the ground, Draco was shoving Harry against the living room wall, their lips urgently meeting as Harry’s arms resumed their position around Draco’s neck. Harry could feel that he was steadily growing hard, his erection pressing tightly against the zipper of his jeans.
Harry scooted forward, cupping Malfoy’s face in both hands. Malfoy’s eyes went wide, but he didn’t struggle. Instead, he let out a soft breath, his eyes flickering down to Harry’s lips as he rested a hand on Harry’s chest.
Ron walked forward, standing even with Draco, and clapped him on the back. “Listen, Malfoy, that was really good of you, and we appreciate it.”
The room fell silent as Teddy paused, pursing his lips in deep thought. After a moment, he crossed his arms and let out a huff of air.
As soon as Draco left an hour later, Harry pulled out a piece of parchment and a black gel pen, not bothered to go to the trouble of using a quill, and began scribbling a note to Narcissa.
Harry told himself.
Malfoy’s hips jerked forward slightly before he pulled back, righting himself. “Fuck, sorry. Just—you feel so fucking good around me, Potter. So hot and tight.”
“With hopes that you’d be stuck with it,” Harry said, smirking.
It had been a long while since Harry had kissed anyone, instead spending his years recovering and working on himself. However, for the past year, he’d found himself hopelessly chasing the idea of being swept up in a whirlwind romance, dreaming endlessly of the idea of love. And now that it was Christmastime, the world seemed to possess just a fraction more magic than usual, making it all seem so irresistible.
“Alright. All set?” Harry asked.
He’d also recovered enough from his own orgasm that he was beginning to grow hard again, which Draco took quick notice to.
“Really?” he asked, rolling his eyes.
He’d gone into eighth year wanting nothing more than to concentrate on everything that he’d missed the year prior ― Quidditch, Hogsmeade, visiting Hagrid, running amuck across the Hogwarts grounds and not giving a single fuck.
Harry snorted. “Of course you are.”
“One, two, three!”
Cautiously, he scooted closer to Draco. “I’d be more than happy to stay a while.”
Harry cleared his throat, unsure if he should elaborate further or not. After a moment of decidedly awkward silence, he opted for moving on.
Harry took a look at the board, his eyes immediately zeroing in on the hot chocolate section. There were several flavors available, and while he could attest that the orange, raspberry, and caramel hot chocolates were excellent, he was rather curious about the peppermint flavor.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Don’t worry. I won’t leave you behind while I go to Ron and Hermione’s flat tomorrow.”
“Morning, Stocky,” Harry said softly, scratching her quickly behind the ear before turning back to his bare parchment.
After teaching the students how to cast on and make a stitch, as well as explaining why they would need to flip the scarf over once they reached the end of a row, Harry let them reign free, working on his own scarf that he was making along with them.
Draco’s cock throbbed at Potter’s words of encouragement, and he pressed both of their lengths together, struggling to hold them at once. However, the heat coming from the friction was worth the challenge, shooting bursts of pleasure throughout Draco’s body and provoking long strings of incoherent swears from Potter.
After having told the Weasley clan that he and Draco were together over dinner the previous evening, he’d quickly owled Andromeda to tell her the same thing. Then, with the help of Hermione, Harry had managed to persuade them into a visit. Molly had been the most unsure, having asked Harry a multitude of questions before finally letting the topic rest. She did, however, pull him aside before he’d gone to bed, informing him that she was happy as long as he was.
“Oh,” Harry said, blinking. “Uh, right. As a present?”
Running a knitting shop
Draco pursed his lips in thought. “I’d like to see the shawl first.”
Draco tilted his chin so that he was looking directly at Harry. “Yeah? You think so?”
“Well, you don’t look particularly pleased by it,” Harry said, slightly annoyed. “I can just go if you’d prefer—”
“Harry, love,” Draco panted, “touch yourself for me.”
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry murmured, moving to kiss along Draco’s jawline.
Next to him, Harry had one hand loosely gripping the steering wheel of his Vauxhall Nova while the other tapped along to the rhythm of a Muggle song on the window ledge. His black waves, which always looked slightly unruly, were even more tousled from the car’s open windows. Golden shadows danced across his brown skin as the sun continued to sink.
“Settle down, you two,” Hermione said, rolling her eyes as she knelt down and stroked Stockinette. “So, where are we headed to for dinner?”
“I thought we were supposed to hate each other,” he murmured.
Harry nodded, smiling softly at him. “I’ve been in love with you for years, Draco. It just took you walking into my shop for me to realize it.”
“Butterbeer,” Draco said, setting the bar of soap back down. “It smells just like the real thing.”
Harry looked up, startled, only to find Draco grinning very cheekily at him. However, he quickly recovered by snorting.
“Please, for the love of Merlin and all that is magic, lock your Floo before you two are about to …
Harry looked to Ron for help, but all he did was shrug.
“Listen, Stocky, I love you,” Harry said through a mouthful of curry. “I really do. But, there’s no way in hell you’re getting my dinner.”
They quickly switched positions, Draco taking the wooden spoon while Harry popped the measuring cup into the microwave, and then they went to work.
It took them a good two hours to finish, even with magic, and by the time they were done, Harry felt absolutely knackered. As they stood together in the center of the shop, their eyes taking in the glow of decorations, Harry couldn’t help but concentrate on the heat coming from Draco’s body, which was alarmingly close. Only six centimeters, and their hands would be touching.
Just as Harry was about to tell Teddy that he was doing a good job of waiting, Draco slid into the chair next to him. He looked up, startled, only to find that Draco was smiling softly at him as he folded a fabric napkin on his lap.
Harry absently sat down, running a hand nervously through his hair. “Well, I was only interested in him because I knew there was something going on ― and I was right, wasn’t I?”
And here it is - the final chapter of The Way We Wind. If I think about it too hard I'll burst into tears, and I can't have that given the sheer amount of prep for my English final I have to do today.
Mrs. Van Ness smiled. “Yes, and I’m looking for the yarn to be light green in color. My granddaughter just announced that she’s pregnant, and Merlin knows that I won’t get the blanket done unless I start now.”
“Morning,” the host said before glancing down at his watch. “Or, rather, good afternoon, since it’s almost noon. How many?”
Draco frowned. “Alright.”
“Thanks,” Draco said wearily. “I imagine Mother will have you work on the tree while we do the more intricate work, like individual bouquets and wreaths. How does that sound?”
“First of all,
“I never would’ve pinned you for someone who isn’t straight,” Draco said.
Harry rolled his eyes. “So, how did your mum’s big order go?”
As he took in the view, he felt the car begin to slow. He looked towards Harry, who was navigating the car off the road and onto a dirt area that sat at the edge of one of the fields. He put the car into neutral and shoved the handbrake on before glancing up at Draco with a glint in his eyes.
Teddy frowned. “Who hurt your feelings? I’ll tell them to say sorry.”
“So, besides being criminally bad at skating, what did you think?” Draco asked.
Walking into the shop, he was immediately hit with the sweet, aromatic smell of roses. The right wall was made up of a refrigerator, which was filled to the brim with a variety of flowers. Harry recognized a few, such as baby’s breath, gardenias, and lilies. The rest of the shop was filled with premade floral arrangements and bouquet accessories, all looking rather attractive in the silver light that fell through the broad front window.
Draco shook his head.
“Well, I can’t say Brian’s is any stranger than The Leaky Cauldron,” Hermione said.
Before he knew it, he was stumbling onto the wet ground. Draco landed on top of him, knocking all air out of his lungs.
Eventually, the shorts came off, as did Harry’s boxers and Draco’s briefs. Harry adjusted so that he was on his back, knees up and apart as Draco settled in between them. Patches of golden sun fell across Harry’s brown skin. The room was warm, and Draco could feel sweat collecting at the nape of his neck as he cast a lubrication spell. He gently worked one finger past Harry’s tight ring of muscles, then two, and then three, until Harry was pushing back on his fingers, strings of noncoherent pleas escaping his lips. He looked beautiful like this — messy, and vulnerable, and entirely his, even if it was just for an afternoon.
“That,” Ron butted in, “and he was a prick.”
“You’re too kind,” Laoise said, gesturing for them to take a seat at the table. “I was just about to put the kettle on. Do either of you want tea or coffee?”
As Harry stared at him, he realized with quite a horrible shock that Malfoy was …
Draco rolled his eyes. “I love how you’re
At that, Draco’s face fell, and he rolled his eyes. “Fine. I’m looking for yarn … for my mother.”
As soon as Draco lowered his mouth onto the head of Harry’s penis, Harry knew he wasn’t going to last long. Draco slowly began to bob his head up and down the length of Harry’s prick, his hand moving in unison. Harry could feel the fire that had started to spread in his abdomen rapidly building, and the muscles in his thighs were tightening. It was as though there were a thousand currents running through him, sparks pooling in the tips of his fingers and his toes.
“Don’t mention it.”
Draco’s words echoed in Harry’s ears, repeating over and over again until they nearly lost meaning. Sitting so close to Draco, Harry could make out things that he’d never quite noticed before: his eyelashes the color of white gold, a dark spot on the bottom left of his blush colored lips, and the barely visible trail of sand colored freckles dotting the bridge of his sharp nose.
good.
“Right. Well,” Draco said, unravelling his own knitted scarf and tucking it around Harry’s neck, “this ought to help.”
“What’s what like?” Harry asked, pausing after finishing his stitch.
Andromeda snorted as she stood up, gathering her things. “I have a strong suspicion that Aunt Narcissa will have put out a sweet or two.”
A few minutes later, Teddy with his bright turquoise hair emerged from the hallway, followed by Andromeda. Despite it having been several years since Harry had gotten to know Andromeda, he always managed to be surprised at how much she looked like Bellatrix Lestrange. They both had the same wild corkscrew curls, although Andromeda’s were a dark brown instead of jet black, and their eyes were the same shade of cool brown.
She smiled softly at him, moving her hand to rest on Harry’s shoulder. “Ron’s heating up dinner. Molly made chicken soup tonight. Figured it’d be easy on your body.”
Harry shrugged. “Why not?”
Without hesitating, Harry walked down the hall and knocked on the door before opening it. There, he found Teddy jumping on his bed and out of Andromeda’s reach, his hair color changing with each bounce.
Harry watched as Draco’s slender fingers deftly unwrapped the package, revealing a medium sized box. Draco looked up, arching an eyebrow out of curiosity, before continuing to unwrap, working his way through the Spellotape. Then, as soon as Draco folded back the box flaps, Draco let out a bark of laughter, pulling out the cauldron with a dragon painted on its side that they’d spotted at the craft fair.
Harry blinked, his eyes adjusting to the pale, early morning light streaming in through the crack in the white cotton curtains. He rolled to the other side of the bed, stretching to grab his wand from the nightstand and lazily casting
“Draco? Is someone here?”
“I don’t want that shirt!” Teddy pouted.
Harry watched as his words registered across Draco’s face, which grew to be bright red in color.
he silently told himself.
Morning/afternoon/evening, everyone! I am THRILLED because I just remembered that the next chapter is one of my favorites!
with Ginny.”
“Potter!”
“Sounds good. Do you have the Snitch?” Harry asked.
As the queue moved, he began to survey his flavor options in the case. His eyes first landed on the Kinder Bueno flavor, hazelnut cream and pieces of wafers rippling through the vanilla base.
you.”
“Of course. I just need to lock up the shop and then we can head upstairs to my flat. Sound good?” Harry asked.
Harry let out a light laugh. “No, you haven’t ruined anything.”
The note wasn’t exactly enough to answer Harry’s questions, leaving him with the predicament of deciding whether he should go see what the bloody fuck was so important that it needed to be given right before he left, or if he should simply ignore it until he, as well as the rest of the Hogwarts faculty and students, returned after New Year’s.
He heard light footsteps approaching and then, “Well, Potter, I didn’t know you could cook.”
They pulled back a few minutes later, and Harry shifted so that his head was resting on Malfoy’s shoulder. The sky was now a dusty blue with a burst of orange lining the horizon as the last sliver of sunlight slowly faded away.
“Do keep up, Harry,” Draco said, rolling his eyes. “I’m just making small talk.”
They continued to chat and knit for another hour and a half, Draco occasionally taking a break to scratch Stockinette, who had hopped onto the couch and settled in at his side. All the while, Harry couldn’t help but churn the idea of domesticity over in his mind. Despite Draco having only come over to Harry’s flat a few times, it already felt like a comfortable routine that he didn’t want to end.
Harry sighed, setting down his knitting on the table. “I ... don’t know. I’ve never given it much thought, I guess. It’s like there’s this bind between my fingers, the yarn, and my needles. Knitting is something I don’t need to think about. It just is.”
“And I take it that Stockinette is in pure heaven?” Hermione asked, grinning. “I swear, no cat should love a human as much as she loves Draco.”
During their last session before the much anticipated Christmas holidays, Harry wasn’t processing a single word that Draco was saying. Instead, he was spending his time staring at Draco’s soft lips, wondering how they would feel against his own.
Draco let out a low laugh. “Eager, are we?”
for the umpteenth time.”
“Oh Merlin, Potter. I’m so close,” Malfoy babbled, his voice raw as his movements became more erratic. “I’m so fucking close. Nearly there. Nearly there,
Roughly clearing his throat, he set the magazine down on the table before turning his attention to his appallingly expensive cappuccino and croissant. “I don’t drool.”
“Oh, for the love of Merlin,” Harry muttered, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Fine. You pay for yourself.”
Hermione turned back around, smiling softly at him. “Good job. Now, one second. I’m just going to
“Like I just kicked a kitten. Drink your hot chocolate and stop pouting,” Draco said, taking a long sip of his Butterbeer.
Before Harry could tease him further, the first customer of the day walked in.
Harry shrugged, smirking. “You’re over enough that she ought to learn your name.”
“Where to first?” Harry asked.
“Uh, yes. She finds it to be very therapeutic. That, and her arrangements are incredible. In fact, Kingsley often commissions her to put together arrangements for Ministry balls. If I remember correctly, there’s going to be one on the 22nd,” Draco said.
Once they’d paid, Amelia having taken Draco’s money with forced politeness, they went to the end of the counter and waited for their drinks to be made. Harry looked around, realizing that several people were staring at Draco, none of them hiding their discontent.
Harry turned to Teddy, who had plopped on the floor and was clutching a doll with deep brown skin and black ringlets.
“I’m sure people are going to love it,” Harry said.
The following morning found Harry staring sourly at his reflection in the bathroom mirror as he impatiently tried to clean his glasses. Clad in a cream cable jumper and faded blue jeans, he couldn’t help but wonder how his clothes would compare to Draco, whose outfit was bound to give him a heart attack from both jealousy and pure, unadulterated lust.
“Tea would be lovely,” Molly said, nodding. “Thank you.”
“Right. Well, I promise I’ll protect you from any mean sheep,” Harry said, grinning.
After a moment of thought, Draco swallowed and said, “It’s surprisingly good.”
As a child, Draco had regularly begged his mother to regale the tale of finding her soulmate. She’d smile at him, hoisting him up onto her knee as she’d recalled how, on the morning of her twenty-first, she’d woken with the mark of a dragon on her inner wrist. She’d immediately written to Draco’s father, whom she’d already been courting, and had broken the news that their marks matched. She’d described it as one of the happiest days of her life, alongside her wedding and the day that Draco had been born.
After a few moments, Draco paused, pulling back. “You sure you’re ready for this?”
“Everything is pretty good. The shop is incredibly popular at the moment, so business is booming. Actually, though, something interesting has happened lately. Draco has been coming around the shop, and I’ve begun teaching him how to knit,” Harry said.
However, with Hermione in Wales on a Muggle study scholarship and Ron in the entry level Auror program, he felt entirely lost.
“They’re right behind me. Andy’s a bit nervous, so she’s just taking her time,” Harry explained.
“Hi!” Teddy said, smiling brightly as he gave them an enthusiastic wave. “Do you have sweets?”
Surrounded in the darkness, Harry truly had no semblance of where he was. It was nice, to some degree, being able to imagine that he could be anywhere in the world. However, the more he thought about it, the more he realized that he could care less where he was, as long as he was with Draco.
ago, and he’s perfectly happy now. Isn’t that right, Harry?”
Once everyone had been waved off, Harry stared at Draco.
“Piss off,” Pansy muttered, setting her mug down with a little too much force and causing other nearby café patrons to look their way. “Look, Draco, you’ve been working on Potter’s house for five weeks now, and it’s
Stockinette blinked absently at him with her bright blue eyes.
After a moment, Malfoy spoke. “How do you feel about pot roast?”
Because why would Harry ever love him? Although Draco had redeemed himself to some extent over the five years that had passed since the Battle of Hogwarts, there was no denying that people still associated him with his past. The dirty looks and open stares from strangers were enough of an incentive to avoid going out in crowded areas unless absolutely necessary. Even if Harry
“You really think that?” he asked quietly.
Ron snorted, shifting towards Hermione. “Merlin, at the rate you, Mum, and Harry are working, my wardrobe is going to be entirely made up of knitwear by the end of the year.”
Harry thought ― felt strong and sturdy around his waist, reassuring him that Draco wasn’t going anywhere.
“Okay, good. What … what’s she like? And Teddy?”
idea!” Harry said, rolling his eyes as he stepped down from the ladder. “So, what can I help you with?”
“Yeah, of course, mate,” Ron added, reaching around Hermione’s shoulders to pat Harry on the back. “Anything for you.”
Draco whipped around, heart pounding as his eyes landed on Potter. He’d grown a little taller since the Battle of Hogwarts, and he’d filled out quite nicely. Light stubble dusted his sharp jaw, and his black curls were pulled back into a messy knot on top of his head. The jagged scar that ran from his right temple to his left cheekbone no longer looked red and irritated, but was instead a light beige against his brown skin.
“I’ll bet,” Harry said, laughing. “I hope you don’t have anymore orders like that anytime soon.”
“Yeah, absolutely. Although … there’s been a minor change in plans ―” Harry began, but he was abruptly cut off.
“Well, it would appear that Mother is on board,” Draco said. “And just so you know, the only time I mention you is when I’m complaining about what a git you are.”
Draco shrugged. “Sure.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Yes, Potter. Really. Although don’t let this go to your head. You’re still a wanker.”
With one final thrust, Potter came, releasing hot semen into Draco’s arsehole. Draco rocked his hips until Potter placed his hands on Draco’s chest, signaling for him to stop. Draco winced as he gingerly lifted himself off of Potter’s cock and collapsed next to him on the couch, their heavy breaths echoing against the walls. The air was thick with the smell of sex, and Draco lazily wiped away beads of sweat that had collected on his upper lip with the back of his hand. Next to him, Potter was panting, his chest rapidly rising and falling as he stared absently at the television in front of them. A comfortable silence fell between them.
Harry looked up, nodding. “It is.”
“Before we go, you should read this,” Draco said, reaching into his coat pocket and pulling out an envelope.
Malfoy shrugged as he stopped to pull Harry to his feet. “She never shuts up about you, you know. Always goes on about how we’re colleagues in her letters. I think she’d be pleased to know that I’ve somehow managed to woo you.”
Next chapter goes up: Friday, Dec. 4th
, did he love that smile. And there was something about the way he stumbled out of his room in the morning and into the kitchen, eyes barely open as he murmured a sleepy hello before making himself a cup of coffee, that caused Draco’s heart to skip a beat or two.
It wasn’t fireworks, as first kisses were so often described in Muggle media. Instead, kissing Draco was like a thousand beating wings rushing towards the sun, a vibrant warmth spreading through his chest as they held each other close. There was a certain comfort in Draco’s slightly chapped lips, as though Harry had known and been intimate with them for years now. He supposed he had, to a degree, having memorized the form of Draco’s lips from all the way across the Great Hall throughout his time at Hogwarts.
“Sounds good.”
With that, the call ended, and Harry looked back towards Draco, who was, if possible, even paler than usual.
“Be right there! Make yourselves at home!” Hermione shouted back.
“Hi,” Draco said, glancing around the shop. “My mother got your letter, and she insisted I bring this as a thank you along with her response. Wow, this is the emptiest I’ve ever seen the shop during the day.”
The burgundy wool was soft against Harry’s skin, and it smelled of Draco’s aftershave: cloves, pine, and citrus. He instantly felt a bit warmer, although he wasn’t sure whether that was from the scarf itself or the furious blush that was spreading across his face and down his neck.
Before Harry could stop himself, he took a step forward. “Malfoy?”
Which is why, on the day of his twenty-third birthday, he opted out of sinking into a hellhole of self-pity during his lunch break and promptly decided to treat himself to an ice cream. Once he’d taken off his ruby-coloured work robes and thrown his wallet into the back pocket of his trousers, he quickly headed out the door and into the bright June day. Puffs of white clouds drifted across the blue sky, and there was a cool breeze rolling over the alley as he wandered down the cobblestone path that led to Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlour. Magical folks were weaving in and out of shops, many of them school-aged and heading to Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes.
“You, Draco,” Harry murmured, his heart thudding against his chest. “I’m winding with you.”
“For about four years now, although only the people I’m closest to know. What about you? Have you had an accepting experience?”
Harry glanced at Draco, who was transfixed on Teddy, and felt a wave of warmth surge through his body.
Draco looked up, nodding. “Yes. It’s all just a little overwhelming, I suppose.”
They wandered to the counter, queuing up. Harry took out his wallet.
Harry, once again being the last to use the Floo, fell stumbling into his living room and directly into Draco’s back. Harry did his best to right himself as quickly as possible, but the damage was done. Draco turned around, eyebrows quirked.
, he figured.
Draco nodded. “Yes. I’m truly surprised that no one in the workshop said anything to me. I suppose it was because they were all so invested in their work.”
Draco leaned forward, their lips almost touching. He could feel Harry’s soft breaths against his skin. A wave of anxiety pulsated over him but he held firm, Harry’s words echoing in his ears.
“Oh. Well, I was planning on ordering a takeaway from Preeda’s Curry Court. You’d be welcome to join, if you want,” Harry said, his heart beating loudly against his chest.
Harry hesitated, wondering just how much information he should divulge.
“Arsehole.”
“Are you dating anyone?”
“Do the colors have names?” Draco asked, peering further into the box on the right and causing Harry to grin.
Draco looked to Harry. “Thanks … Potter.”
. I’d spent so long dividing the world into good and evil, and I was done with that. So, I turned them down.
The conversation was kept very mild, which Harry wasn’t surprised about in the least. The closest they got to talking about the war was when Harry mentioned that he still had a hard time with the press, and even this was quickly skirted around.
“Oh. Um, well, Molly likes zinnias. Dahlias too, I think. And nothing too fancy. She wouldn’t want that,” Harry said.
“Things are busy, but good. My customers seem to really be enjoying all of the decorations we put up. I get comments everyday on the toy train you set out,” Harry said, grinning at the memory before turning more solemn. “I’ve missed you being there, though.”
“No,” Harry said, shaking his head. “No way. Just because Malfoy is funny, kind, sarcastic, and
Harry paused, his mind working to connect the question to his surprise. Then, not a moment later, he remembered that there was an ice rink nearby called the Tower of London Ice Rink. He’d never been, although Dudley had plenty of times.
Draco’s hand latched onto the Portkey, and they were sucked into the air. Harry felt the far too familiar feeling of being hooked by his middle and pulled through time, his body warping in ways that he preferred not to think about.
The confused look on Draco’s face jolted Harry back to reality. They weren’t friends.
They exchanged polite, albeit awkward, conversation until it was Draco’s time to order. Once he was handed his lemon sorbet in a cone, he began to head towards the door.
“Thanks,” Harry said as he reached into his project bag and began to straighten out his needles. “So, is it strange seeing Andy?”
Beside him, Hermione let out an irritated sigh as she adjusted her cross-body bag. Brows furrowed and lips pursed, it was clear that she was having about just as good of a time as he was. Rose’s first birthday was on Monday, meaning that Ron was now in charge of getting everything ready for the party. While Harry knew that Hermione fully trusted his capabilities as both a stay-at-home dad and a party planner, this didn’t stop her new-mom radar from needing to check her flip phone every five minutes to ensure that no one had burned the house down. Thankfully, Ron was proving to be very compliant with her needs, even if he wasn’t entirely sure how to use a mobile phone. More often than not, he ended up sending pictures of his thumb instead of Rose.
As McWeenie began to rifle through his trouser pockets, Hermione turned to Harry and rolled her eyes. He nodded in agreement.
nice,” Teddy said enthusiastically.
Draco nodded. “And how are you liking it?”
Malfoy shifted forward slightly, and then Harry could feel the tip of Malfoy’s index finger breaching his hole, pushing past his tight ring of muscle. He settled into the slight but familiar burn, and it wasn’t long before Malfoy was one, two, three knuckles deep, gently thrusting forward until it was time to add a second digit, and then a third. Harry could feel himself coming undone, a warm fire building in his abdomen as Malfoy picked up the pace, curling his fingers upwards so that their tips grazed his prostate. He pressed back onto Malfoy’s fingers, craving more.
“What about Potions?” Harry asked. “You were always brilliant at it.”
“I suppose you’re right.”
go blaming me! You were the one who fell under me!” Draco huffed, standing up and brushing himself off before glancing around. “Potter,
Harry did, and what he saw was breathtaking. A glittering black pond shone below, it’s glassy waters reflecting silver drops of moonlight. Surrounding the pond was a perimeter of pine trees, whose bodies cast long shadows over the earth.
“I’ll always be yours, love,” Harry murmured, taking a step forward so that their bodies were fully flushed. “Always.”
“Because I have a predicament.”
“Alright. We’ve got,” Harry began, glancing at his wrist watch, “ten minutes to buy our tickets.”
Harry hadn’t expected a note. He hadn’t expected a goodbye, either, for that matter. He’d figured that Malfoy would be in a rush to board the Hogwarts Express and get home to his mother for the Christmas holidays, and he’d accepted that. Besides, it wasn’t like they were anything serious—a few fucks here and there, and nothing more. They never spoke nor interacted outside of their professorly duties, and that was fine.
Draco turned around, his sharp features hardening as eyes landed on Harry. “Potter? What in
Harry turned to Draco, who was staring blankly at his shoes. “Hey, are you okay?”
Harry smiled softly at him. “Sure.”
Harry was taken aback at his bluntness, and he recoiled slightly. “That makes sense. Do you … like flowers?”
Forty-five minutes later, Harry and Draco moved to the couch in the living room, Stockinette following them. As they settled, both of them picking up their project bags from the coffee table, Harry felt a well of excitement inside his chest. Seeing Draco knit had rapidly become one of the highlights of his days.
“Well, are you two ready to go?” Andromeda asked, shaking Harry from his thoughts.
. They’re based on a farm that’s located on the largest of the Aran Islands, Inis Mór. I’m planning on leaving around nine tomorrow morning, taking a Portkey to the point in Galway, and then getting a Muggle ferry to Inis Mór. How does that sound?”
“Sure,” Draco said, handing his knitting to her.
“I love you too, Harry.”
As the three of them ate dinner, both Ron and Hermione finishing their bowls while Harry’s remained two-thirds full, Hermione cleared her throat.
doesn’t.”
As the late morning slowly inched towards midday, Harry found himself glancing in Draco’s general direction several times, each sending a violent wave of butterflies through his stomach. Draco was still struggling, dropping stitches left and right, and the beginning of his scarf looked more like a lopsided potholder than anything else. Meanwhile, everyone else was continuing to move along just fine, and Harry wasn’t worried about them getting the hang of knitting in the slightest. In fact, the only person he was concerned about was Draco.
There, he could see clean, loopy letters scrawled across the page in deep black ink.
And with that, Harry was left alone to wait. As McWeenie called pair after pair and the pool of potential partners dwindled down, he tried to survey his options, but his efforts proved to be fruitless. It was difficult to keep track of who had already been paired and who had yet to be, and he eventually gave up.
“So, Harry,” Hermione began, setting her book down. “Are things still going well between you and Draco? I feel like we didn’t get a chance to speak properly last night.”
By the time six o’clock rolled around, Harry had flipped the open sign to close and let down the front blinds before locking the door. Once everything had been closed up for the night, he scooped up Stockinette, who was sleeping on top of a pile of alpaca skeins in one of the eye-level cubbyholes, and slung his satchel over his shoulder before exiting through the back room and heading upstairs.
Draco offered her a hesitant smile, warming Harry’s heart. Although he’d forgiven Draco the moment he’d walked into the shop, there had been a part of him worrying about how Ron and Hermione would react.
,” Draco repeated flatly. “Right. Why?”
“Paying together or separate?” Amelia asked, pointedly looking at Harry instead of Draco.
Draco nodded. “Yes”
As Harry frowned, not at all reassured by Ron’s words, Hermione walked back into the room carrying a plastic bag. Resuming her seat next to Harry, she began to pull the contents out of the bag and set them on the table. Harry raised an eyebrow.
,” Harry said, flustered. “You’re
“Of course, Harry,” Hermione said, sounding weary. “We’ll see you both in a few minutes.”
“None of your business,” Draco said harshly, although his voice was lacking venom.
“Oh, of course,” Hermione said warmly.
“Really?” Andromeda asked, running a hand anxiously through her neatly styled hair. “He’s in a bit of a mood, Harry. I’m alright to finish getting him ready.”
It didn’t matter that Draco hadn’t slept with anyone else since they’d first begun their arrangement a little over a year ago, or that he wondered what it would feel like to hold Harry’s calloused hands in his own, or if he wished more than anything for a kiss that meant something more than a prelude to sex…because Harry didn’t want those things. Harry wanted rough touches and hurried kisses, barely pausing to breathe as they tore each other’s clothes off. He wanted the heat of Draco’s mouth around his cock and the burning sensation of Draco pushing into him, heavy pants and desperate pleas being the only sounds that filled the air.
“Well, were you naughty this year?”
Draco hummed in thought as he read over his own menu. “The tomato soup with brown bread and butter sounds particularly lovely.”
“Sure.”
However, those simple pleasures had seemingly become irrelevant over the past few months. Now, there were more important things at hand. Like thinking with his cock instead of his heart.
Potter swallowed hard. “Um, thanks, Malfoy—”
“Alright, well, my name is Mark Hurley, and I decided to join the workshop because I’ve always been a huge crafter. When I was little, my mum couldn't get the Crayola crayons out of my hands. Recently enough, I’ve taken an interest in fiber arts. I’ve taught myself how to felt in the last month, and I’m really hoping that this class will help me develop my knitting skills.”
Something shifted in Malfoy’s face, as though the conversation had suddenly become far less amusing, and he cleared his throat. “Well, I think we’re done here. See you around, Potter.”
“Étoile. It’s French for ‘star,’” Draco said.
Except for the fact that there was, indeed, a note with Malfoy’s loopy cursive in his hand—a note requesting his presence in Malfoy’s room, despite the fact that the Hogwarts Express would be leaving from Hogsmeade Station in an hour. Harry swallowed hard, his eyes tracing Malfoy’s words until they lost meaning.
Harry ducked his head, blushing. “Yes?”
“Of course,” Draco said, nodding anxiously. “Well, I’ve had a lovely time tonight. Thank you both so much for welcoming me into your home.”
As he stood there, dumbfounded, Malfoy glanced up. His eyes landed on Harry, and he raised a pale eyebrow. He made no motion to move.
Pansy snorted before taking a long sip of her lavender latte. “Whatever you need to tell yourself, love.”
“Fair enough,” Draco said.
Standing up again, he slowly approached Curry. She wearily eyed him as he began to hold out the grass before deciding that hunger won out over suspicious strangers. She took a few steps forward and started eating the grass, her lips tickling against the palm of Harry’s hand.
Malfoy leaned forward, placing wet, open-mouthed kisses along Harry’s chest before pausing to look at him. “What do you want, Potter? Do you want me to fuck you? Is that it? I’ll open you up so well, Potter. I’ll go slow, working one finger at a time until you’re wet, and shaking, begging for more. You want that?”
Draco turned to him, a look of confusion crossing his face. “You wanted to be an Auror?”
Once he had placed his order through tapping the items he wanted with the tip of his wand, he made himself a cuppa and settled onto the couch. Stockinette jumped in surprised, glowering at Harry as she rearranged herself.
By the time noon rolled around, Harry had squared away most of the new inventory and had pulled a chair to the front of the shop, watching a thunderstorm roll in across the bruised sky as he worked on his gloves.
“The latter, I think,” Draco said.
Harry grimaced. “Merlin. Well, I’d be happy to help with whatever you need.”
“I suppose,” Draco said sheepishly. “I’ve never had a thing, you know? Something that’s a part of me.”
Stockinette nudged Harry’s calf with her head, interrupting his thoughts. He looked down at her, grinning, and gave her a quick scratch behind the ear.
“I haven’t ruined everything?” Draco asked meekly.
Also, just confirming that the last chapter will be going up on Wednesday, Dec. 16th!
Next chapter goes up: Thursday, Nov. 26th
I am beyond appreciative of all the continuous love and support that both TWWW and I have been receiving <3
“Hey! How about this?” he asked.
“It’s beautiful,” Draco agreed as he followed Harry to the check-out counter. “Has it been hand dyed?”
“Did you and Weasley talk to me?” Draco asked.
“What’s in it for you?” Draco asked.
“Want to go to Dublin for the rest of the afternoon?”
By the time he Apparated to Potter’s, a warmth had spread rapidly through his body, and there was a loud, persistent buzzing in his chest. He felt loose, and calm, and
Draco shrugged. “Yeah, okay. Thank you.”
Once having landed on Inis Mór, they Apparated to a small village located on the northwest part of the island. As they gathered their bearings, dusting off any dirt from their particularly uneasy landings, Harry realized that they were standing in front of a long gravel driveway. In the distance, he could make out a large white farmhouse nestled in between luscious green hills that were dotted with sheep and cows. The rain had turned into a steady downpour, and there was a fierce wind blowing bitterly from the north. Harry watched longingly as plumes of black smoke rose from the house’s chimney.
“You can go ahead and come here at four. We’re going to use my Floo to get there,” Harry said.
Harry swallowed thickly as he gazed up, transfixed, at Draco. “Yeah, I’m alright. Just tired.”
“I shared a lot. I was
“Sure.”
“For years, the only thing I did was knit. Over time, I grew more sociable, and my life started coming together again. I actually didn’t open the shop until last December,” Harry said.
Malfoy leaned down, placing a small kiss on his forehead before grabbing his trunk and opening the door. “We beg McGonagall to let us use her Floo.”
“Come on, follow me.”
Ron nodded. “Speaking of, how much longer do we have for lunch?”
In order to avoid the heavy downpour, they walked underneath the row of overhangs lining the fronts of shops, an occasional raindrop hitting them. The alley was quiet, although Harry could see that all of the shops were bustling with customers. As they passed Flourish and Blotts, a surge of childhood memories passed through Harry’s mind, causing him to smile to himself.
Malfoy landed with a thud on the ground, and Harry realized he had completely forgotten to catch him. A cloud of dust erupted into the air, and he could hear several gasps coming from other groups nearby as McWeenie scrambled to help Malfoy up.
Harry shrugged, stealing Hermione’s abandoned cup of tea that was sitting on the coffee table and taking a sip. “I am.”
“Sounds good.”
As the queue moved up, the bell above the door went off and he could sense that someone had stepped behind him. He heard a sharp intake of breath, and then a voice that he hadn’t heard since the war began to speak.
“Yeah,” Harry said quietly, “Hogwarts.”
They shook on it, and Harry knew he was in for an adventure.
Harry grinned as he patted the space next to him. Draco rolled his eyes, although he couldn't help but let out a small laugh as he made his way to join Harry.
Next was the young man, roughly his age, sitting to his left.
“Oh, sweetheart,” Harry said, taking Draco’s hands in his own, “of course. Thank you so much for making it for me.”
“Good.”
“― And I doubt you ever had a say in the matter. I just wish other people would realize that,” Harry said, muttering the last part as he averted his eyes.
“ … Alright.”
“Bastard,” Draco mumbled, shoving him lightly in the shoulder.
“Yeah, Malfoy, I was thinking about you each second that you were gone.”
“Cissy, is there anything I can do to help?” Andromeda asked as she helped Teddy into his chair.
“Harry! It’s so good to see you again,” Laoise said, pulling Harry in for a brief hug before turning her attention to Draco. “And you must be Draco, Harry’s friend. He wrote us last night saying you were tagging along. Why don’t you two come on in? You must be freezing out here.”
It was such a contrast to the boy Draco had been last time they’d come face-to-face in the Manor. Then, Draco had hardly resembled a living person, his hollow face having been consumed with shadows. Although so many things stood out from that day so many years ago, one thing Harry couldn’t forget, no matter how hard he tried, was the look of sheer terror in Draco’s eyes. Harry had never seen anything like it, as though he was witnessing the death of the boy he’d grown up with.
Next chapter goes up: Saturday, Dec. 12th
“So,” Andromeda said, grinning as she interrupted, “you’re essentially telling me that this young man is fit?”
“Draco,” Harry began, his voice barely above a soft whisper, “I … I have something to tell you.”
Harry grinned, remembering Teddy’s doll. “Andy’s one of the kindest people I’ve ever met, which is remarkable considering what she’s been through. She’s got this fierceness to her ― something that reminds me a lot of Sirius ― and she’s hilarious. I know Ted, Tonks, and Remus’ deaths really hit her hard, so some days are worse for her than others. Overall, though, she’s doing pretty well, albeit a bit lonely.
Harry frowned. “Alright. Do you know what weight and measurements the pattern calls for?”
“Lovely, although would you mind casting a Disillusionment Charm on me? I’m not in the mood to get stared at today,” Draco said bitterly.
“You know what you need?” Pansy began to dig through her handbag. “You need a good shag.”
“Thank you, Potter.”
As soon as he unlocked the door to his flat, Stockinette twisted out of his arms and made a beeline for one of her favorite spots, the back of the couch in the living room. Setting down his things on the kitchen counter and digging his knitting out of his satchel, Harry let out a heavy sigh, his mind churning with thoughts of Draco.
Harry woke up to the sharp sound of something hitting against his bedroom window. As he groggily looked around, wiping sleep from the corners of his eyes, he realized that Colette, Draco’s owl, was directing rather impatient hoots his way. With a heavy groan, he reluctantly peeled back the covers and sat up, making sure to not disturb Stockinette, who was fast asleep on the other pillow. After a minute of adjusting to the frigid, early morning air, he slinked over to the window and let Colette in.
Brushing himself off as he stepped into the large drawing room, Harry took a look around. While the layout was seemingly the same, it appeared as though Narcissa had spent the past few years doing a major overhaul of the place. The cold, grey wall color had been stripped, and in its place sat Victorian turquoise and gold wallpaper. A large twelve light crystal chandelier hung from the tall ceiling, sending a cascade of rainbow refracted light across the room. Even the furniture had been replaced with a comfortable looking, chartreuse colored velvet couch and several sitting chairs that matched.
“Potter, we really ought to get up—” Malfoy began, sitting up.
Once they’d landed and brushed off any stray, frozen soil that had skidded up during impact, Harry looked to Draco. His cheeks and nose were bright red from the cold, and his hair was slightly mussed from the wind as he looked around and let out a heavy sigh.
As soon as he was free of the conversation, Harry wandered over to Draco, Ron, and Hermione, who were in the middle of discussing where to begin.
After a moment of reasoning with both Ron and Hermione, the latter had finally relented on the sole condition that she received weekly batches of biscuits. Ron, of course, had been happy to oblige.
“Thank you. I couldn’t have done it without my wife, who was the chief decorator,” Amber said, smiling brightly.
The familiar fierceness that had always lingered behind Draco’s eyes in their days at Hogwarts returned, and Harry swore he could see the hint of a smile.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Things don’t have to have a purpose in order for them to be useful. These cauldrons are art, just like a painting or a sculpture.”
Harry snorted. “Morning, Ron. Having a bit of trouble waking up?”
Draco nodded, peering at the different options. “Duly noted.”
While there had been a small line for the bakery, the rest of the restaurant was jam-packed with people seeking shelter from the cold. The host showed them to a small, two person booth in the back corner of the restaurant, giving them a surprisingly decent amount of privacy. As they took a seat across from one another, Harry realized just how hungry he was.
Harry could feel his cheeks burning as he took the bouquet. “Well, thanks for the flowers. Oh, and are you still living at the Manor?”
“Yeah,” Ron said, standing up from the couch. “I took the liberty of giving Stockinette a small snack while you were getting changed.”
“Okay, Stocky,” Harry began, immediately catching her attention. “I’ve got to go run an errand, but I’ll be back in a little bit. I’ve put your dinner out, and you’ve got fresh water. I’ll see you tonight, alright? We'll do big cuddles.”
Malfoy smirked. “
After the last customer, a middle-aged man who was a regular shopper, left, Harry checked his watch, which read five minutes until closing time. With a sigh, he reluctantly gave up on the idea that he would see Draco and forced his thoughts to move on, concentrating on neatening up the cubby holes that were dwindling concerningly low. He made a mental note to order more yarn, specifically merino wool from a small indie brand named Babbity Rabbity’s Ravelry.
“Because you’re …
“Andy, I’m here!” he shouted.
They spent the next ten minutes going through each and every soap, marveling at how accurately they resembled childhood treats. When they finally walked away, Draco was the proud owner of five new soaps.
, and not like the Saviour that the public desperately wanted him to be — but they were also the most painful. Loving Harry hurt; it was a dull ache that never seemed to resolve itself, even after years of assuring himself that his love would always be unrequited.
Draco blinked at him, slightly startled. “Yes, sorry. I was just admiring everything. It’s beautiful ― and so different from London, but in a good way."
“Mr. Potter! Watch out!”
“Just wondering,” Malfoy said, handing the receipt to Harry. “I’m gay.”
. Blue numbers appeared in the air, glowing against the early morning light, and revealed that it was eight o’clock. Rolling his eyes in annoyance, he peeled back his duvet and slid out of bed, the soles of his feet meeting the icy wooden floor. He padded to the bathroom, relieving himself before wandering to his wardrobe and exchanging his pajamas for a pair of fitted black jeans, a light pink cable knit jumper that complimented his golden brown skin, and canvas high-tops.
“Teddy! My man! How’s it going?” he asked, holding out his hand for a first bump.
mad at me for going behind her back. In fact, she told me to go ahead and schedule a day for the reunion to happen.”
Harry shrugged. “Why not? Do you have anything else to do today?”
“Granger,” Draco began, awkwardly clearing his throat, “thank you for having me.”
Harry let out a content sigh, closing his eyes as he threw his arm limply over Draco’s stomach. “I love you too.”
“I’m ― I’m so sorry, Malfoy,” Harry said softly.
. The levitating shelves surrounding the stall were clad with bright, shiny cauldrons glazed in a variety of different colors. Some even had patterns painted on them, ranging from stripes to animated Cornish pixies flying about.
“You might have an easier time if you loosen your grip. You’ve been knitting with a lot of tension, and I think this is why you’re having such a difficult time picking up your stitches,” Hermione said. “Can I show you what I mean on your scarf?”
“Yep,” Harry said, holding up the toy giraffe, which looked like it had seen better days, before turning to Stockinette. “Stocky, Uncle Draco and I’ve got to run an errand. We’ll be back this evening. Uncle Ron will be over to feed you lunch and dinner in case I’m not back by then, okay? I love you so much.”
“Don’t be,” Draco said, stepping forward and putting a hand reassuringly on Harry’s shoulder. “I just want to make sure you’re alright.”
“That’s ridiculous, Potter,” Draco began, trying to keep a straight face. “I certainly don’t need help with that blasted
Draco’s chest tightened at the thought of going another nine years unmarked, alone and an outcast in the wizarding world. “Yes, I suppose.”
Malfoy was mildly tolerable, and it was
As she took a seat in the armchair to the left of the couch, she said, “please, call me Hermione. And of course, Draco. Anyone who’s a friend of Harry’s is a friend of ours.”
As they continued their walk, Harry chose to not point out the fact that Draco easily could have cast a Heating Charm instead.
Malfoy looked ahead, his eyes fixated on something in the distance. “You see, there’s this git that I like, and I’ve felt this way about him for a while now — years, even. The issue is that we have history, and I’m not sure if liking each other is enough to bridge that gap. I’d like to think it is, though, because watching him from a distance has grown too difficult, and after this weekend … well, I don’t think I can go back to that.”
on them, he wandered back through the dining room. Just as he was about to head upstairs, he turned, staring at his knitting on the table.
Reaching the owlery, Harry paid the wizard behind the desk and handed him the letter before disappearing back into the cold winter air. It was busier than he’d expected, people flowing in and out of shops. He could see a particularly large crowd in Florean Fortescue’s Ice-Cream Parlor, people no doubt wanting something warm and sweet to drink.
already?”
They continued to chat as they walked, although Hermione’s mood only seemed to grow fouler as they neared their campsite. However, she was far from the only crotchety person in the group — many conversations could be heard criticizing not only the retreat itself, but the fact that McWeenie was forcing them to hike into camp the Muggle way to “build unity.”
“Ready?” Malfoy asked.
Harry let out a heavy sigh. “We’re not talking about the past ― well, not
“Well, I suppose we ought to show you your new inventory,” Laoise said.
“Listen,” Draco began, his gaze shifting from Ron to Hermione, “I … I’d like to apologize. Formally, I mean. I was awful to you both, and no matter how much I wish I could take every vile thing I said back, I know that I can’t. It’s taken years for me to fully own up to my decisions, and now that I have … well, please know that I am very, truly sorry for the years of bullying and all of the hurt I caused. I'm not expecting to be forgiven. I just … wanted you to know.”
Hermione rolled her eyes, although she managed a bright smile. “By the way, Harry, I’m proud of you for telling everyone about you and Draco last night. How did it feel to finally get it out?”
Draco briefly closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. When he opened them, tears were threatening to spill out.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “I didn’t know that.”
“No worries. We’re just introducing ourselves,” Harry said, offering him a warm smile.
“Coming?” Draco asked, grinning.
“That’s the impression I got too. Anyway, I thought it might be worth mentioning.”
“Hey, Artemis,” Harry said, stroking her gently before untying the scroll attached to her right ankle.
“Very interesting, considering you have none of the latter,” Draco said smugly.
After taking an hour to decide on what to wear ― eventually landing on a rich purple jumper and blue jeans that were slightly ripped at the knees ― Harry ventured out into the bitterly cold early afternoon. The sky had changed to a clear, light blue, but the sun only provided so much warmth as Harry made his way to the closest tube station. Strong gusts of wind prompted him to tighten the knitted navy and gold triangle shawl around his neck, and he quickened his pace.
“What did you do to make the collar of your jumper look different from the body?” Draco asked.
Harry held out his arm, and Draco took hold of it. Then, without warning, they began twisting violently through the air, eventually landing hard on the ground. While Harry brushed himself off, Draco looked onto the main road.
Walking into the living room, he could see Ron, who was half-asleep, curled on the couch with Hermione, who was engrossed in her latest read,
Harry reluctantly dragged himself over to where Malfoy was, although he made sure to stand a good few meters away. Even so, he could smell Malfoy’s aftershave — orange and pine — and he tried to reassure himself that it was normal to feel enraptured by the way his childhood enemy smelled.
“Malfoy,” Ron said, nodding.
Grabbing the remote off of the coffee table, Harry flicked the television on, surfing through the channels and eventually landing on
remind me to shrink my bags before dinner.”
“It’s good to see you,” Harry said quietly.
“Fuck, Malfoy,” Harry panted, tugging Malfoy’s jumper over his head to expose pale soft skin covered in scattered clusters of beauty marks. “I didn’t think I’d see you again until after term resumed.”
“So, Harry, remember how I told you I have a surprise?”
Gathering all his courage, Harry turned to look at Malfoy, whose gaze had shifted to the ground. “Want to know what I think?”
As Harry sat up, rubbing at his eyes, he wished more than anything that Draco was there, in bed, next to him. After they’d spent Friday evening helping Narcissa with decorations, floral arrangements, and the ludicrous Christmas tree for the Ministry’s Christmas Ball, he and Draco had announced to her during dinner that they were dating. Narcissa had promptly taken one look at them, smiled softly, and said, “and the sky is blue. Is the fish cooked alright? It’s a new recipe.”
Draco blushed, letting out an embarrassed laugh. “I’m glad.”
,” he insisted, his face turning a pale shade of pink. “I’m
He didn’t even have a significant other to confide in. He and Ginny hadn’t lasted long after the war had ended, both deciding that they worked better as friends. A few months after their breakup, news had traveled that Ginny and Luna had begun dating. Now, a year and a half later, they were still together. And Harry was happy for them ― he was ― however, although he was no longer romantically interested in Ginny, he couldn’t help but think about the fact that he could’ve been her love in another life. One where he was attracted to her, and she was attracted to him.
Teddy nodded enthusiastically as Harry headed over to his closet and began to comb through the various shirts and jumpers hanging up. Halfway through the rack, Harry landed on a jumper he’d made Teddy for his sixth birthday. It had been knitted out of light brown alpaca and mohair, and Harry had embroidered a black colored dog, not unlike Sirius’ Animagus, onto the front. He unhooked the jumper’s hanger from the rack and faced Teddy, holding it up with a smile.
No one noticed, nor questioned, when they both stood up from the couch and wandered out into the back garden, taking a seat on the marble bench in the reeds. Draco cast a Heating Charm, as well as a charm to deflect the snow, which was coming down in velvety bouts.
Harry squeezed his eyes shut and took a deep breath, willing the stirring in his trousers to die down. After a moment, he opened his eyes again and checked his wristwatch, which read five past ten. Only fifty-five minutes until the train disembarked from the station, and he had a decision to make.
During the time they’d spent living together, Draco had managed to become completely immersed in Harry’s life. He participated in holidays at The Burrow, drinks with Seamus and Dean every other Friday, and bi-monthly dinners with the Granger-Weasleys at their new cottage, which was where they were heading home from now.
Before they knew it, an hour had passed and their arms were full of paper bags containing gifts. As they wandered towards the sitting room’s fireplace, Draco stopped short.
Potter cleared his throat, stepping aside. “Uh, morning, Malfoy. Come on in.”
Rounding the corner, he paused in his tracks. There he saw Draco petting Stockinette, who was sprawled across his lap, with great pleasure. Stockinette looked to be having the time of her life, eyes closed and deep purrs emitting from her throat.
“Well, it’s not like you’re any better. You shit yourself anytime you’re in the same room as Granger—which is
Harry took in a deep, shuddering breath. “Have you ever felt tethered to someone, as though there was a string connecting the two of you together? It’s like I’m on a yarn winder, and no matter how fast or slow I’m spinning, the other person is winding the exact same way.”
Rolling his eyes, Harry stocked off to the bathroom to take a quick shower before work. He savored the hot water flowing over him, his muscles stiff from the frigid morning air, and took his time lathering himself with an orange and cinnamon liquid body soap.
“Do you honestly want to hear what a former Death Eater has been up to all these years?” Draco asked.
Holding back a smile, Harry nodded. “Yeah, they do, and they’ll look great on your mum.”
Draco folded his arms over his chest. “You look ridiculous.”
“It’s beautiful,” Draco said softly.
“He wants the bloody tree to reach the ceiling, which should be interesting considering the fact that it’s six and a half meters tall.”
When Harry had learned that there had been a building for sale in Diagon Alley that included both a storefront and a flat above, he thought it had been nearly too good to be true. Looking back, it had been the best purchase of his life, especially since he spent practically all of his time at the shop. Somehow, he had managed to luck into living in the very place that made him the happiest, something he swore would never be taken for granted.
Harry watched as, next to him, Ron’s face soured at his mother’s words. He, Ron, Hermione, Molly, Arthur, Andromeda, and Teddy were huddled on the front porch of the Manor, a strong wind blowing gusts of snow flurries around them. As soon as Harry had asked Draco if he could come over on Christmas, he’d begun plotting a way for at least some of the Weasleys, as well as Andromeda, Teddy, and Hermione to come along with him as a surprise.
“I asked Amber, the woman who runs the fair, for the cauldron stall’s contact information. From there, it was only a matter of describing the one I wanted. Miraculously, they hadn’t managed to sell the dragon one,” Harry said, grinning as he watched Draco admire the ceramic cauldron, its deep silver glaze sitting stark against the blinding white of the snow falling around them. “I hope it’s an alright present. I know you said you’re not a huge fan of cauldron art as a whole, but you did say that you liked the dragon one, and I thought ―”
Draco raised an eyebrow in amusement as he began to gather his things. “My, my, Potter. That fond of me already?”
Amber shook her head. “Unfortunately not. We couldn’t find a babysitter for our toddler, so she’s at home. I’m sure she’s been roped into reading
When Harry woke, the world was silent, the earth covered in a fresh layer of snow. Pale overcast light fell in through the crack in his curtains, highlighting small particles of dust floating through the still air. A blanket of coldness hung over the bedroom, sinking into Harry’s hands and seeping into his spine, and he burrowed further under the covers.
“They’re amazing,” Harry said, awestruck. “Do you still have your old sheep?”
, would you stop fidgeting?”
“Potter, I truly do not need you to pay for me,” Draco said, an edge to his voice.
Narcissa let out a light laugh, which Harry was relieved to see reach her eyes, and crouched down in front of Teddy. “I have some Cauldron Cakes, although they’re for dessert.”
“Sure. I can send it off tonight.”
Before Malfoy could finish, Harry pressed their lips together. It was gentle, soft, warm, and unlike any other kiss they’d shared. Malfoy’s eyes fluttered shut, and Harry could feel his eyelashes against his cheek. The warm feeling in his chest grew, echoing throughout his body like a building crescendo. Slowly, he let himself wrap his arms around Malfoy’s neck, and Malfoy’s arms moved to his waist, pulling them closer together.
He watched as Draco pulled his scarf, if one could call it that, out of his project bag and lay it out across his lap. Harry tried to mask his look of horror as he took in the uneven rows of bright orange yarn and the multitude of dropped stitches. Silently, he admitted that even
Ten minutes later, Draco and Narcissa returned to the dining room, followed by a trail of levitating platters. The rich smell of citrus filled the air, and Harry’s stomach doubled over with hunger.
“ … Well, I was pretty sick after the war. Hermione suggested knitting as a way to cope, and I took to it like a house on fire. As I continued to improve with my knitting, I kept getting letters from the Auror Department saying they wanted to hire me. And, well, I just
“Being an Auror isn’t living up to your childhood dreams, is it?”
Harry shot him a cheeky grin. “Well, I
Draco leaned back in his seat, crossing his arms in amusement as a smirk spread across his face. “Alright then,
Draco shrugged. “Why not?”
With a sigh, he turned out of his bedroom and down the hallway. As soon as he caught sight of Draco, he let out a breath that he didn’t know he’d been holding.
“Which is
Except, with a horrid realization, Harry
And maybe that was enough. Maybe it was alright that these moments were as close to a relationship as Harry was going to get. Maybe he didn’t want fine dining, or movie nights, or just sitting together while they graded their students’ essays. Maybe being nearly there was all he could afford to have.
, Draco.”
“I was thinking,” Harry began, his voice breaking the silence, “what if you stayed the night?”
However, he was taken aback when he saw the large poinsettia plant that Draco was carrying.
Teddy relented, pouting as he stuck his hands back in his lap. “Fine.”
Once they’d taken their seats across from one another at the table, Harry pulled out his yarn and needles and began to cast on the beginning of his one-hundred and twenty-one stitches. He’d occasionally look up and see Draco staring intently at his fingers.
“What can I do for you?” Harry asked, pressing a gentle kiss to Draco’s collarbones. “How can I make you feel good?”
Harry snorted. “Please, like you’re worth my time.”
As he stepped into Andromeda’s living room, he spotted a large box of Cheerios upside down on the ground, sticky O’s littering the carpet. Figuring that Andromeda was helping Teddy get ready, he whipped out his wand and quickly cleaned the mess.
Once they reached the front of the queue, Amelia immediately greeted them with a wide smile.
Draco let out a heavy sigh. “Christmas was always my favorite day of the year as a child. I was beyond spoilt, never failing to be gifted every single thing that I’d asked for. My father has never been a particularly happy man, but he always smiled on Christmas. As I grew up and The Dark Lord began to gain notoriety again, Christmas felt like the one day that I didn’t have to think about my responsibilities.
Harry cleared his throat and handed the letter over to Draco for him to read. After a minute or two, Draco let out a heavy sigh and gave the letter back.
Last update goes up: Wednesday, Dec. 16th
After propping the window open, Draco climbed through it and sat with his bum on the ledge as he held his broom out underneath him. Before Harry could ask if he was all set, he pushed himself off of the ledge, dropping out of sight.
Grinning, Harry said, “sounds good. Grab the Portkey on the count of three.
Harry nodded. “Yeah. In fact, you were the one who led us into the common room after we had a run in with Percy Weasley as Crabbe and Goyle. You told us that you wished you knew who the heir was, so we figured we could rule you out then.”
Harry squeezed his eyes shut, jagged memories filled with Hermione’s screams as she was tortured by Lestrange piercing the quiet air, and Draco’s note fluttered to the floor.
Hermione sighed, running a hand through her hair. “Alright, Harry. I trust you. Ron?”
Harry beamed. “Brilliant.”
Narcissa pursed her lips in thought for a moment before glancing at Draco and saying, “I think we have everything under control, but thank you. We’ll be back in a minute.”
“No.” Harry angled himself so that he was partially facing Draco. “I mean
Wait, why are you saying all of this?”
“Mr. Potter?”
Before Draco had a chance to respond, Ron yelled from the kitchen, “dinner’s ready!”
They continued on to a stall that consisted of hand-blown glass sculptures. Harry’s eyes immediately went to an amber colored sculpture in the shape of a Snitch. Just as Harry reached to pick up the Snitch, Draco did the same. Their hands brushed, Draco’s skin warm and soft, and Harry was entirely lost. The moment hung suspended in air, Christmas carols and loud chatter fading into the background, and for the second time that night Harry felt the urge to hold onto whatever this was for as long as possible.
