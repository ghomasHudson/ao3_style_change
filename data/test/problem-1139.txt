The name niggled at Blaise's mind, but he didn't know why. Did they know a James Evans? Someone from a younger year at Hogwarts, maybe?
Harry tensed, waiting for a surge of jealousy from Draco but feeling only love and happiness through their bond. Hermione had been right – the bond was completely satisfied with their fidelity now that they were married.
“– and cast the incantation,” she finished, giving him a saucy wink.
"Mr. Evans?"
Harry was grinning like a loon, and Draco was absolutely beaming. They looked out over their friends, proud to be able to share this moment with them, even if it was sooner than planned and a much smaller gathering than anticipated. Draco felt a twinge of sadness that Caleum hadn't been there to see them marry, but he knew the boy wouldn't mind the fact that he didn't have to sit through a stuffy ceremony. He'd be so over the moon at having Harry as a part of their permanent family – 'for keeps,' as Cal had put it last week – that it wouldn't matter a bit that he hadn't been there to see it.
"Why a Pensieve, though?" Draco asked, still stroking the soft stone. He could swear he felt it move under his hand, as though responding to his touch.
Harry gave his cock one last hard stroke before he was lost in his own orgasm, knowing Draco was coming as well by the way Draco's tight channel constricted around his fingers. They both slowed their strokes as the last of their orgasms pulsed. The only sound in the room was their heavy breathing.
Neville checked his watch again, wondering how much longer the two wizards would be unconscious. They'd been gone more than an hour, and the Ministry official was due any minute. Their movements had gotten more frantic, so Neville figured they must be near the end. He shivered despite the warm room, drawing his robes around himself tightly.
"No worries, Hermione," he said, grinning. He could set her mind at ease if that was what she was worrying about. "I don't mind sitting with the left-overs."
Harry's head fell back, his entire body convulsing with the force of his orgasm. He nearly bit through his lip before he realized it was alright to scream, letting himself shout loudly as his cock pulsed, shooting jets of come across the arm of the sofa. He shuddered as another wave of pleasure shook him, his muscles twitching with the strength of the unexpected aftershock.
Hannah plunked herself down at the table, digging a copy of
She paused, waiting for a response from the Slytherin. He wasn’t generally talkative, but tonight’s level of reticence was unusual, even for him. She turned, watching with interest as Theo clenched his jaw and shut his eyes tightly.
"So, Potter, what are you doing these days?"
"Cousin?" Ginny asked, earning herself a slap on the wrist when she snaked out a hand to grab a hot mushroom.
Draco had no words to describe the awesome surge of power he felt when their auras separated and merged with their magical cores once more. He felt warm, secure and
Draco sighed and pushed back from his desk. His response would have to wait. He walked toward the door, stopping to grab his briefcase and cloak from his secretary.
in his possession when he'd been arrested, ripped from his parents' side in the Great Hall the morning after Harry killed Voldemort. His frown deepened as he thought about the desolate month he'd spent in the wizarding prison, cold and terrified despite the absence of Dementors. He shivered, his insides clenching as he thought about his father, dying alone in a dank, dirty cell.
Draco looked over his shoulder, his eyes finding his mother and Blaise. As Cal's grandmother and godfather, they were the only two who could object. He saw nothing but pride and joy in both their faces. They had obviously been in on the secret as well.
"I love Neville Longbottom."
I, Harry James Potter of the Noble Houses of Black and Potter, do hereby formally announce my intention to court and marry. As is my right and due by virtue of my station, I am here by invoking
Draco's breath hitched as he scrambled to turn the pages, cursing his stiff uncooperative fingers as he tore the paper in his haste. It couldn't be, could it? Potter hated the press. Surely, he wouldn't have exposed both of them in that manner? His eyes flew over the text, heart racing as he looked for any sign of his name. There was none. His elation at finding Harry wasn't involved with Smith vanished at the thought that there was someone else, some other mystery love interest Draco hadn't known about. Of course, not finding his name was a good thing, he assured himself. Wasn't that the reason he didn't want to pursue anything with Potter in the first place?
"By all means, Potter, tell the lady exactly what you mean," Draco said, his polite smile not quite reaching his stormy grey eyes. "Or is that why you prefer online dating? Find it easier to write than to speak?"
Harry's head bobbed, his eyes snapping open. Hermione sighed, leaning over to turn several pages of the open manuscript in front of him. They were still going over edits – the final round, thankfully – and Harry had been dozing on and off for the last hour.
, his mind screamed, his balls tightening painfully.
Harry choked on the water he'd just taken a sip of, his wide eyes meeting the stylist's in the mirror.
He would have asked for Blaise's help writing a response, but his secretary poked her head in the door before he could ask.
He saw Ron wince in sympathy as yet another pin missed its mark, this one stabbing Harry in the ankle. He flinched, careful to keep his mouth shut this time.
Madge narrowed her eyes. Just yesterday she had spent the better part of an hour at Young and Kentworth's waiting for her boss' new tailored robes to be finished.
"More opportunistic than sycophantic," Oliver said from behind them, startling Draco. The blond turned, watching as Oliver made himself at home and poured all three of them a drink, Levitating the glasses of Firewhisky over to Blaise and Draco. "I decided to Apparate over instead of Floo, give the press something new to talk about."
"What?" Ron asked his eyes were still glazed as he struggled to sit up to see what had happened.
Blaise paused, striding into the room with a hefty file folder.
"Draco Malfoy, Malfoy Chateau," he said clearly, crouching down so he could peer into the green flames.
: MustLoveQuidditch
He watched, helpless, as Malfoy crossed the ball room in long, elegant strides, his straight posture and haughty expression giving no clue that anything was amiss. Moments later Harry saw Pansy streak past. This time he actually
He broke off, shrugging. He was trying to explain his surprising attraction to Harry Potter to Ginny Weasley. The irony wasn't lost on him, but she was the only other person he knew who might understand. She picked up on the hesitation immediately, her jaw dropping when she realized who he must be talking about.
, she thought, her jaw clamping shut.
"Patzie bores easily, and I didn't do enough to keep her entertained," he said, a small smile curving his lips. She'd hated living at Malfoy Manor, hated that Draco preferred quiet nights in to the glittering balls the rest of their social strata loved. "Cal was born in 2002." His smile grew. "His birthday is in September. He'll be six."
"Father!" Cal yelled, hurtling across the slick ground to pounce on Draco. He knelt, not caring that the knees of his trousers were instantly soaked, opening his arms to the giddy boy. "You're home! Harry said you would be, but I got worried because it's been
"I want a family, Ron. I've wanted one for as long as I can remember. Being bent doesn't change that, you know. Just because I'm gay doesn't mean I wouldn't be a good father," he said, looking Ron in the eye.
He shook his head, clearing away the memory. "I haven't seen or heard from her since. She's under a stringent Unbreakable Vow that prevents her from talking about anything other than our first year of marriage. Nothing after Cal was born. She can't speak of the chateau, either."
"James Evans does
Harry nodded, snagging the last piece of toast as he stood, hurrying upstairs to his bedroom. Hermione followed, giving him a chance to get into the shower before entering the room and rifling through his closet, looking for something suitable for the business meeting. Harry preferred casual Muggle clothes to wizarding robes, but James Evans was always decked out in fashionable wizarding wear when he went out in public. It was yet another distinction that helped Harry glide from one personality to the next – a way to ensure he never slipped up and forgot which face he was wearing in public.
"Harry James Potter, Head of the House of Potter, Head of the House of Black," Kingsley intoned, nodding toward Harry, who tapped his wand against his family seals. The Potter Seal glowed a deep crimson, while the Black Seal glowed light green.
The silvery liquid shimmered and rippled, a soft sparkling mist rising up out of the basin. Draco knew what he saw when he dove into the memories would likely terrify him. He was positive though, that whatever it was, whatever these dark secrets Harry had chosen to share with him, and not the rest of the world, it wouldn't change the way he felt about Harry.
"Before we start, I just want to thank everyone for coming to bear witness for us," Harry said, smirking when he saw knowing smiles appear on everyone but Hermione's faces. "It means a lot to me – and to Draco as well, I'm sure – to know we have friends who care about us as deeply as all of you do."
Draco watched him go, absently wondering why Potter's quick escape didn't give him more satisfaction. He'd lived for moments like these in school – the opportunity for abject mortification for his rival – and this should have been even sweeter, since for once he'd actually forced the cocky Gryffindor to retreat.
"You can be such a stubborn prick," Blaise spat, rolling his eyes as he watched Draco drink himself into oblivion for the third night running.
"I'd love some! However do you know just when I need a spot of tea, Madge-pie?"
Finally fed up after years of Ron's taunts and insults, he'd laced Ron's porridge with a Lip Locker potion on Christmas morning a few years back. While Molly had been slightly miffed, the rest of the family agreed that the holiday was much more pleasant without Ron's constant griping. Ron still hadn't forgiven him, despite the fact that man had been nothing but polite to him since.
"Because it was time," he answered easily, his tone at odds with the concern tinting his eyes. "Is he alright?"
? Though he had to give him credit for being clever, there was no way it would work.
surprised.
"Well, that's a bit chintzy," Blaise drawled, wrinkling his nose. "A copy of a book he gets for free? One you've already read, even?"
"Hermione, what are you doing –" he broke off, his eyes widening as he took in her formal robes and high heels, "– the meeting. Fuck. I'm sorry."
Ron groaned, heaving himself up off the sand after reading the headline. He didn't need to see more than that to know they needed to go home immediately. It wasn't the news he'd been expecting, but it would cause fireworks all the same.
Draco sighed, throwing himself into an elegant heap on the sofa. He could see he wasn’t going to win this one, and truth be told, he didn’t want to push Theo any further. He admired his friend’s determination, even if he questioned his methods. Then again, Theo didn’t have millions of Galleons in the bank as a safety net should his career plans tank. He was from an old pure-blood family, but they’d lost most of their money during the first rise of Voldemort.
Draco sat back against the plush velvet, watching the scene before him with detached amusement. It wasn't that he couldn't appreciate the beauty of the naked, writhing women on the stage, it was just that they held no real attraction for him. Large breasts and long, shapely legs had never really appealed to him, though his former wife Patrizia had possessed both.
may have, but Patrizia didn't feel the same way," Draco said with a grimace. "The life-in-exile bit got old for Patzie pretty quickly. She hated being cloistered in the chateau, which is where I insisted Cal be raised. She hated living with mother. She hated that I refused to go out at all anymore, other than to work and a few absolutely necessary social functions."
Ron grinned at Harry, who felt relieved to see his friend relax.
is in the next chapter, so just be patient. It's nothing dark or bad, and it's nothing that would force Draco to do anything he doesn't want to do. Harry has no plans other than fluffy romance, I promise.
"Eloquent as always," Snape sneered, managing to look condescending and superior even as a painting. Harry's eyes flashed as he stared the oil portrait down.
"We are meeting, you know," he said, smiling shyly when her head snapped up, eyes wide. "The weekend after your wedding. It's the earliest time we've both have a day free."
"No."
"Do you think he'll come?"
"Whole body?"
"Thank you, Madge, I'll take care of it myself. Orion's just getting a bit possessive in his old age, I think," he said smoothly, striding out into the reception area and gently untying the burden from the owl's leg. He grabbed a few owl treats off of Madge's desk and tossed them to Orion, who caught them in his beak and immediately took off.
one," he said, pointing over his shoulder to the baby, who was staring contentedly at the mobile Harry had charmed to the ceiling, "eats constantly. Must be a Weasley family trait."
Whatever they were, it apparently pleased Draco. Blaise sighed, his eyes drawn to the smiling Muggle in the photo again. Odd. Very odd.
"My room," Harry said simply, ducking back out and into the corridor. It had been cramped when he was a child, but it was nearly impossible to fit comfortably in there now.
Harry laughed, rolling his eyes when Draco launched into a detailed explanation about the ingredients Cal had been experimenting with and telling him exactly why they had exploded. The boy definitely had potions genius potential. Even Snape thought so. He'd been – Harry searched for the right word, but kept landing back on
"Everything," Harry agreed, nodding solemnly.
"Mr. Potter, if you would please exchange rings with Mr. Malfoy," Kingsley said, his snicker barely hidden. He had obviously overheard Hermione's comment as well. "Please repeat after me: I give you a symbol of my love, devotion and fidelity."
Draco turned, nodding at the Gryffindor. It was obvious Neville had already had a few drinks from the way his hand was slowly snaking its way up Pansy’s shirt. From the looks of things, she was on her way to tanked as well, since she was doing nothing to stop it.
“I’ll just go,” she said, averting her eyes when Theo groaned and bit his lip.
"When is he free?"
"Harry –"
"He'll be eleven in two days," Draco said, his tone exasperated.
be distracted during my wedding, Harry Potter! You're the best man, and you've got to be –"
Draco twirled around again, taking the time to really appreciate everything Harry had done. He was completely awestruck. Harry was giving him Christmas as his final gift? A perfect wintry day, made even more special by including his son. His throat tightened as he beamed at Harry, not at all sure he could speak without his voice breaking.
. They were so secluded that the issues were coming a day late, but Ron devoured them anyway.
He would have been shocked to see his own aura, which was an even mix of turquoise and green, heavily spotted with orange and purple and liberally spiked with various shades of red. The shimmering silver band of the bonding spell wove through his aura as well, drawing it in tighter and tighter until all of the energy was forced back inside his magical core.
been his idea, even if he hadn't been involved in its execution.
Neville nodded, flopping down onto a chair near the sofa Pansy occupied. He was comfortable in her home – he'd been there dozens of times, though usually he was with either Harry or Draco.
Draco laughed, leveling his wand at Harry to cast a discreet Sobriety Spell. It wouldn’t completely ruin the dark-haired boy’s buzz, but it would make him coherent enough to realize dancing on a table and frotting against his best friend was probably a bad idea.
"I'll keep you safe," Harry announced, slamming down the rest of his beer and putting the empty glass on the table. "Protect your virtue and whatnot. No worries,
Author’s note: Warning for slight het. It blends with Hermione’s chapter, which will be next.
Harry cocked his head, considering Draco's words. He could tell the blond was confused as to why he'd Fire-called, and to be honest, so was Harry. He'd just felt the need to talk to Draco, though he couldn't explain why. He knew he wouldn't be able to see Draco tonight without touching him, and they couldn't have that – not when they were so close to the end of the courtship. They'd done everything right so far, and they couldn't risk derailing it now. They needed the ancient laws on their side if they were to have any hope of hiding Cal's existence.
The flames roared to life, and Draco stepped back, leaving room for his guests to climb through. He sighed when he saw a familiar face appear.
Harry's grin nearly split his face as he saw his friend's tactical error. Before he could warn him, a sharp Stinging hex hit Ron squarely on the arse.
"I'm sorry to be rushing this, gentlemen," Kingsley said softly, pulling Harry's attention back to the task at hand.
was the law he proposed. It's a formal Wizard's Oath to pursue a courtship. It literally means pursuit with determination and resolve, or something like that."
, he thought as he watched Draco un-ward the Floo and Fire-call his own solicitor, heedless of the late hour.
his mind screamed. He was vaguely aware of Blaise calling his name, but he couldn't focus on it, not with the horrible buzzing in his head and the aching throb in his chest. Because Harry –
Theo cleared away the dishes, refusing Draco's assistance on the grounds that he'd cooked, so someone else should clean. He took the opportunity to question Gin, who had just returned from tucking Freddie into her cot. Cal was sprawled on the floor, coloring a picture of a very misshapen hippogriff.
She picked her way through the study, stepping over the scattered pages of Harry's manuscript, which blanketed the floor. From the looks of it, he'd attempted to review some of the edits and gotten frustrated at some point last night.
He raised a hand to his head, feeling the sticky, matted locks again.
Harry tried to swallow his laughter, feeling sorry for his obviously hurting friend.
they wouldn't have done anything together. Harry dismissed his earlier worries, wondering if Hangover Potions had some sort of unknown hallucinogenic side effect. Really. Him and
His balls ached, already far past the need for release. He closed his eyes, biting his lip as he continued his ministrations. He only hoped Sly caught on soon – they would need to remove the cock rings to come, which would end the spell. As much as he wanted to come, he didn't want to end the sweet torture of this bizarre contact with Sly just yet.
Harry knew several of his friends held the missing information – Neville, for sure, since he worked for Draco somewhere in France, and possibly Ginny, who seemed more closed-mouth about the entire thing than he had expected.
Draco smiled, the niggling guilt he'd felt since last night leaving him. He might be attracted to Potter, but he wouldn't act on it. Ginny's reaction had been enough to convince him it was absolute folly to even consider it. And why should he, when things were going so well with Gryffin? His attraction to Potter had felt almost like cheating when he thought about it last night, but sitting here with Ginny, he realized it had just been a momentary spark, something that likely wouldn't even happen again. After all, how many more times would he and Potter ever shake hands?
astounds me, so I suppose we're even."
"Zach," he responded, his tone frosty as he bowed slightly to the wizard who'd just made his way over to their table.
Ron smiled, nodding. The words did nothing to assuage his fears about Harry and Malfoy, but they did remind him why they were there. He had no reservations about marrying Hermione. He'd sprint down the aisle to her if he could.
made the connection? Ron had told him about Harry's reaction to Draco at the stag party, and Neville had witnessed the obvious attraction between the two men on the rare occasions their paths crossed in public.
Blaise had the flu.
"Merlin, yes," Neville answered, laughing slightly uncomfortably.
"I'll allow six questions," Harry said, studying the crowd carefully. Every reporter there had raised their hand, eagerly waving it to garner his attention.
Harry focused on the manuscript he was proofing, his attention drifting in and out of the conversation Draco and Cal were having, enjoying watching the light and dark heads bent together over the work bench. The enthusiasm was clear in both their voices.
"I know," Draco said softly, his lips curving into a slight smile. It was just another way Harry was trying to protect him, and he wouldn't let himself get irritated with the man because of it. He met Harry's gaze head-on. "I want you there when I do."
He nursed his club soda, resolved not to drink at all tonight. He'd only just rid himself of the headache from last night's over-indulgence, which he was in no hurry to repeat.
"I still don't understand why he didn't invite Draco," Hermione said crossly, sloshing a bit of the Muggle beer she held when someone jostled her from behind.
Neville sighed, wondering how Harry managed to get into situations like these. He didn't need Draco to tell him that James Evans was a penname – he was one of only a handful of people in the world who already knew that.
Harry wrinkled his nose, clicking around to see if there was a way to disable the notification. He wasn't technically available for chat – he only wanted to talk with Sly. He'd arrived in the chat room a few minutes early, and he wondered if that had been a mistake.
Harry thought, releasing the clasp on his cock ring. The odd sensation of his own hand on his cock was immediately noticeable, its slightly rough skin so much different from the softer, firmer grasp Sly had used. He barely had to stroke himself at all before he was coming, black spots bursting behind his eyes as he convulsed with the force of his release.
"Well, he was insane," he said slowly, wondering why Draco was questioning Voldemort's motivations.
"Let's start again. What is your name?" the man asked as soon as the door had closed, and Draco closed his eyes, his magically bound hands tightening into fists under the table.
“Draco,” Theo answered, his tone mocking. He heaved his bag up on his shoulder, checking the pocket of his Muggle denims for his wand.
– this couldn't be happening.
She laughed, wagging her finger at him. "You're a still a boy to me, Teddy Lupin, and don't you forget it! Now get to bed, and I'll be there soon!"
"I'm sure it's not," Harry answered, his voice cold. "It was nice to see you, Malfoy. Take care."
"Finally," he sighed, breaking free of her embrace to pay the owl for the paper.
"He's been practicing on the house elves," Draco said with a laugh, sliding a pan of roasted shallots and mushrooms out of the oven and resting it on the counter. He turned, stirring the garlic cream sauce bubbling away on the range. "He's determined to be the best cousin he can be."
"You are too, Draco."
“Great party!” Neville shouted, clapping Draco on the back.
Blaise nodded, still watching Harry warily. It was a good sign. Harry was still interested in pursuing the courtship, apparently. And he cared enough about Draco to race down to St. Mungo's, knowing he'd likely be turned away at the door.
"It's old-fashioned romance," Pansy said simply, dragging a hand along Oliver's jaw fondly. She turned back to Hermione, frowning. "It's not a one-way street, either. After accepting fourteen of the suitor's gifts, the person being courted has to give a gift in return. One that signifies whether or not he or she is willing to go on with the courtship."
"So it's Harry now, is it?" Draco mocked, his eyes dull when he met Blaise's gaze.
"Yes," Harry sighed, his eyes flicking to the bracelets and potion on the table.
Kingsley knelt before Cal, placing his wand against his heart.
"Tonight?" He asked, nodding toward the soapstone Pensieve Draco had left out on his desk.
"Harry!" He yelled, frustrated he couldn't get a clear shot off.
Draco rarely left during the day unless it was to attend a meeting or pop over to see his son for lunch, so the witch was a bit concerned.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. If they were mine, the Epilogue would have been
"No Hangover Potion?" Draco asked, Summoning one of the sandwiches from the bag. He'd worked through lunch, and he was starving.
he thought, cursing himself roundly for making this into a competition when he felt Gryffin's grip change, the unfamiliar planes of his other palm now grazing over Draco's heated skin. The tendons stood out on Draco's wrist as he fisted his bright-red cock, his tongue raw from pushing up against his teeth as he struggled not to moan. He would
Blaise heard a heavy sigh and an ominous silence. Against his better judgment, he propelled himself forward, walking through the open door into Draco's study without so much as a cursory knock.
"What?" The word was barely a whisper, but filled with incredulity and need.
"Wait," he said, catching her hand as she pulled away. He nodded toward the bed, and she sat, openly curious now.
Neville released Harry, letting the other man fall heavily back against the cushions.
"Who said anything about waiting?" he asked, his voice deep with arousal.
for the wedding? *grins*
, he chastised himself,
"What –"
"I'm going, before you say something that will make me angry," she said, her expression tight. "But I'm going to tell you this again. You need to meet this man."
"It will be over before you know it," Harry said, studying Ron's face. "Just a few more minutes, and then you'll be married, and it will be brilliant. You'll see."
“F-fine,” he managed, his hands clamped like vises against the bottom of the chair to keep himself from squirming even more.
do it, just that your mind hasn’t fully accepted it’s possible.”
Draco frowned, studying the program an usher had given him on the way in. He'd expected Hermione would have insisted on writing their own vows, but it didn't look like they had. It seemed to be a pretty straight-forward ceremony, not many frills. He glanced at his watch, looking back at the door again. Pansy and Oliver had just come in, and he motioned them over. He doubted they'd be sitting together at the reception, but at least he didn't have to be alone for now.
agreed to that. I made no such promise," Draco corrected, pressing a kiss to Harry's slack lips.
Neville walked behind them, his smile brighter than anyone's.

And then he was gone. Draco let himself sit on the floor, not caring if the lightweight wool trousers he wore were ruined by the ash. His pulse was racing, and he could feel his hands tremble at his sides. His mind started screaming about how inadvisable, how foolish, this would be but he couldn't stop himself. It was just after 8 p.m. and Draco hurried from his study, intent on tucking Cal into bed before Harry came through.
"They wanted frog tongues instead, so that's what they got."
"Potter!" He bellowed, stalking toward the bedroom. He threw open the door, glaring at Harry, who was fastening the button on his denims.
"Maybe. He might just have nieces and nephews who are around a lot, or maybe he's interested in adopting a child down the road," Harry said. He had thought a lot about that requirement; in fact, he had very nearly included a similar one in his own post. He thought it would be strange, however, since he didn't have a child, so he left it off, figuring that there would be plenty of time in the getting-to-know-you process with any prospective partner for his desire to have a family to come up.
The man straightened, pulling the courage to address the Boy Who Lived from somewhere.
: IntrospectiveIntellectual
Harry nodded and withdrew his head from the fire as Hermione headed back to the kitchen to return the takeaway to its original containers. She shook her head with a good-natured grimace at the irony of it.
Blaise cleared his throat, nudging his shoulder against Draco's. The two men dropped their joined hands, their eyes wide with surprise and arousal.
Draco smoothed his robes, relieved his erection had finally waned. Blaise had found him about an hour ago, handing him a purple vial with a smirk. Draco downed it without a word, handing the empty vial back to his best man and stalking off to find his son. He hadn't been successful, but since Harry was missing as well, Draco assumed the two were off somewhere together and hadn't worried.
Harry tensed, his struggles stopping. Blaise was right. The old traditions had to be followed to the letter, or he could no longer hide behind the ancient law to shield them from the press. And after what Ron had just told him, they were going to need it more than ever.
"But he invoked –"
"Madam Atalier," he greeted, standing to bow formally to the middle-aged woman before skirting his desk to press a kiss to her outstretched hand. She and her husband owned several large apothecaries around Great Britain, and Malfoy Industries had been advising them on real estate purchases and business investments for years. "To what do I owe the pleasure?"
"And you still feel this poorly?" Draco asked, concerned. The potion should have taken care of any nausea or headache left over from last night.
Draco nodded. Everyone in school knew the man's entire memory had been wiped –
Draco's hand slipped over his stomach, sliding over well-defined abs and lightly tracing down the ridge of muscle just above his pelvis, his manicured fingers just barely ghosting over his throbbing erection. The humor in his expression was clear as he arched an eyebrow at Harry, his lips quirked as he held back the breathy moan that threatened to escape.
Draco glanced around his office, grateful the Aurors hadn't trashed the place in search of proof that he had embezzled money from the Atalier Family. All they'd find, of course, was proof that Draco had discovered the problem some months earlier and recently started monitoring the business' accounts. Bloody idiots. They'd just ensured their son would do time in Azkaban for embezzlement. Draco hadn't reported his findings to the Ministry, hoping the Ataliers would be able to resolve it without the help of the courts. Once charges had been filed though, there was no way to go back. Cato would be held accountable for his actions now that his parents had filed a formal complaint of embezzlement.
“Theo, you did it!” Hermione cried, clapping her hands in delight. The movement made her breasts bounce under her sheer shirt, and Theo groaned at the sight.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. They don't belong to me outside the confines of my overactive imagination.
A wave of disappointment so heavy it was almost palpable shot through him as he read the words on the screen – an apology from Sly, saying he'd be out of contact for a few days while out of the office on a business trip. Harry sighed, running a hand through his messy hair. He glanced from his laptop to the bottle of whisky, his eyes narrowed as he thought.
"Can I bring you anything, sweetie?" a waitress drawled, giving Draco what she no doubt considered her best come-hither look.
The warmth Draco had seen in Harry's green eyes vanished at the words, and he swallowed hard at the surprising depth of his disappointment at seeing the dark-haired man's shutters firmly back in place.
"A few more hours," Ron whispered in his ear, his gentle tone a startling contrast to the vice-like grip he had on Harry's arm.
"Those aren't your only options, you know. For having children, I mean," she said, slightly uncomfortable.
Ron grinned, launching into an explanation of the protective spells on the Pensieve and details about the intricate runes that covered most of the rim. Draco and Pansy were both suitably impressed by the story behind the ancient basin, awed by the history and the obvious power that emanated from it.
, Draco had threatened,
"I thought we agreed not to see each other the night before the wedding," he whispered, closing his eyes as Draco began to suck lightly on his neck.
Blaise nodded again, his mind racing. He needed to get to France. Cal needed to be secreted away at least until they knew what was happening. If Cartwell was working with someone else in the Ministry, they would have access to Draco's property holdings. They'd be able to find the chateau.
Draco's eyes widened as he realized what was happening. He couldn't believe they'd managed to hide this from him. He felt the hot prick of tears, swallowing hard to regain his composure. Harry's hand, warm and comforting, slid into his, giving him a gentle squeeze. He could feel his husband trying to calm him through their bond, and he was grateful. Without Harry's calming influence, he might embarrass himself in front of all their friends.
As soon as the door swung shut, Draco jumped up, taking the dormitory stairs two at a time. The party wasn’t scheduled to start for a few hours, and he knew Blaise had a contact in Ravenclaw who was almost as good at procuring alcohol as Theo. Maybe the party wouldn’t be a bust, after all.
"Listen, Cal, how about I bring Blaise when I come for lunch today? We'll have the house-elves pack us a picnic to take down to the vineyard."
"That was mean!"
, he thought, fighting it as hard as he could. He hadn't been living at the Manor recently.
Draco grabbed his wand, reinforcing the Silencing and Locking charms on his study door, and reassuring himself that he'd closed and locked the Floo. This wasn't something he wanted interrupted.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. I don't say I own them; you don't sue. Thanks go to Kamerreon for her awesomeness!
He paused, grinning when he saw the interest flare in Draco's grey eyes. "That is, if you're up for it."
Hermione whispered the traditional greeting for a newly married couple as she wrapped her arms around Harry in an exuberant hug. "May the blessings of Merlin be with you."
Pansy's shoulders relaxed at Ron's dismissive tone, relieved she hadn't wandered into some sort of epic battle between the two former rivals. She thrust the box at Draco, sighing in relief when he took her heavy burden.
Head of the House of Potter
"It's fairly obvious, isn't it?" Ron hissed, shooting a worried look toward the house. He didn't want Harry wandering out for any part of
"Draco?" Pansy's voice called from the fireplace, her disembodied green head peering around the room.
Hermione's gaze sharpened, and Harry knew he was in trouble.
"They're charging him with harassment and attempted murder," Harry said quietly, his voice shaking on the last word. Draco must love his son very much, he knew, to take the risk he did. Resisting Veritaserum was difficult, but it was possible, though the result was often death. "It sounds like he'd been trying to find a way to get Draco in for questioning for years. He was also behind the death threats Draco and Narcissa received a few years ago."
"You've got to stop testing these things on yourself," Harry chastised, his grin growing when George blushed even darker, his face and hair nearly indistinguishable.
Twenty minutes later, Kingsley stood in front of the same tall table they'd used for the promissory ceremony. Harry had dragged it into the study, thinking it would be best to minimize the amount of time the wizard spent in the house and limit his access to the room with the Floo. It seemed safest, just in case the bond didn't accept him as a non-threat. Kingsley's wife stood off to the side, looking both sad and excited for the man she considered a son and his bond mate.
He dashed down the stairs, headed for his study so he could make some Fire-calls. He felt a pang of guilt and regret as he noticed his laptop, still sitting open on his desk. What if he
"Nev said he refused to talk about it," Ginny whispered, pitching her voice low so they wouldn't be overheard. "And Pansy said Draco said the same thing."
Harry thought, every muscle in his body tensing at the contact. He'd been prepared for it, but it still took him by surprise. It felt so
"Afraid hearing the truth about you will send him running, eh?"
Harry wondered, turning his head again to study his reflection. He'd never noticed before, but his glamour did look a bit like the Slytherin git. Last he'd heard, Malfoy had been married, but apparently that had changed. He couldn't say he blamed the poor woman – being shackled to Malfoy for the rest of your life had to be a hellish proposition. Suddenly, the photos he'd seen of Malfoy with a host of other men in the pages of the
Five more seconds. It was getting harder to fight.
"All finished, Mr. Evans," the stylist chirped, blushing as he smiled and thanked her.
to make his life hell."
"Unmarried men and women aren't permitted to witness the signing of a marriage contract," he said simply, digging in his robes for a small book. He handed it to the curious witch. "Harry told me you'd have questions, so I took the liberty of having my assistant compile a copy of the relevant laws for you."
"I just thought he might," Harry said easily, returning his emerald gaze to his son. He was already dressed in his Hogwarts robes, too excited to wait until he got on the train to change. He had a small cage with a tawny brown owl, a large trunk filled with books he couldn't wait to study, and all the supplies he could possibly need.
No one knew if Harry and Draco planned to go public with their relationship when they married or not, so Kingsley had taken precautions to ensure their secret would be kept if that was what they desired. The ancient laws required the successful courtship and promissory bond be registered with the Ministry, but once the magic involved was satisfied that had happened it didn't prevent the destruction of the actual document afterward.
"Yes, but –"
"No," Blaise said, shivering slightly. "I'm fine."
I'm going to do my best to update over the next week, but it might be difficult. Things are just starting to get interesting between Harry and Draco, and I hate to leave you hanging, but the holidays are upon us, and that means truckloads of visiting relatives beating down Bru's door, all expecting a clean bed to sleep in, cookies and nicely wrapped presents!
Harry's mouth fell open at the statement, his eyes flashing with anger even as Draco reached out to grab his arm.
Harry squinted as he looked at the table in front of him, tilting his head as Hermione marked the chart with her wand. Her Aunt Betty would be uncomfortable sitting with the witches and wizards in attendance, she decided, tapping the parchment again. Her aunt's name appeared, joining the names of several other relatives at a table near the back of the room.
He focused his attention back on the screen where a young Hugh Grant was dashing, if not slightly ridiculous, in a large mustache and period clothing. Draco had no idea if that was really how Americans dressed before the Civil War, but it certainly worked on Hugh Grant.
Hermione's smile grew at Harry's indignant expression.
"Sorry?" Draco echoed, squeezing his eyes shut when Harry's hot lips skated over his exposed collarbone, pressing a trail of kisses across his firm chest and licking the defined valley between his pectorals.
Harry closed his hand into a fist, the only way he could stop the trembling he knew must be visible. When the blond had said his name, he'd felt – hell, he didn't know
Draco's voice was hoarse when he responded, his tone bitter. "He shouldn't have to worry about me. Even trying to do the right thing I manage to fuck it up."
"The Stevens deal is being finalized," Blaise said, amused by his friend's obvious distraction.
Draco felt panic ripple through him. Had the trick Ron and Blaise pulled with the Aurors not worked after all? Had someone come after Cal?
And if he was a little lonely, well, it was to be expected. It didn't mean he missed
They chatted on about wedding plans for awhile, and Draco gave Theo a few suggestions for Ron's stag party when the wizard rejoined them after clearing up in the kitchen. Draco and Cal didn't stay much longer, since he needed to get the young boy home and to bed.
The older wizard hurried over, his eyes widening when he recognized Harry. His bored expression was immediately replaced with one of keen interest.
"You wanted to see Cal?" Blaise asked.
Draco looked out over the sea of older students crammed into the Slytherin common room. The music was blaring – something Muggle was playing at the moment, but Draco didn’t mind because it had a great beat – and the alcohol was freely flowing. They’d set an age line at the door, so only seventh years, both classes of them, were present. The younger Slytherins had all been dispatched to their dorms, the older ones bribed with small amounts of alcohol and the younger ones with candy and other treats.
Blaise laughed, tickling him until he surrendered. Blaise pulled himself into a sitting position, settling Cal on his lap.
Harry released a breath he hadn't realized he was holding. He gave Hermione a lopsided grin, his cheeks pinking slightly in embarrassment.
The darkness of his hate for Voldemort. The guilty desire to give up his life, to stay in the comfort and quiet of the afterlife, instead of returning to the chaotic war that he knew still raged. The bone-numbing exhaustion, mental and physical, born of years of fighting that made it so appealing. The resentment he still felt at times for being forced to choose between saving the world and staying with those he'd loved and lost.
"Research for my next book," Harry said, studying the two Stupefied men on the floor. "I don't think it would have worked, though, without your spell."
Draco looked around the ballroom, searching for Weasley and Hermione. He couldn't find them on the dance floor, but he spotted an open door to the terrace. Figuring they must have stepped outside for a breath of fresh air, Draco made his way to the French doors, stepping outside quietly to give them his well-wishes so he could leave.
"Zach," Harry said, his green eyes cold as ice as he met the other man's gaze.
Draco had no idea where either man lived, but Theo did, so he took charge, calling out a destination that sounded vaguely familiar to the blond. When they stepped through the fireplace, he realized it must be the Black ancestral home. He'd been there once or twice as a child, but he remembered it being much darker and dirtier than it was now.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. Unfortunately, they aren't mine. *sniffs*
men. His eyes flicked to Harry involuntarily, noting that he seemed immune to the charms of the well-endowed witch as well.
"She signed away all her parental rights with the divorce," Draco said with a sigh. "I bought her silence with a hefty settlement, and she was free to pursue the life she'd thought she was getting when she married me. It's probably for the best."
, she thought with a smile as she squeezed his shoulder and stepped back, intending to leave the room so he could change.
"Listen up," he said, his voice still hard. "I could leave you to do this on your own, but it will likely take forever and the Minister is already waiting for you."
Draco didn't notice when everyone left, but Harry felt the tug of the wards announcing their departure. Without relinquishing his spot in Draco's tight embrace, or un-molding his lips from the blond's, Harry pointed his wand at the fireplace, warding it against any interruptions with a nonverbal spell.
Draco felt Harry's hand twitch in his own, and he clamped down on his urge to mold himself around the other wizard on the spot. Every molecule of air between them felt like an insult; he wanted nothing more than to insinuate himself into Harry's very being, joining their bodies as their magic had just joined.
He jerked to awareness when he heard the peculiar noise again, briefly thanking his war-honed reflexes for pulling him out of his alcohol-induced slumber to alert him to a problem. It had been years since he'd needed to wield his wand for protection, but the instinct was still there.
Draco nodded, returning to his task. He'd met Ginny and Theo's daughter a few days earlier when he visited them in the hospital. Draco grinned, remembering how silly he'd felt as he skulked around the corridors of the St. Mungo's nursery, hoping for a glimpse of Gryffin. He knew the man had a friend in labor there as well, and he'd hoped their paths might cross. Of course, he'd had no idea what Gryffin looked like, or if the man's friend had still been in the hospital, but he'd hoped nonetheless. He'd worried that perhaps
felt differently. Potter's mask was as seamless as his own. Draco was confident that no one – not even Pansy – would be able to see the tension in his shoulders or the carefully guarded panic in his eyes.
"Fu – sorry," Harry yelped, grimacing when Madam Malkin glared at him, cutting him off mid-curse.
Draco shook his head and he heard Neville huff out an angry breath behind him. None of their friends understood how Patrizia could just walk away and never look back, but Draco had come to view it as a blessing in disguise.
"The sparks were unusual, then?" He asked, his voice trembling slightly.
"What
She softened visibly at his gesture, the tight lines around her grim mouth disappearing as she smiled girlishly at him.
"And it's a bit hard to attract a fit-looking wizard when you're knee-deep in witches, I suppose," she said with a laugh.
"No," Draco said quickly, following Harry's gaze. "Later. After," he said, hoping Harry knew what he meant. He had a feeling both he and Harry would need some comfort after he viewed the memories. He didn't want to do it before they were able to find solace in each other's arms. If they waited until Thursday they'd be able to touch, even if they couldn't consummate their relationship until after the contract was signed.

"Er, hi?" Draco answered, dusting the hearth with his hand before kneeling. "Did you need something?"
"Morning," Blaise said, breezing in without so much as a knock. Draco scowled at him, but the other wizard just shrugged, snagging a scone from the tray. "Thought you'd want an update before our morning meeting with the Ataliers."
Harry watched the smile play across her face as she read Sly's words, knowing she'd reached the part hoping for a face-to-face meeting.
He groaned, stretching as his body relaxed into the soft comfort of his bed. Caleum was a restless sleeper, but Draco hadn't been able to refuse when he'd asked him to stay with him the last few nights. He was away so often, it was hard for him to deny Cal anything when they were together.
"Leave it," Harry hissed, not taking his eyes off Cartwell. "See to the other one. Find out who he is, who else knows."
Draco's eyes sparkled as he raised his wand to Harry's hand, resting it on his ring finger.
"Yeah," he answered, sliding off the stool and pressing a kiss to Hermione's cheek as Tom led them to a booth in the back. After all, the sooner they finished their meal, the sooner he could check his email.
"Harry, that can't be –"
: Yes, yes, scream all you want. But it was a good place to end it. *covers ears at all the boos and hisses*
Harry balked, but she held up her hand, stopping his protest.

"Ginny. Ron."
“I have an idea that might help,” she murmured, and Theo swallowed at the husky quality her voice had taken on.
“– if you just adjust your grip like this,” Hermione said, her fingers wrapped around Theo’s, changing the way he held the base of his wand, “you’ll get much better results.”
"Draco," he groaned.
Draco watched the Gryffindor puzzling over his words, biting the inside of his cheek to keep his laughter in check. He finally felt like he had the upper hand in a conversation with Potter, which made him much more confident and at ease. After all, he wouldn't be seeing the man again. Why not have some fun?
"Thank you," he whispered, his voice thick with unshed tears. Ron had done something highly illegal to keep Cal safe. "Thank you."
"Well, it was best you found out on your own," she said, trying for a disaffected shrug. The movement was mostly lost in the green flames.
Harry sighed, throwing back the damp and sticky bedclothes and heaving himself out of bed. Cleaning Charms worked perfectly well, but this was the second time tonight he'd woken up in a pool of his own sweat and come. It was getting ridiculous.
Potter had been the consummate gentleman all evening, laughing and mingling as though there was no other place he'd rather be. But Draco knew differently – or rather, he knew
He should have gone more than an hour ago, when most of the older family members had taken their leave. It was late, and he could easily have slipped away without causing a stir. But he stayed, dancing with those who asked and politely chatting with people he hadn't seen in years. All because he wanted to watch Potter.
– Draco was sure the temptation to sell Caleum's identity and his relation to Draco would have been too much to ignore for him.
George opened his mouth but closed it before he could speak obviously deciding he was better off not responding.
Harry glowered at the group, a sour expression on his face. Fun. Right.
"Yes, that's true," he answered, his eyes sparkling as he looked at the woman currently carrying Draco's child.
Oliver shook his head, his eyes serious as he answered her snide question.
Blaise hesitated, then entered the room. Draco needed someone to tell him the hard truths, and it looked like it was up to him.
on similar attempts by Pansy and Neville, and he knew his effort would meet no different end.
hurt.
His body tensed as pieces started falling into place – his thoughts of Sly and his childhood Crup had somehow led Harry straight to the answers he needed to finish his book. Coffee forgotten, Harry dashed back to his laptop and began typing furiously, grinning as he immortalized Sly's Crup in the pages of the latest James Evans novel.
eleven yet," Harry said, shifting Cari to his other arm when she began to kick, begging to be let down.
"Maybe not totally alone," she said, smiling sadly at them. "I've already spoken with Kingsley. We think if he's there in his capacity as Minister your bond will allow it."
"What are you looking for?" Blaise asked, his lips quirking in amusement as Draco shot around the room, moving cushions and looking under furniture.
Two rambunctious boys, one with black hair, the other with pink, were hopping around the hallway. Literally hopping, since their legs seemed to have been turned into frog legs.
"To get away from the press here in England."

"George," Harry said absently, typing furiously as he finished his thought. He had a deadline at the end of the week, and he was struggling to meet it.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. They aren't mine.
Neville thought brusquely, his mood dark.
"Wait," Seamus said, thumbing through the pages in the small notebook. "He said one other thing. Made even less sense than everything else. I'm a bit worried about him, to be honest. He said: Tell Draco he's amazing, and I'll do what I need to do to keep him safe."
Draco nodded, swallowing past the lump in his throat at the thought of more years without his son. He just wasn't prepared to bring Cal out into the open, though, and it was too difficult for him to live in France. He had responsibilities here in England – to the Malfoy name, to the companies he owned, to the people who worked for him, even to Cal, who would reap the benefits of Draco's careful management of the family name and money when he came of age.
Draco and Blaise walked down the short aisle, stopping when they reached the bank of floor-to-ceiling windows at the far end of the main ballroom. Narcissa and Daphne had completely transformed the room. The trees outside the large windows had been covered in fairy lights, which twinkled beautifully against the dark night. Inside, large potted evergreen trees guarded each corner, decorated tastefully with soft lights and flowing ice blue and silver ribbons.
"Can you do this?" He asked Draco, his voice low.
and saw some new speculation about an affair she was supposedly having, or how Oliver was gay and had only married her because he needed to produce an heir.
"Most men would have been happy to have a dozen good-looking witches hanging off their arm, Harry," Hermione said with a barely suppressed grin.
"No?" Ron asked, his voice distraught.
Luna nodded serenely, making a note on her legal pad. He was sure it was either a doodle of one of her mythical creatures or a reminder to pick something up at the market – after all, she already
Draco looked at his watch, groaning. It was nearly 9 a.m. He rubbed a hand briskly over his face, debating taking a short nap before his noon appointment at the office. He tried to visualize the work waiting for him, wondering if any of the correspondence was important enough that it couldn't wait a few more hours. And that didn't even take into consideration all the emails he'd have. Draco jolted to full wakefulness with a start. Emails. Gryffin. Mother of Merlin, he hadn't told Gryffin his trip had been extended. What must the other man be thinking? Draco nearly kicked himself. Things had been going so well, but he hadn't even given the other man a thought while he had been in France tending to Caleum.
A safe enough answer, but not enough. He knew it wouldn't be enough, but he kept fighting it.
Cal craned his neck, looking around the small grotto. His eyes traveled over the table and chairs, the magical fire, spelled to be smokeless, and his Uncle Neville, who was just barely visible in the distance at the mouth of the cave.
Draco had put off checking his online dating e-mail account all morning. He knew if the mystery man had responded, he'd spend the day obsessing about how to answer the e-mail. If he hadn't responded, then he'd spend the day obsessing over why he hadn't answered yet. His schedule was too full for that sort of nonsense, so he'd avoided it altogether.
He turned it over, braced for the unimaginable. Or the very imaginable, if his dreams were anything to go by. Harry opened his mouth to defend himself, but closed it abruptly, brought up short by the photo.
“Oh my,” she said, afraid she’d offended him. Her own lack of skill with Transfiguration was legendary, but she’d never meant to imply he couldn’t do it. She’d actually been trying to give him a pep talk.
“Soda?”
Draco gave him an easy shrug, smiling slightly. "I wouldn't know. I run Malfoy Industries. Keeps me pretty busy."
"Are you sure you don't want to add candlelight dinners and long walks on the beach?" Hermione asked, waggling her brows suggestively at Harry.
Draco was struck with a perplexing sensation of guilt at Potter's words, feeling ashamed that he retained membership in a society the other man so clearly disdained. Which was ridiculous, he reasoned, because he himself never went to the club, disliking it as much as Potter obviously did. Wedgewick blathered on about the society, seemingly oblivious to the dark-haired wizard's tight expression.
Harry chuckled, and he heard Draco's rumbling laugh next to him.
Draco bit his lip, wondering if he should ask Harry what his intentions toward Caleum were. He passed over it, deciding it could wait until after the marriage contract was signed. He'd prefer it if Harry adopted Cal outright, but it wouldn't be the end of the world if he didn't. He knew Harry would likely want to have at least one child of his own, preferably two, to carry on the Potter and Black names. Harry was great with Cal, and Draco didn't doubt he'd show the boy as much love as he did any biological children he might have, even if he didn't legally adopt him.
Harry could feel it immediately – an almost physical ache inside him that demanded contact with Draco. Their joined hands were no longer enough and he whimpered when he felt pulled toward the blond as though they were magnets. The urge was nearly too strong to fight. Their magical cores were now bound and reaching out to each other, seeking to reunite with the familiar magical signature of the other.
Draco laughed, watching as Harry peeled his tight T-shirt off and flung it at Ron.
to see again, since it represented a wholly different life than the one he lived now.
, he'd begun his courtship in earnest. He intended to pursue Draco the proper pure-blood way, and he wasn't willing to skip any of the steps, even though it prolonged the wait before they could actually meet up in person.
"He's fabulous," she said, sneaking a piece of fennel from Draco's cutting board. He made quite the elegant figure, standing in her kitchen chopping vegetables.
Though they hadn't spoken about it, he knew Draco was following the stories obsessively. Oliver had Fire-called a few nights ago after having a few drinks at the Manor, promising that he'd managed to convince Draco that nothing was going on between him and Harry. Neville pushed back from the table, ready to head out to the greenhouse for a bit. Draco had finally agreed to take the magnolia trees out of Stasis, and he needed to check up on them to make sure they were suffering no ill effects.
He slid a finger under the cock ring, releasing the clasp. Instantly, the sensation of Gryffin's rough palm against his rock hard cock disappeared. Draco moaned, fisting himself, his hand flying as he quickly sent himself over the edge, Gryffin's name on his lips as he came for what seemed like an eternity.
"Oh, you'll be sorry," she hissed, grabbing the newspaper from the desk and storming upstairs. "You'll both be
Blaise's mouth tightened, but he didn't rush to reassure his friend. They both knew Draco's worries were valid; many people harbored distrust or even outright hatred toward him, despite the fact that he'd been cleared of any wrongdoing after the war.
"Yeah."
Draco held back a gasp, the white-hot thrill he felt ripple through him bore no resemblance to the mere tingle he'd felt when he'd first touched Patrizia after their courtship ended. But that had been an arranged marriage, and one he wasn't overly interested in to boot. This, though – this was
was administering their oath and overseeing the contract? He looked at Harry, shaking his head. Of course he was. It
Kingsley turned to Draco, resting his wand over his heart.
"You really seem to like him, Harry. You should come clean about who you are," Hermione said, tapping her quill against the parchment she was poring over absentmindedly. She was in the middle of a tense contract negotiation with one of her other authors, and Harry doubted she was really that engaged in their conversation.
"I love –" he bit his tongue, his teeth sinking into the soft flesh. The shooting pain was a welcome relief from the torment in his skull, giving him something new to concentrate on. He could feel the effects of the Veritaserum beginning to wane.
"What Harry's not telling you is that he's not really that out of place in this family," Draco smirked, laughing when Neville's eyes widened. "Didn't he ever tell you the story about the Sorting Hat…?"
"So, boss, any news?"
"I brought Ron because the bond will accept that we are not a threat since we are married," she said, receiving a tight smile and nod from Draco. "We still won't stay long. If what I've read is true, you two are physically uncomfortable in the presence of others, yes?"
"It all makes sense now, of course," Draco continued, seemingly unaware he was still speaking, the words falling from his lips in a rush. "James Evans writes about foolishly heroic Aurors, and Potter is a foolishly heroic idiot, always rushing into things and risking his neck for people he barely knows."
"You look beautiful," Ginny said, pressing a careful kiss to Hermione's cheek, taking care not to smudge their make-up.
Draco laughed humorlessly, and Blaise bit his tongue to refrain from pointing out that Cal's stubbornness was definitely an inherited trait.
?" he asked, incredulous. He only knew of one Draco.
"A simple ceremony with Kingsley, then," Draco said, his voice rough. "We can re-take our vows in front of all our friends and family at a later time."
Of course, he knew it was ridiculous. Oliver was straight, and married to Pansy to boot. There was no chance he would – like Skeeter had gleefully written – use his status as the Puddlemere Keeper to seduce Harry Potter. He'd managed to hold off on Fire-calling Pansy for more than 24 hours, finally breaking down when he saw the latest tripe the
"I see some things haven't changed since school, Mr. Potter," a horribly familiar voice drawled, causing Harry to yelp and scramble for cover. His lethargy forgotten, he pulled a pillow off the sofa, using it to shield his nakedness as best he could.
"The club?" Harry asked, and Draco nearly bit his tongue to hold back his retort. Potter wouldn't like this – hell,
"We were both
Ron nodded, releasing her reluctantly as the song ended and Fleur materialized, ready to take Ginny's place.
"There's a chapter on promissory bonds in there," she continued, still eyeing the couple warily.
Draco let out an exasperated sigh when Harry's breath against his ear made his cock twitch. Though he didn't voice it, he was hoping the same thing Harry was – they definitely weren't fit to be around other people at the moment, and he'd really like to see Cal soon.
"Hey, Cal! What's this I hear about lunch?" he asked, watching as Caleum's grin returned.
Harry reached over at the same moment, their hands brushing. Harry's breath caught in his chest as Draco's palm slid against his, the silky smooth skin making the Quidditch callus below the blond's index finger even more noticeable.
"My name is Harry Potter," he said quietly, holding his hand out.
"Think it'll be alright?"
The younger Auror nodded, hurrying from the room. Like most of their team, he was afraid of their supervisor. Personally, he agreed with Ron – it was obvious that Malfoy wasn't involved. Everyone knew the man hated the Malfoys for the part they played in the war, and it was clear he was using this opportunity to extract some revenge against Draco.
"Not common, but it happens," Oliver said, his arm still around his wife. "Pans and I felt a tingle, but nothing everyone else could see."
Harry snorted, rolling his eyes. The expression in the mirror looked vaguely familiar, though he couldn't figure out why. He usually avoided catching a glimpse of his alter ego while wearing the glamour – it was disconcerting to see himself wearing a different face.
"Did Hermione get the flowers I sent?" Draco asked, lowering the paper.
Blaise dug in his robes, tossing a nondescript wrapped package to Draco. "For you."
. Harry's heart stuttered at the thought, his gaze locked on the little boy still caged in the protective embrace of Blaise's arms. He was obviously terrified, but he stood straight and proud, his thin shoulders squared. Wide grey eyes returned Harry's stare, aristocratic features set into a look of grim determination no child so young should ever be forced to wear. The slight tremble of his lower lip was the only thing that belied his fear, and Harry saw so much of Draco in his expression and bearing that it almost hurt to look at him.
Ron colored, embarrassed that his words had been so misconstrued.
"What–"
"Christ!" Harry gasped, sitting up suddenly. He shivered in the cool night air, slightly disgusted to find himself bathed in a cold sweat and – he lifted the covers, his lip curling in distaste – cooling come.
His fingers traced the outline of his own features, but feeling Draco's. The blond let his head fall back, his eyes tightly shut at the sensation of Harry's callused hand cupping his chin, his thumb ever-so-gentle as it stroked Draco's cheekbone.
Draco nodded woodenly, watching as memory Harry grabbed a house-elf and disappeared. He cringed as he remembered what happened next – what Harry didn't know. The horrendous torture they'd all suffered for letting Harry Potter escape.
Draco kept his face cool and remote as he watched the proceedings, admiring the way Potter's hair fell in softly mussed waves. It was much the same as it had been in school, but somehow the mop of unruly black strands looked different on the lean, muscled, attractive man Potter had become. Gone were the ill-fitted clothes Draco remembered, replaced by carefully tailored wizard's robes that likely cost more than most people made in a week. His bulky black glasses had been replaced by thin wire frames, which served to accentuate his startlingly green eyes and the sculpted planes of his lightly tanned face.
He needed his wits about him if he was going to find out what he'd done the night before.
"Luna, I don't know what to say. She's –"
"He – I – we – I can explain –" Harry stammered, reaching a shaky hand out for the paper to see exactly
," he enunciated clearly, shooting Hermione a grin, "in the Chamber of Secrets," he paused again, drawing it out even more, "with the Sword of Gryffindor."
Harry shook his head, ducking out of the restaurant and into a nearby alley. Ron followed, casting a quick Notice-Me-Not charm so they could talk without fear of interruption.
"He- he did?" she stammered, shocked at how calmly Draco was relaying the news that he'd been corresponding with the Boy Who Lived for months.
She brushed away Ron's question, her eyes narrowing as she plotted. She looked up at Teddy, her face a mask of concentration. It was probably wrong to put so much effort into beating a 10-year-old, but he'd won the past two games.
He shook his head ruefully, standing and starting to clear the table. The china Sly had provided was rimmed in platinum. He ran a finger around the edge of the plate, wishing he was touching Sly instead.
Harry let Ron take point, following close behind as they crept toward the entryway. He fervently hoped Narcissa had followed their instructions and remained inside the small, warded cottage in the vineyard with Daphne.
"Are you playing messenger now?" Draco teased, restraining himself from tearing into it immediately. He didn't want news that he was over-eager reaching Harry. He had to preserve his advantage, after all.
"However did you avoid Ravenclaw with awesome powers of deduction like yours?" She snapped, grabbing Draco's sandwich from the desk and taking a bite. She was missing lunch to run this errand for Harry.
He looked over at his laptop screen, impatient for a response from Gryffin. After spending a considerable portion of his evening obsessing over Harry Potter, he really wanted the easy comfort of talking to the man. Gryffin was funny and laid back, nothing like uptight and judgmental Potter, he thought with a curl of his lip.
“N.E.W.T.s aren’t for months,” Draco said, shrugging easily. “One night of fun won’t hurt you. It may even do you some good. Studies show that –”
Harry took a breath, determined not to ruin the reception for his best friends. He felt a genuine smile steal across his face as he watched Ron wrap his arms around Hermione, obviously taking great care not to muss her dress as they began to awkwardly move around the dance floor. He cast a surreptitious Shield charm on Hermione's dainty shoes after he saw her wince when Ron stepped on her foot, drawing a laugh and grateful smile from both of them.
Harry squeezed Draco's arm reassuringly before pushing the door open. He didn't flinch when a huge three-headed dog began to bark.
Draco had spent years playing the part of a devoted husband, but none of it had been true. He didn't intend to play the same role with Harry – he loved him too much to pretend. He would hurt Harry's feelings. He would forget anniversaries. He would interrupt romantic dinners to deal with business, he would go days on end without telling Harry he loved him. Of those things he was certain. It was in his nature to take things for granted, to overlook the importance of daily affirmations and whispered affections. But he also knew he would cherish every moment they spent together and love Harry more than he had ever loved anyone in his life, save Cal.
"Are you alright with that, mate?" Ron piped up, his gaze questioning.
"Until my eleventh birthday," Harry murmured, and he could tell from his expression that Draco was imagining Cal living in conditions like those.
Draco tapped his wand on the Malfoy Seal, smiling when it glowed a vibrant green, darker than Harry's Black Seal had. The Malfoy Line was undiluted – Slytherins since the inception of Hogwarts. Not like the Black Line, with Harry's Gryffindor godfather.
"I know Harry and Draco are corresponding through your dating site," he said, settling back on the cushions. "And I know you've sworn a vow to both of them, so I won't press you for more answers than you can give me."
"I don't think he'd mind missing out, though. Not a big red wine drinker, that one."
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. Not mine. Thanks again to the fabulous Kamerreon for her beta skills!
"I have no words for what you've done for us," Draco said softly, and Harry could feel his frustration at not being able to thank the woman properly through their bond. He sent back a pulse of love and excitement, hoping to calm his husband. "This is more than I would ever have asked of anyone. Thank you."
"The Wizards' Council – I'm sure you know that preceded the Ministry, yes?" Hermione nodded and Neville continued. "Well, the Wizards' Council intervened on behalf of the Ravenclaw Family's interests. The girl was imprisoned so they could no longer court, and arrangements were made to force Durward into a marriage with a more suitable match."
"That's what Pepper-up Potion is for, Potter," he growled, pulling the other man fully under the spray and devouring his wet mouth.
His heart was pounding in his chest, his body already slick with exertion though he'd yet to even enter Harry. Draco carefully positioned himself at Harry's entrance, teasing the loosened hole with the head of his cock before slowly - excruciatingly and punishingly slowly- easing it inside and past the ring of muscle that immediately tensed at his intrusion. He held his position, not even daring to breathe, until he felt Harry relax around him, gently, carefully, reverently pushing deeper until he was fully seated.
she was pregnant with their next child. She had no reason to be scribbling furiously like all the others.
"No, wait," Draco said, holding up a hand when he saw Ron's discomfort. "Don't answer that. I'm betting tomorrow's gift will explain it. That git's too Slytherin for his own good."
is going to stop the
"We've had some good talks. He's right for you, Draco, I just know it. He loves you, and you've fallen in love with him, too," Blaise said, his voice low.
Harry shot Ron a lopsided grin.
Harry swallowed, the headache he'd beaten back with a Pain Relieving Draught earlier blooming behind his eyes.
"Do you think the waitress could get me some butterscotch sauce, Harry?" she asked as she scooped the first chip into her mouth.
what he’d been telling her for the last twenty minutes?
Hermione calculated dates in her head, trying not to panic when thoughts of her impending wedding – and the giant list of things she had to do to prepare for it – popped into her head.
, Skeeter, write anything else?"
, he thought fondly, grabbing her and kissing her exuberantly on the cheek when she'd finished her spell.
Blaise squinted as he studied Draco's clothing, deciding he was presentable enough. He knew the meticulous blond would never forgive him if he let him walk into Harry's surprise date looking disheveled.
He knelt down next to Harry, wrapping his arms around both his husband and his son. He was happier than he'd ever been before, and they hadn't even exchanged their renewal vows yet.
No, not what he was trying to convey.
. It was lovemaking, pure and simple, Harry thought with a satisfied grin that was quickly lost in another of Draco's intoxicating kisses.
Harry smiled wistfully. Sly had included a note in the basket – which, in addition to the food, had also included a full table service for four, complete with silver candlesticks, tapers and a bouquet of gorgeous magnolia blossoms.
Draco had made good on his promise to fuck Harry, and the dark-haired man had returned the favor a bit later during their shower. He fervently hoped their uncontrollable urges would calm soon, since he didn't know how much more he could take. He was edging toward thirty, and at the moment, he felt every one of his twenty-eight years.
"Had to be something we wouldn't say by accident," Blaise laughed, wrapping his arms tighter around Cal before activating the necklace his godson still wore.
Harry watched him through heavily lidded eyes, a strong wave of lethargy sweeping over him as he came down from his climax. He collapsed against the sofa, his hand still wrapped around his spent cock as he watched Draco recover.
Harry laughed, rolling his eyes. He felt guilty that they'd cut their honeymoon short on his behalf, but he couldn't deny he was happy to see them.
Draco swallowed, sending up a silent plea to Merlin that his divorce had been properly handled.
The darker wizard paced the room ignoring the slightly amused smirk Draco shot him. He'd been trying to convince the man that there was nothing going on between Potter and Smith for days now, and he hadn't made any progress.
"Listen you –"
: Three gifts down, eleven to go! Let me know if the explanations of the courtship rituals or
Harry nodded. He could feel the bond buzzing in the back of his mind, and his magic was agitated. Despite that, he still felt no threat from them.
"A bit rocky, just now, but I think everything is back on track," he said absently, a fond smile on his face as he studied the bottle. "He told me who he was last night, and I didn't react well, I'm afraid."
He gathered up his own papers, stuffing everything neatly back into his satchel as the board voted, the majority agreeing to allow Weasley his signs. Draco still didn't know why Potter was there – he knew he was a friend of the family, Ginny talked of him as though he were a brother, but he'd been unaware the man had a stake in the business.
Green eyes studied Neville wordlessly as Harry waited for Draco's reaction. He hadn't included a note of any kind, assuming anything he could say wouldn't have been enough to answer the myriad of questions he was sure Draco would have as soon as he recovered from the shock of seeing his old wand.
"Steak, with a creamy polenta, I think. It's a spicy, full-bodied wine," Draco said, distracted.
George nodded, stepping into the Floo in Harry's study and disappearing in a whoosh of green flame. His audience gone, Harry allowed himself to dissolve into giggles, laughing madly at the thought of George's modified cock ring causing his member to harden at the slightest touch, even after it had been removed. He was sure the poor man was practically in agony, but it was still amusing. And George
"Really, Harry. Internet dating?"
Cal rolled his eyes, looking so much like his father in that moment that a startled laugh slipped past Harry's lips.
Draco couldn't explain it, but something intangible had passed between himself and Potter when he'd offered his hand. Draco blushed slightly when he noticed he was still gripping Potter's palm, realizing they'd been touching for more than a socially acceptable amount of time for a casual handshake. He withdrew his hand, fighting the urge to stare dumbly at it when the warmth of Potter's hand was gone.
"Of course you are," Theo said, rolling his eyes. "Perfectly fine. The Healers routinely keep people in the hospital for two nights when nothing's wrong with them."
"Not yet, unfortunately. He may have to sit out the beginning of the next season as well. He's devastated, of course, but it looks like Gin might take the opportunity to extend her leave. She's absolutely in love with Freddie, and I think it'll be hard for her to go back to work when the time comes."
The pain in his skull was sickening, like waves of acid lapping against his brain.
said –"
Harry just continued to beam, the calculating gleam in his eye making everyone more than a little uncomfortable. "Oh, I am."
Blaise grabbed Draco by the shoulders, ducking his head slightly so they were eye-to-eye. Draco had filled him in on the messy business of Gryffin actually being Harry Potter the day after the wedding. It had taken Blaise a bit to wrap his mind around it, but now he was positive Potter would be perfect for the blond. He just had to get Draco to see it, too.
Draco squeezed their joined fingers, his throat dry as he answered. "I do hereby swear a Wizard's Oath that I intend to marry Harry Potter."
He reached out, taking the heavy bottle of red wine from the fire. Draco turned the bottle, his grin growing when he recognized the label. It was a bottle of Pécharmant, a red wine produced in southwestern France.
"Did your
The reporters went wild again, shouting questions at the small family. Hermione lifted her wand, blanketing the crowd with a strong Silencing Spell.
Draco let himself fall backward into the chair behind him, grateful that he no longer had to hold himself upright. His legs were trembling and his breath was still coming in gasps. His heart hammered hard in his chest, his muscles sore.
He muttered a Lubrication spell – one of the only wandless spells he'd mastered – on his own fingers, giving Harry no warning as he pressed them into himself. Harry's startled moan made Draco smirk in satisfaction, and he sped up his strokes, knowing the other man had to be close.
This was not the time or place for this conversation, she knew. Harry might come looking for them at any moment, and this wasn't a revelation she wanted him to have less than twenty-four hours before he was meant to stand up for her brother at his wedding. Nor did Ginny want Ron to combust at his own rehearsal dinner. It would take both men considerably more than a day to cool down after they found out Sly's identity, and she cringed at the thought of the revelation ruining the wedding.
? So he'd lost a good pen pal – so what? Because really, had Sly been anything more than just that – someone to casually email back and forth with?
"I told you I'd let you know if anything changed, Gin," he said, grabbing a cold bottle of Butterbeer from the kitchen and collapsing in his favorite chair.
!" Draco shouted, his outrage covering the gasp that had escaped his lips when he felt Harry's hand caress his balls.
"Is something you two need to discuss, yes," Blaise said, his heart slamming against his chest as he studied Harry's reaction. Would he still want to be with Draco now that he knew about Cal? Would he help them protect the boy? Would Harry Potter's involvement make things better or worse? "Later. Two more days."
"That subject?" she echoed, not following Draco's line of thought.
"Everything going well, then?" Harry asked when Ron returned with a small pot of butterscotch, averting his eyes as Ginny poured the lot of it over her vinegar-soaked chips. Her small moan of pleasure at the taste of the combination had him gagging silently.
It was almost electric. Harry literally felt like his hand was on fire when his palm grazed Draco's, his magic flaring and gliding along the other wizard's. Despite the shock, it wasn't an unpleasant feeling.
Ginny hesitated, her expression worried.
Harry ducked and rolled, the curse missing him by mere centimeters. He felt a gash open up on his back from a piece of flying wood from the chair he'd taken cover behind, his pulse racing.
Ron nodded, his stance mirroring Harry's. He cast a nonverbal Silencing Spell on their shoes, ensuring they'd be able to move through the chateau quietly. No footfalls were audible in the other room, either, which meant it was likely another Auror who'd had the same training as Ron.
"As most of you probably know, my son began his first year at Hogwarts yesterday," Harry said, pausing until the wave of shouting died down. "Questions at the end. My son, Caleum Potter-Black, was Sorted into Slytherin with nine other students. His father and I were pleased, especially since it means his older cousin, a Slytherin prefect, can watch out for him."
: MustLoveQuidditch
"No," he said, exhausted from nearly a week spent as the go-between in the middle of the great Malfoy-Potter feud.
: The courtship continues in the next chapter. Darn those rules about touching! *grins* No worries, though. They'll find a way around it …
Draco felt like an iron fist was squeezing his heart. His son had been refusing to leave his side for days, and he'd assumed it was because he was adjusting to having him back fulltime. He'd never even considered that Cal thought he was taking care of
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. I don't own 'em, I just play with them from time to time.
He stepped forward, running his hands up the side of her thin blouse. She shivered as his warm palms grazed her skin, turning toward him so he could kiss her deeply.
"He's doing very well. He has a business deal going in Diagon Alley, actually. He's partnering up with Draco Malfoy to develop a nightclub," she said.
"Go on, then," she said, her smile breaking through the solemn look she'd tried to force.
"I wasn't taking any chances of you or your parents saying no," he murmured, prompting more laughter from Pansy.
Harry made a vague sound that could have been agreement or protest, but Draco was too far gone to care. He jumped when he felt a hand on his arse, tensing when a well-lubed finger circled his entrance.
Harry stood at a podium outside Grimmauld Place, his vision spotted from the myriad of bright flashes in front of him. He'd avoided public functions – as Harry Potter, at any rate – for five years, and the wizarding press was absolutely desperate for new photos of him.
, Harry thought, his chest constricting. His manuscript. Malfoy knew he was James Evans.
"How?" Draco whispered, caressing the worn wood with his thumb as he held it in his grip.
Harry dove again, tucking himself into a ball to make himself as small a target as possible. He took aim, casting the first curse that came to mind.
"– before I started, er, corresponding with Sly."
Harry looked up, rubbing a hand over his face. He knew the glamour would cover it, but he was exhausted. He hadn't fallen into bed until after 6 a.m., which left him less than two hours to sleep before he needed to wake for his 9 a.m. meeting. He looked at the long conference table, scattered with soggy boxes of half-eaten, empty coffee cups and discarded parchment. They'd been at it all day.
"Do you want to do this here or somewhere else?" Blaise asked, gesturing with the stone basin in his arms.
He hadn't realized how much he had been looking forward to bringing the man into Cal's life until that moment. Feeling like a voyeur, Draco stole further back into the shadows, not yet ready to turn his back on the beautiful sight of a completely relaxed Harry Potter holding a sleeping child, his eyes glinting in the soft moonlight, his hair ruffling slightly in the summer breeze. Draco had no problem at all imagining a similar scene, with Potter holding Caleum in his arms.
Draco held the door for an older witch, smiling and bowing politely as she passed. He'd popped by his favorite restaurant to meet Blaise for lunch. He had something important to discuss with him, and he'd wanted to do it away from the distractions at the office.
He felt Draco relax against him at the same time the Floo came to life. He could have cursed George's poor timing. He nearly dropped Draco, who was leaning heavily against him, when he heard Hermione's voice from the study instead of the one he was expecting.
"A formality," Ron said, rolling his eyes and making it clear that he considered the whole exercise to be a farce.
"Did you see Nev, then?"
"What?" She asked, swallowing a sticky mouthful of peanut butter. "I'm pregnant. The baby doesn't care what's going on in there," she said, cocking her head toward the study. "She's hungry."
"It's a big risk, mate," Ron said, eying the package Harry was wrapping warily.
Hermione immediately softened when she saw his expression. He really was hopeless, she decided.
"He went because George couldn't," she said, shocked when Draco nodded lamely.
It hadn't felt like walking away to Harry, though. It had felt like walking into a new beginning, one where he could do whatever he wanted and be judged on the merit of his work instead of the scar on his forehead. And so James Evans was born, along with a crack team of fictional Aurors who solved wickedly complicated crimes in 300 pages or less.
Harry whimpered when Draco's talented mouth began to move in tandem with his fingers. Up, down. In, out. Oh, Merlin, now he was swirling his tongue over the head of Harry's swollen cock, his fingers mimicking the sweeping motion inside him, brushing over the sensitive spot that never failed to make Harry howl.
"It's not. It used to be a way to solidify a wizard's intention to court, but now it's a way to prove your esteem before the actual dating begins. No marriage contracts these days, not even arranged marriages, are forced."
, it would have been
he's been seeing online?"
, is that more to your liking, Caleum?" Cal nodded, his arms crossed tightly over his chest. "Were telling me of their plans to –"
Draco felt Harry relax underneath him, reveling in the corresponding hot feeling of satisfaction sweeping through his own body, knowing his lover wanted him any way he could get him. He didn't put much stock in traditional romance, and he doubted he ever would. Oh, he realized Harry would need him to trot out the traditional trappings every so often – pretty words and unexpected gestures – but he also knew in that moment that Harry would accept him for who he was, as well as who he wasn't.
"Hey mate," Ron said, slapping Harry on the back and drawing him out of his reverie. "Dinner, yeah?"
"Just going out to grab a coffee," he said, winking at her as he passed.
, for Merlin's sake. They had two more weeks left here, and she was going to enjoy it, even if she had tocast the Imperius Curse on her husband to make him more attentive.
Harry let his gaze rake over Draco, paying special attention to the man's crotch.
. He'd been ridiculously attracted to the bastard when they'd run into each other at the meeting, and every time he'd seen him since. Harry knew if he was being honest, he'd have to admit the tingles he'd felt the night before when Malfoy entered the bar hadn't been entirely born of anger or frustration.
," he said, wincing as the icy sensation served its intended purpose.
"Really excellent work, Harry, truly," she said, kissing his cheek and taking the disc. "I'll Fire-call you tomorrow after I meet with your editor."
"Maybe not even then."

Oliver laughed dryly, tossing back his Firewhisky in one gulp. "I can just imagine the headlines tomorrow. 'Malfoy revealed as party of Wood's secret harem – Potter crushed'," he said, shaking his head. "Pans stayed home. She just wasn't up to going out. Those idiots have taken to ringing the bloody bell at all hours of the night, hoping to get one of us to open the door."
, he thought, wondering why it had taken the ear-splitting bass so long to affect him. Harry motioned for a waitress, grabbing two shot glasses filled with neon green liquid from her tray and plunking a Galleon down in their place. He downed both without hesitation, not even tasting the sickly sweet alcohol as he tossed it back.

been reasonably sure the effects would wane within a few hours.
Neville paused, trying to read Draco's mood. He didn't know if he should apologize for keeping the secret or ask how the blond was coping with the news. Draco's carefully neutral expression didn't help.
"So you'll be over here," she said, tapping her wand to a table near the side of the room. She knew Harry hated sitting with his back exposed, so placing him near the wall made sense. She'd seen Draco at enough events over the years to know it was his preference, as well.
Neville released him, joining Draco on his slow walk through the rows of grapevines. He understood why Draco would come here to think – he often wandered these same rows when something was bothering him. The two of them – with Blaise's occasional help – had nurtured the land, spending hours returning the ailing vineyard to its present state of health and fertility. Draco had struggled in those two years after Patrizia left him. He'd suddenly found himself questioning everything about his life – his sexuality, his place in society, his worth as a father, his decision to hide Cal away from the world. The winery had been his salvation, giving him an outlet to pour all of his anxious energy into.
"Mother?" Draco whispered, his throat raw from crying and screaming.
"Well, I think it was nice of him to offer to help," Hermione said, twirling a bite of pasta on her fork. "And we finished much faster than we would have without him."
headlines.
"Everything all set for tomorrow night?" Charlie asked, tipping his glass toward Harry as he spoke. All of the Weasleys were back in town for the wedding, most eagerly anticipating Ron's stag party.
Draco grinned, his gaze sweeping over to his desk, where the first of his courtship gifts, a CD Harry had sent over the day before, was tucked away. It was *NSYNC's Greatest Hits, and he'd die before admitting to Harry or anyone else that he already had a copy.
"Can't print a damn thing about me dating Draco. I sent a certified owl to both the publisher and editor of every wizarding paper and magazine in Europe this morning," Harry said, looking more than a little satisfied with himself. His solicitors were preparing similar missives to papers in the United States as well, since the American magical community exalted in following his love life, too.
Draco cut him off before Harry could say something that would make him crumble – like 'I'd really like to be friends'. The thought of exchanging friendly emails with the man he was in love with but couldn't have was too much.
Draco used his thumb to tip the plastic man's head open, cupping his palm underneath to catch the sweet that fell out. He popped it in his mouth, grimacing at the too-sugary confection. He offered one to Neville, who politely declined.
"Malfoy Manor in Wiltshire," Draco said, his jaw clenching when the potion wasn't satisfied with his answer.
“Fucking hell, Hermione,” Theo ground out, releasing his death grip on the chair and letting himself buck up into her mouth. It only took a few more strokes and sucks before he was coming hard enough to see spots.
," she said, shooting him a disapproving glare. He blushed, waves of mortification washing over him again at the memory of George asking him about the charmed cock rings – in front of Hermione – at the brunch Molly had thrown for the couple this morning. "You said you'd help. We've got more than 100 left to do, so get to work."
“Hermione!” Theo glanced around, double checking to make sure they were the library’s only occupants. But Hermione had, as always, done her research and chosen her moment well. She knew every other student in their year would be in the Slytherin common room right now, and any professors out on the prowl for rule-breakers would be congregating in the dungeons, too, hoping to catch a drunken student or two.
Draco didn't notice three sets of eyes watching him, the most conspicuous being the matron of honor, whose gaze flicked between him and Harry several times before settling on her brother, focusing on the words being spoken. Neville shot Pansy a small smile, both of them easily following Draco's gaze, which still rested on Harry. Maybe everything would work out, after all.
The magnolia trees, which had long since lost their fragrant blooms after Neville removed the Stasis Spells, were covered in more of the tiny, sparkling lights and colorful ornaments that dipped gracefully from their boughs. Draco blinked when something cold feathered against his cheek, looking around in wonder as he realized it was
"I'm glad he hasn't fallen off the face of the Earth, Harry," she said slightly condescendingly. "And you're right; he was terribly rude to leave his response this long. Now shut the bloody hell up and get to work!"
He shook his head, recording the vitals on the chart with his wand. "I don't know how – or why – you did it. No one's survived resistance at that dosage. Six drops – it's a wonder that didn't kill you on its own," he said, clucking his tongue.
He grinned. Some things never changed, and one of them was the way his red-headed friend always thought with his stomach.
Harry groaned, letting his head hit the doorframe with a 'thunk' at Cal's words.
Hermione frowned, crouching down to tweak Freddie's tiny toes. The baby gurgled, and she smiled, tickling the foot she still held.
Draco scowled. The owl with the
hit Harry's shield at the same time the jet of green light did, causing the silvery mist to shimmer and solidify into a glass-like substance. The curse rebounded, hitting a tapestry on the wall and scorching through it.
Everyone laughed, including Harry. He wrapped his arm around his husband's waist, keeping him close.
, Draco," Blaise said, his tone somewhat awestruck. From the sound of it, Harry and Draco had been going at it nonstop since the bonding ceremony, with no hint of slowing down.
Harry looked around, distressed to realize that everyone else was taking their seats. He gestured toward the sparsely populated table at the side of the room, following the blond's lead as they claimed their chairs as well.
"Thank you, Madge. Blaise is correct. You truly are a queen among witches."
Draco swallowed, trying to test out answers to see how much the potion would let him hide. He had to figure out a way to answer truthfully without giving too much away.
His best friend Harry was falling for Malfoy. And he couldn't do a thing to stop it, because they were so damn
Kingsley risked a glance back at Harry and Draco, his face heating as he realized they had already shed their robes, still wrapped around each other in a passionate kiss, their hands ripping at their remaining clothing.
Draco smirked, and Harry fell back against the pillows, realizing he wasn't going to come back. He could feel the smug satisfaction, tempered with arousal, flowing through their bond.
sound sorry.
"You don't have to worry," he whispered, his eyes trained on the door, watching to make sure no one came in. "Cartwell and the other wizard – Jameson – were the only two, other than myself and Harry, who found out about your son yesterday."
it's nothing. We hate each other. That's not going to change, no matter how civil we act in public. He's still Harry Potter, and I'm still Draco Malfoy," he said, his tone bitter, remembering the recriminating look the green-eyed wizard had given him yesterday at the mention of the Divitiae Society.
She pinned and measured for several more minutes, humming to herself to fill the silence. Harry just watched Ron, the two of them carrying on a silent conversation through their expressions. Ron knew exactly how Harry felt – he'd been standing on that stool only twenty minutes earlier.
She grinned, rolling her eyes.
"Residence?"
Draco stood, frozen, as Harry approached, his lungs screaming for air as he held his breath, hoping the wizard wouldn't notice him.
"Sue has the flu," Hannah said, wrinkling her nose. "Bad case, too. Poor thing. I think Justin was still coming, but he got held up at work."
The witch studied him curiously, her eyes wide as she took in his still-red face and the light sheen of sweat that now covered his upper lip.
"It'll all be over tomorrow, thank Merlin," he said, waiting for Hermione to pull back the covers on Harry's bed before depositing the sleeping man on the mattress. He pulled Harry's shoes off, stepping back as Hermione Transfigured his clothes into pajamas.
TBC: One more chapter left and then the Epilogue!
"So let me get this straight, if you will," she said, giggling madly at her pun. Harry rolled his eyes. "You hope to find a serious partner from an ad on a Web site?"
She glared at him, crossing the kitchen – skirting the spilled Firewhisky – to get him a glass of water, which he gulped gratefully. She started a pot of coffee – it clearly wasn't the time for tea – and threw some bread in the toaster, figuring he wouldn't be able to stomach much more than that.
"Wards," came the answer to his unvoiced question, the voice becoming louder as the man approached. "You triggered them when you entered the vineyard."
," Harry said simply, nodding toward the bracelets in Draco's outstretched palm. He shifted his gaze to the potions on the table. "Sensilis Potion."
He sighed, nodding. She didn't understand why he insisted on keeping the penname, and he did feel a bit guilty about it. He didn't need the money – not with the Black and Potter vaults and properties that had come to him when he came of age – but it would make a world of difference to her and Ron. James Evans was a well-known name, and a fairly big pull. But as Harry Potter, he'd easily double the profits the books made.
Harry smiled, excited for the afternoon to finally arrive so he could introduce Cal to Teddy. He couldn't wait. Despite their age difference, he was sure the two boys would get along fabulously. Andi had already agreed to let Teddy stay over at the chateau while Harry and Draco went on their honeymoon, giving the boys a chance to get to know each other. Harry wondered if Narcissa knew what she was getting herself into – either boy could be a terror in his own right, and together Harry was sure they'd have the start of the next generation of the Marauders on their hands.
"Hullo,
Draco hid his grimace when the stout wizard stood, ridiculously overdressed in ostentatious robes better fitted to a ballroom than a planning board meeting.
cleans his cauldrons –"
He watched a witch twirl around a pole, doing things with it that should not have been anatomically feasible, his lips twitching with laughter as Blaise leaned forward, tucking a shiny Galleon into the scanty G-string she wore. The money disappeared at once – Draco wondered what kind of charm they'd used, curious about how they'd managed that piece of complicated magic – which was fortunate, since the skimpy fabric didn't look like it would have withstood the added weight of the gold coin for long.

"Twenty seconds," Draco rasped, his hand stealing down the front of his silk pajamas and wrapping around his leaking cock.
Harry waved as Hermione stepped into the Floo, headed home. He stared at the green flames for a second before walking back to the kitchen, wondering what Sly had meant when he had told Harry not to make plans for dinner. He knew it was still too soon for the two of them to meet, and the agency wouldn't give out his identity without his permission. He had just poured himself a glass of wine when a knock sounded at his door.
they could get past their schoolboy hatred, which was a big hurdle. McGonagall had suspended the House system for the first few years after the war, forcing all the year-mates to room together instead of separating them out by House. The results had been a tentative truce between the returning seventh-year Slytherins and Gryffindors, which only solidified after they left school. Harry and Draco had never patched things up, though, despite the fact that they now shared a good number of friends.
"Wait," Draco said, his voice thick. He turned toward Harry, searching out both of his hands. He held them tightly, staring directly in to the concerned green eyes. "You know I've done this before," he said, concentrating hard on not stumbling over the words. It felt important to get it out there. "These memories you want me to see – I assume they're your past. Mine might not be as horrific as yours, but I still think you should know."
Harry very nearly closed the window, growling out loud at yet another attempt to get his attention with a lame pick up line.
She waited until the green flames had died down before throwing in another pinch of Floo powder, praying Neville was at his cottage and not at the chateau.
Draco still looked skeptical, though Harry could see the excitement on his face. He knew Draco would let him do anything he wanted in that moment, even if it meant sacrificing the privacy the formal courtship allowed them.
He and Draco had agreed he might as well reveal his identity as James Evans if the opportunity presented itself. His books had risen in popularity over the years, and he couldn't go anywhere in his glamour without being mobbed. It was almost as bad as going out as Harry Potter.
"And since he invoked it for marriage as well, it might carry over if you two decide to go that route. I've never seen
, Gin," Neville greeted her, smiling and nodding as she asked if she could step through for a moment.
"If you were going to hex anyone, it should be Smith," Blaise said, his lip curling in distaste. He hadn't liked the man at Hogwarts, and he liked him even less now. "Sycophantic little wanker."
The dress robes hid his arousal, and he'd been slipping away periodically to make good use of the arousal-dampening spell Sev had taught him all those years ago. Still, he'd been uncomfortable all day. He'd popped into his potions lab just before lunch, hoping to brew the antidote, but found that Harry had gotten there first, removing several of the key ingredients he needed to make it. The black-haired menace had even raided Cal's junior potions lab, making sure there was nothing there that could help Draco in his current state.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. They belong to JKR, even though she insists they're straight.
Draco nodded absently, locating the message from the stern wizard in question. Abraxas Wedgewick. The man was an absolute snob, and Draco had a feeling his family name was greasing the wheels for their proposal – a nice change, since usually it worked the other way around. He made a note to have Madge send the wizard a complimentary pass to his club, an exclusive society where the pureblood (and half-blood, as of a few decades ago) elite met to play cards and smoke. He never went there himself, and he only kept up his family's membership for moments like these. He had no use for old fools who put too much stock in blood purity and old money.
"Harry?" she called out again, starting to get worried. It wasn't like Harry to miss meetings, even ones he didn't want to attend.
"Just take that off – carefully!" she chided when he hurried to remove the jacket. "Mind the pins. The finished tuxedos will be ready for you to pick up next week."
Draco waited a beat, expecting Potter to intervene. Surely this was not on the list of allowable activities for the night. He'd discussed them at length with Hermione while they waited for their coffee earlier that day, after she'd invited him and Blaise to tag along. He hadn't planned on taking her up on it, but then he'd remembered Gryffin wasn't going to be available all night.
"I acted like an idiot," Draco snorted, spinning the nearly full glass again. He'd had his fill of Firewhisky the night before, but the conversation seemed to demand it. It wasn't something to be discussed over tea. "I'm not sure he'll forgive me. I just left him there – logged out."
Harry's amusement through their bond. He stared at his husband in awe, knowing his emotions were being channeled to Harry as well. He had no hope of retaining even a shred of his Slytherin Ice Prince self with Harry now; the man had a backstage pass to all of Draco's innermost feelings.
"I love my mother."
Potter
Steeling himself, Draco crossed the room, careful to keep his fingers from touching Harry's when he handed him the whisky. The courtship rules weren't that strict, of course, random brushes of hands would be fine. Still, he didn't trust himself have any skin contact with the dark-haired wizard, afraid even the slightest friction of skin on skin contact would leave him helpless to do anything but throw Harry to the floor and fuck him senseless.
Harry faltered before he could tie the small package on his owl's leg, swallowing back a sudden pang of sorrow for the loss of Hedwig. It had been more than a decade ago, but it felt as fresh as yesterday after dredging up all those old memories for Draco's gift. He let the package rest on the desk, waving the owl away. He wasn't ready to send it off just yet.
"He is, but James Evans is a penname," Draco said, twirling the glass absently on the table. He didn't notice Neville's eyes close, or the way the Gryffindor swallowed convulsively. "He uses a glamour, so the photo in his book isn't really him."
Draco watched Potter warily, his hand safely cradled in his lap. Far away from Potter. Potter, who was apparently the man he'd been corresponding with for the last two months.
Teddy cleared his throat, straightening his shoulders. He'd definitely inherited Tonks' flair for drama in addition to Remus' brilliant mind.
doing here?"
Draco's eyes were alight, and he gestured animatedly as he spoke. Blaise grinned; it was a real treat to see his best friend so happy.
: Frustrating, isn't it? When will these oblivious boys get a clue? *grins* Why, in the next chapter, of course! The much-awaited meeting – and wedding – is next.
No matter what the Slytherin was hiding, though, Harry was confident he could handle it. Prison time in another country? No problem. Mental breakdown? He seemed fine now, so that was alright too. Rehab for Potions abuse? A common enough occurrence, and one Harry could easily deal with.
Pansy paused, waiting to see if the vow would let her answer. "I don't really have a say in it," she said carefully, sighing in relief when no buzz of pain wracked her skull.
Ron's words, paired with the sight of the stone Pensieve in Blaise's hands, brought Harry back to his senses. He wanted to finish the courtship correctly. They'd be able to sign the contract in just a few hours, and then everything would be fine. First, though, he had to make sure Draco watched his memories.
This situation clearly wasn't a complete surprise to the boy – Blaise had called him Cal? – so Draco must have told him it was possible, Harry thought. He felt something inside him snap, white hot rage at the thought of Draco being forced to hide his son away from the world, fury that a little boy who had done nothing wrong would be held accountable for the sins of his family.
"Mr. Malfoy, if you would."
"Harry, are you sure you know what you're doing?" Hermione was nervously shredding her napkin, and tufts of the mangled paper littered their table.
"I loved Severus Snape."
“Not a bad idea,” Lavender said, handing the soda back to Draco and grabbing Ron’s wrist. “I can think of someone
, Harry thought ruefully. "You're the Savior of the Wizarding World. The Boy Who Lived."
Harry knew that was high praise indeed from Snape, so he chose not to tell him it had been George who had picked the set out. He could use any leg up with the portrait he could get, and he was not above claiming that success as his own. After all, it
When Draco moaned and arched against Harry, a deliciously wanton sound so thoroughly unexpected from a man who was generally so composed, twisting his fingers in his arse with enough skill to make Harry see spots, he thought might come then and there.
"Yes."
She nodded, walking straight to his liquor cabinet and pouring them both a shot of Firewhisky.
"And I don't care. You don't have a choice in the matter. Now, go."
He could hear Draco's laugh echo down the corridor as he fumbled for his wand, shutting and locking the door. He threw back the duvet, fisting himself roughly until he felt Draco's rising arousal through the bond. He held on until his husband was close, too, letting himself go so they could come together. As mad as he was at Draco, he didn't want to deny himself the closeness and satisfaction that followed when they came together. He'd start on Draco's punishment later.
"Let's go. I'll Floo home with you, make sure you have everything you need. I'm sure Madge is already Owling an order over to the apothecary for whatever potions you need."
Harry how deeply he was loved every day, even if the words never made it past his lips.
if it included cheesy pick-up lines. Because pick-up lines often led to sex and Draco very much wanted to have sex with Harry.
"Two sugars and a splash of milk?" she said dryly, her smile growing as she looked at Blaise's mock-innocent face.
The fact that he had no desire to fill the position for more than a term or two was what had made Oliver Wood an excellent choice as Ginny's replacement. He was on a forced medical sabbatical from Puddlemere United due to a wrist injury he'd gotten earlier in the season. It didn't prevent him from flying, but it would never heal properly if he had continued to play Keeper with the injury. He was spending his recuperation time helping out.
Harry mirrored his actions, his teeth tightly clenched to keep from moaning as his fingers slid over the soft surface of his wand, the sensation making his stomach jump in excitement. If these random touches felt this good, what would it feel like when Draco's hands ran over his body? Harry shuddered again, letting his wand fall to the carpet.
"Is everything alright? Freddie's latest tests come back OK?"
Harry's brow furrowed, unsure of what Malfoy was on about. Spoken word? They'd never spoken. He thought about their shared wanks over chats, and the heady mix of amusement and arousal he usually felt when he received an email from the man. But the spoken word?
Draco frowned, his eyes moving from the stack of papers to Blaise's concerned face. As much as he was interested in Gryffin – and Merlin knew, he really wanted this to work out – he wouldn't do anything that risked Cal's safety.
"Did he cook this himself?" Hermione asked, nibbling on the crunchy meringue.
"Oh, yes. He said he'd be sending something through the agency today, though I have no idea what it is," he said, lifting the flap on the basket curiously. Harry gasped when he saw what was inside; the small basket was obviously magical, since the interior held what looked like a several-course meal big enough to feed a small army.
" – and then I mixed the other two together, and it exploded!"
changed. The fact that I count you among my closest friends proves that."
Both men were silent for a moment, then Draco stunned Ron by covering the redhead's hand with his own, squeezing it tightly.
"There's nothing wrong with romance," he said, his breath coming in tight pants.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. Not mine!
"I suppose," he groused, waving the bottle of wine at her. "It looks like he's forgiven me, at any rate. Thanks for this, Pans."
Harry rolled his eyes as Hermione snorted inelegantly, swirling around in the desk chair to face him.
Computers and other electronic devices did not respond well to magic, which meant taking them through a Floo ride or Apparating with them could cause the devices to short out. Harry's laptop had wards around it to shield it from the ambient magic in his home, but those protections wouldn't hold up to the forces of magical transportation.
he thought, teeth gritted, as he wrapped the cock ring tightly around the base, his eyes sliding shut at the sensation.
"Let's go home," she answered, tugging him toward the green flames as Pansy and Oliver vanished.
"Wait – you said Gryffin confessed he's actually James Evans?" Neville asked, his voice rising.
She did. But she also knew how Draco felt about Gryffin – was their budding relationship enough to change Draco's mind about Gryffindor's Golden Boy?
"Alright, then," Harry said, nodding to him. "Your question?"
why only married couples are invited."
He was surprised when Draco offered his own manicured palm, his warm fingers wrapping around Harry's and dispelling all lingering disgust over Wedgewick's slimy handshake. Harry's eyes widened in astonishment at the firm hand gripping his own, shaking it absently as he met Draco's similarly shocked gaze.
"I'll be back in ten minutes," she promised, hurrying toward the door.
Draco turned in Harry's arms, shooting him a questioning glance.
," he whispered, grateful when the barely noticeable ward responded, shimmering until it was a cloudy film between the two men.
Harry nodded, his eyes warming at the mention of Cal. He squeezed their joined hands reassuringly.
He smiled, his shoulders relaxing as he thought about Sly, who was likely fielding similar questions wherever he was today. It made Harry feel better, for some reason, knowing Sly was just as miserable as he was.
"I would never do anything to jeopardize Caleum," Harry said seriously, able to pinpoint the exact moment Draco's rational brain flicked back on because he saw the man stiffen and blink. "It will be fine, I promise. Twenty minutes."
he thought, his eyes scanning the screen as he looked for any sign of Sly. It was several minutes past 9 p.m. – maybe he'd gotten delayed.
Blaise muttered something unintelligible, muffled by the arm draped over his face. Draco grinned, directing his wand at the shades covering the windows. Light poured into the room, and Blaise groaned, turning his face away.
Harry grinned at Draco's stiff posture and overly formal manner, thrilled to realize the other man felt the same tug of desire he did. It was beyond torture to sit here with Draco, watching the firelight play across his finely sculpted features, his normally immaculate blond hair still tousled from their earlier snowball fight, and not be able to touch him. Harry unconsciously licked his lips, unsure of whether he wanted to fuck or be fucked the first time they were allowed such contact. To have Draco under him, writhing with pleasure – Harry cut the thought off abruptly, shifting uncomfortably in the over-stuffed chair. It was hard enough to be here without sporting a rock-hard erection, which was the way things were heading if he continued that line of thought.
"Just Neville?" He asked, bracing for an angry outburst. They definitely still needed a chaperone – the little show with the sparks confirmed that – but he didn't want everyone to watch as Draco viewed some of the worst moments of his life.
"Immediately? But how?" Harry looked down at the floor, afraid he might lose it if he looked anyone in the eye. "Alone, then. No friends, no f-family?"
"You mentioned you were a sap for Christmas once," Harry said, his tongue darting out to lick at a stray drop of whisky on his lip. He knew exactly how the motion would affect Draco, and he allowed himself a quick smirk. He was glad he wasn't the only one with a painful erection.
"And the spells on it?" Harry asked, crouching down so he could see the carvings up close. They really were exquisite.
"Draco Abraxas Potter-Black, it is the wish of your son, Caleum Alexander Malfoy, and your husband, Harry James Potter-Black, that guardianship over your son be shared with Harry James Potter-Black. He will be granted full rights as your son's father, and will be recognized by the law and your son's magic as such. Is this your wish?"
He and the mystery man had been corresponding with increasing frequency over the last three weeks, shooting questions back and forth all day (and night) long, and they still hadn't come any closer to revealing their identities. Harry had learned that the other man worked in the corporate world and that he was secretly obsessed with Muggle cuff links and had more than 40 pairs, but nothing that would identify him. Likewise, Harry had told him a lot about himself, but nothing that would give away who he was. His favorite bit of information so far, though, had been Sly's revelation that he loved James Evans a few weeks back.
"We just heard," Hermione said in a rush, dropping her bag on the hearth and entering the room. Ron followed suit, stretching his shoulders in relief. "How are you coping? Are you alright?"
"Merlin," he whispered, Ron's answer clicking in his mind.

Theo pressed a hand to his heart, pretending to be hurt. "What, I'm not good enough?"
"I don't know, Malfoy, do you really think it would have been possible to fake those … stimulating … chats we had?"
"That's Harry," Neville said, forcing a chuckle to try to lighten the mood. They wouldn't get anywhere if Draco was in this kind of mood. Best to leave it for awhile.
"Draco," Harry said with a smirk, clearly over his earlier humiliation. He let his gaze trail down Draco's body, his smirk growing when he saw the bulge of Draco's erection. "See you in a few days."
“It is, isn’t it?” Draco replied without the slightest bit of modesty. Slytherin was known for its killer parties, and he wasn’t above taking credit when he was the mastermind.
Draco stretched as much as he was able without waking the boy, trying to wake up enough to shift Cal over to the mattress. He really needed to set some sort of alarm ward that would notify him when Cal was out of bed, he thought, easing himself up into a sitting position once the sleeping boy was safely nestled next to him.
"How?" Neville asked, arching a brow at Ron. The redhead was curiously calm about this. Did he
His heart melted at the sight, but he stood his ground. The boy had everyone wrapped around his little finger, but Blaise knew better than to contradict a direct order from Draco.
As uncomfortable and frustrated as he was, Draco couldn't help but be proud of his husband. It had been an entirely Slytherin prank, and he'd executed it well. He just hoped Harry gave him the antidote before they had to walk down the aisle. He'd rather not have to hobble.
won't make me," Cal said, his tears finally brimming over. "She said I have to take care of you, because you're too stupid to let anyone else."
She frowned, collecting the crystal stemware Sly had sent along with the wine. She and Harry cleared the rest of the table in silence, carrying it all to the kitchen. Hermione looked around, watching as Harry discretely fingered the delicate neck of a wine glass. Sighing, she aimed her wand at the sink and filled it with hot, soapy water.
"It will be," he promised, his eyes widening as the Nutrient Potion finally took effect, transforming the plant from sickly to robust. "It will be."
" – terribly sorry, but his absence was unavoidable yesterday." Blaise was just outside the door, his tone conciliatory and sincere.
"I'm going," he said, directing his words at Blaise instead of the infuriated blond. "Fire-call me later, yeah?"
Draco insisted on cooking, since he had essentially invited himself over for the evening. Ginny hadn't given more than a token protest, since she knew he was a fabulous cook, and it was a chore she hated. She watched as Theo played on the rug with Caleum, who was babbling excitedly about Freddie.
Ron looked up as Lavender stomped down the stairs, her face darkened in a pout. The last vestiges of hope for the evening fled as he looked at her stony face.
Their eyes locked, and Harry cringed at the incredulity he saw in the grey depths.
"And Blaise," she said meekly, cringing as she waited for an explosion.
Draco's lips curved into a small smile, but Harry wasn't fooled. He'd studied the blond for countless hours at Hogwarts, and he could tell the gaiety was forced. There was no warming of those beautiful grey eyes. "Harry," he replied, nodding at him politely. "Weasley."
Harry smiled, his arm still tingling from the shock. He'd never seen it happen before, but then again, he'd never seen
deserve it."
, he mused, scooting forward to open the box. He looked up at Draco, his confusion evident when he pulled one of the bottles out of the box. It was an Australian Shiraz, his favorite label out of Coonawarra. Ten bottles of it, it looked like.
. He rolled his hips experimentally, hoping it would be invitation enough for the Slytherin to begin to thrust. Draco felt wonderful inside him, filling and stretching him almost to the point of pain. Harry relaxed into the burning sensation, which was already easing as Draco began to thrust in long, sure strokes.
Draco growled, grabbing his wand and quickly warding the portrait so Severus couldn't come back. He tapped it against his bracelet, muttering the countercharm that severed the connection between the bracelets. The feeling of Harry's hand on his cock vanished.

"No, Dumbledore," Draco snapped, angry color flooding his cheeks, chasing away the deathly pallor.
Draco swallowed, steeling himself. "Her name is Patrizia Silvano, and she's the youngest daughter of an Italian pureblood family from Venice."
Silver was the predominant color in the room, celebrating the couple's rare bond. It could easily have been overdone and tacky, but there was no chance of that happening with Narcissa Malfoy at the helm. She'd spent days poring over plans with Daphne, occasionally joined by Luna and Hermione and even more rarely, Draco or Harry. The effect she'd managed was elegant and glamorous, with just the right amount of sparkle and glitz to add an almost fairytale quality to the room.
"If he doesn't like it, I'll deal with the fall-out when it happens," Harry said firmly, unwilling to be swayed from his choice. If Draco couldn't understand what he'd done, they probably didn't have much of a future together anyway.
“You can definitely manage the spell,” she said, leaning forward to whisper in his ear. He shivered as her hot breath ghosted over his neck. “You just haven’t had the right motivation.”
Draco clenched his teeth, the low-grade headache he'd had ever since he woke after his run-in with Cartwell blossoming painfully.
"That's wonderful. Are you bringing him to the wedding? Do we get to meet him?"
was still there, but it seemed to be weaving the two auras together, combining them until none of the colors were distinct.
sorry about that in the morning," Charlie said, ready to defend his honor – and his heterosexuality.
Theo forced himself to look at Hannah, trying to keep his voice even as Hermione’s talented tongue drew a stripe up the underside of his erection.
"Yes, that's it exactly," she giggled, closing Harry's laptop and heading back toward the Floo. She'd left Ron alone in the kitchen, which meant breakfast was probably a disaster. "I'll see you later, Harry. Think about what I said, alright? You should tell him who you are – or at least that you're James Evans – before you meet."
"Not that I'm not thrilled to see you, because I am," he said carefully, squinting as he watched Draco's eyes shutter, all emotion gone, "but why are you here?"
"No," Cal admitted, still grinning. "She called him a
The grizzled Auror perked up at the new information, pulling Draco's file closer to him. It didn't say anything about the existence of a chateau in France.
His breath caught in his throat, the words of congratulations he'd been forming dying on his lips. The newly married Weasleys weren't on the terrace, but Potter was. The dark-haired wizard was seated on a chaise, cradling his godson in his arms, his expression soft as he pressed a kiss to the sleeping boy's forehead. Teddy – all long limbs and sharp angles – had obviously exhausted himself in all the excitement, not moving at all under his godfather's gentle caress. Suddenly, the enormity of what he was losing with Gryffin hit Draco.
: IntrospectiveIntellectual
Blaise gave a cursory rap against Draco's office door with his knuckles before entering. He sprawled inelegantly on a chair in front of Draco's desk, arching an eyebrow.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. Unfortunately, they don't belong to me.
Harry smiled, taking pity on him. "It's Mr. Potter-Black, actually. Which paper are you from?"
Draco pulled his head out of the fire when he heard a noise behind him. Blaise had entered the room and was crouching down next to him.
"I am. Do you know where everyone else is?"
"How could he
"Harry?" a gratingly familiar voice asked, and Harry gritted his teeth.
Harry was about to boot up the computer to check his email – it
"I was kidding, Hermione," he said, his lips twitching in amusement. Why was she so worked up over where he sat at the reception?
Ginny turned again, searching for the blond head that she knew would stand out from the rest. She found him, seated in the fourth row. Pansy and Oliver were with him, and she saw Daphne and Neville making their way toward him as well.
“She’s not coming,” Lavender announced, grabbing Ron’s hand and dragging him out of the chair and toward the portrait hole.
"What the hell are you doing here?" Pansy asked, her brows furrowed when she saw Ron in his magenta Aurors robes.
Draco wondered idly, blinking as Seamus cast
Harry. Draco closed his eyes, fighting back a flood of panic. It was ridiculous to be worried about him now, after the fact, but he still couldn't wrap his mind around the fact that Harry had nearly been killed yesterday. He was a stupid, stubborn, beautiful man, Draco realized. Harry hadn't given a second thought to putting his own life on the line to save Cal's. Draco relaxed slightly, trying to regulate his breathing. Harry knew about Cal, and he wasn't angry. Oh, he was sure the man wasn't pleased, especially to have found out the way he did, but he was still proceeding with their courtship. He still wanted to be part of Draco's – and Cal's – life.
Sometime over the last few hours, Potter had lost his tuxedo jacket, and Draco's stomach clenched at the sight of the man in his shirt-sleeves, cuffs rolled up to expose lightly tanned forearms that were ropey with muscle. He'd been watching those arms wrap around countless people all evening long, puzzled and disturbed by the jealousy he felt every time Potter led another witch out onto the floor or hugged a friend or acquaintance.
Theo waited until Draco's head was turned, then mouthed the word 'pictures' to Blaise, who grinned and nodded before pulling Draco down the corridor. They heard the Floo whoosh in the study as Theo left.
"I happen to think we should stick with the tradition," Draco said, wiping his mouth delicately as he hopped off the bed, pulling his pajama bottoms on over his bobbing erection. He'd pay for this little stunt in many ways, he knew, but it was worth it. He could take care of his own problem with a quick wank, and Harry was awful at holding grudges.
"Justin Timberlake? Is he an important Muggle?"
"I, Kingsley Shacklebolt, Minister of Magic, bear witness to the joining of two kindred spirits, two bonded souls, Harry James Potter and Draco Abraxas Malfoy."
could, how could
"But, Cal?"
Draco sighed resolutely, lifting his wand to cast the charm again.
Draco gulped the potion Neville handed him, sighing in relief as the cool liquid soothed his raw throat and settled his roiling stomach. Another calmed his jangled nerves, and yet another relieved his throbbing headache.
Pansy's grimace softened as she considered Neville's words, the possibilities becoming clearer. Neville
"Blaise has the flu, too," Draco offered, reaching for the bread basket by his elbow.
"Mr. Malfoy?" she asked, her glasses perched on her nose as she looked up from typing a contract. "Can I get something for you, sir?"
"Harry correctly assumed that part of Draco's hesitancy was the press he was likely to garner if he was dating the Chosen One," Neville said, sticking his tongue out in response when the dark-haired wizard quirked an eyebrow at him. "And yes, I know the implications of the law, Harry. I just hadn't gotten there yet."
Ron looked up, trying for a smile that looked more like a grimace. This wasn't happening, he assured himself. This
"You in the green coat," he said, pointing to a short man in the front row. Hermione lifted the spell, allowing him to speak freely while the rest of the reporters were still Silenced.
"I talked to the supplier Theo wants to use, and it sounds like we'll get a good deal on the furniture you approved for the club," Blaise continued, swallowing a laugh when Draco abruptly turned in his chair, now facing the dark computer screen.
"Stop hogging the newlyweds," Pansy complained, sidling up to them and kissing both men on the cheek. "May the blessings of Merlin be with you."
"The author, Blaise," Draco snapped, lifting his head. Blaise could see the dark smudges under his eyes, his pale skin even chalkier than usual. All the signs of a sleepless night.
“Things get a bit out of control?” he asked her, raising an eyebrow at the dancing boys.
"Good for each other," Harry echoed, and Neville began to worry he was in shock.
"Brilliant, mate," Ron said, slapping him on the back.
"A little warning next time?" he snapped, frowning at the brothers, both of whom were laughing at him.
"Draco Potter-Black, so help me Merlin, if you ever desert me on another Weasley weekend we're finished, eternity bond or no," he muttered darkly as he Summoned his wand from his bedside table, stalking out into the hallway to set the children to rights. He'd use a Sticking Charm to keep them in their beds if he had to.
The witch looked momentarily stricken by the sight of Harry, quickly regaining her composure. Without looking at Draco, she offered the men a tentative smile, closing the distance between them.
"So? Are you in?" He repeated, his eyes sparkling.
. Harry's attempt to disarm Cartwell didn't fare as well, since the man had a spare wand tucked into a holster on his ankle. They circled each other, both crouched into a dueling stance, as Ron scrambled to get into a position with a clear shot at the rogue Auror.
The press had backed off Harry, as per his orders, but they were still camping out on her doorstep daily and printing stories about how her marriage was in trouble. She and Oliver were handling it as best they could, but it still infuriated her every time she opened the
– unless his translation was wrong. He didn't know what Smith was playing at – the decidedly nasty turn the articles had taken definitely didn't make it seem like he truly wanted a reconciliation.
Pansy and Daphne both moved closer to each other, holding hands unconsciously. Oliver swung his arm around Pansy's waist pulling her tight against his chest as they watched the two men stare at each other. The purebloods in the room exchanged a significant glance that left Hermione anxious and annoyed. She placed a questioning hand on Ron's shoulder.
Harry grinned, pressing his wand to Draco's ring finger.
Harry pushed back from his desk, wincing as he stretched. He'd been hunched over his laptop all afternoon, furiously writing to make the latest deadline for his next book. Hermione wasn't speaking to him – aside from extremely professional emails inquiring after his health and the status of the new chapters, which was arguably worse than a total cold shoulder – and he thought finishing these early might get him out of trouble.
, but I didn't know that word. She said it meant he was being a foolish idiot."
"How much did they lose?" He whispered, his eyes still wide.
"Close your eyes," Harry said, his voice low and soothing. He tightened his arms around Draco, letting him feel the warmth of his body. "Just let everything go."
"What exactly did you give him?" Ron asked, peering over at Harry's slumped form.
Harry swallowed, feeling his emotions surge. This wasn't the place for this conversation, and he needed time to think things through before he said anything he'd regret. Like begging Malfoy to take him home and fuck him.
Pansy and Oliver were there, pressed against the far wall, holding hands. Ron and Hermione had stayed, and they were closest to Harry and Draco, standing next to the Floo. Neville and Daphne stood behind Harry's desk, watching with guarded expressions. Hermione had lobbied to invite George and Angelina, along with Ginny and Theo, but Harry hadn't wanted to risk any more guests. He figured their presence at the promissory ceremony had to mean something, and it was likely the bond would see them as safe for the wedding as well.
he has feelings for you, Harry. I do. But I just don't know if that's enough."
Neville settled into his chair as Harry's body slumped over the Pensieve. The two men were entwined, their bodies touching from thigh to chest, their hands still tightly gripping each other's. Unlike everyone else, Neville had a very good idea of what they'd be watching. He'd been Harry's outlet over the years, the one the dark-haired wizard came to when things got to be too much, or when he couldn't deal with the nightmares and memories.
He eyed George speculatively, enjoying the opportunity to tease the infamous jokester. "Or maybe not," he said, shuddering slightly at the thought of another possibility – some sort of potion or spell that would give Angelina a temporary penis. He grimaced, the image completely killing the erection he'd been sporting.
Harry nodded, carefully placing the now-wrapped box on top of the mantle. He'd asked Neville to come pick up the gift, since he didn't want to send it by owl. He grinned, wondering if he'd finally get a chance to see Nev's house after he started dating Draco. The whole area was under some sort of protection charm and Harry had never been able to visit Nev and Daph because of it.
Harry glanced down at the papers in front of him, edits he'd already perused the night before. He'd been unable to sleep, even after his 2 a.m. wank, so he'd brewed some coffee and worked instead.
"I'd say James Evans has done it again. A Crup, though? Where in the world did you come up with that?"
Harry groaned in frustration, wondering why Draco had stopped. They'd waited months to get here, and now that he finally had Draco inside him, Harry wanted him to
Harry didn't bother waiting for the bill to arrive. He stood, throwing more than an adequate number of Galleons on the table. He rested his hand on Zach's shoulder, giving him a comforting squeeze. After all, he knew how much it hurt to watch the person you loved walk away. Though he doubted Zach really loved him.
Harry helped Cal to his feet, dusting the snow off the boy's back and legs as he steadied him on the skates. "You ready?" Harry asked both of the Malfoy men.
"We were both pawns of powerful men, Draco," he said quietly. He saw Draco gasp when he recognized the interior of Malfoy Manor as the memory world swirled around them again. "Neither of us chose the path we took. We were both forced. I accepted my role, though. I've made peace with it, as much as that's possible."
The witch watched him warily, having already been read the riot act by Blaise earlier for refusing to disclose Gryffin's identity. Unlike Blaise, she knew exactly how this would end – she knew who this mysterious Gryffin was.
had been an inspired choice, and Draco fully planned to use each and every one on Harry at some time in the future. He grinned, a strangely content feeling creeping through his chest at the thought of having a future with Harry, even if it included cheesy pick-up lines. Hell,
“Jesus,” Theo groaned, scooting his chair back so Hermione could climb out from under the table. His eyelids, drooping from the force of his orgasm, shot open again as he looked at her. He hadn’t been able to get the full effect of her outfit before, and he felt his spent cock twitch at the delicious picture she made, all long legs and soft curves. The skirt was so short it barely covered her arse, and he could see her pebbled nipples through the sheer blouse.
"Harry James Potter!" Hermione screeched as she stepped into the room, waving a copy of the
so the throng of reporters who had gathered on the front step could hear him easily. Hermione had called a press conference after last night's Sorting so Harry and Draco could control the information that got out. They were having it at Grimmauld Place because neither Harry nor Draco planned to reveal where they had been living for the past five years, keeping the chateau a safe place for their family to retreat from the public eye.
Harry padded out into the room, a towel wrapped around his waist. He looked much better after the shower, Hermione noted, watching as he briskly rubbed his hair with another towel as he walked blindly through the room. She tossed the socks on the bed, bracing herself on his wet shoulder so she could reach up to kiss him on the cheek. His skin was smooth and smelled slightly woodsy, and she was glad he'd taken the time to shave. The glamour would have hidden his stubble, but she knew he hated being unshaven.
"It's perfect!" he cried, marveling at the tiny masterpiece in his hand.
"Going," Snape said, holding up his hands. He knew how much Potter meant to Draco, which meant he'd need to find a way to call a truce with the man or risk Draco removing the portrait. "Bring him to see me after you two are engaged."
The bottle clinked against the desk as he put it aside, eager to log in to the Magical Dating Online web site. His day had been even more intolerable because of his eagerness to chat with Sly, making already interminable meetings seem even longer. He had more ahead of him tomorrow, but he couldn't bring himself to care at the moment, since he was so focused on finally chatting with Sly.
"I'm sorry, we only have time for one question per reporter. As it stands we won't even be able to give everyone that chance. I'm sure you understand," Harry said, shooting the woman a wicked grin. "You in the black cloak. Your question?"
"Because it isn't proper for him to see Draco in person until the first fourteen courtship gifts have been accepted," Pansy said, rolling her eyes. She didn't hate Muggle-born witches and wizards, nor did she think they ought to be barred from wizarding life, but she
“You’re my self-appointed Transfiguration tutor,” he said with a smirk, cocking an eyebrow at her and nodding to the pile of parchment on the table. “Why don’t you tell me?”
Draco thought absently – as he stumbled into the room. Harry had been using the Floo to come over often during the last few days, and Draco never ceased to be amazed at how the normally graceful man always tripped over himself as he stepped out.

"Drink," Neville said, his voice harsher than Draco had ever heard it. He saw Harry fight against Neville's grip, but the other man was stronger. "Don't be an idiot.
Harry was halfway out the door with the soiled sheets before he realized he had no idea where Kreacher took the dirty laundry. He spent a moment reflecting on that, feeling curiously bad about it, before piling the sheets near the dresser and pulling on a pair of boxers to wear while he searched for fresh linens. Those, at least, he had a general idea of where to find.
Harry groaned, running his hand through his hair in frustration. He'd been trying to contact Draco for days now, and he'd been shot down at every turn. No Owls. No emails. He couldn't visit the idiot because his home was protected. He couldn't even Fire-call the prat because the house-elves at the Manor wouldn't tell him where he was staying and Draco's secretary seemed to guard him with her life. He'd even tried to drop by Draco's office, mortified to find himself escorted from the building by two burly security guards before he'd even made it past the lobby.
. She'd known about this farce all along, and she'd done nothing to stop it!
Ron sidled up to the sink holding a dish cloth, drying the pieces Hermione handed him without a word. Years spent in his mother's kitchen had trained him well. Harry beamed at his two oldest friends, wondering if life really got any better than this.
Caleum barely remembered her, but Blaise thought her abandonment might be behind the 6 year old's sudden clinginess.
It was unexpected that said acquaintance would turn out to be the same person I'd been pouring my soul out to for months.
Harry blushed, reaching up to adjust his glasses, his hand faltering when he realized he wasn't wearing them. He studied the pale hand in front of him, with its manicured nails and light dusting of blond hair.

over the last few weeks, eager to learn more about his and his father's namesake constellations. When he'd learned he was going to have a sister, he'd focused even more on learning some of the more obscure ones. He'd liked his parents' choice of Lyra or Vela before he met his sister, but neither of the names seemed to fit the blonde-haired, green-eyed baby in his dad's arms.
"Madam Atalier's son had an appointment with you yesterday, Mr. Malfoy," Blaise said, his lips curved into a smirk only Draco could see, since he remained in the doorway. "Your cancellation was quite inconvenient for him, and Madam was kind enough to come in his place today to settle the matter herself."
Harry was tired of smiling. He was tired of posing for photos, tired of shaking hands with people he was sure he'd never met before. Tired of answering the same old predictable questions, ones he couldn't answer truthfully.
"You're a peach, Madge-pie. An absolute queen among witches," Blaise said, batting his eyelashes at her coquettishly.
Draco groaned loudly, falling backward into his bed fully dressed. He was absolutely exhausted. His business trip had gone fairly quickly, just as he had hoped. Blaise and Theo had dragged him to several wizarding clubs around England similar to the one Theo wanted to develop to help give Draco an idea of what they were trying to do. The trip had gone quickly – they'd only been gone one night – mainly because Theo was anxious to get back to Ginny. She hadn't been too pleased about him leaving her so late in her pregnancy, and from what Draco understood, it was going to take a lot of wheedling and chocolate to get back into her good graces.
“Er, you’ve plenty of time to master it,” she said, hoping to cheer him up. “I think I’ll head back down to the party. It’s still going strong, if you’d like to go.”
"He'd be here himself, but you still have another day left before the courtship rules allow it," Ron said, his chair scooted close to Draco's bed. He looked down, pulling something out of his robes and thrusting it at Draco. "Before I forget. It's today's present."
"You know I'd give you –"
"Oliver's doing a fine job of it, so long as he doesn't think the position is his to keep. I intend to come back after the baby's born."

"I'm fine," the wizard said, rummaging through the bag for a sandwich of his own. He stripped off the meat and cheese, eating the piece of bread plain.
Draco raised his wand, casting Locking and Silencing Charms on the room. He moved to a nearby chair, waiting, his eyes trained on the fireplace. It was 8:30 p.m. and Harry was officially late. Only ten minutes, and Draco himself had just that moment returned from putting Cal to bed, but still.
, how was it possible a simple joining of mouths could make it so much
James Evans," Hermione said, her voice a bit scolding.
"Looking for a wizard to share quiet, candlelight dinners, long walks on the beach and relaxing vacations. Picture me as tall, dark and handsome like Harry Potter. You should be fit and attractive as well. I prefer relationships to one-offs, but either is welcome."
His heart sank as he continued to scroll through the brief list of new posts. Pansy had opened the online dating service last year, apparently drawing inspiration from an infomercial she had seen on a Muggle television channel, of all things. After months of wheedling, Draco had finally given in and agreed to start an account. As Pansy had so helpfully pointed out, he was striking out on the face-to-face front, so he might as well try something new. At least with online dating he could find someone who might actually be interested in him rather than his fortune or his notoriety.
"You can't go in there," Blaise said, stopping Harry with a firm palm against his chest.
Hermione sent him a stern look that was entirely ruined by the twinkle in her eyes.
Draco was still lost in thought when Blaise returned, and the wizard took the opportunity to study his friend. He was a bit thinner than he'd been a month ago and it was clear from the smudges under his eyes that he wasn't sleeping well, either.
"I'll take that as a yes," Hermione said, fighting a smile. She really did love seeing Harry so excited, even if it was tempered with concern that this entire online dating thing could blow up in his face rather badly. Her eyes narrowed as another thought occurred to her. "You
Draco laughed bitterly, pushing away from the fireplace so he could pace the large room. He stepped over a pile of crayons and toys without noticing, his eyes unseeing as he moved.
hadn't he thought to check?
The parchment trembled again, curling into itself and shooting up, growing bark and tender leaves as it transformed. Seconds later, a tiny sapling sat on the table, no sign of the parchment it once was left behind.
"Follow me."
Harry nodded, sending Hannah a grateful smile for her intervention. He hurried away from the table, hearing Smith's protests grow louder as he shot across the room. He was surprised when Neville caught up with him in the corridor, grabbing his arm.
He'd never accepted what had happened, he realized. He'd pushed it all behind him, refusing to deal with it. He'd used Dreamless Sleep until the nightmares had ended. He'd honed his Occlumency skills until he could even shield memories from himself. But he hadn't confronted them. Not like this.
"There is no antidote to Veritaserum, at least nothing that can be taken after ingestion," Seamus said, uncorking two of the vials. "Your magic literally expelled the potion after you passed out. It's probably what saved your life."
, he thought fondly.
Harry blew raspberries against Freddie's stomach, pausing when he heard Teddy's delighted giggle behind him. The boy had stalwartly protested he was too old for his godfather to do the same to him – after all, he was 10, and he'd be starting Hogwarts in a year. Definitely too old for baby games like that.
Harry laughed, pressing a kiss to Draco's warm, wet neck. His eyes were closed, and if he wasn't careful, Harry worried he might fall asleep right there.
that hand. He knew that hand
"Alright," Harry said with obvious relief, his wicked grin returning.
Draco noticed Harry's free hand fist, and he smiled, knowing exactly what the other man was struggling with. It was going to be torture not to touch him, kiss him,
He was still laughing as approached the fireplace, casting a wary glance up at the empty portrait before stepping into the Floo.
Draco pursed his lips, but decided not to answer. Instead he unwrapped the bundle, revealing a bottle of red wine. He turned the bottle slowly in his hands.
Draco shifted Harry slightly so he could work a hand between them. Harry found his cock tightly trapped between Draco's hand and his own belly, the former wrapped tightly around it and moving in time with Harry's own strokes. He tried to cry out Draco's name as his orgasm overtook him, to tell him he loved him, but his lips were unable to form the words. He felt as though he was riding a wave of climax that had been building for weeks, months, years. How long had he been harboring secret affection for the snarky Slytherin who had made his school days such hell? If he was honest with himself, and in this position he could hardly be anything but, it had been well before they left Hogwarts.
Draco stayed silent but struggled to sit up, intent on getting his clothes and leaving. Seamus stopped him easily, pressing a hand against his chest.
"Dashing, Mr. Potter," the older witch said finally, nodding her approval. He glanced back to catch his reflection in the mirror, shrugging lightly. He looked like himself, in a tux. Nothing extraordinary.
Neville, colored, looking away despite retaining his grip on Harry's arm.
, he thought, not even bothering to read past the headline. This was definitely going to complicate things.
Draco mentally took back every insult he'd ever dealt Weasley as he watched the man light up when Hermione walked down the aisle. Everyone always watched the bride at weddings, but Draco liked to pay attention to the groom – and not just because his preference was men.
"I'm sure he was planning to tell you," Ron said, his eyes traveling to a large photo of Cal. "It's a lot, I know, but – well, I'm sure he had his reasons for keeping it a secret."
he thought, popping open a bottle of Butterbeer. He'd prefer something stronger, but he wanted all his wits about him when he spoke with Sly online. Harry perked up at the thought, taking a long draw from the bottle as he booted his laptop.
"That was different," Draco hissed, shaking Harry's grip off. He didn't want to be touching him when he talked about his involvement with Voldemort. It made him feel dirty. "He was a sadistic bastard who didn't care what happened to his servants. Dumbledore was supposed to be protecting you!"
Instead of reassuring him, though, Harry's words seemed to make Ron even more tense. He couldn't really be that worried about getting married, could he?
Draco thought dryly, the open door the only thing restraining him from rubbing his hand over his fully hardened cock. He sighed, glancing at his watch. He had a meeting in ten minutes, and Madge would be in momentarily with more paperwork for him to sign.
Neville threw down the paper in disgust, pushing his unfinished breakfast aside. Harry had steadfastly been refusing to comment on the Smith situation, which had only fueled the rumor mill more. Today's article featured quotes from the slimy bastard about things Neville wasn't even sure was physically
"Why not add a few extra precautions, since I was setting extensive wards anyway?" Neville just shook his head at the fond smile Draco gave him, squeezing his shoulder in response.
, he thought, taking another close look at himself in the mirror.
, he thought, after he'd had a chance to view Harry's Pensieve memories. He was fairly sure the other man wouldn't agree to furthering their physical relationship until after he'd done so, knowing Harry was apprehensive about how Draco would feel about him after viewing them.
"Really?" Harry asked, turning his head to get a better view. The cut was flattering and attractive, but hardly something he'd have requested.
"I loved my father."
hadn't been the one to do anything wrong.
Draco's breath hitched as the potion caught what he'd been trying to hide, compelling him to continue. The words spilled out in a rush as Draco's eyes widened in horror.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. Much as I love them, they aren't mine.
He waited until he was sure they were both in the trance-like state before rising, digging through the bag he'd brought with him for Calming Draughts and a slew of other potions. If they were watching what he thought they were, they were going to need them.
"Is that it, then?" he asked, pointing to the oddly wrapped package.
Cal shook his head, nestling into Blaise's chest. It was a little cold in the cave, and he didn't understand why his father wasn't there, too.
Harry took a step closer to Draco, taking his hand again. Though he doubted it was real, he could have sworn he could hear Draco's rapid heartbeat. Then again, it could just have been the echo of his own.
"I was shocked, to say the least," Draco said, remembering his outrage. "After Cal was born, though – well, I wouldn't trade having him in my life for anything."
imagine
"Don't start," she said, her voice low and dangerous.
Good for shock value, but probably detrimental to his cause if he really wanted Harry to stick around.
He swallowed heavily, knowing she was right. It had been incredibly foolhardy to venture out in his glamour today. It could easily have slipped half a dozen times today, when he'd dozed off or simply zoned out.
"More," he whispered, challenge sparkling in his eyes.
"I don't think he'll be upset that you're James Evans, exactly," she said carefully, picking up their conversation seamlessly as she settled on the comfortable sofa. Harry followed her lead, perching in a chair and leaning forward. "But you should have told him immediately when he told you he liked the books so much. He'll be mortified, don't you think?"
"Points to me," he panted, grinning as he heaved himself up to return to the computer.
Draco blinked back the sudden prick of tears at having his son in his arms again, healthy and whole. He didn't even register Cal's familiar use of Harry's name until the boy was wiggling away, small-gloved hands pulling at Draco's arm to get him to stand.
"I loved him despite the horrendous things he did, because he was my father. I don't have to agree with what he did to love him."
We're about there…the moment of recognition. Are you just
But still, it was an intriguing idea.
Draco thanked Merlin and every god he could think of when the maitre 'd appeared, oblivious to the tension between the men, and offered to lead him to his table. He watched Harry for a moment longer before nodding, following the man deeper into the restaurant without another word to Harry or Ron.
the naked women. Fleur's Veela blood would boil if she knew he'd been to a strip club, which wouldn't be easy to hide from her enhanced senses.
"No problem," a slightly familiar male voice answered, making Harry gasp in surprise and very nearly drop the steaming cup he held.
"Since this press conference is about our family and not my career, I'll have to ask that any questions about my books be directed to my agent," he said, nodding toward Hermione. "Hermione Granger-Weasley can answer any inquiries you may have."
While he wasn't pleased that business had taken Sly offline, so to speak, for the next few days, it did give him a chance to reflect on what he knew about the man so far, which was frustratingly little. Determined to find a way to expedite the process, he sat down with his laptop and his lovely glass of wine to compose another note for Sly.
"And buying Cal a puppy? A
Harry snuggled down further into the bedclothes, pulling the duvet up higher on his chest. He'd climbed into bed with his laptop to respond to Sly, but he wasn't sure what to say. The dinner he had sent over had been an incredibly sweet gesture, as had the hand-written note that had accompanied it. Harry reached across his pillow to grab the now-wrinkled note, written in firm, neat strokes on heavy cream parchment.
"Are both presenters here?" Wedgewick asked, the gleam in his eye worrying Draco. The other person must be influential as well, to have garnered that look from the notorious social schemer.
"No!" Harry and Blaise said at the same time, their glances unconsciously traveling across the hallway to Draco's door.
"What?" Ginny turned, her lips curving when she caught sight of Hermione. She looked spectacular, and even though Ginny had just helped her get dressed minutes ago, she couldn't help but admire the picture Hermione in a wedding dress made. "Nothing. Just excited."
"You're wrong!"
Draco laughed, cracking the book open. He loved the way the spine of a new book resisted at first, and the way the pages were so crisp.
Hermione shrugged negligently, chewing her lip as she thought about her next move. She and Teddy were playing a magical version of Clue, and it had come time for her to guess.
"We were married a year after our repeated seventh year at Hogwarts," Draco continued, the words coming easier as he saw Harry didn't recoil. The sooner he did this, the sooner they could get on with things. "It was an arranged marriage. Her father contacted my mother, and I agreed. We hoped it might salvage the Malfoy name, but it didn't seem to make much difference."
says you're throwing away your chance at having someone love you," Cal said, his head down. "But it's not true. Because
"Went a bit awry. The sensitizing charm was … too much," George said, moving gingerly toward the Floo.
The large woman stepped forward so she'd be close enough for Harry to hear.
"Cartwell, he's the Auror who –" Harry broke off, looking over at the door to Draco's hospital room. He cleared his throat. "He's the Auror. Ron arrested him, and he's in the Ministry holding cells now. He got a Patronus off before they took him down, though. We don't know who he sent it to."
Harry wasn't sure what emotions were flitting through Draco's eyes, but he knew he saw the love he felt reflected there, and that was all he needed to see. His eyes drifted shut as Draco's lips parted, his tongue darting out to lick a path up Harry's twitching cock, swirling around the head as though savoring the precome that had gathered there.
Harry tapped his foot impatiently, glaring at the clock on his computer screen. Still thirty minutes until it was time to meet Sly. He groaned, stroking his erection through the rough fabric of his denims. He'd been half-hard all afternoon, ever since he'd gotten the charmed cock rings from George. Harry grinned, releasing himself with a sigh.
"Have you decided on a name?" She asked, wiping away a stray tear with the back of her hand.
"He looks alright," Ron whispered, his eyes trained on Harry and Hermione, who were twirling around the floor with skill and grace.
Draco sipped his tea, watching Cal run around the gardens. His son had been ridiculously happy when he'd woken to find Draco at the chateau, which made him feel more than a little guilty. Had he been neglecting Cal? Draco sighed, schooling his tired features into a bright grin when his son waved from his spot on the lawn.
The courtship ritual had been designed in a time ruled by arranged marriages, which were still popular among the pure-blood elite. Draco had entered into one himself, Harry knew. He'd researched Draco extensively, with Luna's help, before deciding to invoke
he thought muddily, blinking to try to orient himself. His heart skipped when he realized he'd fallen asleep during the editorial meeting. Had his glamour slipped? His frantic gaze met Hermione's, and she shook her head slightly, immediately understanding the reason for his distress. His shoulders relaxed slightly, his back still straight, now wide awake from the adrenaline rush.
Harry trembled slightly as he reined in his arousal, his jaw clenching with the effort of not claiming Draco's mouth. His vision had funneled in on the other wizard during the ceremony, and he struggled to draw his consciousness back so he could focus on Kingsley's words. He was gratified to see Draco's wand shake slightly, glad he wasn't the only one affected. Seeing his future husband so vulnerable, strengthened Harry's resolve to finish the ceremony properly. Ironically, the naked longing he saw reflected in Draco's grey eyes made it easier to master his own reaction.
different!
"Potter," he said lightly, his tone masking his racing heart.
"Mmm," Harry groaned, feeling his arousal build, heavy and hot in his belly. He was hardly capable of coherent thought, but his brain hummed with the energy and pleasure of their lovemaking. As hurried as their actions were – Draco was still wearing his trousers, Harry's were pushed haphazardly over his hips, his legs restricted by the pool of fabric – he still wouldn't dare classify their actions as
Gone to sleep in his clothes? Harry looked down at himself, frowning. Why had he done that? And why did it feel like a herd of hippogriffs were dancing the tango in his skull? He swallowed thickly, grimacing at the horrendous taste in his mouth. Merlin, what had he
"Harry," Draco moaned, the word both an exclamation and a plea.
He hadn't been available for meetings lately, but the business hadn't suffered. Blaise was talented enough to run it on his own, not that Draco would ever tell the man. His ego was already big enough.
: IntrospectiveIntellectual
Harry watched as Ron gave up on conversation and dug into his own meal, he wondered if Malfoy had ever made it. It was one of his favorite things to whip up on a cool evening. A pantry pleaser, he'd told Sly, since it went well with virtually any kind of protein or sautéed vegetable.
, Harry thought absently, settling into his chair to look over the Weasleys' Wizarding Wheezes paperwork he'd brought over.
"Doesn't seem like you're too dedicated to the rule, either," Draco murmured with a wicked smile, giving Harry's cock a particularly hard stroke.
I have always done what was expected of me. I sacrificed myself for the greater good on more than one occasion and I have no regrets at having done so. I did what was expected of me, often at great personal loss.
He combed the blond locks, spritzing them with the potion the stylist had given him. Harry never took this much care with his own appearance, but James Evans was a different matter.
"So you
"I do," he said, the words tumbling from his mouth before he could stop them. He turned back to the fire, his grin growing when he saw lust and trepidation battling on Draco's face. "It will be fine. Give me –" he glanced at his watch, biting his lip. "– twenty minutes."
, Harry thought ruefully, fighting the urge to roll his eyes.
"The meeting of the Diagon Alley Zoning Board will come to order," a pinched-face witch intoned, banging a gavel against the heavy wood platform she and four others were seated behind.
Draco, and there were further restrictions about being alone with each other – a big taboo – and touching each other – an even bigger taboo – for another few weeks after that.
As much as I'd rather ignore them and write for you lovelies (and honestly, I would!), the thought of sitting in my living room writing slash while hubby's grandmother is in residence is gross. *leaves to go wash brain out with soap, trying to get rid of the image*
"I am no longer the Boy-Who-Lived," Harry said, his voice strong and clear. "I did my duty to the wizarding people of Britain during the Battle of Hogwarts. Today, I stand here as Draco's husband and Cal and Cari's father. Hermione's friend. Nothing more."
his son looked in Harry's arms, their dark heads touching as Harry carefully bent to tuck the sleeping boy into bed. He'd completely exhausted himself playing in the snow and had fallen asleep on the picnic blanket about an hour earlier.
"You're such a lightweight, Potter," the older man mocked, helping Harry slide into the booth their party had claimed two hours ago when they'd arrived at the club.
Hermione sighed at the disembodied green head currently filling her Floo, shaking her head.
"Do you know who I am, Caleum?" Harry asked, his eyes never leaving the boy's face.
Blaise followed the crushed stone path, winding his way toward the greenhouse. Draco's brow furrowed when he realized the large building was their destination – Cal never went anywhere near it, forbidden to play there by both Draco and Neville because of the dangerous fertilizer potions and plants inside.
"Very good, sir. They are ancient spells, not easily detectable," he said, watching Hermione and Neville both lean closer, curious about the magic they hadn't noticed before. "Since this belonged to a Seer, the bowl was imbued with several high-level clarity and protection spells. Specifically, the original owner cast
miss deadlines, Harry!" she had said, standing over him and shaking his mostly finished manuscript for emphasis.
"He did. He's worried, and so am I. He said something happened with Gryffin?"
“This calls for a reward,” she murmured, letting her hands slide down his body to rest on his cock, which was straining against the fabric of his trousers.
Bill grimaced, already plotting how he could sneak out early –
Cal shrieked, his giggles joining Harry's deeper laughter as they squirmed in the snow. Draco couldn't believe what he was watching, shocked his son seemed to get on so well with a man he'd just met. Of course, Harry
"I don't remember the exact words, but the gist was that he called him a cold-hearted bastard," Neville said, his eyes alight as he watched Hermione recoil in horror.
that had been Sunday's gift. It was the first gift Blaise actually exclaimed over, though the cost or rarity of the book hardly meant anything to Draco. He didn't dare actually read it, lest he disturb the Preservation Spell someone – likely Harry, since the book had come from a Muggle auction house – had placed on the book. He ran a finger over the cover, tracing the title and author's name. Ellis Bell. It had been the perfect gift, really. Not only did it mean Harry remembered his sympathy for Heathcliff, but the inscription inside had melted the last of his resolve.
benefits, after all – for a quick fuck before curfew.
Draco kicked at the fertile soil, the loamy mixture covering the tip of his dragon hide boot. It was a comforting sight – it made him think of the two years he'd spent here learning the ropes of the winery business while taking care of his son.
"Not the ideal way to spend your birthday, I know, but she insisted you come in if you wanted the change made," Hermione said apologetically, leading James Evans through the familiar halls of the publishing house.
wildly.
"I hate to see you in the middle like this, Nev," Harry said, smiling sadly at his obviously distraught friend. Draco had been hidden away in France for the last few days and Neville had taken the brunt of his temper. "You know I don't need you to intervene, right?"
"How're things, Blaise?" he asked, not wanting to mention Cal's name. Draco was getting antsy at not seeing his son, and Harry could only imagine what Cal must think of the situation.
He saw the malicious glint in the other man's eyes, and he knew it was over. Draco had just unwillingly given him the opening he needed, and if he took it, Draco's life would change dramatically.
"You love each other, and nothing you could find out about one another would change that," Neville said, gesturing between the two of them. "You've had a contentious relationship for years, and you're worried some of that old animosity might resurface after the contract is signed. It won't."
Harry poked at Ron, his eyes narrowed.
"As a matter of fact, I am
"Mr. Potter, the contract has recognized and approved your magical signature. Do you stand before me ready to invoke the ancient rite of
Draco examined the object, grinning when he saw a shrunken bottle of Ogden's. Harry must have remembered it was what he preferred to drink before nerve-wracking meetings. Tomorrow's date with Harry would definitely count.
Four sets of eyes stared incredulously as Daphne used her wand to Summon a jar of peanut butter and some crackers from Harry's pantry.
"Talk to Jorgenson," he said, tucking the statements into a different file. He wanted to keep them close, in case the Ataliers tried to make trouble for Malfoy Industries. "Have him continue to monitor their accounts."
had posted to the service, hadn't he?
He grinned when his eyes lighted on Draco, who was standing in the doorway of the kitchen clad in black silk pajamas. His hair was still damp from his shower, framing his face in messy blond tendrils that Harry was quite sure were not usually allowed to air dry.
She looked around, laughing when she saw Neville and Daphne disappear into the green flames. Pansy and Oliver were already halfway to the Floo. It was obvious that everyone had felt the same pulse of sexual energy when Harry and Draco had signed the contract. The irresistible pull the two men felt afterward seemed to be contagious.
"It's all the rage right now," the stylist said, grinning as she made another pass over Harry's head, making sure the newly shortened locks were artfully arranged. "Especially with blonds."

"It's a process, Hermione. It's all up here," he said, tapping his finger to his head.
The Crup had been a huge hit with everyone. An ecstatic Cal had promptly named him Christmas Crup, C.C. for short, and the group spent the rest of the late afternoon and early evening playing with the energetic puppy. Even Blaise and Neville had joined in, later engaging in a ferocious snowball fight with Harry, Draco and Cal, with C.C. chasing after the soft missiles and barking like mad.
Ron didn't move unwilling to let his out-of-practice friend duel a seasoned Auror alone, even if he was the Boy-Who-Lived.
Harry was staring at Cal, and the two of them were absolutely beaming. No one in the room could doubt the affection they felt for each other.
"Wasn't talking about me," he slurred, blinking sleepily as the Dreamless Sleep began to take effect.
"No, it's fine," Harry said, wheezing slightly when his sudden laughter made his chest ache. "I just had a thought about what the press will make of this." He wrinkled his nose, rolling his eyes in disgust. "Harry Potter: The Boy Who Lives and Lives and Lives."
"I'm not sure –"
ridiculous –
Not that they were actually feuding, since they'd have to be speaking for that. And neither man had asked Neville a single question about the other – it was everyone else who was driving him spare.
"Not at all," Neville answered, swinging an arm around Draco's shoulder in easy camaraderie. "It's completely necessary. The wards monitor the temperature, so I have enough time to cast the appropriate shielding spells in case of frost."
"They think he may have killed Lucius," Harry added, and Blaise's attention snapped back. If the man was that crazy, he needed to get to Caleum immediately.
She paused again, noticing Hermione’s discarded robes for the first time. They were still hanging over the back of the chair.
"Shall we get started, then?"

"Where did you even learn that spell?" Ron asked, his heart still pumping frantically, adrenaline coursing through his veins. He'd been so certain Harry had been about to die.
Draco set the bottle of wine aside and leaned back casually on his desk, crossing his arms.
Harry laughed out loud at the horrified expression on Ron's face.
"That's why he said not to make plans for dinner," Harry said softly, stepping back into his flat and placing the basket on the dining room table.
courting couple pass through to the third stage. It wasn't proper to have unmarried witnesses at the signing of the contract, so he hadn't seen it when it happened for Neville or Oliver.
The dark-haired wizard smiled, rummaging around in his pocket for a small plastic toy. He sat the PEZ dispenser on her desk, digging further until he found a photo as well.
Ron ducked down, running a large hand through Teddy's pink hair. The boy had some of his mother's Metamorphagus talents, though it was limited to the ability to change his hair and eye color. They didn't know if he'd be able to shift more as he aged and came into his magical powers or not.
Harry groaned, a thin film of sweat covering his bicep, which tightened as he gripped his cock harder. He bit his lip, his breathing harsh as he concentrated on keeping his rhythm steady as he stroked and squeezed his aching cock.
"You're driving me spare," Draco hissed, glaring at him from the corner. He'd pulled back the velvet curtain that separated the room from the Great Hall, watching the students surreptitiously.
Harry nodded, taking Draco's words for what they were – a gentle warning that his son would always come first. That was fine with Harry, reassuring even. Draco was a great father. It was one of the things Harry loved most about him.
Draco rubbed his chin, wondering if he should confess his attraction to the man when he talked with Gryffin. It seemed like such a small thing, but what if Potter and Gryffin were friends? They were both Gryffindors, so it was possible. How would it feel to be out on a date with Gryffin and run into the dark-haired wizard? Draco wrinkled his nose as he looked at his half-full glass of Scotch, resolving it would be his last. His thoughts were getting ridiculous.
"Who obviously didn't get this way –" she said, expansively gesturing to her stomach, "–on her own."
Harry's dark mood lifted a bit as he was reminded of the revision tables and homework schedules Hermione used to torment him with in school. Things hadn't changed that much. He supposed that was the danger of having one of your best friends as your agent. He offered her a contrite grin of apology. She smiled sweetly back.
Draco glared at him, using his wand to Banish the ash that had settled on the floor. He should have known Pansy would Floo Blaise and ask him to be there, too. She was such a chicken.
Draco wondered, pinching the bridge of his nose to stave off the ache behind his eyes.
quite loveable, as was Cal, Draco reasoned. And Harry was obviously comfortable with children, seeming to know exactly what to say and do to put Cal at ease.
"It's not fair!" Cal yelled, stamping his foot.
"Merlin, no," Ron grunted theatrically, and Draco wondered what had happened that would make Harry blush so spectacularly. He made a mental note to ask later.
"He's been talking about it all day, ever since I told him where we were going tonight," Draco said, tossing her another slice of the anise-flavored bulb.
"We'll see, I guess."
He looked up, scanning the restaurant for Blaise, on the off chance the perpetually late wizard had beaten him here. Draco felt his heart plummet when he saw Harry sitting with Weasley and Smith. Weasley was smiling, and Harry didn't look disturbed at all. Not the way someone who was sitting with a person he hated should look. Not after the tripe Smith had spread around the papers recently.
Harry just bet he had. Thankfully, he'd been living in a flat with Hermione – not at Grimmauld Place – when they'd dated after leaving Hogwarts, so his current residence remained a mystery to the Hufflepuff. Not that it had stopped Zach from stalking him in public whenever he could, or sending Owls every so often begging to get back together.
