Finian was with Hermione, but his guesses were so pathetically off the mark that Harry couldn’t even react to them. But then came Malfoy, who was alone since Michael Corner was currently being treated for caterpillar burn at the hospital in Mykonos.
“You can’t do this alone,” she finally said. “And I can’t help you cast any spells. You will need all the earth’s people to make this spell work again, even those without magic.”
And then he’d left Draco to the tender mercies of a Ministry that didn’t give a fuck about him, just because neither of them were adult enough to settle things after four fucking years.
When they finished, they set their plates aside; the trays had barely touched the table before they disappeared again, back down to the kitchens. It left Harry and Malfoy with nothing between them, no buffer they could use. It was just the two of them on Halloween night, locked away in Harry’s room with a couple glasses of liquor and an impossible decision before them.
She was so much like Hermione in that moment that he felt an odd, wistful pang. “A rose bouquet,” he agreed, and pointed his wand at the first apple. He bit his lip, concentrating, imagining a bouquet of red and purple roses. When he had it fixed in his mind, he swished his wand and let the magic roll out of him.
Things were fine, if stilted, between them. But ‘fine’ was a long way off from before, and the change in their relationship was something Harry still wasn't sure how to deal with. Was he allowed to be sad if the dissolution was such a slow, quiet thing? It wasn’t yet at the point of no return, was it? Could he save it, somehow?
“Come on, come, you fuck,” Harry breathes, and Draco does, hot and wet all over Harry’s fingers. It’s enough to send him barrelling over the edge, and he shudders, his hips thrusting erratically as he pumps himself into Draco’s arse.
Harry looked up from where he was reading over the end-of-term practicals schedule. Malfoy was waiting for him by the door.
“And you’re telling me you wouldn’t do the same if it was someone—someone you loved up there in one of those horrible ships?” Millicent demanded. “Fuck that, Potter. I aim to find out what Muggles know about getting abducted and how to get home again, and I know some of them are out there. If you’re going on telly, that’s where I want to be. I’ll take my chances. When do we leave?”
She shrugged. “I have another job. And we have two children who need a parent good at defensive magic. You’re better at it than me.”
“I know,” he said. It sucked, but if Hermione could handle Life After Family, then he could do Life After Malfoy. Even if he was the only one who knew it had been there to begin with. Merlin, fuck, it hurt to hold it all himself, but he wouldn’t betray Draco by telling.
Hermione, probably three. The divorce hadn’t finalised until Thursday, and Harry would be surprised if she’d gotten any sleep at all that night.
“I rather liked it,” Malfoy gasped. Harry thrust his hips forward in reply and Malfoy arched his neck back to give Harry better access. “The sun, the sand, the food.”
“I have,” said Harry. “But in my experience, it rarely involves sharing all your childhood fantasies. With me.”
“Merlin Jesus!” Harry swore, and Boot clapped him on the back in a super friendly manner, which only made it worse.
“What could be polluting it?” wondered Tracey Davis. “I know Diagon’s smoggy in the summer, but does steam power really affect all that much?”
Kreacher returns with the scotch, but upon finding Harry still reclined back against the ruins of his settee, seems to reconsider.
this is a flawed fic, the first wip I've written in (and posted while it was a wip) in like a literal decade. it had no outline. it had no beta. it is the raw fic, and I've presented it with all its flaws because it's the fic I needed to write right now. so despite its flaws, it tells the story the way I wanted it told way back in 2014 when I started it.
“You’ve been in Atlantis for weeks,” Malfoy said, ignoring him. “I know you’ve developed a…camaraderie.”
Draco laughed. “I prefer when it’s both. And it is both—even more so now that my expertise is suddenly so useful.”
Draco turns to him sharply, Hermione more considered. “Why would we want to drag more people into this nightmare?”
She rolled her eyes. “Not every mystery series is Agatha Christie, you berk. My new ones are middle-grade cosies, not children’s. Has Al forced you to read the first one yet? It’s set at Hogwarts, with a recurring detective; Kalla Penumbra, an eleven-year-old half-blood witch with a Muggle mother and pure-blood father. I’m having her grow up through the series but I expect I’ll continue it on after she finishes school.”
“Merlin have mercy,” Pomfrey said. She fell to her knees beside Harry and started checking his vitals. She took her time healing his nose. “Draco, did he manage to pull it in?”
Harry cackled. Hermione kicked him, and it made Draco move his legs back, which was the opposite of what Harry wanted. Suddenly bereft and feeling sort of cold about the leg area, he thought now would be a good time to pay Hermione back for that time when he’d been enjoying the feel of Draco’s leg against his own, and she’d ruined it. Which was just now. Harry had never been one to sit on an opportunity for revenge.
He should’ve. If Draco had known, maybe he would’ve been able to shake off the bond. But no… if that were possible, Hermione would’ve done it through sheer-bloody-mindedness already.
She tapped her quill against her notebook. “Yes, I think you’re right. Sometimes one must eschew talking and get straight to sexual attraction. Coral reefs are very sensual, so I understand wanting to see a school of men swimming around it in swim trunks, like very sexy fish without shirts on.”
be wonderful,” Hermione said. “Or, at least, it can be. Think of how great it would be for us if we got some good press from this. It might bring in business before we even finish with Padma and Theo’s wedding!”
love. She methodically ruminated on the loss she would feel if I were to die and channeled that misery into her magic, and into me. It created a tether to this world because her misery became
“Well,” said Hermione, at breakfast. She served herself some eggs, exchanged polite words with Neville and Luna further down the table. “Well.”
Draco stalked over to him, and whispered, “How the fuck am I supposed to know what days you’re taking off to drink and what days you’re taking off to be an adult? You take off every other week!”
. “In potions that need to get really hot to brew without hurting the ingredients, like dragon nutrient potions and flame retardants for brooms.”
“Muggles really aren’t into human sacrifice anymore,” Dudley said, perched on their shared desk and biting into a BBQ-flavoured ‘Keto fat bomb.’ “As a rule.”
The progression of pleasure curling inside him is so subtle that he isn’t aware of anything more than Draco’s mouth on his until he’s about to come. He cries out, scrunching his eyes together and Draco trails his lips up his jaw, nips at his ear. “You’re close.”
“Fuck, no,” Harry says before he can think better of it. He hears Draco choke next to him and panic rises in his chest before he can comprehend that he’s just swallowed his water wrong. Harry quickly pats him on the back and thinks, ‘Come on Potter, don’t accidentally kill your child, you moronic mouthpiece.’ Draco glares up at him, eyes watering as he gets his breathing back under control.
The sound of the shower turning on spurred him back into life. He shook his head and bent to lay his rolling luggage flat on the floor. He didn’t feel much like unpacking—as if he
“You’re odd,” Harry says absently, and the Healer seems to agree. He twirls his wand and the hologram spins, and then, wow, fuck, there are two heads. Fortunately on two separate bodies. Then, “Have you really never seen one before?”
Harry blinked, momentarily startled by the effect those words had on him. Who’d disregard a life like that because it couldn’t be used for some specific task? He reflected on how lonely it got without…Hedwig. Without Draco. He could use a new friend. And there was always value in that.
Harry shook his head. He could still see them. Little creature spirits were following along behind them, trailing after Draco and all the
Draco rolled his eyes. “I just got hired three months ago and found out I have to share a staffroom with Potter, after five years in house arrest. With my mother. And my father, when he wasn’t out doing embarrassing community service. And then seven more years when I couldn’t even step into my own country without seeing my reputation slashed in every single newspaper. I think I’ve earned some melodrama!”
Harry turns, gives Dennis a rare smile. He’s one of the only ones Harry will give a quote to. “Alright, Dennis?”
, even if I was stupid enough to try one. I need to pull it out, and I need to take this glove off to grab hold of it. So, untwist your fucking knickers and get the fuck out of the way, because I’m going to do it.”
to be thinking about something, like we don’t have time for anything but our current fascination. Everything else has to be completed as quickly as possible to make room for what’s important. Even those of us who were just re-sorted have it. It’s like a...instinctual assimilation. The first morning after, I started talking to the eighth year Slytherins about an article I’d read on Polyjuice Potion adjustments, and that brought up second year – in a very roundabout way, of course – and then they all wanted to rush off and try it for themselves. I ran after them to supervise, of course, but Millicent’d already cornered her cat and they’re starting a batch tonight. You really can’t talk a Ravenclaw out of any experiment.”
Harry shrugs. In truth, he’s only half-thought this through. He’s reckless and risk-taking, isn’t he? With both his body and his heart. And, he reckons, his fucking sanity, too.
There was someone who would probably know the answer. Someone who’d also know a lot about Atlantis. Someone who, given his upbringing, was probably also losing his shit in a very dignified manner in his own rooms.
Draco poured them both another shot instead. “How’s that potion?” he asked, eyeing it from a safe distance. “If you can brew drunk, then we can feel safe in you at least getting your NEWT. Whether you survive three years under Snape’s rule is another story. I’m afraid you might have it even worse than usual. He’ll be incredibly bored now that he’s dead.”
Harry chose not to continue that line of inquiry at present. He cleared his throat. “Have you set a date yet?” he asked, which seemed like a safer question.
When he’d taken as long as he feasibly could and had brought the tea things into the living room, he found Draco casually sat in the same chair he’d favoured every time he came to Harry’s before their… parting.
He did know that small, foot-long or thereabouts-length wands were relatively new to magic-working. Staves had been
After a few tries, he got something to work, and he tried that on what he could. It felt like being winded with every completed cast, but then, what else did he have to do? The aluminium cans were easy to break down into aluminum, manganese, chromium, and magnesium particles, which were fine to release into the water—the oysters would sort them out.
Apex applies the bonding spell to the doorway. At one time, it had been used over thresholds and wedding arches. There’s always been a symbolism of walking through a doorway together, and magic loves symbolism. On one side, Hermione stands, Harry right behind her; on the other Draco and a manic, angry Ron.
She gave him a small smile. “Minister Yogg elected to extend my sentence upon his election. I have but three years to go, Mr Potter. I’m nearly there.”
, let that happen. In desperation, he reaches into the flames, and his fingers close around the soft linen of Malfoy’s shirt. They both pause, startled. He hadn’t even realised that was possible to do in international calls.
take this risk because no matter what happened, they couldn’t just let magic die. Even if they all died in the process, magic had to live. So instead, he moved with the Hufflepuffs into the ritual diagram position, a complicated, perfect shape that could not be represented with Muggle geometry.
The train’s whistle sounded, signalling only two minutes left until departure. Children and parents scrambled to get them into the train, and windows all along the side opened, little hands and heads sticking out to say their goodbyes. Harry and Hermione were not the only ones with shiny eyes.
He sighed. “I spent four years wanting him before I had him, four weeks with him, and another four wanting him
Harry stepped off the gargoyle staircase and straight into Malfoy. His chest was warm and solid. Their mouths had nearly touched for a moment. Was it weird that he was sort of attracted to Malfoy simply because Malfoy hadn’t turned him in to Voldemort when the Snatchers got them?
“It’ll depend on how the Muggles react to it,” Blaise said. “They can take it as a gift, to make cleanup easier, or they could… not.”
Harry tried to keep them to reputable sources (as reputable as possible, anyway) but couldn’t help clicking through to links proclaiming
Malfoy Summoned a mobile from the Italian reporter. They had to stop for a dozen urgent questions from the assembled, but when they returned the items on offer, the reporters checked them over for strings and, finding none, returned to their seats dumbfounded.
He stuffs that in a knapsack with the Google Maps directions to Druella Rosier’s condominium and tries to get some rest before his Portkey in the morning. It takes him a long time to fall asleep. He’s not sure if it’s nerves or anticipation. For Harry, those things are usually one and the same.
Malfoy began a steady pace, drawing nearly all the way out before pushing home again, and Harry loved it. He held onto Malfoy’s hip with one hand, his other teasing at his own cock, his hips moving in time with Malfoy’s. Harry didn’t just lay back and take it; he actively sought it out, helped Malfoy fuck him as much as he fucked himself on Malfoy.
“Both, but the chlorine was rather high,” Harry said. “Makes you wonder what diseased thing keeps getting into their water that they have to dump so much bleach into it.”
But of course, Malfoy apparently only heard a fraction of what he said. “What do you mean you’re flexible?” he demanded.
Harry’d always wanted to see the Caribbean Sea. He was, at heart, a sea and sun sort of bloke. Draco was not, but he could get over it because they’d just spent a winter in Massachusetts, United States and Harry was well over the virtue of compromise.
The peace was broken some minutes later by a shriek of laughter from Albus’s bedroom. It was nearly eleven and Harry had already let him stay up way too late. Time for the annual Stunning Spell. He just wasn’t quite sure how to broach it.
Harry thought this over some. “Slytherins are groupy, too. Aren’t you accustomed to being around a lot of people?” Harry sure as hell wasn’t, but he was feeling a little looser from the wine, so it was all fine.
Then, they packed up the tent again and Apparated to the nearest decently sized town, where the population would be high enough that a group of unknown thirty-somethings wouldn’t be remarked upon. Falmouth in Cornwall had a magical population they wanted to avoid, so they went to Cardiff instead.
Harry held his arm out, guiding them quickly back through the street. He did a headcount, making sure they were all there. They fairly ran to the alley they arrived in, and Harry pulled the Portkey from his pocket. He’d never seen students catch on so quickly. They all grabbed it, he counted them one more time, activated it, and they were spinning back to Hogwarts in seconds.
She returned to the table and retook her seat, folding her hands in front of her. “But, Atlantis cannot comply. Our quest requires that all people of the world know of us.”
“How bloody humiliating,” she said when they were out of the common room. “No doubt some enterprising Slytherin will find them on the Quidditch pitch in the morning. A Sticking Spell later and everyone will know my bum size.”
“At least they’re still my greatest fear, if not my heart’s desire,” she muttered, but she wouldn’t look back at the corpses even to dismiss it. He nudged her aside, and approached the boggart. But then it morphed and—
He’d survived Voldemort, only to die embarrassingly by a Hufflepuff-Slytherin sharing his dorm room. He would probably be drooling on his pillow when it happened. He looked around for a friendly face – where was Neville? Harry hadn’t seen him since he and Professor Sprout rushed from the Great Hall. Was he contesting his sorting because Malfoy was here, too? That was an excellent idea; Harry should try it with McGonagall in the morning.
Harry gasps. He arches up, desperate for more contact, and the movement ignites something in Malfoy that has him sitting up, scrambling to undo all of Harry’s buttons. Harry hates that he wore an Oxford today when he could’ve already been out of a t-shirt. He’s so familiar with the buttons of Malfoy’s waistcoat, however, that he’s got it open in no time. He runs his palms over Malfoy’s stomach and finds it inhumanly hot to the touch.
Harry absolutely did not want that. He wanted the exact opposite of anything Luna, Dennis, Miles, or Javier might pick. He said, therefore the first thing that came to his mind. “Can we go snorkeling or scuba diving or whatever? At the Great Barrier Reef.”
At this, there was a loud, tinny crash from the portrait. Harry smirked at his knife set, pretended to take his time choosing between the #4 and the #5.
It was a Friday, and the Three Broomsticks was as boisterous as any Sunday during professional Quidditch season, only without the giant, single table. Harry wound his way through the tables, holding the glasses high to prevent spills, and towards the table Draco’d secured for them with a fierce glare and an unwavering sense of superiority. The couple necking there previously had cleared out lightning quick after that.
afraid of Muggles,” he said, remembering his conversation with Malfoy. He knew his own anxiety was illogical. “I mean, we have magic.”
Draco’s expression did change at those words; the studied blankness of before shifted into confusion before hardening again, all in the span of milliseconds. “Yes,” Draco finally said. “I believe that’s our best course of action.”
“Oh,” said Harry, softly. He furrowed his brow, feeling wrong-footed. Swallowing, he said, “How do I represent love?”
He tipped back the shot, failed to withhold a shivery, tongue-showing reaction to the firewhisky, and returned to the text. “Are you even tipsy?” he asked, as an aside.
Zabini smirked, and right then, Harry was certain that Ron and Zabini shared a moment across the Great Hall. His chest flared with jealousy. Ron was
Draco smirked, and there was a new spring in his step as Kyle led them to their bedroom for the duration. When they were alone, Harry set his backpack on the bed and turned to face Draco.
The Ministry man was getting irritated now, which Draco both enjoyed seeing and dreaded because he knew exactly what came from playing Hippogriff with cleverer people. Enjoyed it because Slytherin children didn’t even have tea parties without schadenfreude built in. Dreaded it because this was entirely too important to be fucked up by some Ministry flunky.
, how much he never got to say goodbye, how lonely he’s been his whole fucking life, even surrounded by friends who love him and a community who adores him. He swipes at his eyes as Sirius falls through the Veil again. It’s not enough.
The Mykonos episode was on and the camera was currently following Malfoy and Michael Corner around as they searched for clues to Harry’s heart in Delos.
The US and Russia both had nuclear warheads aimed at it, though North Korea’s weren’t believed to be able to reach that far, and the United States was losing its shit over the possibility a warhead would fall on Nebraska in the near future. The UK was being slightly more circumspect, but only slightly: almost every single ship in its navy was encircling the island, waiting. And so were militaries from every armed country in the world.
Like Malfoy’s erection, which is currently inches from Harry’s face. “What the fuck, Malfoy?” he says, but it comes out entirely more breathy than he meant for it.
“Fuck, I wish we could’ve finished our press conference,” Harry said. “Asked for volunteers then and waited to see if any of those reporters’ viewers had information on abductions.”
“Tell us how you feel, Harry,” said Luna, leading him off to a side room where he would be allowed to ‘ponder’ his choices. “You’re about to give out your first Snitches to the Seekers of Your Heart. Love is like a Quidditch match, don’t you find?”
Just this morning, the papers had run an article on a number of strange happenings in some wizarding villages surrounded by a lot of the affected flowers. Muggles were doing double takes as they strolled past, then shaking their heads, it had said. Unspoken: Muggles were seeing these villages for a moment or two; the wards were flickering. The Ministry was putting “all resources” into solving it, which meant they weren’t getting anywhere.
But he was eleven then, and eleven-year-olds didn’t understand how dysphoric life could become when you had everything you needed only fingerlengths from you, but it would be another twelve-hundred years before that person wanted you back. Harry would wait twelve-hundred years if his body was up for it.
In that moment, Harry felt for the first time in the Wizarding world proper, the novel and unexpected experience of meeting someone who had no shitting idea who he was. He smiled genuinely, if tiredly.
“Pay me with your acquaintance instead,” says the vendor. “I have enjoyed our conversations this past week and you like my Manticore. I would like for us to be friends.”
They were quiet for a few minutes, listening to Teddy talk, and then softly, Draco added, “I only worked there for the people I loved anyway.”
If Malfoy’s a Veela, is that why Harry’s been unable to stop thinking of him for seven ruddy years? Harry feels all the blood rush away from his limbs with a sudden burst of shock; it’s a flight response he hasn’t felt since the war—but if Malfoy’s a Veela…
“Calcination,” Harry said, watching intently. He bit his lip, waiting for the wards to change colours with the process. “There are minerals in there that act like flux. I figured it out when Draco said the stone had reverted to mica instead of feldspar. It’s not just metamorphic. It’s polymorphic. All the gneiss around here, in Scotland, it’s like...it’s like it
"Bite your tongue, Weasley,” Draco said, without heat. “You won’t get the honour of my company, anyway. I’ve come to take Potter to Hogsmeade."
“Harry!” Padma said, before Harry could begin to feel guilty about the systemic immorality of the Ministry, and how they apparently never trusted Draco unless Harry was there to supervise him. Padma embraced him briefly and then stepped back, hands on his shoulders while she scanned his face.
But who was Harry Potter, really? It—wasn’t who he was right now. He was still living the life that wizarding Britain carved out for him. He was getting his NEWTs, then he’d probably end up at the Aurory whether he really wanted to or not, just because it was expected of him and that’s where Ron was. Then he’d marry Ginny, and they’d recreate that tragic, idyllic family immortalized in marble down in Godric’s Hollow.
was how out of touch he was with Magical politics. And yet, Murdoch had still insinuated Harry was just the other side of a coup.
When Snape was gone, Harry’s rooms suddenly felt a lot emptier. He knew Ms Danger was still around, probably draped over some book, trying to predict what the ending would be. She tended to hide from strangers, and had gone invisible as soon as Ginny arrived, although she would reveal herself to Luna every now and again, and was very happy to be visible around Albus.
“Harry, Hermione, you remember my good friend Millicent Bulstrode,” said Draco to the both of them. “She’s recently divorced her wife of four years and finds herself at loose ends this holiday season.”
Draco made a short sound in the back of his throat. His fingers clenched against the edges of the ticket. He cleared his throat. “Thank you. It’s…brilliant.”
“I’ve been inside once,” Harry said, reluctantly. “It’s really rude, but I think I can Apparate us in without landing in the middle of the china cabinet.”
There was a ruckus outside the house, then a knock on the door. Petunia froze. “It’s the press again. Ignore it.”
Harry nodded, fought down a smile. Of course Malfoy would want to go first. Malfoy looked as though he expected more argument from Harry and was discomfited when he didn’t receive it, though he recovered soon enough.
Annoyed, Harry unshrunk his lead cauldron and dug through his potions kit for the sample bottle of vitriol base that came with every standard kit. It was dusty and still had sealing wax around the cork, but appeared fresh enough when Harry opened it. He tipped it carefully into the cauldron and adjusted the flame beneath it.
“Mandy, Wayne, and I have come up with an area-of-effect shield that can take large area measurements of magical energy,” Su Li said. “The whiz-bangs are stated on the package to produce one thousand joules of magical energy each. We should be able to take the differential created when set off inside a sample containment area and from there determine if Addolgar’s theory is sound.”
Neither Ron nor Yaxley chose to elaborate on what that deeper motivation was. Harry drank his tea, feeling dazed.
On the night of the Seventh and final Struggle, tensions were high. This one was traditionally performed at Stonehenge, so there was no need for caterers or venue rentals. In fact, there wasn’t much of anything for Harry and Hermione to do except show up in support, as friends. This ceremony was between the couple and magic itself.
Severia butted up against his thigh, then popped herself up on his lap and curled up next to Hermione, purring. “Sevsy, don’t be a nuisance,” Harry murmured. She blinked slowly at him and then returned to cuddling Hermione.
“Ms Jones,” said Blaise. “Have you been working with your Muggle counterparts on the media coverage?”
. Harry lifted Draco’s chin, and then pressed his combined fists down onto his sternum, humming brokenly. His heart beat was non-existent. He could barely remember the song he was supposed to use to keep count, but it didn’t matter because it wasn’t working, even when he leant down, closed Draco’s nose, and breathed everything he had into his lungs.
“This blood spell business,” said Murdoch, “is bad. You don’t even know how badly this will keep us from trading with MUS.”
Harry’s stomach chose that moment to growl and he realised he’d forgotten, in his haste, to eat more than a toastie that morning. What a time to remember.
The Queen stared at the American representative—he was still looming, as if he had no idea what personal space meant.
Harry looked around the office, forehead wrinkling with indecision. It was always easier to start something than it was to finish it. Gryffindor rashness only took one so far, and sometimes the bravery never kicked in. “I don’t know why—I just. I watched San Francisco,” he said. He looked to Malfoy, desperate for a reaction.
Dudley took his mobile back and stuffed it in his trouser pocket. “I don’t know,” he said, his eyes focused anywhere but on them. “But it sure as hell scared me. I don’t think I’ve ever felt so scared in my life, not even when me and Harry were stalked by those Dementors.”
The after party’s at a new boutique hotel in Diagon. Everything’s blue and purple underlighting and stark, black marble. Harry isn’t overly impressed with the scheme but Luna handles all this stuff and it’s more important that he doesn’t have to deal with it than it is he like the place.
Harry sat down on the grass next to Draco, closer than he would’ve dared before. But things were different now. They’d both watched the Sun rise over redwoods and seen magic in the seas. Not together, but somehow still an experience shared. That was enough.
The file’s colour-coded Burnt Orange, but Harry really gives zero fucks, and besides, he normally has Scarlet clearance, so fuck this Goldenrod shit. The password for Burnt Orange clearance is apparently the same all over the Ministry. Or perhaps they just haven’t deactivated his clearance in London. Either way:
The sound of running water came as they travelled deeper into the caves. It was a low whoosh by the time Galene brought them to the Queen.
“And the Pacific oysters will be ready then, too,” Quincy continued. “They were just as easy as this Bay variety, but we’ll need three million to make any difference.”
“So why would another, advanced species take so much time, energy, and resources to come to us? Your question of whether or not it’s bad that someone is here, visiting us, well…” She shivered. “Well, it’s just hard to imagine they’ve come for anything
But Draco was still looking at him in that careful, intense way, and there was nothing for it anymore. It wasn’t enough to come any longer. He had to know what it was like to feel connected to the person he loved when he did.
“Right,” Harry says into the resulting emptiness. “Right.” Time to pull his shit together. He’s an adult. He’s been through worse. He feels… remotely… human again. Or at least devoid of the dagger-sharp edges of misery. He can do this.
“And of course, this year’s batch of apprentices—Hermione Granger and Millicent Bulstrode, both of whom Professor Vector has agreed to take on; Harry Potter, fulfilling a rather unconventional apprenticeship under Professor Snape; Luna Lovegood, whose remarkable proposal convinced Professor Flitwick to take her on without a gap year; Neville Longbottom, under Professor Sprout, Emrys Cadwallader, now entering his second year under Professor Hagrid, and Draco Malfoy, who will be continuing the most beautiful and majestic magic of Transfigurations, under myself.”
Dudley got up, pulling his mobile from his pocket, and stepped into the back garden. The rest of them were still stuck in that strange, nervous energy where they didn’t know whether to run or fight. Draco’s eyes kept moving back to the telly. Atlantis was still burning. At the bottom of the screen. A ribbon of text scrolled by:
“Ronald!” Molly says, at the same time as Hermione smacks the back of his head. Draco delivers a scathing, yet still somehow polite enough for a Weasley Weekend, rejoinder and life continues apace.
“Mr Potter, I do commend you for your—ah, determination. But apprenticeships in Potions are incredibly hard to come by. There are so few Masters left in Britain, and Professor Slughorn won’t be taking anyone on. He’s retiring.”
Harry nodded. “Yeah. I was afraid I’d fuck up everything. We had this idyllic little enemy-ship and if I let myself drift a bit, I could imagine that it was real. That we sat and talked in your lab while you worked because it was part of
Ron scrunched his nose, then went over to the icebox and grabbed a couple of beers for them. He popped the corks, turned back, saw that Teddy and Rosie were staring at him, and then grabbed two pumpkin juices from the box, too.
“I’m trying,” he says, knowing it’s not nearly enough. “Fuck if I know what to do though. I don’t work with manufactured love. That’s Mitchell’s spec.”
And then came number eleven. Number eleven was not a great flyer, Harry could see, even as the wizard approached. Probably not a up for a Quidditch match date, he thought with some disappointment. And then the wizard lowered his hood and Harry saw that he was not a wizard after all. Twenty-three suddenly had meaning.
“You’re wanking,” says Harry, and he does have the presence of mind to glare up at Malfoy now, but it’s ruined when their eyes meet because Malfoy’s gaze is pure fuck-me. Pupils blown so wide the grey is missing entirely, mouth parted, lips slick with spit.
If there’s one thing he’s certain about, it’s that he cannot survive without Malfoy with him. He doesn’t even know how he made it through the first six years of Hogwarts without accidentally killing himself. Malfoy’s been a staple in his life since eighth year Potions class and that day Harry would’ve blown his head off without Malfoy’s quick interception of a fatally incorrect ingredient.
Harry nodded. He didn’t need to be told that. “You’re brilliant,” he added, in case there was any doubt. Draco flushed, and they were quiet again, staring down at the three perfect stones.
Draco exhaled in a rush, walked away, then came back, as if he had no idea what to do with himself. “No, we can’t, Harry.”
“No, I feel…exposed,” Harry said. “Really antsy. I just want to grab Al and go hide in a bunker somewhere most days.”
“Yes! And what’s more—wands create channels. Natural magic flows freely, like a cloud. But wands direct magic in a single direction—like mini-leylines. If we adapted this spell to wands, we could direct the magic to conduits that would amplify it
“Well, take a break and get us all lunch. We like the shawarma from the Muggle woman with the blue cart, and pick up a few of those bread baskets from the magical man on the bicycle since we didn’t get croissants this morning.”
Harry’s defeat of Voldemort had been touted as if he and the Dark Lord had been ‘frenemies’, while Hermione’s work with magical creatures had been ‘a revolution waiting to happen’. They had nothing on Blaise, so they put him forward as a do-nothing, while both Malfoys were written as entitled peerage—probably true. Only Padma and Lee escaped without negative comment. Lee was a mediator and award winning public relations person—of course he knew how to stay out of spin. And Padma was, well, Padma. Who could say a bad word about her?
The Chieftess shrugged. “Heat grows where heat wants to grow. We needn’t do anything but encourage it.”
Harry narrowed his eyes. “He’s not going to get woozy during the ceremony, is he? Because we’ve got the press here, and so help me, Malfoy, if we get a bad review because the groom can’t stand up straight—”
“If they haven’t got magic,” said Millicent, “then how the fuck would they look like us?” She shook her head. “No, I don’t think they’re pretending to be people—not in that sense anyway. I think they’re studying us to
Luna gave him an unimpressed look. Without hesitation, she pointed her wand at Albus and gently cast an Adult Conversation spell over his ears, so Albus would only hear them chatting about the most boring stuff imaginable.
“You were a minor. They were expunged. Now eat up and I’ll clean your teeth for you before you see the Minister, you pillock.”
. Harry watches them, his own tension gone, unravelled like all the threads of fate that kept him alive until he was eighteen. It was supposed to just be him and Draco working together, but Hermione is a slave to the prospect of a study group and Draco is in no position to say no to her. Nor does he appear to want to.
“Be good, champ,” Harry said. “And do a spectacular job. Let me know right away if you have any trouble with… with any of your studies. Make lots of friends, learn lots of magic, and kick everyone else’s arse. Except Rosie. Tie with Rosie for the top.”
“My teeth were still unfortunate,” Hermione said, and they nodded, remembering that travesty. “And Ron’s arms and legs were about twice as long as the rest of him.”
Merlin, that only made Harry harder. He hadn’t thought it was possible. “Master Malfoy,” he murmured. “I like the way that sounds. Perhaps tonight I shall, but now, Master or not, you’ll do what I say, and I say
“People always thought Hermione was a goody two-shoes,” Harry adds, mind numb as he enters, shivering to feel Draco’s body so close to his own, even without touching. “But she’s always been ruthless. It’s saved my arse before. Maybe it’ll save yours now.”
Draco’s thrusts started speeding up. Harry closed his hand around Draco’s, tightening his grip over Harry’s cock. They jerked him off together as Draco pounded into him from behind and the water swayed them against the sea anemones.
Harry rolled his eyes, walked past Draco to the stairs. “Well I do. And I like you, too, sometimes, so if you want to get some tonight, you’ll be nice to your family. Coming? Hermione texted that she and Padma were going to pick up Indian.”
Harry sighed. He looked at the baby again, feeling his pathetic, unused parental instinct flaring up. “I suppose so.”
“NoMajes,” said Lee, Padma, and Hermione. Harry didn’t bother to point out that they’d all been using the word, too. He shared a smirk with Draco.
But its face. Draco couldn’t stop staring at it, looking for similarities, for differences, for the one feature that would make him understand how humans had come from these beings.
Marietta slopes in with the glonde-coloured suit originally slated for Malfoy. Having seen Dean’s final makeup decisions before lunch though, Harry shakes his head. Malfoy’s cool-toned, and it was only Harry projecting that he was best-looking in gold. Because Malfoy’s expensive like that, even in personality. But platinum is cool, too, and much more precious. Like Malfoy, who’s also more precious than gold.
, and I’ve got to fucking fix it first, so if it’s okay with you, get the fuck out so I can sort this.”
recognition for it. Almost against his own will, he looked back at the lights coming from the town of Hogsmeade.
Harry, Hermione, and Lee did not end up reaching their liaison's office on Pennsylvania Avenue until after five. She gave them a very flat look when they opened the door and stepped inside, pushing her glasses on top of her greying head and setting a ballpoint pen down on the blotter with decisive movement.
Millicent grabbed them a table with a good view of the telly, made a show of pulling out her notebook and—amazingly—a biro, and Harry wondered just how long she and Dudley had been dating. He’d thought only a few months, but then she kept surprising him with a profound and unexpected knowledge of some part of Muggle life.
Harry and Draco shared a meaningful look. Teddy continued on: “You can go work at Gringotts instead! It’s way cooler! They’ve got dragons and gold and math!”
Because for some stupid reason, his plus-one no longer cared to speak to him. It was just a little love, for Merlin’s sake. Never killed anyone. Probably. Might start with Harry, actually.
Her magic feels like it’s leaking downwards, into the floor, into nothing. To Fred, Harry realizes. She’s leaking out her lifeforce to try to bring him back, but it won’t work. You can’t resurrect the dead.
“We went to the Atlantis—secretly,” said Draco. “Severus asked Potter to leave his portrait there when we went with the task force, and he got us a meeting with the Queen. She…she knew all of this. She was right.”
“Malfoy, stop swearing at the head table, for Merlin’s sake,” said Neville, sitting down beside Harry.
Draco’s mouth flattened in an angry line. “You’ve heard my terms. Take them or leave them. What will it be?”
And there was something else, too: The way Draco had gasped for air down there. Had the Merrows done the same thing when their waters died? Had the frys and the fingerlings accidentally swum into hypoxic waters and suffocated without knowing why they couldn’t breathe or what to do?
He frowned, staring down at a growing splotch of green ink on his Charms essay. “What kind of magic do you think is best?”
“And he never told you,” Ron deduces. Harry shakes his head. Ron stands as if he’d been pulled by magic. “And you’re just going to bond yourself to him with a spell based on
McGonagall rolled her eyes so strongly that Harry could see the action all the way from his spot at the Gryffindor table. “Because, Mr Potter, school has been in session for a mere two days, and already three houses are in a constant war with the fourth. I won’t have it. I know in previous years that a blind eye has been turned towards these ‘little tiffs,’ but you will all soon find that this Headmistress shan’t be playing those games.”
Harry followed Malfoy in, and the room was so dark it was like Malfoy’s hair was the only thing that reflected light, the only bright point in a dusty, damp abyss. He whispered a word, the barest hint, and light radiated out from the stones, its origin invisible. Harry felt a little thrill of—something—at the display. Malfoy could do wandless magic.
“Well,” Hermione says primly, “Apex will just have to go fuck themself. You can’t impede the search for knowledge. Even
“Scottish Folds,” Potter said, seemingly keeping himself from laughing by the barest of margins. Draco didn’t know what was so funny; they were perfectly good cats.
Their food comes then. Harry’s zucchini tart is actually pretty bloody amazing so the bitter jealousy of Malfoy’s parmesan cheese disappears in short order. Malfoy catches his free hand beneath the table and grins at him around a spoon of mushroom soup. He's got a little crème fraîche on his lip that Harry would be all over if Ron weren't at the table.
Harry leant back in his chair. Now he could see where the pieces could fall into place, but he was still waiting for Ron to rub it in. “I see.”
Harry rolled his eyes. Millicent was enjoying his tea and he was cowering in a corner. “Hermione, can I—?” He gestured vaguely, trying to impart ‘hold you’ without actually saying or gesturing ‘hold you’. She merely stared at him, so he approached, and when her claws remained retracted, he carefully picked her up, sliding a hand beneath her ribs to feel her pulse. It was hammering.
“I would like to join you for that,” Narcissa said primly. “I’m sure I can offer something to help.”
She sighed, removed her glasses, rubbed her eyes. “How much will I regret this?” She looked up at them, questioning.
Draco shrugged, and swirled his glass, sending a little orange rind spinning. “It’s…nice. My mother used to say there was life in wine. I wonder what she’d say about adulterated wine.”
Harry told his magic. It dawdled for a moment, not sure whether or not he was worthy of it anymore since it had come so far out, but Harry firmed his mouth and said again:
“Oh, your best yet, babe,” Hermione says, remarkably convincing. Harry’s more sure than ever that she’s got some sort of spy training from the Unspeakables and she’s been impersonating him in strip clubs and he really doesn’t want to know anything at all about her and Ron’s sex life, but unfortunately the proof that they have one is presently drooling green mush.
“We don’t have a lot of time tonight,” Alick said, “so we’re going to have to do what Hufflepuff does best, among many other things Hufflepuff does best: multi-task.”
The shopkeeper whistled. “There are a few here and there, I’ve heard, but they aren’t really for sale to the
“Hello, young Albus Severus.” Snape was the only person dedicated to using Al’s full name. Harry suspected he thought each repetition would make Harry and Gin regret their choice, but Snape had been dead far too long if he thought either of them were the type to have regrets.
Harry stood up, drained the dregs of his tea, and took his aunt’s arm. Her Apparitions were not the most talented, but they were very precise. What she lacked in magical strength, she made up for in sheer bloodymindedness. She delivered him safely behind the press dais erected in Trafalgar Square, and returned once more for Draco and then the kids.
Draco presses his shoulder into Harry’s, his head tilting against him. “You broke the cycle,” Draco tells him.
And then she dove into a quick back-and-forth with the two guards, all three of them generous with their hand gestures. After several moments, Penelope nodded to the guards and returned to the group.
He looked around the room, and saw that roughly half were upping their heat and another half lowering theirs. Malfoy was lowering his. Hermione was raising hers. Two paths, each equally valid in different circumstances. But what was
“Come on, Professor,” Harry said. “I haven’t exploded anything in weeks. You said I’d get to explode something at least every week.”
Draco nods, lips pursed tightly. Draco’s hand slides into his and the feel of Draco’s palm against his own requires of Harry a deep breath and closing his eyes to keep from exploding in a mess of useless magic, but he holds it together. They step through the threshold together and… nothing.
Harry floated through the whole week. Draco sat with him in class and at meals, and gave him secret, seductive little grins when no one was looking. Terry danced him around the common room when Fille Dagwood caught the snitch and racked Harry 150 league points, and Harry wasn’t even annoyed. He wrote Ron two letters. He went down to have tea with Hagrid and ate a rock cake. Snape had nothing derogatory to say about the colour or consistency of his drunkenly-brewed Liver Repair Elixir. On Thursday, Hermione asked him what a
McGonagall looked pained. “Speak to Professor Vector and me later, Granger. Any other questions? No? Good. I expect all of you to be present and on time for the Welcoming Feast tonight. Potter—no kneazles at the Head Table. She’ll have to stay in your rooms.”
Neither the Queen nor the alien were breathing. Potter stared down at them both, looking so sad Draco feel the pain in his own body. He was up to a minute and forty seconds.
They climbed out of the briefcase with Draco’s help and Harry dusted his trousers off. Camera flashes had been going off the whole time, but it was the moment he and Mr Koetsu stepped out of the briefcase that Harry really noticed. He was dizzy, trembling. Low blood sugar, Hermione might say. Adrenaline, Ron might.
There was a knock on his hotel room door and Harry looked towards it, wide-eyed. Luna entered before Hermione could hide in the bathroom, and her expression turned serious. “Harry, you can’t sleep with any of the contenders before the end of the programme,” she said. “How many times must I remind you?”
“Annoyed can be dour,” she said, pointing the tines of her fork directly at his chest. “And he’s been tonnes less annoying than he was when we were all at school—I guess house arrest can do that, even for a Malfoy. Barely even makes a handful of snide remarks through the course of a conversation. What have you got to be annoyed about? You didn’t spend seven years in a common room with him.”
The Thestrals are invisible to most people, thank Merlin. Well, actually, Harry doesn’t give a fuck. Whether or not people see Thestrals stopped being his problem ten years ago. If they’re invisible, then more of his collection will be visible; if they aren’t, then at least they coordinate well.
“The fairies are weird this week, aren’t they?” Harry said to Millicent the morning the students were to arrive.
“Hmm,” said Malfoy, finally coming fully into the room. He leant his hip against Harry’s desk and observed him double-checking permission slips against the roster.
“Good,” Harry said, through a gasp. He threw his head back and shuddered. Draco’s mouth was on his neck, following his fingers down as he loosened each button, kissing the exposed skin left behind.
“I have manias,” Ron whispers, licking his lips. He settles himself on his knees, hands rubbing restlessly against his jeans. Harry watches the movement with a familiar detachment. He’s seen this maneuver before. He knows what follows it.
She nodded, said, “Then again, if the exchange rate’s good now, maybe he’ll want to bring some Muggle profits back over. Could be good for us.”
Draco crawled up after him, and Harry was mesmerised by the curve his back made as he bent down to slide their mouths together again. Harry reached down and drew his fingers around the edge of Draco’s waistband, hesitant, asking permission. He felt Draco’s abdomen contract at the contact, and it flooded him with desire—
The years of possibility flashed before his eyes, just as life had not done when he died in the forest. Draco Malfoy could have so easily been his friend from the beginning. Could have more than adequately taken Ron’s place all the times Harry had needed him. Draco Malfoy would never have abandoned Harry for the Tri-Wizard Tournament; would never have left him and Hermione alone in the woods in winter. Draco Malfoy would never have worried that he was second best to the Boy Who Lived.
Harry doesn’t know. He feels like he never knows anymore. Shaadhon has calmed down now that all of the magic has been dampened and is currently sniffing a dead seagull lying further down. Harry pulls out a deck of Cards Against Humanity and raises his eyebrows at Draco. Maybe it’ll help to settle his nerves at the least.
He was dizzy with the charge of magic in the air, with emotions running high all around him. He found himself laughing, delighting in the way light burst forth from his hand just by joining it to another Hufflepuff’s. He hadn’t even needed word or wand, just the knowledge that when he touched another member of his house and intended for there to be light, there would be light.
“Yes—I can definitely do it. Obviously.” Harry’s fingers clenched in his robes again as he was reminded of Draco teasing him about the way and frequency he said ‘obviously’ now.
Malfoy was developing a lovely tan, Harry thought as he approached. He couldn’t see what his structure was yet, but he could see a lovely view of his bum as he bent over it, applying the finishing touches.
“I’m glad you’re ready,” said Hermione. “I thought I was going to have to come rouse you, but I’d been putting it off because I was afraid Malfoy might be down there without his trousers, and I just don’t think I should have to deal with something like that, Harry. I really don’t.”
Harry shrugged. “It was a couple years after the war, remember? And I’d been wondering how you were… if you liked teaching. I guess I kind of… missed you.”
“Yes, yes, yes,” Draco panted, barely audible. His chest arched up. Harry bent to drag his tongue over it. He circled his tongue around a nipple, then took it in his mouth and sucked. Draco made a sound that Harry would now hear in his head every time he wanked, forever.
“Accepted,” Neville said, and cruised right back into his train of thought: “Proactive action was maybe not the best choice of words. But the Ministry’s not done anything to fix the wards. Of course we should get some leeway in order to keep to the Statute of Secrecy – which is, by the way, required by the United Magical Nations anyway so their sanctions are ridiculous – but our first priority should be stopping and eventually reversing the progression of the disease.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “I can be good at more than one thing. Just like you can be average at more than one thing.”
—?” Harry manages to get out before his voice fails again. The shock is maybe too much stress for his throat just yet.
He caught sight of the microwave when he passed and grimaced. It was nearly midnight. Hermione was bound to be up at first light banging on the lid of his trunk to get him up and working. Ah, well. It was worth it. He turned the oven on and selected a couple of pies from the icebox. Then he grabbed the kettle and poured in some fresh water from his wand, rather than the over-chlorinated sludge that came from the tap. The oven chirped that it was ready. Harry slid in two pies and pulled down some cups from the cupboard.
Harry would’ve died happy then, if he hadn’t known he was the best of two shitty choices. But he and Draco were a good match. Two people so afraid of being alone they’ll believe a lie until it’s a reality. The Department has been good for them after all.
But mostly, he was relieved they’d stopped suggesting they take the alien to the ICW. No one had any faith in that body, or the Ministry, to keep the UFOs’ inhabitants from killing them all. Draco finished his chocolate in silence, having nothing to add. It seemed like ages before the staff broke up to try to get an hour or two of sleep before morning.
He nodded, but McGonagall was already on her way out. Being Headmistress was apparently a rather busy affair. He supposed that was to be expected, especially today.
Harry felt his eyes begin to burn again, and he had no idea why, because Draco was awake, and that was
He swung the door fully open and flicked the lights on. Sconces lit all around the room and the light bounced off stainless steel surfaces, glimmering like little bonfires against the antique wood panelling of the walls. Harry’s favourite set of crystal beakers, a gift from Hermione’s Mum and Dad, were shimmering on his desk — more a decorative accent than anything he used with any regularity. He was afraid of breaking them.
I get the okay from your supervisor. Don’t contact me again if you don’t hear from me. I’m not going to bother sending you updates if I don’t hear back from London.”
“I hate his name,” Malfoy said, sighing. “It’s hard for me to even pull him up in my mobile contacts.”
“Just in time!” she said, directing him to the centre of the amphitheatre where he could no doubt be filmed from hundreds of hipster angles. “Now, I want everyone to take the quill and pad of parchment next to their seat and take a few moments to write down what you’ve found and what it means to Harry.”
Snape paused, interested despite himself. Hesitantly, he returned to the front of the painting, peering down into the cauldron below. “At a slow, red fire, Calcination will occur,” he observed. “You are within degrees of it.”
It was blurry, like one of the Impressionist paintings that Severus sometimes used when he visited Astoria’s office while Draco was up there chatting with her. A grey-blue and clouded background with a long, sharp, isosceles triangle in front. Like if someone had tossed a fanged frisbee in the air.
He watched Hermione scroll through her newspaper for a while, sipping his coffee and trying to remember how to be human.
The airport was about twelve miles long in Harry’s estimation. It felt like that, anyway, as they walked from Terminal M, out of Security, and towards the signs pointing to Metro. In the end, they almost missed the kiosk leading to the bank. Lee happened to spot it when he bumped into a Muggle businessman too busy staring at his mobile to watch where he was going.
The Chieftess sneered, and Harry saw that all of her teeth were quite pointed. “We have found that we are easy to ignore if we don’t make ourselves impossible to ignore. Land-humans think that we will just go away if they don’t come near the water, and that is probably true. If we don’t get help, we will all die out. We’ve lost seven fry this year alone from suffocation or choking, and my sister’s fingerling was snatched by a white shark last season when we were forced into the ocean. My
Ron'd come home from a particularly bad case not long after making full Auror, covered in the blood and other stuff of his former partner. Harry remembers because he’d been sitting on their couch with Hermione, fixing the hem on one of his jumpers while they watched Gordon Ramsay bitching on the telly. Ron had walked straight passed them into the kitchen and Vanished everything in the icebox that had even touched another living thing. None of them have eaten animal products since that day because Harry and Hermione were stupid enough to promise when Ron, pale-faced and hysterical, begged them not to.
“Dislike,” she says, her voice quite small indeed. “Perhaps something… even stronger. But there had to be a certain camaraderie there, too. A certain… I don’t know, Harry. It’s so hard to explain. In essence, we had to both hate and like each other. Which feels… very awful. I didn’t realize I still disliked Malfoy after working with him all these years. Not really. I thought he just
“Ahh, you’re here!” called Padma. She waved them over. “Welcome to Maine. That’s Canada. You’ve practically been to another country now.”
hosting New Year’s. His heart clenched in want. Someday they’d have that, he thought. If things kept going so well. He really, really hoped they did.
“He’s getting weird,” Harry said. “The more I think about it, the more baffled I am that he could’ve felt threatened by me enough to threaten to fire my friends and their families just to prove a point. I mean, I hadn’t even been in the paper in months.”
“Yep,” said Ron. He beamed at Harry and Harry hated him even more for being so ridiculously photogenic. What a twat. Maybe if Harry was that photogenic he could’ve found a nice bloke on his own by now. “But you know what’ll comfort me in the long, lonely nights I’ll spend with Hermione watching your suffering on our magicbox?”
in regards to the Statute, with children. The only thing I can compare it to is parents telling kids not to take sweets from strangers—and this really alarming, almost damned feeling you get near a stranger after your parents first tell you.”
“I never really wanted to do it. I just wanted to be Draco’s partner. I just never realised it until Draco wasn’t my partner anymore. I can’t do it if he’s not my partner and I can’t stand the thought of him being in danger. I don’t want to see it every day, and I would if I worked with him again.”
When they finally reached their Airbnb on F Street (NW—apparently there were four F Streets in Washington, DC) the sun was just ducking below the horizon. Lee got the key from beneath a cement frog and unlocked the front door. A blast of cold, central air hit them as soon as the door swung open and, as one, they sighed in relief. They were not accustomed to these American Augusts.
Harry’s heart fluttered in his chest. He felt such a rush of love for Draco in that moment. He was doing something he hated, something he really, really didn’t want to do… because it was necessary to save the whole. God, what Hufflepuffs they were.
Harry chewed his lip. It had been two weeks since he’d seen Draco at Padma and Nott’s vow ceremony, and stood with Draco in his vault, and he couldn’t sit still any longer. He knew they were supposed to be taking it slow, that he and Draco were really supposed to be limiting their ‘dates’ to the Struggles ceremonies so that they could both adjust to their new status.
“Oh for Ceridwen’s sake,” Draco muttered. He slammed his wardrobe shut, and turned to face them. “I’ve had enough. Could the two of you be more Hufflepuff?”
“Harry, you didn’t!” she whispered, leaning in to keep any of the ever-present Slytherins from hearing their conversation.
“Yes it is.” Malfoy closed his eyes again and proceeded to completely ignore Harry while he set about with his meditation.
“Daddy!” she exclaimed, in a voice much like Hermione’s at that age. “You aren’t supposed to tattle!”
She bends down and wraps her arms around him. Still bemused, terrified, and startled, Harry hugs her back on autopilot. He hears her sniff and then feels little drops of wetness hit his neck. He wrinkles his nose. Just then, Ron sets Rose on the cosy chair by the door and steps forward to intercept. Because he is an amazing best mate.
The guards watched all of this warily, spears ready to run any of them through—or perhaps to cast a vicious spell at them. The records on Atlantis had been slim, even with Malfoy resources at hand.
Harry watches Draco’s eyes widen, his body stiffen, and slowly, Harry turns towards the door of Draco’s room. He feels his face drain of blood. Ron is there, eyebrows still raised in query after his suggestion, and next to him, Hermione has Rose, who is sucking fiercely on a dummy, propped on one hip. But, even worse, behind them stand the Malfoys, who look too shocked to even speak.
“Christ,” Potter whispered. His voice cracked on the word, and he swallowed around it, shook his head as if to clear it.
He threw a wave over his shoulder as he ushered the kids out. Despite Ms Williams’s prodding, Ms Lovecraft was noticeably anxious stepping out onto Charing Cross.
“Then we have to tie it off,” Harry said. “Make it permanent, so MACUSA can’t take it down even if they wanted to.”
“Well,” said Hermione, bracingly. She put her hand to her stomach and leaned against the International Arrivals dais gate, her face more green than tan. They apparently didn’t stock courtesy Ill-Effects Bags for international Portkey travellers on this side of the Atlantic.
Millicent rolled her eyes at him over her shoulder. “If your constitution can’t handle it, then feel free to leave the room. I know this fucker speaks at least one human language. It has to.”
He and Draco had only moved into their new house last week, but he was determined that they should host New Year’s here this year. It felt important, like it was something too long in the making. This was the rightful end to a wide circle that had begun the moment he first saw Draco holding a wine glass in Andromeda’s kitchen… really
She wasn’t at the Ravenclaw table at lunch or dinner so the only other place he knew to look for her was the library. Thankfully, she didn’t disappoint. She was at a table full of Ravenclaws, but she saw him come in, and immediately rushed over. Hermione led him into the stacks, by the World Geography section.
Mr Granger perked up at this. “I bet they segment their research staff. If they’ve really been trying to reintegrate themselves on our planet, they’ll have wanted to understand how we’ve evolved without their influence, and they’ll have people studying all the major cultures.”
Zacharias Smith’s mother worked for the Ministry, and had been able to secure a number of unregistered port-keys for them. Harry had no idea how she’d done that, but a Hufflepuff soon learned that often the best way to maintain one’s loyalty was to not ask questions whose answers would be better left outside one’s own head, if one were to be questioned.
Again, she was interrupted by badly translated Greek from the British Ministry. “I am so joyous you mentioned that, Queen. You understand, this land has shattered an imperative global ban on showing magic to people who cannot perform magic. You will need to place the hide spell again.”
He couldn’t take his eyes off Draco’s mouth, his lips pulled tight in anger, his nostrils flaring with each furious breath. Fuck, this was not good. He found it difficult to deny the impulse to kiss Draco on the best of days, but whenever Draco got pissed off at him (most days) it became impossible. Harry usually took an impromptu tea break during Draco’s rants. But now Draco was right in his face, his breath fluttering against Harry’s mouth, and how was he was so sexy when he was angry, so delectable, his cock probably tasted delicious, and––
It’s only after Harry’s disentangled himself from the throng of reporters that he realizes what a huge fucking blunder he’s just made. Dennis thinks it’s all in jest, but he’ll probably print it anyway, and then—fuck. The entire wizarding world will know that every moment of inspiration he’s ever had has been because of Malfoy’s ankles or hipbones or biceps.
“Thanks,” Potter murmured to the elf, without looking away from Draco. “Misty, I command you never to speak of what you have seen or heard in this room tonight, or the tasks you performed for me, to anyone.”
“Fight for it,” said Harry, blinking heavily. There was another agonising tug on his core and he hissed in pain. His heart felt like it was beating overtime but he felt so tired. He was so confused.
Malfoy is suddenly a lot more interested in the fruit basket. “Seriously? Stupefy Dunkel? You have to special order that from Berlin.” He grins at Ron, fluttering his eyelashes. “Weasley, you sappy fuck.”
In his dream, he relived the horrifying final moments of the day of the final battle, when the Dark Lord had hit Potter with yet another Killing Curse, and Potter was dead, or briefly dead, or faking dead entirely—Narcissa had never been sure. Hagrid held Potter in his arms, fat tears probably drowning the boy if he weren’t in fact already dead, and the Dark Lord was speaking at length.
“The free Snitch went to Draco Malfoy. I’ve got five Snitches left to give out. Those of you who receive one will be continuing on with us to Brazil. Those who don’t will be returning home tonight. The first Snitch I’ll give out tonight is going to Dune.”
“Riiight,” Hermione said, slowly. She took a long drink from her beer and said, “Harry, just stop it. I know you’re dying to castigate yourself over this, but Lee and I made a choice. The circumstances aren’t ideal, but it is an opportunity for us both. I don’t even
“You’ll never be any good unless you do, which is a shame since you’ve got intuition. You have to love something to do it properly.”
, and sticks it in his mouth. Malfoy watches this but doesn’t seem inclined to bitch about it. His eyes are half-lidded and sultry and Harry would like nothing better than to stick his tongue down Malfoy’s throat, but it’s been about ten hours since he’s had a chance to eat, and probably twelve for Malfoy, so he ignores the urge for now.
“Good afternoon to you, Mrs Weasley, you hideous troll,” Mrs Black said stiffly. “You’re looking well.”
Ron studied his nails. “Funny thing. We’re real busy today. Might not be able to book you until tonight, maybe tomorrow.”
“Have you heard anything from the ICW?” asked Harry, after they’d giggled enough. “It’s been nearly a week since we visited, and I find it really hard to believe that they just decided to let the Queen’s dismissal go.”
He said, “It happened to me, not the first time, but the second. It was well after curfew and I was alone in my rooms, with no way to get help for hours. For the first hour, I panicked; for the second, I tried to turn pages in
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “Potter, you have no idea what that word means, do you?” He stretches, yawning, and then turns to throw one leg over Harry’s own. He closes his eyes. Harry is mesmerized.
“Language, Malfoy,” Neville said. He tipped his head towards a gaggle of second year Slytherins, snickering at them, as he passed by. They were all trying not to look scandalised, while in fact being exactly that.
The Gryffindors never listened to the professional matches like this before, not even Ron. He’d never had someone who could call his fantasy team shit one minute and then smile proudly at him in Potions the next. He’d never noticed what he was missing out on until now, and the confusing feelings inside him made it both wonderful and terrifying.
“You think this was on purpose, then?” Draco asked. “And not some screwed up continent-wide time traveling?”
“Blimey,” Ron said, tossing the apple core in the compost bin beneath the kitchen sink. “Wait ‘til Lav hears about this. I can’t believe
Dudley, Petunia, Piers, and the Grangers appeared around the privacy screen. Dudley’s relief was almost tangible.
He locked his knees, attempted to remain upright. Draco continued to softly finger his arse, even after he’d pulled his mouth away and licked the come from his mouth.
Harry wandered over to the amphitheatre where Luna and the contenders were gathering, collected clues in hand. Luna waved at Harry when he arrived.
“No, I caught one,” Millicent said, crying again. “I’ve got him here with me. I was going to try to ransom him if all else failed.”
Millicent was good with a Muggle grill—she probably used magic, actually—and the ribs were fantastic, despite being apparently totally okay for Dudley’s Keto lifestyle.
Petunia looked amused. “And yet, you don’t teach them the real Internet,” she said. “You teach them bits and pieces, but not how to survive on the web—you don’t teach them that the internet has an entire separate culture from day-to-day life for us non-mag—for people without magic.”
Harry tensed. He didn’t move them; they stayed like that—warm and connected with Harry’s body, and he imagined a different situation when their legs might be tangled, only without the woollen trousers between them. He shifted, suddenly uncomfortable. Draco’s legs remained, the toe of his shoe pressed against the back of Harry’s calf. Tingles ran up his skin, and he allowed himself a moment to close his eyes and
Harry had to take another strong sip of his brandy before he could put words to his oscillating thoughts.
She eyed the three Gryffindors and there was a warning in there somewhere. Probably to be prepared and not make her life difficult by having no idea what they wanted to do with their lives. Hermione was practically falling off the couch in her excitement. She was good at compartmentalizing in a way that Harry truly envied. He was still miffed about the Ron-events over hols, and she was already throwing herself into Life Beyond Permanently Erasing Yourself From Your Parents’ Memories.
She nodded and passed an old, muggle photo to him. It had to have been taken only the year before they started Hogwarts. Hermione looked so much like the little girl he met on the train, that it was impossible to deny. Seeing the shining look in Mr Granger’s eyes as he watched her unwrapping a brand new book on zymology, Harry wondered how the Grangers could have forgotten their daughter, even with the aid of memory charms. And—was that a little cauldron set off to the side there? And of course it was; Hermione would have got her letter that September, and been forced to wait almost an entire year before she could finally attend Hogwarts. She’d had plenty of time to prepare for it, unlike Harry.
’s amazing,” said Kyle. “But a couple weeks without having to listen to that little shit Caillou was worth the sullen tears,” he confided to them, as if any of that made any sense to anyone.
Harry quickly retreated to a dark corner with his coffee, in no way wanting to be in Hermione’s sight line after that comment.
“And in Slytherin, we would’ve bartered the information for something desirable,” said Malfoy. “But now we’re in Hufflepuff, and you’ll have to
Harry looked to Draco for his approval and was pleased and warmed by the dark, lustful look in his eyes. “It’s very light,” said Harry, spinning a bit. It felt like he wasn’t wearing anything more than robes.
“Ugh, gross,” came a voice from behind them. “Why am I always walking in on you two? Is this my curse? Is this my albatross to wear?”
Harry nodded, though he felt a twinge of something uncomfortable with her words. Despite all Harry’s attempts at ignoring the problem, Draco’s angry rant had some truth to it, at least in regards to Ron and Hermione. They weren’t doing well. And Harry hated that.
She smiled at him. “Gryffindor is a unique house. You have always personified it. I’ll show you how you can grow with Hufflepuff.”
“We can’t stop them,” Padma said. “It was a MACUSA approved installation. They have the installation documentation and it wouldn’t take them long to bring it all down and let that rubbish float back out to sea.”
“Maybe you could just write a story on it,” Harry suggests. “Sexy and merciless (male) senior political reporter somehow impregnated by Harry Potter, no doubt due to Potter’s strange and unceasing ability to be a walking Murphy’s Law.”
The Obliviators could be seen in many of them, standing back, unable to act. They’d reached Britain’s limit of Obliviations for the year last month; they were forbidden to do their jobs and with the Obliviator Prius O’Dell still on trial for illegal Obliviation, they weren’t attempting their own in full view of photographers. Despite this, they were required to get out of bed and respond to the emergency... even if responding just meant showing up and watching all the Muggles staring dumbfounded at the destruction, or crying helplessly, or desperately trying to rescue people.
“Excuse me, one moment. It could be the detective. They’re looking into Dudley’s disappearance. Maybe…maybe he just…”
,” Harry bit out, and shoved his own chair back from the table. It remained upright. “May I be excused,” he said to Mrs Weasley, but it wasn’t really a question. The door slammed behind him as he left.
Kennedy Jones sat back down at her desk and then gestured vaguely. Three dated, government-issue chairs popped into being. It was a lovely piece of wandless, wordless magic and even Harry was impressed by it. “Please sit.”
He wasn’t much of a social butterfly, so it was a good thing that all the contestants were desperate for his attention and that Hermione was willing to bring over pre-screened ones as well. By the end of the night, Harry found that he’d almost enjoyed himself. He was a bit fuzzy around the edges when Luna told him it was time to choose the fifteen who would be staying on.
Harry really didn’t even know why he cared so much. It wasn’t like Malfoy was a bad bloke (anymore). In truth, he’d been rather decent the few times they’d run into one another during Malfoy’s very rare and very brief returns to Britain after his house arrest ended.
“Well, you’re welcome to dinner anytime, Professor,” she said. “Mum loves having company and Dad usually grills fresh octopus and lobster for Christmas if you want to come over then?”
Draco’s hands slid over his sides and held on. Harry jumped. Merlin, it felt like Fiendfyre was running through his veins all of the sudden. “Finish your potion.”
“Hey,” he said. He was confused by the raw sound of his voice. Maybe he was just confused by his voice, full stop. He couldn’t remember speaking a word since Boxing Day. He reached out to take Draco’s hand in his, which was trembling for some reason. Harry had no idea what to say to him, so he squeezed his hand and turned back to the window. It was something after ten now; the new year was only hours away.
Harry, who’d never thought anything of the like, stared at her incredulously. He remembered his manners, fortunately, before she noticed, and resumed a more natural expression. “How so?” he asked.
“We knew this was a possibility,” Potter said. “We knew it could go wrong. Even if it went right, the ICW still would’ve tried to take us down.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Harry said. “I’ll connect it to your Hogwarts portrait so you can jump over. You can come with us on the summer school trips.”
He stops next to Dean, eyes transfixed on a shimmery speckle above Malfoy’s right areola. It shifts whenever he flexes to get more comfortable.
“That’s right, Mummy,” Draco says, returning from the kitchen. He offers her a plate of sandwiches and then does the same for Nana Black. “I’ve told you thirty times.”
God, if he’d known that Veelas could make you come twice in the span of ten minutes, Harry would have Mated with one years ago. Would’ve Mated with Malfoy years ago at least. What was the point of a refractory period, anyway?
Had they destroyed something precious for guilt they’d never be able to assuage? Had Harry come to work every day, eaten uncomfortable lunches with Draco every day, gave half a mind to solving cases every day… for nothing? For a colossal fuck-up that they’d never be able to fix?
“I want the grey lights,” Harry says, returning to the matter at hand. “And are you even going to have time for the diffuser? We’ve Rehearsal in six hours.”
“What about the tsunami, though?” asked another, through a Translation Charm. “That will happen regardless.”
“Merlin, you’re like my mother, Longbottom,” Draco muttered. “Hello, Lovegood. Have you seen that nargle nest on the fourth floor bannister?”
need him. He pushed that thought away, and when he smiled at Millicent, at least his pride for Draco was genuine.
“You were fine,” Harry whispers from the doorway. He glances at Randy, curled close against her back, white and hale, his pink nose draped over her shoulder. He eyes Harry with red, blank eyes—not accusing, but close to it. Nigella’s eyes don’t open for him. She doesn’t lift her head.
Harry rolled back over, flat on his back. He had spent the first eleven years of his life without magic, the next nineteen years ensconced in it. He didn’t want to go back to that life before, what little of it could be called ‘life’.
“So did I,” Weasley admitted. “Found it in my pocket when Hermione’s dad asked me to light his cigar.”
by Paracelsus. It explains the importance of balance, measurement, and ingredient preparation. All foundations of brewing. Are you sure you can understand things like centimetres and millilitres?”
He turned and glared at the camera, as if it were Miles’ fault he’d just admitted that. Miles rolled his eyes. The red light on the camera continued to blink.
to get me sacked? Because we all know it won’t be the fucking golden boy who goes if we don’t figure out who’s trying to steal Liesl Shacklebolt’s identity.”
Harry bit his lip. “You’ve still got that gneiss stone you picked up when we went out to the forest?” he asked.
like they were helping out the Americans and they wanted me gone for a while. Be honest: you can’t actually think Murdoch expects us to
Ron bought himself a new tin of broom wax, and they wandered a bit, having no idea how to choose presents for friends and family, even after years of practise. Harry picked up an Arithimantically-aligned broom compass for Millicent, for lack of any better idea.
They were potentially dying, and Draco was absolutely still scared, and yet Harry was turned on and Draco was smirking, and
Draco rolled his head to look at Harry and Harry’s heart skipped a beat. Maybe everything was okay. “She was top of her class in the Arithmancy NEWT. She knows exactly how much that fucking elf cost.”
Fifteen minutes later, sweating and exhausted, the door clicks open and Harry steps between two ropes of magic and over the threshold. He does a quick check to make sure Druella really is out, and then sits down on the couch to wait, invisibility cloak firmly in place. His blood is heated from adrenaline and worry and excitement, things that all mesh together rather well for Harry. He bounces his knee. Finally the Floo flares, and Draco steps out.
Both Harry and Teddy rolled their eyes at this. “No, nothing about my dating life, which is private, thanks. This is about Gringotts.”
The walk to the staff room was quiet. Now that his Ravenclaws and Slytherins were home, the castle was drowsy, as it always got in the month before the school year began. As if its alarm had gone off, but Hogwarts kept hitting snooze.
“Fine,” he murmured, between kissing Draco’s neck, unbuttoning the tops of his robes, and continuing down to his clavicle. “I can do wandless magic. You win.”
Draco cleared his throat. Harry forced a grin as he rolled over to face him. Damage control time. “Well?” he asked with false nonchalance.
“Draco,” said Lucius. He looked tired, as he always did lately. But he was alive, and not in Azkaban, and that was more than enough for Draco. “I wasn’t expecting a call from you tonight.”
The next morning, a fifth year prefect stopped them on their way out the door and reminded them to uphold Hufflepuff values. Harry had sighed, nodded, and felt compelled to straighten his black and gold tie when, upon glancing at the very conspicuously placed mirror beside the exit, he saw that it was an utter mess.
Shortly after, they approached a large palace, built high and white in the Greek fashion of yore. Draco wasn’t surprised by this—the few surviving sketches and paintings of Atlantean architecture suggested the same—but it was still astounding to finally witness firsthand.
Draco’s mother did not scold him, despite the butter-yellow day robes she was wearing. She bent to wrap Scorpius in a hug, kissed both his cheeks, and the spelled her robes clean without a word. Draco had not got anywhere near that degree of leniency as a child.
“So, Malfoy wasn’t arrested at Customs,” Ron says. “Or if he was, they chose not to extradite him. We didn’t get any calls from the Lebanese Ministry complaining about annoying blond ferrets, so I guess he hasn’t pissed anyone off yet.”
No, he decided. Surely not. He wouldn’t have a mind to think with then. This was another kind of empty, perhaps just as desolate and lonely. He felt a loss like nothing he’d ever known, not even when they’d lost James. Nothing hurt but his heart.
Scorpius moaned and tried to ignore him, so Draco just levitated him from the bed and set him standing on the floor. Scorpius sighed in resignation.
“Maybe we should rethink this thing,” Hannah half-heartedly offered at the Wednesday evening meeting, in reference to their plans to destroy the Muggle landfills. There were nascent plans and strategies forming for how they’d get the Muggles to better handle their waste, but so far they were only dreams, for the Hufflepuffs could find no way around exposing the magical world to do it.
And Harry wanted him despite it all. Despite all the uncomfortable baggage that came with Malfoy, Harry
They went to sit on the long bench, though there were far too many of them to all fit. Draco managed to secure a spot before the rush, and Potter sat next to him. Draco smiled blandly at the Ministry witch glaring at him, who’d not been fast enough to secure a seat.
after all this time. He hadn’t wanked to Malfoy in at least three months. He’d thought he was over that weird, self-destructive habit.
Granger didn’t look impressed. “Have you sent a representative? It’s been over twenty-four hours now. Surely we’ve made contact with the inhabitants? I guarantee Muggle militaries have.”
He had no idea how he got through the remainder of that dinner without giving himself away; his worry for Teddy was palpable, so strong it had to be visible. But the women didn’t notice it, and more importantly, neither did Teddy. They continued to eat, but the easiness of earlier was gone, and each sip of wine he swallowed felt thick with worry.
Harry looked up at him, bewildered, and frankly, annoyed. But Draco’s eyes weren’t on Harry, they were staring straight at the door, even as his body convulsed and his come flooded Harry’s waiting mouth.
Harry smirked. “Yeah?” he said, and hit it there, again and again, until Draco was nothing but a writhing, sobbing mess of pleasure on his well-coordinated indigo bedsheets. Draco’s long fingers tangled in the sheets, his teeth grit. The breath rushed in and out of him in time with Harry’s thrusts.
Reluctantly, Draco stood. Pansy craned her neck to look up at him. “Are the ICW and the Ministry about to do something stupid that we should be prepared for?”
And on reflection, he decided it would take more than this glass to get them through this night. He waved his hand and Summoned the bottle to them, topping up both their snifters before leaning back in his chair and regarding Malfoy over the rim of the crystal.
Harry shrugs. They both have demanding careers that neither of them wanted to leave. The long distance thing couldn’t last forever.
“It’s not that he’s evil or anything, in case that’s what you’re thinking. I know that’s what everyone always thinks when I lodge a complaint against anything Malfoy-related,” he felt compelled to add.
“Loathe as I am to be grateful for anything that woman does, it certainly can’t hurt, Potter.” He narrowed his eyes, added, “Wildly out of character, however.”
Harry laughed before he could stop himself. He watched them decipher the note and start making their way over to the lion statues where Harry’d been waiting, and then it cut in to Dune and Titus finding
The Portkey came at lunch, delivered inconspicuously by a standard-issue British post owl. He was already feeling better about this decision; the Queen of Atlantis obviously had more subtlety than the British Ministry.
“I’m not really looking forward to any part of this, Potter, and yet I’m still doing it because I fucking well have to, so let’s get moving.”
Malfoy, on the other hand, sat stiffly in the booth, looking as if he weren’t sure whether or not it was okay to speak directly to the people on television or not. It was a reasonable confusion, given the only other time Harry knew Malfoy had watched telly, it had been with Dudley, Millicent, Ginny, and Harry screaming at the screen.
If Harry had come to him tonight for sleep, he knew then that he wouldn’t get it. He doubted Malfoy would, either.
Draco swallowed heavily, shared a look with Potter who looked just as uncomfortable as he did. These beings—these aliens who were trying so hard to eradicate an entire branch of their human race—had once been at ease with the Queen and her family. They had once spoken to them regularly, taught them and trained them and guided them. They had once been the people showing the Atlanteans how to thrive and advance their civilisation.
“The Wildifre Whiz-bangs,” said Draco. “They ignite with a code word. We could mount it on the sample, behind a containment spell obviously, and set them off from a distance. If we used the same type of whiz-bang for each sample, it would be simple to measure how much of their magic is absorbed by the sample, and further, it’s a really powerful, sudden blast of magic, so if anything triggers the absorption, those should.”
“I have met them, of course. There is more to this story: When humans began to slowly attain the bodies and minds our creators desired, they chose the best of many to begin work on the cities they would come to inhabit. They took the most elegant of figure, the keenest of mind, the strongest and the most artistic, and brought them to an island to breed together.
It’s too much, much too much, and never enough. Harry pulls away, gasping, angles his mouth to Draco’s collarbone and works shaking fingers against the buttons of his shirt. They come apart as Harry kisses down, down. He slithers backwards off Draco’s lap, kneeling before him and burying his face against the wool of Draco’s trousers, heated with Draco’s own arousal just beneath. Harry mouths at it, trying to figure out why he feels delirious and terrified at the same time. Too much to drink, he suspects as he undoes the fussy buttons on Draco’s fly.
“No, I can’t,” Draco hissed. “Because I’d be vomiting everywhere and that would contaminate the potion!”
“Harry! She left me here with Rosie and a freezer full of pumped milk. What am I supposed to do when it runs out?”
“There was that, too, of course,” said Draco. “The Minister came to visit me in person—another honour—and threatened to pull up some old charges from the DMLE that were never brought forward after you had me and Mother cleared. Said they were grounds for restitution, and that our Manor and the adjacent property would just about cover it.”
But it also sounds like Malfoy’s trying to tell him something else with the words. Like there’s another meaning hidden underneath. It sounds like,
, and things were better, and Harry was basically happy—mostly, the sort of happy that consisted of the happiness of being around someone minus the happiness one could gain if they were
“That’s what connects them,” Draco decided. “Not opposite forces of creation and destruction—a need for life and wealth…or maybe just the belief that one needs it, for something particular. Alchemy has always relied on a spiritual connection to the divine.”
Which Harry thought, also, was rubbish, but he asked for two of them anyway and Rosmerta winked knowingly as she discreetly poured the bottled butterbeers into glasses. Malfoy gave him a distracted, sort-of-grateful smile when he set the butterbeer down in front of his ever-present glass water bottle, and took the seat next.
There was something about Malfoy – something sensual and vibrant. Something that made him Hufflepuff. Something that let him get along with all these badgers and still be Slytherin underneath.
Draco growled, and tugged at Harry’s buttons again until he had the entire row of them undone. Harry’s robes fell off his shoulders and pooled at their feet. The sudden brush of dungeon air against his fevered skin made him shudder, but Draco followed it with his hands, running them down Harry’s arms and over the thin t-shirt he wore beneath.
So when Andromeda’s Floo chimed and Hermione’s voice called out, “Hello!” on Christmas Eve, Harry was very pleased to see her. Draco had not yet arrived, and Harry was grateful for the silent reinforcement he would have through Hermione’s steady presence.
Magic swam around them. Hogwarts was hidden in a mist of swirling lights... surely the students and staff could see this from their windows? Surely everyone was watching this light show, wondering what was causing it? Professor Sprout would know; she would watch from her warm rooms in the dungeons and know because many years ago, she’d done magic with her own cohort of Hufflepuffs. Not magic to this extent, surely, but she would know it nonetheless.
“Calm down,” said Harry. “At least you know your hypothesis is correct.” He reached out to pet her on the head, but drew his hand back quickly when she began a low, ominous growl. Of
On the other side of the threshold, Hermione is holding two steaming cups of coffee. “Take a break?” she asks. “I just need a mo’ away from Malfoy.”
Harry shrugged. It would be a testament of exactly how much Ron’s perception really had improved if he figured it out.
Harry grabbed his elbow and pulled him off the pavement, into the grass. “Look, Malfoy… Draco,” Harry said. “I really liked getting slutty with you last night. A lot. But I have to be stupidly Gryffindor right now and tell you I want you for more than that. I
And it went just like that. Harry got welcome hugs from every former and current Hufflepuff. He learned that two of the three seventh year Slytherins were also cousins of Pansy Parkinson; the third was Ernie Macmillan’s little brother, Alick, the Head Boy.
Draco sat up and started getting dressed before he answered. “For a bit, maybe,” he finally said. “Blaise will die if I’m not there when he wakes up.
Druella lives on the Avenue de Paris, near to Rue Nigeria, and that’s the best he’s going to be able to do because Malfoy’s records are above his clearance level without prior approval since Malfoy’s still an Auror, and Auror safety is always top priority, even though Harry’s a sodding Auror, too, and blah blah blah.
Draco received the first batch of oysters by Floo on the morning of Lee’s fifth date with Madison the waitress. Which had inspired Harry to manoeuvre Draco into another date, perhaps sightseeing.
She narrowed her eyes. “If anyone hears you calling me that I will shove a boiling cauldron of moondew down your throat.”
going to go there. “Draco and I can work on our project while you sit over there in your linseed oil and try to dry.”
Harry was thrown to the ground, hard. He skidded several feet, and heard his shoulder crunch somewhere along the way. His vision darkened and he felt dizzy, but Draco landed on top of him, gasping for breath, and he forced himself not to black out. It was just a dislocated shoulder, nothing to worry about. He struggled to his feet, trying to tug Draco with him, but then the second explosion went off, and with it came a rush of sickly, wet vapours. He breathed in, and immediately knew the error of it.
His chest tightened, a frenetic, aching feeling as their lips met. He clenched his eyes shut tight and put everything he had into that kiss, knowing that he wasn’t honouring the offer he’d made Draco, but unable to stop himself. Draco made him a liar. Draco made him more honest than he’d ever been in his life.
what he wanted to think about with Millicent staring beadily at him and Hermione on his lap, claws millimetres from embedding in his upper thigh.
mixed, she’d had her fair share of slurs thrown at her over the years, Harry knew. And with Lee, Blaise, and Padma there, it was not a comment that went unnoticed.
Harry’s eyes feel scratched dry, his lids obnoxiously puffed so that even his glasses aren’t helping with the blurring. The windows all have hairline fractures, like ice freezing in patterns, mini snowflakes of glass. “Yep.”
“No,” Malfoy said, now glaring at Harry. “She informed us we’d have to wait for Potter’s background check to come back.”
Harry was duly impressed by this and let it be known. “I love flying,” he said. “I’ve never been in a Muggle plane. Is it fun?”
It felt like every important moment in Harry’s life had been connected to Draco in some way, and he couldn’t think of anything but the smell of burning and the screams of Fiendfyre. That had been the moment Harry
“I could’ve got a message to the Queen tomorrow!” Snape said. “I do visit the castle at least every other day. You didn’t have to tether me further to this fucking castle.”
Malfoy broke off, blinking. “Wait,” Malfoy said, scrambling through their assorted books for his copy of the spell. He found it, read it through three times, his smile growing with each one.
Hermione rolled her eyes, continued talking, her voice raising in pitch with each sentence: “Oh my god. The Tyson’s Chicken plant dumps
The rush sent sprays of bubbles in all directions as the fish hurried away, but the confusion didn’t end when they cleared. As the bubbles dissipated, Harry saw Draco struggling to re-cast his Bubblehead Charm, apparently popped by the perch, but he was out of breath and the re-cast spell was fizzling.
Kyle lived in Manhattan on the Upper East Side, but despite the ferocious traffic between JFK and there, their driver seemed to magically glide through all of it. They pulled into the underground garage ten minutes after leaving the airport. There was a lift up to the Malfoys’ penthouse flat. The whole way up, Libby stared at them, far too sullen for any four-year-old. Draco seemed to feel more at home with her than with Kyle, so Harry left them to their weird bonding.
“No, of course not, Potter,” Malfoy said, but Harry could tell it was placatingly done. “Do you think it’s safe to contact Granger?”
“Vagina,” Teddy repeated. “Vuhhh-gina. Got it now, Draco. Thanks.” He looked up at them and they quickly schooled their expressions. “Draco, can you help me with this one? I can’t remember seven times twelve.”
“Of course, Headmistress,” Draco said, and he was already up the stairs and disappearing into the castle for McGonagall’s office before Harry even blinked.
He felt Draco’s smile around his cock, felt Draco’s fingers curl possessively around his hipbones. One slid down, curled under his sac again and he was going to cry if Draco denied him one more time, but the finger trailed further back, and then he felt it teasing slickly at the tight hole beyond. He tensed, hovering right at the edge of climax. It didn’t occur to him to wonder where the lubrication came from. The finger slid inside him, curled over a brilliant spot, and Harry’s vision went black for somewhere between a millisecond and a year, then Draco’s tongue pressed hard against the underside of his cock and Harry lost it, pumping everything he had into Draco’s mouth, and screaming something that was more sob than English.
“Harry, there you are,” said Luna, peering into the alcove they shared. “Hello, Hermione. Harry, I didn’t think I needed to remind you that you’re not allowed to have sex with any of the contenders before the end of the season. It gives an unfair advantage.”
“We’re going to have to hide,” Potter agreed. “I know. But, there’s so much left to do. We’ve convinced Muggles magic and aliens exist, but that’s only half the problem. Now, we have to find a way to speak to them again and see if they can help us keep the aliens out
Or whether he could define the entirety of his acquaintance with Draco Malfoy with a single broom ride.
The next morning, Harry was alone in his trunk, though he had to admit he hadn’t really expected much different. Harry rolled over and checked the clock. It was after nine. Suspiciously, Hermione had not yelled down at him to wake up yet.
It was that he knew they’d just been waiting for an excuse to send him off without officially ‘exiling’ him — because how could the Ministry exile the Boy Who Lived? But as soon as any international issue having remotely to do with water had come up, off he’d been sent. With barely a week’s notice, with no opportunity to decline, no opportunity to even ask for leave from work, no opportunity to settle his personal affairs more thoroughly than going to Gringotts and saying, ‘I guess I just need to withdraw it all.’
“You betrayed my family name,” Draco hissed. The portrait tensed further, his smile caving in at the edges. “You don’t deserve the name Black.”
Malfoy snorted. “Merlin, Potter, you’re as mad as a centaur. But it’ll at least be interesting watching you fail. You do that well enough. Try
Reynolds falls to his knees in front of Harry and immediately starts casting shaky skin-knitting spells over him.
Hermione had returned to her digital newspaper but bit out a ‘Good morning, Mrs Black,’ in reply. Lee managed to get the Keurig working faster than Harry, and all of his coffee made it into the cup. He brought it over and took the last stool at the bar, looking quite refreshed indeed.
Hermione was, of course, already waiting by the time Harry arrived at the Charms wing. Her hair fluttered behind her, almost like an afterthought, as she paced back and forth.
“I can’t believe I’m explaining this to you,” Ron said wondrously. “Ministers serve for terms of six years. They can serve up to four terms or twenty-six years, in the case of taking over mid-term if the previous Minister dies or leaves office.”
The rest of the ICW task force was brought into the Circle of Truth the morning they planned to cast the worldwide
Outside, he turned and looked back the way they’d come. The castle was further away than he would’ve thought. He could see the orange glow of torchlights in the windows of Ravenclaw and Gryffindor Towers. Up there, Ron and Hermione were getting ready for bed. Once, he would’ve been doing it with them.
The hearth was half-full of bubbling cauldrons, and when Mr Weasley flooed in from work, he barely missed landing in the bread sauce.
“Hey,” said Harry. He tried to sit up, and it wasn’t all that difficult. His body worked just fine, though his mind felt as though it shouldn’t. “How long?”
The next morning, Harry wakes up to the sound of Malfoy berating the housekeeping elf for not bringing hot enough towels and the vague realization that Malfoy is a cuddler. He pulls himself up on one elbow, blinking blearily at the scene before him. The housekeeping elf has one hand on her hip and both eyes narrowed.
They sighed. “Fine,” said Harry. At the table, Teddy was working hard on his homework, folding down his fingers and counting to help him with his nines. His little pink tongue poked out in concentration. Harry bit his lip to keep from smiling. He was a cute little brat.
“Doubtful,” Draco said, with some disappointment. “But he had that look on his face when he was working on it, like you do now. That cataloguing look.”
Malfoy comes around and perches on the edge of his empty former desk. He crosses his arms and watches Harry trying not to have a nervous breakdown. “Heard you’re getting partnered with Demelza Robins next,” he says. “It’s adorable how Gryffindors always manage to end up together. Are you magnetic?”
“Hermione Granger, Your Majesty.” She firmed her mouth, deliberated, said, “I wonder if you forgot to mention the part of this spell where someone would have to give their life for it.”
Everyone was in Hogsmeade for the day, but Hufflepuffs weren’t hard to round up. They travelled in herds. Most of them were found in Honeydukes, and the rest they rounded up at the Three Broomsticks. And sneaking them out in a large group also wasn’t hard to do, as the rest of the school expected Hufflepuffs to all come and go in ridiculously large packs.
Millicent frowned, glanced at Draco. “Professors Malfoy and Potter have already volunteered. I don’t want anyone else caught up in this. I appreciate your concern, but we’ve got it sorted. I just—I need all of you to see this, to understand what’s out there, beyond our wards. What we can’t see. It’s beings like
No viral infections, no bacterial. No cancer. No poison. No injury. No stroke or aneurysm, no thrombosis. Just one quiet organ shutting down after another. Intestines first, then lungs, and now her heart has slowed to an erratic, weary pace. Like an Avada Kedavra victim, there is nothing wrong with Nigella except that she’s dying.
Draco dumps another set of files on the table, including three black ones, the highest clearance level in the Ministry. Neither of them ever got it in London. Draco’s only been in Beirut for two-and-a-half months and he’s already got it. He sinks down onto the couch next to Harry and glares at the files, as if their mere existence is an affront.
Anthony finally looked up from his book. He eyed Harry for a moment. “Bisexual, actually. My mistake. Let me know if you want any reading material on it. I have loads from when Michael realized he was and practically bought out Flourish and Blott’s. Somehow in the end of year book return in Ravenclaw, his bisexual books ended up in my trunk and I’m fairly sure he got my biathlon ones.”
Just then, Ms Williams came up and asked him if they’d have time to stop at Snog to get a frozen yoghurt before returning to school. As if this was a joy outing and not a valuable learning experience.
something. We could’ve accidentally tethered it all to my painfully uncouth cousins for all we know."
Harry swallowed heavily. It made him think of Draco, suddenly, and then his body began to hurt all over, as if emotion were a physical thing. He’d quit the Aurors on September first, and here it was nearly Christmas. That was almost four months he’d gone without even seeing Draco’s face, save for at the increasingly awkward (now that Teddy was at Hogwarts) monthly family dinners Andromeda hosted.
Sostrate began with the earth and its swampy, primal beginnings. She painted a vivid picture of the lakes of fire covering all the land, the toxic air.  It was in many ways the same story she’d told them just last week, but still vastly different. This was a story meant to be remembered, told by someone who knew the theories of oral histories and traditions. She had a natural talent for it, a low, soothing voice that changed with the ebbs and flows of the story.
Almost as one, they looked up at the sky. There was nothing there, just a dreary, grey cast that promised rain eventually.
Out of Petunia’s line of sight, Millicent raised her eyebrows, and Harry felt that deep and penetrating shame he hadn’t felt since he was a kid. His own aunt, whom he’d grown up living with, didn’t know how he took his tea. Because she’d certainly never made him a cup before.
She took a few steps forward, called Galene’s name. Galene appeared with a lovely embroidered chair, which the Queen sat upon, before popping away again. She popped in thrice more with chairs—not quite as lovely—for Harry, Millicent, and Malfoy. Harry, still feeling the dizzying aftereffects of their ancient Chinese communication ritual, sat gratefully.
like humans did. Harry cocked his head, distantly took in Lavender sending off a Patronus for a mediwizard and Hermione rushing forward to take over chest compressions where Harry’d left off. She fell to her knees right next to him, and pressed her mouth over Draco’s, and that was good. That was necessary. But something else was necessary, too, and only Harry could do that part.
He takes the barstool next to Malfoy’s and steals one of his zucchini slices. There’s, like, fourteen different sauces to choose from; he jabs it randomly around until the end of the zucchini is sufficiently covered in
Draco frowned. “Not really, no. The reports of its destruction were always similar enough: lots of water, tsunamis perhaps from an earthquake or volcanic eruption, and then it disappeared in the space of a day.”
At home, Hermione turned on the telly and expertly navigated to the Netflix, that her parents had and which Harry had always secretly wanted to try, but for which he hadn’t ever managed to get the sodding internet to work in Grimmauld Place. There was something in the ancient wards slithering through its walls that kept such advanced Muggleness out.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I’m a field chemist, stupid. I spent most of the last five years actually swimming around in the stuff.”
But… he would bet that other people in the school could, and that if he helped them even a little, they could figure this mess out. This wasn’t his battle to lead, but it was another war he intended to fight anyway.
“It is,” Luna insisted. “Why is a limestone rock just sitting there in the middle of an otherwise flat landscape?”
He moved on to the next room after turning in his two-ounce sample for analysis, and was greeted at the door by a young witch with a crooked nose, like she’d broken it once or twice. “Choose a parchment. You will find six potions on the table to my right. Your assignment is to identify the potions on your parchment and write about the brewing process for each. Details on the board.”
In short, everything was great. Except for the part where they’d both been so busy this week that the understood reconvening of Friday’s outlandish attempt at sex had yet to manifest. He’d pushed Draco into an alcove after lunch on Wednesday, but they’d barely had a chance to start snogging before a passel of first year girls came by talking loudly of hair charms.
“Yeah,” said Harry, but his mind was elsewhere. He wished he knew how fight this. He wished he knew why the Hufflepuffs weren't afraid of Malfoy.
Andromeda beamed. “He’s already learning his multiplication tables. Tell Harry and Draco what number you’re up to now, Teddy.”
It was re-compressed into a single, snitch-sized, blood-red stone. It was beautiful and translucent, but it was still Poisoned, and even Conjunction had not fixed that. Even Fiendfyre had not fixed that; or maybe, that was precisely what was supposed to happen.
Draco nodded, and squeezed Potter’s hand back. He was glad it was Potter here with him. Potter had always been so sure of his own moral compass, and Draco…had not.
Draco is many things, but impetuous would never be one. Even in his most in-love, Harry knows Draco is not one to neglect an opportunity to
,” Hermione said. She pursed her lips, cast a privacy spell over their table. “The Ministry tied my hands—technically, since I’ve remained on call for the Department of Mysteries, they can reactivate my contract for ‘emergency situations’ and they
Potter looked around, furtive, but his expression remained tightly neutral. Ahead, the guards were conversing with Penelope and two officials the British Ministry had sent along. Adding in the three-odd-dozen others who’d volunteered themselves from the ICW meeting, their diplomatic party was more like a small army.
Harry, Millicent, and Malfoy shared an uncomfortable look. Harry felt jostled and unsteady. There was something—something
her magic pouring out of her. She’s given so much that she can’t even sever the thread. There is nothing he can do for her: Nigella
This cheered Harry more than was healthy, he reckoned. “Well, right then. So, we’re unattached, healthy, strapping, young men. There are certain, ah, needs…”
Malfoy shrugged, poured himself a cup of tea and masterfully palmed a finger of brandy into it without any of the students or other staff being the wiser.
She nodded her head towards the train, where Ron was gently cuffing Rosie on the shoulder and giving what looked to be a very Gryffindor-inspired pep talk. “They get on so well.”
As they rounded the road, the train station came into view and Harry was relieved to see a single carriage with two Thestrals waiting for them.
“It’s the letting go,” said Harry, who was feeling rather more philosophical after the intensity of that morning, with the explosion, and Draco touching him in a non-sexual way.
He followed Draco into their dorm, where Anthony and Neville were already tucked away – Anthony with a book on British herbs and Neville with the same book. He wondered what Ron was doing. Probably having a game of Exploding Snap with his new friends, of which Gregory Goyle was apparently one. He still hadn’t figured out what that mysterious project on Dean’s bed was.
, Harry says, even though it’s not okay because, really, that four could’ve meant four hours, four days, or even four months. They’re still missing something. They have to be.
It was the second week of October, a Friday, and there were sure to be some fall festival sorts of things going on. They could pop down to London, perhaps SoHo, and take a walk. He’d let the kids see that things were just as they were supposed to be, that Muggles weren’t acting any differently.
of stuff.” He detached himself and started leading Harry back towards the kitchen, chattering all the while. Harry nodded along, trying to give Teddy his full attention, but unable to quite do so with Draco’s voice drifting out from the kitchen. His body was on high alert. There was something in him that both resisted going in that room and couldn’t wait to get there.
Draco blinked, stunned. Potter had sat back abruptly, as if trying to literally escape such a truth.
by sharks was like something from a horror movie, but here, it was real. It was something that happened not infrequently, and the more the Mers were forced out into the open ocean, the more often it would happen. He couldn’t stop thinking of
Lucius and Narcissa were waiting for them. Their postures changed at once upon spotting Harry. Narcissa took the first step forward, holding out her hand, and Lucius followed.
Harry didn’t bother to look up from the stack of magazines. The February, 1997 issue had a really stirring account of what one experienced upon ingesting both a flame-retardant potion and an ever-lit match. Merlin, what people would go to in the name of research.
He tosses the folders on the coffee table one by one, the labels and colours increasing in severity and clearance level as they hit the wood. Draco’s not working the Turkey cases. No one is, actually. Not for months. They’ve been closed, assumed sorted, and the only reason Harry was even able to make the connection is because of the days he spent staring at nothing but the cover sheets to these folders and those like them.
—during Hermione’s sabbatical, mind you—to have yours and Bulstrode’s and even Malfoy’s charges removed before you’re found and arrested. Do you know how many favours I’ve had to call in at the DMLE? Good favours, that I was
wasn’t generic. It was the name of the first potion that killed everything, always, and no one ever found an antidote to it. Then all the other potions came after it, and were called things like Liver Poison or Blood Poison, and it became so ubiquitous that it lost its original meaning:
“Say something,” Harry said, tiredly. He looked over her shoulder and then over his, checking to make sure they were still alone. Somehow they’d managed to sneak away from the camera crew, but no doubt they would find him shortly.
By now, Harry was clean of the creature’s blood and the other Heads of Houses—Hannah for Hufflepuff and Pansy for Slytherin—had been summoned by the Headmistress. Ron and Hermione came over after dropping the kids off with Molly, looking alarmed and exhausted.
Millicent’s eyes were wide as saucers. She barely spared their naked chests and pants-clad bottoms a second glance as she pushed her way inside.
Harry stared glumly down at the Portkey. It was a miniature plastic White House. He sat down on his trunk and stared balefully at the back of Draco’s head. At thirty-seconds-to, he grabbed hold of his trunk with his spare hand and took a deep breath. Hurricane Omar was hanging out in the middle of the Atlantic right now.
She was being distant and bossy. She always did that when she was upset. It was Day Four of her divorce.
“I’m happy,” Harry insisted. Sort of, anyway. He was maybe a little restless, but it was to be expected, probably.
Harry scrunched his nose. “I definitely saw some last night. And last Thursday, too, when I went to talk to Malfoy about Atlantis.”
He ruffled Harry’s hair as he passed, and stopped short at by Draco, who’d only recently begun to untense. “What’s this, a new face! Happy Christmas—good heavens, you must be the Malfoy boy.”
“Oh! This is where they used to teach Sympathetic Magic. Look there—the little wax dolls on that shelf over there. It hasn’t been taught in two hundred years, after some unfortunate incidents with muggles. I read about it in
He took Draco’s hand and they Apparated to a secluded segment of Marine Park, at the edge of Brooklyn. Harry inconspicuously conjured some wellies and waded in. He was looking for a particular rock formation that Quincy had told him about. Normally, seahorses preferred warmer coasts, but this was a magical herd who’d, supposedly, relocated to New York to start anew. They lived in the salt marshes now, and didn’t seem to mind the cold.
They’d exhausted the pleasantries and were now sitting in a tense silence. Albus was curled on Ginny’s lap, petting Harry’s invisible dog, Ms Danger. Luna leant into Gin’s free side, gave Harry a soft smile.
“Mm?” said Draco, fumbling for his wand in the darkness. He had no idea how Severus had lived like this.
Harry frowned. “Underhanded, you mean?” he said, thinking back to the not-ultimatum he’d been issued by Minister Murdoch—a man he’d never even met, or indeed, heard of before being summarily summoned to his office last week. Harry hadn’t even known that Shacklebolt retired.
Draco did, eyes narrowed, and then seemed to come to the same conclusion Harry had. “Ah, Weaslette the Second,” he said, nodding. “I
“I’m very grateful Astoria’s here,” Malfoy agreed. “That was one of the main reasons I submitted my application for this posting. I wanted Scorpius to have a relatively stable childhood, with his mother and father in the same place as much as possible. Although, he’s very much a mummy’s boy so I haven’t seen much of him since we’ve returned. Much like his father in that regard,” he added wryly.
“They still will,” said Millicent, which Draco thought was rather perceptive, but then again, it was Millicent they were talking about. She’d been the most perceptive of all the Slytherins in their year. “But you’re right. I’ll have a better shot at convincing them if it’s alive.”
Malfoy ignored him: “And explain it to you. Rituals are mathematical; they always follow a formula, and there are a set of twelve standard formulas, depending on the type of ritual and the outcome desired. The druids probably used one of three types. If we could figure out which type, and if we had the positioning diagram, we could perhaps reverse the ritual and release the magic.”
“My thoughts exactly,” said Draco. “I thought maybe he just wanted easy marking since he’s got his last Slug Club party coming up next weekend.”
“That’s so fucked,” Harry decided. “I think if I’d been you, I would have rounded up my Mum and moved to America. Or Chile, maybe. Voldemort probably would’ve ignored countries that didn’t speak English.”
He turned the corner to the kitchen, already apologising, “Andromeda, I’m so sorry, I overslept—” And stopped dead in his tracks.
“I’ll help,” Harry said immediately. “We’re going to try to save the Statute of Secrecy, right? Dudley and I should be on the task force, as Muggle experts.”
“I’m not nice,” said Draco, as if the very idea were insulting. “But there really is some sort of nest up there. I think it’s mutated doxies, unfortunately.”
Ronnie stops to piss so Harry waits, gazing off into the middle distance and wondering if he could ever look half as sexy as Malfoy does when he’s in Harry’s trousers. He wonders if he was claimed tonight or if it takes penetrative sex. He feels raw and feral but not particularly
“Me neither,” said Hermione, with some surprise. “Besides the obvious, anyway. But I have a feeling there’s always more to Malfoy than the obvious.”
Privately, Harry wondered if it was because Malfoy had returned to his own rooms last night. Was it possible to get used to sleeping next to someone after one night?
Feeling decidedly stupid, Harry nodded, and together they watched the bit of green acid dry up all the water and then gather at the bottom of his cauldron in a prim little pool of rank-smelling oil. And then Harry understood.
“I would be on my bed, and it would be warm, the light moving all around me. I’m rushed with anticipation. He says my name as he crawls onto the bed, hovers over me. My pulse speeds up, my chest begins to slowly heave. He’s finally there, and now I’m alight, but still somehow terrified.
Potter didn’t bother trying. He laughed, self-deprecating, and said, “Ma’am, even I don’t understand their ways. Nevertheless, I was embarrassed by it, and I apologise on behalf of all of us.”
Addolgar smiled. “As we said, any non-Hufflepuffs who try to enter will be summarily cursed. After you, Ravenclaw.”
He jabbed the burner with his wand and directed a strongly-worded thought at it; there weren’t particular spells for this sort of thing, only annoyance and magical power. Finally, it settled down into a stable, low burn, although not without resentment.
The wizard pointed. “Go past the Starbucks with the three-tailed Mermaid, not the one with the two-tailed Mermaid—that one’s in the NoMaj section—and take a left. It’s just there. For currency exchange, you’ll want to stop by the First National Bank of Numinous People. They can exchange Magical or Non-Magical for you. It’s outside Security and through the atrium. Follow the signs for Metro until you start seeing signs for the bank. It’s disguised as a closed magazine kiosk.”
Ron howls before gritting out the countercurse, but Harry sees him leaving them alone in the tent and he feels like he’s breaking in half, oh god, he can’t go through this again,
Silence fell for a few moments as everyone took in the aggregate news from the Mer tribes. Harry’s curry was going cold and he reminded himself to take a few bites. Nothing like hearing how people could fuck up main element needed for life to turn off one’s appetite.
The room erupted in laughter all around them, startling Harry and Draco both. Harry turned and found more than a dozen people, red faced, looking at him. “What?”
“Feel free to redecorate it,” Harry said lazily. He was too happy being snuggled up next to Draco with a box of paneer to care about much of anything.
“Malfoy,” says Harry, clearing his throat. Malfoy looks down at him with that same flat, aristocratic expression—if Malfoy doesn’t react like anything’s wrong, then nothing’s wrong. It’s how posh people work. Harry knows; he sells them clothes.
“Potter,” Malfoy says quietly. Not even angrily, like Harry had half-expected. “What are you doing here?”
Thinking of Hermione, and Ron’s fist in Harry’s face if any of her ended up on national magivison, Harry said, “No!” He jumped up from the bed. “No—that’s not necessary. Maybe they could transfigure them instead? From, um, winter cloaks? And extra points if they, um, make them my favourite colour.”
The sudden quiet draws Draco’s attention to her. He turns, and their eyes meet and Harry can see it all happening in slow motion, as if he’s watched this scene before and has just rewound it in order to take in the details he missed the first time. Hermione’s pupils dilate, Draco’s fingers clench, his chest rises and hers follows, they flick their glances to one another’s mouths and then away again. Their eyes meet again, as if compelled, as if unable to help themselves.
Dudley peered into the Tupperware. “Doesn’t look like it. I didn’t see any bleach or anything out on the countertop when she was baking them this morning. Want one? I mean, Madam Pomfrey and Mr Lao could fix you up anyway, even if she did poison them.”
“Yeah, here.” Harry checked his watch. It hung from his tiny wrist. Twenty minutes until the Polyjuice wore off. “I’m going to transform now.”
“Mr Dursley is a Professor at Hogwarts and you will treat him with respect, Mr Leotard,” Potter sneered.
Dudley nodded. “Good idea. If I can get her to accept it, anyway. She might think it was something only hippies use.”
, he thought at Severia. The little beast really had been opening the wards for Draco—or was it the door, not the wards?
Harry looked away, exhaling slowly to steady himself. “I hated it, for a while. Before the final battle. Then I—then I died. I’ve made my peace with crows now.”
The clock on the mantle said he had an hour and a half until he had to be back down in the common room in his best cloak... whatever the fuck that was for. But Harry was a Hufflepuff, and as a Hufflepuff, he was willing to go with the flow so long as it didn’t interfere with his social life or mores. Given he had no social life to speak of, and given that he could find no ethical dilemma in changing that up with another cocktail hour with his new housemates, this one apparently outside, he obliged.
Having a mutt to sleep with at night helped keep the empty-bed syndrome at bay, but it wasn’t as good as sleeping with another person. Those years with Ginny, even after things had fallen apart, at least gave him someone to spoon against. Ms Danger’s fur was incredibly soft, but she also wasn’t visible most of the time, and only weighed a stone and a half besides. Hardly a substantial presence.
“Okay, c’mere. Let me take you out.” He reached in and Seabiscuit practically flew into his hand. Harry grasped him gently and transferred him to the marsh. Immediately, the other seahorses swam up to inspect Seabiscuit. They were chattering their mouths and flicking their tails excitedly.
Harry was both annoyed by the sentiment and thoughtful of the questions. “Draco, really,” he said. “The economy would grow to support them. It might even lead to innovation.”
Ron peers in, red hair dull until the atmospheric magic senses him and lights the torches. “There you are,” he says. He doesn’t sound like a man who’s come back from a second honeymoon. Then again, he doesn’t sound like a man who’s having to deal with the fallout of his wife forced into an emotional affair, either. He sounds like Ron—sturdy, earthy, dependable Ron. “I nicked Hermione’s badge and Apparated home this morning. Dreamed you were having a rough go of it. Looks like I was right.”
rather fit. “But I concede on Dexter. He’s my second chaser.” At Hermione’s smirk, he felt his face flush a little. And further, how did Hermione even know those names? He’d been sure she always tuned them out when he and Ron were talking Quidditch.
“They’re obviously using too much to begin with,” Draco said. “If it stays in the soil, they won’t need to re-up so often.”
And really, what went through someone like Harry’s mind to go along with it? Harry could have stayed, could have taken the story to the
“The beetle,” he said. “It walked on that one, and it changed it. It made it…I don’t know. It made it alive, or not-dead at least. I think it took away everything that was deathly about it, and made it amenable to life.”
It had been twelve years since they’d really seen each other, save a few bumps in Diagon Alley. Twelve years since the final battle and trials; the terrified expression of Malfoy’s face as he’d climbed a tower of burning furniture and detritus was etched into Harry’s memory. Malfoy didn’t look afraid anymore, but then again, Harry hadn’t really expected that.
He reaches out absently, blindly, and Draco’s hand settles into his own as Draco comes to stop next to him. He sighs, endlessly long-suffering.
They stopped at the broom shop first because—well, because they were young, Quidditch-obsessed men, not to put too fine a point on it. Harry stared in awe at the new Firebolt model, which burst into real flames when flown. He decided that he’d had quite enough of flying through fire for one lifetime, regardless of the declaration:
“Oh fuck,” he whispered to himself. “I kissed Malfoy in public. No, he kissed me, and I was just a bystander. But I probably kissed him back a little. Fuck, this is so embarrassing.”
The spell washed over them, surging in and out of their bodies as Draco’s voice rose and fell like the tide. The river jumped and sparked, the magic sparkling in a rainbow of colours.
“Yes, and we undertake this great displeasure, to suffer their presence over the Yule log, for the benefit of all wizardkind. Your gratitude is noted.”
Ms Pollen gaped at him for only a moment, then shook herself out of it and said, “The Champa and Magnolia arrangements need to be placed at the end of each row of chairs, alternating.”
Her face softens, looking somehow both more and less aware. “I know, Harry,” she says. “But things change. And not all of it’s bad.”
Harry writes. Draco doesn’t look at the word. Harry makes it blink. He still doesn’t look. Chest aching, Harry Apparates home.
Harry undoes his own trousers and slips them off as he’s kissing along that valley of muscle angling down from his torso to his cock. Malfoy whimpers, arching up, and there’s a trail of pre-come across Harry’s face, reminding him of the exquisite feeling of Malfoy coming on him yesterday. He gasps, closing his eyes as he rides out the shudders that memory gives him. He drops to his knees before the bed and takes Malfoy into his mouth in one go.
Draco shrugged. “It’s different when you know everyone so well. There were a lot of people there I don’t know well.”
. The words were barely audible and completely unintelligible to Harry’s ears, but Malfoy sounded composed and confident. He’d done this spell before—certainly not on this scale, but at least to his mother’s Dalmatians or his friends. Harry felt the magic rising, felt his own drawing forth in response to an unheard call. It swirled through his body, down his arms, and into Malfoy’s own.
Hermione looked miserable. “I don’t know. Maybe. The article said that these aurora things have been showing up all over. I need to go to London and pull the last few weeks of all the major UK newspapers. Maybe do some more magic readings, to see what the status is around these sites. I’ll see what I can find.”
Given the chosen theme, and the pleasant weather, it was being held in Bath, at a wizarding establishment called the Whelk Right Inn. Harry felt it should be noted that, despite strong evidence to the contrary, not all magical establishments had magical names. Those that didn’t, had puns.
“That was your son,” said Malfoy, a hint of a question lingering at the end. He’d heard about Albus’s playdates with Scorpius, but hadn’t met him in person, yet.
Harry huffed. She would weasel it out of him eventually if he didn’t just tell her. “We had a… thing. A few years back. It didn’t end well.”
Obviously unconcerned by lurking dark creatures, Draco’s hands came around to unbutton the front of Harry’s apprentice robes, and Harry, thinking this was a good idea indeed, did the same with Draco’s. Their hands clashed more than once, but Harry was rather more inclined towards speed than finesse and so this bothered him not at all.
But not even that, not even his ingrained British need to not be an impolite arsehole pushed him to move.
Potter gave him an indecipherable look, his face somehow both sad and knowing, and stepped up closer to Draco. His fingers as they touched Draco’s hand were still frigid, but his breath was sweet and warm against Draco’s lips.
With no Ron to distract him with more entertaining pursuits, Harry worked steadily through his Charms homework. Yet McGonagall’s pronouncement about additional career counselling nagged at him. She would ask him if he was still on track to be an Auror, and he would talk about his improved marks in Potions, especially now that he was under his second year with Slughorn. And then there would be an awkward silence where she expected the meeting was over, and Harry refused to leave because he was bursting to scream,
Draco smiled one more time, and then he turned, called out ‘Malfoy Manor’ and stepped into the flames. Harry stood there watching the low-burning green fire for interminable minutes after he’d gone. He had no idea if this was a good end to the night, an appropriate end to a night when ‘going slow’ or not. All he knew was that he didn’t give a fuck who was jumping from brooms on Saturday; he’d been plummeting for years, and he still wasn’t sure if Draco was going to catch him.
“Well,” she said again, forcing stable breaths out. She stood. “I think I would have preferred the long lines at International Security and a transatlantic flight after all.”
Millicent hopped down from the top bunk, snatched up the sandwich. She pulled the bread off and Summoned two sticks of beef jerky from the bag, apparently already regretting her moment of weakness with the chips last night.
His own crumbles, a sudden, visceral memory of Hedwig flashing in his mind before he pushes it away. His bloodstream floods with self-hatred and regret. He should’ve let her fly ahead. He fucked up, and he lost her. And in that moment, he realizes he loves Nigella as he’d loved Hedwig, and he can’t lose them both.
“We’re not even the main line,” Malfoy said. “I’m descended from the third child in the original family: Malfidia Tertia – it’s a distaff line, but that really makes no difference, as the main line, from Malfidia Prima, now in California, was also distaff. The second line comes from the first son, second child, Orcus Malfidia, and they’re still in Italy, along with the fourth and seventh lines, but no one really cares about them, as they never RSVP to holiday invitations. The fifth line, from Magus Malfidia, is the one Longbottom mentioned. They’ve been in Massachusetts since the seventeenth century. The patriarch of that one instigated the witch-burnings in a few villages, though, so we don’t even send them holiday invitations. I’m not sure that they’ll bother to reply to my letter requesting assistance with the UMN.”
It occurred to Harry then that he and Hermione were perhaps about to commit a great sin: that of creating a
But Draco’s mother, who’d done nothing—who’d never taken the Mark, never hurt anyone, just tried to keep her family safe—was confined to the Manor grounds for a decade and a half. Even Potter’s testimony hadn’t saved her from it.
A curious meow brought his attention to the floor. Severia peered up at him, already on her back and positioned for a belly rub.
But as they’d done since they arrived in August, it wasn’t long before they buried their feelings on this shitshow and got to work.
He took the letter that had arrived from her at dinner and absconded to the library. He wasn’t sure why he’d chosen here of all places, but it was the first time he’d entered the library since he was studying for the NEWT exams that never came in seventh year. Madam Pince was still here, still bitter about the devilish wizard who’d stolen her heart and her own personal first edition set of Gorebrinks’
“Potter you kinky fuck,” Malfoy said. “God, your arse. I’ve thought about filling you up with my come for years.”
“There’s just one more thing,” Granger added, and Draco could have jinxed her for not letting them just get this horrid thing over with. “This spell was designed for four casters. We only have three: Harry, Draco, and Millicent. A triad is powerful, but a quad is balanced and represents the four elements, which are important when casting a spell affecting the earth itself. I’ll act as the fourth.”
“Oooh,” said Teddy and Rosie simultaneously. Their eyes snapped to Narcissa and hungrily followed her progress into the kitchen behind Andromeda.
For the most part, their group was ignoring it and hoping it would die down as soon as the Muggles started cleaning it up and putting forward proactive legislation. If they ever started. They were still complaining about property values and states’ rights (and states’ obligations—the flyover states especially had no interest in their tax dollars going to beach beautification projects in Tampa Bay).
A flash of light caught his eye and he turned, but it was only Malfoy’s hair. Harry scowled. Malfoy was paying very close attention to Luna. Why did he care so much?
Draco barely refrained from fidgeting. He’d not felt so keyed up since his first Quidditch game at Hogwarts. He sipped his drink, trying to focus on the flavour of it, savour the history and how different the honey here was from that in England.
They all unwrapped their whiz-bangs and carefully set them within their neatly-arranged soil samples. Harry took a dozen steps back and the others followed. He checked his whiz-bang wrappers; his code words were ‘goldfish’ and ‘telephone’.
She fluttered a hand at him. “As you say, Mr Potter, but even if I weren’t inclined to, that cat isn’t worth anything to a wizard. I couldn’t charge
Harry huffs. “Fine, no smirking. So, do you want to go get dinner or something before you leave?” He doesn’t know why, but it feels important that they eat together one last time. There’s something about eating with someone that makes Harry feel connected to them, and he’s felt connected to Malfoy for ages. He needs this one last moment of connection to get him through the rest of his sodding life without his partner.
Much like the shopkeeper, Ron whistled lowly. “Merlin, Harry,” he said. He stared at him, eyes wide, and nearly walked into an old witch carrying a little basket of dissected slugs.
. Fuck, this was turning out to be a nice holiday for Hermione. Maybe he should sign someone up for this show and then tag along until they eliminated him out of spite or good sense.
“I can’t just go around renaming her every other day, Professor,” said Harry. “She’ll get confused, and then she’ll have a complex. Besides, she likes her name.”
But despite the loads of chocolate and good food, they were weakening. All of them were low on sleep, and many had lost weight. It wasn’t a sustainable practise. They were only halfway through the list of ‘highly hazardous’ landfills in Britain, and there were literally hundreds more. It would take them months. Harry didn’t think he could keep this up for months, but they tried anyway. They did landfill after landfill, leaving clean, magic-safe land in their wakes.
Draco shrugged. “Don’t care. All that matters is that they can boil a cauldron. And obviously, they can.”
“Fuck off, Malfoy. You got the quarterly statement last week and I’m not obligated to suffer your company beyond that.”
They sprang apart, horrified, and swung to face the single portrait in the room, positioned above the desk Harry used for brewing. Dumbledore was beaming at them, and where on earth had he come from? How many times had he watched them working together in this room, how many—
“I suppose we did. Gin’s…very gay. Super gay. I’m…more flexible. But she’s just, really, really gay. We both wanted kids and otherwise we love one another, so we thought we’d give it a go, but then. Well, we had another, before Al—a boy, James. There were...complications. He didn’t make it. We got a divorce, and then too drunk one night, and Al came from that. And it really worked out because Luna is probably the most perfect person in the world for Gin, and a great extra mum for Al. I figure one can never have too many mums, you know?”
So he cast a Patronus, feeling inordinately pleased with himself as the flash of shimmering white leapt from his wand. But then he noticed the shape, and his face drained of blood. There was a greyhound dashing about the room, and any hope that he could cancel it before Draco noticed was shot. For the second time that day, their eyes met, and Draco looked anything but happy.
Harry checked on his Cold Cure potion and added in the final ingredients. Merlin, this potion was annoying to brew. He’d started it six times already and he usually ruined it within the first twenty minutes. This was only the second time he’d made it to the third step.
“Harry,” Hermione said, sitting next to him, her knees turned to his thighs, her hands squeezing one of his. “What the
He sat back, stared at the buttons for a few seconds, and then pressed one. It started to thrust in his hand and Harry groaned. Merlin it would feel so good inside of him. Malfoy smirked down at him as he covered it with lube and lined it up with Harry’s arse. Harry pulled his knees up further, desperate. When the first curved section of it finally slipped inside him, already thrusting, Harry’s vision flared. He fell back against the pillows, his chest heaving, moaning. Malfoy pushed it the rest of the way in and Harry thought he might very well die at that moment, until Malfoy bent down and once again closed his mouth around Harry’s cock.
. Ron comes out the other side of the threshold with clear, startled eyes, and Hermione is—she’s Hermione and she looks as in love with Ron as she did in November.
She pursed her lips. “Sometimes, I think I should quit the DMLE, too. I’m so tired of staying up until two every other night, trying to put together a defense for some ungrateful thug. I think my boss gets pleasure out of only assigning me the obviously guilty and violent ones.”
Potter shuffled uncomfortably. Draco sighed, flopped back on his bunk. Potter had no subtlety. No finesse.
Harry’s t-shirt hits him in the face and falls to his lap. He stares at it, his heart beating a panicked rhythm. Draco won’t look at him. He swallows heavily and slides from the bed to put his shirt and pants on. He grabs his trousers from the bed and digs out his wand.
Dean’s already back to working on an auburn-haired model with a rakish set to his eyebrows. He doesn’t turn around to say, “White liner, white blusher. Shimmery, though.”
At the beginning of December, Hermione and Millicent left for Australia. Peep and Crookshanks were left behind, in Draco and Harry’s respective cares, which sucked since, of course, they were always in Harry’s rooms playing some weird cat game with Severia whenever he returned from the lab. He really had no idea how everyone was getting past his wards. Severia was a squib and therefore couldn’t—
Their Portkey took all three of them plus the Disillusioned alien to the Queen’s private garden. The reporters and other assembled Muggles were already waiting, some with cameras already rolling. There were scattered shrieks of alarm as they materialised in the garden, and Harry had his wand out immediately before he realised what was going on.
“And yet it doesn’t improve your personality at all,” Neville muttered under his breath. Harry snorted.
Harry shrugged, glanced down the table. Everyone was caught up in their own conversations. Millicent and Lavender had half of the far end engaged in a debate on the effects of werewolf attacks outside the full moon, and the second table seemed to be playing a huge game of gobstones around their dinner plates. “No one will miss us.”
“Why don’t we make sure we can do this before we do that,” Harry suggested. “And we can always make the office here at Grimmauld a working one.”
Silence stretched between them then. Harry heard little beyond the creaks of the castle as it settled, and his own forcefully slow breathing. He was
Potter followed his gaze and nodded. “Right—I dunno how close I want to be to the alien, to be honest, but I think I’d rather that than up here, all exposed to the sky.”
And through the whole time, not one of them said a word. The potion turned dark and sludgy, with a bubbling milky-white centre that moved and undulated as if it were alive. It was like looking down a tunnel of white light while dying. Harry stared at it, blinking hard.
“It’s a shithole,” Harry said bitterly, though already, he knew he was going to miss it. He leaned over the Ill-Effects Bag for a few moments longer, making sure he was done. Next time, he was booking a flight.
Harry took a moment to compose himself, but he soon realised that it would take much longer than a moment. “Fuck,” he breathed. He ran to catch up, with one last glare at the spirits,
Harry’s hidden skills, particularly with the science of magic, had yet to manifest. They returned to the school that day in silence for the first time ever. Hermione ran off to the library to meet her new Ravenclaw friends as soon as they entered the school. Harry almost invited Ron back to the Sett, but then remembered the curse. He wasn’t convinced it was real, but he’d rather test that on Goyle than Ron. And then he remembered that Hufflepuff was the only house not to allow students from other houses in.
Millicent scrunched her eyes closed. “Go to the press. I’d better see you on a Muggle telly by the end of the day. Then we’ll work on getting you home. And—Dudley, don’t go to sleep alone. Stay at a…at a hostel or something. With lots of people around. We’ll send you money.”
Millicent waved her hand at the alien. “Come take a look then. Poke it, prod it, take some blood samples, I don’t care. If you got someone who speaks Mandarin, come talk to it, even. That’s the only language we know it speaks.”
“What if Gemma’s right, though?” asked Rocco Kilgore, a Slytherin, saving Harry from answering. “What if the Muggles
Potter blinked, looked around the tent, grimaced. He heaved himself into a sitting position, using Draco’s chest for leverage, which was rude, and yawned. Even his yawning looked peeved.
Malfoy crawled into his bunk, slid to the side, pointedly saying nothing. Harry didn’t even bother to ask. Harry slid into bed beside Malfoy, slipped his wand under the pillow.
He’s an obsessive person; it’s no surprise that he obsesses over Draco, especially now. He’s still replaying Saturday morning in his head in between fretting about the case, but now, instead of wondering what he did or said wrong, he just thinks of the sleepy, satisfied look Draco’d worn in the brief moment between when they finished and when he’d kicked Harry out. His face had still been flushed and his eyes had been soft, and he’d looked so, so pleased to turn his head and find Harry occupying his second pillow. For a moment, Harry had—
The front steps were lined with tiny pots of succulents and there was a Christmas wreath on the door. Harry eyed all of this with confusion. Wasn’t it…a bit cold for all these flowers? Who the hell had Petunia sold her soul to to get blooms this late in the season?
Harry glanced at the clock, and then at Dudley, who shrugged. They had twenty minutes left of class, along with his standard issue Time-Turner the Ministry had signed out to him to handle multiple school trips in a single day.
The door closes as they prepare to begin the Rehearsal and the silence it leaves behind echoes around Harry and Malfoy. He just needs to check the hem. Again.
“You think they would actually help us?” Harry asked, head tilted. “It’s not like we’ve been ‘good neighbours.’ We did just try to
“Something will come to us,” said Narcissa. “In the meantime, shall I and Misses Patil and Granger begin on the Arithmancy for the ward? Mr Zabini, I believe you took it, too; are you confident in your skills?”
His skin was soaked, and the dungeon air chilled against it, but he noticed none of that. All he could feel was Draco’s fingers sliding up and down his shaft, and the feel of Draco’s beneath his own fingers. He knew when Draco got close. He could feel it in the way his kisses became fiercer, more desperate; in the way that the sounds he made became sharper. They sounded panicked to Harry, almost devastated—or maybe he was just projecting. It sent a rush of pleasure through him, and he surged into Draco’s hand, unable to prevent his hips from moving. Draco was close, so very close, and it was making Harry close, so very close.
, Millicent had advised. It was good advice. Harry knew well how boggarts worked. Sometimes it was weird that the absence of Draco hadn’t been his boggart. Sometimes it was hard to remember a time when Harry hadn’t wanted to be around him nearly as much as he wanted to breathe.
Harry still wasn’t sure how they’d got drunk enough that night after their divorce to create Albus Severus, but he reckoned they were both ecstatic they had. And anyway, Luna had always been a very big fan of the Harpies, and, apparently, their Seeker.
“I won’t, though,” Harry said. “That’s the problem. I can’t trust any one of them but Hermione, and she’s not really available.”
It was just that he could no longer separate ‘best mate’ and ‘love’ in his mind. How had he bollocksed this up quite so royally? He should’ve never given Malfoy up. And yet the thought of talking to him again, and knowing nothing would ever come of it felt like standing in Fiendfyre.
Harry slammed him against the door as soon as he was inside, pressing his body to Malfoy’s and tangling their fingers together above Malfoy’s head. “I couldn’t stop thinking about you,” Harry said between kisses. “Rio was horrible.”
Draco opened his mouth to reply, and then hesitated. “It’s amenable to change,” he said carefully, instead. “Gneiss wasn’t one of the stone types McGonagall set for me to transfigure...I did it on a whim, after we found that one. But, yeah, it’s metamorphic, and I didn’t expect it to take a change at all, much less a change to quartz, when it only had a very little bit to begin with.”
Mrs Black turned away from the frame, retreating to her painted desk and re-reading the same correspondence she’d been reading when she was painted. Harry had no idea who it was from or what it said, but it always softened the sharp frown lines on her face.
“I’ve not even done so much as write an op ed,” Harry said, tiredly. He really should’ve kept his mouth shut. Now he was going to have to deal with both countries distrusting him. “I’ll say this: My best guess is that the current administration doesn't trust anyone with my magical power level who could defeat a dark lord, no matter how little such a person might care about their oliga—I’m sorry, I mean their republic. You know how it is.”
He checked his watch. It was gone two, and they hadn’t even eaten lunch yet. They’d been too busy trying to figure out a plan for Dudley…and getting nowhere.
Into the silence, a melodramatic fourth year stated: “The week before Yule, and all through our House, not a Hufflepuff was stirring, not even Elouse.”
“Oh, god, it’s too late,” Mrs Dursley said, her voice high. “This is what I saw in my visions. They’ve started!”
Malfoy returned it, barely. He was uncomfortable talking to her, Harry could see. But the interesting thing about it was that he didn’t think it was because Sally-Anne had been Gryffindor. He thought it was because Malfoy just didn’t know her very well. It was funny how Malfoy now seemed so comfortable talking to Harry; he had trouble believing that Malfoy could be
He felt cold. Draco refreshed his warming charm for him, and Harry sent him a grateful look. “I think I’m figuring it out now,” Harry finally said. “Yes, I had that problem, too.”
“I agreed to give up my magic, not my life,” Millicent added. “In case it was unclear. I’m not drawing any fucking straws.”
Harry acted completely natural. Draco was by the Keurig, and both he and Narcissa had full cups of steaming coffee in their hands, and no spills on the countertops, so Harry was forced to consider the possibility that Draco Malfoy had learnt to use a Muggle coffee maker faster than he had.
Malfoy complied, and Harry crawled into his bed, immediately curling around Malfoy’s thin body. He tucked his chin over Malfoy’s shoulder. It positioned them both to stare at Malfoy’s mute wand, set next to an untouched glass of water.
He growls and presses his bum up as Draco nears his hole again and Draco’s slick finger slides in. Harry moans lowly. Draco’s chest tenses, his breath shuddering out over Harry’s neck. He lifts himself all the way up, settling on his knees somewhere behind Harry. His finger slides in and out and Harry sluttily follows the rhythm with his hips. Draco’s free palm settles over his hip, rubbing smooth circles over his hip and arse.
He decided to take the extra time to get a few more tests going on the samples he’d collected in the Bay yesterday. Still yawning, he shuffled down to his lab, fed Seabiscuit, and got the tests going. He was about to head up when he remembered that he’d promised to bring his seahorse up to the kitchen for a better view.
Professor Switch dismissed them, and Hermione had to kick Harry under the table before he understood what was happening. He swished all of his things into his bag without even ensuring his ink was capped. Potions was next, and he could always use a siphoning spell.
At the front of the room, Theo and Padma stood facing one another. They summoned a golden Protego to encircle them and took hold of the ends of the other’s wand with their free hand, creating a circle of power between them.
This story is part of an on-going anonymous fest hosted at hd_erised @ livejournal.com. The author will be revealed January 9th.
“You know what I meant,” said Harry, staring angrily at his own green inkwell. “I don’t want to only be good for dark lord defeating and printing gossipy stories about.”
Left alone in the gloomy interior of Grimmauld Place once again, Harry could think of only one thing:
Hermione’s eyes narrow, but she doesn’t say anything. Harry stares at the bowl of food she’s put in front of him and wonders if they have Chicken Kashmiri in Beirut.
“Wizards are known to banish rubbish to the sea,” Padma said, gently pulling them back on track. “There’s lots of trash floating out there.”
“The Magical-NonMagical Coalition for an Advantageous Teamwork—MCAST—will help us to continue to understand how to live together, though we have lived separately for so long, and help us prepare future generations for our final fight against the Creators.
They’re surrounded, he knows, but he isn’t bothered because he and Draco have been surrounded like this a million times. If he jumps out and takes a blasting curse to the chest, Draco will be right there, reversing the damage even as it starts to take effect, and Harry will keep going, manically pleased with battle and fighting and life in general as he takes out two dozen wizards with just his wand and that strange headspace he gets in situations like this. He’s in that headspace now, flinging curses like a man possessed (been there, done that, but it happens every now and again).
It was weird sitting here with Malfoy on the first day of his first term at Hogwarts, chatting about the impending doom of all magical cultures. But no one else wanted to chat about it. People were tense, but no one, Harry could tell, had the same sense of eeriness that he did. No one else felt like all of their futures were unraveling all at once, and even the Oracle Cassandra wouldn’t be able to find them a path forward again. No one else but Malfoy.
“Morning, Harry!” he said. He panned the camcorder down and back up again, and Harry, belatedly, covered his groin with his hands. Fuck, he hoped he didn’t have morning wood. “How are you feeling?”
“The opposite of universal poison, obviously,” said Draco. Harry smirked. Now who was starting to sound like Snape? Or maybe, Draco was starting to sound like
It was an endurance test not to sigh with relief in front of them. He was so relieved to be done with the lesson, to have a few minutes to collect himself while they practiced, before the next class came in.
“You realise you can read yourself?” Draco reminded him. “I distinctly remember teaching you three years ago.”
Luna is unconcerned. “We could possibly have the diffusers blow up from the floor—like a mysterious mist. In fact, that might work better, as the Amortentia won’t have as far to travel to reach the audience.”
Ron shakes his head. “Nah. She’s a cool Crup. Never pisses on the couch or anything, and besides, Harry’d go mad without her around, which is basically what he’d do without me, so it seemed fair.”
“Morning Hermione, morning Harry,” Lavender said, as she set a spoon to stir Mr Weasley’s tea. Fleur, sitting two seats down next to Bill, and Angelina next to George, both sent Hermione horrified looks, to which Hermione grimaced in response. Bonding over inadequacy, Harry could well understand. He set Snape’s portrait on the table and refused to meet George’s eyes afterwards.
“Nevertheless, things happen when people who are attracted to one another are left alone in a room with a bed.”
But it wasn’t really normal, was it? Somewhere in the Atlantic, there was a huge fucking island that Muggles would not be able to pretend had always been there.
For some reason, Harry couldn’t quite stop looking at Draco. It was like Draco was a different person now, after last night. For all the years of his crush, and the years following when he’d realised he was stupidly in love with him, Harry had never been unable to look away from Draco. He’d always been something wanted, kind of needed, but who just wasn’t possible.
this so much. Malfoy’s first finger slid slowly inside. Harry gasped. He canted his hips up, aching for more contact, more movement, just
Magic pulled into him and out of him like Atlantean waves. He could feel Potter’s magic mingling with his own again—and Granger’s and Millicent’s too. He knew their magic intimately and completely in a way he’d never even known his own before. And he knew they felt his, too. It felt freeing and vulnerable at the same time.
all this time, you know. I couldn’t ruin that. I thought about it—I thought about it constantly, but I just… I couldn’t make the decision. I didn’t fucking commit.”
There was a black Rolls Royce waiting for them out front, the driver mysteriously hidden by deeply tinted windows. Kyle and Quincy hopped in, Libby following. Harry ducked down and found the inside was magically expanded like a limousine.
He unlaces Draco’s trousers and slowly tugs the flies apart, grinning as Draco’s cock springs free. Draco’s face is intent, his eyes focused on Harry’s mouth, his breath coming in shallow little huffs. Harry licks his lips and Draco’s stomach clenches, his fingers thread into Harry’s hair and tighten.
It gives him a bit of a halfie. He sometimes forgets what it’s like to hear his last name—and when Malfoy says it, it’s…special. Hot.
“As if you made Atlantis appear all by yourself. They have a much higher opinion of your abilities than I do.”
Harry pushes through the crowd, looking for a particularly blond head of hair. He finds Malfoy by the bar, stuffing his face with crudités. He glances up as Harry approaches, an olive oil-drizzled carrot stick half in his mouth. He crunches down as his eyes scan from Harry’s face to his groin and back up again. He swallows, smirks.
She takes that very positively, pushing her lean frame against his even more. She’s tall and athletic with short, curly black hair. Decidedly androgynous, and not his usual type, but, there’s something about the look in her eyes that’s working for Harry right now. When her hand lands on his hip and she smiles at him, he doesn’t even think about it; he leans in and kisses her. Her fingers tighten around his hipbone and she groans, and fuck, he wishes he could groan, too. When she tugs on his hand and begins leading him out of the club, Harry goes willingly.
He extracted himself as carefully as possible, but Potter whined again, his fingers sleepily clutching at Draco’s t-shirt.
“Draco.” Theo’s voice was so blank and devoid of emotion that Harry knew at once he was having one of those ‘Slytherin panics’.
Hermione jumped up, upsetting Rosie’s milk and not bothering to right it. She grabbed Harry’s arm as he stepped towards the Floo. Harry spun around, glowering. She ignored this. “Read your damned owls, Harry.”
He tacked it to the dressing room wall with an economical sticking spell and then set three cloaks floating before Harry. The first was sleek, slender, with fitted sleeves; the second was fuller, lined in deer-skin and lined with jackalope fur around the hood and hems. The third was similarly lined minus the jackalope fur trim, and had spell-working sleeves.
“I think I’ll call her Perky,” Malfoy mused. He was deflecting. He was leaving it up to Harry, not wanting to influence him one way or another. Harry could have what he wanted; he just needed to take.
Draco gave him a nod in return. Potter followed, and Draco tried not to get annoyed at the brighter smile Piers gave him. It really wasn’t the time to be jealous and anyway, Potter was too dazed to even notice. Once they were all ashore, Draco led them through the ruins of the Queen’s garden into her receiving room.
“I know!” Hermione wails, and hugs Harry even harder before launching herself off him and bending over the bed to—carefully—hug Draco as well. Draco stares at Harry in horror over her head, awkwardly patting her on the back and trying to keep Twin One from getting a face full of hair in the meantime.
Harry turned back to the Headmistress. “I want to be a Potions Master,” he repeated. “That’s my choice.”
He felt the exhalation of air against his prick as Draco laughed, and then warm fingers closed around his shaft, and he nearly came from it. Draco stroked him, completely at his leisure, the cocky git.
Harry decided that he had to know precisely what Draco tasted like. He had to know the satisfaction of having Draco’s come floating around in his belly, weird as that was. He tugged him up and pushed him back until Draco fell backwards on his bed, spread out and flushed from, in Harry’s opinion, a job well done.
Yaxley rolled his eyes, but did dig out a pristine Ron Weasley Frog card from his wallet. Ron tucked it into Draco’s collection, smirking, and finally took a seat on the Corbeille couch. They waited patiently for Draco to return, and Draco certainly tested their patience with his absence. He did not reappear for another half hour, when the corridors outside the office filled with children’s voices.
They started packing up, most with more enthusiasm than Mandy. Harry wasn’t one of them; his body was loaded with adrenaline – this was really fucking scary, to be quite honest. He just kept thinking about having to go back to the Muggle world because his magic had disappeared, having to live with the Dursleys.
He swallows. Because he is not yet strong enough to be an Apex Unspeakable. He does not yet have that much control over his own body or emotions. He might never.
Harry glared at him, then spun on his heel and stomped upstairs. He’d hardly unpacked. There wasn’t much to pack away. The bed was still unslept-in. He tossed his laundry into the Grimmauld Place attic and collected Mrs Black’s portrait.
“What!” he whispered. His face heated up and he tried to hide it in the voluminous collar of his black apprentice robes.
He watches Draco intently as he begins to push forward, attuning himself to every piece of Draco’s body, watching for tensing shoulders, for a moue of discomfort or pain on Draco’s face, pressed as it is halfway into a pillow. The tip of Harry’s cock breaches him and he does tense, his breath leaving him in a great whoosh, but when Harry tries to pull out, he reaches back and grabs tightly onto the wrist by his hip.
Harry shook his head, amazed. “How do you know all this? You didn’t even use a computer when I lived with you,” Harry said.
been here all along. It is only that they thought they’d solved their problem with our kind when Atlantis disappeared.”
“The Portkey’s not working,” Malfoy muttered, frowning down at the conch shell. “It was a multi-use—it should take us straight back.”
Harry rolled his eyes but in truth he didn’t mind. He really didn’t mind too much when he was with Draco. Even when they fought, which happened surprisingly rarely (perhaps it was a Hufflepuff thing) Harry liked being around him. Draco led him to the top of a hill beyond the Shrieking Shack and, finally, stopped at the top.
“I,” Harry said, trailing off. His mouth gaped. He cleared his throat. He thought of Ron. His eyes narrowed. He smirked. “I’m really grateful my best friend Ron Weasley signed me up for this programme. Most blokes have a best friend, probably, but no one’s got a best friend like Ron. He’s the most caring, most compassionate man I’ve ever met. He’s so strong and masculine, but inside, he’s like a gentle puffskein. He’s home with the baby right now while his beautiful wife, my other best friend, Hermione, is here with me. I don’t think I sent home any potential soul mates last night, but I’m comforted by the knowledge that even if I don’t find my perfect sexual match here on the Stag Shag, I’ll at least have my perfect best friend match waiting for me back home.”
And right then, in that moment, there in the low light of a dusty, dead office, Harry knew no one was going to get it like Malfoy did. Malfoy had believed him first. And that made Malfoy important.
The cat regarded him, blinking slowly. Draco was now scratching her behind the ears and she was accepting it regally, like a queen condescending to have her hand kissed by a peasant.
“I notice I’m only in that list once, and not even at the end,” Harry said as he jumped the stairs two at a time. “Arguably, the end is supposed to be the biggest point.”
On the train, they took a cabin with Susan, Neville, and Millicent, who Hermione had—bizarrely—befriended after McGonagall roomed them together back in September. Harry had never been more pleased to room with Neville, as the only other boys who’d returned for eighth year were Malfoy, Goyle, Zabini, and that overly-happy Ravenclaw, Boot.
He thought maybe it was the way that Malfoy always seemed to be there, always seemed to be next to him, his body warm and solid and as if it were connected to Harry on some fundamental, basic level that Harry’d never experienced with anyone else before. It was sort of amazing, really. It reminded him of how Ron and Hermione always seemed to be glued together, how they seemed to be able to read one another’s minds and just know what the other was thinking, how their magic seemed so compatible and how amazed Harry always was when Ron would pick up Hermione’s wand to summon a fresh nappy for Rosie and it would work just fine.
Malfoy gave him a wan smile. “Thanks, Potter. Delighted to have you yet again saving days...this time mine.”
While he and Hermione had only grown closer in their belated seventh year, Ron now seemed like an entirely different person. Maybe he
“Then we went to see the United Seas of the Pacific Nation next,” said Padma. “And they had totally different concerns. There are oilrigs along the Pacific coast, too, but the Mers are less concerned about that and more concerned about the storm drains from the major Southern California cities that empty into the ocean at intervals along the coast. As it is, there isn’t any point along the coast where they can safely live any longer, and Mers are coastal, not wide-ocean, beings. They need to be near land to live. So Chieftess Kailani wanted us to divert the storm drains and find a way to clean the water they put out, plus she also mentioned an island of plastic and rubbish.”
, he thinks. Draco looks his way; their eyes hold, their eyes let go; Harry pays the cashier and he leaves.
It was all brilliant, and Harry had to see him fall apart again, had to know that it was happening because of the things Harry was doing. He pulled away and replaced his mouth with his hand, stroking fast and hard. He propped himself up and stared at the gorgeous look of abandon on Draco’s face.
The waiter returned with their drinks, but they didn’t acknowledge him, staring at each other and people walking by. Draco toyed with his beer glass, picked at some bread in a very posh manner. “Do you ever use your Animagus form?” he asked.
“And now look at it from Draco’s perspective,” says Luna. “His father’s dead, his mother moved to Italy, he’s all alone in that big, dusty manor that, I’m sure, holds more bad memories for him than it does for me, and even though he graduated in the same Auror class as you and Ron and Susan, he’s still a Junior Auror while the rest of you have been promoted. He’s a highly specialised Auror with a track record equal to your own. He’s earned the chance for a good career.”
“I’m very proud of the man you’ve become, Harry,” she said at last. “You are a great credit to our House.”
Malfoy grinned devilishly and Harry wondered why he had ever bothered with wanking to Malfoy when he could’ve had this so much sooner. The past few weeks were a blur of anxiety and exuberance, of being scared witless and finally feeling like he was in the right place.
Malfoy inclined his head. “I thought you were having me on, I admit. But here you are, studying Potions.”
The day that story came out, McGonagall and Flitwick had run from the breakfast table without a word. At dinner, the Headmistress announced, somewhat bemusedly, that there were twelve new names on the Hogwarts registry, due for letters in six years.
Harry blushes, turning back to the bread that he’s mostly just torn up into pieces instead of eating. He hooks his foot into the strap of his linen knapsack. He should really go back to that bar and see if anyone’s found his hat.
By taking Atlantis itself out of time—out of existence, really—and storing it safely in another dimension in space, a dimension without time—they were able to fully hide from the aliens. No technology, no matter how advanced, would be able to counter it.
Those are the most beautiful words Harry’s ever heard. He pulls Draco to him and crashes their mouths together. He doesn’t know how they got here, really. The whole thing feels unreal, a little like a video game where the objective was to make it out alive and instead he’s decided to stay trapped here with Draco. He doesn’t care though. He’s used to traps, and as far as they go, Beirut is a good one. Outside, the sun sets over the Mediterranean. Draco’s hair catches sun flares and heats Harry up from the inside out. Things are heavy between them. There’s gravity.
The door beside him creaked open, and Draco peered in. His eyes fell on Harry, took in his disgruntled expression. He stepped inside and shut the door behind him. “There you are.”
While the rest of their house stopped in the kitchens to get celebratory drinks and snacks (Hufflepuffs were always eating, but they did run around
“Not if Hufflepuff can help it,” Hannah said firmly. “And besides, we aren’t unlucky. We’ve got warning. The rest of the world doesn’t since their magic flows without tethering.”
Plus there was his weird Muggle cousin—somehow a teacher at Hogwarts, too. His weird Muggle cousin who Draco, oddly, liked.
Harry gave her a flat look. “I am twenty-nine, Hermione. If I haven’t learned patience yet, it’s not going to magically appear.”
Harry stared down at the notes on Wolfsbane potion, mind blank. It was so rare that Malfoy displayed his uncertainties. And now he was doing it in front of Harry.
There are people talking all around him but he can’t understand them, can’t hear anything but Draco laughing and saying his name. It’s like standing in the middle of a Currys with every model telly on a different football game and Draco is every team, even though Draco hates football and hate Harry’s telly and would never go to a Currys. Someone takes his hand and he is pulled forward. There is a burst of magic, and in that moment, Harry feels everything real he’s ever felt for Draco be sucked away.
“Slowly,” said Harry. “Properly. I… I shouldn’t have done what I did that day in our office. I should’ve told you that I’d wanted you for years, that it was more than just sex. I shouldn’t have made you think it was only about a fuck.”
