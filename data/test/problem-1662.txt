progress?” she asked.
“Harry?” Hermione was frantic. “Now?”
Draco bit back a smile. “We did that too.”
Some horrible sound emits from his chest and Draco doesn't have it in him to care. Harry’s lets his head fall until it rests gently on Draco’s hips.
“There’s a good kitty,” Draco whispers, as Bob opens his mouth in a little yawn. “My sweet, sweet boy. My darling cat, such a big yawn.”
“We slept!” Harry finally looks up at Ron, properly. “Draco was in no state for sexy-times.”
Potter’s laughter got louder which made Emily laugh more, until she slumped against the counter and slid to the floor.
come back to you. This is True Love,” he insisted. “The normal rules of the universe no longer apply.”
After a few moments, almost-but-not-quite Draco stops. “I had forgotten how angry I was at seeing that,” he explains. He laughs again, but this time it’s softer and more gentle. “I’m sure you have a lot of questions.”
“I can’t!” he shouted back. “The life of the potions are made so they lock in the weather for the life of the event—”
“Ugh,” Draco said. “He’s fine. If you beat him up they’ll only blame it on me.”
Harry didn’t answer, instead, he pulled Draco close and kissed him gently. He must have lost his mask on the way down the hill because Draco was able to look at his beautiful face. “Can you walk?” Harry asked, concerned.
“His mother was one of the best people I’ve ever met,” he said softly.
“Draco,” other Draco says carefully. “Harry sees us for who we really are. He doesn’t mind our prickly edges, and I think he likes our verbal sparring more than he’ll admit. He snores and is a terrible bed-hog, but he gives us a place that finally feels like home for the first time since the war. He’s a cranky bastard before his first cup of coffee and he has terrible taste in clothes and music, but when you sleep by his side you’re going to feel safer than you ever have. I promise you, we will never be happier than I am now. He’s infuriating but he’s ours. I don’t know why he chose us, but he did and you should just accept the fact that Harry Potter is the love of our life.”
Ron winced. “I don’t know how you do it, mate.”
“I think I always leave because...because I don’t know how to stay.”
So what if he had a little crush on Harry.
After saying their goodbyes to Hermione as she flooed home, Harry and Draco had retreated to their room (Harry’s room, since it was the biggest, but Draco didn't have a problem with that), and started to get ready for bed. Hermione had left Draco with some things to think about, but for right now, all he wanted to do was curl up in bed and sleep for forever. It had been a long day, and Draco was absolutely shot. He could tell Harry was getting there too, as he was yawning too much for one who ensures that he’s fine. Even with his Alpha energy, Draco could tell Harry was undeniably exhausted.
“I think I’ll just go now.” He said sadly. His friends were always to busy for him.
Then Draco turned from on to crushed (and a little embarrassed), because he knew Harry would never want him like that. As he watched his husband dive beneath the waves, he knew Harry would never want to be with him.
He was positive he didn’t put that on himself. He wasn’t thinking about what he was doing when he left. Then he realized it was only him and Harry staying on this private side of the beach.
Shocked, Draco replied "Why would I? It's your house."
“What a bloody maniac he is.” Ron huffed, as he and the other boys came into the dorm.
“But what?” Draco interrupted.
“I know of your… infatuation. I don’t like you that way, or in any way, but I’m stuck with you for Merlin-knows how long. I beg you, Malfoy, make it easier for us and stop acting like you want to devour me.” Harry pleaded.
“Yeah, the weather was great over there.” Harry said.
The words “please don’t,” that came from the blond made Harry’s heart squeeze. They sounded so sad, lonely even.
“Holy fuck, Potter, Harry I mean. You fucking ruined me.” Draco said, giggling wetly, wiping his face then wrapping his hands around Harry’s neck.
“Are you sure that’ll hold him?” Hermione asked.
“What?” Harry said, getting up to look at him. “Why would you think that?” He sounded worried.
“Oh my Merlin, Harry...I’m holding you to that promise.” Malfoy said seductively.
Draco sighed. “Ok, cause, I know I can be very forward sometimes, but I only want to do things we both agree on. And you’ve been very clear about this whole situation, and I truly respect your opinions.”
Harry shook his head. “No. I did it. I told them.”
“Ravish me.” he whispered in Draco’s ear.
A hand snuck down between them, undoing Draco’s trousers’ button. Harry tried his best to remove them with one hand, but a few minutes and a sore forearm later, he’d given up trying to do it while still on top of Draco. He stood up and in one quick motion, relieved Draco of his burdening clothing. He giggled lightly, while Harry stared at his half hard prick.
“You are not kissing me when you're sick. And what does the comforter have to do with anything?”
Harry regarded him like he was a mad man. “Do you think that little of me?”
Draco breathed in deeply, trying to think of how to ask. “Well, I was thinking, wondering more like, because well, I don’t know, I don’t even know if you know, but, well-” Draco rambled before he was interrupted by a chuckle from Harry.
“Why, did you have something in mind?” Potter said with a smirk. His eyes were closed but Draco knew they’d be shining if they were open.
His nose was stuffy and his body ached. But he wasn't sick. He couldn't be. Malfoy's don't get sick… right?
He went to pull away from Harry to leave, but Harry wouldn’t have that. He gripped his Omega and pulled him into an embrace.
Draco sighed and said “Don't hold your breath.”
“Our family.” Harry repeated and kissed his head.
“Ok, ok. Neither have I. G-go slow, kay?” Harry looked truly scared.
Silver hair.
Boyfriend. It was still so new. He’d never had a boyfriend before. He wasn’t even really gay, not that he had anything against it, he just never really considered it. The only reason he had one now, was because he was actually his mate. That was new too, but he was ok with that. More than ok, actually, cause he really liked this Harry. The one he never really got the chance to know back at Hogwarts.
I was requested to write some angst but I'm horrible at it. I tried to add a little in this one but I don't know, what do you guys think? Also, Harry kind of makes the first move. I know there's not a lot of feelings in this, but there will be soon.
Harry took the bags to the cab as Draco did one last sweep of their little resort. All seemed in order. He then looked around fondly and took in the place where they created some of their first memories, which he was sure to miss. A pair of arms snaked around his middle as a head rested on his shoulder.
“Well?”
Draco stayed silent for a minute before saying “Ok, I'll be right back.” He left and a moment later returned with a thick book from the library. “I just wanted to read, if that's alright.”
“Took you longer this time.” He says somewhat hesitantly.
“She was persistent.” he defended.
“This is ridiculous. I’m going to Kingsley.” Harry said in his best ‘im putting my foot down’ tone.
When Harry had finally joined him in the limo, Draco couldn’t help but notice the way Harry shifted as far away from him as possible, while on the other side of the vehicle.
Harry nodded. But, he felt bad for the blond, in a way. Not being able to control what you said or did? That’s scary. Malfoy was going to be absolutely humiliated when he returned to normal. Oh well, you get what you deserve, right? Harry knew all about that.
He didn’t speak for the rest of the night.
“You were doing really good, Harry. We can’t imagine what you’re going through…” Hermione faded, obviously not continuing her thought.
“I was just thinking, how I am with you now rather than anyone else.” Draco leant back to look up at Harry.
“What? What could you possibly want more from me?”
“Ok, but you’re good at hair too, great actually. You were smart to pursue that.” Potter said.
“Malfoy…” Snap said, trying his best to pull him off of Harry’s back. “I know you’re in better control than this.” He snarled, now forcefully ripping the blonds hands off of Harry.
Draco had been polite at the wedding and showed the same attitude now, so they assumed he had everything under control.
Harry's nails almost dug into the wood as his hands gripped onto the bench for dear life, as no one raised their hand for a few silent moments.
Now Harry was afraid that Draco was upset at him. Harry knew his friends meant it in a way that he get a hobby for him to have a regular routine again, to feel a bit more human with a schedule, instead of just being at home all the time. Not that he didn’t like being at home, especially with Draco, but the days did seem to just blur all together. It certainly wasn’t meant in a way to offend Draco.
“She used to be my favourite,” Draco admits. “Aunt Bella.”
“You deserved it,” she said with an embarrassed smile, dark skin hiding what Draco hoped was an answering blush.
Things are going well. Scorpius is between his first and second year at Hogwarts and while they’re out, they buy the majority of his school supplies he needs for September. Scorpius meets his friends for ice cream, as Draco looks around Flourish and Blotts. He finds and purchases the latest romance/spy novel Pansy had written. Draco does his obligatory grumbling about having to buy his best friend’s novel—at a shop no less!—while Pansy’s portrait laughs at him from the back cover. Draco buys the book anyway.
“Rule number twelve!” Molly shouted after a few seconds and after several more streams of water had hit Harry.
The man in black looked at Draco with a sneer. “They were both poisoned. I worked at Knockturn Alley with its creator and built up an immunity.”
older brothers
“Maybe we can look into getting you an owl,” Draco suggests as he walks to his writing desk. “If you want a pet…”
“Do you think this could be a trap?” Bellatrix asked.
“I like Emily,” he said. “She reminds me of Gin.”
With that vague statement, she turned to walk toward the room in the back.
and watches as Draco’s whole demeanour changes and he becomes closed off.
Blaise held up a long finger. “I’m gorgeous.” He held up another finger. “I’m hilarious.” A third finger went up. “I’m ever so cultured.” A fourth. “I’m gorgeous,” he repeated.
Harry sighs. “Call me Harry, Draco. We’re too old, and our kids are friends. None of that old Hogwarts bullshit.”
“Draco’s never a terror,” Harry says, offended on his husband’s behalf.
, but I didn’t realise it was that
“Um,” Draco said uncomfortably. “That’s a lovely invitation, really, but I think…” He grimaced. “I don’t think I’m up for more time with the Weasleys at their ancestral home.”
“No,” Harry whispers. “Don’t be sorry.” He gets off of Draco’s lap and sits by him, awkwardly.
Harry starts his exploration by kissing Draco’s forehead, then moving down to between his eyebrows, then the tip of his nose, then his mouth. He doesn’t spend long there, moving to nip at Draco’s earlobe, then down to suck a spot into Draco’s neck.
“I don’t know, Ron!” Harry shrieks. “You and Hermione see him outside of work more than I do!”
boats
“Move any closer and your precious prince will be dead,” he snarled.
“Ah yes, the classic definition of cricket. Well done, Draco.”
“Like this,” he said.
“Will you show me where it is?” Draco asks.
plus he likes you
Draco looked at him, askance. “You presume to know me, but you know nothing! I
“Never been an issue of being friends,” Harry says. “More of an issue of us
i thought harry wanted you to himself
“I don’t care if the sodding Minister for Magic calls it ‘We-Be’s’,” said Draco with a grimace. “The name is ridiculous enough on its own. Please just call it Weather-Be’s.”
“We were both little shits back then, weren’t we?” Draco asks, startling Harry.
Draco feels his face compress into a frown. “Fine, you don’t have to tell me how or when you got together,” he says. “But—”
“Why do we want to help start a war?” Ronald was frowning. Hermione reached out to pat his arm, trying to soothe him. She glared at Zacharias.
Draco pulled back his hand, fast. He thought Harry looked disappointed, but before he could confirm the look, Harry turned to look at Emily. Draco ignored them both and cast a quick charm to freshen himself up.
“Her?” Draco gasped out.
Other Draco barks out a laugh. “You know, I don’t know? I haven’t lived the part where he tells us.”
“No!” Draco says sternly, and
“That remains to be seen,” Draco said primly. “Are your friends going to accost me in my corner again?”
Ron left and Harry and Draco were left alone again in the kitchen.
Potter nodded. “Since we were eleven.”
“I never thought I’d like kissing Harry Potter so much,” he admitted when they stopped.
While Harry was deep in thought about relationships and Ginny and everything, Luna had walked away, leaving Harry dripping and bemused outside of the Weasley’s home.
“Why are you staring at me?” Potter asked.
“I’m Marked,” he said.
Draco pulled Harry close to him, breathing harshly. “Y- you—” he stuttered. “Saved me.”
“Harry!” Ginny shouted. “Come get your husband, he’s properly soused.”
“The usual, please,” Draco said, stiffly.
“We’ll be down soon,” Harry reassures him.
Feeling rage pulse through his veins, Draco shouted, “All you know is cruelty and mockery! I died that day!” Stalking closer to the pirate, he said, “And you can die, too, for all I care!” as he pushed Black down the hill.
“Isn’t that the point?”
“You’re very handsome, too,” Harry said, apparently reading Draco’s mind.
Harry wiggles on Draco's fingers and gasps when he delicately brushes Harry's prostate.
you it’s too tight!” Harry cries.
“Er,” Harry said as he walked into the kitchen. He stared at Draco for a moment before shaking his head and saying, “You
They went inside, which led to Draco stalking to his room and the subsequent gnawing of his elbow by sharp, small teeth.
“I don’t want your money,” Draco spat out. “I don’t need charity.”
“For my sake,” Harry says.
Harry cast a
“Your turn,” Draco says, still happy and pink.
Draco let out a sigh and smiled. “I was just thinking about how, even when we’re trying to be friendly, we still annoy the pants off of each other.”
“I don’t have any plans,” Draco says. “Are we going to have my belated birthday dinner?”
His mother waved her hand at him. “You know how I am with names,” she explained. “I just can’t remember anyone’s.”
They both groan when Harry's arse meets Draco's hips.
Draco spreads his legs and waits as Harry crawls between them. Harry scootches forward until his cock is bumping into Draco’s arse.
. And even if Harry still felt his face warm when he thought about his magic messing with Draco’s business, he tried to force the awkwardness down and start a conversation. From Draco’s smile when he mentioned his son’s name, he knew there was one subject on which they both agreed.
. “You know what you look like.”
,” Draco shrieked. He could
“No earlier than eight,” Harry counters.
“Well, generally it’s more about two blokes…” he trailed off. “But yeah, they’re fun.”
Draco glared at him. “Don’t you even want to know what I’ve ordered?”
“Have fun, Uncle Harry!” Rose shouted right after.
“Um,” Draco said. “You’ll have to let go of me first, Harry.”
After dinner, Harry went to Ron and Hermione’s to have a drink. The kids were in bed and Harry was enjoying being in his spot on the sofa. It was warm and cosy and Ron had good alcohol. Ron was sprawled out beside Harry, watching the fire while Hermione was in a squashy chair across the room looking at some files from the Ministry.
“Good!” Harry declared. “Can you please get inside me now?”
He lets out a little laugh. “Not really, no,” Draco replies and Harry’s heart breaks a little. “I’ll be fine. Let’s go to the scene and catch the arsehole who interrupted our date.”
Sighing, Harry lets himself roll over onto his stomach. “Fine,” he grumbles into his pillow. “But you owe me a blow job tomorrow morning.”
Draco nods and leans down to kiss Harry’s forehead. “An hour,” he acknowledges before turning and walking out of Harry’s bedroom.
He reaches in to turn the tap on hot and waits for it to start to heat. Draco comes up behind him and wraps his arms around Harry’s waist. They stand in silence until the glass starts to fog a little from the water, and Harry does a little temperature test. When he’s fiddled enough so that it’s still hot but not scalding, he turns and pulls Draco’s shirt off and his pants down. They’d taken off their trousers to nap, and Harry’s smiling at Draco’s sleepy compliance.
Harry doesn’t really like to travel, but when the Ministry tells someone they want them in Paris, in August when the weather is perfect and their children can stay elsewhere, that person had better well take their spouse.
That seems to be all it takes for Draco because his neck and back are arching up, his hips stutter under Harry, and his face, neck, and chest turn bright red. A few seconds later, he collapses like a rag-doll.
Draco hung up and dropped the phone like it had cast
“I mean,” Harry shivered. “Your hands are so cold.” In the almost-there light coming in from the streetlight, Harry could see Draco frown. “But yes, no, they’re fine where they are.”
“Yes, it would appear—”
“What did we say about knocking?” Draco asks, sharply.
Ginny nodded. “Yes,” she agreed. “No swimming for at least an hour after he’s taken it.” She held out a little bag for Luna to put the miracle pill in and then handed it to Hermione. Ron moved over to pick Harry up and they all walked out of the little house.
"And I promise, as soon as I catch up, I'll tell you. Because you said you were mine, but I'm also yours, Harry. For as long as you want me."
Draco laughed at him. “Reconnected?” he asked. “Is that how we’re framing it?” Harry smiled back at him. “We’re not going with ‘Harry bullied me into doing what I wanted to do’?”
“Me too.”
“I told you I didn’t want to do any work,” Draco says back.
“I’m staying with Emily and Stella tonight.”
“Harry, I need to come,” Draco says in a strained voice.
Blaise’s eyes got big and his mouth dropped. “I’m sex on a stick!” he insisted. “I’m a sex stick! I—”
“But—”
“It’s a Muggle thing.” Other Draco rolls his eyes. “Harry’s a nuisance.”
Draco’s mouth gaped open in an extremely unattractive manner and Harry felt his resolve strengthen. But…
Draco pulls his blanket more snugly around himself and lets out a little
a wand, but it was forged with Dark Magics and twists spells.” Bellatrix smiled, making Harry shiver from the cruel set of her mouth. “I am a…” she thought for a moment. “I would consider myself an aficionado of pain. And this,” she waved the wand, “helps me with my experiments. I’m currently working on a book about it, so as we progress, I would like it if you were completely honest with me. I have Veritaserum, but it can sometimes skew the results.”
cut off from our world, Potter,” Draco spat out. Because yes, he didn’t know much about what was going on, but he did know his best friend was dating a Gryffindor.
Bob’s paws twitch in his sleep and Draco can’t keep back a soppy smile. He leans into Harry, kissing him on the shoulder and smiling when Harry kisses the top of his head.
"No," Harry agrees. "But you've changed, Draco. You're not that hateful little boy anymore."
“It’s because I like you, you wanker!”
Pansy cackled and Draco whirled around to look at her. “What are you doing here?” he demanded.
“Apparently the owners are moving to Cornwall,” Stella said.
“Ah,” Malfoy says back.
Harry gave me his number. Call him
ginger
With another little laugh, Draco pulls Harry into another kiss. They trade lazy, almost chaste kisses for a few moments before Draco opens his mouth and lets Harry in. He welcomes Harry’s tongue and caresses it with his own. Harry moves to straddle Draco and his hips start to shift in Draco’s lap.
sentimental, he is on a date with you.”
I'm going into business with, it’s more the idea of opening a shop in the middle of nowhere.”
“No,” whispered Draco. “He was poor and kind; a farmboy employed by my parents’ estate. He was more beautiful than I ever thought possible. He had darker colouring than me,” Draco waved his pale arm, “his skin a warm mahogany, and his hair as black as pitch, but so soft and thick. His eyes were like emeralds behind his glasses. But more precious to me grab his beauty was the generosity of his heart. Harry—” Draco let out a gasp. “He sailed the seas to help me save my family’s farm. But
“Have you been reading Molly’s romance novels?”
“Hey!” Potter said.
“Oh, yes,” Harry answers. He puts as much heat into his voice as possible and says, “I want you to open me up and fuck my arse.”
“Language, Ronald!” Hermione hisses with a look towards Rose, but she’s too busy stuffing her face with mashed food to pay attention.
Before his son is swept off by his best friend, Draco hugs Scorpius again. “I love you,” he says, too low for anyone but Scorpius to hear.
can take on sixty guards in front of one entrance. If we had a wheelbarrow, we might be able to do something…” Harry trailed off.
Draco shifted his feet. “What about me? He’s not my friend. You should go. You haven’t seen him in a long time. And we can plan dinner for another night.”
Ron followed a few minutes later, Malfoy bound with an Incarcerous, Levitating beside him.
“Just a little bit. I just got in here before you came in.”
He considered his options. He could leave Harry, hoping that he could somehow break the prophecy that way. A significant amount of distance between the two of them must make the magic entwined with the prophecy unreadable, therefore the two of them would be free of each other.
“Merlin, no, that’s not why I’m-. Hmph.” He sighed. “I just enjoyed it, and I want to do it again.” Harry drifted off, getting quieter after each word.
“Potter!” rang throughout the common room.
Harry shook his head. “Nope. That woman is destined to get me killed by that raging maniac.”
Draco picked the envelope up again and flipped it over one more time. It was thin, maybe containing a single piece of parchment. The front stated it was to one ‘Stacy Martins, Department of Magical Creatures, 6th Station”. He ran his wand over it, muttering a simple Revelio, which deemed it harmless. He had no idea what to do next. He silently watched the other workers who picked one up, muttered a few incantations, stated clearly to where the envelope was from through the pipe that hung in front of their stations, and sent the envelope through. It glowed green for a second and the envelope was gone.
The music started, the people stood, and Harry felt the tightness in his throat return. Willing himself to leave his tie alone, he repeated Ginny’s parting words you’ll be fine, you’ll be fine like a mantra in his head.
“You can, when I’m dressed and out of the shower.”
“Draco, what were you and Harry doing before he had his seizure?” She asks.
Harry, confused and a little scared, raced off to the common room and waited for his friends to arrive.
Tears was the wrong word, though. They were sobs- heart wrenching, mind-numbing sobs that made Harry want to cry.
Draco woke with his face pressed into the soft, knit quilt that covered Harry’s hospital bed, and a hand gently caressing his hair. He focused on the pure sensation of comfort he felt for a few moments, before he registered that the hand was most likely Harry’s, and that he was finally awake. He turned his face to look at Harry, who was sitting up and smiling down at him.
“Ron.” Harry said in a tone that shut down any incredulous retort Weasley would have come up with.
Ron looks confused and Hermione looks thoughtful then concerned.
Walkins nodded. “Right you are. If one is more likely to upset the prophecy more than the other, only he who disrupts it will feel the effects of it. If you both upset it, you will both feel pain. Even after you two are certain of your feelings for one another, you still might experience ‘ghosting’ pain. That’s just the prophecy alerting you that the magic is still there. The pain won’t be as strong as in the beginning, but you will still feel it.
They talked about how they were going to deal with this new situation Harry got himself in. Harry did feel blessed though, because despite getting himself in such a mess, his friends were there to help him, and for that he was very grateful for. They talked until it was dinner time, in which Dean had to unbind Malfoy from his state of petrification.
Finally once the classes ended, Harry gathered his things and approached Snape’s desk, where he sat, flipping mindlessly through parchment. Malfoy followed closely behind him, but keeping a good physical distance.
He sighed. “I wouldn’t get on with it, so he said something, uh ‘I’ll find someone that’s able to’ you know…”
Draco just blinked up at him.
“Ready for another?” He asked, before sitting up and with a renewed energy, started pounding away into Draco.
“So,” Ron began. Him and Harry had entered the study and Ron went to pour them both a drink while Harry took a seat on the sofa.
“You’re an ass. You know that? Fuck you.” Draco stood and made his way to the bedroom to get away.
Draco came, sobbing into the pillow he was attempting to rip apart with his teeth.
The heat helped to soothe his aching muscles and morning headache quite well. He didn’t hear Malfoy for a few minutes, so he thought he must’ve left. As he was finishing up, he heard the ruse of fabric behind him and turned around to see a very pale, very naked, and very much there Draco Malfoy.
Harry chuckled a little. “Rightly too, I suppose. I am your husband, after all.” He responded with a wink.
As soon as they stepped out of the office, Hermione and Ron enveloped Harry in a big hug.
“I think I’m done for the night,” Harry said. He stood to leave, but a throat being cleared brought his attention back.
I'm seriously hoping to get this story done soon. I have so many more that I want to finish, I just never have enough time for them. Hope you enjoyed this update!! :)
“Only for you, baby.”
“Yeah, I guess we could go to the pub with the boys.” Harry said.
"Hey, no no, it's ok." Harry said, trying to reach out to him. He decided that Draco needed to be distracted so he gestured to the table. "Come, sit. I didn't mean to push, I'm sorry." He said, taking a seat across from where he gestured to the Omega. "It's ok, we don't have to talk." With that, he picked up his fork and began stabbing tiny pieces of pasta before shoving it in his mouth.
“Cuba.” Draco said when he caught up to Harry’s side. “That’s where they have sent us.”
“Hey mate.” He said, walking straight over to Harry to give him a big hug. They stuck together like glue, those two, whispering in each other’s ears and giggling like school girls. Draco was a little jealous, not that he’d ever say that, though.
He gently removed himself from around Harry and walked back to their room. He threw on a pair of Harry's old boxers cause they were extremely comfortable and they kept him cool in the summer. When he got ready for bed that night, he hadn’t realized he'd have to break them out so soon. Not that he was complaining though.
He looked up and
When Draco came down to the kitchen, he found Harry at the stove and the table set. On it were plates, utensils and tea, but devoid of any food. “What’re you making?”
“Yeah, I actually wanted to ask him if I could transition to a teacher in the training academy, but he came out with that and I couldn’t refuse. Plus the benefits are pretty nice.” Harry grinned.
“I want to be with you,” Malfoy spoke quieter with each sentence he spoke.
Having gotten a pass from Pansy, Draco stood in the doorway to the Auror offices, looking over all the cubicles that housed the Junior and Senior Auror staff. His eyes scanned the crowded room, a sea of scarlet robes overwhelming his visual senses. With trepidation, he marched through the crowd, making his way to the back of the offices, where he knew Harry’s desk was located. He knew this, of course, from Pansy who frequented the DMLE offices as she did the rest of the Ministry.
Harry stared at this submissive depiction of his feisty Omega.
“You're home early.”
Ron and Hermione just stared at them as if they were in a different universe.
Maroon fucking hair.
“I’m fine.” she said, rounding the bed and kissing his cheek affectionately. “Ron had to go into George’s this morning. He regrets not being able to see you, but he says hi. He’s doing well too.”
“That sounds like fun. Better than what I’ll be doing, probably.” Harry chimed in, clearly trying to lift the mood.
“Ha, yeah. I suppose it’s better now that it’s not so empty, eh mate.” Ron laughed as Harry pushed him away.
Thanks again for the great feedback, and please review!
“You’re my forever.”
Harry breathed in his scent and kissed him again, and again, and again, until they were breathless and panting.
“I’m a little concerned about the effects of this prophecy. Harry had revealed to me the other night after our first visit, that he experiences pain when we’re not together. I assume that’s due to the prophecy trying to get us to connect more with each other.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Flour, blows, eggs, sugar and cook books littered every surface. Harry saw Draco on his tiptoes in front of a cupboard trying to reach a hand mixer.
“Turn over, I want you to suck me.” Draco said.
“Can I come in?” She asked politely.
“I love it when you call me that.” Draco admitted.
“Morning, handsome.” Harry said with a sly smile.
Ok, now, he was really upset at Harry. No, they hadn’t talked about exposing their relationship, and he did expect their friends to find out, but he at least thought they’d tell them together. “He told you?” He asked quietly.
“Ugh, not a chance. That place needs some serious redecorating. I was thinking something along the coast, or not far from the Malfoy land reserves. We can have a garden and a pool. We can watch the sun set from our balcony, or sleep under the stars on a hammock... “ Draco thought aloud. It was nice to hear his thoughts of their future, and how they might live one day.
Harry moaned constantly, sometimes in pain and others in pleasure. Draco was still trying to catch his breath from the oh-dear-lord-that’s-good feeling.
"Good going mate. I'm with 'Mione on this one. That is not something you want to be doing in court." Ron said, placing a hand on Hermione's shoulder. "And since when has Malfoy become Draco?" Ron asked, looking at Harry with a raised eyebrow.
Harry sighed. “I don't know, but I do know that your scent drives me insane and I can't…” He faded out, really questioning if he should risk it.
“I know you can come like this.” Draco said. Harry nodded frantically, feeling the sensation build up. “Come for me, honey. I love when you do.”
1 month earlier
They stayed like that for a while, just enjoying each other’s presence.
“You won't scare me.” Draco paused for a moment before continuing. “It's just, this whole mess we've been thrown into. I'm so confused and I don't know how to feel about anything. Especially the mates thing because I think it’s you but I don't know how to tell. I need to talk to someone but I don't have anyone to go to. My mother doesn't know anything and she's the only other one that knows about me. Harry I'm so lost I don't know how to deal with all of this.” After his rambling, Harry realised that Draco was having a panic attack. It was written all over his face. His hands were shaking and he looked almost in tears.
“I missed you,” Potter said, running his hand along Draco’s back.
He had a great support system, mainly consisting of Pansy and his mother. But they weren’t someone he could go home to. They weren’t someone he could cuddle up to after a hard day. They weren’t someone that would stroke his ever changing hair and tell him everything would work out. They weren’t someone that would kiss him and hold him and mutter sweet nothings as they made love to him.
He knew he was interested in guys at a younger age, especially around 4th year when Cedric had become a Triwizard champion. There was no other reason as to why Draco chose to support him, other than that he was totally head over heels for the hufflepuff boy. And truth be told, he was heartbroken when he found out that Cedric was in love with the Chang girl.
“His core.” He hears Hermione gasp behind him. “A replica of it.” She amends. “The light blue strands should be thick and glowing. As you can see, they’re quite faint. He’s on magic replenishing supplement, as well as the necessary physical potions he needs to help with the onslaught of the seizure. Mentally and physically, he is stable. Magically, he needs time to recover, but he should also bounce back with that too. He is quite powerful, there is no doubt in that, and with anyone else, the results of this would’ve been far more detrimental. For Mr. Potter here, he survived with far less damage than he should have. He should consider himself lucky.”
Draco shook his head and sighed. “No, that's not necessary. I'll just have some of those potions you use.”
As Harry stepped out onto the aisle for the second time that morning, himself once again presentable and the reddened eyes and cheeks missing, he cleared his mind of all things, the wedding, the people, the blond. All that remained was the will to think of ten things that made him happy. Just ten, and as he made his way toward the altar, his worry and panic subsided greatly.
“Stop joking or you’ll die on me.”
Harry rolled his eyes and replied "Look, I promise I won't freak out again. I got it out of my system." Hermione just raised an eyebrow.
An auror appeared at Harry's side immediately as two escorted the blond out in the opposite direction. Harry noticed he still had a shocked demeanour, probably at Harry's shouting.
“You like him.” Hermione said, putting the water to boil on the stove. Harry went to say something but she stopped him with a hand in the air. “Now, I know what you’re going to say, you’re going to try to deny it, but I know you better than that. Everytime you’ve Floo called me this week was to talk about Draco. Plus, I see the way you look at him. Even at his trial. I know he’s an Omega, Harry, but do you really want to get yourself caught up in all of that?”
Harry sat on the edge of his seat, his Alpha senses coming into play at the newly formed Omega that sat before him. He wanted to reach forward, tuck the piece of hair behind the blonds ear, and stare into those steel grey eyes that he so vividly remembered. He wanted to trace the sculpted features of the blonds face, run his hands through the soft locks that fell effortlessly back, and stare deep into those grey eyes that always took his breath away.
Once in the hospital wing, Hermione and McGonagall stayed in the background, shyly observing the administrations Madame Pomfrey was applying to Malfoy. Snape had arrived too, and was beside the medi-witch, listening to the information McGonagall and Hermione had told her.
“Yeah, ok,” Harry said, totally ignoring Hermione.
“Our bed, you mean.” Malfoy supplied.
“Mal- Malfoy?” Harry called, uncertain if he’d just mind fucked the shit out of his nemesis.
As the trio made their way to where the ceremony was to be held, Harry wondering what really awaited his future from that moment on.
“Why? Is there something you need my help with?” He asked, regarding the papers on the desk behind him.
“Oh come on, Ron. If you can’t stop Seamus from casting, maybe I should take yours away as well.” She threatened. He backed off.
Harry was aware he would have marks all along his neck from Malfoy’s ministrations, but he could care less. At this point, the whole school knew what had happened and were aware of Malfoy’s feelings for Harry. When people saw them two, they would stare and whisper to their friends, but Harry made a point not to pay attention to their frivolous gossiping.
“More than a crush?” Harry inquired.
“Oh my God Malfoy, shut up.” Harry whispered angrily.
“Oh, because the ‘Great Harry Potter’ is just so widely praised upon, that any request he makes be fulfilled with nothing but the best there is to offer? What, you would demand Kingsley give me his job or you would refuse to be his gofer, running around, filling out forms and signing off agreements? Because that’s such a hard job, right? Oh no, Potter is one step below the Minister! Why don’t we just make him one then! Why don’t we just appoint Potter as the new Minister-”
Draco Malfoy, of course, did not look nor act like the poncy git Harry and his friends knew from Hogwarts. He was quiet, still, and more beautiful than any other creature Harry had ever seen. Draco would look quite peaceful to those around him but Harry could smell something very close to fear radiating off his small body.
“Oh no, it’s only to be taken when you know you two will be away from each other, or when you feel any pain coming on. It can be taken at your own discretion.” she replied. Harry nodded in agreeance.
Draco swallowed, cleared his throat, and addressed the room to introduce himself; his hottish demeanor and Malfoyish manner radiating from him, just as his father once taught him.
"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean too. I just went to check on you, and you weren't in your room. Are you alright?" He asked, stepping further into the room.
“...Bond with me.”
When he moved back to the bed, he folded the comforter down to their feet and covered himself with the thin sheet instead. He closed his eyes and focused on sleep, when he felt a pair of strong, muscular arms snake around his bare waist. A pair of lips found their way onto his neck and started kissing him gingerly. He immediately leaned back into his boyfriend's embrace when a sinus-squeezing sneeze escaped him.
“Can we talk?”
“C’mon, Malfoy.” Harry sighed.
“Draco.” Harry tried again, stepping a little closer to the blond.
They leave through the Floo network, appearing in 12 Grimmauld Places’ sitting room. Harry takes Draco’s things and drops their stuff onto a nearby chair.
“Well, can I stay here till he gets back?” Draco asked not unkindly.
He sighed and walked over to the poetry section. He pulled off a few random books and put them on the table in the middle of the chairs. After a moment's hesitation, he moved over to the wizarding section and found some books on magical creatures. He didn’t know much about his inheritance, just that it came from his mother’s side. Her family had a long line of Omega genes, but the effect of the traits had decreased over the years, making the inheritance skip multiple generations. Draco was the first Omega to manifest in over 7 generations.
It takes him a moment.
“Infatuation. Mmm, I like that,” came the oh so familiar drawl.
“I’ll take your wand away again, Seamus. Don’t think I won’t!”
“Uhm, yup! Got them in here!” Harry called from the bedroom.
Ok so this chapter was super short, I'm sorry. I thought this was the best way to end the fic as it's already super long. I don't really want to write anymore but if there is anything else you would like me to add, I will consider making a part two of sorts.
Draco looks down at him, a smirk forming on his features. “And what, pray tell, would you do if I don’t?” He says hotly, climbing back over Harry and pressing himself into the others’ body.
Ron was still shocked from the polite Draco Malfoy he just witnessed, and the fact that him and his best mate were going to become roommates. Hermione quickly spoke up for both of them, seeing as Ron was incapable at the moment. "Oh no, Harry. We'll be off back to the Burrow. Floo call or owl us when you get the chance." And with that, she grabbed Ron's arm and dragged him away.
They sat in the sitting room for the majority of the day, because the sky had clouded over and rain began to fall. They read, completed puzzles, and played chess. Harry tried to make out with Draco multiple times, who just kept pushing him away.
Late in the evening, one would consider it nighttime, Harry came padding down the rickety stairs and into the kitchen. Draco could hear him from the nearby sitting room, where he was busying himself with a book. He followed his husband into the kitchen to see how he was doing. After giving Harry space for the majority of the day, Draco thought it safe to see how he was feeling.
Draco finished, waking up beside Harry to kiss his head before leaving, but Harry turned and grabbed him, kissing him fully and deeply, one would almost call it making out. Draco would have climbed into his lap and stayed there if it wasn’t for the fact they were at work, and he really should go back.
Another chapter! I'm loving this fic already :)
“No, I didn’t knot you either. A knot develops when an Alpha intends to bite, to claim their mate.”
Everyone that knew Draco knew he was gay. Those that he’d gone to school with had all found out by their eighth year, when he decided that after the war it was safe to come out. He’d started figuring out relationships with other boys and how he felt towards them. Of course, then surfaced the long-time admiration he had for the Boy Who Lived, which he’d spent most of his life burying under the anxiety of his world and desperation for survival during the war.
“Me?” Draco questioned.
“Harry told me that you needed someone to talk to.” She said sincerely.
Draco looked at the hand, then up at Harry, and then back to the hand. He didn’t forget about the previous night’s activities, he just wasn’t expecting Harry to all of a sudden be waking him up with tender touches. It felt so normal, so loving that Draco’s heart couldn’t handle it.
When Harry was done, Draco nodded gently and left him as he went inside. He saw his breakfast still there, but when he went to cast a quick warming charm, he saw small streams of steam rising from it. He was sure it wouldn’t have stayed steaming with warmth for that long, no matter how hot the climate was. He cast a quick diagnostic charm and saw that a stasis was put on it.
“Looking for another player?” The man eventually asked, a deep accent coming from him. American? Draco wondered. Regardless, there was only one person he would’ve wanted to add to his game, and it wasn’t this man.
He retreated to his study like always, and began to prepare for his interview with The Daily Prophet. Draco had reminded him that he’d have to leave his world of comfort that he’d built inside the walls of 12 Grimmauld Place, after not having left in more than a week, to explain to the press and the whole Wizarding World that he was doing fine and not much has changed since he’d left Hogwarts.
Harry giggled. “Like your hair.”
Draco swallowed dry. Oh Merlin. He didn’t know Potter was gay, let alone out. The sheer confidence the once poor, lanky boy he’d known, had blossomed when he’d grown into the man he clearly was now. He was surprised by this, to say the least, but he reserved his features. He would hyperventilate later in the storage room. For now, he thought he’d interest Potter in a hair cut.
“Well hello there, handsome.” Harry smiled at him. “Sleep well?” He asked, his smile spreading to a grin.
Well now Draco was just confused. “So, the prophecy was causing you pain, which made you mad, so you took it out on me. But you were just saying those things because you were mad and not because you actually felt them.”
“I said ‘I’m fine.’ I don't need you babying me. I can take care of myself. Anyways, nothing's wrong and I'm not sick.” He said, huffing and crossing his arms.
Draco stayed silent for a moment before quietly replying “I would like that too. But, before, were you implying that I'm your mate? Or might be?”
“Well, I assumed that, based on what I read about this particular prophecy, it says that because of a conversation they partook in, at a vulnerable point in their day, the prophecy had punished them as a warning for such behaviour.” Hermione explained briefly.
The first one. Followed by another and another. Soon, hands were shooting up all over the place. Harry's brain again screamed 'that's a lot of hands!' in a much more excited manner. He couldn't tell if it was more than before, but it had to be close, it had to be.
“Ok.”
The man nodded. “Yeah, my sister got her hair done there, it looks great. She was raving about how awesome her experience was.” The man said.
Professor Snape stood tall and crossed his arms, turning his nose high into the air. “Did you not?”
He pulled them off the shelves and put them beside his poetry books. He knew that his main purpose was to mate with an Alpha to pass on the genes, but none have presented themselves to him.
Harry pushed his hair out of his face and thumbed away a few more tears that slid down the blond's face. “Ok, honey. Do you want me to get you some potions? I can take you to St. Mungos if you want.”
“Oh, just some homemade brownies. They’re my favourite.” Draco said. He looked up at Harry who was smiling at him in a dazed kind of way. “I hope that’s alright. I know I should’ve asked.”
Draco finally lifted his head and stared at Harry as he made his speech, mouth gaping slightly at the words that exited from the raven-haired boy's mouth.
“You look good mate. Got a nice tan going on.” Ron chuckled.
Harry smirked and shrugged. “Alright, but I'm still getting it for you. And you're going to wear it.”
Draco nodded again.
“Don’t play the sympathy card, now, Draco. Of course I want to be with you, you’re my everything... but I need some time for myself, too. And yeah, we have been cooped up in this house for too long. We need to get out more, Draco. We need more socialization.” Harry tried walking over to Draco and put his arms around him, but was promptly shoved away.
“Only if you want to,” Harry replies. “If it’s too much, we can—”
“Draco,” she said, soft against the roar of the rain. “Things are going to be fine. It’s rain. It’s not the end of the world.”
Ron’s face goes an exciting hue of red and Malfoy’s ears go pink and his grin is blinding. Malfoy throws up a quick Shield Charm to deflect the jink Ron fires off at him. Harry’s starting to realise that the Malfoy who goes pink and happy is Harry’s favourite version of Draco. But then his face becomes more serious.
Bellatrix nodded, a crazed look in her eyes. “Yes, of course. All the money in the world.”
Predictably, it had no answer. Deciding to move on, he walked upstairs to clean his teeth and change into his pyjamas. It was still on the early side, but Harry had eaten, he wasn’t planning on having company, and reading in bed was becoming an appealing option to ending his day.
Harry grabs a glass and fills it with water, taking a long drink.
“It’s more than OK, Harry.”
Draco's barely finished his sentence before Harry's impaling himself and groaning at the stretch. His earlier observation was correct: Draco is
“Where is the man in black?” she demanded.
“A little after eight.” Draco peers at Harry. “You need to do something to your hair before we go into work. And I should Floo home for different clothes. Don’t want to start up the rumour mill.”
Draco nodded and he and Harry got under the top sheet and duvet. Since he was covered, he sent his clothes off again, but left his wand close so he could bring them back if needed.
Ron nodded and walked to the house that was surrounded by three brutes. He waved them off. “I’ll take care of it,” he muttered. Then, to his surprise, the person causing so much trouble was
“This has more action than
“You’re drooling, mate,” he says, nodding at Malfoy.
“My house, innit?”
“I have money.”
“What are they planning on doing with the building?” Draco asked.
“Thanks, Hermione,” Draco said as he and Harry still looked at each other.
“You’re the
Malfoy seems to perk up at that. “I do seem to have squashed the ‘evil mastermind’ trait,” he says.
“Oh my god,” Harry said with a laugh. “Are you fourteen?”
Hermione drew her wand so fast Ron goggled a bit. “You’re faster than I remember,” he whispered. Then, even more quietly, “Also you’re really pretty.”

“Fuck,” Harry whispers and moves so he’s straddling Draco.
The man in black nodded his head. “So you’re ready to make your choice?” he asked in a soft voice, only made softer by the contrast of Zacharias’ rant.
Hermione’s eyes twinkled. “You’re really rather clever, Ronald,” she said with a big smile.
, who is he to argue? He tamps back his embarrassment for as long as he’s able before he says, “Are you going to do anything or just stare all night?”
Draco frowned and flicked his wand at another bottle of lotion, sending it to the shelf on the wall, comfortable in his Conjured wingback.
“Oh, fuck you very much,” Potter replied. “Should have known you wouldn't have changed
Harry shakes his head gravely with a false frown. “Peanut Butter Tater Tot Potter is far too intelligent to try and sneak by the guards at Gringotts.” Lily smiles at that, making Harry smile back in return. “We’ll find him,” he says gently. “He’s got his tag on.”
“I thought you weren’t going to do any work,” Harry says on a gasp.
gorgeous when you look like that, Potter.”
Harry starts thrusting, little, tentative thrusts, until Draco’s fully hard from the movement.
With a sigh Emily leaned over and rested her head on Draco’s shoulder. “I know,” she whispered. “I know.”
Hermione was pulled up and tossed to and fro with her wand in front of her, almost as if she was being pulled by the strings of an invisible marionettist. Her wand bumped tree to tree to tree until all of the strength left her body and she collapsed against a gnarled tree, her wand tapping a knot, and the opening to the Chamber of Secrets was revealed.
first time, but it is
“Draco!”
“I’m sorry for your loss,” Harry whispered back.
“It looks nice with the sofa.”
Voldie let out a groan as Draco spelled his bonds tighter. Suddenly, Hermione walked in the door, bloody, but happy. “Where’s Ron?” she asked as she looked around the room and saw the prince tied up and Harry on his feet.
“How about a battle of wits?” the man in black asked. “Surely if you’re that intelligent, you will beat me. Easily.”
to get him a pest as a pet.
,” he said seriously. “This was what, about three years ago?”
“Nah,” Draco admitted. “You don’t really do it for me.”
“Wonderful,” Mary said. “Make yourselves comfortable and I’ll be back in a few minutes to take your drink order.”
Harry’s mouth is warm and slightly spicy from their curry, but so familiar, even after such a short time.
“I want
His hair is still a little damp and is curling like it’s on purpose instead of haphazard. His shirt is tighter than he is completely comfortable with, but Ron was right, the colour is really flattering against his skin. Since the shirt is on the tighter side, Harry doesn’t feel comfortable in skinny jeans, so he’s put on his favourite pair of dark, straight-legged jeans. He looks down at his black boots and decides the leather jacket Sirius left him would go nicely and keep the chill off in the early June night.
Harry’s silence doesn’t last long. Seconds later he asks, “Are we going to fuck in the lounge?”
Draco snorted. “She reminds me of Pans.”
Draco sputtered at her. “I spent
Harry snorts. He
“I think he’s getting sleepy,” she says. “He finished his orange and he’s had a big day.”
“Are you drunk?” Ginny asked with a sly smile.
Draco smirked back at him and grabbed his wand. “We can do that,” he said and cast, making Harry’s clothes disappear.
Potter laughed at that. “Hooker’s Hamlet,” he said with a wry grin. “What a name.”
“What do you want me to do?” Ron asked.
“You said you thought
was dating Ginny,” Potter said.
Stella walked up with Draco’s toast and a milkshake for Emily. It had two straws.
“You’re looking at me oddly,” Harry said. “Are you going to axe murder me now that the store is open? Take my money and run it by yourself?”
“I should have known it would take Harry Potter to make me say yes.” Draco smiled at Harry and said, “You always got me to do things I didn’t want to do.”
“Can we—” Harry starts but Draco cuts him off when he licks into Harry’s mouth. “Mmmmmrp—” Harry finishes.
“I am actually here for a reason,” he says to Ron and possibly the back of Harry’s head.
“I know,” Harry said. “I’ve known for a long time. I also know you scarred after I cursed you.”
, Emily and I are not
“Yes, Professor,” he answered quietly, feeling like he was risking detention with Filch again. There was something about being back in the Headmistress’ office that made him feel like he was fourteen again. Fourteen and plotting against Potter.
“You could have warned me!” Draco insisted.
“Why are you like this?” he asks and Ron just smiles.
“Anything?” Harry answered. “As much as you’re willing to tell me.”
“He’s good at his job! Like
Draco pulled off and curled his finger, smiling as he looked up and got to see Harry’s face tighten in pleasure.
Draco let out a small shriek as thunder cracked behind him.
“Every time I think that chapter of my life is over, something like this happens.” Draco’s voice is manic and rough. “I know I didn’t make the right decision, Salazar, I
Emily’s face went strange. “Ah, your previous life,” she said in a strangled voice. “I haven’t heard anything about that.” Then, losing the battle, she broke out into giggles.
“I’m sure it does,” Harry says in a soothing voice. He rolls over to grab his wand and casts a Warming Charm on Draco’s leg and it starts to feel better almost immediately. Then he curls up behind Draco, his hard cock poking Draco in the back.
Draco sighed,
, blah blah blah, and we realise that maybe,
“I was only going to point out how much he’s changed,” Hermione replied lightly.
noble cause. He clearly said ‘to blave’ which means to bluff. What, were you playing cards and he bluffed? Which makes me right!” she cried. “He
“It’s all true!” Draco insisted.
“Hold what?”
Harry lets out a sigh, petulant to even his own ears. “Fine. Then I’ll use Rose. No one can resist me when I’m being cute with her.”
“Charming.” Draco says, making a face and handing her the glass back. “You keep it.”
“They wanted to help,” Harry explained. “We all have charmed coins if we need to get in touch with the others. Hermione did the charmwork. Fred, George, Bill, and Percy are on restocking duty. Charlie and Arthur are keeping up with the wine. Ron and Molly have food duty and Gin is crowd control.”
“Sure, Dad,” Scorpius agreed easily. But he had a glint in his eyes that Draco recognised and it did not bode well.
“Yes?”
She scowled. “What business is it of yours?”
“There’s a line,” he hissed. “A line of Stella’s family.” He walked to the shop counter and gave Harry his coffee. “One of them cursed at me.”
“You know it does, you tosser,” Draco growls back, starting a lazy roll of his hips.
“The bit about crusty jugglers,” she said, giggling.
Harry lets out a sigh, and Draco watches appreciatively as he gets out of bed and pads towards the door.
“A man of leisure,” Draco drawled.
Draco smiled and excused himself. Harry was left in the hall.
“Er.”
Emily laughed at him. “He got lost,” she explained to Stella. “He was in his own sodding building and he got
Harry moves so he’s half on top of Draco, his leg slung over Draco’s hips and his upper body against Draco’s. “I want to kiss you as I undress you,” he says in lieu of answering.
Zacharias waited until the man in black raised his own goblet before nodding. “At the same time,” he demanded. The man in black lifted his goblet up in a mock toast. Draco watched as they both hesitated then drank their wine.
Draco nodded and watched as Harry held out his hand.
Draco smiles, a little wryly. “Drinks with Pansy and Blaise,” he answers. “And tomorrow, dinner with my mother.”
, slogan: "The weather’ll
Scorpius looked a little alarmed at the idea of someone putting non-food stuff in their mouth and Draco realised that he really did need to socialise with more families who had children of all ages.
“Emily invited us to dinner at her flat,” Draco’s mother said. “She said to tell you that it was takeaway, not her cooking.”
“Thank you for inviting us over,” Draco said, obviously wanting to move away from talking about his deceased wife.
“I like trying new things with you,” he said quietly.
Harry moves so he’s slotted in-between Draco’s legs and Draco’s hips shift at the new spots of contact. They’re both well on their way to being hard and Draco can’t keep his hips still, shifting and arching under Harry, rubbing their pricks together.
There’s a little broom, a Nimbus 2001, Harry thinks, that’s flying in circles around Draco’s collarbone. Harry reaches out to touch it and it speeds away. Harry didn’t think tattoos could emote, but the broom somehow flew away in a huff.
“And not look me in the eye,” Draco drawls back. “Don’t think I haven’t noticed your inability to speak to me like a regular person. Why are you different today?”
Tripping a little, Harry lets himself fall back onto the bed. He tries his best seductive look up at Draco.
Draco sneered, reminding Harry of their Hogwarts day. “You bought those in a five pack at M&S. I’ll buy you a new set if you’re really that enamoured of them.”
doing here?”
“Oi!” Ron objects. “Why is Harry
“No!” Harry half shouts. “I want to take you out on a date!”
“You prat,” Harry says fondly. “You know all Astoria wanted was for you and Scorp to be happy. She practically had ‘someone please date Draco Malfoy and bugger him senseless’ engraved on her headstone.”
“Weather-Be’s,” Draco reminded him with a groan.
Draco’s still engrossed in the movie and eats his chicken tikka masala like he’s starving.
been harbouring the thought of a store that sold Muggle goods to wizards, witches, and wix. However, there were several problems with the idea.
“Were you raised by wolves?” Draco asks, incredulous.
“That can be arranged.”
“I know who you must be,” Draco said in a cold voice. “There is only one man who is as horrible as you; you’re the Dread Pirate Black.”
“I don’t know, do I?” James shouts back.
“I’m glad you’re happy again,” Scorpius says, almost too softly for Draco to hear.
“They’re cursed to go off if someone under the age of seventeen touches them,” Draco says in a sad voice.
to write this?” Then he felt smug for knowing that there were people who wrote movies.
“Fine,” Harry says, a little petulant, but he starts to push two fingers into Draco.
? How
“And how many events has Weather-Be’s been a part of since my wedding?”
“Pfft,” scoffed Ginny. “I’ll just ask him.
“I’m not sharing this with you,” Emily said at Draco’s look. “You just get better suction with two straws.”
“I have a stack of papers with your name on it,” she said, making herself comfortable in the booth.
“Gross!” Emily shrieked, hitting him on the leg. “I don’t want to know about your lack of a sex life!”
Harry nodded and kissed the tip of Draco’s nose before pulling back to walk around the little clearing. “Yes, she's a Metamorphmagus who had taken over for her friend Lupin, the second
“Harry,” Draco whispers insistently.
offer of more Firewhiskey. Then Molly had offered Draco a glass of wine, and combined with the fact that his mother had French serving sizes at brunch and he’d been too nervous to eat more once they'd reached the Burrow, Draco was probably drunk.
“Do tell.”

Harry moved his face back into Draco’s neck and Draco could feel the heat from his blush.
“What if it’s owned by
“Do you promise not to hurt him?” Draco shouted at the prince.
“This is not nothing,” Draco said looking at the receipt, feeling his eyes well with tears. “This is incredible, Harry.” He looked across the table at Harry. He had that same soft, fond look on his face that Draco was so unused to.
He pushes up his sleeve exposing the Dark Mark that’s on his arm. Then he lifts his leg and shows Draco a scar on his left ankle.
“Are you going to order spaghetti and meatballs?” Draco asks in a low voice.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Not my name,” she groused.
“Oh, precious Potter doesn’t like tattoos?” Malfoy taunts, still pink at the tips of his ears and the apples of his cheeks.
Then a small woman with long, pale hair came out, shouting, “Liar!” She looked at Ginny. “Liar!” she shouted again.
Draco smirks. “Shall we?” he asks, gesturing to the bed.
Draco clears his throat and looks pointedly away from Harry. “Where is this leading, Harry?” he asks quietly. “Are we working on being
Draco got through all three bookings on Saturday without a hitch. He treated himself to a double gin and tonic in celebration and went to bed happily.
Walking into his closet, Harry pulls out some black skinny jeans and a dark green Henley for inspection. The trousers are tight but according to Luna make his bum look nice and the shirt is comfortable and soft. Between the two, he shouldn’t feel too uncomfortable. He quickly dresses and grabs his cleanest trainers and walks to the Floo. Casting a quick
“How old were the people who worked at the shops?” Draco asks.
“Oh,” Harry said. “I’ll have the same thing to eat.”
“I love you, too,” Harry says back.
Draco stormed out of the lobby of the inn, flinching at the brightness of the sun. He stalked to the café and frowned at Stella when she waved and chirped her greetings.
“What about—”
Harry could only shrug. He was far too invested in the answer to form words.
Harry feels his own face heat at his outburst. “I— I mean,” he stammers. “I just, our kids get along.
tea. From the city.”
"Careful," Malfoy warns. "You'll give yourself a concussion." Then he leaves Harry to his misery.
“You were such a brat,” Harry agrees.
“Have we reached the pet name portion of the evening?” Harry asks with a smile.
. There’s no coming back from that." He let out a sigh.
Seamus looks at Alicia and asks her, “Do you want to give them the coordinates or head over to the scene?”
Then suddenly, the laughter was cut short as Zacharias let out a moan and fell over, dead. Draco looked at the man in black in horror. “He swapped the goblets,” he whispered.
Draco pulled himself back. “I’m sorry. Is this not welcome?”
“I’m writing your mother,” Draco warns with a calculating look on his face.
he gets to the top,” Zacharias ordered as he scrambled back to Draco and Ron, “finish him off. He has seen us with the prince and therefore must die. Nothing can spoil our plans of starting a war between Wiltshire and Surrey.”
Draco mutters “

“It’s
As if summoned by her name, Luna Apparated into the edge of the orchard where Harry and Ginny were talking.
Hermione thought for a moment. “Let me explain,” she started. Then she frowned. “No, there is too much. Let me sum up. Your True Love, Draco, is to wed Voldie in half an hour. We need your help to break in, stop the wedding, grab Draco, and escape. After I kill Countess Bellatrix.”
“He’s been mostly dead all day,” Hermione explained. “He’s got no strength.”
Suddenly the fear that he will overeat and his little tummy will make an appearance in his slim-fitting shirt is gone. Harry’s not sure if he’ll ever be able to eat again. Somehow, during all of the fieldwork and the dinner at Ron and Hermione’s, Harry has forgotten how incredibly
Clearing his throat and trying to will down his blush, Draco turned back to look at Harry. “Good,” he said. “Because we still have a lot of work to do.”
“Thanks, Mum.” Draco smiled at his mother. She really did mean well, even if she was a bit self-centred.
Between kisses, Harry insists, “Tell me if it’s too much.”
“There’s no room in your bed. I’ll have to walk home and you know that never ends well.”
They made their way as quickly as possible to the castle, but by the time they reached the entrance, they were both drenched.
Harry laughed again and Draco felt something that had been so broken in his heart start to heal.
“We comped the wine,” he says, apologetic.
Potter, silent, watched them with a suppressed smile on his face.
The man in black let out a groan. “That does put a damper on our relationship.”
“You can’t just say things like that!” he hisses.
“Fine,” Ron replied, annoyed. “
Potter looked at Draco again with his too-bright green eyes. “I’ll send the paperwork to my solicitor tomorrow,” he said. “She can expedite the process so we should be able to open in a fortnight.”
“Come back to bed, Harry,” Draco says in a rough voice. “It’s the middle of the night.”
“Minnie,” Harry says,
Then Harry falls, arms flailing and knees crashing into the hard tile floor.
years? Have you spent your entire life looking for me and now you’ve failed?” Bellatrix let out a sinister little giggle. “That’s the most magnificent thing I’ve ever heard. You must tell me all about how you feel, having wasted your life and disappointed your father.”
They finally figure out their angles as Harry continues the steady roll of his hips and Draco reaches around to grab Harry’s arse.
Suddenly there was a crash behind Draco and he heard Ron mutter, “Aw, Hugo, no,” and the moment between Hermione, Harry, and him was broken.
“Actually,” Emily said with a chagrined look.
“And you smell weird—” Lily starts.
“Hey,” Harry said, gently. “The store is ready for our opening. We have some time. Why don’t you show me around the Hamlet.”
“I think it’s just a muscle cramp, love,” Harry says in a gentle voice.
“Do you have your bag?” he asked, slightly sceptical that anything in there would be of interest to Rose Weasley.
“Impatient?” he asks with a smile.
Draco’s parents had passed, years before, leaving him little wealth and a tarnished name, and Harry was poor and unlanded so they—
The man, who was clad in all black clothing as well as a black domino mask, grunted. “This isn’t as easy as it looks,” he grumbled.
“Hello,” Hermione whispered. “My name is Hermione Granger. You killed my father. Prepare to die.”
“I hate you,” Draco says from the floor.
did Harry let that comparison get away from him.
“I ordered your usual.”
Harry pushes in, slow but deliberate, and
infinitely
“See if you get any this holiday,” Harry says with absolutely no bite. He’s having trouble keeping back his laugh at the look of dismay on Draco’s face.
Harry nodded. “Weird, yes, but I want to see where it goes if you do.”
“Not my name,” she grumbled without thinking. Then, realizing there was only one person who called her that, she spun around. “Ron!” she shouted. “What’s the plan?”
Harry shakes his head. “That’s what I expected,” he explains. “I thought you would be a good dad. And I knew you were a good son.”
“I’m impressed,” Draco admitted after he and Harry had sat down in their chairs. “This is a lot nicer than I expected.”
“No, Draco,” Potter said quietly, “I don’t think that. You deserve to have a place to live and food to eat and to have nice things.”
But Draco lets himself take the compliment and smiles.
Harry starts to nibble at Draco’s collarbone and Draco redoubles his efforts, stroking Harry until the very tip of his finger has breached Harry’s entrance. His finger is dry except for the water from the shower, so he won’t be able to finger Harry properly, but he’s doing amazing things with his finger to the bundle of nerves that surrounds Harry’s arsehole.
Draco nodded and they walked into the flat properly and shut the door.
“I think you like him,” she said, poking Draco in the thigh. “And I think he likes you.”
Harry rolls his eyes. “I might be able to,” he admits. “But my secret weapon will be there at least.”
“It’s embarrassing when you just stare at it,” Draco grumbles.
Letting out a sigh, Draco walked to Scorpius and took in his dripping hair and the frown he was failing at hiding. Draco waved his wand and dried the boy off, then sat down and pulled him into a hug.
Draco had been kidnapped by no less than four people, all in the space of twenty-for hours. He was rather sick of it.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Draco asked, indignant. “I’m
Hermione shook her head. “Normally I would say we could do it alone. We’re both really good at what we do. But thirty men is just too many. We need a third person. We
“You’re such a brat,” Harry says and pulls Draco so their fronts are touching and kisses him under the fall of the water. He nips at Draco’s lower lip and swallows his groan as Draco reaches around to grab Harry’s arse and
He follows Draco to his room in silence and averts his eyes when Draco shrugs out of his dressing gown. Draco’s left standing in his pants, tight black cotton, with a defiant look on his face. There’s no possible way either of them are getting hard, but Harry drinks in Draco’s appearance like it’s his very own vial of liquid luck. His eyes stutter to a stop at the pale pink nipples, pebbling in the cool air and a flash of black swoops around his chest, too fast for Harry to recognise.
and then you just
Draco suddenly didn’t care about the most muscular Weasley, or the fact that his best friend was apparently dating Harry’s ex-wife, or that he was in a room full of gingers and his son. He wanted to kiss Harry too badly. He pulled Harry back into his corner until Draco was flush against the wall and wound his arms around Harry’s middle, nipping at his lower lip. Draco kissed Harry once, twice, three times, before licking at the seam of his mouth, trying to get in.
Draco steps into Harry’s space and pulls him flush against his chest. He gently runs his nails up Harry’s back and Harry can’t keep back his groan.
“I’m paying for dinner now.” Harry lets his shoulders slump. “I’m sorry, we—”
Draco, for his part, has no objections.
“Are you going to be our new daddy?” Lily asks, her face the very picture of innocence.
“Anytime,” Ron said with a grin. “Where are you going to take him?”
Biting his lip, Harry thought about what his best friends were saying. “I still don’t want to be set-up.”
“Harry, you got me a
“It’s creepy when you both look at me with the same expression on your face,” Harry complains.
And Draco’s eyes tingle at Harry’s intuition.
Nodding, Scorpius whispers, “And quiet.”
“I’m sorry, are you singing a Spice Girls song?” Harry asks, startling Draco.
Draco has some knick-knacks on the built-in shelving— mostly little bits and bobs that have caught his attention over the years.  He grabs the inactive Snitch, the miniature bronze statues he accumulated on his honeymoon with Astoria in Italy, the drawings that Scorpius has done over the years that Draco had framed. And then, just to be overly cautious, the building block set Draco purchased in Muggle London.  ‘Ledos’ he thinks they’re called. It had taken several hours to build the small Eiffel Tower, and while it's a matte grey, he and Scorpius bought it during Scorpius’ first trip to the continent, and he didn’t want it destroyed.
“Arse,” Draco muttered.
, and Harry decides to just go with it.

of heights, but between the constant jostling and the sheer size of the cliff, he didn’t want to make himself sick.
“I was pissed.”
“It’s one of the few things we still have that belongs to us.” Draco could see Potter bite his lip. “I know you think it’s what we deserve, and you’re not wrong but…” He let out a huff of air.
Throwing his hands up in the air and letting out a grunt of frustration, Draco looked at the drenched wedding guests and the bride-to-be. She was glaring at her son. Or Draco. Maybe both. No matter what, she wasn't happy.
“I was in France,” Draco said. “And Italy, and Spain, and for a brief, glorious fortnight, Ibiza. Since then, I’ve been stuck here in the middle of nowhere and we
“I don’t think so.”
Fuckdammit Harry Potter was fucking HUNG. If it wasn’t currently spearing Draco open and in half, he’d be screaming expletives at the man above him for daring to have such a big dick.
The Minister of Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt, sat high in his chair, towering over the jury and audience in the courtroom, which consisted of the Wizengamont and a single raven-haired saviour. Harry's best friends, Ron and Hermione, waited outside the courtroom, seeing as this was one of the many private trials that took place. "Well, my dear colleagues and friends, we come to a close for the day with the trial for one 'Draconius Lucius Malfoy'." As Kingsley read off the blonds crimes, Harry watched as he didn't visibly tremble or shake, but sat there silently, accepting whatever fate was coming his way.
After blowing his nose multiple times, the stuffiness remaining, and his pounding headache increasing tenfold, he felt a little like crying.
Harry pulled back and when Draco tried to kiss him again, he just turned his head away. Draco settled for attacking his neck instead.
She whipped a pillow at him.
Draco could admit that he was overreacting. They both knew keeping their relationship to themselves was the better choice rather than telling everyone about it. Their close friends knew, as well as the Minister of Magic, as per Harry’s request because he had to know how they were doing, living with each other and all.
“Come without touching yourself, baby. I know you can.”
“How about we play one game?” He offered, clearly not getting Draco’s message to fuck off.
Her facial expression remained the same and, realizing she didn’t need anything more from him, he turned back to Harry. The bruise was still gone, and Harry lay there, sleeping peacefully. His heart squeezed painfully, remembering how he passed out at their wedding. This view was scarily similar to that one. He really hoped that Harry was healthy, that there wasn’t something more deep going on within him, and this was just something they could overcome together.
Harry and Draco nodded. It was so much to take in and process. Draco grabbed Harry's hand unseeingly, chewing on his lip.
“Thank you, Pansy. And of course I was going to tell you eventually. I just wanted to discuss things with Harry before I told anyone about us. I don’t even know what we are.”
“I believe so, sir. I would like to know what it means.”
Harry vanished his underwear (not keen on doing that with the rest of his clothes before; he liked his wardrobe, thank you very much. He wasn’t about to waste his clothes, although, one pair of pants couldn’t hurt). Before he could do anything more though, a hand pressed into his chest to stop him.
Draco had fallen asleep in one of the extra bedrooms that night, hiding away from Harry. He was sad and hurting. Harry didn’t love him, and that hurt more than any pain a prophecy could inflict.
Harry gave her an exasperated look. “Am I ready? Are you serious? Of course I’m not ready! I don’t want to be here. This is the last thing I’d ever want, Hermione. I thought you’d know this!”
"Guilty?" The Minister asked the members that sat behind him. Harry didn't have time to count as his eyes frantically flitted across the hands that started to raise. He felt a twisting in his chest as his brain started worrying 'that's a lot of hands...' An auror stepped forward and could be seen quickly counting the raised hands. He did this twice and quietly told Kingsley the number. Kingsley then scribbled on a piece of parchment before speaking the words "And not guilty?"
“I’ve missed you, mate, so much.” Ron said, emotion dripping from his words.
Draco just held his gaze on their connected hands and willed himself not to shudder against the contact. Harry felt so powerful, so big and tough in Draco's tiny grasp. Eventually the silence carried on for a long time before I broke Draco's gaze and he asked "Why don't you use it?" He asked quietly, still not able to look in Harry's eyes.
“Oh fuck, Harry. You’re too big.” Draco cried, trying to pull enough air into his lungs to breathe.
"Harry? Harry!" Hermione snapped her fingers, quickly bringing Harry's attention back to her. "This is serious. He must have just recently manifested, otherwise we would've been aware of this a few weeks ago." She said, more to herself than her boys as she started pacing the narrow hall they were waiting in. She turned and faced them both with wide eyes, "He could get hurt. Newly formed Omegas can be very sensitive and fragile at first. Harry, you really have to restrain yourself from him if you go back in there."
To feel the water
“Yeah, it’s very Slytherin like, with a hint of gay to it.” Potter laughed, somewhat nervously.
“Are you feeling alright?” A tinge of guilt and worry threaded through Harry’s voice.
“Well, I-” Harry began, but was interrupted by Ron.
Harry sighed. He felt really bad for him. He released the incarcerous and immediately Malfoy’s arms were thrown around his neck. He was not expecting to get a lap of Malfoy right before his shower, especially when he was naked under his robe.
“You really are something else.” Harry chuckled.
“Yes! Yes baby!” He moaned again and again, clearly liking what Draco was doing. Draco thrust right there again and again until moments later Harry was trembling and cumming all over his and Draco’s chests. The heat, pressure, and now sight of Harry had Draco cumming like never before.
Harry didn’t speak or move, just stared deeply into Draco’s eyes. A few minutes passed, silence wrapped around them before Harry said “I did it.”
Blowing through my hair
“Congratulations!” Harry yelled and Ron vanished.
And as if Draco knew exactly what was on Harry’s mind, he finished his thought “Why I kissed you…”
The medi-witch nodded. “Ah, yes. Marigold Pearings.” she introduced herself, extending a hand towards Draco.
This caused Harry to laugh a little harder before being silenced as Draco's icy glare intensified. “I'm sorry love. You're just so cute.” He wrapped his arms back around Draco and buried his face in his neck once more.
A grunt and then the blonds head finally appeared over the blankets. “I normally am, but not when someone’s screaming rings in my ears all night!”
“Oh calm down Harry, that’s just the beginning.” Malfoy said sensually.
“What?” Harry said, shocked that Snape wouldn’t want to take him up on his offer to see the truth.
“Well, if you’d let me get to the point-”
The rest of the reception was fairly decent. Harry chatted with the Weasleys for most of the remainder of the time, who all came out to witness the wedding. He had an enchanting conversation with Charlie about the Dragon Wrangling Camp and some of the new editions. He, of course, talked to Hermione and Ron, as well as Ginny. The three of them strictly avoided anything to do with the new Malfoy-Potter situation, and just freely talked about job opportunities now that they were out of school. Ginny also revealed her early acceptance onto the Quidditch team the ‘Holy Head Harpies’, and that her training would start within the next few weeks. Harry was happy he could celebrate something worth celebrating on this day.
Obviously there were feelings there that they both had, and it would be an insult to all the world’s greatest love stories, songs, poems, and gifts if they denied what they both felt for each other.
He felt something stir beside him and heard a tired and muffled “Draco?”
“Bond with me, Draco.”
They took a seat on the sofa, waiting for their partners to return.
“You fucking tosser.” He scolded angrily.
They were quiet for a few minutes before Harry spoke. “I know you don’t like being vulnerable with your emotions, but I need you to be one hundred percent, completely and utterly honest with me, if we’re going to do this. I have loved meeting the new Draco and falling for him the more I’m with him, but I need him to be completely open with me. Can he do that?”
The next morning, Harry and Draco made their way to St Mungo’s to speak with Healer Walkins about their situation once more. Ron and Hermione needed to visit his parents, saying to go without them, and that they’d meet up later to discuss what information the two had acquired.
Harry exhaled shakily. He expected anything he did with Draco from this moment on to be quite unlike anything he’s done before. He knew he wouldn’t be the same afterwards- that nothing would. They were ready. Draco’s enthusiasm just made it all the more exciting.
And waited.
"I can come over tomorrow and chat with him for a bit after work. I think we should give him some time though. Didn't you say he's using the library now? He might be finding something in there.”
Draco looked up at him with a sincere smile, reached up on his tiptoes, gave him a quick kiss, then padded off to the bathroom to change.
"Me neither, but he's got nowhere else to stay, and I've got all of Grimmauld Place to myself. I thought I'd offer, seeing as the Manor is closed up and everything." He replied quickly. Hermione and Ron just continued to stare at him so he turned to the only other person in the hall. "So, umm, Draco, would you like to go? Do you have any clothes or anything?" He asked, suddenly nervous as his hand reached to scratch the back of his neck.
Seeing the look on his face, Draco leaned forward and kissed Harry heartedly on the lips.
So, a few minutes before this.
“Nah, you’re taking me so well.” Harry murmured, picking up the pace.
But before Draco could finish, Harry groaned loudly and rubbed his hands down his face.
They ate in silence for a while before Draco spoke quietly "I couldn't help but notice you call me by my first name."
“Harry, baby, I can’t… need to move.” Draco gasped as Harry squeezed ever so slightly.
“I understand, Professor. I didn’t mean to disrupt you or the class.”
Harry nodded.
Draco threw his head back in laughter. “Yes, yes I would.” Harry beamed at him. “Holy shit, Harry Potter is my boyfriend.”
“Draco!” Harry shouted from a few yards away. Draco realized that he had been pulled out far into the water from the current and Harry was signalling him back to shore. He swam freely to shore, the current not strong enough for him to have to fight it, and returned to his husband.
“Welcome back, Mr Malfoy. How are you feeling?” Madame Pomfrey immediately started fussing over Malfoy.
Harry just wrapped his arms tightly around him and petted his hair slowly, shushing the blond before quietly saying, “I know sweetheart. I know…”
He got a table and ordered a firewhiskey while waiting for his best friend. When Ron came, they greeted with a hug then started chatting about everything: Ron’s training, Harry’s work, Hermione’s apprenticeship, Ron and Hermione’s relationship, and finally Draco.
Harry nodded. They were enjoying breakfast in the Great Hall, while Harry told the events of that morning.
“Because we don’t want you to die! You know what will happen if you refuse to follow through with the prophecy. If marrying Malfoy is the only thing to keep you alive, then so be it! You didn’t deserve this, but you can't die.” Hermione fought back. Ron held her arm back, trying to get her to calm down, and to not role Harry up again, but she needed to get that out, and that seemed to be the only thing that actually got to him.
As he entered the kitchen, it was spotless as it had been before he decided to distract himself with baking earlier. He felt bad for leaving Harry to clean up, but he couldn’t stay there. He had to get out.
I've been working on this chapter for too long, but I'm happy with it. Finally some smut in this story. Any other ideas are very welcome! Share your thoughts with me :)
Harry yelped.
“What does Weasley want?”
He pulled Harry’s cock to the rhythm of his thrusts, albeit uneven due to his mind’s state, although it did the trick. Harry was coming hard after a few good thrusts near the end, right before Draco filled Harry up.
“How do you know the desk is grand or intrinsically engraved?” Harry asked.
Harry pulled back the other way, wanting to get far away from Draco’s nakedness, lest his nakedness make Harry’s naked body react.
Harry grunted but stilled, and Hermione released him.
McGonagall listened carefully, catching all what happened since Madame Pomfrey had already gone.
“I know, that’s why I do it.” Harry giggled. He gasped at the resounding smack that skipped across his bum cheeks.
"What happened? Are you alright?"
Harry and Malfoy ran to the Gryffindor common room.
“Anyways,” She emphasized, fixing her hair. “I can tell. You know how I can tell? You’re smiling like a great big buffoon, and you’re wearing a turtleneck which you haven’t worn since Hogwarts. So you’re either planning on changing your career path to become a gay French fashion designer who never sells his items, only displays them on really fancy fashion runways, or you’re hiding a hickey. I personally think it’s the latter, seeing as you love your job and your fashion, although an expensive taste, is somewhat subpar to what those hands can do when it comes to colour and a curling iron.” When he didn’t say anything, just looked at her with wide eyes, she continued with a smirk. “So, tell me. How’d it happen?”
