?” Harry didn’t understand why Draco was approaching him so slowly. Why didn’t he just yell at him and get it over with? It wasn’t like they were trapped in the same room anymore.
He’d give it back, but not right now. No, his face was still far too red. He’d wait for his blush to go away first.
A sudden commotion filled the hallway with noise as all of the eighth years exited the Room of Requirement, ready to head back to their common room. Draco normally would have pulled way, but he was far too drunk and horny to be embarrassed—plus, Harry was latched onto his throat in a way that made him never want it to end.
"Not the higher-market ones," he shrugged, "they use rarer ingredients that don't cause dependence."
Harry waited until Draco was out of the shower to get out of bed the next morning. When he did, he hurried into the bathroom, hoping Draco wouldn’t comment on it.
"I'm going to get ready, I think," Draco pushed his plate away with a sigh. "You finish your lunch, okay?"
“I thought—” he lowered his hand from his face, shaking slightly. “I thought you didn’t want to, that you’d say no.”
“Of course, Harry,” Remus smiled warmly. “Come here, will you?” He opened his arms and gestured Harry forward to give him a hug. “Happy Christmas.”
Malfoy’s mouth snapped shut and he stepped back a step, his hand pressed to his chest. “Oh,” he said in a small voice.
“Hey!” He greeted with a smile, then paused when he took in Draco’s body language. He was sitting on the couch, but his body was stiff—head held high, shoulders tight, foot tapping anxiously. “Are you alright?”
“Lily, of course,” Remus answered, “she bet that it would happen the day we got back from holiday break in our fifth year.”
Their shared flat was only a few minutes walk from their favorite café where they'd go on lazy mornings for a small breakfast. On the mornings when they
“I don’t know, I’ll figure it out!” Draco snatched the single blanket and pillow from the bed, tucking them under his arm. Before Harry could respond, he stalked away to search the cabin in vain for any other blankets or pillows.
Harry opened his eyes, blinking blearily as the angry silhouette beside him shoved at his chest. To Draco’s dismay, Harry responded by pulling him closer, wrapping both arms around his shoulders and tucking his face against Draco’s collarbone before heaving a great sigh. If Draco didn’t know any better, he would’ve thought it sounded quite content.
Malfoy sighed. "I may hate you, but not enough to make you go through this alone." He joined me on the floor, sitting against the opposite wall. "So?" he asked. "Who was your gay awakening?"
Malfoy!" Harry grumbled as he barely managed to stay upright. "You're going to mess up the potion.” He lowered his voice. “What are you
question—another question with only one answer. “You’re actually asking me?” he asked, trying to stifle a laugh.
Harry squeezed his eyes shut, fighting off the Truth Serum as best as he could, but it forced the words up his throat like a hiccup. “Yes,” he said finally, feeling his cheeks redden.
me?” Draco’s voice was surprisingly sultry, and he stood against the doorframe in what could only be described as a
When they entered the eighth-year common room, Pansy and Granger looked ready to cry from frustration at the sight of their joined hands.
“I’m just—just worried about everyone’s safety.” He cleared his throat. “Yours included. Not that I actually give a damn about you,” he added quickly. “I just…don’t wish you ill. Not anymore.”
“For the record, Draco,” Blaise spoke up. "You were way more interested in Potter than you were in the whole Chamber of Secrets fiasco.”
He made a small noise of surprise. “Hello to you, too,” he snorted, wrapping his arms around Harry’s torso.
“Oh,” Harry rubbed the back of his neck. How had he not noticed that Hedwig was the only owl? “You don’t have your own owl?”
“Will you marry me?” Draco’s voice was a near whisper, the lump in his throat preventing him from speaking properly.
Harry rolled his eyes, walking over to a small mirror on the wall to comb his fingers through his hair. “It’s not
Draco,” he dipped his head to kiss Draco’s neck, only to moan when Draco’s hand slipped from his lower back to palm his arse.
Harry eased the window open and swung his leg over the ledge, tossing the broom back onto the ground once he was inside. He was regretting lending his invisibility cloak to Remus at that moment—it
“Hm? What was that?” Harry asked innocently as he continued to trace lazy circles on his hand before darting forward to kiss Draco on the cheek. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Voldemort's hand was trembling, his face set in a firm line. The Elder Wand was pointed at Harry's face as he braced himself to cast the spell.
Harry whipped around in his seat to glare at Draco, the glass in his hand shattering. He stood up suddenly, swiftly vanishing the broken glass with another flick of his wrist. He didn’t have an appetite anymore. Maybe if he retreated to his desk, Draco would stop talking to him.
“No, no, it’s not his fault, because if the ferret had managed to go ten seconds without insulting Harry—”
Once the laughter finally died down, Hermione put her hands on her hips. “Okay, now that that’s settled, I’ve prepared study schedules for everyone—you too, Malfoy—so we can catch up now that quarantine is over.” She procured a stack of parchment from her bag, ignoring Ron’s groan. “I used a different colour coding method this time, so I’d like your feedback once you’ve gone over them….”
"You're always doing so much for me," he answered, "you get me flowers and help me through my panic attacks and always make sure I’m warm at night, and even now you're trying so hard to make me better—and what do I do for you in return? Nothing!"
people got married in the first place. It wasn't until he was twelve years old and he observed the loving relationship between Molly and Arthur Weasley that he started to understand.
Maybe if he took dreamless sleep—it was addictive, but surely Harry would be fine, right? It would just be for the rest of quarantine, and then he could quit. “Sorry,” he mumbled sleepily.
"Of course," Harry leaned forward to kiss Draco's nose. "It's a win-win—not only do I sleep better than I would at the Burrow, but I

to let you read it first, you git!" Harry laughed, shoving his shoulder. "You should go get ready. Good luck, yeah?" He gave Draco another hug, using the opportunity to kiss him on the cheek again. It was quite enjoyable, if he was being honest—it gave him a thrill that made his toes curl.
Harry blinked at Pansy and hesitated, feeling very much like he’d just been asked whether he’d like to die via hanging or a gunshot wound to the head. Choosing
, Ron," I snapped. There it was again. I closed my eyes, basking in the heat of the anger that washed over me. "Sorry," I added, but I knew it wasn't convincing.
The Manor floorboards seemed to be creak-free, and Harry was able to find Draco's room without making a sound. He tapped lightly on the door, hoping he wouldn't have to knock loudly to be heard.
In fact, he hadn't even considered what it would be like to marry Draco Malfoy, even three years into their relationship. Perhaps he was just oblivious to any hints that Draco dropped, or maybe it was because, for so long, he didn't understand
to Diagon Alley to buy one, can I? Not without being mobbed. Owls aren’t offered by mail order, either.”
Potter, did you add Irish moss instead of sea moss?" Draco demanded, angrily wiping the potion out of his eyes.
Draco swallowed. "Just don't invite him over for tea," he muttered, trying to sound annoyed. "I'm going to bed, night," he yawned, trying to leave quickly without looking suspicious.
He shuffled back to his bed and froze when he reached it. He’d left the sheets crumpled, his duvet in a pile at the end of the bed. But now, it was made perfectly.
” Draco pointed out, “your connection with Cedric won’t be the same as your connection to the next person you fancy, or the next person you
"Really?" Harry raised his eyebrows, reaching forward to grab Draco's hand when he started to pick at his fingernails. "Would that mean we don't have to hide anymore?"
"C'mon, we're going to be late," Draco interrupted his revelation by collecting Harry's textbooks for him.
“See?" He tightened his arms around Draco and sighed in contentment. "Of course I care," he leaned back to give him a kiss on the cheek.
particular vase was finished moments before Harry had Draco tied to the bed, gripping the sheets and whimpering.
"I'm leaving." I announced, trying to turn around, but he grabbed my upper arm, forcing me to stay still. For a moment, the only sound was my uncontrolled breathing.
it,” he confessed, rubbing the back of his neck. “Listen, I—” he looked like he wanted to say something, but he paused at the surprised look on Draco’s face.
Harry held his breath, wincing at every clatter of dishes he heard from his seat on Draco’s bed, the curtains drawn to hide him from view. He breathed a sigh of relief when he heard a hushed,
It landed on Parvati, who chose truth, and Draco scrambled for an easy question to ask. “Who do you fancy?”
airborne. It’s like a respiratory virus. It’s spread through coughing and sneezing. Come on guys, we can handle this. We’ve been through worse.” These were seventh and eighth years, after all.
Harry tilted his head. "Yeah, maybe," he said, "I dunno if I want to go into healing. It sounds fun, though."
—stopping directly in front of him. He suddenly felt very vulnerable as Harry gazed down at him, and he reached up to brush two knuckles against Draco’s cheekbone—
like his own—it was his dad's. "I–I don't know what to say," he said finally, unable to keep the smile off his face. "Thank you."
Harry grinned, wrapping his arms around Draco’s shoulders. “That’s what I thought you’d say, you emotionally constipated cutie.”
of an overreaction?” Harry couldn’t see, but Draco’s face had morphed into one of concern, probably wondering
What had started as a simple flu outbreak had quickly escalated to something much worse. Two days earlier, a fifth year turned up to the hospital wing with the flu, and no amount of pepper-up or fever-reducers could alleviate the symptoms. By the next day, twelve others had the same symptoms. The staff responded accordingly, encouraging students to wash their hands and report to the hospital wing if they’re sick. Unfortunately, this didn’t do much to slow the progression of the strange illness, as the next day, the hospital wing was packed. At that point, sick students were asked to stay in their dorms while the staff planned a course of action.
“Yeah, everything’s fine,” Harry said, standing awkwardly at the edge of the table. “It’s just… remember how I asked you how my mum and dad reacted when you guys started dating?” He waited for them to nod before continuing. “Well, one of the reasons I asked was because—” Harry started nervously, looking down at the table, “because I wanted to know how they'd react if I…came out to them.”
“So, uh…” Harry waited to see if Malfoy would say anything. He debated his options—Malfoy clearly wasn’t interested in discussing anything, so maybe Harry could get away with pretending that none of this had ever happened. However, this was an opportunity that he didn’t think he’d ever have again. And if he didn’t take advantage of it…
"Is that you, Harry?" Draco called from the depths of their shared closet, his voice severely muffled by the clothing. "Hey, which of these should I wear tonight?" His voice became clearer as he exited the closet, holding two sets of dress robes. "Babe?" He frowned as he caught sight of Harry, who was trying
He huffed. “It’s only because I’ve experienced a lot of pain, asshole. Not because I’m better than you.”
“Oh, good, you’re awake,” Madam Pomfrey greeted cheerfully, hurrying over to his bed. “Here you go, dear,” she carefully put his glasses on his face for him. “How are you feeling?”
“Two can play at that game,” Harry said after a moment, before opening his mouth to make a horrific, inhumane hissing sound.
"Alright then," I answered, and it was difficult to keep myself from grinning. I picked up my bag from the floor—I hadn't even realized I'd dropped it—and we walked down the hallway together this time. We were almost late for Ancient Magic, but

figured it out before we even did—they started leaving us alone together and making bets on when it would happen.”
He disapparated as soon as he was outside the wards, landing somewhere outside the Manor. Now it's only a matter of figuring where the
Now that his hands were free, Harry took the opportunity to pick his glasses off the floor and shove them on his face.
Harry heart was beating too hard again, as if someone was squeezing it in their fist, forcing it to pump harder and harder. "And then we were captured, and you—" He sighed. "That's what it took for me to—to admit it." He forced himself to look Draco in the eye. It was now or never. "Can I kiss you?"
In fact, he may have attempted to snog Harry multiple times throughout their date, but either Draco chickened out or Harry was completely oblivious to the subtle hints he dropped. Or maybe it was both.
“What the hell was that?” Draco wheezed. The pain was gone—it’d disappeared as soon as Harry was within a few feet of him.
Voldemort was announcing Harry's death, now, in the destroyed courtyard where the survivors were gathered.
Draco smirked, leaning over to whisper in Harry's ear. "I'll be sure to keep that in mind," he breathed. Their friends snickered when Harry made a strangled sound and turned bright red.
Harry opened his eyes to look at him and regretted it immediately. The anxiety written across Draco’s face confirmed his worst fear—this must be one
Draco’s voice usually sounded a little tight when he greeted Harry, which always made him laugh—because he
Draco grumbled to himself as she prattled on, making a face at Potter, but smiled and nodded enthusiastically when she looked over at him.
"I dunno, he's cute, older, interested in me… how do I know if I liked him for the right reasons? And if I
Ancient Magic was on the sixth floor corridor, which meant that—yes, there it was. I hurried over to the knight statue, ducking behind its accompanying tapestry.
Draco sat on the floor, his back to the shower and his hands over his eyes while Potter quickly showered. It was fine—that is, until Potter opened the cap of his body wash and squirted what sounded like a generous amount into his palm.
Draco was tapping his fingers on the pages of his textbook. “You’re going to have to explain what happened,” he reached for Harry’s hand and gave it a squeeze. “I still don’t understand the situation all that well.”
Harry was cut off when Draco spun him around, pushing him up against the wall and kissing him hard. Harry's hands instinctually went to Draco's hair as his confusion and indignation vanished from his mind.
Harry stumbled forward from the force of the crowd, nearly tripping over a Death Eater lying prone in the dirt. Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted the blood pooling from his left arm. The Dark Mark—it was gushing blood. Which meant that Malfoy—
Hagrid was wrapping Harry in his cloak by the time Draco arrived. "Goodbye, Harry," his voice wavered as he placed the body in an alcove. Draco watched from around the corner as Hagrid bowed his head and left.
Draco watched a series of emotions flicker across Harry’s face and desperately wanted to know what was going through his mind.
“You didn’t think we wouldn’t accept you, did you?” Remus got out of his chair to join them. “Because we do! So much!”
"In the midst of an overexcited crowd who encouraged the diggers with their voice and gesture, they began to dig." (from
Harry’s love was subtle. It was the way he’d wake Draco from a nightmare with a soft kiss, or how he’d bring Draco lunch at work when he’d forgotten it.
Harry frowned. What are the students without owls supposed to do for communication during this quarantine? Surely
Panic flitted across Potter’s face, and he quickly turned and hurried out of the bathroom. “Let’s get ready for dinner,” he said.
“How am I supposed to concentrate with your damn owl tapping the window every five minutes?” Draco continued. It was the first thing he’d said all day—they hadn’t spoken since Harry’s outburst yesterday morning.
your fault for insulting me during class,” Harry rolled his eyes. As much as he hated to admit it, it wasn’t entirely true, because Harry was already thinking about him before Malfoy had even insulted him. There was just something about Malfoy during potions class—the way the steam flushed his skin and left his hair in loose curls…
It always started with anger, and it always started with Malfoy. Just when it seemed my insides were going to boil over in rage, it would subside—in its place was something new. My face would get red, and I couldn't breathe, as if the air would burn my lungs. All I knew was that somehow, Malfoy was causing it.
Harry left for the stands, not waiting for Draco's reaction. He resisted the urge to turn back and look, but if he had, he would've seen Draco gripping the entryway in an effort to stay upright.
"You still fancy women." He finished, and I nodded. "Merlin, Potter," he looked up at the ceiling, "you're a fucking
Draco raised an eyebrow in surprise before looking away. “No. She’d be gone for too long. Pansy and Blaise transferred to Beauxbatons, and the Manor isn’t exactly a block over."
Harry’s heart skipped a beat when the whole dropper of snail slime fell into the cauldron, and he only had a split second to shove Ron aside and shield him from the ensuing explosion with his body.
“Yeah—yeah, there is,” he said shortly, hoping Draco would get the hint. He moved his food wrappers off his lap and started gathering them to throw them out. “Where’s the bin?”
“I know, I’m only joking,” he leaned forward to kiss Harry on the cheek. “Here, take the damn ring already, unless you’ve already changed your mind.”
"What?" Draco's head snapped in surprise, before schooling his features into a neutral expression. "What about him?"
"I've never eaten this late before," Harry commented as he lifted a piece of treacle tart to his mouth. "I've already brushed my teeth, and everything."
Harry frowned as Draco took a small sip of his pumpkin juice. "Are you nervous for Quidditch?" He stared at the food on Draco's plate—he hadn't touched any of it.
“That’s just because I care about you,” Harry said, and he flushed. “Right, I guess I see your point.”
Harry opened his eyes far too slowly, and he turned to see Hermione, with one hand still on the doorknob and the other over her mouth. “
Draco swallowed and nodded. “All good,” he said in a cheery voice that did not match his demeanor. “Come sit down.”
"That's right," Harry said. "That was your first mistake. Your second mistake was killing my parents. Your
Potter frowned, and he appeared to be slowly connecting the dots as he considered what Neville had asked.
Draco looked taken aback, as if he'd forgotten about Harry's admission just moments earlier, before regaining his composure. "No, you cannot," he said haughtily, turning his nose up. "Win this war, and I shall reconsider."
Draco laughed softly, cupping Harry’s face in his hand. “You protect me from the world without leaving me ignorant—because you
He scrubbed his scalp with shampoo, trying to get the nightmare out of his head. It would be forgotten within a few hours, but the emotions that it brought would linger.. Harry finished his shower, but stayed under the water for a few extra minutes, letting the hot water wash over his shaking body. He pressed on the sides of his nose, trying to drain out any remaining tears and remove any sign of crying. A glamour charm wouldn’t work, as his wand was still under his pillow in the other room—his wandless magic was too inconsistent for that. Turning on the cold tap, he stood with his face directly in the spray of water to reduce any swelling.
Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips at Harry’s foul language. “Be nice,” she told Malfoy. “Mr. Potter, both of your cores are far too volatile at this point. If we separate you, you risk damaging your cores irreparably. Which, I might add, would be horrifically painful.”
Something had happened when the horcrux in my scar was destroyed. My emotions were all over the place—I could never tell what I was feeling. I was supposed to be getting better, I was supposed to be
for Merlin's sake, cut me some slack." He probably would've kicked me if I wasn't ten feet away. "Well?" He continued, "I told you mine, so now it's your turn."
Draco wasn’t sure if they were even arguing with each other at this point—it was more like they were monologuing without actually listening to what the others were saying. From a few seats down, Draco could see Goyle eyeing the food that sat between Granger and Pansy. Wordlessly, he grabbed the nearest chicken pie and passed it over to him. After all, Goyle clearly didn’t care about the situation, and he certainly shouldn’t starve because of it. Besides, chicken pie was his favorite. Goyle gratefully accepted it and dug in.
“Don’t mention it,” Harry replied as he opened the window for Hedwig. Draco didn’t know why he even bothered with the window if he was opening and closing it every five minutes. Harry untied the message from Hedwig’s leg and set her in her cage, leaving the door open. “She’s all yours.”
Harry did as he was told, being sure to count on his fingers so he wouldn't lose track. "Then what?"
“Merlin, Potter, why are you so damn clingy?” he scoffed, “were you not held as a child, or something?” He froze as the words left his mouth. “Shit, I’m sorry,” he watched Harry with wide eyes, realizing with a sinking feeling that he may have just ruined
Harry looked desperately at Ron and Hermione, who were watching him sympathetically. He furrowed his brow; if Ron was infected… then Hermione probably was, too. Hermione nodded when she saw his realization.
At this point, Draco was completely lost. He had no idea where Pansy’s claim had come from. Not only that, but no one seemed surprised by it. In fact, they all seemed... in on it? Draco felt like the world was slipping under his feet, any understanding he had of the situation vanishing.
I don’t need your bloody snake-language, anyway. Now, shove over!” He shuffled over on the couch so that he could lay back, propped up against a pillow. Harry took the opportunity to rest his head against Draco’s chest—which was
“Well, I didn’t know that at the time,” Harry said dryly, watching in surprise as Draco stood from the couch and started to pace. It was a subtle detail, but Draco wasn’t looking at
"What do you want, Malfoy?" I snapped. I crossed my fingers, praying that the feeling wouldn't appear as long as I didn't look at him.
"Yeah, that's right," Draco said matter-of-factly, reaching forward to swipe the vase out of Harry's hand. "We're keeping it."
will help.” He placed his food on his lap and waved his wand over it to demonstrate. It was a trick that Mrs. Weasley had shown him—Harry found it really useful for heavier foods that often made him sick.
Draco opened his mouth, intending to speak, but a lump in his throat prevented any sound from coming out.
Draco blinked, trying to sort through the dozens of thoughts that flashed through his mind. What Harry had done
Harry smirked at the shock on Draco’s face, lowering his voice as he took a step closer. “Liked that, did you?”
“You could think about all of the innocent Muggles being killed up in Gloucester,” Draco suggested innocently, “that ought to get back to your old self-sacrificing self.”
“Every person will feel different, you know,” he paused as Harry dragged his eyes from the fire to look at him, “Every person you fancy, every person you
“I’m sorry,” Harry blurted. “About, um, sixth year. I’ve always wanted to say that but I just—I didn’t know

Ron said in horror, "that means they still have that drawing I did in charms—" he cut himself off, glancing nervously to his mum before shutting his mouth.
on Harry’s behalf. For a fleeting moment, Harry thought that perhaps Draco was overreacting—he didn’t even know the
It had been a few days since Harry kissed Draco on the cheek, and neither of them had mentioned it. Harry was
“Well, because you—” he rubbed the back of his neck in a very Harry-like fashion. “Because you’ve never mentioned marriage before, not even in passing; I had no idea if you, I don’t know, thought it was stupid, or something.” He waited a moment before continuing. “I’ve been stressing about this for months,” he confessed.
"Er, yeah," Harry whispered back. "Just getting a glass of water." He made his way over to the sink and filled a glass with water for good measure and hoped she didn't notice that he was wearing his cloak. "Goodnight."
Draco asked in astonishment, and Harry looked over to see him clutching a pair of forks and knives. “Why are you eating with your
He supposed it wouldn’t be entirely unbearable—that is, if Malfoy decided to be anything but insufferable.
he cast, and to Harry’s surprise, the white, translucent tendrils that flowed out of Draco’s wand quickly grew to form an incorporeal Patronus. “See? I’m doing it!”
flat together—because even though Draco already lived with Harry, they wanted a place they could call
"You should go to bed early, I think," Harry giggled as he watched Draco grow sleepier. "It's already nine-thirty."
The bottle once again landed on Pansy, and he gave her the first dare that came to mind in an effort to divert everyone’s attention from him.
“You can’t force it,” Harry explained, “if your magic comes from a place of anger or frustration, the Patronus charm will never work. Trust me, I know. Imagine your magic pooling inside of you and picture it as water flowing out of your wand,” he frowned at how silly he sounded. “That’s what I do, at least.”
“Oh, they knew I had magic,” Harry said grudgingly, “but that didn’t matter to them. Once, I got suspended for climbing on the roof of the school. My cousin and his friends were chasing me, and it was either
"Which is…?" Harry looked through the scraps of parchment, skimming the notes. One of the scraps had a drawing of a golden snitch, with the letters
“Hmm,” Harry craned his head to read the notes he’d already written, but the fire was nearly out at this point, and he couldn’t make out the words. “What’s it about?”
"No you don't." Ron scoffed. "You always forget that Hermione has ancient runes during our Wednesday free period!"
"Hey," Harry grabbed his wrist and pulled him close, wrapping his arms around his waist. "It's okay. You just needed time to process."
The air rushed out of Draco's lungs, his lips hovering over Harry's. "Oh," he breathed, and leaned in again.
when he mended ties with Harry Potter, and Harry had casually mentioned in passing that he was bisexual.
"Thanks," Draco smiled gratefully, reclaiming his hand as they continued to the dungeons, "Madam Pomfrey better watch out, or you'll put her out of business."
“Good answer,” Narcissa nodded. “When the time comes, just ask Draco for the charms. I expect you never learned of them growing up.”
This feeling wasn’t unfamiliar to him, unfortunately. Since the war ended, Harry had found himself getting claustrophobic—in the bathroom, in a walk-in closet, and
Harry laughed and hit Draco on the shoulder. Draco protested when the grease on Harry’s hands got on his robes, rolling his eyes.
When they finally pulled away, Draco’s heart was beating so fast he was dizzy. Harry looked just as dazed, and he lowered his head so that his forehead rested on Draco’s shoulder. “Holy shit,” he breathed.
more upset about losing the bet than he was about the fact that his two best mates were dating,” Sirius added.
Harry stared into the dying flames of the fireplace for a moment. “Because of what—what happened,” he waved his hand in the air, hoping Draco would understand.
Draco took three deep breaths to calm himself down before pulling the ribbon off the cover and hiding it in his bookcase. He'd think about it later—not now, when Harry would be over at any second. They hadn't talked about doing, well,
Harry was about to respond that he had just as much of a right to owl mail as Draco did, when he realized that Draco hadn’t sent
“No, that’s okay!” Harry said quickly when Draco glanced to his bedroom, already deciding on a different book to choose.
“And the time Ron was unconscious,” she added. “Wait a minute,” she said, leaning towards Harry and frowning.
“Why—” Draco swallowed. Yesterday, Harry exploded a glass when Draco had called him a… “Why did you think you were a freak?” He wasn’t sure if he was ready to hear the answer.
Also, I imagine a more simple/basic lightning charm would be something like 'levigatis' (a conjugation of levigo)
Draco crossed his arms, going back to Not Looking at Potter while the arguing continued. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Longbottom come running over to the eighth year table, his arms flailing.
As soon as the moss was submerged, it began to bubble rapidly, emitting thick steam and changing to a bright red color. Harry jumped back as their potion exploded, splattering them in thick liquid.

“Actually, I’m glad I caught you,” Bill said with a sheepish yet still charming smile. “You mind if I get your opinion on something, while you’re here?”
“I didn’t say you were. Clearly, it worked.” A pause. “The Fidelius Charm is incredibly complex. I’m impressed. There aren’t many wizards who could do the same.”
“Hey, Teds,” he murmured, walking over before he hesitated, not sure if Andromeda wanted him near her grandson after he’d—
He was losing a lot of blood, he realized, could feel himself getting dizzy. He looked down and saw darkness staining his white shirt all the way up to his chest, soaking into his suit and robes, trailing down his hip.
was holding them off, but he could hear them scuttling beyond his sight. They stirred up a bunch of childhood fears he’d thought he’d gotten over, but they were nothing to the presence lurking at the very edge of the cellar. Over the past two days he’d come to the realization that there was something else inside Number 12 along with all the boggarts and doxies and ill-tempered house-elves, and it seemed to dislike Harry very much.
“Actually,” Robards interrupted, standing now with his full, imperious height, “I have a thought on that. We don’t know who else might be involved, if this was just the grudge of two schoolmates or something bigger. Until we know what we’re looking at, you’d be safer—”
Harry cast around for a quill to respond, but the piece of parchment was ripped from his hand, disappearing once more into a puff of smoke. Another ten seconds, and one more, slightly larger, piece of parchment popped in to Harry’s lap.
Harry ignored him, dousing the lights as he went. Each one of them snuffing the last flames in his heart, leaving him cold and dark and alone.
Neville and Hermione stood over the writhing corpse of Nagini, Hermione clutching the Sorting Hat to her chest and Neville with two hands clasped over the hilt of the Sword of Godric Gryffindor, both of them wearing similarly stunned expressions.
He stared down into the face of the man who had hounded his steps his whole life, who had twisted Harry almost as much as he had twisted himself, and Tom Riddle stared back.
“Yes, yes…” Kreacher turned and walked out of the greenhouse, moving slowly like he was drunk. “Kreacher… Yes…”
Harry arched his brow when Malfoy did nothing, that familiar thrill of annoyance he always felt when he thought of Malfoy zipping up his spine. Except he wasn’t annoyed now. It felt more like—anticipation. He didn’t buy into all that optics shite, but he knew what happened next was going to matter.
“Morning, Hermione,” he said blandly, catching the rolled up magazine as she tried to smack him with it. He held on as she tried to pull it back, which only made her angrier. “I didn’t know you still read the Quibbler.”
But how many times had heard about the cruelty of Slytherin House before he even got to Hogwarts? Hagrid, Ron, they’d both come right out and said that Slytherins were evil, no question. Getting to know Malfoy and his goons had only confirmed this, and Snape had set out to make his life hell the moment he walked in the door. The rivalry, the antagonism—his first year at Hogwarts had been framed by it, and every year since. Slytherin versus the rest of the school, the rest of the world.
“He wasn’t. They have ankle cuffs spelled so that if they don’t check in on time, they’re cursed.” He shook his head again, trying to control his voice. “They made a registry, again. Except this time it’s not muggleborns, it’s teenagers from Slytherin, coming in to make sure their parents behave. They’re being used as leverage.”
None of it reached him here in the shadowed nook. He’d set himself apart from all of that. But…had he ever really been
feeling. Some fucked up byproduct of his existence had conspired to make it so that his soul was broken and tarnished and bloody, corrupted by the deaths of his parents and the darkness of the man who’d marked him as his equal, but he felt just the same as he had when he’d mourned for Sirius. When he’d dragged Cedric’s body back to Hogwarts. He felt like he was on fire and he couldn’t understand
I don’t care—” The door lit up with purple light, followed by a sharp yelp of pain from the other side. Ron was actually trying to break in. His muffled voice shouted in frustration. “Let me in! Come
Malfoy’s eyes flicked between the wand and Harry’s face. His nostrils flared as he sat forward again. “You think I want it after you’ve gone and spoiled it?”
Also the distressing knowledge that an angry spirit was living inside Grimmauld Place had only been unearthed once he did a bit of blood magic, so it was all a wash anyway.
He blinked again, and a few more times, eyes flicking back and forth across the room. He waited for something to explode, or catch fire, or maybe one of the dressers would transfigure itself into a big hairy monster and jump at him, but nothing happened. He had the thought that he should probably see to his wounds, that whatever job the house—the bloody
Harry gestured to his wand sitting on the table, nestled between full cups of cold tea and the crumbs of a discarded biscuit. “Of course.”
They didn’t talk about Sirius in the same way they didn’t talk about any of the people they’d lost. He was present, like Remus, Tonks, Ted, and Bellatrix were present. It was hard to imagine Bellatrix with a family, especially with Andromeda as family. She was so different, he sometimes forgot she’d left that life.
Of course he wasn’t out of the woods. He still sometimes felt like he was lying on the mossy, cold ground in that dark clearing. Like he’d never left.
He had to force himself to keep tracing Regulus’s notes. Regulus turned then to bigger, more theoretical concepts, which Harry struggled to follow. Here a Russian (or Polish, he still had no idea—it might be some other Slavic language for all he knew) book seemed to cause Regulus quite a lot of frustration, but he’d taken to writing in whatever that language was, just like with the German book. Harry only gleaned a few things from the sparse English phrases;
Harry forced himself to hold Ron’s gaze, trying not to lose his temper. He had no ground to stand on here. He felt like shite for keeping things from Ron and Hermione. He’d fucking murdered someone,
anyone. He guessed Molly and Arthur knew, but he had no idea if Ginny had told anyone else. He was surprised, actually, that Molly hadn’t already tracked him down to make him feel guilty. Arthur’d probably told her to let him be.
The moment folded in on itself and suddenly Harry was standing in Dumbledore’s office amidst the shattered pieces of the things Harry had broken in an attempt to make his own pain stop.
Andromeda walked up next to him, a hand pressed gently to his shoulder. “Looks like you’re not the only one.”
“I think,” he started slowly, “that Draco didn’t realize what he’d gotten himself into. I think he found out the hard way that he wasn’t up to the same level of cruelty he liked to mess around with as a kid. I don’t know.”
The room was deathly quiet. Kingsley was looking down at Harry with a horrible pity and guilt in his eyes. Every single one of them was staring. Waiting. What else was he going to say? How much more of his heart did he have to offer up to them on a plate smeared with his own blood?
“You didn’t have to give Xenophilius Lovegood, of all the ludicrous—of all the people you could have spoken to, an exclusive. And you didn’t so much as mention this to me! How do you think I felt, reading this this morning? How do you think
His stomach turned the moment he thought of Malfoy, halting his fork and knife altogether for the first time in thirty minutes.
He stopped when the crowd parted to reveal Malfoy leaning against the fountain in almost the same position Harry had seen him a week ago—staring right at him. Malfoy looked every bit as polished as he had before, though there was a restless light to his eyes, a tension in him today. Dimly Harry noted Zabini try to get Malfoy’s attention, another figure, Nott, take a few more steps toward him. Malfoy didn’t so much as acknowledge them.
Kamau took her time, giving Harry a long, considering look. “I hope one of these days we meet under happier circumstances, sweetie.” Her large dark eyes seemed to bore through him. “I’m sorry to say that you’ve more than lived up to your reputation.”
Out of the corner of his eye he caught Hermione looking at him, trying to draw his gaze. He rose and walked past her without so much as turning his head, up to the center of the chamber. There was no chair this time, just a simple dais facing the senior officers of the court, Madam Yeats, Percy in his old job as the Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, the court scribe, a squat man with ludicrously yellow hair and wide glasses which swallowed his whole face, and, of course, Kingsley.
snaked into Voldemort’s mouth and Harry felt it because it was his curse as much as it was Voldemort’s. He had been holding it inside him since he was a baby, and now he was giving it back. He was closing the circle.
He thought again about the Resurrection Stone just sitting in the dirt somewhere, covered in leaves and roots. He thought, for the first time, that maybe even shadows would be better than nothing.
A soft pop of noise signaled Kreacher’s arrival. “Master Harry is wanting dinner? Kreacher is not wanting to disturb Master while he is reading so intently, but Mistress Andromeda—”
But he wasn’t going to say that out loud. He had a feeling they would only try to reassure him, convince him it was a fluke. The product of two kids succumbing to hate.
Someone ran into Harry and shoved him to the side. Molly Weasley nearly bowled over him as she lifted her wand, opened her mouth—
He followed the motion of Charlie’s throat, watching the knot dip and the muscles flex. There was another scar on his upper arm which looked freshly healed, bright red amongst the bevy of freckles.
Regulus had noted how it was best to be careful that the soul of one’s victim remained in its body to ensure the full effect of the curse, that the human soul could attempt to save itself by burying deep into the human psyche, to effectively lobotomize itself in the case of extreme psychological or emotional damage, thereby rendering any curse focused on the mind to become null and void.
Felicity, face flushed, did a half-bow as she shuffled along after. “It was an honor, Mr. Potter. Truly.”
But Malfoy looked like a completely different person too. Like he was trying as hard as he possibly could to leave, to be as distant as he could from this room.
He moved methodically through the rest of the spell, sweat building in the small of his back and at his temples. The disc continued to smooth out until it was a foot across and thin as a sheet of silk. It began to vibrate, the magic separating from his blood and falling down like snowflakes onto the plant in tiny dust particles of green and gold light. Where they touched, the plant twitched. A soft popping sound began to fill the air as more of the cleansing magic sifted down onto the withered and lesioned plant.
The thought was so abhorrent, so absolutely vile, that some part of his brain shut off. Shock, he knew, probably, as he shifted Goyle off the road and into the little stand of trees, behind one of the bushes. A bird startled out and flew off. Harry errantly wanted to watch it go, anything to stop looking at Goyle’s body, but he couldn’t look away.
kill someone. What happened to Goyle wasn’t a fucking accident. Harry had killed him. He didn’t know how, and he hadn’t meant to, but it wasn’t an
Harry looked down at his ale, an unpleasant twist in his gut. He hadn’t known she was going for that, actually. It made sense, though. She’d certainly talked about it enough when they were still together. And the year off while Hogwarts was closed would give her plenty of opportunities to get some real life experience. She was good enough to play professionally.
Finally, he found the page where Regulus had written small notes next to the list of books he’d gathered, but on this one, the unnamed book with the symbol burned into the front, there was nothing except a single sentence;
“I just wish there was something…” Bill said quietly. “I can’t help but feel like he’s drifting away and we’re all just watching. It’s all I can do to keep my parents from dragging him back and locking him in the Burrow, but I don’t think he likes it here much more. Thought it might do him good to give him some space. Fleur and I have tried but…”
He’d certainly believed enough in Grindelwald’s vision of the world. Grindelwald, the boy he’d most likely loved, and who had, before Voldemort, been the single most destructive wizard to hit Europe in centuries. You didn’t just fall into love with someone like that. Not someone as clever as Dumbledore. Even as a teenager, he would have known Grindelwald was dangerous. Maybe that’s what he’d liked about him. Perfect Albus Dumbledore, head of his class, the brightest wizard of his age, destined for greatness and hungry for it after a childhood of poverty and disappointment and death.
“I did,” Percy said. “They asked me back. Figured I could try to undo some of my own mistakes.” He stopped rather abruptly in front of the lift. If people hadn’t already been moving around them like water around a boulder, he might have caused a pile up. With an air of hard-earned determination, he turned to Harry and said stiffly, “I owe you an apology, Harry.”
“What I was saying,” Robards said slowly, a note of that deep-running kindness in his voice now where he’d been all business before, “was that we don’t think they were working with anyone else. Or the evidence we found in their apartment led us nowhere.”
He leaned forward and braced himself against the shower frame, bringing himself off slowly, almost leisurely. Indulging in a way he really hadn’t thought he’d needed to, before. Images flicked through his mind—guilt following after immediately because thinking about Ginny now felt weird. He frowned in frustration and just let his mind drift, hand moving with more intent as he reached below and brushed his balls, exhaling sharply as he tugged, rolling back his foreskin. For a while he didn’t think of anything in particular. He just let himself feel. And
Harry stared at a photograph of himself standing across a busy intersection, looking off to the side but not looking at anything as his hair blew slightly in the wind—the longest piece nearly brushed his chin. His eyes were vacant and hard at the same time, something pained about his expression. As he watched, a crease showed in his brow. He seemed so young. Which was insane, considering it’d been taken only a few weeks ago. He’d been through worse.
“This one was flagged for us, though, because not only was the level of damage too extensive for the normal Magical Law Enforcement Squad or the Improper Use of Magic Office, but reports from the scene indicated that a dark witch was involved, and present at the site. I was the only one in the office at the time, so I went on my own to investigate. Only, it wouldn’t have mattered when I arrived, because…” She hesitated, a look of deep unrest crossing her prim features. “The entire building was in the process of collapsing due to a curse known as the Disintegration of Morgan Le Fay.”
The tightness along his forearms faded as heat spread down his face. Tears, though before they could fall they formed tiny crystals and lifted up into the air. Like frozen beads of dew, catching light and softly reflecting it back to him.
Old magic. Crude, Dumbledore had told him, the idea rooted in the weakening of oneself to gain entry.
“Just get out,” Harry muttered, turning his back and making for the stairs, every step seeming to rock the foundations of the house. His dead godfather’s house. “I’m done.”
Harry let out a sharp, ragged laugh, magic flickering in the palms of his hands. His vision was going spotty. His heart was racing. He felt like he was pitching forward through thin air without a broom or a wand to stop his fall. He was spiraling into dangerous territory, and he didn’t bloody care.
Jets of light arced through the smoke, green and red and black, magic electrifying the air. People were screaming and Harry searched for any sign of his friends but it was useless. The flow of the crowd moved toward the castle. Harry followed. Behind him the sounds of more fighting reached him. A wave of noise crashed over them—Grawp’s booming voice joined with the fierce pounding of hooves.
Harry stopped listening as the antidote began to burn through his body. He didn’t know how long it took, but he felt like he was being scoured out with fire. He tried his best to stay still, but his body couldn’t help jerking in shock whenever the antidote flowed somewhere new. He was dimly aware of Bill talking to him, Andromeda murmuring spells, the image over him flaring with light every once in a while. It all began to blur together until he wasn’t really sure he was still conscious or if he was imagining things.
He didn’t like to think why it had shown itself now, after being here for so long. How it might have everything to do with the fact that he’d started practicing
It all seemed so…unnecessary. People didn’t just want him dead for no reason. Just for fun. They never had before, why would he start thinking so now?
In his darker moments he thought this was exactly the reason why those feelings felt so distant. Harry at sixteen still believed there was some greater meaning to his life. He was on a path that had been set for him before his birth. Ginny had been on that path, the inevitable end to the person he had been when they met for the first time in the Burrow. And not only was that beyond selfish to think, it wasn’t fair to her.
He lingered on the last book, staring intently at the symbol branded into the front. It felt—important. He didn’t know how else to describe it. It felt like it was something he was supposed to recognize but every time he tried to open it he lost his nerve. It didn’t have anything to do with horcruxes, though, so he set it aside for the time being and went back to the ones he could actually read.
After draining his third cup—Kreacher had realized quickly that Harry liked it strong and sweet, and now Harry was in danger of developing a habit it was so good—he sat there listlessly, staring at the peeling wallpaper and hazy light filtering in from the front sitting room. There was less dust today. Come to think of it, he hadn’t coughed once since he’d gotten back.
Harry was trying to pay attention as Charlie explained what he was doing which would take him out of Britain for at least eight months in the fall, trying to find something called an Ottoman Jewelclaw, a breed of dragon thought to have gone extinct around the time of the fall of Constantinople. Apparently everyone in Romania thought he was crazy, “loveably mad,” Charlie had said with a snort—so he was planning on backpacking around the Black Sea on his own to follow up on the few sightings which had reached Charlie, but Harry found it hard to stay present.
“Well, only five recorded, anyway.” Hermione leaned forward, brow furrowed. “Why are you so curious?”
“Mr. Malfoy is due to check in with his probation auror at seven,” the auror said. “I was merely arriving to escort him.”
And this was the thing Harry had been dreading. He knew how Sirius had felt about this place. He’d agreed, and part of him still understood with sharp clarity just how much weight this house carried, and wouldn’t it just be easier to go somewhere else, to leave all of this behind?
Robards was just as professional as he had been last time, nodding his head toward Harry. “Thank you for meeting me so early, Harry.”
had done might not have been the most thorough, but the softness of his bed was a powerful deterrent.
Harry stifled a sob, trying not to wake Teddy. Andromeda pulled him into a gentle embrace. She sat with him for a few more minutes, letting him cry into her shoulder until he could stop, before she offered him the potion and guided him down onto the bed.
“You were attacked, Harry. You acted in self-defense. There’s nothing for you to confess. Not right now. When you’re healed up, we’ll go from there. Right now you just need to stay here and stay safe. You’re no use to anyone—” Bill swallowed tightly. “You can’t confess if you insist on hurting yourself, all right?”
Andromeda’s voice cut through the panic in his chest. It was firm and steady and she sounded so much like her sister calling across a ruined courtyard that tears pricked at Harry’s eyes. It wasn’t the same. She wasn’t his mother. He barely knew her. But that didn’t stop some part of him aching with it.
Kingsley wasn’t smiling, but there was something sad about his eyes now. Harry found it odd to think of Kingsley as he had been then—a double agent for the Order, protecting Sirius from the same Ministry he now led. The difference a few years could make…
“That depends. I was one when he killed my parents to get to me, then he tried again when I was eleven. Had a few nice years there where he left me alone, then he tried again when I was fourteen and fifteen. After that it was any time he got the chance, really.”
He sat back, exhaling in an attempt to calm down. If he wasn’t careful, he was going to start shouting soon. Why had he thought this would go well?
—but he ended up just sitting in Sirius’s old room, listening to records and thumbing through photo albums and ticket stubs, letters stuffed into the bottom of drawers. He found a whole chest of clothes hidden behind a false wall in his closet, band t-shirts and ratty jumpers and pants that had so many holes in them he struggled to think why Sirius hadn’t just chucked them. He stopped when he found a black leather jacket, running his thumb over the initials stitched into the collar—
“The Return of Old King Stag,” found written on a scrap of bloodstained parchment in 1869 by Emily Gerard where it was slipped between the pages of
He closed his eyes, gritted his teeth, hating the voice which slid so easily into his head. Why did Malfoy have to be right?
He was sore, but no more sore than after a grueling quidditch game. In fact he could recall more than one practice when Wood was still captain when he’d woken the next day to wonder if his bones all hadn’t started screaming and his flesh had been replaced with poorly glued on parchment.
He’d saved Harry’s life a few times too, hadn’t he? That changed how you thought about a person. The war had changed all of them. It just put Harry off, that was all, and his life was an unmitigated disaster at the moment and he was…
He felt their eyes on his back as he walked through the pub. Bless them both, neither Bill nor Charlie brought it up again. Harry assumed Bill had warned Charlie off. He hadn’t told Bill he and Ginny had split up, but he probably guessed when Harry spent a full month at his house and didn’t seem to mind the fact that his supposed girlfriend never visited or floo-ed except to check in with Bill.
Having temporarily forgot that Draco was still in the room sharing a coffee with him, he remembered how Draco had looked on his broom the other day for comparison to that awful night. Draco’s hair was no longer suffocated under oils or gel, and his platinum-blond hair hung freely - perfectly even, and it almost glowed under the bright sunshine. Harry thought, it made his messy black hair look atrocious in comparison.
Harry shrugged, wanting to make seem like he wasn’t bothered either way. “Have a chat, get to know each other a little better I suppose. Company. It’s up to you. The offer’s there.” Harry leaned forward and picked out a grape from the fruit bowl, popping it into his mouth.
just the increase of work that was expected of fifth years in comparison to fourth year … either way, he’d feel better knowing her head of house was aware of the change. The girl seemed happy enough right now though … but then it was Christmas day.
Tau also felt very strongly about Elliot’s lack of action. The fact that Elliot didn’t get help, didn’t get out of the mess he had found himself in, didn’t save his wife and daughter in time or go to the ministry for help, seemed to be one of Tau’s main concerns with the main character.
“Er, hello Mrs. Malfoy,” Harry said sheepishly. His heart was racing, but not necessarily from what might happen to
Draco was already glaring at him as McGonagall continued. “Each pair will choose a room in the east wing, and a house elf will deliver your things by the end of the day. There will be
Before anyone could consider his question, Snape stood from his desk, scowling. He flicked his wand behind him as headed for the door, vanishing the contents of their cauldrons. “You are
"Er, yes, thank you Hermione—it requires that professors keep all academic materials for a certain number of years after a student's graduation. Therefore, it wasn't too difficult to gather these," he gestured to the album.
“Oh, fuck off,” Harry grumbled, adding a few logs to the fire and standing up. “Let's just get to bed so we can get started early.” He turned away from the fireplace and paused.
“This isn’t over, you hear me?” Draco huffed, returning to the couch and poking his finger into Harry’s chest.
Harry opened his mouth to reply, and Draco jumped at the hissing sound that came out. He’d been under the impression that Harry had lost his parseltongue after the war ended, but evidently that was not the case.
"I'm surprised, myself," Draco admitted with a flush as Harry stepped back to walk with him towards the castle. "It took me a bit to figure out what they were doing."
Draco blinked at him, struggling to decide which statement he should respond to first. “You—you like me, huh?”
leaving.” He turned on his heel and rushed for the doorway, nearly tripping on the chair he’d pulled out from the kitchen table.
Harry leaned forward towards the fire and gave a halfhearted shrug. “I think? I don’t know. I don’t know a lot of things. I
For example, that collection of tiny ceramic goblets was from the time that Harry decided to spend the entire weekend at the wheel,
couldn't focus on a movie at the moment—the idea made him feel like his mind was being squeezed from all sides. It must have shown on his face, because Draco jumped up and led him to the couch, assuring him that he didn't even have to pay attention to whatever film they chose—he just wanted Harry to sit with him while they ate dinner.
His past wasn't completely bad, their small family of three used to be happy ... before the Dark lord returned that is, but now he'd never have his family back the way he remembered. He couldn't forgive his parents, not after they almost got him killed, and not after his father turned him into a cold hearted monster that everyone hated. He was so lost, so confused, and so conflicted.
Harry returned to his chambers after a rather long lunch in the kitchen. They must have gotten there at about 2:30pm and it was now nearly 4:00pm. They had spoken more about Mr Silas Avery, moved on to the topic of teaching and certain other students, and then Draco had elaborated on how he came to own a book store in France with his mother. Apparently, they already owned the store, but it had been a shop that dealt with artefacts of a darker nature. The man that ran the store had disappeared, and with living arrangements upstairs above the shop a comfortable two bed apartment, they had decided to gut the shop and move in. After realising that book shops were lacking in the area, they had started a reading corner as they sold of what artifacts remained that were not cursed or dangerous. Eventually they used the money from the sales to stock up on books, and soon enough it became a popular book store serving tea or coffee.
“I wasn’t snooping Draco! I simply glanced over at you as I was shutting the bathroom door. I just recognised what it was, that’s all!”
“I did train with the Auror Department for nearly a year.” Harry explained. “Mr Dale Rogers is head of the Auror Department. Mr Elroy Graves is just the head Auror of his team, but he likes to throw about his title falsely – so people think he’s head of the department. Graves was there when I was training, and he’s always been threatened by me because I was outing him even as a trainee.”
“What is said here, stays here?” Draco clarified slowly, as if confirming that fact and reminding himself of Harry’s words.
Draco: "Harry ... I know I have the manor back now, but I don't wish to step foot in that place let alone live there.  I was wondering if you wouldn't be opposed to me living with you?"
“I’ll see you down there,” Harry was speaking with Madam Pomfrey, “I just need to have a word with Mr Bartlett.”
Draco smiled; he knew what Harry was doing and that was okay by him. Harry knew what he needed – not sympathy, not pity, not even comfort and false promises, but a friend that could just be there to listen and distract him from the pain. He could feel his pain in fragments, remember his past in small pieces, and then count on Harry to take him away from it all when it became too much.
Draco knew it was too good to be true, that Harry would have conveniently forgotten about the Le’Amortentia parchment or decided to do the courteous thing and keep his bloody nose out. He didn’t know why it bothered him if Harry knew or not – perhaps it was a matter of pride, but for some reason he felt like he was being dishonest and he didn’t like having that feeling. Harry was ‘Potter’, his ex-rival, the impulsive golden boy, far too confident, strong-willed, and with a huge sense of morality. Harry would always be too honourable, too liked and loved to be stained by a Malfoy.
"I'll see you tomorrow." Draco said as moved into the corridor, he turned to say something else but…
Draco chuckled into Harry shoulder, and Harry pulled back with a small smile. He squeezed Draco’s shoulder. “We both hide our pain, our grief and our guilt. As misplaced as half of it probably is, it still hurts right?”
And when Mr graves had finally left, Minerva had to inform the stressful house elves that they could now begin clear up, and had to admit that tomorrows lessons had to be cancelled.
Draco: "Now Potter, if it isn't clear by now that I fucking love you then we're officially fucked, because I do love you. I want to spend the rest of my life competing, annoying, saving, and loving you until the day we die. I will take you just as you are you stupid git, bad hair, scars, certain red heads that you come with..."
“Good. If you are all certain that you know your homework requirements, you may be dismissed.” Harry watched his students pack up to leave. “Except you two.” Harry pointed at Duncan Gibson and Monica Reid. They groaned at him but stayed behind.
Draco: "I don't get what you see in Ginger! You do know she walked into the Great Hall earlier kissing Dean Thomas, right?"
"Erm, well ... I'm gay. I'd prefer a male. Blood statues? Magical creatures' blood?" He frowned hoping he didn't look like a complete idiot.
Their lips slammed together, fiery, hungry, dirty ... horny.  They heard steps behind them and quickly parted. If their friends noticed anything, they didn't say.
It was tiring work, and he soon decided to take a break. He sat on his bed - his head against the headboard, his coffee to his left on the bedside table, and he pulled out the magical parchment and quill from the draw. Smiling when he saw the new message, he eagerly read the words.
the effects of the sweet then he wouldn’t have acted so afraid or horrified. “Did someone force or trick you into eating one?” Harry asked.
“I am busy Potter, and I need to finish grading. I’m sure you have work to do likewise,” Draco walked over to the door and held it open, “don’t let me keep you.” Draco knew his words were cold, plain, and he knew they’d hurt Harry, but it was better for both of them this way.
He’d realised though, on the way down to his private room, with Harry there to make sure he was safe, that he couldn’t start a relationship that wasn’t true. If he didn’t feel for Padfoot what he felt for Harry – and, he scoffed, that was bloody unlikely – then he would have to settle for at least second best. His heart would always belong to another, and his relationship would be unfair to Padfoot. He couldn’t do that!
Silas’s eyes landed on him before he ambled out of the classroom, impertinently leaving the door open for Draco to close behind him. Draco swished his wand, sighing in frustration, then turned to Harry.
“We know sir,” Lilium said, “but it’s still a shame that it is over already. The day went rather quickly; I feel as if I’ve just woke up.”
So caught up in their own battle, they didn’t see nor hear the students watching and cheering for their favourite teacher… or just egging on the battle and watching in awe. Their own snow fight had been completely forgotten about, and Filius and Neville kept them at a safe distance while they watched.
Harry was sat in his private chambers - marking homework assignment at the small kitchen table, when he heard the door knock. It was about half two in the afternoon; he hadn’t been expecting anyone.
“Yes. I think Graves is letting his emotions run this case. I was just there; he is determined to find a reason to have the boy arrested but his attitude suggests he blames Minerva.”
He jumped when a pop startled him, and he groaned - frantically trying to grab the damn radio before it ... to late!
“Have you asked him? You should you know.” Harry smirked as he walked to another stall, leaving Draco standing there frowning in thought.
Harry watched in fascination now, as Draco removed the still full vial from the clasp and then reattach it, the chain magically connecting itself back together. A particular memory then slithered its way into Harry’s mind:
Harry looked up into Draco's eyes imploringly, inhaling the scent of Draco as they walked. Hope in his green eyes that Draco would stop being a complete tosser, and would start to be his true self.
Harry nodded. Malaise seemed to be covering everything well enough, but he hadn't really listened to Hermione explaining it to him a couple days ago.
Harry nodded, suddenly feeling awkward. They’d managed to start up a conversation last time fairly easy, so what was with the uncomfortable silence this time? He tried not to stare at Draco, but he glanced up and smiled as Draco caught his eyes.
If Tau wasn’t stumped for words, then he would have criticised Harry’s opinion. He would have written his argument and tried to persuade him otherwise, calling him a peculiar man or something to that degree. The simple ‘Why?’ was screaming at him, screaming with confusion and disbelief.
“What does this have to do with me?” Asked Harry, suspecting he knew which way this was leaning, but he wanted to see what Draco had concluded himself. He hadn’t really spoken to Silas Avery since that day in Draco’s potions class – when the boy had demanded to know what he had been doing in the class room six weeks ago, and they tended to avoid each other in the halls and such.
Harry continued reading, proud of his second-year Ravenclaw student. Sometimes his students made him think in different ways, taught
With that though, he knew what he wanted. He wanted Draco Malfoy with Tau’s personality. Gods help him, he was a sick bastard, but he liked Draco, there was no doubt about that. He had come to realised that he cared for the blond, perhaps a little more that platonic. There were new parts of Draco he was seeing all the time that he… well, he loved those parts of the man. All it would take, was a little more give from Draco - a little more of what Tau had given him in all those letters, and he knew… he knew he would fall in love.
Harry did however, feel almost giddy knowing that Draco had cared enough to prevent him from humiliating himself, and the ghost of fingers against his chest still lingered. He thought for moment back there, that Draco was going to kiss him… Oh, how he wished he had.
a squib!” Draco insisted strongly. He frowned at the strange wooden things that the muggles sold – they had no magical properties; the wood was polished and easy on the eye but nothing he couldn’t transfigure should he need such a thing.
Draco managed to get to his wand, and he cast a few cleaning charms to clear up the sick. The smell was going to make him gag at any rate, but Harry would hopefully appreciate it at the very least – at least he might, when he’d calmed down, but Draco had no idea how to help him do that.
“Oh, of course Mr Potter, we have hundreds of vials but I suddenly feel the need to give myself extra work.” Madam Pomfrey sarcastically responded. “If you must know, we haven’t had a case of Snowflu for years. It is mostly a childhood virus, a virus only young children usually get, but still very rare.”
idea. He had to get out of here to clear his head because… fuck! Potter was beginning to look like a dancing bar of luxurious chocolate, and his heart was in need of a serious scolding for its preposterous behaviour today.
“I’m no longer in the mood Potter!” Draco snapped, snatching his arm back and striding hastily away towards Hogwarts.
Harry flew from his seat and landed on his arse, before he could do anything, a stern voice filled the silent hall.
He rubbed his eyes and sighed, everything was leading to his suspicions being true, and now his vision of Tau’s image – his illusion, was morphing together with Draco’s to form one man. He needed to find out one way or another – for sure, and he would need to be careful in doing so.
Draco then sneezed a second time, catching Harry of guard… lucky however, Draco’s head bobbed towards his chest or Harry would have ended up with a frozen face. Unfortunately, however, Draco had just frozen his own Pyjama top!
“Miss Prescott!” Draco’s voice of annoyance was laced with a cold disappointment, and the entire table went silent.
“Draco?” Harry puzzled why the man was on the floor, concerned when he made no move to get up. It was also rather out of character for the man to be in his pyjamas at this time of the day.
“Draco stop it! You’re not a Death Eater, and I said nothing to that bloody reporter back there.” Harry snapped.
The radio appeared, the date and time reading: Sunday, 27th September 1998, 10:32am. Both Harry and Draco barely had time to gulp, before their senses were taken over by golden light and music.
house of Black. Sirius made me heir before his death – not that I knew that of course, but I hold the tile ‘Lord Black’ now – along with Potter of course.”
-Image of Dudley beating him badly, then behind shoved into the cupboard under the stairs like it was his fault.
Filius, was enjoying the show to be honest, proud of his ex-students use of charms. They maybe teachers now, with a responsibility, but it was Christmas and even the teachers needed to have fun sometimes. What intrigued him the most however, was the obvious fire that burned brightly between them… yes, there’d always been something burning there – the flames of rivalry, competition, enemy’s … but now … now the flames burned for each other. He could see it in their eyes; this battle wasn’t meant to harm, no… but to prove their worth to each other.
“Like you just said, retaliation. I never started it!” Draco made his way over the shower room, Harry followed him.
Harry, completely frozen to the bone, started laughing; Merlin he was exhausted! He collapsed to his knees in surrender.
There was a knock at the door to his private chambers, the sound pulling him from the depths of his thoughts. He should have been grading papers, but once again he’d gotten lost in his own mind.
“Yes, it’s me.” Harry smiled, not realising he was doing so in a way that screamed adoration. “Let’s get you back into bed now!” Harry suddenly demanded, remembering that Draco needed to stay warm. He went to pull Draco of the floor but the blond man flinched away from him, shaking his head in fear.
"Yes, chérie! It is a French term of endearment, and we used 'sweetheart' as our chosen endearment here at Le'Amortentia. I will ask you some questions, we'll get you set up into our records, and then I will bring you ten possible matches. You can choose up to three at a time, but I recommend one to start with. A lot of new clients get a little overwhelmed with more than one. You might find that communicating with one person can take up enough of your spare time as it is. Is that okay Mr Potter? You do not have to use our service, but I think you'll find there isn't anything to lose. You might even find someone interesting."
-Draco takes Harry in the correct hold, him leading - being the better dancer. "Just look at me Harry, no one else matters." Harry blushes at how softly Draco reassured him, and how softly he is being held.
Harry frowned. He may have gotten away with his loss of awareness just now, but wasn't this a bloody awkward question?
It was a very controlled marriage contract, and as the Lord of Black and the Lord of Malfoy at the time had overseen Narcissa’s marriage to Lucius, Harry had to claim that a breach had occurred as the new Lord of Black. There were certainly many breaches, including ‘love and honour thy wife’, ‘keep from harm’, and Harry’s personal favourite, ‘the alliance between families Malfoy and Black will hereby grow stronger with the matrimony…’
Harry managed to make good headway into the plans, but his mind kept drifting to Malfoy - guilt, confusion, questions and curiosity eating away at him. He couldn’t let it sit and go stale, so he grabbed a fresh piece of parchment and decided to send the man a letter of apology and explain himself. He was a thirty-year-old man for Godric’s sake, he could be civil. They weren’t children anymore; they were work colleagues. Unless Malfoy actually did something to warrant suspicion - something other than apologise - he would try to be amicable and polite, and give him the benefit of the doubt.
Whilst he had come to enjoy the muggle tradition, Draco would never understand it completely. He had a theory, as did many wizards although there was no proof on the matter, that this Jesus person was actually a wizard born to a muggle mother. It would explain the ‘miracles’ the man was worshiped for. Nothing was written to prove this idea however, except what muggles called ‘the bible’ which was apparently written by Jesus’s and his father’s muggle disciples. Of course, there were too many wizards, either half-bloods or muggle-borns, that held what Draco would call a muggle religion. It was for this reason that the ministry left it alone, let wizards believe what they did and join in with the festivities. At least, over the years, wizards had developed their own traditions, much like atheists who stuck to a story about Santa for the children – another wizard perhaps, that wasn’t careful who witness his magic. Still, the idea that it was a time for family was a wonderful notion after all, except… Draco’s mother was still in France and his father was locked up in Azkaban.
He looked over at Draco, taking in his elegantly long fingers and the way they held the books – long fingers trailing each spine as he browsed; his sharp defined jaw line with a rather attractive amount of stubble; and flawless pale skin, with that beautiful pink blush. The sun would be setting soon, and Harry wondered what the changing colours would do to that platinum hair, or his coin-grey eyes, or indeed… that perfect taught skin across his cheekbones.
There were a few chuckles at the table, from some of the students and teachers alike. Hagrid seemed to shift slightly with his hand in one of his pockets. Miss Adair and Miss Prescott, both looked equally embarrassed.
When the music stopped, they both scurried to find out the date and time. Mostly relieved that it was only the next day - albeit 8pm, they were still annoyed with the curse they were under. Before Harry could say anything, Draco had his eyebrows frowned in thought. Draco looked up at Harry - obviously confused, and innocently asked ...
Harry wanted to help Draco before he had a chance to snap on any more masks, and before Draco’s pain ebbed enough to bring him back to his senses.
Merlin, he sounded like a sap, but at least he’d tried. He could do no more now other than wait … and hope.
Climbing into bed a few minutes later, he almost knocked his magical parchment and quill onto the floor when he lifted the covers. He went to put it away safely, but he noticed the words were no longer his own - Tau had replied.
Harry almost jumped when words appeared on the parchment before him, nearly making him splatter up his coffee. He had been so lost in his thoughts that he hadn’t expected Tau to reply so soon.
Harry was smiling at him – the same smile that he craved to see, yet at the same time, it was a smile that he wished wasn’t aimed at him because it muddled his well-organised mind. Oh, right… the cracker… Should he? He really didn’t want to give Harry hope that there’d ever been something between them… Oh, but it was a just a bloody cracker! As long as he didn’t have to wear a stupid hat… he nodded.
“Harry?” Draco frowned. He was confused again; why did he feel so downcast and miserable? “What’s?” Draco shook his head. He remembered scratching at his arm, but he couldn’t remember why he had the sudden impulse to do so. It had been years since he’d tried to disfigure or removed the mark in such a way.
“You’ll be safe in bed, there nothing here that will hurt you. Come on!” Harry forced Draco to his feet, the blond grudgingly allowing it this time, but his eyes darting around as if he was about to be attacked by some wild beast or something. “That’s in,” Harry continued to encourage, “under the covers. You need to stay warm!”
Draco took most of it in his stride, as long as he had Harry he couldn't let them affect their relationship - they were adults, and they would be free of Hogwarts in six months. Harry on the other hand was getting pissed of, and the tipping point came that Saturday morning.
-Draco stands up with Harry still holding his left hand. He looks to find his child-self, and watches all the memories around him. His child-self appears in front of him.
Harry shook his head and decided to write to Tau again - he hadn’t checked to see if the man had responded to him yet. The though of Tau made him smile like a child in candy store – ridiculous! At least no one was around to see, and no one would know that the butterflies in his stomach swooped when he saw Tau’s reply. He was playing with fire, but the flames were deliciously addictive, and totally worth the risk of getting burnt.
-She points to the black armchair, which paints the room in Gryffindor colours, with green wall oddly enough.
There was a knock at his bedroom door, and he cautiously asked who it was. Blaise let himself in, and then slouched back onto Draco's bed like he slept there.
Harry swore he had sighs of relief from a some of the student, prefects and teachers as he jumped down from the chair. Filius even muttered, “Yes, good idea Mr Potter, very good, good thinking.” As he climbed down off the table.
Harry could see the way Draco stared at him, could almost see the wheels turning. If he was right, Draco had understood his words perfectly but was now at a crossroad between Padfoot and himself. Harry wanted to tell Draco who he was, but he felt the blond needed more time to realise his own feelings first. Harry however, knew that he was falling in love and that scared him because of who his heart was choosing. It was a comfort that they could spend so much time in each other’s company, but the real test would come later once Draco’s illusion of Padfoot had been destroyed. He just hoped that Draco would be happy that he was Padfoot, and not distraught over the revelation.
Harry had cared for him, been there through his illness, and oh how he hated him for that… for now he couldn’t deny that he was doomed – he just couldn’t imagine feeling this way for Padfoot. He could settle for the mystery man behind the words, and indeed, he did feel a great attraction to him, but he suspected that what he’d deprived himself of feeling thus far, was far too great to ever let go off; his heart may never let go of Harry bloody Potter, not now that it had tasted the forbidden fruit.
That was the other thing, Draco was using his surname more often again… but fuck! Why was he concerned about names when he was in his underwear in the bathroom brushing his teeth, and Draco had let himself into Harry’s private rooms?
Draco watched his students hurrying to board the train, and he even used a feather-light charm to help a few of the student with their trunks. When he was sure all the Slytherins were onboard, he turned to see how Harry was getting on with the Gryffindors… he was not expecting Harry to be pointing his wand at him with a blank expression on his face.
-Saturday 27th February: Muggle London with Ron, Harry, and Hermione. Cars, lights, electric, laptops, phones, skates, bikes, tv's, music, phones.
They also had to deal with students that didn't approve - or out right hated their relationship; screaming insults, throwing things, accusations thrown at Draco, throwing nasty spells at them - mainly Draco again, and Harry's friends sharing far to honest opinions. Even the teachers had this look.
“Don’t be -- sorry that is. I was just grading. What did you want to discuss?” Frowned Harry, watching as Draco lowered his coffee and taped the side of the mug with his ring index finger in thought. Harry sipped at his own coffee and waited.
Harry shivered; it was exactly the same as Draco bloody Malfoy. He was sure Draco was about five-foot-nine too, because Harry was Five-foot-eight and Draco was about an inch taller than him.
Harry: "Was ... Is ... *sighs and whispers* Please tell me your serious, that this wasn't just the curse and now you're having second-."
Draco sniffed the air again, that same pompous action that if Harry didn’t already know he was right it would have confirmed it. Of course, Draco didn’t even know that he did it and Harry wouldn’t tell him.
“Guess I broke the rules!” Harry winked, sending a whole knew type of shiver down Draco’s spine. “What are you going to do about it?”
This was the most open Tau had ever been with him, and it was both enlightening and intimate simultaneously. It was more personal than they had been before, and it let slip more of Tau’s life then was safe to do. Tau was taking risks, trusting him to some degree.
The potion vial was opalescent glass, tear shaped, and had a silver ring soldered onto it. It contained a potion, but it was hard to identify through the glass colouring. The lanyard was a beautiful soft leather, well made, and it had runes embossed into the fabric. Seeing as he was rubbish at runes, he had no idea what they were for. There was a clasp at the bottom of the lanyard, and a strange silver chain that joined it at the top. He looked up to question Draco, to see the man almost reverently running a finger over his new green, peacock quill with a frown.
Harry: "Don't play dumb with me Malfoy. I know you did something, and I bet it has to do with that radio you took."
That night in Draco's room - just climbed into bed, Harry couldn't understand why Draco never joined in with him when he played - or hung out with his friends. Draco would be there, but just watching like he couldn't understand. Harry never saw Draco have fun. Yes he laughed, and the kissing was nice, but he never saw Draco let everything go and be just Draco - no front, no masks, no bloody Malfoy decorum, just  himself.
Suddenly a puff of purple smoke rose from a cauldron over on the reception desk, and just like that, Malaise was holding parchment and reading over it while he tried to pull himself together.
“Thanks, but I’m saving room for dessert.” Harry declined politely, smiling with slight embarrassment – possibly because he’d been caught eating mostly meat again, and then only enough to fill a six-year-old – but he was a brave man… Draco would have taken the parsnips just to avoid the look Minerva was now sending Harry’s way. Yes, Minerva might be aging gracefully, but she was still a formidable woman … and not someone you denied if you could help it.
As for Draco, well, he had helped Harry out with Kaison’s gift as promised, but he hadn’t been spending as much time in Harry’s company. He stayed for maybe half an hour when he returned from Diagon Alley on Thursday – checking that Harry was reassured in his ability to buy gifts for a baby, and yesterday they’d had coffee half an hour before attending the Great Hall for dinner together. After dinner, Draco had gone back to his own rooms, only to spend the rest of the evening writing to Padfoot.
The two of them just laughed until the humor finally abated, chuckling for a while after. Harry couldn’t imagine what he would have done if a teenage girl of about seventeen had walked into a store he owned, and asked for a book on sex. Right now, however, he was floating in the radiance that Draco was giving off. Harry had never seen him so carefree and … happy. He looked radiant and … gorgeous.
Harry could relate to having a lot of work to do, but his day wasn’t too stressful in hindsight. His run in … well, fly in? With Malfoy was just annoying and distracting. He hadn’t received a reply from Malfoy yet, and Lilsiv had most likely flown to the owlery so she could catch her own food tonight with the other owls.
The 3rd of January couldn't have come fast enough for Harry. Draco had spent two nights at his house - and they had been an amazing three days, but Harry had to get back to the Burrow, and Draco had to get back to Hogwarts. They had parted ways with the plan to meet on the train to Hogwarts- in the storage carriage at twelve o'clock, but in the meantime they had their enchanted parchment to communicate.
Watching Harry at dinner from across the Hall. Draco is pulling at his bottom lip with his teeth, running his tongue across them, and remembering what Harry's lips taste like. Blaise and Pansy are watching him.
“He could be you know!” Harry insisted, looking at the many carved wooden bowls and boxes on one of the stalls in Covert Gardens.
Then he remembered, Draco also had Mr Silas Avery for the boys third detention tonight as well. The boy had detention every night for the next three weeks, and Draco was going to be assigning the boy work that made him think about his beliefs and morals. It was what they had planned, to make him question everything he thought he knew. Draco had also decided to quiz the boy on the history of both wizarding wars regarding Tom Riddle, to see what Silas
Harry slowly went and took a seat – another sting of hurt jabbed at him from the lack of hospitality; no offer of tea or coffee, no pleasantries or general greetings. Harry
That was almost screaming at Harry, playing with his annoying need to help others, but it also resounded with his own lack of experience in love. The quote was intriguing, and his passion of nature and aesthetics sounded peaceful - a life Harry certainly needed after the tempest rage of his own past. What sealed the deal however, was the last question: What do you want the person reading this to know? The thirty-year-old blond had answered:
“Like what?” he asked, voice strangled. “Like I know how it feels to be treated like shit because of who my parents were? Like I spent eleven years thinking I was a piece of trash because my aunt and uncle wanted nothing to do with me and I was this stain on their carpet, this bug they couldn’t squash? Like I should be grateful I wasn’t turned out onto the street?”
“I didn’t say she was happy about it.” Kingsley studied him, a crease forming in his brow. He was looking at Harry like he could see something just beneath the surface, as if Harry was so transparent. “Did you mean to kill Goyle?”
It must have taken his patronus some time to get to its intended recipient, but it felt like one second Harry closed his eyes, and the next a loud crack broke the silence.
Bill looked up at him sharply, eyes red and skin pale under his freckles and scars. “You didn’t do this to yourself. You have nothing to be sorry for.” It looked like he was forcing himself to calm down. He grimaced. “Merlin’s pants, Harry. Apologizing for getting attacked. Only you…” He exhaled and straightened up. “But I do need to know what happened.”
Harry closed his mouth where it’d been hanging open. His arms shook and a headache began to thrum behind his eyes, but he’d done it. He’d done
“Of course.” The creak of wood and the sound of footsteps announced their departure from the kitchen. “Are you sure you don’t want to stay for dinner? You could talk to him yourself.”
Malfoy stood there, staring at him, wand loosely clutched in his upraised left hand like he was about to offer it back to Harry. His expression flickered—anger and frustration giving way to that same distant, reaching emptiness he had seen in the Great Hall. Sympathy ripped through Harry as he realized just how thin Malfoy’s veneer of anger was. Harry knew, in the tight crease of his forehead, the slight tremble in his chin—Malfoy didn’t know what he was doing either.
Harry extracted a piece of his hair from Teddy’s mouth, more as something to do than an actual deterrent. If the kid wanted to eat his hair, he was going to eat his hair. And it wasn’t like Harry couldn’t stand to lose a few inches anyway.
It should worry him, right? That he couldn’t even picture himself doing something so mundane as watching a quidditch game anymore? That the very idea felt like it couldn’t, shouldn’t, belong to him?
He answered her questions along with a few from the other members of the Wizengamot—simple, really, nothing he hadn’t already answered more than once with Robards, Kamau, and Proulx. Only the first and last were present in the room, Robards sitting to his far right at the edge of the curved benches, while Proulx was top left. Throughout, Harry managed to keep his voice level, his answers short and simple. He didn’t rise to the condescending remarks from Yeats, tame enough to ignore for now. He didn’t shout at anyone. All in all, he thought he was doing a great job, all things considered. He couldn’t help but feel like Umbridge was going to walk in here with her tinkling laugh and her cold, dead eyes, trailing a dementor in her wake.
A flash of silver silenced him. A sick, wet thud following soon after. A dark shape dropped to the ground before Neville’s feet.
“Mr. Potter,” the white-haired man said in his gravelly voice. “It’s a pleasure. Gawain Robards, Head of the Auror office.”
A gasp surged through the room. Kingsley controlled his expression right away, but Harry saw the alarm in his eyes. He saw the opening and he went for blood.
Ron, who wasn’t a broken shell of a thing who was only alive because his soul had been mangled so much it no longer obeyed the rules of normal magic.
Harry didn’t feel weaker, though. It was more like—he could sense that something inside the box had been waiting for someone to open it. For someone to offer.
“It shouldn’t have been done in the first place!” He rubbed a hand over his chin, trying to control his anger. He lowered his voice. “Why would I think they’d react any differently than they have in the past? Why would I be that naive? And bugger their respect, I don’t want it if they’re willing to do this.”
Harry got up and moved before he could think better, brushing Hermione off with a whispered, “I’m fine, it’s nothing.” He walked amongst the groups of people clustered together, silently pleading with everyone to stop looking at him for five minutes. He lost hope of that right away. On his own amidst a sea of people who kept thanking him, watching him with hope and relief, piling all their grief on top of him, he wanted to shove it off and disappear. He regretted leaving his invisibility cloak back with the Weasleys and looked around for Luna, desperate for her to cause another distraction for him. But he had started this. He wasn’t going to stop now, not when he didn’t know if he would be able to do it again.
