"Yes I awoke as a Fae around the time of the Second Task last year," Luna said dreamily. "Which lead to some interesting abilities. Would you like to know what the Merpeople really thought about you during the Second Task and not just what the Headmaster said?"
"Would they affect me?" Harry asked having not come across any mention of love potions in regards to Alpha and Omegas in the books he had looked at yesterday morning.
Harry then asked Bonecrusher to cancel all the illegal Marriage Contracts that had been filed for him before he finally let himself be led to his Cleansing. As Harry was getting Cleansed, Draco waited in the Halls of Healing for his return, not letting the Goblin Healers treat him knowing they were going to St. Mungos next and figuring his mom would want to handle it herself. Lucius meanwhile had headed out after having one of his House Elves deliver the book list for First-Year students that were submitted to the Board so he could buy Harry all the books he was missing for his classes seeing it as a way to start his role of Godfather to the young boy. Sure he had been friends with James due to their families being allied and the pair of them had helped each other meet their wives, but he had never guessed that James would have made him Harry's Godfather. Lucius assumed it was mentioned in James and Lily's Will and he had not been contacted due to the Will being blocked from being read.
"Well when you never respond to our letters and then stop coming to the Bank itself letting others into your vaults it made us rather nervous," the Goblin said as he resumed his seat and gestured for Harry to take the seat before him leaving Draco to take the only other chair as his parents created their own.
"Proving he was right and I was wrong," Draco said as his Godfather raised a questioning eyebrow at him. "Well before you came in we were discussing his Animagus form that was given in his results and it seemed when you scared him he shifted form, and is currently hiding," Draco said his instincts not letting him tell the other where exactly even if it was to one of Harridan's parents.
At lunch, Harrison took a seat next to Hermione and spent the meal talking with her doing his best to ignore Ron sitting on his other side and Ginny sitting across from him giving him what he assumed were flirtatious looks. With classes being done, Harrison decided to ask Hermione about her self realizing he did not really know much about her apart from her love of books and near-perfect memory. She seemed pleased as she answered his questions. Thus he was able to hear about her first bit of accidental magic had come from a group of bullies playing keep-away with one of her books and one of them nearly tossing it into a giant mud puddle. Her parents working together in a dentist's office with her dad being her mother's hygienist, and both their jobs allowing the family to go on vacations out of the country each year. Harrison also learned much to his surprise that Hermione was not an only child like he had thought but had an old sister named Elizabeth age 16, and a younger brother Al age eleven. She was just the only one of them who had the talent for magic. Hearing about her siblings and thinking of Dudley, Harrison asked her if either of them bullied her for having magic when they did not. She laughed and put his mind at ease telling him that neither of her siblings had treated her any different after learning she could do magic. Not that she hung out with them, she told him, for her sister was more of a preppy girl who cared more about fashion than studying, while her brother was more focused on learning to play the trumpet with dreams of being in a jazz band. Harrison was so fascinated by the stories she told him he had not even realized that the majority of the people in the hall had left after lunch had been over.
Meanwhile, back at Hogwarts, Draco felt a sharp pain in his chest but had not passed out from it like Harry had as he left the Matron's office. He barely registered the fact that Madam Pomfrey was nowhere in sight for with each step the pain in his chest grew. He had about reached the door to the main castle when they were flung open and his father, alongside Lord Vansel, who Draco knew was the head of the Hogwart's School Board of Governors entered the room arguing with Dumbledore. "I do not see any reason you had needed to fire Poppy," Dumbledore was saying as none of the men noticed Draco in the room.
Harry's Magical Coma and waking up
"Well, then I thank you Price Bonecrusher for the use of time magic to make this all so much smoother," Lucius said not wanting to inform them about Albus's letter to him or think about the number of letters he would have got if they had waited the nine hours plus for the procedure to take place in real-time.
Seeing shadow come from the underbrush and lower its head to the unicorn's neck to drink from the wound Draco could not help but let out a terrified scream. Turning on his heel Draco took off after Fang. "What the hell was that Potter?" Draco asked turning from the great boarhound retreating backside to look at Potter, only to see that the other boy was not there. "Oh hell, don't tell me," Draco said casting a look over his shoulder expecting to see the Gryffindor trying to battle against the shadow. Once more the blonde found himself to be mistaken as he sees Harry curled up before the approaching shadowy figure, his hands clutching his head as if in pain. While Draco hated that Harry had spurned his friendship in favor of the Blood Traitor Weasely, he could not let the shadow reach the B0y-Who-Lived. "Alright Draco, it is no big deal just some random dark shadow who had killed a Unicorn and is about to reach Potter," Draco said trying to psych himself up. "Probably going to die or get hurt, assuredly get dirty, but people will know I did it to save Potter after he was abandoned by that bloody groundskeeper."
"Ah yes, I wanted to discuss the gossip that is going around that young Susan is Hufflepuffs Heir. I think it would be for the greater good if she allowed me to be her proxy for both the school board but also in the Wizengamot," Dumbledore said giving the pair of women his best Grandfatherly smile.
"Now see that is why you have such trouble in potions, while many the core classes can be helped along with supplemental readings Potions is different. In the pre-lessons for students who were not from magical families, they would have taught you how to cut and prepare ingredients properly. It is quite impressive that you have never melted a cauldron yet, even more so when you take into account some of the help you got," Draco said blushing a little and rubbing the back of his neck.
When Ron, Fred, and George do not free Harry from the Dursleys, Harry is trapped until his Hogwarts letter arrives.
"You could to I am sure the Potter line has more properties than just the one you are using now," Draco said in a supportive tone.
The morning after Lucius took over as Proxy for Prewet, Lupin, Weasley, and Ravenclaw the readers of the Prophet were greeted by some surprising news about the Governing Body of Magical Brittian. The Headmaster who had taken a drink of some lemon tea before he unrolled the magical paper was seen spitting the drink out a moment later as he read the headline and he did not even do anything to clean up as he read the article in question.
"Ay, it was that," Hagrid stated, "and most Magicals are taught it once they reach the age of adulthood, student or no to send quick short distance messages or messages they do not want others to be able to intercept. And finding Quirrell like this I think that is needed now." Draco was a little surprised to hear the man not sounding so wild anymore.
"I think you are right Minerva we can not let this Duel slide so I shall take over as the mediator," Dumbles said surprising his staff while raising some red flags for Harridan and his friends. "We shall have the Duel take place this weekend in the old Dueling room," the man said before raising his voice "and everyone is invited to attend.
"I understand perfectly Mister Goblin," Charity said making the Goblin give her a small nod of approval.
"What about Ron and the other Weasleys?" Harry asked.
"Weird," Harry said shaking his head.
"Was I the one whose Magic was messing with the wards?" she asked a hint of worry in her voice as she took her seat.
"As Dad and Lupin, well Papa I guess," George said after a moment of thought "did a test and cleansing after we wrote to them it was just us and our brothers taking the test."
"I am afraid you passed out on the trip back up so we brought you to our Halls of Healing. As standard procedure due to your passing out our Healers ran a checkup on you and found some troubling news," the goblin said passing over a roll of parchment to him. "Now I have been told that most of these had been cleansed but also your Account Manager has undertaken some measures to further protect you. I think it would be wise to look over your documents so you can ask any questions about them when Master Bonecrusher comes to see you in a bit."
"May I inquire why you came with Heir Potter to the bank today, by the way?" the Goblin asked,
Harry meets Draco's family and has a discussion on the basis of Good vs. Evil.
"Well, Mr. Malfoy was it Professor Quirrell who had been hurting the Unicorns?" the Headmaster asked as he and the four Heads of House turning to him.
"Draco?" Harry asked.
"What?" Susan asked confused
"Is anyone?" Draco asked back.
Also around this time, Snape was informed that due to him in his position of Stewart for the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black was responsible for the recapture of Sirius he the reward had been added to his accounts. Severus had the money placed in his son's Vaults to add to the money that the Goblins had already returned to him that the man had stolen from him. The twins were also informed that thanks to their suggestion to go to Gringotts Arthur had found out that he had been under numerous enchantments from Molly as well as finally fully claiming both his Lordship and Consort rings for both Weasley line and Lupin line respectfully. It seems that Molly had some spell making him forget he was the Lord of the most Devious and Magical House Weasley leading her to take great sums of money from the vaults of the House. Remus and Arthur stated that they were currently working with the Lupin-Weasley Account manager, Sabersnake, into actions to take on the witch. The pair of reunited mates also congratulated the boys not only for finding someone but for bringing the truth to their attention.
"Tap the asterisk with your wand," the Goblin said, "it might reveal the information." Doing as the Goblin said Harrison took out his wand and tapped the asterisk beside his mother's listed as his Bearer. Instantly a small bit of text appeared on the scroll. According to the newly added test his Great-Grandmother, Hepzibah Smith, after she had died under mysterious circumstances had led to some infighting among his family which unfortunately ended up with most of them dying leaving his mother, the sole survivor, orphaned at the age of three. His mother was soon adopted by the Evens family and due to her young age had not even known about coming from a Magical family until she and James had registered their marriage.
"I have a proposition for you," Draco said making Harry smile a little for that was in the blonde's normal character.
"What's that the only guardians I had were the Dursleys and they would have nothing to do with magic," Harry said his curiosity getting the better of him as he lets his wings unwind a little from around him.
"A resort?" Harridan asked confused.
"Any Omega would do, so it is just a random chance of me slipping into your bed for you to help me," Harry said as he began to pull himself away.
"Why have your parent's not told you?" Draco asked a little worried.
"Yes it was just the two of us neither his fool nor the dungs," Harridan said making Draco laugh at the name of the former Weasleys from the nickname of their real birth father.
"Did you now?  Have you told anyone of this yet?" she asked.
Petunia suddenly recalled being brought along with her sister when they would get Lily's school supplies and going to the Magical Bank to find Goblins. "Very well," she said, "we will just have to put a mortgage on our home dear and pay it back quickly." The three Dursleys missed a look shared by the two Gringotts workers at the woman's suggestion knowing that plan was doomed to failure but neither Bill nor his boss, Devin, wanted to bring it up.
Looking around to make sure no one was within earshot Harry quickly said, "I think I started to go through the change for some reason."
"Not yet sorry Draco," Harry said and found he meant it as he snuggled into the blonde's chest.
"Well, there would be the House Elves attached to your family.  Me if you would have me.  But if you wand some adults around I am sure I could get in contact with one of my Aunts to come over every once and while or we could invite my Uncle and his daughter," Draco said thinking about his Aunt Andy or Uncle Xeno who unlike his Father were not supporters of the Dark Lord.
Harry like all students at Hogwarts during his first week of classes, back in their First Year, had been told about the small percent of the population that between the ages of fourteen and fifteen would become an Alpha or Omega. As the lesson taught by Professor McGonagall, as head of his House, she told them all that a person would gain a secondary gender only if they were from a Pureblood line meaning Harry had thought he would not have to deal with it, other than seeing it happen to his classmates in years to come.
"Of course I do for it had to be something to cause you to utterly lose your normal apathetic nature," Harry said.
"Oh Neitherworld's Great Arch," Mr. Malfoy said. "I don't know what is worst that the person who was sent to help you get your supplies was the Groundkeeper or the fact that you are missing almost half your books for your classes. Can you tell me who you had been living with Heir Potter?"
Harrison's eyes goggled at the results of the test though wondering about all the asterisks beside some articles. They made him think of some of his old Muggle textbooks which marked an item from having a footnote but there was no further explanation on the page. He was also shocked to see that somehow his mother was part of the Hufflepuff line and he somehow owned three-fourths of Hogwarts. "I don't get it how is can my mom be connected to Hufflepuff I thought she was a Muggleborn?" he asked looking up at the Goblin on the other side of the desk.
"I don't know," Draco admitted.
"If I'm correct it is a spell known as a Patronus. The spell has two uses to push back dark creatures known as Dementors, but it can also be used to send messages to others," Draco explained.
Harry's mouth fell open in shock for a moment before he decided to tackle one of those issues for the moment.  "That is the third time today I have either heard or read about an Account Manager what is it?" he asked.
"You really don't want to know," Draco said still not looking at him.
"In there Professor," Harry said pointing to the door to his old bedroom/cupboard. Seeing another group of padlocks on the door Charity did not use her magic to unlock them but blasted them apart before having Harry pull them out not wanting to take her eyes off the boy's abusive family. Once Harry had all his supplies out of the room she shrunk them and placed them in her pocket before leading Harry to the door to the backyard. There they were joined by Bathsheda Charity gently took hold of Harry's upper arm and looking out of there using Side-Along Apparition. Rather than head back to Hogwarts or taking Harry to get his school supplies Charity took him right to the Ministry to explain to them why she had not only collected Harry but why she used Magic to do so.
Harry is informed of what has been done to him as he is given two test and their results.
Severus was on the warpath when he headed to the weekly meeting among the Heads of House. After Potter had revealed to him that he had not gotten one of the preparatory books for his class he had asked every single class only to find out apart from Draco no other student had the book. While most students who had come from Pureblood homes this was not an issue, for Halfbloods there was a chance they had not learned anything about potions before coming to the castle. For a Muggleborn or Muggleraised, they would have had no hope in his class. This fact alone made it quite remarkable that there were more melted cauldrons in his class. In fact, out of the majority of issues from all of his classes came from Neville Longbottom who was a Pureblood. Though that could also be due to the boy's fear of him thanks to him bullying the boy under Albus's orders.
"I am aware of that rule, but I think we can make have an exception this time," Mr. Malfoy said.
"What are they?" Draco said knowing that his mother must have had a reason to add them to the list.
"Okay sure I did not like the fact that you chose Weasley over me during our first train ride, but I could not hate you I was envious of you," Draco stated.
"Can we meet again later? So I can give you back your cloak you know," Harry said with a slight blush.
Harrison only became aware of it when Ron poked his shoulder to get his attention asking to ride Harrison's Firebolt since it was the last day before they headed home. "I think it would be a better idea if we spent the time packing Ron," Harrison said seeing Hermione give an approving nod.
"Unless you wish to skip breakfast I would suggest you pick this up later. I would suggest you go for if you had recently gone through the change your body will need it," she suggested.
on it.
"Very well motion passes," Minerva said after a moment. She took so long that Severus wondered if due to how much she was into Albus's camp she was aware of what Granger had been doing to Potter's homework and was trying to think of a way out of it.
But when he started to turn it into a rant reminiscent of Hermione, Harry knew he had to do something to break him off it lest they be out past curfew. It did not take Harry long to figure out what to do as he watched Draco speak with such passion and a fire seeming to burn in his normal board-looking eyes. Harry could almost see the blonde as a general trying to booster his troops' morale as Draco began to pace back and forth going into other problems he thought were happening at the school. Harry could not take it anymore as he stood up and blocked Draco's path causing the blonde to stop pacing but still kept talking. Harry licked his lips as he went from broke hoping it would end the diatribe as he moved closer to the blonde standing on his tiptoes and captured Draco's lips in a kiss. That shut Draco up whose eyes widen in shock from the unexpected kiss as he gently wrapped his arms around Harry's waist.
"I will speak to you however I like when you disregard Hogwarts rules and regulations. While you may be the Headmaster that does not mean you are above the rules. Now, what did you want with Susan?" Pomona asked him as Susan took one of the seats before the Headmaster's desk while the Herbology Professor stood behind her with a hand on her shoulder.
"Wow," both Harry and Charity said at the same time,
Draco jumped a little as the door to the office that had until that morning had belonged to Madam Pomfrey crashed open and his mother entered the room. "Mom?" he asked.
"True going through a change does not automatically make one know how to Apparate," Draco said putting emphases on the last word.  "But if say you had known the location of the Slytherin dorms you, of all people, could have gotten in."
"Ah Lord Malfoy what can we do for you today?" the Goblin asked giving a crooked smile at Draco's dad.
After Lucius had purchased all of the missing books for Harry he headed to the Owl Post to send a message to the Head of the Hogwarts School Board to let her know about Madam Pomfrey's failure at her job, but also the fact that the Medi-Witch, Albus, and Severus were taking money from Harry's vaults. Lucius knew the Goblins would stop the transfer of funds and try to get them back for Harry but he also wanted the Board to look into the matter themselves. Before he headed back to the bank Lucius received an angry letter from Albus for taking Harry out of school. Lucius after reading the letter just ripped it up and sent the owl back without a reply being too angry at what the man had done to Harry he did not want to lay into the old bastard.
"He may be young but I know he has one due to Harry's results," Lucius said.
"Well, after being called to the edge of the forest last night I was more focused on Mr. Potter who was in a magical coma than your son faking a hurt leg," Madam Pomfrey said placing her hands on her hips and glaring at Draco's father.
Unable to help himself Harry laid down on the pedestal as he let the cloak fall back into place and snuggled up against the body pillow. He found the thing was quite warm as he buried his face into it as he wrapped his arms around it and felt parts of the pillow wrap around him as well. With a content sigh, Harry snuggled tight with the pillow as his dream fell away to nothing but feelings of love, joy, family, and being protected.
Harridan had been surprised when Susan came up to talk to him after his first-class with the now cleansed Binns asking to talk to him. Having a free period Harridan just shrugged and followed her to an empty classroom. "What's up Susan?" he asked.
"A meeting that involves Harry," she said and he knew her well enough not to ask how she concluded.
"Are you all right, Harry?" Hermione said seeing the blush and placing a hand to his forehead thinking he was coming down with something.
"One is a sea cottage that at the moment is uninhabited while the others have people living in them at the moment including Lily's sister and her family while the other one is the Black Ancestral home," Bonecrusher said making Severus grit his teeth in anger as even without having the memory spells out of him recalling how bad of a person Petunia Evens was and had a feeling her family was just as bad. Also, the Black Ancestral home which Severus knew was where Albus had set up the Order made his choice rather easy.
"What do you want? Whatever your selling I am not buying," a large beefy man said answering the door.
Reaching his room Draco closed and Warded the door before taking a running leap onto his bed and hugging his body pillow to his chest and rolling around for a bit. After about fifteen minutes he had finally calmed down enough to do something productive. Sliding off his bed he went to his writing desk to start a letter to Neville to share the good news. As the pair of them had not been allies at the start of the year, they had both found out that they shared the same goal during that blasted detention in the forest. Afterward, the pair had laughed about it a lot having wanted to protect Harrison from the blood traitor Ron and the Muggle Pretender Granger. If it had not been for Neville, Draco would never have realized Granger was not a Muggle she passed herself off as. As the pair had searched for the unicorn in the forest Neville had told that from what he had seen the girl played ignorant of the Magical World so that she and Ron could control when and what Harrison learned. Neville had first come to suspect Granger was not a Muggle when he noticed the girl do both her homework, but also "helping" Harrison with his that she had not had any problems using a quill. Nor did she seemed to have the Muggleborn prep book that taught those brought up in the Muggle World how to use quills. Neville had seen that Dean, Harrison, Lavender, and Lily Moon the four Muggleborn or at least raised had trouble using a quill but not Granger.
"Now I am sure you are mistaken Mr. Malfoy," Albus said cursing himself a little at not thinking this through.
"So that was the Monster," Draco said his voice shaking a little.
"Not a chance," Draco said as he shakingly pointed his wand at the Shadow.
"Just hold up your wand and state that you reclaim your properties and that everyone who has not been approved of is to leave at once. This will cause a message to be delivered to everyone in said properties with a time limit that you decided upon from one minute all the way up to two hours," Bonecrusher explained. Harridan did just that given all the people who betrayed him thirty minutes to get out of his properties before letting Bonecrusher know to put new Wards and spells in place, on Draco's suggestion, so they could not reclaim them. He had for the moment let the Twins, their older brothers, Remus, and Mr. Weasley permission to stay under the provisions that they not let the others back in or take anything from the homes that did not belong to them.
Any further discussion came to a close as the last of the classmates arrived and Kingsley started their D.A.D.A class. Just like their first class with the man the students enjoyed the class as he decided to teach them a spell that was meant for the Sixth Year. For once Harridan did not really need to do anything as his classmates were all taught to cast a Patronus. No one even asked why he was just sitting around offering hints to Draco, Pansy, Blaise, Theo, and Neville rather than cast the spell. Only asked to do it after one of his classmates had managed to cast the spell, though only managing the mist form and not corporeal did Auror Shacklebolt ask him to cast the spell. Picking up his wand and looking over at Draco he could not help but smile as he cast the spell. To his slight shock, the form was no longer the four-point buck but a small bird that fluttered around the room and landed on Draco's shoulder. "It changed," Harridan said trying to not shiver as Draco ran a finger over the Patronus on his shoulder and he actually felt it.
"I am telling the truth my Blue Jay I can not lie to you unless I am doing it to protect you my Veela will not allow it," Draco said
Since Harry, while having just woken up from a Magical Coma, was able to travel easily on his own Draco was helped along by his dad as they headed to the appropriate office for Harry to get his test. Unknown to Harry was that one of the reasons for the path they were given was for specialized Wards and Detection Spells in the bank to read his magic so it could notify any Goblins which managed his family accounts. The Potter Family Account Manager, Bonecrusher, was rather pleased that the Heir of the Potter line had shown back up at the bank having wished to speak to him since his first visit, but had found Harry and Hagrid had already left the bank. Bonecrusher had then tried to send owls to the boy which contained letters with Portkey Charms attached but each letter had been returned unopened or even touched. He suspected that someone attached a Mail Ward on his young client, most likely due to how famous the human was to the other humans in Brittian. Unfortunately, the Ward was also preventing him from getting in touch with the Potter Heir so he could not even change the Ward to accept letters from the bank itself. With the boy being at the bank Bonecrusher would finally be able to shift the Wards so he could reach his client in case there were some problems with the funds being transferred from his vaults.
*1 In this story a Mirror Twin would be considered a Switch since they would have the same mate who could either be a Dominant or Submissive.
"Leave now boy and you can stay alive," the unseen speaker hissed.
"Alright, I can understand that," Severus said with a sad but knowing smile. "When you see him let him know that I am aware that just because we have both lost the Potions making us hate each other I do not expect him to see me as a parent yet knowing there is too much history between us, but I would at least try to make a start." Having said his piece Severus turned to leave only to hear a small "mew" that drew his gaze back to his Godson. Within the blonde's arms peeking out over a fold in his robes there was a small kitten looking at him. Understanding that this was Harridan, Severus gave him a slight bow before he left the room.
"Does that mean that when I am free of the bed I will have to go the bathroom like Tom Hank's character does from A League of Their Own?" Harry asked.
"It is a Muggle expression that basically means we will just go along with everything and see what happens," Harry said.
"Sorry, I am Professor Charity Burbage and I teach the class on Muggle Studies. Now your note mentioned that your school supplies had been locked up as well," Charity said smiling down at the too-small boy.
"Salutations Luna," Draco responded.
"Well, what else would you call a day when you find out your name, that is if you are going to go with it?" Luna clarified.
"Oh hey Pans what's up?" Draco asked as if she had not just found him with Harry Bloody Potter curled up in his lap.
"Also point," Harry said as he also recalled Snapes's discussion last night about the form a person's Patronus would take and how Draco's had resembled Hedwig.
"Oh Neitherworld's Great Arch," Mr. Malfoy said. "I don't know what is worst that the person who was sent to help you get your supplies was the Groundkeeper or the fact that you are missing almost half your books for your classes. Can you tell me who you had been living with Heir Potter?"
At the appointed time for the Duel to start Dumbles stepped forward to stand in the middle of the platform. "We will now start the Duel between Fredrick and George Weasley and Ronald and Ginevra Weasley," he started to say but was screamed down forcing Professor McGonagall to give their true names before the man continued, which lead the Deputy Headmistress to keep an eye on him during the Duel to make sure he did not try to interfere with it. "The conditions of this Duel is simple if Fredrick and George win Ronald and Ginevra must acknowledge that they are not related to Fredrick and George as well as leaving them alone. However, if Ronald and Ginevra win Fredrick must use his position as Heir to bring the pair back into the Weasley line which they were so unjustly removed from," the man said trying to garner sympathy for the two younger redheads. Not that anyone gave them any, though a few students from the older family lines started to smile at hearing the terms of the Duel. Harridan waited until the Duel started with a spell cast almost before the event began, from Ron in the form of a
"Oh, that is just my cousin Luna. She is... fine," Draco said a little hesitation in his voice.
Having claimed all three Heir Rings and two Lordship Rings Harrison, and the two professors were passed over a list of properties that Harrison had control over. Noticing that some properties were writing in different colors he looked up at Bonecrusher and asked, "Why are some properties listed in black, while others are in red, yellow, or gray?"
"I thought we going to St. Mungos to see mom," Draco said standing a little bit in front of them.
"And do what I don't have anywhere else to go. No other family.  Nothing," Harry said.
"No she is not," Ginny said.
Harry wisely did not share this letter with Draco when he got back, feeling a little anger at his friend who unknowingly described what had happened to him when he had faced off against Voldemort, not Draco who had shown himself to be a here. When Harry asked what had happened since the woman had not been wearing the light-colored Robes Harry now associated with the Healers and Medi-Magicals that worked for St. Mungos. Draco explained that the woman was Madam Bones who was the head of the Ministry of Magic's Law Enforcement Offices who had wanted Draco's memory of his encounter with You-Know-Who in the forest. What Draco did not share is that he also gave a memory of Dumbledore stunning the Head of Hogwarts's Board of Governors, his father, and him at Hogwarts. As well as the memory of seeing that his father had been enchanted by the Headmaster. The only reason Draco had shared these memories was due to his father being there prompting him to do so. Draco was also told that to keep up the idea that he was still enchanted he would be unable to visit Draco or Harry again during the rest of their time at the hospital. Lucius had given his son a tight hug before he left with Madam Bones to discuss the case he was making against the man for what he had done to Harry and tried to do to him and his son.
Meanwhile, down in their Mated dorms Fred and George snuggled up closer to Blaise who smiled in his sleep feeling the Weasley family magic wash over him and accepting him for courting the twins.
Harry almost told Professor Dumbledore about going through the change but he had focused on Harry's adventure with the Time-Turner and saving his Godfather and Buckbeak the night before. Which only gave Harry more to think about, so that by the time he remembered to talk to the Headmaster about the change the man had already left. Having nothing for it Harry returned to the library. Unfortunately, Madam Pince informed him that when he had been gone someone else had requested the books so she had to pass them on. With a small huff, Harry left the room wondering what he should do for the rest of the day, or for that matter the next couple of days before term ended only to stop in place as he smelled a scent similar to the one he had gotten from Sirius. Looking around he tried to locate the source of the scent but by now the library was rather full so he had been unable to find who it was coming off of. That is unless he wanted to go sniff at every male in the general vicinity to see if the scent had come from them, which of course he had no desire to do.
"Can I get all this money and stuff back?" Harry asked Bonecrusher rather than answer her.
"He does not," Lucius said making Harry start as he had been only focusing on Draco and his wings he had forgotten that anyone else was in the room.
"Wait? What?" Charity asked standing up and bending over the table with her hands pressed hard onto the surface to help ground herself.
This story idea came from a discussion I had with a co-worker about doing a random activity while still being technically asleep.  Thinking it would be interesting if Harry had somehow managed to sleepwalk down to the Slytherin Dorms and ended up in Draco's bed.  The only reason I could see Harry's body doing so as if he had somehow become an Omega that recognized Draco as a possible Alpha and well here you go.
"Oh, we could never do that Master Potter it would be too rude," the first Elf said who had still not given their name yet.
"Because I wanted to go to the ball with you," Harry said looking up and almost making Draco take a step back as he saw Harry glance up at him with those Avada Green eyes past his dark black bangs.
Harry's POV
A Muggle that was passing gave them all a stranger looks before she caught sight of Sirius and gave a loud scream which brought over a couple of Muggle cops running. Seeing one of the most wanted men in England seem to startle the cops for a moment before they approached Black saying something that the twins could not hear and pull out what looked like the Muggle version of magic dampening cuffs. The rest of the Order members were backing up not wanting to get caught with Sirius as more Muggles began to gather one pulling out a strange item and holding it to the side of their face.
Harrison saw a big difference between the two Elves and Dobby right away for rather than pillowcases one was dressed in a small pink suit while the other was in a white and orange skirt as well as a red and gold tee-shirt. "Um, hello," he said feeling a little awkward due to their staring.
"How?" Harry asked working through his shock that his Mom had been his friend.
Harridan also found he was not the only one moving into a Slytherin Mated Dorm as he noticed Fred and George blushing a little as they took the room right next to his and Draco's as Blaise had welcomed them. Since the Mated Dorms were connected to each other via a Common Room-ish chamber Harridan asked how the three of them came together. George, who was leaning against Blaise, told how during their first meeting over the summer during the scavenger hunt at the Manor he and Blaise had hit it off quite well. Fred picked up the story, leaning against Blaise's other side, telling how when they helped the dominant Incubus to contact Bill in hints on to become a Curse Breaker there bond had started to grow a little. "But it was not until the train ride that the bond fully developed after I had playfully struck Blaise on his back," George said.
"Yeah but unlike everyone else, I did not swoon over every little thing you did for good or ill," Draco stated.
Having seen that both Godric and Fleamont were good at Potions, he began to flip to the front page for all the family members listed in the book to see what fields of study each member of his family had gone into. Harry, or maybe he should go by Harrison now, was rather amazed to see that almost every single person had Potions as a specialty making him wonder why he sucked at the subject. From what he had heard about his mom she had also been good at most subjects taught at Hogwarts, with only History of Magic giving her a grade lower than an EE. Maybe he should ask Draco about Potions due to the Blonde's Alpha's skill in the class to see if he could spot where he was going wrong in the subject. Flipping to the next member of the family his eyes flew open finding the name Harrison Potter. The information being near the back of the book made Harrison think this was the person he was named for. Seeing that like the rest listed in the book Harrison was a Potions Master and had played a part in helping develop the Wolfsbane Potion, Shrinking Solution, and the Animagus Revealing Potion. Harrison was listed as having two sons Flemont and his younger brother Charlus Potter. He flipped ahead to check out Charlus's Potter to see if he had any living Magical relatives and saw that Charlus married a Dorean Black and was said to have one son which unfortunately died young.
"I guess there is that, and from what my mom and Professor Snape had shared of their time at school it has only gotten worse. There is not much inter-house unity that is spread through all four Houses." Harry gave him a confused look prompting Draco to explain,' When they were at school my mom was in Ravenclaw, Professor Snape was in Slytherin, and they were friends not only with each other but your mom, who was in Gryffindor, as well as a Hufflepuff girl. Yet it would seem strange to see a Gryffindor and Slytherin being friends at all, and while Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff are more common they still have issues staying together. Professor Snape thinks it is due to the administration having the most dangerous and contested classes be made up of those two mixes." Draco then went on to explain how during their parents' day Slytherin would share D.A.D.A. with Gryffindor but Potions with Ravenclaw which were the two such contested classes. As the blonde started going into his opinions on the matter Harry could only chuckle to himself, having never seen Draco act so passionately about anything besides Potions and Quidditch before.
," Blaise said in a slow voice making sure to enunciate every word hoping it would get it through the pair of redheaded pest heads.
"Ah yes sorry about that," Lucius said collecting himself as he straightened his robes. "The name Lord Voldemort is a lie that Tom came up with to hid what he was really doing from the likes of Albus."
"It would not be a bother I would not want even the Weasel to be forced to wear those," Draco said unable to finish his statement as he shuddered to make Harridan laugh as he snuggled into his side. The pair laid there to snuggle up together until some owls flew into the window to drop off the invitations to their gathering. Harridan read his letters happy to see that the three he invited had agreed to shop up letting out a laugh as he read what had happened at Grimmauld Place in the twins' letter. "Something funny Blue Jay?" Draco asked.
"Oh sorry for not introducing myself I am Prince Bonecrusher and have been the Potter, Gryffindor Account Manager for 358 years now," Bonecrusher said smiling up at him. "Also if you wish to get your Properties back at once that is the easiest to perform as it does not actually require us to let the people illegally using them know about you taking back control before it is done."
" he said straightening back up.
"I can not allow you to move my patients," Madam Pomfrey said.
He could not help but wonder if someone from the castle would come to check out why he had not shown up for class. Most days lately Harry just spent the day staring into space bored out of his mind, doodling with some of Dudley's old pens, or sleeping the time away. After a week of having nothing to do Harry had ended up doing some simple exercises during his best to stay in shape. He actually took great pleasure in doing some jumping jacks and hearing his Aunt complain. He did point out to her when she screamed at him through the door that if he did not exercise he might just have to try to talk to the neighbors through the bars attached to his windows. She decided to leave him alone after that, and Harry was smart enough not to try it when Uncle Vernon was home lest he find himself back down in the cupboard and his school supplies locked up in the room. That did not mean he did not exercise when his uncle was home he just stuck to more silent activities suck as push-up and sit-up.
"I did nothing Ms. Granger," Professor Snape said reaching for her scroll and reading from it. "It seems that you had a Multi-layered Glamor which changed both your looks but also your voice and was cast by." Rather than saying the name out loud, he arched an eyebrow at the scroll that listed the change that had come from the girl's own mother, Dolores Umbridge.
To get the results he need to pass his OWL and become and Auror after Hogwarts Harry has to find a tutor.
"I don't recall. I know Minnie meet with several Muggleborns but they were all girls, Flitwick met with one of the students whose parent was trying to decide to send their child here or one of the other schools. I don't recall anyone else meeting with new students last summer," Bathsheda said tapping her bottom lip in thought. "His address should be located in the school records," she said.
Harry did hesitate when it came to Peverell's Secret Burrow for while he did not like the fact that Ron, along with his little sister and father had stolen from him he had no issue with the rest of the family and did not want to force them to leave if they had nowhere else to go. Letting Elmblossom know that if the family had no other options for living arrangements he would let them have the place but to place it under Molly's name rather than her husband's. When the property documents were gone the only things left in the ritual chamber were the stuff for the ritual as Elmblossom used the parchment to mark off that Harry had had everything returned to him and properly dealt with before leading him back to Bonecrusher's office.
After making some notes on the back of one of the pages of parchment Draco's dad gave a hard look at Madam Pomfrey. "I am taking Heir Potter and my son out of here," he said.
Rather than having the member of the D.A. face off against each other while casting the spell, as they had done with their earlier meetings Harry had them come up in small groups to test out the spell. The first group to come up was the Weasley twins, the Creevey brothers, Neville, and Cho Chang. Harry could not help but smile seeing the group all cast a corporeal Patronus. There were some gasps as the twins actually created different Patronus, with Fred creating a bird that apart from the color appeared to be a raven, while George's Patronus was a fox. Next to them, the other's Patronus did not seem that impressive other than the fact that they were corporeal. Dennis Patronus had been a beaver, Neville had been shocked to see his Patronus had been a lion cub, Cho's Patronus had been a badger showing Harry that his former crush was still in love with Cedric. While others had not been surprised by Colin's Patronus Harry winced inwardly to see that just like Draco, the younger male had created an owl that looked exactly like Hedwig.
"Well he is but I thought I would get some more help to hedge my bets," Harry lied not wanting to get into it.
Finishing with both adults Albus turned to Draco and began to shift the brat's mind making him act harsher towards Muggleborns, Gryffindor students, and Harry Potter. For some reason, he found the enchantments he had placed on the brat made him feel rather tired, though he thought that it had to do with the fact he was not using the Elder Wand which he seemed to have misplaced but his old Laurel and Walnut wand.* Satisfied with his handiwork Albus fixed up the room as he put the brat into one of the beds before settling both members of the school Governors on their feet before him. Taking a deep breath to recover his Core for a bit Albus cast the spell to unstun the trio. "Very well I shall start looking for a replacement for Poppy right away," Dumbledore said tuning on his heel to leave the room.
"They will use this new freakiness to either kill me or have their way with me," Harry said actually curling up on Draco's lap and taking handfuls of the blonde's sleep clothes.
Professor Snape shows Harry visions of his past to reveal why he treats Harry as he does.
"Are you alright Harry?" Charity asked having backed away to give him privacy to read the test himself.
"Harry, that is me. I am Lucius Malfoy," Lucius shared with the young man as he and his family let out some small chuckles.
"Um sure. I would also check to see if Granger is doing that in any other classes you have with her," Draco suggested.
"So if we win we could make them do anything?" Ginny asked with a twisted smile on her face as she thought of having the pair become her servants.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hello my Blue Jay," Draco's voice said as Harridan found himself in the in what appeared to be Draco's bedroom back at Malfoy Manor.
After the meeting with Susan, he headed out to his next class where Draco pulled him into a tight hug. "Where did you end up my Blue Jay?" Draco asked right into his ear as he hugged his mate.
"But now Professor Snape and McGonagall wish for me to pick someone to represent Hufflepuff during School Board meetings which means it all might come out again," Susan said clenching her left fist in anger as she used her right hand to wipe some tears from here eyes. "They also made a good point that some of the better changes this year had come after the latest Board meeting, I just don't know what to do."
It was thanks to the teachers, and their notes of the Harridan and Draco actions while apart, as well as Snape and Lucius sharing their test results listing them as mates to the School Board that finally got the pair of Veelas into their shared rooms as well as changing Harridan's scheduled, as the submissive partner, to that held by Draco. Which as Draco took some classed he did not give Harridan some extra break periods since both his mates and Snape's suggestion dropped Divination. With the board deciding in their favored Harridan moved out of Ravenclaw Tower and into one of the Mated Dorms of Slytherin House. He also noticed his robes had changed as the Ravenclaw symbol had changed from just a Raven in flight to the bird in what appeared to be sitting in a nest. Only when one looked closer was it able to see the nest was actually a serpent wrapped protectively around the bird's feet.
," Harridan said giving her a deep bow creating an eddy that caused her hair to flutter around her.
"That is mostly true for Goblins but Healers tend to take names that are all animal-related while Ritualists use names that are based on plants," they explained.
Ron had been rather shocked to find a scroll appear in front of him knowing that he had no allergies. Reaching forward he unrolled the scroll and read what had been done to him. His face clouded over as he saw he had been under Love and Loyalty Potions tied to Hermione which had now been cleansed from his system. Even worse than that he had also been enchanted to be lazy, not do his best in classes, had intelligence dampeners placed on him as well as spelled to never reveal what he learned about Harry's home life from the Headmaster and his own mother As neither his mom nor Dumbledore was here at the moment he shot a glare at the seat next to him where Hermione was sitting. The Glare lasted only as long as it took to look at Hermione for her skin seemed to be melting as if she had just drunk some Polyjuic Potion. Letting out a gasp caused others to look over and see what was going on. It was not Hermione's skin that was melting away but an old Glamor coming undone.
"That is actually quite a good question, but once again I can not answer it.  Your Account Manager just informed me that since I came to remove you from your bad situation without any thoughts of reward Batty and I would be given custody of you until we can all find a more suitable situation for you," Charity explained.
"Welcome home dear," the former Boy-Who-Lived now Draco Malfoy's loving boiwife responded stepping out of the kitchen in nothing but an apron. "Did you have a good day at the office?" Harry said rushing forward to take Draco's work cloak before giving him a shoulder rub.
"Yeah is that a problem?" Harry asked afraid of getting teased for the activity knowing that some he knew thought cooking was a woman's job.
"No," Snape said placing a hand on Harry's shoulder again "Lily's Mum and Dad unlike Tuna Fish and my father were perfectly fine with Magic and were so proud of your Mum for having it. The reason we never told them was despite everything Tuna Fish did to her Lily still cared for your aunt. She had the biggest heart of anyone I have ever meet," Snape said as the pair watch a few more memories of Lily and Snape before going to Hogwarts.
"Man you are dense I have been trying to flirt with you for a month," Luna said making herself comfortable on the older girl's lap,
"Point," Harry said. "Also if you worded it that way I would have most likely kneed you in the crotch. Good going on making that sound the most perverted you could."
"That makes some sense most likely Molly or someone submitted that you did so as to not let you know of your real results," Blaise said pulling the twins to his side.
"How did you do that?" Harry asked feeling utterly impressed for even using Sleekeasy Hair Potions that Hermione had told him about had never made his hair this manage or soft.
"I was not told of anything though I was told to offer you some advice the first one is to do some more research into the Hogwarts Houses and secondly was to look at all your relationships," Charity said.  Harry had already planned on doing as he was pretty sure Ron and Hermione were not really his friends.  "I was also told to be available to answer any question you might have about the Magical World."
"According to Madam Burbage both of them came to rescue you from your abusive home. As your results most likely stated The Goblin Nation has placed them in position as you Guardians. We have records of Lady Burbage knowing this but as of right now Madam Baddling has yet to be informed of her new status. While you technically have full control of the vauts that you can access at the current time for us to perform any Rituals," Bonecrusher explained.
Harry was sure he heard Lucius mutter the word, "Cobalt" before he felt a hand wrap around his arm and felt the jerk of a Portkey whisking him away to who knew where.
"Well, due to the spells, mostly due to the removal of the Horcrux his Cleansing actually took nine hours but knowing that might be too long for you or Heir Malfoy we used a Goblin Time-Turner to return three minutes after he started his Cleansing. Our Head Healer having heard the time the Cleansing took decided to cast a spell to speed up time for Heir Potter's recovery in the Halls of Healing so he awoke after only five minutes. After he awoke he got tested by his Ring and was even able to call all but the Resurrection Stone/Gaunt Family Ring," Bonecrusher explained making Lucius look to Harry's hand and see that the boy did seem to be wearing a combined Heir/Lordship ring based on the family crest inscribed around it.
"No the real reason I need to apologize comes later," Snape said as the memories shifted to Snape returning to Hogwarts now friendless and getting approached by his dorm mates.
Stopping what he was doing he had Draco teach him how to place a Floo call so he could contact the twins who had informed them that despite the order getting kicked out of the house they were staying there with Remus.  As he knelt on a pillow and put his head through the flames Severus called out the Floo address for the Black family home where he found Remus and the twins eating a quiet dinner.  Making his presence know he asked about the Cloak which the twins had found the night before in the room Harridan had been staying in with Ron under what had been their brother's pillow.   As they went to go get it Harridan gave his personal account of coming into his Inheritance and finding out his Mate was Draco to help set Remus's mind at ease.  When he told his old Professor about what he had learned about Sirius and his former friends Harridan saw for the first time Remus let out his wolf while in human form.  "I just don't see why he would do it he was your dad's best friend why would he do this?" Remus was muttering to himself as his hands looked like wolf's claws.
"Of course Harridan," Draco said shifting his grip so that his arms were around the other's waist. "I can't even begin to guess what you went through learning I was your Mate but now to find out that Professor Snape is one of your parents along with everything. At least it seems to me he is willing to make a go of it at your own pace. You know what you need?"
"Did you tell my Mom that?" Harry asked.
"Ah you see me cause you are a submissive Veela," Draco said. "You can see me for it is up to you to come to me if you ever need my help my Blue Jay."
Not feeling like he could trust either of his friends at the moment Harry decided to sit next to Neville in their next lessons which had been Potions. Rather than start the class right away, Snape asked everyone to raise their hands if they had a copy of Potions Making: from Cuttings to Brewing. Harry looked around having already asked all the males from Gryffindor if they had the book and had gotten negative answers. But even he was shocked as only Draco had raised his hand. which Harry put down to the blonde being Snape's Godson so he would know the full list of books that the man had assigned to their class. Snape had been left speechless at the news that no one had the book listed on any of their book lists for class causing him to summon old copies of the book to hand out to everyone before he handed back their assignments.
"Agreed," Filius said as the three of them looked to Minerva for the final vote.
"How really did your Patronus change?" Hermione asked as she and Ron came over to chat with him as the next group came forward.
"So that was the Monster," Draco said his voice shaking a little.
"Alright fine," Pansy said rolling his eyes. "But you do know if you share mine I would share yours right?" she asked with a smirk.
"Well, apart from dropping Divinatons I also left Muggle Studies. Don't tell Ron but he had been right about the pointlessness of the class, but not because I was a Muggleborn, but the class itself which from what was taught had not been upgraded since somewhere around the 1940s. If you asked me one of the first lessons they should have taught was dressing," she said with a slightly mad laugh.
In his dreams, Harry is happy it is his waking life that is the nightmare. After coming home from Hogwarts having seen Cedric die at the hands of Voldemort Harry had started having nightmares again as he had after facing Quirrelmort at the end of his first year. He tried contacting Ron, Hermione, and Sirius trying to find out when he would be able to get away from his so-called "family." For some reason, the Dursleys were being more horrible than ever as Vernon actually put Harry through a strip search to make sure he collected everything before locking it all away in the cupboard under the stairs. Thankfully he still had some quills and parchments under the loose floorboard allowing him to send letters to his friends. Even sharing that he had no access to any of his school supplies even his wand got him nothing more than letters that amounted to them telling him to wait to be picked up without telling him when such an event was to occur.
"Why do we need to contact her?" Harry asked.
A new ally leads to Harridan learning more about the bonding process of Veela Mates.
"Well I guess in my First Year my friends and I thought it was you going after the Stone, and when we tried to tell Professor McGonagall she dismissed it, and with Professor Dumbledore gone, we thought we had to move quickly before you got hold of it. Second Year it had to be me for as you and Draco basically revealed during the Dueling Club's single meeting I was a Parselmouth and would be the only one to get to the Chamber. In the Third Year, we did not really plan anything but events just carried us along. All we had really planned to do was comfort Hagrid for what we thought was about to happen to Buckbeak. And things just took off from there with the Time-Turner and everything. Also if you think I ever wanted to take part in that blasted Tournament you belong in St. Mungos' memory ward," Harry said as he suddenly realized he had been pacing for a bit. Looking over at the Potions Master Harry was sure he was about to be called arrogant again only to see Snape had slipped into his chair looking pale.
"I should probably give these to the House Elves who live here so we don't forget," Charity said ignoring her friend's somewhat teasing tone.
" as an older Elf with a small black beard in an outfit that was half a tux and half a sundress appeared before them. "Hello Master Potter, I have come as requested. As you have not summoned me before allow me to introduce myself to you and your guest. I am Tumbus," the older Elf said doing a gesture that was half a bow and half a curtsy.
Harrison let out a sigh as the gift was given to him before he responded, "According to this book she was married to Charlus Potter, which was the son of the man I was named after."
"Well the enchantments that had been placed on you have been cleansed, As for your physical injuries, I am describing a month-long regiment of nutritional potions wither every meal. Your wrist and ribs have been sent and while you were unconscious a healing salve was put onto all of your scars and with luck, they shall be gone before your classes resume. The only one that we did not touch was your lightning bolt scar since that most of your kind know you from that scar. We had also found that the scar had been cursed, and as you can see on your form a Horcrux was attached to it. Even if we do not use the salve with the Horcrux being cleansed the scar will actually start to fade over time," the Goblin said. "Now that you are well enough you do have someone waiting to see you," the Goblin said
"No Ma'am for I can't think of why since my Mom was a Muggle, and since the lessons, we had said I would not go through the change I did not really pay attention to them," Harry said hoping that the Librarian was like Madam Pomfrey and would not ask too many questions.
"Oh he is gone," Lucius said simply in a way that made Harridan think the rat-man had been killed.
"Very well motion passes," Minerva said after a moment. She took so long that Severus wondered if due to how much she was into Albus's camp she was aware of what Granger had been doing to Potter's homework and was trying to think of a way out of it.
Harridan used everyone's distraction to talk Snape into giving him some Family Tree Potions for the Weasley twins so they could figure out more about their real family. Crossing his fingers in the hopes that Molly was not actually their mother. As the two pair of bonded sat in the Mated Slytherin Common Room they watched as George took the Potion to get the results.
"What makes you say that?" Ron asked.
Lucius takes Draco and Harry from Hogwarts
"If I'm correct it is a spell known as a Patronus. The spell has two uses to push back dark creatures known as Dementors, but it can also be used to send messages to others," Draco explained.
It had been a short meeting with Charity sharing her memories of what she had seen at that place and showed Harry to do it as well so he could show the reason for the first account of the use of underage magic.  Charity and the Ministry worker were horrified at what Harry's memory showed which went back a little further than a House Elf appearing where it should not have been but also that the cupboard where his supplies had been kept had been Harry's old bedroom.  As the Head of the Improper Use of Magic office saw that it had been a House Elf and not Harry who had cast the Hoover Charm on his birthday it had been expunged from his records. Harry's case was then sent to the Ministry department dealing with abuse to underage Magicals. As the department sent some Miggle clothed officers to check out Harry's home Charity took Harry to Diagon Alley to help him buy all his new supplies for the coming year. For his own privacy, she stayed behind as he went to gather money from his vaults only to be called to the back office when a Goblin came to collect her to inform her that due to his current state Harry had passed out on the ride back and was currently being healed in the Gringott's Healing rooms.
"I was closer to the Lost and Found than the laundry and I really did not want anyone to see those clothing. Just think of what Draco would say if he saw me in them I would never hear the end of it," Harry explained doing his best to keep a straight face.
"Well I live with my Mum's sister and her family but the test from Gringotts mentioned a Lucius Malfoy is one of my Godparents so you could contact him if he is related to you," Harry said.
"I will do my best sir, now does this include everyone in my family or just the ones living at Peverell's Secret Burrow?"
"Aye, he did Poppy, but as Hermione pointed out to me as we entered the castle Mr. Malfoy seemed to had been hurt as well. I suspect Professor Dumbledore did not realize it which is why he ordered him back to his dorm. I was just staying long enough myself to point it out," Hagrid said as he started to leave.
"Good Morgan's lost left sock," she said after reading over a section showing that Harry's body was currently fighting against multiple Magical Illnesses that he had not been properly vaccinated for. Wasting no time she pulled Harry, Lucius, and Draco out of line and lead them up to the Ward she ran which dealt with underaged Magicals who were sick. "Heir Potter I am afraid that based on this list I am going to have to put you in quarantine for at least a week, so we can deal with everything wrong with you. I am also going to start you on a potion regiment to help deal with the history of malnourishment and other issues I have seen so far from this list. Do you know who I can contact for you your family or any Magical Guardian you may have?" she asked.
"Is something wrong, Char?" Bathsheda asked.
Harry was not sure if due to the change the Potion was less effective or his body had built up a tolerance from the other times he had been forced to drink it while he was in recovery, but Harry woke up before either Ron and Hermione showed signs of getting up. Using his wand he cast a quick Tempus spell and saw, for him, it was late being 7:15 am. Knowing from his long association with Hermione that the Library opened around seven-thirty Harry decided to stop by Gryffindor Tower for a change of clothes before heading out to do some research on Alpha/Omegas.
"Yes Master Goblin," Andromeda said taking one of the two seats across from the Goblin and patting the other for Harrison to sit down. "A little bit ago I received a letter from my nephew Heir Draco Malfoy about someone going through the change and gaining their second Gender. My nephew informed me that Harrison was worried about going home due to the change for fear of his family's reaction. As Harrison had bonded just a little with my nephew he thought it would be prudent for us to accompany Harrison to find out about what properties his family holds as Harrison shared a dislike of the idea of one so young being left alone."
Harry bite his bottom lip for he was not sure as he had not even taught that spell to the D.A. yet. He was about to tell the blonde to pick another spell for them to work on when he saw Draco was giving him puppy dog eyes. That plus Snape saying that Draco's Mother and he did their best to keep Lucius' evil taint from taking hold of him finally made up Harry's mind. "Fine we can try it," Harry said and laughed a little as Draco gave a cheer as he pumped his fist up and down. "Well keep feeling that joy for that is needed for the spell. To cast a Patronus one needs to think of something happy, sometimes a memory others time just something that brings them joy like a pet of favorite book or something," Harry explained as he thought about Sirius after he was exonerated for betraying his parents letting him move in with the man before he cast his Stag Patronus.
"Don't you dare," Harry said though with a small chuckle.
"I agree with his choices," Severus said as Bonecrusher nodded at him while the other Goblin used the Inheritance test to start the audits of the Price Vaults.
"That ... is a rather troubling statement," the Goblin said stroking his beard for a moment. "Now I do not know what has brought you into the bank this day Master Potter but to sent my mind at ease I wish to ask you to go through both an Inheritance Test as well as an Audit of your vaults."
"What can Celia and I do for you, Madam?" Jeffory asked giving a slight bow.
"Surely that can not be true?" Derek Smith asked shocked having never heard of any problem from his nephew Zacharias.
"True, but if what you say is true you either with the whole other way with it or acted like the young kid who pulled a girl's pigtails so they would pay attention to them," Harry said arching an eyebrow at the blonde only to see a blush on the other's face. "Oh my God since when?" Harry asked.
?!?!?" Draco cried out "That asshole if you were raised by Muggles a Professor or Ministry worker should have been sent right to your home to talk to your family about you going not sending you the letters through the Owl post."
Bonecrusher had not been wrong about how messed up the wards had become under Dumbledore's time as Headmaster for it took them a full week to return them to full working order. Thankfully it only took the healer and curse breaker team just two days to both removed the spells on Cuthbert Binns as well as giving him protections to prevent himself from becoming enchanted again. Most students were a little reluctant to return to his class but found the ghost a changed man as it were, as for the first time in any of the current student's memory he actually began the class by taking role call. In Harridan's class, Professor Binns then began a lecture on the origin of the Muggle superstition of Friday the Thirteenth which had taken place during the time of the Magical Hunts in Europe. It was strangely nice to hear about something that actually had to do with humans in the Magical World even if the subject was rather morbid.
"Well this calls for some food," Draco said with a smile as he wrapped his arms around Harry's waist and spun him around a couple of times.  "Though I can't really give you any other clothing I am afraid," Draco said looking down at Harry who was still in his normal sleepwear.  Which consisted of Dudley's old shirts which had been stained so much his cousin did not wish to wear them anymore, and a pair of sweat pants with the bottom of the legs rolled up multiple times.  "I can, however, lend you a cloak to throw over them until you can get changed," Draco said as he pulled out a cloak with Acromantula silk lining and throwing it over Harry's shoulders hiding his clothing.
"Who?" Snape asked still a little in shock at finding out the connection between Hermione and Umbridge. Ron did not want to say who just passed on his results letting Snape see that the young redhead had been enchanted by Hermione, Albus, and the boy's own mother. Seeing the spells placed on him by Hermione showed why the trace spell that had been used on his assignments revealed Granger had basically done the work for him. The spells she had in place would have made Ronald her servant from the love she had him on. "I see," Snape said before looking up at the rest of the class. "If anyone else has been enchanted by someone that they were not aware of please hand in your scrolls." Seeing some students hesitate to do so Snape pulled out his wand making some of them flinch. "I swear to Lady Magic I will not reveal any information on these scrolls unless it is for healing purposes or to punish the use of unlawful enchantments and potion usage on you," Snape said causing his wand tip to light up to show he was being serious with his promise.
"No that is impossible," Pomfrey said looking at the results casting her spell a couple of more times and got the same results. "We must contact the Ministry," she said.
Hermione felt no hesitation when it came to drinking her Cleansing Potion. For she knew that she was the top student in her class and even if what Snape said was true about it abolishing most spells and potions in their system once it was drunk she was sure her Mummy's magic would be alright. Sending a small glare at Potter as he sat next to Longbottom, Hermione could only wonder what was going on that caused her Mummy's plans to be derailed, something that had never happened before. She was sure it was not her fault for she was a brilliant actor and due to her only ever appearing at Diagon Alley and Platform 9 3/4 in the presence of the Squib fourth cousins everyone thought she was an innocent little Mudblood. If only they knew who she really was they would be shocked and bowing down to her, especially the likes of Malfoy who she thought would shit himself if he ever learned who her Daddy was. Hermione could not wait for this charade to finally end and she could deliver Potter to her Mummy and Daddy not to mention cut ties with the blood traitor family.
During the night Draco had become aware of the scent invading his sleep.  At one moment he felt as if someone had raised his covers, but it had to be a dream as something came to snuggle against his form.  But as he took in the scent that had been plaguing him all day Draco opened his arms and wrap around whatever was snuggled up against him.  Feelin content Draco smiled both in his dream and as he held the origin to the scent to his chest, and imagined he heard a small purr come from it.
"I would like to point out that if you had turned in your original draft you would have gotten a mid-ranked EE," Draco said. "I am surprised Professor Snape did not see this when you are in your specialty lessons with him."
The second and third books had also stated that Alphas tended to be more muscular, but not always taller than Omega who always had a more petite and slim form. Once more this did not help Harry determine if he had become an Alpha or Omega for once again due to the Dursley's treatment he was small due to malnourishment they had subjected him to. The books also stated that no matter if a Magical became an Alpha or Omega they could still work any job they wanted to, though they were required to inform their employers when they would be gone due to a Heat Cycle. A spell was listed for use to disguise a Magicals' Scent Gland to hide the fact a person had gone through the change if they liked. Harry quickly jotted down the spell knowing that no matter which one he turned out to be he would need to hide it from his "family."
"It is alright Harry, you did not know," Lucius said gently as he and Draco were placed into beds in the Ward.
"I feel like such a prat she was just walking to supper and something came over me," Ron said muttering into his hands.
"I guess we could do that. Um, would it be alright if I ran my work by you to see if I am doing it right?" Harry asked.
Almost every night would go mostly the same way, Draco would come home to find Harry in whatever gear/outfit he had picked out for the day. Harry would ask about Draco's day while massaging him. Before the pair would head to supper Harry, who was still on his knees before Draco, would pull out the other's cock and give him a quick blowjob. As Harry sucked him off Draco would do his best to pay attention to see if Harry touched himself, almost in a sort of game between the pair. If Harry could touch himself and get off without Draco seeing it Harry would be given the reward of "topping" Draco later. But if Draco noticed Harry touch himself just once Harry would get punished, which either involved spanking or being put into a cock cage for a while. Draco never really cared if Harry actually succeeded for Harry's idea of topping Draco was to have the blonde lay back on their large king-sized bed as Harry rode his cock. Draco had even let Harry know that that was not what topping was but Harry did not care having no other desire than to be the one penetrated.
"You asked Malfoy?" Hermione hissed/asked as Harry and Draco sat down, with Harry still holding onto the blonde's bicep.
"Um, do you mind if I check out out some of your current assignments and any first drafts you have?" Draco asked for once having none of the arrogance his voice normally had when talking to Harry.
"But I thought you had to get some of my blood?" Harry asked confused turning his left palm towards him and seeing it looked like it normally did.
"Than my Blue Jay, bring out your wings for me," Draco said gently as he used a bit of Veela Magic to make Harridan's robes remove themselves from his form so as to not be ripped apart. Harridan did so letting his cobalt blue wings spring from his back again making Fleur gasp at their beauty and caused Draco to subconsciously pull out his own wings to encircle them both in his crimson wings. "Now this might seem like it will hurt but I need you to take hold of one of your feathers and pluck it out." Harridan trusted his Mate as he selects a feather at random and wincing a little pulls it out only to find it had not hurt. "You are doing good Blue Jay now I will pull out one of my own," Draco said suiting actions to words as he pulled out his own feather.
"Okay so everyone is born with one of these types of cores so what does that have to do with his," Harry said gesturing to the door that Voldemort had left through "saving the Magical World?"
"Very well," Bonecrusher said making a note before pulling out a small bluish-silver goblet and a small red blade. "The procedure is both quite safe and quick Heir Potter. All you need to do is hold the blade in your non-dominant hand and prick one of your fingers of your wand hand. You will then let some drops of your blood fall into the chalice. Don't worry after the necessary number of drops have been added to the chalice it will create a field of Healing Magic which will close your puncture wound," Bonecrusher added seeing the look on Harry's face. Being slightly mollified Harry did exactly as Bonecrusher told him and pressed the red blade into the pointer finger of his right hand before holding it above the goblet. After five drops of his blood landed within it some green mist seemed to flow from the rim of the cup instantly healing his finger without leaving even a shadow of a scar. Harry looked at Bonecrusher to see if he needed to do anything else as he put the red blade back on the table, but before he could ask the green mist vanished as with a flash of white light a roll of parchment appeared in the cup. "Your results Heir Potter, it will list not only your family but also anything that has been magically done to you as well as outstanding charges to your vaults," Bonecrusher said passing over the document so Harry could read it as Mr. Malfoy read some of it over his shoulder.
"That is actually quite a good question, but once again I can not answer it.  Your Account Manager just informed me that since I came to remove you from your bad situation without any thoughts of reward Batty and I would be given custody of you until we can all find a more suitable situation for you," Charity explained.
If her son had noticed her almost giving his Godfather's name he did not react to it as he turned to Harry. "It is fine Harry I have all my homework done and just like Gran... Hermione, I am one of the top students in our year," he said in a comforting manner having seen how uncomfortable Harry looked when he asked his question and wanted to assure Harry it would be alright.
"My pleasure Lord Malfoy," Bonecrusher said with a look that said he guessed what Lucius had had to deal with when he had been out of the bank.
"I don't mean to be rude but I thought all Goblins had a weapon or tool-related names.
"Shouldn't we let the students find out the true information themselves,? Minerva asked a little haughtily.
"Why he is just teasing our brothers," Ginny said glaring at the dark-skinned Incubus as multiple students around the group of invading Gyrffindorks rolled their eyes.
"Oh, like Magicals are not strange?" Harry teased.
"How about in the library at around eleven in Bibliography," Draco suggested.
The twins actually laughed for as she said this the time limit expired as everyone but their Dad, Professor Lupin, and themselves vanished out of the house. Seeing that the Wand that Sirius had been using since his escape, an old Black Family wand, was laying on the floor where he had been standing the twins rushed to the upstairs drawing room to peek out the window. They saw the rest of their family, Sirius, Tonks, and Mad-Eye getting to their feet before they approach the front door to the place only to be tossed back again.
"Oh well, I am sorry Potter. Um, where is he?" Severus asked looking around the room.
As they waited for the Elf to return Harry was reminded to eat his breakfast. Harry had basically eaten only three bits before the Elf returned with his trunk. "Heir Potter, can you please removed the Wards from your trunk?" Mr. Malfoy asked turning to him.
"It is alright Heir Potter," Bonecrusher said which Harrison took as both it being alright for almost forgetting it but also as a way to say the added money was no mistake.
Draco and Harry had not shared their real relationship with anyone, not even Draco's parents or closest friends. Harry was the happiest he had even been letting Draco take full control of his life and giving Harry the opportunity to go around next to nothing or fully nude as the mood took him fulfilling some of his kinks. This always leads to Draco wondering what he would come home to having seen Harry dressed in BDSM gear, as a French Maid, just panties, even in fetish gear as he acted like a dog.
"Focus Potter try to block me out," Snape said as he once again sought entrance into Harry's mind. Harry tried to block him out but the man still had not informed him how leading to his least favorite long-term Professor easy access to his mind. Harry was bomb barded by images of his past as he once more relived the cooking lessons with his Aunt which was followed by his first tutoring session with Draco. Harry learning to create a Patronus followed by Wormtail escaping and Sirius being forced to go on the run before he found himself back in the man's office. "Explain the woman," Snape ordered.
"I guess from the list I was given I would want to ask what is an Inheritance Test, a Marriage Contract, and the bond attached to a contract?"  Harry asked.
"Making you Weasley, Granger and Neville flee before you got caught," Draco finished.
"Also point," Harry said as he also recalled Snapes's discussion last night about the form a person's Patronus would take and how Draco's had resembled Hedwig.
"Knock it off, let's just go check the records," Bathsheda stated standing up and heading out of the hall.
"Oh, and what is that?" Albus asked with a forced smile plastered on his face that even Draco could see was fake.
"What do you mean?" Harry asked.
"Not so fast," Draco said standing up.
As Harry and Draco talked about the letters they had both found it strange that out of all the letters only Ron's had talked about the party and the points that had been given while everyone else even, to Harry's surprise, Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy had been more concerned about their health. After finishing their breakfast they had written letters back to everyone letting all their friends know that they were alright and would be out of class for a week. To keep his new bond to Harry a secret Draco played it off as if due to Madam Pomfrey's incompetence his Mother had gone into full Mother Hen mode and keeping him under observation for the week. The only one he made any different comment to was Heir Longbottom as he wrote an apology, at least for scaring him in the Forbidden Forrest during their detention. When Harry wrote to Ron since he was the only one who had brought up points being given he asked how many Draco had been given for the events of the night. Being trapped in his bed Harry passed his letters over to Draco for him to give them to either a member of the staff or take them to the post room in the hospital.
"Well, apart from her," Harry said seeing a blonde girl who had seemed to have followed Draco.
"I am not apathetic that is just my mask to hide what I am feeling but if I share the memory there would be no going back," Draco said staring into the corner of the room.
"My memory it seems," Charity said putting down her sandwich and began to pat her robes. "Ah here they are," she said pulling out some bottles of potion. "The Healers told me to remind me to have you take one of these a meal for the next month," Charity said handing the bottle of nutritional potion over to Harrison. "Their first treatment and the cleaning allowed you to have an almost full meal after living off of barely anything but to get your stomach to remain in peak condition those potions are needed." Harrison just nodded as he downed the potion which due to its coloration he choose to think of as nothing more than chocolate milk to make it easier to drink.
"You may not have love as if looking to become boyfriend or something or maybe even friends but you care for him," Granger said.
Thankfully both of them signed their approval leading Bonecrusher to take him to the appropriate Ritual room leaving the pair behind. "Not to be rude but what would have happened if they had not agreed to have me take part in the ritual?" Harry asked.
"And what was that trying to take over the world and kill all Muggleborns?" Harry asked.
On the day after his Second Cousin had been captured yet escaped once again, he had been surprised to find an unfamiliar and pleasant scent in the castle. He had first smelled the new scent in the Great Hall, but it had been hard to pin down with the scents of the other students. Though there was no mistaking the new and utterly fascinating scent within the hall. Draco had been surprised to find a trace of the scent right there in the Entrance Hall right after breakfast. Draco found himself following the scent up to the library but did not see any students that had a birthday anywhere close to today. Granted he had no idea when Granger's Birthday was but the scent could be coming from her since she was a Mudblood.
"We would also like the test to note if the student is under any spells, potions, or enchantments," Minerva said thinking about what Severus said about his son being under love potions for Hermione.
"I... I'm fine," Draco said in a slightly husky voice.
With that taken care of Bonecrusher promised he would start the job of getting all of Harridan's money and artifacts back as well as sending a message to Professor Snape to come in to get cleansed as he allowed Harridan to leave the Halls of Healing. Joining up with Draco's parents and even hugging Tom to show there were no hard feelings the group decided rather than head back to Malfoy Manor they would get something to eat at a restaurant that Narcissa loved in the Alley. As Harridan watched Draco's parents he found it a little startling to see Tom interact with them seeing his confusion Draco leaned in and informed him that Lucius was the Dominant one in the relationship followed by Narcissa while Tom was the Submissive. Harridan had a feeling that before getting cleansed he would have laughed at the news but now all it did was cause him to raise an eyebrow as he leaned into his Mate as they sat down.
'Really we never did," the twins said.
While Blaise, Theo, Crabbe, and Goyle could not detect the released pheromones Draco could as he quickly got off his bed and rushed to his side.  The blonde's roommates looked on in shock as Draco got down onto the floor and pulled Harry to him.  "Calm down little one," Draco said in a gentle voice halting Harry's movements which had him rocking his head hitting against the wall.  Without meaning to Harry leaned in Draco as his rival threw an arm around his shoulders.  "It will be alright Harry," Draco said gently rocking him.
"Thank you, Professor," Susan said as Amelia give them a slight bow. Before they left the pair alone Severus and Minerva said if she had any questions about being a Founder's Heir she could always talk to Harridan.
"I am sorry do I know you?" Fred asked, "Do you recognized them, George?"
"Yeah I guess it would be strange for any friends you have to accept an invitation from me, so we will just have to get my Dad to add you to the wards so you can send and receive mail through the wards," Draco said.
"Well, to be honest, you might be. I have not had a chance to go through the whole list of stuff that had printed out from my earlier spell. But the test I am speaking of is one administered by the Goblins which might show the reason for your Magical Coma," Mr. Malfoy said. "And since you say you were brought up by your mother's sister this test would also be a way to find out a little about your Magical family as well," he said as he led Harry and Draco out of the small room they were into letting Harry see the counter that he had first seen on his birthday months ago with the Goblins still working at counting gold and jewels as if no time had passed. The three of them stood in line for a bit before a Goblin became available.
"I think you scared him, sir," Draco said as underneath the table he gently patted the pocket where he felt his Mate quivering in fear.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Tom Riddle was once a student at this school, but after he left he changed his name and gained a following of crazed Magicals that shared his beliefs. When he returned to prominence in our world Tom had taken what we all know as He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named," Professor Snape said shocking them.
William "Bill" Weasley was furious after getting back from the Muggle bank with his boss. He knew he had been invited due to how much his family knew about the Muggles, but he was also being watched because his father and two youngest siblings had also messed with Harrison's accounts. It had been the first time Bill had ever seen a Goblin undergo a ritual to make themselves look like a human as Grindstone had done to pass as Devin. And now that they had dealt with the Dursleys he had to take care of business at home. "Ah that feels better," Grindstone said rolling his head on his shoulders. "No offense Cursebreaker William but I prefer my form to that of a human."
Harry had shown this a while back as he had come across a spell in the Potter family library and had shown it to Draco. For even though Harry was not enchanted as others thought he was Harry had turned his Wand over to the blonde thus giving more power over him. Draco loved to use Harry's wand, especially in public, due to how well known the wand was to Dumbles stogies. The spell Harry had shown to Draco allowed the blonde to actually shrink Harry's cock and giving the size to himself, not that Draco had needed it having already been gifted with a foot-long cock, and with Harry's stolen size he would have been over fifteen inches in length. Which was way to big in his mind thus he had taken the size from Harry without adding it to his own, and only returned the stolen size to Harry when he placed a cock cage on the brunette for punishment.
"Alright out with it what was so bad about it?" Harry asked.
"And what is the nature of the meeting?" Luna asked.
"That burst of magic. Did you do something to save Harry's life?" the girl asked a twinkle in her eyes as she took a step closer to him.
Not sure how much work the Goblin had left Charity began to give Harry a more full account of the Hogwarts Houses.  Thus Harry learned that while Ravenclaw was the House of the knowledge it did not just mean knowledge that came from books but from life experiences, street smart, or just a thirst for any type of knowledge one could get their hands on.  As a former Ravenclaw herself she also explained why the House had raven in its name but its animal mascot was an Eagle, though made him promise not to spread it around.  For Hufflepuff Charity let him know that the House was not just a place to make friends it was seen as a place of quiet contemplation saying that while Ravenclaw could be seen as the Mind Hufflepuff was the Heart of Hogwarts.  Charity also corrected a lot of the negative information on Slytherin House letting him know that it was not a House of evil as some like the Headmaster said it was but was actually as a place of healing that focused on both mind and body.  Continuing the analogy she called Slytherin the actual Soul of the school as Harry thinking along those lines inwardly classified Gryffindor as the muscle or strength from the year he lived in the House.  Well, it would have been if not for the actions during the last part of his First-Year and the incident with Norbert where the House turned against Neville, Hermione, and him.  At that moment the House had acted harsher towards him than even Slytherin had done at that point, though technically during that time it was the Slytherins who had not turned against him.
"Does this have anything to do with," Hermione began before shifting her voice into a whisper "
"Very well, you are henceforth assigned this case and we will expect regular updates," Grindstone said passing over the work contract for Bill to sign. "His Majesty would also like you to make sure that no other member of your family is involved in this, just because they are not listed as taking any money or items from Heir Potter's holdings does not clear them as of yet," Grindstone said taking back the document after the human had used the Blood Quill to accept the job.
When Lucius finally arrived back at the bank he was directed not to the Halls of Healing but Prince Bonecrusher's personal office. "Ah Lord Malfoy I was just about to send a raven for you. Heir Potter has finished with everything and can be taken to St. Mungos now," Bonecrusher said.
"Sure why not," Harridan said with a small shrug.
"I will reduce the price and give you the book if you help me study for D.A.D.A. for I don't see me passing them with Umbitch's ban on casting the spells," Draco said making Harry realized that the blonde was not wearing his "Inquisitorial Squad Badge"
"It was somehow Quirrell," Draco said, "WHAT THE HELL!!!?"
"It will be seen to Cub," Tumbus said their body seething in anger. "And what would you have us do to this Dobby if we catch him?"
"How it is not like I hang around the door to learn your guy's passphrase," Harry said.
Both Harry and Charity looked to the Goblin Healer who put down their work and turned to the pair of Humans.  "I can.  An Inheritance Test is a special test that is usually done on Magicals re-entering the Magical World for the first time after a tragedy occurs such as the death of your parents and being brought up in secret.  I know your Account Manager tried to give you one last year but had just missed you.  Another case is if a Magical suffers from Amnesia either through enchantments or more mundane means.  An Inheritance Test gives a person a range of information about themselves.  The most common pieces of information being their parents, guardians, what lines they hold, the status of their vaults, if they have any Marriage Contracts, and can also give the sort of information that your medical test covered.  You will be getting a full look at one later when your Account Manager comes to collect after I am satisfied," the Goblin Healer said turning back to her work.
"No I am not Fredrick," Snape said, "due to you wining the line by right of Conquest and by the added bonus of being twins you are now both Lord Prewett." The twins smiled at each other before they turned to the still passed out Ron and Ginny.
"What about your dad?" Harry asked.
"Alright random examples Pumpkin Juice, or how about the fact that Hogwarts is set up so that the students basically try to one-up each other rather than have equally learning for all," Harry pointed out.
A half-hour later Bathsheda Baddling was led into the office looking confused. "I got a summoning to come here?" she said sounding confused.
"Last time you wanted to fly my broom for "a couple of moments" you flew it for an hour and we got in trouble from Madam Hooch for almost missing curfew," Harrison pointed out. "No, I think it would be best to spend the afternoon backing up so I don't have to rush it tomorrow morning like I have done the last two years." As if to emphasize his point Harrison left the table and headed back up to his dorm room and began to pack up his stuff. Though he stopped after a while when he decided to also clean out his trunk of scarps of parchment and other bits of trash. After all, there was no reason whatsoever to still be carrying around Lockhart's books which he had been unable to remove from his trunk during the summer due to it being locked under the stairs at the Dursleys and not wanting to toss them out in Diagon Alley. He also knew that Hermione would skin him alive if he even thought of just dumping them into a fireplace as kindling so he put them in a pile using a bit of scrap parchment to give the message that the pile was all trash. According to Draco and Luna some House Elves that worked at Hogwarts would get rid of them for him.
Besides the scroll he had gotten from Ron, Snape was soon handed the scrolls from Harry, Neville, and all the Fifth-Year Gryffindor girls in the class. After a quick look, Snape saw one common factor on each of the scrolls. Each of the students had been listed to have been enchanted by Hermione at some point in time. Both Harry and Neville had been enchanted to be loyal to the girl, but thinking of the change that had happened between Harry and the girl since his tutoring session Snape tapped the scroll to get a more detailed analysis and saw that due to the anger Harry was experiencing at finding out what she had been doing to him it had partially blocked out her spell. The other three Gryffindor girls had been enchanted to follow Hermione's order whenever they were in their shared bedroom as well as be unable to tell anyone about it.
"There is no one here by that name. You leave my family alone or I shall call the cops," the man growled out his large bushy mustache twitching.
"Not allowed I thought all Magicals were allowed?" Harridan asked looking between his Papa, Draco, and Quistis.
"I second that," Filius said wondering if that was why some of his students were having trouble in the last couple of years. He wondered if Harry had found out about a missing text, which could explain his improvement over the last couple of weeks.
"Its actual title is Wolf's Bane as in the bane of the wolf it does not help them but poisons them and the longer they are one it the worse they get. I recall overhearing the Wea... Ron mentions how when you had rescued your Godfather, Lupin had transformed into a bony man-wolf with short fur, that is not what a normal Werewolf would look like when transformed which makes them look like normal wolves just a bit larger with long fur coats that are actually really soft," Draco said.
"They also help run the vaults, manage investments, keep track of any legal documents, artifacts, and Grimoire old families such as your own possessed," the Goblin Healer added from the side where she doing some work in the corner.
"Very well after we find out any properties you may possess at the bank Dorra will take a statement from you about why you felt your family would possibly kill you," Andromeda said as she held up a hand to stop Harrison from interrupting her. "Draco did share a little bit about your "family" but as my Dorra is an Auror she can use her potion to press charges against them for their treatment of you, but only if she hears it directly from you."
As they waited for the Elf to return Harry was reminded to eat his breakfast. Harry had basically eaten only three bits before the Elf returned with his trunk. "Heir Potter, can you please removed the Wards from your trunk?" Mr. Malfoy asked turning to him.
"No, it is the truth here let me show you," Harry said taking out his bag and pushed over the first draft from his Potions homework of the year and the one he had turned in with Hermione's help which had Draco's notes on it.
"Ah it seems my hypothesis was correct," Narcissa said as she led Draco back to the bed where he had his injuries from the night before seen to.
"I shall pass on your message to the rest of the staff Heir Weasley, Messer Lupin-Weasley," she said her voice back to normal again.
"Mr. Potter will not be telling us anything for a bit," Madam Pomfrey said having finished examing the still unconscious Gryffindor. Draco did his best not to grit his teeth seeing like most of the staff at the school the Medi-Witch refused to use a student's proper title such as the case with Potter who should be at least referred to as an Heir.
"You mean like your dad?" Harry asked.
In the end, it was almost a full month before they were allowed to move into the Mated dorms. Harridan would have thought it was another way that Dumbles tried to get him back under his thumb if it was not for the fact that the other new mates who were also in separate Houses were also not allowed access to the Mated Dorms. Snape informed them Albus was telling everyone that the pair was not in fact mates and that Draco had just enchanted "Harry." Though it was easily seen that was not the case especially after the first week when due to them being separated for long stretches of time without fully being bonded their dominant and submissive tendency started to come out. With only spending his dreams as well as Herbology, Transfiguration, and Care of Magical Creatures with Draco, Harridan was finding himself feeling rather skittish and low on energy, while Draco was rather irritable and getting angry at everyone who had not come out as a submissive. Most of the Professors, with the exception of the new D.A.D.A Umbridge took the mate's separation into account and did not assign them any detentions. Harridan got sort of lucky in not getting any detentions from the woman due to the fact that her classes were just reading from the book which was all he really had the energy for. On the other hand, Draco earned a detention a class with her but due to Lucius's position with the Ministry, she did not make him use her tainted blood quills while he wrote lines with her.
"Well, you are not too bad when you are not acting, like a massive prick. Let's play it by ear," Harry said.
Harridan's Papa did let him know one thing that for the plan to work he would need Harridan to sign that he was allowing Snape to have access to Gryffindor Vaults. Snape had explained that, unlike most Gringotts, at least in Brittan, the Founder Vaults could only be accessed by blood relations. Even as the Steward of Gryffindor Snape could not access the vaults without Harridan's express permission. After signing for his Papa to use his vaults now trusting the Potions Master, unlike before their relationship was known, Harridan pricked his middle finger of his dominant hand to let the blood fall on the document. Snape had his son place his hand on the spilled blood and push some of his magic into the document, which he explained would show that Harridan had been the one to give permission and he had not just taken blood and forged the signature.
In the first book,
"You may not have love as if looking to become boyfriend or something or maybe even friends but you care for him," Granger said.
"True going through a change does not automatically make one know how to Apparate," Draco said putting emphases on the last word.  "But if say you had known the location of the Slytherin dorms you, of all people, could have gotten in."
"The Ministry officers have taken over and placed Sirius in Magic Damping Cuffs and are leading him away," Fred stated.
"What is it?" Hagrid asked coming over his footsteps causing the ground to shake a little. "Sweet Merlin," the man said as both Draco and he looked at the back of Quirrell's head as the clouds overhead had shifted letting a little more moonlight into the clearing. Sticking out the back of the man's head was another face.
"Alright I get it you know me but how about stuff I have never really told anyone?" Draco asked. When Harry did not object the other continued, "Most people assume that I plan on following either my Father or Godfather's footsteps but in truth, I wish to take after my mother and become a Healer or if not that go into Wand Making."
As the group arrived at the Great Hall Ron and Ginny rushed over and started screaming, "WHAT THE BLOODY HELL DID YOU DO TO US?!?"
Harry almost told Professor Dumbledore about going through the change but he had focused on Harry's adventure with the Time-Turner and saving his Godfather and Buckbeak the night before. Which only gave Harry more to think about, so that by the time he remembered to talk to the Headmaster about the change the man had already left. Having nothing for it Harry returned to the library. Unfortunately, Madam Pince informed him that when he had been gone someone else had requested the books so she had to pass them on. With a small huff, Harry left the room wondering what he should do for the rest of the day, or for that matter the next couple of days before term actually ended only to stop in place as he smelled a scent similar to the one he had gotten from Sirius. Looking around he tried to locate the source of the scent but by now the library was actually rather full so he had been unable to find who it was coming off of. That is unless he wanted to go sniff at every male in the general vicinity to see if the scent had come from them, which of course he had no desire to do.
"Well you basically confessed your feelings for me, before we sort of got sided tracked," Harry stated.
Harrison's plan for Neville to sit with them nearly worked out perfectly as the round-faced boy was ecstatic to be asked to sit with Hermione and him in their compartment, Harrison did not mention Ron though he knew the red-head would be there anyway. The only issue that had come about was about an hour and a half into their trip a small owl pecked at their window to be let in. Once it was inside the small bird dropped a letter on Harrison's lap before zooming around the compartment until Ron caught it having seen Crookshanks follow its progress from its place on Hermione's lap. Seeing the letter was from Sirius, Harrison read it quietly to himself before wondering if he should inform Ron that the owl he was holding was now his, from Sirius, as an apology for what happened with Pettigrew. "So who was the letter from Harry," Neville asked. Harrison had as of yet not told anyone besides Luna and Draco his desire to use his birthname yet waiting to bring it up at the start of next term as if he had found out about his name over the summer.
Yes, Jo Lesky once again appears, my favorite of all my Original Characters.
"Now boys, that is hardly needed," Albus said in his best Grandfatherly tone but the twins ignored him in favor of the Deputy Headmistress.
"I was not saying your name I was using your proper title Heir as in next in line to lead your family's house. And the exam all students are required to come to take part in during the first week, a month at the most, of school. That is unless you had an exam at St. Mungos before coming to school," Draco's dad said.
(See the end of the chapter for
"As a Veela, we both have wings mine came out when I went through my inheritance while yours will come out when we first meet or when you can find someone that can bring you to me. Your wings are one of the ways I can recognize you. I must say you have a very beautiful set of cobalt blue wings hence the name. Does that help you to understand it enough?" Draco asked placing a finger under Harry's chin and tilting his head up to look at him.
"Well it could make sense after all the four were considered contemporary they might have all had kids around the same time who could all have had their children at the same point and so on and so on," Harridan responded.
"Well that is alarming," the Goblin said looking over the note. "And you did this all by yourself?" he asked.
"Very well let's just get this over with," Draco said as he allowed Granger to help him after the oaf of a gamekeeper. He knew that he would have been fine if he had gone to the Slytherin dorms for his injury would have been read by the special Charms Professor Snape cast at the start of the year to register if any of member of the House got hurt outside of class or Quidditch. The Charm was in place due to thanks to Dumbledore's very anti-Slytherin views some members of the other Hogwarts Houses bullied Slytherins if they left the dorms by themselves. Though as he thought about it there might not actually be help waiting in the dorms for him due to the lateness of the hour the report of his injury might not yet be noticed.
"I know I am the last person you expect to help you Heir Longbottom but I can not abide a person being under such enchantments that the three of you are under. Hence why I am sending you to my Account Manager, Witherclaw. Once you arrive ask for your Account Manager... Harry, it might be best for you to do so since the Potter family has higher standing than either the Longbottoms or Weasleys. Don't worry I am sure either of them will explain it to you when I am gone, or if not them the Goblin's will at the Bank. I will try to make excuses for your absence. So while I am gone I want you all to hold the Portkey lest one of you get left behind," Snape said pulling out a Prince Family artifact and passing it over to Harry who was situated between Neville and Ron. "I hope it does not take me long to distract them so sit tight," he said giving them a reassuring smile as he left, locked, and Warded his office from everyone but himself.
"Who is she going with Gin?" Ron asked.
"Nobody is nothing and you really are not a freak, bad at Potions, and I thought you were a little full of himself but not a freak," Draco said.
"It was just the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. That morning I had received a letter from St. Mungos informing me that my Mother had died thanks to a drunken beating from Tobias, my father. That added with the stress of my O.W.L.s caused my emotions to be running high and then James and his gang of bullying bastards made me lose it. I was also upset that they were still in school for it was shortly before our test began when they tried to trick me into meeting Lupin in his Wolf form," Snape explained.
"Well for one thing to announce our Mateship to our friends and another to form an alliance.  I know my parents are going to try to take down Dumbles legally but that might take a while so we decided to form an alliance for while we are at Hogwarts," Draco said.  "We also thought that if we are to ally it might be a good idea for us all to meet and get to know about each other."
As Bonecrusher left to put Harrison on the schedule for a Cleansing as well as changing access to all holdings the boy controlled the four humans discussed where Harrison would be moving into for the foreseeable future. Harrison just could not see himself living by himself in either a castle or a manor so he took those properties out of the running, as was the townhouse fearing how the neighbors if they were Muggles, would react if they only saw Harrison living there by himself all the time. The cottages might be nice but he was not sure if he could manage them alone(*) and finally there was the Marauders' Retreat. While the test only stated his lines only owned two-thirds of it there was a chance that either Sirius or Lupin might show up there, which would mean he would not have to disrupt the lives of Draco's cousin's family. Though he hoped that Lupin was the last owner of the place and not Peter who having fled Hogwarts might think to use it as a safe house. Seeing that one-third of the property was own by Sirius who was also on the run if Harrison was in Peter's shoes he would not risk it but he was not sure how smart Ron's former rat was. Harrison shared his choice with the Tonks family making them all wait for the Goblin to return so they could find out where the Marauders' Retreat was located and what sort of protection it had on it.
"Understood, Sir," Bill said standing up as he tries to think of a reason that he is back in Brittian and needing to spend so much time with his family.
"But what about Professor Lupin if all this was true about Werewolves why would he support Headmaster Dumbledore?" Harry asked thinking he had found a hole in their arguments.
," the elder said with a smile filled with crooked teeth. "
?!?" Harry cried out "Um I consent to your request," Harry said trying to recall the wording his Uncle Vernon would use when dealing with a member of a bank.
"Well if we are going to the Yule Ball together I want to make sure you have the proper look and your hair is not its normal rats' nest," Draco said.
"Is that what is affecting Harry?" Longbottom asked.
Back at Hogwarts Castle, a wave of magic washes over Ron and Ginny making the pair wake up screaming in pain as the ritual washed over them as it cut them off from the Weasley family magic and undid their blood adoptions. After falling out of their beds due to the pain the pair rushed to their dorms bathrooms to splash some water on their faces. At nearly the same time in the two Gryffindor bathrooms, the former Weasley looked up and saw their new features. Without Arthur's traits, the pair looked in shock at their hair which while still red was now more scraggily and less bouncy. Ron now found that his eyes had shifted color from their normal blue to a dark mud-brown as well as becoming narrower. It took Ginny a little longer to realize her eyes had changed due to them going from the light-brown to more mud color rather she was focused on her cheeks which had become in her opinion hallow and slightly ugly.
"You forgot to mention Draco and Harridan are Veela Mates," the girl said still shaking her head.
"She is not a Weasley," the twins, Harridan, Draco, and their friends all called out but the old fool ignored them as an idea came to him.
"Well it does not really matter anyway," Dumbeldore said pulling out his wand and before either man or Draco could do anything hit them with a powerful stunning spell blasting all three backward over beds, chairs, or anything that was between them and a solid wall. Albus then began to whistle tunelessly to himself as he approached all three stunned males and began to manipulate their minds removing any knowledge they had of him enchanting his weapon. Seeing a perfect opportunity the old man also implanted ideas into Lucious's head to make him act more like the Death Eater most already thought he was. Albus had no fear of his spell being discovered just like the charm he had placed on former Minister Bagnold that made her start handing out harsh punishments to any suspected Death Eaters, with Dark Cores while at the same time turning a blind eye to his Order of the Pheonix. He, unfortunately, could not get them to rehire Poppy due to it being Hagrid of all people to raise the latest issue with her which had lead to their investigation.
"Well as a Submissive Veela your Allure would only work on me to calm me down if I went into Berserk Mode if someone was to attack you," Draco said reaching over and patting Harry's hand. "It is only a Dominant Veela whose Allure can affect other people."
"Well according to Snape a Mating group should have access to a Mated Dorm room. He guesses that Dumbles prevented us from getting one ourselves. Don't worry my Blue Jay we will be together soon enough and until then we still have our dreams," Draco said giving Harridan a quick kiss.
"Does this mean I will have to miss a week of class as well?" Draco asked making Harry wince not wanting to cause any issues due to whatever had happened to him.
"So what spell did you want to work on tonight?" Harry asked.
Draco grumbled a little as he limped over to Potter still clutching his side. He was just wondering how he would deal with the still unconscious Gryffindor when Granger, Longbottom, and Fang showed up. Granger and Longbottom were distracted at seeing Quirrell trapped over the Groundskeep's shoulder. Draco rolled his eyes a little and not wanting to ask for help reached down and tried to pull Potter to his feet. Something strange happened, however, as his flesh touched Potter's there was a flash of magic. "What the hell," Draco said moving his hand quickly away from Potter.
"That is it I feel it I am finally whole again as he hugs Narcissa tucking his head under her chin as she pats his back while Draco helps Harridan out of the room to follow the Goblin to the main cleansing.
After a moment Draco aimed his wand upward and shot off a shower of red sparks. Not knowing how long it would take the others to get there Draco quickly return his want to point at Quirrell as he tried a spell he had read about in one of his dad's books, "Stupify." As the ruby light shot from his wand tip Draco watched it slam into Quirrel's form causing the man to collapse in a heap on the forest floor. Hearing a crash to the side Draco, while keeping his wand pointed at Quirrel's form turns to look to see the giant oaf, Hagrid, show up with his crossbow looking around the small clearing.
"Would they affect me?" Harry asked having not come across any mention of love potions in regards to Alpha and Omegas in the books he had looked at yesterday morning.
"No Blue Jay it just allows us to be ourselves. This is another reason for these dreams as it allows us to get to really know each other and see that we might not have been who we thought the other was when we meet in real life."
"Yes, Ma'am," Harrison said with a nod.
"That is perfectly alright as long as you are happy," Harrison said earning him a look of approval and joy from the three Elves.
"I had three parents one of which is Professor Snape who is the Lord of the Most Ingenious House of Prince. so I am technically Heir Prince," he explained.
"Thank you, Master Grindstone may your coffers never run dry," Mr. Malfoy said as he and his son bowed to the worker.
Inside Malfoy Manor, Draco tried to figure out how to get Harrison to notice him after all he had been told since he had been a young boy that the pair had a Marriage Contract with each other. Yet he had not immediately recognized the other boy when they first met in Madam Malkins with Draco only finding out his identity on the train ride causing him to rush from his compartment only to find Harrison sitting with the Blood Traitor Ronald Weasley. Draco had been sure that even if Harrison had been under enchantments as soon as they touched due to their bond the other boy would be well again only for Harrison to refuse to shake his hand. During a letter to his parents over what had happened his father had suggested that Draco make Harrison angry enough to challenge him to a duel. Draco would then use some Cleansing spells his mother had taught him to fix Harrison right up. Yet when Harrison showed up at the duel rather than have to deal with just the Blood Traitor the Muggle Pretended had arrived. Draco not liking his odds against both the traitor and the pretender, nor having any idea how Heir Longbottom would react Draco and his partner had scampered away.
"I think my mind was still dealing with the events of two nights ago," Harry said.
"Moron it is Ron and Ginny," Ginny stated through gritted teeth.
After the Lupin-Weasley group had left she cast a charm on her fireplace that would prevent Albus from monitoring her Floo and contact Remus right away to ask him to join the school board to cast Ravenclaw's vote. He did not even need any convincing as he agreed right on the spot, almost before she had finished asking the question. She wished that there was a way to find out who, if anyone was the holder of the Hufflepuff Lord/Ladyship but the only ones who could tell her that would be the Goblins, due to their records, but they would never do it for it would be a breach of a Magical's personal information.
"What do you mean Son?" his mother asked.
He got no response from either his friends or Sirius nor did he have another dream to talk about what had happened with Draco, but he guessed that was a good thing for as well connected as the Malfoys were they would probably know about the hearing which would give his identity away. Three days after the Dementor attack he was finally collected from the Dursleys allowing him to get his stuff back and access to his wand again. As he took up his wand again Harry could not help but breathe a sigh of relief and could not wait to tell Draco about it when next he saw him in a dream for a wand could be used to get him to his mate. As he thought that his mouth fell open in shock as he realized that he was thinking about going to see Draco over being with his friends where ever they were. He was still thinking over the thought as the Remus, the real Moody, as well as a witch named Tonks and a Warlock called Kingsley lead him to their destination.
"It is not something I spread around for while my Ancestors was great my most recent family not so much," she said.
Getting sick of the blonde not looking at him Harry placed a body bind on the other so he could no turn away and went to stand before the other. "Alright I get it if it is personal and you don't want to share what helped you produce your Patronus, but I can't help you if you have trouble with it latter if I do not know what you thought of as you cast it," Harry said crossing his arms and almost glaring at the other teen.
"What?  No," Draco protested.  "I changed in November and I can tell you that no one else's scent had affected me as much as yours has.  Smelling it yesterday morning I basically followed you around yesterday.  The only reason I did not find you then was the belief that you were both too young to have gone through the change and your parentage.  I swear on my Magic itself that I will help you.  You do not need to select me as your Alpha but let me at least keep you safe from your family," Draco said holding tightly onto Harry's arm in a strong yet loose grip letting Harry getaway if he wished to.  "Even if you do not want me to go with you I will contact my Aunt and Uncle to look after you so you can live on your own in a Potter Family Property," Draco said.
"Neither of those Potty your Potions Making: from Cuttings to Brewing," Draco said giving him a scowl as if Harry was being purposely dumb.
"You remember the duel I challenged to in our First-Year?" Draco asked.
Charity rubbed the back of her neck awkwardly.  "From what I know from some of the other members of staff that have them.  An Account Manager is a specified job for Goblins who manage the numerous bank vaults for Magical beings who have over a certain amount of money," she explained.
"Very good Heir Potter we shall do both right away," the Goblin said as he pulled out a small platinum knife, an obsidian goblet, and a roll of parchment. "I shall just prick your finger for some blood for the test," the Goblin said suiting actions to words as both Tom and Lucius held on tightly to Draco so he would not hurt the Goblin for causing Harry pain. As soon as the necessary blood had been added to the goblet Narcissa used her wand to heal the small puncture wound as Draco brought it to his face beginning to sniff and lick the finger that had been pricked. Due to watching Draco do this Harry had not paid attention to the Goblin as he performed the ritual for the test. "Now as you have given your blood I can also use it with your given consent to start a quick audit of your vaults as you go over your results," the Goblin said as he passed over the results of Harry's test.
"Yes that was me after taking a look at an audit of my accounts and finding that your mother, younger siblings, Hermione and Sirius had been messing with my vaults," Harridan said smiling up at the twins.
"Yes, it is," Harrison said with a small gulp.
"I guess according to the author of the book they did not think my grandparents would find the will to live unless their grandson was brought back to them listing my name as Harrison," Harrison said.
"It is nearly lunchtime, Master Potter. Would you like Celia and me to make you some lunch?" the Elf in the skirt said.
"Just cause it is your son," Harry heard Madam Pomfrey mutter softly to herself.
"In layman terms due to what we have found out about my client couple with how you and Bathsheda helped him out of a bad situation without thought of any type of reward lets me put him in both your care. It also did not hurt that your worry and disappointment at yourself for possibly causing him to pain sealed the deal. I will mention that just because of your new duty as his guardian I still can not give you any private information about him other than to point out some general information. In the first bit of advice, you might want to talk to him when he gets up and give him information on the Hogwarts Houses and suggest he looks at some of his relationships. Also while I can not share who it is with his parents did arrange a Marriage Contract for him between a child of some of their friends from when they had gone to Hogwarts themselves. Now as a Muggleborn Magical you may not be well acquainted with Marriage Contracts. When a Contract is legal, valid, and those involved are attracted to the other's sexual identity a bond is created between them. I can inform you this at least that we had found that one of the enchantments that Heir Potter had been under was to block such a bond so he may ask you about it when the results of what we had cleansed from him. If he wishes to share his results with you or Madam Badding we do hope you keep his information a secret," the Goblin stated.
"It was only after Fenrir became the pack's Alpha when Tom came in giving the Wolves some of his old family lands to create places for them to live since Dumbles had made it impossible for a Werewolf to own property or even have a job," Narcissa said as she drank her tea.
"Agreed, we shall all check to see if our students have all the books that they need. I shall talk to the rest of the staff so they can ask about their classes for missing text that they had assigned," Minerva said. "Now is there any other new business?'
Rubbing his forehead, Draco knew he had to clear his head of this scent.  It was making him lose control of his Pureblood Mask.  Needing to get away from it all Draco decided to spend the afternoon either in the Slytherin Common Room or in the company of his friends.  And for the most part, his plan had worked only coming across the scent when he had gone to supper that night.  As he settled into his bed that night at least he had proved without a doubt that the scent had not originated from anyone in Slytherin having spent his time in the Common Room playing Magical Chess and even joining in on several games of
"I can not allow you to move my patients," Madam Pomfrey said.
"Well we actually came to get a test done," Harry said before the second part of the request went through his mind. "Vaults what do you mean I only have the one?"
, and began to read it. Harry felt himself blushing deeply as he quickly read the first chapter which dealt with an Omega's Heat making sure to latch on certain facts such as an Omega, even a male one, would go through a Heat for anywhere from twelve hours to two days once every month and a half. If an Omega did not have an Alpha that when they went into a Heat it was important to provide various items for them to use to deal with their sexual urges. An Omega could go through Heats with different Alphas until they had bonded and marked with an Alpha and brought out their scent glands. If a strange Alpha tried to accompany an Omega that had been bonded during a Heat the Omega would attack and possibly kill the "stranger" even if there were best friends outside of a Heat. Another difference was shown between Alphas and Omegas as male Omegas would only be able to get off from being penetrated by their Alpha, which Harry read as a male Omega could only end up with another male. While an Alpha would have a sort of knot, just like a dog which they would use to bond with the Omega during their heats. Other than the knots Alphas also tended to have larger cocks than their male Omega counterparts. This did not help Harry at all for due to being brought up with the Dursleys he had learned to not look at anyone else so he was not sure how he measured up with anyone in that department.
"Why did you never say anything?" Harry asked after finding his voice for the second time in the last hour.
Harry was pleased as he saw the red EE on his homework and casually shifted the paper to let Draco see it who gave him a tiny smile for a job well done. As the class started brewing the day's potion the overall work from everyone increased thanks to the books they had been given as for the first time in Harry's memory there had been no major or even minor Potions accidents during the lesson. "Very good everyone I think from now on I will have the books waiting for you at your table," Snape said as to everyone's shock he gave points to Neville and Harry for having the best potion in class. Neville nearly fainted having never been one to be given points in any class, other than Herbology, yet he had gotten ten from Snape.
Harry had to blush a little at Draco's reaction to it as he clapped his hands together and gave a loud whistle until the Stag vanished. For a moment there was silence in the room as Harry let Draco pick out a memory or feeling in silence before the blonde tried the spell. After a bit, Draco seemed to have picked something as he cast his Patronus as, unlike Harry's first attempt which had been little more than mist a form appeared. A pure white owl flew from the tip of Draco's wand looking so similar to Hedwig it was almost funny. Harry had turned to tell Draco he had done a fantastic job only to see the other boy blushing so deeply his face was a match for Ron's hair. "What's up Draco?" Harry asked thinking that he had missed something in teaching and Draco had gotten sick. Stepping forward Harry lifted his hand and pressed the back of it to Draco's forehead to check for fever only for Draco to step back blushing even deeper. "Are you alright," Harry asked getting worried.
"It is alright Professor," Harry said.  "Um, not to be rude but why were you chosen to be my guardian?"
"That really is troubling,": Pamona said looking worried. " I wonder if my students have all their books as well."
"I am not going to get sick it is just a cloak Ron, if Dudley's old rags don't make me sick I don't see how a cloak which was most likely cleaned at some point in the castle laundry could do it," Harry said.
"We are really for breakfast you can get off the bed now," Draco said giving a small smile to Harry. Harry scooted to the edge of the bed before he hopped off of it wrapping Draco's cloak tight around his slim form. Despite how they might have felt for Harry the others formed a small circle around Draco and Harry as they left the bedroom to better block him from view from the other Slytherins. This measure, however, did nothing to stop Pansy from easily slipping in and walking on the opposite side of Draco than Harry was. It was then that Harry saw that maybe without realizing it Draco giving him his cloak had helped blocked out any unpleasant scents. For Pansy was rather close but all he could smell was Draco's scent.
As the door closed behind them Albus wanted to scream if only Pomona had not come with the girl he could have easily cast some compulsions on the girl making her choose Albus to be her Proxy for both Wizengamot and the Hogwarts School Board. He was sure that if he had access to one of the Hogwarts Founders votes the Light Party would have no choice but to accept him back as the leader of the party putting him back in the position of Chief Warlock. He had only bowed out quietly for it worked in his plans for the Potter brat, but those had all gone out the window when the boy had become a nasty creature. Albus had been waiting to reveal if things got too bad or the fools had started to change some of his laws that he was the Proxy of Gryffindor House seat but the brat had taken control of his seats and handed them over to Lucius Malfoy to act as Proxy. As of right now due to losing Harry and Severus's seats the Light Section had the same amount of seats as the Dark the moment. The only reason that it was still a Light Section party member that held the rank of Chief Warlock was due to them having had the power before the sections had reached a tie of seats, but a single seat in either direction could make a difference at the moment. So he needed the Hufflepuff seat which had been inactive for over fifty years and thus had not been part of any of the three parties' totals. If he could not get Susan to hand him her votes herself he would send his daughter and pawns after her to get her to act towards the Greater Good.
"Strange," Draco said though with a laugh as she shook his head a little.
"Is anyone?" Draco asked back.
Unfortunately, she did not find Potter right away on the train ride during her First-Year which allowed the bastard to make a friend with the blood traitor Ronald Weasley. This caused Hermione herself to somewhat alert the plan as she tried to get close to the pair which only really happened after the incident with the Troll during her first Samhain at Hogwarts. As soon as both boys were her "friends" she began to correct their homework to make them get bad grades while still appearing to be trying to help them. She did not expect the Blood Traitor to catch wind of her plan after just a month of doing this and corner her. The idiot made a big mistake coming after her alone and not telling a teacher or anything as Hermione was easily able to stun him, thank you, Mummy, before starting him on undetectable love potions which would make him develop a crush on her and would prevent him from acting against her.
"What, and end my fun with messing people?" Luna shot back with an airy giggle that seemed to tap an unknown string within Pansy's heart.
The pair were woken up the next morning by a Medi-Magical coming in to deliver their breakfast but also some letters that have arrived for them since their arrival. Both had received multiple letters from their respective friends most of which were wondering where they both were and if they were alright. Draco's friends only knew about his injury due to the Slytherin damage tracking spell in the Common Room. Both boys had one exception among the letters that were sent to them. Draco had been shocked to receive a letter from Heir Longbottom who apologized for causing him to sprain his ankle. Harry's letter which was different from the others came from Ron who besides asking where Harry was was more concerned with the fact that due to "Harry" capturing He-Who-Should-Not-Be-Named, Gryffindor had gotten the points back that Harry, Hermione, and Neville had lost due to Norbert. Ron had been rather excited as he wrote about a party Professor Dumbledore had arranged the day before as he awarded Harry over 250 points, which his best friend was happy to report that unless the Gryffindor Team lost their match in Quidditch they would win the House Cup.
"He is here, Narcissa, due to a complaint I got about the Medi-Witch who is stationed at Hogwarts. Arriving there I found that she had not even treated him for an injury he received last night, nor had she properly done her job in collecting the medical history of another student which is why we are not alone," Lucius said before he introduced Narcissa to Harry.
The next thing Harry knew his pain had started to vanish as Draco pulled him into a tight hug. Harry wanted to fight it not really liking the other but found his body seemed to act on its own as it curled into Draco's warm embrace. "There, there Little One everything is alright now you are safe," Draco said his voice sounding nice and warm and holding none of the scorn or uppity attitude that Harry was used to. Harry found the voice and the warmth of the other's body to be rather comforting as he soon found himself drifting off to sleep.
"Harrison is fine. I take it you are Draco's Aunt Andromeda?" he asked.
"Alright that answered the Marriage Contract, I guess for now, but what is an Inheritance Test?" Harry asked.
As Harry was taking a shower and getting ready for his meeting with Draco the blonde Alpha was taking care of some business as he wrote to his Aunt Andy to ask her if she would meet him at King Cross at the end of the term to discuss something very important. Most people would never guess that he and his mother were in contact with his Aunt and family due to them being banished from the Black family line due to the previous Head of the House, Walburga Black. But after her death and her two sons and Heirs missing and imprisoned all of her banishment to any living member of the Black Family status had been changed to under advisement until a new Head took over. So Draco had been able to meet and play with his cousin Nymphadora since he had been six years old and she was thirteen and did not see it changing anytime soon.
"Oh I came to it, I was a bit late but I came," Draco said once more looking away from him.
"In a way, but I also wanted to meet you after all as I said you are famous in our world, and I have heard so much about you from the Weasleys. I would beware of Ginny if I was you she fancies that she will one day be your wife. Not that that could happen now that you have presented, but as she thinks of me as an airhead she has talked about brewing some love potions to give to you," Luna said.
