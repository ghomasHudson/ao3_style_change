The one the left, dropped his veil to show a smooth dark face. "Prince Harry and his subordinates, we present to you Prince Draco of Slytherin state, the sole heir of the Malfoys and the next in line." Harry noticed the person in middle, he couldn't make out any of his features, even his eyes were covered with the fabric- only his was bejeweled with silver thread and pearls. The addressed Prince Draco nodded his head with a slight tilt. The being on his right, removed her veil, revealing a woman with upturned nose and a sneer. "As per the note sent to you, we have indeed invited you here to discuss an important matter." She starts. "Because of the recent affairs and impeding effects of the upcoming dictator who goes by the name of 'Dark Lord'; our Prince, Draco, has come to a decision to marry the Prince of Gryffindor, Harry Potter."
"He can control animals too!" When asked further, Draco told them everything the king had told him, along with the assumption he could make. Harry did get angry as Draco hadn't called him when his father woke up, but he let the matter drop. They hadn't made any progress, but they did find that the Dark Lord's mark could work on animals too. Wolves and snakes were a lot in population in the forests of Slytherin. And that would give him an army of dangerous creatures as well. An attack of his on Harry's own father gave the Prince a new fresh motive to get revenge on this Dark Lord.
"Well I don't like it." His hair turned orange then turned purple. "Don't throw tantrums around me. You didn't even eat the sticky ones last time. I had to throw it all away." The hair turned yellow then mellowed to platinum.
"Yes. And it's just five thousand." I slipped on my boxers and one of Harry's loose shirts. Harry always loved when I wore one of his shirts, it made me look 'small' and 'innocent' according to Harry. It also was a point towards the direction 'come-Harry- fuck-me-slow-and-deep' way. I could see his length hardening through his sweatpants and he was moving towards me slow and steadily.
"I'm sorry, Harry. But I have kept him in a stagnant stage. I gave him sleeping potions and healing aids so that his condition wouldn't worsen. My intention wasn't to harm him." Harry turned to look at him, and under his gaze Draco felt quite scrutinized.
"You behave like such a wanker and then you give me flowers and waffles and coffee. I can't even stay mad at you."
"Yes. It is beautiful." Pierre said to him with a wink. They were at a corner of the hall and soon a small crowd was forming in the middle, and right in the exact
Also- a few chapters wouldn't have 'sex' in bold terms cause I wanted this fic to be plot based and not porn based.
"May I ask as to what's the situation here?" He had a deep voice.  Draco was sure he enhanced and glamoured it quite well, because his voice echoed and resonated off the walls. It was eerie but good.
"No, you're not." I lean down to kiss him and he moaned in my mouth. I never understood as to how he made every moan of his filthy, wanton and graceful, all at the same time. He then fell onto his knees and looked at me with smug eyes before taking my length in his mouth. I didn't even last five minutes, he drank all of the release like a thirsty man. "I need to get the Vite Grous Potion today." He said as he lapped  up remaining cum and I rolled my eyes.
"You're the King of this state. You should be able to think and make decisions whatever the situation is. You-"
They rubbed their bodies with the cold water for a while, before they got out and met with their people who were awake and were breaking their fast, of course after wearing their robes.
"Um- yeah. I always have the need to still be connected to wizarding world." Harry could see that on the plants itself. They weren't the one discovered by the muggles yet, but were famous in magical side. They felt more alive, more moving. They were quite expensive,  he didn't know how Malfoy even managed to acquire them. Malfoy pointed to the A/C and Harry moved forward to inspect it. He removed the case and looked inside.
Harry would have broken the seal if he hadn't placed it on the side of the table before Malfoy spoke. His jaw clenched but then he calmed his facial expression when he Malfoy look away from him and his Adam's apple bobbed. "Yeah, sure!" He forced a smile on his face, and saw Malfoy smile brightly at him.
"He works for the military. Muggle ones. Says he wants to fight for the country. Says he wants to die for it."
"Way too nicely. And you're tipsy already. Normal people dance or should I say grind, to get rid of that. Or they drink more. They don't chat to random strangers."
Harry flopped, carefully though, on top of him, huffing in his ear. Draco let his arms wrap around him, holding him close, not wanting him to move away. He was still shivering when his legs wrapped around the other's waist. With the huffing in ear and a loud beating of his heart he drifted off to sleep before he could notice.
"Wh-why would someone do that? I knew muggles were uncouth, but this just crosses the limits. If I were in magical side, no one would do this. No wizard is ever so disgusting. I'm tired of living here. Amongst these degenerates." Draco was seething by the end, shaking with fury now. "I wish I could just go back." Harry leaned back holding the fair face in his hands.
The thing is- Ron knew that harry was turning insane. Who wouldn’t though- anyone who died yet came back for a retry at life, was bout to go crazy in head. Hermione didn’t believe him. He told her after their last time fucking, on a rainy Tuesday night, in Fred’s bed- the mattress creaked aloud and Ron was sweaty. She told him he was thinking crazy. He tried again- on the train to Hogwarts, Hermione told him to shut up.
"Yeah Daddy!" I didn't imagine I had said that out loud, but I may have. My eyes were wide when he pulled me down and instantly turned us around, so that he was on top. His balls brushed against the shirt I wore and he lolled his head back as he moaned again. "Oh yes, Daddy!"
"Now, Baby. Salazar here is quite a poisonous snake. I researched about it. One bite of his and you'd be shaking in seizures instantly. You wouldn't want that would you? So stay still, or I'll make him bite you." The tears were rolling down the cheeks and Harry wanted nothing more than to jump in joy. But he controlled himself. "Right Baby?"
Ron clapped me on my back. "Kingsley would be pleased." I rolled my eyes at the exact thought process. "soon to be Head Auror captures the dealer and would be present in the interrogation sequence to show off his skills. You should read the rules before going in though."
I suppose Draco wasn't impressed too when I came back home. It was late, the case took up much of our time and then there were a few Muggle officers (some military commanders as well) who had arrived just an hour after our arrival which delayed our investigation. But it was brunch time when I came back and I knew Draco wasn't impressed. He wore a frown as he sipped on his tea. I was about to apologize but he stopped me. "Where were you Harry? You didn't even leave a note or anything. I was worried sick, I had to floocall too many people for your sake!" His mouth was pinched and I had to stop myself from wincing.
He made a face with a pout. "You don't expect me to call you 'Dark Lord' as we slither on top of each other, do you?" He didn't expect a pull on the hair at his nape. The man raised himself up and Draco had to raise his gaze up.
He hears a snort. "You aren't even looking at me. Open your eyes Draco." Draco opens his eyes slowly, looking at the wet face of the Prince. "too beautiful." He gasps when Harry leans down to kiss his jaw and then his neck. A felt a small suction on his skin and Draco couldn't help but moan at it.
Draco mumbled that he was tired and I excused us both. Victor just smiled and waved us off as I apparated us both to our house. I had wanted to ask Draco so many questions. But I stopped myself when he fell on me with sigh. I carried him to the room and changed his clothes, so that he could take an evening nap.
"Okay I think that's enough Ron!" Harry groaned slamming his face first onto the desk. Ron hopped from the desk, poking at the wild mess of the hair.
He looked utterly delicious in it, and I still remember how we almost broke the hotel bed cause of that. Maybe his purchases aren't that bad, but they are useless and expensive.
Draco didn't know how to answer that, he looked at the loaf of bread being taken out of the oven. The smell reached his nose and his stomach growled involuntarily. Although it wasn't proper, he couldn't stop it. He had barely eaten since last afternoon. The dinner had been nothing but a nibble on the fruits. He looked at her with flushed cheeks.
He turned to face his peers who looked at him back. "That was very brave of you Neville!" He smiled at the burly man who just gave him a bow.
Draco stopped short when he heard Potter sigh loudly. The classroom might have been too cold with unuse because he saw a puff of air emerge out from his lips. “Was it Goyle?” This time Potter gritted out, his teeth clenched and his eyes serious- long gone was the playfulness. Draco knew that if he tried to run away Potter would hex him- probably with something that would make him never able to walk again.
"There was a picture of him, looking at you like you hung the moon for him." Draco moaned when Theo lapped at his neck. "What else did he want?" Draco wasn't able to reply for a few moments for way too many reasons, but Theo was adamant.
"Who discovered them? Where are we getting these intel from anyway?" I asked the junior Auror and he visibly shrank.
"Uh- yes. It's splendid. Thank you. Well, do you think if-" the second grey brow raised and Harry stopped himself. "Ah, it's nothing. How much would it be?"
"We all got wasted and slept in the place itself. When I woke up I had a girl on top of me." My eyes were blazing and he saw that, because he hurried to continue. "She said that we slept together, she was wearing her pants though and so did I. But then two weeks later she comes by the office and says that she's pregnant. And she needs a job."
"Dark Lord." He said with his voice as sweet as he could muster, blinking his eyes rapidly. "I feel such affection for you right now." He said slowly.
“P-potter!” Draco called out to him as he loosened his tie. Draco struggled, he surely did try but Potter was strong, when his wrists were tied behind his back and all he was left doing was gape openly. “What are you doing?” he hissed at the other boy- his cheek was punched and Draco felt his tongue split. He swallowed the blood and sipped back his tears.
." Harry felt like she would have lost her mind right there and then, when Draco brought one of her hands down and felt at the point where both of them were joined with a soft whimper.
According to him, Potter acted like a fool- to smile and grin and chuckle all round the clock. Draco didn't say anything and sat on the chair, Prince jumping onto his lap. He
Harry moved back, not before pressing soft kissing onto the mark which looked oh-so-red under the calm yellow light. "I'm your husband, I can do whatever I want to you."
"Weasel is right there that's why!" He pushed again and this time he was successful. He quickly stood up, only to fall to his knees. "What the fuck did you do to me?" Harry only rolled his eyes.
"I-it's y-you?" The words were supposed to be accusing but came out as massive shock. "b-but everyone said you died of typhoid!"
"Nowhere." The fingers grabbed at his jaw, tugging him closer to the snake like face. Red eyes looked at him with a piercing gaze, the slitted eyes seemed to slit even more.
"You work for the Dark Wizard." Harry stated out, and the snake hissed repeatedly. He realised it was laughing.
"He'll know. And if anyone has his sigil on his body he can control at the person in any way possible." Harry looks at his with unsurity.  "I swear it's the truth. We can't speak out his name."
He walked back fast but in a daze, he didn’t notice when he had come to lying on his bed. It was after dinner when Greg came back and Draco had to suppress a gasp as the former was all black and blue, his lip split and his eyes swollen. When Draco moved to help him, Greg pushed himself back against the wall, shaking his head. Draco wouldn’t have stopped if it wasn’t for the pleading look in Greg’s eyes.
"Shh..." Potter hushed him quiet. "You don't want others to hear, right?" His gaze went towards the door and he realised he hadn't locked it. The two bars weren't there. A hard pinch in his hip brought him to glare sideways at that man. "So tell me, Draco, how loose are you?"
"You're in me." She whispered and Harry nodded her head. "Inside of me. I feel you too." Her grey gaze shifted from one eye to other till she rolled her eyes when she gave a soft clench. "Salazar save me and mine!"
He gulped. "I know a potion that can heal him. Magical properties are there in his blood. So- the potion can help purify it."
He nodded his head again. "they are the important people of Slytherin. Ministers, commanders, richmen, governors. They all have his mark now and he can control them. Some of them might be of Ravenclaw as well." He took the note back again. "You, Harry. You need to start planning. You need to help me. My father - he'll die otherwise." He could feel his eyes tear up slightly and Harry felt his heart clench. "Please." He whispered the word. Harry held his face with his palms, making him look into his eyes.
He shook his head. "I didn't. But I will, from tomorrow. Now that my potion is done, I can make this one. It's quite intricate that's why I didn't start it before itself, cause even my potion was difficult."
He hadn’t expected Minerva Mcgonall to send him an owl to attend his eighth year and he hadn’t ever expected that his mother would convince him to go. He couldn’t feel the rushes and bustles around him, only could he think about was that he would see Potter and his golden skin again, catch another glimpse of his emerald like eyes, maybe even hear his voice. He didn’t expect Greg to join him, as well.
Anxiousness came back threefold to him and he walked slowly to the drawing room. Theo looked tired when he flopped on the couch. "Aren't you happy to see me, love?"
"Of course he does!" I couldn't help my tone to not sound venomous at all. Victor took a step back. Good. "He calls you of all the people."
just hit me so wrong of Victor, that I wanted nothing but to punch his all straight jaw. It just felt like he hid something  from me.
“I’m sorry,” He looked down to see miniature trees and posts and the ground which looked so small from the height they were at. He was sure that Potter wouldn’t have heard him, but Potter had come closer and Draco felt heat of closeness on his back- Potter was right behind him! His back stiffened when a large palm was placed on his nape. Just one small shove, and Draco wouldn’t even stop himself from escaping the fate of lack of inertia and willingly gone down to meet the grass headfirst. Just the way Dark Lord had. But Potter had wound an arm around his neck and pulled him back.
The young lad, who had pressed himself on the brick wall finally spoke. "This man was trying to rob me and then even threatened to obliviate me." His voice stammered badly, but he managed. "The blond over there was just trying to help."
But his glare melted away quickly when a wide tongue licked at his entrance. "No, my Prince!" Draco tried dropping his legs which he hadn't realised were in the air. "not there!"
He gulped before replying feeling his Adam's apple bob against cold skin of the palm. "I want to feel the power. I want to feel it too, the excitement of the magic even though I don't have any." He let out a small sigh when he saw the thin lips slide into a smirk. His cheek was kissed then, all wet and he was sure there was a purple mark left on his cheek bone, then the lips nipped at his earlobe.
"Why does it have to be today?!" He falls to the floor. "In midst of all this. Draco is tensed about his own father, Ravenclaw is being taken over, father's bitten by some wolf and a snake and we have no idea how to stop this mad man. On top of that I'd have to birth an offspring!"
"A war?" The man laughed. "There will be no war, young King. You will hand me your kingdom just like the others."
He calls in the servant again and tells him to send a message to counselor Granger- "a wedding takes place tonight, bring along the snakes too." He sees the servant taking in the almost naked form the pale prince with distracted and droopy eyes, that makes him hot in the head, shouting at the poor servant to be out of the tent at once. He gets a red robe with golden borders and slips it on the other Prince, after making him stand up with care. "We ride now." He says when he hears close thumping of hooves of a few horses nearby.
Harry refrained himself from saying that. Hermione would have reprimanded him on making goo-goo eyes at his own secretary. He was pretty sure it went against the morals of employment. "You told me once that there were a few creatures in the forests of Malfoy Manor, right?"
"My- my! Such eagerness." Harry only grinned. He grabbed the arse again, and pushed himself up, opening his mouth to suck at the red head. Grey eyes rolled back, a satisfying sigh leaving the pink lips. Harry pulled him in more taking more of the length. His tongue swirled at the underside and one of fingers circled at the rim, tapping at the hole randomly. Harry gave a hard suck, he heard a loud moan. When he looked up he saw Draco's eyes screwed tightly, his head tilting back and he saw his hold on the gun loosening. This gave him a powerful déjà vu, but the gun was unpinned right now. He carefully put one of his hands on the weapon, caressing the fingers which held it, and locked the pin back in. It was quite difficult, but Harry knew he had much more experience than the man above him. He put his hand back on the plump arse. Draco was frantic as well, pushing in and out to get more friction.
"I didn't say the it was warm." Harry laughed at his expression. "I said it was the perfect temperature- to shock you."
He groaned above me and I moaned beneath, as we both came at the same time. I didn't spill anything except a drop or two, but Harry filled me up from inside. As he softened I could feel some drop out. When he tried to slip out, I held him. "Stay inside, please." I know my eyes were wide, and I know I looked wanton and way too needy, but he stayed, kissing me deeply. He held me too close to him, and I could hear him breathing me.
By the time morning had come Draco learnt a few things. He would have to address his husband as 'Harry', last night's memories and the lovebites ranging from his neck to his hips were a solid proof of that, each biting representative of each time he said 'my Prince' and Harry telling him to call him by his name. He couldn't snark out at anyone, it wasn't considered proper in Gryffindor. Ron and Hermione were Harry's best of friends since childhood, and even though Hermione was not of royalty leneige, she would be treated the same as like the Prince and his general. Draco had rolled his eyes at that, but that had earned him a bite mark on his hip, which was still prominent in the morning light. He woke up slowly, looking at his new surroundings, at his new home, before looking at the sleeping face of the Prince, whose arm was wrapped around his waist while Draco's own leg was thrown over tanned limbs. He got out slowly and lead himself the bathroom to wash himself up. It was wee hours of the morning, and Draco thought it would be a fine idea to explore his surroundings. When he came out of the bath, he was wearing a soft cotton night dress  and he saw Harry was still asleep. He didn't want to wake him up, so he lead himself out.
The troop decided to follow the major  river which passed through all the four kingdoms. Even though it passed through the forest it was the fastest and the coolest way to follow by. It was a long ride, but because of the haste they made they had reached the palace by the night fall. Harry and Draco hadn't talked through out the journey. The Slytherin Prince and his mates rode behind the Gryffindor lot. Harry did want to ask if it was necessary to bring along the green clothed subordinates of his, but then he realised that he would have done the same with Hermione and Ron.
He had to force himself to not gape at Malfoy. His hair looked golden in the bright yellow lighting and his silver grey eyes seemed to glow like amber. Even though he didn't gape, it seemed Malfoy couldn't stop himself from doing that, but he quickly composed himself to form it into a deep sneer which truly didn't suit him. "Potter." That was the only greeting he was going to get from Malfoy, he knew that and nothing else more. Harry took in his attire and was sort of surprised to find him in a comparatively simple garb. He wore a light pair of trousers, with cream shirt and an over coat of lighter shade- the outfit looked expensive and cheap at the same time, but Malfoy looked much put together than Harry did. Malfoy looked at him with narrowed and pushed his ungelled hair behind his ear, and shifted slightly. He realised he was not letting Malfoy out of the washrooms, but then he realised that somehow he didn't want to.
A huge, massive snake jumped out from the shrubs. It's mouth open and fangs dripping with poison, tongue hissing viciously. The Weasley's jumped back and the snake gobbled a horse down, all full. Harry realised how big it was, longer and thicker than his own body. He refused to back down. He pushed Hermione and she went behind the trees on the right side, then he raised his palm up infront of his face and moved it front then back. The men understood and formed a sturdy circle around the snake.
"I want to get even closer." He then rolled his eyes. "Well, at least you didn't pretend to cheat on me."
"A siren? Do they exist in real?" Draco looked at him with bright silver eyes, a blonde brow raised in challenge.
Thank you so much for reading this until here. Means so much that there's someone out there who has the same view point as I do in seeing these two nops in such plot, which would feel hilarious to anyone else not into this fandom. Please tell me how and if you like it or not, you can point out my weaknesses and criticise. That really helps me improve myself. If you're reading this whole fic at once you're gonna notice change in style and tempo and rhythm, I mostly improved though. Help me in that too? Thank you again.
"Please. Lord please!" He screamed out aloud when his back arched and  he spurted out in long ropes on his stomach. Harry groaned from top, spilling immediately inside of him. He fell on top of him and both of them laid panted.
"Missing you, actually. I'm not lying." I rolled my eyes and then realised he couldn't actually see me. "What are you doing tonight?"
In middle of the night, almost close to two; I woke up feeling cold and stiff, I was sure I had put on the covers well on me and Draco sticked to me while he slept, his limbs around me like a giant octopus. I wavered my hand on the bed before opening my eyes to a blurry vision and put on my glasses, my hand met with a strong back. I furrowed my brows and casted a very low Lumos. Draco had his back to me, what caught my eyes was a sight way too adorable. Teddy was snuggled to his chest, his hair greyish brown (which reminded me of Professor Lupin) his arms around the man's torso and Draco cradling his head close to him. I felt a wide smile come onto my face when I saw that they both had stolen the blanket. I adjust the covers as I wrap my arms around both of them, kissing the nape of my husband.
"I can't." I sighed in a mocking way. "My husband's in your house and I need to give him this." I point at the large bouquet in my hand. It cost me fifteen galleons.
"Don't care." He mumbled and kissed him furiously. Draco gave in and wrapped his arms around his neck. "I'll get you ten more like this if you want."
"Oh Merlin, Arthur and Salazar. What if it goes awry? What if it I fall? No, of course not- But what if I slip? Well, I'm not a klutz, am I? Yet I could drop the brush and then the whole thing could be destroyed. And everyone would laugh, or gape or snicker at the very least. That's how posh men are, fall and they ask you if you're alright but behind your back they snicker, buggering old fools." Harry felt a smile glide onto his face when he related to the same thought, as he hid himself behind the wall. The voice did feel familiar but he just couldn't place where he had heard it before. "I don't have butter fingers, do I? But what about third year, I kept on dropping the salamander eyes and got in so much trouble. No, I am not going to trip and I'm not going to drop anything. I'm going to go there and do everything perfectly. Right? Oh Merlin! I'm gone mad. I'm talking to myself!" Harry quickly placed a hand on his face to cover his mouth so that he didn’t leave even as much as a squeak, he was on the verge of laughing. "Alright. smile and make Mother proud. And stop talking to yourself! What if someone hears you?" There was a gasp and a mumble of okay. The man then washed his hands and Harry had very little time to recover himself when Draco Malfoy came into view.
"Ron." Harry interrupted him. "he understands. What are you thinking, Malfoy?" The blond was biting his lip as he looked down and was in a deep thought.
"Mr Flemming, your wand has a crack in it. That causes your spells to miscast. And then there is a stubborn sense of guilt in your mind, regarding your son. You miss him every moment. You don't pay attention to the proper wordings of the cast. Spells require proper attention." I could have said this in the healer room, people don't really pour our their feelings there though. And this gave me a perfect chance for my own selfish reason. I finished my cake and let Flemming think. I broke him out of his trance. "Can I have a sip of your drink? My mouth is too sweet." He did a nod and I picked up the tea and gulped a small sip. Of course from the untouched edge though. I wouldn't want to kiss his lips indirectly. He was hardly my type, belging short and stout and the ray of pepper hair which didn't really suit him.
He winced and turned around to face the window. So I opened the curtains- no way was he getting any nice sleep. "Draco, babe, could you shut the windows." I don't reply to him. It was already  eight thirty, and he had to always reach his office by nine. Considering the amount of sleep he would have gotten last night, I presume that he wouldn't wake until ten. I got dressed quietly and closed the curtains as well. I even chose to apparate out of our house, to not make any sound, when I left for Mungo's. The day was going well.
Hermione was on an armchair, rubbing her belly and reading a heavy book. "Oh Harry!" She tried to stand up but I ran towards her and gave her a hug instead and pushed her to sit again. "How have you been- Harry, what happened?" Just one look at my face and she knew something was wrong. Ron went to the kitchen and got two bottles of beer and water for 'Mione. I sat on the couch and after taking a long sip, I told them everything. How I strongly disliked Victor and Draco never told me anything of his outings, and then the matter of Sunday. She listened quietly, Ron did too but he made a few comments around. "I fucked up." I concluded.
"Oh, I think you mean the one on the first turn?" Potter blinked in affirmative. "It would be closed by now, unfortunately. It opens up early and closes early too, it's mainly for office goers, you see." Potter looked like a kicked puppy.
"Okay." Ron dragged out a cigarette box from his trousers which I knew Hermione detested with all her heart, so he'd smoke at times not infront of her. And it wasn't as if I could tell her about it because when Ron handed me a stick I gladly took it and lit it up with my wand. "Officer Flemmings sounds familiar, doesn't it?" Ron just shrugged in reply.
"You're keeping yourself busy quite fine, aren't you?" I shouldn't have : I shouldn't have said that. Especially not in the way I did, full of mirth and a sneer forming on my mouth.
"N-no, My King." Draco shook his head. "oh merlin, please stay still. I'll get Harry." Before he could move he felt the old but strong hand on his wrist.
"Well, it was just a meet. And he is a nice gentleman. He is as old as my Father, Harry. Are you doubting me?" For the emphasis I pout my lower lip out.
A hand went to his length, gripping it, but Draco scratched the hand away. "No! No! Like this! Wanna come like this Potter!" Two more thrusts and then it stopped. Draco whined out aloud, his grey opening in confusion when he widened with shock. The hands he had clasped on the headboard were no longer there and were instead holding his waist to a halt. Before he could reply, he was turned to let his back meet the soft bed and a weight situation on top of him. His legs were thrown on the wide shoulders and Harry drove into him deep, making him arch his back. Harry thrusted in him at an inhumane speed and every time he hit the sweet spot making Draco squeal louder than before.
"I taught him everything I knew. But he learnt somethings on his own. One can never stop someone from learning."
"From what I have come to know, with the spies and everyone, this Dark Lord has hidden his main life force in three things. I referred a lot of ancient books and I concluded that a being, of strong yet dark heart, can split his life force in three things- a warm blooded, a cold blooded and a non blooded. This gains him a powerful magical core and involves a lot of blood magic. I did a quote more research and the way he makes slaves of people is only cause he takes their life force and makes them his own. He inputs darkness in their minds and they loose their heads and succumb into his will and wish." She gulped audibly before continuing. "we already know the two things which involves his life force- the wolf and the snake. They probably had black magic in them."
Draco counted till ten before replying. "I do. With ways you pamper me, I don't think I can stay mad at you for more than a few days."
It wasn't 'Potter'. Not her last name, nor her full name. Not Harriet. No. It was Harry. Just Harry.
Harry sighed the twenty-second time when the dressing man shifted the blue fabrics over the black ones and shook his head. "Why are we doing this again, Hermione?" He groaned out. He knew why, it happened every year since past five years. The City Hall was decorated in posh and pomp, celebrities were called in, expensive wines were spilled and auctions were held to celebrate the day when finally all of wizarding Britain was back to normal after a year of battle mournings and healings. And Harry, himself, was considered the Man of Honour and was expected to give out proper speech, which was drafted by Hermione and edited by Kingsley, Harry made people cry by the end.
"Draco." Harry held up his hands to hold others in a comforting grip. "We're trying our best. Your father will be safe and sound, nothing - I promise - nothing will happen to King Lucius. Ron's team is already in the Ravenclaw forests. A howl of wolf is heard during midnights and they get closer and closer to it." He brought one of his hand to brush at his husband's blond fringes. "Who is this Dark Lord though? What is his name?"
“You thought that you want a cock- but because Harry Potter didn’t give you one.” It was hard not to nod his head at that but he controlled himself.
Draco took a very long bath with hot water. He was sure to spend at least an hour in their and another half an hour moisturising himself with the lavish oils and creams. He let his hair dry in the bath itself and when he came out, all clean and smelling good, he let out a small gasp when he saw the whole room covered in flowers of different colours and sizes and long twines of weed and branches hanging from the ceilings. In the middle of the room a small table was put with a nice set of breakfast having Draco's favourites. He looked around and saw Harry grinning at him by the balcony. "I thought we could have a breakfast with the flowers, as you belong amongst them." He walked towards him with a bunch of lillies in his hand. He put a hand behind his pale back and pulled him closer and gave him the flowers. Draco looked at it with narrow eyes. He turned around and sat on the bed crossing his arms on his chest. "Draco, would you please?"
He was cut off by loud rustle of plastic bag in Teddy's arms who ran back between us. "She has a date with Mr Brown. He owns a house near ours, and an apple garden!"
"Potter-" he only managed to get out two syllables when Potter slid down his trousers along with his pants and a loud hit came down into the middle of his arse, just between his crack, just above his hole. "What the fuck!" He yelped out.
Malfoy had pushed her a bit too hard and Harry's head hurt slightly with the thump sound it had just made where the back of her skull met the wooden partition. The painted fingers grabbed at the collar of her jumper and Malfoy pulled the fabric, looking Harry straight in her eyes. "You will accept what you're doing, Potter. You have been staring and ogling and winking and bringing me all sorts of things- which if a person of opposite gender did towards me, it would be considered as courting!" She snapped at her, her pinks lips so close. Malfoy was a few inches taller than her, even then she had pushed herself onto her toes.
"Greyback!" The Dark Lord's voice boomed. "Get back to the watch sites and use your eyes instead. I'll cast the spell from here quite soon."
"I know you can't promise, so it is just a say. Do try to stay away from him, don't let him touch you in any way that it is..." He couldn't say more. Draco understood though and he gave him a sharp nod before leaving, leaving the cell in black bleakness.
"I will. What have you done to save him? It was all about you and your kingdom. Never about me or mine."
was casted. Potter kept on blowing the smoke in the air, and somehow it was hard for him to breath. He pushed Prince and the cat mewed before jumping out of his lap, he looked to the side, engaging himself to look out of the window. The pink and purple colours of the sky looked so very beautiful.
She tsked and sat beside him. "everything is going to be okay." She made him look at her. "and I just discovered something." She gave a small smile when he looked at her with wide, inquiring eyes. "there can be a way to stop him."
To his surprise the snake like man just laughed, his laughter booming on the walls and through the corridors. "I understand now. You wouldn't want to see me as your guardian- since we would be doing antics which are only allowed between lovers." Draco shivered in repulse. "I apologize, Draco." He was given a low bow and then the man straightened up again to walk through the halls, the tone was not apologetic at all.  Draco followed him in quick steps even though his calves ached and thighs burnt with rashes.
He might have heard me, cause he turned around quickly, his grey eyes tired and his mouth pinched. He didn't move from his place, so I didn't too. I just stood still at the door of the kitchen. "You're such a prat, Potter!" He snapped.
Draco didn't remember sleeping, but he does remember whispering "can't do it again" and "this is wrong."
"I can't believe it!" Draco was snapping. "Mathew. Out of all the people. I can't believe a friend, I have known for so long, would do something. Then Why? I thought a few muggles were nice. But,now I know. Each and every one of them is a bastard. Fucking uncouth mongrels! I thought I could live here, with a few in my company. If he liked me, he should have told me. I would have helped him, cure him from his homosexuality. But he had be a bastard son of fag and do such." Harry turned to Harry with big eyes. "he laughed! He fucking laughed on me face when I punched. Like he wanted more of my touch. Disgusting Muggle! This is what you fought for, Potter! Pathetic muggles you wanted to save."
She shook her head, a few whisps of her black hair escaped her light low bun (God knows how she makes a bun with short hair). "How could you even doubt him? And with Victor with all of them? Are you serious, Potter? You're a fucking prick!" Her frown dropped when I pulled out a bundle of yellow roses and handed out to her. Her mouth quirked up and I knew I earned her forgiveness when she took them. "Smart, Potter. Very smart."
"Okay. Just listen to the whole thing." I looked at him with a raised brow. "remember that night of Ron's bachelor's? We went to wizarding club? Ron and I, not you, and Neville and Dean and Seamus and I."
"Sir!" He moaned loudly. "Please fuck me!" He jumped upwards, and Harry complied with it. Fucking him like he meant it, hard and deep, again and again hitting his prostate and he could see the pink mouth babble out all the nonsense words mixed with senseful ones like "sir", "lord", "please", "fuck", "yes" and a lot of "oh"s. His hair was spread out on the maroon of leather sofa like a halo, and his eyes were tightly shut. Harry grabbed at his jaw to suck at his mouth. When he leaned back he couldn't resist the red of his lips.
"And you don't even have sex with me now. It always just a fucking quick fuck for you!" I smacked on his chest again.
: I was planning to have Draco go forward and have sex with Voldemort. That was in my original draft. But then I remembered - Draco and Harry are committed to each other and have a magical bond. Also, I don't like sad and tortured Harry or Draco. Hence it turned out be a plain seduction of wizard. Which I again think is a bit risqué, but who cares right? *Nervous laugh* also that Draco puking on Greyback scene, that one's my favourite. (that's crack people, please don't hit me). Also I don't support animal cruelty, Greyback is a monster tho.
"Sure am." He winked and I rolled my eyes. I walked to the apparation point and side-alonged him to our house. "Would you want something eat or drink?"
The first time she saw Malfoy after Hogwarts, in the Ministry Training Programme, she was shocked. Albeit, Malfoy was pardoned, that too on Harry's own guarantee, but she had thought that the blonde would be out of the country soon as she got the chance, just like her parents- not surround herself with those members of community who would put her in Azkaban on the first chance they got. She was awry of her at first, but then everyone was. Harry still remembered, Malfoy would sit under the oak tree of the training field during lunch, in a yellow or blue or green calf- length dress holding an apple and a book in her hands during the lunches. While Harry sat with Ronny and Herman and others who joined them, which included a huge plague of crowd, she could only see Malfoy and her peace and her loneliness. The training got over pretty fast and she couldn't gain the courage to walk up and talk to Malfoy within those six weeks, she cursed herself there after, because for the last five weeks she saw Malfoy climb on top of her, unbuttoning her way-too modest dress and kissing Harry with as much fevor as the other could muster, but all in her dreams.
"I want a pistachio and black current sorbet." He knew Rose would make an amazing attorney when she'd grow up.
, which of course meant ordered him, to come to the court. He had found some special guests from Gryffindor. Draco's heart pounded hard in his ribcage. He took deep breathes and reminded himself that he had a plan to follow through.
"Fine then." He said in a defeated tone. He turned to face his friend. "Ron, you leave tonight." Ron nodded. "Go towards the forests of Slytherin and the joining part of Ravenclaw. Snakes are usually found near the river, so I'm doubting you'd find one of them there. About the wolf, I'm guessing near the hills, the colder areas, but I'm not sure. Take Seamus with you, from what I heard he is interested in wildlife, he'd be excited as well he would know more." Ron nodded again. "a few cable men as well. Well selected and well versed of the locations." Ron stood straighter.
Soon the man was captured. The Muggle woman he had taken hostage was oblivated and sent home in a taxi. It turned out that he was a dealer, fortunately the only one, and along with a few others, he made sure to spread it around the Muggle clubs and dumping of the bodies. He was taken back, his azkaban sentence was pending but interrogation would be done the next day. Kingsley would be pleased.
"No. No!!" The Dark Lord cried out. "What have you done you foolish boy!!" He screamed and shouted, but he couldn't stand still as if he were dizzy with fury, his arms flailed and his legs shivered.  Draco pressed himself close to Harry and Harry held him tight too, one hand around Draco and one hand on the sword. He was ready to strike the crying man if he moved any closer, but he didn't have to.
"Then let me help you instead." I heard a sound of boom and then some loud rustle of people talking and walking.
and Harry did not like to share more than a very little. He arrived at Paradise, one of the strip clubs he jointly owned with rival gangs (He believed in keeping his enemies closer, and probably  his rival thought too), with Ron at his side. Seamus was in the car and Dean was mixed amongst the crowd. He entered the private cabin which still had the same smell of tobacco, leather and whiskey like last time. But unlike last time, instead of meeting a fat, short, non-appealing, older man, he met a tall, blond, lean and quite striking Draco Malfoy. He sat on the desk while some other man stood beside him. Harry looked at the couch and saw his rival on the couch, handcuffed, and two policemen holding him by his shoulders. That's when he heard the loud wailing and lights of the police cars through the window. His jaw clenched as he looked at the blond.
Ron starts to say something but Harry pats his shoulder. "It'll be fine Ron. We leave now. I hope him and his men are ready." He walks out of the tent, towards his black horse where he sees three figures now completely covered from head to toe, as he had seen them before. He nods his head at them and then gets on his horse. "it'll be a long way. We have to ride fast."
Malfoy sighed. "It was as if he had a stick stuck up his arse. All he did was talk about politics and culture and traditions. I felt as if I were talking to one of my father’s mates. And he's such a coward!"
I give a quick glance at the wet bodies, laid all straight, All of their skin greying and scalding with large burns. Fucking Xellophilus and it's producer. "Where's Auror Weasley?"
He fell back cupping his cheek as he glared at the standing man. "why the fuck did you slap me?" He sneered at him.
"I'm fine. I'm just worried about my father." He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. "My Uncle wrote me last night. I hope you know this all well by know- the Dark Lord has taken over the Ravenclaw Kingdom." Harry nodded his head quietly. "And my Father, even though if he's in all the way on Slytherin throne- he counts the last two days of his life." A tear rushed past his cheeks, and he brought his pale hand up to dab at it.
"Sure. Nice seeing you again, after such a long time." Harry doubted Malfoy heard him, because as soon as he shifted Malfoy brushed past him to the exit- his coat brushed by his arm and Harry smelt the warm scent of chocolate and spices from Malfoy.
In a spurce of moment or call it a hit of luck, Harry shifted her fingers a bit to the right to find a more comfortable position for her wrist and licked right below Draco's quim- the blonde had shot right up with a gasping cry, her eyes wide and them rolling back, "Oh Merlin!" Her fingers tugged at the raven hair hard and Harry grinned in reply, prodding her tongue at the same point. "Wh-what are you doing?"
"Yes, twice. And you haven't brought him here. You're good Malfoy and that's why I want you on the 'Big V' case."
Draco moaned at the friction his face digging deeper into the hollow of Harry's neck. "yes..." Harry squeezed him too hard, making him let out a yelp. "Yes, sir."
The Wizard laughed. "No. I want them alive. Let me just cast a spell-" before he could continue, Draco pulled the Wizard back by his shoulder and turned him to face himself. He thought quick and way too definitely.
Potter only gave him a smile. "I came from the capital office, to solve the 'Big V' case. I heard the Padfoot one is suspended for the time being."
"Oh! I remember him carrying me all the way to Leaky's so that I could floo." My frustration came back twice as much as before. I made myself take a few deep breaths and calmed down, but. It wasn't his fault, Draco was just being ... Draco. I sighed as I got up to bath. A few minutes under warm water, I felt circle of arms around my waist and a soft wet kiss on my nape. "I also remember asking you for a fuck. My wish wasn't fulfilled." He bit my ear. I chuckled before turning around and grabbed his shoulders.
Harry sighed too. As if on cue they heard a loud hoot and a still aided owl swooped in, all brown with yellow and white spots. Harry recognised it as Snape's owl as it came to perch on his forearm. "maybe I can find out a way for us." He said.
It was the fact that he stopped looking at me with that look in his eyes when he first did, when we had started dating. It was the fact that he slept after me and stopped holding my waist. And it was also the fact that when I asked him something he would look the other way and reply as if he was hiding something.
Harry leaned in to place open mouthed kisses in her inner thighs, pressing at the joint of the knee way too hard, that it might bruise later on. She sucked at the hip bones and bit at the stretch marks on her abdomen. "You're amazing, Draco." She whispered against her skin. Draco couldn't have heard her with the way she moaned aloud when Harry pushed another finger in.
"Really?" The blond pushed the bowl into his chubby hands. "Then you can prepare the cookies for us then. Melt all the chips and make it all sticky."
"I'll have some later." Draco slid himself onto the bed, opening his legs wide. "or am I not appealing to your eyes anymore?"
"Fuck you! It took me five salon appointments and a massive haircut." Draco would have punched him, really hard, but at the current moment he didn't have the proper energy to even stand straight. He took a deep breath, tried to calm himself down. "Where's Officer Reynolds?" He looked pointedly at the broken handcuff.
I wasn't just going to stop there. Repeated pursuance is best pursuit. I sent him the sickeningly sweet mocha he likes from Starbucks at exact eleven to his office. And at lunch time I ordered a waffle plate for him, which was lined with gold flakes and truffles. Expensive, diabetic sweet, but if that earned me a sight of his face it was worth it. I planned on cooking him his favourite red sauce pasta that he loved with all his might (it was what I had cooked for us on one of our firstdates, a couple of years  back, and I remember not able to swallow my food because everytime he swallowed he would moan aloud like he was on verge of a climax). But when I arrived home I felt the wards shifted around, as if someone was already there. I carefully walked to the drawing room, the corridors, a small room which Draco had insisted to call tea room even though no one had tea in there, and then finally the kitchen. I sighed when I saw the lean back.
"So you risked my father's life on it. And because of that he's not getting any better." His jaw was clenched and his lips were pressed thin. "you have played with the life of your former King, Draco. You should be punished for this." He stood up and walked to the window, pulling his trousers in the way.
"Malfoy, long time no see." He forced his lips to widen and gave him a grin. Malfoy didn't reciprocate, instead he just stared at him and pinched his mouth. "How have you been?" Harry asked after clearing his throat. He heard the blond breath in and out three times.
Harry didn't want to leave then. "How are you, Malfoy?" He was about to reply when a loud voice of a man called from inside. "Dan!" He straightened, holding the door.
"Do you think I have made a mistake by marrying you?" Harry gasped when a tear roll down the pale, pink blotched cheek. He leaned forward and brushed at it to away.
Draco pushed weakly at her shoulder, even though Harry didn't want to stop, she halted in her movements and came just a centimetre back to gaze into the grey eyes. "We'll do whatever you want, Potter." The blonde panted out. "But - I am not gay. I'm just here, because I know you can give me what I want. I do not like women like you do, though." Harry clenched her jaw, and at that moment she wanted to slap Malfoy and shake her to tell that her mouth was red and her pussy was wet, all because of Harry. "Do you understand, Potter?" Malfoy said carefully.
Draco forced a smile on his face. "Of course, I am." He climbed onto the other man's lap and nuzzled at his neck. "But you stink of sweat and sea." Theo hummed in reply. His hand was raking his blond hair, but then he pulled Draco back by those same strands. The blond winced. "What is it?"
Harry swiped a finger against the slick and pressed hard against Draco's swollen clit, then rubbing it in a clock wise direction. "Do you like this?" She hadn't the need to ask this because just a second before Draco's legs had flown over and her back had arched and she had let out a gruntal moan. But she just couldn't help herself. "Do you?"
Draco pinched his lips. "I don't know, if I should." He shuffled the bag in his arms and Prince was making it hard for him to stand, as it kept on rubbing against his leg.
"I'm not lying!" He slapped the hand away. Theo just raised a brow in return. "It was Potter." He sighed. Theo didn't look surprised at all, in fact he looked pleased.
"Why?" Both of them ask at the same time. I was truly tired to explain in detail and I wasn't in clear mindset too. I just caught a dark wizard, anger was budding in me along with after effects of adrenaline.
The man just looked at him. Draco could hear the repeated 'Draco' and 'come here' but he let them be unheard. "Does the Golden Man sound good to you?" If Draco hadn't known better, he was being flirted with. He let a smile graze his face before letting out a small chuckle. The man then flew away.
"He's a famous bastard. You wouldn't even believe me." I looked down at my lap, a bit resigned. But then he surprised me by pushing a strand of hair behind my ear.
Rose pulled at his hand and he nodded at her. "What is his name?" She asked as she looked at the creature with pure awe.
"You give me a very good idea now." He said something in a mumble and Draco felt all his clothes disappear. He tried to cover himself, but it was all in vain. "what are you hiding for? You didn't have any problem this morning." He grabbed the soft length and stroked it.
Harry breathed in and then out, concentrated hard enough for the spell she had learned from one of her previous sex- friends, during her stay in America. Soon she felt a tingling sensation on her own cunt and heaviness in her hand. "Merlin!" She heard Draco gasp. When she opened her eyes to look down, she weighed the phallus like protrusion in her palm coming out right through her own heat and extended to her clit. It dimly glowed yellow with the residual casted spell. "Is that a..?" Draco didn't complete her question but Harry just nodded her head.
"Father!" He looked at him accusingly. "You dare to sleep with him. With your own son's spouse." James rolled his eyes at the comment.
"My my! Such haughtiness." The man let out a toothy grin, showing his razor sharp teeth. "We will see."
"He's my husband. There's nothing to excuse him of." He sighed. "I'll sleep. I'm ... Tired." She tucked him in. As soon as he closed his eyes he was asleep.
"Please..." Harry melted. She placed her hands on thin shoulders and pressed herself to the other; this felt much more intimate than what they did not ten minutes ago. "Please don't say that, Harry." She winced when she felt hot tears on the skin of her shoulder where she had laid Draco's head with her hand on the mane of blonde hair.
. He left that part out. "I'm just trying to make amends you see." He let out a toothy grin to complete his sentence.
“Harder Harry, please.” I pull at his hair, he never minds it. He bites my chest and goes into me faster. “Yes, please-Harry, just like that.” He loves my cunt and I love his cock. He hits the knot in me, crossing even past it. It stretches me out, it hurts and I’m afraid it will bleed later on, but Harry has this desperate face on his neck that I allow him to do whatever he wanted to me {like the one time he fucked me as I pissed all over his stomach- I cried later on and he just laughed}. The thought makes me clench and he groans at the tightness.
My mouth was set straight when I said again. "And when did you tell me that you had a drink with him last night? Here I thought my husband was working hard on some ill wizard, but he was actually having a laugh in some booth, closely sitting against some unknown man."
Even through Potter held a grin on his mouth, his eyes were cold and hard, it almost made him shiver in his nerves (keyword -
He chuckled wetly. "Yeah, you queer prick. I love you, Harry." I couldn't help myself, I almost ran to him and wrapped my arms around his shoulder and picked him up slightly. He let out a yelp as he hugged me back and I took a step forward to let him lean against the platform of the kitchen. I was whispering a combination of 'I love you's and 'I am sorry's against his skin and it was a relief when he dug his fingers in my hair and brought our lips together. I kissed him like a thirsty man, I was one for him. Always him and no one else. "I missed you immensely." He whispered against my lips.
And now that I recall, marriage shopping is sincerely mind killing. And, Pansy was right, being stressed and wedding-robe fittings doesn't go well together.
"No- just clogged and..." Harry prodded around before denting the gauge with wandless magic. "the gauge is dented."
: my Draco all alone in a bar, drinking something, all by his own: I could imagine his eyes looking hurt on his impassive face.) My heart clenched at the thought. I fucked up.
He had expected not to see Potter for another five years at the very least. Their circles didn't cross, and Draco never really left the area where his flat was in. He rarely visited the wizarding place. He knew Daily Prophet would be having a blast the minute he had left the City Hall, he could already come up with the titles they would have printed. But he forced himself not to dwell on it for too long. He didn't read Prophet after they had written a long essay about his father and how right his life long sentence of Azkaban was, along with Lucius' skeleton like face, on the front page.
Four days had passed without any event, except for the fact that Draco was one day away from consuming his potion. The evening was going to be unlike the previous one, he hadn't realised that. James had called Harry, Draco, Ron and Hermione along with his other ministers into his room. He was still weak and everyone was very worried. He gave a wavering smile to all of them. "you all can see how I am being right now." He started, but got straight to the point as he knew he would fall asleep soon. "the kingdom cannot be in weak hands, and I don't think I'm getting better any soon. My son is already married to a capable and learnt partner," he looked at Draco with a smile, then turned to look at others on by one. "And you all as his loyal benefactors. Harry, I wanted to do this in a grand and traditional manner. But I guess like your marriage, this will take place in a quick and practical manner." He chuckled weakly. "I, James Potter, the king of Gryffindor, now hand over the rule, the throne and the power of Gryffindor and it's attachments to you, Harry Potter; with the people around you as strong witnesses and your direct subjects." Harry's eyes had gone wide and he was speechless. He was going to speak but his father turned to his spouse. "Draco, I'm going to sleep now. Better give me the potions now, I suppose."
"Even my father is at stake here." He murmured. When Harry told him to talk louder, he snapped at him. "Even my father is at stake here!"
I peel my orange and hand him one slice. "Cousin Draco is with his friend right now. He has something to talk about with her."
"It is fine, isn't it?" She asked still a bit unsure of sort, standing proud and naked, ready for just a gesture to breach her magic into Draco.
"Fuck, I'm going to cum!" Draco moaned loudly and Harry gave a hard suck, grazing on top with his teeth. A moment and he felt his mouth full up with hot liquid and Harry swallowed it all down. "Oh my god!" Draco was panting above him. He mewled as his head fell back. "Oh my god!" He pulled himself out, moving a bit back and flopping lightly on the chest. "Oh my god!" He said again. Harry grinned at him. He brought one of his hand to his mouth and covered it with a mixture of spit and semen in his mouth. He didn't wait to push one of his fingers in him and didn't stop until it was till his knuckle. Draco scratched at his coat, panting. He pulled the finger out till the edge and when it went in again another one joined. Draco gasped, groaning when the fingers thrusted in and out of him. The fingers started scissoring in him and he pushed back, moving his hips to thrust. A hand started unbuttoning his shirt and he aided in the action, leaning a bit back to remove the shirt from top. He didn't waste any moment to rub his chest on the coarse fabric of the coat Harry was wearing, and hid his face in the hollow of his neck.
"The Slytherin Prince?" Her eyes narrowed, before softening again. "welcome to our kingdom. Make sure to feel yourself at home, and if you need anything come to me." Draco nodded his head. "You might want to go back to your chambers and change though. You are wearing nothing but night clothes and the day breaks any moment now." He looked down at what he wore and found nothing wrong with it. But then he was pulled by his elbow and out of the kitchen. Harry yelled a bye and then rushed them to their rooms. He was being manhandled since half a day now, and Draco didn't like it. When he was pushed into the rooms and pulled his hand back.
Potter shuffled to come on to the edge of the couch, trying to get closer to him. "What if I want to be? Can I ... Draco?" He whispered his name out yet Draco heard his name out loud as if
“Why did you do it?” Draco couldn’t answer, his voice just wouldn’t come out of his throat and syllables refused to take shape on his tongue. “You said you liked me. Then why did you fucking fuck someone?” Draco didn’t say anything for a while. “Who was it?” Draco shook his head. “What? You don’t know who it was? Were you so desperate for a cock inside of you that you acted like a fucking slut and got fucked by anyone you could find?”
"You know, Louis. Pansy won't be able to repair all this properly. There's a special shop which does the repairing work efficiently although a bit too pricey. I can make someone pay it for you."
"Yet here you are. Having a gun in you like you deserve the fucking thing." Harry pulled the gun out before pushing it again in a slow motion. He continued prodding in and out until Draco's moans grew louder with heated gasps. He then halted his motion, but Draco pushed himself back and forth, faltering when he realised that the prodding had stopped. "if you stop fucking yourself on my gun, I swear I'll shoot it in you and I'll make sure the bullet comes out of your brain." Draco groaned before pushing himself at a faster rate than before. He knees were hurting and his thighs ached but he couldn't stop himself from moving from both fear and arousal. His hair was grabbed in a vice like grip and his face was tilted up to see his reflection on the floor length window. His mouth was open in a wet silent scream. "Look at yourself." His eyes grazed up  to meet tinted-through-window green eyes which looked at him darkly. "you look like a fucking alley slut! Just jumping and fucking on a gun." His movements faltered, slowing his speed, but then he yelped when he felt the sharp thrust of the end of the pistol in him. "Don't stop!" He sped up his hips, his arms giving under him and his arse the only thing in the air, he didn't stop moving though. He could only hear his heavy pants and a  deep chuckle behind him.
"NO!" He bellowed out. "No more reading out for today in this room. I already had you read the Daily Prophet article to me." He pointedly looked at Ron, who shrugged in reply.
“oh, darling – please believe me!” The being above him muttered against his cock. And he shuddered when the wand circled inside him and then thrusted further in.
Draco stumbled back from the mirror, and he gasped so loud that the voice echoed back multiple times from the walls. He would have fallen if it wasn't for the old man- the Professor, holding onto his back. His arms went around his abdomen. "My Father-"
"Nope, that was all her." Harry paid at the counter and nodded at Ron before apparating to a dark alleyway. He had to walk a bit before reaching Malfoy's shop. It was evening and the sun hit directly at the glass windows of the shops. He could make out a comfortable looking café and a few cakes presented at the sills, there were very few people and Harry had the sudden need to visit this place with Malfoy. He knew the other man would be a regular customer of their area, and he just wanted to see him in his comfort zone, so that Malfoy would loosen a bit
"Healer Malfoy, I don't think you can pass judgement-" there was Robards speaking, but he interrupted by her.
"You cleaned me." He murmured. He looked sideways to see his face. "you shouldn't have done that, my Prince."
"Don't call me that!" Draco yelled. "Only my parents, my uncle and very close mates are allowed to a right to address me as such. You don't!"
"Video?" He shrugged his shoulders when I provided him. "Wait ... Did you watch porn? Oh Jesus Christ!" When he didn't reply with anything other than a glare I continued. "Where did you even get to see one- porn?" Of course I had seen porn before. Ron and I watched it together, when we went to muggle London, just after Hogwarts, before the Auror training started. We were all red faced when we rented a CD of it from a dingy, almost unhygienic, shop in some random alleyway and watched it in Charlie's player. I still remember both of us gawking before taking the bathroom break at consecutive times, just five minutes into it. It had become a habit of ours - to do so every weekend and watching various types of porn that there were; and then Hermione found us. An earful of 'how bad porn was for us' had us not go to that alleyway anymore.
"That he is a cunt. You don't need to now." I raked my fingers through my hair, carefully. I picked another glass to sip on it.
The blonde's face was serious, framed in straight damp hair. "I don't feel anything when we have sex." It took a moment for Harry to realise that 'we' meant Draco and Astor. "I thought something was wrong with me. Maybe, something
"What would you have done then?" Draco leaned a bit up, supporting himself on his elbow, looking at him.
Because he was then sweating and his fists were clenched. Good sign. "it's okay, I'll refund it." I shrugged and forced myself to appear nonchalant. I didn't say anything to him and he waited for two whole minutes while I prodded on the bandage, then he left.
Two days passed. Harry found out where Malfoy worked. He had two jobs, one in the morning and one in the afternoon to evening. He worked as a cashier in the first and as a waiter in the other one, in a family restaurant. A lot of office goers would drop by the time and he saw that he got a lot of tips from them. And that had irked something inside of Harry.
would be an understatement. Maybe I didn't have a proper release since past few months or maybe  he was truly a magician with his tongue and hands, hands which were around my waist and tugging at my shirt out of my trousers. His hands then slipped inside, caressing my back before dipping to my hips and holding me firm there. I couldn't help but moan, loud enough I believe.
He leaned closer to me. "I love it though. Dragons, all of them, are breath taking. Don't you agree, little Dragon? I mean- Draco." That was done purposely. And it was brilliant.  I blink rapidly, a light blush was on my face. "Not used to compliments? Looks like it has been a long time since you flirted with someone." That was true. I never flirted with Harry, maybe sometimes, but it wasn't so obvious. This happening now, gave me a thrill. It wasn't right though.
Boy toys! I had to roll my eyes on that, but I stopped, opting to look confused. "Harry, what are you talking about? I was just socialising. And because of this little amount of money you had to spend, Pansy is engaged."
"Your dress certainly doesn't leave anything to wonder about." As if to punish him, Harry twisted the other nipple a bit too sharply. Draco whined.
I quickly dressed in a Muggle attire and left for the case. I didn't leave a note hoping I would come back in a few hours, before Draco even woke up. Ron was there infront of an alleyway where I had just apparated. "Harry, you have to see this!" He gave me a sheet of paper and I glanced through the wordings of a receipt of sort. "50 vials, Harry! 50 vials injected into the bloodstreams of less than a hundred muggles."
"Yes. I know, I told him." I massaged some almond oil on my legs, giving Harry a full view of my thighs. He always loved it when I did that. Said that it gave him a hard on and I could already see first few signs of it.
"Ron!" He came running towards me. "Get someone to inspect these marks." I point at the blackish slashes on the pavement. "These are fresh. He banged against the bin." He nodded his head and shouted at the other men to do so. A few younger aurors came in.
"Draco." He said threateningly. "this better be a joke your whorehouse put up." He felt his inner cheek tear when Draco punched him on his jaw. For a thin man he did carry a lot of weight in his hits. Harry spat the blood out on to the side, staining the light grey sheets with red.
"And the ways you have cursed me and called me names  in more than just one language, I think I do deserve a leeway." When Draco looked at him with a gape, Harry chuckled. "I do know everything that happens around me. And my father and Hermione would tell me- reprimand me, actually, with how have I been with you."
"And why are you so eager that you've lubed yourself up so nicely?" When he didn't reply he got another slap on his other cheek.
Draco had on his second favourite robes that night. They were light blue and they brought out the silver of his eyes like no other robes. He had combed his hair, but then had messed up his hair a bit more with his fingers. He looked debauchable when he checked himself in the glass panes of the passing shops. Rowan greeted him just outside of the restaurant they had planned to meet at. He looked good too, in heavy brown robes and cleanly put up brown hair. Draco smiled at him widely and allowed his hand to be pulled to a peck on the back of his palm. Rowan had everything pre decided for them though. As soon as they sat he called for Vin du Chateaux, a very old wine, probably even older than his father, and a platter of Cold salad. A classic pureblood way of starting any dinner.
"He would agree with anything I say or do. He isn't braindead like yours, but I was brought up with hard measures. And anything for betterment of Gryffindor is favourable."
