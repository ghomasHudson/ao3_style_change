someone shouts in the distance and Harry scrambles to his feet, dodging the impending blow.
“It’s ‘Mione’s orders, mate. I’m sorry,” Ron says apologetically.
“And she would be right to do so,” says Hermione.
Harry’s heart is palpitating and a racing thrill runs through his stomach and lower. There is a smell swirling in his nostrils- something minty and fresh, and it’s not coming from him. He is flickering with tension, a smoldering flame.
for him, especially someone as
However, Professor Caehorn, their new teacher for the subject, had posted last night that the Muggle Studies lesson is concessioned for the first week back at school. It’s Friday now and they have a free period. One being spent awkwardly in the dorm. Hermione and Ron are spending it with Ginny at breakfast. Harry is not, for obvious reasons. He would really rather not listen to his ex girlfriend talk about her new girlfriend, which he is sure Luna is, even if it hasn’t been explicitly stated. Even in his current state of being, he was apparently still able to muster up some complicated mix of misery and anger when he saw them holding hands at dinner the other evening. Ginny’s not his, not anymore, and perhaps never was- but to know that it could’ve been him, had he been able to get it together, hurts so much he sometimes feels like he can’t breathe.
, which Malfoy threw at him a week ago. It was probably their best example of communication as of yet.
“Maybe he isn’t then. The guy of my dreams,” says Justin, and he is staring at Harry with intensity. Staining his skin are the drying tracks from where his tears fell, running all the way down to his rounded chin. There is a pink flush rising high on his cheeks, which Harry is sure matches his own.
Malfoy sucks in two consecutive deep breaths. Nothing is said for a few seconds, but he can sense something is coming, so he remains still. His head tells him that if he moves, he could shatter what’s left of this delicate situation.
-----
No answer, not that he expected one. His stomach feels like it is trying to claw its way out of him and he feels like he is going to wretch. He puts his ear to Malfoy’s lips, waiting for a breath that never comes. All of his suffering has just come down to this moment- this crucifying pinnacle of horror. Malfoy’s unresponsive body, crippled and lifeless like a picked flower, in the same clearing where Harry had once been murdered, is a vision straight from his darkest nightmare.
Blinking, Harry concentrates on his big toe. He really should go.
Time flits by and the sunlight fades with it. His eyes are tired from the strain of staring, especially now that the dark creeps in. He isn’t sure what he is expecting to happen, but the hope he has been holding out for a sudden enlightenment is beginning to crumble. For as long as the paper has been taunting him, he has been imagining wild scenarios in which Malfoy was plotting Harry’s own demise. This seems anticlimactic- practically boring- in comparison. Just a list of ingredients, most of which could be found in Snape’s old store cupboard.
In the background, Harry catches a glimpse of Malfoy looking over at them. His head whips back to his paper before he notices Harry’s wandering eyes, however. Fleetingly, he wonders whether Malfoy is writing a plan on how to bring about Harry’s demise. He will probably wrap it up nicely with a silk ribbon and sneak it to Malfoy Senior in his cell at Azkaban, for his evil, scheming approval.
But then, having wrestled with his thoughts through an unsatisfying, tiresome night, when it hits, it is with a pit straight to his stomach. The transition is overwhelming and he longs for sleep again. The stone in his belly refuses to budge, full of enmity at the idea of having to get up so prematurely. Why is it that just as he manages to sleep, the morning begins? It pisses him off to no end. This world is so deeply cruel and,
Rage has never looked so wonderful, he thinks, observing the confused expression on the boy’s face. Malfoy probably judges him as delirious with the way that he grins wildly back.
With the magnitude of those silver eyes on him, Harry can’t help but remember the last time that he held eye contact with someone. It was about twenty minutes ago, he estimates- unless he really was sprinting through the castle for an hour- and has been firmly locked away in the back of his mind since then. Or so he thought. Now, plump lips hovering over his own is all he can think about, and he begs it to go away, panicked and frightened that he will be found out; Malfoy watches the whole debacle. With one hefty shove, he packs his approaching hysteria away for later. However, as hard as it was, the memory and images start to creep back in with every passing second. Emotions aren’t black and white, and he cannot just turn them on and off with a click of his fingers, as much as he enjoys kidding himself it is possible. Still, he tries.
. With a panic, he notices the light has disappeared. Without it’s company, he feels more lonely than ever and he yearns for fifteen minutes ago, when it pioneered the route like his guardian angel.
But he isn’t, of course he isn’t.
“Oh!” She seems shocked, and Harry can tell that she is used to rejection, “Brilliant! Come right this way, sir.”
now, he guesses- has a habit of making himself scarce just as Harry has worked up the energy to make conversation. He doesn’t really mind- Goldstein owes him nothing, after all- and these days, he prefers to keep to his close friends anyway, lest he has a panic attack. Harry isn’t sure whether he could ever have been considered a social butterfly but he thinks, a little regretfully, that he had certainly been a great deal less closed off than he is now. Perhaps it’s his fault- perhaps Goldstein doesn’t feel welcomed.
poking out of the bookshelves. There isn’t.
Hermione squeezes his hand back tightly, meaningfully, and he immediately realises that she must have sent a warning to Tom ahead of their entrance. His suspicions are confirmed when he sees Doris Crockford almost bursting out of her seat in the corner of the room. Next to her, her friend elbows her side sharply. He turns away uncomfortably, trying to get Hermione to follow him out of the stuffy and tight confinement of the pub. Thankfully, she seems to understand his message and they hasten out, through the brick wall, into Diagon Alley.
, that he stumbles into something hard and unforgiving. The sudden force of it shocks him in his place. Forcing his body to relax is a strain and an upheaval he begs to never experience again. To translate to his muscles that he is not in any immediate danger is difficult, especially when a sense of dread tells him he very well could be.
Yeah, he feels confident that tomorrow will be the day.
When he returns to his dorm room, the corridor is filled with sounds of abrasive shouting. It rocks him, destroying the plan for a peaceful, crisis-free evening that he had laid out for himself on the route back from the library. Someone remind him why he came back to Hogwarts again?
As normal, Malfoy shoots to the bathroom, leaving a blur of black and white in Harry’s vision, a streak of monotone in the warm room.
They seem to head deeper into the heart of the Forest. As the trees thicken, he has to actively work hard in order to steady his breathing and his pulse, which threatens to spike at the next inconvenience. Whatever this is, it seems to be important. It has been a long time since Harry has felt needed; he won’t just throw that away.
“Right,” says Malfoy, uncharacteristically awkward, “That’s- uh- good.”
“Firstly, I’ll begin by mentioning that, as always, the Forbidden Forest is off limits to students and under no circumstances should you venture anywhere near its borders without the presence of a member of staff.” she says, and Harry feels as if she is directing her comment at his area of the Gryffindor table. Somewhere further down the bench, a student yawns exaggeratedly at the information, which is consistently annually repeated, and a chorus of giggles echoes throughout the otherwise silent hall.
In the warmth of the Great Hall, Malfoy looks in a better condition than he had. Eyes a little less hollowed, hair falling in white waves instead of ashy-toned clusters. Despite this, he still retains that blank demeanour that had unsettled Harry so remarkably at in the chill of the courtroom. It has the same effect now.
“I dunno whether an accent that thick can pull off anything quite as cool sounding as Dumbledore, though.” adds Ron jokingly. Harry personally thinks now that Dumbledore sounded everything but cool, as he terrified them all with descriptions of all the ways in which they could die brutally on the school grounds. Very comforting.
He never thought he would say it, but he misses Grimmauld Place for this reason. In all it’s grimness, Ron and Hermione were the sole flowers in the winter. Now it is spring; they still shine just as brightly in the field, but are admittedly easier to lose track of.
, but rather is peering down at them from the quaint Mahogany desk next to his bed, face plastered with an unreadable expression that refuses to give anything away. Harry suspects it probably would say
“You care,” Harry states, resigning himself to an early demise. He is bluffing; he doesn’t think Malfoy gives two shits about him, other than as much as one would be perturbed by stepping in a puddle. Harry is the puddle, if that weren’t clear. “At least a little bit.”
Sighing, Justin places himself down on Harry’s bed, on his right side. There is no answer and Harry curses himself for being so blunt. Fate doesn’t exist, he concludes. He knows this because, if there was, surely Anthony would have walked through that door instead of Harry. And he would have done it a whole lot more stylishly and suave than Harry ever could. Justin runs a hand through his auburn hair, but his ring gets caught. It is made up of two simple silver bands, interlocking with each other in an embrace. Harry has often thought of rings as being garish things, overly expensive for what they are: just a few rocks that some guy baselessly deemed prettier than the other rocks, and metal. Observing this one though, he considers maybe he has been searching for beauty in the wrong places.

Krum yelled and lunged forward, but already the magic had contacted, Morag turning her face away from her upheld arm. Instead of the gouts of blood Harry expected, however, the white light of the spell slid right along the blue knots as though their lines were troughs, collecting it and sending it across Morag’s skin in a magnificent, shuddering swirl. It sizzled up and back, riding the blue so brightly it seared Harry’s eyes, and then abruptly fizzled out, leaving nothing but a single molten drip that fell from Morag’s wrist and vanished halfway to the ground.
“That was constriction?” Krum asked, eyes wide. He stared at the mess of wood. Even the wand’s core element was gone, burnt to an unidentifiable crisp on the rug.
Harry’s nerves began their familiar prickle again. “What do I have to do to get back on track?”
He couldn’t get himself to look at the empty beds where Seamus and Blaise had lain. He knew Madam Pomfrey would have made them up again, cleaned and smoothed the sheets, taken away all reminders of tragedy. Harry hurried by too quickly to be casual and slipped the catch on the window. He climbed outside onto the roof and into fresh air. The land swept out before him, a flat expanse that folded into hills in the distance, and beyond that, to the north, the first silhouette of mountainous terrain. Below, at the foot of the castle, Harry could see the rectangular peak of the pyre, the soft ashy grey like velvet. At its head, Seamus still stood, alone.
But Harry’s movement was only to push away. His fingers slid from Draco’s waist; the warm weight was gone, leaving only sharp vacancy, and Draco’s hand shot forward on its own.
Harry waited as long as he could and then nodded.
“She knows what she can do,” Malfoy said abruptly. “Try and give her a little credit, Wood.”
He saw—
Harry found that tiny smile playing about the other man’s lips again. He studied Oliver. “She’s very much changed.”
for Salazar’s sake, it was a wonder he hadn’t let go already and fallen.
“Oh god.” It was just a whisper. No one heard it, save Luna.
“I don’t want to do this to him,” Harry forced out. “But I want to do it to Ginny even less. At least with him, there’s a chance that we might—the spell will—”
Harry took a breath and let it out. Rehearsing what he was going to say while walking the dingy halls of Grimmauld was nothing next to standing in front of Malfoy and speaking the words aloud. He clenched his hands and forced them to relax again. “Death Eaters. Got there before we did.”
The woman met Hermione’s eyes. Her fingers were white-knuckled around the hand of her child. Hermione couldn’t tell if the child was a girl or a boy.
“That’s all there is to it?”
Gloomy light filtered through the narrow aperture. Dusk? He didn’t believe he had slept that long. More likely it was only the reminder that, no matter how torn apart the country might be, he was still in rainy grey England.
Harry’s gaze sharpened alarmingly. He came quickly toward her, until she thought she’d have to step back to avoid collision. “They knew you were with Draco?”
Harry pulled himself out of his head and looked at Hermione where she sat, surrounded by piles of scrolls and tomes. “I… Sorry, Hermione. I’m sorry.”
Another wave of his wand, far more complicated. Draco slammed his hand down into the mattress and cursed. “Fucking—This is one of hers. Fucking Alecto!”
“As you well know, some bonds are stronger than others,” Dumbledore went on. “The one you have undertaken will eclipse every other bond that exists in this world if our aims are to be achieved. The magic inherent is very, very old.”
It hit harder than he’d expected. Draco stopped dead in the hallway. And then loathed himself for it. He should have kept going, straight past Harry until he found the room they’d set aside for him. He didn’t know where it was, just that he needed its solitude. And then his mind caught up with him.
“How…?” She fell silent. She heard the rustle of Draco’s cloak.
It was shameful. At least he’d not marked Blaise Zabini this way before sending him into the viper’s nest, Harry thought disgustedly, even as he laid his lips against Draco’s breast. No, he’d only sent Blaise there in the first place, that was all. Another hopeless cause in a series of hopeless causes. He wished it hadn’t been Blaise. If only Pansy had not been unmasked. Or Theodore Nott, with all his dark watchfulness and his calculating eyes… He would have been the best choice.
“I know!” Draco cried. “I know what he’s worth to me, Blaise!
When he left the Infirmary, Harry’s stomach was unsettled to the point of nausea. Seamus had finally come back inside and found his bed. Harry left him asleep, unwilling to watch that deep, stilted breathing mirrored in the two people resting side by side. Blaise had not so much as twitched, and yet it seemed he was aware of Harry, knowing his thoughts and hearing the words Seamus had spoken out on the roof.
Draco sagged, catching himself against the wall. The space behind his eyes was burning.
“No! No, if I can feel—
“You can’t make all things painless,” Draco whispered. “Some things have to hurt. To be worthwhile.”
*		*		*
Why was he doing this? Why couldn’t he just turn a blind eye like he’d always done? Why couldn’t he hate them both for being who they—
Blaise did not slip into the fearsome miasma as quickly this time. His soul remained silent, his breathing peaceful. Seamus lay with his hand curled around his lover’s, and each second that was devoid of the blooming ache inside him was a gift. He watched Blaise with bated breath.
Seamus glared at her. “Nothing else. Fucking killed them.”
“H-here,” she began. “Go get the boys down to the Common Room. I’ll gather the girls and meet you there.”
Hermione’s hand crept out again, this time into his. “Oh, Harry.”
“Harry.” Her voice cracked; the words weren’t going to come. Harry looked up, brow furrowed, and Ginny felt herself stumbling over an edge. She couldn’t say the words, so she found the next best thing.
He had to find Draco. Get everything sorted once and for all, and… and plan the final fight.
His chest loosened. He leaned into the sound and felt the notes caress him under his skin, soothing like balm. His breath escaped in a soft, sad gasp. Luna’s words rested against his bones.
She nodded, closing her fingers around the wand. Draco waited another moment, listening to the footsteps, and then rose and crept in the direction they’d come. There was no sign of their pursuers. He chanced a look back and saw Weasley moving in the opposite direction, hunkered low to the ground. She threw him a glance full of unspoken words, and he turned away. When he looked again, the mist had swallowed her up.
But Harry turned his head and caught his mouth. The kiss was longing and deep, as desperate as what they’d just done. Full of Harry’s taste and the tinge of sex.
Harry squeezed his shoulder and made for the door. “Pomfrey should be back in a bit.”
Hermione burst out over Harry’s words. She grabbed Ginny’s fingers. “Ginny—”
It had been months since Harry had seen his former schoolmate. He could picture every tiny worry-line marring that pale skin, every downward twitch of Malfoy’s lips as if the man were cast in a portrait alongside Dumbledore. Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d ever seen that face without the lines, or that mouth shaped into anything but a twist. Merlin knew there had been little enough to warrant any other expression. Years ago, perhaps, Malfoy had smirked, even smiled. But it seemed a dream. Everything, from the moment Draco Malfoy had stepped back into Harry’s life, dragging his loss into the light behind him, seemed like a dream.
Draco drew a deep breath, trying to keep his nerves in check. The crackle of footsteps was coming back. “You’ll have a few minutes at least. As much as I can give you. They won’t expect me to be on my own and they haven’t any idea where we’re going, so if you keep
“Where is he, Luna?” Harry said urgently.
“We’re finished here.”
“What happened? In the forest.” It came out in spite of his efforts, and for a moment the guilt that had been steadily climbing fell back.
The woman and her child would be safer in the city than with her. The best thing to do was to find Hannah, make the wand exchange, and get on with what she was supposed to be doing. The more places she went tonight, the more confused the Death Eaters would be, and the further away from their real target she could lure them. She only hoped this storm didn’t stretch over the Dales. She could do with a proper spot of warmth, and dry clothing for once.
There were other ways for her to know, and all of them were bad.
by Red_rahl.
In the last hour, Blaise’s eyes had failed him. He stared up at the ceiling. Luna’s voice eased Seamus’ muscles, a current of warmth. Seamus could feel it through his grip on Blaise’s hand.
Moody harrumphed and tugged a chair out with a rough scrape. He slumped into it, scowling. “Your Mr Zabini,” was all he said.
The eruption of a voice to their left froze Draco in his tracks. Ginny bumped into him with a stifled gasp, and for a long moment, they just stood there clutching at each other. Listening to the footsteps drawing past. He felt her breathing quietly against his back, and knew with something akin to embarrassment that she could feel him too. He palmed through his robe pocket and fumbled out a second Minis-port.
Seamus took his hand and Blaise focussed on him again. “So did I,” Seamus whispered. Blaise squeezed his fingers, and then again, harder.
“Seamus,” Neville said. Harry whipped around.
“Stay here,” he whispered. She just looked at him. Draco turned and inched forward, peering into the alcove. All was still inside, as far as his newly accustomed eyes could see. He eased his hand into one pocket and closed his fingers around cool obsidian, then edged into the cave.
Blaise showed no signs of having heard. His tongue came out to moisten cracked lips. Seamus wavered internally, feeling like he would be sick. His lover reached shakily and found the Healer’s sleeve. “Done,” he rasped. “Harry… It’s done…”
He was sneering. She couldn’t see it very well, but she could hear it. All of her carefully plotted patience vanished in a trice and old anger rose again to the surface. She coupled it with that nagging twinge, the strangeness of his words, his snipe tongue, found the dislike she had been lacking all over again, and she lashed out in its wake. “Maybe I thought we had something in common, but I guess I was fucking wrong.”
Oliver squinted, then nodded and looked down. “Yeah. Yeah, it is. Look, Harry, I shouldn’t have said anything. I know how much you care for Ginny.”
It was not well-known how Crabbe had really met his demise. Only those truly in Voldemort’s confidence, or in the highest ranks of the Order, would know about the ancient wasting spell that had slowly drained Crabbe’s life away. The spell, filled with tracking magic, would have led the Aurors straight to Voldemort, had not the carrier died too quickly. But as far as the public of the Wizarding world knew, Vincent Crabbe had been slaughtered by Infernus in a raid, one of four Death Eaters who tried to burn Diagon Alley to the ground. A trap, set and sprung by the Order, and not peered at too closely by citizens already stretched to their limits. In reality, Crabbe’s debilitating magical illness had burned away with the ashes of his body, far from Diagon Alley in the bowels of the Ministry.
“And who do you suggest we send?” Moody growled. “We only sent
Suddenly she was seething, because Draco Malfoy had no right to look at her the same way he had in school, as though she were a stupid child incapable of seeing the true, hideous world. “It is what he wants! Even if he didn’t, he would do it anyway because Harry always has done that,
He wanted not to have the memory of someone inside him, driving him to an ecstatic, writhing peak, marking the path of his skin with knowing hands and parted lips. He wanted not to have the sensation of fingers linked with his, and the sense of failure bleeding over it all.
Harry watched as Draco took down a slender jar of some withered leaf. Long and sick-looking. Fitting, Draco thought. He squeezed his fingers around the sturdy glass and turned back around, wondering if Harry would step aside.
And with Seamus and Blaise, she’d felt inexplicably safe. It was hard to put her finger on what made her feel so secure. She’d been with friends there, and she’d known they were lovers, that they did more than sleep side by side during the night. But it hadn’t been a threat to her. It had been a comfort, to see that the war still held no sway over that sort of emotional attachment, that love was still a reality.
“You all right?” Harry mumbled.
Harry shook his head. As if he had any right to want that. It would never be given to him, and he could never work up the nerve to ask for it.
“Then let me—”
“It’s us. It’s… this thing that’s trying to form.” It made complete sense in Harry’s head, but he still didn’t feel like words would be adequate to explain it. Maybe he could just—
Harry laid his palm flat against the window, letting the cold spill into his skin. The wind blew the grass to tatters far below. Trees whipped. It was odd to think that the glass pane was dry outside, and the rain hissed over it, a breath away.
She waved at him with one hand, unable to do more. “I’ll be fine. Don’t want him to think me ungr… grateful.”
Harry snarled.
Lucius Malfoy was dead. His thunderhead irises had clouded, the pupils huge and fixed in the dank light. His flesh held the slimy chill of something left to dampen in the dark. Harry banished the stunning spell with a hissed
She nodded impatiently. “Which spells? Can you remember?”
It clicked gently and cleanly in Harry’s head: a repetition of words he’d read in old, dusty tomes.
The death of it was sudden and swift, for Katie had been Kissed.
“They’re tired, and hungry, but willing.” Krum looked to Neville, and Neville nodded, picking up the thought.
Harry froze in place. But the voices escalated, one shouting particularly violent barbs. Harry found his legs and lunged forward, shoving through the double doors.
“Was she what?” Ron asked. “Who?”
He tripped and fell against a looming monolith just inside the forest. The tree trunks cross-hatched shadows over the surface and the moss glowed in the odd light. He dragged his fingers over it and felt hysterical laughter bubbling up inside.
Ginny cleared her throat. “How long till we get there?”
Harry hummed his agreement.
Draco grabbed Harry’s shoulders again, squeezed tighter than he should have. He couldn’t help it. And he couldn’t help the whisper that came out of his mouth, a river of sound impossible to understand.
When they reached the last step, Luna pressed her palm flat to the wall and held it there. The air vibrated. Oliver halted, holding Luna at the physical edge of her domain.
“Will he wake?” His own voice sounded on the verge of snapping apart.
Oliver snorted. “There’s no telling what he could do under a hallucinatory spell. He could be seeing his own mum for all we know.”
“Mr Finnigan, think. Those spells don’t account for his injuries.”
“Now. Where is Weasley?” the girl snapped. “Don’t tell me you killed her, too?”
Harry felt his back stiffen. “They’re adults. They can handle it.”
“You are not the replacement, Harry,” Dumbledore said quietly.
Somewhere there was a hole in the earth, and a set of mossy steps leading down into dungeons he knew like the back of his hand. If anything had been spared, it would be what lay below ground.
“Let me go, Potter,” he said in a low voice.
The room went so still that Harry could hear the mansion settling. His question echoed in his ears, and Malfoy’s expression changed once more. It was almost as though Harry could hear the plea in those eyes.
It took him a few minutes to get himself to move.
Poison dripped down her fangs and over his fingers, needling into his flesh. Blaise howled and slammed her head down with a force born of desperation. She hissed at him, coiling more tightly. Blaise saw black spots. He struck at her, digging fingers into her good eye, but still she tightened her death grip upon him. Her mutilated eye socket streamed blackish blood, and it puddled on the floor.
“That won’t… be necessary,” he forced out, trying to work through the confusion in his head. He glanced back at the approaching figure.
Couldn’t do it. Couldn’t sacrifice that knowledge either. “Remus?”
hear something. Light, lilting notes echoing impossibly.
They were dressed in filthy clothing: jeans, a bulbous winter jacket hanging down past the child’s knees, what had once been a dress coat whipping the woman’s thighs. They were both spattered with mud. The child’s eyes stared hugely at Hermione. The woman’s hair sagged under her woolen hat; her face was lined and openly weary. They had no aura that Hermione could sense, and while that meant little nowadays, something instinctive told her they were Muggles.
“Who the fuck do you think you are?” Katie screamed, features so twisted Harry barely recognised her. “You’re not leaving this place alive, you murderer!”
Malfoy’s jaw clenched. “A year.”
He was looking right at Draco. Right into his eyes. Harry jumped as it caught up with him. Draco stood above him on the stairwell, gaze boring down into Harry’s. His face was unreadable.
Dumbledore lowered his head to peer over the tops of his spectacles. “Not nearly as much as she enjoys your company, I expect.”
“It won’t hurt to ask,” Pomfrey said gently.
Draco smiled at her. His emotions weren’t quite working properly; everything had a strange haze of peace around it. He felt completely numb, unable to process the danger he knew he was in.
“I know what I saw!” A flare of pain erupted behind her eyes and she bit off whatever might have followed, pressing her fingers to her brow. She could hear the subtle movement of the others in the room, and her throat and face felt hot. She suddenly felt like a silly schoolgirl vying for attention. Merlin, what
He didn’t even pause, just wheeled around and led her up the next stairwell. The boys’ rooms. Just around the first bend in the staircase, a group of students in pyjamas clustered on the landing, hugging the wall and each other. They stared down at Ron and Hermione from the darkness.
“No, Luna has it. Pomfrey’s coming.”
Draco hunched his shoulders. His breathing was still too fast. He pulled his cloak off the ground and shifted until his back was up against the rock wall.
Impossible. Harry blinked, and blinked again. The asymmetry wavered in front of his eyes as though splashed across a banner, and he fought the urge to laugh. He walked away from the chair and leaned against the wall, unable to think clearly. Just supposing… supposing Malfoy was serious? It had to be a joke, Malfoy coming here and saying that. To him.
“May I remind you that she’s the first person we know of to use a Siren’s Ward in centuries?” Moody snapped. “We have no idea how far she can look, or how it might compromise the wards. This entire castle could pop up on the Death Eaters’ maps for all we know.”
“We can’t think of another person we’d feel safe sending you with,” Seamus said.
“Other names?”
She shoved him away, feeling insanely silly. “Unhand me. I want to sleep, you pushy… pushy…
He stood in the corridor outside the third floor chambers, and thought once again about opening the door before him. But he couldn’t even bring himself to grip the cold brass knob.
“You can feel that?”
It was just this side of pain, the friction
Abruptly, it was too hard to think of Draco Malfoy. He felt as though Nott were standing over his shoulder, clinging to his branches. He’d hardly even known the man. Harry sought for Ginny’s face in his mind instead. He spun her out like silk: fiery strands of hair, the smatter of freckles, and the smile he remembered, the one that flickered like light and shone like gold. His heartbeat slowed. The room filled with stillness and the strains of Luna’s voice rising in another song, and if he thought about it hard enough, he could almost smell Ginny’s rose perfume.
A personal favorite chapter. (Sorry for the wait... I have been a little wrapped up in my original writing. Lots and lots of goals and deadlines.)
“Wait,” Hermione was saying, “you’ve brought us an entire army?”
Moody picked up where Harry fell silent. “There are no signs of dark magic in him except for the residual Cruciatus. He’s been hit with other spells, but you’ve got rid of them as far as I can see.”
“It should be.” Blaise’s focus was far away. “It really should be.”
Harry’s laugh had drawn Draco Malfoy’s attention as well. Malfoy stood several paces from the door, crisp white shirt opened just at his throat. His face was a mixture of annoyance and weariness, gaze fixed on Harry, who, Hermione could see, was quite oblivious to the noise he was making. Of course, things were already loud; why Harry’s voice should cut such a swath through it, she wasn’t sure, but it did. The freedom in the sound was rare.
Harry’d never felt so manipulated. He’d seen it in Dumbledore before, but he’d never… Draco, all this time. And if it hadn’t worked, or if Draco had died, Ginny would still have been there, ready and more than willing.
But Draco had him in as tight a grasp as he’d ever felt, a hand climbing relentlessly up beneath his shirt, the other clutching the back of his neck. The pain was a delicious thrill down his spine and Harry arched until he could only feel Draco’s heat. He grappled with Draco’s pullover, yanking too hard and hearing a grunt, but then it was off and there was nothing but bare skin beneath his palms. Draco shoved him down onto the bed and climbed atop him, fitting body to body, wrestling with the hem of Harry’s shirt again. Harry let him drag it up over his head and fling it away, mesmerised by the flex of bare muscle. Draco shifted, the slightest lapse of control, and suddenly Harry didn’t want him there.
They both looked toward the bed and watched the unsteady rise and fall of their brother’s chest. Fred’s fingers were clenched and Ginny reached to uncurl them. His voice was hollow.
Dumbledore sighed. “That, I’m afraid, is the crux of it. You already bear signs of a powerful bond in progress.”
Malfoy glanced at her before looking out across the plains. A strange flush coloured his cheeks. “You’d better put your shoes back on.”
Everyone else was nodding, their expressions varying degrees of Harry’s. Hermione frowned. “Wait a moment, why can’t I hear her anymore?”
“You…” she started, then reached out and tugged the blanket closer around him. Blaise blinked at her jerky movement and Ginny snatched her hand back, thinking very seriously about running away, back to her room where she wouldn’t stumble and grab and try to shove every piece into the right fit because her brain had abandoned her. “Sorry. Sorry.”
Harry’s body touched his again and Draco couldn’t stop his own shudder, or the aching gasp. The night in Harry’s bed rocked back to him along with all the lonely fantasies of the nights before, and the name just slipped out. “Harry—”
He studied Malfoy’s face silently. The look in his eyes drew him back again and again. Frustrated, Harry looked away, snapping the moment like so much thread. “I’ll take those secrets, no matter how trivial. But there’s something else.”
The last word held an edge of desperation. Harry was caught in the wholly unfamiliar glint to Malfoy’s eyes. But the moment shattered suddenly and painfully; Katie’s wand jammed into Malfoy’s throat.
“Gin, I haven’t…” He blew out a breath. “Things have been… happening.”
Draco paled. “I know about it,” he muttered. “Blaise told me what happened out there. What he had to do.”
Harry kissed his neck and squeezed him tighter, willed the ache away as best he could, and hoped to all the gods that it would have some positive effect.
Moody waved his hand. “They may already know enough about you both just from tracking you across the damned countryside. And now they’ve got hold of two wands from one person. If they’ve figured out that Weasley is the one to be bound to Potter, then they—”
It didn’t take long before they rolled over her.
Hermione nodded. She blinked to clear her eyes. “One of them chased me all over England. They knew I would be there. They waited for me. They must have gotten something out of Hannah before—”
It ended soundlessly. Seamus knew that he was at last whole in some way. Not healed, not complete. Not anymore. But sated. He had Blaise. The kiss had come and then drifted away, and he felt as though the empty bits inside had been filled, for a while at least.
Hermione cleared her throat and drained her flask in one quick gulp. It didn’t taste as bad as she’d expected, and it soothed her throat going down. “Go on, Wood. Just let me get my feet together and we’ll be leaving.”
“You haven’t got a monopoly on suffering, you know. And all your whinging will never get you sympathy. Not now, not anymore!”
The hall was filled with Lovegood’s voice. Draco wound his way through the castle at a near run, stumbling, not seeing anything but the stones under his feet and Blaise’s motionless form in the bed. He entered his room in a haze, not closing the door, dropping onto the bed because he couldn’t hold himself up anymore.
“You’re the only one who still needs that sympathy,” Malfoy bit out. “The rest of us have matured enough to get by on our own.”
Foolish, crossing this empty field as though there were nothing to fear. But Draco did not fear, and when Ginny came alongside him, walking close at his side, he knew that she wasn’t afraid either. The Death Eaters had faded from his mind, mere spirits on the other side of some glass, beating their palms futilely at them as they moved past.
They were naked. Harry’s skin was alive with tattoos, gold, blue, dark, flaking brown. They wove across his bare body, the ends looping around his thighs and calves. Draco looked down and saw that he too wore the symbols.
“Theodore, we have to get—”
is at stake?” Ginny asked before Harry could formulate his thoughts. She refused to look his way again, even now, when he’d given up all sense of impropriety and was already looking at her.
George would recover, of that Madam Pomfrey was sure. But it was difficult to listen to his incoherent mutterings in the stillness of the ward. Harry smoothed the blanket over George’s chest and thought about finding another pillow to prop his friend’s body up.
All the years of his life, all the passing months and the misery that went with them—He was an utter fool to think it was all chance, all some inevitable mire he was sinking into, instead of—
Her face was turned skyward, eyes closed. A dreamy expression settled on her features. All the care lines had vanished and her skin glowed a healthy flush. The wind wisped at loose strands of her hair. She looked peaceful. As she hadn’t for the past three days. Her hair was vibrantly red against the rain-lush grass.
“Course. See you then!”
But there he was, outside of Malfoy’s door, just building up the nerve to knock.
He looked down quickly, embarrassed, cheeks flushing. “Yeah. Yeah, sorry. I’m fine.”
It was a split second decision to ask. Just something to do, considering he and Malfoy had simply been sitting there silently since Harry had come back from the memorial with the knowledge that Charlie wouldn’t be coming home to keep Malfoy company.
Charlie was looking between the two men confused, but Draco wasn’t paying attention.
Well. There goes his cover. There was no way he wasn’t going to reveal himself now. So as Charlie woke with a start in the bed behind him, he sheepishly opened the door, staring at his old school mate on the other side.
Hermione stood in the doorway of the bedroom Harry was fixing up, supposedly “helping,” but more accurately being judgy.
“Draco does wandmaking and helps me with the dragons sometimes.”
“Well, I’ll go and do that. I’ll see you in the morning, Harry.”
But for that night, Theo was just another body. Another night of meaningless sex.
“I shouldn’t have come with you.”
“Isn’t that when he sent out those weird letters?”
And at that moment, Charlie decided it was a great time to walk up behind him and see what was going on. In only his boxers.
How could he, to be honest? The last three years had been some of the best of his life, he just wished he hadn’t been snapped out of the daydream so abruptly. It would have been nice to keep it going a while longer.
Relaxing as the comforting drink slid down his throat, his heartbeat evened out, his breathing steadied and his hands stilled. He looked up at his boyfriend, who was smiling warmly.
But Harry just gritted his teeth and forced out a smile that almost certainly didn’t look genuine.
Harry was kissing him desperately, hungrily, needing more.
“This is someone who knows you. Who has actual connections to you. And once I meet him, there’s just so much pressure to live up to it.”
“Fuck you, Potter.”
Harry let a wave of pure magic slip out of him and the two mugs on the table shattered. He sighed, grabbed his wand and put them back together, dumping the cold tea down the sink.
“But what are you doing here?”
He checked his watch.
“Charlie, what if I see Granger and Weasley? Or anyone else who hates me? What if my parents are there, for fucks sake?”
Shit.
Draco felt his stomach twist. At least Regulus didn’t switch sides too late. Like he had.
“Haven’t you ever seen the mark?”
Charlie turned to face him, looking surprised. Apparently he had been expecting more of a fight. “Does that mean you’ll come?”
Neville had tried to talk to Harry a few times about growing up without your parents there, which was really very kind of him. But the screaming at him about the fact that his parents were still alive and he had a grandmother who loved him and he didn’t get it, probably hadn’t helped.
Jesus fuck, buggering Christ.
At that, Draco finally gave in, pulling Charlie’s face back up to his own and kissing him deeply.
“He’s ok, I suppose. He went over a bit of a rough patch two years ago, but he’s been doing better since.”
“Want this to become a thing. I get it. Totally.”
Or even worse, Justin would want to take it farther than one night, and Harry would have to suffer through rejecting him.
Maybe Luna was right.
Harry dropped onto the couch and put his head in his hands.
He tried not to think about his father, still in house arrest.
“But I am a Death Eater. That’s a fact. It’s something I can’t change. You can’t tell me that Death Eaters are very deserving.”
Harry sighed and shook his head. “And this guy is...just a friend?”
The bedside table had a glass and a (newly repaired) lamp on it, and- you know what? Yeah, if Charlie would be here too; condoms would be a good idea. He strolled over to his own bedroom and threw some in the drawer.
Draco had moved on to folding and refolding his laundry as he talked.
Let me know your thoughts and I may try to actually stick to a posting schedule, though I will probably get one or two more chapters out today, just for the sake of y’all who come across it this early.
But he knew there were people who understood what he was feeling, even if they had never experienced what he had. And he needed to start accepting that.
He really wanted to leave.
Suddenly the previous night came back to him.
For this chapter, CW for mention of past suicide attempt
“Earth to Potter? Hello? Anyone home in there?”
“Yeah. I guess. See you.”
“Theo Nott?!?”
They gave an awkward side hug, and soon Justin was speaking the coordinates of his flat into the fireplace and disappeared in a puff of green smoke.
And then it came back to him.
He also had a touch of a drinking problem, which his friends did everything to help with, but most of the time couldn’t stop. Coming into your job drunk was generally frowned upon, even as Harry Potter; savior of the wizarding world.
As the night wore on, and he and Theo got a few more drinks in, Harry couldn’t help but start to wonder. Theo was leaning into casual touches, making or smiling at the occasional flirty comment, offering to buy drinks for Harry.
He was annoyed with Malfoy, for starting an argument, he was shocked at the words he was hearing from him, there was a twisting in his gut, because he knew he’d intruded, poked his way into something far too personal, too vulnerable. And most inexplicably of all, he was so angry at Lucius Malfoy.
“Well…have a good time. Wait. No, that was insensitive. Don’t have a good time. But I hope you enjoy seeing your family? But not your brother’s memorial. I really don’t-“
Harry’s lips almost quirked into a small smile. Almost. “The graves, Malfoy?”
“I think I’m going to stay here a couple more days if that’s ok with you, Harry.”
“...well…”
“He’s my boyfriend, Harry.”
Changing it up might do him some good.
“No, Draco!”
Well, really, what did Malfoy expect? Even entertaining the idea that he possibly got what Harry had been through? Much less voicing it aloud? He didn’t understand, of course he didn’t. He had grown up privileged and loved, pureblooded and white, surrounded by magic the moment he stepped into the world.
Neville had run out of the room crying, and Harry had apologized, of course he had; but Neville hadn’t talked to him much since. Not really.
Kreacher snapped his fingers and popped away again before the door creaked open slightly.
“Well, Sirius was my godfather, one of my parents’ best friends. He was wrongly convicted of murder and allegiance with Voldemort, though you…already knew that. Right. He was disowned when he was sixteen, got adopted by my grandparents. He became an animagus to help Remus with his transformations, actually. It worked brilliantly until he…well, I met him first when I was thirteen. We hoped I would be able to live with him someday so I could leave the Dursleys, but he died two years after I met him. So. Yeah.”
Afterwards, Draco was panting, head draped across Charlie’s stomach, blonde hair slick with sweat, satisfied and comfortable.
“Is that so?”
It was only 6:43.
Soon, shirts were on the floor, and the two men were breathing hard against each other, bodies slick with sweat, and Draco was riding the high of it, milking every last drop of pleasure he could get out of this because the day was really, truly an awful one.
“I’m sorry. Christ, this is why I don’t do this with people I already know.”
Theo had one arm thrown up against the wall, and the other gripping Harry’s waist through his thin white shirt. Harry had one hand gripping Theo’s hair and the other clutching at his hip, hand slipped under his t-shirt.
Of course, he didn’t need a job. His grandfather had invented Sleakeazy’s Hair Potion after all; he still technically owned the company, and that combined with the fact that he was the Black family heir, and the money he got every time the Prophet wrote an article about him  meant he was filthy rich, and only getting richer.
Draco leaned in to kiss his boyfriend, then pushed him gently against the wall, deepening the kiss, letting his lips slide against Charlie’s until Charlie’s breath hitched and he pulled away.
The man sat up, steadying himself on his elbows. There were tears in his eyes. Harry couldn’t tell if they were angry, or hurt. Maybe both.
Seamus spoke up, cocking an eyebrow in Harry’s direction. He sighed.
Charlie smiled warmly at Harry, almost radiating relief. He hugged him, and whispered into his ear.
Sure, there were things he had done during those few years that he regretted. But the kind of shit Malfoy did? He didn’t understand how Charlie could go looking for him after hearing that. But Charlie was his big brother, and he understood enough to know that this was out of his hands. It didn’t mean he liked it.
It was raining.
However, they were not always helpful.
Draco turned over and cupped Charlie’s face in his hand. “What’s going on, mon amour?”
(See the end of the chapter for
And god, Draco loved it when Charlie mumbled out Gaelic. Whether it was small terms of endearment, or swears under his breath, or gasped out strings of unintelligible words during sex, it was one of the hottest things he could think of.
The footsteps came closer, and then stopped in front of the door, where Theo was stood.
Draco shrunk his mug down and dropped it in his pocket, then took Charlie’s hand.
“Of course, Harry. Be our guest, we were just about to ask you. We were going to do tea with Luna, Ginny, Neville, Dean and Seamus if that’s ok?”
It wasn’t like he liked his schoolboy rival as a person, or enjoyed his company, but how could anyone ever let a child go through that? It wasn’t like Harry hadn’t had his fair share of verbal and physical abuse throughout his life, but seeing it through someone else’s eyes really put it into perspective.
“15, I think.” He turned away from Harry again.
“Draco, no!”
“Why don’t you just buy a mug with no words on it?”
Harry sat at Ron and Hermione’s dining room table, nibbling on some of Luna’s lavender biscuits and half listening to idle chatter.
“But what if he doesn’t?”
Draco did know what day was coming up. He looked up at the calendar on the wall, only a week away.
“How do you know that?”
It was an odd dynamic. Awkward, and still, with Charlie acting as a buffer, making sure they didn’t go at each other’s throats. Not that Harry was even sure he wanted to.
It had taken him a lot of time to forgive himself. A lot of effort, too. And he could feel the threads of that hard work unraveling under him, falling apart by the second. That had been the problem, hadn’t it? It was easy to learn to forgive yourself when there weren’t people around you who knew.
He closed the door quickly.
His own scars didn’t hurt. The nerve damage he had sustained only resulted in a loss of feeling across the slashes that covered his body, and the whole of his left forearm.
“No, it wasn’t. It was a quite minuscule chance that I’d be a Weasley, in fact. Which is probably why you didn’t even think of it. Quite remarkable how small the world can be, huh?”
Charlie barked out a laugh. “How about this; we see how long you can spend with my family without figuring it out, I say less than two minutes.”
He pulled away briefly, only to close his mouth around Theo’s even more fiercely, and start to pull him towards the bed.
CW: there’s sex. It isn’t explicit as promised in the tags, but it happens
“Charlie, I-“
Ok, Harry could somewhat understand Drunk-Harry’s decision. Justin was in no way bad looking, and his sleepy smile was gaining reactions from Harry’s body that he did not want to be having.
“I know a good café around the corner, why don’t we go there and get a cup of tea, huh?”
Harry stood up suddenly, feeling a bit sick. It was already 9, and he just wanted to leave at this point. He walked towards the door and moved to put his coat on.
He dropped his head into his hands.
Harry sighed and shook his head, dropping it into his hands. “No Charlie, it’s fine. You- you’re right. I might hate the guy, but I’m not going to throw him out on the street, and I don’t want you wasting your money on a hotel or anything. This is where he was supposed to stay, and we can stick with the plan. This is a big house, I don’t have to be best mates with Malfoy for him to stay here.”
He dropped face first on the bed and groaned.
“Is your great plan to seduce me into spilling my feelings?”
“We have to leave in an hour, Draco.”
Charlie’s eyes widened and he nearly spit out his tea. “Did we forget last night? I’m sorry, Harry. Is that what’s got you in a mood this morning?”
“You know you won’t win this, love. You’re coming with me.”
He cringed internally, expecting a fan wanting an autograph, or a picture or something, the way it often was when he went in public. He prepared himself to plaster on a fake smile for the adoring witch or wizard, but when he turned around, it was to see a vaguely familiar face.
It should have.
“Well I don’t want you to leave without me!”
Deciding to look out of his door to catch a glimpse of Potter’s mysterious hookup wasn’t a good idea either way. It was invasive, and rude, and he shouldn’t have done it.
Draco was taken aback for a moment. “What?”
Charlie had been there for him through all of it, and although he acted annoyed with his foster brother, he knew in reality that he would do anything for him.
And god, that was just a punch to the gut. It almost made Draco fall apart, but he wouldn’t let himself. Not again. Not yet. And so he forced himself to shift off of Charlie’s chest and keep walking forward, blinking back the tears threatening to fall from his eyes.
There was poise in everything Malfoy did, every step he took was positively dripping with confidence and class. Even though, apparently, in recent years he held himself with a little less arrogance; looking unsure, or vulnerable, simply didn’t happen to Draco Malfoy.
Draco took a sip and couldn’t hold back the moan that escaped his lips. “Merlin, I haven’t had a cup of tea that good in years”
He tried to reel himself back in, but it was too late, there was a sheen of sweat across his hands and forehead, his breath was quickening, his eyes widening. He stayed as long as he could before he let go of Charlie’s grasp, ran to the bathroom and threw up.
“Look, we were just sort of rivals during school for a long time, and he was a real git. A stuck up pureblood, who spewed nonsense, called Hermione some nasty names. Just not a good person all around.”
Charlie broke into a small smile. “-Yeah, I understand, Draco. I love you, I’ll see you soon.”
The world started spinning around him, everything distorted and wrong, because this could not be happening.
“That all sounds nice. But aren’t we here for two weeks?”
“Make the fucking phone call, prat.”
They walked back, slowly and awkwardly through the rain, less cheery than when they came there the first time.
It was frankly a little disturbing.
Charlie simply chuckled and sat down on the bed.
“I know. I know,” Harry snapped, not meaning to sound so cranky
Charlie sighed and peeled Draco off of him, walking to the fridge and pulling out a bottle of the supplements he kept in both their homes for Draco. He popped off the cap and handed it to the other man, who reluctantly took a sip and sat down at his kitchen table.
“It’s just Theo these days, but yeah. Wow, I haven’t seen you since school.”
“Yeah yeah, whatever, arsehole. I’ll see you on Sunday. Just drop him off here and you can spend the night if you want since everyone else will be getting settled at home.”
He didn’t think about it. He couldn’t think about it. He pushed it away, because it hurt too much. Opening up the wounds wouldn’t do anyone any good.
“It doesn’t matter if it was easy. I should have known I couldn’t get away from all of that crap.”
Ok, maybe he was a little jealous. But it was less the fact that Ginny had broken up with him and gotten with Luna, and more the fact that they were just...happy.
“Are you sure Regulus’ old room is the best one to use?”
“So Malfoy’s actually staying with you, Harry?”
He wondered how many of the peacocks were still alive.
And Christ, they hadn’t done that in too damn long. Bunking off work with Charlie was some of the most fun he had in Romania, and it had never lost its spark.
“That’d be great, Harry, thanks.”
He was dizzy, and saw spots. Charlie was saying something, but he didn’t hear it.
He tried not to think about his mother, who hadn’t heard from her only son in so long.
“I think you are. It’s where you planned to stay and it’s where you’re staying. You don’t even have to talk to Harry tonight. You can just stay with me. But I don’t want you freezing to death out here in Merlin-knows-where, Islington. So let’s get back to the warm bed that’s waiting for you, and see about the rest in the morning, yeah?”
“Yeah. Doesn’t mean I retract my earlier statement.”
“They’re already there!”
“You didn’t deserve that.”
“Don’t say that. This is a good chance for closure.”
“Oh, shoot! Is it early? Sorry, I forget about the time zones sometimes.”
“Exactly, Charlie. This is exactly why I don’t need to be picking at old scabs.”
But instead, Charlie approached with a big dark blue umbrella, angled it over Draco’s head, and rearranged his long limbs to sit cross legged on the bench next to him.
“You know, the gifts, and the money and such were probably my father’s twisted way of apologizing. Not because he felt bad, no. To win back my favour. So I’d keep following him blindly, like a dog.”
The afternoon before, once they had returned to Grimmauld Place, he had run upstairs, locked Charlie out of their bedroom, and cried. Long and hard.
He thought it was appropriate, though. Sirius and Regulus were Malfoy’s relatives. Relatives who had been lost to the war, and he had never gotten to know. Well, Regulus had died before either of them were born, actually. But, regardless.
“I don’t know,” Draco grumbled.
The bench he was sitting on was wet, and continuing to get wetter as the rain drizzled on, but Draco just let it. He could have easily cast a drying charm, but there was something comforting about sitting in the rain. He knew it was just a little melodramatic, but it shifted his mood.
“I spent a lot of energy convincing you to do this, you think I would leave you behind now?”
The wood was carved specifically to fit in his grasp. It slotted perfectly into his fingers.
Harry downed the last of his butterbeer, shrugged on his coat and stepped outside.
“I’m sorry. I lost control of my temper…and I shouldn’t have.”
Charlie held his hand up in surrender and turned back to his food. “Do you have your speech all worked out for Friday?”
“Sounds good,” Harry gasped out before reaching to fumble through his drawers.
“Well, no. Like a year after the war he sent out these weird apology letters to all of us? It was pretty strange, but he didn’t sound quite right, though I didn’t think much of it at the time.”
“I don’t think he’s told me everything. I don’t think he knows everything. But we did go over a few highlights, yes.”
Charlie quirked an eyebrow at Harry for a moment and sighed. “Look, Harry. That’d be pretty terrible on its own, though I can assure you he’s grown from that nowadays. He’s been nothing but kind since I met him, even a passionate activist for inequality within the wizarding community. But that’s not all there is to it. You wouldn’t react like that to someone who was a prat during school. And based on both of your reactions, I’m guessing you know where he got all of those scars.”
“Nothing’s wrong. Get some rest.”
Draco opened his eyes the way he did many mornings nowadays, soft rays of sun hitting the dragon scales on the walls, the iridescent pieces glowing and sending small rainbows across the room. And of course, on the soft white sheets was a mess of red hair on the other side of the bed. He sighed softly. He knew there weren’t many people who would exactly approve of his life choices, but he was happy, and that was what mattered. After everything, he thought a break was well deserved, and while he knew running from his past wasn’t the best solution, he couldn’t deny the pure joy he got out of being able to escape it all here.
“Charlie!”
“So you know how I’m coming home for a while in a few days?”
“Oh, yeah. Sorry if you hear noise coming from there… my brother is staying with me.”
Charlie walked out the door, and Draco sat down, relieved, albeit a little confused, as he had expected to be arguing over it for a while longer.
“She married Lupin? I always thought he was gay.”
“Look, I’ll set up a spare room, but only because I love you, and you have to keep him entertained,
“Well, this is the Black ancestral home after all.”
Draco froze. Suddenly the world felt like it was spinning a little, memories flashing through his mind a thousand miles a second.
“Yeah, I like how it turned out.”
But how could she have expected to when she had let everything go on for so long?
Charlie hadn’t said a word, just led Draco back to bed and held him until he fell into a restless sleep.
Harry sighed and slumped down at the table, stealing a slice of Charlie’s toast. “Among other things.”
He gripped his wand in his hand, trying to ground himself, feeling the way the wood formed to his hand, smooth and slightly supple. Anastasia had worked with him for months to perfect it, and it was perfectly suited to him, fine tuned to his own magical abilities.
“You’re an insufferable prick.”
He tried not to think about the fact that it had been five years.
Visiting them was out of the question. For one, he supposed he had as good as gotten himself disowned when he cut himself off from the world completely, his parents likely wouldn’t want to see him.
“Really, I’m sorry if that’s not what-“
Harry woke abruptly to his phone ringing on his bedside table. His headache was piercing and he felt as though he was about to throw up. He probably shouldn’t have drank as much as he did the night before, but there was nothing to be done now. He clumsily pushed his glasses onto his face and wondered who was calling him at this time in the morning when he heard a groan next to him and felt the bed shift.
Tears welled up in his eyes, but he didn’t let them fall. Every fiber of his being was screaming at him to run, to get away, it took every bit of strength he had to stay seated.
He had managed to stitch himself back together; albeit poorly, and he wasn’t going to break down just to pick up the pieces again.
He stumbled downstairs to see Charlie eating a piece of toast at the dining room table, Prophet in hand. He looked up and smiled. “Morning!”
He went back into the kitchen and scraped together a meal of some sorts, hearing Charlie’s voice in the back of his head, telling him that his body needed energy. He knew his boyfriend would be disappointed if he hadn’t eaten when he got back, and he found himself never able to lie to the man, so he stumbled through a plate of food, always finding it harder to eat when he was by himself.
“Goodbye, Charlie.”
As always, I’m sorry it’s been so long.
He had been planning to get absolutely plastered and regret it in the morning since he didn’t have to go into work the next day, when he caught a head of red hair across the room. He didn’t know why his eyes lingered, but a second later the man turned his head, and he was gorgeous. Draco at the time was still trying to figure out if he liked men, but this one sealed the deal. He hadn’t thought he would like redheads, it would forever feel like he was sleeping with a Weasley. But this man’s hair was less of the fiery neon orange, his locks were a soft, darker auburn. His jawline was sharp, but his features were soft, light brown freckles sprinkled everywhere Draco could see, his eyes a deep emerald. He caught his eye, and to Draco’s surprise, the man had walked over, and bought him a drink.
But he figured, though Malfoy’s words might have been incorrect, or misinformed, they were probably not from a place of malice.
“I did not settle for you. You’re incredible.”
He honestly wasn’t opposed to the idea. Theo was attractive, his jawline sharp, his smile warm. Chestnut brown hair fell in soft waves on the top of his head, and his eyes were a radiant blue. Harry could see the occasional tattoo peeking out of the color of his jumper, and he was starting to get curious as to if there were any more. Any that most people didn’t get to see.
“You know you’re too good to me, right?”
He reached his hand out and wandlessly mumbled some numbing and cooling charms, and some pain relief, letting his magic seep through his hands into the ropy scars. He felt Charlie relax under his touch, then roll over to kiss him slowly.
“Hey, don’t you think you should tell me your last name?”
“Love you too, Harry. Sleep well, darling.”
“No,” he managed to choke out. “No, I don’t want to visit my family.”
Draco vaguely remembered thinking that when he first moved to Romania, though he had gotten used to the stuff there over time. He thought, though; that he might never want to drink it again after this.
“Fucking Slytherins.”
“I assume you don’t want me there, I can find a flat somewhere else-“
“I’m not.”
It was like some horrible movie cliche, the ones he and Charlie always made fun of.
That got a smile out of Draco. “Sounds like one of the circles of hell. Maybe I’ll tell you mine afterwards.”
He thought back to the first night he had met Charlie. He had thought at the time that he had a strict no redhead policy when it came to romantic endeavors, for purely Weasley reasons. But then Charlie had come along, and his stupid head of curls was more of an auburn than a ginger, really. Didn’t remind Draco of the Weasleys at all.
“Malfoy.”
As soon as he was thrust back into a world where people knew, where there were other people that hadn’t forgiven him, it knocked the wind out of him. He hadn’t been prepared for that.
Charlie laughed, low in his throat. “Happy to be of service, sunshine. All in a day’s work.”
Maybe he just didn’t want to comfort him anymore, but it felt like more than that.
And so they settled into casual conversation. He and Theo hadn’t exchanged more than a couple of semi-friendly exchanges during school, but it was nice to see someone who was familiar, but didn’t know him inside and out. Who hadn’t seen him break down in their arms. He hadn’t known it, but it was just what he had needed.
Malfoy seemed to be processing for several seconds before stuttering out a reply. “Wow. I mean. Wow. That’s- wow. Well that explains some things.”
He tried not to let himself think about the memorial Charlie was attending right now. For his little brother, who had died in the same battle Draco had fought in. For which side he had fought he wasn’t completely sure, but he had been there throwing curses alongside everyone else.
And Harry just about combusted from frustration right then and there, angry at Charlie for asking him for restaurant recommendations. So he could go on a date. With Malfoy. What the hell was he getting at?
It was just way too much history. Too much all at once. Sure, maybe he might be willing to believe that Malfoy had changed a bit, even be civil to him if he had some time. Some space to hash things over, let the rawness that was their relationship heal over a little.
he croaked.
“I’m… much better, thank you.”
**originally posted 6/28/07**
“You need sleep.”
Some muttering. Remus, Hermione, and Madam Marchbanks nodded and rose. Shacklebolt and Minerva wore thoughtful expressions, and Ron stared at Harry for a long time before moving to stand beside Hermione. Moody’s magical eye glared down through the gloom at the man slumped in the chair. His grimace was anything but hidden when he got to his feet.
Moody’s summons was more than just curious, but Harry couldn’t find anything more fervent to respond with. He dressed mechanically and found his glasses by his bed. It was most likely news of Blaise’s status. Harry’s hands halted, belt dangling from his fingers. The summons had not felt urgent. A pebble of hope flipped in his heart, and he looked around for his shoes and socks. If not an emergency, then the news might be good. Or the same.
“Seamus,” he whispered. He didn’t know whose sorrow he was feeling. The emotional tide rolled. “It’s a bond. I don’t know how—”
Seamus lay on his back on the hospital bed until he couldn’t any longer, and then he sat. Then he walked, round and round Blaise’s bed with one hand trailing over his lover’s body, touching his bare arm and his hands, his face, forehead, and the familiar slopes of his feet beneath the blankets. Contact, always in contact.
“Of course.”
Ginny shivered, glad that Malfoy was ahead of her. Now, in the midst of all of this, she was dreaming of Harry. She’d never had a dream that felt so real. She might have reached out and grasped his fingers, kissed his lips, felt his harsh breaths flooding her mouth. She could still taste him on her tongue.
Malfoy’s smirk became a snarl. “Oh, I don’t know, Weasley. As far as Voldemort is concerned, your family is right up there with mine. Blood traitors.”
She nodded erratically, eyes unfocussed and aimed at the floor some ways in front of her. Her mouth opened, but the sound that issued from it broke across the note. Harry looked around, waiting for some sign of falling wards, of… something, and in that instant, Luna’s fingers dug hard and fast into his flesh. She stared straight at him, eyes watering.
What else might be cropping up in other parts of the world? In America, Africa, the Middle East? Monoliths in Egypt, talismans in Norway. Ancient magic he couldn’t begin to contemplate. He wasn’t sure if humans should anyway.
“It’s not about that,” Harry hissed. “Gods, you—Do you know what I—”
Dumbledore folded his hands. Harry could still feel the familiar, impenetrable gaze of his former instructor, as if the man were flesh and blood sitting in the room next to him. “Ah, yes. Mr Malfoy.” He leaned forward slightly. “You regret his part in all of this?”
“I know,” Fleur said in a stronger voice. “I know that. I could not leave her there.” She looked Harry right in the eye.
Draco’s eyes flickered away this time, the light in them fading as he remembered. Or tried not to remember. “Weasley,” he whispered.
“Hey,” he said, drawing the chair closer. He tugged the blanket higher around his friend’s chest.
Harry nodded.
“Why, whatever do you mean, my boy?”
Harry looked to where Seamus had crossed through the hall. There was no one there anymore. An inescapable grimness crept over him again. The hum of the ragged bond did not diminish.
“Bad?” Draco said in a low voice. Theodore nodded, opened his mouth to speak, and another fit of coughing arched him from the ground. Draco slid his arm beneath Theodore and raised his shoulders out of the mud. Theodore choked, then swallowed.
He knew then that he couldn’t stay in the castle and watch. Assist. He was almost sick at the thought, and barely railed against the flood.
do. So many things, so very many things. The first thing would be to live a life that didn’t belong to everyone else. The second would be to cease taking that which was not his to take.
“Says who?”
“I’m asking you to help me,” Harry gasped out. Draco hit him even harder, clipping across his face and leaving his jaw aflame. He struggled for a grip on Draco’s hands, then held on for dear life. “It’s the only way. It’s the only way.” He said it over and over, the words losing their meaning as Draco railed, pushed him into a wall, pulled him back off it again. Harry hung on, desperate to keep Draco near him, for all the damage he was intent on doing.
Seamus looked past her, focussed on Blaise. His lover looked… asleep. Just asleep. The ice-blue glow still hugged his form, curling in silent tendrils.
It was George who kept waking and drifting, unable to remain asleep for the fever, and then unable to stand the light when his eyes opened.
Ginny looked down at her own hands. Maybe… Yes, they had more in common than she’d thought. Ever. How many nights had she sat up after Blaise and Seamus had retired, watching snow falling past some dirty hovel window and wondering who she could blame for Ron’s death? Harry had crossed her mind more than once, as had Hermione. Pansy Parkinson for not being strong enough under pressure. Moody for not being prepared. McGonagall for not protecting the school better. But she’d managed to dismiss them all in the end. There was only one person responsible for all this death, all the flight and fear, and that person was Voldemort.
His eyes roved over the faces of the people watching from the stairs. It was quiet, and they were safe. Blaise was alive, Blaise had a
“I can’t have what I want either,” Harry whispered. “Especially not…”
The slice of anger into their comfortable heat scraped Harry’s nerves. He grew annoyed. Ridiculous for Draco to think it would be an easy thing to answer, an easy thing to think about. It stung that Draco had such a lack of concern over the question. What had this meant to Draco anyway?
Madame Pomfrey took two steps inside. The lines around her mouth had carved into deep furrows. She ran a hand through her hair, pulling strands free of her wilting bun.
When Draco dreamed, Harry dreamed it, too, and it wasn’t unpleasant at all. It was like a shared voice.
Malfoy cast a glance around the room but didn’t fixate on anything. When he returned to Harry, some spark had died.
A bedraggled, motionless woman was revealed. Brown hair long and tangled, skin disturbingly pale. Her eyes were too empty, almost filmed over, and Harry’s gut rolled before he realised what, and who, he was really seeing.
Some forgotten fire reared. Seamus yanked himself free hard enough to see shock in Moody’s face. “They’re
Krum studied the destroyed wand with more interest. “That would be very useful against the Death Eaters.”
“Weasley.”
“Why don’t

“It is no longer a question of correcting for mistakes.” Dumbledore fingered his beard, then let his hand drop. “Harry, you understand better than anyone that the binding process is a delicate matter. But would it surprise you to know that people form fledgling bonds all the time? There is one between all devoted lovers on earth, though it is infinitely less refined than the bond you are in the process of developing.”
When the shields broke, Draco Malfoy was gasping for breath in the shadow of the inner city wall. The Muggles in the streets behind stopped in their tracks and stared, their faces a mix of surprise and curiosity. A teenaged girl dropped her umbrella into a puddle and pointed with one finger.
“What?”
he thought. The dream exploded before him, miles of aching and loss and nothingness. Now it was swamped with Harry’s presence instead, a deluge dashing high against the walls, glittering, heavy, full. Draco hauled Harry down, finding no clothing, just skin and more skin, heat he needed. Harry shoved Draco’s sleep pants over his hips, then surged up to take his mouth.
“And the Muggles?” Harry asked.
*		*		*
something was wrong, several very big things were wrong. Humans obviously weren’t meant for this magic. It had the power to eat them alive. Him and Lovegood and Finnigan, and if Blaise had survived—
Harry’s face went slack with surprise. “He what?”
Moody scowled at Harry. “You can’t control the entire war, Potter. Malfoy has duties elsewhere.”
Draco took the black wand in trembling fingers. Dark magic coursed out of it; the constant ache of the tattoo on his left arm burned into fiery relief and he gritted his teeth. He gripped the wand tightly, lifted his knee, and cracked the wood squarely in half over it. The wand made an odd whistling sound, and then there were just two halves of a stick in Draco’s hands. Potter rose to his feet.
“You’re asking me to kill you, Harry, do you understand?”
With a strength born of adrenaline, Harry lifted Draco and settled him back against the head of the bed. Draco’s mouth was all over his face and throat, leaving hot patches that stung in the room’s cooler air. Harry gripped Draco’s naked hips and thrust into him, and Draco arched. His legs wrapped vice-like around Harry’s waist. Harry slid his hand under one thigh and held him up. Held him close. Fingernails dug into his back.
Footsteps approached. They reached level with her head and paused. She could feel him looking at her. When he at last moved away, she didn’t know if her ruse had been successful or not.
“What do you want me to do?” It heaved inside of him, the answer he both wanted and didn’t want, and suddenly he couldn’t keep silent. “Choose someone else?”
Harry shook his head. “Then that’s what I am. And that’s what the bond is, and that’s what my
Death Eaters. He frowned at the stars. It was colder up north. Snow and ice, frozen lands with an even icier heart, because somewhere beneath the earth, they were there.
No, he wasn’t… wasn’t ready for that question yet. Not yet, gods, why did it always have to come back to his reasons? He didn’t think he could lie to Draco, and it came to him with a start that he hadn’t lied to Draco in years. Not since their Hogwarts days. Harry pushed away, sat up.
“No,” Harry grated. His heart kicked against his ribs and he pulled himself up onto his elbows with extreme effort. “Draco, no.” That wasn’t what happened. He felt none of the disgust that Draco had infused his image with. He didn’t know he was feeding anything back until Draco’s face went slowly slack. His mouth opened underneath Harry’s fingers and he stared at something as though he couldn’t quite see it. Or… maybe he could see it just fine if Harry…
The windows had long gone black, and rain slicked down over the wards outside. Everyone turned, lifted bowed heads as the door swung open.
Something even blacker flitted through Harry’s eyes. He stepped forward deliberately. The change struck Draco as very odd: this was no timid boy anymore, this was a man well-versed in the art of protecting himself and those around him. Draco edged backward. He knew that man,
“Does Seamus have any other injuries?” Harry asked, needing to keep the inner voices at bay and relieve himself of one more thread of guilt.
sound returned—an instant before Draco was knocked off his feet by a wall of heat. He hit the ground several yards from where he’d been, only just managing to keep hold of his wand. The area inside the wall was teeming with Death Eaters. The few Order wizards who had made it through had been pushed back and were struggling to hold the shields they had cast. Draco got to his feet.
And what Harry wanted most… was to save them all. Ginny’s breath stopped in her lungs.
“I’m here,” he answered.
Salazar. Was this what they had come to? He raised one hand before swimming eyes, trying to ground himself in the familiarity of it.
Potter’s green eyes flicked to his and held. “It’ll bleed a lot.” He groped behind himself with  a bloodied hand and passed something to Draco. “Here. Break it.”
It had been Ginny’s final notice that her childishness had no place there anymore, and it had hit hard. As if the death of her youngest brother had not smacked her senseless already. Still, she’d been able to hope, she’d had that ability, until they taken the room away from them, gave to someone they’d actually been able to find, and Hermione passed out on the floor right in front of her.
She was approaching slowly, moving across the ground in smooth sweeps. Must have been closer than he’d thought. He doubted he would have heard her otherwise. She sounded large, and though Potter had described her in detail, Blaise wasn’t sure what he would see when she entered the room. He wiped his palms against his pullover and tucked his wand hand out of sight behind his leg.
And that, of course, just left the strength of will to get himself
Harry’s head began to pound dully. He kneaded his fingers against his forehead in an effort to keep it at bay. Why, if he was so great a leader, could he get nothing solved?
“They have indeed sacrificed. They will continue to sacrifice, as will you. Perhaps you should not have this power, as you say, to make them sacrifice what they love for you and for this. But you
It was odd, hearing Malfoy using muggle swears, but he didn’t feel like picking a fight about it. He was too tired.
He stomped up to his room, put up a rushed Muffliato and screamed.
Draco chuckled low in his throat. “This is- ngh, siren scale core- oh, Jesus,- very important experiment.”
“It’s a nice room! It’s close to mine in case he needs anything, and I took the shrine to Voldemort down years ago.”
“Haven’t started it, actually…” Draco could hear the smile in Theo’s voice.
Charlie gave him a warm smile and took a sip of his own. “That’s what happens when you leave England. No tea will even compare.”
“Yeah. It is.” Potter seemed to give him a glare.
At that, a choked sob ripped its way through Malfoy’s throat. It sounded like he had tried to bite it back, but he couldn’t.
Harry passed him the vial and he knocked it back, then sat up and swung his legs over the bed, throwing on his jeans and rumpled t-shirt that had been abandoned the night before.
Charlie looked back up across the table and paused for a minute to think.
The man frowned slightly. “Well, I didn’t really know them. All I got told about Sirius was that he was in prison for defending our honor, then he was a horrible blood traitor. And nobody really talked about Regulus since he died so young.”
“Hey, is Charlie here?”
Draco stuck close by Charlie’s side, pure terror in his eyes. He really shouldn’t have agreed to this. Charlie was irritatingly confident, walking out of the Ministry like he did it every day, guiding Draco through the streets of London.
Draco wasn’t sure it was a promise he could keep, but he nodded anyway. “I’ll try. I swear.”
He could call his other friends, though he didn’t really want to bother them.
“Well, today we’re walking over to my foster brother’s house in Islington, since you’ll be staying there. We’ll get your stuff in and I can help you get settled and get to know each other. I’m staying there tonight too since the rest of my family’s settling in at home right now.”
“Look Justin, it’s not that last night wasn’t fun, but-“
But then Charlie’s hand was pressed against the crotch of his pajama pants, and he lost control completely, pulling Charlie into a desperate and messy kiss, lips sliding together. He straddled Charlie and looked at him with hungry eyes before dipping back down to kiss him again, slow and deep.
Charlie let out a barking laugh, pulling away. “Gross, Harry! I don’t want that image in your mind!”
They sat in silence for a few moments before Draco spoke again.
But he was. He completely was. He was the type of guy Harry would stop to take a second look at on the street if he weren’t...Malfoy.
He grabbed handfuls of Charlie’s sweater and pushed him up against the brick wall, opening his mouth a bit further to slide against Charlie’s.
“An emergency came up with one of the dragons at work. She’s very ill, I need to be back there right away. The reservation got me an emergency international portkey, but your trip back isn’t for another week. Have a good time, you’ll be ok, I promise. I’ll write. I love you, I’ll see you in a week.”
“I didn’t want it in my mind either, you’re the one who brought fucking Malfoy home! It’s permanently ingrained in my brain!”
“So. We’ve got ourselves into a bit of a predicament, haven’t we?”
“You should eat before we go, love.”
“Hey, Luna? Do you think you can meet me at the Leaky tonight?”
He hadn’t slept with a man before that day, and the pretty terrible fumble he had engaged in with Daphne Greengrass two years before wasn’t exactly the eye opening sexual experience of his dreams. He had told Charlie this, but it didn’t stop him, and soon he was gasping and writhing under Charlie’s body, then collapsed on his bed, limp and shell shocked.
Then, Charlie’s familiar presence drifted into the foreground of his mind. He braced himself to be yelled at, maybe hit, or hexed.
“It really isn’t so bad. We mostly stay out of each other’s way, and he hasn’t tried anything. Though I wish he and Charlie would remember to cast a silencing charm every once in a while.”
“How’s Norberta doing?”
“mmph- Yes, I have a couple of -oh, projects to drop off to Anastasia.”
Harry felt strange, like he was intruding on a private moment. But it was over as soon as it began, and Malfoy started to walk up the stairs.
And so Harry was left alone in his kitchen with Malfoy, seething and perpetually grumpy.
Justin chuckled lightly and looked up.
“Anyway, my foster brother is speaking at the Ministry on the 2nd, so we’ll go to that. We have a memorial for my brother the next day, which you’re welcome to come to, but you don’t have to, my family can be a lot. I’m settling in at home tomorrow, but I’ll come and see you plenty, and we can just hang out for a couple of days until the actual anniversary.”
After a couple of minutes, he sighed and broke the silence.
Draco let out a little laugh and turned towards Charlie. “Sounds like him. Bloody Gryffindors.”
Harry could see them everywhere, the slashes snaking around his arms and wrists, the couple of faded white marks peeking out from his collarbone, and even a small scar through his left eyebrow that Harry hadn’t noticed until now. It made his stomach churn to see the effects of the curse he had thrown, still there for Malfoy to see; for Charlie to see today, but he had moved past that a long time ago, he thought.
Draco took another sip.
“He’s Malfoy, Charlie.”
“I think we’re both Norberta’s fathers, aren’t we?”
“It’s…complicated. I’m staying here for a bit.”
He thought Charlie might push him off, but instead he moved to pull Draco closer, stroke his hair and kiss the top of his head.
He had tried being an Auror, but realized quickly after a quite disastrous week in the field that he had spent a lifetime hunting out dark wizards, and he wanted a break.
So there he was, 22 years old, unemployed and unstable. It wasn’t what the world had expected of the great Harry Potter, but it was his life, and he could deal.
CW for in depth(ish) descriptions of child abuse and brief mention of past rape/non con
“I’m not in contact with my parents.” He said sharply. His stomach churned, but he pushed it down.
He sighed, relief flowing through him at Charlie’s presence. “Hey.”
Hi guys! It’s been over a month since I updated this fic, I know. My mental health is shit, but I promise I haven’t abandoned it. I also might be writing a bit of a longer wolfstar fic soon so look out for that if you’re interested!
Hermione smiled warmly. “Makes sense. Ron and I are apparating over after he’s done with work, but the Weasley family reunion will be pretty...loud.”
“That’s interesting.”
Draco wasn’t really crying again, but he was starting to get a little sniffly when he choked out his response. “Yeah. Yes. I understand. I know.”
He reached his hand out towards the other man, and didn’t miss the small wince Charlie gave, though he tried to hide it. Draco never understood why he always tried to hide his nerve pain that accompanied the rough burn scars that covered his body. There was no shame in them, and no point in trying to ‘tough through it.’
That caught him off guard. Draco stared down at his friend’s hand, curled into a fist at his side. “What happened?”
Harry spine prickled. “Has he left the castle?”
“I expect to be informed as to exactly what that Horcrux is when the time grows closer, Potter.” Moody fixed Harry with another piercing stare.
He wondered how many more there would be before they could call this thing complete.
Harry skimmed over the timeline detailing evidence of Respondent Magic until he found the dates pertaining to Ancient Greece and Macedonia. He paused, finger resting against the cracked parchment over “ασπίς άσματος.”  Quilled with loving attention beneath the curved Greek letters was the English translation: Siren’s Ward.
“The binding is to keep me alive. To keep me strong.”
Malfoy watched him, his head tilting slightly away. “I didn’t tell anyone I was coming here. Or planning to come here,” he added after a second.
“We will transfer enough of the ward’s power from one singer to four singers. Let them bear the brunt of protecting the castle so that Ms Lovegood may shift her focus.” Minerva linked her fingers in front of her on the table. “Then, once the Siren’s Ward is safely transmuted to its new form, we can drop the castle wards completely. Voldemort will see it, but it should appear as nothing but an empty shell.”
“Merlin, I hope not,” Harry muttered. Kingsley’s face cracked into a tired grin.
“So.” Potter’s attention was only for his task. The warm drift of blood down Draco’s side, as well as Potter’s hand swiping over it, was distracting.
When he had to tell her that the warmth was followed again and again by a wrenching disconnect, however, inconsolable pain and unquenchable, indefinable thirst, she looked so haggard that Seamus’ throat locked up and he turned away to look at Blaise.
All of them, reduced to grappling in the dark, wounding—even killing—with their bare hands. Blaise swallowed against the nausea, and his side ached like dull fire, a reminder that some nightmares were inescapable. He wondered who else might be down in this winding, rotting pit, who else he might recognise today.
“You…” Harry licked his lips, heart pounding. “How long?”
Luna, very gentle. Harry’s step faltered, and that was when it hit him, a tide tugging at the ground underfoot. He caught his balance against the wall. Neither of the others seemed to notice, but the magic shielding the castle shifted in a subtle, physical way. Harry swallowed.
Something went askew inside Draco. He flung his pack to the ground and spread his arms wide. “That’s so touching,” he snapped. “I’d expected you to do this hand in hand, but go on. Please, express your undying gratitude to me.”
She summoned her courage. “One of the Death Eaters hit him.”
Draco stared at him, eyes both empty and full. Muted outrage was there, but it was secondary to the hopelessness. Harry’s chest burst into an angry fire. He yanked his shirt on, then turned and gripped Draco’s arms with both hands. “Do not leave this room. I’ll be back.”
Down the next hall, more bodies. Hermione both tried and tried not to look at their faces. Half of her didn’t want to know, to acknowledge the full magnitude. Something in her understood that the second she was able to stop and collect herself, she’d remember every single face. She’d start putting names to features. How many of them were even dead? What if they were alive, unconscious and injured, and she and Ron were running right by them?
He sagged against the table, head hanging. “Thank you, Hermione,” he whispered. “Luna.”
A spasm wrinkled Malfoy’s forehead. “Not in Azkaban. I thought of you after… afterward.”
“Ginny Weasley was an excellent choice for your bond, Harry.” Dumbledore’s voice had not risen to accompany Harry’s. He gazed out of his picture frame, and Harry was reminded forcefully of being lectured. “She has always had a connection to you. You have always been close to her and you have always trusted her. The combination of your magic and hers would have been formidable.”
“You’re feeling it.” Pomfrey drew his gaze back. She did not even look at Blaise and the spell she’d cast over him, but he knew what she was talking about. “I suspected when
Potter’s hands paused and he looked at Draco for a moment. Draco could suddenly feel all five of Potter’s fingertips and his palm against his skin.
An unbearably beautiful creature was in his bed. Draco’s muscles were a sensual flow beneath his skin. Harry found the white scar from York marring hip and back, and followed it like a silken ribbon. Draco’s hand climbed to his own mouth. He bit his knuckles and squeezed his eyes shut and shook. Harry gave in, placing his lips over the curve of that throat, and Draco’s hand kneaded back into his hair. He swallowed convulsively and Harry found himself attending the movement with this tongue, copying it, worshipping, unable to resist.
Something woke her.
Tight pain coiled in Ginny’s chest. It was an old wound, with little rips and tears from innumerable sources. A razed castle, a night full of fire instead of holiday cheer. A family broken in half. Dead faces she didn’t want to see anymore, though her dreams supplied the images every night. And the pain of waiting, of not
“I don’t think so.” Female, tinted with a dead quality that lanced through his vertigo. “Hold still for a moment, Malfoy.”
her mind whispered traitorously.
In an instant, Draco was struggling, body still surrounding Harry but trying to gain distance. Harry grabbed his hips instinctively, clenching his eyes shut at the discomfort. Draco halted, shivering, and Harry made a sudden decision, not lifting, not drawing back, but holding Draco firmly where he was. Draco’s fingers curled into a fist against his flesh.
“Dumbledore?” Draco cried incredulously.
“Are you alright?” he murmured.
“So rude, Ron. You should learn to share.”
It was different when you’d fallen asleep in those arms, when you’d tasted that sweat and those moans, held that body quivering on the edge, and finally been the one to gently push it over. When you’d heard sacrosanct words you could not return. When you’d done all of it while picturing someone else.
“I’m so glad to see
It was also then that he realised just how much sway Harry Potter held.
Theodore had known, and had let it happen anyway.
“Cheers, Harry.”
He didn’t want to ask because he didn’t want to know. Didn’t want to see the reality staring him in the eye. But it was like trying to stop a flood; eventually he would be forced to see it coming. “Is it the same…” He felt rather sick. “The same bond, then?”
She nodded. For a long moment, Draco couldn’t move. Then he shifted his hand off of hers, gripping the edge of the stone. The moss cushioned his fingers and tendrils of magic crept up his arm. Draco shivered and watched the rain sheeting down around them.
“My dear boy. Sometimes we must sit back and allow others to remind us of our worth. Especially when we ourselves have forgotten it.”
Malfoy nodded. His chin lifted. Harry frowned and studied the arc of Malfoy’s neck. Still so poised; his whole body seemed to be clutching at the stance it remembered, even as it withered.
On his way past the door, he hissed again. Kept walking. Once he lost count of how many times he’d circled, Blaise sat down against the wall out of the door’s direct line of sight, and waited. Except for his occasional hissing, the room was as silent as a tomb. There was a strange echo from the hallway outside, as though the vastness of the chambers themselves were whispering. Blaise rested his head against the wall, uncertain of how long he’d been sitting. Hissing.
A spasm crossed the Potter’s dirty face. “Trust me. Go slowly.”
“Fleur?
Something stirred. “Harry. The Death Eaters we ran into, they knew I was with Malfoy.”
When Draco stumbled through the door a few minutes later, face flushed and eyes feverish, a certainty locked down in Harry’s chest, too big and too solid to be his alone. He made it to sitting up before Draco took hold of him and flattened him back to the mattress, pulling at his clothing and planting his nose at the side of Harry’s throat, setting teeth against his skin. Inhaling, breathing him in, and finally rocking their bodies together until neither of them could stop.
Hermione’s heart leaped into her throat at the announcement, but Moody only heaved himself away from the table with a sigh. “More arrivals. Who is it this time?”
Pale fingers twitched over black fabric. Then, slowly, hesitantly, Malfoy lifted the edge of his sleeve, casting his forearm into the light.
There shouldn’t have been such a commotion; people had been trickling into the castle hour by hour, tiny clusters of exhausted strangers and acquaintances, a few friends. But they were all tired and all sent to rest without any unnatural ado. This time, for some reason, the arrival caused a ruckus.
“What about the bond?” Seamus choked out.
Kingsley frowned up at him. “Can she do that, too?”
“An hour? Why didn’t you say?”
He urged them together again, thrust up and into Draco, and was rewarded with a full body shudder at the same moment that Draco let out a cry—it sounded torn from him. Harry met his eyes and found them dry, hooded and heavy. Draco attacked his mouth, rolling his hips down, tugging Harry close. They fell into a rhythm that Harry felt he’d always been lost in, somehow, some way. He couldn’t define how or why, when it had first begun, but he recognised it. Something inside him knew it and opened to it. For an instant, he felt as though
When Draco eased free of him, he barely felt it, more understood the intent and helped it along. Every part of him was a warm and solid weight, and he could hear Luna’s music again. Just music, and lovely. No torture in the notes.
Harry reached out, took her hand, and she gripped his fingers again.
Ginny looked down, uneasiness coiling in her stomach. “We didn’t really talk about it.”
Yes, this was the chamber he’d been seeking. Relief washed over him, settling his nerves. It would be the ideal place to call the snake. Once he had the serpent inside with him, he could close the door, throw a warding spell up, and then it wouldn’t matter if the Death Eaters felt it; they would never get in before he was done, as long as he was efficient.
No wandering about. I expect to see you sleeping in my Infirmary when I get back.”
Harry straightened, unsettled. He glanced at Ginny and found her looking back, the same confusion on her features. Then her cheeks pinked and she turned away. “They… Well, it’s been… I don’t know how long since they’ve been having—” Her flush deepened.
But the image of Draco Malfoy squeezing Pansy Parkinson’s hand had burned itself into her memory so deeply that she could see it against the trees. Perhaps it was a coping mechanism, a method of forgetting why she had really ended up at St. Mungo’s that Christmas Eve.
Oliver carried Luna outside in the mist of mid-morning. Her bone-white fingers trailed along the stone wall of the castle. She sang: her voice leapt into the open air and flew, louder but somehow weaker as well, no bounce of the echo to play upon the ear.
“You know,” Ron managed breathlessly, collapsing on his back, “I think I’m too drunk to do this right now.”
“What do you
“And then,” Su said without even pausing, “if you do this—” She grabbed a jar from the table and handed it to Hermione. “Here, go on.”
“I do wish you wouldn’t keep doing that,” Harry breathed out, a faint smile on his lips.
There was nothing except Pomfrey’s words swirling around and around in the blackness of Harry’s head. Hermione’s hand lay on his arm, a dead weight.
“They’re…” Ginny grimaced. Gestured. “Harry. And—and Draco.”
Her eyes had already closed, her body limp in his arms when he reached the bed in the corner. He laid her down and her hair spilled out over the white pillow. In the last gleam of the coals, it almost had the lustre of moments before. Harry touched her sunken cheek, then settled the blankets over her. Luna did not stir. She lay nestled in the bedclothes as if she had always been there.
He knew he should check to see if Goyle was still alive, but he couldn’t bring himself to find out. If Goyle wasn’t alive, Blaise would know he’d killed him. And if he was… In all good sense, there was no way Blaise could leave Goyle alive if he knew. Every logical instinct inside him was ordering against it. He would have to kill him there in the hallway, without magic. While Goyle was unconscious.
Ginny pressed her lips together. Looked at her hands. “Well, I don’t think he was wrong.”
Harry could do nothing except grip his hand, try to hold the despair at bay. Wasn’t he supposed to make everything right again? The utter fragility of Seamus at that moment struck him forcefully, and then expanded into a horrifying net. He was their leader, yet he couldn’t save any of them. Their bodies, their minds and their souls, were just as vulnerable as his.
Well. At least they’d done it underground.
“That’s not what I meant,” he said heatedly. He lifted Blaise’s hand in front of their eyes. “Are you hurting? Is it worse when he’s far away?”
Draco shook his head. He laid his palms against the mossy stone and went light-headed at the power pulsing through him. “They’re standing stones. It’s a sacred place, centuries of earth magic. We’ll be safe from anyone wishing us harm.”
“No,” he said shortly. “I’m—No. I’ve made an absolute mess of this. Luna, what about Ginny?” He rubbed his face and thought about the hope in Ginny’s eyes, and the fact that it stirred nothing within him anymore. She’d been so willing, and he’d bollocksed it all up for a couple nights spent where he yearned to be forever, and for what? To fuck everything up with some well-placed words and a similarity to someone else? He wanted Draco, but couldn’t seem to keep hold of him. He had to bond, but he couldn’t ask it of the person he wanted to bond with.
“Didn’t know Luna could play harp,” Ron ventured. Hermione nodded importantly, even though she’d been about to say the same thing.
She clutched Ginny’s wand with numb fingers.
Again, Harry had to drag himself back to the present. He slipped so fast, always without realising he was doing it. He pressed his knuckles into his eyes, kneaded them hard until the pain speared some of it away. “What?”
Had he really? How could he have, when she didn’t truly know the Harry she thought she loved? And how could he not have, when she’d loved Harry for so many years? Because that was obvious: the way she fought for him, the verbal weapons and the steadfast loyalty even when Harry was nowhere near. Merlin. How many lives was he, Draco, going to blast apart before the war took him? Had he finally finished or were there more to wound, more to break?
Some are dead, like Crabbe. Some are imprisoned, like Goyle. Many just risked the Minister’s wrath and stayed home. Pavarti says that Lavender outright refused to come, stating “Azkaban, Hogwarts. What difference does it make, they’d both be prisons to me.”
All around them, the wind presses in and he feels like they are seconds from being struck by a hurricane. In fact, now that he observes their surroundings, Malfoy seems to be actively whipping up a gale by accident. It scratches Harry’s cheek as he explodes, “Potter, I will-”
-------
At dinner that evening, Harry feels a vast stretch of distance between himself and the people around him. Their words and conversation all merge into one hum, which rings in his ears and grates at his skin, almost itchy in the sense that Harry has the inexplicable and demanding urge to scratch at his whole body. The only definitive syllables he can discern are those of Uncle Vernon. They pound at his head the entire meal; after a while, he acknowledges, without feeling, that he has dropped his spoon in his soup. He feels, but doesn’t see, Hermione’s watchful eyes. A prickling sensation alerts him that she is looking at him, and that he should probably act normal, and fucking eat his fucking dinner like a happy and functioning person- but he can’t bring himself to care.
“What?” he responds, agitated by her cryptic comment. “What’s that noise for?”
Shaking off the chilling thought, he tries to tune into the conversation between Justin, Hannah and Neville.
They drain their drinks until the last bubble disappears, and then order another round. Once these are also happily absorbed into Harry’s bloodstream, they set off for a wander around Hogsmeade. It is a much more enjoyable experience than when he was here the last time, after stepping out of the station. Now, he is pleasantly buzzed, and the cobblestones are slippery beneath him. Ron tumbles over and, grasping for a nearby surface, brings Hermione down with him. They collapse onto the ground in a heap, and Ron almost cries when he realises Hermione grabbed at his hair in the fall, pulling out another few strands.
“No need,” Harry answers, quietly delighted to hear so many words fall out of Malfoy’s mouth at once, “It’s not my fault that you're lurking up and down the corridors like a slimy git.”
The less time he spends alone, the less likely he is to be overrun with these dreadful thoughts. He doesn’t want to think about Malfoy and whatever might have happened to him to make him so feeble- so formal- and so secretive. Harry had envisaged the boy coming out the war relatively unchanged, still with that aggravating yet imposing presence that screams
“Malfoy, please,” stifles Harry, swallowing down a sob. Whispering, he says, “I can’t do this. Please.”
A part of Harry’s grand plan includes spending more time with Ron and Hermione. First and foremost because they are his best friends, and the love that he has for them is embedded deep within him, has become as fundamental to his living as the lungs with which he breathes. Secondly, and perhaps selfishly of him, because they are a distraction.
Still, it is probably time to accept other help- something not from an inanimate object, no matter how much of a connection he feels with it. And even then, he can recognise that it’s not so much a loving bond, but more of an unhealthy obsession based on dependence.
He arrives at Malfoy’s desk.
“I am very certain,” says Malfoy, turning away.
During his Defence lesson, the class morale had been significantly lower than normal, not excluding Harry. He had slumped over his desk and picked at his nails until they started to feel sore. This didn’t deter him, however. Rather, he just picked harder out of spite; he did this until they started to bleed, raw and stinging from his hate-fuelled attack. Their poor Professor had spent the entire lesson cracking jokes in an attempt to lighten the mood, but they fell upon deaf ears and cricket chirps. Even Hermione appeared to not be listening, her gaze uncharacteristically glassy. The saving grace was Neville, who had shyly cracked a grin and laughed, awkward and false, if only to appease their teacher’s ego. Where the students would be without his jovial attitude, Harry dreads to imagine.
“Just wondering if you’re going to insist on following me up here every night, or if I can expect a peaceful evening tomorrow,” remarks Malfoy dryly.
Immediately, every corner of the room is filled with the buzz of animation and frenzied confusion. It only serves to increase in volume as friends begin to discuss what precisely this means. Harry thinks he has never seen Hermione so invested. Head lolling and eyes half-lidded, Ron, on his part, has the air of somebody who could drop dead in sleep at any second.
“Welcome. Don’t worry, I’m not expecting you to return the compliment.” She smiles and moves to a cross-legged position opposite him. Grabbing a bunch of daisies from around her, she starts creating a chain out of the flowers.
. He had never envisaged being back in a classroom again- for learning purposes, that is.
“Uh…” Why is it that every time Malfoy opens his ugly mouth, Harry feels the metaphorical rug being pulled out from underneath him an inch more? Whatever workers run his colossal catastrophe of a brain must go on strike, because Harry has no idea how to answer that. This must be why he so elegantly says, “What?”
. He thinks Malfoy knows that too.
to be doing. The rest of Wizarding society would have Harry send Malfoy to jail if they got their way. They would stick him and Ginny in a house with a white picket fence, and at least one child on the way. He would also be in Auror training already, and though it felt like the best plan in the summer, before Kingsley passed the law that said they had to get their NEWTs first, he now can’t fathom anything worse.
Certainly alive, Harry will give him that.
When he picks it up with a grin, he finds that he isn’t frightened by what could be written on it like he initially thought. It’s only Malfoy.
She nods, grudgingly accepting his point, but says with integrity, “Someone like you, Potter, would be invaluable to the Ministry. I can’t think of anyone more fitting for the job. If I'm honest, I am more than a little baffled at your decision.”
“Yeah, he is. We’ve been friends ever since I was small but over summer we started darting.”
“Uhm..” Not a strong start. “I don’t suppose you’ve, uh, lost any papers recently, have you?” says Harry, deciding he may as well poke the fire, and not daring to take the time to regret his decisions, follows it up with, “Notes or anything of the sort?”
Surely enough, as his fingernails get dirtier with soil, he loses himself in the rhythm of repotting. For all his awkwardness in their adolescence, Neville has grown into an astutely aware individual. He seems to sense Harry’s reluctance to speak, and respects it from a safe distance. The sun streams through the glass roof of the greenhouse, blocked only by the untamed ivy that rules the place, and not the other way around. Wood and earthy smells drift in and out of the open window. He likes it here.
He neglects to tell her about the ball of light, since he isn’t one hundred percent convinced that it was even real or tangible in the first place. Though, he got here somehow- didn’t he? However, as he has stated time and time again, he appears to be fated to run into Malfoy at the most inopportune moments- whether it be in life, or (near) death.
It might be ten minutes or twenty- possibly even an hour, time is fluid past a certain point in the night- when he hears the telling rustling of Justin climbing into bed. With his senses so cut off like this, he finds that he listens to every minute detail. Even if he didn’t know that Justin was the only one who would be getting into the bed beside him, he would be able to tell from the specific noise of his movements. Unlike Anthony, whose steps are heavy and indicate his girth, Justin moves like he is worried he will hurt the ground with the weight of his feet. Gentle and slow in pace. And, likewise, vastly different to Malfoy who, despite his newfound placidity, still travels swiftly and with certainty everywhere he goes. Malfoy doesn’t walk so much as
Harry tries to ignore the tension in his chest which strikes him with hard blows to the stomach- once, twice, then three times- at the mention of the war. Just because he is having a better day than usual, doesn’t mean that he is excused from his normal triggers. Oh well. He can’t be too disheartened- miracles don’t happen overnight, he supposes.
“Still though, that’s tough, Justin. I’m sorry. I thought Muggles were generally quite accepting of you lot.” says Neville.
Lest allowing the thaw over his mind to creep to any other areas of his body, he cracks a grin and jokes, “Well, thanks, but you know I’m not technically a teenager anymore, Professor.” As quickly as snapping a biscuit, the tension breaks. As it happens, the saying ‘fake it til you make it’ works after all.
with Malfoy- it is draining him, and yet somehow, as proof of a living oxymoron, it makes him feel so very alive.
please leave kudos and comments it is so appreciated xx
How deluded has he become, he thinks, shaking off the memory, that he’s missing Malfoy’s posh arrogance.
He dreads what he is about to do even more with every passing second, but he can’t deny himself this one, idiotic thing. One of many, granted. Needless to say that regret will inevitably chase him but he can take it. Knowing that Malfoy is alive, that he will have another opportunity to belittle Harry, leave him tingling-
He gets a flashback, and sees himself as the two unidentified boys who beat Malfoy up. Harry hadn’t been about to do such a thing,
“So if it’s consensual, why can’t they do it?” asks Harry.
. When has it ever worked in his favour? The very existence of Hogwarts and magic itself denies reason, when you really think about. His entire life is illogical. There is no reason to get worked up about it now.
“Yeah, maybe not. You’ll find someone else,” says Harry, watching the colour grow stronger until it spreads across his nose too. He wonders if it feels warm; his fingers itch to find out.
“Harry?”
. His attempts to make himself less curious are hollow, and he knows it.
“I’m sorry, I hate to disappoint, but I’m really not.” Harry scoffs in disbelief at her invasive and, frankly, weird comment. Butterflies flutter in his stomach, for a reason unknown to him. “And I’m Harry.”
She continues, “I know what happened, not that I was purposefully listening, of course, but they were being dreadfully loud. I heard Padma talking to Hannah in the library and she said that she overheard Malfoy refusing to speak. Apparently he is feigning ignorance about the whole affair.”
Falling into their room, the first thing he notices is that Malfoy is not there. He allows himself to breathe a sigh of relief, and revels in this feeling, pushing the humiliation at being so dramatic to the backseat.
“If you insist. I’ll ignore the fact that I’ve seen you crying at least twice this year if you ignore how I suck on my thumb in my sleep,” Justin says grinning, and Harry can’t be mad at the comment when he remembers how utterly, hilariously true it is- he has in fact seen Justin having a gnaw on this particular body part, but hadn’t even considered it weird until now. He is just used to people’s coping mechanisms, he supposes.
There wasn’t anyone. It wasn’t real. It was just a memory. It was
“Oh, forgot to say. I usually live in Scotland.”
“Too much weight was placed upon you, yes, but also upon all of us. It made us forget that you are only a teenager, like every other student at this school. For that, I feel I must apologise. We should’ve done better,” Mcgonagall says solemnly. The atmosphere of the room has dampened even further, like someone has wrapped the room in a wet blanket, and Harry cannot stand it.
“No, I’m fine,” he lies, “Did we know it was going to be that bad?”
Seeing the wounded look on Ron’s face, Harry rushes to apologise, awash in guilt. He is being a dick, he is painstakingly aware, and Ron is fulfilling his role as both best friend and boyfriend perfectly. It’s just a lot- all of it.
Alas, he is here for Justin.
“Lemme get that,” says Ron and Hermione holds out her face in anticipation. For a moment, it seems like Ron is actually being a tentative boyfriend in helping her remove the stain, before he takes a particularly wet blob and smears it across her cheek. She gasps and smacks at him in mock horror, as Harry burrows into the warm couch cushions, enjoying the familiarity of the exchange.
“I have toast, beans, eggs and bacon for you, they’re pretty good,” says Ron and Harry pointedly doesn’t mention that he more often than not cannot even manage to butter his own toast- so has it been buttered? Where is Kreacher when you need him? So many questions with pitiable answers.
“Yes, Potter. Congratulations, it appears that you’ve finally managed to acquire the skill of listening. It really is rather useful,” says Malfoy, tone parched, and he rolls his eyes once again.
His heart is light now, chest lifted above the waves which threaten to drown him.
is news. It is the exact kind of happenings he had foreseen in coming back to Hogwarts. The suspense, the panic, the constant threat. It may always be his home, in some twisted nostalgic shape or form, but it has also brought him so much misfortune that he isn’t sure he could recount it all in one sitting. Frankly, he is sick to death of it; he wants no further part in this bullshit. If only Malfoy wasn’t bang smack in the centre of it all.
As he pushes the door open carefully, he notices two things. Firstly, that the layout of the room is unfamiliar, with the beds in rows of two, both rows facing each other from either side of the room. It feels empty in here, the pathway of moonlight highlighting the room’s lack of use, punching its way down the middle of the dark, bare floorboards. Secondly, that Malfoy is sitting up in his bed, opposite what Harry can see is his own.
His voice is close to silent; there is a hint of fear and sadness woven in with his words. It is the oddest thing Harry has ever heard him say. If he hadn’t regarded him himself a few moments prior, Harry might have questioned whether it was even Malfoy lying in that bed, or some imposter.
He runs to the Hospital Wing for the second time in the same day, clumsy and probably spotted at least once. How the Invisibility Cloak is supposed to hide a grown man is beyond him.
“D-don’t let me stop you from your, uh, fun,” stutters Harry, repeating the same stupid sentiments as earlier. Seamus laughs but rapidly reenacts the lip-locking sequence when Dean looks daggers at him in warning. Couldn’t they just move to the dorm room? There is plenty of sweet, sweet privacy there, where upon their arrival, innocent eyes across the castle would be spared. Like Harry’s, for example.
Suddenly, Harry sees a flash of white in his peripheral vision. Malfoy is a few rows down, his body only just visible at the edge of the table. He is once again sat up straight, scribbling neatly on a piece of paper; his tidy pile is a massive contrast to Hermione’s own desk. His glasses are nowhere in sight. Oddly enough, Harry notices that he is tapping his legs obsessively. Is he anxious? Maybe he is just bored. It doesn’t matter- seeing Malfoy display any kind of outward emotion seems to ignite a mix of curiosity and relief in Harry.
“He’s a tosser. I know he wasn’t technically on the Dark side during the war, but he may well have been. It’s obvious the only reason his family didn’t dedicate themselves completely is due to some political power play. I’m all for forgiveness but he’s so smug, as if he’s a saint. It gets on my nerves.” Justin had said, justifiably in Harry’s opinion, and Malfoy had frozen solid. Harry had moved to change the subject as subtly as possible, in order to avoid a fight. Whilst he may have been itching for a go with Malfoy the day prior, he wouldn’t wish such a pathetic brawl on Justin. Those pointy elbows do look as if they could poke an eye out.
He is unsure in what direction he is heading with this, but like hell if Malfoy thinks Harry will be willing to let him slip away from him after such a dragging week. Who knows when he will see him again? He hasn’t been back to his dormitory once as far as Harry is concerned. Not even for the glasses case which he can’t help but keep noticing, perched upon Malfoy’s desk.
It’s Monday morning and he is currently trying to muster up enough courage to leave the confinements of his bed. Around him, rustles of activity as his roommates get ready alert him that he should wait a little longer to emerge. He doesn’t feel like sporting an uncomfortable half-smile, nor does he have the energy for small talk.
Malfoy rolls his eyes and Harry gets the idea that he knew he was doing anything but sleeping. Then, faster than lightning, he throws a tiny piece of paper at Harry and stalks back to his own bed. It pokes him in the eye with the sharp corner and Harry scowls at his retreating back, judging it being purposeful.
The jolting vibrations from the floorboards through his bed frame which were small now grow stronger, and Harry realises that Malfoy has put on those boots of his. He smiles minutely to himself at the memory of his lopsided figure hobbling down the entrance way, one foot displaying that loud lavender sock in all it’s grand purpleness.
He is now once again walking around the grounds aimlessly, his only goal to not give in to whatever demon is plaguing the castle. It is more difficult said than done, and many times has he felt his eyes prick with tears for no apparent reason. The irrevocability of it makes him feel weak, and he keeps his eyeline low, ashamed to look up though the only judgement he would face is from the sky itself. In a way it is worse; he would almost rather be teased by a first year than have the pressure of his mind and the earth’s eyes on him.
breathe- again.
In all the commotion, Harry still doesn’t forget what his goal for the evening is. He heads to his room and contemplates getting his Marauders Map out. Ever since being back, he has been reluctant to use it. It almost feels creepy now, whereas before he just saw it as an obligatory, saving-the-world kind of thing. Hence, why he is currently considering using it again. This could be important.
He poses this as a solution now. “Why haven’t they done any Pensieve memory checks, or Legilimancy even?”
so..... thoughts???? things WILL eventually come clear i promise but like as if draco will tell everything straight away we just know that boy loves his drama. i honestly wrote the last bit on a high at 3am so is it good? probably not? it’s purely just...maybe our boys are finally deciding to stop being stupid tho <3 also who else loves that draco is literally like you’re stupid and harry is just sitting there, heart eyes about his hair and smooth skin. me too bby me too. also i’m dying over the fact that we’re gonna reach 100k soon and they’re literally only just beginning to get onto speaking terms. talk about slow burn oops sorry baes

No. It is more akin to one of Uncle Vernon’s choice- sung by old English singers which he would have dug out with an exclamation that it was his father’s favourite. Aunt Petunia would’ve dutifully nodded along to the droning voice, dragging throughout the entire house. Then it would get stuck, and Vernon would spend the whole afternoon blasting the darned thing as it replayed the same tune. He would shout, splutter and shove at Harry until Harry couldn’t remember anything but the stupid sounds of the moment. All night the song would round in his head until it was almost painful. In retrospect, it was probably so because he had had nothing else to busy his mind in his plain and uneventful life.
And the arguing began again.
Draco nodded. Kept nodding. Potter looped the strip of his cloak around him again and tied it with deft fingers. “It’s long, Malfoy. I don’t know if this will hold it.”
Three days and not a hint of anyone following. Tracking. Ginny supposed it was a good sign—no, a
He looked Malfoy up and down. “I intend to find out.”
No, Malfoy had not known names. Yes, he had considered a possible threat to his family. No, he had never attempted to warn his mother. The slow, painful fall of his face as each question presented itself showed Harry more than enough about what Malfoy’s opinions of his actions were in this matter.
Harry kneaded his forehead. He just wanted to sleep. No, he wanted to get back, join Draco again, and then sleep, because only then would his dreams be quiet again, he was sure. He couldn’t even imagine not resting beside Draco anymore, and he wondered briefly just how far their bond had progressed. “Hermione, I can’t.”
If Blaise had been caught, they might have found out who Draco had led off into the night. Or if Finnigan had fallen into their clutches. The people in the castle were inaccessible, thanks to Lovegood’s spell. Draco knew enough about the Siren’s Ward not to doubt its power. But that only left one other option.
She saw the quick glance Harry and Moody exchanged. If they hadn’t done it at the same moment, she wouldn’t have thought anything of it. “He’s not near here. Seamus won’t just be able to ‘find him.’”
And now Draco.
“But you did care for him, Draco.” Blaise stroked the back of his hand with his thumb. “Even if… it wasn’t the way he wanted you to. You were his friend.”
“It’s the circle,” Draco said. Ginny saw him at last, sitting a few yards away with his back against a larger stone. Indeed, the stone was giving off a glow that beamed out around the edges of Draco’s cloak and hair. Ginny ran her fingers over her own stone. The surface was warm.
It was only when Ginny sought out Dumbledore’s portrait and demanded satisfaction from him that she’d finally been forced to silence her argument. When it came down to it, she could not call Albus Dumbledore a fool, even if she could still pin Harry as one.
On the other side of the table, Remus looked up. His face was deeply lined, but his attention was keen. “Yes.”
As the night wore on and the students still in the castle were ushered off to bed, Hermione found herself caring less and less about the adverse effects of Firewhisky. People with far too much energy—properly illegal when it came right down to it—were stomping about the dancing space and hollering far more raucously than the music called for. The twirling of Penelope Clearwater and the phenomenally fast tapping of Professor Vector’s heels were making her dizzy.
care?” she asked in a shrill voice.
“An echo of it. That’s how I knew something wasn’t right. It made me feel sick, but Draco, he was ten times worse. It’s never been like this.”
It seemed long ago.
An ominous thudding sizzled through the room. Blaise got to his feet and staggered against the wall, gasping at the fire climbing its way up his arm. Poison. She’d bitten him. He’d known, of course, but… Salazar…
Madam Pomfrey had dosed George with several elixirs, made him comfortable, and gone down to the kitchens to set more potions brewing. “I’ve plenty of them,” she’d muttered. “But they take time to make and I’d rather…”
“It’s okay.” She didn’t care if they knew she was there. She just had to see for herself that they were breathing, living, out of harm’s way.
A vague sort of panic throbbed at Hermione’s nerves. She squinted, and the ache rolling in her skull expanded. Ginny was looking at her, eyes wide with concern.
**originally posted 2/1/07**
“It’s a sight,” Harry allowed. He listened to the gentle melody Luna fell into. If it had a colour, it would be the gold of poppies under a setting sun. “You sound beautiful today.”
An entire day passed. And then another.
Her mouth opened, but nothing came out and she shut it again. She blinked rapidly and Harry was sure she was going to cry. His innards rebelled—He’d
“How many?”
“Seamus, are you…” Harry leaned toward his friend, worried for an entirely different reason. “You’re sick. You’re sick, too.”
… that was where they’d be safe.
“No, wait.” Millicent stepped between them. “We can use him, we don’t have to kill him! Just—”
The truth was, he wasn’t sure if he really wanted to find Draco. The chance that everything might come spilling out, that he, Harry, had sent Blaise to what would be his ultimate demise, was devastating. Harry might do one of two things when he saw Draco: he might grab him and haul him into a kiss that he had no right taking, followed by as much as Draco would let him get away with, or he might confess and break Draco’s heart.
“If he’s under a hallucinatory spell, trouble doesn’t even begin to cover it,” Moody muttered. Harry lifted a hand without looking behind him.
* 	* 	*
“It is my business if you’re putting my life on the line to do it! This little—”
The war had eaten up yet another part of him, and he’d just stood there—no, lain there, for fuck’s sake—and let it happen. Thrust into it until it died a slow death, bloody well welcomed it, pulled himself up against it, and let his senses explode into a frenzy off of it. Had he no self-control at all? Obviously not; he could even remember the sounds he’d made, the words he may or may not have spoken aloud with the night’s blackness pouring in through the windows, and where was Weasley? Had she known? Had she been waiting for Harry while the two of them had both taken a little solace from the war, a dirty-quick thrust and release and a few scant hours of peace, until the next avalanche fell upon them?
“I’m sorry. You really couldn’t care about any of those things.”
“Luna can do it,” was all Harry said.
“I need something, too,” she muttered as she walked. “My  brother’s dead… My mother’s Merlin knows where, I, I haven’t seen—” She rubbed the tears angrily from her eyes.
“Draco,” Harry said, then feared the use of the name, the tumbling of a secret. But Luna just guided her fingers over the strings of her harp. Very sluggishly, actually. The tune was distorted.
“I assure you, even I do not know all ends.” Still so calm, so bloody unconcerned! Even as he twisted his threads into their final knots, as he surveyed the finished tapestry looking for flaws. Harry’s hands hurt from clenching. The image of Draco as one of those threads, not himself but Draco, and Hermione, Luna, Ginny—
“She will be a fine companion, Harry.”
“Luna,” Oliver started, but she answered before he could go on.
“Could…” Ginny’s first word cracked and she cleared her throat, swaying in her seat. “Could a bond like this affect others somehow? Other people.”
The sound of branches rustling outside brought Ginny out of her stupor. She hurriedly closed the lid of the box and wound the scrap of cloth around it, then set everything to rights in the satchel. A few well-placed pokes had the bag looking rumpled and undisturbed once more. She scooted back to her cloak and drew it over her body, then concentrated on relaxing. When Malfoy returned, things would be exactly as they had been, or she was no member of the Order.
