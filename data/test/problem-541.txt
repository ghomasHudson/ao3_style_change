“You do that, Potter.” Wrenching open the door, Draco left, vowing to stay as far away from the arsehole until he returned to France in the fall.
“Oh, fuck off. I don’t have to listen to this.” Draco shot out of his seat, fury burning through him. A decade of keeping his nose out of trouble, running a successful, above board business, and he was reduced once again to “Death Eater scum” the moment he’d set foot in England again. He was of half a mind to turn right around and head back to France, and let Pansy find someone else to give her away.
The response from the intercom was too low for Draco to make out, but the receptionist started nodding, then directed him down the right side of the room where a row of offices ran along the wall. Steeling himself for whatever unpleasantness awaited, Draco made his way towards the largest office at the end that the boy had pointed him towards.
Halting at the empty reception desk, he drummed his fingers on the counter impatiently. An Auror who looked vaguely familiar did a double-take as he walked by, then hurried off towards the rows of cubicles set farther into the large room. He ignored the murmurs starting up as heads popped out of cubicles, focusing instead on the young man who was hustling towards the desk with a half-eaten muffin in hand, his expression apologetic.
“Obviously.” Draco kept his tone just this side of snide with effort. Wouldn’t do to piss off the man who could make his life very, very difficult during his stay in Britain. At least, not this early into his visit.
A flash of amusement crossed the other man’s face before he leaned forward and shuffled through the mess of papers on his desk, finally drawing out a thick folder from under a haphazard pile. Flipping it open, he paged through it without a word, much to Draco’s growing irritation. Finally Potter looked up again, regarding Draco with a look of contemplation on his annoyingly handsome face.
Draco was absolutely not going to acknowledge the silken danger in Potter’s tone was one of the sexiest things he’d heard in years. How disturbing. A clear indication his sexual dry spell had lasted well beyond advisable. Mentally, he shook it off, focusing on the other man’s actual words instead.
“I, um… it just says you have to go. There. Go there. I’m sorry, Lord Malfoy, I don’t know more than that. They don’t... give me details, just a… a memo. Sir,” stammered the clerk, thrusting said memo out in front of him like a shield. Snatching it up, Draco stood, his mood worsening at the prospect of dealing with the bumbling morons upstairs, who clearly wanted a go at the big, bad former Death Eater before graciously allowing him to wander free in their precious country again. As if he wasn’t here under extreme duress already. If it were up to him, he’d be happily ensconced in his Paris flat, fast asleep and dreaming of lavender macarons.
“Malfoy,” he replied, looking at home behind the desktop name plate that proclaimed him Head Auror, his red robes slung over the back of his chair, the first two buttons of his shirt open to reveal a triangle of tanned skin. Draco looked away from where his gaze had snagged on the dark hair that curled at the base of Potter’s throat, his heart thumping as he raised his eyes to meet the other man’s again. Setting his jaw, he pulled out one of the visitor’s chairs and lowered himself into it, settling his body into the careless pose of someone who wasn’t in the least disturbed by the fact he was sitting across from the man he’d one considered his biggest rival— and nemesis.
At this point Harry had broken to a run and was so close to Gryffindor tower that he did not need to reply.
Draco was seething as he watched the Irish twerp hold court at the Gryffindor table, laughing up the attention he was getting from all corners, he was waving his arms wildly re-enacting some great scene from his life. Draco sighed deeply,  he wanted Harry to be happy but did it have to be with this great idiot. Look at him, he thinks he is Merlin’s gift to men and women. Harry was nowhere to be seen and Seamus did not seem to be letting that bother him, almost every eye at the table was on him and he was almost glowing from the attention, Draco ground his teeth as the small Gryffindor winked at a blonde girl on the Ravenclaw table and slammed his fork down as she winked in return. Why is he even looking at other people when he has Harry? The idiot has no idea what he has, who he has, he has no idea how lucky he is. Draco buried his head in his hands and groaned. Unfortunately for him one of his best friends had chosen that moment to sit down next to him, ‘Draco darling that is so uncouth.’ Pansy complained in a bored tone. Pansy’s comment only served to make Draco groan again, past caring how pathetic he must look to his friend . The brunette girl sighed and placed a comforting hand on her friend’s shoulder, ‘Draco if you are so determined to let him be happy you have to move on, ‘she said with a concerned tone.  Draco turned his head slowly to her, pain momentarily flittered across his face before he managed to school his features in to a cool mask of indifference. He sat up slowly, ‘I know, ‘ he said quietly  watching as Harry entered the hall and was greeted with a smacking kiss on the lips from Seamus, Draco closed his eyes as Harry’s cheeks turned pink, ‘It just so bloody hard.’
Harry looked around at the other three boys and smiled, Neville was right, they really were friends, although he suspected Blaise and Neville were growing closer than friends, and, in that moment, it hit him, Harry’s eyes widened as he glanced at the back of the blonde head sitting next to him,  he played back their relationship through his mind as though he was watching a video, seeing it from the outside for the very first time and could see that they were no different from the two boys opposite them. Harry knew and had accepted that the way he felt about Draco was different from the way he felt about his other friends, he could not place that feeling before now, not really, not properly, but sitting here with his friends  and watching the small glances and interactions between Blaise and Neville, knowing they mirrored their own he knew exactly what it was, he was beginning to love Draco, or he thought he was, he wasn’t really sure what love was. He risked a glance at the blonde boy, whose features were lit by the fire light, tiny shadows lying across high cheek bones,  as he continued his animated conversation with Neville about the intricacies of the room they were sitting in and wondered if Draco felt the same. As if hearing the thought, Draco turned his head and smiled softly in his direction, Harry smiled back and imagined that it was a distinct possibility that he did.
As Harry talked Draco stood stiffly by his side, the two boys were still holding hand, each finding comfort in the other.  Draco had watched as Hermione’s gaze had fallen on their hands and waited for her comment. Hermione had wisely chosen to say nothing, however, Draco had already decided on a few Hex’s he could use in case she dared to insinuate he was weak. She had said nothing about their hands, but the concern etched in to her face had grown as the green-eyed boy had told her what had happened to them.
Harry turned and looked at Ginny, then back at Draco with a confused look on his face, ‘Malfoy what on earth are you going on about?’
They skipped down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbet was off them. No more dragon, what could spoil their happiness?
The potion’s master merely raised an eyebrow and stood to one side to allow the young man access. ‘Is Professor Lupin about?’ Severus, once again walked across the room and sat himself on one of the two armchairs that were before the fire, he straightened his robes across his knee before speaking, ‘Remus is currently in meetings, is it him with whom you wish to speak?’
Draco was already there pacing the floor with his hands behind his back. He’d heard a rumour about Harry and he needed to see the boy to find out whether they were true. Just then, the boy in question walked in to the room, h noticed the blonde boy pacing and wondered what was wrong.
‘You like Snape!’ spluttered Ron, ‘But he’s a man, but that means ...’ The rest of the sentence was left unsaid as Ron stared, open-mouthed at Blaise.
‘See you tonight’ he whispered before checking the coast was clear and running off after his friends.
Harry shrugged, not sure whether he wanted to carry on, was he just being stupid? , ‘no reason,’ he lied, ‘You were right, it was just something I heard in Divination.’
Harry looked, wide-eyed at the serious faces of his friends, ‘Some people never get one?’ Hermione’s face took on a sombre tone, she shook her head sadly, ‘No, not everyone is destined to find the one that complete them.’ Harry hung his head , ‘and you thought I was one of those people?’ he asked, so softly that Ron and Hermione had to strain to hear him. Hermione decided to be honest, ‘We did worry Harry. Honestly, we talked about it a lot and I’m sorry that we did that but, well we just couldn’t bring ourselves to talk to you about it with you, just in case…’ ‘Yeah mate,’ Ron interrupted , ‘and what with old moldy pants…’ before Ron could continue he was stopped with a sharp dig in the ribs from Hermione’s elbow, but it was too late. ‘Voldemort, what about him?’ Hermione sighed and shot Ron a dangerous glare at Ron who merely shrugged in response. ‘You see,’ Hermione began, ‘It was widely believed that Voldemort never had a song, causing what sould he did have, to be destroyed and well, you know the rest’. Harry’s eyes  widened as he realised the implications of what they were saying, ‘You thought I was the same?’ Ron decided to answer this time, ‘It was the connection mate, we were worried, there was no way to tell what it had done to you.’ Harry nodded slowly understanding what they were saying although it did hurt. Hermione reached out to touch his arm gently, ‘The pint is, that no matter what we thought it’s not true is it.’ Harry looked in to the earnest brown eyes in front of him, ‘Do we though. I mean how do we know I really havn’t just got a song stuck in my head and this time tomorrow it will be gone and forgotten . Once  again it was Ron who spoke up, ‘Tell me a bit of the song mate.’ Harry looked at his friend, ‘What?’ ‘Go on’ Ron urged, ‘see if I know it, maybe I can help.’
Scowling, Draco quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table. ‘Just looking,’ he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.
Hermione’s face lit up. ‘Well that is actually the easy bit, obviously they are in the castle somewhere… ‘ ‘What?’ Harry interrupted, ‘how can you possibly know that?’ Harry was surprised when it was Ron who answered, ‘Easy, the humming and all the bloody drumming, you wouldn’t be able to even do that much if you were any further away, the closer you are the more of the song comes through, the longer it goes on the closer you are and when you’re close enough one of you will sing and the other will answer.’ Harry was shocked at this, ‘What if we are in the Great Hall? That would be awful.’ Ron leaned over and slapped Harry on the shoulder, ‘Mate seriously, have you noticed people randomly bursting in to song all over the castle?’ Harry blinked and thought about it, ‘Well no.’ ‘Exactly.’ Ron said with a nod as if that was the end of the conversation. Hermione rolled her eyes, ‘Harry, what Ron is trying to say is that the very first time it happens only the two of you will hear it.’ Harry nodded and then caught up with what Hermione had said, ‘The first time?’ ‘Well yes,’ Hermione continued, ‘the first time is involuntary so it is just between the two of you but after that you can sing it whenever you want so therefore it will be out loud.’
Harry woke with a start, he had no idea where he was, he had fallen asleep with his glasses  on which was unlike him, he looked around, everything was green and silver, a memory tried to push its way to the front of his mind. Where the hell was he? Harry tried to move, he realised that the upper part of his left arm was dead and looked down stifling a scream as he did so. Recognition dawned on him as he looked down at the blonde head on his chest as he realised that it was Draco wrapped around him and it was Draco that was currently drooling on his chest.
In the Slytherin dungeon it wasn’t such a happy Christmas for a small blonde boy who lay crying in his bed. He too was alone but he wasn’t supposed to be, his father had returned him to Hogwarts yesterday but not after giving him the worst beating yet for looking at him in the wrong way. Lucious had then decided he would take Draco’s mother somewhere hot for Christmas and did not want the little inconvenience he had to call a son to go with him. He knew the bumbling idiot Dumbledore  took all the waifs and strays in over Christmas so, without a moment’s hesitation had sent Draco straight back.
‘Almost dinner, he brought you here before breakfast, you were having a severe panic attack Mr Malfoy can you remember what happened?’
Severus leaned forward, elbows resting on his knees, hands clasped out in front, ‘You’ll know, it’s hard to explain really, but it’s ;like a compulsion, you will need to be near the person, to touch them, engage them in conversation, interact, generally just be in their presence. In fact, most times it turns out that if you’ve known them a while your relationship has always been like that.’ Harry pinched the bridge of his nose, he couldn’t think of anyone like that, he didn’t even feel that way about Ron and Hermione, it was obviously someone he didn’t already know, he couldn’t decide if that was a good or bad thing.
The Great Hall seemed alive, a continuous buzz filled the air and it crackled with ancient magic. Harry felt his skin tingle with anticipation as he made his way to the Gryffindor table, this could be the day, the day he found the happiness he longed for.
‘Pig-snout’ he said to the Fat Lady, who did not look amused one bit at being disturbed from her slumber. She grumbled at Harry, he thought he heard the word inconsiderate and chuckled to himself.
So Harry took a deep breath and filled Neville in on everything from the day he met Draco at Madam Malkins right up to the argument with Ron and his subsequent punch, ‘and now all I really want is to see Drake so he can tell me that it is all ok and that he doesn’t hate me for telling Ron we are friends.’  Harry finished once again fighting back the tears. Harry looked up at Neville to gauge his reaction to the confession and found his friend thinking hard. Neville remained quiet for a minute before his face set in determination;
‘That’s fine with me.’ Said Harry reaching under the tree for his gift for Draco and making his way over to the sleeping area, Draco got up and stretched, reaching to collect his own gift he followed Harry and joined his boyfriend sitting cross-legged on the bed.
Draco jumped as the small package was dropped unceremoniously in front of him, he stared at it unblinking for a moment or two before poking at it with the fork he was holding. There was a piece of parchment wrapped around the parcel, slowly and carefully he peeled away the parchment and read the words that simply said,
‘What the hell were you dreaming about mate, you interrupted my wet dream about Finnegan,’ he asked, with a wink at Seamus who was blushing furiously. He smirked, as only a true Slytherin could and turned back to Draco. All eyes turned on him, waiting for an answer. Draco did not know what to say, how could he tell them all, especially the lions and Luna that had fought so bravely. Harry came to his rescue,
Harry felt the relief instantly, a cool tingling sensation enveloped the searing heat, curling itself around every part of it until it was extinguished.
You could say what you liked about Pansy Parkinson, she really didn’t care, she had heard rumours, most not true, some more true than she cared to admit. But  the one thing that you couldn’t say about her was that, without a doubt,  she was a fabulous friend. Draco had been her best friend since before they could walk, he was like a brother to her, him bleeding meant that she bled too, there was nothing she would not do for him. Seeing him destroying himself over Harry and Finnegan was eating her up inside but what could she do? She knew she should do something.  Draco was as devious and cunning as they come, he was ambitious and regularly fought for what he wanted regardless of whether he deserved it or not, but this time he deserved it, he really deserved to be happy. Pansy shook her head sadly, the boy had it bad, she had never seen him like this, as much as he wanted Harry he wanted Harry to be happy even if it wasn’t with him.
‘Oh I’ll go to the library first thing’ she said with a glint in her eye excited at the prospect of research. Harry chuckled and she suddenly looked at him;
The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped in to the corridor, Filch’s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness;
Neville looked at Harry who ,although still completely shocked, managed to shrug his shoulders, having no idea what it was Ron wanted and not being entirely sure how well it would go down with his boyfriend.
‘It’s not fair Hermione, why won’t he see me the night before the game Hermione was about to say something but Harry stopped her, ‘ I know, I know it’s best for me blah blah blah, but once a week is just not enough, I wish I could tell him that, jeez, I can picture it now, Draco I need to see you more, he’d laugh in my face, ‘ Harry whined, Hermione tried to stop him but Harry continued, oblivious, continued, ‘It’s sooooooo annoying, ‘ he groaned, ‘ just staring at his back in Potions and then sometimes having to wait two weeks to even speak to him properly, don’t get me wrong I know why, it’s just hard, and it actually hurts not to talk to him, I miss him ‘mione.’ Harry slumped on the desk as he was did not see Hermione’s small knowing smile as she saw the wide eyed look of complete shock on Draco’s face. ‘How is this normal?’ continued Harry, ‘I don’t miss Ron like this, mind you he is always bloody there isn’t he? God Draco would laugh if he could see me now, I’m such a sad git, and, to top it all off Snape’s bloody stalking me.’
‘Follow me.’ Neville said and left the room. He led the boys up to the seventh floor corridor and asked them to stand still for a moment, ignoring Draco’s muttered complaints about having to climb copious amounts of stairs for seemingly no good reason. Neville’s audience watched with varying levels of interest and confusion as the small boy paced backwards and forwards along the empty corridor in front of them, then suddenly, jaws dropped open and eyes grew wide as a large ornately carved door appeared on a previously blank section of the wall before them.  With a grin, Neville placed a hand on the door and gently pushed it open, he turned to the boys behind him, ‘Welcome to the Room of Requirement.
It only took a second for Harry to start kissing back, putting everything he had, everything he felt in to the kiss, he had no idea whether he was going to get a chance to do this again so he was going to make this count. He wrapped his arms tightly around the slim waist before him and pulled Draco flush against his chest relishing feeling the hard contours of the Slytherin’s body against his own. Harry deepened the kiss and moaned in to Draco’s mouth as a hand came up to run through his hair, he never wanted the kiss to end. But, just as the thought entered Harry’s head Draco pulled away, breathless he rested his forehead against Harry’s stroking the hair at the nape of his neck, his grey eyes glistened with something Harry could not name as Draco spoke, ‘You love me?’ Draco asked, unable to keep the awe from his voice, Harry started and pulled back slightly, ‘You what?’ Draco smirked and pulled Harry back to him using the hand of the back of his head, ‘I heard you, you stopped speaking Parseltounge you know, I heard how much you wanted to touch me, how much you wanted me, that you’re in love with me,’ Harry felt his cheeks burning but Ginny was right he needed to Gryffindor up, he swallowed and then nodded against Draco’s head never breaking eye contact, ‘I’m sorry but yes, you’re right, I’ve been in love with you since the beginning of the year, you’re all I think about, I dream about you, about being with you.’ Draco had closed his eyes as Harry began to speak, ‘Sorry,’ he opened his eyes, grey meeting green once more, ‘What are you sorry for? It’s everything I have wanted to hear, I love you too you prat, more than you could ever know’ and with that Harry was pulled in to another searing kiss.
When Pansy didn’t speak Ron cleared his throat and tried again ‘hey?’ Pansy snapped out if her trance like state and replied ‘hello is there something you need?’ Ron rolled his eyes at the formality if it all and took a step closer, he gingerly raised a hand to place on her left forearm wincing when she flinched away from the contact. Ron closed his eyes and took a deep breath, moving his arm back to his side, he was acutely aware if the scrutiny they were under and now he could hear his brother barking orders to the other Gryffindors behind him. He lifted a hand to the back of his neck and lowered his head slightly ‘so um I thought you’d be interested in what’s been gping on tonight,’ Ron was sure he didn’t imagine the almost imperceptible stiffening of Draco's shoulders or the small step Blaise made towards him before checking himself. His  friends were very lucky to have people that cared this much. Pansy nodded and spoke quietly looking at Ron though her thick lashes ‘Please’. With that one word and the way she was looking at him Ron knew he was a lost cause. He swallowed thickly and inclined his head slightly ‘we got back to the common room earlier and the Fat Lady had disappeared...’ before he could continue Pansy interrupted, ‘who is that ?’ Ron summoned some courage from his seriously depleting reserves and placed his hand back on Pansy's  arm, relishing the comfort it brought after the evening he had just had.
Draco stepped closer still, backing Ron in to a corner, ‘Harry was hurt, upset, betrayed, humiliated, frightened and blamed himself Weasley, and all I know is that if you have felt any of that today then I have done my job properly.’
‘You sure? And it sure sounds like you’re defending him from where I’m standing,’ Ron crossed his arms across his chest and stared defiantly at Harry,
As always, he felt the flutter of snitches as their eyes met, had tried to ignore them, knowing nothing would ever come of it, Draco would never see him that way, and anyway, he had Seamus now.
Hermione crossed her feet at the ankles and leaned back in to her equally overstuffed chair, ‘You know, how are you? Are things going well? Are you happy? Do you need to talk about anything?’
The wand exploded with the force of a small bomb, great chunks of the ceiling were falling in, the students quickly ran for cover , as suddenly as it started it was over, but now a great stone wall was dividing the chamber, Draco looked wildly around; ‘Harry, ‘ he shouted, his heart dropped as he heard the reply from the other side of the wall, ‘Drake?’
In the Slytherin dormitory Draco, noting the use of his nickname, sat a little straighter, took a deep breath and counted to ten before responding; ‘Go on.’
The next morning Harry sorely regretted staying up talking with Draco until the early hours as he was shaken awake by a very agitated  Oliver Wood demanding he get up for Quidditch practice,
Draco mumbled something that sounded suspiciously like ‘sugared hippos,’ and snuggled closer to Harry. Harry chuckled softly.
Harry found Draco pacing, he walked right up to him and wrapped his arms around him, trapping his arms to his sides,
‘Think my name’s funny do you? No ned to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys habe red hair, freckles and more children than they can afford,’ spat Draco.
Harry had never been so confused in his life and, considering the life he had led, that took some doing. The confusion was only heightened when Ron stood and gave him a manly slap on the back, ‘Mate I’m made up.’
Harry was furious, they were in the Gryffindor Common room and Ron had been spewing rubbish about Draco for a good ten minutes,
‘It’s an invisibility cloak,’ Draco said, trying and failing to stop his mouth hanging open.  ‘but, where? How?’
It was a suggestion of a spell that they could use against Snape if he tried anything on Harry again. Hermione thought about it, she’d read about it somewhere, the leg-locker curse, that could work she thought . Hermione looked across the hall at the Slytherin table and managed to catch the blonde’s eye, Hermione nodded once then turned to Harry and Ron and explained the curse that she had just read about and how she thought it would be helpful to protect Harry from Snape.
The portrait swung open and Harry threw himself in to the Gryffindor common room, every head in there turned to stare at him, he heard the whispers following him as he raced up the stairs toward the dormitory taking them two at a time, he swung around the door frame in to the dorm and stopped dead at the sight that greeted him, the dorm room was covered in almost everything that he owned, pages of his homework and text books littered the floor, even his clothes had been pulled from the trunk and were scattered haphazardly throughout the room. At that moment Harry had never been happier that Draco had borrowed the invisibility cloak, with that thought he glanced at Neville raising a questioning eyebrow, Neville caught on to the meaning of what was being asked and glanced quickly towards a seemingly empty corner of the room, Harry felt his shoulders relax knowing that Draco was here in the room with him.
‘Really?’ Harry asked ‘ How come?’ Slowly the boys started sharing stories of Christmas’s past, each telling horror story after horror story about their lives and how and why they had never enjoyed a Christmas until today. Draco’s hands balled in to fists as Harry had told him about last Christmas, a rage boiled inside him as he heard how, on that Christmas morning Harry’s uncle had beaten him to within an inch of his life and then locked him in his cupboard for the entire day. Draco propped himself up on his arm and watched Harry telling him the story as his eyes never left the ceiling. As Draco watched, tears began to form a clear film over Harry’s eyes. Draco had never felt rage like it, he felt like his head would explode, he hoped he would get the chance to meet Harry’s uncle one day, he would make sure that the man would never forget the day he met Draco Malfoy. Harry had stopped talking and was staring at Draco, he saw something in the silver eyes that concerned him, he touched the blonde’s hand;
Pansy had insisted that they go bare foot and Draco felt the chilling coldness of the castle’s stone floors with every step, but she was right of course, the three children hardly made a sound as they crept through the shadows. Each of the Slytherin’s had a dark hood pulled down over their faces and were almost invisible to the naked eye. The moonlight left bars across the floors that stretched like long fingers up the walls of each of the long corridors; these were avoided at all costs.
While he watched Neville, a nervous lump had formed in his throat but there was nothing else for it. He swallowed down the lump and forged ahead.
Harry’s new red-headed friend Ron was taking him through the finer points of a game called Quidditch when the compartment door slid open. Three boys entered  and Harry recognised the middle one at once: It was the blonde boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. Harry’s smile spread across his face as Draco fought hard with himself, he so wanted to return the smile but knew he would never live it down if he did. Harry watched Draco’s face with interest. He could not explain why but he badly wanted the silver-eyed boy to smile back, but, for the moment he was happy with the quick glint of happiness that had momentarily passed across Draco’s eyes, obviously this boy had a bit of a reputation as a hard ass. Harry inwardly chuckled and said, ‘Hey Draco.’
‘Stay there,’ he said to Draco and then walked across to the other side of the room, ‘now take your pendant off and lay it on the ground,’
Stunned silence followed the boys Ron and Hermione were first to return to their work and soon others followed suit. No one bothered the boys again.
‘Harry, Draco,’ screamed the red-head gesturing wildly at the blonde next to Harry on the bed, Harry looked down at the almost blue Slytherin at his side and jumped to his feet immediately, he scooped Draco in to his arms and ran as fast as he could to the hospital wing bowling down a rather grumpy fourth year on the way.
Firenze dipped his front legs so that the two boys could climb on, Draco helped Harry on before climbing on behind him and wrapping his hands around the boys waist.  As Firenze walked back through the forest he slowly began answering the questions that the two boys were asking him about the hooded figure and why it had been drinking unicorn blood. Harry could not help but gasp when he heard the properties of unicorn blood and the link that it had with the Philosopher’s stone that lay within the protection of the castle. He wondered aloud who would do such a monstrous thing and risk being cursed forever.
Draco forced a grin on to his face as cheers and catcalls erupted from the sea of black and green that was the Slytherin table. Draco was grabbed in to a hug by one of the girls and received multiple high fives and back slaps. People were clambering to shake his hand shouting their names at him. Draco doubted he would remember a single one.
Draco bit his tongue at all the comments he wanted to make regarding Harry having Slytherin in him and smirked.
As if hearing Neville’s thoughts Harry stopping rambling and tan both his hands through his already mussed up hair whilst letting out another long breath, ‘if it’s ok, I want to ask you about you and Blaise’ ‘Ok,’ Neville replied leaning forward to rest his tanned forearms on his knees, ‘Go on,’
Harry felt his face burning,  that had to be the single nicest thing anyone had ever said to him, he knew already that he was more than just a celebrity to Draco but that had confirmed it. Harry was speechless.
Harry’s eyes snapped back to her, ‘His what? Tattoo? What? Where?’ Ginny chuckled at his reaction and pointed, thankful that Draco’s eyes were still closed, ‘There look, his rib cage.’ Without looking she knew the exact moment Harry had spotted it as there was a distinct groan from behind her, ‘Merlin, and just when I thought he couldn’t get any hotter,’ Harry’s tone was hushed and  almost reverent as she turned and faced him. ‘Harry this is your last chance, you have to say something.’ Harry swallowed, ‘I know, I will, just, one more drink.’ Ginny sighed, she remembered the first time she caught Harry looking at Draco with something other than malice in his eyes, it had taken her by surprise at first, but then, as she had thought about it she had realised it actually wasn’t that surprising. There had always been something about those two, they gravitated towards each other, and they could find each other without question even on the busiest of streets. It was like destiny that Harry would fall for him, one the war was over and all preconceived notions of good and evil were out of the way, it was the only rational thing left. There is a fine line as they say and then she had caught Malfoy looking at Harry in that same way and knew it was only a matter of time, yet here they were, the last night at Hogwarts and neither of the stubborn fools had said a word. It was tonight or never.
“What – what are you doing here, Malfoy? You’re doing magic in front of muggles and telling them about our world? What are you doing to them? Have you forgotten about the Statue of fucking Secrecy?”
Draco smirked, “Yes, I remember. You were a right little rule breaking prick.” He sobered quickly and then, almost under his breath, said, “It’s different for me. You get to do that. Not me.”
A memory of Ron trying to call him at the Dursleys at the beginning of his third year came rushing to him. Harry’s heart picked up a couple of notches.
A feeling like curdled milk pooled in his gut, creeping on to his back. The hand holding his robes twitched as if to wipe it off. This shame was a living thing that came with him wherever he went.
Harry swallowed thickly and moved his way towards Ron. He was surrounded by people but as soon as he saw Harry he moved towards him.
As he prepared to Apparate, he couldn’t help but feel he was missing a part of himself. Something, until now, he hadn’t been aware he had owned. And as the darkness swallowed him, a small tug at his heart beckoned to keep him here. To keep him home.
“Go to St Mungo’s. I need someone immediately. Muggle poisoning, possibly by Deadlyius, restriction of airways. Then go to Kingsley. Tell him I’ve broken the statute and a team needs to be sent.”
He crossed his arms over his chest, rather self-conscious now that he was here. All his bravado had worn off the second Potter had stepped through the wards with his hair standing on end and an incredulous look on his face.
Harry looked at the faded envelope in his hands and the previous night’s ridiculousness came back to him with an accompanying wave of nausea. It was from Kingsley. A personal letter, from his personal owl to Harry himself.
Harry could hear his own teeth grinding in what now must be pure rage. His voice took on a deadly tone. “Smith, tell me you put a tracking charm on him. Tell me you didn’t just send out a civilian into fuck knows where with no way of finding out where he is should he be moved?” Silence. “You need to leave the room, Smith because if you don’t I won’t be held responsible for I will do to you.” Harry’s hands were shaking and he looked wildly around the room. “None of you thought to stop him, no? Just sat there and let them send in someone who is –“
As instructed, he made a show of checking the bonds and began to read the two men their rights. The press were pushing in closer and it took everything in him to not flee from the place.
If Draco was unnerved it was certainly impossible to tell. He was relaxed in the chair, as if it were his office instead. He examined the glass and brought it to his nose. Suddenly, a smile broke out over his face and he threw his head back and laughed.
The detective offices were not far from his own. They shared a communal kitchen and some small rooms with their partners. Ron’s was the farthest away and the only one Harry had ever been in despite the length of time he had worked there. He rapped on the door and went inside.
Harry took a rather large gulp from his pint and scratched his beard. It was a new addition to his look. He had finally gotten over the shock of seeing the bearded version of himself in the bathroom mirror in the morning.
“Listen here,” the shite-van owner bellowed from his window, “If I unpack the crates here, you’ll never get it up the bleedin’ hill!”
“I know but we were both there. Nothing is going to happen, it wasn’t your fault. We’ll look into it so it doesn’t happen again. Everything’s alright, we’ll –“
“Okay fine…he says to me – ‘darling if you haven’t had this you haven’t lived.’ And then he hands me this ridiculous looking thing and he calls it-“ The man breaks off in a fit off giggles. “He calls it a Naughty Niffler! Can you believe it?” He cackles wildly and his friend slaps him on the back with a grin.
Draco turned his attention to the pitch, abandoning all hope for his ice-cream. “Shit, they are good.”
“Hey,” Ron called. The others felt the need to smile professionally at him. Except Patil, who winked. She took notes as Ron asked Harry questions about what he had seen, ideas on the suspect and anything else he felt was relevant to include.
Harry came around the side of his bed and sat on the stool. He breathed deeply and took Draco’s hand.
This began the thought process of who, at Hogwarts, knew Seamus and knew enough about muggles to first survive in a muggle village and had a decent understanding of pubs and mixing drinks. He tried to name as many muggleborns or half-bloods he could think of that would possibly fit the bill.
Finally, he added a colourant - a potion that he had created himself while bored, which turned the drink from a muddied colour to a vibrant, toxic green.
Spells were being cast everywhere overhead. He had to duck as one of the men they hadn’t seen had come from the shadows and began throwing curses all around.
“Exactly, would you look at the state of it!” He sat up now and dramatically turned his head for Harry to see apparently see something he didn’t think was there.
Harry’s mind was in overdrive, straining to think of conceivable way to save the man who was gasping and dying in front of him. Faces floated across his mind. Those he hadn’t managed to save. Snape, Colin, Remus…Sirius. It was as if his brain had short-circuited. No connections being made and panic rearing its ugly head and climbing up his throat.
Slowly, Harry moved forward, coming in between his pale legs. Calloused fingertips pressed themselves to Draco’s cheeks, caressed the tip of his nose and under his eyes.
“Yes, you practically run this shitehole anyway, I’m hardly ever here. And I’ve told you to stop calling me Tempy. Temperance, my name, will suffice.”
“Hi….um…can I…what do you want?” A flush was spreading across his face, of course it was, as he stuttered and stumbled over his words.
When Draco made a small noise in the back of his throat, hands snaking at Harry’s sides, he pulled back and headed for the door. He didn’t look back as he swung the bag on his back and closed the door firmly behind him. He wished he could just lock Draco in behind him. The remaining working part of his brain, the part that wasn’t continually chanting ‘Draco, Draco, Draco’ at him, knew that the Aurors would need to speak to Draco. He would have to brief them on what he knew about Fotheringham and the town but it still filled Harry with dread.
It was like he was wearing a bright crimson bib. He never thought blood could move so fast, could be everywhere all at once. How could a person have this much blood, surely it wasn’t possible.
Draco’s back was to him, fussing over the napkins on the table when Harry came up and hugged him from behind. He could feel Draco smile, hands still moving over the table.
“This is weird, right? That I’m standing in your kitchen? That you’re cooking…something and I’m making tea.”
Harry still wanted to fixup Grimmauld Place but, for now, this was perfect. He was away from everything that had caused him to wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat and instead was currently living a peaceful existence. Well, as peaceful as a person could live when living with Draco.
Harry’s eyes widened and felt slightly horrified until Draco chuckled at the morbidity of his statement. Harry shook his head, “They shouldn’t have even been there, I was so stupid, Draco –“
“It’s – I’m not sure…could be possibly something with Deadlyius because of the quick reaction time and the smell.”
“I have a bed, Potter.” It occurred to him that it perhaps wasn’t the best idea to rescue his ex-nemesis from a forest and then invite him into his bed but he was going with it now.
“Honestly, nothing happens here. People go to work, they walk the hills, go out for a drink, people are happy…the rugby team is fabulous. Incredibly so.”
When they had walked for a few minutes in silence Harry was close to bursting with questions. Intrigue. Something. Draco’s demeanour had changed dramatically. He was sullen and holding himself tightly as they made their way back to the pub.
The side of Ron’s mouth turned up slightly, whether it was disbelief or amusement Harry wasn’t sure. “Are you alright with Harry taking your statement?”
Draco’s stomach took a dive, and his mind immediately went to listing the emergency exits. “Shit. Shit, shit, shit.”
The players had split into two groups and were running about and dodging each other in such a way that it looked like the game was choreographed. Sidestepping each other and anticipating the opponent’s moves and never missing, always hitting the target. It was unbelievable.
As he took the elevators, punching the button to Kingsley’s floor, he briefly wondered what his life would be like now that he had officially quit his job. There was a fear, definitely, but an exhilaration too. That he was finally done with it, with the humiliation, the embarrassment of it. He had let it go on far too long, hopeful that it was only temporary. And as time had passed and nothing had changed, he waited for the public’s view of the ministry or the academy to improve and do something to inspire some kind of trust in its people.
Many were confused at Hermione’s career choice, being as brilliant as she was she could have chosen anything and most assumed that field would be politics. She had surprised them all, however, with curse breaking. Harry and Ron had not been as surprised. She was a sucker for anything to she had to puzzle out and her job held the slightest bit of danger that kept her on her toes. The insane amount of reading, research and writing also made it a no-brainer.
The room around Harry was deathly silent, he could hear his heart thud in his ears. He didn’t dare glance at anyone.
Harry’s hands went to Draco’s shirt and Draco held his wrists. “Harry – you haven’t seen me without a shirt.”
His hands were on Draco, in the sea of red that was trying to drown them both. Harry’s hands were on his chest, trying to compress the wound but he couldn’t see where it was. His clothes made it hard to tell.
“Course they do, I’m not poisoning them.” Scott laughed heartily and then screamed at some poor sod called Johnson to pick his feet up.
“Perhaps you used up your quota of doing great things already and now you get to do what you want. Number three?”
Draco’s eyes focused sharply on him and he knew that he was now fully awake. Harry waited for the moment Draco would calm, realising it was all over. Instead a sob erupted from his thin chest. One that tugged something loose inside of Harry, something that would from then on have Draco’s name attached to it.
“Yes. But you can take the day to pack, have someone feed the cat, I’ll owl the paperwork and instructions to you and then you can be on your way.”
The guard held out his hand for the merchandise and Harry complied, red faced and still spluttering.
Draco sighed heavily and picked at the invisible lint on his trousers. “I presume they thought it an unnecessary caveat to add. Any close contacts I had either refused to associate with me any longer, had fled the country or had similar rules imposed on them. And for everyone else…who would be willing to side-along a Death Eater?”
Harry was in full strategy mode, firing Draco with questions about the town and its inhabitants. He knew he was probably going overboard, throwing questions that Draco had already answered, but to his credit the blond was patient and also clearly concerned with the events that were unfurling in his new home.
Draco knew he was fortunate now, however. Fortunate that he had only served a few short months in Azkaban. Fortunate that, rather than snap his wand, the Ministry had only restricted him from Apparating and using any form magic considered uncouth by polite society. And being refused entry in every wizarding job had stood him in good stead. He had left England, everything he knew, and moved to a small village in Scotland. Not too far from Hogwarts that it could still feel like home. Where the people were direct but friendly and their lilting voices washed over him like a balm.
“…yes, I suppose I could. Can it not – ah, I see. Shall we meet, say, four o’clock?” Draco frowned suddenly. “I – I guess, yes that’s fine. I can come alone. Thank you, goodbye.”
The phone rang from the other side of the room. Draco huffed and went in search of it. He found it under an enormous stack of pillows.
Harry gazed over the heads of the journalists and fixed his eyes upon the roofs of the picturesque villages. Thatched roofs under painted clouds and rolling valleys spread out around them. Some owls were swooping down to rest on the chimneys and Harry had to look away.
“I’ve contacted Kingsley – he’s going to see if someone can do some sort of re-routing if you will on the Apparating tracker. Hopefully, they can see if it will attach itself Side-Alongs too.”
Harry went to stand aside to let him make it when Draco shook his head and dragged him back over. “Well you’re the inspiration for the drink, darling, I think it is you who should be making it!”
Harry had remembered this bleak section of training. If the person you were looking for appeared to too far gone to save then catch the bad guys and try not to contaminate the scene as much as was possible. But he knew that Ron would not ask this of him and even if he did Harry would not grant it.
As soon as the door was closed behind them, Draco jumped in the air and pumped his fist. “YES! We did it – that slimy bastard! I bloody told you he was dodgy. Did I do alright? Say the right things and everything?” He looked so very dear to Harry just then, all smiles and bright eyed.
Harry ran his hands through his hair and wondered for the second time that day what was going on with him.
This had eventually led him to serving his own mad creations to muggles at a fraction of what he should have because what even was muggle currency and…it had somehow worked out. He ran the most popular pub in the town and people liked him and they fucking loved his drinks. Mainly because he was confused about measurements and mixers and his drinks were ninety mostly pure alcohol.
The van that Fotheringham sent was held together by sheer force of will and a firm reluctance to spend penny when it wasn’t needed. The fumes were nauseating as they stood and argued with the driver, black smoke billowing from the rear.
“I will.” Harry grinned smugly but faltered when Malfoy grinned catlike, cream on his lips, as if this had been his plan all along.
He now came onto the question of how to send the bloody thing. Hermione was his best bet and would be the only one still up and near envelopes.
Draco had never taken a sick or holiday day since and both Tempy and her ill fortuned nephew were thankful for it.
“Yup, apparently there is. Some idiot has been opening their mouth and blabbing to muggles about stuff they shouldn’t. We’re not too sure how far spread it is. So, we want to send someone there, find out what’s happening, give them a talking to and then modify the muggles’ memories who have been affected.”
He nodded at Ron and walked over, trying his best not elbow anyone in his pursuit as he didn’t fancy a rough shove in return. Robards had already left the room and was climbing the rickety staircase before Harry had reached him.
The creeping feeling was coming back under his skin. The feeling of being useless and out of touch but he was not giving up. Not yet. There were parts of the town he hadn’t explored and people he hadn’t spoken to. He would figure out what was going on. Anything was better than being a performing monkey at the ministry.
“Think about it, right? He has all this money, he’s invested in different businesses it seems. He works with the woman at the apothecary – who, by the way, can’t even remember who her supplier is for the acne cream that is definitely a potion. The rugby team are using a liquid luck potion - 100% and –“
The first thing he’s hit with is how busy it is. The entire place is packed with people, which explains why the rest of the pubs are empty as he reckons half the town is currently in here.
“Hi – sorry, you don’t know me, but...I…what were you talking about there?” The two stared at him, mouths gaping. “It sounded…interesting,” Harry finished lamely.
“I am aware of how owl post works Harry but why on earth are you sending a letter at this time of night? And drunk?!”
Harry groaned loudly to the empty room who was sullen in response to him. How could he have been so stupid to get drunk and send the bloody thing? Why did Hermione allow him to do it – she was usually his stupid detection alarm.
She moved forward in the queue and began to place her order, which must have been for a large gathering as she had to read from what looked like an extensive list. She was engrossed in her conversation with the person at the till and Harry could find no way to interrupt to keep the conversation going. Soon she had a bag in her hand and was heading for the door. Hesitating with one foot literally hanging out the door she turned around and smiled at him.
Harry frowned and Draco smiled at him, touched his face delicately. “You’re so beautiful. How did you get to be so beautiful?”
“Okay,” he said because he didn’t have any other words left within him that he could afford to leave.
Handing a cup to Draco, he forced his eyes to remain on the cup lest any dangerous pieces of pale skin be on show.
Draco nodded and began to fetch a tray and pull glasses down from the shelves above the bar, he truly felt fortunate being quite tall, or tall enough to reach most shelves.
“Draco! Draco, stop. Will you please stop, you’re legs are longer than mine.” He didn’t stop but he did drop his pace for Harry to catch up with him.
They made their way over to the aisle where Harry stood looking at the newspapers. Harry smirked as they began bickering over the latest football results. Apparently, the referee was a ‘complete nutter’ and ‘couldn’t tell his arse from his elbow’.
So he attempted to order his thoughts in a way that would make sense. At any given time, Harry had a list of things that caused him to lose sleep and a longer list of the ways in which he had failed to fix anything.
The next thing he takes in is how bloody loud the music is. The song ‘500 Miles’ is booming from the speakers on the walls and the crowd randomly scream the lyrics. One person, a middle-aged gentleman, is on a table and looks as if he is singing to redhaired woman behind the bar. She is shaking her head in response and passing him a drink of something weirdly colourful for his efforts.
The flat was the opposite. Warm, cosy and inviting with soft furnishings and bare wooden floors. Tempy, being his boss and landlord, had thankfully given him free rein to decorate it how he pleased, and Draco took liberty in doing so. Yellow and white gingham curtains donned the kitchen window and enough pillows to open a personal soft furnishings shop on every seat. His bedroom was the only room that hinted at his life as a wizard. Green and silver sheets on the bed, one waving photo of his mother, a few books he ignored. That was all he had; all he could bear at present.
He rolled his eyes at himself. It had taken at least two years for Draco to unlearn all his past behaviours. He had to continually work at it. Stitch by stitch he unwound all his supposed beliefs and opinions and examined then, usually lay like this after a busy night at work. It was a tedious process, but worth it. It was so typical of Potter to just show up unannounced like a hurricane and send all of Draco’s good intentions running for the hills.
As the elevator dinged and slammed open, he considered taking up gardening to keep him busy now that he would be soon having a lot of free time. He gingerly stepped out and began to walk the metaphorical plank to Kingsley’s office. Marion, his assistant, gave Harry a toothy smile and motioned for him to sit in a small chair. The chair was exceedingly small and had perhaps originally been something else and was transfigured. It made him feel like an oversized child outside the headmaster’s office. He thought that description wasn’t too far off the real thing.
Harry couldn’t quite believe how peaceful he had looked just a few moments ago and now he was like a cauldron overspilling, fumes and all.
“Come on, Harry he isn’t completely defenceless,” interrupted Henry, the great idiot that he is. “You’re acting like he’s some damsel in distress. He’s got grit, he’ll be fine and dandy.”
Harry nodded, struggling to come back to himself. He pushed his fingers through his hair and exhaled shakily. “What p-potion is it? I can’t recognise it.”
Potter then changed his line of questioning to focus on the drinks which Draco could tell was really vexing him, even beyond the open display of magic in front of the pubgoers.
“As promised,” Draco said and did a strange little bow, his hand pressed to his chest. Fotheringham smiled widely and beckoned him inside.
He was attracted to women, absolutely, but something was…missing? Like he was trying to cook something but missing a vital ingredient: the food was edible but didn’t quite hit the spot the way you would hope. It wasn’t like he had a problem, exactly. He could be horny, he could have sex, but it just felt like it could be better. Maybe it was just him, something wrong with how he was.
Potter paused for a moment and studied Draco’s face; it was unnerving. “You’re up to something and I’ll find out.”
Smith’s face fell and a bright flush accompanied his ruddy complexion. He walked past Harry and muttered ‘prick’ under his breath.
“Fine and dandy? Tell you what – anything that happens to him, I am going to do to Smith. Someone go let him know!” Henry looked like he was debating whether or not this instruction was sincere or not.
The street was empty. He could hear some drunk but distant voices from one of the many pubs in the town but besides that not a soul could be seen. It was strange.
“Well, I think if Cher and Sherlock worked together they would be amazing. Secondly, you’re definitely right about the bad luck thing. Your first assignment in ages and you end up in a quaint muggle town and the only wizard for miles is me.”
Hermione tilted to her to one side, Harry had to hold back a snort at how much she resembled an owl at that moment, ‘What?’ he asked his friend as she continued to stare at him.
Draco shrugged, ‘Nope, that is just what I am best at, however Transfiguration holds my interest the most, so do I get to ask now?’
Draco snorted, ‘A little, I’m sure that’s an understatement, I still don’t know how you convinced me that this was a good idea, and for that matter Weasley too, I am still not happy with him you know.’
‘As if I wouldn’t Harry. For Merlin’s sake what happened? Who did this to you?’ Draco asked with barely contained rage.
The taunts had followed Ron from class to class throughout the rest of the day. He was sitting in his least favourite class but was grateful that it was the last class of the day, he could not waot to put the horrid day behind him.
Harry chuckled as he basked in Hermione’s enthusiasm. Ron was staring at the exchange with a look of complete confusion, he thought that they hated the know- it- all, his forehead wrinkled as he tried to figure out what was going on and what exactly he had missed. Then suddenly he snapped to attention, he had just remembered what he had missed, the fight between Harry and Malfoy. Ron glanced at the Slytherin table as he sat down, the blonde didn’t look bruised or bloody like he expected, in fact, Ron thought he looked really happy. This thought filled Ron with dread as he turned to look at Harry who was still whispering with Hermione he realised Harry looked really happy too! Ron’s confusion spread and he could not stay quiet anymore.
‘Yeah babe I’m good thanks,’ Seamus sat down by Harry’s head and ran a hand through his hair, he placed a soft kiss to the top of Harry’s head, ‘What you up to?’
year boy’s dormitories. The one that did not wake was the one that was screaming. Draco Malfoy was screaming a blood-curdling scream, his fringe clung to his forehead with the cold sweat which was pouring from it, he was writhing around in his sheets screaming No! No! No! The others students looked at each other concern etched on their faces when suddenly Harry stood and walked across the room to Draco’s bed, without a word he lifted the sheets and climbed in next to him, and, as he had done many nights over the summer he wrapped his arms around the blonde and pulled him close so that the boys back was pressed against his chest. ‘Ssh’ he whispered, ‘I’m here,’ Draco stirred slightly in his sleep and then he was quiet.
Since their break-up Ron and Hermione had begun to form an uneasy truce, it was tentative and in its early stages and purely for Harry's benefit, it had perhaps been helped along by the fact that Ron had decided to strategically avoid Pansy at all costs as, after hearing her confessions on the hospital wing and his subsequent break up with Hermione, he wasn't exactly sure what he wanted to say to her. Ron and Hermione were far from friends but currently they were civil enough to make Harry's life marginally easier.
Harry looked nervously at Draco and answered ‘ Dare?’ although it came out as more of a question than a statement. At his answer Blaise’s smirk grew wider, ‘Ok, let me see, I dare you to sit on Weasley’s knee for the next four questions.’ Blaise said this without taking his eyes from Draco and witnessed the dangerous look appearing in his friend’s eye at the dare. Blaise did not mind, he could handle Draco.
Harry watched Draco as a look of realisation crossed his face, he put his hand in to his robe and found a rolled up piece of parchment, looking around him Harry took the parchment from his pocket and carefully unrolled it,
Draco ran his long fingers through his blonde hair and chuckled, ‘Yes Harry friends,’ after a few minutes of companionable chatter Draco stood up and brushed the dust from his immaculate tailor made, black and green silk dressing gown. He held out his hand to Harry, a worried look crossed his eyes as he remembered the last time he had made this gesture to Harry, he needn’t have worried Harry took his hand without hesitation and Draco helped the smaller boy up.
It had been a long night, Draco had not slept and had been snapping and sneering at anyone who dared approach. Blaise and Pansy had long since given up trying to reason with him, being Draco’s childhood friends they had stayed over at the Manor many times and they each had a room that they could call their own in Draco’s own wing of the manor. Tonight they had forgone their usual comfort on favour of staying to support their blonde friend, though each vicious remark made them regret their choice more and more, however they stayed, they knew and understood that he was worried but it did not stop them wanting to hex him in to oblivion each time he opened his mouth.
‘Blaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiissssssssseeeeeeeeeeeee.’ Whined Draco, ‘C’mon,it’s Chrriiiiiiisssssssssssttttttttmmmmmmmmmaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssss.’ Draco dragged the word out as he stuck out his bottom lip, ‘ I want my presents.’ Harry couldn’t help but chuckle at the perfect picture of a spoiled brat his new boyfriend was making. However he also wanted to get to the presents and knew what would get Neville moving, the delicious selection of baked goods that were a sure thing from Ron’s mum, ‘Nev you ‘wake?’ he said to the other lump in the bed.
Marcus Flint stepped forward shoving his broom in Ron’s face, ‘Make that seven two thousand and one’s ,’ he snapped, ‘not that you could afford even a splinter of one.’
Harry was alone in the boys dorm catching up on his charms work when he heard the door creak open. ‘Hey baby.’
‘Wow, that’s gorgeous,’ said Draco, ‘I must say I prefer mine though ,’ with that Draco pulled his own pendant from his shirt, in Draco’s palm sat a glittering silver snake with an emerald eye, ‘I love this you know,’ he smiled at Harry. Harry started as though he had just remembered something.
Harry felt the heat rising in his cheeks and felt utterly ridiculous, why would Draco want to stay? And he most certainly did not feel what Harry felt around him, he had called him his best friend, that was it, they were friends, nothing else, he had just completely humiliated himself.
‘The need will get stronger, it will pull at you until it’s all you can think about’ Severus continued, ‘then suddenly you will find yourself locking eyes with the other half of your soul and the song will just burst out, you won’t know it’s coming and you can’t stop it, you’ll hear the reply and you’ll know.’
Harry had purchased a Pensive for himself after a suggestion from a mind-healer. He needed to be able to free his mind of all the things he had been through whilst not forgetting the things that made him who he was today. Ron had asked to use it and removed the silvery thread as he had done many times before to use the Pensive ready to share his most prized memory with the man who was like a brother to him.
Blaise rolled the parchment up and made a strange clicking noise deep inside his throat, within seconds a large black owl appeared in front of him, Blaise held out his arm for the beautiful bird, ‘Hey Hermes,’ he greeted the Malfoy family owl, ‘Can you take this to Hermione Granger for us please?’ Hermes clicked in response , spread her wings and left the room.
Draco tensed up, he felt that way about Harry, and now Harry was about to tell him he felt that way about someone else, he let out a breath and felt his arm tense across Harry’s chest, ‘So erm, who is it that you think, you know, I mean,’ Draco felt ridiculous, he had never been so inarticulate in his life, he swallowed and once more closed his eyes, ‘so who is he then?’ he managed to ask. Harry watched in wonder as Draco struggled through his question, as Draco closed his eyes he turned on to his side to face the boy, he swallowed hard and summoned the famous Gryffindor pride as he placed a hand on Draco’s cheek, Draco’s eyes flew open in question as Harry answered, ‘You, you daft bloody git,’ before pressing a chaste kiss to Draco’s lips.
Transfiguration started off as normal, McGonagoll was discussing the theory of turning a living thing in to an inanimate object and Ron was doodling on his parchment. He was sitting at the front next to Seamus, the Gryffindors on one side of the room and the Slytherin’s on the other. Pansy, Draco and Blaise had decided to sit on the second row for the front for two reasons, Draco had placed himself directly across the aisle from Harry who was sitting behind Ron and he also had a perfect view of Ron. Unbeknown to many people Draco had a secret love of origami, he had been doing it since he was a young boy as a way to amuse himself during long, lonely hours at the manor and he had become quite adept at making any animal, he had decided to put this talent to use during this lesson, he knew he was risking the wrath of McGonagol but he decided that it was so worth it. Before the lesson Draco had made several tiny spiders out of paper and which were currently sitting in the pocket of his school bag waiting for a whispered charm from Pansy.
‘ I got it back..’ Harry started quietly but before he could finish they heard voices out in the corridor as the Great Hall began to empty. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist and pulled him further back in to the shadows.
‘Come on, bed time,’ Draco stood up, brushing the dust from the seat of his trousers and holding a hand out to Harry, Harry took it and stood.
Draco screwed his eyes up tightly and rubbed them hard with the tips of his fingers, he waited a second, not knowing whether he wanted it to be true or not, then opened his eyes, blinking as they readjusted to the dull light. He could not believe it, he blinked one more time, just to be sure, but no, there he was, as sure as Draco’s chest was rising and falling with each breath he took, Harry Potter was there, trying and failing to hide in a dusty corner of Borgin and Burkes. A million and one things crossed Draco’s mind at that moment, he really did not want his father to see his Gryffindor friend, he however wanted to speak to him so much if only to admonish him for wandering around Knockturn Alley and alone for that matter, did the boy simply not know how dangerous it was, especially for him.
Snape stared at Draco with a raised eyebrow, ‘excuse me, but I can assure you that although I do feel something akin to dislike for the Potter boy I have never attempted to harm him and would prefer you did not make such accusations.’
Draco threw himself down on to his bed and drew the curtains around him. He reached under his pillow and drew out two of his most prized possessions, his parchment and Lyra his lion cub. AS always, he automatically brought Lyra up to his face and inhaled deeply, the smell did funny things to his insides, it drove him crazy with want and need to be with Harry, it was pleasure and torture all at once, Draco couldn’t help but wonder if all teenage boys were turned on by the mere smell of their partner. Draco took one more breath and then propped himself up against his headboard pulling his knees up, he shook his head to clear it and settled Lyra on his lap. He unfurled the parchment just in time to see a message from Harry appear;
‘Shit!’ cursed Draco,  kicking out at the wall in front of him, ‘Harry are you ok?’, ‘Yeah I’m fine, I think Pansy is a bit shook up though,’ at this Draco looked wildly around him taking in the anxious faces of everyone apart from his boyfriend and best friend, ‘what now?’ he asked no one in particular, ‘we can’t get through to you both.
Draco’s eyebrows rose towards his hairline, his eyes grew wide as he suppressed a small smile but not before harry had seen  the slightest twitch in the corner of Draco’s mouth.
‘Ah Mr Malfoy!’ The hat said as it was placed on his head. ‘Now this should be easy , but wait, what’s this? A conflict? You are destined for great things my boy, great, great things. Your head, well your head knows Slytherin, it is all it knows, but what of your heart boy mmm? What does your heart want?
Ron looked at Harry at caught his reflection is his best friend’s round spectacles, of course, Hermione’s charm, he was now sporting pink hair with big green spots, Merlin knew how long that would be that way. Ron felt his cheeks heating up as he turned back towards Hermione who flashed him a small smile, he guessed that was a good sign. Ron looked around the circle and caught the silver eyes of a smirking Draco Malfoy, ‘Git,’ muttered Ron under his breath.
Draco sat back more comfortably on the sofa, still leaving his hand joined with Harry’s. Harry looked down at their joined hands; ‘Don’t you mind?’
‘Yes, I didn’t understand, I mean I still don’t but I can see he means a lot to you, and you him I guess.’
Harry stared, bleary eyed at the parchment that had just dragged him from his dreams. He reached blindly under his pillow with one hand, whilst squinting at the new words forming before him.
Harry reached up to grab the parchment from Ron, the two scuffled for a minute with Ron claiming victory, Harry ran across to his bedside table and dragged his own version of the parchment out so he could join in the conversation and defend himself;
‘Harry,’ he said in a hushed voice, once again hanging his head, he removed his hand from Harry’s, pulled his knees to his chest and wrapped his arms around them. Harry watched him wondering what he had said wrong.
It was just past midnight and Harry was sat curled beneath Draco’s arm leaning  in to his side. They were leaning against, what they had come to see as ‘their’ wall in the Trophy Room.
‘Honestly,’ Neville replied, drawing Harry out from his memories, ‘Yes, it does, especially the first couple of times, but you get past that and then Harry, Merlin Harry is it worth it.’ Harry blushed profusely at the thought of it and turned to face Neville, tucking his arm beneath his head. Neville noticed him moving and turned too, mimicking Harry’s posture. ‘Are you sure you don’t mind talking about it?’ Harry asked, not wanting to press his friend too much, however, he was unable to keep the deep curiousity from his voice. Neville shook his head, ‘Not really, not with you anyway. I know why you’re asking, plus, you’re not going to make fun of me. Ask anything you want to.’ Harry smiled at his friend and thought about what he wanted to know, he came to a decision and asked, ‘How did you and Blaise know what to do when it came to it?’ Neville blushed again and closed his eyes before responding, ‘We didn’t, not really, that’s why it was so awkward, but I suppose, looking back, that was half the fun. It’s also something that no-one can take from us, it was something that we did together.’ Harry smiled again at the tenderness in Neville’s voice as he recounted the experience. It felt like a million tiny snitches had taken flight in his stomach, this could be him, him and Draco and he really couldn’t wait. ‘So Nev, what do you think I need to know?’ Neville contemplated for a moment before responding, ‘well first...’
Harry looked up in to his first friend’s blue eyes and smiled, ‘I know Ron but you don’t understand why he did it, his issue is with himself not me.’
‘Harry look, ‘ he whispered as he pointed towards the shimmering pool before them.  Harry frowned and took a step towards it keeping Draco close to his side. As they neared they noticed there was a trail of blood leading away from the puddle. It was eerie to see the silver shimmering on the dark forest floor. Harry felt his grip on Draco tighten.
Draco leant closer to Ron in a menacing way, foreheads almost touching, he felt the anger bubbling up inside him, ‘I care,’ he hissed at the Gryffindor, ‘Harry is my friend and when you hurt him you hurt me, you should bare that in mind in future Weasel, today was just the start of what I am willing to do for that boy so take that as a warning.’
Draco shuddered hearing the name of the Dark Lord spoken aloud like that, he shook his head, ‘I don’t know much Harry I’ll be honest, but I know that none of what you have just said is true’, Harry stared, wide-eyed, ‘But Mr Weasley…’ Draco placed his other hand in Harry’s ‘I know that man is like a father to you, and it is probably exactly what he has been told and believes, but believe me when I say I probably have more insight in to how the Dark Lord used to work, to his followers and who they were. Do you want to hear what I know?’ Harry nodded for Draco to continue,  Draco looked up and swallowed , he wasn’t sure whether he wanted to tell Harry but realised he could not hide what he knew from him , with a resigned sigh and a quick glance at his boyfriend he began;  ‘Admittedly , as I said, I don’t know much but, over the summer, when we heard of Black’s release , Father took to the drink again,’ Harry gave Draco’s hand a squeeze as he saw the blond grimace at the mention of his father drinking, the blond shot him a grateful smile and continued, ‘well when the drink took hold he started rambling , apparently Black is my cousin,’ Harry’s eyes grew wide but he nodded for Draco to continue, ‘Well as you can imagine Father’s not happy about that relationship, but the other thing is, well, as you know,  and much to my disgust, Father sees himself as The Dark Lord’s right hand man.’ Draco averted his gaze suddenly and inexplicably, for the first time in his life, embarrassed to be a Malfoy, Harry shuffled forward on his knees, wrapped his arms around Draco and pulled the boy in to an embrace, he buried his face in the white-blond hair he loved so much, ‘Draco, you are not your father, believe me when I say that, I know that’ he pulled away a little and cupped Draco’s cheek with his left hand keeping his right arm wrapped tightly around the other boy, he stroked Draco’s cheek bringing his hand down to take hold of the admittedly less pointy chin between his thumb and forefinger, he placed a sweet kiss on Draco’s lips, ‘You’re my Draco, I don’t blame you for his choices, past or future, you are your own person, you make your own choices and I trust you to make ones that are right for you,’ Draco nodded, blinking back tears that threatened to fall, he pulled Harry in to his lap wrapping his arms tightly around the boys torso,’ What did I do to deserve you?’ he asked in wonder, Harry chuckled, ‘something really bad I’ll bet,’ he replied, burying his head in the side of Draco’s neck as Draco took a swipe at the back of his head. ‘Go on Drake,’ Draco smiled at the nick-name and took Harry’s hand in his, ‘So,’ he began again, ‘ my father was furious at the lies that were being told, he ranted all night about Black not even being marked, saying he had never worked for the Dark Lord,’ Draco absently played with Harry’s fingers, twining them with his own and tracing lines up and down them, he swallowed, preparing himself for what he had to day next;  ‘apparently he was one of your parents best friends,’ Draco felt Harry tense in his arms, he paused waiting for a response  but, after a minute  he still didn’t speak so Draco continued, ‘ The only other thing I got was that whatever he got sent to Azkaban for he didn’t do it, a man named Pettigrew did it and framed him, he was innocent Harry and your parent’s friend, I find it hard to believe he would be out to kill you.’ Draco watched the top of Harry’s head as he waited for a response, silently holding the boy. In moments  Harry’s body  began trembling and Draco realised he was crying, he pulled the boy closer and they sat together like that until the room filled with the golden  light of the sun’s first rays.
Draco’s head snapped round as he watched the boy take the stage. Whispers had broken out all around him like hissing fires;
‘Not here,’ Harry hissed as he tried and failed to escape. The dwarf grabbed hold of Harry’s bag and, with a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two. The entire contents spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over the whole lot.
Harry did not understand why this was so hard, it was a simple question, albeit one that would make or break his Christmas and possibly even his heart, he swallowed again and dipped his eyes to stare at Draco’s chest, ‘Will you, I mean do you want to be my boyfriend?’ Harry almost whispered too, nervous to look up so missing the look of surprise and then pure happiness that crossed Draco’s features.
Draco had said nothing. He was stood watching the exchange  with interest, he stood slightly back from the group, arms folded across his chest, eyebrow raised. He had helped for Harry, there was no other reason, although, he admitted begrudgingly, he didn’t mind helping Hermione as much as he had imagined he would. As he watched the half-giant crumble in front of him and the two Gryffindor’s failing to comfort him he felt a tug deep down in the depths of his body. It made him feel uncomfortable that Hagrid’s pain bothered him, but he stayed quiet, preferring to keep that to himself lest he be seen as being weak. However he happened to look over at Harry who was struggling to comfort Hagrid, Draco could see the pain in Harry’s eyes  as he tried to make his larger than life friend see sense. That did it:
After Potions Draco was unceremoniously dragged in to an empty classroom by Blaise. The dark haired Slytherin had feigned interest in Draco’s wallowing therefore  lulling him in to a false sense of security, if he had had his wits about him Draco would have been slightly suspicious of his friend’s sudden concern, but as it was he was too busy feeling betrayed by Harry the he walked right in to the trap.
Harry had snapped his head round as Ginny had slapped his forearm to get his attention. ‘I can’t believe you just did that,’ she berated. He stared blankly at her ‘are you for real?’ she almost hissed. I can’t believe that you just did that’ she repeated shaking her head incredulously. ‘What?’ Harry asked, Ginny gave a most undignified snort. ‘What? What he says, are you actually for real? The man of your dreams Harry, he was right there in front of you, looking like a sex god, he came over here to talk to you, to speak to YOU and what do you do? You stare dumbly at him and then say goodbye. That was your chance Harry, most probably your last chance.’
‘Draco?’ Pansy’s voice was barely a whisper, breaking the excited tension within the room ‘that noise, on the way here, do you think? It couldn’t have been, could it?’
‘Nah, comfy, join me? ‘ Draco asked with a raised eyebrow. Harry shrugged and sat down by his side, he mirrored Draco’s position pulling his knees up to his chin so their elbows touched.
Neville was well used to Draco’s abrasive manner by now and merely chuckled at Draco’s impatience which caused the Slytherin in question to huff and fold his arms across his chest in a very un-Malfoy like manner.
Harry suddenly blushed a deep crimson and Draco raise an inquisitive eyebrow. Harry coughed a little and suddenly found is cuticles extremely interesting, ‘Well, there is something else, I wasn’t entirely sure at the time but the bloody witch insisted, then I figured that I didn’t have to tell you, but, here..’ at this Harry lifted the lion cub to Draco’s face, ‘sniff’ he said quietly. Draco once again raised an eyebrow but did as he was told, his eyes widened as he realised what he could smell, ‘Harry’ he said quietly, ‘This smells so like you if I close my eyes I would swear it was you.’ Harry shrugged, ‘Another spell, sorry she insisted.’ Harry said with another shrug. Draco looked over at the embarrassed Harry and smiled softly, he raised on to his knees and planted a soft kiss on Harry’s lips, ‘I absolutely love it , thanks, just... just don’t tell anyone I own it.’ Harry smirked at this, ‘Deal’ he said.  ‘Anyway where’s mine?’ he said holding out his hand. Draco smiled, still clinging to his Lion cub and handed Harry his gift.
Ron could not answer, the tickling had intensified as more of the spiders made their way up his trouser legs, Ron made a strangled noise and began to undo his trousers just as Draco whispered another charm, in one swift movement Ron pulled his trousers down and off and kicked them  away from him.
Draco’s hands trembled as he read the letter, his eyes were wide and his mouth suddenly dry, Harry Potter, Harry Potter was the gift giver, he, Draco Malfoy was the thing he would miss the most. It should have been him at the bottom of the lake for the second trial? He shuddered to think how his younger self would have reacted to that. Draco did not know what to do, he could only just think clearly.  After a few moments he took a deep breath and hoping this was not some sort of sick joke he slowly turned around.
powerful magic took hold of him. Draco placed a supportive hand on his shoulder as he stared in awe at the red-headed Gryffindor.
‘Boyfriend,’ Ron spluttered for what had to be the tenth time as he and Hermione made their way back to the Gryffindor common room, ‘Boyfriend?’
Draco turned his head and glared at her, he pushed himself up in to a sitting position and swung his legs off the bed, ‘I am a Malfoy, I am not adorable,’ he pouted.
Whatever reaction Harry was expecting was not the blank stare that he received from his boyfriend. ‘Are you sure?’ Draco asked incredulously.  Harry nodded once, looking confusedly at the blond, wondering about his strange reaction, ‘I’m as sure as I can be, I heard Mr and Mrs Weasley arguing about telling me, Mr Weasley wanted me to know. To be aware of the danger I’m in. Apparently Black was even talking about me in Azkaban, he knows I’m here, he’s going to come here and kill me if he has his way.’ Draco shook his head, ‘No he can’t be,’ Harry was sure that Draco said this more to himself than anything,
Harry shifted nervously and glanced over to where Neville  and Zabini were huddled whispering just to the side of them, he was sure that Neville would tell Zabini everything so there was no point trying to hide anything;
Harry looked up from where he was lay on his bed at the greeting and was met with the smiling face of his new boyfriend.
if you follow,’ she said with a raised eyebrow. Ron promptly choked on his  food and all the boys within ear shot were a brilliant shade of red.
Harry needed to have this conversation. It had been playing on his mind for so long, he just couldn’t bring himself to do it. Now there were no more excuses , this was a perfect opportunity, Ron, Seamus and Dean were all in the common room embroiled in a vicious Exploding Snap tournament, they’d likely be gone for hours.
The two boys had spent a leisurely half an hour whispering to each other and revelling in their new found relationship when they heard muffled talking from the next bed. On hearing this Draco sat bolt upright in bed and shouted across; ‘Morning, Merry Christmas, can we open presents now?’ Harry laughed as a pillow was launched across the room and hit Draco squarely in the face. ‘Hey’ Draco said indignantly huffing and hurling the pillow back,’ come on its Christmas I want to open my presents, I want to know what I got.’
The journey had continued much the same, Draco had begun to get restless and had no idea how he could get answers, no one dared to speak to him and had growled  viciously when the witch with the sweets had dared to slide open their door and ask did they want anything. The surprise was evident on her face when two of her best customers turned her down with a small shake of the head. Blaise had had enough, he knew Draco needed answers, perhaps he could go and bully a first year in to telling him what had happened, what he did know is that he needed to move, the atmosphere was killing, without looking back he stood and left the compartment and strode with purpose down the train. After a minute or two Blaise was brought to an abrupt halt as he was met with the rather unusual sight of a Gryffindor crawling around on all fours in front of him, currently the boy was facing away from him and Blaise walked silently up behind the shorter boy so that they were almost toe-to-toe. The boy on the floor began to turn and stopped suddenly when he caught sight of the pair of legs that were blocking his way. Slowly the boy raised his head and gave a small squeak of fear as the tall-dark Slytherin came in to view. Blaise smirked and raised an eyebrow, arms folded across his chest, ‘Longbottom?’ he asked. Neville squeaked again and mumbled something, face redder than any Weasley’s hair,
Harry smirked, ‘I know you want to give the ball back but i also know that you can’t just give it back to me,’ Harry said with a knowing look at the crowd of spectators below them.  Draco was lost for words.
Draco snorted, the Firewhiskey he had consumed rendering him unable to care about how undignified it sounded, Draco leaned forward until he was a hair’s breadth away from Harry, putting his face mere millimetres away from Harry’s, ‘I’m gay Potter,’ he breathed in to Harry’s face, ‘so…’ he pulled away again, ‘What would the future Mrs Potter think of you secreting yourself away with me?’
Draco was excited as he made his way over to the pitch for his first ever Quidditch practice as part of the house team, to look at him  you would never guess how excited he actually was, his features were schooled in to indifference, however a smirk had been allowed to play on his lips. He looked up as he heard his captain grumble;
Harry blinked confusedly wondering why on earth Draco had stopped that to show him his drawings at that very moment, ‘Erm, yeah ok.’
Draco sighed and tugged on the smaller boy’s arms so that he could pull him in to his lap, once there he wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, ‘Just wait until I see Blaise’ he muttered under his breath, before turning to Harry with a stern look in his eye, ‘OK spill.’
‘Yeah look at the fire in its eyes, you know it looks like it could defeat a dark lord once or twice you know.’
The forest was dark, the shadows had their own shadows, it was eerie, Harry had never realised there were so many different shades of black.  Darkness, as a rule didn’t bother him, he regarded it is an old friend , he found comfort and security in it. Darkness was safety. He guessed that eleven years locked in a cupboard would do that to a person.  As he watched Draco he realised he did not look comfortable at all, he was being very Draco about it and trying valiantly to hide his discomfort, but Harry knew that face, almost as well as he knew his own, he noticed every miniscule movement Draco made, he knew Draco was uncomfortable. Harry tentatively reached out and brushed Draco’s fingertips with his own. Harry heard a sharp intake of breath but Draco did not move his hand away so Harry reached around and laced his fingers through Draco’s. It felt nice to be holding hands like this, Harry thought he would be quite happy if they never let go. He gave Draco’s hand what he hoped was a reassuring squeeze and smiled when it was returned.
‘Not really just the same old not wanting me to come back to school, he is trying to save my life apparently.’ Harry shrugged like it didn’t matter and turned the page of the potions book that was resting on his lap. They had supposed to have been studying but the idea of that had vanished once the boys had started to talk about Dobby. Harry had long since accepted that it was Dobby so spoke with indifference, he was more than a little amused at Draco’s shock. ‘He won’t tell me why he is doing it, just that it’s for own good basically, I mean what can be worse than Dobby trying to save my life though? Oh and before I forget, when they bought Colin in to the Hospital Wing Dumbledore confirmed it, he confirmed that The Chamber of Secrets is open.’
Finally, Draco found him and what he saw made his breath leave his body as though it was him who had been hit in the stomach with a bludger. Harry was frozen in the sky, his haunted star fixed, unmoving, on the pitch below, then Harry was falling, it was like slow motion at first, Draco couldn’t believe what he was seeing, his heart stopped. Harry was falling, falling from fifty feet up, falling through the air like a dead weight. Screams echoed around him, drowning out his own as Harry tumbled through the sky in front of him and there was absolutely nothing he could do.
Harry sat perched on one end of Ron’s bed filling him in on what had happened at Hagrid’s, Ron had sat leaning against the headboard, listening open mouthed as though in a daze, it was only the mention of Hagrid’s cryptic message and his worst fear that had snapped him out of his daze.
A week later, Harry and Hermione were walking across the Entrance Hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice board, reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up.
If it was possible Neville’s blush deepened, he realised with embarrassment that he was still on his knees in front of Blaise Zabini. He had seen him around Hogwarts and before that he had seen him at the occasional gathering, but he had never spoken to him before today.
Draco had never felt anything like it in his life,  he felt a chill right down to his very bones, he knew  that he had had dark moments, times when he had wished himself away, anywhere but where he was  and during the darkest hours, even dead,  but right at that moment, as the air turned cold around him,  he truly believed, like he had never before, that he would never be happy again.
Draco lifted one blond eyebrow in further question, he was completely confused as to what Harry was getting at.
Blaise cleared his throat as he looked over at Harry and Draco, ‘So I think, if Nev doesn’t mind, I’d like to exchange our gifts in private.’ A slight blush crossed Neville’s cheek as Draco nodded in agreement, ‘Ok well I’d be quite happy to go and sit on the bed with Harry to exchange our gifts.’
‘Have you ever, you know? I mean I know we were busy with the war and stuff, so did you ever get time to, you know, let off steam, go all the way?’
Harry looked at the blonde boy in front of him, he could almost feel the pain and hurt radiating off him, he sighed, ‘I don’t know, I don’t know what love is really, I’m still a kid how am I supposed to know?’
‘I know’ he replied ‘you should have seen Dumbledore he was so angry. Any way what happened? Are you ok? How are you feeling?’
Hermione was busy apologising to Neville and he was busy reassuring her, Blaise poked him in the arm, ‘Your turn Nev.’
It was not a fun summer, not at all, fun did not even come close. Harry was miserable, he had been cooped up and locked up most of the summer and Hedwig had received the same treatment, she was not happy with him and often protested loudly which only served to get him in to more trouble. The other downside was that due to Hedwig been locked away the moment he had stepped back through the door at number 4 Privet Drive he had been unable to owl his friends. His school things had been locked away in his old cupboard, he had been unable to do any of his required reading of homework. Harry could only imagine the look on the faces of Draco and Hermione when they realise he had done nothing all summer, but he didn’t want to think of Draco and Hermione, it hurt when he did leaving a hollow feeling deep inside his chest. It was half way through summer and he had not heard a word from either of them or come to think of it from anyone, it had hurt more and more with each passing day as he felt even more neglected but today, well today he had held a little hope, but still nothing, today was his 12
Harry had very little knowledge of any form of sex, but he did know the basic mechanics of it, and, it looked bloody painful.  One evening, after a particularly heated making out session with Draco, Harry had given in and asked Hermione for help. Hermione, obviously being Hermione had answered the only way she knew how, she would research and find as much information as she could for him. A few days later Harry had gone in his back looking for his spare quill and found that she had slipped a book and some pamphlets in between his History of Magic and Potions text books. He had been extremely grateful that he had spotted them before pulling the books out in class. He had spent that evening looking at them all in great detail, more than once. The diagrams weren’t all that clear, even when Harry had squinted and turned his head slightly to one side.
Harry tried to escape. The dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by kicking people’s shins, and reached him before he’d gone two paces.
‘What do we tell them?’ Harry whispered as he caught up with Draco. Draco thought for a moment, ‘It was a trick, I didn’t show, I was trying to get you in to trouble.’
The war had changed him, those emerald green eyes were haunted, if the eyes were indeed the window to the soul, this was a tortured one. There was a darkness that Draco had never noticed before and an edge to everything he did and said. Draco was intrigued and, in between surreptitious glances and half-formed smiles Draco found himself falling in love, and hadn’t that been a shock to the system; ‘My only love sprung from my only hate.’ Draco guessed that Shakespeare fella (of course he was a wizard) had really known what he was talking about.
‘Now watch,’ Harry slowly walked around the room. Draco was open mouthed, as he watched, the pendant slowly turned to point in Harry’s direction and then proceeded to follow him around the room.
Harry placed the parchment down and went to retrieve the map from its hiding place at the bottom of his school trunk. Once he had it, he sat back on his bed, once again pulling the curtains tightly closed around him.
Harry had remained quite comfily in his position on Draco’s lap as he explained the story of the diary.
Ron successfully stifled a snort at the thought of throwing himself in front of even a Pygmy Puff for Draco Malfoy as the conversation around him continued.
Suddenly Harry stood up straight from where he had been organising his trunk, ‘guys, it’s missing, Riddle’s diary is missing.’
Harry paused not knowing what to say in reply, he wasn’t sure how much longer he wanted this to go on, and as he thought Draco sent another message.
Harry turned his head so his chin was resting on Draco’s chest, he looked up through his fringe at his boyfriend, ‘Kinda already have, I didn’t know what to pick so I just picked the same as Ron.’
Draco felt something was wrong, he just couldn’t out his finger on it, his stomach felt unsettled and a chill ran over his body, the pitch was eerily silent despite the wind and rain that was whipping around his head. He felt the cold all at once, a new kind of bone deep cold that no cloak could protect him from. Draco desperately searched the skies for Harry knowing instinctively that something was not right with him.
‘Come here,’ he said, opening his arms to Draco. Draco thought for a second, then lay down in Harry’s arms, his head on the small boys chest.  Harry never wanted to let go and Draco never wanted to leave the safety he felt with the Gryffindor’s arms around him. Eventually they drifted off in to a companionable sleep.
Draco found the parcel with ease this time, barely hidden amongst the grass at the bottom of the tree, he removed the parchment that wished him happy birthday and opened the box eagerly. Draco’s eyes grew wide as they fell upon the contents of the box, unbelieving of what he was seeing. The box contained a very expensive drawing set filled with pencils and charcoals and wax crayons of all different colours and shades, Draco tenderly drew his finger across them looking at them in awe. The set was beautiful, he had never owned anything like this before he was already picturing the things that he could draw, the shading and lines he could achieve. How did the gift giver know? He located and unfolded the parchment:
‘Draco I’m fine,’ Harry reassured him. Draco looked in to Harry’s eyes  and before he could stop himself he wrapped his arms around the Gryffindor and said;
‘Never mind, just listen I’m sorry ok, If you and Malfoy are friends I can deal with that as long as I don’t have to make nice with him.’
The early morning sun broke through the clouds and shone through the tall windows, illuminating the sleeping figures on the cold stone floor of the Trophy Room. Draco opened sleep blurred eyes and groaned as he tried to move his stiff body, he brought his left hand to his eyes and rubbed at them tiredly with the heel. With a sudden start Draco realised that he could not move his right hand, in fact he could not really feel his left arm at all, slowly and purposely he turned his head and looked down at the right side of his body, what he saw there made a small smile creep on to his face and a warm feeling settle in the pit of his stomach. Curled up and pressed against Draco’s side was Harry Potter, Draco could not feel his arm as it was wrapped around Harry’s waist and pinned tightly between Harry and the stone wall behind them.  Draco quite happily left his arm there and stared down at the raven-haired Gryffindor in his arms, he watched Harry’s shoulders move up and down with each breath he took and felt content to stay where he was. Draco had no idea how long he watched Harry sleep when a small sound from across the room made him jump slightly, he checked to make sure he had not disturbed Harry who was still sleeping obliviously and turned his head in the direction on the sound.  Draco could not help but grin at the sight that met him, he admitted to himself it surprised him a little but not as much as it would have done if he had not reached certain conclusions the previous night. About six feet to his left Blaise Zabini was fast asleep curled up on his side mouth hanging slightly open which accounted for the occasional whimpering noise that Draco could hear, what had made Draco smile so much was the sight of Blaise’s left arm wrapped tightly around the small Gryffindor  boy was back was pressed firmly against his chest, long, dark, elegant fingers laced with shorter pale ones, Draco’s eyes rose to Neville’s face and he noticed the small smile on the boys face who looked quite content as he slept , he had not had much time for Longbottom before now, thinking of him as just the Gryffindor idiot but things had changed , now he was willing to get to know the boy who Blaise seemed so taken with, ‘Zabini’s Gryffindor’ he dubbed him with a small smile, at this thought he looked back at Blaise and was met with wide open dark brown eyes that stared at him as though in challenge. Draco knew that Blaise was expecting torment and some sort of derogatory comment and was stealing himself for it ready with rebuttal  or even denial.
‘Do you think that’s a good idea?’ came the bored voice of Pansy as she and the others pointed their own wands at the red-head.
Every insecurity that Draco had felt in his short life came crashing over him like a tidal wave, Harry had stood him up, that much was obvious, Harry didn’t want him anymore, he didn’t want their friendship.
Neville continued, ‘They used them to communicate when they were on Auror missions and even more so when my mum stayed home pregnant with me so she knew dad was ok.’
As Harry left the dormitory to go and meet Draco he failed to notice that the snores that had once come from Neville’s bed had stopped a long time ago.
The dwarf finished his song and climbed off Harry whose stuff was still spread all over the floor. Without thinking Draco bent to help him pick something up. Draco looked at what he was holding in his hand it was a diary of some sort, he didn’t know Harry kept a diary, he was a little offended he didn’t know about it and wondered if he featured in it anywhere.
Harry ignored her. He mounted his broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared – in a fierce rush of joy he realised he’s found something he could do without being taught – this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher and heard screams and gasps from the girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.
Dobby returned with the drinks and set them on a small table without a word, he bowed so low that his long nose touched the floor beneath him and then he was gone. Draco had never seen the elf leave so quickly, it was almost like he had somewhere important to be , which was ridiculous, he was an elf.
‘Draco I told you that in confidence you snake,’ Blaise practically hissed at his best friend. Draco smirked and examined his finger nails, ‘That’s the game Blaise, you don’t have to answer.’
‘ssh it’s okay,’ he soothed, ‘It wasn’t that, it was, well , it was, no one has ever cared that much.’ A large tear rolled down Draco’s cheek and Harry reached over and wiped it away with his thumb.
Draco watched as the Gryffindor’s called a time out . ‘About time,’ Draco mumbled to himself, surely they thought more of their Seeker. He watched as Harry seemed to be arguing furiously  with the clones, Harry seemed to have the last word as he flew back in to the air with a look of determination on his face. The clones flew back in to the air but did not follow Harry, Why weren’t they protecting Harry? Did they want him to die? He was going to kill them both, slowly and painfully, the bludger was trying to kill Harry, were they idiots. Draco was furious and immediately flew to Harry just as he dodged the bludger once more, ‘Training for the ballet Potter?’ Draco yelled as he got closer, Harry stopped and looked at him as Draco drew up alongside him, ‘Harry what the hell is going on?’
Draco stood and watched Harry’s initial failed attempt, the words ‘open up,’ slicing the air in clear English,  he took a step closer as Harry tried once more, urging the smaller boy on silently. Suddenly, like the day in duelling club, the room was full of the sibilant sounds of Parseltounge, Draco fought the need to close his eyes as he let the sounds wash over him, they felt like warm caresses wrapping around him gently almost lovingly,but, before he could lose himself, the sounds stopped, before his eyes the tap glowed with a brilliant bright light and began to spin, Draco watched as the sink groaned and then  began to move, he followed its movement as it disappeared out of sight leaving a huge exposed pipe in its wake. He knew it was coming before he heard the words, ‘I’m going down there.’ Draco closed his eyes in defeat, he knew there was no point fighting Harry over this, there was too much at stake, before he could utter a word he heard the determined words of Ron, ‘Me too.’ He hadn’t expected any less, it was Weasley’s sister after all. He turned around to look at his friends, each set of eyes showed fear but determination, Blaise gave a sharp nod, Pansy swallowed hard but copied the motion, Neville, still holding Lockheart looked at Blaise for reassurance, ‘You can stay Nev, no one will judge.’ Neville felt every pair of eyes turn to him, he closed his eyes for a moment, when he opened them again they were full of determination, ‘I’m coming.’ He said with an affirmative nod.
Harry had been found by Hagrid and then delivered safely in to the arms of Mr and Mrs Weasley who had fixed his glasses and cleaned his robes respectively. He had had an eventful experience in Gringott’s  and was apparently now on his way to meet a famous wizard called Gilderoy Lockheart. Mrs Weasley,  Ginny and Hermione were giggling and whispering and gushing about the wizard, Ron and the other male Weasley’s were grumbling and rolling their eyes, Harry was just intrigued.
The two boys walked in silent companionship deeper in to the forest. They had walked, as they were, hand in hand for about an hour, the forest had fast begun to close in around them, the trees seemed to reach out to touch them as the shadows crept ever closer. Harry tightened his grip on Draco’s hand and pulled him closer so that their arms touched from finger tip to shoulder, he was getting a little unnerved himself so could not begin to imagine what Draco was feeling. He wanted the blonde boy to know that he was not alone, that Harry was there and always would be. Harry knew about Draco and the dark, he knew Draco’s father used the dark to his advantage, often using the cover of darkness to reign down terror on his unsuspecting son, he knew what the dark meant to Draco. He wanted to protect him so much, he never wanted to leave Draco in the dark again.
For God’s sake what the hell, is there no escape, stupid git, what’s so special about Harry Potter, ‘argh’ Draco hadn’t realised that he had said that last part out loud, Goyle looked carefully at his friend.
‘Well,’ she said, completely disregarding the menacing glares she was receiving, ‘Imagine this if you will. I woke up early this morning to an absolute travesty, it was bordering on disaster, I went to do my hair when I remembered that I had ran out of my very expensive Italian hair styling product and I had totally forgotten to replace it , so I thought, who do I know? Who do I know  who has more hair products than the entir8e second-year girls dorm combined?’ at this she raised hey eyebrow and first glanced at Blaise then Draco staring purposely at them both in turn. ‘So, in my hour of dire need I ran, gracefully I might add, to my knights in shining armour and to my absolute horror I find both of them missing and beds not slept in , whatever is a girl supposed to do? So I woke Greg, ‘ she stole a glance at a very grumpy Goyle,’I don’t think he appreciated it very much and he informed me that you two left together in the middle of the night and. Never. Came. Back.’  Pansy began twirling her hair around her finger in an attempt to look innocent that fooled no-one, ‘so’ she continued, ‘obviously I was traumatised, so I took some  hair product anyway, you know, to just clam my nerves.’
They had spent a lovely evening trading stories and jokes, with the occasional game of Wizard’s chess and exploding snap and were curled on their respective couches in front of a roaring fire when the first yawn was heard signalling it was time for bed.  Draco stood and stretched his arms high above his head, ‘right well I’m ready to turn in.’
Harry spun on his heels at the sound of the drawling tone. It was a voice he hadn’t heard all year, and admittedly, begrudgingly to himself, missed the sound of. He stopped in the corridor waiting for Malfoy to catch up with him, he was aware of hundreds of eyes on them, watching, waiting for something to happen between the pair, a fight or an argument perhaps, but things had been different since the beginning of term, there was too much water under the bridge between them, they had been through too much, seen too much suffering; gone was the old animosity. They had saved each other from certain destruction and Harry had kept Malfoy out of Azkaban. Even so,  before now any interaction they had had was a nod of acknowledgement perhaps even the flicker of a smile as they passed one another in the hallways. Harry was unsure of Malfoy’s intentions and tensed, hand flickering towards his wand, but he held steady as the Slytherin closed the distance between them.
Blaise nodded and stood, ‘Me too, come on Nev.’ He reached down and pulled the yawning boy from the couch by his hand, he tucked Neville under his arm and led him to the bed they were sharing, he helped him in then followed suit, curling his long body around the smaller one in front of him, leaving Draco looking down at the almost sleeping boy on the couch.
‘Then hearing you, hearing you cry my name, supporting me, throwing me a wand, I knew then I loved you, I wanted to be with you, needed to be with you, if you will have me of course?’ Harry looked up in to the silver eyes questioningly.
‘I’m ok really,’ said Draco sitting up, ‘ I felt faint and a little unwell, nothing serious no need to fuss.’ Pansy and Blaise shared a look but did not say anything.
Harry felt Draco stiffen behind him, he too had realised who the centaur was alluding to. He placed a hand over the two that were wrapped around his waist and Draco laced his fingers in to Harry’s . Harry could hardly believe what he was about to say;
Harry suppressed another sigh, ‘ I know and I am grateful, to both of you, I know you are doing this for me and I love you for it.’ Draco’s head snapped around at Harry’s choice of words, not entirely sure he had heard them right, Draco played the words over again in his head, he knew, deep down, that Harry didn’t mean it in any other way than friendship, but still it had been surprisingly nice to hear. Draco wrapped an arm around Harry’s shoulders and pulled him close, wondering what it would take to hear those words again.
Draco looked around the room and was faced with several pairs of eyes looking at him questioningly, apparently he was in charge; ‘Right ok.’ He said, taking a deep breath; ‘let’s go get her back.’
Draco watched as Harry was evidently thinking things through in his mind. He’d had to tell him but now, now he’d lost him, he knew he had, his father had ruined the best, and probably the most real friendship that he had ever had. He couldn’t take it anymore.
Harry sighed and ran his hand down his face, rolling his eyes as he did so. He did love that boy, but he was such a drama queen, ‘You're right it was me. Where did he go?’
‘He’s awake,’ he yelled over his shoulder at the people behind him earning him a glare from Madam Pomfrey.
Draco caught himself glaring at the clones again. He was frustrated, angry and even a little upset quite frankly he would be happy to hex both their grinning ginger faces off their shoulders but somehow he didn’t think that would go down very well with Harry. Since the attack on Nearly Headless Nick and Justin real panic had spread through the corridors of Hogwarts and Harry was miserable, people were now completely sure that Harry was the culprit after apparently publicly threatening Justin they believed it highly suspicious that he was the next victim. He hated seeing him this way, hanging his head in desolate disbelief at what the world around him had become and Draco especially hated being unable to do anything to help, even going over to offer a comforting word or touch were way beyond his current capabilities. Which was currently the reason he was throwing death glares in the direction of Fred and George Weasley, each with an increasing amount of venom, he would never admit it but he was jealous, their easy jokes and laughter were obviously cheering Harry up, they were doing what he should be doing and whats more, they were allowed, they could comfort and joke with Harry in the Great Hall, openly showing Harry and everybody else their support for the boy  in full view of everyone and no one would bat an eye lid. He knew it was impossible, comforting Harry in public, but it didn’t hurt any less. Each time something like this happened he felt his resolve weakening more and more, how long before Harry gave up on the friend who could not be a friend in public? How long before he would seek the comfort elsewhere that Draco couldn’t give? Draco closed his eyes and tried not to think of what would happen then.
‘Draco, are you not opening  your mail this morning dear?’ Pansy asked in a quiet voice while she placed a manicured finger on a piece of folded parchment  from his pile and pushed it slowly across the table to him. Draco immediately recognised the untidy scrawl and flashed Pansy a grateful smile, he unfolded the parchment which simply read:
Harry shrugged beneath Draco’s arm, ‘Well that menas nothing, isn’t it obvious, if anyone was going to see it for the first time it would be me.’
He reached the seventh-floor corridor and paced back and to in front of the vast expanse of wall before him. The door unfurled itself from the brickwork before him and Harry took a deep breath before reaching out and turning the handle.
Draco slowly shook his head from side to side, ‘No, all house elf names are unique until the elf dies, that was definitely my elf, and from what you were saying about the elf’s family it sounds about right,’ Draco said sullenly.
It had been Harry’s best Christmas ever. He and Draco sat there until their eyes grew heavy, Draco swept the chess set on to the floor and leaned back on to his bed lacing his fingers behind his head stretching his legs out as he did so. Harry followed his lead placing his head next to Draco’s feet.
Draco’s fists clenched involuntarily crumpling the parchment he was holding, he was still working on his revenge plot for Weasley but now it was clear that he would need to step it up a notch.
At this Draco freed his arms, ‘Oh I’m mad, believe me I’m mad, but, for now I will leave it, it’s our last night for weeks, but just know I am mad.’Harry snaked his arms back around Draco’s waist and looked up in to silver eyes, ‘Don’t be mad, I’m ok, no harm done.’
‘Honestly, really don’t worry. But I do really, really need to speak to you, I have soooo much to tell you and something to show you.’
Draco swallowed again, ‘Who is it you love?’ He shut his eyes as though that could prevent the answer hurting him.
‘Yes Harry Tuesdays , Tuesday nights in here as well as Fridays. I thought, you know,  seen as classes start later on a Wednesday morning then it would be ok.’ Said Draco shrugging.
Others were not so nice. Names were called, insults were thrown, Draco silently worked through them, after all he was used to them. Harry received endless questions, what was he doing? Was he ill? Had Draco cursed him? However, they all stopped when a Ravenclaw named Eddie Thomas loudly asked Harry what the hell did he think he was doing with the ‘slimy, Slytherin, murdering, Death Eater scum.’ That was too far, Draco had tensed at the side of Harry and Harry caught him glance quickly at his scarred arm. Harry stood up slowly and calmly turned to face the Ravenclaw.
Draco slumped bodily against the door, he felt worn and destroyed. He desperately needed to speak to his godfather. He was about to turn and walk away when the door he was leaning on was pulled open, the shift made him stumble; falling at the feet of the man he sought. He looked up and met dark eyes that were burning with curiosity. He scrambled to his feet, ‘Sev, I … Can I come in?’
‘Last meal Potter?’ Malfoy snarled. Ron bristled beside Harry, but Harry knew the true meaning behind the snarl. Harry knew Draco was worried that he was being expelled. Harry wanted to try and reassure Draco without making it obvious to Ron and anybody else that may be listening. But how? Harry thought for a minute, he needed to get Draco alone to talk and reassure him.
There was no reply, Harry swallowed hard and reasoned Draco may have already left for The Great Hal and not taken the parchment with him, there was no way that he was going to think the worst he hurriedly dressed stuffing the parchment in his pocket as he went.
‘Come on,’ Harry said smiling down at Draco ‘we need to get ready.’ He climbed off the bed, ‘We have to meet Hermione and Ron soon.’ Luckily he was facing the other way and missed the disgusted look on Draco’s face at the mention of Ron.
Harry looked up at his tall Italian friend and shrugged his shoulders, ‘Dunno, c’mon you lot give me a hand.’
Draco was in a foul temper, not helped by the fact that he had not slept again with worrying about Harry. His usual bowl of cornflakes was growing soggy under his scornful gaze as he stabbed at it murderously with his spoon. Every few seconds his eyes gravitated towards the doors, never seeing what he needed to, or, more to the point, who he needed to. He was just about to look away again when the door swung open and in strode Ron Weasley with a stupid grin plastered across his face, Draco’s eyes immediately fell on the smaller boy who was following closely behind. Harry had a huge grin on his face, and Draco felt himself relax, it was obvious that Harry, although evidently tired, was in one piece. Draco watched as Harry’s eyes roved across the Slytherin table quite obviously searching for him. Draco managed to suppress a groan at Harry’s not so subtle search , whilst also noting a growing heat in the pit of his stomach at the small boys obvious need to see him. They locked eyes for a brief second, Harry’s eyes sparkled as his smile, if possible, grew even wider, Draco flashed him a quick smile back and then stared down at his cornflakes. Before Draco could look up again the sound of flapping wings signalled the arrival of the morning post, Draco had barely glanced at his own letters all his questions about Harry’s whereabouts the previous day and how he had got to school were answered as Mrs Weasley’s screeching toned filled The Great Hall. Draco’s eyes widened as he learned of their escapades, he really would have to talk to Harry about personal safety issues. Then the end of Mrs Weasley’s Howler caught his attention, ‘Ginny,’ what sort of name was that, bloody ridiculous if you asked him, Draco snorted causing him to receive a horrified look from Pansy who sitting by his side.
Before Harry could bring himself to respond a small red-headed girl stepped in front of him and glared up at Draco, ‘Leave him alone’ she demanded with as much force as she could muster.
‘Argh!’ Draco groaned before throwing himself face down on the bed, venting his frustrations in to the pillow whilst pummelling his fists on the bed either side of his head.
‘Erm..’ said Ron as he stole a quick glance at Hermione out of the corner of his eye. Hermione huffed and glared at Ron as she crossed her arms across her chest,
Draco felt his blood boiling as the two second year girls spoke about Hermione, he managed to control himself, he was a coward after all, he knew he could never bring himself to openly defend Harry let alone Hermione, even so their words stung and left a sour taste in his mouth. He looked across at the small girl and inwardly shuddered at the memory of how she had looked the previous evening. Her wounds were all healed now but he could still make out the dark circles under her eyes. He could see that she was ok but he still had no idea how Harry was. Draco was slowly going out of his mind, he had been taken from the third floor to the Hospital wing, then dismissed back to the dungeons all without so much as a  glimpse of Harry. Hermione had been unable to tell him whether the boy was alive or not and he was still none the wiser. Draco had taken some small comfort from the fact that Hermione had not looked distraught, just tired, but, still he needed to know, he needed to check that Harry was ok.  The only problem was how, normally he would pretend to taunt Hermione to find out the information that he needed but he really did not fancy being lynched by the entire Great Hall for goading a very sensitive Hermione.
Draco had had enough, he was sick of seeing the Irish idiot fawning all over Harry, they seemed to be everywhere he looked, it was sickening and to top it all off he just couldn’t stop thinking about Harry. The last thing he saw at night was those green eyes and the first thing he saw in the morning was that ridiculous half smile, and the dreams the dreams were something else entirely. Without a doubt Draco had fallen in love, at first he had hated himself, he was a cliché, the bad boy who had fallen in love with golden boy, it was laughable really, but now, now was just acceptance and the gut-wrenching feeling and emptiness that was seemingly part of unrequited love. He had to get over it, move on, get a grip and leave Harry be.
Pansy had overslept, she was inwardly furious with herself but no one would guess it as she stalked through the Corridors on the way to Transfiguration, cool mask in place, she really did not like being late, as a returning Slytherin she needed to be on her best behaviour, like Draco, her every move was being watched for the slightest of mistakes.
The room’s other occupants were all there much to his annoyance. Crabbe and Goyle were sat on the latter’s bed and didn’t even look up at his entrance as they were seemingly embroiled in an extremely intense trade-off of their Honeyduke’s wares. Draco shook his head fondly and glanced towards Blaise. His friend was lying on his stomach on his bed, writing furiously on, to what looked like, to the unknowing eye, a very old, scruffy looking piece of parchment with the dopiest looking smile Draco had ever seen plastered on his face, there was no need to ask what he was doing or even who it was he was talking to. Draco took a second to wonder if his face ever looked like that while he was talking to Harry before looking across at the room’s final occupant.
Ron risked a glance across the Great Hall towards the Slytherin table where Draco was seemingly in heated conversation with Blaise  and Pansy, he looked back towards Harry and Hermione finding them both watching him intently, he shrugged, ‘I guess he’s  not that bad.’
Draco heard someone come in and slump on the table opposite Hermione. From where he was sitting he could not see  who it was, he just hoped  they wouldn’t stay long so he could leave. He turned the next page of the book and his eyes opened in shock as he heard a very familiar voice, his eyes grew wider as he listened. Harry was there, Harry was talking, Harry was talking about him! Draco’s eyes widened even more as Harry continued. He has no idea  I am here , talking about  me like this, he has no idea that I feel exactly the bloody the same , I can’t let him know  I’m here it would embarrass him, thought Draco, but I also can’t hear him hurting like that. What the hell do I do?
Harry threw an arm on to the back of the sofa, joining the pale freckled one that was already there, he lazily ran his thumb across Ginny’s forearm, drawing imaginary lines between each freckle as he had done many times before.
Draco cast his mind back to the Friday before, Halloween, he remembered he had just arrived back in the dungeons after being escorted back because apparently there was a bloody great troll making itself at home somewhere in the castle. He had just slumped into and armchair and thrown both his legs over the arm when he overheard a conversation between two second year girls;
Hermione raised her head from where it was buried in Harry’s chest, with a cheeky smile she looked him right in the eyes and said, ‘Hi yourself,’ it took a moment but she watched as a look of recognition passed across Harry’s face and the tips of her ears began to turn pink, he raised his eyebrows in an unspoken question and Hermione gave one, almost imperceptible nod of the head. A huge grin spread across Harry’s face causing Ron to look from one to the other like they had both grown an extra set of limbs, he would never understand them he thought with a shake of his head.
Harry watched in amazement as the words slowly began to disappear as though they were being absorbed in to the paper, a million questions formed in his mind but, before he could speak new words began to worm in elegant cursive across the parchment;
All eyes turned to the ghost who was bobbing around gleefully behind their group, she was obviously pleased with all the attention she was getting, her face was split in to a wide grin and her eyes glinted mischeviously behind her round spectacles;  she swooped across the room and down in front of Neville, she peered at him closely through her glasses causing him to step back, ‘ I was showing them where I saw the eyes?’
‘It’s custom made, with a spell to replicate a person’s eyes, I wasn’t sure you would like it , but the witch in the shop insisted, kept on going on about how unique they are.’
‘It’s ok Parkinson,’ Neville said with a small smile,’  I was the same when I first discovered it, come and sit down, let’s talk and figure out what we are going to do.’
The party was coming to an end and Draco knew what he had to do, as the lights started coming on Draco made his way across to where Potter was sitting, he felt like he was walking for miles but then, in no time at all he was there, standing behind Potter, steeling himself to say something, anything. Of course Potter didn’t notice him, why would he, he stood for a moment debating what to do, then the Weaseltte caught his eye.
Harry raised his head and leant his cheek against Draco’s chest as he wrapped his arms around the boy’s waist.
Harry felt Draco’s hand still at the mention of Ron and squeezed the blonde’s knee in a show of understanding, ‘Well I know Ron is spending the night in the seventh year boys dorm with Percy and the twins, they are doing a family thing, opening their presents and fire calling their parents in Romania, so me and Nev have our dorm to ourselves, plus ‘Mione is spending Christmas Eve with Ginny in the first year dorms and has been invited to join the Weasleys for the morning, they did ask me but, well I think that they expected me to turn them down.’ Harry finished, closing his eyes to Draco’s touch.
‘Oh bollocks,’ thought Draco as he held it up. He looked at Harry, Harry looked back, ‘Give that here Malfoy,’ said Harry quietly. Draco winced at the use of his last name. Harry had called him that since the day on the train, it sounded formal he much preferred the boy to call him Draco he actually kind of enjoyed it.  Harry hated him now, but what was that, were his eyes playing tricks on him or did a look of sympathy just cross Harry’s face, one way to find out. The other student’s had gone quiet waiting for Draco to respond. A mischievous glint twinkled in Draco’s eye.
Nestled just under Draco’s right pectoral muscle was a large snake’s head, it was looking directly at Harry as though watching him with its piercing black eyes.  Its long body curled downward and around covering all the side of Draco’s ribs, the tail leading behind and then disappearing from sight as it dipped below the waist band of his school trousers; Harry longed to find out where it ended.
Draco stepped forward determined to stop her looking at Harry that way, ghost or no ghost Harry was HIS boyfriend; ‘ And where exactly was that?’
‘So anyway, now have agreed on that I will explain what I mean.” Harry took a deep breath and continued, “Imagine if you, the hottest guy in school,’ Draco blushed again, “were to, you know, flirt with someone's boyfriend right in front of them, that person would be angry right?” Draco nodded, “practically apoplectic,” he agreed. It was slowly dawning on him where exactly Harry was going with all this and he wasn’t a hundred percent sure how he felt about it. “It may also get me hexed to oblivion and back, “Draco said cautiously, “and I'm on thin ice as it is.”
Harry thought for a second, this was important and he trusted Neville and if he could get to talk to Draco then it would all be worth it, he nodded at Neville  then watched as the word Malfoy was written on the parchment, the reply came quickly;
‘Hi yourself’ said Draco in a way that reminded Harry of the first time that they had met at Madam Malkin’s. Harry chuckled and walked over to Draco;
Draco slumped back in his chair and lifted a hand to run it through his hair, ‘So that’s it really, what in Salazar’s name does the Irish twerp have that I don’t.’
Blaise rolled his eyes at the blond and plunged his hand in to his robed to retrieve his parchment hoping it would at least placate his friend, but, before Blaise could respond the train drew to a halt, Draco’s head snapped up at the sound of the screeching brakes, ‘I need to see him,’ he announced before standing up and stalking out of the compartment and off down the carriage, Blaise followed with a fond gleam in his eye.
‘Harry stop apologising, believe it or not I’m glad that you want to tell people. I will admit it is a little difficult for me at the moment but it won’t always be that way, if you and Blaise trust Longbottom then so do I, and if Ron decides to say something we will deal with that as it happens. Wait is that why he hit you? Because we are friends?’
Harry walked back to his common room in a daze. He had never been stood up by Draco before and he didn’t know what to do.  He felt a hot tear escape and roll down his cheek as he climbed through the portrait hole, he had obviously done something wrong but he couldn’t for the life of him figure out what. He rubbed furiously at his cheek and ran up the stairs to his room, he threw himself on his bed not caring whether or not he disturbed anybody, and he grabbed the parchment from under his pillow. Nothing, not one word, what the hell had he done?
‘I know Draco, believe me, I know, but I can’t live that way...’ Draco gasped at Harry’s proclamation, ‘Are you ending this? I’m sorry. I don’t know what to say, please don’t do this.’ Fat tears began to roll down Draco’s face, screw the Malfoy rules he was not going to pretend that this was not affecting him, he was destroyed, he would not throw up his defences, Harry was the only thing good in his life, he would not give up without a fight ‘What can I do, please Harry.’ Draco was almost sobbing by now, Harry reached up and wiped a tear from his flushed cheek. ‘Drake...’ at Harry saying his name that way Draco looked up in to those green eyes he knew so well, ‘Harry, really, deep down I knew you would not do that to me, I just , I just don’t think I’m worth not cheating on, especially when you could have anyone.’ Harry lifted his hand and cradled the side of Draco’s head, Draco leaned in to the touch, ‘Drake thanks for admitting that, I know that was hard for you, I’m not breaking up with you..’ Draco’s head lifted and he leant forward and captured Harry’s lips in a sweet kiss. ‘Why not?’ Draco all but whispered.
As the four boys watched the Phoenix fly their friends to safety each took comfort in knowing she was coming right back for them.
‘Hagrid, stop blubbering this instant, each one of us fully knew the risks of doing what we did last night. You didn’t want to give Norbet up, WE made that decision, WE crept around the castle after hours and WE forgot the cloak. It was down to OUR stupidity that we are here. This is not your fault so get a bloody grip.’
‘What, drop my wand?’ Harry muttered causing Draco to fight back a snort and a small smile to grace Harry’s lips.
Harry was shocked again, not only was Neville’s secret friend a Slytherin but a dorm mate and more than possibly a friend of Draco’s, he wondered who it could be.
Hermione took a furtive glance around the room, there were a couple of third years in the corner, their heads down in deep concentration, other than that they were alone.
