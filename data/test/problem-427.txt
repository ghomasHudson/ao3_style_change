The heat from the mirror increased and it began to tremble violently in Draco's grasp, until suddenly the sound of glass shattering filled the room, as the Mirror of Truth cracked under the strain and Valshar shed a single tear.
“What’s that, Ry?”  Oliver asked.
“I know, Lena, dear.  I still loved you as much as I always did too, but I just wish that my experiments on eternal youth would have worked.”
“Good job, everyone,” McGonagall said.  “The extra Patronusses certainly helped with the Dementors and made the battle outside a lot easier, so 50 points to Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.”
“Have you seen Tom?”  Zach asked.  “I can’t find him anywhere and I’m getting worried.”
“Well, let us not forget,” Nick said, “that according to the ‘Tome of the Founders’ my great-granduncle Tom is only sixteen.  Last time I checked Voldemort is much older than sixteen.”
Moments after Asheera finished her speech, the vibrant pink blossoms on the tree fell to the ground.  Seconds later the beginnings of fruit could be seen and within minutes, a single, large, golden peach hung from the tree.  The gathered priestesses were admiring it as if it was the greatest and most expensive jewel they had ever seen.
Sixteen-year-old Draco Malfoy emerged from his morning shower, and after drying his hair and wiping the excess water off of his skin, he wrapped the towel around his waist and went into his room to get dressed for the day. Having celebrated his sixteenth birthday only two days prior, Draco just couldn't help but think of his mixed feelings in terms of his next birthday. On one hand, he was happy that he was only a year away from his age of majority, which meant that he'd finally be able to do magic whenever he wanted without having to worry about the underage restrictions along with learning how to Apparate and the like. On the other hand, though, he also dreaded his seventeenth birthday because he knew that his father would very likely invite the last person in the world that Draco would want attending his birthday party.
Armando Dippet looked at the group from his portrait and asked, “Why wait?  Considering the war, shouldn’t the wards be as strong as possible?”
“Hello boys,” Rowena said.  “Who have you brought with you?”
“Interesting,” Parvati said.  “I hope the charm tells us who he all has pictures of.”
“Oh, of course, um, where are they?”  Zacharias asked.
Valen nodded and disappeared from the flames, but left the connection open so that Asheera could Floo directly to the hospital wing.
‘Hmm, I probably shouldn’t have told him anything.  He’d have my head on a platter if he knew I told anyone.  Oh well, its easily fixed.’
“Exactly!”  Colin exclaimed, as he shook his head.
One by one, the nine Death Eaters he called stepped forward and bowed before their master. Voldemort was not appeased by this act of fealty, however.
Thinking that his spell didn’t work, Andrew tried again, and was shocked when yet another bubble popped out of Colin’s mouth and the voice said, “Colin slept with a security blanket until he was 10.”
“Aarik, my darling boy, is that really you?” she asked in a soft voice.
Once Malfoy ran out of tears, he did thank me for comforting him and we spent the next hour chatting about various things.  I’m still a bit shocked to be honest that I actually had a civil conversation with him.  Of course, with the war and everything, I personally would not complain if I could put my rivalry with Malfoy to rest.  Thanks to Trelawny’s damn prophecy, I have enough to worry about as it is without having to worry what Malfoy will do to my friends and me next.
“Yes, Harry Potter, sir?”  Dobby asked.
"I'm family though," Ryan said. "Aren't you supposed to do as I ask?"
It was Saturday, the 26th of October.  The Halloween Ball was fast approaching and almost everyone in the fifth, sixth, and seventh years of Hogwarts were going to Hogsmeade today to buy their clothes for the dance.  Many of them had wanted to do it last weekend, but Death Eater attacks had delayed several shipments to the various shops in Hogsmeade.  This weekend wasn’t even supposed to be a Hogsmeade weekend, but because of the shipping delays and the upcoming dance, Professor Dumbledore decided to make it one, but only for the fifth year and above students.
“Well, you are his boyfriend,” Harry answered.
Chapter Thirteen
“Oh Harry what am I going to do with you?”
“Good morning, Professor,” Nick said with a smile.
“You don’t have to worry about that, Harry,” Hermione said with a smile.  “After you asked Rowena and me about a spell to learn how to dance, we put our heads together and we did come up with something that should prove useful.”
‘Could that stand for Rowena Fiona Ravenclaw?’  Ryan thought and almost immediately the three letters started to glow and soon the whole brick was glowing.  Ryan reached up and touched the glowing brick and looked on with wonder as a single glowing line extended upward from the glowing ‘F’.  Ryan soon realized that the glowing line was tracing the shape of a door and as soon as it finished, Ryan heard the sound of stone moving against stone as the wall swung open.
"September Tenth," Nicolas replied.
Ryan and Nicolas simply nodded to Harry again before the three of them started talking about various topics. Harry and Nicolas learned more about Ryan's time in Asheville, his late grandmother Lucinda, and the fact that he too was gay. Ryan and Harry learned more about Nicolas' time at Beauxbatons, his grandmother Angelique, and the fact that he was bisexual. Harry also filled them in on some of his various adventures over the years, such as the ordeal with Voldemort and Professor Quirrell, the Chamber of Secrets and the basilisk, and the rebirth of Voldemort and the Priori Incantatem effect.
"Gee thanks, Ron," Harry said.
“Same here, Matt,” Ryan said.
“Together?”  Angelique said, as she sat down.  “Hmm, okay.  I knew you were bisexual, Nicolas, and I certainly have no problem with that.  Your father is gay after all.  How did this come about though?  I mean you’re a student, how did you start dating your Potions professor?”
“I’m Harry James Potter, ma’am.”
Turning to Professor Snape, Adrian said, “I’m the Captain.”
“That was not meant as a compliment, merely an observation of fact.”
“No, I don’t, at least not for the moment.  My sister and his father have requested that I not tell him for the moment.  They said they will decide when the time is right to tell him and that until then I’m not to tell him.”
The woman in the mirror nodded before asking, “Anything else?”
*	*	*
“Well, I guess not,” said Ryan as he looked at his two housemates.  “Though I’m sure you probably will be the only boys at the Ball wearing pink dress robes.”
had been wrong.  Hogwarts was also given the okay by the Ministry to continue offering the Fencing, Archery, and other classes that had been listed in the article as being unapproved.
*	*	*
After a few minutes, Voldemort banished the cat-o-nine tails and transfigured the rack back into a bed and Tom made the mistake of sighing in relief, thinking that his most recent torture session was over.
“You mentioned being Voldemort’s prisoner and being tortured,” Cedric said.  “How long were you his prisoner?”
Draco looked up and asked, “Is there something you wanted, Pansy?”
“Well, it’s just that I can’t figure out what to get Aarik for Christmas,” Draco said.  “I want to get him something extra special.  I’ve scoured all the shops in Hogsmeade, but I just can’t find anything that seems right.”
“Oh, I forgot to mention that detail,” Harry said with a sheepish grin.  “I’ve met all four of the founders,” and as Ginny looked at Harry like he’d lost his mind, he elaborated, “in portrait form.  Do you see that large gold-framed portrait above the fireplace?  Well, that’s Godric’s portrait, obviously he’s not in right now, but I’m sure you’ll meet him and the other founders eventually.”
“No, not at all,” Nick said as he stopped and opened the locket. Bill came over and took the locket in his hand and gazed down at the pictures of Nick’s two dads.
Pulling a book from a nearby shelf, Dumbledore asked, “Did it list any dates?”
“This,” Harry said as he held out the Marauder’s Map to Ryan to look at.  “It’s a magic map of the castle, shows every floor and every room well except for the Room of Requirement.  It also shows were everyone in the school is.”
"Matthew William Cromwell, will you just shut up?" Ryan said as he held up his hand to show two of his fingers about an inch apart. "I am this close to breaking the Restriction for the Use of Underage Wizardry and casting a silencing charm on you, so shut up already! I am one hundred percent totally okay with your relationship with Oliver. I don't know why you keep wondering if I'm okay with it. I mean, you know the wizarding world doesn't care about things like that. Anyway, I'd be a hypocrite if I had a problem with you being gay, since I'm gay myself."
Tom screamed in pain and as much as he didn’t want to, he soon found himself begging for mercy.  Voldemort stopped his assault and banished the whip, as Tom began crying, his tears stinging his wounded and burned flesh.
“I didn’t know any portraits of the founders existed in this school.”  Scrimgeour said.
“Oh Gods, Potter, are you really as stupid as you sound?  I’ve told you that my father punished me whenever I did something he didn’t like.  Well, it was for that reason that I have always acted a certain way in public.  If I hadn’t gotten mad about his imprisonment and he found out that I didn’t, he would probably have killed me for disloyalty.”
It was the Saturday morning immediately following his birthday, that Nicolas Delaney had a very interesting conversation with his new friend Harry.  Nick had known since the train ride to Hogwarts that Harry had slept with Bill Weasley, but he didn’t think much of it at the time.  However, when he saw Bill for the first time, Nick realized immediately what the appeal for Harry had been.  Nick usually didn’t go for red-heads, but in Bill’s case, he was definitely willing to make an exception.  Ever since the feast, Nick found himself thinking and fantasizing about his new professor.
“Well, my family actually has written rules of conduct,” Draco drawled.  “Over three hundred of them that all Malfoys are forced to memorize before they are even taught to walk.  Lucius would say that I’m spitting in the face of my ancestors, but I think the vast majority of the rules are extremely stupid.”
Bill noticed that Nick seemed to be showing off a bit, but he wasn’t about to complain.  He had after all been lusting over Nick since that first day he’d met him in Diagon Alley.  The two of them continued to exercise in silence for several minutes before Bill decided to break it by asking, “I heard you recently celebrated a birthday.  Are you enjoying being seventeen?”
*	*	*
“You mean you haven’t figured that out yet?” the woman asked.  “Why, I am Rowena Fiona Ravenclaw, founder of Ravenclaw House, and one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  You two don’t appear to be related, so I shall assume that only one of you is my heir.”
“I hope you won’t let the fact that Nick is friends with Gabrielle Delacour stop you from dating him, Bill. I really do think you’d be perfect together.”
Ryan, Justin, Matt, and Oliver continued to chat for several minutes, before both couples went back into the main room for another dance.
“Oh the fact that my parents and family don’t know about Nick and me,” Bill said.  “In fact, they don’t even know that I’m gay.”
"I take it you know each other?" Malkin asked as she looked up from Draco's list.
“To purge the school of all who in his view were unworthy of studying magic,” Hermione said.  “In other words, Muggle-borns like Justin and me.”
"Well, this is going to sound crazy,"  Dumbledore said, "but then you saw Atlantis, so after that, I'm sure just about anything is more believable."
*	*	*
Many hands went up and Dumbledore scanned over those who had their hands raised and after a moment, he asked, “Yes, Mr. Malfoy?”
“Yes.”
“According to the scrolls in Atlantis, Zeus made that rule about three thousand years ago.  The Lord of the Seventh Hell is constantly at war with the Lords of the Second and Eighth Hells, so as a means to try to keep his army of souls replenished, he created a powerful artifact resembling the veil that a widow might wear to a funeral.  Anyone who fell through it would be cast down into the Seventh Hell to serve as a member of his army.  Zeus then put the Archdevils of the Hells on notice that any future activities of that kind would not be tolerated, but for reasons known only to him, he allowed the Lord of the Seventh to keep his veil.”
“How’d you know he was coming?”  Ryan whispered as pulled his hood back just enough to reveal his face.
“Well, we have a plan then,” Snape said.  “This weekend Mr. Riddle will return to Hogwarts and Wormtail will get the punishment he deserves.”
Pausing for a moment, Salazar then said, “Now, I’ve been observing in silence for awhile now, as I wanted to see for myself the full extent of the corruption of my name.  There is absolutely no truth to all of the bloody purity crap that you’re all so intent on believing.  Despite what the Sorting Hat may have led you to believe, I did not hate Muggle-borns or Half-bloods, and I must certainly never thought that only Purebloods were worthy of studying magic.  All of the ideals that Voldemort and his followers support are the creation of Godric Gryffindor!”
“I have no idea,” Harry answered.  “Anyway, let’s go see Dumbledore.”
To say that I haven’t thought about telling Harry about my fantasies since we became friends would be a lie, as I have on many occasions.  I do not however know if Harry is even gay, so I’m afraid to tell him to be honest.  There’s also the fact that Harry was raised by Muggles, so I’m not sure how he even feels about gay people.  As I learned on my first day at Cromwell Hall, however, Muggles are not as open-minded about same-sex pairings as wizards are.  Charles did say that his late wife Katrina would have probably killed Matthew if she had found out that he was gay or dating Oliver.
Twenty minutes later, Harry was done eating breakfast when he noticed Ryan and Nicolas standing up from their tables and heading for the doors.  Hermione and Ron were once again distracted by each other, so they didn’t notice when Harry stood up and left the table to catch up with his newest friends.
“Colin, did you steal a book of invisibility charms from Ryan’s trunk?”  Harry asked, after taking a moment to reign in his temper.
“Define extremely long lived.”
“You mean?”  Dumbledore asked.
“Harry, where are we?”
"Thank you, Frances," Ryan said as he dried his eyes a second time while Frances turned and left the room. Taking a deep breath, Ryan stood and walked over to the bedroom fireplace. He grabbed a handful of Floo powder from the vase on the mantle, threw it into the fireplace and said, "Cromwell Hall, Yorkshire," as he stuck his head into the flames to inform his Uncle Charles of the bad news.
If he told anyone that, they'd probably assume that he was talking about his arch-nemesis, Harry Potter. The truth of the matter was, however, that the last person that Draco would want at his birthday party was his father's master, Lord Voldemort. He never told his father, because he knew that his father would kill him for such a betrayal, but Draco made up his mind a long, long time ago that he was not going to follow Voldemort. Over the years, his father had done everything he could to convince Draco that it was his duty to follow Voldemort; that he would be betraying the honor of the Malfoy family if he didn't follow Voldemort. Lucius had even gone so far as using the Imperius and Cruciatus curses on Draco several times in order to convince him that Voldemort was the best thing to happen to the wizarding world and was it's only hope for survival.
At this point, several people at the table started talking all at once, most of them asking Dumbledore why he'd say such a thing that couldn't possibly be true.  Raising his hands and calling for silence, however, Dumbledore said, "I expected you wouldn't take my word for it.  I can't say as I blame you, but perhaps you'll believe your own eyes."
“You’re right,” Draco said.  “It would also mean the end of the Gryffindor line.  The name may have died out, but the bloodline ends with you.  So, many in wizarding society would say that we’re both required to have children, if only to insure that the bloodlines reach another generation.”
“I’ll teach you how to dance.”
“I still don’t get it,” Ron said.  “What does Harry see in him?  Draco is an evil Slytherin bastard.  He is just like his father.  He does not care for anyone who is not a pureblood.  We have to get Harry away from that git before he can deliver him to You-Know-Who.”
“Well, that’s what glamour charms are for, Billy,” Nick said as he wrapped his arms around the redhead and rested his chin on his left shoulder.
*	*	*
*	*	*
Snape remained quiet, although the look on his face clearly said that he was not the least bit happy to see James Potter alive.
“Yes, Mr. Cornfoot,” Bill said pointing to Stephen.
“Hmm, seems Teryn was right,” Asheera commented.
“Yes, I’m in Gryffindor, why?”
Harry Potter and the Return of the Heirs
“Blaise, I’m talking to Draco, this doesn’t concern you,” Pansy said coldly.
*	*	*
“Only once in my life,” Bill answered, “when I was twenty years old; one tablespoon taken with my breakfast.  That day was probably one of the best of my adult life and I’m sure the Gringott’s goblins would probably agree, since during the course of that day I found about twenty million galleons worth of treasure for them.  Of course, I never told them that I’d taken Felix Felicis, or as greedy as goblins are, I’m sure I wouldn’t be standing here right now, as I would have died from an overdose of too much of a good thing.”
"Yes, I am," answered McGonagall.  "It's been awhile.  My condolences regarding your mother, she will be dearly missed."
“I apologize, Mistress,” Valen said as he waved his hand over his face, which caused subtle but distinct changes to his appearance.  His shoulder-length black hair grew about a foot longer and turned platinum blond and his blue eyes turned green.
Madame Malkin nodded and then said, "Well, why don't you browse the racks and let me know if there's anything you like. I can easily change the colors of something if you like."
“Thank you, Lucius,” Bellatrix said.  It was true, Bellatrix had been working on her appearance over the last few months, and while she wasn’t quite the ravishing beauty she had been before her time in Azkaban, she was looking much better.
“Oh and Dobby?”  Ryan said before Dobby left, “For the moment at least, I’d prefer that nobody knew about my being the heir or that these rooms exist.  So, please refrain from telling any of the professors and students.  You can tell the other house-elves if you need help cleaning, but that’s it.  Just make sure to tell them about my wish that nobody know for now.”
“Yes you are!”  Vaisey exclaimed.  “Bloody Hell, Pucey, are you really that stupid?  I’m not the traitor here, you are, and so is everyone else who fights against the Dark Lord.  He is the only chance of survival the Wizarding world has.  All the people who support diluting the purity of Wizarding blood need to be stopped and the Dark Lord is the best chance of success.”
And pass on to the young skills they didn't have prior.
“She thought that my schooling at Hogwarts was a waste of time,” Matthew answered.  “She wanted to pull me out of Hogwarts after second year so that I could attend Eton.”
"Yes, Mr. Ollivander," Helga said.  "I'm Helga Hufflepuff, one of the four founders of this school and the founder of the house you yourself were in I believe."
Speaking of couples, I did find Justin Finch-Fletchley snogging after hours with Ryan in a broom cupboard again.  This is the second time in as many weeks that I’ve come across them.  They really should be more careful or one of these days I fear that they’ll be caught by one of the other prefects, or worse, a professor.  Justin would be sure to lose his job as prefect, which would be a shame since he only just got the position this year after his classmate, Ernie MacMillan, decided to resign to concentrate more on his schoolwork.
Ron and Hermione told him that they would join him as soon as the normal Prefect's meeting was over. Of course, as much as Harry enjoyed spending time with Ron and Hermione, he hoped that a few other people might join them in the compartment, because more and more Harry was beginning to feel like a third wheel around Ron and Hermione. Harry was happy that they had finally gotten together, but watching them together made it all the more obvious how much his heart longed for that same kind of affection and love that they shared. Harry had tried to feel it with Bill, but it just never worked. He did love Bill, as he never would have been able to have sex with him if he didn't, but Harry knew that the love was not the kind that a lifetime commitment should be based on. He had discussed this at length with Bill and he totally agreed.
“Why thank you,” Brendan said.  “Of course, you’re right, I am only nineteen.  Or, at least, I was when my portrait was painted.  I could have had it updated over the years, but I rather liked the idea of eternal youth, so I decided to keep it the way it was.”
Severus just sighed and then nodded, as he placed a hand on his arm, "The Dark Mark."
*	*	*
“Why Valen, what an unexpected pleasure,” Matt said. “Please come in.”
"You've already met Malfoy?" Harry asked.
“That’s a difficult question, Madam,” King Erevan said.  “You see, I believe that Voldemort is unlikely to stop with just Britain.  I’m sure that if he succeeds in taking over it, he will turn his attention to other countries and eventually he’ll try to target Atlantis, as well.  Unfortunately, the Symphonia Ithikos clearly states that Atlantis cannot attack anyone unless we’re attacked first.  The definition of an attack would be Voldemort leading a raid on Atlantean soil.  It is unfortunately, very clear, that the attack must happen on Atlantean soil, so even if an Atlantean citizen were attacked in Britain, my hands would be tied.  The Olympians have not set foot on Earth in thousands of years, but I am not about to break a sacred pact with them.”
Severus made a grumbling noise, but otherwise said nothing and Asheera decided it best to drop it.
“Please call me Rowena.  As for the portraits, well, the only portraits of the founders are in our private quarters near the houses we founded.  Very powerful magic protects the quarters of each founder and only an heir can get past the magic and allow others to do so.  By finding my quarters, Ryan has also freed me to be able to visit other portraits.”
“I called you Professor.”
It was just after they had passed the temple that Asheera identified as being the Gates of Hades that the carriage slowed and stopped.  The driver of the carriage got down and proceeded to assist Asheera down, before helping Draco down.
“So?  Is that really a good reason to give up on over five years of friendship?”
*     *     *
“Yes, Aarik,” Draco said as he walked over to the door to the side room, opened it, and motioned for the people inside to come out.  “I’ve brought back your parents, as well as my mum and Zach’s cousin Cedric.”
“So he just left his newborn son?”  Bill asked.
Colin was indeed sitting in the common room, playing a game of Exploding Snap with Dennis and some of the other fifth-year boys.  As soon as Harry came in though, Colin was on his feet and enthusiastically said, “Hiya Harry!”
“I take it that it’s not there now?”
“You know, there is a very easy way to solve this,” Valen said.  “Mr. Potter?”
"No, he didn't feel up to it," Ryan said. "So, he just gave us his shopping list and his vault key."
“Mr. Potter?”
“Yes, of course, Severus,” Dumbledore said.  “Poppy do you have the potions I asked you to bring from the hospital wing?”
“Well, Ryan, it’s rather unbelievable,” answered Bill.  “Everyone in the school knows what the Sorting Hat said about each founder having an heir, but one just doesn’t really expect them to be someone they know.”
"The only reason he doesn't kill all the Death Eaters himself to increase his power, is because if he did, there'd be nothing binding him to this plane,"  McGonagall explained.  "The second he revealed his true nature, Asmodeus would have found out that he was on Earth and would have attempted to force him to return.  Bound to over two thousand living mortals, however, that's impossible because it's against cosmic law for devils to force living beings who were not born in the Hells to go there."
“Professor, you do know what they did, right?”  Adrian asked.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed.  “Professor Snape is brewing a potion right now concocted from one of Slytherin’s own recipes.  Slytherin says that it will allow us to see Tom in his prison so as to assess the danger level of a rescue mission.”
*	*	*
Sly Salazar Slytherin was known from his ambition,
The next morning, Tuesday, November 12, 1996, many of the students were feeling rather depressed because the first Quidditch match of the season had yet to take place.  In years past, it was usually the first Saturday of November, which should have been November Second, but Professor Dumbledore cancelled the match for reasons that he chose not to elaborate upon.
“GODRIC BRYANT GRYFFINDOR!”  Rowena yelled.  “You are so lucky that I am only a portrait now and am incapable of performing magic, because if I could I would hex you into the next galaxy!”
“I wasn’t under the impression that who we are talking about made a difference.”
"Well, it can't be Bill," Ron said. "He seemed so taken with Fleur. Charlie, well, I don't know. I thought he'd mentioned a boyfriend in one of his letters, but he said it was one of his co-workers in Romania."
Ryan couldn't help but smile at the two of them as he thought, 'Well, I guess now that Uncle Charles knows, they don't really care who knows they're together. It's about time.' Ryan just watched them for another minute, before heading into Madame Malkin's shop.
“Yes, Matt, I’ll think about it,” Ryan replied.  “Just be glad that didn’t say no right away.”
“I was just thinking that perhaps you and Nick should get together.”
“You are?”  Ginny asked.  “Wow, Harry, that’s amazing!”
“So, is that the only difference in the jewelry?”  Matt asked.  “That you wear a ring on both hands, instead of a ring on only the left hand?”
“I swear to you, Tom, you’re the only one I want,” Zach said.  “I’m not going to pretend that it will always be that way, because we are both still young and it’s possible our feelings could change.  We have not known each other very long, after all, but I would never cheat on anybody that I was with.  If my feelings for someone changed, I would sit down with that person and exhaust all possible avenues of rectifying the problem and if that didn’t work, then and only then would I break up with them, but I would never, ever cheat on anybody.”
"Yes," Oliver said, instantly lighting up at the mention of Quidditch, "I'm the reserve keeper for Puddlemere United. I only play when the normal keeper gets sick or injured and can't play, but I love it nonetheless."
“It's only a matter of time before what, Valen?”
Standing side by side, Cedric and James presented their wand warms for measurements as Ollivander once again turned his attention to the pile of boxes.  "Let's see, Cedric Diggory, your last wand was a pleasantly springy, 12 1/4 inch ash wand with the tail hair of a particularly fine male unicorn, correct?"
*	*	*
“Good point,” Nick said as he kissed the tip of Bill’s nose.  “As for telling people about us, I want to, eventually.  I just think that we should probably be together more then a week when we do start telling people.”
As they read the announcement, many Slytherin students got angry, because they totally supported the former members’ action against Draco and couldn’t believe that Adrian didn’t.  How could any proper thinking wizard not support it?  Draco was a traitor.  He was dating the enemy.
“Dating the Heir of Slytherin?”  Dumbledore asked a twinkle in his eye.
“So that means we’ll have to wait until November,” Harry said.  “Oh well, guess it would be too much to ask to find out everything at once.”
The young man laughed at that.  “No, Ryan, I am not Rowena’s son.  You’ll notice that I said my name was Brendan Connor Carnes-Ravenclaw.  Connor is my middle name, but Carnes is my maiden name.  I just hyphenated when I married.”
“So, he has prevented me from forcing his return, I see,” Asmodeus said. “He’s bound himself to over two thousand mortals – impressive. But, if he thinks for one minute that he’s going to unseat me, the all-powerful Asmodeus, he is sadly mistaken.”
“Yes, Harry Potter, sir.  Dobby will make all preparations.  Hope Harry Potter and Master Draco have a good evening.”
Bill nodded and after a pause, added, “You have my condolences, by the way.”
“Oh bloody hell, Harry,” Draco said.  “How could you ever do it with Weasley?”
The voice paused for a moment before it said, “You are a disgrace to wizarding kind and I’m going to make you pay for that.”
“Yes, well, as you may recall, I said that I could help you with both of your problems.”
The Bloody Baron nodded at the nurse, before he sailed out of the room after Peeves, whose screams of fright could be heard getting ever softer as he tried to flee the Slytherin ghost.
“Personally, I always liked Harry,” James interjected.  “I thought Aarik was a bit too formal, but I respected Lily’s desire to name you after her late cousin.”
"Still wearing your flesh?" the guard asked in his low voice that had a hint of incredulity in it.
“Sorry, I’ve never introduced myself, Headmaster,” Alaric said, “but I’ve become a rather solitary being in the last thousand or so years.  The majority of the other ghosts don’t even know I’m here.  I’m Alaric Sebastian Bryant Slytherin-Gryffindor, Godric and Salazar’s first-born and only child.”
“Yes, I must admit I never expected it to take that long for our descendants to find us.”
“What do you mean, Alaric?”  Nickolas asked.
We are at war and it is a very dark time,
“Unfortunately, yes,” Draco said.  “There’s an old law from about six hundred years ago that says if a pure-blood family is unable to find suitable pure-blooded wives for their children, that those children may marry each other in order to produce a legitimate heir to carry on the family name and bloodline.”
“I agree with Cedric,” Lily said.  “I’ve missed so much of Aarik’s life, and I too would like to have at least a week of peaceful time to catch up with him.”
“What is it, Ryan?  Did you find something?”
“Yes, he was, but again, who is Aarik?”  Harry asked.
"Okay," Draco said as his mother flashed him a smile and left the room.
“Rowena, don’t you dare call Alaric his son!”  Godric roared.  “That bastard gave up his right to be called a father when he killed Alaric!”
“So did Stephen and I, but ours wasn’t perfect,” Hermione said. “What did you do differently?”
One of Colin’s friends, fellow fifth-year Andrew Kirke, decided to help Colin and pulled out his wand.  Harry noticed and said, “I wouldn’t do that if I were you,” but Andrew didn’t listen and said, “Finite Incantatem!”
It is reported that Nicolas Delaney is bisexual and currently romantically involved with William Arthur Weasley, formerly a curse-breaker for Gringotts’ Wizarding Bank, now teaching Potions at Hogwarts!  Reports indicate that Albus Dumbledore knows about it and has done nothing to stop it.  The fact that the Headmaster of Hogwarts would allow a student to date a professor is most disturbing.  See page 4 for pictures of the couple kissing and page 7 for some of the less risqué pictures from Mr. Weasley’s June 1996 layout in Playwitch magazine.
The Ball lasted well into the night, before finally dieing down at about midnight. As the last of the stragglers left the room, only a handful of people remained, all of who knew that Ryan was Rowena’s heir.
“Liar!”  Tom yelled.  “I saw you in his arms!  I saw you!  So don’t stand there and deny it, Zacharias!”
“Okay, so you’ve explained why you sold the information about Harry,” Ryan asked, “but what about the rest of the information about the other people in the article?”
“Yes,” Aarik said.
“Well, Draco, most of what you said is true,” Narcissa said.
Draco grinned, as did Zach, and Draco said, “Its okay, Zach.  Nothing you could have gotten me could ever compare to what I got you.  Well, assuming that is you like what I got you, I don’t know.  The gifts I acquired today are not normal gifts.  They were not bought in a store and they can’t be wrapped.”
“No need for that,” Rowena said.  “I know which tower you’re referring to.  That particular tower was originally the Astronomy Tower for the first few years that Hogwarts was open until we built a taller one.  We then turned that tower into a large guest suite for important guests.  Let me guess, you speak a password to the gargoyle, it jumps aside, and then there’s a staircase beyond which moves, correct?”
“We haven’t really talked about it,” Matthew said, “but, yes, I think I’d like to have children at some point.  What about you, Oliver?”
Asheera smiled, nodded, and launched into the same explanation that she had given Draco only hours earlier.
“So have I,” Bill revealed.
“Yes, Ginny,” Harry said.  “I like Draco and before you say anything, I’m sure you’ve noticed that he’s changed quite a bit since this summer.  Watching his father kill his mother had a very profound effect on him.”
“Yes, Ryan,” Brendan confirmed.  “I am Rowena’s husband and your twenty-third-great-grandfather.”

"Yes my Lord," Wormtail said with a bow as he turned to leave.
“Any idea which of the spells was cast first?”  Asheera asked.
*	*	*
Draco nodded.  He would have said more, but the carriage had come to a stop at the large gates.  A guard came out of a nearby gatehouse and after seeing Asheera, he bowed, before waving his hand at the gates, opening them.  The carriage then continued to move as it went through the large gates into what Draco assumed must be the Temple District.
Still, Ryan did have many unanswered questions about his father. He wondered, for example, why his surname was Cromwell, which was his mother Alexandra's maiden name, rather than his father's name. Lucinda, however, had never been very forthcoming about information pertaining to family history. Whenever asked about it, she'd immediately change the subject, as if there was some deep, dark family secret that she didn't want to come to light. He'd tried asking his cousin Matt's parents, Charles and Katrina Dashwood Cromwell, but they didn't know anymore about it than he did, or at least that's what they claimed. Matt's mother suffered a stroke and died last year, so now with his grandmother dead, it was just Matt, Charles, Ryan, and the house-elves in the large manor, or at least that's what Ryan thought.
Meanwhile in Gryffindor Tower, having no knowledge of anything that had transpired elsewhere that day, Ron and Hermione were talking about Aarik and Draco.  Ron still could not wrap his head around the fact that Aarik actually liked Draco, not only as a friend, but also as a potential lover.
“Yes,” Draco answered.
“Yes, Zacharias, you do,” Sprout answered.
“Aren’t you forgetting Hera?”  Phineas Nigellus asked.  “She was the Queen of the Gods.”
Like Aarik Potter, it turns out that Ryan isn’t even his real name.  His real name is Kyrian Corelian Laitannen, the son of the late Alexandra Fiona Cromwell and Lord Corelian Anilus Laitannen, who has been visiting Hogwarts with his wife, Lady Asheera Liana Lasinius Laitannen, since the night of the Hogwarts Halloween Ball on the 31st of October.  Lord and Lady Laitannen claim they are from Atlantis, which they say was not destroyed as was believed when it sank beneath the Atlantic Ocean thousands of years ago.  See page 5 for reports from our experts who say that Lord and Lady Laitannen are crazy.
“Thank you, Alaric,” Harry said as he stood up and headed out of the Great Hall, with Hermione, Bill, Ron, Nick, Ryan, Zach, Justin, and Draco following, in addition to several other members of Gryffindor House.
“Anyway, to answer your question, mum,” said Draco, “I never really hated Aarik.  I just acted like I did to please father so that he wouldn’t punish me.  I stopped caring about pleasing him though when he killed you.  I will admit that I have on occasion felt a bit jealous of Aarik, but that was tempered by ever deepening feelings for him since our fourth year.”
*	*	*
Looking around the room, McGonagall said, “If you’re not a sixth-year, please leave. Seventh-years please stay in the tower, because I’ll be dealing with your schedules when I finish with the sixth-years.” All of the seventh-year students did as their Head of House instructed and headed up the stairs to their dormitories, while the students in other years grabbed their belongings, went over to the portrait and left.
“In addition to finding the info that made us think Ryan might be Rowena’s heir, we also found a note about a rumor that the founders had their own suites of rooms outside of the staff wing.  The note said that it was believed that the founders’ quarters might actually be near their houses.”
“You’re right, I did say that and it’s true.  When I died, the protective magic of my quarters kicked in immediately and unfortunately, the portrait version of me was here in my quarters at the time.  So, the magic effectively trapped me here and prevented Brendan or anyone else from coming to visit me.”
as being Narcissa Malfoy.
“You can make me stay here, Your Majesty,” Corelian said.  “You can even make me never see my son again, but you cannot ask me to forget about him.  He may not be a pureblood Atlantean, but he is still my flesh and blood and I will not forget him.”
“I’m almost afraid to ask, but what is the number one rule in the Malfoy Code of Conduct?”
“If it is, I’m having the same one, Pomona,” Flitwick replied, as he took a seat.
“He actually likes it, mum,” Aarik said as he kissed Draco on the cheek.  “He fancies himself the Prince of Slytherin.  The ice part comes from his pale skin, silver eyes, and blond hair.  All of which I love.”
Draco knew that he was about to break Rule #100 in the Malfoy Code of Conduct, which stated that what Malfoys did in the privacy of their bedrooms should remain private, but he didn’t care.  He was determined to get Pansy off his back and he was willing to take drastic measures to do so.  Looking around the room, Draco noticed Adrian Pucey standing in the doorway to the private room given to the Head Boy or Head Girl if they were in Slytherin.
Six-year-old Draco Malfoy was sitting alone in his bedroom.  Unlike most children his age, he wasn't allowed to go outside and play.  He rarely ever saw the outdoors.  So when his father came in and told him they were going out for a while, Draco was overjoyed.  Outside, Draco followed Lucius down one of the paths in the formal gardens, just happy to be outdoors rather than cooped up inside the Manor.  It wasn't long however, before Draco's good mood slipped when he saw where his father was going: the Malfoy Family Mausoleum.

“How is that you as Godric’s heir can speak Parseltongue?”  Slytherin demanded.
“What do you mean?”
Zach playfully punched Cedric in the shoulder for the comment.
“I’m going to make Matthew, Oliver, and myself invisible and then Apparate us to the Visitor’s Entrance,” Corelian answered.
*	*	*
“It sounds like Harry is one very remarkable young man,” Brendan commented.
Adrian didn’t know why Draco was calling him over, but he was curious, so he obliged.
Nick opened the book to page 239 and looked down at the page.  The potion was very complicated, containing many ingredients Nick had never heard of.  He also couldn’t help but notice that it said it would take twenty-four hours to brew.  Nick knew that compared to some other potions, such as the Polyjuice Potion, which took a month to brew, twenty-four hours was a short brewing time.  Nick was glad, however, that Professor Snape would be doing the brewing, because while he did have an Outstanding Potions OWL, Nick had certainly never attempted to brew anything with a brewing time of more than six hours.
Thankfully, Harry was on the other side of the shop with some of the other students, so he was out of earshot and didn’t hear this conversation.
“Tell Godric about Narcissa’s aunt and uncle then,” Harry said.
"Yes, me, Lucius," shouted Charles Cromwell.
“I’m sticking with Harry for the moment,” Harry answered.  “Maybe after the war is over, I’ll revert back to Aarik but, for the moment, it’s Harry.”
“Indeed it is, my boy,” Salazar confirmed.  “The recipes in that book are all of my most secret creations.  So, I took great pains to make sure that nobody would ever be able to steal them from me.”
“Orchideous!” the six students said, but nothing happened.
*	*	*
“Miss Granger,” Valen said.  “Nothing is impossible; improbable maybe, but not impossible.”
“Well, what would you prefer to do then?”
Meanwhile back at Cromwell Hall, Charles was sitting at his desk in the library, as Draco laid on one of the sofas, reading a book. The sudden pop breaking the silence, caused a startled Charles to jump.
“Every one thousand years, nine new witches and wizards are chosen and trained to master one of the nine spheres.  They use the powers of their sphere to protect not only Atlantis, but to also guard one of the nine ancient artifacts created by Posiedon, the God of the Seas and the Patron Deity of Atlantis.”
“I’m not saying that guys shouldn’t wear pink,” Ryan said.  “I happen to have three pink shirts that I wear fairly regularly, but I just don’t think it’s appropriate for a formal event.”
“One,” Harry said, before calling out, “Dobby!”
“Hmm, I think it would be cool,” Ryan said.  “Plus, it could also be useful because if your partner was ever kidnapped, you could talk to them telepathically to try and assess the danger level before just Apparating to their location unprepared.”
“So, all of these buildings are temples?”  Draco asked as he looked around at the various buildings, all of which were among the grandest buildings that Draco had ever seen.

Before leaving the room though, Harry turned to look at Draco and blew him a kiss, which caused Draco to smile.
‘I like the way you think,’ Corelian thought.  Without a word, Corelian cast a silencing charm, followed by a powerful charm to lock the Minister’s office door.
I'm not sure where exactly the time is going, because it just seems to be going by so fast right now. Of course, I'm certainly not complaining, because I'll be very happy to get out of Grimmauld Place and back to Hogwarts. Even though it isn't nearly as fancy, I've always felt much more at home in the common room or in the boy's dormitory of Gryffindor tower then I think I ever will in the opulence of Grimmauld Place.
“Colin, has it ever occurred to you that I don’t answer all the personal questions you ask me because I don’t think it’s any of your business?”  Harry asked.
“What seems to be the problem, Corelian?”  Calliara asked.  “Not that we aren’t pleased to meet Minister Scrimgeour, but why have you brought him here?”
“Yes, Zach,” Draco confirmed.  “I’ve been to Tartarus and back.  I risked my life today to give us all a gift to end all gifts.  I challenged Death himself and won.  I must say that I’m feeling quite proud of myself.”
Colin looked like he didn’t want to answer the question, so Bill said, “My threat from earlier still stands, Mr. Creevey, so I suggest you start talking.”
Bill tried to catch Nick, but wasn’t quite fast enough and got pulled down with him. The two men landed in the grass in a tangle of limbs, with Nick lying on top of Bill. Nick looked down into Bill’s eyes and stared, mesmerized, for a few seconds before he decided to close the distance between their lips. It wasn’t long before Bill was eagerly returning the kiss as he raised his arms from the ground and wrapped one around Nick’s waist, pulling him closer, and placed his other hand behind Nick’s head.
To be continued.
“You’re grasping at straws, Pansy,” Tracey said.  “The sooner you admit that Draco doesn’t want you, the better off you’ll be.”
"No, of course not," Charles said as he recognized the after effects of the Cruciatus curse, and ran a hand gently through Draco's hair, attempting to calm him down a bit.  "I'm an Auror, so I certainly am not going to hurt you.  Now, why don't you get dressed?"
“Mother, with all due respect, Lucius doesn’t deserve my respect,” Draco said.  “Nor does he deserve yours.  He’s used the Cruciatus and Imperius on me more times then I can count or even care to remember.  He also used the Killing Curse on you, so while I realize you must have loved him at some point to have married him, I don’t think he deserves any of your loyalty now.”
Even though he knew that it was irrational for thinking such things, for a long time Harry felt as if he was the only person in the world experiencing the feelings that he was having.  He felt so alone, and with nobody around to talk about it to, he figured that if he pushed it down far enough, he could be normal.
"Yes, it does," Charles answered, "but Headmaster Dumbledore owled me and asked me to bring you to his office today so that you can get sorted into a house. He figured you might feel a little out of place if you ended up being sorted with the first years at the arrival feast."
As the moon rose above Privet Drive, a teenage boy with a mess of raven black hair sat alone in his small upstairs bedroom. He was sitting at his desk, looking through a leather-bound photo album. The boy, sixteen-year-old Harry Potter, sat in silence as he looked at the wedding pictures of his good friend and former Care of Magical Creatures teacher, Rubeus Hagrid, to Madame Maxime Olympe, the Headmistress of Beauxbatons Academy. Hagrid had wanted to invite Harry to the wedding, and would have likely asked Harry to stand for him as his best man, but Professor Dumbledore decided that it would be far too dangerous for Harry to leave the Dursleys' during summer break and travel to France for the wedding. So, Hagrid sent several pictures of the wedding and, while it wasn't quite as good as actually being there, Harry was glad that Hagrid had found happiness nonetheless.
“It’s getting rather close to curfew you know.”
"Thank you, Mr. Ollivander," Narcissa said with a smile.  "I must admit that this one definitely does seem more comfortable than my old one.  I shan't miss it in the slightest."
“No, I don’t,” Godric said, “but I get the feeling you’re going to tell me.”
“Just one, Bill, that’s all I’m asking for. Think of it as a sort of goodbye kiss; to formally end our sexual relationship and just be friends from now on. At least, outside of the classroom, I promise I’ll act like a student in class and not let on that there was ever anything more then that between us.”
Harry was about to go back upstairs when his Aunt Petunia called, "Boy, get in here!"
"My, my you certainly have grown into a fine young man since I last saw you," Malkin said with a smile. "I only wish it was more pleasant circumstances that brought you back. I was so upset when I heard about your grandmother's passing. Please accept my most heartfelt condolences, she was a great woman and I'll miss her dearly."
“I believe you know my son as Ryan Cole Cromwell,” Corelian answered.
“Yes, Ry, we have,” Matt said with a smile as he took Oliver’s hand in his and kissed it. “Ollie and I will be married on the 23rd of December.”
*	*	*
“Why?” Harry asked in an innocent tone. “Aren’t you enjoying it, Professor?”

“Yeah, it’s so real that I almost can’t believe that I’m still at Hogwarts.”
Blaise laughed, prompting Harry to give him a strange look, before Blaise said, “Draco is not my boyfriend.”
I suppose the knowledge that their lover was thinking about somebody else while having sex with them would hurt most people greatly, but Blaise just grinned and accepted it like it was nothing.  He told me that he was fine with it because we aren’t in love with another and he wasn’t going to hold it against me because he admitted that he doesn’t think about me during sex, though he again dodged the question of who he does think about.
He said that all the wizards and witches who had decided to marry outside of all-magic families and marry a Muggle were forcing the entire Wizarding World into weakness and extinction by destroying the purity of magic blood. I know that many of the older pureblood families think that to mix magic blood with non-magic blood will weaken the magic blood, thus making the resulting child a less powerful wizard or witch. Only problem is that few people seem to realize that magic blood is very hard to kill off entirely. I mean, how else could Muggle-born witches and wizards exist? If you go far enough back in the family trees of a Muggle-born you'll find that they were descended from magical people. So, personally, I think magic is not in the blood but in the genes, which can then be dominant or recessive when passed onto the next generation. That theory would also explain the existence of squibs.
“Yes, Rowena, I did,” Salazar confirmed.  “It’s one of my secret recipes.  When it is drunk, it will cause the imbiber to be surrounded by an aura.  The color of the aura depends on how powerful the person is.  A green aura means they are among the most powerful witches and wizards alive, while a red aura means that they are among the weakest.  And yes, I created the potion during the years following Godric’s and my divorce, so the colors are not a coincidence.  I’ll have Nick translate the recipe and give Professor Weasley a copy of it so that it can be brewed in class at his earliest convenience.  It’s a simple potion – even the first years should be able to handle it.”
“Professor Lasinius, do you know these people?”  Dumbledore asked as he came up to the group.
“It’s the Death Eaters, sir,” Adrian answered.  “They’re attacking Hogsmeade.”
“Yes, Nicolas,” Valen confirmed.  “Ariana Merope Riddle and Professor Angelique Josette Byrne are one in the same.”
Ryan did as he was told and went out through the swinging door to the small and informal dining room that he remembered was only used by the immediate Cromwell family. Whenever they hosted dinner parties at the manor they used the Grand Ballroom for dinner. Having been married to a Muggle, Ryan's Uncle Charles was rather keen on Muggle inventions and technology, so he had the floor in the ballroom changed so that with the press of a button it would open up and a large mahogany dining table with enough matching chairs to seat about three hundred people would rise out of the floor. After dinner, the table would be lowered so that everyone could dance.
Ryan, Justin, and Asheera followed them out of the room.
*	*	*
“Yes, although for reasons I am unable to discuss at the present time, he has not been able to be a part of his son’s life.”
“The Atlantic Ocean, of course,” Corelian answered in a tone that suggested the answer to the question should have been obvious.
“Well, that’s understandable.”
After several moments of silence, Hermione found her voice and asked, “Harry is this some kind of joke?”
“That’d be cool.  Now, you said you think, does that mean you’re not sure?”
“Thank you.  That means a lot coming from you, considering how my father treated you.  I tried to get him to change his mind considering that you are family, but you knew my father.  Once he made up his mind, there was no changing it.”
“Pepper-Up Potion and Magic Restorative Draft,” Poppy said.  “Albus knew that Nikolas might be a bit drained after casting the charm tonight and wanted to be prepared.”
“Yes, as you requested, I’ve been keeping a very close eye on him.  He’s been in the restricted section of the school library for weeks now with a Gryffindor girl named Hermione Granger looking for information on the Hogwarts founders.  They obviously must have found something because last night he found the private quarters of Rowena Ravenclaw and he later told a group of friends that he was Ravenclaw’s heir.”
“Well, if he wasn’t a wizard he couldn’t have used the Cruciatus curse on me all those times and he couldn’t have used the Killing curse on my mother.”
“It’s my pleasure, Mr. Cromwell,” Professor Lasinius said. “Follow me.”
Godric lowered his sword and sheathed it, obviously not wanting to hold Salazar at sword point in front of their son, even if it was only his ghost.
“I didn’t mean that I wouldn’t be upset by it,” Aarik clarified.  “I only meant that I could imagine a year without it.  We already had one, in case you forgot.”
'Hmm, if I can't get the information out of the house-elves,' Ryan thought, 'I guess I'll just need to try the sneakier approach.'
“Dobby always happy to help Harry Potter,” Dobby said.
“Decided not to bring a certain black and blond haired person as your date, Bill?”  Harry asked.
“How is that possible?  They were both men.”
“I understand your wand’s core and the time it’s been in use was undeterminable,” Rufus said.  “I cannot allow you to have it back.  It is illegal to bring an unknown magical item into the Ministry, as the security wizard at the desk has already told you.”
Aarik explained what happened to his parents, during which time Ron and Hermione watched in silence.  Hermione got a strange expression on her face after a moment and Aarik soon asked, “What’s wrong Hermione?”
"Of course, Ryan dear," Frances said. "I shall miss you and again, I'm very sorry for your loss."
“That’s what you think, boy,” Voldemort said, as he again conjured a whip and began to lash the sixteen-year-old boy in front of him.  The difference this time being that Voldemort conjured the whip so that it would be alight with magical fire, so in addition to slicing Tom’s skin open, it was also searing it.
“Well, I haven’t been there in a thousand years, so I have no idea.”
The scholarship and orphanage really struck a cord with me since Sirius wanted them to be named for my parents. A scholarship fund for Hogwarts is a great idea because it is a boarding school and I'm sure there are students who might not be able to attend simply due to the fact that their families can't afford the tuition. The orphanage is also a good idea because, being for wizarding orphans, the children will at least be around other magical children growing up. Sirius wanted Mrs. Weasley and Lupin to get the orphanage up and running. At least with them in control, no wizarding orphan will be turned away because of their parentage.
Pansy’s reflection rolled its eyes at her and the other three girls in the room finished getting ready for the Ball and left the room, wanting to put as much distance between themselves and Pansy as possible, considering that she was obviously crazy in addition to being totally delusional.
“Well, the thing I’ve always made fun of Weasley for the most is that his family is so poor.  If I heard correctly, that’s no longer the case.”
“So, which piece of jewelry grants the lifespan and youth to non-Atlantean couples?”
Before Bill had even managed to pull an inch away from the raven-haired teen, Harry pushed him onto his back and was soon lying on top of the older red-head, kissing him with the kind of passion that only a hormonal teenager can muster.

“I take it since she’s marrying this Phillipe Fortier,” Angelique said, “that you are not Fleur’s mate.”
“He what? How does he know that I’m gay?”
“Well, that’s not entirely true, actually,” Valen said.  “As requested, I performed background checks on all of his new friends here at Hogwarts.  One of them, a sixth-year Gryffindor named Harry Potter, was sent a warning letter in his second year for casting a Floating Charm, which was illegal since he’s underage and he did it outside of school.  I did some further checking though and it turns out it was actually a house-elf named Dobby who cast the charm.”
I suppose the reason that I’m awake so early is because of what transpired last night with Malfoy.  I never thought I’d find myself in the position of having him cry on my shoulder, while I comforted him.  Of course, I can certainly understand why he needed comforting, because losing one’s mother is bad enough, but actually witnessing her murder makes it even worse.  I can’t imagine what it would be like if one’s father was the murderer, but I’d guess that would make it worse still, even when you have an evil git like Lucius Malfoy for a father.
On Friday, November Sixteenth, Colin looked at his watch and breathed a sigh of relief.  Transfiguration class was almost over.  True, each class ending brought him that much closer to his nightly detention, but Colin really didn’t mind because of all his subjects, he found Transfiguration to be his worst.  He was sure that he’d fail to get an OWL in the subject, but since that meant being able to drop it next year, he certainly wasn’t about to complain.
“Granger, Hermione,” McGonagall called, and Hermione was soon scheduled to take Charms, Defense against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Potions, before putting her name down for Defense Arts and Basics of Battlefield Medicine.
“For what it’s worth,” Harry said, “I really am sorry about your mum. I know how painful it is to see your mum murdered and I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.”
Harry was sitting alone in the master suite of Grimmauld Place.  Once Sirius' will had been read, Molly and Arthur had insisted that Harry move into the room, since he was now the owner of the house.  Truth be told, while Harry did enjoy sharing a room with Ron, he was also happy to have his own at last.  Harry was sitting on the bed, lost in his thoughts, when there was a knock on the door.
CHARLES MATTHEW CROMWELL, born 30-07-1954, age 42
“Those large oak doors over there, Harry,” Rowena said as she pointed at them.  “Enter the room behind them and I’ll move to my portrait in there and give you more instructions.”
“Nope, definitely not,” Harry answered.  “No girl is my type, Blaise.  I’m gay.”
“You’re suddenly a matchmaker as well as a dance instructor?”
Almost immediately, the potion turned from a dark black to a clear white and began to glow, as both Harry and Nikolas swayed on their feet, obviously drained from the amount of power necessary to pierce the powerful magic of a lesser devil.
“Draco and I are just friends,” Blaise clarified.  “We went to the dance together and acted like more than friends though to annoy Pansy Parkinson.  She wants Draco, badly, but she refuses to believe that he’s gay.”
“Finnegan, Seamus,” McGonagall called, as Seamus walked over to McGonagall and Lavender added her name to the sheets for Defense Arts, Art, and Music. Seamus was soon scheduled for Charms, Defense against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Archery, and Fencing, before adding his name to the sign-up sheets for Defense Arts and Unarmed Self-Defense.
Before Hermione could say anything else however, Remus Lupin walked into the room, followed shortly thereafter by the rest of the Weasley clan.
After Dobby popped out, Aarik said softly, “I’m sure we will.”
The boy picked up a piece of the bread and with great difficulty brought it up to his mouth.  As the boy repeated the process, it got easier, as his muscles adjusted to the use.  He soon finished eating the strips of bread and then grabbed the cup of water with both hands.  The boy shakily brought the cup to his lips and drank, only about half of it making it into his mouth, as the rest dripped out of the corners of his mouth.
“That’s true to a point, Aarik,” Asheera explained.  “It’s true that the arcane magic practiced by mortals cannot bring back the dead.  However, the divine magic of the Olympian gods is an entirely different form of magic, which can do practically anything.”
“Yes,” Draco answered again.
"There's no need for that, Ryan," Frances said. "My mother was a healer for over fifty years, so she taught me everything she knew. I tried every spell I could think of, but she didn't respond. It's too late, Ryan, I'm so sorry."
"Well, we were just about to get our books," Harry said. "Would you care to join us, Ryan, Nicolas?"
Aarik returned the blond’s grin, before lunging at him.  The two boys were soon wrapped tightly in each other’s arms, as their lips sealed so tightly that an onlooker wouldn’t be able to tell where Draco’s lips ended and Aarik’s began.
“Well, grandmother,” Nick said, “I’m sure you must have some idea.  Bill was a Gryffindor in school and I’m a Slytherin.  With Voldemort’s rise to power, many people have begun to think of all Slytherins as the embodiment of evil.”
Nick knew that Bill was probably remembering some of the times that he’d slept with Harry, but Nick knew that it was over between the two of them.  Nick was also not the jealous type, so, he wasn’t about to get mad that Bill was blushing over some of his more intimate memories of Harry.
“Yes, they are,” answered Asheera, as she started pointing at each temple they passed and naming it.  Some of the temples she named were the Citadel of Poseidon, Amphitrite’s Lagoon, Zeus’ Stronghold, the Orchard of Hera, the Garden of Demeter, the Arbor of Athena and the Oracle of Apollo.
“Matthew Cromwell.  My father was Auror Charles Cromwell.  I’ve been asked to clean out his cubicle and to visit the Office of Family Services to assume the guardianships of two minor wizards in his care.  I have two people with me.”
“So says the Hufflepuff,” Harry shot back with a smile.
Looking over at Hermione, Harry noticed that she looked a little put out that Bill hadn’t called on her yet, but she did flash a smile at Harry to let him know she wasn’t mad at him.
“No, Justin,” Asheera said with a smile, “not a rock spelled R-O-C-K.  Corelian was referring to a roc, spelled R-O-C.  It’s a very large hawk-like bird, comparable in size to a dragon.  It has two heads and is capable of picking up an elephant in its claws to feed to its young.”
Well, today is the first day of classes. Normally I probably wouldn’t even be awake right now and I would have woken up in a fashion similar to yesterday: with Hermione shaking me, trying to get me to wake up with just enough time to quickly eat breakfast before having to go to my first class.  Speaking of first classes, my first class this morning is double Potions; usually I would hate spending all morning in that class, but maybe with Bill teaching it won’t be so bad.
That seemed to placate Severus and the nurse, who both went back to their work.  As Asheera stood next to the bed and positioned her hands a few inches above a particularly nasty gash across Draco’s chest, she began chanting in an ancient Atlantean dialect.  Valen and Asheera herself were the only ones in the room who actually understood what she was saying, but understanding it wasn’t important, as long as it helped Draco.
“Sounds good to me,” Matt answered.  “We picked the 23rd of December as a wedding date, if that’s okay Corelian.”
“No, Cedric,” Draco said.  “You’ve been dead, so you wouldn’t know.  In a nutshell, Godric and Salazar were married and had a son.  Their son died, they both blamed each other for it and they both did things to get revenge on the other.  Godric’s means of revenge was to amend the memories of the Sorting Hat so that it would malign Salazar’s memory with all the lies that spurred the purity of blood nonsense so common these days.”
“We’ve been friends since childhood,” Valen answered.  “He’s also my brother-in-law; my elder sister’s husband.”
At that point, Aarik launched into the explanation that Draco had given him in Dumbledore’s office, adding the information he had been present to hear Asheera add.  When he finished, both Ron and Hermione were slack jawed for a moment.
Hermione heard the comment and then explained about the charm that Rowena had taught her.
“Sure, Ron,” Harry said with a smile.  Harry truly had missed his best and first friend, so he was happy that the distance between them was finally over.
Adrian nodded before extracting his head from the flames.  Turning to the group in the room with him, he said, “Professor Dumbledore said he’ll send help as soon as possible.”
“Master, please,” Wormtail croaked out, before he coughed and wheezed.
Albus just nodded and sipped his tea before asking, “So, Valen, how do you know Mr. Cromwell?”
“Well, I don’t know about you,” Aarik said, “but I’ve had enough of serious discussion for right now.”
"That's right," Harry said. "Bill told me all about that. Fleur was convinced that he was her mate, so she was using her powers on him all the time, because he wasn't being as receptive as she would have liked. She finally gave up the idea that he was her mate after all of the tests were done because they determined that he was most definitely not her mate; a fact which he would have made perfectly clear if he had been in his right mind at the time, since he is very much so gay. You can trust me when I say that considering how many times we've, um, had sex."
“Of course, that’s not a problem,” Corelian said.
“Now, before we begin, I’m going to ask that all of you stand up and go to the back of the room, as we will have a seating chart this year.  It will help me to memorize all of your names, but Professor Dumbledore has also asked all the teachers with multiple house classes implement a seating chart that mixes the houses up, rather than letting housemates sit together.”
"Asheville Academy of the Arcane."
“Who is Aarik Potter?”  Harry asked.
“Sponsor you so that you can get married in Atlantis,” Ryan answered.  “I’d have to donate a few drops of blood and you two would have to agree to an Atlantean wedding ceremony and wear the traditional Atlantean wedding jewelry, but in turn, you’ll both have my eternal youth and lifespan.  Then I won’t have to watch you get old and die, so I’m really hoping you’ll agree.”
“You wouldn’t know most of them, Ryan,” Corelian answered, “despite the fact that you are related either by blood or marriage to all of them.  The nine Lords and Ladies of the Circle are currently all members of two of the oldest and most prominent Atlantean houses, the Laitannen and Lasinius families, in addition, of course, to Atlantis’ royal family, the Rivendells.”
“None taken, Headmaster,” Snape said.  After a moment, Snape’s face changed, as the fear he was feeling inside, slipped through his mask.  “Speaking of being a marked Death Eater, Headmaster, at the meeting tonight Voldemort said that in taking the Mark, we’ve all condemned our souls to the Hells for eternity.  I’ve never given much thought to the afterlife, but given the choice, I really would prefer not to spend eternity in the Hells.”
“Yeah, I’m gay,” confirmed Blaise, somewhat absently, as he was deep in thought.

“Well, grandmother, that’s one of those important things we needed to tell you,” Nick said as he wrapped his arm around Bill’s waist.  “We’re together.”
To be continued.
Snape pinched the bridge of his nose for a moment, before giving Asheera a withering look and asked, “What in Merlin’s name possessed you to allow this?  It was just last month that Poppy, you, and I spent hours feverishly trying to save Draco’s life and now you allow him to do something that could have made that all for naught?”
Valen headed for the door as Albus bent low over his desk and started writing something.  Valen quickly scanned the room to make sure none of the portraits were watching him before he pointed at Albus and whispered, “Obliviate!”
"What?"
“I haven’t known him long,” Asheera said, “but he seems like a perfectly lovely young man to me.”
"No, he doesn't," Oliver said. "I maintain my own flat. Charles leaves early every morning for work, so I come over after he leaves and then Matt and I have breakfast and well, other things that you already know about."
“Aarik, my son died,” Godric said.  “I would hardly call that petty.”
“No, I’m not,” said Harry.  “Hermione and I just friends and we went to the dance together as such.”
“Well, let’s get this over with,” Harry said as he walked over to the common room fireplace and traced Godric’s initials on the mantelpiece.  Much like the entrance to the other quarters, the letters soon began to glow in bright red as the mantle began to glow golden.  The sound of stone moving against stone filled the room as the fireplace swung away from the wall to reveal an archway behind it.
Pulling a bundle from an inner pocket of his robes, Ollivander enlarged it to reveal a small mountain of boxes he'd brought with him from his store.  Quietly perusing the boxes for several moments, Ollivander finally pulled out a box, removed a wand from it, and handed it to Lily.
*	*	*
“Mr. Malfoy?”  Dumbledore asked, clearly shocked, as Draco Malfoy stepped down from the coach.  “Why are you with the Dullahan?”
“Very good, Albus,” Valen answered.  “At first there were a few problems, as many of the students had never handled a sword, but they’re learning.”
“No, he isn’t,” Remus said.  “As I’m sure you both know, I’m a werewolf and my sense of smell is much greater then a normal human’s.  When Cedric opened the door – and I am fairly certain it is Cedric, as I was his fifth-year Defense Against the Dark Arts professor and I vaguely remember his scent – I caught a whiff of two other very familiar scents that I could not possibly mistake or forget.  James?  Lily?  Is that really you?”
“Ready?”
“Cool,” Ryan said with a smile.  “Justin’s parents are meeting us at Cromwell Hall, too, so I guess you two won’t be the only ones meeting the parents.”
"I know it's unusual, John," Dumbledore said, as he motioned to the chair in front of his desk, waiting for the wandmaker to sit down before he continued.  "However, there are four people at Hogwarts who need new wands and due to their special circumstances I thought it unwise for them to come to your store during normal business hours."
The rest of the trip to the castle was spent in relative silence.  After several minutes, the carriage stopped, signaling that they'd arrived.  Charles opened the door and stepped out before helping Professor Byrne out of the carriage, followed by Ryan and Nicolas. They were greeted by a woman wearing emerald green robes standing on the front steps, and Charles smiled, instantly recognizing Professor McGonagall.
“Why can’t they be wrapped?”  Aarik asked, confused.  “And what do you mean they weren’t bought in a store?  Draco you didn’t steal them did you?”
Later the next day at dinner in the Great Hall, Dumbledore stood and called for silence.
“Well, Ron, you have nobody to blame but yourself,” Hermione said.  “You created the distance with your own stubbornness.”
“Yes, that’s right,” confirmed Harry.
“Oh, okay,” Draco said.  “For a moment there I thought you meant something else.”
"You might want to rethink that," Oliver mumbled, but loud enough that Charles heard it.
"I don't know what to say," Ollivander said after several moments of silence.
Head Boy and Captain of the Slytherin Team
“Hey Matt,” Ryan said, “Hey Oliver.  What do you mean it’s a different room?”
Without saying a word to the Dursleys, Harry began to clear the dishes as quickly as he could. The Dursleys retreated to the living room to relax after dinner as Harry began the task of washing the dishes. Half an hour later, Harry was finished with the dishes, so he took the single dinner roll and the single cold slice of roast beef that was left from dinner and used it to make a small sandwich. It wasn't a very satisfying meal by any means, especially considering that he'd missed breakfast and lunch because he didn't finish his chores on time during the day, but Harry was used to not getting fed much by the Dursleys. Harry didn't starve to death, however, because his friend Ron's mother, Molly Weasley, was always sending packages of food along with the frequent letters that Ron and his brothers sent over the summer.
Oliver nodded and then asked, "How long were you standing there under that cloak?"
But a new hope is about to dawn.
While watching the tree go from beautiful flowering tree to bearing a fruit in a matter of minutes might be interesting, Draco failed to see what the big deal was.  Obviously, the tree was blessed with great magic, but he did not yet know what was so special about it.
"That's cool," Harry said. "What about you Nicolas?"
"Please show them in, Barin," Charles said as he relaxed.
“Malfoy had it coming to him,” Damien answered.
“Fine!”  Ron shouted as he stomped up the stairs to the boys’ dormitories.  Slamming the door behind him, Ron balled up his fists and thought, “This is all the slimy Slytherin git Malfoy’s fault.  I swear I’ll get back at him for breaking Hermione and I up.  I don’t know how, but I’m going to make him wish he’d never been born.”
"It's one of the American wizarding schools," Ryan answered.
As Ryan, Nicolas, Kevin, and Hermione moved into their new seats, Bill moved back to the front of the room and placed his hand on the first workstation, across the aisle from Susan and Mandy, and said, “Daphne Greengrass and Ernie MacMillan.”
After Valen left, Albus looked up towards the doors to his office and muttered, “Hmm, interesting; very interesting indeed,” before he went back to his paperwork.
print an apology to the heirs for revealing the details of their personal lives.  The populace of the Wizarding world was also told that the portraits of the Founders had been found and that it wasn’t against the rules for Professor Weasley to be dating Nicolas, as they were both consenting adults.
Well, someone is coming, so I should stop writing now. The last thing I want is for anyone to be reading all of my personal thoughts.
“Potter, Harry,” McGonagall called and Harry walked over to McGonagall.
“Harry” Hermione called, peeking through Mr Weasley’s office door. “The floo’s been connected, come on before Molly starts serving dinner.”
“Those were my memories,” she explained. “They were all the memories I have of seeing dark or dangerous magic, that’s what I was trying to protect you from.” Hermione looked at her Mum with such a look of pleading it made Harry want to sob.
“I would of wanted you to come to us!” Mr Granger bellowed, spittle flying everywhere and his face going such a deep shade of beetroot, even Uncle Vernon would have been impressed. “We could of helped you, protected you, you silly girl. THAT’S OUR JOB!!!!”
“Draco Malfoy, Lord of the gibbering pissers!”
Harry looked around in confusion for a second totally at a loss as to what Ron could be on about. But then he saw it and he had to stifle a laugh at how obvious it was, of course Ron had thought that the clunky padded headwear a good sized portion of the younger Muggle travelers were wearing were earmuffs. “Those are head-phones Ron, they plug into a Walkman, a kind of mechanical box you can play music on whilst you travel. Muggles use them for entertainment”.
The only real peace Harry got was in the brief frenzied games of Quidditch that happened most nights in the Burrows garden just before the sun went down. The games were never particularly well structured as they rarely had enough people to have a full fourteen-person game. Mostly they were merely chasers games of four on four at the most, or else just a mêlée, every person for themselves. The games had started as a distraction from the pressing silence that often arose in the later hours of the day when the housework was finished and peoples minds started to wonder down dark paths. Flying gave everyone a chance to put their feelings aside for a while, caught up in the adrenalin high of the wind in their hair and the turn of their stomachs as the ground dropped away. The games would often start around five-thirty and would continue until Mrs Weasley and whoever was helping her had finished cooking and dinner would start.
Dean looked at Harry for a while; his face far more serious than the boy Harry had grown up with.
Finally about half an hour later Mrs Grangers rather pleasant sugar-plumb pink Simularéé came flying out the front door of the Grangers home and Gobhar pronounced the house safe to enter.
It had been a tense time for Hermione as it had taken several weeks to locate her parents, even with the help of the Australian Bureau of Magical Policies. Not only that but extended memory charms were considered highly dangerous as they could become difficult to reverse, especially if the person whose memory had been altered was reticent to regain the knowledge that had been taken. After weeks of hunting and almost a month of work carefully restoring the Grangers memories, they had finally closed their small sweet shop in Sydney and were ready to move back to the UK and resume their old lives. Hermione had written to Harry and Ron a few days ago asking if they could meet her and her parents at the airport. Mr and Mrs Granger had apparently not been thrilled that their daughter had written herself out of their lives without their consent and there had been a strain in the family’s relationship because of it. Hermione wanted Ron and Harry to be there to help her explain to her parents exactly why she had felt she had to do it; she thought they might be able to hear it better if it came from someone other than herself.
There was silence for a long time after Hermione had finished her story. Ron was holding Hermione’s hand so hard his fingers had turned white. Harry on the other hand felt surprisingly numb. He’d never heard it all laid out like that before, it sounded like some giant epic fantasy story. Full of Heroes and Villains hell there was even a Dragon. Only it wasn’t a story, it was Harry’s life and it hadn’t been exciting or thrilling like a fantasy should be, it had been scary and bloody and horrible. It was funny thought Harry, when you listened to a story full of adventure and fighting, it could sound all amazing and exciting in your head. But if you ever tried to live that life you’d soon discover it was anything but.
“As for Hermione’s involvement, I’m afraid that has a lot to do with me Mr and Mrs Granger. You see there was a prophecy that said that only I could kill Lord Voldemort and stop the war, unfortunately Voldemort had used Dark magic to make himself very hard to kill and there were a number of dark artifacts I needed to destroy in order to finally defeat him. I will not lie to you. What I had to do was very dangerous. Quite frankly if I’d tried to do it alone, as I’d intended to, I would be dead and Voldemort would still be in power. However being my best friends and knowing what was at stake, both Ron and Hermione decided to help me. I know I shouldn’t of let them come with me and I’m truly sorry for putting your daughter in danger.”
“He is also charged” the spider like attorney continued. Glaring now, directly at Malfoy, his arms folded over his narrow chest. “Of harbouring and abetting the Azkaban escapees from both the ninety-six and ninety-seven breakouts, the Werewolf Fenrir Greyback and You Know Who himself. However his final and most reprehensible crime is that of bearing The Dark Mark, marking him incontrovertibly as a member of the self named terror group The Death Eaters.”
“Alright, Please can we sit down?” he asked gesturing towards the sofa and seats.
Hermione’s expression shifted to a relieved smile as soon as her eyes landed on the two boys. Giving a small wave she murmured something to her parents and they started to head over.
Harry listened to the conversation as it continued to develop. It soon moved off the topic of the Malfoy’s and the trials, onto more mundane subjects. Harry however kept quiet throughout the remainder of breakfast. Cool grey eyes, full of fear and self-doubt taking his thoughts down to those dark places where he spent so much of his time these days.
Harry glanced at Hermione. She really didn’t want her parents to know what she had gone through. He took a second to figure out what to say, then looked at Hermione’s Parents and started speaking.
It took a long time for Harry to respond, not sure how to explain his thoughts.
“She is still my sister Harry. She made the wrong choices; she holds awful beliefs and no doubt has done some dreadful things. But if your asking me if I want her to go to Azkaban? No I can’t find it in myself to want that… I’ve lost too much family to this war already. I won’t loose any more, even if that family wants nothing to do with me.”
“And that’s what I haven’t told you” she finished rather lamely.
Hope you liked it, so just an FYI I'm writing the next chapter at the moment and hoping to get it up before the end of the week. It's going to be a seriously long one though so prepare for a camp out. thats all XX
“I had to, if I hadn’t the Death Eaters would still of found and killed me… and they wouldn’t of stopped there. They would of kept on killing until they had wiped out or enslaved everyone else, include the both of you.” Hermione replied looking down at her shoes and biting her bottom lip.
Harry looked over at Hermione, her eyes were still glistening, but the tears were no longer flowing down her face in great rivers. He was still worried that he’d said too much or the wrong thing, but at least she and her parents were talking now. They weren’t ready to walk away from each other anymore. Hermione looked back at Harry and gave him a small smile.
“That’s the gist of it yes, it’s supposed to help the bench make their decision. I still think we should be taking more from the Muggle system. Not having a randomly selected jury strikes me as a tad elitist, but I’ve yet to convince Kingsley.” Hermione sighed.
Ten minutes later the car pulled to a stop and turned off its engine.
“Is that a muggle book?” Harry asked noticing the picture didn’t move.
A black Ministry car was waiting for them just outside the airports entrance as they exited the building.
*   *   *
Hermione was crying now, tears covering her cheeks in a near perfect mirror of her mother, it would have been an uncanny resemblance if it weren’t such a dreadful sight.
hope you like this chapter... sorry it's starting a little dark lol.
“I’m sure it is Harry, but when you know it can do all that as well.” Mrs Granger still did not look convinced.
Harry was trembleing from head to toe by the time the glass shimmered, shifting back to a swirling silver mist. Ron shot up, managing to stumble to the kitchen before he throwing up all over the red terracotta tiles.
Harry sat staring at Luna a little dumfounded, he’d never really thought of it like that before. Had Draco really had a choice? Would Harry of really fought to beat Voldemort if his family were held hostage? An image of a scared shaking Draco appeared in his head.
“Stand back everyone, I don’t know where everything will go.” Hermione said giving everyone a chance to back off from the bag. Pulling out her wand Hermione pointed it at the rucksack in the centre of the room she muttered a quiet
“Is that what the scar on your arm means Hermione?” Hermione’s mother said looking at her, a crease forming between her dark brows. “I saw it before we got on the plane, ‘Mudblood’ it’s a slur about having a Muggle family isn’t it?”
“You don’t have to worry about that Mr Granger” Harry said stepping forward at last. “The Aurors just need to run some standard tests to make sure everything’s ok for you to go back to, we can explain on the way. There should be a car waiting for us by now, if you’d like to follow me”.  Harry had got rather good at talking groups of people through situations like this during the last few weeks of working with the ministry and slipped into the roll of organizing easily. Thankful for a part to play that gave him a way around the obvious tension that currently existed between Hermione and her parents, it hadn’t escaped his notice that neither Granger parent had yet to actually address their daughter directly. From the sideways glance Ron gave him as they walked towards the exit, Harry wasn’t the only one to notice the divide.
“THEN LEAVE” Mrs Granger’s screech came from nowhere, making Hermione recoil in horror. “If you don’t have the decency to treat us like human beings. If we don’t have the right to our own freedoms to choose what we can and cannot know about our own daughter. Leave and do not come back, because I for one don’t want a daughter who can’t find it within herself to respect us” Harry was horrified, gone was the quiet, sweet voiced women he had come to recognize as Hermione’s mother. The woman who stood shaking with rage before them spat cold poisonous words like a viper ready to attack. There was no doubting her.  She meant every word she said, there were no empty threats or cold manipulations going on here. She was completely, deadly serious.
Gobhar jumped at the globe as it left the building, snatching it straight out of the air. He examined it, turning it this way and that, his nose practically pressed up to the glass. After a few seconds he looked up beaming at the small group gathered curiously around him.
“No, your knotted up nine ways to Sunday. Go on, spill.” His friend pushed.
Finally, Harry produced his giant stag patronus, it galloped around the room once before it was joined by Ron’s Terrier and Hermione’s Otter. The room filled with an overpowering sense of joy as the three glimmering specters played with each other, their very presence acting as a magnifying glass for all the positive emotions that made them. The Patronas’ faded slowly, leaving ghostly after images burnt into Harry’s retina.
and contained such lyrics as
“Well keep a seat for me at Cissy’s” Andromeda whispered gazing down at Teddy with a sad smile.
Neville snoozed across from him, his head drooping close to the mouth of his mug. Ginny, and Luna sat next to him, both shearing that day’s Quibbler. Ginny gave Neville a poke, making him to jolt awake with a start, nearly spilling his tea. Hermione was curled up on the faded old armchair that sat in the corner. Her nose berried in a book on thermal conditioning charms, Crookshanks in her lap, purring softly. Ron was on Harry’s left his feet on the table as he scanned yesterday’s Prophet for the Quidditch scores.
“We were all young when the war started Luna” Harry said heatedly. “Doesn’t mean we all became Death Eaters and let murderers into a school full of children.”
There was a quite ‘bing’ and a cool voice announced “Ministry Atrium. Exit here for floo network, canteen, wand assessment centre and greater London.
“Gobhar” Ramshorn admonished.
“So yeah I get it. Malfoy was a wanker, doesn’t mean he deserves to be treated like shit.”
Snorting in response Harry replied “No, but I doubt I’ll loos any pieces for a few moves.”
“Mr Potta! Mr Potta, whotch ya fink of the sentencin’?”
“Of course they have, it’s just that you’re not always in a situation you can carry a book around in. Besides it’s not surprising that they’re often more interested in music. From what I’ve seen Muggle music is a lot more varied and there are lot more bands to choose from than in the Wizarding world.” Harry replied with a touch of humour, remembering Celestina Warbeck’s latest single which was a hideously soppy love song titled
Adrian Pucey
At noon, Adrian walked out onto the pitch to see who had all come to tryout for the team.  For some reason, he really wasn’t the least bit surprised by the low turnout.  Of the roughly 200 second-year and older Slytherins, only 10 showed up to tryout.  Scanning over them, Adrian quickly noticed first year Lane Waters among the hopefuls.
Harry Potter and the Return of the Heirs
Ryan picked up the fallen letter and read:
“Ryan, there’s an old Muggle saying,” Justin said. “Seeing is believing. Perhaps we should just take them to Rowena’s quarters. They’ll have no choice but to believe you then.”
“Technically, you are though.”
Draco had just finished getting dressed when there was a knock on his door and the kindly voice of Narcissa Malfoy asked, "Draco, darling, are you awake?"
Harry snuck as quietly as possible to where Draco and Susan were patrolling.  Finding them and noting that there was nobody else in the vicinity, he decided to make himself known.
“Yes, Justin,” Rowena answered, “it’s known as Simultaneous Casting, however, it usually isn’t taught until the last semester of seventh year Charms.  I can teach you how to do it now though and I assure you that I am qualified, because not only am I one of this school’s founders and one of the most powerful witches of my age, I was also this school’s first Charms professor, so I know what I’m talking about.”
“I don’t know about the other group, but the students in my group are with me in Madame Rosemerta’s office.  The professors are outside helping to defend the town.”
“Sirius is in the Seventh Hell?”  Harry asked.
Looking at Lily, Ollivander said, "Let's see, Lily Potter - your last wand was willow, 10 1/4 inches, swishy, with the heartstring from a Hungarian Horntail, correct?"
“Um, Harry, Hermione, can we talk?”  Ron asked.
"Don't you dare tell me how to raise my son!"  Narcissa screamed, her anger making her forget that fighting with her armed, Death Eater-husband might not be the best idea, especially considering that she was unarmed and only capable of performing a handful of simple spells without her wand.
“I applaud you on expelling Mr. Nott, Albus,” Salazar said, “but that is simply not enough.  It’s abhorrent and completely unacceptable to me that a member of my house would use the Cruciatus Curse against anyone, let alone one of their housemates!  So, Slytherins you have Mr. Nott to thank for this,” at this point Salazar yelled so loud that the people in Hogsmeade could probably hear him, “1000 POINTS FROM SLYTHERIN!”
Michael stared angrily at Adrian for a minute longer before he stalked off.  Damien scowled darkly and said, “Watch your back, Pucey.”
“Why is that, Ryan?”  Corelian asked.
Adrian sat down across from Blaise and Draco and waited a few minutes for their eyes to glaze over, signifying that the potion had kicked in.  When it did, Adrian asked, “Draco, are you gay?”
“The attack has been lifted,” McGonagall said.  “Thankfully, someone got word to Professor Dumbledore and reinforcements arrived.”
Nick nodded and after gathering quill, ink, and parchment, he sat down and began to copy the spell out of Salazar’s book.
"You know Harry," Hermione said, "it's really good to see you so engrossed in a book for once. Although, I'm sure there are much more interesting things you could be reading than a book of spells meant to embarrass people and get revenge."
Scrimgeour watched in silence as one by one, more people appeared in the room.  This time, he recognized them: Professor Dumbledore, Barnabus Cuffe, Percy Weasley, Mr. Ollivander, Madam Rosmerta, Kingsley Shacklebolt, Madam Puddifoot, and the man that Scrimgeour vaguely recognized as the bartender of the Hog’s Head Inn.
“What was the new punishment?”
“Please, for the love of Merlin, stop calling me Ced!”  Cedric exclaimed.  “I’ve always hated that nickname with a passion.  I prefer to be called Cedric or Rick.”
“Well, it is your name isn’t it?”
Harry remained silent for a few moments as he took in the information, before he suddenly had a thought and asked, “Wait a minute, if my name really is Aarik then why are my Hogwarts letters addressed to Harry Potter?”
“I don’t know if he will this time,” Draco said.  “As far as he’s concerned you’ve just made friends with the enemy.”
“All right then, Aarik.  You can call me Blaise, then.  So, back to my question, what brings you here, Aarik?”
The four prefects did as Ryan asked and followed Harry and him through the door into Rowena’s quarters, as the door closed behind them.  Motioning towards the fireplace, Ryan said, “May I introduce, my however many times great-grandmother, Rowena Ravenclaw.”
Draco bowed slightly and said, "Yes, my Lord," before he and the people he just saved from death followed the guard out of the palace.  When they arrived outside, Draco saw a large black coach, pulled by six black horses.  A solitary driver sat atop the driver’s seat and Draco couldn't help but notice that he had no head.  The driver turned to the group and spoke, "Where is it that you wish to go?"
*	*	*
“Of course, Mistress,” Valen said.  “There isn’t much to report since I made my last report, but there have been a few developments.”
“Fine with me,” the boy said with a smile.
Noticing Draco sitting in the office, Aarik ran over and flung his arms around the blond, “Draco where have you been?  I’ve been worried sick about you,” Aarik would have mentioned not being able to find Draco on his map, but as he didn’t want everyone to know about it, he said, “Alaric and the founders were all over the castle looking for you and they said they couldn’t find you anywhere.”
“Rowena, my dear,” Godric said, “what in Merlin’s name has you so upset?”
"Oh my, that poor boy," McGonagall said. "It's sad to think of one so young having the Cruciatus cast on him, but even worse for a child to have to witness their own mother's murder, especially when their father is the murderer."
