If Voldemort had just been gone, dead and dust, no one would be happier than Harry. He's lost enough people to that maniac to even want to consider another war. Especially since Voldemort seems to be
There should be a world outside the Manor and its gardens… But it’s not one Draco knows. Not anymore. He’s starting to wonder if he ever knew it at all. Perhaps his belief that he’s ever known is a delusion, something he clings to because he’s afraid.
Harry’s palm turns sweaty as it grips his wand firmly and he has to resist the urge to wipe his hand off on his trousers. He cannot risk letting go off his wand, he has to be prepared. He has to make sure that no one can sneak up on them.
Maybe… Maybe Harry, Granger, and Weasley’s lease is running out and they’ve decided to… To not get another apartment together and so Harry’s forced to find another friend to share an apartment with? Maybe Granger and Weasley are planning to start popping out the next generation of way-too-many Weasleys and need a house!
regardless of his sexuality. Ron just looks confused and asks him if that's a big thing with muggles.
"I… I wanted to surprise you. When Ginny came to me and Ron and Hermione and asked if she and Padma—one of the Patil twins from school, you know? They're dating… Anyway, she and Padma wanted to move in because they want to live together, but they can't really afford anything on their own and Ginny's going spare in the Burrow."
“Well! Thank you very much, Mrs Malfoy.” Granger sounds genuinely thrilled, and Draco can only assume that she’s smiling. Possibly at the thought of having the run of Malfoy Manor’s library. He doesn’t think anyone who went to Hogwarts at the same time she did has missed how much she enjoys books.
It's likely best for Draco to assuage Potter's worries before he even voices them directly to Draco. The sooner he can get Potter out of his apartment, the better.
“I did it!” Draco's voice is no more than a whisper in volume, but he punches out of him like a yell.
Parkinson gives her a look, but nods, and they all set off together. Hermione and Parkinson head up the front, while Zabini falls back on step with Ron.
He’s kept this whole thing secret from his friends and now they don’t know and he needs their support but he… He doesn’t want to admit what’s happened. It’s just too embarrassing to admit that he was tricked by Harry Bloody Potter of all people. That he was the side-piece. That he was stupid enough to keep it secret because he thought it sounded logical at the time…
They sneak into Malfoy Manor under the cover of night, even though Draco reassures Harry that there is no chance that any Death Eaters are squatting there. In the end, he agrees with Harry that it's for the best that they're as careful as they possibly can be.
Draco doesn't say anything, he just continues to look absolutely furious. He turns his head away from Harry and pulls away when Harry generally tries to touch his shoulder.
he felt after ending their relationship… He doesn’t want to consider how he’d feel if they broke up in the future.
He is honest in his letters, more honest than he can bear to be when he looks at all of them. He tells them all of the truth, what he loves, what he’s hated, how much he will miss them, and the best things he’s done with them in his life.
Daphne, as the other Perfect of their year, just gave him a tired look and went back to her book. She never did like getting involved in the constant drama going on at Hogwarts. Millicent had clasped him on the back and laughed, and Blaise had shared some of the expensive chocolates his mother sent him.
He looks down his nose at Harry the way he always does, and Harry finds himself flush with anger, trying to restrain the urge to punch the stupid twat right in the face.
heading off to bed." Draco brushes some imaginary dust of his robes and starts to turn around so he can head out.
When they finally part, Draco starts casting healing spell after healing spell to make sure that Harry is in top shape.
Draco doesn’t stop petting Cassiopeia, though he changes from long strokes across her back to gentle scratches under her chin to keep the shaking of his hands from being obvious. So Potter is here because something happened to his Other during the Battle of Hogwarts…
“The new Potions Professor turned out to be an avid fan of the NMO according to McGonagall, Professor Binns has actually passed on to the other side and no longer remains as a ghost on the grounds, and finally, Sybill Trelawney was forced to leave the school after she started claiming that the NMO are correct and that they would win.”
Harry starts to sputter in surprise. They've been agonizing about this for weeks, and somehow Draco hasn't noticed? He hasn't been listening to them at all?
Draco really has no idea why Potter decided to drag him along, and he wishes he could just leave now. He needs to contact his father as quickly as possible to let him know that he’s caught Potter and stopped him from doing something stupid and foolhardy.
If he would have had any chance of taking his N.E.W.T.s, he probably would be a bit more put out about it, but as it is… Well, he’s got nothing that he
"I… I understand if you don't trust what I say, because I've realised what it has sounded like for you, but… You parents ordered two Portkeys, and Ginny and some others—including your parents—are ready to come over as soon as I send a signal… If you need Ginny to back me up."
in particular... But the small furry creature is Cassiopeia, and Cassiopeia is sleeping on the pillow next to his, as it always does.
All alone in this white, empty room he doesn’t recognise. It smells… clean. Unlived in. Clean and as if someone has taken great pains to make sure it doesn’t smell of anything at all.
He doesn't even know why he's thinking about these things now. There hopefully reaching a solution to all this, hopefully saving the world right here and now.
Clearly he's still annoyed that he didn't get to come along to the Ministry, and that they instead had to send a message his way so he could come to them afterwards.
They mostly spend their time at home in Draco’s apartment, since Harry shares his with Granger and Weasley. It’s just a greater risk to spend their time there, when anyone could walk in on them at any time, unlike Draco's apartment, which is warded and won’t even let his parents in unannounced.
“I wish I had asked. I didn't realise that... that it might be something like depression, not until I talked to my therapist about it later. In part, anyway. Some of it was just me being a shitty boyfriend, according to Parkinson at least.”
This time around, they are taking no chances when it comes to their base of operations. Hermione is the Secret Keeper, and even besides that, they have additional warding as well as the cave system itself. This time they won't lose it, not like with Grimmauld Place. It is especially important since it's not just a base of operations; it's a safe house and a place where they keep many of their non-combatants and children. It needs to stay safe. Losing the Cavern, as they call it, would be devastating. Not just because of the lives lost when it comes to combatants, but also because of the children who will no doubt die in the struggle.
He focuses on keeping his breathing steady and holding the Prophet in front of his face without it rustling too much from his shaking hands. He swallows and tries to not immediately pull out his wand to cast some sort of silencing spell.
It's almost embarrassing at this point, but Harry can't help himself. He hasn't ever really been that close to another person as when Malfoy pressed him against that wall and he later returned the favour… not even when Cho kisses him.
But he doesn’t know why he’s like this now. He doesn’t know or understand why he cannot remember words or how to speak, he doesn’t know why he sleeps and sleeps, or walks the halls of the Manor… Why he can barely taste anything… Why colour has disappeared from his life.
Draco knows from experience that Father is always much easier to deal with after he’s had some time to eat chocolate, drink some alcohol, and pace around monologuing for a while. It lets him get his flair for the dramatics out and redirected into arguing with himself instead of other people. Besides, that way, Father won't have any sort of hysterics to try and "save" Draco from Harry either... And it will give Mother some time to come to terms with things
He hadn’t realised how bad it had gotten until now that the oppressive feeling of the darkness is gone. Now that he feels like he can
"Somehow I remember him as being smarter than this," Weasley mutters, probably in an attempted whisper.
“The Malfoy Manor gardens actually used to be taken care of by a goblin couple who chose gardening for their passion. Anyway, since goblins can choose any passion they want, some of them have chosen smithy, of course. So there really is nothing that can compare to a goblin made sword for example, simply because goblins live for so long and dedicate their lives to perfecting their craft.”
be able to throw Malfoy off, because if there's something that’s abundantly clear to Harry right now, it’s that somehow he weighs more than Malfoy does, because Malfoy is super skinny.
“Are you alright? You didn’t get hurt, did you?” Draco’s voice is soft, the way it only ever is when Harry’s upset and what he’s upset about
No matter if Malfoy's been watching out for them this year—which is super weird—Ron still hasn't forgiven him for the previous for years. More than that, he's
He's got the date, time, and place all planned and ready (Draco's favourite restaurant, tomorrow, right after dinner but before dessert).
“I figured we all knew what we were planning to do, I just didn't know why we were all hanging out here for so long. I suppose I expected that this was all part of the plan.”
If this is all there is to it, if it’s this simple and this innocent… Why would Harry have refused to tell Draco? Deflected away from it?
“Your patrons send their orders to you personally rather than the company owl box?” Father raises a single eyebrow, and Draco can tell that he’s a bit disappointed. Probably doesn’t like the idea of Draco being that disorganised.
a few things that can destroy just about anything." Draco puts his nose in the air. "They're that type of dark magic that only very few things can withstand naturally, the kind that unless you're casting protection charms against them
Before either of them can do anything else, suddenly the locket starts to vibrate and shadowy figures start to rise from it.
They're discussing the situation in the wider tactical group, not just the core leader group. They need more people to discuss this before they make a decision after all. That's when Neville brings up a plan but Harry wouldn't have thought of in a million years.
“Hey Umbridge! What was that about not telling lies?” Dean’s holler goes above all of the noise, and the Great Hall descends into silence.
He wonders if they're happy that he knows a name. If they think that perhaps he will know more names now that he knows one?
“We want to keep you here for a few days to keep you under observation, just to make sure that you won’t suffer any further negative effects. We’ll be running some tests as well, just to make sure.” Healer Binns gives Draco a gentle smile, and then she nods her goodbyes to his parents and leaves the room with Nurse Malbrook at her heels.
at ‘for the rest of our lives’, in which case we really should go into it with similar expectations regarding children, shouldn’t we?”
Last Harry said, he was still living with Weasley and Granger and he hasn’t mentioned any renovation plans of Grimmauld Place at all. This must be a mistake, Draco must be misunderstanding something.
Weasley mutters something, but Granger just elbows him in the side. If there’s something Draco hasn’t looked forward to regarding the idea of coming clean, it’s spending time with Weasley as a consequence.
A few months earlier, and it would have been everything Draco could have ever wished for. But it's too late now. He just wants to not miss Potter anymore, he wants to forget about anything they ever were together. It's just better that way.
Harry nods, relief spreading through his chest, but he’s also left feeling exhausted. He’s been so stressed and worried that he’s tied himself up in knots imagining the worst possible outcome.
you talking about before you dragged me in here?” he says and takes a sip of his drink, revelling in the burn and the smoke. It’s a good distraction.
in convincing Madame Maxime—she didn’t seem the type to be overly concerned with such things when Draco met her during his fourth year at Hogwarts—but he supposes that the Malfoy family’s standing in France has never suffered, and shouldn’t even be much worse off here in Britain
"You mentioned the Spoken Name of the God of the Stars... I'm afraid I don't know what 'stars' are... Could you perhaps tell me?" His face is open and curious, and seems entirely sincere.
“Are you here to look at the library?” Draco says, still not opening his eyes and keeping most of his attention on the softness of Cassiopeia’s fur.
make Harry feel better about it, even though it wasn't the main thing he was dealing with. The Dursleys have always been... As they are, about things they consider different. And considering Dudley's snide remark about Cedric...
there’s context he’s missing, if there’s an innocent explanation to what he overheard from Ginny Weasley’s conversation with “Dean” and “Seamus” in the Leaky, then perhaps he’ll find out now. He can always hope…
Draco moves in closer, stroking his fingers up Harry's chest and rests them on his shoulders, thumbs stroking the sides of his neck. Harry's arms immediately encircle Draco, and he has to suppress a shiver at the feeling of Harry's big and warm hands spreading over his back and pulling him in close against his body.
On and on and on it goes, the only sound in the apartment aside from Draco's own breathing. It's almost comforting to hear that consistent sound. To know that time actually is passing, that he’s not entirely lost inside his mind.
stringent. We’ve always known the importance of fresh blood, thus we’ve always accepted magical spouses with magical parents, pureblood or not.”
who talks now. Perhaps he shouldn’t be surprised that Potter didn’t come alone. And it seems like Potter still needs her to talk for him. How very typical.
Harry smiles at that; it's a bit of an understatement. You don't become the Head of the Spell Damage department at age twenty-five if you're not
Draco finds that he both is and isn’t surprised that his parents would be willing to help Potter out. But it is what it is.
“Mr. Malfoy gave us permission to share some information with you, though you’re technically not family—”
His two best friends have left him, and he doesn't know what to do without them. They've been with him the entire time, and he can't imagine going on without them by his side.
likes how much he wants to hear the stories of the gods. She often finds herself next to him by Old Tobias, listening to him tell the tales of the gods—from the smaller stories like the Birth of the Stars, to larger like the Battle of the Heavens.
“Nope,” Weasel says, and rudely grabs Draco by the upper arm. “You’re coming with us. And don’t think I didn’t hear that little crack about us being
“We'll need to be careful going back, of course, but I don't see why we can't. It's a good Next Step, and who knows, maybe they found something out while they were gone.” Draco is really trying to be optimistic, and it makes Harry smile.
"Draco! Draco, Draco, Draco..." The God of the Sun murmurs the name as if he were reciting a prayer, holding Draco as close to him as he possibly could.
Harry watches as Draco performs some quite frankly amazing-looking feats of magic, and then a door appears.
“I lost my Other…” he murmurs, casting his gaze down to Cassiopeia’s curled-up form. “Everything is… It's just grey now.”
get inside without his permission, but..." Draco shrugs one shoulder elegantly. “I've learned how to break in.”
It always makes Harry's head hurt, so he just pushes the thought away and decides to ignore it again.
"How about... Draco? Like the Spoken Name of the God of the Stars?" She glances at Hana. "Seems appropriate, doesn't it?"
His father's big hand strokes back his hair, and his mother gently kisses the back of his hand. They don't speak anything. They just look at him.
But pride and self-preservation demanded he cut his losses and leave. How could he ever hope to find someone and have a future, have
His parents have names. He knows this. But he... he doesn't know what they are. His mind is empty and blank, there's nothing there... No memories to draw from. Nothing that could help him.
Malfoy is really pretty, and it's not like anything's going to come from it anyway. He can just enjoy the dreams for what they are: wet dreams about a good-looking bloke Harry would much rather punch than snog in real life, but will happily wank over in a dream.
When he wanders, the small furry creature wanders with him. Until it wants him to carry it, then it lets out loud angry noises.
Quite unfortunate really; Draco quite likes the Chateau. And France for that matter. He could transfer to Beauxbatons for his last two years and they could just stay out of this whole war thing entirely.
Hana hums softly. "Well, I'd need to speak to the boss, but I do believe we might have an opening here at the tavern...
Hermione gives him a small smile. "Well, I'm glad you told us, Harry. But ehm, is there a specific reason you've thought of this right now?"
Pansy pushes him down into a booth and heads off to the bar, leaving Draco to sit by the table alone.
She's heard the descriptions, and she's certain he's most handsome! She's seen some paintings and depictions of him, and if it wasn't so silly, she'd fancy herself in love with him.
Draco feels like a petulant child, but it's the truth. Potter decided that Draco wasn't any of his business anymore, so he shouldn't be here and trying to make it his business.
When Adriana finally gets out of kitchen duty, she realises that the man is still sitting in the same seat. He looks almost like a marble statue, and she finds herself staring again.
“Why the hell should we go to Malfoy Manor?” Harry almost wants to strangle Draco. He talks so much and says so little.
It feels as if it cannot possibly be true. Draco resigned himself to the reality that he would die before he turned twenty-three, he can’t just turn this around in his head so quickly.
The nurse heads  over to him immediately, brushing his dark hair out of his face despite the rest of it being in disarray—Draco can only guess what his own hair might look like right now. Soon he’s leaning over Draco with a kind smile.
Time continues to pass. Draco wishes he could do something different, sometimes… But there isn’t really anything else for him in this world. There’s him, there’s Cassiopeia, there’s Mother, and there’s Father. The only things that exist are all of them, in this large Manor.
She gives Crookshanks a pat on the head as they stand up and tells him to stay in the compartment and wait for them. Like all cats everywhere, Crookshanks doesn't reply. He
is simple enough to control. Not the Basilisk itself, of course. You have to be a Parseltongue for that, which I know you are, but still. There is no guarantee that the Basilisk would listen to you even though you’re capable of talking to it, so we really shouldn't be taking chances with that kind of thing. Not that I even know where we would find a Basilisk in the first place. You can't even
He watches his eyes grow huge as he looks at the letter, reading it again and again, to make sure it’s not a fabrication.
“W R U…” As he reads it out loud, some of it becomes clear to Harry. “Wait, the last two could be ‘are you’, but what about the W?”
when you thought I’d talked about us with my friends! And then I find out through overhearing something that you’re moving in with someone you’ve been in a relationship
Unwilling to betray his lover, but unwilling to sacrifice his parents, his love led the God of the Stars to a single desperate act: he used his Ancient Name to shield his parents and left himself vulnerable before the God Wisher.
idea to have a Very Secret Meeting with a lot of students in the Hog's Head." Draco only rolls his eyes. No one
But he has his wand now, he can use his magic again. So he gently starts to cast smaller spells: balls of light for Cassiopeia to hunt, fetching books from the shelf without having to get up, making Mipsy’s muffins dance across the table to make his parents laugh during dinner.
He’s stupidly been considering talking with Harry about possibly telling everyone that they’re in a relationship. Finally bringing it out of the shadows and into the light, now that he was sure that they were good enough together to handle the pressure. Now that he was sure that what they could have was
“I’m sorry too, Draco.” Harry presses his lips to Draco’s hair. “I just… I wanted to surprise you and…”
Ron frowns as he looks down at Crookshanks who's twinning around Hermione's legs. The two of them still don't really… get along, but he's also sort of grateful to the big dumb cat.
There are sharp intakes of breath from everyone else in the room, sharp enough that it causes Cassiopeia to become alert, her head shooting up and her ears twitching back and forth to try and assess the danger.
"And there's more of us than there are of you, Malfoy. By far." Weasley's expression is gleeful, and Draco would quite like to punch it. It may be unrefined, but sometimes it's just worth it.
He wonders what it was that finally made him remember, what it was that finally caused it all to come back to him.
The lines have shifted, and Harry finds himself allied with people he never would have expected. Of course, it's been enough years since the war that some of those relationships have changed dramatically in between. And aside from being allied with former enemies, he is, quite unfortunately and horribly, on the opposite side of people he loves and respects.
Thus it’s only in the library he keeps his eyes open, everywhere else he just… He’s not ready to deal with it yet.
“Oh no, Mr Malfoy, I’m afraid we need you to stay awake for just a bit more,” Healer Binns says as Nurse Malbrook takes the glass from Draco’s hands.
As his mother heads up the stairs, Draco just barely refrains from letting out a sigh of relief. He’s likely managed to hold them off without having to explain everything with Potter.
flares up in Draco's chest, and in a panic he turns to the closest shop—oh bloody hell it's a furniture store—and ducks inside to hide. It's completely undignified, but he just can't deal with it. Not at all. Not now.
pay it any mind when the only thing he can think of is the fact that he’s alone and has been abandoned. It’s not like there’s anyone in the room who can be bothered by the noise of it all.
"Good day," the man says, and Adriana feels her cheeks heat up at the sound of amusement in his voice.
Though he supposes that it cannot possibly be worse than what he was like when he was still at the mercy of his own Occlumency.
“Our children would still be considered pureblood, Harry. Both your parents were magical… And besides, you wouldn’t be the first halfblood spouse in the Malfoy family tree.” He gives an elegant shrug with one shoulder.
Harry flinches backwards slightly, though not enough to dislodge his grip on Malfoy’s wrists. He hadn’t even thought that Kreacher could lie to him, he can’t lie to Sirius after all and…
So, they’ve gone on secret dates, mostly in the muggle world but also wearing glamours sometimes. It’s a bit of a trade-off, Draco finds. He enjoys magical restaurants far more, possibly because it’s what he’s used to and because he enjoys being able to blithely use his magic as he pleases, but he also wants to be looking at
“My parents have Teddy, and the other healers are dealing with the injured for the moment.” He gives Harry a sly look, one full of meaning. “We have some time for ourselves.”
Draco tried to escape them, tried to avoid overhearing their conversation… Potter might go Auror on him later, so it’s for the best if he actually has something to proof that he didn’t follow them.
but every time they are forced to Apparate back to one, they lose all progress they've made in searching the city. The safe-houses are only there for them to have somewhere they
“It took us a while, but Mr Potter finally answered our owls… or rather, St. Mungo’s sent him an owl on our behalf, and he answered that one. It seems
“Harry! I was beginning to think you’d never use the mirror!” Sirius laughs and then tilts the mirror. “Say hi to Buckbeak, why don’t you!”
them. Ron and Hermione have a different one, as does Dean and Seamus, and so many others of their friends. These smaller safe-houses are different from the big ones, like Diagon Alley, Malfoy Manor, or Hogwarts.
It looks just about how Draco expected it to. Red and wood and fires and rugs and sofas. Comfortable and quaint, with none of the elegance of the Slytherin common room.
She glances out the window at the sundial in the garden and realises with a shock that she's almost late to the tavern to help mother!
Draco grins widely, and Harry can help but think that he's absolutely beautiful. Nothing suits Draco better than a smile.
“Umbridge nearly busted us there, we only got away because of that Patronus warning us… but I don’t think we should have this conversation in the middle of the common room either…” Ron mutters.
It wasn’t something he’d ever really thought he’d get to have—when the war was at its worst, Harry was quite certain he’d never make it through, and that even if he did, he’d never be happy again—but now that he has it, he wants to grab onto it with both hands and never let it go.
He's been in and out before, but now Draco realises he hasn't seen Ron in over a week. Perhaps he can't handle seeing Draco like this. Draco wouldn't blame him for it. It cannot be easy for anyone to watch him fade away like this, likely as hard as it is for him to go.
It takes about two weeks for Father to start muttering about maybe getting Draco to take his N.E.W.T.s—or their equivalents at least—in France instead.
"Harry," Adriana says immediately. "The God of the Sun is called Harry. The other two in the Golden Triad are Ron and Hermione."
lips are, and Ron’s complained about that more than a few times. Not that he really thinks about Ron's lips a lot. Or ever.
Did Draco just expect him to be that good a person? To not only forgive the horrible things he did to try and save himself and his parents, but also all the unnecessary antagonising and the ways they hurt each other during Hogwarts?
It's hard sometimes to understand what his parents are doing, or why they are doing it. Draco barely knows why
He’s not a Gryffindor, recklessly forging ahead. He’s a Slytherin, and his need to ensure he makes it
Draco watches as his father takes a seat on the sofa next to his mother and then turns to the scroll with a shrug and a frown. He has no idea what it is, but…
“Look. Harry’s a total dunce who doesn’t always think things through. But!” She raises her and Patil’s entwined hands into the air. “We were two bisexuals dating and we broke up before the war ever happened! And we’re both dating people of our own sex, currently. Well, unless you really
“Now get up you sad sack of sadness,” Draco hisses at him with a very ugly expression on his face. Harry isn't used to Draco looking anything but really pretty, these days. Even at their most dirty and dishevelled, Draco has somehow always managed to look beautiful.
It’ll be weird to not go back to the Manor after the summer, but Mother assured him that their new temporary residence will be more than adequate to tide them over until the end. Draco presumes it's the smaller summer house near the coast that’s only about two centuries old—Mother and Father are hardly going to move them to the Chateau in France. That would make things sticky for Draco with Hogwarts.
The problem is that they can't just take all of them right back to headquarters. They don't know every single healer’s actual alliance, and they can't trust that all of them are against what the NMO stands for. After all, people have made some strange decisions when it comes to which side to follow during these times.
Though he can’t help but wonder if Potter will even care in the end… After all. If your side-bit decides to be over and done with you for finding out that they are, in fact, the side-bit… Most people would likely just cut them loose. Unless they have some weird possessive “if I can’t have you no one can” type of personality, but Draco doesn’t want to think about that. Harry’s not like that.
"Not so fast!" Weasley grabs Draco by the bicep again, yanking him backwards. "Still got questions for you, Malfoy."
It is slow going, but at least Draco doesn't think about him constantly anymore. Thoughts of Potter are not the only things that weigh on his mind anymore, he even thinks about other people and other relationships he's had.
With the loss of his Ancient Name, the God of the Stars lost his eternal form and fell from the heavens, forced to walk the world in a mortal form—never ageing and never dying, but utterly without his divinity and powers—unknowing of the truth of his being.
Seeing their tears and pain is almost enough for him to want to die alone, without anyone else there to watch. Without anyone else there to be sad.
As much as he’d enjoy fucking Potter over for what he’s done, he’ll be taking this with him to the grave. Anything else is too embarrassing. To admit that he was deceived by his childhood nemesis, that he actually fell for his honeyed words... Merlin, no.
It's not that Draco thought no one would ever so much as think of getting revenge against him or his parents. Of course not. He's not an idiot.
He does understand now. He’s spent… A long time, he thinks, not understanding spoken language. But he does now, it’s as if his mind is finally starting to regain what it lost.
Potter sighs loudly. “Please come here, Draco. Let’s go inside, you can get dressed, and we can have this conversation calmly over a cup of tea. I’m sure the elves can manage to make some of your favouri—!”
He thinks his father looks scared, but even as his father starts speaking, he cannot understand it. He still cannot make sense of speaking, it is all simply noise that washes over him.
The Herder turns at the corner and starts to head their way down the corridor. There isn't much light—there never is when it's night time—but what little there is causes deep shadows in the Herder’s hood.
The idea that his parents hadn’t really fought, that instead they’d deserted the Death Eaters and started searching the castle for him was… Unthinkable.
And Draco, like Adriana, seems to enjoy hearing the same stories multiple times. He seems to be utterly uncaring of which story Old Tobias decides to tell, as long as he tells any at all.
Draco just went completely nuts, broke up with his boyfriend, and decided to book an impromptu vacation to
What's the point in dredging up the past now? Hasn't Potter moved on since long ago? He's doing so well and he's so happy after all, why would Harry want to revisit his failed relationship with Draco? It doesn't make any sense at all.
"What are you talking about, Ron? Mr Malfoy and I… We gave up. We didn't find anything." Hermione is wringing her hands together and looking like she's about to cry. Draco knows she probably hates not only admitting that she failed, but also that she admitted defeat.
, they're just going to be able to override whatever protections you’ve set up. The first is Fiendfyre; it will obliterate everything and leave nothing behind. You
They clutch as at each other as they kiss almost frantically, Slytherin locket forgotten on the floor. Now that the horcrux is gone, Harry doesn't think he's ever been less interested in that damn thing.
He reaches the entrance and swiftly casts Mufflatio. Even though he is sure that he hasn't been followed, he's still not taking any chances. He holds his wand to the bracelet he wears, and whispers the password to activate the Protean charm in it.
He hums and continues to pet Cassiopeia, and waits for the conversation to pick up again despite his interruption.
It's too big for him to think about, too terrifying in its reality, so Draco simply… puts it out of his mind and continues as if nothing is wrong at all. Anything else seems unthinkable. He cannot come to terms with the fact that he'll die before he turns twenty-three, that he'll be another name on the entirely too long list of people Harry Potter has loved and lost.
The feeling of Draco’s long fingers digging into his shoulders is grounding, and just what he needs as a gust of wind blows the smoke away just enough for Harry to see the grotesque visages of the Inferi haunting their steps.
If he can just put enough distance between them and him and Draco, then he can Side-Along Draco to somewhere safe.
He's well aware that his parents are likely losing their minds over not being able to see him. He knows that they’re likely distraught by his distance. He wonders if they find comfort in the fact that money is still being taken out of his account. Perhaps he should send them a letter, but he's just so tired. So ashamed. He doesn't know what to say.
Draco supposes he could ask, but he’s not quite feeling inclined to. It’s not like Potter owes him any answers. And Draco is hardly going to beg for any. That would be far beneath him.
somehow Malfoy got involved, so you'll be staying with me for the summer instead of with the Dursleys."
Harry pulls him in closer and they lie absolutely still, listening to the enraged shouting of the Herders below them, just breathing.
And as the stranger catches sight of him, that golden glowing aura reappears and a smile so wide Adriana would fear it would split his face appears on his lips.
Time passes. He only knows the days by how he's moved from his armchair by the window to the bed. He counts the days by when he falls into the pitch black oblivion of sleep, before the morning rays of white wakes him up once more.
"Do you know any more stories about the gods? I... I feel so curious, as if there's a part of me that's desperate to know more."
Perhaps not the Janus Thickey ward then, clearly no one would ever allow someone in a private room to have an open door. That would just lead to escape attempts.
Draco lifts one shoulder in an elegant shrug. "These stories... They seem familiar, somehow. Nostalgic... Almost comforting." He shakes his head. "Perhaps I have heard them before, in my life before I lost my memories..."
He's got the ring (specially tailored to not just Draco's sense of taste, but also to be able to serve as an heirloom going forward
Pureblood, and none of the actual purebloods hold the secrets to the Malfoy Manor wards anyway. I doubt they’re intelligent enough to figure it out even if they’ve been keepers of their own Family Wards. So it’ll be fine!”
"It's a kind of crystal that is tightly connected to life energies. Very useful for healing magic or fertility magic if someone is trying to have a baby." Draco bites his lip and looks back towards the crystal. "The larger they are the more powerful but... I've never seen one so large before. I don't know how they got it, but this explains how they've managed to create so many Inferi."
All the blinds are down, so that explains why Hermione and Parkinson were looking through a crack in the door rather than the window, but it also makes Ron feel nervous. You wouldn't pull the blinds down unless you want to be undisturbed.
and they’ve been having a laugh about how pathetic he is while going bloody apartment shopping and making plans for renovating Grimmauld Place.
It was kind of weird and sometimes even a bit uncomfortable, but it's also the best thing he's ever felt in his entire life. It was even better than the first time he flew on a broom, he thinks. If it gets any better than this he's not sure that he'll actually survive it.
Perhaps the world in his own brain, his memories and feelings and everything, was a better place for him to be. Perhaps it was a safer and kinder place for him than this new sharper reality… This reality now in which he
“I would have said we’d be having luck if Harry wasn’t so picky.” She snorts. “We’ve seen multiple nice places that
It’s just too much to deal with. Too much to accept that he will have to live with for the rest of his life.
magic for right now anyway. He has his parents and the house elves, and they can cover anything he might need while his core recovers.
Adriana shrugs her shoulders. "But they both live, don't they? The heavens and the earth survived, the God Wisher was unmade... and the God of the Sun now seeks his beloved. One day he'll find him and everything will be put to rights again. How can I
He had always imagined that revenge would have come during those first years when he sooner expected Aurors to hex him than help him. He imagined that someone would simply follow behind him, drag him into a back alley and use Diffindo or something to slit his throat or lop his head off. He expected that the Aurors would be extremely unhelpful to his parents and his murder would have gone unsolved forever.
“Oh my. Has something happened?” Her face falls into a frown and she leans forward in her seat. “Are you receiving threats, Draco? You know I don’t want you to keep things like that secret.”
“What makes you say that, Neville?” Hermione says. “Not that I would put it past him, but is there a specific reason you say that?”
He doesn't want to die and leave this lovely man behind. Draco fought so hard, did such terrible things, all to keep himself and his parents alive… he doesn't want it to end like this, not now that his death can hurt Harry, too.
and then immediately left the country… But you actually gave me a chance to tell you what I was doing that day and I blew you off.” He laughs again then, but it sounds bitter rather than amused. “I even felt bad about it at the time, because you sounded so worried… When I got that letter I felt like the hugest dick in the world.”
my friend and not just because Ron and Hermione aren't here!” Harry's heart beats so loudly in his ears that he can barely hear anything besides it. He just hopes that Draco will believe him.
He’s not sure how much longer they will need to keep their relationship secret, they have certainly proven that they work together by now… But he’s also not enthused by the idea of having to explain himself and possibly fight with the people he cares for over his relationship.
To live having lost everything he was willing to die for is much worse than anything else could possibly be. He shudders and shakes and pretends that this is not what his life has come to at this point. A wreck of a man, left behind by everyone he loves, and everything he thought he had.
potions, so of course he can do so for the benefit of the people who are willing to trust him with it.
It doesn't feel like razors, the way the strangers' do, but rather... Like a memory long forgotten. Like the gentle caress of the wind in the garden, when he walks outside.
They take a moment to just breathe, no matter how dangerous that is all things considered, and then they nod resolutely to each other. They sneak back out from the factory floor walkways and into the hallway where they first encounter a Herder. it's in this mostly isolated space that Draco cast a spell to get the coordinates to their current location.
if Hana mentions that he seems other-touched. She's always had a soft spot for the odd ones, those who do not quite fit in anywhere.
Hermione keeps giving him Looks and Ron’s starting to look kind of constipated whenever he looks at Harry now—well, when Harry’s thinking about Malfoy at least, but that sort of is all the time so...
Harry sits slumped on their bed, staring at the gleaming ring in its little box. Maybe something’s trying to tell him to give it up, that he shouldn’t do this after all.
Harry doesn't cook often, even though he's found that he likes it a lot more now, in adulthood, when he does it for himself and people he loves rather than being forced to do it for other people who he doesn't like and who definitely don't like him.
“What… What happened?” Draco isn’t sure he’s ready to hear the answer to the question at all, it’s no doubt going to be something terrible and dark and awful and he’d rather not relive it at all.
They land hard on the mattress in the run-down apartment in the middle of London which they’ve set up as a safe house. It’s warded and impenetrable except for people who carry just the right type of locket around their throats.
“Draco!” Potter hurries after Draco, but he’s not stopping. He needs to change, because he cannot handle being so exposed, both literally and figuratively, in front of Potter right now.
With how everything has panned out… He hates that he ever did. Clearly, Potter wasn’t worth not seeing his parents as often as they'd all like. Clearly it wasn't worth this distance he's put between them unwittingly. As happy as Draco has been with Harry... The devastation if his betrayal and its consequences may well break him completely.
He tries to remember days of lying in the grass, watching shapes in the clouds during the day, and the constellations in the stars during the night. He tries to remember the stories his parents told him before bedtime, tries to remember the stories whispered by the portraits as he walked past them during daytime.
He turns his head to find his parents sitting in two armchairs nearby. He wonders if they're crying.
The strangers with the razor sharp magic come back, he sees them talking with his parents in the big room with the sofas a lot. Sometimes his parents bring him in there and the strangers’ horrible magic washes over him anew.
"If we managed to reverse the effects instead, I think that's when we have a chance of saving people who have been turned. But that is going to be way riskier and have a far larger risk of us dying rather than succeeding."
"It was, yeah. But in the Great Hall, I found Malfoy. But he just turned around and sneered at me. That's when I woke up."
After they've left, his mother pulls a small piece of cloth from somewhere, and dabs it over his cheeks.
Harry clears his throat. “No… I just…” He doesn’t quite know how to get out of this one. “That’s something we should do
Of course, they’re labouring under the impression that Draco hasn’t had any sex for months, and as he’s still not ready to explain his whole failed relationship with Potter, he can’t disabuse them of the notion.
Harry’s not really paying attention to what he’s eating at breakfast, he’s too aware of the weight of the two-way mirror in his robe pocket. He decided to carry it with him just in case Sirius tries to contact him with information about what ended up happening last night after Harry and the others went to bed.
He feels a phantom twinge of pain in his hand, right where the Blood Quill has carved “I must not tell lies” into his hand over and over again. He glances down at it, mouth twisting at the sight of the scar, and he pulls his sleeve down a bit.
They lie curled together for a long time as they catch their breaths, neither of them saying anything. The few safe-houses that exist are the only places where it’s possible to
"So, he stole it from an apothecary?" Harry frowns. "Considering how careful he's been overall, that makes sense. He wouldn't want anyone to be able to figure out he'd bought these ingredients at all."
Harry chokes. He pats down his pocket, and then his other pocket and then the shirt pocket at his breast.
Draco sighs in contentment as Harry wraps his arm around his shoulder and pulls him even closer on the sofa. It’s simply… lovely.
Draco joins in, shaking his head. It wouldn’t surprise him, it’s not like his parents much like showing themselves within most of wizarding Britain’s society these days. With one of them pardoned and the other having served his time, they much prefer to spend their time with the friends they still have, and mostly outside of Britain where their family name is not so reviled.
Draco’s hand is clammy in Harry’s grip, but he cannot let it go. He cannot let them get separated. He
“To find something to destroy the Horcrux with, of course. Why else would we go anywhere? Well, besides getting out of this dreadful weather and not having to stay in a tent anymore. I mean. Those are some rather self-evident reasons for going to Malfoy Manor.”
Potter even straight up told him they should keep the whole thing secret and Draco just went along with it. Thought it made perfect sense. And of course it does, for a cheater who’s trying to ensure no one finds out about the fact that he’s having an affair.
“Draco! I have our drinks!” Pansy’s loud call pulls Draco out of his thoughts and he forces a smile on his face. He can’t tell her; he can’t let her see that he’s disturbed in the least.
There’s a brief silence as the others look at each other. The mirror in Draco’s pocked still seems to
“Are you sure, Mrs Malfoy?” Potter sounds genuinely respectful. How odd, Draco thinks, though he supposes that Potter may have warmed up to her after she saved his life. That would certainly make Draco warm up to someone.
He doesn’t have much hope for the last one, it’s not like he’s taken any N.E.W.T.s and he doubts anyone is in any hurry to offer him a job or a place in society anytime soon.
He glances up towards the teacher’s table. Professor Dumbledore’s eyes are twinkling with mirth—it’s
The problem is that if they call out for the stunned and bound Herder, and Harry still hasn't bothered to find out who it is, and they receive no reply... well that will instantly put them on their guard.
He wakes to a world that feels different. He's in bed, Cassiopeia is there... And his parents are curled around him, one of them on each side.
“Everything's such a mess... You never tolerated mess before, what's going on? You're really worrying me.”
How is it even possible that Potter is doing so well? Shouldn't he be the one who's the most traumatised from the war, out of all of them? It’s unfair.
“Oh!” Harry looks genuinely surprised. “Yeah, that’s true. I guess… I guess I just assumed that we were in it for the long-haul, you know?”
“Perhaps you would reconsider your stance on the supposed uselessness of teaching us practical skills in Defence Against the Dark Arts… Though it’s rather too late in the year, isn’t it?” Malfoy’s bored drawl echoes across the room, and when Harry looks at him, he looks entirely unafraid.
“Harry? Who’s safe?” A voice comes from whatever Potter is holding. Older, definitely an adult. Likely to be Sirius Black, then.
“He hexed me, but he… He knows what we’re doing somehow.” Harry doesn’t take his eyes off Malfoy who has turned his face away and now sticks his nose in the air, the absolute posh prat.
The God of the Sun had won, but the cost was great. The battle had nearly torn the heavens and the earth asunder, and the God of the Sun had lost one he loved so dearly.
Harry isn't really surprised; Draco has been complaining about the fact that they're wearing the Horcrux for days now. He didn't want to wear it, he didn't want any of them to wear it. He fought them on it in a way he hasn't fought with them on
And then comes a problem with how to deal with the ones who aren't on their side. They don't want to take prisoners, but allowing the NMO to have access to multiple healers is... tactically unsound as far as decisions go. There's a reason the NMO took St. Mungo’s under their control as quickly as possible, after all.
Draco just shrugs, still not looking at him. “Father told me to make sure I kept on Umbridge’s good side, and to try and make sure
Draco focuses on drinking his tea and avoids looking at anyone else in the room. He’s too embarrassed to really… Merlin, this whole situation is hateful. And the worst part is that he absolutely sort of created it himself, even if Harry is
Healer Binns nods. “You, young man, are a very gifted Occlumens. Usually that would be something to be happy about, no doubt, but in this particular case it caused us a lot of trouble.” She shakes her head. “Your Occlumency, even in its wild and disarrayed state after the accident was too good for any of the Legilimens we brought in to undo. They would have needed to brute force their way into your mind, and in your fragile state it would only have caused more harm than it would have done good.”
“You used to talk about wanting a kneazle when you were younger, and you always talked about how you would name her Cassiopeia and she would be the smartest kneazle anyone had ever seen.” She huffs out a small laugh. “But you’d
He’s not sure he’ll even manage to fall asleep at all until he knows they’re out safe… But he’ll try.
That is, if they manage to get the Herders to run outside in the first place. Of course, there is always the risk that they will have to fight their way through to the crystal. It's a worst-case scenario Harry certainly hopes won't come to pass.
Draco blinks tiredly and tries to process that. He knows that he… got good at Occlumency. He wouldn’t have survived the Carrows or the Dark Lord himself if he hadn’t, if they’d been able to see his doubts and fears. But he still didn’t expect… Something like this.
So off they go for a walk, Harry carrying the basket that’s been enchanted with a bit of wizard space to contain all of the food and blankets Draco’s house elf Mipsy had forced on them once she heard what they were planning.
“Right, well... We have no idea where the Sword of Gryffindor is and no way of getting it, so I suppose we'll just have to go to Malfoy Manor and get some Basilisk venom then.” Harry sighs.
He probably just wants to explain why Draco had been such a terrible boyfriend and why Potter had broken up with him in the first place. Merlin forbid Potter feels guilty or like the bad guy.
"I was walking through Hogwarts, but none of the portraits were moving, and there was no one else there." He pauses and starts unbuttoning his pyjama shirt. "And the corridors seemed nearly endless, until I finally reached the Great Hall."
He pulls it out and looks at the edge of it. Instead of being numbers, there are letters. He has never seen it do that before.
"I'm... I'm afraid I do not know what my name is, so I cannot give it to you. I woke up without any memories of who I am, and I have wandered for a long time seeking answers." He glances away. "I have been lucky to come upon kind people willing to give me some aid, but I have not yet found a name to be called that I feel comfortable with."
He’s sitting in the garden by the pond, watching the fish swim round and round with Cassiopeia at his side, when Mother and Father come up to him.
He feels better when he finally settles on that. There's no point in feeling weird and guilty about it, because they're just dreams.
problem isn’t exactly solvable, unlike Lucky Golden Boy Potter’s. All Potter needs to do is find someone who lost their colour vision sometime during the Battle of Hogwarts and who hasn’t… Looked at Potter… Since…
He takes to walking with his eyes closed, to navigating his way through life without opening his eyes. Feeling his way forward, letting Cassiopeia guide him…
With Cassiopeia in his arms, it is more bearable, hurts less. He focuses on the little furry creature, on Cassiopeia, and tries to ignore the pain.
Which, clearly Potter needs a babysitter. He has no sense of self-preservation at all. Horrifying, really.
All in all, Draco just feels more certain of his decision to discuss it with Harry next weekend. They’ll see each other over the week, of course, but it’s better if they have most of the day to discuss it and prepare for how they’ll do it in the end.
Still, he really needs to get it done. He just… he wants to hear Draco say “yes” so damn badly it’s driving him nuts. He’s tried to propose four times and failed every time—he hasn’t even managed to get the question out!
He'll be all alone. There'll be no one... He knows there must be something wrong with him. His parents speak, but he cannot understand them. He... his magic is gone, but his parents still have theirs. He cannot speak anymore.
Draco shakes his head. “The Black and the Lestranges, for example, are among the most extreme, Harry. That’s why they intermarried so much not just among each other, but also within their own families.” He shrugs again. “No one’s as extreme as the Gaunts, though. They intermarried with siblings and first cousins until they inbred themselves into their entire family line going extinct.”
There's a bit of shuffling as no one seems to know what to say anymore. Draco bites his lip; he wants to talk to Harry alone, but he doesn't want to ask for it. Especially since his mother still hasn't let him go—at this point he's fairly sure that she's just doing it to embarrass him.
The photo beneath the headline depicts an almost-destroyed room Harry doesn’t recognise, and several people he recognises from the graveyard are being led out of the shot by people wearing Auror uniforms.
The wide smile that spreads across Draco’s lips as his hand falls away is like the sun coming up after a long, gruelling night. Like the first drop of water in your parched throat.
It's too raw and too fresh and Draco's quite sure he'll burst into tears immediately if he looks Harry in the eyes.
“Ginny!” Granger sounds scandalised. Merlin’s beard, why are she and Weasley here too? Is this some sort of party he missed out on the invitations to?
wouldn’t they? They have refused to take any risks when it comes to him ever since the end of the war. He wonders if they’ll ever be willing to do so again.
"Well, first of all we would need a distraction. Something we need to draw all of the orders and any new theory that is in the building away from here. Just for long enough that I can sabotage the room circle and switch up the necessary runes and glyphs to reverse the effects of it." Draco bites his lip. "And then we would need to keep it safe for long enough to have an effect. I don't think we can trust that any Herders who realise what is going on wouldn't come running back to stop us. So we need to be ready to fight and protect the reverse effect from the crystal."
for your son, Lucius. Night after he night he dreams of him, naked and spread out beneath him." The Dark Lord chuckles again. "I have no doubt that if Draco put his mind to it, he could seduce Potter in a heartbeat. Seduce him, and have him too busy thinking with his nether regions to consider just what it may be Draco's asking of him."
“What do you mean by an Occlumency accident? How can you have an accident with Occlumency…?” Fear shoots down Draco’s spine as he remembers just
“Right,” Weasley says. “And there have been cases when someone has died briefly, but the healers have managed to resuscitate them, but their Other still lost colour vision… They would usually regain it again later though.”
“I'll grab some clothes for you from the... from your closet.” Potter says, his voice choked and unnatural.
The rituals to ‘reveal’ your Other are notoriously fickle and unstable, and are just as likely to be influenced by who you
and says he doesn’t blame Harry for seeing someone blond at the graveyard and in his no doubt panicked fear mistaking it for him.”
Still, the tide has turned and she and Fudge both are out of favour. At least according to Father, when he contacted Draco in the early mornings to assure Draco that they’d made it out fine. Apparently, Mother had even managed to not only gain the house elf’s favour, but also turn it against dear Aunt Bella.
makes him shiver. He doesn't want to know what he looks like. He is Draco Malfoy, he is the son of... of...
His mother enters the room and bends down to give him a kiss on his forehead. Her mouth twitches in the corners as he turns his attention to her, instead of staring at Cassiopeia's tail.
and do his research… But it’s easier to ignore the lack of colours when you’re inside in a library filled with books, than it is when you’re in a lush garden that should be a minor explosion of colour. At least when he’s in the library, he can pretend it’s just a trick of the lighting.
Draco pulls back and strokes his hands over Harry's face, pushing back his hair and pressing a kiss to his lips.
Without giving anyone any time to argue, Narcissa herds everyone out of the room. Lucius just has a dutifully placid-but-interested look on his face. Mother's taken charge far more often since the Second War ended and Father has clearly just learned to accept it and go along with it. Of course, between the two of them, Mother's made fewer bad decisions. That must surely count for something.
t ha—Oh.” She cuts herself off mid-word, which is not something Draco thinks he’s ever heard her do before.
Cassiopeia is clearly undertaking her task with great dignity and gravitas, and gracefully hops onto the counter in the kitchen, drawing Draco’s attention with a gentle meow and loud purring.
“It is indeed heavily warded," Lucius says as he strokes his chin. “So heavily warded, in fact, that only someone of the Malfoy line can step on those lands on their own. Narcissa has married into it, so she can do it, however... When it comes to bringing someone else onto the grounds... Well. It's not enough to be part of the line through marriage, you have to be of the blood itself."
“And then you suddenly want to go on a vacation? And you’re crying at night?” Pansy continues. “You’ve broken up with them, haven’t you?”
The silence that spreads is quite awkward, and Draco doesn’t know how to break it. He doesn’t know what to
"Really?" Harry gapes, hardly able to believe it. It sounds absolutely too good to be true, even though Grimmauld Place is far from a nice place to stay overall.
He can feel the attention of the Hall being on him again, and as always it chafes. He doesn't like being the center of attention, he just wants to be just another regular guy in the crowd. Just Harry. But now… He doesn't think he ever will be.
Adriana's out in the town square, seated on the fountain in its midst. From the east, framed by the midday sun, comes a tall figure. She squints against the light and puts a hand  up to shield them, desperately trying to see who it is.
He'd tried, he'd really had—even if Harry had never believed him. He'd always seemed to think that Draco was the one who had started it whenever he and Weasley got into an argument. It wasn't, it
Draco pulls out of Pansy’s arms, suddenly furious. He gets to his feet and walks away, throwing his damn class onto the ground and taking pleasure in the sound of breaking glass.
He's certain that the day will come when Potter is no longer even a bad memory. One day, the memory of Potter’s touch will no longer be like silk on his skin and razor blades in his heart instead, it will have faded like old ink on water-damaged pages. Washed away, smudged, illegible. No longer of any worth.
Mother becomes a sort of go-between, though more of the management type than the messenger one. She flits in and out between the healers at St. Mungo's, Father and Hermione in whatever library they're currently holed up in, and the Auror Department and DMLE. She also ensures that she spends most of her days with Draco—she neither wants him to be lonely, nor miss any precious little time they have left.
“So, Mr Potter, what can I help you with?” Mother sounds calm, but Draco wonders if she’s nervous. Perhaps Potter is here to demand some sort of compensation for having returned Draco’s wand to him.
If his parents go away... will the rest of the world go away too? Will Draco be alone, without anyone else except for Cassiopeia, until the day it... or he... dies? He shudders, trembles... He collapses in a small heap on the floor in the middle of one of the long sprawling corridors.
Draco is silent for a long time, and Harry almost repeats his question when Draco rolls over to his side and pulls something out of his bag.
So, two attempts at a proposal have been complete disasters, but they do say that the third time’s the charm, don’t they?
He crosses his arms across his chest and looks mulishly at everyone else by the table, as if daring them to disagree with him. Harry feels his stomach drop. He doesn't want to fight with Draco about this, but he realises this but he's going to have to.
Ugh, he could have just stayed gone and Draco would have been pleased. The man—if he can even be called
teenager." The smile on his face is horrific. "Bring him home over the winter holidays. I'll give him his mission then. And who knows, Lucius, if he performs well enough... I may even honour him with the Dark Mark."
“Your parents are worried about you. They've had a house-elf check up on you, to make sure that you are alive and well... but they can't get through your Floo themselves, so when the house-elf reported back something that worried them... I suppose they were willing to give me the Floo address in hopes that I could get through.”
There are so many things that can go wrong, and if they do… Harry doesn’t even want to think about it.
“We have no time to lose. I doubt they can find us here, but I just used a bunch of magic and I don't
They get more confirmations from other people that they will start to make their way towards the coordinates they sent, with lots of promises that they'll be careful, and then Harry and Draco start to plan. They plan their line of attack, how they're going to cause a distraction, stuffed in a cupboard under Harry's invisibility cloak and with silencing spells cast all around them.
One day... One beautiful day, Potter won't even be a terrible memory, instead, Draco will have forgotten him entirely. Draco truly is looking forward to that.
Despite the struggle he hears behind him, Harry doesn’t turn his attention away from Malfoy. Malfoy whose pale cheeks are gaining blotchy red colour and whose eyes look like they would shoot curses at him if they could.
"Be happy, Harry," Draco gasps through his tears. "Find someone who'll make you happy. That's all I want for you."
He glances at the floor, and sees the brush still move over the glyphs and runes in the circle, and swallows harshly. Draco is still working, which means that it's up to Harry to protect him.
?” Draco shakes his head. “The family line went to tatters before Voldemort would’ve been born, he can’t have been…”
Draco is sure that he'll stop missing Potter one day. He's already started to miss him less, after all.
"Drah... Coh..." He chokes on it, like he did with Cassiopeia the first time." Drah... Coh... Dray... Coh... Draco."
an Other, much less who it is. It’s not something you even talk about often, it’s all chance—though people are often drawn to their Others, and it’s not uncommon for someone to find out as they near death that their spouse, as they pass on, was their Other all along.
Cold sweat forms on the back of his neck, making a slow slide down his skin to soak into the collar of his sweater. He divides his attention between Draco in front of him, looking around the area for anyone else, and keeping his hearing on high-alert.
Perhaps it's some sort of salesman, trying to sell some amazing, new magical item that will revolutionise cleaning or something. Draco doesn't really know what Floo salesmen sell. None of them would ever dare to contact Malfoy Manor with that kind of spiel, after all.
He didn't... He never thought that it would be a problem. He hasn't really given anyone his Floo address, and he has no reason to think that Potter would even come after him. He was the one who wanted to end things after all.
Of course, as soon as he releases Draco from his magic, Draco returns the favor and soon they're both far above the Herders. In relative safety.
Of course Harry's friends live to make this whole thing as awkward as possible. Draco may just combust in his mother's arms from the sheer humiliation.
were the Gryffindor here. I'm just out to see what interesting thing made Pansy so embarrassed. She's no shrinking violet, if you know what I mean."
"Well, of course I can tell you! I can't tell you the whole story of the stars and how we lost them!" She grins widely. "It's my favourite. It gives me hope, you see... One day... One day we'll have the stars back."
Draco leaves the kitchen to head to the Floo, and Harry looks back down at the disaster on the floor. Nothing to do but vanish and scourgify everything except the ring itself. There’s no point in trying to repair the two glass bowls.
It's almost ridiculous how difficult this will be, and Harry wishes that they had more people to call in. He just wishes he could get Ron and Hermione down here... And Kingsley and the Order and everyone. But they can't. Not unless…
Draco closes his eyes. He refuses to look at Potter any longer. He barely had any interest in talking to him in the first place, and he's definitely not going to keep talking to him now that he's lying.
Parkinson coughs loudly. "We should look for them on the other end of the train! Come on!" She rushes past Ron and Zabini with Hermione hot on her heels.
The God Wisher saw himself as better, more important, and far more suited to become the King of the Gods than the God of the Sun. He wanted the power to determine and decide over the cosmos, to rule among the Gods—he wished to have no other above him.
The way Potter lights up at Draco's words is a little disturbing. It doesn't really make sense to Draco he looks so happy about it, but whatever. It's no skin off Draco's back.
They are the most common sort of god. Most of them have always been thus and never anything different. The King of the Gods is one such god; he has never been anything but a god.
He can hear Draco muttering to himself, so he's clearly working as fast as he can, but Harry still wants him to work faster. Still wishes that things went way quicker than they are. He's afraid. Even more so for Draco than for himself.
“Excellent.” Draco grins and ignores Blaise’s little dig at how much he’s been ‘working’ lately. “I’ll books us a Portkey for Sunday immediately.”
Perhaps that was foolish of him, thinking that just because the papers are eagerly following the wedding preparations without sneering about him, it means that most of the public has settled too.
They finish their meal, but before he can say anything he feels the old Dumbledore's Army coin in his pocket heat up.
“I… I do believe i need to test a few more chairs before I can make up my mind… But I’m afraid my stomach seems to be acting up a bit.” He swallows. “How long will you be open?”
"I'm sure you will be happy to hear that I have... Come across, shall we say, some information that will aid our cause immensely."
“I’m sorry.” He repeats the words, stronger this time. “I should have… I should have tried to talk to you.”
In the end, the rest of them voted him down. Harry now realizes that that was a mistake. Draco was right all along. As worried as they were about losing the Horcrux, wearing it has clearly been the wrong decision. It soured their moods and drew them closer and closer to paranoia, and now Harry doesn't know what to do with himself.
He’ll need to bring up the topic of finally revealing themselves to Harry. Maybe next week. And once they have… Well, perhaps they can go on vacation just to avoid the fallout? There's sure to be
It's really rather peculiar, and Adriana's becoming more and more certain that Draco is other-touched.
Of course, the more he thinks about it, the more obvious that becomes. Of course he feels like something is wrong, that something is
a different Harry? Though that does seem unlikely but... Maybe it's someone who's polyjuicing themselves into Harry to trick his friends? But that seems... ludicrous at best. A plan doomed to fail as all it would take is a single conversation between actual Harry and his friends to clear it up...
He knows that perhaps he should try to be optimistic, he should try to have hope. But he's not sure that he can. They fought Voldemort, and Harry thought that things were over after that. He thought that he would finally get to rest, that things in the Wizarding World had finally settled down.
And then Cassiopeia moves, sits up and butts her head under Draco’s chin, forcing his face upwards. He squeezes his eyes shut tighter, even as she continues to headbutt him and lick at his jaw with her raspy tongue, purring and purring.
“Nothing seems to be disturbed here, which is a good thing. There's a lot of dust though, and that's likely going to drive the house elves
Blaise snorts. “Not unless you’ve been shacking up with Zacharias Smith or something, if that’s it I
It would have been made to be a natural end to their relationship, no matter how sudden and shocking it would have felt to Draco. In the end, Draco would be left thinking that Harry got together with his ex after their relationship ended, and Miss Weasley would never know anything. Would never know that she’d been cheated at all.
If she's right about the fact that the NMO are planning to move a large group of healers to their headquarters, away from the locked-down St. Mungo's, then that is the perfect moment to strike to save and liberate those healers.
Not to mention, Malfoy's not going to try to touch him in real life within a million years, so what's the harm in a bit of fantasising?
Still, the idea of making himself spectacles to see in colour, despite having lost his Other, gives him something to focus his mind on.
Something shoots past them, Harry hears his friends scream, and something hits him in the back. His head spins, he staggers, and then he’s yanked to the side. He slams into a wall, his head cracking against it harshly—making the spinning and disorientation even worse.
Some days, they herd him out on the grounds. Sometimes, his father sits him down by the pond and curls around him, talking and talking.
The shards reforging themselves into a labyrinth, trapping him inside, leaving him to traverse his family home as if searching for a way out of his own head.
He just curls in on himself further, not caring that whoever that was didn’t expect him to be awake. Not that he
"I have no idea how they managed to find a Life Crystal that large," Draco says, his voice shaking almost as much as his hands which are still clutching at Harry's shoulders.
Draco nods. “If you're worrying about what the horcrux tried to scare me with... Don't. I don't want to be the same sort of friend to you that Ron and Hermione are anyway. Unless you want to kiss them too.”
Harry makes sure they crouch down—anything to make them less visible should Draco's disillusion spells fail—and kisses Draco's temple.
A small snort escapes Malfoy, and Harry is reminded of his existence. For a brief moment he considers leaving Malfoy behind, but he can’t. He can’t trust him.
Adriana nods swiftly. "That's very likely! You would have to be from very far away, I cannot even imagine how far, if you hadn't heard the stories of the gods. Perhaps there are places where they don't believe, but... I think they're rare."
Harry realises with a small start that Draco probably thinks that Harry is really disappointed about losing out on the desserts. He has no idea what the whole plan actually was.
"Not quite. Turns out that this particular apothecary has a little side business: custom potions of varying levels of legality."
"Draco Malfoy," he whispers, and watches as his parents suddenly nod their heads. He can see that there are tears running down their faces.
“Hi,” Draco says, and drinks in Harry’s face as if it’s the first time he’s seeing him. He hadn’t realised how bad his eyesight had gotten until now, when…
were the one who made me promise I’d help out with the plans for the renovations!” The voice belonging to the third person complains. “If you knew he’s like this, why would you do this to me? I thought we were friends!”
Harry presses Malfoy into the bed, covering him with his own body as much as he can, rubs their bodies together and kisses him over and over.
Everyone else let out vaguely disbelieving noises and Draco can see naked disbelief on Harry's face, but no one calls Draco's father out on what is likely a barefaced lie. Is there any way for Draco's father to
, because Sirius didn’t need rescuing. They would have gone there to find nothing… nothing but Death Eaters.
On the sofa to his left, his mother is dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief and his father is giving him a look of endless affection.
“Despite what the modern Ministry of Magic would like for you to believe, goblins aren't all about money and banking. We Malfoys are an old enough line that we
Harry yanks Malfoy forward and slams him back into the wall, taking pleasure in the way his head bounces off the wall and the squeak of pain he lets out.
His wand drops from nerveless fingers, his knees shake, and he slides to the floor. He covers his mouth with a hand to desperately silence the sob that forces its way out of his throat.
“I… I suppose we should have your friends come over… I want them to corroborate your story. I just…” Draco bites his bottom lip. Maybe he should take a leap of faith and trust in the light feeling in his chest… But he remembers the hurt and despair too well, it’s so near still because it was only about thirty minutes ago he last felt it nearly crush him. He couldn’t bear to have it happen to him again.
The Aurors arrive then, and before Draco can really catch up with his own thoughts, he's sitting in a hospital bed, surrounded by friends and family, with a scowling witch casting diagnostic spells on him.
“How about this: while you clean this up, I’ll go Floo-order some new desserts for us, okay?” Draco smiles.
It takes him an embarrassingly long time to realise that it is the sound of his Floo ringing, that someone is trying to contact him.
They’ll want to know what happened with Potter, why they broke it off, why everything went to shit. But he doesn't know how to explain it. He doesn't know why. Harry must have gotten tired of him, gotten tired of their petty arguments that we weren't really arguments at all, just minor squabbling. Draco used to enjoy them, but perhaps he was the only one.
Her eyebrows knit together briefly before her face smooths out. "Draco?" She says again, and then more speaking he does not understand.
They take him downstairs again, they feed him, they stay crowded around him. He carries Cassiopeia in his arms the entire time, even as he feels them threatening to give out, weak and useless. As if it can tell, Cassiopeia climbs up on his shoulders, drapes itself across them, and makes that loud rumbling noise.
He wonders if this is what the world is like now, if this is what became of it after the war. Sometimes he wonders if, perhaps, he is under a curse. He quickly loses interest in thinking about it. It hardly matters, does it?
killed a Basilisk with it from what you've told me, it should imbued with Basilisk venom and thus—sort of—the capabilities of a Basilisk fang even now, years later. I have no doubt that we would be able to use the Sword of Gryffindor to destroy these horcruxes, if Basilisk venom works. Which I'm sure it does.”
than capable of casting the Patronus charm.” He might be pouting now, but he wouldn’t admit it under torture even.
has Harry smiling that soft smile of his, the one he likes putting on when they’re cuddling—bloody sap that he is.
What they didn't know, however, was that the God Killer could only kill once, and never again. The sacrifices the God Wisher had made to create it—most of his future domains—had only been enough for the death of a single god, and that was saved for the God of the Sun himself. Unless the God Wisher could take the throne and use its power to steal new domains, using the God Killer would forever mean he would only ever be half a god—weak and killable.
"Well then!" Mother claps her hands together and turns to the rest of the group. "How about Lucius and I take you all on a bit of a trip around Nice to show you the sights? But before that, let's head upstairs. We're not dressed properly for such an excursion. Come along now."
Suddenly he hears a small chime and the two-way mirror Harry's kept in his pocket ever since the whole thing went down warms up suddenly.
Perhaps it will split his head open and he won’t have to think about anything else for the rest of his now short life. If no one cares for him, if he’s lost everyone he loves… Then what point is there to live?
“Well that's that then,” he says with a voice that's far shakier than he most likely means for it to be. Harry doesn't like to hear him sound so small and shaken. Draco is supposed to be unflappable, or well not really because he's very dramatic but... He doesn't know what he was thinking. Draco is really dramatic and likes playing up everything that happens to him. He's definitely not unflappable, but there's still something that feels
“Are you serious?” Seamus sounds baffled. “That sounds entirely out of character for Harry of all people…”
So odd, in fact, that Draco nearly opens his eyes. He catches himself at the last minute, he has no interest in looking at them. Last he saw Potter…
Harry starts to slowly walk backwards, pushing Draco behind him bit by bit. They can't move fast, even though Harry really wants to. They need to get to safety, well that is rather impossible, but at least get behind something. They need to find cover.
Harry shrugs. “I don’t know the full details, but his mother’s name was Merope Gaunt.” He doesn’t seem to want to get more into it, and honestly, Draco doesn’t mind. He’d rather
They move slowly and silently—difficult though that is—on the walkways above all of the machinery that has been shoved to the walls and the open spaces that have been created.
Harry’s proposal may have been a bust this time around, but the whole “getting a kneazle” thing was clearly a stroke of genius.
Draco can’t believe that his future well-being will likely rest at least partly on the shoulders of a dunce like Potter. Oh well, he has Granger to tell him what to do. It’ll probably be fine.
If he's that obsessed with Hogwarts, and the Founders in particular... Do you think it's possible that he used other objects that belonged to the Founders besides the locket?”
The scrapbook is lovely, Draco thinks as he gently strokes his fingers against its cover. He may not be able to leave it to his children, but he will be able to at least leave it to his parents.
Sometimes he sleeps the days away, unwilling to leave his bed for anything. It's as if there is nothing outside of his covers that's worth anything anymore.
If he died now, everything he and his parents suffered through would have been for nothing. He still wouldn’t have made it to the end of the war. He ended up almost dying right at the end of it, and then the after effects of it might have killed him months later.
As predicted, Adriana's mother agrees to take Draco in. He gets a small room on the tavern's second floor and a small salary in exchange for helping her in the kitchen and Hana behind the bar.
He knows it’s all because of the calming draught, but it’s still a relief to feel that blanket of calm sweep over his frayed emotions. In fact, it’s so calming he starts to feel his head begin to droop, as if he’s about to fall back asleep.
He just wants to keep touching Malfoy and look at him, drink him in... Watch as his strangely-luminous eyes grow hazy with lust and pleasure.
“Could we take them to Malfoy Manor first?" He gives a minute shrug. “It should be more than large enough to house all of those people, and unless I'm mistaken it's heavily warded?”
Adriana swallows convulsively. "I... Well... Maybe." She cannot be sure of this man's intentions, after all. He may be trying to do something terrible. The most handsome of faces can hide much evil! After all, all the stories say the God Wisher was a very handsome man, before his evil twisted and corrupted his appearance.
They make it inside, and Harry finds himself looking around at their opulent and extravagant surroundings. The Manor truly is a manor. Harry hasn't seen a house like this before. He's always known that Draco is rich, but he never really considered
wand might be. We knew you lost it when Mr Potter and his friends made their escape from the dungeons, but we couldn’t be sure what happened to it after that.” Father’s voice sounds rough, and his eyes are slightly red-rimmed.
Draco' part here is done, and now he just wants to go to bed and sleep for three months. Well, as soon as he knows his parents have made it out safely, of course.
“Draco!” Harry drops his own pastry and moves over to his boyfriend, trying to see what’s wrong. Harry feels like his heart is beating out of his chest and standing still at the same time. Is Draco choking on something?
Still, he once more comes into the sitting room to find Potter and his friends in there with his parents.
Harry is even more upset than Draco is, however. He’s taken to burning all of the letters with a swift Incendio without ever opening them, and sends angry letters to the papers whenever a new article drops. If Draco’s father wasn’t so busy trying to find some way to cure him, Draco’s quite certain he’d be threatening to sue the lot of them.
with Lucius these days, and as much as Narcissa is lovely, Harry really doesn’t want to propose in front of them. However, he’s sure Draco would appreciate being proposed to here in Wiltshire, on the Malfoy lands.
Draco sighs, and the expression of his face seems... longing, nostalgic, as if he's remembering something nice from times past.
know what the stars are? Well, Adriana hasn't ever seen them herself, of course, but she still knows what they are! They're among the most important things in the world, and their loss is still heavily lamented even a hundred years after it occurred!
He wanders the Manor for most of the day, not knowing what he's searching for... If he's searching for anything at all. Perhaps he isn't, perhaps he's just wandering.
It’s as he’s watching Harry and Teddy play in the garden, Blaise and Pansy lounging nearby, and Father and Hermione drop in to see him—desperate to get some time with him before he goes, even as they do their best to find
, was once a mere mortal woman. She walked the earth to find the knowledge she knew she needed until she found it: the Ancient Name she carried within.
Draco snorts loudly. “Not to be the person to bring it up, but I was actually raised in the Wizarding World by people who haven't given up on all things proprietary and useful—!”
Sometimes it sits on his lap, places its small paws on his chest, and cries loudly in his face. Its teeth are sharp, but it doesn't bite. He tries to soothe it, lets out breathy sounds as he strokes over its fur. It calms, but he wonders if it finds any comfort in his actions.
Maybe they finally got tired of looking after him when he was completely helpless, not even feeding himself or capable of speech.
In between the two sides stood the God of the Stars, lover to the God of the Sun, but child of two gods who had fallen to their knees in fear before the God Wisher.
Perhaps he can create some sort of magic lenses that will allow him to see in colour, despite having lost his Other. If he works at it, surely it must be possible? It’s
Since the NMO managed to invade St. Mungo’s, the only healers on the Rebellion side are Draco, Madam Pomfrey, three other healers who managed to escape the attack on St. Mungo's, and about twenty healing students.This means that the healers siding with the Rebellion are torn between both making sure that the Rebellion is safe and healthy, but also furthering the studies of the students. This leaves Draco stressed out of his mind, but there's nothing they can do about it. Until they can end all of this... This is how things have to be.
And Draco had thought Harry wasn’t the spoiling type. Clearly he’s been wrong about a lot of things lately. All the more fool is he.
When he finally finds the mirror, he nearly drops it in his haste, but catches it at the last second.
He flinches every single time, unable to stop himself. It is one of the few things he can still feel—the oppressive, painful, razor sharp feel of other people's magic—but he wonders if, perhaps, he wouldn't prefer to feel nothing at all.
He thinks back to the light catching in Malfoy’s pale hair and the way his dark lashes had framed his pale eyes.
Armed with this knowledge, come to him from the love of a mother, and burning with righteous anger over the loss of his lover, the God of the Sun struck down the God Wisher and turned his weapon upon himself.
Harry swallows harshly, and cannot understate how glad he is but he dragged the body away in between machinery. If he had left it out in the open…
, the criminal can still get away with terrible things. And as long as the people who need help since the war ended don't get it, there will be desperate people willing to do terrible things to survive. After all, Draco should know better than anyone what desperation can make someone do.
With a shriek she pulls her scarf on and runs out of her room, down the rickety stairs and out of the house. She hurries down the cobblestone street at full speed, hoping she won't run into anyone—they would no doubt scold her and then she really
Harry limps down the long stone pathway, taking a right when he needs to, slowly navigating the maze-like innards of the cave system that the resistance is hiding in. He's tired and injured, but not so much that he can't make his way back to base.
to get here unless he’s broken more than just a few laws, and some of them international and… Merlin, he can’t have. But
The other-touched—those who see what regular people can't, feel what regular people can't—are the very epitome of misfits.
Draco chokes down a sob at that familiar voice saying those words, tries not to listen to his friends sharp intakes of breath, and feels frozen in place.
If Potter wasn't moving closer to Draco's bedroom, Draco probably wouldn't have heard that last bit. But he is, so Draco does.
The Manor grounds are lovely in bloom, the wild of their growth gently and expertly tended and cultivated by the goblin groundskeepers. He waves at them whenever he sees them, but they seem rather despondent as of late. Draco can't be sure why, but sometimes he feels like the entire Manor and its grounds feel dejected and sad, despite being in bloom.
They sit down in the opulent sofas in the lounge, and Mipsy is quick to bring Draco a cup of tea, though she leaves the rest of them for Loulou. Who, as it turns out, gives Harry a very suspicious glare as she hands over his cup of tea, as if she's not sure if he deserves it or not. So unfailingly loyal.
comfort. He’s slept in a tent for way too long already, even though it's not as cramped anymore now that Ron and Hermione aren't there.
Harry stares at him as he talks, hopelessly in love with this dramatic man and his utterly engaging way of telling a story. Draco never just
“He what?” Hermione exclaims, giving voice to the disbelief that’s roiling in Harry’s gut. Lucius Malfoy… said something in support of Harry?
She rolled her eyes at him, but Ron's more than used to that by now so it doesn't affect him at all. It's just one of those things they do at this point, that always makes Harry roll his eyes at them.
coming up with clever charms—even if he usually just used them to mock Potter—and brew potions. Now he’s stuck doing mostly what he did before he came out of his Occlumency coma: walking around the Manor and the gardens with Cassiopeia—and sometimes Aquilla—though now he also spends some time reading.
But they too are faded, like a photograph that has lost its magic and is slowly starting to erase itself off its parchment.
He thought that maybe things would change now, now that he knows his name, but... they don’t. His magic is still gone, the world still lacks colour... And his parents still speak and he cannot make sense of the noise.
He nods at his father, takes comfort in his presence and allows himself to press close to that larger body.
He wakes up instantly, and stares at the panel above his own four-poster—much smaller than the one he'd seen in his dream—as his heart hammers away in his chest.
“Probably because Harry said he saw him at the graveyard…” Neville says as he continues to read. “Well, huh. I guess he must have frightened them into actually printing what he said verbatim.”
It throws Harry and Draco back, and the feeling as the wave of magic passes over Harry is almost… revitalising. It feels like nature and growing and…
“Well, we should still try to send the coordinates to this place to someone else. If we fail... They can hopefully take over. We can't just let this chance slip us by.” Harry fights to keep his breathing even, despite the anxiety that’s starting to burn in his gut.
Malfoy’s face pales and his eyes grow wide just as Harry’s magic slams out from his body, forcing the hex to disperse and pushing Malfoy backwards, sending him stumbling. Quick as a striking snake, Harry catches Malfoy by the wrist and reverses their positions.
He supposes they want to be here for the end, though they hadn't planned to come back to Britain until the wedding. He was at their wedding, after all, it wouldn’t do to have them not come to his.
Harry just stares at Draco, marvelling at how blithely he talks about the possibility that the Death Eaters may have invaded Malfoy Manor—this same Malfoy Manor they’re supposed to be heading to.
Finally he finds himself outside the Room of Requirement, except the door is already there. He stares at it for a while, unsure of what he should do. Maybe it's a trap? Or maybe it's not the Room of Requirement at all.
This whole thing would have been far more difficult if they didn't have magic, limited though it is right now.
seen them, or know where they are... You could tell them about me, and give them the opportunity to seek me out on their own."
A strong Scourgify hits him, taking the strongly smelling viscous liquid away. It's followed by a vanishing spell so strong but sloppy that it doesn't just take the glass, it also vanishes some of his hair and part of his robes around the neckline and shoulder.
By the time they're in early April, Harry has taken a leave of absence from being an Auror, spending his time with Draco in the Manor, helping him move across the grounds with his cane or—more and more often now—pushing him around them in a wheelchair.
“I thought I was making it worse, and I thought it would be better for both of us to be apart. I figured it would be better to have a clean break than a messy one down the road when everything would hurt more. I didn't think…”
Cassiopeia rubs herself against his legs as he continues to cook and prepare. He hums a tune to himself and keeps one eye on the clock. As soon as the food is ready, he casts some stasis charms on the plates—decked out beautifully as they are—and then he starts to set the table.
“How did you find me? It's not like you should have my Floo address at all... Did you go snooping in the Ministry records? Did you break the law?”
Draco snarls. “I need to tell my parents that Potter isn’t going to go running off to the Ministry, so they can bring the house elf to the—to You-Know-Who.”
“An ambush; I think they were expecting us to go to Hogwarts. Possibly as a retaliation for the fact that they themselves can't go there. If the Potions Professor is on the NMO’s side, he would likely have told them that Hogwarts is not.”
This time… this time, nothing is going to get in the way. There’s no kitchen where the cooks can attempt something as bloody crazy as cooking with Fiendfyre, after all!
"I suppose we can go sit down in the lounge," he croaks, and watches as Harry's head flies up. He looks surprised and
Potter to go to the Ministry after all. He planted the damn vision in the first place. I don’t understand how you’re all so stupid and blind!”
From somewhere deep inside his own memory, he can feel the phantom sensation of Fiendfyre heat, the remnants of panic, and the sound of Potter’s voice ‘We can’t leave them!’, a strong hand grasping Draco’s own, pulling him up on a broom.
Draco swallows and turns his gaze down into his lap, staring into his tea cup. He feels awful and horrible because… He believes Harry. And that means that Draco has been terrible and made
A team has been placed in Malfoy Manor, waiting for Harry and Lucius to get the healers through. They will make sure that no one tries to escape, and that anyone who needs help can get it.
Of course, he’s actually quite glad they did all of it, because it seems their turn against the Dark Lord during the final battle and the very real positive effects that had for Potter’s side seems to have helped them quite substantially to go free with only minimum of damages.
“I'm a Slytherin, we're all about ambition and cunning. Actually, Father might have thought that it was a pretty good exercise for me, to see if I could break in without him finding out. You never know when it will come to your aid—knowing how to break into something secure without being caught.
He's tall, with golden tan skin and unruly black hair. There's a large branching scar on his forehead—like a bolt of lightning, Adriana thinks inanely—and his eyes are so green they almost seem to glow. He's wearing finely made clothes, edged with gold, and a lovely dark green cloak with a collar of brown fur.
“Just as I told you it would,” Draco says, his voice now holding far more of his customary smugness and self-assuredness. It's a relief to hear him sound more like himself again. Harry wonders if maybe he just doesn't like to hear Draco be scared. Harry wouldn't like to hear Ron or Hermione be scared either, so it makes sense.
Draco does want children, in the future anyway, but he wants to have them with a partner. And as he’s now back to being single after what
The sudden sound of the mail owls entering the Great Hall startles Harry out of his thoughts, and he looks up briefly to take the scene in. He shares a glance with Ron and Hermione, but then he just goes back to staring into his food as he eats.
It has Harry laughing loudly, though Draco doesn’t think it was quite that funny. However, he does always enjoy it when Harry finds amusement in his wit. It’s very pleasing.
It will be fun to hold the fact that Draco probably saved his life over his head forever though. No less than he deserves, really.
“Honestly, Draco,” Pansy says suddenly, pulling down her sunglasses to shield her eyes and cocking her hip. “I don’t think I’ll ever quite understand why you persist to stay in that tiny apartment of yours when you could live
He’s grown up around portraits, he knows how they work and how they’re a way to capture a bit of someone you love to remain in the world after they're gone without them becoming something as terrible as a ghost. And while portraits are an accurate reflection of them, and capable of learning and growing, in many ways as real as the person themselves…
He’d briefly considered going into healing, but he’d realised after taking his N.E.W.T.s as he started looking at the application processes for healing schools that… Well… Regardless of his grades, they wouldn’t accept him into the programs.
Still, Draco was doing well before Potter and his earnest ways had snuck their way into his heart, and then left him broken and despairing when Potter decided he had enough.
Not because Draco has anything against Harry's family and friends—anymore—but rather because he doesn't fancy heading into a dangerous situation with no backup. Who knows what could happen when he's left at their mercy?
He murmurs 'Draco' under his breath a few times, as if listening to the way it sounds and considering its merits intently.
The sound of multiple voices drawing near pulls Draco out of his self-deprecating thoughts and soon a very large group of people—Dear Morgana, why isn’t it just Ginny Weasley why are there so many and… why are Draco’s
“Does it say anything else?” Hermione’s trying to see the paper over Ginny’s head while Ginny’s practically hanging over Neville’s shoulder, trying to see for herself.
Sometimes he wonders what colours things really are... He can tell that his father's hair is very pale, and his mother's hair is darker, though not by much. He wonders what his own hair looks like, but he hasn't looked in a mirror since... Since. He's walked past mirrors, but his eyes lose focus and everything turns blurry when he tries to look into them.
The days grow darker. He watches raindrops run like small rivers down the glass of the window as night falls earlier and earlier.
of the awful magic that is creating and animating all of these Inferi, then it's bound to be well guarded.
Harry feels lighter than he has in a long while. One more horcrux gone, and now Ron and Hermione might be coming back. And he's gotten to snog Draco and he's probably going to get to do that more going forward.
Harry just shrugs his shoulders listlessly. At this point he's not even sure if he cares what Draco is doing or not. Ron and Hermione have abandoned them, so what does anything matter anymore?
The sooner Draco's finished, the sooner Harry will have backup for when the Herders come back. They're both under disillusion spells, and Harry has made Draco wear the Invisibility Cloak this time. Considering how much Draco needs to move to change the magic circle, a disillusion spell might not be able to hold up if the Herders come back and look for them.
"I know how we can lure Harry Potter to the Department of Mysteries." Smiles look entirely wrong on the Dark Lord's face these days. During the first war, the Dark Lord had been a handsome and charismatic man. Not so much now. The snake-like appearance, the pallor, the lack of a nose... it's grotesque more than anything else.
“Your attacker.” Harry presses another kiss to Draco’s knuckles. “He found the person who attacked you, and he found the recipe for the poison and… St. Mungo’s figured out an antidote, a cure.”
Malfoys lips… they looked soft too; soft and pink. Harry wonders if maybe Malfoy uses some sort of lip balm, because they didn’t even look chapped and Harry knows that
“Because I'm brilliant,” Draco continues, his face looking far more sly now. Harry gets the feeling that Draco is taking the piss out of him, but even so…
Possibly... But Adriana has no way of knowing if that is a good or a bad thing. After all, Draco has amnesia... and no idea
His Other has either died or undergone Core Severing, and now Draco’s parents and even Cassiopeia have gone away too.
"The guy who runs it has to support his sister and her family after her wife died in the war—she suffered severe curse damage—so he's been taking custom orders to get extra income. It turns out that the Ministry said things aren't actually getting paid out as they should—so we actually managed to root out more corruption in the process of finding Draco's attacker." Ron snorts loudly, and Draco can't blame him. It's actually kind of funny.
“Well, we don't... that's why— that's why Ron left. I don't quite know why Hermione went with him, but... I guess it's because she's in love with him.”
He sold himself to the greatest monster the wizarding world has ever seen to save his parents… Perhaps that’s what cost him his Other? Perhaps they realised who he was and couldn’t bear to be his. Perhaps they went through a Core Severing to unbind themselves from Draco.
the stupid posh arsehole Malfoy has always been peeking out again, hurling insults at Ron as always. If Harry had thought for even a second that maybe Malfoy was actually out to help them, here’s the solid proof he was delusional to even consider it.
He watches Malfoy during the days, as covertly as he can. He wants to know how accurate his dreams are.
“McGonagall's got Hogwarts on lockdown, and the NMO can't get in. She's on our side, and the students are well aware of it. She's locked down all forms of outside communication, and only trusted house elves are allowed to leave the grounds at all at this point. Hogwarts is essentially another safe place for us to go, if we absolutely need it.”
"You have nothing to fear from me, certainly not for hiding and shielding him. I've been searching for a century, and I'd much rather he be safe due to people like you, than having found him earlier hurt and abused."
"Yes… It powers the Inferi that are around, so they should just drop... dead, I supposed we could call it. And it might even turn some people back into regular human beings. At least the ones who were infected and turned without being killed first. But I can't be sure."
“How did you get here?” Draco wishes his voice didn’t waver, wishes he wasn’t mostly naked in only a swimsuit and standing around hugging himself like the world’s greatest loser.
“How?” Sometimes Harry really doesn't understand Draco's relationship with his parents. Or really Draco's parents’ take on childcare and magic in general. They seem very blasé about the kind of shit Draco gets into—as long as he doesn't get hurt that is.
Yes, sometimes Draco had been the one who started it. He's not always the most gentle of people, and Weasley has a temper and is so bloody sensitive. Harry would always demand Draco apologise, but when bloody Weasley, or one of Harry's other stupid friends, had called Draco a ferret, Potter would just laugh. As if it were funny. As if it were a joke, something Draco should've found amusing, something he should've laughed at.
Draco is not going to reply to what Harry said about missing him. He doesn't believe it and he's not going to entertain it. It's not worth the almost certain pain that will come with it.
Malfoy’s probably a bloody spy for Voldemort! That’s why he’s trying to stop Harry from making it to the Ministry in time to save Sirius!
Draco’s well aware that his parents would be less than pleased to see him ‘shack up’ with The Boy Who Lived—though he’s sure they’d resign themselves to it if he were really adamant about it—and no doubt Pansy would shriek herself hoarse over what an idiot he is for even entertaining the thought that a relationship between them could work. Blaise would likely just shake his head and look unconvinced…
just as much as he did when they first happened. He waves his hands, he rolls his eyes, he tosses his hair… he does so many things that should make him look ridiculous, but they only serve to remind Harry why he loves him.
Draco will ask how later, he’d nearly collapsed in relieved exhaustion as soon as Father told him they were safe.
In the middle of the room is a large four-poster bed, with a tester decked out with gold and posh looking green curtains hanging from it. It's the most expensive looking bed Harry has ever seen in his life.
were rather put out too, but easily forgave him when he mentioned that being on the squad had given then enough extra points—absolute favouritism from Umbridge—to pass the N.E.W.T.s of even their worst subjects. Which is really the only reason Draco made them come along in the first place.
He wasn't the one to interview her, the rest of them knew that he probably wouldn't be able to keep himself professional or even calm in front of her. Out of all of them, her betrayal still stings the worst.
Father's lips curl in the mirror. "Black. How mature. I'm not even going to respond to the insult or clear lack of gratitude for saving your godson's life. Alas, we can't all have manners. Now if you'll excuse me." Father looks Draco in the eyes then, stern but loving. "Be careful, Draco," he says, and then the image in the mirror winks out.
"I think I might be into guys." The words just fall or of his mouth before he can think of stopping them. Which, great Harry. Real great.
The next time he wakes, his parents have moved from the bed. His father is sitting in a chair with a book and his mother is humming to herself as she moves through the room. Draco wonders what it is she's trying to do, but he cannot ask.
Draco won't be back from work for a while yet, so Harry takes a bit of time to just gaze at the ring he had customised. It's lovely, and he can't wait to see it on Draco's finger.
He slowly tries to make his body react, tries to make it sit up… But he’s still wracked with sobs and he feels as weak as a newborn kitten. He doesn’t know what to do with himself.
they're both being sincere. "We've already seen you disappear down a road we couldn't follow once... I don't want to see it happen again, Draco. It nearly destroyed you last time..."
“Well, Voldemort being a Gaunt of course. He was absolutely mad, and considering that family line bred itself asunder… Fitting.”
“Hoped what? That I was still hopelessly pining for you and waiting desperately for the day you deigned to call on me? Hoped that I had nothing better to do than sit around and hope the guy who dumped me would change his mind?”
When Harry had suggested they give things a go, see what happens, Draco hadn’t been sure what to think. Especially since Harry had also suggested they keep it secret, just so they could see whether they could even function in a romantic relationship at all without the outside pressures that would come with their family and friends knowing. But the more he thought about it, the more sense it had made.
"Draco," Harry says in a soft murmur, and Draco looks up from where his gaze was trained at the flowerbeds to find Harry leaning over him. "Have you finished your letters? It's lunchtime, and we were planning to all eat together. Even Ron's made it."
Perhaps in a decade, when he’s settled with at least one child he’ll be able to look back at this and laugh about it. Perhaps one day it will be nothing more than a funny anecdote.
its name and he is right. As if it’s telling him that he does know a name, that he has not lost everything.
He’d said as much to Ha—Potter once, when they’d been on the topic. He’d seemed pleased with Draco’s acceptance and the fact that he’s willing to take accountability for the way he’s treated… But with recent events being what they are, Draco can’t help but wonder what Potter was really thinking.
He really wishes that this wasn't his destiny. Perhaps it's horrible of him, but he wishes that it had fallen on someone else. Sometimes, in his darkest moments, he wishes Voldemort would have gone after Neville instead.
They immediately get a message back from Hermione telling them to wait and that they can probably make it there in just a few hours, because they have an operation point that's fairly close.
With their refusals, the God Wisher needed to find a different tactic... And so he crafted a weapon—a weapon capable of killing gods, the God Killer. With it, he struck terror in the pantheon. Any god who came close to the God Killer could
It takes them a while to finally come up for air proper again, and Draco feels drunk on it. He hadn't been sure they could fit together like this... but they do and he loves it. Enjoys every minute of it, even the dumb spats over dinner choices or manners and lack thereof.
The voice that calls out his name makes Draco's entire body freeze and stiffen. He stops breathing and tries not to make a single sound. He recognises that voice so very clearly, but he wishes that he didn't. He wishes that it was just some stranger walking through his Floo.
It just… feels better in the Manor now. Like the air is easier to breathe, like your limbs are lighter and easier to move.
Cassie, of course, doesn’t mind. Not to mention that she’s a kneazle and more than intelligent enough to understand her own nickname. Besides, needling Draco this way really makes Harry laugh, so he’s not about to stop doing it. Besides, he’s
He moves his hands over Malfoy's chest, skims over a pink nipple and startles at the moaning sound Malfoy lets out at the contact.
If she'd at least taught them properly, it would have made her seem more… what's the word? Trustworthy, that's it.
Perhaps he’s just an old, shriveled husk of a man who might as well have died at eighteen for all the time he’s lived his own life. Perhaps Mother and Father really
He feels her muscles tense under his hands as he holds on to her, as she takes in Draco’s rather bad summary of his and Potter’s relationship.
Draco bursts out laughing, huge guffaws from the pit of his stomach… Until they transform into huge sobs. Oh Circe, he dated and broke up with Harry Potter.
But he’s not really feeling up to it. For all he knows, maybe Harry’s been honest about it to her. Maybe she
In fact, in both France and Monaco, the two places Draco actually has personal experience with, no one even so much as bats an eye at his last name. Instead, it’s… well respected. Like it once was in Britain before the war.
Harry is uncomfortably aware of that fact. Since he can't bring Draco with him, he's going to have to bring Lucius Malfoy. It's going to be uncomfortable, and Harry doesn't entirely trust Lucius. But they don't really have a choice at this point.
Harry takes it out to find Sirius's face smiling back at him. He looks around the room quickly, but only Ron and Hermione are in the common room, so he turns back to the mirror.
Harry isn’t sure he would make it through this if he didn't have Draco by his side, if he didn't have Draco’s love. It's all bad enough as it is, if he’d had to go through it mostly alone like last time...
Though the explosions of Fairly far away, the sound is almost deafening and the entire building shakes. Harry and Draco lie in wait, watching as the Herders start to panic.
“That’s probably what he wanted people to think, but he didn't. Though,” Draco pauses for a brief moment. “He must have impressed the goblin very much, since they actually named the sword after him rather than themselves. That's something, I suppose.”
He looks happier than Draco has seen him in months, and it feels as if a heavy weight suddenly lifts from Draco’s shoulders, as if something that has been dragging him down has been cut away and left him feeling free and without burden.
shall we say, over the years.” Father sounds proud, and Draco can imagine him straightening in his seat as he speaks. “Is there anything particular you’re looking for?”
He thinks he’s seen it before, but… He turns it over in his hands a few more times, but then he hands it back to his mother. It’s her stick. She should have it.
"Mostly witches marry wizards and vice versa, but sometimes they don't. Sometimes witches marry witches and wizards wizards. The law just says you need two consenting parties over the age of majority as far as I know." Ron says with a shrug when they grill him on it. Then he says something about Charlie first moving to Romania to be with his boyfriend, though apparently they're not together anymore.
Merlin, Harry. We almost-mostly just broke up, and we’ve dated for a little less than a year. Of course I didn’t mean
He wants to go back to a time when there was colour and light and laughter… A time before he lost the meaning of words and names and… everything.
Draco shudders and seems to pull himself together, and then he swiftly opens the vial and before Harry knows it, one drop of Basilisk venom lands on each of the windows of the open locket.
When Harry sees Malfoy's hands move to the buttons on his robes... he turns around and flees the room entirely.
Harry isn't the only one to gasp at those words, which is how he realises that he's not the only one Umbridge used the Blood Quills on. He would almost rather wish that he was, because at least that would mean no one else got hurt at least.
Harry frowns. “Why? I mean… I already told everyone… Which, I mean, I guess if you want to talk about that, since I didn’t ask first, then we could but, uhm…”
Which is how Harry and Hermione find out that wizards don't really have sexuality labels because they don't divide people on something like that.
At the seventh month, Adriana can tell that Draco is restless. He looks towards the horizon more and more, even as he works with his hands. She can
"Welcome home! Dinner is ready." He smiles at Draco, happily taking in the way his eyes widen in delight.
He’d like to get back to a healthy state where he can cast magic however much he wants, but Healer Binns impressed him with the importance of letting his core slowly get used to magic usage again, since he’s gone so long without even touching a wand.
into Hermione's bag, so they'll at least be able to summon the satchel if not the locket itself if they need it. He's not sure why they would need it now that the horcrux is gone, but he supposes that it is an important historical artefact.
And Draco didn’t know any of it. Hasn't heard a single word about it either. For all the time they've spent together the last few months during their relationship... Harry hasn't mentioned a single word of any of this. It's not as if they've been only having sex with no conversations, of course not! They've talked a lot, how could they not? They started their relationship from a rather... Unusual place.
is very obsessed with Hogwarts. And especially the idea that he is related to Slytherin, as one of the Founders. I mean, he is, I think, but he's obsessed with the idea of it.”
“Absolutely,” Draco says cheerfully. “Just a few drops of that and we will be free of this locket forever. Of course, if we had the Sword of Gryffindor, that would be even better. We wouldn't even have to worry about running out of poison or anything. However, no such luck, so we'll just have to take what we can get.”
He's sitting on the large four-poster with the lush green drapes, his knees drawn to his chest, and entirely naked. His pale skin seems to almost glow against the dark of the bed sheet and Harry finds himself hopelessly transfixed.
he would be upset at the idea of Draco telling his friends. If Draco told others then their secret relationship would no longer be a secret between the two of them, and Harry would risk having his duplicity found out. The more people who know, the higher the risk of the "wrong people", in this case, Harry's friends, finding out.
"He owes you nothing, Potter!" Malfoy actually shouts. "He could lie to you until he's blue in the face with no consequence unless it's against the rules given to him!"
As he makes it back to the compartment, Hermione and Parkinson are already inside. He gives them a baleful look, and then an even nastier one to Zabini as he saunters inside after Ron.
This is too important for that. He needs to swallow his pride and accept that he fucked up. He was distrustful and basically ended up breaking his own heart.
Sometimes, his mother looks at him with hopeful eyes... But he doesn't know why. And every time he watches as the hope in her face falls. He watches as his father's shoulders slump.
It’s bad enough that Blaise and Pansy will never come back, his memories of… Of however long it’s been since the war is fuzzy at best, but he remembers them vaguely. Remembers not remembering them. Remembers wondering if he knew them at all, remembers concluding that they were strangers after they stopped coming.
“It’s… it’s Malfoy. Draco Malfoy.” Potter draws in a deep shuddering breath, and then he turns around and holds up a mirror. In it, Draco can see a shaggy looking man, but he seems vaguely familiar. He resembles Bellatrix a bit, though Draco can also see some of his mother in him, despite their different colouring. Potter continues, “He’s the one who stopped me. Who… He says Kreacher went to his mother? Narcissa Malfoy?”
"Adriana... You should—You should go get Draco. Explain it as well as you can, let him make his own decision."
Draco kisses him, fingers tangling is Harry's hair, and Harry can only assume that Draco feels the same.
“Exactly,” Granger says with far more enthusiasm than Potter. “All the healers we spoke to mentioned that losing colour vision in one eye—when there’s nothing wrong with the eye itself—is usually something that happens when one member of a Pair dies temporarily, and then is resuscitated.”
If, against all odds, this whole thing is just some silly misunderstanding, Harry might try to go after him. And really, Draco’s not feeling up to it. He needs some time to relax and lick his wounds. He can consider doing something as exhausting sounding as talking about it once he’s had that vacation.
"I'd like to listen first." If it makes him cry again, he'd rather have as little of an audience as possible.
Draco is many things—dramatic, occasionally anxious, attention-seeking—but he’s not stupid. He can put two-and-two together for something as simple as this.
it. Hates that he's the one who's made Harry look like a kicked puppy. Of course, he'll hate himself even more later if this is all an act and he falls for it.
“Usually, the resuscitated one of the Pair loses colour vision in one eye while the other loses in both because they
of things in the end rather than perish along the way tells him to not open himself up to this pain. Nothing good can come from this, surely not.
Harry sighs and rolls over in his bed, resolutely closing his eyes. He shouldn’t dwell on it. Not now, at least. He’s… he’s already had a hard enough time all year. He’s been angry and distant and he hasn’t even really felt like
Whether or not the world is in colour for others, whether or not this is merely some sort of numb afterlife... It hardly matters.
Harry has long since wondered if perhaps they are trying to emulate Dementors. it wouldn't surprise him in the least, considering the things they're doing with the world. The Inferi apocalypse has sucked most joy out of the world just as surely as any Dementor would. It's just unfortunate that it can't be counteracted by a well-cast Patronus.
“Did you lot really think that the Demoiselle Crane Patronus that warned you about Umbridge and the Inquisitorial Squad coming for your little group manifested out of nowhere?” He raises an eyebrow at them. “Or perhaps you thought Edgecomb sent it as an apology for ratting you out in the first place?”
He curls in on himself and tries to sleep again, knowing that he's surrounded by his parents and Cassiopeia. He doesn't want them to leave, he hopes that they never will.
An uncomfortable squirming feeling of guilt is starting to grow in his chest, next to the hurt, and he doesn't like it one bit.
Pansy and Blaise have, of course, made themselves into absolute nuisances by pointing out every single fit looking man they’ve seen, with more than a few insinuations that Draco should, perhaps, make the most of his vacation and get a few shags done.
Harry watches Draco’s wind tousled hair as it gleams in the sun and his flushed face as he laughs at the spread of foods and desserts that Harry’s taking out of the basket one by one and falls all over again.
“Dumbledore theorised as much. He thought that maybe Hufflepuff’s cup could have been made into a horcrux. Of course, we didn't have any idea where it could be. He also said that he believed the snake Nagini to… to probably be a horcrux.”
He thinks Father and Hermione may have lost hope. St. Mungo's definitely has. Ron is the only one that still seems as fervently at work as ever, but that might simply be that crime doesn't stop simply because your friend is dying.
Seeing Draco dote and fuss so completely over the kneazle, no doubt the same way he would dote on a child of theirs,  makes something clench in Harry’s chest, and he watches—helplessly in love—as his boyfriend remains entirely enchanted with the kneazle.
He realises with a start that Aquilla must have been there occasionally… But he never had a very cuddly relationship with Aquilla, they were more… we-spend-time-in-the-same-room-together friends. But Draco has always enjoyed that companionship, too… But it seems that he couldn’t really… He couldn’t tell that Aquilla was even there.
It's pretty clear to him that he's the problem. He's the one who's been dumped in every single relationship, so clearly, he's the one who's just not worth it. It must just be something incredibly off-putting about him that no one can stand for long.
Draco lies curled up against Harry's side and takes a long sip of tea before he sighs contentedly. The fire is sparking and lovely to watch, it creates a perfect atmosphere for the detective drama on the wireless. They’ve missed a few episodes, sure, but that’s not a problem. It’s an episodic drama anyway.
He stupidly assumed that Harry had been upset at the thought of Draco telling his friends because he wasn’t ready yet, angry because Draco hadn’t talked it over with him first. Anger from the perceived betrayal of Draco's actions, for his lack of concern for Harry and the decision they'd made together. It made sense, at the time, that Harry would be upset about Draco breaking his word. Draco had absolutely understood, he'd hurried to clear up the understanding... He'd
Except, he realises, it absolutely makes sense the Potter can get through. When Potter ended things, Draco immediately moved apartments. But he copied his Floo warding from his old apartment, instead of bothering to redo it on the new one. Since Harry was allowed through in the old one, and Draco didn't change anything, Harry is allowed through in the new one.
“It’s in my suitcase in my room. Let’s go!” Harry whirls around to face the door, ready sprint back to Gryffindor tower.
Draco shakes his head and smiles. Harry’s general obliviousness can, at times, be frustrating, but it can also be incredibly charming. And sometimes it’s both. At least to Draco.
These days he only goes to Muggle parks, and sits there on the park benches just staring at nothing for so long, his body starts to ache from the uncomfortable seat. He sees parents pulling children away from him, and he wonders if he looks deranged...dangerous perhaps. Perhaps he does, even though he's trying to look as Muggle-friendly as possible. He’s not wearing expensive robes or anything. He can't bring himself to go anywhere else though, can't bear the thought of seeing someone he knows.
Draco sighs again as he realizes that Potter's presence means that he's not getting any more sleep. Potter is going to make him get up immediately. He always was one of those annoying “no time like the present” people.
Especially since it’s now clear to him and everyone that he hasn’t learned Occlumency... But he still absolutely refuses to let Snape back in his mind.
Potter murmurs something in return, but Draco doesn't bother to listen. He's not really interested in what Potter has to say either.
He was just supposed to pick up some napkin samples—he would have thought that Harry would hate every single second of all of this, find it stupid and wasteful, but they've had fun with it. He was just supposed to pop in, grab the samples, and go back home.
After all, he's pretty sure that the Herders will realise that something is wrong with the Main Crystal when they return. There's no way that they won't recognise that it’s not doing what it's supposed to be doing. Especially not if it causes the Inferi to collapse, the way Harry and Draco are hoping it will.
He doesn't think he holds any particular secrets, he doesn't know... much of anything. He simply moves through his days, existing, and stares at a world in faded greyscale.
Draco sighs loudly and doesn't move at all. Whoever it is will get fed up soon enough and leave him alone. He doesn't even know who it might be, it's not like he's really given his Floo address to anyone.
He greets Aquilla, stroking his feathers gently as Cassiopeia lounges across his shoulders, purring in his ears. His two companions seem to get along at least; Draco likes that. He doesn't know what he would have done with himself if they were at odds or incompatible.
Still… There are important topics for them to discuss, and Draco can’t hide them away. Not now, not when they came so close to losing everything…
They make it into the main part of the building, the large factory floor. they had to come in through the upper floor offices from the roof, because there were simply too many Inferi on the ground surrounding the building.
Of course, it seems the universe truly does hate Draco, because Harry and Ginny Weasley step inside the shop.
"So if we get rid of the crystal, they should stop being infectious then? Regular Inferi aren't infectious, they don't spread their state to other people, so that must be the crystal too." Harry wishes he didn't know as much about Inferi as he does, but there's nothing he can do about it.
Has the world changed so much since the end of the war? More so than Draco could ever hope to even dream of?
The fae fire casts shadows over Draco's face—along the hollows of his cheeks and down the slope of his nose—as Harry watches him sleep.
Potter enters Draco's bedroom, and all Draco hears then is a loud sigh. Of course he's somehow disappointed Potter, that has to be what that sigh means.
fucked up here. I should have been open with you and you should have tried being explicit… Besides, I
“Oh, how delightful!” Mother claps her hands together. “I’ll send Mipsy over to the Villa immediately to warn the house elves there that you’ll be arriving shortly, just to make sure that they can stock up on food and everything you and your friends might need.”
Though Harry has his suspicions about Ron and Hermione, if they can just get their act together. So far, they're both to blind to see it. Well, if they ever get married, at least Harry will have some amazing and embarrassing stories to tell during the wedding. That's something to look forward to!
He opens and takes out the two chocolatey treats he ordered from the closest fancy bakery—they were really accommodating about the ring; Harry thinks they must get that a lot—and smiles. They look really good, and considering Draco’s sweet tooth…
did while he spent so long just wandering around his family home as little more than a zombie, literally locked away inside his own head.
Maybe he should go talk to someone just... just for his parents' peace of mind. That would be kind of him, wouldn't it?
have allowed the kneazle to stay as they requested,” Healer Binns mutters. “Likely would have saved our patient some stress and agony, judging by his reaction to waking up alone.”
He hates it when Harry has to leave, hates that Harry can’t stay because no one knows about them. As much as he loves their cosy evenings together, he hates that they have to end. Hates that Harry can’t stay the night… or that Draco can’t stay the night in Harry’s apartment.
No, Harry Potter was always the one people flock to, the one people thought was special and good and kind and great. The Slytherins would come to Draco, of course, but that's more because they
Malfoy lets out a small gurgle and starts to twist and turn in Harry’s grasp, trying in vain to free himself. Harry, who still thinks of himself as a small and scrawny eleven year-old, can’t quite believe that he’s broader and stronger than Malfoy, that
He wants to go back to that Thursday before he overheard Ginny Weasley's conversation. He wants to go back to being ignorant. He wants what they had before this whole thing ever happened.
Draco closes his eyes and puts the mirror back in his pocket where it will be safe and there's no risk of him losing it.
The day when he stops longing for those lovely days when Potter was around cannot come fast enough. He longs for them with a fervour that's almost startling.
He's beautiful and the warm, pulsating light of the fae fire, but Harry longs to be able to stare at him like this outside in the sunlight. Or the moonlight. He longs to be able to calmly spend the rest of his life with Draco.
“Excellent,” he says, without really thinking it’s especially excellent at all. “If I come back at… 6pm, could you have prepared your most comfortable armchairs? You don’t need to take the price into consideration.”
of all people got that honour—and lock yourself in a Prefect bathroom. They’re certainly large enough, and I doubt Umbridge will go busting into one of those.” Draco brushes imaginary dust off his robes. “If you’ll excuse me, I will take my leave now.”
How many times has he demanded that Potter come back? That he stops being terrible and just returns joy and fun to Draco's life with his presence? How many times has Draco apologised for being such a terrible downer and the worst kind of person? How many more times will he do that until the memory of being with Potter finally fades?
be someone’s side-piece knowingly, Blaise. I don’t think my Malfoy pride could bend that far, no matter how desperate I personally got.” He laughs then, loud and hateful. Because isn’t that just the thing?
“Like an extension of your self. The other side of your coin. Someone you share a strong bond with, be it platonic or romantic. Someone with whom you have complimentary magic.” Mother’s voice is calm. “Not everyone has an Other, and there’s no sure way to tell who your Other
Suddenly, there’s loud screaming and chaos, and Harry watches in horror as the servers suddenly start yelling at everyone to leave the restaurant
Sometimes it feels like Potter got all of their friends in the break-up, though Draco knows that the truth is that he just stepped back and stopped Flooing them and stopped taking their Floo calls. He doesn't want to know who they would have chosen, if Draco had made them choose by sticking around. And yet, it manages to hurt.
How does he even know that Potter has even lost colour vision at all? How does he know that Potter isn’t here to mock him for losing his Other? It would be just payback for all of their squabbles and disagreements during their time at Hogwarts.
“Draco? Are you ill? I know you're not sleeping, you've always been a light sleeper, so I know I must have woken you up by now…”
Draco nods. He has vague recollections of holding what he at the time thought was a warm stick, but must have been his mother’s wand.
Still, it kind of weirds Draco out; no matter how well he knows Potter and what makes him tick, he currently has no idea what he's even thinking. It's not the usual angry stare; that one Draco can basically

Draco feels stunned. He would never have guessed that his attack had so many other crimes hidden behind it.
He clutches Harry’s shoulders and tries to stop his own tears, even as he hears Harry repeat those words over and over again, like a mantra, like a man given the only thing he’s dreamt of and will never ask for anything else ever again.
He brings his notebook with him, hoping to find inspiration to write something—he used to like creating things— but no matter how long he sits there, even so long that the sun starts to go down, he has nothing but blank pages to show for it.
Pansy laughs. “Perhaps they simply haven’t mentioned it to you, darling? Perhaps that’s their little secret: they head off to the Château during the weeks.”
