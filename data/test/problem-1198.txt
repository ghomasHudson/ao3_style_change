“Even after the Potter house lost its ability to cast Battle Magic to the degree they had before, they were still sought out for the weapons of war. One of the greatest treasures in the pharaoh’s treasury is a sword forged with Mithril and inlaid with runes and gems. The swords abilities are numerous but its main ability to drain the magic of those whose lives it takes and store that magic in the gems, has made it a treasure here. It was forged by a head of the Potter family generations ago, before the family swore to Albion.” Alomar said.
“So, where’s Harry?” Neville jumped he couldn’t help it. Whirling around he found the smug smirk of Draco Malfoy staring back at him.
“That would be an immense pleasure.” Harry answered. With that the three left the patio ready for a day of adventure.
“Ok, so let me address the second one first. The great square was built on royal land, so it isn’t controlled or owned by anyone of the great families. For example, Longbottom Hall is one of the biggest open markets in the wizarding world with traveling shops that often switch out throughout the year. However, it is covered and protected by Longbottom wards, as long as you are not an enemy or have a quarrel with the Longbottom house you may come and go freely. The Potter docks are one such business area, at one end lies the Potter dockyard all along the southernmost section, with about four squares the size of the great square attached to the docks. Though instead of residential districts they have more warehouse and business districts, and you can find just about whatever you could legally want to buy for sale in the great square and in Knockturn alley a few not so legal items.”
"Among this year's first years only two could possibly be mis-sorted, one went to Gryffindor and the other Slytherin."

“Close, five generations, considering the political power they held at the time. Five generations that did not count toward the title advancement, but besides that five generations wherein house Malfoy almost lost their own title, with the entire mess with the Weasley clan happening at the same time. On top of that in the three generations before the house went into dormancy, the house of Malfoy had no spare heirs survive to maturity, that did not take up the mantle of Lord Malfoy themselves. Because of the dire straits the house fell into, the Alomora house fell into dormancy after only three generations.” Draco continued.
The past two weeks since his grandfather's return to England had been a change of pace for Draco. Over the past two weeks, his grandfather had forced him to go over and share every memory of the past four years at Hogwarts. His grandfather had pointed out every mistake and had drilled into his head what he should have done instead. His grandfather had been rather upset with Lucius for not teaching Draco proper etiquette and wizarding traditions. So much so that he had shown his displeasure by cutting his access to the family fortune from 15 million yearly to 5 million yearly, among other things that Draco had not seen, as Abraxas had sent him away and locked and silenced the doors of the study they had been in. However, by his fathers chastised look it when he had left, it had not been kind.
"Nor do I." Abraxas chimed in. "Care to be a bit more illuminating?"
"Well, firstly, I wish to claim the Potter Lordship by the Last of Line Clause as I am the last heir of House Potter. As such I wish for the Potter family grimoire to be brought to me, along with the ritual items of House Potter. I also wish to rent a ritual room for an hour prepared for the Rite of Awakening. After that we will discuss further."
“Agreed,” said Edward “there are more than a few good ones on High street along with some high-end shopping we can go tomorrow if you would like?” Harry nods, and they are then escorted to private bedrooms in the master’s wing of the manor. Harry calls Mimsy and asks her to draw him a purifying bath as he has a few rituals to do.
As he finished dressing, he added proper bearers’ attire onto his list of things to do today, but he suspected that that job would require a trip to High street as Madam Malkin’s would hardly carry such materials. Nor would she be able to craft robes fitting his station her shop just didn’t have the proper materials. Thinking of his now longer hair as well, a trip to High street would be necessary for more than one thing.
"Of course, be certain to inform your young charge of all the legal ramifications of this as well." Lord Le-Fay answered his wine-colored eyes following Harry as the three left the room, and Sirius apparate the three to Potter Manor. After they had landed Harry pulled away from Sirius spitting mad.
For the first time in 20 long years, Abraxas Malfoy had returned to England. Though most of the ICW seats belonged to individual countries, within the larger Magical Empires, as few monarchs still ruled, of the 300 seats on the ICW council 215 belonged to individual nations. A further 15 belonged to different guilds and such within magical society. That left the 32 ancestral seats, and the 10 royal seats. That left about 28 seats on the ICW that belonged to individual houses. These houses had strong international presences that required these seats 3 belonged to British families of Longbottom, Potter, and Malfoy seats.  At 25 Abraxas had dubbed Lucius well trained, and with the death of his beloved wife Melody, he left the Isles. He had gone to both focus on the International political scene, the ICW seat, but most of all to mourn his late wife without the constant memories entrapped in Malfoy Manor.

“I think that would be smart. I’ll take that test too.” Harry decided.
"Actually, Hermione no we aren’t. Queen Elizabeth and the Windsor family rule over the Mundane side of England and only the mundane side. Magical Britain, most of Europe and the Magical United states are all part of the Magical Empire of Albion. We are ruled, if we currently had a king, by the Utmost and Royal House of Pendragon with its head of house as our King. It's also part of the reason behind the statute of Secrecy. After the death of the last monarch in 1485, the Roman Catholic church saw a chance to grab power, and so they declared us to be witches though by their terms we are mages, something completely different. So, the witch hunts began and cumulated into the Spanish Inquisition and Salem witch trials of the fourteenth and fifteenth century. To battle this the statute of Secrecy was put into effect and it still stands today."

Vault 6589 – Heirs Vault
I must ask your pardon for my impolite imposition as to write you, without first being introduced but after seeing visions of you, growing ever more solid, for almost a year now, since the death of my husband. It has become clear to me that you are very important to the future of this Empire of mine.

Another 20 had been placed in the Intermediate group as they had, previously had some form of tutelage, and had some level with experience with a blade. They too had been given the bracelets but were only required to use them three times a week rather than nightly.
"As I have told you before Dumbledore, I am not your boy and I will be addressed by you and your ilk as Heir Potter. As to not attending classes I made that no secret, as you are well aware Miss Bones, exactly why I said what I did. You are treading a fine line on the path to blood feud Heiress Bones and this will be my last warning to you. As for you High Inquisitor if you wished for a smaller class size I'm sure the teachers would have done their level best to accommodate, you did not have to make illegal for more than three students to attend class at a time. It simply is a pity that to many students feel that being put into jeopardy of expulsion for merely trying to get to class is simply too much and have elected to skip classes until such a time as it is no longer dangerous to do so."
Draco nodded in acceptance.
By 6:45 Haldris, Alrick, Edward, and Corsair was ready to leave. They were leaving no chances for the Minister to mess up their plans.
“Well, I’m not sure, could you give me some advice?” Draco asked.
As his dizziness clears, he sees a grimy, dirty alley around him. “Settle down, we're in an alley about two blocks down from the Leaky.”
Harry woke up Sunday morning having had pleasant dreams and having had a few discussions with his two guardians that had soothed his anger from the previous night. He could have done without the wet and sticky sheets but that he supposed was a side effect of the first initial dream. He had however quickly showered and gotten dressed as he had to meet with his culture class group to work some more on the class project.
Sirius continues, with Neville including tidbits here and there as Harry sat listening, but taking the time to relax and ruminate over his earlier epiphany. Just because Marvolo had gained the title Lord Le-Fay did not mean he could use the full family magics. With Marvolo in residence, Hogwarts would be in danger because Grindelwald would wanting to test whether or not Marvolo could adequately defend the Le-Fay key, and if he couldn't, if he couldn't then, by Harry's calculations based on his grandfather's calculations, he only needed two other keys to completely unravel the seals.
"Harry, Harry, Harry, that was so cool." Tyler ran up excitedly chattering away about the night to Harry, with Marcus jumping in on occasion.
"Umm does the sorting hat do that often," asked Ron, "give warnings like that I mean."
Hogsmeade Village, Scotland
After Sirius arrived the day and the next passed quickly. With Sirius not leaving until Monday morning with a promise to return on Wednesday. There was to be an Order meeting that night and Sirius would be expected to be seen throughout the day, and the next to throw off any suspicion of anything being amiss.
"Both, I don't need a brownnoser I need a practical defense lesson so I can pass my owls, and Potions is the same, I can never tell if my Potions are actually that good or if he's just giving me a good grade because he's my godfather. This is OWL year it really decides how your viewed after school ends. What jobs you can do and all that jazz. My dad won't pay for the tutors but if I'm going to tutoring with another heir then I can pay it out of my trust fund. I really don't want to, but I sort of have no other choice." Answered Malfoy.
“All of them, for the most part, from what I remember where better than Alexandria and her brood, you may have to enforce the fact that you are the Lord of House Potter a little bit, but once you’ve got that across it shouldn’t be too difficult.”
“Well that would be excused.” Draco said nodding.
“and what is to keep me from killing you here?”
Draco and his Godfather entered the shop of one Serenity Collins. They were told to wait in the seats by the receptionist at the desk. A few moments after Serenity showed her last customers out and asked what they were here for.
That she may not ne repeated
“Very well, let us begin after all time is money. We at Gringotts have finished both the traditional accounting is done after the transfer of headship, and the items returned by the call have been sorted and accounted for, which would you like to cover first?”
"Yes, Lordsy Potter, the feast table has been set, the altar has been built. The circle has been arranged, your guests have arrived, and the maze adorns the lawn."
“Why aren’t we told this at school though,” asked Harry.
The house of Potter having had its manor attacked for several secrets the house had over a century earlier, had created a duplication charm set, so that the moment the main copy was damaged in the family manor seat, a new copy was created in the family heir library at the secondary house which had at that time been in Britain. This had meant that as the other Roman had scavenged and fought over the few remaining partial texts of Rome's magical tomes. The Potter family faded into the background making said tomes, and their very existence over the years a family secret. Over the years they had also purchased and collected many tomes that had not fared as well in the fires and had suffered the passing of time. They had restored these tomes and added them to the Potter family Library so that even though such tomes only accounted for less than a quarter of their Roman magical manuscripts they were known to have one of the largest collections of Roman magic in the world.
Turning to glare at both of their fathers. “You Vladamir speak of squalor, the only squalor I see is the dishonor you and your family have brought to this house. A bearer is to be treasured. For their magic is wild and connected to the land. They are at times capable of magic that not even the old magic cannot do. This marks two of the tenants of the house you have broken. First and foremost, we are protectors, we defend those who cannot help themselves. This has been the way of our house since it’s founding.”
Hogwarts, Scotland – Harry's POV
“Do you know who I am? Said the man standing before him.
Now funds of this type are usually sponsored by a single house, but other noble houses can add money to the fund as well. For example, the Wizarding Health fund, wherein common witches and wizards can ask the fund to help pay for major medical costs. This fund is funded by your donations to St. Mungo's Hospital. Usually these funds are nationwide and as such are managed by the ministry. They typically do not usually apply to the entirety of our magical empire. As the new fund set up by the Potters is for all of Albion not just Britain, I was curious. So, I sought out the head Goblin to get a copy of the charter for this new fund and was shocked!
He left us quite downhearted.
Children of his house where to be bound to others not of their choosing outside of his consent, or their consent. Harry calmed his raging magic pulling it in. Searching through Albions lands he quickly found said students within the ministry of magic, checking the magical signatures of those around them he smiled, a toothy smile that would have warned people to be wary. Very well if the ministry wished to play games the house Potter would no longer be as cooperative as they had been. Harry was past laying, they had overstepped their mandate, and he was done. The ministry and other houses were about to be reminded why the greater European houses chose not to rile the anger of his house.
~~~~~Power of Ancestral Magics~~~~~
“Well as you are not of Ancient status lord Cranston, nor even close I suggest you keep your nose out of the business of the eldest houses, you are here to witness the decision of the 13 of us, as House Potter and house Black must abstain from voting. It has long been held that the Eldest keep watch over their own, it was obviously a mistake to allow you younger houses to speak in Heir Potter’s trial as you all obviously need to return to finishing school. Once again you are of lesser rank, by the degree of King Arthur himself, the lessor does not judge the higher status man, for he knows not the responsibilities of that man. Even the King was only answerable to his advisor’s in the Ancestral houses not to even our elder houses, for we are lesser to them and they are the equals to the Royals.” Spoke lord Marshall.
With that said he got up and left the bank.
"Yeah Ignatius taught me about the Potters position and responsibilities in the Empire, I'm beginning to understand a bit more of why the house magic was so insistent I cast my aunt from the family. We were protectorates to the crown, family really, we trained them in the art of war, we shared some of our house magic with them even. It's help me understand why my dad's journals talk about growing besides Neville's dad and being raised as brothers but that there was always the feel of one missing."
“The Great Square is one of the Largest not family-owned magic centers. Now it does have a few different entrances from muggle London, the biggest two being the telephone booth at the ministry of magic and of course Diagon Alley. The others aren’t used much with most muggleborn not going past the northern side of Diagon alley once they hit the factory district past Gringotts they seem to stop, and they also never seem to pass the Leaky Cauldron heading the other direction and so never reach Horizont Alley, let alone get into High Street.”
"I'm not trying to undermine your power Head Investigator Smith, but if Grindelwald is once more at large then I have a responsibility to ensure that the people are informed. It is my responsibility to ensure that Albion is informed of it and prepared for the war his escape will no doubt bring." With that he turned seeing the ICW men cleared out raised his wand and muttered a spell under his breath. Andrew Smith had seen many powerful magics cast in his life but the gasp from the grizzled veteran behind him made him prepare for the worst, but he was not prepared for the spell to split after it had left the boys wand. Each stream of light split off again and found a piece of the once mighty fortress, they then floated those pieces into the air and then began to piece them back together. He stood gaping ten minutes later when the fortress Nurmengard stood once more in front of him whole again.
"Well, no but…"
"Some would ask if it is worth it to go through all that trouble of tracking the generations, I asked my own father if it would not be better if the nobility gained such titles by deeds and works than age. He answered me that it was not so much about the generations that past, but the family magic that they honored. But since you are so impatient to let me answer the questions you asked me earlier. Where are we? The answer is simple in your magical core, not the part you generally use in casting magic but what, for those with family magic is called the family vault. Look at the walls you see those vines, those are the houses of which you carry their magic. Most you will never be able to access, and right now, you cannot access any of them. The smaller the vine, the younger it was when it was absorbed into the family magic, of either your mother and/or your father."

"Ok, Sirius you want to come get me or discuss over mirror call?"
Late last Wednesday the DMLE was informed of alarms going off high and low at Azkaban Prison. The once thought to be impenetrable fortress suffered a massive breakout last night that saw 10 Aurors dead and another 10 suffering in the critical spell damage ward, at St. Mungo's hospital. Of the almost  three thousand and five hundred prisoners in Azkaban serving various sentences. Over half of them have been officially declared kissed as of this morning. See page 59 for list of the dead. Others remain at large, such as Rodulphus, and his wife Bellatrix and his brother Rebastan Lestrange remain at large. See an updating list of those that are still at large on page 72. Among the guards of Azkaban, the dementors where missing from their posts and the ministry has advised that you call the Auror's office immediately if you see either the escaped convicts or feel a sudden flash chill as that is the chief signal dementors approaching.
Let the Sorting now begin.
Harry returned to Privet Dr. 15 minutes before Petunia Dursley returned from Book Club at eleven o’clock, He walked through the door to grab his chore list.
After travelling down the pipe, a ways he found himself in an open room with a nest. Surprising Harry was the three eggs lying in the nest along with the two dead basilisks on the far side of the room. Summoning his elves, he had them take the two dead basilisks to the Dwarfs as well, and the eggs back to his study at Potter Manor.
“No pup and I admit they could have changed, but I believe you would have better luck looking to the American, French or Germanic cousins, I know the family distance is a couple generations larger, but they are family. I can't believe I’m going to say this, but Draco Malfoy will be far better friends than them, he at least offered a handshake, they would turn their nose up and treat you worse than he ever did for the simple fact that you are James’s son. I know you don’t want to hear it but masks up pup, just until we know for sure where everyone stands, who else of the cousins that you invited are here?
Draco walked over and finding a vine against the wall larger around than his wrist, with the silver gold flowers that Silas had spoken of grabbed it and with a flash of light he was gone again. Draco opened his eyes once more to find himself on a great field with a man walking towards him. Draco stood waiting as the man approached. The man got close and promptly sat down on the grass motioning Draco to sit as well.
“You are late boy,” snapped the Minister “take a seat we don’t have all day.” He said as he pointed at the prisoner's chair seated in the middle of the courtroom floor. Looking up and spotting Alrick he nodded towards him and sat. The chains rattled but stayed put.
The final lost branch of Roman Magic was one that house Potter was uniquely masters of. Roman Battle magic was second to none throughout the world, it could pull enormous feats of magic from its wielders, and more importantly had aided Rome in securing its empire. In the modern day Rome's battle Magic is more myth and legend, than fact but to this day some still speculated whether or not Saxon battle magic that Albion so prided itself with, could match up to its Roman predecessor.
“Interesting, but how do you know all this?”
Harry turned from the kitchen towards the entryway even as Petunia set to answer the door. “I’ll get it, Aunt Petunia,” Harry offered.
One of Alexandria’s older grandchildren sneered, “And what right do you have a little boy to speak to us in such a way. Go join the help; it is all your miserable common blood is good for, leave the talking to your betters.”
3. All marriage, betrothal and bonding contracts regarding the new heirs of these lines, must be signed by said head of the protectorate house and the new heir.
To which Harry answers, reading the Goblins Name tag, "May your gold grow and your weapons remain sharp, Teller Knarlfang I wish to meet with the Account Manager for the House of Potter sir."
Jean Marc having felt and seen Harry enter the room asked. “And what is his place, Lord Le-Fay.”

"Oh, pup you've met him, you've met our young prince" Sirius exclaimed.
"So, you are telling me that we are expected to learn just the theory and then we are expected to the spell for the first time the day of our owl exams, my apologies but who in this class can succeed in making a spell work the first time. That is beside the point that the Hogwarts charter clearly says that all wanded classes are to have practical lesson at least one class period a week after 3rd year, and it is heir Potter, Professor" Harry interrupted.
First my condolences on the trials you have been through in your short life. Even here in Egypt where it is so rare, we understand the sacrifices required for the rite of ancestry to activate.

Harry and company arrived at Kings Cross Station at 9 a.m., in a flurry of movement and activity. The morning had been relatively quiet so far as most of the Hogwarts students were already packed the night before. To Harry, it was a far cry from the frantic packing the morning of that he had seen so often from the Weasley's household.
~~~~~Power of Ancestral Magics~~~~~
“So, I did.” Draco looked around he saw on the walls so many more vines, vines that he could undertake the rite for an gain their power but looking down at the Emrys ring now sitting on his finger, Draco thought of the story the old man had told before making up his mind. “None,” at Silas shocked look he continued. “if I made power the strongest thing in my life, I could challenge every vine in this room and still not be satisfied. I would leave this room and become no better than Lord Le-Fay and my father who have hardened their hearts to reason and have focused their eyes only on power not seeing the consequences. I would make myself an enemy of a man that I love and that, that, is not what I desire. I desire to give our world peace again, to serve a just king that will think of others before his own desires. I want the house of Malfoy to be able to stand proud of their heritage, I want my sons to say that they come from an honorable line. No, I am done I have claimed what will be mine, the others, the others can be left for future descendants, their power is not mine and I desire them not.” Draco answered and the room went white and he closed his eyes again.
"On what charge," a question from the back was asked as the crowd parted revealing the current ICW head of education as well as the current head of ICW investigations. Harold Smith the ICW head of investigations spoke once more. "I will ask one more time minister, on what charges is Lord Potter to be escorted to Azkaban."
I look forward to your visit and welcome you to the Court of the Nile. May it feed you and bless you, despite the secrets held beneath her shores.
“So, Draco what are planning to do this break?” Daphne asked as the Slytherins settled in.

“Silas and Michalis Malfoy, Michalis was a bearer that found Silas favorable, I don’t know much about them beyond that. Father always told me it wasn’t history I needed to focus on, and that if I was truly interested, I could look through the family Grimoires after I became Lord Malfoy.” Draco answered.
“I’m pretty sure that this will count as a violent death, as I intend to fight that dementor to the last. Harry, I understand very well that I’m not supposed to be kissed until after Yule and the Solstice, but I don’t think the one’s behind this will wait that long, they’ve been planning for to long. I know you are going to be upset but I have known what they were planning since the planning went forward to trap the first gens. I simply saw you as more important, I’m sorry.”
"Perhaps if arrogant Gryffindor's knew how to properly treat their betters, and hand over what is rightfully theirs, Gryffindor would be much better off." Harry had written of Potions for the entire year.
"Shall I share with you what shall be your young nephews' fate once I am king of Albion Alexandria?" at her nod he leaned down and whispered all his plans for the house of Potter in her ear. Her cold laughter started the celebration. As the infectious laughter and joy surrounding the men and women grew, they celebrated with toasts and cheers, seeing once more their lords victory foretold in the skies, full of knowledge that his enemies knew nothing of his true plans, for who could tell the true plans of their master. After all, the only one who had known, hadn't even told his precious granddaughter before his death. What were the chances he had added it to a thing like the Potter grimoires chapter of secrets? A grimoire now held in the hands of one Haldris Potter.
Harry grunts, thinking over this news. As silence fell over the office, a knock at the door had both wizard and goblin jarring at the harsh sound.
“Merry met, Guardian.” Harry responded as silence fell throughout the room. Sobs from one of the first portraits to catch his eye. “Grandmother what’s wrong, please stop crying what’s wrong?” Harry almost begged not wanting to see her crying. The man from the portrait beside hers entered her picture and began comforting the woman as the Portrait labelled Charlus Potter spoke.
Another tradition was the tradition of seeking he had until the winter solstice to give his grandfather a betrothal contract or his grandfather would make one for him. The last and final tradition Draco had undergone just three days ago. The tradition of seeing was a controversial tradition in many families. At the age of 16, you went to a seer and had your future in a way told you. Draco hadn't known what to think when his grandfather had taken him to the seer who had only one classified false prophecy ever spoken, and most considered a broken prophecy as parts of that one had been fulfilled. Grindelwald had been defeated but whatever she had spoken of when she said that he would lose the war, but his final goal would see fruition, was a mystery to many and was the part people marked as false.
Harry spent most of Monday reading, going over the Potter finances and dealing with the basilisk eggs.
“So, to was Charlus Potter but one man. It is not his age my dear daughter in law but his status. If he is expelled this morning, the Wizengamot will have told every lesser noble and commoner that the power of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Houses is gone. That the family magic in our veins does not matter. In time Harry James Potter will grow up and if he is made aware of his station before Morvolo gets to him, even if he is expelled today he will return, and he will destroy the ministry for what they have done. Lucius and the others may have forgotten, but I have not, in time that boy will have the power to temporarily control the wards of Albion.” Abraxas said stress evident in his eyes.
“The old man said what?” said an eerily quiet voice from behind him.
"You children want to know the events that made up the Grindelwald war, the hidden parts, well sit down, I'm not bound by no ministry I'll give it to you straight. Dumbledore sit down and shut-up, you've ruled Britain with an iron fist for far too long, I've lived long enough, and seen enough of your damage that I no longer fear you enough to keep silent." The man calmly stated.
“We shall see won’t we,” said the first Auror haughtily.
Harry slept soundly the fearsome battle he had fought and the battle to keep his magic from lashing out tiring him out. Now the closect to truly wakening that he had been in some time, he was taking stock of what was going on around him. His magic was altered, it was different now then when he had last touched it before the battle, it confused him. Turning his mind from his magic he focused on the outside world, something told him that it two days had passed since the battle. He new by studying his magic that he had lost the ultimate battle in keeping it in control, he had however kept it from hurting anyone else.
"In the wizarding world a house or the family that you are born to, is critical. As a culture the wizarding world, treasures our past, as we treasure the actions and responsibilities of our forefathers. In wizarding society, we show this by giving respect to those that paved the way for us to be what we are today, we give them honor in many ways. The titles a house holds, can be reflected in how old they are, and how strong monetarily.”
“Yes, and according to my father, somewhere out their there is an heir Peverell, he just has yet to undergo the Blood Rites ceremony.” Alomar answered.
"Life the giver of all things we call to you know and ask that you join us." Harry then continued placing his last bowl he had on the floor in front of him, placing a black candle inside it and lighting the candle then spoke "Death that is the end of all things we call to you know and ask that you join us." With that both rose and first checking that each candle instead of having the traditional reddish orange flame now had a flame the same exact color as the candle, spoke in unison saying. "We thank thee for coming great one's that we may find favor in your eyes. We ask for a blessing if thou so see fit to give on that in the time to come, we may honor still the ones who have gone before." With this the two then turned towards each other pulling the ritual daggers then cut each other's fingers just enough that they bled. "In exchange for this blessing we give a sacrifice, of our blood and our magic, to even the scales that the offering be a blessing and not a curse." With that the two turned the hand with fingers now running with blood over and allowed a dozen drops of blood each to fall into each of the six bowls containing the candles. They then stood and dismissed those they had summoned with reverence and care.
"Marcus!" Harry's shout startles the room. "What is the cost of sharing house secrets without the permission of that houses head?"
Alomar sensing his confusion answered the unasked question. “The goblins are vassals of the Royal house of Albion as such, although they are permitted to bank in Egypt, but they are not the only ones. Gringotts here holds banking as a secondary occupation and the excavation of the Pyramids as the first, they are also responsible for aiding in a great many rituals here such as blood rites. That is why, I was so startled to hear you speak of them as being untrustworthy.”

“Peter Pettigrew”
"Wise words, if only they were correct the house of potter has no case to do so however." Says a new man as he emerges from the back of the room. "The house of Potter has overstepped its grounds only a house of Albion may make such a fund, as Harry Potter is a mere half-blood his house is no longer an Albion house, as such the fund will now be confiscated by the ministries, and the house of Potter shall be reprimanded in the next ICW meeting."
The man just nods "You are Haldris Potter Last heir and noble scion of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Potter. Now I assume you do not understand what that means so I will explain. Please wait until I have explained."
"Draco, my son, you should not put so much wait into what that seer said." Lucius Malfoy insightfully spoke. "Just look at me, if I had believed her prophecy and let it decide my fate, I would never have become as powerful as I am now. You have to remember that prophecy only has power when people believe in them, most predictions are self-fulfilling without any input from us as individuals."
"Well yes, of course House Emrys held around about a third of all vassals sworn to the ancestral lines which was required for a Most Ancient and Most Noble House to have for the first at least quarter century of being of that status. Somewhere usually after a house reaches that status the house magics takes a big jump in power and the aid of an ancestral house can stabilize it so that it doesn't affect the family overall magical status as bad. House Le-Fay held around half, and Evan Shade held the rest. Though Albion was considered unbalance because of this, it always seemed to work for our people's."

And treat them just the same."
“Enough Michalis, you know as much about the outside world as any of us, death warrant pssh, poppycock I tell you, and you should know better than yelling when we have not only the young heir here, but his friends as well.” A Picture said from down the hall. Draco though was unfazed and walked down to stand before Michalis’s picture. The other Slytherins also gathered around him.
"I chose the crystal ball that I may see what you see." Answered Draco.
"Well, as for certification of the authenticity of our bearers' marks, are here don't worry that's merely a copy they have been filed with both the ICW, and I have copies at both Gringotts, here in Britain and overseas, as well as in the family homes. As for the other I'm afraid they are non-negotiable, do not follow them and I will have you up on charges before the Wizengamot, and leave you to explain to the wizarding Populous why Harry Potter is the first Potter since the founding of Hogwarts not to attend the school, as I will immediately switching to Ilvermorny post haste. Now will you be opening the bearers' tower, or will I be leaving Hogwarts?" Harry stated fiercely.
Still I worry that it's wrong,
"If the charter had been removed then the founders magic in Hogwarts would have faded Hermione. No more hat, no points system, no sorting, no houses, none of it, Hogwarts can't function without the charter in place. The castle itself would transfer back to being Peverell lands if the Hogwarts Charter was removed." Replied Neville.

"You are to be the head of military affairs, you figure out where to place them, it's not my job to handle those things." Marvolo snapped. Before he could go any farther Neville stepped forward and asked.
For that is my writ and creed
“Not Guilty” spoke Sirius. Snorts were heard all around. “I’ve heard enough, let just vote we all know he’s guilty” was heard throughout the courtroom.
"Enough we can discuss this at a later time I assume you all came to help out, then let me give you your assignments, Viktor, Harry's group has finished the Northernmost wing and started on the easternmost wing you join his group when they return for another body dump as to the rest of you…" Smith gave out assignments to each one who had come with Marvolo and Dumbledore, even those that had come to merely gawk and see, such as the minister and Umbridge.
Harry deals with Sirius's death and a betrayal.
She was surprised however when she got to the library and saw both Harry and his new friends already working on writing their History of Magic essay along with Neville, and some of the new Gryffindors did as well. She was both surprised and slightly angered, how many years had she chided at Harry to get his work done before the due date, how many times had she jumped his case and tried to help, and now, now he decides to do it by himself.
Harry shook himself from his musings as he walked down the stairs to see the crowd of students gathered. Every student in this room was a Hogwarts student under either his, Neville's or Sirius's, protection through the inheritance fund. Along the walls stood mirrors connected to other rooms, at several other schools containing still more children under the houses protections.
The boys responded positively before retreating to the library for a joint study session, leaving the adults to argue.
“Now for business before we settle in. I am 15 as such I can not sit my seat on the Wizengamot, I would gladly have my godfather sit in the Potter seat as proxy, however, one cannot sit more than a single seat on the Wizengamot, and he must sit the Black seat. As such I would like it if Alexander would be the Potter family proxy working in tandem with Sirius. For Charles and Calix I wish for you to both jointly take up the Potter seats within Potter industries, with a 2.5% stake from the Potter shares each while you manage them over the next two years. For Raphael, I must ask that you take up managing the care and upkeep of our many estates that are rented and leased throughout the magical empires. Jean, I have been made aware of your status in the French ministry I wish for you to remain, for you Apolline, House Potter holds a seat on the ICW, please vote this seat until I am permitted to do so. Lastly, Mercier, my job for you, will be house wide, I need you to contact all the many Potter vassals within Albion and outside it, see what they need, give them help where needed, reprimand them if also needed.”
Neville continued. "If you had been thinking as a king you would also have thought of yourself as well, addressing me and giving me orders to increase the Royal guard as to give you better protection could have earn you an additional point, however you did not even consider doing such a thing."
"What do you think the boy is talking about Abraxas stuff and nonsense. He's just trying to get out of trouble now that he knows he's caught." Snape sneered.
Draco wakes and blinks his eyes open as he sits up. He finds himself in a cylindrical room with no visible door. Along the wall’s vines grew of varying shapes, types, and colors. Each vine had a specific flower growing from it, some gave off light that shined throughout the room. Draco turned looking at the other side of the room and found himself face to face with a man he recognized.
"Don't pretend you care about anything that's happened to Harry Madam Bones, he doesn't want you pity. When Harry asked for aid in charging Dumbledore for these crimes over the summer you denied him said right as he was a minor and was obviously lying. You criticized Harry when he informed you that he would move forward and present his case to the ICW, if you did nothing then, why is it now you want to help him. I can't believe your hypocrisy." Ron snapped out.
Nicodemus, stepped forward interrupting the proceedings before they could fall farther into chaos and discord. “Returning to the true matter at hand, you may be head of house Le-Fay, but the house magics have not accepted you, nor have they bonded to yours, Marvolo. Furthermore, Minister if you continue in the path you have chosen, I have no doubt you will be silenced by the wards. Your greed has shown your true face and will be your undoing, it is very obvious to me and to several others that instead of thanking the one who saved us from Grindelwald already once in the past few days, you have chosen only to belittle and subjugate, you are nearing a point of being forced to face a vote of no confidence I suggest you remember that.”

“It is nice to meet you your majesty, I am Neville Longbottom, and this is Haldris Potter. What did you mean that, it is because Albion is without a king?” Neville asks.
"The paperwork for the dissolution or stripping of stock for the majority owners of the daily prophet, for the slandering of the Lord and head of House of a Most Ancient and Most Noble House. This time next month your company will either have new owners or will be shut down." Harry who had kept walking as he spoke now stood in front of the reporter and the rest of Marvolo's group.
"I think we should go ahead and start Sirius could be a little while longer if you remember he did say that the session for today was supposed to be over by two but that if something came up, he would be longer, let's go."
“By order of the crown of which you are vassals, all Goblin made artifacts created in the name of a formal house do not apply to this law. So why might ask to have artifacts commissioned by house Potter returned when by goblin and wizarding law they belong to house Potter?” He asked as he leveled a cold glare at Sharptooth.
After the bombshell Sirius had informed them of, the three separated each going their own ways to burn off some of the anger, they were feeling at the current situation with an agreement to meet for dinner at six-thirty. Neville went to the greenhouses to burn his anger off by battling and experimenting with the plants. Sirius went to the dueling room to cool off battling several opponents at once. Harry first went to the fencing room and exhausted himself fighting four opponents at once, before retreating to his room to take a nap once exhaustion set in. If he was able to meet with one of his guardians that was merely a bonus in his mind, maybe then he could start brainstorming.
Harry shoos both younger boys and the other students below fourth year to their dorms before giving his goodbyes and retiring himself. Leaving a room full of curious minds behind him. Curious as to the answers to the questions asked, and curious as to the relationship between Harry and Marcus, that Marcus would know Potter family secrets.
"Not exactly but close, I am called a guardian, and I will not be the only one you have. I will teach you, as will others, in your dreams but we will also watch you in your waking life and expect you to honor your family's legacy by putting our teachings to good use. We can give advice, as we can also guide you in other things." James responds.

"I don't get it." Tyler answered.
Draco had come before classes as he did not wish to miss classes today and tomorrow was a joint 5th, 6th, and 7th year merged History and Culture Saturday class, that was also a free discussion period for the most part of their four-hour long class period. It spoiled any plans they had for the weekend, but Draco was oddly ok with it as he was looking forward to the discussion. He thought as he returned to Hogwarts, besides he wanted to get a second opinion on whether or not to undergo blood rites.
“His place is the same as all those beneath me, groveling in obedience and not challenging those better than they.”
"Harry, Mum and Dad love you and said to tell you that they were proud of you, but that there is more going on than you think. You need to visit the department of mysteries and have a blood prophecy search. It will bring forward any prophecy that pertain to you. You must remember that a prophecy can usually be broken as easily as it is made, except if it is a prophecy that pertains to a convergence point, some things simply must come to pass. I can only give you one more warning or I tempt the punishments of the fates. Your main enemy will neither be our parent's killer nor the meddler, he has yet to reveal himself but is well known to our recent family past. I love you, big brother and look forward to watching you turn into the man you are destined to be." With that Alexia Potter faded as the morning sun rose.
"Good Morning, Everyone!" He says, "Hestia aren't you supposed to be watching Harry?"
"Albus Dumbledore don't you start your lies and manipulations, that registry is public for anyone to see, I am more interested in why you obviously sent the boy to what was to be and no doubt looking at him was an abusive home, without the consent of either his parents will's, or the ministry of Magic?" Madam Bones stormily asked.

"I'll be dealing with Russia no doubt sooner than later, the recent letter regarding Artemis notwithstanding. On to other matters, I know that you and Andy are also working through recent laws passed by the Wizengamot since the last monarch was on the throne any severe one's we need to immediately deal with before it comes back to bite us?" Harry asked.

"Now I understand that Binn's mostly lectured straight from the book, I will not, I will be expecting you to have read the next chapter of our book for Monday's class. We will then spend Monday going over what all you need to know in the chapter and Friday mornings class we will be having open discussion of the different things we have covered in said chapter and tying them into previous chapters. I will have that time open for you to ask questions."
“Good morning fine sirs, are you ready to dine for the morning meal, Prince Alomar and several of his guests have gathered on one of the dining Patio’s and have invited you both to dine with them if you are interested.” The boy said.
~~~~~Power of Ancestral Magics~~~~~
The next few minutes the four ate with the friendly conversation happening throughout the meal until all were finished and the dishes were cleared, and the house-elves thanked.
The magic of Rome was such that you couldn't just cast the spells by reading the old tomes, you had to have knowledge of the magics of Rome, understanding of the theory of these magics had to come first. A teacher was required to properly learn the magics, and to understand the convoluted theory that was half stated and half expected for you to understand. The question of who had enough mastery to teach it had allowed the magic to fall into disuse and become a lost branch of magic. Harry was now being taught by his guardians said magic, as although it was never to be used outside of the family lands, the house of Potter was one of the few that still new how to use the Roman magics.
Harry read through the letter once and then read it through again. The crown prince of Egypt had only been crowned recently; it had caused great controversy as he was not the oldest of his father's almost forty children from almost a dozen consorts. Alomar had been one of the youngest of the king's children, but he had proven himself well, outmaneuvering his siblings to gain the favor of the people if not the court. His father saw this and when the time came to choose an heir, he was chosen much to the dismay of the other heirs and of the court who had thrown their support behind other older princes. Harry supposed it would not be bad to have further allies in the greater international world. Picking up the envelope the letter had come in Harry paused, the envelope was heavier than expected. Lifting it Harry, emptied the envelope finding the two portkey emblems that the letter had spoken of, but also came another few pieces of parchment. Opening the parchments, he found another letter.
The Minister blubbered incomprehensively for a moment. “Very well Harry James Potter you are hereby charged with the breaking of the underage use law, along with breaking the statute of Secrecy.”
What they could not
Sincerely
And I know the story for I was there
Draco pauses to take a breath and sip a drink of water, before continuing. " After fiver generations of house status, the house is given the title of honorable, but is still a common house. The house title of the commoner houses are Honorable, Most Honorable, Elder and Most Elder. At the time that they gain the title of Most Elder House they are at 12 generations since the creation of the house, or about 330 years old. The Noble class begins with the granting of the title Noble, at 15 generations or 420 years old. At this point they are also granted there first seat in the lower court. The low court only holds 40 seats for the Noble houses, so they are rotated each year, as there are more than 40 actual Noble houses. At thirty generations they are given the title of Ancient. Ancient and Noble houses hold two seats on the lower Wizengamot. As the Wizengamot only holds 50 available seats they to rotate."
"What do you know of the legacy of your family, of the family magic, of the history of your lineage, of your power in our world? What do you know of our traditions of our victories of our defeats? Do you know of anything of the family, of your legacy of your responsibilities in our world?"
"My boy surely we can discuss this." Answered Dumbledore.
Showing Sirius, the ring Harry replies. “I’m not heir Potter. I’m Lord Potter.”
~~~~~Power of Ancestral Magics~~~~~
“It is.” Answered Harry. She gave her oath. Harry moved his new bangs away from his scar.
Harry having enough answered in a calm voice. “No, they are here to pick me up and be my escort throughout the alley today, and if all goes well it will be the last time, I ever step foot into this house. Now I’m going to go open the door and invite them in, then we are going upstairs and fetching my trunk, and we are leaving, if luck is on my side, then I will never have to see you again.”
"I want more, maybe not outright friendship, I understand it will take time for that, but I want, I don't want to be your enemy anymore, allies maybe? I don't know, I just know I don't want to be ignored by you, it's why I made such a big deal about things in the first place. I grew up with stories about you in both forms of cursing and in praises. I only ever wanted nothing more than to be your friend, I mucked that up and swore I wouldn't be ignored, so I became your rival." Draco said imploringly.
"Indeed, we will go into the nuances of gaining the different upper titles around Samhain, now let us continue with the next questions pertaining to the lower titles that do not have Wizengamot votes." The remaining class period flew by for Harry, with the class ending with them being given the weeks homework. As they left for dinner even Harry could say he was excited to see what the school year had in store for them.
"Second loophole, Grandfather, is in the words three or more students. My study group for your class's homework consists of eight people, without asking the high inquisitor for permission to reform our group, we either A) do not finish the group work and fail the assignment or B) do the group work as a group get caught by the wrong teacher, and have the threat of expulsion over our heads for our regular meetings to complete our assignment."
"Draco, that is not…" Abraxas attempted to corral his grandson.

"From the South we call the element of Fire will you please now join us?" with that he set the bowl in the southern section of the circle and placed the red candle that had been sitting there in the bowl before then lighting it. The two then turned to face the west and Harry spoke

“Yes, here it is as are the papers about other such items.”
Harry leaves the Dursleys for Gringotts.
He is brought from his musing by his fireplace going off with request for someone to floo in. His mind lost in thought as he mindlessly approved the request. There was no doubt that those two dragons that Alistair had spoken of had finally opened an eye, they weren't awake yet but would be all too soon. No, he wouldn't move against them, not yet, let the ministry and Wizengamot allow them to sharpen their claws, it would allow him, to tame their fire when the time came. Dumbledore was drawn from his thoughts as his floo once more went off and the ICW head of Investigations stepped out requesting the presence of several teachers as well as students. The severity and grief on his face had Dumbledore immediately complying. Dumbledore quickly sent massages to the students knowing that the mood Mr. Smith was in would see him in hot water if he obstructed the man's work in any way. As the men waited for the others to arrive, Dumbledore patiently waited hoping this would not be a repeat of what had happened on Monday. Albus shivered slightly remembering the pandemonium that had brought. That had been a nightmare of Epic portions that had reverberated throughout the week, in both the school, and the social and political fields. When the door open and in walked, Neville Longbottom. Draco Malfoy, Abraxas Malfoy, Lord Le-Fay who was staying at the school, Lucius Malfoy, several other teachers, and Harry Potter, Dumbledore only marginally relax understanding the tensions in the room.
Almost an hour later, the room was deathly quiet as Harry blinked his eyes awake and slowly sat up. He stretched and, as he did, surveyed the room once more. The floor jolted the warmth from his feet as he tentatively made his way to a bowl of water propped on a table in the corner. He hissed as he came into contact with the cold water and worked the cloth up and down his arms. Then he made quick work of cleansing the blade, after which he carefully tucked it back into the ritual box and got dressed. Harry was somewhat confused; everything had gone as it was supposed to until the end, and then he passed out. Had he done it wrong? If so, then what had he done wrong? Thinking back, he couldn’t think of anything that could explain what had happened. Nothing made sense. With a shrug he settled on asking his guardian later. After he was dressed and all traces of blood were gone, he stepped out of the ritual room and addressed the goblin that had been standing outside the door. “Greetings goblin. May your gold grow and your weapons be ever sharp. Would you be able to escort me back to Sharptooth’s office?”
"I am lord and head of house Potter, commander of the armies of Albion, and Albions first and last line of defense. And you are ordering me to have the wards of Albion release this miscreant that dares to raise a threat against the empire my line has sworn to protect?"
"I suggest you hope he thinks the same" said a man coming up from behind him trailed by a middle aged lady with jet black hair and a severe face.

“The hall in front of them opened up into a humongous room with a grand staircase sweeping up both sides, with many hallways be leading from it. This be the Grand staircase leads to second-floor grand ballroom through those doors.” She said pointing to the 4 sets of ornate double doors at the top of the stairs. “It is 5000 sq ft and is the smaller ballroom, it has been the only one used since Albion has been without a king. The Kings royal ball once held here annually was done in the 15000 square ft Ballroom in the back to accommodate the almost 10000 people who attended. It has since been placed in storage.”
"Nonsense," said Delores. "The ministry sanctioned blood Rites as classified to those in the know over a century ago. Besides its bound to be a pureblood the titles pass to the muggle-borns need never know of it."
“Very well Madame Bones,” said Harry slightly angry at her betrayal of the long-held family alliance. “I have no problem taking my case to the ICW.”
"I will, how goes the hunt for your traitors Griphook?" asked Harry.
“The great square?” asked Harry.
“Now perhaps you can tell us who you are, young man?” One of the gentlemen asked.
"Indeed, you are right I gift both the heirs Potter, and Zabini, and Lord Longbottom ten points each for common sense and knowledge of the traditions and laws of the Wizarding World."
"I will be along as soon as breakfast is finished and the students have been settled, seeing me will no doubt help in assuaging their fears." Marvolo answered.
Draco and Harry bow to each other as Draco returns to his seat. “Now I must address my fellow members of the Most Ancient and Most Noble houses. As heir of the House of Potter, magical godson of the heir of House Black, I demand that the trial transcripts for my Lord and Head of House be brought forward.
“You are not the regular shadow of a persons true self, hidden away in a painting you are the true Consort Malfoy, of your time.” Marvolo observe the question hung unanswered in the air silencing all the adults as the students remained carefully silent.
After his letter writing was done, he picked up the how-to book on how to work the shelves behind his desk. After reading he quickly summoned the Albion law books from the Head of House Library. Last night James had spoken of the levels of laws in Albion, and Harry felt like he needed to know more. Picking up an older book on the levels of laws written about 350 years before he began to read.
"Thank you Mimsy, that will be all, is there anything I need to know before I go down." Mimsy shook her head and popped away and Harry walked carefully down the stairs still dressed in all black. As he and Neville, walked to the ballroom where the guests waited, they talked about a few things.
"I can, what are you think of doing, Lord Potter?" Smith asked.
"To this day it is unclear why Grindelwald acted as he did, why he attacked. It wasn't unusual for Grindelwald to go after families, to go after houses but this, but what he did that day, it was different. At the time I was a senior auror, we were called in after the deed was done. At that point I had considered myself a seasoned Auror, but upon apparating in even I was sick. It was called the Potter massacre for a reason. Of the over a thousand people who had been there none survived. House Potter was left only to those that had left for the rite. Henry Potter, Charlus's father and the then Lord Potter very obviously was killed last and it showed. But he wasn't the only one who had been tortured, all those that had been at the picnic, had been brutally slaughtered from the youngest to the oldest."
“Oh, pup I wasn’t there for so much and then never expected you to want me to be your dad.” Seeing Harry’s hesitance and his surprise, he continued. “It doesn’t have to change anything, you don’t have to call me dad.”
"I'll floo call the tutors I had contacted earlier and tell them it's a definite thing. They will be there Monday morning. The second thing was?"
"Pardon me, I was reading," he answered her, "I heard neither the question nor the response, nor do I care, as no doubt I will be reading the entire thing verbatim in the paper tomorrow. Beside I would think your lot would be avoiding me and mine like the plague considering the paperwork that was filed about half an hour ago."

Harry had just finished writing the last name onto his last letter of the third group, when the bell signaling the end of second period rang. He quickly grabbed his books for both Charms and Transfiguration and headed for Charms class.
“What price?” Neville tentatively asked.
“What price?” The magic tentatively asked the warmth.
Harry almost jumped out of his seat not realizing he had already sat down. He really had been too lost in his musings. "Sorry long night and an already long morning with more meetings to come today, what was your question?"
Lord Zabini merely snorted from behind them all before speaking, "the message isn't for you, Lord Malfoy. Rumor has it that the Evan-Shade Potter grimoire is more than a simple grimoire passed down from generation to generation. It doesn't carry the usual family rules, secrets and spells. That grimoire if the stories are accurate contains the exact plans, thoughts, and maneuverings of Ignatius Potter, the man who single-handedly carved out and secured the Potters both Dragon's Moor and the position of chief Commander of Albion's armies, but also ensconced them far enough into the politics of house Evan-Shade that three centuries later, they were the only house to free themselves from vassalage to that house without consequences. Even the house of Slytherin has not done that."
“Potter manor rooms move. In Lordy private office there be a model of the manor with all rooms currently out next to it is all the rooms currently in storage, in wizzy space. It keeps rooms clean and keeps people out when not needed. Potter Manor has over 150 rooms in storage.” Harry quietly nods think that over. She points to the hallways on the right side. “Through those doors be the 1st and 2nd Wings of the Manor containing the 150 guest suites. We have 50 – single-bedroom suites, 50 three-bedroom suites, and 50 ten-bedroom suites. Theys can bes divided or separated as wes need by the model in Lordy private office.”
“Well. Let me know what set and we can discuss replacing it, Neville.” Harrys said walking away from the curse breakers that had grown from two to six and where now pulling out wands and maps of the pyramid. “Our friends say that they were missing a section of this pyramid but could not find a passageway to it, it seems we just did.”
“Semantics boy,” sneered Amos Diggory. “We care not, let us just get on with the case. He is very obviously the boy, we can all see the scar.”

"So, you never answered the question this morning, how does a house become a protectorate and what's the protectorates job Harry?" asked Hermione. Most of Gryffindor table went quiet at her question wanting to hear his answer. As Harry spoke this silence would spread to the other tables.

This spawned a two-hour long discussion on the royal charges for each house and what it meant in this day in age. With the fifth, sixth, and seventh year students of other houses joining the Gryffindor table for discussion.
"Short and concisely but yes. When the day came for Arthur to truly be crowned, after peace had been found, Arthur followed the tradition that many others followed and performed the ritual of ascendancy. He asked the land for approval to rule over its people. The land accepted the people's choice, but only after he had passed her tests. Albion tested him, and he survived, furthermore he passed the tests, it's one of the reasons Albion's wards are so strong. The wards are backed by the very magic of the land."

After a back-breaking afternoon doing chores Harry was escorted inside and ordered to cook a fantastic meal. As if that wasn’t difficult enough, he had to change into a waiter’s uniform and wait on his aunt, uncle and their guests all evening. It was much later that night after everyone had gone to sleep that Harry once more entered his core room for more lessons on the past, and the culture, rules and etiquette of the magical world.

As Harry walks through the alley, he can't help but notice the glares he receives and the daily prophet headline once again questioning his sanity.
"Anywhere else?" Harry probed.
A Goblin at the door turned at the door and sneering said. “It would behoove you wizard to remember common curtesy when walking in Goblin halls. It would take little effort to cut you down.”
“Who was?”
“Wow,” said Harry as the sun shone on the horizon.
“He is here,” said Alrick escorting Sirius in, much to the shock of the Wizengamot who was surprised that Harry’s words were not a bluff. They were also surprised by Lord black’s attire, he was dressed in form-fitting formal robes, was clean shaven, and his hair was immaculately styled. This was not what they expected from the Azkaban escapee, that had been on the run for almost two years.
Harry and Neville both arrived in Memphis Egypt at six o’clock in the evening Egyptian time. After leaving the train station at three, the constant spinning from the portkey for the last two hours and the hour time difference between Egypt and Britain had at first confused the two before it was explained to them.
“Well, yes, it is, but it’s also known that the myth that a necromancer can reverse the kiss is a lie as well.” Neville answered.
“It was simply is one of those things that students are supposed to get naturally curious about or some such nonsense.”

“Well, I’m spending my break with Harry, we received an invite to a celebration overseas that we couldn’t exactly say no to.” Neville answered.
"My condolences, my sweet on this most disheartening day. May your day spent in memory, honor your family well." Viktor said as he handed Harry a fully in bloom black mourning rose. The other heirs echoed Viktor's sentiments and handing Harry a black rose as well before Harry and Sirius silently left the hall.
“Ok, I can understand now what kind of disguise,” he asks.

"Well sort of the same thing, you now the rundown Hotels on High Street, and Phoenix Boulevard?" Harry asked.
"I see" Dumbledore said his eyes showing his fury at being undermined in front of all those present. "Well than I will see to it that the tutors have proper accommodations for the duration of their stay here. Now Delores I believe you have a class to teach, and you students I suppose have a break until a room can be found."
"What shall I do with my troops once they are mobilized, shall they be stationed only at the local bases or shall they be moved to strategic points around the empire?" Harry asked treating this as a real issue.

“Yes Headmaster, it seems he entered the alley about 9 o’clock and left about 11 o’clock. He visited the 3 bookshops for Owl Order Catalogs and Gringotts assumedly for money. However, most of his time today was spent within Gringotts.” Answered Kingsley.
This sudden reintroduction of battle to the field had been the key that Grindelwald needed, it had broken the ranks of that he and his classmates had created to defend the castle. Looking around as he ducked, weaved, dodged and returned spell fire Harry was beginning to lose hope, even Marvolo's marked were being pushed back. With every minute that passed the defenders were being pushed back towards the castle, without the wards Harry could see little chance of victory. Harry looked to his right and immediately broke into a run seeing Neville pinned by two older lieutenants of Grindelwald's army that had fought in the Grindelwald war. Pushing Neville out of the way, he barely missed being hit by the spell that had been sent at Neville himself.
Albus watched as the doors to the great hall were slammed open and several ministry representatives, several Wizengamot lords, and Lord Le-Fay entered the room. They were escorting a gentleman and his entourage. A gentleman that Albus recognized. Albus made to rise before the department head of international affairs spoke up.
Harry had also with James’s guidance come to realize that his actions on the train, before his first year had not been proper for his house or for his station. His wardrobe had and was an issue as well, one that much easier to correct than the social faux pau that he had committed in refusing Malfoy’s hand. At James’s prompting he had contacted the Potter house guard who had directed him to the Potter family hit wizards for a protection detail as he went through the alley today. He had quite a few things to pick and more to fetch, along with his trip to Gringotts. Most exciting of all though for the day was the fact that Harry was leaving the Dursleys today, forever. As he had talked over with James the night before as a lord he had the right to choose where he wanted to live, as putting on the headship ring had legally emancipated him.
"Harry my boy I am very disappointed in you."
In doing so the minister has given the High Inquisitor the duty of ensuring that Hogwarts is teaching to the proper guidelines. That all teachers have appropriate credentials to be teaching at Hogwarts and to enforce several other rules that the Ministry intends to enforce later in the coming months. For more Information see page 3.
"That will be 30 points from Slytherin and a Detention with me tonight. Along with an essay on why that word should not be used and you will keep writing until I am satisfied with it."
"You trusted him that, that was all his spell did," screeched Madame Umbridge from behind them all, "That boy is an insane, attention seeking liar, who no doubt has hidden the body of Grindelwald away from everyone just so he can claim another dark lord is back just as he claimed Voldemort was back, that boy should be locked up…" She was stopped by the wand of a grizzled looking man standing next to Smith.
“That one is a bit different, lay back, and close your eyes.” Simon said. Draco did as asked and when he opened his eyes a moment he was in a different place.
“Well, I say that when you go to the Ministry on the 10th, I will have to charge people with attempted line theft and the murder of a scion of an old family.” Said, Harry. “Would you three be willing to accompany me.” All three nod. “Very well I suggest we leave early I suddenly don’t feel like it will be with Madam Bones or that it will be at 10am. I also believe I will need a Solicitor.”
"Do you know the answer Abraxas, because before I spoke with my Blaise I didn't, though oddly enough your grandson did? Greengrass made the argument that it was an impossible question because of the unsaid requirements that were attached to the titles of Utmost. Not being sworn to an ancestral house chief among them. My Blaise commented that almost every house was sworn. When asked to name a house that was not sworn by Miss. Parkinson none, but Draco gave an answer, House Potter. House Potter fulfills the unnamed requirements of holding positions 'being named' in the king's courts. They also have terminated the contract they held with the house of EvanShade, as such all unsaid requirements are fulfilled."
“Harry, Tonks said as you no doubt know that Sirius wasn’t to be kissed until after the Solstice so what happened?” Neville asked his Anxiety getting the better of him. He watched as Harry’s fists tightened, anger was visible throughout his form and through gritted teeth he answered.
“An interesting choice of words, considering it is a blatant lie, Artemis and Arsenio I assume, please come here. Sirius, will you do a health check, please?” As the two stepped forward, Harry motioned for Alrick to come to him as he also had Mimsy bring forward the book of family rules, along with the laws of Albion. After getting a grimace from Sirius, Harry took the offered papers scanning them over, quick touch to an arm a piece also informed him that they carried the Albion diamond and Lilies.
"No", Harry answered. "I'm not just going to give you Albion."
“Oh, pup the Rite of Ancestry, I’m sorry I should have been there.”
"Harry James Potter that is cheating, and the prompts aren't wrong from her point of view." Snapped Hermione, stepping into the conversation.
However, though the two in front of her bear the same markings, they were dressed in a more stylish but in far less lavish apparel. Curiosity got the better of Harry, so he stayed watching the room, those who figured out who he was nodded to him respectfully but gave no other outward evidence that they knew who he was or that he was their head of house. Watching Alexandria was angering for Harry. She was cruel and spiteful it seemed to everyone in the room except her immediate family, and even then, the two youths from earlier were exceptions to the rule. Quickly accessing the family magic, he was told that they were both strong bearers, but they though old enough to carry (A bearers carrying age was 13.) Health wise they were more akin to Harry. It told Harry that the dishonor paid went much farther than skin deep. But more than that it was how she spoke of him, her nephew she had never met calling him a shame and a disgrace to the family, consorting with mudbloods and half breeds. She spoke of many things but mostly disparaging of both his parents and grandparents’ decisions, whether it be in business or the path of the House. She criticized that they had fought on the wrong side of both the war with Grindelwald and with Voldemort and how Grindelwald would have been such a better King, than the Ministries they had to deal with. This caused Harry’s anger to spike thinking of his last lesson on family history.
"Are there anymore instructions you would give?" Harry asked.
Deciding that the power he could gain would outweigh the vulnerability he would place himself under, it was the last and most important requirement of the ritual gave him pause. Blood Rites could only be done at specific times of the year, the Sabbat days: February 1, March 21, May 1, June 21, August 1, September 21, October 31, December 21. As it was September 1st the closest day to do so was in three weeks, he would have to decide September 21st or October 31st. November 1st however was the start of the next set of Wizengamot sessions. So, September twenty-first would be best day for the Rite to be performed.
"Our family history, spells hidden in the family Grimoire, traditions, culture, things you will need to bring the family magic from the brink of extinction and of course how to use the family magic, among other things." James answers, his mouth curled up in a smile.
“Please, find your places, it is time to begin.” Grinholt said to the assembled. As the three split Grinholt could not help but think that in those three he was seeing a new generation rise.
Harry turned now and truly looked at Michalis, wanting to see his face as well as his words Harry’s anger partially fading, causing Michalis to pause his story and allow him to settle. “You have to understand Harry, that the politics of that time where still very cutthroat. Some like the house of Potter that I had been born into where hardly touched by the change in politics at the time. But the house of Malfoy had been on the outer fringes of those houses protected by the king for a long time. As the king’s head diplomat they worked closely with the king but they were not trusted by others at court. Many saw house Malfoy as a weak link that aided in the death of the king. In the cutthroat political world of that time it was a difficult position and those who saw their station as above what it was chose to exploit a perceived weakness.”
"Potter," interjected Ron before anyone else could speak. "They already have been titled by the Royal house; they are the commanders of Albion's armies. They have if I'm doing my math right already achieved the 1800-year requirement for the title, I don't know about the vault part for the title of Utmost Noble though."
“And the house of Potter has many homes and investments overseas, we don’t have to bank with Gringotts and nowhere in the treaty does it state that a British born wizard must bank with Gringotts, just that Gringotts is the only bank allowed in Magical Britain.”
“Well, a few questions if you don’t mind?” Mimsy just nodded expectantly. “Where have you been, and what are you doing here?”
Allies, long-held, now betrayed
Ravenclaw ~ non-heir ~ Blood locked
Harry and Neville split up at the apparition point with Neville returning his home, while Harry invited Sirius to stay at Potter manor and to help introduce Harry to all of the family that was currently arriving at the manor.
“I like your choices. How soon can you have them done?” Harry asked.

"It was why so many tried to marry into your houses. They wanted to know more about the true process of succession. The how's, the why's, all of it." A Ravenclaw seventh year commented.
"Don't be silly Harry, we're all still English, we're all subjects of the queen, it isn't like we belong to a separate country when you have magic." Chided Hermione.
Harry opening his eyes, nodded. Not trusting himself to speak. “I understand your anger, sit allow me to tell you a story. I was born just after the death of the last king. It was a time of political strife and turmoil, but the house of Potter persevered. When I was married into the house of Malfoy it was a cause of much joy and celebration. I honored him as he honored me, and my other two bonded were more than happy for him to be head of our family. I was married at the age of 15 and carried almost 8 children in the next twenty or so years. I saw three of my children bonded themselves before tragedy struck our family.”
"And you your ravens Filius?"

"I want the brat that stripped me of everything I have built over the past forty years, to be ground beneath our heel, I want him to suffer for want he has done, I want him to lose everything just as I have lost everything." Alexandria replied with a shark like grin.
"Yes, Lord Potter I must ask do you intend to undergo blood rights?" Griphook asked.
“It has to be something to do with you becoming Utmost right?” Daphne comments, the Slytherin wanting to understand too much to hide her desire.
Difference that first brought friendship
“We’ll about that…” Draco started.
“Yes, young Harry it was. Michalis said, “as Dragon’s Moor’s magic awaken before we did, I can only suspect a time of war is at hand. As such I have much to teach you, both for the Potter house and of your status of bearer.”
Zivan Abelev			Hogwarts Year 2
"Madam Auror Tonks as an Auror you have a copy of the full list of magic hating muggle's with authorization to know about our world correct? Could you bring it out and look for the name Dursley?" Harry interrupted Dumbledore to addressing Nymphadora Tonks standing in the back of the room.
“Yes, my lord I will owl order the clothes as they finish. I will do several of the formal robes first as you will need a selection to choose from on the 10th. Thank you for your business and have a great day.”
Madam Umbridge Senior Undersecretary to the Minister sat in the office of the Minister they along with Lucius Malfoy, and a few other trusted advisors had been discussing a few things to lessen the headmaster control of his students. They now had a solid plan. She would be appointed high inquisitor, and then she would have the rights and power to place even Potter into her detentions for his nasty lies. The filthy half-blood wouldn't be so high and mighty then. She turned back to the conversation where Lucius was bemoaning the interference of the Potter and Black seats in the Wizengamot.
Seeing that about half an hour had passed, he then began by writing each family with children not yet in school a letter, inquiring about the welfare of the child, their schooling, and such things, as was his responsibility as head of house. For the most part this was one standard document that went out to every house, the only difference between them being, that they had the family and child's name on them.

At a quarter to ten, it was unsurprising to Harry for the Weasley's and Hermione to come racing onto the train. No doubt by the perfect badges on their chests they would be by to Harry's compartment after the perfect's meeting.
“I think that Acromantula silk will work fine for my Hogwarts robes along with my shirts. Dragonhide for my Pants if you have any.”
"As I told Miss Granger, Mr. Potter Dumbledore is in meetings and cannot be interrupted." McGonagall answered my question.
"Well if that isn't revealing, I may just wait until after one of them has revealed themselves, an ancestral could lead us straight to the keys I seek. Depending on how in the know they are. Are they muggleborn?"
The simple Marauders map nickname the, was linked directly into the schools wards the first time it activated inside the castle. This link allowed the map to show a student's location and allowed them to select a person or a place by either writing out the persons name or describing/naming the place or by selecting it with their wand from a list of nearby or regularly visited places. It then gave you step by step directions to the person or place they wished to go.
"Not according to my inheritance test I'm not, as such the only requirement house Potter still has to achieve is the vault number. If someone had left the investment vault alone, we would have achieved it at the beginning of the year. Now instead I'm having to figure all the investments out myself and have only just returned the vault to the standing it had at the time of my father's death." Harry grumbled his anger at Dumbledore's meddling evident on his face.
Name: Haldris James Xavier Potter Black
"You would, technically they should not be challenging it but I fully understand that the ministry is not fully following there own laws only the laws of Albion specifically spelled out I am still working with Alexander in going over all laws put in place since the last king but it's been almost half a millennium so that's quite a few laws and bills to go through. It's a work in progress it will be several months before we have full reports for you. I'll let Sirius continue and speak of this more later." Answered Andy.
Hermione gasped as something came together in her mind and she whirled and glared at Dumbledore. "Harry was stuck in the hospital wing for the final sessions of classes which held the practical sessions of our final exams. Without passing his practical's which I'm sure you did not allow him to take during the summer and he did not have enough time in the day that followed after he woke up. Without his practical's, as Harry gained an A his first semester, and an O his second semester overall, it would have been balanced against a failing grade of troll on his final exams, which would have brought him down to a E."
"Stay out of this", both Grindelwald and Marvolo answered before Grindelwald continued "Besides I never said you weren't in control of the family magics."
“Your father is more of a fool than I thought, summon an elf young man, I will have words with your elders.” Michalis answered.
“A bearer rarely can impregnate a witch, which is why all betrothal contracts under imperial law, have what is called the bearer’s escape clause, as if a child ends up a bearer than it would be nigh impossible for him to sire a child with a witch. A bearer’s contract also has airtight fidelity contracts within them. So that outside those attached to the bearer, and the bearer they must be faithful to the bonding.”

“Wow,” Said Harry as they entered the bank and where quickly ushered through the arching doorways and winding Passages to Sharptooth’s office.
“I personally don’t trust the Minister not to hijack the court's system and me to somehow have a full trial in front of the Wizengamot. Which would more than debunk their underage magic charge as it would be the second time the ministry declared me emancipated the first time being the Triwizard Tournament last year. Even if I wasn’t already emancipated, I had claimed my Lordship ring 3 days prior and as such was exempt from the underage magic law if I had even cast the spell in the first place.”
The first knight took a step forward and began to speak. "I along with three compatriots were stationed on 6 hour watches of Nurmengard, specifically watching Grindelwald, at the time of his escape I was just coming into my shift and saw the escape happen I then trailed him for a time until I met up with my replacement. 2nd knight continue."

September 1, 1991, ~ Loyalty Potion – Keyed Ron Weasley ~ Brewed by Severus Snape *
Draco took all these rumblings in stride thinking for a moment, before brushing off Theo and Blaise, approaching the closest check-in Goblin he gave his name.
“My name is Alexander Smith, this is my wife Alexia, our eldest Emerald 12, Grace 9, and Charles 7. My sister Alicia, and her husband Carlos, and her twins Nathan 8, and Dominic 8. My other sister Catherine and her husband Edgar, their son Jaden 6, and Aiden 3.”
I have had visions of the part the house of Potter would play in the coming difficulties facing our world since I was a child, for many years they focused on your father and then a year before your birth the visions shifted to you, a little over a year ago the once rare visions about you shifted into a more common vision that I would have. Even now if I focus on you, the strings of fate drift in and through you as the fate of my people are affected by you as well.
“I have recently been reassigned here in the isles, and I found it hilarious that I would finally have proof for me to give the ICW of the British Ministry of magic breaking their own laws by not giving the accused a chance to defend themselves. That would be the third time in as many years. That combined with the case recently levied with the ICW for the false imprisonment of an Heir, and now Lord of a Most Ancient and Most Noble house would see the British Ministry seeing sanctions at the very least.” Alrick Answered.

"I would say welcome but some of you are very much not, to fifth year Potions. This year we prepare for your OWLS, and to my delight some, most of you will not be with us when we reconvene next year. Potter if you are just now opening your book, you are more arrogant than I had previously believed. 10 points from Gryffndor for not being prepared for class. And a detention with me for not wearing the proper uniform." Snape sneered.
“What is so special about Dragon’s Moor?” asked Harry.
“How dare you…” Marvolo continued fury in his eyes.
“Well, I do not see why we must this, you can hand the meeting over to me, and I’ll take it over from there.” She said. To which Harry glared once more.
"Making him, as a direct descendant of the male line, your heir." Neville answered.
“I am sorry to hear that, I came with no intention of changing allegiances, I apologize your majesty if this offends you, but I am needed still in Albion.” Harry answered.
Number 4 Privet Dr, Dursley Residence
With that said the two young men nodded and set their plates aside and picking up two bowls each they walked into the circle as the clock struck ten P.M. Walking into the circle, they stood side by side facing North. Neville spoke first
Upon entry to the headmaster's office they were quickly able to see that the headmaster had previously been in a meeting with several individuals. Lord Sirius Black, the Minister, Lucius Malfoy and Viktor Krum along with three other people Harry did not know.
"I don't really know either of my parents, I was predominantly raised by nanny elves, therefore I never connected to them. Magically or emotionally. I always had to hide it from everyone else but I don't know something tells me I'm okay to be myself around you even with my Grandfather in the castle."
Dust the Guest Bedroom
Finally, she took them up into the family wing of the house. “The family wing is for those with Potter name only it has 32 guards suites on either side of the entry to the wing. Four suites on each floor. The first through fourth floors be school rooms for children, training rooms, playrooms and studies for different members of the family. The 5th and 6th floors be having the children’s bedrooms beyond the nurseries. The seventh floor be the bedrooms of the Lady of the house, her maids, and any other consorts the lord may take. The topmost floor bes the lord's floor it bes having the lords bedroom, his bathroom, main family ritual room, the four guardsy suites, the lordsy private office, and the Master Library with summoning the ability to the family library. Its also bes having the hallway of portraits. Theys all bes slumbering but theys wake up soon in a couple weeks.” With this news all four men decided they were hungry and tired. They returned to the closest family dining room for dinner.
I Nefertiti Ramses do hereby cordially invite you Haldris Potter and a single guest to celebrate the solstice with I and my family.
Inside Harry’s mind the nightmare that had occurred every night since the third task faded. The nightmare memory of Cedric’s death and Voldemort’s return, with different endings vanished, Voldemort faded, the graveyard disappeared, and he was suddenly in a stone room. He turned to look around and saw many things, but certain things caught his eyes.
“Can I have a secrecy oath first?”
“No one my Lord, he entered and left alone.”
“You don’t, we came with a client.” Answered Edward standing aside so that Harry might be seen.
“Sounds well my lord; however, I believe only High street carries robes done in the proper bearers cut that you will require my lord.” Responded Alrick for the three men.
“I may not like it, but no doubt will have to get used to them, I trust your judgment, and if you do well I may make you my exclusive tailor, I do however have one request, make my robes maneuverable in I don’t want robes that restrict how I move. I would also like some battle robes if you don’t mind made from Dragonhide at least the first set, if I brought you Basilisk hide could you fore that into battle robes?”
For our Kings soon return
I see that the strings of your fate still are changing, with every decision that you make you destroy and create new strings. Of all the strings I see one however is growing clearer as time passes. In saying that I feel that both you and Egypt would benefit you meeting my young grandson Alomar. Of all of my grandchildren from our current pharaoh, he is both the hardest and the easiest to read and understand, though as his new title of crown Prince, at the age of 21 over his many much older siblings, can attest, he is a capable young man. I wish for you to be introduced and as such:
"Lord Le-Fay it is good to see you." Dumbledore said his face saying quite enough that it was anything but. As questions flew around him from staff and students alike Harry ignored them for the most part as he focused on the details written in the book, until his wand shook in its holster as the alarm he had set for class went off at which point he rose closing the book.
"Then take what was said with a grain of salt and forget it." Interjected Narcissa, as she, Lucius and the dark lord finished their breakfasts and started to leave the table. "Your grandfather will be taking you to the station your father, and I have duties we must attend to."
Said Hufflepuff, "I'll teach the lot,
His Aunt glares at him as she says, "I have Book club this morning, and I want those chores done before it's time to cook dinner. Vernon's having guests over, and I need help cooking it."

“Yes, my Lord King. Today Harry Potter came to the bank and in accordance to the Last of Line Clause took up the mantle as Head of House Potter, but before he did so, he went through the Rite of Awakening.” Sharptooth hesitantly answered.
"The question of "What house/s of the rank they had been assigned would ascend to the next tier first," but they never turned anything in?" Abraxas asked incredulously.
Some character development for Draco and the train ride to school.
~~~~~Power of Ancestral Magics~~~~~
“a Longbottom follows.” Finished Neville “But how will I do that?”
“Merry met, young heir.” Said a voice next to him. Harry turned and saw a man that was clearly a Potter but was not his guardian James. “My name is Michalis, I will be your mentor in the mind arts, as James is your mentor in Etiquette, magic, laws, and history of house Potter. As he teaches you to be a Potter, I will teach you how to master your mind, your magic, and your power. How to use that power in and out of the political arena as well. But first your mindscape must be handled, just look around it is beautiful, untamed, untouched, but also defenseless, and that young heir is the problem.”
"Hermione it's ok I completely understand as a muggleborn there are a few things that even our professors are restricted form telling you due to the Wizengamot's current laws, as your protectorate guardian however the Wizengamots laws don't affect my guardianship, only Albion's law does. As such I am cordially inviting you to a gathering in the bearers' dorms tonight for all those under my protectorate guardianship."
Ron nodded and took the notebook marking down his classes on the inside cover and then filling in assignments and the prompts for each class assignment. He joined in the group as several other Gryffindor's did and began working with others and asking for help when needed. Most of Gryffindor as a house then spent Friday night working on catching up their fellow housemates who had fallen behind. With even the first and second years asking for help and getting all their homework done.
“This caused other issues as well, but it did do as intended and silenced the arcane wars, after that the arcane was still used but not to the extent that we used it. eventually long after my own time the day came when the books on Arcane where put up and I hope they never are pulled down again. Regardless instead of it merely becoming a rite that a father would see a son through magic itself influenced the ritual and the rites of Blood or Blood Rite as you know it changed. It instead of became a test issued by us as the lords of the house, a test issued by the magic of the line. Know at the time that was fine, but a day came when someone failed the test set down by the family and house magics, and the magic like with any failed ritual took its price. As time went on, we discovered the cost of our binding the magic in this way to our will. But it was still better than the horror of the Arcane wars. Do you understand young Draco?” The man asked his tale told.
"Lucius Malfoy did many things to me and for me Lord Le-Fay raising me was not among them, he was to busy chasing after power, for his family to be of any use to him." Draco retorted before turning back to Harry. "I'm assuming you have a few more things to say, I'll leave you to it and just inform the tutor that you will be running late. I'll see you either in Potions or in the library after for Ancient Runes study later I have the notes for you from Arithmancy and Ancient Runes yesterday." With that Draco left the great hall leaving Harry alone with the adults.
Two men stand looking up at Nurmengard tower. One is youthful with a handsome face, the other is grizzled and old. The younger looks up at the towering tower before him saying, "Dumbledore is a fool. He has assumed that imprisoning our master in a prison of his own making would end his reign of terror. It has for a time but soon, soon we will have found the last pieces we need to achieve our goals, and then none will challenge us."
So, Neville’s magic let it be seen the blocking of him from his wizard and every push since to force him through the block. All the belittling and abuse his wizard suffered. All the pain his wizard has felt and had to deal with, but also the warmth. Especially by the one boy, his magic cried too, but he tried his best to help Neville.
The only acknowledgment of Draco’s words is the whitening of the adults faces.
"Perhaps if you are too young to handle the responsibility of making such decisions than you should not be head of house." Marvolo answers.
With all of the excitement that had happened over the weekend, all of Gryffindor was at breakfast early on Monday morning as they wanted to discuss today's paper once they received it. As such was once again treated to the rare gift of absolute silence descending onto the Great Hall as the front page proudly declared:
“You have no idea what you have truly wrought upon yourselves and I have no desire to inform you of all of it. If this is the folly the house of Malfoy has become, then I desire no part of it.” Michalis said and turned from the outside of her portrait. Outside in the hall the adults quickly cleared, many of them taking their children with them until Draco was left alone staring at the portrait.

"Now Madam Umbridge, students will be students, having to deal with pranks is all just a part of the teaching experience. However," the headmaster said turning to the boys, "skipping class is not a pranking matter, and I am very disappointed in you all." Turning back to Umbridge, Dumbledore gave her a sympathetic smile. "If I might see this prank, Madame Umbridge, then I can give out correct punishments." Nodding Umbridge handed over the stack of papers containing all the boy's paperwork they had given her moments ago. Looking at the papers he almost choked on the lemon drop in his mouth. "Children I understand that Professor Umbridge teaches rather differently than defense teachers of the past however, that is not grounds for you to withdraw from the class, as such I will be forced to deny your request for the use of full tutors, if you wish to call in part-time tutors that is acceptable, I understand your belief that this was a prank Delores however, these would be the correct papers to remove a student from regular class and attend full time tutoring as such no punishment will be given." Dumbledore scolding said with his eyes twinkling.
“So, what you are saying is that Dumbledore has been stealing from me and giving my money to other people,” stated Harry both surprised and fighting with himself to control his anger at the news.
"Ok, let me explain that." Sirius piped up gaining everyone's attention. "Say a young man name Victor Roberts, heir of the Roberts family undergoes blood rites for three lines, he completely passes, no curses, no punishments, marries and has three children. His children grow up, all three houses that Lord Roberts underwent blood rites for are stronger politically than the house of Roberts and are older than the house of Roberts. Of his three children none of them are the heir of house Roberts. House Roberts dies with Lord Victor Roberts. This is a terrifying thought to almost any pureblood family out there."
"I have three here, Vernon, Marge, and Petunia Dursley nee Evans, registered for this list as of 1979 for attacking Lilly Potter nee Evans, Petunia's sister after being informed that she was carrying the next Potter heir. The attack was so bad that she was placed in St. Mungo's for a week, and almost lost the next heir Potter no less than four times in that week. Said muggle's only answer for the attack was that she had deserved it for daring to attempt to bring another" she choked on the next word "freak into the world. Bring consideration forward with Miss. Evans over possibly erasing the memory of our world and her from her sister and brothers-in-law's minds."
"I suggest your group leave," spoke Harry. "I am nearing the end of my patience and you would not wish to see how your houses would fair against mine in a blood feud."
"I would suggest you stop while you still have your head madame, that boy is a Potter and deserves your respect. The only lying I hear or see is coming from yourself madame as cleared or not the Dark Lord he spoke of is standing beside you, and the attention seeking I fail to see outright, all I see is a press that has tried its hardest at working to destroy his image as the press in Britain has tried to do to house Potter since the end of the war with Grindelwald, you would think you people would be more honorable to a boy whose family sacrificed himself to save your own hides."
For Neville the past few days had been a blur. It was hard to believe today was Wednesday and Harry had only received Sirius ring on Sunday. He had confirmed on Monday to Harry that despite the earlier time he would undergo Blood Rites with him. Now looking around the room he was feeling ill at the prospect. The room was square with five rows of raised stone beds with five beds in each row. Each stone bed was a slab of rock on top of a stout pillar that sat at about waist height. On each of the stone slabs were carved a circle that folded over the corners of the slab, as it was only half as wide as it was tall, you could see the edges of the circle on the sides and bottom of the slab. The beds in the fifth row, on the far side of the room where raised on a dais, with only one of these beds prepared. As they entered Harry saw a set of Goblins prepare another bad in the first row and change the name cards of that one with the one next to his. He was curious as to who the newcomer was until a voice behind him asked.
"I remember she said that," Draco answered a puzzled expression on his face.
“Wow, that is quite a bit, Sharptooth if at all possible, purchase as much of the Daily Prophet as possible.” Said Harry after he has calmed down from reading the paper.
The invites to the first auction went out on Saturday afternoon. One Wednesday Harry woke to a letter from Ragnok, the manager of the Rome branch and High King of the Goblins. Traditionally each goblin branch in each country was under the authority of a specific Goblin clan who’s head was called king. With almost over 200 branches worldwide the over 100 clans had one or two branches apiece. Ragnok as High King headed the Rome branch as the Camelot branch was locked down. From the Rome branch all the fees and costs were set for all Gringotts. Though the British Gringotts itself did not have to worry about the Dwarf or Nome banks the other Gringotts branches and Rome as the head branch did as most countries did not have the treaties the British Goblins did. Many of the European Branches only relied on the Albion treaty of 1018 to hold the Goblins, to their word. In that treaty the Goblin’s where given the right to bank in Albion but not exclusively and part of the Bank would be owned by the Pendragon line, along with the Goblins being forced to swear fealty to the Crown.
After that the day went quickly, with both classes being as expected, and Harry joining the rest of the group to do the homework from said classes, during the sixth seventh and eighth class sessions of the day, wherein he had no classes. After dinner he relax, pulling out an extra-curricular runes book to self-study.
Harry's eyes snapped to the front as Professor Malfoy spoke as he had finished with the seventh years. "The boards have now reset, please find your seats." After the class had assembled and everyone had found their seat he continued. "On each of your desks is two linked white boards, one has your name on it, yes there will be assigned seats so please no complaining they are final. Those white boards will also have the name of the your year partner that you will have to work with on all weekly projects occasionally on the projects you and your partner will be paired with another group or two depending on the project but going over your schedule that would only happen about once every month or so. If you are not in your seat, please find your correct seat now." Said their professor.
"Lilly Potter nee Evans you are my mother and your sacrifice has never been forgotten. I may not have been raised knowing of your sacrifice, but I understand now what a sacrifice it was, and for that I live my life in honor of that sacrifice. May I make you proud." Harry spoke again giving a sacrifice from his plate again.
As Draco sat the old man spoke. “I see in your eyes curiosity; this is not what you were expecting of a blood rites test.”
“If that is what you wish Abraxas Malfoy as formal head of the house Malfoy if not its current lord, it is your right to do so. As to that request let us also address another mistake made in first year. You Draco Malfoy challenged me to an honor duel after curfew, instead of showing you sent Filch in your place, leaving a stain on your honor. As we were rivals, I am willing to forgive and allow this debt and the moderate boon it would require covering it, to be forgiven and canceled out by the debt I owe you from our previously discussed blunder.” Harry states.
"Your reports are all rather revealing, give it a month or so more and I will be ready to leave this place or at the very least evict the ICW presence from this place perhaps a few others imprisoned here would even be willing to join me." You are all dismissed if as usual if anyone locates a seal key you are to come to me immediately. Ameren join me." The room quickly cleared all but the last man that had requested Grindelwald privately left. "Well Ameren you have info for me?"

Harry had been surprised at just how fast the remaining three weeks of October passed, before he knew it, it was the last week of October and they were brewing potions in his tutoring class at last and his defense tutoring had moved on to sixth year work. His other classes had started working on larger more innovative and dangerous projects that Harry had to keep reigning himself in on, as he also delved farther into the family Grimoire as well. He found many a lost branch of magic hidden in the family tome, even as he discovered why his family had hidden said magic away.
And must quarter every year
Father: James Charlus Arthur Potter
“You are an amazing Protector Harry, and I understand your reasoning, eventually I fear that Marvolo in his capacity of Lord Le-Fay, will push you into a corner you can’t get out of without being Ancestral, and the house of Potter as an ancestral house is technically not sworn to Albion. You can get away with it because your generation ascended but it’s still not enough of a defense, at least from a Black’s point of view.” Sirius answered giving Harry a hug. “Now what else is there?”
“The Utmost probably before too long, it’s just a matter of Rita or one of the others checking on the family statuses with the ministry. I think however at the moment that the Minister will be trying to repress that announcement as long as possible. The Ministry being sued by a Most Ancient and Most Noble house is bad enough, but for the Ministry to be sued by a Most Ancient and Utmost Noble house would make the vote of no confidence happen before the trial even happens.” Harry answers. “Besides after the trial it won’t really matter. Because they aren’t being sued by a Most Ancient and Utmost Noble house.”
“You were a beautiful baby Harry, and I saw no harm in asking your dad for permission to blood adopt, you were already proving that you would be strong. So, I adopted you, made you part black, and I think it was then that I became tied by fate. I accepted it later once I escaped prison, the other two pieces had already happened at least under a king’s banner I could better protect you, then you showed me your test. I didn’t want you to be king, call it selfishness but your kindness, your smile, the heart of innocence you hold, I didn’t want to share, because the realm chose that you were to be the next Pendragon. So, I reassured you when the time came. But sitting here today I can only think of the last thing she told me. She said, “Sirius Orion Black, you will see the rise of a king, you will help forge him, and your greatest joy shall be seeing him crowned.” I wish that I could see you crowned Harry, even if it meant you were king then I know your heart wouldn’t be breaking.” Sirius stopped here as two guards entered the room.
Chapter 22 –
"Miss, Granger I will forgive you for questioning my liege's honor this once, in honor of the fact you are a first-gen. In the future, if you challenge the honor of my liege I will put you in your place." Said Tyler Potter.
"Good for I see three runic symbols, surrounding the emblem of Janus. You have a choice to make, and from each of those choices can come one of two results, but both are interconnected, the differences in the secondary paths are not made by your choices but the choices of others." As Draco looks into the orb, he sees images as her words begin to invoke a change in the crystal. First comes a distorted image, Voldemort fights on a battlefield, and Harry Potter, his opponent, cuts him down, in the background, Draco can make out a burning Malfoy Manor. The scene suddenly shifts, and a familiar face is talking to him, and his father says something and both he and his father attack, he sees his father and him attack the man, this image to then fades into an image of Malfoy manor burnt to the ground. His and his father's ashes were gathered, and given a traitor's burial, to be scattered in the four corners of Albion.
"Sure, a lawyer could help with most things, and gives us a law perspective, go ahead and add her to the call." Answered Harry.
“I’m sorry but who are you and what are you doing here?” Asked Harry concerned.
"I'm not sure." Harry said.
"Hello Draco, my name is Haldris, Haldris Potter Heir of the Most Ancient and Most Noble House of Potter, you may call me Harry." Answered Harry in kind. They both smiled thinking only that this was a new beginning and one that felt right.
"Really, what's more important Lord Potter, your houses secrets, it's pride, or Albion? I can give it peace, or would you really prefer the war that will come when I finally get my way. Kneel and give me Albion, Potter, or I will see you and all of yours crumble beneath my army."
“You have no right to do so boy, snapped the pink toad-like lady. “Aurors seize him for consorting with criminals and not informing the ministry of said convicts location.” Her words were met with cold stares from the heads of all thirteen of the other Most Ancient and Noble Houses.
"Thank you Draco, I will come as well, Mr. Smith, allow me to mirror call my godfather so that he can send the aid requested, and to assure the vassals in the castle that I have not had a horrible fate befallen me while I slept or some such nonsense." Harry said.
“Wait full blood rites as in more than four houses on his inheritance sheet. He does know that more than one failure in a full blood rite means he will die right?” Draco asked
Amanuensis Quills – 10%
“The goblins and I have recently suffered through a rather large disagreement. As such once their part in rituals is done, and the cuts are made, they will all be leaving including King Grinholt.”
"I fail to see why we have the worse dark lord here in this very room, previous he may be but worse he was, furthermore his defeater is also here." Pomona Sprout interjected.
“Nikodemus you have to stop this, when that boy wakes up he is going to have the power to destroy them. You know as well as I do that the Le-Fay lord only holds a partial control of the family magics.” Selena said.
"I am I feel he will not be pleased with my information, but it is something he needs to be made aware of." Answered the younger man.
There where however consequences of his victory. No more was the house of Potter a house of Most Ancient and Most Noble Rank, he had felt Albions magic shift, he had felt them release his house. House Potter was now Ancestral. But he had also received a boon from this, he had proven his ability to control the magic of his houses and as such the magic had fully bonded with him. This bonding usually not seen until a lord had held control over the family magics for years, came easy to him now. With this magic he could feel the wards around him, he felt Sirius and Hermione leave his side. The magic told him the status, health, and magical levels of every member of his house. Reaching through these bonds he quickly found what was causing the agitation n his house’s magic, that was finally wakening him.
Dear Lord Potter,
"We can" said Alexander, "and that last part is a good idea, my only suggestion would be putting and age limit on it, for example, students between the ages of 11 and 21 are applicable for now and it may be open to more as we go along, and only one per family."
Harry performs his first ritual and learns of wrongs and betrayals done.
Black ~ non-heir
Influence Test
"How dare you…"
"The houses can get serious about some things like that. A further discussion into the differences between the class system can wait until we are working on either our History of Magic group projects of our Culture projects. Suffice to say is that yes, the nobility get some benefits from there station, but they have a lot of expectations, and tradiotions that come with them. Ron it's just a matter of sitting down with a few friends and working out a plan. Then your projects aren't rushed, you retain more informational, and you have more time for fun. You can get easy assignments out of the way with the topic fresh in your mind. Here this is called a notebook, it's a handy muggle item, that's been spelled with never ending pages. I usually write down my homework for the week on Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday as we get it and then space it over the days in the slots I have available for the rest of the week. I don't have transfiguration or charms on Wednesday but still work the assignments for them on Wednesday as then I can ask any questions I might have on Thursday during class. Same with the other classes besides Dada and Potions as those professors aren't teaching or answering questions."
"Dumbledore had done much the same with my vaults."
~~~~~Power of Ancestral Magics~~~~~
“No refunds if you back out now.” The goblin answered.
"Hey pup, I have a few surprises for you. To start with I've pulled you out of school and have several different things on the itinerary for the day. Yes, the grand opening went fine last night we can discuss it more tomorrow. Eat your breakfast, we need to head on out."
“Enough Xerxes we have somethings to discuss come with me.” Nefertiti said appearing, she grabbed the prince’s arm and dragged the elder prince away.
"We will do as we have always done be obedient but mindful of the people, reminding our king that he serves more than the noble's." At the incredulous look he received Neville said. "There's not really much we can do, we are bound to the king's throne."
Said Slytherin, "We'll teach just those
"The Rite, the Rite, what?" Says Harry confused.
~~~~~Power of Ancestral Magics~~~~~
“Umm, what’s with the extra guards?” Draco asked.
"Outside your precious Britain those houses are still held in high regard and many look to them for guidance in regard to the return of the kings, and for many other political matters. Even after the war with Grindelwald when your ministry sanctioned house Potter for the actions taken by Charlus Potter much of Albion celebrated and toasted their name. In your minds Albion is nothing more than the 7 million citizens inside Britain, never thinking of the almost 100 million that live outside the isle's. Most outside your borders see Britain as nothing more than the spoiled oldest brother that throws tantrums when the rest of the family doesn't do things his way, and Dumbledore and you, Lord Le-Fay have not aided in that regard." The man continued.
“I see. Each test will, of course, cost 50 galleons, but I believe your vault can more than cover the cost. If I might be so bold, I also suggest you take an influence test as well. It shows all influencing magic a person is under currently or has been under previously.” Sharptooth replied.
The guards bodily carried a kicking and screaming Sirius to the chambers were the kiss was given and from there Harry became a spectator, as Sirius fought the dementor, but eventually succumbed to the kiss, as Umbridge, Fudge, and Malfoy watched laughing. Harry’s fury burned. His fury burned bright enough that his guardians woke and entered his mindscape looking for the cause of his agony. Finding it they whispered words of encouragement in his ear. They reassured him that he could claim revenge for this death. That these deaths would be justified, and that Harry heard as his anger faded to a simmer, controlled by the cords of revenge. As he settled his guardians stepped back as first James, and then Ignatius, faded into the mist leaving Michalis to settle the bearers burning rage.
“As for you Alexandria and the remainders of your brood, I expel you from the Potter family. You have forgotten what it means to be a Potter and have no place within the family with your current views. If it had merely been child abuse, I would have simply summoned the Aurors and been done with it. However, you have also disavowed the very tenants of what it means to be a Potter and the sacrifices made by our ancestors in the past. As you have no love nor respect for the house of your birth, I cast you out, I take back the dowry this house once gave you, and remove the stipend we once provided you with, you have no place here. The guards will escort you out. The elves will see to your personal belongings.” Harry said as the guards escorted them out, to their yells that he couldn’t do this, Harry turned back to the rest of the children of Alexandria’s Family.
After leaving the Hogwarts grounds Harry took the offered arm and allowed Sirius to apparate the two of them from the Hogwarts grounds to Godrics Hollow.
“That boy has all but signed the death warrant for the house, a death warrant I tell you.” Her words echoed in the hall, as the footsteps of several youngsters did as well.
“You have to understand that when Dumbledore returned in 1945 after “defeating” Grindelwald, he was treated like a king. But he did nothing to stop the rise of Voldemort over the next 30 years, in 1975, the current Minister of magic was forced to step down, but the blood war had officially started 3 years before that. From the beginning of the blood war in 1972 until 1978, the hit wizards and witches sworn to house Potter held over 75% of its contracts within the country, mainly defending against the rising tide of death eaters. In late 1978 Fleamont died four days after his own father Charlus Potter, as such the title of lord Potter fell to your father who sent most of all the family’s non-monetary assets overseas. A year later you were born, and the war was very obviously being lost. Even after a threat was made against the family, James trusted Dumbledore far more than he trusted the family wards and us his family vassals to protect him. And then in 1981, when it was roughly estimated that He-who-must-not-be-named was months from victory he was defeated by you.” Stated Corsiar rather passionately.
As Professor McGonagall passed out class schedules, Hermione watched Harry laugh and joke with his friends new and old. It hurt slightly that he could move on so fast and forget about her, hadn't four years of friendship meant anything to him. Harry had no right to just expect her to believe the words of some creature over the headmaster, he was the greatest wizard since Merlin and Harry had no right to challenge and disrespect him like he did. Even as she watched both Neville and Ron with Harry, she saw his happiness and was mildly surprised by it. She now felt slightly curious about why Harry had been so insistent that Dumbledore could not be trusted. Looking down at the watch on her wrist she got up and headed upstairs for History of Magic.
“You know very well Headmaster that I cannot reveal any information about any services or acts done within the bank. To do so would invalidate my oaths of service and see me dismissed from my post.” Answered Bill.
