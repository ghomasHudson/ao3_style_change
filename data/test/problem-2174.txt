“Best of luck, Malfoy. Hopefully we’ll see you for the vivas,” she said and Malfoy gave her a small smile, releasing his hold on her hand. Harry hesitated for a second, and then held out his own hand. Malfoy took it and they shook.
“Did you now? Marvelous! What school, dare I ask?” he said and Malfoy piped up next.
The house tables were gone, and survivors were crowded into the room, standing in groups in various states of injury. Madam Pomfrey was amongst them, dabbing wounds with smoking dittany and resetting bones with taps of her wand. Draco could see the heaving flank of a centaur on the platform as he turned to survey the room. Behind him, Harry had stopped dead.
“We’re here,” He eventually said simply and Draco sighed and nodded. Every time they had met in this dreamscape, Potter had been verging on incoherent, conversations skipping ahead before Draco could catch up. Potter leaned back and lowered himself so he was sat cross-legged on the floor in front of Draco. “Is Hogwarts very different?” he asked and Draco shrugged one shoulder.
“Maybe. But I think I feel ready now. Whatever my father did to me… it’s in the past. I won’t be like him to our child,” he said firmly and Harry smiled at him.
Bugsy reappeared with a small tray of tea, lemon slices and sugar cubes at the ready. He poured himself a cup and then cradled it in his hands, training his eyes on the handle of his bedroom door. No one would disturb him tonight, he was certain of that, but he couldn’t take his eyes off the door. He sipped the tea and watched.
,” he tried and while Draco’s wand gave a little jerk in his hand, it didn’t leave it. The holly wand, exhausted, split into two again and Potter caught the dangling piece as it slumped over his fingers.
“All right!” Potter shouted, and he dropped the wands in his hands. Weasley did the same, raising his hands to shoulder height.
“Harry, this symbol – it connects Dumbledore, Grindelwald and Godric’s Hollow. I really think this is worth looking into,” Hermione said earnestly. Potter looked up at her and then turned and looked out into the darkness of the forest around them. Draco stood from the dining table and went to lean against the central pole, his arms crossed over his chest. Weasley gave him a sideways look but didn’t say anything. “Harry – please,” Hermione whispered into the quiet and eventually he turned around, taking a deep breath and nodding.
“So,” Granger began, cradling the mug in her hands. Draco held his close too, enjoying the warmth. “Why are you here?” she asked Draco, giving him a look over the fire. The firelight caught her skin and made it glow in the darkness. Draco took a long sip of tea, even though it was still hot enough to scald the top of his mouth.
“Well, we should go say hello,” Hermione said and walked off, Harry left gaping behind her for a second before following her through the crowd. Malfoy was exactly where he had seen him earlier, though a bit further away from the candidates than he had been before. Hermione didn’t slow her pace and continued to walk right up to him, Harry trailing behind her, his full wine glass sloshing in his hand.
“Draco,” Snape said and he turned to look back at him. Snape was watching him with the same practised neutrality, the same coolness he looked at everyone, but even Draco could see some of the fear from Draco’s face reflected in his eyes. “Your mother will be most upset if you don’t return. Don’t be late,” he said in a heavy tone and Draco nodded and turned away again, walking away on weak legs.
"Bring them back," Harry murmured and Draco nodded, leaned forward to kiss him softly one last time, and then turned to the Aurors.
Potter kissed him.
, all of them red-eyed and sniffling.
“What happened to Ugly?” Greyback asked, pointing one clawed finger at Harry, who lay face down on the ground. From inside the tent, there was the sound of things being overturned, of Hermione’s books being thrown to the ground and Draco tried not to flinch.
“You can look. It’s not pretty, but it’s not as bad as it was,” he said and Draco tried to look at his forearm.
“Cold,” Potter said, dumping his damp clothing on the canvas flooring. Draco wrinkled his nose at it. “Did you think of anything?” he asked and Hermione shook her head, pouring what looked like tomato soup from the flask into the bowls.
"What?" he gasped out, falling back on his heels, feeling his knees protest. He reached out a hand and held onto the edge of the fireplace, steadying himself.
“I must be coming down with something,” he suggested and Pansy studied his face for a long while. He looked away first, unable to meet her dark eyes.
“Yeah, it is,” he sniffed and lifted his hand again, looking around. “Where is it, by the way?” he asked and Draco pointed to where Hermione’s bag sat next to his foot, dropped there by the owner as she staggered towards bed.
"Where's your brother, where's Scorpius?" Harry asked and Albus made a weird sort of noise and gestured to the mirror again. The silver-framed mirror. Harry's knees went weak, his mind running at a hundred miles an hour. "Oh Merlin, no. No, please," he begged some unseen entity. The mirror surface began to churn like restless water again, and bulged outwards, straining against something on the inside, until, at last, Draco and Scorpius broke free.
,’ he begged to the silent Gods above.
On the third day, he had opened the brown paper bag that the house-elves had given him to have the last sandwich. He was surprised to see, instead, that the bag had produced another two. He had turned it over in his hands, and let out a relieved sort of a laugh. The bag must be enchanted, producing food from the Hogwarts kitchens whenever it sensed it was close to empty. He had felt a flood of affection for Dobby and Mibby, and ate one of the sandwiches gratefully.
“I’ve been practising my dives! I’m going to be on the team this year,” the third-year promised and his father clapped him on his shoulder. Sasha had been sorted to Gryffindor, like all other Weasley kin, and Draco was sure the house Quidditch team mainly consisted of them now.
“Thank you very much for those wise words, Rapier,” said Lee, his voice tight from trying not to laugh. He cleared his throat before speaking again. “Listeners, that brings us to the end of another Potterwatch. We don’t know when it will be possible to broadcast again, but you can be sure we shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials: the next password will be ‘Mad-Eye’. Keep each other safe, keep faith,” Lee said somberly and Potter’s jaw tightened slightly. “Goodnight.” The radio’s dial twirled and then the lights went out.
“Lovely. Indian tonight then?” she suggested and Harry nodded, leading them to the apparition spot.
“The name… We don’t say it,” he said and one of Potter’s eyebrows jumped up.
“What is it?” he whispered in her ear and she wiped a gloved hand over something partway down the stone, under a faded name, drawing his attention to the symbol etched there. He gaped, his mouth suddenly going dry. The symbol from the book.
“Do you really want to read that?” he asked and Hermione opened the beaded bag swinging from her wrist, dropping the book inside with a ‘
“Regulus? Such a dear boy. He was a good few years younger than me, but yes. It was very tragic when he died. He was so young,” she said, her eyes going unfocused as though she was looking into the past for her long lost cousin. “His death… Well, my Aunt Walpurga wasn’t the easiest woman to start with, but his death sent her mad with grief.”
’ and ’
“You’re pinching my elbow,” Potter eventually said and Draco took a step back, rubbing his hand on the back of his neck, which felt hot with embarrassment.
They landed in a snowy lane under a dark blue sky which held the night’s first stars. Stone cottages with thatched roofs lined either side of the lane and Christmas decorations twinkled from the windows. A little ahead of them, the golden light of Muggle streetlamps indicated the centre of the village.
“That was all I wanted to say,” Snape replied coolly, dismissing him once more as he turned his hooked nose back down to the paperwork strewn across his desk. Draco rose, a biting remark forming on his tongue, but he swallowed it down. He nodded curtly once and then left the office once more, scowling to himself.
“But they weren’t really back from the dead, were they?” Hermione said plaintively, pleading her case. “Those kinds of – of pale imitations aren’t the same as truly bringing someone back to life,” she added and she gave Draco a look as if expecting him to back her up. Potter interrupted him before he got to say anything.
“Malfoy?” Hermione said politely as she approached and Malfoy looked up with a start, frowning. His gaze flicked between Hermione and Harry and his shoulders tensed.
’ All across the sign were similar sentiments of support, belief and love, and Draco had to grin, especially as Potter turned around and caught his eye. They weren’t the striking green they usually were, but they were brilliant having read the messages of hope left there.
And so it went, Harry answering questions regarding the answers he had written in the examination papers. One Fellow wanted to know his justification in saying the Tudor period was the start of the decline of magic, another wanted to discuss his answer regarding the basis of late-modern fairytales. Harry found the more he spoke, the more confident he felt. He knew this subject like he knew his bones - all the knowledge he had accumulated over the years was there around him, like a warm blanket, and he leaned into it every time he talked. Time was ticking on, and Fellow Williams, who had originally spoken to Harry, spoke again.
“We need to go,” he hissed and he gave the mortal remains of Fred Weasley an apologetic look. “We can’t stay here, it’s too dangerous–” and then Ron had lurched to his feet and had pushed Draco back, sending him staggering into the opposite wall, his hand ripped clean from Harry’s grasp.
!” he shouted and he raised his wand. Something huge and horned fell out of it, charging towards where the owl and stag had disappeared from, its head lowered, and soon it disappeared from sight. The second the Death Eaters were distracted by the Patronus, Draco had snuck through the shadows and down the side street of Aberforth’s building. He ducked down behind the bins and waited.
“And now? Do you think it’s easier?” Draco asked and Potter shrugged one shoulder. He reached over, looking for a second like he was going to take Draco’s jaw into one hand, leaving Draco breathless for a second, but then he pulled back and the Snitch was struggling in his grasp.
“In Nature’s Nobility,” she reminded him and Draco reached out to the book he’d put down on the bench beside him while they ate.
“I’m sorry,” he said through clenched teeth, tears burning in his eyes. “I’m so sorry. I wish – I didn’t–” He couldn’t find the right words and he started when he felt Dumbledore reach out and grasp his shoulder. It felt so real, the hand heavy and warm, and Draco’s shoulders shook.
“I did,” he admitted and Potter’s eyes lit up slightly.
“I need to visit Gringotts,” she said and Travers smiled.
“Merlin,” Pansy breathed, somewhere between awestruck and horrified. “He’s bitten straight though his lip,”
Harry cleared his throat and began to tell the group about what Dumbledore had said to him and Malfoy. "He said that he thought “lost' might mean someone who couldn't be recovered, by choice. A child who converted to the light side," he said and Hermione's eyes lit up.
The sun had barely risen by the time Draco was packed. He turned on the spot and Disapparated with a crack as the first rays of dawn broke over the horizon.
“Then go, Potter, go!” she said and Harry turned to run out of the hall. “Malfoy, go with him. Zabini, come here, you’re of use to us,” she instructed Draco and Blaise, and with a last look at Blaise, who gave him a determined nod, Draco tugged Harry along and they ran from the hall.
“It’s better,” he whispered and Potter nodded, letting go of his wrist again as Granger came running. The pain came clawing back and Draco couldn’t help the animalistic howl of pain that came out of him, his back arching off the ground as his arm felt like it was about to burst into flame. Potter reached for him again and the pain went as soon as Potter touched him. “You,” he murmured and Granger was in the tent then, crouched next to him, muttering charms as she waved her wand in a figure of eight over his body. She sighed next to him and he heard her hair brush the side of the tent as she shook her head.
Draco turned away.
Live happily ever after?
“Huh?” Draco said aloud, leaning forward in his chair. Harry jumped a little, obviously not having realised that Draco was now awake, but Draco’s eyes were on the portrait. A white dot had appeared at the end of the painted tunnel and it was growing bigger and bigger until the girl came back into frame, but there was someone else with her, taller than she was, though they were limping. The two figures grew and grew until only their heads and shoulders filled the frame and Draco rose to his feet out of his chair as the portrait above the mantelpiece swung open and Neville Longbottom, his hair overgrown and cuts peppered over his face, clambered out, letting out a shout of delight.
“Do you think so?” he asked and she nodded.
“NOOO!” Weasley let out a war cry and burst into the drawing room, leaving Draco to scramble up and follow him in, wand raised. “
,” he said and he opened his eyes as a swirl of silver mist rose from his wand. It didn’t take shape but lingered for a few minutes before fading away. Draco, smiling, turned back to look at Potter who gave him a pleased look.
“We can’t go charging in, mind,” Granger said contemplatively, winding a finger around a curl of hair as she thought. “We’ll have to get a plan together. We’ll need your cloak, Harry,” she said and Potter nodded while Draco turned to him in confusion.
They fell into silence, the group, as they all poured over the files in front of them. Harry got lost in the details of Death Eaters he had encountered years before - Hollander, Grey, Rowle. Any one of them could have his sons, and the thought made a mixture of panic and rage rise in his chest. With a glance over a Malfoy, Harry could see that he, too, was struggling with the strange mix of emotions.
!’ from around the sandwich.
When Amycus finally let up and Longbottom was able to stand, his entire chin and throat was red with blood. He wiped it away with the back of a shaking hand but he held his head high as he limped back to his seat. The class watched in morbid fascination as he sat back down.
“A family trait is it, Malfoy?” he said mockingly and Draco forced himself not to flush with shame. “No matter. We can check. And you thought it’d be a laugh to let them say the Dark Lord’s name, did you?”
“Yes, yes, she’s had the baby!” he cried and noises of delight rose up around Draco, who smiled politely and clapped. Lupin hadn’t seemed to have noticed him, having strode around the table to pull Potter into a hug, catching him off guard. “You’ll be Godfather?” he asked Potter, who drew back, his eyes wide.
“-How did he get into this state?’ Father was asking Greyback, who shrugged.
They reached the foot of the marble steps leading up to the bronze doors of Gringotts and, as Griphook had said, the goblins who had usually been there to usher in guests had been replaced with wizards holding long, thin golden rods – ‘
Harry picked up his pen and began.
“Where is everyone?” Hermione whispered, even as Ron led them into the Great Hall, one of the doors barely hanging on its hinges, the other creaking open as Ron pushed it.
“They’re definitely in there. Nowhere else they could be,” one of them said gruffly and his companion made a small noise of agreement. Draco strained to hear them talk. “How do we get in, though?”
“I’ll let you go Hermione, I’m sorry for waking you. I’ll see you Friday?” he said and she sighed and bid him a good night and gave another congratulations before they both hung up. Harry grinned at the letter in front of him, the one that put him one step closer to his goal.
“There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School,” Voldemort announced, holding the Hat aloft. “There will be no more houses. The emblem, shield and colours of my noble ancestor, Salazar Slytherin, will suffice for everyone, won’t they, Neville Longbottom?” he tauntingly asked Neville, who held his ground, his chin lifted defiantly. Voldemort pointed his wand at Neville and his stance became rigid and still. He took a step forward and forced the Sorting Hat onto Neville’s head until it slipped down below his eyes. Draco raised a hand to his throat as the crowd around him shifted, ready to move. The Death Eaters on the other side noticed, and raised their wands menacingly.
“Thank you, Dobby. Lead the way,” he said and with a nod of the head, Dobby led him out of the kitchens and into the dark passageway.
Bathilda’s expression was curiously blank as she watched Potter go around the room, lighting the candles set on every surface. Granger gave him a wide-eyed look as he sidled by her, heading towards the chest of drawers where Draco waited. Potter lit the match between his fingers and leaned over to light a stub of a candle, pausing. Draco glanced at him and he was studying the collection of dust-covered photographs there, mottled glass and silver catching the light from the candle. Draco leaned closer as well.
’ the spider-scrawl noted and Draco picked up the slip of paper and unfolded it.
“It feels like it, a little. But I do believe that it’s getting better. That we are getting somewhere. Who knows?” he asked, shrugging one shoulder. “Lovegood might’ve given you some very valuable information, it’s just wrapped up in a children’s story,” he said and Potter nodded.
, like Phineas, whoever he was, was offended by the insinuation that he might be incorrect.
Belinda came back with the tea, and pushed the mug into one of his hands. Harry reached for her with the other.
“I think I’m in love with your son. And I’m trying to be
“That wasn’t your Patronus!” said a Death Eater, pointing down the street where the owl had disappeared. “That was a stag!”
He opened his eyes to a scene of celebration. He blinked and looked around – he was standing under a marquee strewn with fairy lights and flowers. There was distant laughter and the sound of glasses clinking together, but it felt like it had before – like his fingers were numb and everything was so distant.
The worst night had been when he had woken Harry up, convinced that Voldemort was in the house, trying to steal the boys. Even though Harry had tried to talk to him, tried to convince him otherwise, Malfoy couldn't be persuaded, and had eventually started screaming in fear, while Harry floo'd everyone and anyone in his desperation, the boys shrieking, terrified at the loud noises.
He didn’t know the password. It certainly wouldn’t be
“Well, your cousins will be there… And you’ll know–”
“HARRY! HARRY – WHERE’S HARRY?” Draco could hear Hagrid bellow over the chaos around them. The centaurs had joined the frey now, scattering the Death Eaters, who ran from the giant stomping feet as they blundered around. Great drops of black blood fell onto the courtyard, as the giants bellowed and covered their ruined eyes from the attacking Hippogriffs and Thestrals, who whinnied and snorted in fury. Grawp, in his fury, pummelled the giants he could reach and Draco saw one fall just as Neville pulled him into the crowd that was rushing into the school.
“Who?” he asked at the same time as Hermione.
The walk down to the dungeons was quiet, at least on Draco’s part. While Blaise and Pansy traded theories on how having a Slytherin Headmaster would benefit them, Draco could only think about how very strange it was to not see Dumbledore at the High Table. It had looked empty without him.
“There’s only one way in, now,” Aberforth said, his eyes still on the portrait. “You must know they’ve got all the old secret passageways covered at both ends, Dementors all around the boundary walls, regular patrols inside the school from what my sources tell me. The place has never been so heavily guarded. How do you expect to do anything once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the Carrows as his deputies… Well, that’s your lookout isn't it? You say you’re prepared to die,” he finished with a shrug of one shoulder.
“Under-age students must leave!” McGonagall told the table sternly and a few of the younger years stood reluctantly. “I am doing this for your own good – Creevey, Peakes, get up, you are both under-age,” she snapped at two blond boys who had tried to hide behind a group of seventh-years. They reluctantly stood and left, casting glances back at them.
"Go home, Harry. We'll get you first thing in the morning, but right now, you need to sleep," she said, and Harry swallowed his pride, and nodded. Hermione stepped back to let him stand up, and caught his hand in hers, giving it a squeeze. "Take Malfoy with you. He looks a bit lost," she said in an undertone and Harry started to protest, but it died in his throat when she gave him a stern look.
“No, thank you. I just wanted somewhere quiet to sit,” he said and the elf blinked at him, before casting quick looks up and down the corridor.
“I know these names,” he said, pointing at one branch. “The Gaunt family died out years ago, though,” he said and Hermione gave him a side-long look. He raised his eyebrow at her. “What?” he asked and she sighed and then turned the genealogy book to face him.
“I’m sorry,” Potter said, turning his gaze back to Draco. He dropped into a crouch, frowning. “It’s too dangerous. You can’t,” he told him quietly and then he stood and turned, disappearing behind the trees and leaving Draco to wake up in his tent, alone and breathless.
“Have you seen Remus?” Nymphadora asked him as he went by, and Aberforth’s response trailed behind him.
He changed quickly and climbed into bed, pulling the drapes shut around his bed. He settled down to sleep, but, like it had done during his sixth year, it eluded him. And when he finally did fall asleep, hours after Blaise, Crabbe, Goyle and Theodore Nott had all gone to sleep, he did not dream.
“Let me! I can get us in!” he called and the group turned and shuffled around until Draco was facing the wrought iron gate. Draco cleared his throat. “I, Draco Malfoy, have returned home,” he told the gate which contorted and wound itself into a facsimile of a face.
“Maybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me, and only to me?” Potter suggested and Draco wanted to smack him upside the head. This cloak and dagger business didn’t seem to be Dumbledore’s style at all. Granger gave him another nervous look.
Granger came back and took the vial off him, dropping it into the bag. She Summoned the tent and dragged it out.
He rounded the final corner and Goyle’s wand was on him – he held up his hands, much like Hermione had done in front of him, facing down Crabbe’s wand.
The group of students who were hiding here were nursing various injuries. One girl with a nasty scratch down one side of her face had an arm in a make-shift sling made from a Ravenclaw scarf. A boy, a few years younger than Draco, stood but favoured one leg, the other balanced on his tiptoes – every shift in weight made him wince. Hermione was looking as well.
Every day there were more and more rumours about what Potter was up to. Draco heard desperate whispers from the Gryffindors, mournful ones from the Ravenclaws, determined ones from the Hufflepuffs, even as news came daily about Muggle-borns disappearing from their homes. On a Thursday over a month after school had started, a group of Hufflepuffs were sitting in the courtyard crowded around a copy of the
“Have you ever seen this symbol before?” she asked, reaching out to tap a small image at the top of the page. The text was in runes but her finger was pointing to a triangular eye with a vertical line down the centre. Draco frowned at it.
After paying, Harry nodded his thanks to the bartender and shoved his wallet in his pocket, and picked up the glasses, winding his way back to the corner where Hermione sat. She looked up as he approached and closed her book again, taking the offered glass from his hand.
"My dear Harry - if there were any two boys most likely to survive a kidnapping, it would be the sons of you and Mr. Malfoy here. I have no doubt that they have caused endless mischief for their captor, and that they will be returned to you soon enough. Have faith, my dear boy - in yourself and in your sons. They are rather remarkable children, after all," he said and Harry nodded dumbly, while Malfoy just gaped at the portrait. Dumbledore gave them both one last smile and then disappeared out of the frame, leaving them alone.
“Finally, we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of Bathilda Bagshot have been discovered in Godric’s Hollow.” Draco’s head whipped up and Potter looked round at him in shock. “The evidence is that she died several months ago,” and Draco remembered the smell of the place, the state it was in, the molding walls and the stench of a body rotting from the inside out. He tried not to gag at the memory. “The Order of the Phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of injuries inflicted by Dark Magic,” Lee finished grimly and Hermione was shaking her head, while Weasley just stared at the floor, lost in thought. Potter stood and went to join Draco at the dining table, resting a hand on the back of his neck and squeezing lightly, a comforting touch. Draco shuffled up along the bench as Potter sat down. Lee continued to speak.
The angle was awkward. Their noses clashed and Harry’s glasses were pushed painfully into his face, but he didn’t care. Draco’s lips were warm and soft against his own and he made a surprised sort of noise at the back of his throat but he didn’t pull away. Harry reached out and cupped the back of Draco’s neck in his hand, tilted his head slightly to adjust the angle, and pressed closer.
“He desired her, that was all,” Voldemort sneered, dismissive. “When she had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worthier of him–”
“I’m… I’m fine,” he told her, more to convince himself than her. She didn’t look convinced at all, but she only nodded and then walked away. Hermione patted his hand sympathetically.
," he said in a quietly chilling voice, and Harry stumbled down a few more steps. Just past the landing, on the next flight down, two small boys pressed their heads together, curls tangling into fine straight locks. Harry reached for them and then fell again, straight into the waking world.
The truth was, Cameron had been very against Harry returning to England in the first place, even if it was just for the examinations.
"You had to sign the papers agreeing to it," Harry said quietly, into his hands, and Malfoy scoffed.
“Not a bad little haul for one night,” he was saying. “A Mudblood, a runaway goblin, three truants and the Malfoy boy. You checked their names on the list yet, Scabior?” he asked and Scabior spoke from a little way away.
Weasley was tapping away, muttering to himself at intervals, when the Wireless clicked, whirred and then came to life. Draco jumped at Weasley’s
“Hello?” came the sleepy mumble from the other line, and Harry nearly shouted in response.
“Godfather, Harry!” Bill said from the head of the table, collecting the goblets left there. “A real honour. Congratulations!” he said and Harry, grinning, began to collect goblets as well, helping to clear the table, following Bill into the kitchen. As soon as the door was closed between them, Weasley rounded on Draco again.
Remembering he had been writing a reply to Malfoy's latest letter, Harry fished it out of his backpack and set it on the kitchen counter, leaning over it to continue writing.
“We were. I broke up with her last summer. I didn’t want to be… if something happened to me…” Potter seemed to struggle internally for a long moment, worrying his bottom lip with his teeth before he sighed again. “I thought it’d be easier. If we weren’t together,” he finally said and Draco made a small noise of acknowledgement.
“He’s really gone?” Hermione whispered, her voice cracking, once Draco was close enough to hear her. He nodded and sat down heavily next to them.
The spell shot at the surprisingly intact wardrobe mirror and bounced around the room, setting a trail of fire whenever it landed. It shattered neglected china that was displayed on shelves around the room, sending a curtain of fire over the doorway, and Draco threw his arms up over his face as a piece of china threatened to slice his cheek open. Potter lurched around and ran for the bed again, dragging Granger with him and Draco right behind her, and they bounced from the bed to the ruined dressing table and out of the window, twisting in mid-air, the horrible scream that Potter let out silenced by the squeeze of Apparition.
“We know you’re here, Potter, and there’s no getting away! We’ll find you!” the Death Eater shouted again and Draco watched as one of the Death Eaters who had been searching returned to the Three Broomsticks, thankfully empty handed.
He smiled when he saw a figure approaching, his pale hair practically white in the late autumn light. Harry raised a hand in greeting and the figure sped up, coming into view.
There was a wild keening sound filling the air and it was only when he was on his knees next to Snape did Draco realise it was himself. Harry, looking numb, reached for him but Draco batted his hand away.
Harry was waiting in the space at the end of the carriage, coaxing smiles out of tearful children as they passed. He joined Draco at the door and waved to their friends as the train gave another whistle and jolted forward.
“You won’t be killing anyone else tonight,” Harry said simply, as though stating a universally known fact.”You won’t be able to kill any of them, ever again. Don’t you get it? I was ready to die to stop you hurting these people-”
, though he cast charms around it to make sure it didn’t spread. He helped himself to one of the sandwiches Mibby had made and took a second to think about what he should do.
“You mean we ought to get them fighting?” he asked and Ron shook his head.
Draco climbed down from the top bunk and headed for the door, ruffling his hair as he went. He paused outside to listen as Hermione spoke.
!” as he went.
Once upon a time, his sons had been Malfoy's too.
She paused and Draco tilted his head, noticing a strange grinding sound coming from somewhere in the room. He glanced up just in time to see the crystal chandelier sway ominously. With a creak and the tinkling of crystal, it began to fall directly onto Bellatrix, who stood beneath it. She dropped Hermione, throwing herself to one side to avoid it. Draco lifted his hands to cover his head and he felt someone land on top of him, knocking him to the ground. The chandelier exploded into a million shards of crystals and chains as it landed, falling on top of Hermione and the goblin.
He was just about to get out of the armchair and check what the paperbag had served up for lunch when there was a pop from just outside the wards, and Potter, Hermione and Weasley came staggering back through, all covered in what looked like a thick layer of dust, a large cut bleeding from Potter’s forehead and Weasley limping slightly.
“And your first name?” Greyback continued and Potter coughed.
“You’re reading my letters?” Draco asked, his voice quavering a little. Snape sniffed, his expression neutral.
“Remember, I don’t like the beard too long,” Weasley was saying and Hermione hushed him, setting to work conjuring the necessary Transfigurations. She and Draco had worked together to find the correct order of spells, because some would cancel out others if they were layered incorrectly. Weasley and Draco were both going under false identities, hoping that Bellatrix’s presence would be enough to stop any questioning.
“You never know what roads are closed off or where, in Oxford. Just the other week, that Muggle detective and his lanky blond sidekick were monologuing over another corpse found near St Edmund Hall. The side roads were closed for three days,” she said ruefully and Harry smiled. In her letters, she had often complained about DI Lewis and DS Hathaway, who typically turned up in odd places and questioned assorted students about the various and unfortunate deaths of the denizens of Oxford. Thus far, Hermione had managed to avoid being caught up in their enquiries, but Harry thought that had more to do with her knack for Notice-Me-Not charms.
“Can I sit?” Cameron said, gesturing at the free chair opposite Harry. Harry stared at it for a second and then nodded, not trusting his own voice. “So, how have you been?” Cameron said, flashing Harry a smile that would have previously made him weak at the knees, but now looked fake. His hair was styled a little too perfectly, the beachy curls nearly too precise to be natural. Given that they were just coming out of a particularly harsh winter, Harry had a feeling that Cameron's sun-kissed glow was given a helping hand too.
“What is he doing here?” he asked, pointing an accusatory finger at Draco. Draco, who had heard Hermione crying at night though she never mentioned why, sniffed.
,” they chanted as they went in a wide circle, Draco meeting Potter shoulder-to-shoulder at the end. Granger stood in the middle of the clearing and cast some further charms silently, her eyes focused on the dome of the ward over them as her wand shot sparks of silver into the air which caused small starbursts to appear on the dome. It was unlike anything Draco had seen before, and he watched her, fascinated.
The next wave was upon them, Ginny, Neville and Luna screaming for joy, and then the Weasleys and Hagrid and Kinglsey and the professors, all of them bloody and broken, shouting and screaming and stamping their feet. The noise was a cacophony around them and when Harry could finally focus on one person, he turned his gaze to Draco and smiled, wide and beautiful, before pulling him into a kiss. The sound did not waver, the celebration did not die, and Draco grinned against Harry’s mouth and pulled him closer.
“So – where do we go from here?” Draco asked after a minute of silence. Granger looked up at him and sighed.
“Yeah, lets,” he said and she looped her arm through his and they began to head for the door. Malfoy was stood to one side of the atrium, looking a bit dazed, and Harry nearly kept walking, if it wasn’t for Hermione stopping dead in her tracks.
“You’ll need it for Apparating,” he said reluctantly and Draco nodded, tucking it behind his ear for safe keeping while he finished putting a final few things in his backpack.
"You remember where it is, don't you?" he asked, and he didn't wait for a reply as he turned on his heel and Disapparated away.
On the next floor up, Draco turned a left and followed a dark hallway to the end, and then up another set of stairs, this one narrow and winding. He did not stop and he didn't look back and Harry jogged to keep up with him, his heart in his throat with the feeling that with every turn, he'd find his sons.
“Where is Mr Harry Potter, sir? Dobby came as quickly as he could,” he squeaked and Draco’s heart gave a little thrill of relief.
“LUCIUS!” Mother shouted, and Draco didn’t notice as she bodily removed her husband from her son’s vicinity, dragging him back with a hand fisted in his robes. All he could think about was the stinging pain along his jaw and with one rough movement he got out of his seat and left the study, breaking the warding charm around the door. He ignored the stares of the Death Eaters scattered along the Stone Stairs as he took them two at a time, running along the galleries until he was in his room, slamming the door shut behind him.
“Oh, Harry! Let’s have a look at you, come on,” she said, letting him go and pushing him to stand an arm's length away, studying him. “You look very tanned,” she said and Harry shrugged a shoulder, letting his backpack drop into the spare chair next to him.
“Well, this changes things, doesn’t it?” Greyback whispered into the dark clearing and Draco felt a thrill of fear climb up his spine. No one spoke. Around then, the Snatchers had frozen, their tent raided, and the group of bound prisoners collectively held their breath, waiting for their fate to be sealed. Greyback moved again and crouched in front of Potter, who leaned back, his head brushing the back of Draco’s.
Draco allowed himself to be led back to the castle, hurried up the stone steps into the unnaturally silent castle. The sounds of battle had gone, though the flagstones of the entrance hall were splattered with blood. Debris from the fight littered the space, emerald scattered like treasure over the floor, and bits of marble and wooden bannister from the battered stairs lay across the floor.
“He’s dead,” Harry said blandly and Aberforth’s expression didn’t change. “Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.”
“They left last year,” Draco added confidently. “I’m in my last year, I would’ve seen them about the castle if they were still students. But they left last year,” he repeated and Greyback scowled at him.
A group of people lay in a line in the centre of the room, and Draco blinked at them, confused, before he realised that these were the dead. The Weasleys, mourning, were crowded around the recovered body of Fred. Ron and Hermione slipped over to them, Hermione embracing Ginny as Ron joined his brothers who opened their arms to him. And next to Fred…
The statue was obviously of James and Lily Potter with their son. He wondered if it had been carved from a reference, because he could see the resemblance to Potter in those stone faces. James’ nose with Lily’s chin. His hair with her eyes. Potter stood in silence, Granger on his arm, his eyes scanning over every inch of the stone, as if absorbing it to memory.
,” he said with emphasis and, to his astonishment, Granger looked even more interested.
“Did you say you got away from the Snatchers with a spare wand?” Potter asked Weasley after a moment of silence while Hermione studied the locket. He started and then pulled open his rucksack and offered up a slim, pale wood wand, handing it over. Potter gave it an experimental flick and the lights in the tent went out with an audible ‘
Potter sat straddling the bench, swirling his spoon around in his soup as Draco and Hermione ate, making occasional noises of frustration. Hermione eventually snapped.
“Yes,” the goblin said firmly and when she spoke again, Bellatrix sounded relieved.
“You know, Greyback,” Scabior said contemplatively. “I think there is a Dudley in there,” and Draco held his breath, feeling the group around him do the same.
“You, yes, of course – Dora quite agrees, no one better–” Lupin was saying and Potter grinned at him, stepping back and raising a hand to rub at his hair.
’s as they duplicated, turning into a shower of coins. “It burned me!” Hermione exclaimed, sucking at her blistered fingers. Draco bent down to pick up one of the coins and dropped it almost instantly, shaking his hand with a hiss of pain. It, too, duplicated, exact copies popping into existence around his feet.
“Glad you came to your senses,” she told him loftily and Harry gaped at her as she took another sip of wine.
“The wizarding world – not just his supporters. No one says it,” he said and Potter gave him a long look.
Rain lashed the windows as Draco took a step back. Harry opened hazy eyes and looked at him with a half-lidded gaze. His lips were bruised and swollen, and his chest heaved. Draco studied him hungrily and nodded his head. “I want to,” he said firmly and Harry’s brain took a second to catch what he said, but then he grinned and pulled Draco back to him.
Hermione and Draco were waiting for him outside, their heads bent close together. Draco looked almost like he was pleading, and Hermione looked flustered, but they both smiled at him as he approached, standing from their seats.
“My dear boy, it was more than. You have found your own redemption. You have shaken the bonds that bound you to a fate that was set out before you, long before you knew. You have forged your own path. I am so very proud of you,” he said finally and Draco bobbed his head, feeling his lower lip tremble unprompted. It was all he had wanted to hear for so long.
Harry found himself briefly chatting with a History Fellow about their research, but their similarities ended when the man announced he was undertaking research regarding the rise of Pureblood supremacy and the values behind it, and Harry politely excused himself to find Hermione. He found her standing with a Law Fellow, both of them deeply entrenched in a conversation about Magical Law extending to Magical Beings, and Harry gave up trying to follow the conversation after about 5 minutes. He told Hermione he was going to see if there was any wine left, and she waved him away without saying anything.
He was packing up as dawn came, unable to go back to sleep. He had dressed in clothes Dobby had packed for him, some jeans that he needed his school belt to hold up and a jumper that was warm but with holes in the elbows. He shoved his uniform and robes at the bottom of the bag, thinking briefly that he might never wear them again.
“Yes, we’d better,” he replied, surprised at the rasp in his voice as Blaise escorted him out of the common room. They were silent as they wound their way through the castle, up to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey was there, wrapping a bandage around the hand of a sobbing third-year girl. Pomfrey pointed them to a spare bed and patted the girl on the arm.
“Let’s go, Ron will be waiting up for us,” Hermione said, taking Harry by the arm and leading him away from the Hall. They collected their things from the makeshift cloak room which had been set up, pulled on their coats and then stepped out into the brisk night air, the stars clear in the sky above them. Hermione stood for a moment studying them but then shook her head.
The next morning, Draco scrambled out of his tent, shivering. He had not been allowed into Potter and Granger’s tent (though he could see it was a wizarding one every time one of them opened the flap), but Granger had helped him pitch his own now that the magic had worn off. She had cast a warming charm over it, since Potter had taken Draco’s wand with him into the tent without a word, and had bid him goodnight. But now it had worn off and Draco was shaking in his borrowed jumper and jacket. He looked over and saw that Potter was sitting down in front of the fire again, stoking into life. He looked pale in the winter morning light, dark smudges under his eyes and he blinked slowly at Draco as he approached, as though his eyes couldn’t quite focus even behind his glasses.
safe?” he asked and Potter nodded again.
“Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me,” the Dark Lord announced and with a flick of his wand, the Sorting Hat burst into flame. There were screams from the crowd and from Neville himself, and Draco jerked forward, about to run to grab him when another shout wrought the dawn in two.
“You sound like Hagrid,” Weasley said, stretching his arms out in front of him and wincing as the new skin pulled taut. Draco noticed that Weasley’s strange, winding scars had also reformed. Dittany couldn’t heal everything, the scars over his chest attested to that. Weasley continued, “It’s a dragon, Hermione, it can look after itself. It’s us we need to worry about,” and Hermione blinked at him, frowning.
They wound their way out of the Eastern gallery, where his bedroom was tucked away, and down to the Stone Stairs. While the house had evolved and grown with the whims of the Malfoys who had come before, there had always been the Stone Stairs. The stairs were worn and darkened where the feet of generations past had walked up and down them, and now there were Death Eaters sprawled over them. One of them was even reading, a leather-bound tome which could have only come from the library. Draco clenched his jaw at a particularly rough page-turn. It felt sacrilegious, like a desecration.
Snape was announced as the new Headmaster at the feast. Around him, the Slytherin table had exploded into cheers and jeers, but Draco remained frozen to his seat, staring dumbly up at the High Table. He knew, of course, but the reality of it hadn’t hit until now. On either side of Snape, McGonagall and Flitwick sat with identical expressions of practiced pleasant neutrality, though he could see the fire burning in McGonagall’s eyes. At the furthest end of the High Table sat the Carrows, who Draco recognised from the Manor. They were usually found skulking at the end of galleries and it looked like their new positions, though Draco could only guess at their subjects, would give them the same opportunity at Hogwarts.
“You’re not going to go inside?” Granger hissed from Draco’s other side, looking incredulous. “It looks unsafe, you might – oh, Harry, look!” she whispered and Draco turned to look as well.
"It was one of you that took them! One of the Death Eaters, someone that you fucking knew, Malfoy! Someone who probably sat in your fucking house, had dinner at your fucking dining table, probably fucking tortured Muggles right next to you, SOMEONE YOU KNEW. You fucking tell me, Malfoy, who the fuck has taken my sons, because I swear to Merlin, I will rip them limb from limb," Harry screamed back, taking a few steps forward, reaching to grab the front of Malfoy's jumper, but Neville was there suddenly, putting himself between them.
“Harry, I’m short-listed too!” Hermione shouted down the line at him, and Harry was glad he had taken the phone away from his ear. “Do you think Malfoy was too? I’ll write to him in the morning, just to check. Oh Harry, this is amazing!” there was a rustle as Ron passed the phone back to Hermione. “Ron - are you going back to sleep?” she said in amazement and Harry laughed.
“I’m on it!”
"Draco," Harry said quietly, almost like a moan, looking down at the floor. Draco paused and looked over his shoulder, down at the floor and at Harry's anguished expression. He stepped back a few steps and took Harry's hand in his own, held it tight.
And when the Aurors came knocking, Harry had told them the truth. His husband had tried to kill their sons. Harry had shut the door behind them, while Malfoy was dragged, crying, from the house.
Belinda bustled in a few minutes later with a tray of tea and pastries, and tutted at the mess, but found a spot on top of a filing cabinet to settle the tray and then left them to it. They sat in silence while a warming charm kept the tea hot.
“Headmaster Snape bids you to enter,” it intoned gravely and then it moved aside, revealing the moving staircase. Draco gestured for Isobel to go first and she did, tossing back her head of chestnut hair and striding forward. Draco, rolling his eyes once more, followed her.
“ROOKWOOD!” Percy bellowed from behind Draco and then he charged away, disappearing into the skirmish.
“Where the hell were you?” Harry whispered to him as Draco took his hand, and the few Gryffindors in front of them turned and gave them both a wide-eyed look before turning back to face the Slytherins.
He blinked the world back into focus, remade it in his vision, and he was cocooned in semi-darkness, only a faint ringing in his ears. He groaned and tried to push himself up but there was a large piece of stone debris over his chest, holding him in place.
There was no guarantee that Potter and Granger (for ‘Phineas’, whoever he was, had said that Weasley had left them) were even in Dalby forest now – they may have moved on. Still, it was the only information he had to go on, and he had to try. He leaned back to look upwards and was stunned to see the Milky Way bright above him. Years of Astrology lessons crept back into his mind and he tried to study the stars, but he was too tired.
“I studied History of the Dark Arts,” Harry said, interrupting Hermione. He wanted to be the one to say it, and he wasn’t surprised to see Malfoy’s eyes widened. He plowed on. “Specifically with a focus on post 18th Century Dark Arts. I wrote my dissertation for my Bachelors on the Rise and Fall of Grindelwald and the Dark Artefacts he used in his consolidation of power,” he explained, watching as Malfoy's eyebrows slowly rose.
“Tatiana was just worried about not knowing anyone at Hogwarts,” Ginny explained to him and he smiled.
A hand reached through first, young and slim, with calluses on the palm from gripping a broom. A curled lock of white-blond hair and then his own green eyes, a slim nose. Albus was emerging from the mirror.
Draco uncorked the vial and allowed some of the dittany to pool onto his fingers. He paused for a second, looking at the angry red mark and then leaned over Potter again, using the pipette of the vial to drop some of the liquid on. It smoked and Potter groaned again but he soon settled and Draco took a second to rub the dittany in, covering the whole mark. It smoked slightly and began to heal, but the skin was still dark and painful looking even after a minute.
“You too, Mrs Malfoy. Is Draco in? He invited me over,” he said and she nodded, gesturing for him to come in. Harry unwound his scarf as he came into the entrance hall, eyes roving over the details around him. He remembered being half-walked, half-dragged across this hall, his face swollen and stinging, his vision obscured, his scar burning. He felt a chill go down his spine but tried to suppress it. What had harmed him them couldn’t harm him now.
"Have you spoken to Rose? Have you asked her, has she seen them?" he asked as the thought swung into his mind. Their children had been raised as cousins, the boys Weasleys in everything but name, and as they were so close in age, they spent most of their time with Rose, who was undoubtedly one of their best friends. With a frown, Hermione shook her head.
“That’s the symbol of Grindelwald, isn’t it?” he asked and Potter made a small noise of triumph.
!” Rowle began to scream anew and twist on the floor in agony and the snake, Nagini, lifted her head slightly and tracked his movements, as if mesmerised. Next to Rowle, Dolohov stirred a little and then seemed to fall back into unconsciousness. From the trickle of blood pooling around Dolohov’s open mouth where it rested on the slate, Draco imagined that Yaxley had got to him first. As the Dark Lord let out a
“Bellatrix,” Blaise said darkly and Draco felt his jaw tighten. “Who is she?” Blaise asked gently and Draco coughed wetly. He realised he was crying.
“You set off the Caterwauling charm?” one of the Death Eaters asked and Aberforth argued back as Draco crept further along the side street, his back to the wall. He felt it dip slightly into a doorway and he reached up a hand, trying the handle – thankfully, it was open and he slipped backwards inside, shutting and locking the door behind him.
Dumbledore, you
“Find Harry Potter,” Dobby told him firmly. “He will help you, and in return you must” –  he gave Draco a solemn look – “help Harry Potter, Master Draco, if only for Dobby and all other house-elves,” he said quietly and Draco nodded, a lump forming in his throat.
Hermione lay next to him on her side, coughing and shuddering and Weasley was on his hands and knees, panting, but Harry was already on his feet, breathlessly casting their usual warding spells, shuddering every now and then with the cold.
“Dobby does not know where Harry Potter is,” Dobby said slowly, as if weighing up his next words. “Headmaster Snape asked all house-elves this, and none knew where Harry Potter is. But if Master Draco wishes to leave Hogwarts to find Harry Potter.” He paused then, the corners of his mouth pinching as though the words were a struggle to say. “Then Dobby will help Master Draco leave – in secret,” he added in a whisper and Draco gaped at him for a minute.
“One more try,” he said and Potter nodded and took a step back as Draco turned back to face the clearing. He took a moment to think about it. The warmth of the blanket over him, the heat of Potter’s fingers loosely holding onto his wrist, the warm if befuddled look that Potter gave him as he woke up. “
“I long suspected what he might have become. What he had been. We all must live with our demons, Mr Malfoy. Well –” He raised his arms then, and the chains rattled in the empty room. “Some of us must die with them,” he added mournfully and Draco studied him, contemplative.
“Move!” Amycus snapped at Finnigan who had managed to heave himself up onto all fours. Draco rushed to help him, but Finnigan swatted him away.
When he was done, Draco turned back around to find Potter and Granger’s tent gone and only Granger carrying a small bag looped around her wrist. Draco shrugged on his backpack and joined them in the centre of the clearing. Potter had stamped out the remains of the fire and kicked the ash into the surrounding dirt to disguise that there had ever been a campsite there to begin with.
“I didn’t think so,” he said cooly and he returned his attention back to his original speech, “as Head Boy and Head Girl, you will both have duties unique to your position. Like Prefects, you can give or deduct house points. You will also be able to change any common room password if required – all you will need to do is place your wand flat to the common room entrance and announce what you want the new password to be. You can and will be asked to assist professors in lessons, including covering any lessons should the professor be absent or needed elsewhere. You may be asked to referee Quidditch matches. In the event of an unlikely emergency” – here Snape gave them a grim smile – “you will be asked to assist in the protection and evacuation of the castle. Do you have any questions?” he asked them both, though his tone suggested that they shouldn’t have. They both shook their heads. “Once again, I offer my congratulations to you both. Especially as this year continues, we should expect changes in the curriculum, and I expect you both to lead your fellow students on the right path,” Snape said ominously and Draco exchanged a quick look with Isobel, who did not look convinced. Snape turned back to the papers on his desk. “You may go,” he said, dismissing them both.
“It’s almost dawn. Time to wake up, Malfoy,” he said and then the dream dissolved.
They stepped off the pavement, and the woman turned away at once, as if expecting it, and began back down the lane. They followed her down a few cottages and then she turned and hobbled down an overgrown front path. She fumbled with a key at the front door of the wattle and daub cottage as they shuffled down the path, Potter leading the way, Draco behind him and then Granger behind Draco. She was breathing shakily behind him and even as they approached the door, she whispered to him.
!” Draco shouted, pointing his wand at the previously concealed entrance, and the two Death Eaters that had followed them crashed into an invisible wall with sickening crunches. They scrambled to their feet just in time to hear Ron yell “Get back!” and then a herd of galloping desks thundered past, Professor McGonagall leading the charge, and they followed in her wake, throwing themselves into the frey.
He had redecorated this room himself, after Malfoy had left, and it took up the entire floor. The door opened directly into a comfortable seating area, with a Muggle TV and DVD player in one corner and a large, over-stuffed armchair set at an angle to it, with a couch big enough to lounge on opposite. A blanket was thrown over the back of it, and Harry's heart lurched as he remembered how, last night, the night
It had been Molly Weasley who had come barrelling through the fireplace at 4am, taken in Malfoy trembling in a corner, rocking backwards and forwards, muttering to himself, and Harry, pale and exhausted, in front of her, and she had pulled herself up to her greatest height and nodded, as if steeling herself for the forthcoming events.
“You were mistaken,” he said firmly, jerking the curtains closed again, his heart pounding in his chest. What else had Crabbe heard?
"Right, on you get!" Ron cried, opening the nearest door and, with Harry's help, loaded the children's trunks in. Rose scampered in, her brother following behind her, while Albus and Scorpius lingered. Harry drew them both in for a hug and kissed the tops of their heads, promised that they would both be up for their first Hogsmeade weekend, and then let the boys go.
And the man who gave birth to them.
"I came home from work to find both boys face down in a bath tub of water and you sitting next to them," Harry said, his voice sounding hollow even to himself.
Potter was screaming something into the night as he fell, his wand lifted as he cast a spell, for what Draco couldn’t tell and then the Dark Lord was screaming to the final Death Eater “Your wand, Selwyn, give me your wand!” and he was coming level with Potter again, teeth bared, wand raised and Draco could only watch as he fell through the sky with Potter, waiting for the moment when –
!” Amycus cried. The red light flared and Longbottom began to convulse but he didn’t scream. He fell back onto the floor hard enough to knock his head and still, Longbottom didn’t scream. Amycus kept pushing him, and still Longbottom remained silent.
“Harry, what are you doing?” she asked and Potter rounded on her.
The house-elves knew he had been struggling to sleep. They had slipped him something in the tea.
“Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand, a long time ago,” Potter said over the sound of seagulls. “I saw You-Know-Who trying to find him. When he tracked him down, he found that Gregorovitch didn’t have it any more; it was stolen from him by Grindelwald. How Grindelwald found out that Gregorovitch had it, I don’t know – but if Gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread the reumour, it can’t have been difficult.” He blinked and it seemed like his eyes were closed for a second too long, and then they opened again. His eyes were bright against the dark smudges under them, and Potter swayed slightly where he stood.
“That’s Lee Jordan!” Hermione said, frowning, her book slipping closed. Weasley turned to face her, elated.
“Oh, Merlin. She was…” he said, struggling for words. Umbridge had been awful, in her own way, to even the Inquisitorial Squad. She rewarded them even more for ratting each other out than if it was just another student. Blaise had worn the incorrect uniform one day and Pansy had told – he had been given three detentions and the next opportunity he had, he implied that Pansy had been fraternising with a sixth-year Ravenclaw. Despite her protests, Pansy had been given detention too.
“I say we jump when it gets low enough!” Harry shouted back and Hermione’s grip on Draco’s cloak tightened – she’d had it in strangle hold the whole way. “Straight into the water before it realises we’re here!” Harry continued and Draco wanted to strangle him, but he knew it was the right idea.
“All student letters are read for any subversive material. Surely you’ve realised that,” Snape replied coolly as Draco slipped the letter out from the envelope. It was his mother’s flowery handwriting, cursive and perfect, not an ink blot on the page.
They were playing a game of sorts, Draco realised – edging around each other, waiting for the other to strike or give ground. It was very Slytherin of her, and he suddenly deeply missed the Slytherin common room, and felt a hot flush of shame as tears welled into his eyes. He blinked rapidly and Granger frowned, her wand twitching in her hand.
Safety.
Did they, any of them, really trust each other? Could they rely on each other in a fight? Draco didn’t think so. He thought that half of them would sell their Grandmothers for a minute of the Dark Lord’s time. He thought the Dark Lord might accept their trade, in some cases.
“No sword,” Weasley repeated, scowling. “That double-crossing little scab–” he started but Draco interrupted him.
“I’d rather be in control of all my faculties, thanks,” Draco interrupted him blandly, and Snape inclined his head. They sat in awkward silence for a long while.
“Draco, Draco, he’s gone,” someone was whispering next to him, trying to soothe him but Draco screamed.
’ and was just turning to look at more when Granger called out again. Draco rolled his eyes, half-expecting it to be another false alarm, but then she said “They’re here… right here,” and even Potter jogged over, his face a picture of hope and grief.
The other maze was the one from the Triwizard Tournament. Draco could remember the feeling of his heart in his throat when Potter had reappeared at the entrance, having disappeared without a trace an hour before, with Cedric Diggory slumping dead to the ground next to him. The screams that followed haunted Draco for weeks after.
“I understand,” he finally replied and then they lapsed into silence. “Will you remember this dream?” he asked and Potter shrugged one shoulder and gave him a small smile.
,’ at the top, but then his brain stuttered and he couldn’t think of what else to write.
His heart nearly stuttered to halt when Harry saw there was a new letter in the post tray on the kitchen counter, charmed to transport any post from the mailbox at the building entrance to the tray. He took a shuddering breath before reaching for it, weighing it in his hands. It felt light, which wasn’t always a good sign. His name and address was neatly printed on the front of the letter and Harry turned it over to rip open the envelope.
“No, I don’t think it will,” he admitted.
“You could learn a lesson from him, boy,” came a slurring voice and Draco looked up to see his father watching him from between curtains of lank hair that had fallen around his face. Mother drew back in her chair and smoothed her skirt. “Loyal to the end. His father must have been so very proud,” Father said and Mother shot him a stern look.
What he had done was unforgivable, and Harry had made sure that his name was stricken from every record, every piece of paperwork relating to the boys, made sure that he couldn't contact them or talk to them, or even come within 100 feet of them.
“I’ll take the first watch. Hermione, could I borrow your wand please?” he asked and she nodded, drawing hers out from the sleeve of her jumper and passing it over. Potter took an old cushion from one of the armchairs and dropped it to the floor at the entrance to the tent, and sat down on it cross-legged, looking out at the snow. Hermione gave his back an affectionate smile and then went to the kitchen, pulling out a dusty jar from one of the cabinets. She pointed her wand at it and a ball of blue fire appeared within. She went back over to Harry and held it out to him.
Outside, Potter was sitting on one of the logs, catching and releasing a Snitch with one hand, the other holding a large piece of parchment open on his lap. Draco stared at the Snitch, feeling a small tightening in his chest. He missed Quidditch. He missed playing the game with his teammates, and he even missed matches against Potter. He was an excellent Seeker, better than Draco, even if it pained Draco to admit it to himself.
“If it is Potter, you need to take us to Malfoy Manor,” he shouted over the hubbub of noise. The Snatchers quieted a little. “The Dark Lord resides with my family. He will reward you greatly if you take Potter directly to him,” he added and he heard an outraged noise from his left – Weasley, he was sure.
“Is this the time?” Ron said teasingly from behind them and there was a smack and a returning ‘
“What’s going on?” he asked, stifling a yawn. Granger cast a look over her shoulder at him and adjusted in her seat, lifting the book that she was holding over her head to him. Draco took it and squinted at it.
“No, I’ll stay and watch,” and he leaned against the stone garden wall and waited while Potter dug a grave.
“I swear,” Draco said, holding his voice steady and firm. “I’m here to help. I don’t want to hurt either of you, and I am not being compelled to follow any orders.” The Truthlight did not flicker. Granger lowered her wand, obviously satisfied. “Did Potter tell you I’ve been talking to him in his dreams?” he asked and her poker face was very good – if she was surprised by anything he said, she did not give it away.
“Yes, it did,” he said. “I wouldn’t have asked you to keep holding on if it didn’t,” he said and Potter made a face, as if confused.
They started to laugh, and Draco could not stop once he’d started. He’d calm a second to catch his breath and then he’d catch Hermione’s eye and they’d both start laughing again until their ribs ached and tears streamed down their faces. Harry fell onto his back, dragging Draco down with him until Draco was pulled onto Harry’s chest, his ear pressed over Harry’s heart.
“Harry-” Granger gasped but Potter was still moving at speed, looking intently ahead.
“Draco, what is going on?” Pansy asked, leaning closer and practically hissing in his ear. She was warm and soft next to him and if this had been six months ago, he would’ve maybe suggested a late night rendez-vous, but now he wanted to slide down onto the floor and crawl away. “You’ve barely touched your food all week, you nearly caused a potions mishap, and you, frankly, look like someone’s given you two black eyes. What is it?” she asked, and Draco rolled one shoulder, somewhere between shrugging and knocking her hand off.
“Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!”
The moon was full over the trees as the first heat rose in the Dark Mark. It stung, like he had fallen into a thatch of stinging nettles, and then it burned and then it seared. Quickly, Draco snuffed the fire and bundled himself into the tent. The pain from the Dark Mark was burning up his arm and he grabbed a t-shirt from the bag and shoved it into his mouth, using it to stifle the sounds of pain that eventually gave way to screaming.
“Swear it,” she said and the tip of her wand began to glow. Draco understood – Truthlight.
"What do you mean?" Harry asked, gesturing to the Manor which rose like a nightmare in front of them, set a top a hill which was covered in a fine mist this morning. Begbie gestured them closer, and Harry led the way.
“Potter!” she called, stepping off the platform as the remaining students pushed past her to get to Kingsley. “Aren’t you supposed to be looking for something?” she said significantly, and Harry looked confused for a second before realisation dawned.
“STOP! Do not touch it, we shall all perish if the Dark Lord comes now!” His father paused where his finger was hovering the Mark on his forearm, confused. Bellatrix stepped away from the prisoners and went over to some of the Snatchers, specifically the one holding the Sword of Gryffindor. “What is that?” she snapped.
“We need to get into Hogwarts,” Harry said, after Aberforth hadn’t spoken. “If you can’t help us, we’ll wait ‘til daybreak, leave you in peace and try to find a way in ourselves. If you can help us – well, now would be a great time to mention it,”
Gone was Bathilda Bagshot. Writhing on the floor was a great snake and Draco’s mouth went dry at the realisation –
“I seek a treasure, Baron,” Draco finally said. The ghost’s chains clinked as he moved slightly. “A treasure that I believe another has cursed. Did you know Tom Riddle?” he said and the Baron’s eyebrows rose. His doublet was spotted with darker marks that shone iridescent in the light from the fireplace.
“Are you hungry darling? Are you hurt?” she whispered to him, pushing his hair back again and Draco resisted ducking out of her embrace.
," Harry told her sharply and her mouth shut with a
“Actually, yes. I’m studying Pureblood anthropology and genealogy,” he said and Harry felt a cold shiver go through him.
"But - but I dropped them off. At Kings Cross. I left them there, they knew where to go, how…"
“Yes, at Magdalen College. What about you? I heard you went off to the Continent for your degree?” she asked, and Malfoy bobbed his head once - his white blond hair caught the light and for a second turned into a halo around his head.
“There is no time, Master Draco. Dobby has packed some things from the laundry for you – Dobby hopes they fit,” Dobby said and Draco felt a rush of gratitude for the elf. He had abandoned his satchel in the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, leaving everything aside from his wand in his rush to get to Snape, and for a moment he was desperate to go back and get it, to have something of his own to take with him, but he knew time was of the essence.
“What is this?” a woman’s cold voice asked and Draco gasped.
. He fetched his book from the window sill and opened it to the last page he could remember reading and then stared at the page blankly, not taking the words in.
"Don't “Harry' me! Don't use that tone of voice! They're - they're going to be fine, we'll find them, we have to - we have to find them, I don't," and he clapped a hand over his mouth to stifle the rising urge to scream. Malfoy looked alarmed and stood up too, moving to stand next to Harry, a hand on his shoulder.
“I am searching for… an object. A cursed one - a
“I know, that’s why they’ll be Apparating directly into the bar,” he said simply and Aberforth looked like he was about to protest. “Just send them down the passage when they get here, will you? Thanks a lot,” he said.
“What do you seek, young Mr Malfoy?” the Baron asked in his low, gravelly voice. Draco had only heard him speak once before. It had been when he had spent the night sleeping in the Great Hall with the rest of the school after Sirius Black had broken in on Halloween in his third year. He had been awake, listening to the hum of whispers around him, when he had heard the Baron speaking to someone else, pleading it sounded like.
Harry landed on the front step of Grimmauld Place, a second behind Hermione who was already opening the door. She gave a little flinch as he landed, and he reached for her, concerned.
“Thought we’d find you here,” Crabbe said into the silence. Draco whirled around, fingers already around the hilt of his wand.
he heard there. Harry stroked Draco’s hair away from his face and let out a small breath.
The three hours flew by, one hour devoted to each question. He had also chosen ’
“Hermione, you studied at Magdalen College. That’s just down the road, isn’t it?” he asked and she tutted.
“No, sorry,” he admitted and she sighed and stood. Draco followed her, shaking the cloak slightly to dislodge any snow that might have gathered around his knees. He joined her as they wound their way amongst the graves. As he walked down the path, he was suddenly aware of the complete darkness around them and he looked over at the church – the stained windows had gone dark. The lights had been turned off and they were now alone in the church yard.
. It was impossible. It was a lie.
“Don’t worry,” she told him with her dreamy voice. “I know you didn’t know. I can’t blame you for what your family did,” she told him in a matter-of-fact voice and he gave her a weak smile and then slipped out of the backdoor.
to answer, not just a question he knew he could.
in sync. Another four stepped forward, and another, until it was only Harry, Ron, Hermione and Malfoy left behind, along with Begbie, who eyed them all suspiciously.
Row upon row of graves were lined up behind the church, the tombstones dusted with snow that covered the dates of most of the deceased. An angel stood watch over one of the graves, her hands raised and pressed together in prayer, and the marble caught the flecks of light coming from the stained glass windows, staining her tears a vibrant red in the light. Potter moved off the trenches they were carving to look at one of the graves and his voice was piercingly loud in the otherwise silent church yard.
He would never get to say ‘goodbye’. He would never get to say ‘sorry’. He would never get to say ‘thank you’. All of it, all the possibilities the future had held, were gone.
“Only dissenters would dare to use his real name. It preserves the cult around him,” he said and Weasley frowned.
“How do we get in?” he called, trying to force the gate open. Draco turned desperately.
“And why would that be?” Hermione asked coolly, tilting her head – Draco suppressed a shiver, the gesture too reminiscent of his aunt.
“Too nice,” he hissed in her ear as they passed Tom, who looked stunned at the morning greeting. “My Aunt would never bid someone ‘good morning’ like a common Muggle,” he explained to her in a firm tone and Hermione took a steadying breath.
“There’s no way to stop it. The Mark is cursed. I’m assuming it’s burning because they’re trying to call you back?” she asked Draco, who nodded and stifled a sob. “Is there anything that can soothe the pain?” she asked and Draco raised his arm a little, motioning to where Potter was still holding it around the wrist.
's and “
He was not there. Neither were Ron and Hermione. He was about to take a step forward to search for them when something seized him around the middle and pulled him backward, sliding fabric over his head.
’,” he told the wall and the stones glowed for a brief second and then groaned their acknowledgement. The stones slid aside, revealing the short passageway into the underground dungeon.
Hermione reappeared a few minutes later, looking a little pale but relieved. She collapsed into the seat next to Harry, who gave her an enquiring look. She held up a hand and turned it from side to side, and Harry understood that she wasn’t sure if her Viva was enough… They didn’t speak until the doorway to the room Hermione had exited opened again, and another Fellow stepped through.
“Alas, I also! Gold, filthy gold,” he said with a conspiratorial laugh. “We cannot live without it, yet I confess I deplore the necessity of consorting with our long-fingered friends.” He offered his arm to Hermione and the rustle of her cloak drowned out the noise of Harry gasping behind them. Draco forced himself not to look.
Draco nodded, closing his eyes and thinking hard, screwing up his face in concentration. It was like every happy memory he had went fleeing from his mind. He scrambled about to find one and finally settled on his eighth birthday party, when a Magical Menagerie had set up in the gardens of the Manor – he had spent all day with Fire Salamanders, Bowtruckles and Nifflers. He took a steadying breath and nodded.
“We look like Muggles!” he hissed at her and Granger gave him a rueful look.
Both boys had been face-down in the tub. With a strangled shout, Harry had pulled them both out and taken them both straight to St. Mungos, ripping apart the Anti-Apparition wards all over Grimmauld Place. Both boys had been saved just in time, the Healer had told him.
Greyback let out a low appreciative whistle and Draco tried to stifle the panic rising in his throat. “Ve-e-ery nice,” Greyback said, taking it off the Snatcher with a low hum of appreciation. “Oh, very nice indeed. Looks goblin-made, that. Where did you get something like this?” he asked the group and Potter spoke before anyone else.
"Oh, he's in there. He wouldn't have set Obscura otherwise," he said. Ron made a noise of agreement.
Voldemort had said something but now Harry was speaking again. Draco tried to stand, propped up between Ron and Hermione, who held him tightly between them.
“Yes, well done. I wouldn’t have thought you had it in you, the way you went on about the NEWT exams,” Hermione said, though she smiled to take away some of the sting. Harry grinned, and set his glass down.
He had dropped the boys off at King's Cross, but hadn't taken them to the platform, as he had been running late for a meeting with the other Heads of Department. He had bid them goodbye and then found a quiet place to Disapparate. Between then and when McGonagall had floo'd him, he didn't know what had happened. No one could figure out if the boys had managed to get on the train or not. Harry told Dumbledore about the scorched message, and Malfoy had conjured an image of it for Dumbledore to look over.
He dropped down from the mantlepiece and reached for Harry, pulling him into a hug.
“You said you were studying Anthropology and Genealogy, Malfoy?” Harry asked, nodding his thanks when he received his own pint glass. Malfoy took his seat and began meticulously pouring out his Dandelion and Burdock like he had yesterday, glancing up to look at Harry.
He gagged again and Blaise tugged his jumper sleeve down, hiding it.
"These trunks were spotted by Muggles, who “
"Yes," Malfoy said.
“There!” Griphook lunged once more for the sword and took it before Harry could, swinging it high out of reach. The momentum swung the cup off the sword and high into the air, sending it arcing over their heads. Draco watched it fall and then Harry dove for it, the goblin holding on for dear life. He caught it, letting out another yell of pain as the cup burned his hand and duplicates rained from it.
“HARRY, NO!” Weasley roared and Draco jumped up from the chair, hand raised to slap over Potter’s mouth but it was too late.
and the single wisp of silver smoke fell limply from his wand and then was carried away on the chill wind.
“Would sir be liking some Headache Tonic?” it asked in a squeaky voice and Draco stared at it for a second before nodding and taking the glass, draining it in two gulps. He held the empty glass out and the house-elf took it from him. “Can Mibby be getting sir another glass?” she asked and Draco shook his head.
“Saturday, actually,” he said, raising his eyebrows. He jotted down a note on some spare paper to remind himself to organise a Portkey.
“I can’t see them, though. And I need to find–” he went quiet and Draco studied him, watching until the Knut dropped and Potter sprang up from the plinth. “Come on, come on, we need to find–!” he shouted as he ran back for the staircase, Draco taking off after him, diving into the sea of students who were fleeing the castle.
He rounded the corner and found the gargoyle that guarded the Headmaster’s office. He hesitated, unsure of what the password could be. He cleared his throat and the gargoyle stirred, as if listening.
!” he said and nothing happened. He turned to look at Potter, feeling a bit like a lost child, but Potter gave him an encouraging smile.
. She handed it to Draco, who unfolded it with some trepidation – his mother received the newspaper daily but Draco hadn’t been brave enough to read it in the last few weeks. “That Granger girl’s been added to the list of Mudbloods wanted for ‘questioning’,” Pansy said with a sneer. Her upturned nose wrinkled as Draco flicked through the pages, trying to keep his hands steady. “They can’t find her anywhere, apparently,” she added and Blaise scoffed.
But he had, and the landing had been rough.
The oak door creaked again and this time the room fell into a still hush. A rustling sound met Draco’s ears before he even saw them approach, and then the Dark Lord was entering the room, his long robes dragging along the ground behind him, his awful great snake slithering along next to him. Aunt Bellatrix entered behind him and practically skipped to her seat as the rest of the table rose to a stand, some Death Eaters struggling to keep their balance. The Dark Lord paid them little attention as he took his place at the head of the table. He did not sit.
The storm crashed overhead as they sank to the cool tiled floor, mouths pressed against whatever part of the other’s body they could reach. Harry kissed Draco’s wrist, Draco kissed his shoulder, and on and on they went, losing their pyjamas bottoms in the process, Draco pressed back into the floor, the storm drowning out the soft noises they made.
Suddenly from upstairs there was a
“An invisibility cloak?” he said in disbelief and Potter nodded. Draco stepped forward and reached for the empty space where Potter’s body would be. His hand met something solid and he held it for a second while Potter watched his face.
“That didn’t help much, did it dear?” the mirror asked him in a pitying tone and he momentarily thought about throwing a paperweight at it, but resisted. He joined his mother in the corridor and she gave him a smile and straightened his robe.
“And an owl!” another added helpfully.
“No,” Hermione whispered and then she was sprinting across the clearing, passing through the wards and launching herself at Ronald Weasley, whose face had just come into the light as he stepped out of the treeline. His joyous expression collapsed inwards as Hermione landed the first blow across his shoulder.
He flew down the marble staircase, taking hairpin turns down corridors until he turned the corner into that basement corridor and came face-to-face with the portrait. He paused, unsure of how to get in, having never seen it opened, but he banged a palm to the pear, which squealed in surprise.
“Sword,” the Snatcher grunted and Bellatrix reached out a hand.
“Easy enough to check,” Scabior said. “But the ‘old lot of ‘em look like they could still be ‘Ogwarts age-”
He stepped through the small doorway and nearly fell to his knees. The library was double-storied, a small balcony running the length of the room, bookcases above and below it, and each row crammed with books. One section had chains running down it, and another section was kept behind a glass door, but the rest of the books were organised and freely available.
Potter, holding onto the motorbike with only his knees now, looked around, panicked and Draco could hear the Dark Lord scream “Mine!” over the shriek of the wind. Draco watched as the Dark Lord raised his wand and Potter, whether from fear or some other emotion, closed his eyes as the Dark Lord said “
“Get Bill!” Draco shouted as Potter began twitching in his arms. He laid him down gently on his side, and smoothed his hair back, muttering soothingly to him. There was the crunch of sand behind him and he turned to see Hermione staggering towards them, Ron a redheaded blur in the distance as he sprinted back to the cottage.
"The frame, Hermione, the
The only person Draco hadn’t really spoken to was Harry, who seemed to slip out of the room as soon as he could at every chance. Draco was stung by it, haunted by the memory of the kisses they had shared in the Rustic Temples, but he tried to ignore the ache in his heart.
“I really am pleased for you, Hermione. I guess things have changed since I was last home,” he said and she reached over and took his hand, prying it off his pint glass to squeeze it.
“Dobby has packed everything for you, Master Draco. There is a tent and clothes and even some food,” Dobby said as Mibby came back over, brandishing a small stack of sandwiches, which she placed neatly into a brown paper bag. Dobby undid the top of the backpack and carefully wedged the bag in before tying it all back up again. He gestured and Draco took it, hefting it over his shoulders. “Follow me, Master Draco,” he said and the elves parted, letting Draco walk between them as he followed Dobby.
"Thank you, Lee. Ladies and gentlemen of the Wizarding World, I have the sad task today of telling you all that the sons of Harry Potter, twelve-year-olds Albus Severus and Scorpius Hyperion, were kidnapped today on their way to Hogwarts for the start of the September term. A message was left by the kidnapper at Platform 9¾, but the Aurors do not yet know if this was where they were taken, or if this was left after the kidnapping took place. We are urging all members of the public to come forward to the MLE if they witnessed anything suspicious between the hours of 11am and 5pm today, that could be related to the boys being taken. Please contact the Auror office on the dedicated floo line," she said and there was silence from Lee's end.
She signed it off with a kiss that Draco ran his thumb over, even as his pulse pounded in his ears.
"Those boys, Grandmama - they're my sons," he told her with a smile, and Delphinia looked as though she had swallowed a lemon. "And that man," he gestured at Harry, "He's their other father. My father, he kidnapped them yesterday. He took them from Kings Cross, and we've come to get them,"
The pamphlet could have been there for months, for all Draco knew, but it was all he had to go on. He settled the stone back into the ground and stood, tucking the pamphlet into his jeans pocket and then turning sharply on his heel, Disapparating with a sharp
as a House Elf appeared.
“How’d it go?” Hermione asked, standing, and Harry nodded, shoving his hands into his trouser pockets.
“Password is
“And you’re sure that’s where they are?” Snape was asking and then was an impatient tsk in reply.
that!” Draco said furiously, dropping into one of the armchairs. Hermione gave him a pained expression.
“Finnigan,” Carrow eventually said and Seamus Finnigan stood up from the cluster of Gryffindors, his face pale but his eyes determined. He moved to join Draco in front of the desks and held himself stiffly, as though he was waiting to pounce. Draco couldn’t look him in the eyes.
“All right, leaders up here, and we’ll divide up the troops!” he was saying as McGonagall turned her sharp gaze back to Harry.
“They’re scared. They want to do something to help,” she replied and Draco huffed impatiently.
"Have you seen them? Heard anything? You have connections all over, you must have heard something?" Malfoy asked Dumbledore a little desperately, and Harry nodded along. Yes - surely Dumbledore would know
"I'm sure my father would be simultaneously horrified and overjoyed to hear it," he said and Harry frowned. He set the jumper down on his lap and began to fold it, finding the careful movements soothing.
“Looks more like a Stinging Jinx to me,” Father said, leaning closer to Potter. He reached behind his back again, flapping a hand and summoning Draco forward once more. “There’s something there… it could be the scar, stretched tight… Draco, come here, look properly! What do you think?”
!’ as Hermione hit him on the arm. “Hey, where’s Ginny?” Ron asked and Draco broke from Harry, looking around, frowning.
“Would you be?” he asked through clenched teeth and Snape sniffed but didn’t reply right away. His fingers tapped on his thigh, and then he let out a little sigh as he began to speak.
"You'd better come with me. I don't imagine you have anywhere to stay tonight," he heard himself say, and Malfoy nodded once, standing up straight, and following Harry from the door. Belinda was sat at her desk, a quick-notes quill writing up the minutes from this morning's meeting as she dictated them. She glanced up as Harry walked past, going for his outer robes that hung on a peg on the nearby wall.
so much in those first few weeks, shrieks and weak hiccuping sobs of “Papa', their faces red and tear-stained. But Harry had pushed through and stopped mentioning Malfoy to the boys until eventually, one day, they stopped asking. And Harry had never found the right time to tell them.
“There’s only one other place I’ve seen that book,” he said and Granger perked up, interested again, “And that was in my father’s vault in the Manor. That book is
What was Malfoy doing here, of all places?
“What?” Harry asked and Hermione gave him a rueful smile.
“Look… look at it…” he said, and Draco frowned into the darkness as Granger began to shake her head in confusion.
The wall of smell from the room behind it hit Draco as soon as he entered, and he clapped a hand over his mouth to stop himself from gagging. Potter wrinkled his nose but as soon as the door was shut, slipped out of the cloak anyway and Granger followed suit, leaving Draco still hidden under it. The room was dimly lit by a few gas lanterns, and Draco could see the woman more clearly now. She was hunched over with age, and her hands were mottled in the dim light, purple and blue with white knuckles. Her eyes were milky with cataracts and her skin was pale and fragile looking, like ancient paper. Draco was surprised she could have even guessed that there was anybody in front of the cottage – he doubted she could even see the tip of her nose.
“I’b Bardy,” he said, his voice even more muffled now. “Bardy Weadley,” he said and Scabior looked over to Draco, who shrugged one shoulder.
“And then there’s this,” Harry said, turning back to Dumbledore, pulling the Elder Wand free and holding it up for the portraits to see. Even in his exhausted and aching state, Draco looked upon the wand with reverence, and he could see the same look on Ron and Hermione’s faces. The most powerful wand of all time was in this very room with them. Harry glanced back at them and frowned. “I don’t want it,” he eventually said, turning back to face Dumbledore’s portrait.
!” he shouted, pointing his wand and there was a flash of red light before Fenrir paused in his steps. He choked, once, twice, gagged and then vomited up black bile. Draco lept back as Ron yelped, and Fenrir continued to gag and vomit, black bile turning red as things began to emerge from his throat and mouth, red ropes of flesh. His skin turned grey and clammy and then his eyes rolled into the back of his head and he collapsed sideways onto the stone floor, dead, surrounded by a pool of his own blood, choked on his own entrails.
“The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hand but his-”
“Dumbledore bequeathed it to me. This symbol – it’s been drawn in, it’s not part of the print. And Harry here says that Viktor Krum told him it was a symbol of Grindelwald, but there’s no mention of it in anything I’ve read about him,” she said, flinging a hand out at Potter who was watching them with one eyebrow raised, as if in disbelief.
“It’s Travers,” he told Hermione out of the corner of his mouth. “Second circle Death Eater. Works in the Ministry,” and she nodded her acknowledgement, stepping past him and offering one hand.
“Harry!” Draco screamed and Neville turned in surprise at his voice as Voldemort raised his wand to retaliate – a shielding charm appeared out of nowhere in between the Dark Lord and Neville. Neville, seizing the opportunity, ran back, sword in hand, dragging Draco with him.
"Wandless? Really?" he asked and Harry nodded tiredly. He had managed to tap into this skill during his Auror years, and since then used it for minor things - turning on the wireless, making tea, sending Donovan from the Daily Prophet whizzing back to the elevators when he managed to sneak past security again (he hadn't tried coming back).
“Do you want to stay here Friday night then?” Hermione suggested and Harry gave a small smile, though he knew she couldn’t see it.
“All right, let’s go,” she said but as she approached, Bathilda shook her head with surprising viciousness and then pointed to herself, then Potter and then upstairs.
“Could I ask you something?” he said and Harry nodded, setting his mug down by his feet. He looked at Draco expectantly, and the other man hesitated for a second, twisting his mouth to one side in a curiously un-Malfoy-like gesture. “Were you… well, were you seeing anyone in Australia?” he blurted out and Harry grinned. He leaned back in the chair and ran a hand through his hair, making the mess even worse if Draco’s frown was anything to go by.
“Are you warm enough?” she asked and they all nodded. She nodded once in reply and then disappeared upstairs.
"Quite possibly, Harry. Review your files, look for those parents whose children chose not to return to them. You may find some intriguing leads," he pushed himself out of the chair and rose to his feet, smoothing down his robes. "I have a standing appointment to play a game of cards with the Council of Wizards, 1592, so you will have to excuse me. Galileo is most insistent upon punctuality," he said and Harry began to protest.
Draco felt someone pull on his arm but he tried to shake them off. They pulled harder and he looked up to see Ron and Hermione’s tear-stained faces looking down at him.
"Bye Dad, bye Papa!" Albus shouted out the window as the train gave a shudder and began to trundle out of the station, steam billowing around them all.
“Well, you know me, Tatiana. And your Uncle Harry and Neville too!” he said and Tatiana squirmed.
“It’s the grave from Godric’s Hollow,” he said, awestruck, and Hermione gave him a pleased smile.
“YOU’LL HAVE TO GO THROUGH ME FIRST!” Draco shouted, barging past the rest of the table, eliciting gasps from both the Gryffindor and Slytherin tables. He had his wand out already, trained on Pansy who was gaping at him, white-faced. “You touch a hair on his head Pansy and I’ll slit your fucking throat,” he snarled at her and she recoiled. Daphne Greengrass was trying to pull her back into her seat as the Gryffindors table slowly rose to their feet, wands drawn and ready in their hands. And then the Hufflepuffs stood and turned and then the Ravenclaws, their backs to Harry, facing Pansy who was finally pulled back to sitting just as Draco reached Harry.
"I… I don't know," he admitted and Malfoy nodded, taking a deep shuddering breath.
It was a code they had established last year. There was no Albert the peacock (there was an Alfred, and he was a vicious old thing) – it was code for the Dark Lord. And if Albert was ever unwell, Draco should flee. He schooled his face into a placid expression and kissed her cheek.
At three-thirty, they gathered their gowns and headed outside to Disapparate to the Bodleian Library. They crossed Radcliffe Square into the Quadrangle, where some of the short-listed applicants lingered, families and friends gathered as well. Hermione had Ron’s hand in a tight hold as she led them through to the College, and they managed to squeeze into the filled hall, the air alive with nervous energy.
“The summer before Seventh year,” Draco admitted, his eyes still bright and his cheeks flushed. He settled back in his chair, his hands folded neatly in his lap. “I had become… disillusioned by then. I wanted to prove them wrong. And I did,” he said proudly and Harry grinned at him.
The Wizarding World had been in an uproar when it came to light that they were in a relationship, and Harry certainly hadn't meant to end up in one, especially not with Malfoy. But after the War, he had struggled enormously with guilt of all those lives that had been lost in his name, and so he had wanted to speak to someone from the other side who might've understood - and that had been Malfoy, who had been under house arrest for nearly a year after the War, punished by languishing in the same building that Voldemort's memory haunted.
“How was the watch?” Potter murmured as he poured some milk (they were getting low) and Draco shrugged one shoulder.
The snow here was impacted and Draco tried not to slip as he walked directly behind Potter, reaching out one hand to touch Potter lightly on the shoulder to steady himself. Potter flinched a little, as if he had forgotten that Draco was there at all, but he kept moving ahead as villagers walked around them. A bubble of laughter came out of the pub and then they were passed it and near the church, where a high, clear voice began to sing;
"There's a guest room upstairs. I have some spare pyjamas. Come on - let's get some sleep. The b-," and here his own breathing hitched, tears quickly burning at his eyes, "
Potter shuffled over to stand in front of him, and then balanced on one leg, kicking out one trainered foot to knock against Draco’s well-worn boots. Draco looked up at him through his hair and Potter tilted his head, trying to give him an encouraging look.
It was the same schedule as yesterday. Specialised paper in the morning, General paper in the afternoon. The Fellows let them into the hall and Harry took the seat he had taken the day before, resisting the urge to touch the booklet laid face-down before him. Malfoy walked past him and spared a glance over his shoulder to look at Harry, who nodded in greeting.
“And Potter? Potter is with her? You’re certain, Phineas?” he asked and there was a
"You'll have to ask Headmistress McGonagall when you want to take it out, but I don't think she'll be too strict with you. Now, we have -," Harry looked up at the clock on the wall and his eyes widened. "Fifteen minutes to get you to the train, oh Merlin, where did the time go?! Boys, get your things! Draco, the trunks-," Harry said worriedly, and Draco nodded, abandoning his toast and going for the trunks, shrinking them down and putting them in his jacket pocket, pulling it on while Harry hustled the boys out of the kitchen and into the corridor, where they donned jackets too.
Draco was starving, he realised, and he joined the others as they helped themselves to the offered food. Aberforth returned with some goblets that looked like they could have had another cleaning charm run over them, but none of them cared, pouring themselves full glasses and drinking deeply. Full and safe (for now), Draco slumped back in the armchair and promptly fell asleep.
!” she cried and the noises Potter made were inhuman. Whether it was just his body responding to whatever he was seeing or the pain, Draco didn’t know, but he pressed Potter’s shoulders into the ground even as he jerked and writhed. Granger sobbed next to him and Draco could smell blood and flesh burning and Potter’s white eyes stared at nothing until Granger leaned back, retching.
"He's upset. He has a right to be," Harry said quietly. From her chair, Ginny's eyebrows shot up, but she didn't say anything further. Strangely, she had been one of Malfoy's most vocal supporters when they were divorcing - she argued that he had needed help rather than punishment.
“You will need to be braver still, Draco. Find courage in your heart, dear boy – and in your dreams,” and then that hand was gently pushing him, sending him backwards over the ramparts and then he was –
“Draco, is it him?” Father asked him over his shoulder and Draco, still being petted by his mother, tried to pull away, though she held him tight.
“We’ve only got half an hour until midnight, so we need to act fast! A battle plan has been agreed–” Kingsley said and Draco nodded and frowned and pretended he was listening, but he wasn’t. He studied the remaining students and the adults who lingered. There were maybe a hundred and fifty of them in total, if he had to round up. The teachers, the remaining members of the Order of the Phoenix, the seventh-years who had stayed behind and the sixth-years who were in their majority. Draco studied them and tried to imagine them as hardened fighters, but it was no use. He could not imagine them going toe-to-toe with Dark Magic and winning.
“Bed. I have a headache coming on. I’ll see you in the morning,” he told them blandly and if they didn’t believe him, neither of them protested. He left them, robes wrapped tight around him in the chill of the dungeons corridors as he took the staircase further down.
“Okay?” Harry asked quietly and Draco nestled in closer.
He knew, logically, that she was the best student in their year, or even in all of Hogwarts. She constantly beat him in tests and exams, and she never got a question wrong when called upon (and even when she wasn’t). But he had never truly believed it – maybe it was because of the things his parents used to say, but he hadn’t truly understood what that meant until he saw her stood in that clearing, her eyes tilted to the sky, reflecting the shooting stars of spells as they broke free over the wards and joined them in harmony.
“-I never thought I’d hear myself say it, but safety first!” another contributor was saying as Draco re-entered. Potter had moved back to his armchair and so Draco perched on the arm next to him. Potter slid an arm off his lap and around Draco’s back, thumb finding a bit of skin at his hip which Potter stroked lightly, sending jolts of electricity up Draco’s side.
“No! It’s just… Well, I won’t know anyone,” she said in a hushed tone and Ginny smiled.
“Griphook has agreed to get us into Gringotts,” Weasley said in a dull voice, not like the jubilant one Draco would’ve expected from this news.
“Get back inside, Aberforth,” one of the Death Eaters said warningly and the man, Aberforth, stepped towards them. Some of them took an involuntary step back.
Close-up, Longbottom looked far worse than Draco had originally realised. One of his eyes was swollen, mottled yellow and purple. His face had gouge marks on it, and his robes were worn and ripped in places. Draco would’ve placed money on Longbottom living in the Forest, given the state he was in.
“I had heard that the inhabitants of Malfoy Manor were confined to the house after the… ah…
“Likewise, Malfoy,” Hermione replied to his greeting, elbowing Harry sharply in the ribs, shaking him out of his reverie. He hissed and glared at her, but her gaze remained impassive and trained on Malfoy. “How have you been?” she asked, stepping closer. She was trying to engage Malfoy in conversation, and Harry was stunned to see that Malfoy was actually going for it, if the fact that he had leaned forward was anything to go by.
Everywhere around him were the detritus of students long gone. He passed a broken harpsichord and the remains of a hoop skirt wrapped around a moth-eaten mannequin. Shadows loomed in every corner and he flinched back when he turned sharply to find a mirror propped against a battered looking trunk. He stepped forward to study himself.
) turned in the arms of a redhead man who Draco realised with a start was the man riding the Thestral the night that Potter had escaped the Dark Lord once more.
“I need to tell you all what I saw,” Harry said after a moment of silence, and as they walked, he began to talk. Draco listened, rapt, as Harry explained what Snape’s memories had revealed to him in the Pensieve. How his mother, Lily, had been childhood friends with Snape. How, when Snape had discovered that Lily, her husband James and her newborn son Harry, had been targeted, he had gone to Dumbledore to plead for Lily’s life, and the deal had been struck.
The final week before the Fellowship announcement was very
The Hall was filled with a low hum of chatter. As Madam Pomfrey healed the injured, they rejoined their friends and family. In amongst the tears for the dead, there were smiles for the reunited living. Mothers, battered and bruised, held their arms open for their children. Conversely, Slughorn sat with a weeping girl next to what could only have been the body of her father, and Draco watched as Slughorn hugged the student, rocking her slowly. He watched Oliver Wood slowly and carefully straighten the body of Creevey, pulling his legs straight and then lightly crossing his arms over his chest. He looked down once, nodded, and left the hall.
? He certainly understood it now.
’ of Weasley trying the wireless. Hermione gave them a look as they entered and then ducked back behind her book, smiling to herself. Draco settled himself onto a bench by the dining table and picked up one of the books at random, flipping it open and trying to focus on it, but he couldn’t, not with Potter being right there, sat on the other armchair, giving Draco the occasional glance.
Draco, who had been attempting to read an old textbook, watched his mother’s face in the firelight, trying to build the courage to ask the right question.
“Oh yeah, I remember,” Potter said, having noticed his shudder. “You tortured Rowle, didn’t you?” he asked and Draco had the presence of mind to be a bit shocked by the bluntness of the question, but he nodded.
Heavy footsteps rounded the bar and then Aberforth stood at the end of it, looking at Draco, who felt very small in comparison. He had an unkempt look to him. His grey hair was past his shoulders and his beard was halfway down his chest, but behind the grimy spectacles that were perched low on his nose, Draco thought his eyes were familiar.
In the afternoons, he went to the library at Birrarung Marr. The University itself was hidden in the Yarra Ranges, and designed to be eco-friendly and blend with the rainforest surroundings. The Library was a modern mix of wood and glass, partially reclaimed by the vines growing up the side of the building, but Harry thought it had it’s charm, especially in comparison to the Hogwarts Library which smelled constantly of dust.
“All finished,” Hermione said quietly after a few minutes and Draco stepped back. Harry made an approving noise and Draco shot him a glare – he held up his hands in surrender.
“Oh pish-posh, Blaise, why go to Paris when you can find everything you need in dear Diagon Alley,” Pansy said on Draco’s other side. Her dark bob had obviously been freshly trimmed and her robes were cut fashionably short. She waved cheerfully at one of the shopkeepers, who went pale and darted inside the building. “Doesn’t quite have the same summer feel as it usually does, though,” she murmured quietly and her hand tightened around Draco’s arm.
“It is polite to knock, Draco,” Snape told him monotonously but Draco ignored him and took his seat again. “I just wanted to tell you Draco, that if you should ever find yourself in need, my door will always be open to you,” he said somewhat imperiously and Draco raised an eyebrow.
"That is correct, Lee. We still don't know who could have taken them, or why, but it is of the utmost importance that both boys are found safe and well. I must let the kidnapper know, if he or she is listening to this, that the full force of the Ministry is searching for the boys at this time, and we will find them. This is a promise," she said sternly.
"There they are! Rose!" Albus shouted, pointing in the distance to where Hermione, Ron and their children waited. They reached the Granger-Weasley family and greetings were exchanged, Rose hugging both boys as they chattered excitedly among themselves.
Hermione screamed from behind him and Draco turned to see a giant spider trying to climb through the hole the blast had left. Ron and Harry shouted spells at the same time and the spider flew backwards into the night. Harry ran after it, peeking out into the chaos beyond the walls of Hogwarts.
They stood in silence for a minute and then Potter blinked at him, a small smile creeping across his lips.
He had failed, and he was unlikely to be allowed to forget it any time soon.
“It’s a busy platform. Are you nervous about going to school?” she asked and Tatiana looked offended.
“She was right here,” he said and Harry stepped away from him, Draco’s arms dropping to his sides.
“What did they do?” Draco rasped, and Blaise gave him a sideways look.
“That’s good! It’s a strong start. See, you can do it after all,” he said as he took a few steps closer. “You’ll need to find a really happy memory, though. Do you have anything at all? Beating someone at Quidditch, the Yule Ball?” Potter asked and Draco thought hard.
“Malfoy's here,” he said, surprised by the breathlessness in his own voice, and Hermione frowned at him
Whatever rules there had been between good and evil magic were apparently forgotten tonight as all around them, Death Eaters and Protectors of Hogwarts alike used whatever means necessary to win. Somewhere, distantly, Draco could hear his name being screamed, but he ignored it. His parents could wait.
He would be summoned down for dinner soon. He couldn’t pretend to be ill tonight, it was too important. He would be expected to sit at the dinner table which had once been polished to a mirror-shine but now looked grimy and smudged, and make pleasant conversation and then, eventually, the Dark Lord would appear and he would have to spend the rest of his time at the table trying not to throw up out of sheer fear.
He might be able to help.
“Damn!” she hissed and then she shook her head. “Right. We’ll just have to–” She was cut off by a cry coming from a thicket of trees nearby. She and Draco whirled around to where the noise had come from. “Was that–?” she asked and Draco felt all the panic drain out of him.
It was another late afternoon sitting watching the clouds pass over the ornate fountain set in the lower grounds. His book for the day, a collection of old faerie-tales, had been put to one side in favour of pillowing his head in his arms on the window sill and staring outside. Downstairs, he could hear movement and talking, most likely from their “visitors”, but his doors were warded, so he had no fear of being disrupted, at least for now.
A year ago, after a bath, and a hot meal (and a healed leg for Scorpius), the boys had been able to talk about what had happened to them, after some coaxing from Ron. Lucius had charmed the barrier shut, much like it had been for Harry in his second year, and during the boys confusion, had confunded them both and led them away from the station, where he had Apparated them both to Malfoy Manor. Scorpius' broken leg had happened during this Side-Along Apparition, and the Aurors theorised that it was because Lucius took on more than he could handle, causing a splinch. He had kept them in the Manor proper for a few hours, but when neither boy would stop screaming, and their magic started making things explode (one of the Aurors had found the chandelier in the Dining Room on the floor in a shattered heap), he had moved them into the mirror.
“I’ve done it,” she finally said in a strangled voice and Draco looked up. In the centre of Potter’s chest was an angry, bloody mark in the shape of the locket. It looked like it had burned through several layers of skin and Granger reached for her bag again, Summoning a vial of dittany.
“These are the service tunnels for Hogwarts house-elves, Master Draco,” Dobby explained. “We is using them to get around the castle to clean, but also to fetch supplies. We can leave the castle this way,” he said and Draco followed him through the narrow space. It was well lit but cold and Draco realised they must be between the walls of the castle. He tried not to think about it too much for fear of developing claustrophobia.
“They used to go around telling people they were the heirs of Slytherin, or at least that’s what my Grandfather used to say,” he said with a rueful smile, which promptly dropped when Hermione gave him another look. He groaned and covered his face with a hand. “They were, weren’t they?” he asked her, though the question was rhetorical, and she gave him a pained look but nodded. “Merlin,” he breathed.
“We leave in half an hour. I am told by my most trusted advisor,” and here Voldemort swept an arm to gesture at Snape, who inclined his head, as if humbled by the praise. “That Dumbledore’s pathetic Order of the Phoenix plan to remove Harry Potter from a safe location soon after sunset. To hide under a cloak of darkness,” he sneered, his tone mocking, and the table laughed. They were well trained. “We will fight them in the air. In the night. And then dawn will rise on a new age!” Voldemort finished his speech and there was applause and cheers once again. The snake bobbed its head and Aunt Bellatrix looked positively giddy.
Ever since Draco had woken up from the dream last night, curiosity had been gnawing at him, and he took the opportunity of silence to ask. “Mother, do you know – well, do you know if it is possible to enter someone else's dream? When you yourself are dreaming?” he asked her and she raised an eyebrow, frowning slightly.
“Yes. Mr Potter, in your answer to question 26, Debunk a Modern Myth, you stated that Persephone…”
There was more information about the Viva below, but Harry’s eyes skimmed over it. His heart was pounding in his chest and he felt a little light-headed, like he had just performed some sort of Quidditch trick and was regaining his equilibrium.
The elf lay still and Draco fell to his knees a few feet away, feeling like the air had been stolen directly from his lungs. Potter was still speaking, still calling the elf's name, even as Draco saw figures appearing out of the darkness, from a cottage he hadn’t seen before. One of them paused by a pair of people huddled in the sand, Weasley and Hermione, and helped them get up, while the other continued towards them, jogging.
“Here you go,” she said, passing Potter his mug and then Draco his. She sat down on the log with her back to the tent and settled the book on her lap, flipping to a few chapters in. Draco tilted his head to try and read the cover. His eyebrows shot up as he got sight of it – ‘
“What’d you think you’re playing at, woman?” he asked and Bellatrix didn’t even respond, she just hit him and his cohorts with Stunning Spells until they were all crumpled to the ground, except Greyback, who had been forced into a kneel under Bellatrix’s wrathful gaze.
“But look at him carefully, look! Come closer!” Father reached behind him and managed to grab one of Draco’s arms, hauling him forward painfully by the wrist. He moved slightly, a shaft of light appearing over Potter’s swollen and mottled face, his glasses askew over his nose, only the faintest hint of those green eyes appearing through the swollen lids. “Draco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will be forgiv–” Father was saying excitedly and Draco pointedly kept his gaze averted.
“No,” Seamus Finnigan replied in his lilt. Harry gave him a studying look, like he had struggled to recognise him as well. Draco turned away and didn’t listen as Finnigan spoke, studying the room and it’s occupants more.
“Yeah. We need to look at his wand though. I don’t know how far we’ll get if he doesn’t have one,” she added, chewing on her bottom link anxiously. Draco cleared his throat and tapped his fingers against the mug, the sound absorbed by the snow in front of him. “Do you want a book or something?” Hermione asked and Draco twisted to pick up ‘
From behind them, Weasley cleared his throat.
. I felt… tortured by this idea that someday, maybe my love would be bad for them. And I didn't want to live like that, and I didn't want them to live like that," he explained and Harry let out a shuddering breath.
“We can probably stay here another day, but we should move on the day after. And I need to go get some supplies,” she said, frowning over at the tent. “I don’t think we have much by way of lunch, I’m afraid,” she added apologetically to Draco who startled and shut the book. He set it carefully on the log next to him and shucked his blanket, going back to his tent and dragging out his backpack. He retook his seat and Granger and Potter watched with fascination as he dug through it, pulling out the brown paper bag which Mibby had given him all those weeks ago. He opened it and laughed, before proferring it to Granger. Inside were three carefully wrapped sandwiches.
“Who are you?” she asked primly and Greyback growled.
It had seemed so simple then, to have children. After all the work they'd put in, the spells and the potions, after all that, it seemed so easy. They're born and you raise them, and hope that they don't stumble into a War, like their parents had. It had never even occurred to Harry that maybe the boys would be kidnapped. It never occurred to him that a parent might - possibly, terrifyingly - outlive their child.
Bellatrix found him in the crowd, and her smile tightened at the edges, turned into a rictus while Mrs Weasley still pummelled her with curses.
“What is this? What’s happened, Cissy?” she asked and his mother reached for him again.
Voldemort, stuck in the sea of fleeing wizards, was backing into the Great Hall, cursing and shouting instructions to his followers, but none of them seemed to hear him and if they did, they ignored him. Death Eaters fought students and teachers alike in every corner, and Draco caught a glimpse of Ernie Macmillan jinxing Dolohov as he and Neville were finally pushed into the Great Hall.
“I trust Hermione, she’s usually right about this sort of thing. We should go,” he said again. “Lovegood’s on your side as well, Harry, the
have noticed we broke into Gringotts,”
Chaos. Absolute chaos.
“Of course I’m sure. I heard that Granger girl say it herself. ‘Dalby Forest’. Somewhere in the North Yorkshire Moors. She seemed rather upset, I think the Weasley boy has left them,” the unknown person replied and Snape made a frustrated noise.
From around them, the train's whistle sounded, and everyone started to scramble to get on the train.
“It means… memory. That they live on in the memory of those who still live to remember them. They’ll only
"Right, everybody out!" Harry announced, and Draco pulled open the front door, stepping out into the early Autumn sunlight. They made their way across to the park opposite the house and stood in a well-shaded area. Harry took Scorpius' hand while Draco took Albus' and together, they Disapparated.
“It is you! If they find out who they’ve got – ! They’re Snatchers, they’re only looking for truants to sell for gold–” Dean began to explain but he was cut off when Greyback approached them again.
“So why’d you do it then? Why'd you get into books and that?
"Ginny works for the Daily Prophet. Neville's a teacher, Ron works in a joke shop, Luna - sorry, Luna, I don't have the faintest idea what it is you do, but you're definitely not an Auror," he said, turning to Luna slightly to apologise. She gave him a sincere smile, and squeezed his arm where it was entangled with hers. "Why are you all allowed to help?" he asked, and Neville gave him a grim smile.
“I don’t quite understand what you mean, darling,” she said, setting down her teacup and spearing a slice of fruit on her fork but not taking a bite. Her plate looked barely touched.
Draco felt his knees give way. Hermione hurried to hold him up, as did Ron, but thankfully Voldemort hadn’t noticed the movement, too focused on Harry. Draco’s ears rang and his vision swam. He had been the master of the Elder Wand? All that time, trapped in the Manor, he had been the master of the most powerful wand to ever exist? During his weakest moment?
If Granger was choosing their hiding locations (and Potter would do well to let her), she was likely choosing locations that would be passed off by Dark Wizards as insignificant Muggle locations, but would probably have deeper meaning. Shoving the remains of his turkey and cheese sandwich into his mouth, Draco hefted the backpack back onto his shoulders and fished his wand out of the front of his jumper, where he had shoved it for safekeeping. He balanced it on the palm of his hand and choked out ‘
“I don’t know,” he said and she opened her mouth to argue. He held up a hand to stop her and her mouth snapped shut. “It’s not that I don’t believe you. It’s just… we don’t need another Godric's Hollow,” he said quietly and Hermione gave him a pained look. She carried a lot of guilt for his broken wand. Potter shrugged. “We keep looking for these secret clues we think Dumbledore left us, and we’re convincing ourselves that we’re finding them. It just doesn’t work like that–”
With a growl of frustration, Draco dropped into a crouch and began pulling out his supplies for the night from his backpack. “Fine!” he shouted to no one. “If I get hypothermia and die, I’m haunting you!” The tent poles caught on the lip of the bag and it took a few furious tugs to get them loose, sending Draco back onto his bum on the cold ground. He swore loudly and behind him he heard a ‘
There was a bang two aisles over and Hermione let out a bit of a shriek, covering her head with one hand as the stacks of objects on either side of them wobbled threateningly. Draco’s heart skipped a beat but he kept moving, kept pumping his legs.
Gathering together the team who were going to Malfoy Manor, they took the lifts down to the atrium and headed towards the Apparition point, the Aurors marching in time while Harry, Malfoy, Ron and Hermione strode alongside them. One of the most experienced Aurors, Begbie, a strapping man with grizzled features and hair more salt than pepper, was leading the team, and he ushered them all into a formation at the apparition point.
“Ron, catch – and GO!” he yelled, throwing one of the wands to Weasley, who snatched it from the air as Dobby leapt forward. Potter seized Draco’s arm, and Draco held tight to the goblin and the sword as Dobby wrapped a bony-fingered hand around his other upper arm and began to drag him through time and space.
The house-elves were diving back into their serving hallways just as Mother entered the dining room to take stock. The company may not be deserving of it, but every night she had the table set formally, with crystal wine goblets that had been smashed more than once, either by accident or intent.
A second, louder bang, went off and there was a small noise of pain. Draco craned his neck to look and his eyebrows shot up – Neville Longbottom was sprawled in the No-Man's-Land between the two sides, his wand landing just beside Harry. With horror, Draco watched as the Dark Lord turned his attention to Neville, who was pushing himself up to his knees.
“SILENCE!” the Dark Lord shouted across the gap between the two sides as the wails and cries crescendoed. He whipped his wand around and there was a loud ‘
“You’re an idiot,” he said with forced cheerfulness. “But at least you’re an idiot with principles. Come on, I want to see what all this fuss is about.”
"Dumbledore would know," Harry muttered to himself and Malfoy looked up at him sharply. Harry shrugged one shoulder. "He would - I don't know, he would say something cryptic and then all the pieces would fall into place and then we'd know, wouldn't we, we'd know where the boys are," he said and Malfoy raised a pale eyebrow at him.
," he said desperately and Hermione gasped. Ron came from the doorway and stood at Harry's other side, studying the frame too. "Oh Merlin - have I lost them all?" Harry asked desperately, quietly, to himself, and Hermione gripped his elbow tightly.
“You make it sound so simple,” Ron said, pressing the heels of his palms into his eyes. Draco’s heart broke for him – he could see from Ron’s expression that he was beyond devastated, that his grief had hollowed him out in a second.
“Where’s Harry?” he asked and Draco choked.
“Dobby’s dead,” he managed to say before he sank down into an armchair, feeling hollowed out and broken. Ron clenched his jaw and nodded. Draco cleared his throat and wiped a hand angrily across his face, smudging the tears there. “Has she woken up?” he asked and Ron shook his head.
“I thoroughly checked the company before I agreed, but it is handy. And we always get her a little something for Christmas and her birthday, which she seems to appreciate,” Hermione said, and then Mipsy came back into the kitchen and they stopped talking about her. She plated them both two Full English Breakfasts and Harry tucked into his with gusto. “Did you sleep well?” Hermione asked, neatly cutting some mushrooms in two. Harry swallowed his mouthful to answer.
“That makes sense,” he said and then he asked the question he had wanted answers to, ever since Potter landed on the forest floor, “What were – what were you dreaming of?” he asked and Potter frowned at him, shuffling down in the bed a little, tugging the blankets up and hissing when the fibres brushed the new mark on his chest. Draco let him settle, not wanting to interrupt his thoughts.
“Good. I think Harry needs more love in his life. Now if only he could get his head straight – or not straight, as it were–” she said with an awkward look at Draco, who scoffed. “And admit he feels the same for you,” and Draco’s heart pounded in his chest.
"Shut it, Thompson, or I'll do it for you," Ron snarled, whipping out his wand and pointing it at Thompson. They had never gotten along, even during their training days, and when Ron had left to join George at the joke shop, Thompson had seen it as a personal victory. Even so, Thompson looked suitably cowed.
Thompson, to his credit, had managed to pull together a Strike Team of the Ministry's best Aurors, including some of the Aurors that Harry knew from his field days. He had, however, tried to discourage them from following the Auror team to Malfoy Manor, but Harry had pulled his wand out and pointed it directly in his face. The other man hadn't said another word, only to say that Ginny and Luna were definitely not permitted to follow them, to which the two had grudgingly agreed.
"The boys are both warded against it. It was… a security risk," he explained and the words tasted bitter in his mouth. Yes, he had warded the boys against Location Charms. It was thought that, when they were younger, if someone had wanted to find them, it would've been a security risk to have them unprotected like that. And so Harry had warded them both, given them matching bracelets, explained them away as gifts, and then made sure that neither of those bracelets would ever come off.
“I know, mate,” said Ron dumbly, without a hint of regret. “So it’s now or never, isn’t it?” he added with a grin and Draco pinched the bridge of his nose.
“You know what, little girly? This picture looks a hell of a lot like you,” Greyback said and Hermione squeaked.
“Fine, we’ll go. But Draco–” he said and Draco looked over at him, an eyebrow raised. “You have to stay with the tent. If Lovegood’s an avid supporter, he’ll probably curse you on sight,” he pointed out and Draco thought about protesting but he conceded the point.
“-And Ron stabbed it with the sword!” he said and Hermione gaped at him for a second before turning back to Weasley.
“I don’t know,” he told his father firmly, and he stepped away again.
“Let us know how you get on?” Harry asked lightly and Malfoy gave him a surprised look, but nodded.
“Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?” the same voice sneered into the darkness and then became muffled as though its owner turned away. “Spread out. He’s here.”
“Dobby gave it to me as I left the castle, I guess it’s been enchanted to bring food from the Hogwarts kitchens,” he said and Potter choked on a bite of his sandwich.
“It is,” he replied and she sniffed, shifting from one foot to the other. Draco eyed her carefully.
“NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!” Draco heard from behind him and then Molly Weasley stormed forward, wand drawn, eyes ablaze. Draco followed her. “OUT OF MY WAY!” Molly shouted at the girls, and they fell back as Bellatrix laughed with delight.
“That’s
But Hermione was right.
Whoever this woman was, she wasn't a Muggle. For one thing she was looking up at the Potter’s ruined cottage with her mouth agape, clearly able to see it. Her eyes flickered back to them, still hidden under the cloak and Draco realised with a start that she knew they were there. He gave Granger a wide-eyed look which she returned, but only Granger spoke.
“Then what do we do? If you want the sword, Griphook, then you’ll have to help us more than – wait!” Harry snapped, turning to face the goblin who lingered by the vault door, his arms crossed over his chest, a sour look on his face. Harry blinked and it was like a light had flickered on in his brain. “Can I touch stuff with the sword? Hermione, give it here!” Harry said, gesturing to Hermione and opening his hand as though waiting to catch something.
It felt like a fever was building inside him and he nearly became delirious from the pain, tempted to go home, tempted to crawl back to Hogwarts and beg forgiveness. But the memories of Dumbledore saying “I can help you,” and Potter saying “Maybe you can keep secrets too,” made him stay and lie there and scream until he finally, blissfully, slipped into unconsciousness.
They exited the Ministry via the telephone box, the wand-wizard giving Harry a mournful look from behind his desk on his way out, and once they were on street-level, Harry turned to Malfoy.
“Come on, let’s go back to sleep. I always sleep better if you’re there,” he told Draco, offering his hand. Draco took it and stood, waving his wand as they left the kitchen to dim the lights. They picked their way across the sitting room back to their sleeping bags. As Potter settled he turned on his side to face Draco and reached out a hand under the coffee table – Draco took it. The angle was a bit awkward and Draco knew he’d wake with a numb arm, but he fell asleep holding Potter’s hand and didn’t wake for the rest of the night.
“I love them. I love them so much. But their cause is getting people killed. And I can’t love who they’ve become. What kind of parent does this to their child?” he asked Potter, who was an indistinct shape through the tears. Potter straightened, still half-crouched, and wrapped his arms around Draco, pulling him close so that Draco could cry on his shoulder.
“Well, what’s one more?” Draco murmured and the dream faded around him, Potter walking away.
He scooted around, still sprawled on the floor, and Granger was there, her arms crossed over her chest, her wand balanced delicately between her fingers. She eyed him with something similar to curiosity tinged with pity.
“Draco, come on!” Hermione called and he turned to see that the doorway had opened. He followed them in, turning at the last second to see Ginny Weasley’s hair whip around a corner and disappear. He tried to shout after her, but she was gone, and in the split second he had hesitated, the trio had disappeared into the Room of Requirement.
Malfoy plucked at the t-shirt on the top of the pile and smile. "I got you this," he said quietly and Harry looked at the t-shirt itself. It was old, but comfortable, and had the logo of a Muggle theme-park emblazoned across it, and he remembered - Malfoy had begrudgingly bought it for him after a day out when Harry's t-shirt had gotten wet after riding on a log flume.
“Merlin!” Draco gasped and Granger groaned again. She reached for her wand again and lifted another – Potter’s. Snapped clean in two, the end of a red feather poking through the centre. She sobbed again and held the wand like it was Potter himself, lying broken on the forest floor. “This is no time to mourn a wand!” Draco snapped and she turned her tearful eyes to him. “You need to cut it off. It’s going to hurt him. Do you want me to do it?” he asked her, as calmly as he could manage as Potter moaned beneath them.
“D-Draco?” she called into the dark and Draco forced himself to speak.
“Yes, just the snake,” Hermione said in a small voice. “But – Draco -” she began and he held up a hand to stop her.
“The unbeatable wand, Harry!” Ron exclaimed and Potter lifted his head weakly, his eyes rolling as he spoke once more.
“Oh, about an hour or two ago. I wanted to make sure I knew where we were going, and read a little to take my mind off things,” she said and Harry raised an eyebrow.
He was about to shout and lash out when he caught sight of Ron next to him. He glanced around and realised that he had been pulled under the invisibility cloak, Hermione and Harry sandwiched under it as well.
him, and now his house has blown up!”
“Not as yet. He should be here on the hour, according to Bellatrix,” Mother said and Snape made a noise of acknowledgement. The carriage clock on the stone fireplace showed that they had mere minutes before the Dark Lord came.
Neither twin could tell the adults what his actual plan had been, but Draco had hazarded a guess. "He wanted heirs. I denounced the Malfoy name years ago, removing myself as heir, so it dies with me. He probably thought he might be able to convince at least one of the boys to come around to his way of thinking," he said through clenched teeth when they were at St. Mungos, where the boys were being monitored. Harry gripped his hand next to him, and smiled slightly.
“Track the movement of the wand for me Mr Malfoy, there’s a lad,” she said and she began to move the wand from side-to-side, up-and-down, in figure of eights and even runes. The light burned on the back of Draco’s corneas and every time he blinked, he saw flashes of the runes behind his eyelids. Eihwaz. Dagaz. Raidho.
“You’re Aberforth,” Harry said to the barman’s back, and he didn’t respond, turning instead to light the fire, which instantly filled the room with light and warmth. Draco, exhausted now, could have almost fallen asleep in the armchair.
“Potter?” Bellatrix practically shrieked, which made Draco turn his head away. He watched the flames flicker in the fireplace as she spoke. “Are you sure? Well, then, the Dark Lord must be informed at once!” There was the rustling of fabric as Draco imagined her drawing back her sleeve to expose her Dark Mark, but Father interrupted.
His gaze lingered over one. ’
Potter’s hand was heavy on his waist and the other was warm against his back. They were pressed closer, probably closer than strictly necessary, but Draco couldn’t bring himself to step away. He resisted the urge to thread his fingers through Potter’s curls, and had to look away when Potter turned his gaze to him, his green eyes catching the lamplight and flaring gold for a second, boring into Draco’s soul. He could feel Potter’s heartbeat ticking in his throat and Draco felt his pulse quicken for just a moment.
“Weren’t you found with this rabble? How do you not know?” he asked and Draco was about to reply when the drawing room door opened once more and he froze. His Aunt, her hair unkempt, strolled in, her head held high.
Harry smiled the whole way home.
"Oh Harry, I'm so sorry. Whatever we can do, we'll do it. Location Charm? Have you tried it?" she asked and Harry shook his head.
“Didn’t you ever read Hogwarts; A History?” he asked and when he turned back around, Granger was beaming at him. He gave her a baffled look. “What?”
“He works at the Ministry. Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes,” he lied smoothly and Draco thought for a second that Potter would’ve done very well in Slytherin.
"Oh Merlin, Albus," he said, pressing his face into his son's mop of hair. He released him after a second, holding his son slightly away from him, studying his features. Albus had a cut lip and some crusted blood under his nose, but aside from general grime on his skin, he looked to be in one piece, though very tearful. He looked up at Harry again and started crying, telling Harry something unintelligible, and Harry brought him in for another hug.
“You might as well get your tent pitched,” she said and he nodded, picking up his backpack and setting it up opposite where Potter was beginning to work on their tent. He unpacked the tent and laid it out, threading the poles through. As he was about to wrestle the poles into their marks in the bottom fabric, Potter came to help him.
"How would you know? You don't even know them," he said under his breath and Malfoy glared at him.
Snow thawed, melted and by late March, Hackfall Woods, their latest home, was carpeted in bluebells. Hermione, charmed, spent the afternoon sat by the edge of the wards next to the bluebells, taking deep breaths and smiling to herself. Weasley, unnoticed, watched her with a small affectionate smile.
“Regulus? No, why,” Draco said, stepping a bit further into the room. He had opened his eyes standing on the threshold of the doorway, and Potter had already been upright, as if waiting for him.
“I don’t know. I just fancy some music,” he told her with a shrug and she gave him an indulgent smile. Draco went and pulled free a jumper that was draped over the end of the bunk and started when something swung out from underneath it. “Oh, be careful,” Potter called from the other side of the tent, and Draco used a finger to stop the swinging item. It was a locket, heavy gold with emeralds studded on the front in the shape of an S. Draco frowned at it and went to use a finger to trace the S before Granger snapped at him.
“Look, I’m going to go to the Slytherin common room,” he said finally and Hermione frowned at him. “
“No, Draco,” Dumbledore said, his voice soft and sad and kind. “It is my mercy, and not yours, that matters now,”
He found a quiet stretch of corridor in the basements and sat down heavily on the stone floor next to a portrait of a bowl of fruit. He tilted his head back and pressed it to the wall, letting the cold stone soothe the building headache. When he next opened his eyes, he nearly jumped about a foot in the air.
“Something wrong, lad?” Slughorn asked and Draco jerked his gaze over to his teacher. He hadn’t much liked Slughorn when he started last year, taking over from Snape, but Draco had to respect that the teacher knew what he was talking about. He was knowledgeable on a wide-array of potions and, pathetically, Draco rather enjoyed his softer form of teaching. Or maybe it was just some small way to spite Snape.
“I know! Cool, eh?”
“Draco! Are you quite well?” Blaise was kneeling next to him and Draco gasped awake, lying on the cold slate of the Slytherin common room. The two hours of sleep from the night before had finally caught up with him, and he had fallen asleep in the free period after lunch. The room was mostly empty around them, a few fourth-years on another free period looking over curiously, but they snapped their attention away as Blaise turned to look at them, his eyes narrowed, slitted like a snake’s. “Up you get, Draco. Let’s take you to the hospital wing. You must’ve inhaled something odd during our Potions lesson,” Blaise said, offering an excuse for the moment of weakness, and Draco nodded along. Blaise gripped his hand and pulled him to his feet.

s’, which surprised him – it didn’t seem like the type of book Granger would have lying about. He picked it up, figuring that Granger wouldn’t mind, and took it outside to read on a log next to the fire, the blanket wrapped tightly around him.
“You’re looking rather pale, Draco,” Blaise said conversationally and Draco shot him a stern look. “Not looking forward to the return to school?” he asked and Pansy sniffed.
It was a passage about the splitting of a soul. The language was a dense form of Middle English with Runes interspersed so it took him a few minutes to read it as Potter watched them with curiosity.
“Anything?” he asked, and Potter shook his head, setting his bowl in his lap. In front of his crossed legs, the blue flames sputtered but continued to burn, casting the snow around them in a ghostly blue light.
On the third floor, Harry pointed at one of the closed doors. "Guest room is in there, now. There's an ensuite - I'll grab some pyjamas and a toothbrush and bring them down," he said, and Malfoy nodded, heading over to the room to investigate while Harry took the remaining flight up to his Master suite.
!” Draco said, tapping his wand to Weasley’s side lightly. His ribs made a weird jerking movement, but the bruising faded a little and Draco took a step back.
Like that child on Christmas all those years ago, Harry went to stand in front of the mirror, and stared at its reflective surface.
Draco could not get his head around it. The thought popped up into his mind but didn’t seem to stick. How could Snape be dead?
“Come on, up you get. I won’t let go, I promise,” he said quietly and Draco believed him. Still half-blinded by tears, he allowed Potter to help him get out of the sleeping bag and then guide him, barefoot, across the clearing to the big tent. It was warm inside and Potter ushered Draco to sit on the edge of one of the beds in the sleeping section. “Lie down, okay?” he said and Draco let himself slide sideways to lie down. The bed was a lot comfier than the ground sheet and sleeping bag had been, and he sank into the mattress. Potter shuffled a little bit to sit next to him, still holding onto his wrist. “Go to sleep. I’m right here. I’m not letting go,” he murmured as Draco shut his eyes and drifted away.
“What’s the map of?” Draco eventually asked and Potter glanced over at him. He held it up for Draco to see it better and Draco scanned the topography there, his eyebrows raising. “Is it a map of Hogwarts?” he said, looking for confirmation, and Potter nodded.
Shadows moved behind him and he froze – they weren’t shadows.
“But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!” Voldemorts voice shook slightly with ecstasy. “I stole the wand from its last master’s tomb! I removed it against its last master’s wishes! Its power is mine!”
on the unconscious Snatchers and leading them away.
“Don’t touch it!” he yelled and Draco closed his eyes. They were as good as done now.
Granger found them still sitting out there when she woke up a few hours later. Draco was finishing his chapter on the Court Magicians of the Tudor Dynasty when she slipped out of the tent, her hair pulled back into a messy bun, a cup of tea in her hands. She gave Potter a smile, Draco a nod of acknowledgement and sat down on the other leg.
“He got himself killed, that’s what he did! And his parents didn’t set him up for failure, didn’t make their son pay for his
“Look,” he said, tapping the page, and Harry looked down to read it. It was a family tree, and with a glance at the header it was the Lestrange family tree. Next to each name was a small scribble in pencil - PB, HB or MB. He glanced at Draco, confused. “I went through every family tree in this book and put next to each member whether they were Pureblood, Half-Blood or Muggleborn. And look,” he said, tapping about a quarter of the way up the page, where Rudolphus Lestrange’s great-great-grandmother was written. “She was a half-blood. And here,” he flipped along a few pages, to the Nott family, and tapped a name two rows about Theodore Nott “Nott’s maternal Grandfather was a Muggleborn. Every single one of these families has a Muggleborn in the last generation or so. Even the Malfoys,” again, he reached forward and flicked back a page. He tapped where his Paternal Great-Aunt was written. “See? Lavinia Malfoy née Swire. Yes, she’s not a direct ancestor, but-,”
