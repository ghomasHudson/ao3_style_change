"No. You're not going to get a broom for Teddy." He proclaimed anyway, confident of what Potter might have said regardless.
Harry looked away quickly to give him space. “We can learn to be whatever we were again,” he suggested.
Harry wondered if he could give himself a consolatory wank afterwards. Even though he wasn’t in the mood to pull one off, it would probably make him feel better and stop him from wetting his pillow with tears instead.
“Of course. What else would it be?” Harry replied questioningly, brows raising when he noticed the falter in Malfoy’s steps. He knew that past-Harry and Malfoy were supposedly friends, but Malfoy had been treating him so poorly since his incident that they were now merely colleagues in his book. Still, being colleagues was already a huge step up from their original dynamic as schoolboy rivals. Besides, anything more required cooperation on Malfoy’s part. “Look, Malfoy—”
Harry rubbed the salve into his left leg as Narcissa huffed in amusement at the protagonist on screen. Harry bit the insides of his lips as he worked at the knot up his left calf. After injuries from chases during his Auror days, his Achilles tendon had never been quite the same. Following the recent explosion, the Healers had insisted on "natural healing" to force his sinews to stitch themselves back slowly. Mostly unassisted apart from diluted potions, it was a treatment
Potter merely pulled a long face, but Granger quickly agreed, "yeah, it's a bit much. Harry has the brunt of it though.” She looked at her friend in concern.
“I’m sorry,” Draco whispered as he combed his hand through Harry’s hair. Harry made a broken noise in lieu of a reply.
“It’s not so bad, huh,” Harry greeted when Draco finally returned to the seat beside him. The other Slytherins had dispersed, and Pansy was seated between Susan Bones and Lisa Turpin, their heads bent together in gossip.
Draco's eyes were pinned on Harry's back as he left the office. It was hard to send his friends off to danger. Shaking his head to clear his thoughts, Draco traced the logo of the shop printed on the takeaway cup forlornly. He sighed to himself. His other audits had never been as worrying.
Draco bit his lower lip as he turned the fire down to a simmer. "Can we go somewhere else instead? We still haven't been to the Chinese restaurant that Andromeda recommended."
Pansy laughed hollowly, shaking her head in pity, her smile thin. "Don't come crawling for me when it's too late," Pansy said before swirling her Slytherin green cloak around her as she left.
Draco pressed his fingernails into his palms desperately as Potter nodded vigorously with a wide and silly smile. The reception of positive acknowledgement from Potter stirred up intense and confusing emotions that overwhelmed him and made his heart stumble.
“So that’s how resonance feels like,” Draco said shyly when Harry pulled him onto his lap and held him close.
"Potter," Draco called out before tossing a box in his direction. He was tired of watching Potter mope. His fan club had also taken notice of The Saviour's gloom, and had began organising once more. It was time for an intervention.
Draco spelled himself clean as he popped off the half hard cock with a wet kiss. He smirked at the languorous smile on Harry's face.
discount, and it tells me to use it wisely.” Harry swore to kiss his gift partner tomorrow. They had unwittingly saved him from crying all over Draco.
"It's okay. I just woke up anyway, we'll open it together tonight," Malfoy said in amusement, obviously taking pleasure in Harry's anxiety. "Thanks for sending it along though. I appreciate it."
"Right. Sorry," Harry ducked his head guiltily. "Figured that you guys would want to know what happened as soon as possible." He felt distinctly wrong footed as they only continued to look at him. Grasping for straws, he turned to Malfoy.
How far would he have to go? Would he have to shoot himself with a lead arrow to be free? He could no longer distinguish which thoughts were his own, craving for Harry’s attention and preening whenever he felt Harry’s eyes on him.
"What is it?" Harry repeated as he rounded the bed to stand beside Malfoy. He burst into laughter when he laid eyes on the gift. "It's adorable!" He giggled as he poked at the gingerbread cookies in the box.
"Hermione told me that someone paid two hundred thousand galleons for the extra-extra-extra-extra-extra-large version."
Draco tried to reign in the smile threatening to spread across his lips. He deeply enjoyed the nights spent together, when all of their friends were gone and he had all of Harry’s attention to himself. Whenever Harry sat with him in the quiet of their common room, it made him feel
Upset, Draco pressed his cousin close for support as the other man suddenly stormed off. "He's usually a lot more pleasant," Draco apologised to Potter before reaching for Teddy's hand. "Shall we get some dittany for that scar, Teddy?" Draco asked as he led his cousin in search of a Healer's tray, motioning for Potter to follow.
Parkinson rolled her eyes as she blew at her fingernails. "What did your Father say the last time he saw you?"
He knew that Greg was also friends with Malfoy and that he shouldn’t say too much, but the way Greg always seemed distracted while they were talking made Harry overshare, and the perpetual expression of confusion on Greg's face made Harry tack on even more details. “So I mean, if it was one cake for each year of obsession during Hogwarts, it would be seven cakes.”
Harry emptied his lungs with the deepest sigh he could manage, jumping at the stinging hex on the back of his hand. He frowned at the nonchalantly raised brow.
Draco sighed at his parchment in despair. He was now officially obsessing over having a warm wet hole to fuck. Pansy really brought out the worst in him.
"Please confine your foreplay to your bed, Draco," the sandy haired Ravenclaw advised before leaving with a wink at Harry, uninterested in any clarification. Draco groaned as the boy's strides quickly broke into a run. Tomorrow's prefects meeting would be an absolute nightmare.
Oh, he had really done it now—he had proved to Draco that his work would come first even though he had tried so hard to be on his best behaviour. Harry pressed a hand to his temple in frustration. Pulling off his robe, he headed up the stairs to see Draco. Even though he had no excuses, there was no point in delaying the inevitable.
Squaring his shoulders, he collected himself, laughing slightly when he noticed that Harry was halfway back to his seat, as if trying to give him space. “I’ll make some notes, then we can leave. I’m starting to think that this might be a fool’s endeavour.” He shook his head wryly.
Conjuring cushions for his back, Draco floated his book and pulled out the flask of tea that Worry had prepared for him. Removing his shoes, he sighed contentedly as he folded his legs. Tracing his last position on the page of text, the cabin door suddenly opened and he bolted upright, wand at the ready.
Draco shifted in his seat, discomforted by the progress of Potter's rant. He had anticipated an over the top apology from Potter, but he had clearly underestimated the influence of Potter's Hufflepuff earnestness. Nonetheless, with the grand gesture done, the reconciliation completed, Potter's inane apology suffered through, it was now time for the resumption of normal relations.
"I didn't look. Figured you'd want to see it first," Ron shrugged as he traced a line down his neck. "Was bleeding quite a bit though. Got onto your pyjamas and all."
"No, you’re not. But how did you know?" The detailed questionnaire he filled beforehand had nothing about how he took his tea. He felt his face flush when he remembered about the headline discussing his scandalous tea preference during Seamus and Dean's wedding. "I had hoped that the Prophet wouldn't deliver here," he sighed.
"Those bloody letters," Ron said vehemently. The Gryffindors at the table nodded their heads in commiseration.
When Potter mimed chattering at him while making a face at Finch-Fletchley's back, Draco suddenly realised how terrible the entire date would look to Potter. Firstly, Finch-Fletchley was dark haired, completely unsuited to Draco's intentions of throwing Potter's scent off. Secondly, he was on a date with Finch-Fletchley, who was undoubtedly an insufferable twit.
Even though he was scarcely able to comprehend the history of Chinese tea making and drinking then, his mother’s solemn and exact gestures were enough to make him sit down instead of running off to play. He would pepper her with endless questions, then commentary, and finally, when he was older, the grave contemplation that the ritual deserved. He had always thought of it as his first introduction to Potions making, an exact art focused on the intent, and heart of the brewer.
Ron looked between Luna and Pansy before making a noise of realization. "Don't make a habit out of it," he warned Harry, who only shrugged. Harry had been taken by the party kit and had immediately mailed his purchase to George for consideration. Draco had only refused to agree with its creativity due to the childish jokes in it. Any party would be ruined if guests could only squeak or hiccup randomly.
"That's an unfortunate stereotype," Draco tutted. If only Hermione had been around to lecture Potter, Draco thought idly as he picked his quill up, remembering what he had wanted to write. "Perhaps you could ask Weasley, the real Slytherin among all of us." Honestly, had Blaise not finally gotten together with Pansy, he would have been fucking him instead of writing letters to Pansy. In fact, Draco’s celibacy was hardly by choice, was it? Terry Boot had also settled down with that dull as a flobberworm Lisa Turpin, which was such a shame in his opinion. Turpin wasn't even smart enough to be a Ravenclaw to begin with, and how could one be contented with missionary sex after a foray into BDSM?
Ron shrugged when he looked at him questioningly, “I only get sane letters, nothing of the proposals or underwear sort. I guess that I have Hermione, you know. They know better than to trifle with her. And I’m an Auror.”
I am going on a date tomorrow and I have been planning very hard for it. I am very excited! I am going to hit them with surprise so hard that they'll fall over.
“Oh finally,” Ron exclaimed excitedly, withdrawing the hand he had around Hermione when the food appeared.
Frowning as he examined the layers of the wards, he wondered about the owner's seeming paranoia and the haphazardness of the newer additions. Unlike the original foundations, it was brusque and inelegant. If he shifted the ward just so to—"welcome, Mr. Potter."
Regardless of his thoughts, Draco felt his lips rise, in mirror of the smirks on his friends' faces.
favourite shop—which explained Malfoy’s unplanned presence in Horizontal Alley. But the sudden combination of the apron, and their apparent familiarity was too much for him. Why didn’t his past self think about this and follow Serendipity on
"You better take emotional responsibility for Harry's misery! He's talking about how maybe you guys weren't even friends, and that he shouldn't be clinging on to something that wasn't even there! I swear to Salazar that I will quarter you if you don't do something!" Weasley bit out, his eyes wild with fury. Draco tried desperately to not flinch at the F word, but failed miserably as usual.
"And the lucky person is–" Seamus paused heavily for excitement while Ernie MacMillan and Neville made drum roll noises on their thighs.
Malfoy’s shoulders loosened, the wariness in his eyes giving way to amusement as he leaned forward. “That’s what you said last year too,” he said, his smile lopsided as he looked at Harry closely.
"Alright," Draco said, thinking about the first Muggle movie he had glimpsed in an electronics shop. The entire wall of televisions had been playing the same movie, and Draco had been awed by the very long coloured Wizarding picture until a Muggle salesperson had come to bother him. Muggles were incredible, Draco thought idly, his eyelids drooping, his limbs heavy at the verge of sleep.
"I'll allow it," Lisa said with a shrug. "It's already pretty late and this can be our last round. It's an ode to why we're all here anyway," she said, waving away the applause with an eye roll.
Harry broke out of his stupor, huffing in laughter as he combed his fringe backwards. "Thanks," he said, "for not transferring me while I was asleep. I'm grateful." It was belated, but when he had woken up again years ago aching and uncomfortable in the central hospital in Paris, only the fear of distracting Malfoy had stopped him from sending a singing garland.
"Are you all returning to Hogwarts?" Greg suddenly asked, as Weasley began ushering them to continue walking. The geniality of the entire interaction was not lost on Draco. It was absolutely bizarre.
Draco looked at him incredulously. “Potter, it’s in less than two weeks,” he said, brows creasing further when Harry only shrugged in response, burrowing into his Gryffindor scarf. “You’re not going to get sweets for everyone, are you?”
“No” Harry said apologetically as he set the box onto Malfoy’s table gingerly. “I like your office. The décor isn’t quite what I expected from you though,” he gestured at the entire office of Malfoy’s company. “And the location.”
Draco stared at him with déja vu as he recalled Blaise's refrain when he had first mentioned a contract.
"No, I can be anything I want," Harry argued as he tried to resist Draco's forceful hands, trying to close his fingers.
"If you nothing," Malfoy replied as he vanished the parchment paper Harry had used as a wrapper. He sent the note away to a drawer in his bedside table before pulling the corner of his comforter, already preparing to turn in.
"Spin the bottle time!" Seamus yelled, crossing his legs as he settled at the edge of the common room.
"Evidently so, Potter. You are less informed about interpersonal matters than Professor Trelawney herself." Draco replied airily.
"I am happy," Harry insisted. "It took me long enough to understand what you've always been saying, that there was more to Harry Potter than risking my life. I want to be there for you when you need me," he said as he reached out to hold Draco's hand in his.
Tears were rapidly welling up in his eyes. He quickly cast a glamour on himself as he tried to wrestle with his emotions. He had spent so much time on the present, and it had all been for nothing at the end.
Entering the class with an apology for Professor Slughorn, Draco instead found the man preoccupied with worshipping Potter at the front row. Looking across the class, he found Blaise smirking at him from the back as he set up his cauldron. Returning it out of habit as he made his way to Blaise, he caught Potter's eyes. For reasons unknown to him, Potter was looking at him pleadingly while Slughorn continued praising him for his intellect and bravery.
The camera zooms out to reveal a stocky man in a frilly pink apron, his lips pursed as he frowns in concentration.
Harry snapped out of his fixation at the lovebites on Draco's neck. He quickly ran after Draco. Instead of obsessing over what had happened between the endless shots, he needed something to do.
Harry quickly moved away and falling into his messy bed. "Are you going to open it?" He asked as he watched Malfoy–while trying his best to not seem too invested. He had returned earlier to find the present on Malfoy's bed, and he had spent an hour lounging about impatiently before settling down to wait for Malfoy at the common room instead.
"You'll probably be able to beat me in the next match though," Harry interrupted as they passed a suit of armour. Draco looked at him in surprise. Had his skills really improved?
Harry huffed as everyone laughed at his expense. He pulled his hand out of Malfoy's to have a proper go at sulking.
"Mr Dearborn, I'm glad that you appreciate the care that St Mungo's has provided during your stay. Should you feel any discomfort or issues with your vision, do return to our emergency care unit for immediate follow up. Otherwise, your documents are in order and I don't hope to see you again," Draco joked as he looked at the man's arm with a wry shake of his head, surprised by the frown that he received instead from his usually chatty patient.
Between the lack of a dessert, Malfoy's rapid fire quizzing and his insistence that Harry showered first, Harry felt like he had truly deserved the entire thing to himself. Nonetheless, because Harry had a kind heart, he had decided to share it with Malfoy while impatiently waiting for him to unwrap his own present.
"No! Apart from Saturday! Like Friday or whatever!" Harry said in frustration, desperately controlling the urge to shake Draco.
. It doesn't always have to be magically binding. Though, now that you've put the thought in my head..." he trailed off.
"No," Malfoy shook his head sharply, then flinching as if stunned by his own vehemence. "Merlin, I don't mean that. I'll share them later, but I want to look at it a bit more. I want to show them to my friends too," he said softly as he worried at his bottom lip.
“Just a few,” Harry replied, surprised that they had not started brawling. Maybe they were friends? But their messages only consisted of work related messages, and if Ron and Hermione didn’t know that they were friends—were they friends?
Harry shook his head in dark amusement at the easy picking when he heard the intruder walking into the heavy brass stand for fireplace tools. His brows raised when the wards triggered once more and a second voice could be heard scolding their companion.
"Giving it a miss," Draco replied, already excited to read about the outcomes of Muggles conducting barbaric experiments on smaller animals in the name of research.
friend says things like these. And you wonder why Andromeda never brought us together." He rolled his eyes again for punctuation. "She fears that she would have two children on her hands if we met."
"I've never– the Slytherins aren't– I'm very noticeable," Malfoy mumbled when he finally tore his eyes away. Harry nodded in understanding. Lucius would have disowned his son immediately if the news of his son's purchases spread.
"Well I don't see the difference!" Malfoy said vehemently as he threw his hands in the air. "Your arse is literally out!"
I asked Hermione about my clothes and she agreed that they were a little bit tight. I usually get the same size because I'm not very good at shopping. I might have gained muscles without noticing.
," he broke off as he started to pace about the room while mumbling under his breath. He made a beeline for Harry's old wrappers before laughing in a sharp huff.
I was surprised to receive your owl. I would like to apologise for the spectacle I unintentionally caused during our last meeting. I was a bit too worked up by your clothes, and I do not mean the accusations that I levied on you.
He would just peek around the tapestry before continuing on his merry way, just enough to tease Pansy about them. It would surely be someone embarrassing, or Pansy would have—he froze at his friend’s breathy moan of her lover’s name, his outstretched hand trembling when a voice responded. It was worse than anyone his mind could ever imagine.
"That would be me, one of the many indebted to Healer Draco's skillful hands." If the patient was surprised to see the saviour of the wizarding world and the Appleby Arrows' exalted seeker, it didn't show.
"Wait," Hermione called out. "I think that we're not talking about the same things. We're asking Pansy why she's avoiding us, not asking her to stay away from us."
Draco had reserved the end of the year for his mother, and had helped to rearrange her garden pebbles from atop his broom through the morning. The gathering at the Weasley’s had left him wistful as he watched Harry beat girl Weasley to the Snitch by a hair’s breadth, and he had forced himself onto a broom immediately after breakfast with his family. He had been frightened as it ascended, but as it moved shakily towards his impatient mother, muscle memory had returned, and Draco had swiftly regained control of his broom.
?" His soulmate's handwriting was a ridiculous, traditional cursive that only made everything worse.
Anyhow, Christmas with the Weasleys had been similarly enjoyable. Molly and Arthur had been hospitable, and his mother had enjoyed the expanded adult company. In true rule number five fashion, Draco had thanked Harry for the tall stack of Muggle behavioural economics and university psychology textbooks without reading too much to the thoughtfulness of the gift. The haul that Draco received had been amazing, albeit more dominated by books than in past years. He had also gotten a
Harry James Potter is sitting nude atop a white marble counter with a Slytherin scarf wrapped around his neck. There is a present beautifully wrapped in a foil of Appleby Arrows' pale blue on his lap. A thin silver ribbon completes it.
Returning his book bag to his bed, Draco settled into his favourite couch as he started to pen a letter to his mother. She had last talked about meeting her sister Andromeda and his first cousin once removed, Edward Lupin, and Draco had asked Potter about the small family to help endear his mother to them.
"Glad I thought ahead," Draco commented shamelessly as he unfolded the straw mat with a flourish. Taking off his shoes, he stepped onto the surface before proceeding to lie on his back with a noisy, contented sigh. "Come here, Potter," Draco called out lazily as he patted the space beside him lightly. "We'll have our desserts, and we can revise Astronomy until the next light show."
"Stones!" He greeted his fellow prefect coolly as he combed his fringe back, quickly thinking of a reasonable explanation before the boy ran off, likely to embellish on and share what he had seen. He grimaced as Potter continued jabbing him in the small of his back with the end of his broom. He backed towards his friend in warning.
Draco seemed to consider his words before filling two glasses with water. Floating it to the polished coffee table, he walked slowly towards Harry.
"Let's go together," Harry said when the gift emanated a green glow of safety. Summoning his toiletries quickly, he pretended to miss the flush on Malfoy's cheeks.
"What is it," Malfoy asked as he pulled his sweater off. "What is it?" He repeated impatiently, walking over when Harry continued to blink at his present in shock.
"Thank you, Parkinson," Hermione said coolly as she gestured at everyone to take a seat. She placed the bottle in the middle of the circle. "No forfeits, no bullying, no mentions about the war, and please be reasonable in your truth or dares. Most importantly, everything said or done here stays here. Neville, Lisa and I will be the judge of whether the questions are reasonable. Parkinson will start, since she gets things done."
Lifting the filter, Draco poured the water into the teacups. His mind cleared as he lost himself to the ritual.
He had completed his volunteer training on empathy and communication, and had been assigned to his first choice placement, patient and parent support. He had also met Jo, his fellow volunteer, and had learnt that as a first-timer, he had been incredibly lucky to have gotten a patient facing role. Draco had wondered futilely how he had impressed them, before deciding that he would work hard to assure them of their decision.
Potter laughed weakly as they walked in silence. "I wasn't upset that I was bisexual," Potter said before correcting himself. "I'm not upset that I'm bisexual. It was a surprise, but I think that it was the circumstances, you know? Like the rug was pulled from underneath me. And I was lost."
It was unbecoming to skulk about, but it definitely counted as extenuating circumstances. There was little he could do, he reasoned with himself, doubling back towards the front of the Post Office for the umpteenth time, before stopping and turning away once more. Oh for Merlin's sake! Draco huffed, clenching his jaw as he stormed through the doors, envelope in hand.
"We won't be going to the amusement park. It'll be too late." He should have known better than to spend time anticipating Draco's replies when he was so fond of curveballs. "No one goes to the amusement park at night," he explained exasperatedly when Draco continued to search his eyes for deceit.
Harry made himself comfortable as he lay on his side to watch the television while Narcissa continued to knead his calf. They laughed together when the protagonist made another sarcastic remark.
Harry rolled his eyes as he pushed Draco’s hand away. He needed to focus, not be manipulated by his soulmate. “Not if I strangle you first for holding your soulmark against me all the time.”
"Well, that's a stretch. I don't think that you're perfect," Harry said skeptically. "You're a proper embarrassment, honestly."
"I can't believe that you just realised it," Draco tutted, infinitely happier at having displayed his dominance. He suddenly paused with a dark frown. "Potter, are you punishing me for your gay epiphany? Are you ashamed of being bisexual? You can't become bisexual from hanging out with a homosexual, Potter! Homosexuality isn't contagious, and can I remind you that you've been unknowingly bisexual since your sexual awakening when you were fourteen?" He folded his arms. He didn't want to penalise Potter for the oppressive upbringing from the heartless specimen of Muggles who had raised him, but it hurt that the poster boy for acceptance had blamed him for
"Erm," Harry was shocked by the confrontation. He fidgeted nervously, his eyes darting between a furious Malfoy and the corridor that they could have been walking down together.
Fucking Potter, Draco thought, as he made his way across the Muggle's living room blandly. Fuck Hermione too, he added for good measure as he pulled the main door close behind him with a world weary sigh. Draco spelled the laces of his boots up as he thought about the next strongly worded letter he would send her. It would probably make her day, and given her packed schedule, Merlin knew she needed a good pick-me-up. Draco quickly concealed his wand when he heard the fiddling of the neighbouring unit's lock.
Malfoy groaned sharply when he noticed Harry's distraction. "Get yourself together, Potter. We'll chat again during dinner."
Malfoy raised his hands as if presenting himself. "Who would be interested in a disgraced Death Eater? The Malfoy name has been tarnished even within Purebloods. I'll most likely be a dirty secret, or a notch on people's bed posts," he said with a deprecating smile.
Oh, Salazar's slapping balls! Draco waved his clothes back into the wardrobe, only for Harry to flick them back out distractedly as he reached into the wardrobe. He flipped the calendar forward, something Draco had never been able to do due to Hermione's ridiculous spells to conceal Harry's photographs until the start of the new month. It had been intended to drive the calendar sales throughout the year, and while it had been incredibly frustrating, it was undeniably effective. Draco used leap out of bed at the start of every month, discreetly consuming articles lauding Potter's tantalising pictures (lengthy descriptions in prose due to Hermione's replication limitations), and he had even stayed up once to uncover February's photograph at midnight. It had been so ridiculous.
For example, he had initially begun with gripes about sharing a room with Malfoy, before he realised that Malfoy was a considerate roommate. The rants had then become about Malfoy's unnerving reticence, his occasional limp and prolonged absences, which would then progress to concerns about Malfoy's nightmares and his dietary habits or lack thereof–but alas, Hermione had already established the ban on Malfoy observations by then. While it was undeniable that his points would stagnate for a while until he made new observations, Harry felt that his friends should look at the variety he had to offer in the long run.
Someone tapped on Harry's right shoulder. Harry spun around and stared down at a girl who stared back at him.
"Need some help?" Draco smiled and helped Harry place the trunk by the doorway. "Thank you" Harry kissed Draco's cheek and ran into Draco's bedroom. Harry must've changed while he was packing because he was now in his pajamas instead of the sweatshirt and joggers Draco had given him after his shower.
"Oh well..well...I'm..maybe" Neville shrugged and began getting nervous again. "I've dated him, you'd be lucky to have him. Not as lucky as you would be if you got this one though" Draco smiled and laid his head on Harry's shoulder. Neville smiled in awe. "I hope I can have what you two do." Neville said.
Harry noticed Draco's hands had been a tiny bit sweaty. He seemed more jittery than usual. Harry let it slide because maybe it was just excitement or something.
Harry wanted to scream, cry, and punch something all at once. Nothing made sense to him. He wanted Draco so bad. Harry wouldn't let himself get hurt, so he decided to shut him out. Harry wanted to punch Draco square in the nose for making him so confused.
They both scowled at the same time, clearly both annoyed at the utter shit Dumbledore was speaking. "But maybe this will be an opportunity for a new friendship...Now I've already had house elves take your things to your new dorm." Dumbledore pulled a lemon drop out of a bowl next to him and popped it into his mouth.
Once he had calmed down they all took off. Soaring through the sky, passing so many different settings. A forest, a lake, a booming city, cabins, neighborhoods. Draco could barely focus. It was difficult staying steady on his broom. He didn't want to face his father. He didn't want to know what his father had done to Harry.
"Well thank you darling" Narcissa said from the doorway. Draco walked back into the room. "Hermione dear why don't you come with me and pick something out to sleep in?" Narcissa smiled kindly from the door. Hermione looked around before getting up. "Alright thank you Ms. Malfoy." She walked over to the doorway and they walked out together.
"No love I don't want to put you out" Harry said and got up, dragging himself to his wardrobe. "I insist" Draco smiled and walked into the bathroom, turning the water on. He grabbed some candles and positioned them around the tub.
Draco took Harry's hand and sighed. Draco sat there and thought. Harry must've been so scared in the bathroom and felt so alone. It made Draco cringe that he wasn't there for Harry when he needed him most.
"Harry Potter." A tiny smile appearing in the corner of Draco's mouth. Harry stared at him, waiting for him to continue.
Harry hadn't even realized that there were warm tear streams running down his face. He was so emotional, it was embarrassing. "...Potter" Draco said softly. Harry had only heard that part of whatever Draco had said. Harry didn't respond he just sat there. "Potter" Draco said a little louder. Harry looked up to meet eyes with him.
Harry was standing there staring down at Draco. Harry now most definitely knew what was going on. "You're a monster! That's your son!" Harry shouted at him. "No son of mine would ever be gay." Lucius responded. "Come along Harry. I want to take you somewhere" Lucius grabbed Harry's arm. Harry tried to jerk his arm free. Lucius just tightened his grip.
They kissed. Blaise to make the first move, trailed his hand along Neville's cheek. Their lips instantly meeting, they were so drawn to each other. It was difficult for them to not.
"Are you sure love?" Draco licked his lips and stared at Harry. "Yes please fuck..please" Harry begged and stared at Draco with a needy look in his eyes. Draco smirked and reached over into his bedside table grabbing a small purple bottle and a little foil packet. Draco looked at his bedroom door, it was unlocked.
"You scared me" Harry whispered. "I didn't mean to" Draco got comfortable in his seat and pulled out his book. Harry looked at his book. "Shakespeare?" He asked, confused. Draco nodded. "As much as you hate muggles I would've never guessed you would be reading a muggle book" Harry laughed quietly.
"I couldn't agree more." A deeper voice, sounding like a man said from the staircase. Everyone's heads snapped back to look at him.
"Are you hungry though?" Draco said again. "I'll be fine until dinner." Harry said softly and sat down on his bed.
"Obviously you've seen some things, on me, that seem to define me" Harry fiddled with his shirt's corner. Draco got comfortable on the couch as he stared at Harry intently. "But they aren't me, they are just my exterior, and yes it looks bad it also feels bad" Harry paused for one of many shaky breaths he would take during this conversation.
Harry snuggled up to Draco and smelled him. Draco smiled and held Harry. "This is all I ever want" Draco said softly. "You are all I ever want"
"James." Harry responded. "Harry James Potter." Draco said as if he was making sure he got it right. "Yeah that's it." Harry smiled and gazed up at the sky. "What's yours?"
A bruise on his right rib cage. A bruise on his shin. A raw cheek from being slapped one too many times.  A blade sitting next to him on his old cot. Harry knew it was wrong he knew he promised Draco he wouldn't. He couldn't take it. He had to. So he did. He did and it felt exhilarating. He cried and cried.
"We have got to change that password" Draco and Harry had both said at the same time. "For once we agree on something, I don't want that twit popping in whenever he pleases." Harry said with anger brooding in his tone.
Ron choked on his food now. "All choked up now aren't you Ron" Harry smiled. Hermione was just staring wide eyed, mouth agape. "You asked" Draco snickered. "Well I didn't need to know" Ron stated catching his breath. They all quieted down. Harry and Draco smirked at each other and continued eating.
"Not as much as Malfoy will" Ron snickered. Draco chuckled. "Shut up Ron" Harry said playfully. "He's not wrong" Draco smirked. Harry blushed and turned his attention down to his food. Hermione smiled at the two of them. "How were classes yesterday?" Draco asked Ron. He was trying to make civil conversation. "Quite boring really, just like everyday" Ron smiled.
"Can you write the letters? I wanna get out of this suit and lay down" Harry grumbled as he walked into their bedroom. Draco laughed. "Of course I can love." Draco took off his tie and his rings. He grabbed three pieces of parchment. To send to Blaise, Neville, Ron and Hermione. Harry walked into the bathroom and removed his tie, his suit, and his glasses. Harry put on his pajamas and walked back out into the bedroom.
They would simply make out, hopefully maybe more eventually. But that would be all, no sweetness, no love, no feelings. Unless more happened, unless something blossomed. Draco's heart deserved to stay cold. Draco deserved to be alone.
Harry chuckled and agreed. They continued to have a conversation until house elves came into the room with plates of food. Narcissa came in as well in an emerald green dress. "Wow Mum you look absolutely gorgeous" Draco smiled at his mother.
"Where is Potter anyway?" Draco looked at them. "It's Potter now?" Hermione looked at him. "Just answer my question." Draco sat there hoping they wouldn't say the bathroom. He was back in there to grab his envelope and maybe talk to Harry. Draco remembered in his frantic state he had just thrown it about aimlessly.
Harry eagerly removed Draco's shirt completely. Draco pulled away from Harry and swiftly removed Harry's shirt, popping a few buttons off along the way. "Fuck you're so beautiful" Draco mumbled and sat down on the bed with Harry. Harry straddling Draco's lap. Harry reconnected their lips and ran his hands along Draco's exposed chest. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry securely.
"What's up Harry?" Neville looked at him. "Just a few questions" Harry smiled. Ron and Hermione were obviously lost, but didn't really care. They began talking with Draco about how school has been complete rubbish.
"Those would be nightmares" Harry smiled a fake smile. Before Draco could push on with questions about his actual nightmare Harry continued talking "But enough about that what time is it?" Harry asked looking at the clock squinting his eyes trying to read it. "It's half past 11" Draco said smiling to himself about how cute it was when Harry was trying to read the clock. Draco kept mentally kicking himself, he needed to stop.
"Well then you all can stop by say tomorrow night?" Harry looked at all of them. They all nodded. "Make sure to knock before entering, you wouldn't believe how many times these two blokes walked in on something they shouldn't have" Draco chuckled and looked at Ron and Hermione. Harry felt a slight blush creep up on his cheeks. Ron and Hermione nodded in agreement with Draco.
"I know, but the view is much more intriguing  than my food" Draco smirked and ate his food. He was teasing Harry, trying to embarrass Harry. Harry felt a slight blush creep up on his cheeks. Draco looked over at Harry who was only poking at his food.
Neville was clearly much more nervous than Blaise was. Neville wore a black suit with a red tie. His hair looked messy yet neat, it looked as if it was completely neat at one point but it had been messed up from Neville's hands nervously running through it. Neville looked jittery and full of anxiety.
"But I wanted to save myself for our wedding night." Harry said sarcastically. Draco smirked and chuckled. "Right" Draco rolled his eyes and reconnected their lips. Harry smirked and ran his hands down Draco's bare chest.
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's waist, pulling him closer. He laid Harry's head on his chest and held him. Harry felt tears well back up in his eyes. He tried to hold it back. "Let it out.." Draco said softly and rubbed Harry's back just as softly. Harry tried to hold it back, but couldn't. All of his emotions rushed out, he cried. He just cried.
"Come on now Harry" Draco wrapped his arm around Harry's waist and smirked about it because he knew he was giving his godfather a heart attack. Harry looked back at Snape who now had a smug smile on his face.
Harry smiled insincerely just wanting Dumbledore to go away. Harry had already dealt with enough Dumbledore for the day. "Oh well yes I do believe there is no reason for me to be here anymore, you boys get comfortable and make yourselves at home. Goodbye"
Draco instantly opened Harry's wardrobe and began sifting through it. He was trying his hardest to ignore the smell of Harry. The smell of his boyfriend.
Harry thought considering all the green it was most likely a posh and rude Slytherin. "Watch where you're going Potter." A velvety rude, yet familiar voice spilled into his ears. The person, who Harry had now identified to be a boy because of their voice was looking down at Harry where he was grabbing around for his glasses. "Aren't those glasses supposed to help you see better?" the boy chuckled and his friends laughed.
Harry was smiling and beaming pure white light. These dreams seemed fathomable. That's what made everything better. "We can tell our child about how we came to fall in love, about how we made it, about how we beat the odds" Harry smiled and kissed Draco softly. Draco kissed back with a large smile plastered on his face.
Barty smirked. "Hon, this is going to be our biggest accomplishment yet." He said. Bellatrix turned around to face him. "I couldn't be more excited" She said with a devilish smirk on her face.
"The teasing sickens me" Harry scoffed and rolled his eyes. "Darling, I love you." Draco smiled down at Harry and turned around to begin washing himself. Harry sat down on the shower floor wanting the water to hit his sore muscles. "Move out of the wayy" Harry hit Draco's shin softly. "Gimme a second I need to wash the shampoo out" Draco looked back and down to Harry.
He took a moment to think back to his wedding as his husband chased their child throughout their bedroom with the cutest and tiniest jacket Harry had ever seen.
It was getting dark outside. Harry was going to go back to his real home. He needed to see Draco. He needed to feel Draco's warmth radiating off of him. He needed to feel the love pumping through his veins instead of the loneliness and despair.
"Fight!" Bellatrix said and smirked. She began targeting Narcissa, spells flying left and right. Narcissa deflecting them all and throwing them right back. "My own Sister!" Narcissa yelled at her. "Oh whatever!" Bellatrix rolled her eyes out and stuck her tongue out at her. The spells kept flying through the air.
"The little red head Weasel girl. She saw us making out. How the hell did you think it was me?!" Blaise said to him. Harry and Draco's faces matched. Both of them were more shocked than they ever had been.
They all caught their breath and calmed down. "Well, since we've all laughed our arses off I feel the question doesn't need to be answered" Draco smirked and continued eating. "Well then. Christmas, how about you all stop by on Christmas for a little gift exchange yeah?" Ron suggested.
"Oh yeah why's that?" Ron said and got up, going to the couch taking Hermione with him. "He's always been outgoing and really not giving a shit" Draco said and poured himself a glass of water. Harry took it and took a sip. "Darling, if you wanted one you could've just asked" Draco chuckled and poured another glass.
His uncle chuckled. "Come on Dudley let's go watch tv" Vernon said. "Alright" Dudley replied and walked over to the tv.
Bellatrix had opened all of her gifts. She got up and hugged everyone, saying thank you along the way. "I'll be right back" She smiled and disappeared into her room.
Harry dropped the robe he had put on and slowly stepped into the tub. Once he was in the bubbles covered him completely. "you're so gorgeous" Draco said under his breath. "Why don't you join me love, you must be a little stressed to-" Harry was cut off by a knock at the door.
"Oh no I insist." Neville said. "Speak now." Blaise slightly commanded. Neville's cheeks heated up. Draco, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were watching in awe. They were all trying their best not to laugh.
Draco bit his lip softly and smirked. Draco was extremely turned on by the sight of this. He had never seen that side of Harry before. That side that was so, outgoing and confident. Draco liked it.
Hermione and Ron helped Draco outside. Ron patted Draco's back. "He'll be alright mate" Hermione said and Draco got on the back of the broom his mother was riding.
"What person?" He said once more. "Let's just say you know her rather well Potter." Pansy smirked and looked down at Harry's hands.
Draco's face dropped. "Stupefy?" He looked up at her. Her face lit up "Oh yes yes that's the one, Harry fell to the floor and closed his eyes, the other boy opened Harry's mouth and poured something from a vial into Harry's mouth, once Harry awoke he was smitten" Myrtle smiled and giggled.
"I am so absolutely deeply infatuated with you. You are the most gorgeous person I have ever laid my eyes on. I cant even imagine my life without you. I love your smile, your eyes, your smell, your laugh, and so much more darling. It doesn't get any better than you. I could never stop loving you. You are my dream come true, you are my comfort person. You are my safety. You are the stability I longed for, for so long. You are my home." Draco was a bit teary by the time he was done talking. He meant every single word he said.
Harry was going to do whatever he could to keep the visit off of his mind. He was going to distract himself all day, until the time would come for him to go.
"Oh good" Blaise let out a sigh of relief. "Could you maybe..oh I don't know put in a good word for me? Maybe? Please?" Blaise smiled a little and adjusted his seating position. "Yes, Neville talked about you quite a bit. He always talks about how amazing you are at potions. He always says he wants to be your 'friend'." Harry chuckled at Blaises reactions throughout his sentence.
Draco just looked him in the eyes. He hoped Harry knew he wouldn't make fun. Harry smiled a very sad empty smile. He looked nervous and scared. Harry reluctantly began slowly unbuttoning his shirt. Draco didn't break eye contact. He didn't dare look down until Harry was finished. Draco just stared at Harry. Harry stared back and finished unbuttoning his shirt.
Within the next thirty minutes the water had cooled and the bubbles had disappeared. "It's time to get out love" Draco said, standing up out of the tub. Harry sighed and got up as well. Draco drained the tub and put his clothes back on.
Draco didn't care, he shoved through all of the grossed out students until he made it to the hospital wing. Snape was standing outside. "How is he?" Draco sniffled and stared at Snape.
The fights began to collide, Harry, Draco, and Narcissa against the other two. "Stupefy!" Narcissa yelled pointing her wand at Barty, for some reason he didn't deflect it, or even try to. It hit him and he fell unconscious.
"Draco?" Harry was now becoming increasingly frantic. "Draco?!" Harry ran around the dorm looking for him. His vision became blurred from tears welling up in his eyes. They had just gotten each other back, now they were apart again.
Draco wrapped his arm around Harry's waist soothingly. "What about?" Harry furrowed his eyebrows. "Christmas break is very soon as you probably already know" Snape said.
"Why would she do that?" Harry asked. "I don't know why you're asking me. You dated her Harry you should know" Blaise turned his attention down to Harry. "I didn't really date her..but no I have no idea." Harry fiddled with his fingers.
Harry looked back to his own table and started listening to what Snape was talking about. "...working with amorentia" Snape said in his normal monotone voice. Harry looked over at Draco once more, Draco was staring right back.
"We have the house elves preparing a meal. So how about we just relax while we wait?" Draco said sitting down in one of the armchairs. Harry sat down on Draco's lap. Hermione and Ron sat down on another armchair together.
"Draco" Harry said softly. Draco's heart fell to his stomach. He felt butterflies swarm inside of him. Honestly he almost fell off of his broom. "Yes?" Draco said just as softly. "I wouldn't have it any other way" Harry smiled. Draco was mesmerized by Harry. He was mesmerized by his every move, every word, every breath.
A grand king size bed was pushed against a wall in the center of the room, grey duvet and silky grey pillowcases. The bed frame was absolutely stunning, hand carved figures were in the dark wood of it. There were two suggestively large windows on either side of the bed. There were two wardrobes. One had a gryffindor emblem on it while the other had a slytherin emblem on it. "I figured I would put the emblems on them so you two know who's wardrobe is who's so you two didn't fuss about it" She smiled.
Draco awoke to the sounds of someone thrashing and..whimpering? He looked over at the clock, it read 2:02 am. He became aware of his new surroundings. It was going to be tough having to get used to waking up without a bunch of people around him. He truly hated being alone. Draco registered the sounds in his brain once more to make sure he hadn't imagined them. He heard them once more, Draco grabbed his wand in case it was any type of danger. He slowly left his room and followed the sounds. They were coming from Harry's bedroom.
"Me too" Draco whispered back and played with Harry's hair. Harry sighed and didn't let go. Harry was trying to memorize how this felt, how Draco holding him and keeping him safe felt. He wanted to be able to remember it when he was away. Harry wanted to be able to remember this so when he felt like doing his awful habit again he may stop himself. Draco kissed Harry's forehead.
Harry looked down at his feet not knowing what else to do. Draco was looking at Dumbledore waiting for the next idiotic thing that would come out of his mouth. "Well come on boys let me show you to your new housing" He smiled and got up walking in front of us, expecting us to follow. Harry started walking but Draco cut him off. "I will always walk in front of you, I will always be on top of you," Draco spat at him and followed Dumbledore through the many twists and turns of Hogwarts until they finally reached their dorm. It was in a secluded part of the building.
Harry's face which once lit up a room with his smile, was pale and expressionless. Draco was sobbing, his whole body ached. He felt as if the glue holding him together had all just melted away. Draco's heart was breaking with every passing second. He stared down at the lifeless body of the love of his life. Draco could barely see, he could barely breathe.
"So now they're gone?" Draco said chuckling once more. "Yes they've completely disappeared, good for you Draco" She skipped off and stopped along the way to tell people about their wrackspurts. He chuckled. Looney Luna.
"No we did not, he's lying. I put much thought into the gifts." Harry smiled a satisfactory smile and sat back as everyone began unwrapping their gifts.
Draco placed his hand on Harry's. Harry looked up at Draco and smiled. "I got you a gift." Draco said softly and handing Harry a box. Harry quirked his head. "I've got one for you two." Harry handed Draco a smaller box.
Harry looked up at him with his head quirked. "That's all? So why is everyone being odd?" Harry asked. "I may have seemed a tad bit in love with you..." Draco smirked.
"Oh woah woah no" Draco and Harry said chuckling. Neville appeared confused. "No not like we're not in love or perfect or anything. You just definitely don't want all the threats and worry." Draco said. "Oh yeah right" Neville said, sounding a little less confused. "Neville you should come by sometime, we could hang out, Blaise could come too" Harry said smiling.
A girl, with red hair, gryffindor robes. No doubt a Weasley, stoped in front of them. "Harry what are you doing with this muck. You shouldn't be associating yourself with this gay wanker." She stared at Harry. Harry was holding back his laughter. "Gay wanker, that's funny" Harry said and chuckled. "Well goodbye Ginny great talking to you" Harry pulled Draco away.
He sighed. "Never ugly" he mumbled and placed his lips on the furthest up bruise, the one on Harry's chest.
He set the table and served everyones food. His family all came in and sat at their places. His Uncle took one bite and looked up at Harry. "What is this?" He said "Ch-chicken" Harry said softly. "It's a disgrace,  are you trying to kill your aunt and cousin and myself?! Huh freak?" His uncle yelled at him
Draco and Harry both rolled their eyes sarcastically at Snape's dramatic exit. "Ready?" Draco looked down at Harry. "Ready." Harry smiled and they proceeded to walk out of the large room. They walked through the halls. They received a lot of looks, kind looks. People awing and swooning over the two of them. Harry found it odd that people were paying attention to them. They never had before.
Madam hooch stated and intertwined her own hands in front of her. "Thank you Madam Hooch" Draco said cooly. Harry and Draco started off the field. They were both laughing to themselves. "Oh and if you boys do come snooping around here again, just don't let me catch you" Madam Hooch winked and walked off.
Harry was lost deep in thought when Ron snapped him out of it. "Harry I've been calling your name for the past 2 minutes mate" Ron said annoyed "Sorry I was just thinking about the.. classes I took this year."
Draco offered a small smile then let it drop. "It's fine Potter now go to sleep and stop waking me up" Draco said smoothly. "Alright Malfoy, oh and that beauty sleep isn't working." Harry said softly and laid back down. "You're such a prat Potter" Draco said walking out of his room.
Harry sighed and continued fidgeting to put his shoe on. Draco walked off and got dressed. He fixed his tie and his hair. He took a deep breath before leaving his room. "Very dashing" Harry said chuckling. Draco's heart ached and his stomach churned. "Don't be odd Potter" He said trying to sound his most steady and rude.
They continued chatting while dinner was being prepared, nothing necessarily interesting considering all of the awkward energy in the room.
"That was nothing compared to what would start happening. My room is under the stairs, it's tiny, hot, and frankly disgusting. My uncle...well he.." Harry cleared his throat and bit the inside of his cheek.  He took a deep breath trying to maintain his composure.
Hermione giggled and hugged back. Draco was next to hug her. "You do look absolutely stunning" Draco smiled.
They left and Harry lifted his head back up. "We really have got to change that password" Harry smiled and ran his fingers along the other side of his neck. Draco rubbed his hand along Harry's back. He could tell Harry was tired or..worn out.
"I had this place renovated so you two could have a place to stay out of Hogwarts. Like your own little house" Narcissa sniffled, she was so happy they had each other. "Oh my mum it's amazing" Draco felt tears prickle in his eyes. Harry was just frozen and speechless staring at the gorgeous place in front of his eyes.
They walked out of their dorm and down the hall. "See you later" Draco said smiling and walked a separate way. Harry watched him walk away. He smiled and walked his own way to charms class.
"Wouldn't hurt to look would it?" Ron got up. Harry shrugged and got up as well. Hermione got up too. They all walked around Harry's dorm searching for an envelope. Ron made his way into Draco's room and began to search. "Harry?" Ron asked "Yes?" He replied. Hermione was looking in the common room.
"If you want him you have to get through me!" Draco yelled at her and threw spells at her like a madman. Harry did the same. "I'm okay with killing you and him hon." Bellatrix giggled.
He wanted to make Harry forget all the pain. He wanted to make Harry feel good. His lips, mouth, and hands were the only thing Draco had to offer. Draco constantly thought he wasn't worth much other than that. No, scratch that Draco knew he wasn't worth much more than that.
"Hello Madame Pomfrey, Snape has ordered Harry be here, do you mind if I take him in?" Draco said politely. "Oh I usually wouldn't allow it, but I was about to go on a little dinner break so go ahead hon" Madame Pomfrey smiled and let them in.
"Of course I will you big sap" He could barely get his words out from crying. Harry kneeled to Draco's level and threw his arms around him. Draco kissed Harry's cheek and then his lips. "I love you, I love you" Harry smiled and kissed Draco again. Draco pulled the ring out of the box and slipped it onto Harry's finger.
"Lumos" Draco said and the tip of his wand lit up, it was dark in the hallways because it was late. Draco held Harry's hand the whole way back. Portraits along the way shouting things like "we're trying to sleep you inconsiderate nobhead" and "turn the damn light off"
They entered the room and both boys were in awe of how gorgeous the room was. There was a fireplace with a gorgeous red couch placed in front of it. A coffee table with the Gryffindor and Slytherin emblems on it. Two red armchairs, a white fluffy rug, and four  doors. "This place needs more green" Draco said crossing his arms and raising a disapproving eyebrow.
Draco didn't start pumping his fingers until Harry adjusted to this foreign item being put inside of him. Draco's fingers brushed against Harry's prostate causing him to moan louder then he ever had. "Baby, sh.." Draco pulled his fingers out.
"We were wondering if you two would want to come to a dinner at the manor sometime during break?" Harry began eating. "Yes that sounds like a great time" Hermione smiled and nodded. Ron nodded as well. "Neville" Harry looked down the table and gestured for him to come over. Draco indulged in a conversation with Ron about how he was a ginger.
Draco came back only a few minutes later with Snape. "Harry glad to see you safe" Snape smiled. "Me too sir" Harry said. "No more sir, call me Sev." Snape said back. Harry nodded.
Harry turned around to face him. "Yes a very sweet moment of me saying bye to my friends Malfoy." Harry didn't make eye contact with Draco because well Draco was very intimidating, but Harry wouldn't let himself look a like a scared child.
"Yeah mate sounds great." Draco smiled and lead them to the door. Harry followed. "It's been lovely. Bye you two" Neville smiled and walked out into the cold air. Blaise followed him.
Harry looked down at arm where his sleeve had lifted, it was only the backside so if Draco saw anything it wasn't the...markings upon his wrist. Harry swiftly pulled the sleeve down and looked back up to Draco. Draco seemed to have a look of concern or worry, but he quickly dropped that look.
"Let me see maybe I can identify this 'spell' that went wrong" Hermione smiled and pulled Harry's collar down. "Oh yes I recognize this one" Hermione said smiling and looking at Ron mischievously. "It's the 'Harry has love bites' one" Hermione laughed and Ron did as well. Harry turned a deeper shade of red and pulled his collar back up. "So we were intruding earlier" Ron said chuckling and shoving more food in his mouth.
"It took pretty damn long" Draco replied. "Let's get a drink or two and head back" Draco said. Ron looked at him. "Why are you in such a rush mate? Harry won't be back until Sunday" He said.
They made their way downstairs, passing Bellatrix on the way. They smiled to her and continued to the main room. Narcissa was already in there, sitting on the couch. She seemed to be waiting for them.
"Go put it on" Neville said. Draco nodded and went into the bathroom, he opened the bag which contained his suit. One thing was for sure, he had a great fashion sense.
Harry took a moment to look out at the city then around the top of the tower. "Where is everyone?" Harry looked around. "I may have rented out this platform. It's the highest  and most beautiful view. And ever since Lucius  died I've had the money" Draco snickered.
Harry's tears were long gone, the sadness and uneasiness in his stomach had disappeared. Draco slowly sat up and looked down at Harry. Their hands were still intertwined. "Thank you" Harry said quietly.
Draco sighed a happy sigh and continued to read. Harry did the same. They read for what felt like hours. Draco would occasionally underline sentences he liked. Those little things made Harry smile. One specific line stood out to Harry the most.
"It's gorgeous darling" Draco kissed Harry, Draco really kissed Harry with every ounce of love in his body. "Okay okay your turn, It was sort of last minute. Although I think you'll love it" Draco smiled and waited impatiently for Harry to unwrap his gift.
"Sev?" Draco stared at him. "I told Headmaster I would see Potter off" Snape said in his usual monotone. "Why?" Draco proceeded to stare. "So you two can have your time to say bye without the Headmaster watching" Snape's lips upturned into a small smile. Harry came out of his room and smiled. "Snape" He walked up to him dragging his trunk along. "Yes yes hello." Snape smiled again.
We would love to have you for dinner tomorrow at Malfoy Manor.  Arrive at whatever time you please as long as it is before 5:30. I assume you will be able to make it considering you told me you would be able to yesterday. Please wear something formal, dresses and suits.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Always with the dramatics Potter" Draco left the room, his heart hurt and confused. What did Draco say that triggered Harry to get angry. Harry seemed to be on short fuse anyways. Draco went to his bedroom and turned on his lamp. He sat there and thought about Harry and his father. It was around 4:02 A.M.
Harry wiped his eyes and took deep breaths.  He closed his eyes softly and sunk down to the floor. Harry had no energy to move. Harry hoped living with Draco would've made Draco a little nicer. He thought maybe they would come to an agreement that the feud was silly. Sadly they didn't. He was still some prat. A prat Harry had wanted since 3rd year. In a friend way though, because Harry was straight. Or so he tried to convince himself.
"It was fun, we should do it again sometime with all of them. Like a get together" Harry smiled and began cleaning up the wrapping paper. Draco helped. "Everything is so perfect love" Draco smiled. "It really is" Harry smiled as well, feeling light as air.
Draco put nice smelling bath salts into the tub, along with bubbles. "Harry darling come on" Draco said out into the bedroom. Harry could hear Ron and Hermione having a conversation, it made him happy to know his friends wanted to stay.
Harry grabbed onto Draco's shoulders for support. "If it hurts just squeeze my shoulders ok?" Draco said softly. "Just fuck me already" Harry licked his lips. Draco slowly slid himself in, just halfway. Harry gasped in pain and pleasure. Draco groaned, Harry felt so tight. "Are you ok?" Draco kissed Harry. "Y- yes more" Harry nodded and kissed Draco. Draco slowly slid all the way in, waiting until Harry relaxed.
Draco wanted to cry, if something happened to Harry he would be truly alone again. A selfish reason he knew. It wasn't just that. It was that Harry had grown so close to him, Harry began to mean so much to him. Draco truly cared for Harry, he would just fall apart if anything happened to him. Draco had never cared this much about another human none the less another boy. A boy he was sure he hated for years. A boy who had been through so much, more than anyone deserved.
Harry, Draco, Hermione, and Ron hadn't even noticed yet. Draco was the first to look up and see. "Oh my god" Draco said under his breath causing all of them to look. They all watched in awe. Confused as to how these two incredibly shy boys had come to do this.
Draco pulled away. "You could've just told me to get up, not that i'm complaining." Harry smiled softly. Always softly. "I figured this would be much nicer" Draco smirked and got up. "Dinner is in 30 minutes, I'm going to put my robes on, you should do the same. I'll be back in 20 minutes." Draco smiled and left.
"Harry you're going to be alright I promise." Draco held his hand. "Can one of you do something?!" Draco looked around, he was crying. Snape rushed over and began trying to help.
Draco finished brushing his teeth and answered. "Eh sure" He took it from Harry's hands and opened it. Harry waited patiently. "Nosy much?" Draco looked down at him smiling. "Always" Harry waited. Draco opened it up and read through it.
Draco stared down at Harry, very confused. Draco sat down next to Harry and took his hand. Harry smiled. "Good because Harry I have a favor to ask" Blaise smiled and sat in a chair next to Harry's bed.
"You boys look dashing. Harry you clean up nice" Narcissa smiled and took her seat. "Aunt Bella was just telling us how you two were troublemakers" Draco smiled and dug into his food, they all did.
"Wait so Harry's..like..gay?" Ron said with that confused look on his face he usually had. "Well I mean...I think so I've always thought that." Hermione chuckled to herself. "He's gay?! Like gay? Like into men?" Ron stopped walking. "Well Ron you moron if you were listening I don't know but I think so. Keep your voice down" Hermione said "Oh well I just wish he had told us it's not like we wouldn't have understood, I hope he knows we would love and support him either way" Ron said and continued walking.
"I really want to genuinely apologize" Draco finally looked up from the pillow to meet eyes with Harry. "Apologize?" Harry looked at him as well once he felt Draco's gaze lingering upon him. Draco fiddled with his fingers.
What Harry saw calmed his nerves instantly. "Dray" Harry said softly and wiped his teary eyes. Draco turned around and saw Harry's puffy red eyes and droopy posture. "Oh Harry I didn't think you'd be awake yet" Draco walked over to him and kissed him softly. "I'm so sorry I scared you darling" Draco took Harry's hands in his, rubbing the backs of them with his thumbs.
"Oh, nothing just came to check up again that's all no need to be such a prat Malfoy" Hermione scoffed. She had decided to let them fall in love on their own. Not with the influence of Ron and herself knowing about it. Ron looked down at her but quickly looked back up. "So...you two are....?" Ron asked, teasing Harry. "People attending Hogwarts just like the both of you?" Draco said cutting him off.
"You could say that" Draco smirked. Ron was just sitting there clueless. "What are you even talking about?" He turned his attention to Hermione. "They fucked." Hermione said. Ron looked completely mortified.
Draco got up and grabbed his wand. "I'm going to do it" He wiped his eyes and nose. "Are you sure?" Narcissa looked at him. Draco nodded. "I hate you." Draco said down to his father.
Draco cleared his throat. "Well on with it then, we haven't got all day." Hermione made a plate for Harry. Ron just continued eating while grabbing his things. Draco took Harry's plate along with his own and made his way out of the hall. Hermione and Ron followed.
They finally arrived and Draco dragged himself out of the car. He was in barely any condition to be awake. He hadn't eaten and he had barely slept.
"He hates when I call him that, he prefers Sev, but I prefer making him annoyed" Draco chuckled and walked back into their dormitory. "Although I've never seen him so shocked, as to when he saw your markings on my neck" Draco smirked and ran his finger along them. "Very pretty aren't they?" Draco looked down at Harry. Harry nodded and rubbed his eyes.
"you don't like being late" Harry replied. He felt Draco shrug, "I won't be late" He slowly licked a circle on Harry's neck. Harry grabbed Draco's arms. Draco slowly started sucking, lightly brushing his teeth against the sensitive spot. Harry tilted his head back and rested it on Draco's shoulder.
Draco was on him, his arms on either side of Harry's head holding him up. Draco looked down at Harry for a little. Harry stared back at him, had enough of the sweetness. Not that he didn't love it but he wanted a little more of..whatever that was. Harry smirked and pulled Draco's face down to meet his. Draco entangled his hands in Harry's raven hair.
Harry set his hand on Draco's shoulder, encouraging him to keep talking. Draco took a quick glance down to Harry's hand. "But I was scared, i was scared to tell you i'm an idiot i hurt you and i never intended to, i'm so so sorry Harry, i never meant for anything. I'm so stupid and weak i know i'm a cowar-" Draco was rambling at this point. Nervous once more.  Draco hated but loved how sensitive and open he was now.
Harry just stood there and watched him leave. Harry wondered what he had said or done. His mind was spinning, he turned back and walked back into their dorm. Harry was in a state of shock, he plopped down onto the couch. His brain hurt, as did his heart. He felt like a pathetic little school boy with a broken heart. Harry didn't feel like going to class today. He needed to think over what had just happened. He knew Dumbledore would let him skip, he had Dumbledore under his spell somehow.
"Good morning!" Bellatrix came into the room and waved hello to everyone. Harry smiled at her, then noticed she had her wand tucked into her pocket. He found it odd, but let it slide. Maybe she was ready to defend them against an intruder or something.
Draco knocked softly. "You may come in" Harry said sounding like he thought he was royalty. It made Draco chuckle as he opened the door. "Miss me too much Malfoy?" Harry said smiling innocently. "Yeah right Potter" Draco smirked and rolled his eyes. Draco leaned against Harry's doorframe.
"Okay now all we need is Blaise" Harry turned back to Draco. Draco nodded and looked around. "Found him" Draco said. "Blaise" Draco half shouted. Blaise's head shot up and Harry motioned for him to come over. Blaise cautiously got up and walked over.
He opened the door to find a sleeping Harry thrashing wildly and crying. Harry had streams of tears running down his face. The blankets were thrown to the side, the sheets were all messed up. Harry was gripping onto the sheets so tightly his knuckles were about as white as Draco. Draco became very worried all of a sudden and ran over to Harry softly telling him to wake up. Harry arms shot up and wrapped around Draco. Harry was still very much asleep.
Harry smiled and nodded. "By the way I should probably tell you something." Draco looked down at Harry and moved a piece of hair off of his forehead revealing Harry's unique scar. "Alright what?"
"..Draco" Hermione opened the door and walked in with Ron. His head slowly lifted from Harry's bed to turn and look at the two of them. "You need to eat something. Go get some lunch" Ron said.
Harry stood there not moving, breathing, or doing anything. He saw a hand reach under the cloak and pull it off. Harry didn't want to see who he was in trouble with. He didn't want to see who had caught him.
"Goodbye Harry try not to miss me too much" Blaise said, rubbing it in Draco's face. "Bye handsome" Harry batted his eyelashes. Draco gritted his teeth. "Draco please escort Potter to the hospital wing" Snape said looking over at Draco. "Yes sir" Draco said taking Harry's arm and leading him away.
Harry's mouth was slightly agape and his emotions were all trying to flood him. The flood gates were trying to open. Harry took a deep shaky breath. "Good day Potter" Draco walked away from Harry. Draco wanted to look back and apologize. He didn't. He couldn't have Harry killed.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Shut up." Draco scoffed and got under the covers. He found it hard to sleep, hard to let his mind shut down. Draco knew what he was doing to Harry was wrong. Draco knew he could never give Harry a relationship, a true love. As of now Draco didn't care, he just loved the way he could relax Harry, or relieve him of his pain. He loved the way he could make Harry melt so easily.
"Yes yes let's go" Harry smiled and left the room in front of Draco. Draco was going to say something, but then smirked to himself because if Harry was in front he could watch him walk away.
"Fine." Draco walked up to the front of the hall to Snape. "I have reason to believe Blaise poisoned Harry." Draco looked up at Snape. "What? Why's that?" Snape said is his normal monotone. "All of a sudden Harry is...like in love with Zabini..see for yourself" Draco said gesturing towards Slytherin table.
Harry turned on the shower then undressed and laid his robes out on the counter. He stared at himself for a moment, absolutely hating what he saw. He saw bruises on his body, he could see his ribs. He saw all the times his family had hit him.
Everything felt good, too good. Draco had a bad feeling in the pit of his stomach, but he dropped it. He was going to enjoy this moment, for however long it would last.
Harry tried to push the thoughts out of his mind so he could actually get some rest. Harry just wished things were different, so different.
Snape nodded and walked out of the room swooshing his robes dramatically. Harry chuckled. "Does he do that every time?" Harry looked at Draco. Draco nodded and smiled. "I'm glad your back I really missed you" Draco held Harry's hand. "Me too." Harry smiled.
He heard the door open. Harry hoped it was Draco. He turned around and it was Zabini. "Leave me alone now." Harry said sternly. Blaise pulled out his wand and a vial. "We could do this the easy way or the hard way, your pick" Blaise said walking closer to him.
Flashes of different colored lights were flying around the room, the Christmas tree had been knocked down by this point.
Harry awoke at around 3:14 am. His arms were entangled around Draco who was sleeping soundly.  Harry's head felt heavy, his eyes felt watery. He barely remembered why he has woken up in the first place. A bad dream probably.
"Tell me when you're leaving from now on" Draco said getting up. "No. you. are. not. my. keeper" Harry said a little louder. Draco bit the inside of his cheek to keep himself from saying anything. He took a moment to look at Harry. Once he felt he had gotten a point across from just this look he got up and walked away to Slytherin table.
The music came to a halt and Draco pulled away and bowed. "Thank you for the lessons" Harry bowed as well. "Anytime" Draco smiled and re-wrapped his arm around Harry's waist. Harry was looking up at him.
"What are you on about? You really think I can just give up on you that easily?" Draco looked down at him getting slightly angry. Harry took a deep breath. "Draco. I'm nothing, I won't be able to keep you in this weird happiness for long. I have problems, I have insecurities. I have sadness and anger running through me at all times of every day." Harry sniffled.
"God why?" Harry looked up and rolled his eyes. "I'll go look." Draco said and got out of the shower. Harry sighed. Draco slid on the green robe that was in the bathroom closet. They had just gotten their bath robes a week prior, they hadn't even known they were going to get them. Draco put his wand in the pocket of the fluffy bathrobe.
Harry let out a deep sigh. Draco cleared his throat and began speaking. "About what I wanted to talk about earlier.."
Once he felt Harry relax he began slowly thrusting his hips. Harry's moans grew louder and louder the faster Draco went. Harry rolled his eyes back from pleasure. The pain only lasted a minute. Draco groaned. "Fuck you're so tight" He mumbled against Harry's lips.
Harry smiled and stood up, he began rubbing Draco's head to wash the shampoo out. Draco leaned his head back and moaned with pleasure, the head massage was much needed. "Look I've made you moan in multiple ways today" Harry smirked and finished washing out the shampoo. "Yes love you're right" Draco turned around and wrapped his arm around Harry's waist. The pulsating water hitting both of them.
"Oh Draco hello" Myrtle flew out of a stall and sat on a sink. "Yes hello Myrtle" Draco said politely. "You never visit me anymore I get so lonely" Myrtle floated over to Draco. "I'm sorry Myrtle" Draco looked at her.
"Well then I guess we should go get some good rest then right?" Draco looked down at Harry. Harry nodded. "I'll see the both of you tomorrow, sleep well" Narcissa waved and turned her attention back to Snape. Draco and harry exited the room and walked out into the hallway.
The bruises lightened and almost disappeared. Harry buttoned up his shirt and looked at Snape. "Thank you" Harry said softly. "You're welcome." Snape replied softer than usual.
Draco smirked mischievously. Harry raised one eyebrow. "Where?" Harry questioned him, his eyes burning into Draco's.
"Oh Harry" Draco whispered, he moved over to Harry and wrapped his arms around him. Draco rubbed Harry's arm softly. Harry let out a sigh. "Then it became a constant thing...he would do it just because..he does it just because. They would hit me, burn me. My cousin, Dudley, would always bring up how my parents d- died because of me" Harry sniffled and wiped his eyes.
It had been hard to have any sense of serenity or safety with Voldemort out for him.  With Voldemort out of the way Harry felt free. There was no big bad evil force out to kill him anymore. Knowing that he was safe lifted a very heavy weight off of his shoulders.
Draco slowly and softly placed his lips back on Harry's. Not with the same passion and fire that characterized their earlier kiss, but with tenderness and compassion. He got the same shock through his body. He smirked softly when he felt Harry kissing back.
All was calm until he heard a branch snap behind him. Harry stopped dead in his tracks and halted his breathing. Harry grabbed hold of his wand. He slowly turned around. "Lumos" He mumbled and a light sprouted from the end of his wand. He walked towards the sound he had heard.
Draco slowly and softly sucked down Harry's collarbone. He softly licked and bit at the skin. Harry would moan and arch his back slightly every now then. Draco held his waist delicately. Harry let his hands fall down to his sides. Harry couldn't help but think, this felt like more than 'enemies with benefits'.
Harry couldn't even begin to think that anything would happen because Draco made it clear, no feelings. Harry already had feelings, but he would continue to hide them just as he had for the past 4 years.
"Love." Draco lifted Harry's head and stared at him. Harry kissed Draco, Harry placed his soft lips to Draco's. Draco kissed back, his tears wetting Harry's cheeks. "It's okay, everything's okay. We're okay. I'm here" Draco said against Harry's lips. Harry nodded and wrapped his arms around Draco's neck. Draco held Harry so tightly, never wanting to let go again.
Harry felt his heart warm, Draco held Harry's hands at his sides. Draco kissed down to the next bruise. He didn't stop until he had kissed all of them. Mumbling sweet things in between soft kisses. Draco held Harry's hands and kissed back up to his lips. He placed a soft kiss on the corner of Harry's mouth.
Draco lead Harry to one of the beds and sat him down. Harry was looking around stupidly. He looks "Hello boys" Snape said walking in and dramatically waving his robes. "Potter lie down please." Snape pulled out his wand and began an examination to see if any potions were running in his blood stream.
"Yes a gay bottom" Harry let out a deep breath. Harry's lips were throbbing. He ran his index finger along his neck. "So I was right, I always am" Draco fixed his hair and smirked. "Oh shut up" Harry rolled his eyes. Draco just smirked and watched Harry's finger run along his own neck.
What if this person was secretly evil and plotting Harry's demise? What if this person acts like a friend just to betray him? What if this person just doesn't like Harry?
"Apologize? You? Blaise Zabini Apologize?" Draco scoffed and crossed his arms. "I feel terribly awful about what I did, it was low and underhanded. I don't even like Harry in that way. I just was so angry you had found someone...I let it overtake me." Blaise kept switching eye contact between Draco and Harry.
Harry hurriedly walked to the bathroom. Everything about that situation mads him uncomfortable. He really wished Draco had been there. Harry ruffled his hair and put his hands on the sink letting his head droop. The situation reminded him of his uncle. He wanted to breakdown and cry.
"I like the way your brain works Barty"  Bellatrix smirked as well. "Well I'll have a cheery time killing that little twit. The poor dark lord, may his soul rest in peace, would want us to do it." Barty said getting up. "We're going to make him so proud" Bellatrix smiled.
"So you two are spending Christmas together?" Ron wiggled his eyebrows and Harry laughed. "Yes we are and Ron please don't ever do that again" Harry smiled and wiped his eyes teary from laughter. Draco smiled as well. "Bye guys" Harry and Draco waved as they walked out of the hall behind the other students. They walked back up to the dorm and looked around for any last minute items. "I'm nervous but excited" Harry wiped the sweat from his hands.
Harry relaxed finally. Draco didn't understand what had just happened or why Harry had a blade, all he could think about was making Harry forget. Draco pulled away when he felt Harry relax and Harry began to speak."I- I'm sorry I was just-"
"Avada Keda-" Bellatrix began speaking and pointing her wand at Draco who was attempting to protect Harry. "No!" Harry yelled and jumped in front of Draco.
"We will be the hottest couple here tonight." Draco smirked and pulled out an all black suit. Harry pulled out another deep red one, a black tie. Draco an emerald green tie. "Yes we are definitely going to be on fire" Harry smirked and began putting his suit on.
Draco and Harry made their ways down to the massive dining room with the crystal chandelier hanging over the long dark wood table. Draco's aunt was already seated, she was wearing a long black dress.
"No ones ever loved me the way you described before." Harry sniffled and kissed Draco softly. "It's just how I feel in my heart about you love. My life would be incomplete without you" Draco kissed Harry's forehead.
"I'm just not hungry is all." Harry said somberly looking down at his plate. "But you haven't eaten since yesterday evening at the feast." Draco said looking at Harry. "I'm not hungry Malfoy." Harry said getting angry.
"Well...Potter as nice as this banter has been i should be going to my room" Draco shuddered at even having a slightly civil conversation with  Harry Potter "Yeah enjoy yourself Malfoy."
"Like him? Merlin I have the biggest knot in my stomach, I've been crying for the last two hours, and I can barely focus on anything. He's the only bloody thing running through my mind." Draco clenched his fist as he slowly got more and more worked up over what his father had done.
They hugged him tightly before letting go, letting him walk up to the box where his lifeless love laid. Draco began walking up to his casket. He began walking up to see the man who was so full of life, dead.
Just looking in each other's eyes with no hatred just a low burning passion and yearning for the first time in his life.
If you're reading this that means the worst has happened. I'm writing this while you're in the shower. I can hear you singing. It's soothing yet so damn funny. Things have been too perfect lately, I just keep anticipating something going wrong. The thoughts in my brain aren't good ones. All I can think about is the worst. Draco, you mean the whole world to me, you are my light, my reason to live. You saved me. You are the other half of me and I'm sorry it took me so long to realize it. I know that I'm dead considering you're reading this. I want you to know I love you with every bone in my body. I love you so much and you deserve every single ounce of it. Please Draco, go to Paris. Go see the Eiffel Tower. Think of me while you're doing it. Do it for me. Buy the Manor on the countryside. Remember you're so fucking amazing. I don't want you to stop living just because I have. I hope you can feel my love radiating through this. Haha maybe you can wouldn't that be amazing if you could. I'm sorry that was off topic. I love you. I hope you don't ever have to read this. If you do, I love you. Stay safe Dray, don't ever forget me.
Harry let out a shaky sigh, and looked down at his wrists. Draco swallowed thickly and let a  tear fall down his cheeks as well.  Harry was embarrassed he was so weak, so weak he couldn't even control himself. Draco took Harry's wrist, lifted it to his face and slowly kissed the cuts.
Bellatrix got up and walked to him, he grabbed her by the waist and they shared a very unnecessary sloppy kiss. Draco and Harry cringed and looked away. Narcissa was shell shocked, just standing in one place, frozen.
He held the sweatshirt and tried to pretend Draco was with him, holding him. It eventually worked because Harry did fall asleep. The worst reason to be asleep was to numb pain. Harry had done it too many times.
He took in a deep breath of cool soothing air and rolled up his sleeve. Harry saw the newest one sitting on his wrist so daintily. It hurt his soul, it hurt Harry's soul to know he was weak. No matter how hard Harry had hoped it would've stopped by now it didn't. It hadn't stopped and he didn't know when it would. Once Draco came into his life for real, Harry hoped he could help stop it. Draco did help stop it for a while there, but Harry let his mind become consumed again.
Draco smiled a little. "I'm glad he chose me too" Draco stared down at Harry. "If he wakes up come get me. I'm going to eat quick I promise"
Snape chuckled and wrote a note on a piece of parchment. It read 'McGonagall you owe me 10 galleons' Snape watched the boys leave and sat down at his desk taking in the information he had just found out. Harry needed help, Draco cared for Harry therefore Snape also cared for Harry.
"Blah blah blah" Bellatrix rolled her eyes and laughed hysterically. "What's so funny?" Harry asked her. "Nothing, nothing at all" She smiled.
Draco was watching Harry so intently, so intrigued at how this shy boy could be so daring. Draco bit his lip, slowly feeling himself harden. Harry was looking up at him innocently yet mischievously. Draco felt slightly bad, or guilty. He felt as if he had forced Harry to do this, even though he hadn't. "Harry..." Draco managed a whisper. "You don't have to..you know" Draco mumbled. "I know I don't, i want to." Harry smirked.
"Happy Christmas Mum!" Draco walked over to her and leaned down to hug her. Harry hugged her as well. "Happy Christmas Narcissa" Harry pulled away and sat on one of the arm chairs.
It was dark out, meaning it was late. Harry had wondered how long he was out for. "Have a good rest of your night boys" She nodded and dismissed them. They walked back to their dorm.
Harry tried to look at Draco's eyes but couldn't. "I'm not nervous.." Harry bit his tongue. "Really so.." Draco moved closer to him "This doesn't bother you then right?" Draco was just as nervous as Harry was.
"Harry!" Ron smiled and drank some of his pumpkin juice. "Hey Harry" Hermione smiled as well. "I've missed you two" Harry said and made himself a plate. "We've missed you too, you're back in classes today right?" Ron asked.
"Neville can make it" Harry smiled. "Ron and Hermione can too" Draco said throwing the envelope to the side. He opened the third one. "Blaise can as well" Draco smiled. "Looks like we're set." Harry said. "Good. Well then what are we going to prepare for dinner." Harry rolled over onto his elbows. "We could make a chicken meal? or a steak dinner?" Draco said throwing out ideas.
"I didn't..I uh didn't out you" Ginny stuttered and her eyes began to flick through each one of the people standing in front of her. They went from Harry to Draco to Hermione to Ron. "You're stuttering, you're lying" Ron said as he wrapped his arm around Hermione.
Draco started to panic. He opened the door to the study, it was empty. His heart rate quickened. He thought someone had taken Harry. He shouldn't have cared as much as he did. Draco went to the bathroom and opened the door slowly. His eyes fell to the floor. He saw Harry sleeping peacefully on the bathroom floor. His foot was jammed up against the cabinet, that must've been the bang.
"Draco" Harry smiled. Draco hadn't heard him. He continued arguing with his father. "You took him for what?!" Draco yelled.
Harry looked up at him smiling. "I'll miss you too" Harry kissed his nose. Draco chuckled. Harry turned his attention back down to the book. Draco began reading aloud. They sat and read. Almost finished the book from the amount of time they spent out there. Draco would stop reading every now and then to call for some food from a house elf. "I have to leave in about an hour" Harry spoke up interrupting Draco.
Snape, Lupin, and Draco followed him in. His old home was huge, it had so many doors and pathways. Harry could be anywhere. Yet Draco knew his father would throw him in the dungeon. Draco's father was cruel and malicious, but rather dumb. "This way." Draco said and lead them towards a sort of main room that everything was set around.
It was around 7 a.m. when Harry awoke again. He wasn't fully aware of his new surroundings, it took him a little to adjust to the new room he was in. The sun had barely started rising yet. He suddenly felt alarmed when he realized he was snuggled up to someone. A strong scent of vanilla flowed into Harry's nose.
Draco scoffed and sat on his broomstick looking up at the sky. "You ever wonder where you'll be in 10 years?" Harry said softly. "All the time" Draco responded solemnly. Draco was pretty sure he wasn't going to make it past the next 1 year. Harry was also sure of the same thing. Draco's life wasn't as bad as Harry's, but it was most definitely not perfect.
Draco closed the door and re locked it. "Well that was actually enjoyable." Draco chuckled and walked back into the living room. Harry followed and agreed.
Draco's heart dropped at those two words Harry said. He let out a shaky breath, trying to keep his composure for Harry. Harry shook in his arms and sucked in deep hard breaths. Draco held him tighter than he'd ever held anything or anyone. Harry slowly calmed down, he sniffled and hiccuped a few times. Draco inhaled deeply and exhaled slowly, trying to calm himself down.
"School has been utter rubbish, it's so boring this year" Harry chuckled light heartedly. Draco smiled over at Harry because Draco could tell Harry was trying. "I completely understand that. And that rubbish headmaster of yours probably doesn't help" Bellatrix said.
"If it's any help I don't hate you. Zabini means nothing, he's a moron a bloody moron, you're still one of the most respected people here at Hogwarts" Harry offered a smile up at Draco. Draco felt a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. He looked around the empty bathroom.
Harry got up to see who it was. Malfoy, Draco Malfoy. "Always a pleasure Malfoy" He rolled his eyes and walked away. Harry was not going to put up with Draco's shenanigans this year.
"Please" Harry said in a slight whisper. Draco began to palm Harry through his underwear. Harry moaned with much satisfaction.
"Continue seeing some boy and I will have your head on my wall, you pathetic loser" His uncle grabbed him by the hair and lifted him off of the couch. Harry whimpered and let a few tears fall. "Now go do the dishes" His uncle said and threw him onto the kitchen floor. Harry clutched his side. Bruises, more bruises. "On with it then" Vernon kicked him. Harry feebly got up and grabbed onto the counter for support.
"Everything feels so right" Harry said into Draco's chest. "Everything is so right" Draco smiled and kissed Harry's head. "I just can't shake the feeling that something is going to go wrong" Harry sighed. "Love stop worrying, everything is fine" Draco said reassuringly.
Hermione and Ron smiled. "We'll be on our way" Ron knew when to leave, and now was that time. He took Hermione and left.
"Okay we'll see you at lunch Harry, bye" Ron and Hermione said bye at the same time. They really were soulmates Harry smiled.  Ron and Hermione walked in the opposite direction Harry was. Harry was going to sit in the library and think. He made his way to the back of the library and found a place to sit.
Hogwarts was his escape from all of that ugliness in his so called home. Harry was forever grateful for his home away from home and the people who befriended him. The people who befriended him became his family. They were more of a family than his had ever been, that's for sure.
"Really cause you're rather pale" Ron said. Draco smirked and removed his hand from Harry's thigh. "Well I should be getting back to my Slytherin, dinner will be concluding soon" Draco said getting up and leaving. Harry's breathing was unsteady and he longed to be touched again.
"By the way Mr. Zabini the potion you used is temporary should wear off within the next 10 minutes" Snape patted his shoulder and walked out into the hallway making his way to the hospital wing. Draco had led Harry there, listening to him ramble on about how great Blaise was.
His two best friends came in the room with two steaming hot plates of food. They smiled "Harry!" They walked over to him and sat the food down. "You did this?" Harry looked at Draco smiling softly. Draco mouthed "of course" Draco smiled. Harry's smile brightened.
Harry hit his arm. Hermione swooned over their flirting. Even if it was odd it was still flirting. She loved seeing Harry happy. As did Ron. Although he didn't swoon. "Take notes for me in class today Hermione?" Harry looked at her.
Harry began crying silently, he thought he had put this all behind him. Harry's mind could not even begin to focus on one thing, so much was running through it. His tears wetting his cheeks.
The rest of the gifts really weren't mentioning, just funny little things. Gifts lining up with inside jokes between Harry and Hermione and Ron. They had gotten the others small cute things. Everyone had finally finished opening their gifts and saying their thank you's.
Harry just stared down at the words written on the parchment. Draco was just going to back down, not even try and find a way around it. Harry realized he clearly wasn't as important to Draco as he thought he was. Draco's wretched father was probably going to have Harry killed anyway. Harry figured it'd be better if he was just gone. His family wouldn't have to put up with him, all the pain from his uncle, would just disappear.
"You're not ugly" Draco kissed down his neck. He softly laid Harry back down. He unbuttoned the buttons Harry had managed to clasp. It's was just the bottom three. Harry went to stop Draco, but didn't . "Is this alright?" Draco looked at Harry. Harry nodded.
"We can go up with you if you want?" Hermione rubbed Draco's shoulder comfortingly. Ron nodded and looked at him. "No I need to do this myself, but thank you" Draco sniffled.
Harry grabbed a piece of parchment and wrote a letter asking if he could skip today. He sent Hedwig off with it. Harry made his way into his own room. He removed his shoes and robes.
Hermione hugged Harry as well. "I'll see you around. Be safe ok?" She said as she smiled and walked out the door. Harry closed the door once they were gone, and locked it.
Draco was overwhelmingly sad. He didn't want anything to happen to Harry. Draco knew Harry was strong but not that strong.
"Enough of the sappy shit let's get this over with" Barty started throwing spells at the two of them. Draco made sure to keep Harry behind him, since Harry was the big prize.
Harry sniffled and wiped his eyes. "I'm sorry" Harry said softly and tried to blink back the rest of his tears that were trying to fall down his face. "Don't apologize to me." Draco said. Harry thought he was angry. Harry heard what sounded like edgy coldness in Draco's voice, he might've been imagining it or it was really how he said it.
"Alright Potter" Draco said getting up as well. "I'll be off to bed as well, try not to sleep in the bathroom tonight" Draco chuckled. Harry rolled his eyes and turned away walking to his bedroom. He looked back to see Draco staring. Draco's eyes flickered back up to Harry's.
"If you don't mind, don't scare me anymore with your appearances in my bedroom. It's odd and quite nerve wracking to know you're probably just watching me sleep." Draco huffed. "Why in the bloody hell would I want to watch you sleep?" Harry rubbed his eyes. "And where are my glasses?" Harry felt his eyes once more to make sure his glasses weren't on his face.
Draco narrowed his eyes and made a rude gesture with his hand. Harry rolled his eyes and turned back to his friends. Draco continued walking.
"He knows." Harry said quietly. "What?" Draco was now extremely confused. "He knows what they do to me, he doesn't try to stop it or help, he tells me to stick it out" Draco felt anger boiling in him. "He knows?!" Draco said getting up and running a hand through his hair.
"A favor? Are you crazy? You poisoned him pyscho." Draco got defensive once more. He put on a very tough exterior when he got defensive.
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry and smiled. He opened his book and began reading as Harry fell asleep in his arms. Draco let out a breath of satisfaction. This was Draco's dream scenario. Something he had always wished for.
He wrapped his free arm around Harry's waist. Harry smiled. "Open" Draco said. Narcissa opened her eyes to and was met with the cute eyes of an adorable puppy staring back at her. "Oh boys" She smiled and took the puppy from Draco's arms. "We knew it would get quiet around the house without us, so we got you something to liven it up" Harry reached out and pet the dog. "Thank you." Narcissa hugged them again, but was careful not to crush the dog.
"What's this for?" Draco said lowly into Harry's ear. "Thank you, for everything" Harry said into Draco's neck where he had buried his face. Draco smiled and hugged Harry tightly. "You're welcome" Draco said softly. "I'm sorry how things are for you" Draco whispered.
Harry slowly sat up and looked at Draco. Harry smiled softly and leaned in to kiss Draco's cheek. Draco blushed, more than he had when they were making out. Draco smiled and placed his hand on Harry's cheek. "Are you alright now?" Draco said softly, no edge, no anger.
Draco was cut off by Harry smashing his lips up onto Draco's. Harry's hand moved from Draco's shoulder to the nape of his neck. Draco took a moment to adjust, once he did he quickly had his arms around Harry's waist.
"Merlin I slept that long?" Harry said getting up out of bed running a hand through his raven hair. "Yeah and? what's the big deal it's not like we have classes to attend." Draco snorted "But we missed breakfast." Harry said sadly looking at Draco. "That's okay I can call a house elf to bring us some food does that sound good enough for you Golden boy?" Harry nodded "Yes that will do"
Draco tilted Harry's face upwards. "You're strong Harry, you're a strong amazing person. You can do this I know you can I believe in you" Draco leaned down and kissed Harry. Harry kissed back. Harry felt Draco's soft lips against his own. It made his heart warm. They pulled away and sighed. Harry got up and grabbed his trunk. Draco went to the portrait and opened it. To his surprise it was Snape.
"Is he..well you know.." Blaise was very timid, scared of Harry's answer. "Yes very much he is" Harry held Draco's hand. Harry was excited for Blaise, maybe Blaise would find something like Harry and Draco did.
Draco didn't know what was holding him back. Although the little voice in his head did. It hissed at him "You're not good enough for Harry, you never will be" Draco winced at hearing these things from his own subconscious. "He will never love you" It hissed.
And Harry would listen forever if Draco so wanted, caught in the thrill of the night and ready to stay in it for the rest of time. Draco comes
in the night, pure and sweet and genuine. It is as if he trusts the dark to hold his masks for him; in the moon and its shadows, Draco can be himself. Harry loves Draco best when he looks like he knows he's safe.
He looks at Draco now, and what he sees is so different from what he used to see. He faintly remembers what he'd see in Draco in the beginning—panic and fear, fire licking from all sides and running to catch up, to consume him, to consume them. Seeing Draco's white-blond hair shining in the sunlight reminded him of it slicked down front with sweat, Draco's raw voice screaming, "Go faster, Potter!" in his ear.
Draco doesn't respond for a few seconds, staring straight ahead with his hands in his pockets. A tiny curve of his lips, however, tells Harry that he isn't so lost in thought that he hadn't heard him.
Harry's noticed that Draco loves observing and analysing complexities up close, and the constellations are no exception. To Draco, the stars are simple, but no less complex in their beauty. Even after a year of owning his telescope, the pleasure of seeing the universe through this muted, contrasting perspective hasn't worn off in its novelty.
Harry smiles, focused more on Draco's voice than his observance of the star, Sirius. It's the brightest ball of energy he can see, even through the close-up of the lens, shaded in white-blue and pulsing with power. As bright as it is, though, Harry thinks that Draco shines brighter. He always does.
It is a chilly night. Draco hates the cold, but he hates the nightmares more. It isn't unusual for Harry to find him out in the open with the telescope once every few nights, and even though the frequency of the nightmares has dulled over time with Harry's presence, he hadn't hesitated to fetch a thick blanket and stumble out the back porch when he woke up a few minutes ago and found the bed empty and the sheets beside him stained damp.
"I always do, and I always will," Harry responds with a chuckle, not deigning to veer from their standard exchange. It's a beautiful night, too beautiful to chance at variance. Their routine is set, and their nights always end the same way.
Draco's lips broaden into a smile, jaw set loosely, and he gestures at Harry for emphasis with his chin. "You look like you're thinking about something important."
No, what he sees now is so much better. He looks at soft pink lips and wind-reddened skin, and he sees Draco whispering,
"C'mon, tell me," Harry adds, nudging his elbow softly into Draco's side. Draco turns to smile at him, and Harry feels his breath catch at the way the moonlight makes those grey eyes sparkle. It's been a while since he got to see the sight.
Draco is hunched over the telescope he has set up for himself, and he's gazing intently into the viewfinder of the Muggle device, his face earnest and relaxed.
It's somehow more comforting than the nights both of them get to sleep without disturbance; the world outside feels twice as magical under the light of the moon, and it's almost worth the moments previous of being roused by fear.
Draco's eyes flutter, stunned. "I… That was not what I expected," he says at length, but his eyes never leave Harry. They look like they're filled with disbelief. Harry doesn't see hesitance, however, and it brings him hope.
Even now, Draco beckons to him with his soft gaze, his eyes questioning and curious. His contemplation must be written bare in the lines of his face, Harry realises with a little laugh. It's just like Draco to pick up on it; he's more surprised that the blond found it within himself to tear his eyes away from his constellations and galaxies to level the question at all.
The stiff breeze in the air fully wakens him from the foggy remnants of sleep, but he cannot bring himself to grumble when faced with the sight of the lean blond's handsome profile. He lets his feet guide him as he walks over to Draco, taking in with a small, smug smile the oversized maroon jumper—
Draco splutters. "Did I—of course I found it, it's the brightest star in the sky!" Harry cannot contain his snickering at the intensity of the offence Draco takes at his teasing. "I am very capable at Astronomy, Potter, and it is an
It's been two years and three months of knowing each other as more than enemies, going from reluctant acquaintances to indifferent companionship to friends, to bed-partners to secret dalliances to building and holding the solid relationship they have now. It took sweat and tears and confusion and heartbreak, but Harry no longer sees fire and fear when he looks at Draco.
Harry is the one who bought him the Muggle telescope, a birthday present and six-month anniversary present rolled into one—because Draco, the old Draco of a year ago, would have never accepted an anniversary gift without plenty of scoffing and put-upon smarminess—but Draco was the one who taught himself to use it.
Harry and Draco are variances to the other, their personalities criss-crossed through years of shared life experience and months upon months of knowing and caring for each other. Draco loves the sky, Harry looks to earth. Draco prefers complexity, Harry is drawn to simplicity. Draco is precise, Harry is chaos. Draco thrives at night, Harry in the daylight. But drawn together, they've learned to compromise and take on parts of each other's personality. At some point in their year and a half of proper dating, they stopped giving each other space to do their own thing and started to fill the empty spaces with adaptation and understanding.
"Stop, stop!" Harry tries to push him away, successfully making Draco chuckle as well. "Right, yes, you told me the story. He could catch any prey he was made to chase, yeah?"
They stay silent in each other's company, soft and intimate out in the windy stillness for a couple of hours till they pack up and head back into the warmth of their home. An hour or two from now, they will curl up around each other and fall asleep again, never to wake up till morning. And Harry will feel safe with Draco by his side, just as Draco does when he's near Harry.
It's not much different from the magical version they all had and used for Astronomy class, but there are variances. None more than the comparative stillness of what can be seen through the viewfinder of the Muggle telescope; the magical one fills the lens with informative shapes and fancy patterns and runes, swathes of colours highlighting sections of the planets and stars to show their movements and energies. It's all very bright and kinetic and beautiful, filled with the chaotic energy that Harry has come to associate with wizard culture. The Muggle telescope has none of that.
He turns around, his eyes straining in the dark, craving the sight of blond hair and sharp angles. Moonlight brightens his path, bathing the object of his desire in soft hues of silvery white. It makes Draco's white-blond hair shimmer, and enhances the cut of his jawline.
It has taken a long time for them to get to where they are. Long before they started officially dating, they were something more perplexing and terrifying and reckless. Harry remembers a day out in solace, roaming the markets of Diagon Alley before he came to the new potions shop that had opened up. He remembers going in, that inexplicable rejection he felt when the Draco Malfoy he spotted behind the counter looked tired and sleep-deprived and angry, and still wouldn't look him in the eyes. It was the stubbornness he felt after that made him go back. They were two lost souls looking for redemption, he had realised, and one soul had found it much harder to find than the other.
He knows how the rest of the night will go. He knows that less than an hour from now, Draco will feel the chill too much to stay outside, and Harry will coax and corral him back into the house. Draco will lug in the telescope, and Harry will take care of the tripod stand. Draco will have packed his telescope in his equally precious case when Harry enters the house, and together, they will have a fire going in the living room. Curl up together on the couch to warm up, with the blanket thrown over their legs, chatting and murmuring to each other till one of them is a breath away from the call of sleep. Usually, it's Draco—and then Harry will nudge them both up to bed and fall into the mattress, tugging the covers over them till they are toasty warm and ready to sleep the rest of the night away.
change where it may be called for, and there's something that's been on his mind that he feels he may find an even better result tonight, should he speak aloud of this variance.
"Canis Major today?" he asks, and he doesn't need to turn back to know that Draco looks proud. There is that quiet pride every time Harry correctly guesses a constellation, never mind that he had taken Astronomy at Hogwarts for five years. A part of it, he supposes, he can attribute to the fact that he was abysmal at the subject.
Harry barked out a laugh as he went looking for aprons. He found them in a tall cupboard next to the fridge and picked out a plain red one for himself. “Have you always been this melodramatic? Wow.”
“Merlin, ‘Mione, pull yourself together. It’s just a cloak, it’s not like he sacrificed his first born or did blood magic or anything!”
Malfoy practically spat the last word, seemingly ashamed to show any weakness despite the color rising in his cheeks.
Harry had never been more grateful for the Marauder’s Map. Just as he had used it to observe Malfoy in sixth year, he used it to avoid him now. He barged into each class just as each professor began instruction, and sat sandwiched between Ron and Hermione. As each class ended, he ran out the door and down the hall as fast as he could. Food was swiped from the kitchens (though it wasn’t swiping so much as regularly enjoying tea with the house elves), and all owls or other attempts at communication were thoroughly ignored. Harry felt practically invincible! Enveloped in invisibility as he always was, there was no possible way for Malfoy to catch him.
“I think Malfoy’s up to something,” Harry insisted, his eyes glued to the Slytherin table and aiming for his mouth with the muffin he held. He failed, of course.
“Oi, Malfoy! I need your potions analysis for the Kemperton case--oh. Didn’t realize you had company. ‘Lo, Parkinson.” Pansy Parkinson sat perched on the edge of Malfoy’s ostentatious desk, one long dark lock twined around her finger. Ron assumed she’d popped over for lunch with Malfoy; her work at Witch Weekly didn’t usually bring her to the Ministry. Merlin, her legs seemed to go on for days. Ron remained trapped in the intricate pattern of her lacy stockings until he remembered where he was, jerking his face back up to Malfoy’s. He was as pointy and well-groomed as ever, and somehow not distracted by Parkinson’s legs at all.
She laughed, a bright, tinkling thing. “Darling, you know you love being one of my drunken monkeys.” She glanced back toward Ron, still standing frozen in the doorway. “And so will Weasley. Take your report and go, then; we’ll see you tonight.”
their cocks were touching. Instinct told Harry to roll his hips, so he did, gasping at the sensation of the two of them sliding together. He glanced up and drank in feral adoration from Draco’s face as he thrust back.
Rather than trying to boast about his family’s wealth, as the old Malfoy would have done, this Malfoy just sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Not again.” He turned to the wall and scolded, “This is meant to be an exit, not a display case, and you
Hermione’s eyes were full of pity and uncertainty. “I don’t know. You seemed very happy together, but he may have been just trying to get close to you because you’re his mate. Not because you’re Harry. There’s not a lot on the subject in the Hogwarts library, but creature mates are terribly complex. It’s similar to marriage bonds after the mate bond is complete. In the meantime, his creature instincts naturally draw him to you. As Malfoy’s mate, you are supposedly the only person able to make him happy, and mates are supposed to spend the rest of their lives together.”
Harry worried his bottom lip between his teeth. “Probably not even that long, honestly. I don't quite know what I'd do with myself."
The second of Harry’s observations was the hair: or, more like, the lack thereof. Malfoy’s hair at Harry’s last visit had been a shining curtain of thick white-blond silk, practically begging to be brushed through or wound around one’s fist. All of that lovely long hair was gone, sheared off since Harry’s last visit. Now it was shaved short on the sides, and the longer hair on top was swept artfully to one side. Maybe his new haircut was why Malfoy was upset?
Hermione, entirely unruffled, only raised a hand. “It’s usually not, but I haven’t finished. That’s not all. While I was in the library, I also researched the Malfoys. It’s mainly old lore, far too old to be trustworthy, but--well, Harry, there’s something you need to know about their family.” She pulled one of the tomes from the pile, flipping through it until she found the correct page.
So began the longest summer of Draco Malfoy’s life. He occupied himself with outfitting a luxurious new wardrobe (since he’d completely outgrown the old one), plotting how to restore the grandeur of the Malfoy family name, and practicing glamours to hide his creature markings. It seemed like years later that Draco swept into the Great Hall as he usually had, head held high and cronies close behind. As he always did now upon entering a room, he sifted through the scents around him. The scents of other creatures stood out from the rest, but the scent that meant
“Course, love,” Draco muttered. His jaw seemed tight, and he chugged the first half of his pint a bit quickly, but he soon loosened up nicely.
Draco frowned. That had been unexpected. Obviously something still wasn’t working, but he had no clue. Perhaps it was the marketing that needed to be changed? Yes, that was certainly the problem this time!
Harry didn’t know where to put his hands, and he had no clue where he ought to look. Malfoy settled one of Harry’s hands on his (suspiciously broad) shoulder, and took the other in his own. “Do you remember how to waltz, Potter?”
“My, Potter, you certainly have filled out since school. I suppose puberty finally caught up with you. You’re going to need many more items of clothing. Perhaps a whole new wardrobe.” One hand drifted over Harry’s nipple as Malfoy slipped the measuring tape to his waist and again drew it tight.
Draco pursed his lips and spoke very, very slowly. "Let me see if I understand you correctly. You would like to know what I, your formerly secret lover--"
Malfoy beamed in his direction, holding out one hand to grasp his. "There you are, Harry! I've been waiting for you."
“We’ve only two weeks until exams! Shouldn’t you be studying for NEWTS?” a perplexed Hermione asked. Scarlet and indigo and chartreuse inks smeared the hands clutching the study schedule she’d made for Harry. (It was entirely unused.)
He looked unearthly and beautiful in the half-light of the closed store as he slowly approached Harry.
Draco sauntered back to the manager’s office, practically bursting with good humor. It was shaping up to be a wonderful day.
Harry groaned in frustration and chucked another rock into the lake. It was an idyllic Saturday, probably one of the last they’d have that year, and the giant squid was playing fetch with some third years a few hundred yards away. They were levitating large sticks into the water, and colossal suckered tentacles were gently tossing them back onto shore.
The walk had been very warm, so Harry stopped to catch his breath and admire the house. Rather than being dark and imposing, the whole place seemed to exude light. Cream-colored walls welcomed Harry in, and rounded towers that begged him to come up and explore.
He reluctantly reached inside the bag. The enormous gem he lifted out of the pouch was similar in size to a Quaffle, yet far more captivating in its complexity. Shimmering flames in every shade of orange and crimson licked at the gem’s center, but the outside was as cool and slippery as could be.
“Hmm...you smell like baking and, y’know, lightning. Like the sky just before a storm. And then my smell is more fresh and woodsy and deep. The two scents together...well, it’s
Awe softened Malfoy’s pointy face as followed Harry and stared out at the vast Quidditch pitch. “Well. This certainly wasn’t previously part of the manor. I may have to see about having one installed, it’s fantastic.” He was too entranced to notice the door behind him disappearing with a faint
"Where's Teddy?" Draco asked when he finally pulled away from the kiss. His mood already felt better with Harry's arm around him.
“Harry was just telling me how busy he was after lazing about in Mungos for so long. You would never cheat on Serendipity, right?” Malfoy asked him.
"Like I've said, you were obsessed–" Ron broke off with an appreciative moan at the strawberry trifle, "–with Cedric and Malfoy!"
Harry nodded quickly. Draco had confided previously that his mother was being shunned by her previous circle of high-society wives and she was taking the rejection poorly, working obsessively to salvage the ruined Manor. He knew that Draco was eager to spend time with her, but Harry couldn’t control his desire to see him over the long break.
Harry cursed when the Portkey threw him onto his bad leg. Startling when he bumped into a sunflower, Harry felt his shoulders loosen as he took in his surroundings. The bed and breakfast in the distance was exactly as advertised, a quaint and homely property with a large veranda that had called out to him from Hermione’s brochure.
"No, I'm not. There's no dress code for staff. I've read the handbook thrice." And so he had—in between the sleepless nights, more awake than excited, he had reviewed his lesson plans and read everything relevant to calm his nerves. He had also learnt finally that
Draco closed his eyes as he sighed to himself. It verged on impossibility to not think mean things about the entrance of his new common room.
Draco scoffed. "I've forgotten that dating a Gryffindor has addled your brains." He looked around the table helplessly for support, only to find none. "Harry, your friends have lost their minds."
"Why can't it be? Why does it have to-" he trailed off as the upset took over him and he cried harder against Narcissa.
"Have you checked it?" Malfoy demanded as he sent a series of spells to the present, ones more complicated than Hermione's.
Harry watched a series of emotions flit through Draco's face–confusion, amusement, anger, frustration, resignation, forced nonchalance, and then bitterness.  "You better be giving it to me for Christmas," he said with a sulk as he snatched his mousse up huffily.
"It's funny how she showed it," Harry said as he thought about the cruel comments Parkinson had made about Hermione previously.
"I do love you more than the calendar-you in my head," he said seriously, hoping that Harry would understand what he meant. "You're more than the boy from school and the Quidditch player on the wireless," he continued, honesty falling from his lips without forethought. He was first in love with insufferable Gryffindor that would right everything, the godfather that played blocks with Teddy through his "Smash Teddy" phase, the seeker that flew with a crazed, single minded purpose, and the man that oozed careless sex appeal in front of the camera, but he was now in love with the Harry Potter that couldn't wake up in the mornings and wore clothes to bed because he was worried about sagging balls.
Draco swatted Harry's hand away even while he ducked to press his face into Harry's shoulder. He wiped his face discreetly into Harry's shirt. "You could have told me earlier," he grumbled as he pinched Harry's in the waist. "We could have skipped everything. Are we properly together now?"
Draco froze at the flash of fancy. His mind was no longer his, desperate to act on his basic instincts to claim Harry.
"Apparently not, unless you're the one jingling it," Zabini commented, taking advantage of Malfoy's affrontment to tug at the strings violently. The both of them collapsed into a tussle as Malfoy lunged for Zabini.
"I feel like I spent my time mediating between Ron and Hermione, and thinking about surviving when I was in Gryffindor," Potter suddenly commented.
Harry blinked, unable to deny the request, much less when Draco looked so pathetic. He settled down in the cramped bed, biting his lip when Draco pulled him closer. His body was responding in excitement to the proximity, but it was such an inappropriate moment.
"I probably would if it hit my bottom," Harry said playfully as he released his grip, laughing at the dirty look Draco gave him when he almost fell backwards.
Draco smiled at his companion, an unexpected warmth spreading from his heart. He tucked his fringe behind his ear with a faux air of casualness. "Of course we are. I possess the maturity to befriend my childhood nemesis."
Draco reminded himself to breathe as he watched his reflection at the window of the bus unhappily, desperately wishing for the umpteenth time since sixth year that he could switch lives with anyone else. Maybe the Asian woman beside him, or any of the young Australian tourists laughing loudly at the front. Life would be so much simpler if so, he clenched his fists on his lap. He wouldn't be alone though, he reminded himself. Pansy, Blaise, and Greg had promised to meet at the train station so they could enter Platform Nine 3/4 together, a gesture that Draco appreciated greatly.
Harry could only shrug in reply. Trying to find himself through work would have been better than trying to find his soulmate through work. It was the largest mistake in his life—that he had been searching for his soulmate instead of himself. He wondered if the regret was obvious, that he had nothing to show unlike Malfoy's easy confidence and casual effusiveness. Malfoy had cast away the burdens of the past, whereas his own had weighed him down for the longest time.
"Yeah! So Hermione gave me a cookbook on Indian cuisine and I'm halfway through that. It's taking me a while because of work, and needing to cook everything I see, you know?" Potter's eyes were shining as he gestured excitedly. "And I'm pretty good at it, honestly. I even bring it to the Weasleys. It sticks out a bit with the English fare, but it's great."
Harry's smile was mischievous. He tucked his hands into his front pockets as he rocked on the balls of his feet. His satisfaction at leaving Draco speechless was obvious. "Well, you value sleep too much to stay up late, but when you do, you're usually tired and frustrated, which is a strange combination. Then I eavesdropped on your conversation with Theo—" He shrugged.
"I've been dabbling a little. It's been a while since I've had so much time on hand, you know?" She looked at Draco who smiled at her encouragingly. She had mentioned picking up baking materials in her letters, but he hadn't been aware that there was an
"I didn't mean that. I asked because I was evicted on a half day’s notice in Cairo." Harry explained desperately as he tugged at Draco's folded arms. "I didn't have much to pack, but I was homeless for three days."
"I–" Potter attempted to defend himself. "You're making an assumption! I could have been looking at the clothes too!"
Suddenly registering Harry’s hardness against him, Draco felt distinctly light-headed. He wanted to push Harry to his knees, he wanted Harry to kiss him, he wanted to touch Harry's cock. “Please,” he begged, his voice broken as he rutted against Harry.
"Just only one. I didn't have a lot," Teddy said seriously as he wiped his hand on Draco's lapel. Worry made a noise at the statement, ears flopping as he shook his head at them violently.
It was dark by the time they pulled up at Hogsmeade station, and Draco was disoriented from the nap that had crept up on him. Fumbling with his tie as he alighted the train, Draco trailed closely after Blaise with his head down.
Draco’s stomach clenched at the power in his hands. If the war had taught him anything, it was that as the line of Malfoys before him, he could not be trusted with power. His greed was too much. His hands were shaking as he swept the arrows into the bag, pausing when he noticed its stiffness.
"I don't like to use the childcare spell and I'm usually able to catch him, but the hallways had too many people and floating items," Potter defended desperately. Teddy broke free from their hands as they arrived at an apparition point near their destination, gasping as he hopped dramatically to avoid the crack lines on the pavement.
“It’s okay. I sometimes forget who I’m speaking to,” Malfoy apologised as he closed his office door.
“It’s okay, it’s okay” he repeated, petting Draco’s hair when the boy continued to blubber into the curve of his neck. Harry’s mind was spinning over the developments that had led to this point. Had the note in his present set Draco off? Or was it Harry’s overdone present? Did Draco suddenly think about what Pansy had made them do during the party?
kick out of insulting me so I'm giving you the last chance to get it all out before Hogwarts opens. Do return if you have a few hours one day to go shopping for work clothes with me.
"Yeah. It did," Harry said as he sipped his tea carefully. It was strange to have his and Malfoy’s childhood antics validated by Mrs. Malfoy, no less, and it was hard to control the urge to complain about every slight her son had committed against his being.
He had then let slip during dinner with the Slytherins that Malfoy had received the ugliest jumper he had ever seen, and everything had fallen into place afterwards. With an ugly sweater in compliance with the dress code, Draco no longer had any reason to skip the Eighth Year's Mid-week Party. Organised by the Gryffindors, it was the first party of the year, and almost all of the returning eighth years had turned up.
Draco hummed in understanding. His cousin had talked about her plans to visit the Kalimantan rainforest during the year end break, and perhaps there was no one better than her who could understand his desire for the unfamiliar.
Potter huffed before opening his book for the ingredient list. They worked together fine, Potter preparing the ingredients obediently according to their textbook while Draco brewed.
“I wouldn’t,” Harry said earnestly as he looked at Teddy in commiseration. He also smiled at Malfoy who was looking at him. “I’ll be back every day if I can help it. I’m glad that I stopped by.”
"So you realised it before I gave the ice-skating spell," Harry mumbled as he tried to process his thoughts. "No wonder you were being so weird afterwards! You were always staring at me while opening the gifts! And all those weird questions!
"I'm sorry," Malfoy said as he fastened his satchel close. "It just came out and I didn't mean it." He fiddled with the fabric corner of his reference book, "and also, the times before this. It was mean, and I'm sorry."
Draco sighed as he pulled Harry towards the kitchens. "It's like he's hiding or something. I was walking up and down the corridors the whole afternoon, but he didn't appear." Morten was the only Unspeakable people knew, and he only revealed himself selectively along the corridor of the Department of Mysteries. Draco had managed to submit his application at the start of December, and there had been no indication of their interest after weeks of waiting.
He walked towards the bed, shifting his weight between his feet, hoping that the Slytherins would start talking again and ignore his presence.
"Harry, you'll win the match against Neville. You're not actually scared now, are you? Don't listen to girl Weasley's rubbish about determining the real hero. You can do it," he coached as he grasped his friend by the side of his arms. It was strange that Harry would suddenly be worried about the touted '
Harry looked around the Great Hall, grimacing as a clique of Hufflepuff girls dissolved into giggles when he looked their way. "I just don't-"
"Shush!" She scolded as she pulled the partitions around Malfoy's bed close. "Also, no visits allowed before seven thirty," she reminded as she led him out of the infirmary by the arm.
Draco startled when Granger suddenly sat down opposite him. He looked at Potter who had taken up the seat to his left. Draco looked at the Hufflepuff table. "You're sitting at the wrong table," he said unintelligently, addressing the comment to Potter.
"Alright, I'll trade you for the planning and booking then," Draco offered brightly as he leaned forward in challenge. The Magical Borders Restriction Authority was notorious for their bureaucracy and it was always a pain to apply for personal portkeys. He had always handed off the process for their trips to Andromeda due to the Malfoy family's records from the second war. Honestly, it really was unnecessarily cruel, but he simply couldn't pass up an opportunity to mess with Potter.
Accompanying it was a note assuring him that she felt him capable of achieving in any area he desired. Even though Bellatrix had squeezed all of his tears out of him during the war, Draco had found himself crying once more. After all, there were few things that Draco believed he deserved after the war, having brought Death Eaters to Hogwarts, and having been complicit in his inaction throughout. There were days where he would be in conflict with himself – he didn't deserve the kind words nor forgiveness, yet he desired so desperately to redeem himself and be a better person for all the times he didn't, and couldn't.
I know that you wouldn't write to me so quickly if you didn't have the time, but I worry that I am taking too much of your time. How's your research coming along?
"Are you sure that you want the dragon to be white?" Draco asked his cousin, desperate to put off talking to Potter as much as possible, afraid that he would burst into flames at prolonged conversation. Potter was simply too much, and Draco worried about his mortality.
"I'm a party even on top," Draco said just to be contrary as he took the knitted jumper with a sigh. As usual, he was giving in to everything that Harry requested. The entry in his journal would be a highlight of his failures. Pulling it on, he ripped a hand through his hair to ensure that it wasn't ruffled. He straightened his collar and tugged at his shirt sleeves for it to peek out just so. Overall, it didn't look too bad. The thickness of the material made him look a bit too cosy, but it was reasonable for the cuddles he would get in exchange.
The manual had said that the arrows would help their targets find love and that they would typically act on their desires within minutes as Cupid helped them put their best foot forward, but in this case, there was no foot forward to be had. Harry was
"I woke up today, and you were sleeping in your bed without drawing the curtains, and you didn't have your shirt on." Potter's face was red as he continued, seemingly unable to stop himself now that he had finally begun. "And I stood there watching you, wanting to touch and hold you so badly, I thought that my heart would explode from my chest. I got really afraid of myself. I don't want to lose what we have, but I want so much more, so I decided to not talk to you until I could stop myself, but not talking to you is worse, and I'm sorry," Potter finished lamely, wiping his tears before walking away by himself.
Draco left his home in a blanket of stasis spells, sending his trunk ahead with Worry and Sneezy. Unlike the pair of elves, he was not unfazed by his unique status, nor excited by the prospect of exploring Hogwarts. Draco had written to the Headmistress to discuss the possibility of contracting his elves, and the Headmistress had agreed immediately, unbothered by the wage demanded by his free elves. Maybe after Dobby, the members of the Order had come to expect oddities from the Malfoy elves, which really wasn't too much of a stretch in his opinion. Despite his father's poor treatment, many of the Malfoy elves had been reluctant to leave when sent away during the war. As a free elf, Sneezy had taken to gloves quickly, and Worry really liked making garments from threads and yarn, which suited the other Malfoy elves very well. The pair didn't seem to consider that they would stick out among the Hogwarts elves, and Draco didn't quite have the heart to tell them so.
Draco glared at Pansy from across the table, desperately trying to catch Pansy’s eyes while she leaned into Hermione’s space, heedless of Draco's warning to avoid both of them entirely. How could she be so shameless? Pansy had always been uninhibited in her whims, but did she not understand the gravity of the situation? He pushed his mulled mead aside as he made to stand, pausing when Harry’s arm suddenly looped around his.
“No! No, I was just wondering. About what you’ll get up to,” Harry clarified, appalled at how terribly awkward he was being. Watching Draco climbing into his bed was doing his head in.
With the week’s lessons being tied to the Winter Solstice, the Great Hall had been dressed up with mismatched decorations from its occupants. Wonky stars, uneven candles and wrinkly snowflakes floated above the tables while holly berries and sprigs of varying freshness lined the perimeter of the room.
Harry sipped his wine, watching as candlelight contoured Draco's high cheekbones. The warm glow was dancing across Draco form as he gestured while talking about the shenanigans the Slytherins had got up to in their last trip to a ski resort.
Pleasure softened Malfoy's features as he beamed uncharacteristically at him. "It's fine. The betrayal on your face when I knocked you out was more than enough," he laughed.
"They’re my tears of happiness," he said seriously as he smoothed the silk handkerchief in Harry's hand.
"Pansy used to be attracted to Hermione," Malfoy pulled him down to whisper messily into his ear as Pansy bowed to her appreciative audience.
"I would like to reiterate that Hogwarts has no tolerance for bullying. Please do not hesitate to inform any prefects, teachers or myself should you require any support, or have information of any happenings. The bullies will be dealt with accordingly." The Headmistress said sternly as her gaze swept across the Hall.
Everything started to fall into place. Draco's initial weight loss, his cravings, his appetite, his stomach cramps, and him crossing his own boundaries to request foot massages. He had heard that male pregnancies were complicated and more physically demanding. Maybe that was why Draco had agreed to the courting relationships with him—to increase contact with Harry's magic so that his pregnancy would be safer. Harry burrowed his face in his hands.
"Fuck," he swore, his knees buckling as he fell onto the floor. The pain was excruciating as he thrashed on the carpet. His body was burning, and his bones were trembling as if trying to leap out of him. He was being flayed open, the pain as consuming as Voldemort's Crucio in the graveyard. Shouting incoherently, he tried to fight off the hands that were holding him down. While he wished to pass out, he was suddenly vaguely aware amidst the throes of pain of the small space at his left lower temple where the pain did not touch. Clawing for the harbour in the red haze, he threw himself into it, trying to fit all of his consciousness into the space. The pain immediately evaporated and Harry convulsed on the floor as he lost consciousness.
Draco suddenly thought about his hair. How had it looked to Potter? Draco ran to his dressing table, stricken by the ghastly reflection that greeted him. At least he had seemed to make an impression, he consoled himself desperately, cheered by the memory of Potter unable to comprehend his presence. Fuck, was he now in possession of the knowledge of Potter's personal address? Trust Potter to live in a Muggle neighbourhood. Draco rolled his eyes at the predictability of Gryffindors, completely ignoring the fact that he too was also currently living in one.
Luna sighed to herself. "I wonder about it all the time," she mumbled as they fell asleep in the shade of the tree.
"This is so bad for my skin. And my mouth tastes like kneazle piss," Draco whispered as they stepped around their classmates. He summoned their clothes, sighing when Harry's shirt shot out from behind the couch.
Headmistress McGonagall was unrelenting and entirely unmoved by his strop. Even to ensure his physical well-being, making him Head Boy was an extreme measure. It was downright barking, when she had disregarded his tattered reputation and unhelpfully advised him to condense the schedule for his individual apology sessions with his schoolmates. The carelessness of her 'wisdom' was appalling – with a list of close to eighty schoolmates he planned to apologise to in person, and eight classmates scheduled for meeting in the first week, it was already stretching on sincerity. He could hardly be expediting anything!
Draco had next decided the problem to be Louis himself. Despite Malfoy Enterprises paying well over minimum wage, he couldn’t muster the zeal to sell water to a man dying of thirst. Yes, Draco reassured himself, Louis simply hadn’t been enthusiastic enough; he didn’t understand the
“Fine then, you try it! You’ll learn very quickly that I do not jest. Sit down and try a piping hot order of fried spidey, you’ll love it.” Before Harry could protest, Malfoy had shoved him into a shiny plastic booth and stalked over to the kitchen, ordering them to whip him up a deep-fried tarantula.
Harry scoffed, and Malfoy smirked. It would only be polite to introduce himself. Ugh, his name was probably Chaz or Dick or something awful like that--
Draco set down his wine glass without a sound and folded his hands elegantly in his lap. “Of course I am listening, Potter. It is only polite to do so.”
Choreography somewhat inspired by this YouTube video. Not the whole thing, just the bit at 1:40 that always makes me GASP 😊
Harry studied the tawny barn owl next to him. She was quietly preening her feathers and did not seem frightening at all. He shrugged and shook out a bag of owl treats on his kitchen table. The owl stared at him quizzically before abandoning all caution and diving right in. Harry chuckled. He would send her back to Malfoy, fat, happy, and without any answer at all. He could’ve replied, but he was lost on what to say.
Malfoy smirked. “I assure you, it’s not what you’d think. Come, Potter. I need to tell you a story.” Malfoy transformed a tree branch abandoned on the ground into a short but serviceable wooden bench. Harry grudgingly followed him as he sat down with a flourish of robes. He loathed receiving any help from Malfoy, but he would rather not get his robes wet.
When Harry was windblown and exhausted, he returned to the ground. His eyes were dry, but his heart was heavy. He didn’t miss the Malfoy he’d broken up with, but he did miss how Draco had been when they began. He had been almost sweet, and always surprising. Draco had become his best friend, the person he went to with every annoyance and every story. And then, things had irrevocably changed. Ironically enough, the dragon inheritance that brought them together had also been what pushed them apart.
Draco raked a hand through his own hair and started pacing in the small clearing. A branch snapped loudly under his foot, making Harry jump. “--I thought we were doing okay, I thought you were happy--”
“Hermione, I think you’ve been in the library for too long. We would’ve noticed Malfoy being a dragon,” Harry remarked shakily.
Harry had gone pale at that suggestion and quickly steered the conversation to the Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes new product line (a chewing gum that produced incredibly realistic daydreams, but which needed a propriety filter to keep it safe for public use). Maybe Ron was on to something, but Harry couldn’t exactly waltz up and knock on the door of Malfoy Manor now, could he?
“Potter, I’m taller. I’ll lead.” Harry shrugged in agreement, knowing he wasn’t a good enough dancer to try leading anyway. He jumped as a firm hand circled his waist and came to rest on his back. Merlin, Malfoy’s hand was warm. Harry felt its heat seep through his whole body.
“Well? What is your,” his mouth quirked into a smile, despite his obvious nerves, “your professional opinion?”
Draco grinned, rosy and gorgeous against the pale, luxurious sheets he favored. "I did. I've had that ensemble picked out for a week now. I knew you’d ask eventually."
, Harry. Now stop admiring my bedroom and start admiring me.” Harry chuckled, but was soon gasping as Draco’s mouth found his again, teasing his tongue and inflaming his senses. His clever fingers skated down Harry’s torso and began playing with the zipper on his trousers. His touch was feather-light, but Harry was already practically vibrating with want.
Draco smirked and prowled up the bed to meet Harry. He gave one long, lazy kiss. When Harry tried to force it into more, Draco pinned Harry’s shoulders to the bed and slid back down until his mouth was delectably close to Harry’s cock. He stuck out his perfectly pink tongue and licked one long stripe up its length, watching Harry’s intoxicated expression with hooded eyes. At Harry’s pleased moan, Draco took his cock ever so slowly into his mouth. Draco’s lips had been velvet-soft, but his mouth felt even better. Inch by inch, he engulfed Harry into wet heat until the tip hit the back of his throat. He sucked hard, humming all the while, as the vibration and sensations drove Harry mad.
Harry laid his head on the bed. It was spinning again. This had been happening a lot lately. “Oh no. Do you think we were ever really friends?”
Scorpius grows jaded with the library’s book selection, so a mobile may very well be a good idea. If one so desired, where would one obtain such an item?
“Urgh. I think I’ve learned my lesson about mulled wine, Harry. Maybe we can have dinner together later.”
good? But Harry had seen sparks fly from Malfoy’s mouth. Maybe it was a potion or a new Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes product? Harry filed that thought away to ask Hermione about; he knew he wouldn’t be able to figure that out on his own. He grimaced; she’d been right about needing the restricted section after all.
“You’ll let me know when you need more, yeah?” Rosmerta asked, beaming at Harry and completely ignoring Draco.
Ron rolled his eyes and gulped down some tea. “Give it a rest, mate. It’s weird that you know that, and it’s too ruddy early in the morning to talk about Malfoy. Ugh.”
A ginger head leaned close to his and whispered, “So glad I’m sharing with you, mate. Imagine having to share with a Slytherin! Ugh.”
Yet death did not come. Draco still felt unbearably hot, but the pain soon faded. He scrambled out of bed and to his full-length mirror, anxious to check for any broken bones or gaping wounds. Surely his body would show some sign of trauma. A quick
A bell chimed as they entered and a horribly familiar voice called out. "Hello, welcome to--Potter? Weasley?! Finally, someone who appreciates good food!" Draco Malfoy flew out from the back end of the restaurant, practically vaulting the counter in his enthusiasm to greet his new customers. He pumped each of their hands vigorously, grinning widely at each of them.
Your son sounds great. I bet we’d get along well. And I suppose I could’ve just Googled what Cendrillon was, but I wanted to bait you into replying. Giving you the chance to insult me never fails.
thing, except sometimes Draco would stare at Harry in a way that made his heart skip a beat. And then he would swoop in for a kiss, until Harry would protest, and someone walking by would inevitably say something rude. Draco would hex them or verbally eviscerate them, and the cycle would begin all over again.
Draco thrust a set of clothes into Harry’s arms and bundled him to the ensuite to change. Harry began disrobing, letting his clothes fall where they may. The emerald silk pajamas he’d been given smelled like Draco, clean and woodsy.
Instead, Potter grinned, quick and sharp. “Maybe. Anything to make you treat me like a friend instead of a client, Malfoy.”
Malfoy whipped off his apron and made for the door as though a vampire were going for his jugular. Harry chuckled under his breath again and followed.
Luckily the room was deserted when Harry returned. He didn’t want Ron asking what had happened until he’d had a chance to figure it out himself. He stared at himself in the mirror, yanking at his open shirt collar to finger the lurid purple marks blooming on his neck. Were those teeth marks?
Ron fell right off the bed in his haste to correct himself. “Oh, bollocks! I meant like a hug! Mate, I wouldn’t snog you if you were the last person on earth. Just the thought of that...ugh!”
“Draco, no,” Harry hissed into Draco’s ear. Sharp disappointment flared in Harry’s chest as he pushed Draco’s hand away again and scooted to the other side of the booth, but he quickly tamped it down. He was drunk, after all. It wasn’t Draco’s fault that he couldn’t bloody listen.
Harry awkwardly shuffled forward and stood a few feet away from Malfoy. For once, the other boy wasn’t scowling or sneering. His sharp grey eyes were utterly inscrutable. Malfoy studied Harry for a moment before he stepped terribly, heart-stoppingly close.
“It’s either that or murder. Go on, Malfoy. Cut me some flowers, so the manor won’t make me kill you," Harry smiled brightly at Malfoy and twirled his wand between his fingers.
Harry sat waiting up for hours in the common room, just in case. No owl arrived, and Malfoy seemed to have made himself scarce. Ron and Hermione tried to keep him company, but Hermione began to nod over the thick tome on her lap and Ron helped her to her room. When the embers of the dying fire began to swim before Harry’s eyes, he decided to pack it in and go to bed. Harry eased the door open slowly, in an attempt not to wake a sleeping Ron. The grating snores didn’t cease, so Harry tiptoed to his side of the room.
“You can leave now,” he said crossly. “No reply.” If an owl could scowl, this one certainly did. It chittered a bit and swooped back out through the cracked window. Draco settled back into the warm water and tried to banish the newfound tension in his muscles. Stupid Potter. Stupid Draco, as well. Replying to Potter previously had obviously only encouraged him; perhaps silence would better indicate his refusal to communicate.
“Hush, Draco, he'll think you don't like his little beard," Parkinson pretended to whisper. She cut her eyes at Malfoy before turning her attention to Ron. He was pleasantly surprised to realize that she was even smiling.
“And? Where is he?” Harry’s nerves jangled as he asked. If Pansy wouldn’t tell him the truth, he didn’t know what he’d do.
"Weasley, are you coming tonight? It’s just that little Korean karaoke place off Diagon, you can’t miss it. Their soju is divine.” Her dark eyes seemed to linger appreciatively on him, but she might also just be noticing the soup stain from his spilled lunch. He thought he’d spelled it away, but she’d always had sharp eyes.
Draco’s robe had puddled on the lush dining room carpet, leaving his delicious arse exposed in those tantalizing green knickers as he dropped it low. Merlin, Draco was gorgeous. Maybe he could ride him later, Draco’s cock buried deep in his arse, his legs still encased in those bloody stockings, moaning Harry’s name as that ridiculous silk robe creased beneath them. Harry wanted nothing more in the world, but had to quickly suppress thoughts like that or he knew he wouldn’t even make it through the rest of Draco’s performance. His boyfriend was sex appeal on long, lean legs, and he absolutely knew it.
A surprisingly bouncy beat came from the speakers as Harry stood onstage, fiddling with the microphone stand to get it to the right height. He finally gave up, wresting the mike from the stand. His foot tapped awkwardly and he stared at the back wall as the song began.
? Had they even really been friends, or had Malfoy just been trying to use him somehow? Had their whole truce been some kind of slimy, low-down ruse, meant to humiliate him or break his heart? If what had just happened wasn’t because of a curse or a potion...could he ever trust Malfoy again?
to vex me?” Draco drawled in his most obscenely posh voice. He was well-aware that Potter hated that voice, but if Draco was to be so annoyed, his pursuer was to be as well.
Harry gritted his teeth and reached for his wand. But before he could spit out some insult or question (he wasn’t sure which), Malfoy began to speak.
But an unyielding hand grasped Harry’s chin and forced him to look again at his snarling friend. They were so close that a fleck of spittle landed on Harry’s cheek as Malfoy spat out, “How dare you let him touch you? Don’t you know by now that you are mine, and I yours?”
“How bizarre. Does it want us to arrange flowers?” Malfoy pondered, tapping one long finger against his chin.
new personality when I returned after the war. It was throwing all the Dark artifacts and damaged furniture out the windows, and wanted to bury the items on the grounds in some kind of barbaric bespoke
Which was largely a wasted trip, but at least Hermione was pleased with Harry’s newfound dedication to studying. (She was somewhat dismayed when Harry’s enthusiasm didn’t extend to any other subject.) To Harry’s disappointment, sentient houses seemed to exist more in the realm of fantasy than fact: everyone agreed they existed, but couldn’t concur on anything else. So Harry sought knowledge on his own, sending away for out-of-print books and drawing up extensive notes for himself.
Eight strides across the floor, one hop to avoid the creaky floorboard near the door, and eight strides back. After a few hours of pacing, Harry’s head still spun in tangled circles, but he’d decided on three things.
“Of course you have to ask something impossible,” Draco spat, gritting his teeth. His eyes burned with something that was definitely not tears.
“Good, I think. I s’pose he can be, y’know, rather sweet,” Harry mumbled. “We’re kind of going on a date tomorrow?”
Draco smiled. “No, they are merely a facsimile of the real merpeople. Whatever do you mean about them not liking you?”
“Bloody hell, Harry, you got Malfoy,” Ron gasped. “D’you need a distraction? I think I've some Peruvian darkness powder in a secret compartment on my belt…” He frantically patted himself down, realized he wasn’t wearing his Auror robes, and sadly shook his head.
“Look, there’s the squid,” Malfoy said, pointing out a handful of pale tentacles on the other side of the lake.
“Very good, Potter. Now just stand still while I record your measurements.” Malfoy aligned himself against Harry’s back. He was still a hair’s breadth away, but Harry could feel tendrils of heat swirling from the man’s body. He moved away slightly and drew the measuring tape tight about Harry’s chest. The Quick-Quotes Quill scritched against the parchment, but Harry could barely hear it over the sound of his elevated heartbeat.
“Yes, it’s quite invested in my social connections.” Malfoy rolled his eyes, and the sofa he was sitting on almost bucked him off. “Out of the goodness of its heart, of course. But I digress. That brings us to now. Did you have any other questions, Potter?”
A bell chimed softly as Harry pushed the door open. The interior was expensively pleasant, smelling lightly of cedar and lemon. The walls were painted a dark blue, a color so deep and rich that Harry wanted to fall in. Shafts of sunlight reflected off the honey-colored wood of the fixtures, highlighting a case of shimmering sapphires and emeralds. Harry shrugged off his jacket and hung it on the coat rack by the door, feeling slightly warm as he looked around for someone to help him.
Hermione nodded and cast a quick charm to finish winding the yarn into a perfectly spherical ball. Ron looked at his suddenly empty hands with befuddlement, but they soon followed Harry up the stairs and back to his dorm room.
I didn’t know you’d become a dad. Congratulations to you and your wife. How old is your son? Also, do you know what dad jokes are? Here’s one for you: why do bees have sticky hair? Because they use a honeycomb. Tell Scorpius, I bet he’d like it. (He can explain if you’re too thick to get it.)
, how did Malfoy always manage to look so good? He’d always been rather aristocratically pointy, but he’d grown into it, looking less like a ferret and more like a marble statue. The morning sunlight bounced off his skin and made him glow. Of course Malfoy had to be more elegant and willowy than ever. Harry was painfully aware of his untidy hair and old jeans. But the man looked like he’d just left a health spa or a runway, anyone would feel messy next to him.
. If it is truly so insignificant, it can only take a moment,” Narcissa replied before taking a small bite of her finger sandwich.
Please take your seat.” His mother indicated the chair across from hers with an elegant gesture, practiced over long years of presiding over the manor.
“...Right. Good on you, Luna. Hey, d’you see McGonagall?” Ron snickered, pulling at his tight necktie. “What’s going on over there? I think Dean spiked the punch.”
Harry went to run a frustrated hand through his hair, until he remembered the delicate flower crown. “Weird. What could it possibly want us to do? The room’s bloody empty.”
His neck was bent at an impossible angle, but Neville quickly came back down to earth. “What? Oh, yeah...I was busy looking at the ivy up on the walls. Did you know it’s poisonous to consume? So, er, don’t eat any.”
Harry shuffled over and sagged into one of the chairs. After two games of Quidditch and watching Malfoy try to bake for over an hour, he could certainly use a rest.
Harry of course bought that outfit, and a dozen more. After their busy day, both boys were yawning. A quick apparition brought them to the outskirts of Hogsmeade. Just after another jaw-cracking yawn, Draco said, “You know, the night is young. Shall we stop for a nightcap?”
“Very good, Mr. Malfoy,” Professor Vector nodded. “You are correct. We hope each of you will be reminded of the importance of new beginnings and the purity of true friendship as you share the next year together. What Headmistress McGonagall said about inter house unity doubly applies to each of you, as you are an example for the whole school. With that in mind, here are each of your roommates.” She began to read off a long list. Harry noticed that while there were quite a few inter-house pairings, there were none between Gryffindor and Slytherin. As optimistic as McGonagall seemed to be, she was obviously still a realist.
Harry wondered, and jealousy coiled about his heart. He thrust back, and his cock brushed against Malfoy’s. Even through all their layers of clothing, Harry could tell that Malfoy was big. His cock was probably gorgeous too, the bastard. It made his mouth water, imagining taking it all the way into his mouth, until he started to choke.
When he wasn’t trying to poison or curse anyone, Malfoy had a very dark, biting sense of humor. He would always surprise Harry with a snarky comment on one of his origami birds during a boring lesson, or drop a slightly mean (yet gut-bustingly funny) anecdote into conversation. (Ron only ever rolled his eyes, but Harry noticed that Hermione’s cheeks always pinked with suppressed laughter.)
“Draco--” Potter was standing there, illuminated under the nearest streetlight, staring directly at Draco and making no effort to reciprocate the handshake.
Hermione tapped her chin gently with the letter as she thought. “Meaning, let me think...hmm. Black usually means death, but it can also mean a new beginning. Jasmine’s a bit easier; it means affection and,” she coughed delicately, “sensuality.”
at him. “Potter, I’ve never been happier to hear you say ‘um.’ Do have another bite, you enjoyed the first one so much!”
Harry, Ron and Hermione had again read Malfoy’s letter together. To Harry’s dismay, his friends didn’t seem to be disgusted or suspicious at all. He half-wondered if Malfoy was trying to court him or his best friends.
“No, he’s got a point, ‘Mione,” Ron argued, peering over Harry’s shoulder to finish reading the letter. “Merlin, it’s sappy. Maybe Malfoy was supposed to be a Hufflepuff after all.”
Draco let one of his hands fall down to intertwine with Harry's. Harry smiled and let out a deep breath he hadn't even realized he was holding. Draco knew what he was doing was wrong. Draco promised himself he wouldn't fall for Golden Boy, after all he wasn't good enough for Harry.
Draco sat there and waited for what felt like the longest six minutes of his life. Harry rambled on about Blaise and his eyes and his hair and whatever else he could. Draco watched Harry eventually fall asleep. That hopefully meant the potion had worn off.
"Looks like it's just you against us now" Draco smirked at his aunt. "I can take all of you on, this should be easy." Bellatrix smiled and began throwing more spells. She was aiming all of them at Harry, but no one would allow her spells to touch him.
"That's why most of you saw blood in my clothes, it wasn't me. I didn't hurt Harry. I wouldn't hurt him. I did hurt the man who had taken him. If I hadn't he would've become a threat to us all...I know it won't be easy to just believe I've changed. I do hope someday, somehow you all will forgive me for my past ways." Draco smiled slightly and looked out at everyone staring back at him.
He left his 'home' on his own considering his aunt and uncle would never doing anything for him, the freak.  Harry  arrived at platform 9 3/4 and ran through it with his things.
Draco sighed and kicked the covers off of him. He got up and paced his room, trying to tire himself out. "1..2..3..4..5..6..7..8" He counted eight steps then turned around and counted once more. His mother had taught him that. She told him "Draco, honey, if you're ever stressed or all panicky count to eight, count eight steps, eight items, eight anything" She would say that to him whenever he'd go into his fits of panic.
Harry rolled his sleeve back down and huffed. He turned on his side and slowly closed his eyes, trying to silence the rude voices in his head.
Draco walked over and lit the fireplace. He sat on the couch with his book and waited for Harry. Harry came and sat down next to Draco. Draco pulled Harry to lay his head on his chest,  he wrapped his right arm around Harry and held the book. Harry threw his legs onto Draco's and got comfortable.
He came out of the bathroom, walking back into the room with Ron and Hermione. Hermione smiled and felt her eyes fill with tears. She walked over and hugged Harry, careful not to wrinkle his suit. "I'm sorry I'm such a crybaby today." She sniffled and pulled away.
"Seems as if you just could not shut up about me." Draco teased on. Harry just remained silent and smiling. Draco began laughing hysterically as they entered the hall. Once they were in multiple heads turned to face them. Harry Potter back from the hospital with Draco Malfoy. Quite a scene.
They were all trying to shake the memories of what had just happened. Draco was still shaken by the thought of Harry's death. Harry was still shaken by the thought of Draco's.
"Dray it's alright. What's your favor Blaise?" Harry used Blaise's first name because he trusted him. Harry can read people, Blaise had his guard down. Blaise was being genuine and sensitive. It kind of shocked Harry.
Draco's hands were now moving along Harry's upper body. Harry's hands rested on Draco's shoulders. Draco pulled away and left sloppy kisses down Harry's jawline. Harry tilted his head to the side and let out a soft subtle moan. It was one of the most gorgeous things Draco had ever heard. Draco sucked down Harry's neck. He wanted to make Harry feel desired and needed.
Harry and Draco both smiled. "Harry, your uncle and aunt, they would like you to return home for the weekend. I strongly suggest you go" Dumbledore said calmly. Harry felt his throat closing. His breath became very unsteady and his legs felt like jelly. "Did they say what for?" Harry said shakily.
Harry ground his hips up against Draco as he carried him. Draco squeezed Harry's thighs causing Harry to gasp. With the gasp Draco slid his tongue into Harry's mouth. Harry quietly whimpered into Draco's mouth. Draco's shirt had been left in the main room along with Harry's.
Harry smiled because he knew this was going to be a forever sort of thing. They were in love, true love. They knew it wasn't just lust or physical attraction because they were in a bath together. Just a bath, nothing sexual, just a nice relaxing bath.
"Wanna go lay down for a bit?" Draco said as he caressed Harry's hair. Harry nodded and went into the large bedroom. Draco followed. "This is so amazing" Draco said plopping down on the bed. "I know it's amazing" Harry laid down on the surprisingly soft bed. "The bracelets are amazing." Harry smiled. Draco nodded and wrapped his arms around Harry securely.
Harry felt his cheeks redden and saw his friends mouths agape. He signaled to them he didn't know what was going on and got up. "Zabini, partner with Crabbe" Blaise fumed and got up. Harry stopped at the side of the table, letting Blaise out. Blaise scowled at him and walked away. Harry sat down next to Draco.
"I cannot believe you." Harry had the biggest smile on his face, his cheeks began hurting. Narcissa was just watching with love and endearment. "I love you boys" She scooted over to them and hugged the both of them. They both reacted instantly hugging her back.
Draco pressed a kiss to Harry's cold lifeless lips, his tears soaking Harry's face. "M-my love.." Draco said through tears, his voice breaking constantly. Draco brushed a piece of hair off of Harry's forehead.
Harry stumbled into Snape's classroom, the door was already open. "Professor?" Harry said as he entered the room.
Draco was in his bedroom just staring at a wall. He heard Harry cry. Draco heard Harry's whimpers. They hurt him deeply, he had hoped they weren't because of him. Draco wanted to go comfort Harry. No, no Draco would never comfort Harry Potter. Draco was strong and much better than Harry. At least he thought so.
What he thought was early was actually 12:30. "We slept in that long?" Draco said ghastly. "We needed it" Harry said and got up out of bed. He dragged himself to the bathroom to begin freshening up. "How did your mother not try to at least wake us?" Harry said from the bathroom.
"No Sir i'm not i'm sorry.." Harry said backing away "You will be sorry" His uncle got up and unbuckled his belt sliding it off. Harry gulped and starting backing away faster. His uncle caught up to him and whipped him with the belt. His back was red and scarred from what his wretched uncle had done.
"Deal" Draco held out his hand. Honestly that part was no bother, Draco felt no yearn for anyone else. "Deal" Harry put his hand in Draco's and shook on it. "And no feelings"  Draco smirked and pulled his hand away. Harry nodded, that rule didn't need to be said it was implied. "Well then Malfoy, I'll be off to bed now" Harry said getting up. Draco licked his bottom lip.
