“Because the expression on your face was definitely worth putting a pumpkin on my head,” Draco replies, still grinning like the evil person he is.
Potter poured liberally and soon they were all pleasantly buzzed, though some more than others. It turned out Potter was a bit of a lightweight and two cups in he was babbling like an idiot. Draco himself felt it prudent to call it quits at three cups and Weasley followed his example, pleading an early day at work the next day. Potter, on the other hand, kept going, and that was when Draco realised they’d made a grave mistake in not stopping him earlier.
Draco would have turned over to go to sleep then, but the letter on top looked to be from Ginny. Call him a glutton for punishment, but he decided to read it.
sorry that you lost your best friend. I know any losses I had can’t add up to what you’ve gone through, but I do know how it feels to lose someone you care about. To feel incomplete and lost.”
, long since restored to the family tree along with many others.
“She’s relentless,” Pansy groaned. “Wants me married off and popping out a child before I’ve even reached twenty! I almost wish I was gay, maybe then she’d get off my back.”
“Lily…”
He nodded solemnly. “He did indeed. Of course, the trouble started after he landed.” Here he managed to hold back a wince. Thinking back, it hadn’t been one of his finer moments.
Potter took a bite out of a cookie too and he also voiced his approval. They were both on their third cookies when Aunt Andromeda came in with a tea tray. They all settled down and the tea was conducted with his mother and aunt trying to outdo each other in most outrageous childhood incidents.
Draco looked away. Luna had this way of making him feel like he was on display. Sometimes when he caught her staring at him it was as if those pale eyes could see right through him, shifting through all the protective layers he’d erected around him until she was looking straight at his soul, bruised and tarnished as it was.
“So what if I wanted to know what was happening? Sue me!”
“You could say that.”
linked by golden thread to
“Yes, I am already aware of the fact,” he retorted shortly.
“Okay so, after the War, the public weren’t very accepting of us Malfoys.” Draco gave a bitter laugh. “It was expected so I wasn’t too concerned about it all. When I came back to Hogwarts for my eighth year, the only other Slytherin who came back was Greg. I think he only came back for me actually. It was strange not having Vince with us, and Greg seemed lost without his friend. He left after the first week of school. Said he couldn’t do it and that he was sorry. I didn’t try to stop him and we sort of lost touch after that, though we still
He watched as Potter made a circuit around his room and he found himself fidgeting nervously. This room had always been one of his favourite places in all the world, and it had served as his sanctuary when the Manor had been taken over by You-know-who. No one had troubled him when he was here and it had solely been due to his mother’s protectiveness. She’d woven a thick network of spells into the very walls of his room, making it so that only she and Draco could enter. You-know-who could surely have broken through, but he’d never had reason to do so and the room had been impermeable to everyone else, Lucius included. Draco loved this room with all his heart and it was with bated breath that he waited as Potter took everything in.
“Let’s fix this then,” Potter pressed, a twinkle in his eye now. “Let’s take turns picking a random topic and then the other person has to give their opinion about it.”
“The next morning we agreed that it was just a one-off and that nothing had to change,” Pansy continued. “But we were completely wrong, and it got really awkward between us. We stupidly ignored all the signs and tried to hook up with other people, and then a few nights after it happened, I saw Blaise kissing some girl at a club and something inside me just clicked into place.”
Ginny looked delighted. “Is he always like this?”
“The house looks fabulous,” he says, practically preening as they stand on the sidewalk surveying their work. Harry has to admit, Draco’s outdone himself. He’s liberally conjured fake cobwebs and spiders as well, and has managed to create one of the most tasteful Halloween houses Harry’s ever seen. It sure beats the house on their left, with splashes of red paint all over the lawn, probably meant to look like spilt blood.
. Never been more thankful to be a ‘blood traitor’.”
Draco opened his eyes with a slightly hysterical laugh and
“Scarhead.”
The two began arguing good-naturedly, walking a bit in front of Draco and the rest. Al continued to quiz Draco about his preferred chocolate while James butted in with his personal opinion on each of the mentioned chocolates. Draco however was hardly paying attention to either of them.
Draco didn’t really know what to say. Potter was staring mutinously at the ground and scuffing his trainer on the grass.
Narcissa let out a delicate huff of air that was her equivalent to a snort of laughter.
They all settled down and Draco passed around the brownies. As promised, Harry had taken him to that Muggle café –
Draco’s mind whirled.
“Are my guilty pleasure and very pleasing they are indeed. Comfortable too,” he retorted. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ll be on my way to talk to actual human beings, lest I confirm my mother’s suspicions that I am a few steps away from going completely round the bend.”
Draco stilled, blood rapidly rushing to his face. The topics they chose weren’t usually so…
The ‘wounds’ are still wet and rapidly stain the t-shirt just the way Harry had wanted. Dean sets his brushes away and picks up the small bucket of paint.
“Cookies and cocoa?” Potter suggested, rolling his neck with a sigh of satisfaction and smiling at Draco in a beguiling manner. “Come on, Malfoy, you know you want it.”
They turned to James who looked rather put out by the lack of attention.
“What happened to the peacocks after that?” Percy asked.
Narcissa was waiting for him near the stairs and she smiled as he approached, holding up her new book.
Harry is trying his best to keep them both balanced on the tiny kitchen chair they are currently standing on, and Draco shaking him is certainly not helping.
Ginevra smiled reassuringly. “The children
“Oh, so we’re playing that game, are we? I guess I should let Narcissa know what
Draco groaned. “Mother. It’s late. I’m exhausted, It’s none of your business. I’m going to bed.”
Draco shot him the two-fingered salute over his shoulder.
Harry nudged him lightly and he turned to find his husband smiling back at him with a soft look to match his own. “Come on, you have somewhere to be, remember. You can gaze at it all you want when we get back.” He used their still joined hands to pull Draco to the Floo.
Splash me one more time and you’ll have no desserts for a month.” Potter threatened, glaring at the five year old.
“Very.”
look suspicious.
Draco’s surprise must have shown on his face because she laughed again.
Draco’s eyes widened, finally understanding where this was going. “I said I’d go see him. Right now was not implied.”
,” Draco added when Potter got a hopeful look of his face. “And most probably dream about a sexy blonde wizard with rather exceptional acting skills.”
“In my defence, I was hoping to keep the thing out when I did that.”
what are we going to do?”
“Pot, kettle,” Potter returned with a jaunty smile, and then yelped and took on a defensive position when Blimpy suddenly appeared in front of them with a loud
“Oh, so you’ve almost finished up with the décor, have you?” Weasley said with blatantly feigned casualness, his eyebrows resting near his hairline. “The cake turned out perfectly, by the way.”
Ginny caught sight of him, kneeling in front of the fire. “Not a bad look for you,” she said with a sly look. “Come on, I was worried you’d chicken out so I came to get you. Sweet Godric, your house is
. For one thing there was the fact that his son would also be present, then there was the whole ‘buy a gift for my ex-wife’ factor and not to forget the crucial fact that Potter would never in a million years be interested in
“Draco!” Al cried and leapt forward to hug his leg.
“So, tell us about this odd day of yours.”
happen!”
“They said there’s more than enough time for them to get it ready. Teddy’s going to love it.”
“Reduces me to tears, it does.”
Granger smiled again and came forward. “I’ll just be taking Hugo then.” she said as she took her squealing son off Draco’s shoulders. “I won’t try to take Lily since Ginny says she’s quite taken by you.”
.” He shot a covert look around and saw that Harry had given up the chase and was now sulking in a corner. If Draco hadn’t been so relieved, he might have laughed at the petulant look on his face.
“Oh you don’t know the half of it.” Potter replied with an enigmatic smile. “Anyways let’s hear it.”
“I’m beginning to see that.” Potter replied, and Draco turned away to hide the blush that had suddenly come to his cheeks. He blamed it on his mother, filling his head with strange ideas.
never apologized,” he began haltingly. The old Draco wouldn’t have apologized, but then again, he wasn’t the old Draco now, was he? He looked down at his lap for a minute before looking up again. “I’m sorry for- for ever making fun of your family, or your wealth, or your clothes. And I’m sorry Lucius almost got you killed your first year. And I’m sorry
“I am happy! I just wish you could have relied on me to help too.”
Draco found himself smiling in response. “I was contemplating how to punish you for your little laughing fit back in the shop but I see the answer is more laughter. How deliciously ironic.”
Mercury hooted haughtily, no doubt boasting about his expert hunting skills. Draco tried to give his little companion an ear, but soon enough he just couldn’t maintain his smile anymore and flopped back onto his back.
In July, he asks Draco to clear his schedule for the second week of August, and proposes a vacation to Greece. “We should live a little,” he says breezily. “The Ministry has already approved my request for a leave of absence. Apparently, I’ve got quite a few vacation days saved up. A change of scenery would be nice, eh?”
doesn’t say anything.
The notion was just ridiculous. You couldn't fall in love with someone you'd hated for seven years after just one short month.
Malfoy stands up abruptly.
He watches as Draco lies bleeding on the bathroom floor.
“ I don’t know what happened, “ he says, hating the tinge of desperation which creeps into his own voice.
Possibly more than it’s logical to want something so simple and mundane.
Draco made him a milky colored drink with chocolate sauce drizzled over the side and whipped cream on top, garnished with chopped peanuts. There was a small plate of biscotti, too: lemon and gingerbread. The lemon flavor was a bestseller, Harry knew. At this time during the day, they were usually long sold out.
He could feel his face growing warm. “They said I ought to invite you. It’ll be a reunion of sorts; a bunch of our old classmates will show up. It’s more of a party, I reckon. Nothing too posh, but there’ll be drinks and food and—“
Hermione and Ron save him a plate of lukewarm food when he finally joins them at their usual spot in the Great Hall.
“ I think we should see the last two memories. “
There, only several feet away, is Draco Malfoy, sitting on the edge of the tower with his back to Harry.
The brightness is loud.
Silence.
There’s a pull in his gut which has never been there before, urging him on almost beyond reason.
Though that in itself, he supposes, is change enough.
He lets loose a bloodcurdling scream of guttural rage. Ron is in front of Hermione in a split second, grabbing his arms and shouting words which don't make sense repeatedly in his ears.
**********
“None at all.” He plasters on a wide grin, hoping to mask any signs of apprehension. “We’ll have a blast, I promise. And tomorrow we can spend the day at the beach. Maybe I’ll get that tan after all.”
He turns towards Harry—distance is no longer tangible. His hand grazes Draco’s face; Draco’s legs brush against his. They fit into the negative space around each other, limbs unfurled and loose. The pillows are creased, and the sheets are warm and dappled with sunlight.
Draco blinks, the corners of his eyes red.
Draco Malfoy was not in love with Harry Potter, either.
" You can't hurt him! I won't fucking let you! " His hands are shaking now as he grips the man in his arms, who is dazed and starting to mumble unintelligibly.
he thinks.
It’s ugly, but the way it leaves him breathless makes him think it’s more than beautiful has ever made him feel.
“ You remembered. “
get to the bottom of this peculiar situation.
“Two what?”
Feeling sheepish, he grabs Malfoy’s hand and looks up—to find familiar slate grey eyes locked on his own already.
He stares staunchly at the bathroom wall while Draco sits behind him, working silently. The
“ Ask me if we can be
“ No, of course I do, “ he says hastily.
“More than a proposal in our kitchen?”
Which one is the lie?
him. "
He feels refreshed after splashing his own face with cold water in the bathroom stall- determination takes place of the helpless despair he’d felt earlier.
“ It’s alright, you’re having a panic attack. Take your time. Deep breaths. Count to seven with me. “
“ Wait, “ he says slowly, an uneasy feeling spreading in the pit of his stomach.
Draco blinks.
Some things never change.
" Goodbye, " he says simply. He makes it as far as the other end of the room before someone grabs him.
It was a simple question, a single word, and yet he’d been bound to the spot, unable to give her a single one of his in return.
Harry came in during the evening, after clocking out of the Ministry, and passed the time sipping his drink. When Malfoy disappeared into the back room to take his break, he brought his empty tray to the trolley nearby and made clumsy attempts at conversation. They talked about monotonous things at first, like the weather and Harry’s job at the Ministry. Later on, he asked Malfoy about Jiji, and found out he always wanted a kneazle for a pet.
The blood roars in his ears. All he knows in that moment is pain. He lashes out at the hands restraining his body, the room tilts nauseatingly, the edges of his vision blurs, and the next thing he knows he's falling.
They sit across from each other at the table, sunlight spilling into the room and staining the walls. Harry takes a clementine from the fruit bowl and sinks his thumb into the top of the skin. He peels the pith and pries the flesh apart, wordlessly hands Draco half a clementine. Their fingers brush; neither of them looks away when their eyes meet.
Draco crosses his arms over his chest. “I could take some time off, I suppose. But why Greece? You’ve never mentioned anything about wanting to travel.”
In the end, Harry’s never been one to back down from a challenge.
, and he's
Harry blurts out his thoughts all at once, in a breathless tirade, until he’s cut off mid sentence and utterly irked.
At this, Malfoy glanced at him, uncertainty flickering on his face, and Harry looked back.
They arrive at noon, to a clear blue sky and an expansive view of the rugged coastline. Santorini is warm, the air dry and the occasional gust of wind briny.
**********
He offered a smile in return. “The pumpkin pie…uh, the pumpkin drink with whipped cream on top?”
“You know I’ll say yes. Yes. I’m saying yes. What else is there for me to say, Harry?”
“ How we haven’t really seen any other passengers onboard? “
Draco gave him a befuddled look. “It’s Christmas Eve.”
Draco huffs. “You should make appointments, you know. Get a trim every month or so.”
Malfoy clears his throat.
The days pass easily. He finds company in an old lady next to his bed, and they discuss the weather sometimes. Occasionally he's allowed to go on walks in the gardens. He dreams of strange things some nights. Those are the nights he wakes drenched in sweat and a distinct feeling of unease.
" I'm the bloody Savior, aren't I? Why won't you leave me alone? He's fine. I'm fine and we're both- "
“I do not see anything against it, now,” Blaise said. “Unless … are you with your child’s father? Are you getting married?”
Harry didn’t say anything to that for a long moment. He surprised Draco with stepping closer, his warm hands coming to rest on blonde’s red cheeks, lifting his head slightly so he could look into Harry’s sad, green eyes.
“Di-Disrespect me?”
“I had fun. Sort of. I read a book I found. I suppose nothing here would show Muggles in right light.”
Draco passed her blouse, and she took it, blue, tear eyes wide opened.
“So,” Harry was the one to break the new silence. “Can I ask about the reason why you are here?”
With a final deep breath he walked downstairs to the ballroom, that was beaming with people. He started looking for his mother, and he could swear he saw a flash of red hair two times.
“Although is a fancy ‘but’.”
“Okay. So be it. Just…whenever you are ready to talk, I will be waiting. I guess. Good luck with your NEWTs.”
But Hermione didn’t even heard him. As a last resort the redhead looked at him, a bit hesitant even. They still weren’t on the best terms. They barely ever met, and if, they never talked. Even today, Draco spoke barely few sentences. He knew he was sort of fifth-wheeling in the friends group, so he wanted to keep the low profile.
“I am almost done,” he said, not getting eyes off the parchments.
“Finchingfield, Essex.”
“Yeah. I mean … I did like it. I really did. But I shouldn’t have done it here and like that. We are outside, and anyone could just be passing by. I didn’t think. I am really sorry. I didn’t mean to … risk exposing you like this.”
He really would mind if the cat made him fall into the mud, and it was slowing him down great deal.
Harry smiled as if he was really happy that he was staying. It felt way too nice, thinking that it might be the case.
be there. He asked Kreacher for some food before left to walk around the house, take a tour of his own, now that he could focus more. He found out that were few untouched bedrooms and rooms, staying dusty and cluttered with more furniture than they were meant to be holding.
“Keep the change,” he said.
“So, you better tell me how things are,” Blaise said.
“Yes, yes.” He kneeled in front of the House-elf, lowering his voice. “I need your help. I need to get out of the house.”
“I am saying that I do not have a problem with it, Draco. I can raise your child as my own. We can have more children, together, if that is what you would want.”
His heart squeezed painfully at Harry’s words and his troubled expression. There was also a visible pant in his green eyes.
Stan gave him a curious look as if he was going to argue, but eventually, he just thanked him and walked away.
(See the end of the chapter for
He could see the top of Hogwarts’s towers when he felt some sort of curse hit his back. The last thing he knew was the awful, prickly stiffness overtaking his body as he fell face first into cold snow.
At the end of January the weather was still awful, even though everyone were already tired of endless snow and gloomy looking sky. Draco was more than ready for spring, but that wouldn’t come for another few months, and not even the pace of his life was helping.
“I got a very nice pair of hand knitted-or-something slippers in most … pink color I had ever seen. But they are very nice and cozy, so no complains.”
“We are going to sit with them,” the Weaselette announce, interrupting Neville. She was already sliding out of her place, pulling Harry by hand.
“It’s alright. It’s more yours than it’s mine, I suppose,” Harry said, tone of his voice weird, unlike anything Draco had heard before.
“Welcome to the Knight Bus. My name is Stan Shunpike and I will be your conductor today. Get in, get in. Let me take that for you.”
“I’m awake, I’m awake,” he muttered.
, what might have been the most embarrassing and nerve-wrecking thing in his whole life. She just nodded, giving the rest of the week off to get himself in shape after the incident. So, in the end, he had full of four days off and wouldn’t have to get to class until Monday, having his meals delivered to the dorm, curtesy of the Elves. Which gave him potentially enough time to come to terms with things and come up with some plans, but at the same time not enough at all.
“Very uninformative. How old were you when you first did it?”
It was very pleasant day, and the last thing Draco needed was worrying about them. Especially Ginny. He didn't like Hermione bringing them up, but he knew she was oblivious to why he wouldn't like that.
Harry didn’t answer, just stretched hand towards him, the softness of his face making Draco fully trust him and take his hand. Harry pushed the door opened, and they stepped inside the small room, oddly shaped into sort of a circle with dark paint on its walls. There wasn’t much there, just a big balcony with the view for the night sky and the woods. Even though it was opened, and the snow was falling outside, it didn’t feel one bit cold.
He didn’t wait for the words of answer, only rushed back to the castle and then to the Dungeon. He hated being at school, with all the Slytherins and other people that despised him, having to hide in the corners. But here was better than home. Here he wasn’t alone, left for his own thoughts twenty four hours every day. His mother was out of it, in her own world as she has been his whole life. Back at the Manor there was no Hermione or Harry or Luna, and he doubted that neither of first two would contact him ever again once the school ended. Harry wouldn’t, for obvious reasons. He had some faith in Hermione, but she would forget him rather quickly, he was sure. There was no way he would be able to meet with her, and he had a feeling that once his mother would catch wind of letters from Muggleborn, it would be the end of it. Luna was his only hope, but she and her father were leaving to Nova Scotia and then to Norway in search of some mystical, non-existing things that he didn’t remember the name of. So, Luna too would be too busy to see him or write more than every other month.
“I weren’t planning on, but I’m meeting someone,” he said, quietly.
“Are you alright?” she asked.
Blaise didn’t push the subject further, instead carrying on with the conversation about his work that Draco started. He had to admit that it was pleasant. He was happy to meet Blaise after such a long time, and that there were no sort of tension between them. He didn’t have even a slightly hard time speaking. It was so easy with Blaise, and he wanted it to last a bit longer. He didn’t need to worry about anything, about anyone peering over the corner, ready to say something nasty to him or to start some new rumor. And even if there were, he didn’t care one bit.
“No.”
He was on the edge of crying, something in his chest tightening. He didn’t say anything, keeping his eyes on the evening sun, even when Harry stood next to him and he could feel the green eyes boring into him.
“Do you think about your parents sometimes?” Draco asked, softly.
“Somehow I’m not convinced. Are others giving you hard time? You could tell me, you know? I met few of them on my way here. They asked me out on a beer later but I have no intentions of going. Carrow is the worst asshole I got to know. Is he giving you a hard time? Because I would suspect him.”
“You did this?”
“Mm. Yeah. I won’t work, obviously. I would need to focus on getting a child, then on being pregnant, and then on endless social occasions and doing nothing whatsoever.”
Draco looked after him, heart beating fast. He couldn’t properly process what just happened. Did Harry really want to kiss him or was it just his imagination? And did he walk away because someone wrote to him to meet, or just because he wanted to run away from Draco?
“For what, exactly?”
Even Salem sensed how uneasy he was, stirring awake and meowing, paws running up and down his stomach. Just moments later cat found his way under his school vest and up to rub head against his neck and chin in comforting manner. That little clingy alien. But it did help a little bit. Draco moved his hand to pat Salem on the back, grateful for the comfort.
“It’s … It’s very sweet, Harry. Very nice thing of you to say, but it’s just how it is. Besides, it isn’t like I have any better options. We already established what people think of me. I will never find a job, I will never be able to support myself, and my parents will cut me off the minute I decide to walk away from the life they prepared for me…”
“No.”
“You are so…”
“I will go to bed,” he said.
“What?” Harry said, almost startled.
“Hi,” Harry said, sitting down next to Hermione, keeping distance of her and Luna between them.
“No. Tell him to come in. And get us some chamomile tea, please.”
He didn’t tell his mother about his condition yet, and it was already the middle of July. The fact that he was pregnant was no longer information he could forget or hide so easily. He started feeling sick not long after coming back home, and he didn’t do much more than napping or just laying in his bed or at the patio. There was also the fact that he quite literally popped. One day he just noticed that his favorite turtleneck was a bit too tight around his middle, and he was now sporting a small belly, that couldn’t be really considered a weight gain. His whole body still looked the same ghostly, sickish way it did before. So, he had to take an extra measure of wearing more baggy clothes, which didn’t go unnoticed by his mother, that said he ought to take better care of himself, not to parade around like a beggar.
happen while nothing happened.
Draco’s head snapped up to him. He looked at him with wide eyes. For a moment he thought he was hearing wrong or that Blaise misspoke. But the other didn’t take it back.
“How are you?” Blaise was first to speak.
He tried to say something, ask why was he there, but no words came out. His throat felt coarse and closed off.
Author <3
“Clever,” he agreed.
“I can’t. They hate me,” he said, quietly.
“Of course. Ron gives me in-depth stories of their relationship that I never asked for. He has been talking about it for weeks, but he wasn’t sure. I think it is good idea for them both, to breakup. They will be better off as friends. Sometimes t is like this, I guess. You love someone and it doesn’t work out the way you want it.”
“Young Master called.”
“What are you doing here?” Harry said.
I love you so much,
They went through the portrait hole, the portrait of The Fat Lady letting out a startled shrink as Harry spoke the password out of thin air. They passed the empty common room and went all the way upstairs to the room at the end of the corridor. Only in the comfort of two-bed room, with door securely closed, they dropped the Invisibility Cloak.
“O-O-Of course! It was so much fun. Scary a bit. Grinch was scary. But he t-turned out n-n-nice!” he said, overly excited what made Harry laughed a bit, and him blushed. “S-S-Sorry.”
Harry smiled softly, but sat down without another word. He sat next to him, petting Salem that was still softly rubbing against his face and neck with its small head.
Harry proceed to taking off his coat and dropping his bag to the floor before he sat in the armchair at the fireplace.
“Hey. I thought it would be safer than sneaking around,” Harry said.
. And even if he could overcome the stigma of his name, of his family, over the fact that he would be ruining Harry’s life, there was Ginny that made him terrified. He was being a bit unreasonable, looking at how they all were adults, but he didn’t dare take anything for granted. And finally, he had to keep in mind the fact that Harry, well, betrayed him. He had told his girlfriend all about it, and admitted that it was just a bit of an experimentation, just to have some fun, probably.
“No ‘but’s. Go back to bed, have a nice night, and I will see you at breakfast.”
They were buried in the talk about the new law that Department for Magical Creatures was trying to pass. Well, Harry, Hermione and Neville, at least were. He himself didn’t want to even open his mouth about anything that related politics, not only because he had no idea about anything of sort, while Luna read the Quibbler and Ginny was stubbornly silent, showing how displeased she was to be around them.
Hermione leaned against the tree with book of newest edition of Ancient Runes, while he sat right on the corner of the blanket, legs crossed with cat between them, reading his copy of Pride and Prejudice. Ron was close to his girlfriend, fixing chess board, and Harry laid not far away from Draco, looking effortlessly breathtaking with hands tucked behind his head, sunglasses on, and letting sun heat his face.
Draco couldn’t stop thinking about what he just learned. He didn’t care about Carrow or anyone else. He cared about Harry’s words, the fact that he cared for him. He didn’t want to let his mind wonder places it shouldn’t. That he pulled it to something else than deep friendship.
He nodded, taking a handful of a powder from the fireplace before stepping inside. With shaking hands he spoke the words and dropped the powder. With a bit of turbulence that were always there, he appeared in a strange fireplace to walk into gloomy, what he supposed to be, sitting room. It was big with renewed wooden floors in dark color, walls raw as if in middle of repainting, and most of furniture, save for an armchair in the corner, pushed to another corner and covered with white cloth.
Warnings: Implied sexual content (but we are pure souls here so just a tiny, tiny piece of detail of Harry's upper physique)
Blaise didn’t wait for his answer, he only took his hand and led to the dance floor where few pairs were dancing to the quartet’s music. Draco didn’t object, letting himself be slowly led in the dance.
“There you are,” Hermione said, making his jump.
He barely every got chance to talk with Harry too, but that was whole other story. He became noticeably more present at the library, claiming that Ron wasn’t the best study partner. So, they never really got much chance to talk about anything other than homework. Not that Draco minded. The less his obsession was fed the better.
Spring came faster than anyone suspected. In late March the snow has already melted away, due to hot sun, and some early flowers started to bloom. No one really complained, looking at how tiring the winter was. Many students took advantage of the nice weather and went to explore the grounds.
Then there was very stupid scenario that Harry planted in his mind – drawing someone’s nude picture. Harry’s nude picture. Just thinking about it made him blush. Not that he imagined it per se. He would never even want to imagine. It was too awkward, too embarrassing. But just the idea itself … no, it was still too much.
“Happy Christmas,” he said, quietly.
Just as he was about to agree, the door opened again and a familiar tall man in smart suit and black coat came in. Blaise scanned the place and they eyes met. Draco smiled, waving shily.
“Okay. I will stay since you are advertising it so nicely.”
“Goodnight, Harry,” he whispered.
“Lovely indeed,” Harry said, bitterly.
“And I have to agree too. They visibly are mad at you because of the whole break up thing. What makes no sense whatsoever, because it was bound to happen, and Ron has a girlfriend anyway. But they are still mad,” Draco said.
His mind felt so fuzzy that he wasn’t sure about as much as his surroundings. It slowly started getting to him. He perfectly knew the ceiling and the white sectioning on his left side where he was staring. It was Hospital Wing. It clicked in his head only few moments after that what had happened. He had lunch with Blaise, he headed back to the castle, but Carrow and few other Slytherins tagged after him. The rest was like a black hole in his head. He couldn’t remember anything after that, even if he tried hard.
I love this chapter. But at this point I have been working so many hours straight on it, that it starts to look a bit strange. So, I hope it isn't strange one bit and just as lovely as I think! Now, please enjoy Christmasy chapter at the begining of June!
“Ana cannot! Mistress and Master forbid for Young Master to ever leave.”
“I’m not sure. Harry found you on his way back from Hogsmeade. You were beaten up and jinxed. He went straight to Headmistress once Madame Pomfrey took care of you, and I came. Do you remember anything?”
It was almost embarrassing, again, as the movie ended and just now he got to see that most watchers were children, but he decided to not care. The Grinch fella movie was the best thing he had ever seen, no matter if it was for kids or not. He had the time of his life, with Harry, and nothing could spoil it.
This letter will not be a part of this (frankly ridiculous) chain of arguments -- which I am clearly gaining the upper hand on, let's face it -- that we are having, but will actually be a missive addressed from a member of the Department of Mysteries to the Head of the DMLE, for whom the following content holds some relevance. Believe it or not, I find that this ridiculous letter is preferable to having to appear in your office in the form of a green head in the fireplace that I know you still haven’t managed to barricade properly
Trying to bum a free meal off of me, Potter?
Sincerely,
Anyways, this paper thing you’ve forced us all to resort to is INANE – not that I’m very frequently thrust into the position of having to contact you, seeing as the Unspeakables are (thankfully) yet to be submitted under the supreme and all-encompassing rule of the DMLE.
p.p.p.s
Actually, let me remedy that right now – am ripping off another page from this ridiculous pad and owling HR for his file. Until then, any way the message could be delivered to him in a more upfront way than a wrapped, tied, and thoughtfully chosen gift?
Apparently, there’s been a moderate fluctuation in the wolfsbane trade with Poland and they’ve chalked it up to a budget problem with transportation across borders – see Appendix 6 in the file attached for information on shared long-distance portkey locations in Germany. It doesn’t merit much commentary except for the fact that there’s been a recent breakthrough in one of the labs in Krakow about how to reverse the creation of wolfsbane using a new type of magically aided distillation, meaning that some of the rare ingredients being used to craft it, primarily aconite, will be able to be retrieved from the finished formulae.
But at least we have  Draco's and Harry's relationship going somewhere and Daco's stutter getting better around him!
In the perfect world, his parents would be angry just for a moment, and come to terms with it, support him. They would let him stay at the Manor as long as he needed, supporting him financially and mentally. He would get his Potioneer diploma, open his little Apothecary and move out to his own place, with the baby. And he would be perfectly happy with her or him, having his dream job.
“I am good, thank you.”
“Are you sure, darling? We could reschedule,” she said carefully.
It was just a little painful to watch Harry as he played with his godson, unaware of the things that were going on in Draco’s life, that would much affect his own. And it certainly didn’t help how he felt little flutters in his belly. He wondered if he should tell Harry. Just sprang it on him, not caring about anything else. But something stopped him. Maybe some sort of trauma from before the summer, or simply because Harry said himself he wasn’t ready to be in a relationship with him. And having a baby was far over being in a relationship, wasn’t it?
“I-I want to be left alone,” he whispered, interrupting him.
Pushing the idea of the evening all way back to his mind, he worked busily through the cooking.
“Let’s meet at the painting of that white dog. At ten thirty,” he whispered.
Eventually Draco withdrew, but not too far. They faces were close, eyes locked together. Harry never took his hands off his body, and so didn’t Draco. They were silent, just staring at each other, and he had a strong urge to move his eyes down Harry’s face, to see his big lips framed with two days of hair growth. He wanted so badly to have the brown-haired man pull him in closer, to seal their lips together in the comforting kiss. So they knew they were there for each other. That no shadows of the past and no expectations of future were of concern. That there was just two of them there, no worries.
“You will get rid of it. I will not have some bastard child ruining our family. It would be a final straw-“
Harry looked utterly shocked and he couldn’t continue drawing his face anymore, so he focused on unruly hair.
“I-I’ve b-been he…here long en-enough.”
am civil. He isn’t. I don’t know what is wrong with him. We were arguing constantly, it wasn’t working and
Harry rolled his eyes at her words before he took to walk down the path, fiercely stuffing hand in his pocket, the other rocking the basket. They both followed him.
“Convinced?” Draco asked.
“Really?” Harry asked, not hiding a small smile.
“That is seven subjects.”
“Looking for someone?” Blaise’s voice brought him back to earth before he could decide to flee the party. “Come, dance with me.”
“So,” they both said at once, and they both shied away quickly.
He pushed the chair from his desk and got onto it, tip-toeing to get to a well-hidden wooden box from the back of the cabinet, filled with books and miscellaneous items. He opened it, looking through the content. Precisely as he remembered there were six Galleons there, that he gathered throughout the years. It was mainly gold that he found around the house. Be it dropped by his father or guests, or lying under the shelf in the library, or being a bookmark in one of the old books.
“Oh, but she left three days ago! She and Teddy left to visit her friends in Devon. Did she forget you were coming to see her? And who are, darling?”
"I know. I am anxious too, but we still have time and we are doing all we can."
“She is asking how are you if we could send her a scan photo. And she would like to come for dinner,” Andromeda added, unsure.
Eagerly, he pushed away all the books and parchments, letting Hermione present him with the food. What surprised him was the fact that she got food for herself too. It wasn’t that uncommon lately for her to be spending dinner time with him, missing it completely or going to the Great Hall at the end. But they never ate together in the library. It was Draco-sort-of-thing.
Draco rolled his eyes, smiling softly, his chest heavy with emotion. If it was possible to love Harry even more, he felt he just might.
“Draco?” a soft whisper came from few feet away.
“Alth…”
“Harry, I’ve got something for you,” he said, shy.
“I am. Trust me. It will be nice. Much nicer than eating Christmas dinner here with teachers. That I would very much like to avoid.”
Blaise didn’t comment, just nodded. They spend a good hour just talking as the uncomfortable silence and tension finally melted away. But Draco couldn’t say that things were the same as before. Everything changed because of Blaise’s intentions and Draco’s condition. It wasn’t the same anymore.
Draco laid on his side, eyes fixed on Harry’s face still, Salem moving to sit at the edge of the balcony. It hurt him to see him like that. Harry went through a lot in his life, things that were known by public were harsh enough, not to mention bits and pieces that Draco heard. Harry deserved to be happy. He didn’t deserve some mediocre relationship, didn’t deserve being left alone to struggle in silence.
“Yeah … sure,” Harry said dumbfounded, frowning, but followed her nevertheless.
“I’m fine. We can go.”
Another issue was that, after Madame Pomfrey’s insistence, he told Headmistress about his
“You can’t know that. They waited long enough.”
He was leaning against the edge of the bath, covered with water all way to his neck. His hair were wet and brushed back, face also wet and his glasses laid abandoned at the edge of the pool. He looked equally handsome without them, but Draco loved them a little too much, if he was being honest with himself. There was something about them that just said
“You fell down the stairs and hit your head pretty bad. I was meaning to ask you, Mr. Malfoy. Are you sure there was no one else there?”
He could see the point. He really could, but something in him, maybe motherly instincts or whatever, didn’t let him see past it.
“Oh, shush. Now. Let’s eat and finish our homework. I haven’t got a chance to start on mine yet. I stayed behind after classes to discuss the grade I got on my essay.”
Forever Grateful,
He wanted to applause for himself because it did come out pretty great, compared to the previous mumbling.
that got to him. Draco was supposed to leave before the other came, pretending he wasn’t there, and now it was out of the question. He would be sitting at the dinner table with Harry, pretending like nothing was going on.
Just after that she run back to Harry.
“Hope you don’t mind? I just went straight to the kitchen after classes to get food. I was just so … annoyed. If you were going to Arithmancy with us, I swear, Ron got so awful lately and he is constantly o my nerves…”
“I want to do it,” he whispered.
“I won’t,” he repeated sternly.
He opened his eyes, rubbing the lasts of sleep off them. The small boy was standing next to the bed, his white untamed hair and big brown eyes watching him intensely.
He didn’t want to see his mother. It was weeks since
“Yes.”
Ana, hearing it, got up from her chair, pushed it back next to Draco, and climbed back onto it.
Harry’s lips made contact with the exposed skin of his neck, leaving soft kisses, trailing up to the sensitive spot behind his ear. He closed his eyes, melting at the spot, knees budging a bit, so he had to lean against Harry’s chest.
He sat at his spot, blankly staring at the page before him, not bothering to even read it. He couldn’t believe that Hermione was gone from his life, just like that. He was mad at Harry and for most, he didn’t want to see his face any time soon, no matter how hard he was taking their ‘break up’. No matter how things were and turned out to be, they both were his friends, something that he didn’t know too much in his life, and he treasured it deeply. If anything, Hermione was the best friend he ever had. She was so attentive and helpful, always there when he needed her the most. Luna was close to it, but she had a lot on her own plate, and more often than not, she would run away in her little world, trying to show him how easy things were, when in fact they weren’t. There was a thread of understanding between him and Hermione, it seemed they were just on the same page all the time no matter his depressive thoughts at time.
Malfoy drops his gaze to the Penseive once more.
Harry left the café in a daze, with a warm cup of coffee and a pastry.
He watched as Malfoy was led away.
There’s the sound of a drawer slamming shut, followed by a muffled thud. With herculean effort, Harry clambers to his feet. Blindly fumbles around for his glasses to no avail.
Malfoy lets out a string of colorful curses.
Before he has any time to linger on the jarring thought, though, he’s pitching forward once again and falling down, down, down.
“ I mean, “ Malfoy says, almost uncertainly.
He'd mix it with a few drops of vodka and hand the glass to his partner for the night.
**********
Harry breathes in the smell of smoke. Somewhere in the near distance, the sound of sirens pierces the night. He studies the way Draco grips the railing, fingers curled around burnished metal.
“ Oh, “ he says.
” Are you sure you didn’t hit your head on the way out of the Pensieve, Potter? What are you even blabbering on about now? “
The corridors were silent, just as silent as they were during the day. He thought about using up his words right then, whispering feverish wishes into the shadows.
When Draco opens his eyes, blinking against the brightness of the room, Harry holds his breath. This time, he doesn’t draw away. He keeps his hand still against Draco’s face, palm bracketed around the curve of his cheek.
They look at each other, and Harry laughs.
The tears are streaming down Hermione's cheeks now. " Harry, please. Stop. Come home with us. This isn't... "
Malfoy points at the four glass vials tucked in a corner. “ Do you suppose we should—“
“Graham cracker crumbs and crushed pecans,” Draco said without looking up. “It’s called a S’mores hot chocolate.” He pulled out a kitchen torch, and grinned at Harry. “This part is pretty neat.”
The first time the silence is broken, it’s Harry, nudging Malfoy’s shoulder, pointing out a single firefly perched on the ledge between them.
” I get it, alright? You were trying, in your own messed up way, to... “
There are things that linger, even if they come in passing. There’s tea and oranges, and there’s sunlight and happiness. At the center of it all, there’s Draco, and there’s Harry. Summer is dwindling. The days peter out and time erodes memory until one day, those too will be lost.
He still looks pale, and the dark shadows under his eyes are unmistakable, but at least some of the strange feeling in Harry’s chest has dissipated.
“ A meteor shower, “ he whispers, and the words come out sounding like a prayer.
Four.
" I have to go, " he says firmly, despite swaying a little.
Harry’s mouth goes dry, and the rest of the conversation is abruptly forgotten. “Come here, you,” he murmurs. Draco loops an arm around his waist before leaning in—to press a feather-light kiss to his cheek. He ghosts another kiss over the shell of his ear, and Harry makes an inhuman sound.
“Two,” he says, more insistently this time, pulling against the grip on his arm.
Instinct tells him to kick, and he does, flailing wildly in unfamiliar arms as he stares at the faces swimming in front of him. Their lips move, but he can't make sense of their words. He has to go. He fights harder this time, biting and twisting. It's over all too soon when he feels something sharp sinking into his forearm.
He wants to live a lifetime of Saturday afternoons.
If he closed his eyes, he could almost pretend what he held in his fist right then was something else entirely.
“I’m still afraid. Afraid of mucking this up, somehow. Or worse, what if I don’t? That doesn’t make much sense, I know. But what if we do this,” he lets out a harsh breath, “and it’s everything we imagined? Because right now, that’s what scares me the most. Knowing we could have that, but never trying.”
he thinks.
Grey eyes burned with a challenge.
Their weekends are lethargic, the hours slipping by in a blur of calling friends and putting away laundry. In the afternoon, Draco will make tea for two and Harry will sit across from him, watching him measure out twelve grams of tea leaves while the steam kettle screeches on the burner. He pours warm milk into the blue mug and steeps the tea leaves for four minutes, eyes flitting to the clock on the wall every so often.
Harry gawped for a second too long. “Malfoy. Hello. Er, I’d like...a coffee to go. And a bite to eat as well—perhaps a pastry?”
**********
Harry is surprised to hear himself laugh softly.
The tea sends warmth traveling down Harry’s spine. Heat lodges in his chest and wraps around him like a weighted blanket; he tastes honey. When Harry forgets to turn the mug around, he finds the chipped edge enveloped in a protective charm. A few days earlier, Draco grumbled about the stupid blue mug which ought to be thrown out, really. He reminded Harry, not for the first time, of the dozen other mugs they own, none of them lopsided or hazardous.
Malfoy shakes his head.
“ You’re okay now. “
“ Stop looking at me like that, “ Malfoy says exasperatedly on cue. “ I’m not going to bite your head off, Potter. Considering our history, I suppose that
He’s twenty-five years old, and he loves just as desperately. He holds Draco’s face in his hands. He says, I think about you all the time.
he thought,
“Yeah. I mean, Hermione and Ron are having this get-together, and I thought you might want to go—“
again. “
Harry was helplessly endeared.
Draco hums, lips curving into that smile Harry secretly likes best, the one with a bit of teeth showing.
By some unspoken understanding, no one takes on the position of opposing Seeker to challenge him for the coveted Snitch.
“ Yes. Don’t sound so happy about it. “
“Come on,” Harry says. “I made reservations for us at the winery. We should be able to get there in good time, long as we catch the next bus.”
“ Tickets, please, lads, “ the man says gruffly. “ It’s been a long day. “
“ Fine, “ he relents, reaching for the second vial. “ I suppose you’re right. “
At night, Harry replayed the memory in his head over and over; he watched it play out in slow motion and filled in the blanks differently each time. Don’t go, he said. His arm was outstretched, inches away from making contact. Can we stay, just a little longer?
Sometimes, Malfoy brings a book up to the roof to read.
.” Harry.
he thinks.
“I’ll take it you enjoyed the drink, then?” Draco said, eyebrows raised.
He had no idea why Malfoy was working in a Muggle café. He didn’t have the faintest clue as to how Malfoy became a barista, of all things. Part of it was curiosity, but there was something else Harry couldn’t quite place his finger on. The café had a perennial quality to it, a sense of being removed from the bustling streets outside. At the same time, it fit seamlessly into the space it occupied. Maybe it was the ambient music playing softly over the speakers, or maybe it was the way the tables were never empty for long in the afternoons.
“And here I was, thinking those had slipped your mind when I found moldy dishes in the sink last week.”
“ You’re one to talk. You look terrible as well. “
Harry learned to avoid looking at Malfoy’s lips. Instead, he often found himself staring at Malfoy’s hands—he was suddenly hyper-aware of all of the things they did, when Malfoy cracked his knuckles after a long shift, or when he tugged at his earring while deep in thought. He cataloged all of these gestures and filed them away in the back of his mind.
“ That’s not it, “ he says slowly. “ Look, I— “
This time, Malfoy is the one to speak up first.
Harry can’t help but notice that he looks even worse for the wear after their trip through the Penseive.
“ For the love of Merlin! Yes, alright? It was a nightmare I couldn’t shake for years—I even took sleeping potions at one point to try to make it stop. Forgive me for not being eager to discuss this subject any further. “
a voice in the back of his consciousness suggests.
he thinks.
he thinks.
Not a stranger after all.
Harry believes him.
Are you telling me you’re not the least bit curious about how we ended up on this train out of nowhere, with our short term memories wiped? And more importantly, are you seriously not bothered at all? Where is this train even headed? It hasn’t stopped once so far and we have no idea what our tickets say! Also, which— “
Harry Potter was not in love with Draco Malfoy.
he thinks.
Harry moves his hand along the surface, feeling the tiny ridges underneath his fingernails. He traces a thin, jagged line running through the plaster.
**********
“ Alright, “ he says, with an air of confidence he doesn’t entirely feel yet.
Because it hasn’t happened yet, and he has no way of knowing.
it wasn’t supposed to go like this,
of the scissors is accompanied by the almost imperceptible sound of hair falling onto the tiles. Draco brushes a lock of hair away from his nape, and Harry shivers.
he thinks to himself.
“About getting married to me, you tosser.”
“I had two shots, if you recall. Unlike you, who insisted on downing two-thirds of a bottle of chardonnay.”
He’s familiar with wanting—wanting to touch, to hold, to consume. But this is different, somehow. He watches the way Draco sleeps, with knees folded and half of his face pressed into the pillow.
Draco takes pity on him and pushes a warm mug into his hands. “If you hurl on the table, you’re doing the dishes for a week,” he says.
“ Let’s hurry. We’re approaching a station soon. “
For a moment, Harry can feel panic rising in his chest. He hasn’t found any luggage with him, and he has no recollection of buying any ticket in the first place, either, so—
he thinks slowly.
Not knowing where he was headed, he slipped on the Invisibility Cloak over his pajamas and left the dorm in a haze.
If he imagined that what he was chasing after wasn’t a ball, but everything, no,
“ Did we get into a fight with each other? “
When the owls come swooping in, there’s no commotion, no excited shouts and clamoring voices rising one over another.
At the winery, they’re taken on a private tour, and they taste a total of eight wines. Their guide is friendly, welcoming them to the area as she gives a brief history of the place and introduces them to the winemaking process.
“Wicked,” he exhaled. Rubbed the back of his neck. “And just so you know, funnily enough, I do.”
? Admitting there’s something you don’t know about? “
“ But it’s one of my memories, yes, and it wasn’t tampered with or anything in case you were thinking somewhere along that line. It was... a dream I used to have. A recurring one. “
There’s no need for stilted conversation, something Harry finds himself grudgingly appreciating.
Red is danger, blood, and violence, he thinks. It’s lust, love, and passion.
In fact, if he didn’t know any better, he’d almost be tempted to admit that he was enjoying spending time with this version of adult Malfoy.
Harry is speechless.
The torch flickered to life—there was a blaze of orange before it died down to a smaller, hissing blue flame. Draco moved the torch over the mug in a sweeping motion. When he withdrew the flame, the top layer of the marshmallows were browned and melting at the edges.
Frowning, he’s just about to lean forward to tap the man when he’s thrown off balance by an unexpected surge of nausea, sending him crashing none too gently into the back of the mystery man’s seat.
He had a flask of silver grey liquid on his nightstand.
They were confused sometimes, if they happened to catch a glimpse of themselves in the mirror. He'd then quiet them with a forceful kiss which bruised and they'd forget the questions they'd been about to ask.
Saying his name out loud felt like a minor revelation. It came with surprising ease—the transition from one name to another. He wondered if this was what it meant to know someone, to have their name roll off your tongue without resistance. Draco refused to call him by his first name, but pink bloomed across his cheeks the first time Harry said his.
It looked good on him. Malfoy looked every bit like he’d just stepped out of a cologne ad, in a collared navy button-up and dress pants. He was also wearing an apron.
He doesn’t know how long they end up staying at the bar, but by the time he’s home, he has no recollection of getting there.
Sometimes, there will be a hint of a smile afterwards- an upward tilt of the lips or a crinkling of the eyes. Those letters, the ones bearing good news, are carefully folded and tucked away in their pockets.
He’d save six, no, twenty, words for Hermione and Ron at breakfast.
He’s grateful there are no probing questions, not even when he stays behind long after everyone else has left for dinner, only a bottle of water and a towel waiting for him in the locker room.
He knows what it means to fall for someone: to want more than what the hands can hold. He lies in bed next to Draco, cups his face between quivering palms, and wants to wake up the same way again and again. He slots his fingers with Draco’s, cradles the fluttering pulse under his thumb, and wants to keep holding on, never loosening his grip.
“ And you’re expecting me to just
“Well, ‘Mione’s been there. She was just telling us about it the other day, how her parents took her one summer and she’s always wanted to go back. Says the place is gorgeous, and the seafood is brilliant.” He shrugs. “There’s a winery we could go to. It’s not far from the villa, they’re open for booked tours and wine tastings. I thought you’d fancy that.”
He’s never seen anything like it before.
He sucks in a sharp breath.
After that, the words flow between them.
“I’ve been thinking,” Harry says. He’s tipsy, and the bar is far too inviting.
“ We will. “
There’s a brief pause.
He can’t seem to get enough air.
Harry smiles.
There’s a slight draft coming in through the window; the drapes are billowing. Harry collapses onto the duvet, and Draco grabs hold of his feet, tugs the trainers off. Instead of tossing them to the side like Harry would have, he places them neatly by the foot of the bed.
He bit back a smile. “Not half bad, actually.”
“ What... was that, exactly? Was it one of your memories? “
It was July when they found him.
Harry will watch Draco bite into the clementine. He watches the juice running down his wrist; it drips from his knuckles and pools on the table. They will clean up later, wipe away the sticky residue.
**********
“Can’t sleep?” The words are stifled by a yawn as he steps onto the balcony, rubbing his eyes.
They sank beneath the surface, down, down, down, until there was nothing but distorted light and the taste of chlorine. Harry moved through the water, towards Draco, who met him somewhere in the middle.
Harry showed up a third, fourth, and fifth time—he kept coming back.
He prayed with everything left that the spell would find its way to Potter.
**********
The third memory is red.
stares at him a little too long sometimes.
“I’m okay,” he told her.
He forgets why he’s on the Astronomy Tower with Draco Malfoy at two in the morning.
The moment their hands are intertwined, Harry feels a strange sense of deja vu wash over him, and he shudders involuntarily.
He could never remember the details of the kiss: how long it lasted, whether his eyes were open or shut, if he had his hand on Draco’s neck or if his fingers were tangled in Draco’s hair. All he knew was that when it was over, he drew away too quickly. There was a moment where they were both suffocating, still close enough to bridge the distance, before Draco drifted away, and Harry was drowning at the bottom of the pool.
This is what he remembered: there was light, and there was music. He was floating in the pool, wet clothes clinging to his body like a second skin. He could hear someone calling his name, and when he opened his eyes, Draco was there, standing under the moon.
“Alright,” he says.
He’s fairly certain he’s able to distinguish dream from reality by now—he’s thirty seven, after all, and he’s been practicing ever since he could remember, being no stranger to nightmare plagued sleep.
In the near distance, a tooting horn signal sounds, and Harry begins to question if he’s somehow stuck in a bizarre dream or hallucination.
Harry ducks his head, trying to keep from fidgeting. “Listen, there’s something I’ve got to tell you.
“It’s a- “
Draco sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose with his free hand. “Potter, come on,” he says. “Your room is just around the corner.”
Hermione gives Ron a small jab in the shoulder with her pen just as his head begins to droop, and immediately his back straightens again.
“ What? “ he demands, eyes narrowing.
Malfoy lifts a hand to his face in surprise.
He settles cross-legged on the bathroom floor, hands splayed against the tiles.
He was somewhat surprised, too: he’d never have pegged Malfoy as a cat person. Back at Hogwarts, Malfoy didn’t have any pets, though Harry did remember his eagle owl—a hefty, tawny-eyed bird—for some reason.
Malfoy glares at him.
He saw him then. And their eyes met.
” Ask me again. “
They both cry. They don't think he notices, but he does. He wants to tell them it's okay, but he doesn't.
, he'll say into the darkness. The words are almost like an incantation. He savors the way they taste on his tongue.
“If you could be anywhere in the world right now,” Harry says.
He tries, and fails, to remember the last thing he’d been doing before he found himself in this strange situation.
“ Perhaps we could get a cup of coffee together after this ordeal. “
Draco leaves mugs of half-drunk tea all over the house. He makes a cuppa in the morning while perusing the newspaper, then promptly forgets about the unfinished tea as he’s making a fresh pot an hour later. They have more than a dozen mugs in the kitchen, and the pantry is dedicated to an assortment of tea leaves. Harry likes the sweet and spicy ginger chai; Draco is partial to the lavender Earl Grey with citrus undertones.
(“Sports were pretty intense at our school,” he told Alex. “We were on different teams, but we used to play in the same position. Draco could never stand losing to me. Believe it or not, we used to have a bit of a rivalry going on.”)
A flash of blinding light.
Malfoy. He's still in the flat. He imagines the blonde sprawled out on his bed, all graceful limbs and sculpted, slender body. He thinks about the taste of his skin, the way his mouth fits perfectly on his neck. The sunlight will catch on his platinum hair and bathe him in an otherworldly glow. God, he hates him.
He holds out his hand. “I can certainly think of worse ways to spend the rest of my life.”
He feels uncomfortable—he knows he’s seeing a different side of Malfoy.
The last memory has no color.
“ Look, “ he says suddenly, breathless.
He only means to tease the other man a little—and yet it comes out sounding a little more accusing than he’d intended.
“The truth, as I’ve come to realize, is that I’m not brave at all.” Harry twists his napkin in his hands. “At least not when it comes to this.”
His pupils dilated in the evening shadows. " I cast my Patronus. That's why. "
Unblemished by clouds and veiled in a porcelain sheen, an air of threadbare chilliness bled slowly from the horizon. He stood amongst a tight huddle of others. The light was an unrelenting stream of energy etching itself into the back of his mind, even through firmly shuttered eyelids. A blaze of white against an artist's black canvas, perhaps. Or a comet in the night sky.
These days, it seems, Harry thinks about Draco a lot.
He’s just witnessed something personal, something which wasn’t meant for anyone, probably, much less him.
Harry drops his face into his arms.
The coffee shop sat between a hardware store and a vintage boutique, tucked away in an alley. The interior exuded an understated charm—it was furnished with oak tables, the brick walls clad with framed photos and hanging ivy.
He points out certain passages from time to time, and learns to decipher the looks he gets in return.
He forces his eyes open again. Swings his legs over the side of the bed he's lying in. Ignores the stabbing headache pulsing in his skull constantly. Someone notices him.
“ Of course that’s the first thing you’d say to me, “ he snorts.
“We went to school together,” he said.
“That sounds good,” he says. “I think I know what you mean.”
This time, he thinks he catches a familiar smirk before he's descending into darkness again.
The ambulance passes by in a blur of pulsing red lights; it’s gone before Harry has time to look away. The back of his eyelids burn with white-hot intensity. His pulse is thundering in his ears—at times he feels as though the earth might give way beneath his feet.
His cheeks are slightly flushed as his voice rises, and it’s only then that Harry notices the bruise on his jawbone.
They nod and squeeze his hands. He never misses the way Hermione's shoulders shake as they leave, Ron's arms wrapped protectively around her. He sees the way her face crumples ever so slightly when he tells them he loves him. He can't fathom why, though.
The previously clear liquid begins to glow as soon as it touches the Penseive, taking on an enticing golden hue and swirling around slowly.
“And what if I am?”
The scent of oranges and tea lingers in the air long after the table has been cleared.
scared.
“Quit squirming,” Draco says, exasperation bleeding through the words.
“ One more to go, Potter. “
Harry represses the urge to laugh in his face, somehow.
Wordlessly, they join hands, and fall once more.
He looks up at the person who has been anchoring him all this time, and says, softly, “ Draco. “
His arms are gently pried away from his face.
The parallels hurt his head to think about too closely.
Draco doesn’t answer right away. He hums in lieu of a response, taking a long drag from the cigarette pinched between his thumb and forefinger.
Letters are opened without fanfare, with an almost clinical detachment.
It’s foreign—and not one that he even vaguely recognizes.
In his dreams, he never made it to the surface. He swam after Draco, but the pool kept deepening, and the water threatened to swallow him whole.
Harry thinks to himself, grabbing the one closest to him.
Malfoy! He shouts.
The front door jingled as he pushed it open, and he was immediately greeted by a blast of warm air. The café was busier than usual, which hardly came as a surprise; it was that time of the year, after all—Christmas holidays. London was bustling with life: the traffic was even worse than usual, the streets were crowded with commuters, and shops everywhere were lit up late into the night.
The tears shone in her wide, frightened eyes.
Gradually, his mind goes blank.
The voice is right by his ear.

Quidditch practice is postponed indefinitely, but Harry heads out after classes each day, as do a handful of others.

He spotted Harry, Ginny, Luna and Neville in place where she was sitting.
“Yes. You are welcomed to join.”

“Of course I am. Actually, it’s him that said it first. We tried to talk it out and pretended like we did, but I know we didn’t, and it’s high time it ended. I have more important things going on right now, like NEWTs, worrying about internship, getting into good program. I don’t need fighting and worrying about Ron.”
Ron seemed surprised, and he was a bit too. It wasn’t like he would make a fool of himself. He knew how to play chess. Even perfectly so. If it wasn’t reading or sorry attempts at drawing and painting, he had spent long hours playing chess, and reading books on chess if he was stuck in the game or failed to win. His mother, tired of his plays with House Elves, that would go cry to her about ‘Master Draco was forcing them to put up a real fight in a game with him’, purchased him the most splendid, hand-crafted chess set, that was enchanted to be an opponent on its own. Opponent very hard to beat, that is. So, he had his fair share of practice.
Draco’s heart fluttered a bit more when he was standing in the reptile section, so close to Harry that he could feel the taller man’s breath on the back of his neck, as he listened to the story of his first visit to the zoo and how he let the python loose. But he reassured Draco there would be no snakes running free today.
They never really talked about getting more intimate than kisses and what they did that one time during their picnic, but they both felt like distance was needed here. They didn’t feel quiet ready to cross that line.
“I’m not going to do it, Mother!”
But those things weren’t for Draco to know. There were for friends that had been there, like Ron and Hermione. They were intimate details that he would tell Ginny when they were alone, together, when she would hug him and kiss it better, protecting him from the awful memories, and assuring that it was in the past and now, and future were way more bright.

Draco settles into his little life at the little village, trying to put his mind in order.
He smiled even wider before moving to previous position.
“Oh,” was all he could think to say.
“What?”
“Coffee would be nice. Black with two sugars.”

any one-night stands. So I’m genuinely lost as to what the answer to your (vaguely inappropriate for a work correspondence, but let’s face it, this is long past the maginot line of coworkerly vendetta at this point) question would be.
After Harry summoned Kreacher to have him keep an eye on Draco, he left. It was strange to stay in someone else’s house, not exactly sure when they would be back, and knowing you
With a small smile on his face he continued reading, Harry never stopped him, only listed in attentively. It was a bit surreal, but so nice at the same time. Having Harry so close to him shouldn’t feel this way. It was nothing but a friendly gesture. There were people that were touchy by nature, and Harry must have been such. But he couldn’t shake off this warm feeling that lingered due to that.
He opened the present, revealing set of books on Herbology. He had read one of them already, having borrowed it from Neville, but others he never heard about. He got the second box that was much lighter, but not much, and bigger. It turned out to be box from polished wood. He could see Harry staring at him intensely as he proceed to open it. Inside he found pieces of fine parchment and many drawing supplies and also small set of watercolors and various brushes. Just a glimpse and he knew how good-quality and price they were. It was from the Owl Post store. He had couple of pencils and pieces of parchment from there, but looking at the price range and how his purchases were strictly followed and arts were frowned upon, he never got a chance to get all the supplies he wanted. But now he did have them all.
“She did. I didn’t like it.”
Fully intending to cry the whole night and planning how to avoid Hermione and Harry, he took his things and stormed to the Dungeons. He was so sad, for so many reasons. Primarily because of the situation, but as he calmed down eventually, blaming it all on sadness of them both, he couldn’t stop thinking about Harry’s past. He wanted to hear more, to be able to comfort him. Harry didn’t tell him all that much, only some bits and pieces, but it sounded horrible enough for him. It looked like his stupid excuse of a childhood traumas weren’t adequate. Harry had it hard, so much harder than anyone else he knew, than he himself. And he was stupidly pitying himself, thinking he had anything bad.
“I think she invited Granger too, but she didn’t come,” Blaise said.
It wasn’t all that big of a lie. He was excited about working his dream job. He was just a bit more excited about having their baby.
“Know what?”
I had. My parents’ house went to ruin, and Grimmauld Place was Sirius’s childhood home. Even though he resented it. It was place he grew up in, and which he left for me. So, I decided to do what he was trying so hard to do while living there. Renovate, making sure it looks nothing like the awful, old place it was. So, this is what I’m doing. I got rid of all the awful paintings, and believe me when I tell you they were awful. It was very tricky, and it felt as if I was murdering someone, but I never felt better in my life than when I was hammering down his mother’s portrait. She was … not the most pleasant person.”
she meant him.
“I will sleep in Sirius’s old bedroom. It’s only livable place beside this one,” Harry said.
He was shaking with nerves when the Monday came. He woke up to nausea first thing in the morning, and didn’t even make it to the door before he had a puking spree to the rubbish bin for good part of an hour. He wasn’t sure if it was nerves or all of suddenly pregnancy symptoms decided to kick in, but he prayed for the first option. Last thing he needed now was upset stomach and puking every five minutes. NEWTs were only a week away, and he needed all the focus he could get.
“Did you know your mother was inviting Weasleys and Potter?”
“Well, it ends badly and she was posing for a nude, so … I will just shut up. But
“How am I suppose to let her know that I’m here, then?”
“It’s so good to see you, Draco. It has been too long. Shall we sit?”
He would very much like to tell him the reason. But, if Harry didn’t want to be with him, he didn’t want him to be in a relationship with him just because of the baby. He wasn’t sure if Harry’s therapy worked if he looked out for himself now. He wasn’t going to risk Harry doing a decent thing. For now.
They sat down and Hermione started unpacking the basket that must have been enchanted to hold all of its content. It turned out to be a small feast, a little bit too big for only four, with big variety of foods, and Draco’s favorite dessert of strawberry shortbread with whipped cream. With stomachs filled with food, slightly aching in some cases, they proceed to the after-lunch lounging that there never was time for at Hogwarts, as they would usually rush to their next periods. But today the Charms and Arithmancy were cancelled so, they’ve decided to take the opportunity and leave for the picnic. That was also why Weaselette wasn’t with them. She still had classes. Not that Draco minded. The least he saw there, the better.
“You know French? That must be fun. Mind reading me a bit?”
He could feel the tension in the dining room, maybe see it if he tried hard enough. But nothing happened yet. He was pushing around his eggs on the plate, not feeling one bit hungry, still vividly remembering the morning sickness that woke him up at five, and wouldn’t go away for hours. His mother was sitting on the opposite side of him, drinking her morning tea and looking through the Daily Prophet with such a power that she didn’t need words.
“Yes and yes. I was wondering … can you tell me about Sirius? It seems he was a big part of your life, and I don’t know much about him.”
Draco felt a bit foolish as sudden tears prickled his eyes. He  quickly blinked them off, before intertwining his fingers with Harry’s. He didn’t like thinking about the past, especially the darkest years and certain people. Like this one.
Before Harry could say more, he pulled him to the ground, laying next to him. Harry smiled softly, placing the gentlest kiss on his cheek.
“No,” she assured. “Nothing of this sort. I thought you may be already familiar with the situation, but is seems you are not. Mr. Malfoy, you are pregnant,” she said, carefully.
He exchanged the basket for trembling, miserable looking Salem. The way poor cat looked at him made Draco laugh. It was cruel of him, but, oh well.
“Because it would be even worse. McGonagall won’t do anything. It will be just like that until school ends.”
“Yes. I felt awful, though. Madame Pomfrey said I had internal bleeding and broken leg. I … I can’t even imagine walking back into the Dungeon. It’s just horrifying.”
“I can make dinner tonight. You have an appointment with Teddy today anyway,” he said.
Hermione was going to be in training for healers and working at the Ministry, so there wouldn’t be much time for him nonetheless. Harry, well, he had his life. He was already signed for an Auror program with Ron, and they would be starting shortly after school. Not that him and Harry would ever see each other again. Harry would be married before the year was over, he had no doubt. He knew how much pressure he was getting from almost everyone in Weasley family. Draco could see them having a December wedding, maybe even sooner than that, an Autumn one. And then probably a baby just next summer. So, it wouldn’t be like Harry would care about some mediocre lover he had in school, when he was a working family man, someone he dreamed of being.
Harry sat there for a moment longer and it seemed that he wanted to say something else, but words and logic failed him. Eventually he just lifted from his chair and left, eyes fixed on the floor and it weirdly looked as if Harry wasn’t really there.
Blaise was one of these few people he didn’t want to lie to, but there was no way of telling him the truth. Blaise was an honorable pureblood. He would no doubt turn his back on Draco too, once he knows.
“Not really. It’s just … they all hate me,” he said, quietly, avoiding Blaise’s eyes.
October 1981. At least now I can go visit their grave. I couldn’t do it with everything going on. I was seventeen when I went there for the first time. It’s a bit weird because it’s hard to grief over someone you never knew. But they were my parents, my family. My mother basically sacrificed herself for me, which for a long time I questioned but that’s beside the point, and I kept hearing all those things about them, how amazing people they were. The most I regret that I don’t have much more to remember them by. I have only few photos and a piece of memories from Snape’s past. Which weren’t all that pleasant memories.”
She presented him with an envelope that already has been opened. He took the parchment out of it. It was a very simple invitation. Wedding invitation as he read. To Charlie Weasley and  Blyth Thompson’s, to be exact. It was to be held at the Burrow on 5
Scowling, Harry drops his middle finger. He remembers watching a rerun of some reality show with Draco last night, ordering Pad Thai, and getting spectacularly drunk. Maybe not in that order.
