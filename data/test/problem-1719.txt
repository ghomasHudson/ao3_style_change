Sitting inside the vial is a reddish-brown chrysalis and Draco immediately recognizes it as belonging to the Death’s Head Hawk Moth.
“A thestral…” Harry says, watching the creature so often seen as dark and monstrous glow like a star. “It’s perfect.”
“All prophecy files are kept in the same cabinet. It will lead you there,” Mr. Davis explains dreamily, voice distant as ever.
These nights are the worst, but are thankfully few and far between. Sometimes, back home, when Ada sleeps through him waking up and he slips out to the living room Mrs. Nubble will come out of her office and make him chamomile tea that is more honey than broth. Other times Mr. Nubble might hear him and come out and watch some late-night cartoons until he falls back asleep.
“I know a buuuunch about Papa’s side! He’s mostly Swedish and we make Swedish meatballs on his birthday and have a bunch of Swedish horses all over the house from my Grandmama. She says she wants to take us all to Sweden one day to visit!”
half the time?!” Potter explodes, throwing his arm that was not hit with Draco’s jinx around in a desperate manner. “They say Voldemort wants a weapon and they’re guarding it. Okay, what weapon? Oh, lovely, you won’t tell me and I have to be left to wonder and worry what’s going on? Great! Because THAT hasn’t happened before!”
“Except Umbridge’s office,” Weasley mumbles, but stills when the table focuses on him. Harry, especially, has a sharp look to his eyes that worries Draco. “Uh… y’know, cause her floo isn’t observed? It’s why me and Malfoy could travel to the Ministry before? Floo calls would be ignored from there, too.”
Max’s mother just about beams down at Draco and Draco thinks that this must be where Max got their own smile from. “That’s a great goal, Draco,” she praises, making Draco puff up even more, just barely keeping his own grin down. “I promise to cheer you on the whole way.”
That’s what anyone would find if they dug around in it, anyway, but Draco has slipped a small concealing charm on the exterior pockets where he keeps his shrunken down Muggle things.
For a second Harry is silent, and then he’s turning towards Weasley and asking innocently, “Hey, do you hear something?”
Whoever those people were, whatever they had been doing, there was no doubt in Draco’s mind what he’d just seen.
“We know so little about actual Divination, though,” Draco says, head tilting slightly back to look up at the ceilings. “Divination is a real thing, but it is still a massive mystery how it works and who can make it work. That’s why the class is such a mess. Professor Trelawney is apparently a real seer, but that doesn’t mean it is something that can be passed on. Divination is, basically, a talent, not a skill.”
Draco scowls at the thought of Quidditch. He loved flying, but the concept of being out in the open where anyone could get to him was a concerning one… Then again, maybe since it was so public he would be a bit safer?
“Sounds like some kind of disease,” Frederick says, brows furrowed in thought, and Mrs Nubble gives the table at large a withering look. The letter is finished not long after that and they all, Mr Nubble included, follow her to the front door and watch from the porch as she makes her way to the mailbox. This whole debacle had become the highlight of their mornings, after all, they didn’t want to miss anything.
“I’m alive,” the blonde wheezes and Ron slowly lowers him down until he can be placed on the ground safely. He feels terribly dizzy as he sits up straight, blood rushing back to the rest of his body, and a moment later Hermione is barreling into his side and hugging him.
“I hadn’t thought of any of that,” Harry admits lamely, head bowed, and Draco presses his hand a little more firmly against his back. None of them had thought about that. None of them except, apparently, Cecil Duke.
Potter laughs so hard he ends up pressing his forehead to Draco’s shoulder, their rhythm getting thrown off momentarily but Draco, who can’t stop snickering himself, gets them back on track.
They climb and climb and climb until they’re passing through dark cloud vapor, the pitch far below them. Draco’s breath puffs in front of his face, which is surprising, since it really shouldn’t be that cold up here, but he hard;y cares.
to say anything,” Draco snaps, still glaring at Ron and ignoring the twins. “You promised you’d stay quiet!”
“I feel kind of embarrassed,” the Gryffindor admits, chuckling sheepishly and scratching at his cheek. “What Daphne and Astoria have done is astounding! But… none of this, not even a little bit, ever even crossed my mind.”
Draco flips through the pages and stops on a page nearly at the end. He smirks at it eagerly. “This one’s one of my favorites,” he says and Potter, yet again, leans in close.
“The yellow ones?” Eve says in disbelief, clearly displeased by the color choice more than the animal in question.
They momentarily get caught up in a conversation with Max’s father, unable to avoid him forever, when they find themselves in front of a table covered in strange machines. They have knobs and switches and gauges. “Radio and Navigation” is the name of the display and Max’s father opens up his big bag full of wonders to show Draco a black device the size of a brick. He hands one to Draco and pulls out another that looks exactly the same.
When he leaps up onto Potter’s bed to show himself off, Mrs. Weasley takes a nervous step back while Granger and Weasley are looking him over in interest.
Potter ducks his head, hiding behind his mess of curls, and mumbles, “That’s not fair… Damn it, that’s not fair at all.” The Boy-Who-Lived takes a deep, shaky breath before looking up at his godfather, a new, stubborn light in his eyes.
“No, it will only take you to the Ministry,” Draco explains, pouring the rest of the powder into his own hand and pocketing the empty vial. They wouldn’t need any for the trip back. Both of them knew the floos at the Ministry were always charged and working, no powder necessary.
Harry falls silent, looking down at his shoes as he scuffs them on the stone floor, and Draco rolls his eyes skyward. “Alright, well, whatever, I’m going to go eat dinner with Slytherin for once. I won’t force you to, but I would quite like it if you came with me, seeing as you’re my only friend over there.” With that Draco turns away and marches back into the Great Hall, back straight and stride confident. He offers a nod towards Hermione when he sees her, and she smiles back as he makes his way to his house’s table.
“But…” Draco sighs, defeated. “But we have no evidence he is the murderer. We know he buried the body, but it had been a bone at the time. He may have thought it was one of Fang’s and brought it over, for all we know. He doesn’t seem the type to do overtly kind gestures in the light of day.”
Draco had looked at the ticket many times since he had gotten it, trying to sort out where such a platform could be, and couldn’t come up with a proper answer. He figured, however, once he got to the station, he would be able to sort it out on his own, confident in his skills of observation.
He hears Granger call out about their own bags, but Draco ignores them, pulling Potter along through the crowded aisles.
“I never claimed to agree with every detail of the wizarding world. I doubt fame at such a young age could do anyone any good,” McGonagall replies, obviously not impressed by Draco’s outburst, but being patient with him.
“What? What’s it say?” Weasley demands, trying to see from his own bed but failing miserably. Draco smirks, clearly without this issue, and leans sideways to read the article over Harry’s shoulder.
“Mind your own business,” he snaps on impulse and the house elf quickly ducks her head. She doesn’t cower like Dobby used to, just curls up into silent acceptance. She doesn’t even punish herself, waiting to allow her masters to do it themselves, and somehow that feels so, so much worse.
No one knew how Seers came to be. No one knew where their visions came from. Of all the realms of magic the Department of Mysteries researched the Seers didn’t dip into any of them, as far as they could tell.
Having heard just about enough Dumbledore orders McGonagall and Snape to keep watch, the two agreeing immediately, as Dumbledore leads Potter, Draco, and Sirius towards his office.
“What?! What is the meaning--” Umbridge begins, yanking at her wand and moving to stand, but Draco hears Ginny interrupt her.
Quidditch is amazing. He wishes he could stay up in the air, laughing and jeering forever. He is only shaken out of his giddy euphoria when a surge of cheers surrounds him and he hears the tail end of Lee Jordan’s, “--with Potter and Ward after it!”
“Wait, wait, then why are you learning the bones of the body… If you are not required to know them?” Draco questions, eyes narrowing as he looks at the radio.
“No, no, it should be pale orange before we put in the mistletoe berries,” Hermione cuts her off and Pansy’s lips curl back unhappily. She usually is smiling when she’s being wicked or nasty, and only now does Draco realize how much that takes away some of the bite from her thoughtless comments.
“Look into Polyjuice Potion activity, yes, yes, I heard you, but are you aware how taxing this is on me? You certainly rely on my… skills, quite a bit,” Skeeter flutters her lashes and looks Draco up and down thoughtfully. “It would do you good to consider an Animagus form, since you find them so useful.”
“Not gadgets,” he admits, “I won’t step on your big toes.” Vivian wasn’t big as in tall, but she was short and stout, and now that Draco was this close to her, he could see she had arms as thick as some of the players on the Quidditch team. “I like the idea of making new spells, though.”
If someone decides to become an Animagus the legal way they are required to go through a series of classes with Professor McGonagall during their third year. Most of this is preparing the actual potion, doing research, and being taught everything that could possibly go wrong.
“Still on the fence with you,” Weasley says lowly, turning his glare now towards Draco, who gives him a dry look before pulling out a bag of PopRocks from his bag and holding them out in silence. Weasley eyes them dubiously, before growling and snatching the bag away. “A short fence,” he amends grumpily as he opens the bag.
“Oh no, no, no, no, no, this won’t do at all!” Max’s father says frantically, looking even more horrified than Max had, and he crouches down in front of Draco. “Why do you think the moon landing isn’t real?”
What Draco did know was that all jobs previously planned to go to Moody had been allocated to other professors or faculty. Dumbledore had told him that a while back when they had met in his office to talk about his findings.
The Gryffindors glance around at each other, anxious, and Granger slowly sits back down. The mood in the room has become a lot tenser, now. “What changed?” the muggleborn asks.
And, hesitantly, considering Peter Pettigrew’s escape the year prior and the Death Eaters at the Quidditch World Cup, Draco couldn’t just ignore the possibility of You-Know-Who’s involvement. If anyone wanted Potter dead, it would be him.
“Max, specify what you--” Draco cuts himself off when a familiar shadow appears at the top of the path that leads down to Hagrid’s hut, and all cheer immediately leaves Draco. “Potter’s here. I’ll talk to you later, Max.”
“Be that as it may,” McGonagall waves off the surprised look on Draco’s face. Had she seriously just agreed with that? “We are not here to gossip.”
Sensing Draco is no longer needed for this conversation, he instead moves around the herd, snapping pictures and moving towards Theodore and Lucky.
The Gryffindor common room is circular and warm, both in temperature and in color. Red and gold decorations hang everywhere with squishy-looking chairs and couches. The fire blazes in the hearth, despite the hour, and rugs cover a dark, wood floor. Draco will admit likes it, it’s charming, though he definitely prefers the cool, metaphorical blanket that is Slytherin’s living quarters.
“I don’t like you and Malfoy teaming up,” the bespectacled Gryffindor mumbles and Weasley throws his arms out wide.
“Patronus Charm,” Draco says simply. “And you counter a Patronus Charm with a Militus Charm. Whichever is stronger wins.”
Hermione smacks closed the book she’s looking in with an unhappy frown and sets it to the side, grabbing another from the pile. Draco can’t tell what the title is because the girl sets it down on the table and begins pouring over it immediately, furiously looking for an explanation they never find.
They meander through the halls of Hogwarts for some time, never going to Ravenclaw Tower and never moving too far away from Umbridge’s office. Draco isn’t sure if Edgecombe is having second thoughts or stalling.
“I don’t know,” Blaise says, sitting on his bed, legs crossed, and leaning his elbows on his knees in a leisurely position. “The Ministry clearly is if they’re sending their members to look after a
By the time they return to the castle, Draco’s study session a lost cause and a motionless abraxan figurine in his pocket, they both are still humming their respective songs, Potter has pimples tipped with wasp stingers, and Draco’s hairs are snakes that won’t stop biting his nose.
Movement catches both of the boys’ attentions and they look up just in time to see Lily walking over to them. At some point she had slipped away from the High Table and was now keeping herself low as she approached her son. As soon as she was close she tugged the boy into a quick hug then crouched between him and Draco, eyes worried.
Potter’s hearing had been moved an entire hour earlier, a clear attempt to go ahead and expel the boy without giving him a fighting chance. Still, Potter arrived, along with Dumbledore and a squib woman Draco did not know.
he’s a human, and he’s laid out… He takes a moment to twist his head back and forth… He’s laid out in the Hogwarts infirmary.
Apparently, someone had let slip that they would be getting his personal files soon - whether that was the goblins or the twins, Skeeter couldn’t tell - and he had panicked and come here. Once he’d found his files with Mr. Davis’s help, he’d quietly gone through them.
Now Sirius reads it, Potter peaking over his shoulder to get a look, and begins laughing. The letter gets passed around the table, Weasley near falling out of his chair in mirth. Any kind of distress to a Malfoy was good enough for a Weasley.
Then Longbottom has to say the one thing Draco isn’t suspecting and every vein in Draco’s body freezes. “I like your radio…”
“A girl in my lessons left three of her toes behind on the final test,” Eve snickers meanly, “Took Madam Pomfrey a week to grow them back.” Weasley and she both share a moment of laughter until Hermione hushes them.
When Draco reaches the castle and slips back inside, he goes into an abandoned corridor where his path of missing gargoyles begins. The empty perch, the left of a trio, is too high up for a human to get to. But a snow leopard would have no issue.
Nonetheless, Draco carried the camera everywhere, stashed away in his robes, and if he spotted Potter, completely unaware, then he wouldn’t hesitate to snap a quick picture, usually followed by calling out taunts to the boy before walking away.
Draco hums, looking off ahead of them towards where the lake twinkles in the afternoon sun. “I know what you mean,” he agrees softly. “Muggle things are not ‘normal,’ per se, to me - I find them fascinating, actually - but they are a different world than this one. From expectations.”
“It was good seeing you and my son up in the air today,” he says lowly and Draco nods absently, eying the man in confusion. That seemed like an odd thing to say if he was going to be pulling him to the side like this.
Draco tries to pay attention, he really does, but by that point he is swaying on his feet and fading in and out of awareness. He thinks he hears Umbridge demanding some kind of potion from Snape, something to help her “sort out the liars,” but she never calls it by name and Snape is being snappish and unhelpful.
Fang, realizing Harry isn’t paying attention to him anymore, bounds instead towards Ron and starts licking his ears. The redhead has a disgruntled look on his face at that development, then shoots Draco a glare when the blonde snickers.
They mostly stick to basic hexes and spells out of their own textbooks, but whenever Draco is around they try to go over at least one spell from
“A rumor, father?” Draco asks, looking up and setting his fork back down. His mother and father sit on far ends of their long, black, polished dining table, with Draco somewhere in the middle. He is a few seats closer to his mother, however.
“Because that is what you did,” McGonagall replies, fully facing him now, her hands clasped in front of her. She was thankfully taking this very seriously. “After You-Know-Who fell, you seemingly disappeared. No one knew where you had gone. We only rediscovered you three years ago.”
The tone of his voice gives Fudge pause and Draco can positively feel the tension and glares on his back. He keeps his composure, however, and keeps facing Fudge.
It takes Draco a few moments to realize the boy must be muggleborn, like Eve, and Draco is surprised by the surge of protectiveness he feels at this realization.
“It was right funny, though, you know,” Weasley says after swallowing his candy. On instinct he pours a bit more out for himself and Granger, offers it to Potter, and Potter smiles and shakes his head ‘no.’ They’ve begun walking again, weaving slowly through the crowds. “When Sirius first came to the Burrow he nearly gave mum a heart attack!”
They press their tongues back and forth in hungry licks and tastes, their hands beginning to wander. Harry’s grip on the blond locks loosens, fingers trailing over the buzzed hair beneath, then down the bumps of Draco’s neck. The touch is light and makes Draco shiver before dipping under his collar, warm palms splaying out over Draco’s shoulder blades, urging him even closer.
“I want to release the truth and trick the Ministry into allowing its publication. They’ll hardly read over an article they think has nothing to do with them or their pissing contest with Dumbledore.”
trilogy he’d managed to get with Tana’s help – and now he’d handed out his gifts to the Slytherin girls while he’d been in their room.
He does, however, notice their Defense Against the Dark Arts professor writhing and changing into something big, vicious, and terrifying. Draco’s eyes widen in horror and he nearly drops his camera.
“Potter,” he snarls, turning around to glare at the smirking boy. “What a surprise. Tell me, do you have any intention of approaching me like a normal, human being any time soon? Or should I continue to expect ape-like behavior from you?”
The one in his room was old and the frame screeched at him when he moved it, so he decided against that one, but there was a window in his en suite that just had a latch and he could push it open with no issue.
He feels the couch dip beside him from where Harry takes a seat. “Okay…” the Gryffindor says lowly as one of his hands runs up Draco’s neck and lays itself on the back of his head. “Okay, I won’t say anything. Tonight.”
“And if he was found not guilty, there must have been some truth in his claims,” Eve finishes, nodding along as she begins to understand.
“Is that any different than how he usually acts?” Draco smirks, “Although, I’d consider getting someone to test your food ahead of time for a few weeks. Just to be safe.”
The witch pulls out her wand once more and waves it once through the air. “As perfect as ever, Mr. Ollivander,” McGonagall says and Draco’s eyes widen. Wait, Ollivander had sold McGonagall her wand? But…
It was an antibiotic shot, according to the display, that fought off all kinds of infections that previously would have been proven fatal. It was actually discovered in the late 1920’s, complete by accident no less, but was distributed and became a vital feature within WW2.
“I guess not, seeing as you’re definitely beside the word ‘unexpected’,” Potter smiles, easily playing along with Draco’s snark, and that’s that. Conversation over. Whatever this is, it is easy and nice, even when they bicker or argue, and is certainly not “weird.”
“Why am I not surprised?” Potter grumbles. “A magic ferret. Why don’t we have a dancing elephant next? All the weird stuff happens to me, anyway.”
“I’m gonna take a wild guess and say they’re stronger than our spells,” Theodore offers, unhelpfully, and Draco swallows.
“That’s not… He hasn’t disappointed me,” Harry scrambles to defend the headmaster, as if he is trained to do so, and Draco gives him a displeased glare.
“Nope!” the other twin pops the word, “No detention for us! Harry helped us escape with the Marauders Map, so we were in the clear from the get-go.”
He wanted to help, but Max was right. They were just kids with little to no power. What were they supposed to do?
“Well, it is ridiculous,” Draco huffs, holding his head high and pouting rather righteously. He peaks up at McGonagall when she doesn’t reply and sees her staring back at him with an unimpressed, raised brow. “But… I will play by your rules,” he admits slowly, shoulders sagging at her gaze, and she nods.
Potter, Granger, and Sirius all seem perfectly content to welcome him to their festivities, Sirius even clapping him on the shoulder when he tells them he was hiding from his father. The twins call him “coolio,” which is humiliating, while just about everyone else is desperately trying to pretend like a Malfoy amidst Weasley’s is a totally normal affair.
The bone shifts, growing in size and taking on a globular form first, before it starts to become more recognizable.
“I think…” Krum begins, holding out his hands expectantly, and Draco is unceremoniously deposited into them. He squeaks, indignant at being passed around, but Krum seems to be trying to help so he keeps his squirming to a minimum. “You can nod and shake your head, yes?”
“I had an occlumency lesson today with Snape,” Harry finally offers, still not looking over, and instead pulls down one of the chairs and sets it properly on the ground.
“Malfoy, you’re talking very fast,” Potter says, eying Draco nervously as the blonde begins to pace about the tower.
“They’re Beaters,” Harry croaks, cutting off whatever fight was building between the two boys. When Draco looks back at him he’s still pale and holding the Quaffle like a lifeline, but he seems more put together. “They’re Beaters on Gryffindor’s Quidditch team.”
“Do you have to do anything else?” Hermione questions, but she sounds absent. She had never shown much interest in sports before, and after returning to flying class Draco also realized she was not the best flier.
“We probably should. Let’s take it to an open area, though. Do you know the Revealing Charm?” he questions, heading back over to the fence and climbing over just as easily as before.
“Harry,” Draco cuts him off, again too sharp, and he takes a breath. “Yes, I would like that, but not now. Can you… can you leave me alone for a little bit? I just need a moment.”
Tracey nods slowly. “That’s okay. You’ll change, and so will I, and so will the world.” She pauses, glancing around at the common room as people attempt to get back to normal conversation. Millicent is gone from her seat by now and Draco doesn’t know where she’s gone.
Narcissa sighs, eyes falling to her book sadly. “This is not a new incident, Draco. This is how it has always been. A politician makes a promise, and their inevitable success relies heavily on whether they can keep such a promise going.”
“Yes ma’am!” Harry smiles to their teacher, but it slowly fades when Sinistra just keeps staring at him. She doesn’t say a word as she reaches under her desk and raises up the very Quaffle they had managed to drop the night before when Draco’s broom had gone haywire. All three students stiffen and Sinistra sets the ball on her desk. She’s still staring at Harry.
It is in this moment, with all this food Draco could only dream about, with all these magical kids around him, with ghosts floating back and forth and sitting with the students, that it really begins to set in that Draco is far, far from his foster home. The life he has grown up with feels far in the past and everything is new and brilliant and full of possibilities.
So, he takes a deep breath and turns to look at all the cages. He recognized the barn and snowy owls. The rest he had to go off plaques on the cages. Brown owls. Tawny owls. Screech owls. Barred owls. They were all wonderful in their own ways, but none of them spoke to him.
“Swamp gas,” Draco explains, shrugging again, but moving towards the bathroom to shed off his robes and outer layers.
It feels like a great weight has been lifted from his shoulders as he settles into his seat. He had finally been sorted, sorted into the house both his parents had called theirs, sorted into the house that may have had a bad reputation, but all Draco could feel was eagerness.
“I’m surprised… usually you are eager to berate my frustrations and assume you know my peers better than I.”
Draco also ends up with a few new accessories after they get done browsing the magazines and he goes wandering again. Mostly jewelry he’ll never actually wear, but he thinks look cool anyway. If anything, he’s sure Eve can borrow them sometime if he finds no use for them.
” Muddy hisses as she slithers out from Draco’s robes. At some point she had hidden further within without Draco noticing and now she lets him hold her in his hands.
Harry doesn’t say a word to that, but he does sigh, sagging a little. After a few beats he shifts his hand so that their fingers are interlocked. “That has to be the laziest of your nicknames for me, by the way,” Harry says, looking back at Draco.
“Saying it in French does not make it any less inappropriate,” McGonagall says, a clear warning in her voice, and Draco shrugs.
For a while they say nothing, Draco still pointedly staring ahead, his expression tight and his heart beating too quickly, but the other boy’s fingers at his pulse point make him take calming breathes, the silence a blessing.
“And now, we wait,” Draco hums, taking a seat with Eve and giving the Yule Ball some time to get started.
A little while later, their food finished, Draco convinces Harry to let him teach him how to dance to “Thriller” when it comes on. It’s a mess, everyone laughing hysterically, but Draco doesn’t care. He’s happy and content.
Draco shuts off the radio, shrinks it, then slips it into his robe’s inner pocket, swiftly returning to his work.
“Good luck with that,” Draco scoffs, scratching lightly at the side of the thestral’s head and the large beast pushing its head into the movement. “Like we said, no one is interested in learning the factual truth right now.”
He glances back at the entryway as Malkin returns leading another young boy, maybe Draco’s age, and a stool flies by to land a few paces away from the blonde. The other boy, a scrawny thing, has a mop of black hair, round glasses, green eyes, and the biggest grin on his face Draco has ever seen. The boy hops onto the second stool and doesn’t have to be asked to raise his hands as his own robe, black like Draco’s, flies over and onto him.
Draco lurches forward when he sees Potter’s legs buckle, catching him before he can tumble, and lowering them both to the ground, pulling the weeping boy in his lap and holding him close, arms encircling Potter like a shield. Potter is curled tightly into the hold, burying his face into Draco’s chest and arms clinging to the back of Draco’s robes, body quaking as weak wails escape his throat.
seen is quite promising, though,” Luna assures. “I am very curious about the black orb that was created.”
“We need you and your camera,” the raven-haired boy says and Draco freezes and gets a proper look at his face. His eyes are wide and
They sit close to each other, probably closer than is strictly necessary, but Draco feels comfortable with it. The silence between their whispers is relaxing and natural, like a practiced skill, and Draco doesn’t understand why Eve keeps giving them both expectant looks before rolling her eyes and going back to reading.
A few hands raise and Draco looks out to identify everyone. Daphne, Astoria, Eve, Angelina, and even Leandra all have their hands raised, but that’s it. Draco knows he, himself, has managed to fight it off, along with a good number of purebloods in Slytherin, but he’d really expected more people to have been able to.
Something was bothering Potter about this, Draco realizes, as the boy wonder continues not to look at him, and he thinks he knows what it is about. He takes a slow step forward, offering the other boy plenty of time to move away if he so desires.
“Leave them be,” Draco whispers to her, but he’s smirking, entertained by her silent command of the two, large boys. She quickly looks at him, hair flying around her at the swift movement, and glares.
“Ge’ him free! Quick!” Longbottom’s voice is saying quickly, trying to stay a whisper despite Weasley’s pained squeals, and Harry’s already hurling spells at the brain and its tentacles, but nothing is working. Desperate, Draco runs forward, biting down on a tentacle, but it immediately flings him off like he’s nothing.
Moody. Draco needed to find Moody and have him turn him back. He needed to be a human again so he could go searching for Potter and tell him, or a professor, what he had seen. He probably should have told Moody, actually, but he’d been so certain the man wouldn’t help before.
It feels strange to fight against the direction he’s moving in. His claws curling into the earth as he moves forward, but he isn’t having to pull back. He isn’t moving against a force, the force is trying to pull him faster, and it makes it even harder to get his footing.
Draco stares at Creevey until he stops jabbering, his expression hard. First those two girls, and now this red and gold muggleborn was attempting to “hang out” with Draco? What was going on?
As long as he had known Max, the Muggle had always seemed proud of their differences. Their mother, father, and brother encouraged their unique proclivities, and in turn the whole family urged Draco to embrace his own differences. Being different was something to be celebrated in the Muggle family.
“We could join you,” Potter quickly offers, but Weasley’s vocal protest makes the bespectacled boy shrink.
“I may butcher the pronunciation,” Max’s father advises, adjusting his massive glasses as he looks at a plaque just out of Draco’s height range. “SS is short for Schutzstaffel, which means ‘Protection Squadron’ in German.” Draco may not speak German, but he’s pretty sure Max’s father did, in fact, butcher the pronunciation, but Draco sure isn’t going to give it a shot either.
“And spell work is all about your frame of mind,” Draco nods, sighing as he concedes. So much to do with spells had to do with what he was thinking. How he was envisioning things. The way he imagined the outcome or the process. He pulls out his wand from his sleeve, eying the shiny black wood. “I’ve been trying to cast Lumos in multiple colors since yesterday and it is causing me more issues than I expected,” he says and Vivian tilts her head at him, all ears. “It’s a modifier that already exists, but perhaps my issue is how I am picturing it in my head.”
“You were at Gringotts?” he asks, as innocently and casually as he can muster. THAT seems to catch Ron’s attention, who suddenly looks confused, while Hagrid relaxes marginally at the tone.
They pull back away, however, when Eve’s voice calls from the hallway, “Can I come back in now or are you two still being mushy dorks?” She doesn’t wait for a response, reentering anyway, and the two boys can’t help but smile giddily.
“They’re also quite sweet,” he finishes lamely, reaching up to pet the familiar thestral on its head. He wonders what drew the creature back over to him, but he isn’t complaining.
Their library trip was a fruitful one for him seeing as he’d found a few books on charms that gave very, very in-depth rundowns on how common spells worked. He had written extensive notes on his findings, comparing them to his own experience with what he had managed so far, and began writing down questions for the next time he saw Professor Flitwick. “Can the color of Lumos be altered and how?” “Can the intensity of Lumos be altered and how?” “Can Nox be used on lights used not created by the caster? If not, why?” “How does the wording of the incantation affect a spell?”
They even manage to rope Longbottom into it once, having the lanky boy tackle Draco outside of Potions over a comment about his grandmother. When Snape only takes points from Gryffindor, however, Longbottom pouts for the remainder of class and they don’t ask him again.
Neville Longbottom enters a few seconds later, a thick book open in his hands, and Draco’s back stiffens at the sight of him. He has never, nor will he ever, be frightened of the cowardly lion, but knowing that it had been Draco’s own extended family that had left the boy’s parents in the Janus Thickey Ward… well, that was something tough for anyone with half a heart to swallow.
That gets the compartment’s attention and everyone looks up at him and Draco offers a dashing smile. “I’m afraid my usual spot has been infested by two lovebirds showing their… affections.”
“I doubt you would be able to release your article afterwards, either,” Huang-Jun huffs, sounding bitter, but then he begins to hover off Weasley’s lap, flying through the air using magic instead of wings. “But that you would consider such a plan brings me joy. Do what you can outside these walls to better your world and do not forget about me. I can wait.”
“Potter. Shut up.” Potter finally looks over, prepared to continue what would have surely been a spectacular disagreement, but he is greeted by a smug-looking snow leopard whose long tail swishes over their homework.
They make it down to the Slytherin Dungeons in one piece, thank Salazar, and rush in. The common room has a few students in it, similar to Gryffindor’s, but the moment they come rushing in students are scrambling away. Their eyes are mostly on Theodore and his dreadful appearance, but a few shoot Draco some anxious glances.
The ginger turns back towards the front, eyes narrowing and lips moving as he counts. “Nine. Leading one is short and fat.”
” Vivian immediately shrieks, whatever discomfort she was in forgotten as she looks to Draco like he’s lost it. “That’s insane! She’s the one that let’s… us… up here…” Her eyes widen, horror painting her features, and she looks between Harry and Draco a few times before staring at the ground. “Oh Merlin…”
“We will begin with some of your first-year spells,” Sinistra then says. “As you learn, we will personalize your spell choices.”
“Motherfu… who di’ tha’…?” Vivian slurs, green eyes blurry as she begins to look around. Draco looks to Harry instead of her. He must look horribly lost because Harry pulls their sides together with his arm.
“It sounds unethical,” Granger muses, fingers fidgeting on the edge of the table. “Prisoners or not, no one should be treated the way they are at Azkaban.”
With the Patronus, far more people had managed to cast the spell, but now, hardly anyone was getting shadowy wisps from their wands.
“Of course I did,” Draco says, affronted. “I put together quite the blackmail packages on Ludo Bagman for two of his main enemies, I managed to strike a few suspects off my list, I got Sirius a copy of Bertha Jorkins’s files since he’s looking into her, and I’ve begun looking into a particularly curious lead.”
“Good afternoon, father,” the young wizard greets with a nod, quickly setting down the history book he had been daydreaming over.
The first time he’d noticed Potter’s looks, consciously, had been the night before Easter last school year. Ever since, Draco had kept spotting these moments, these looks, that stunned him, and Potter very rarely had to do anything at all to cause it. It was a little infuriating, if Draco was being honest, yet somehow he never felt angry.
“Even Sirius,” Harry continues, both his bare hands finding Draco’s, clearly attempting to warm themselves up. “He’s free, but with all the attention from the Ministry he’s had to be really careful what he goes outside of his home. It’s almost like he’s on house arrest, and he acts like it too.”
But then Mrs Nubble was standing, silencing him before he could make any rude comments, and swiftly walked towards the office. A moment later and she was back, hardly gone for long, and handing over a folded sheet of paper to McGonagall. “He arrived on our doorstep the 23rd of June, 1980 with only that note. This is all we know,” she said, a tightness to her voice she always got when talking about these things.
Draco follows at a subdued pace, mouthing “carved” to himself as he goes, and tries not to smirk as he comes upon Sophie kicking at his dorm room door with her feet. She’s trying to catch her toe on the handle but keeps missing.
McGonagall had stepped in, demanding the Aurors halt their cruel, ridiculous behavior, but it had instead drawn their aggression to her.
Draco slams the door shut behind them before both he and Weasley tumble onto the ground, heaving for breath and soaking wet.
When Draco had first returned to class it had been Potter to approach him. Despite their apparent agreement that no thanks needed to be offered to Draco, he didn’t want them, Potter still seemed to want to show his appreciation in some way.
He was fine with dealing with one of these girls at a time, but ever since the DA meetings began two weeks prior, Luna and Tracey had been inseparable. The two were so similar, yet so different in other ways.
“That doesn’t mean you can’t miss talking to him,” Ginny argues, looking stern, then reaching across the table to take Harry’s free hand. “He’s your family, Harry. You should be allowed to just… talk.”
“If you’d have let us explain, Granger, you would have known already,” Eve snaps, which only manages to make the Gryffindor puff up.
“It did,” Draco chuckles, unable to not be caught up in the celebration. Weasley and Granger don’t join in on this hug, but they do crowd in close, laughing and smiling brightly with their friend.
Eventually, though, they bid each other good-bye and Draco stores away his own things. Potter has been gone for about an hour, now, and the moon may not be high in the sky, but it is bright, visible, and very full.
It made it easy to listen to idle chatter, too, which was how he heard the whispers about the attack a few floors down. Apparently, an official had been hurt so badly he’d been rushed to St. Mungo’s. Draco doesn’t hear a name, but it definitely piques his interest when he hears it happened the very day Potter and the Weasleys had disappeared from Hogwarts.
“Human transfiguration is hard. Revert back, though,” Krum removes his wand from his hip, pointing it at Draco, who stands perfectly still on his hind legs. “Easier. Bodies alvays remember original form and a Revealing Charm vill vork.
They were all just students. They were normal kids who wanted to do well in classes. Sure, there were jerks here, Draco slept in the same dorm room as one of them, but there was no way there weren’t jerks in the other houses, too. They couldn’t be judged by the few, loud gits… but they were, and Draco wished he knew how to change that.
“I should speak to him,” Draco decides, standing up and gathering his things. “My resources are limited here, I could use someone on the outside.”
The minutes tick by, feeling long and miserable, until an hour has passed and, finally, the sound of footsteps can be heard.
“I thought you were American?” She and her family certainly had the accent for it. Why would she call her own nation’s actions evil? Shouldn’t she support them?
“I’m sure you’ll see if you read a little lower that this… absolutely stunning work of genius was written by a Mrs. Daisy Hayworth,” Skeeter says sweetly, leaning forward and pointing a sharp nail at the author’s name.
“Sometimes, Miss. Bulstrode,” she says without looking at Millicent, “we must fall back on drastic, but efficient, measures.” For a moment, the toad’s eyes catch on Draco and her smile worsens.
Draco, in an attempt to wow the compartment, had pulled out the items he’d nabbed from Moody’s magical trunk. The books peak their interest, but the invisibility cloak, shockingly, does not.
No one notices him at first, but then the spacy girl, who has dirty blonde hair down to her waste, looks up at him and smiles like she’d known he was there all along. “Hello there,” she greets, voice very floaty, “You’re Draco Malfoy, aren’t you?”
He wants to fall apart now. He wants to cry and scream and throw a damn tantrum because he’s earned it.
Luna is a hare. Ginny is a horse. Finnigan is a fox. Macmillan is a boar. Everyone else had managed either nothing or a non-corporeal form.
He can also smell other people. Some are stale, likely the Unspeakables that work down here, while others are fresh. Some are a little familiar, but Draco can’t put a name or face to them, while others are foreign completely.
Harry shrugs weakly, arms flopping down to his sides and his bag nearly falling off of his shoulder. “She wants me to do well in school…” he mumbles.
“And what if I shatter it?” Harry challenges and the grin on Bellatrix’s face falls. She snarls, snapping at them angrily, before her eyes flick sideways and she’s grinning again.
Fuck, this is too much and Draco hates working on the fly. He much prefers plans they lay out ahead of time.
How could one man function with so much hate? It was a mystery not even Max or Max’s parents had a ready answer for.
“Oh, look. Are we showing off personal spells?” Luna’s voice cuts in as she and Tracey wander over. Draco, grudgingly, cancels out his spell and turns to them.
“Keep up the anarchic work, boys,” he eventually sighs, waving the twins off, “I am hungry and I will not be held up any longer.”
“Eric…” Draco sighs, focusing on the still weeping teenager, a hand coming up to massage the bridge of his nose. “I think you are focusing a little too much on what is wrong with the situation, rather than what is good. You may have… lost… little Jay,” Eric hiccups pathetically at the name, “but you saved all his brothers and sisters, who I’m sure are counting on you right now to take care of them.”
Alright, they may have just killed somebody, but if they don’t check the pulse they can neither confirm nor deny that…
Even further across the room, Draco manages to catch George’s eye. He’s laughing over something Jordan has said, but sobers when he sees Draco’s serious expression. He nudges his brother beside him, and then both twins are looking his way. Draco juts his chin towards the Ravenclaw table and the twins immediately zero in on Edgecombe.
They attempt to ask Eve what they should expect on their O.W.L.s, but all she advises is, since it’s still the beginning of the year, finish homework and then review things from their previous years.
“No,” Draco snaps before the ginger can send them all into a panic. “No way. That woman was far too emotional last night. If she’d found something like that, she would have bragged about it. Trust me, as manipulative as that woman is, she’s dreadful at keeping secrets when she thinks she’s won.”
“Why would I need to do that when you have managed to do so well sabotaging yourselves?” Draco purrs, leaning forward and smirking darkly up at the ginger. There is very little humor in his actions.
“Because they were scared, I suppose. We do a lot of terrible things when we’re scared. Evil, awful things.”
“Is Bagman really a concern of yours?” Granger asks, walking out with him now that he’s done. They had just gotten finished with a very emotional reunion with a particular, rebellious house elf.
He wanted to go home. He wanted his friends safe and healthy and secure. He wanted to not be trapped in these bloody departments in the bloody Ministry. He wanted Harry to not feel terrified of himself. He wanted them, a bunch of Hogwarts students, not to be left with a war they never even chose.
Weasley throws his powder and disappears in the green flames, Draco hardly waiting before he’s following after.
“The girls look like they could kick my ass,” Theodore Nott says, sounding awed, and Blaise Zabini snorts.
Potter does groan at that but wishes Draco a good night when they reach the fork in their paths, hurrying up to Gryffindor Tower while Draco descends into the dungeons.
He can’t believe how relieved he is to see this boy alive and walking. It almost doesn’t feel real, but here Harry is, and Draco would cry if he were human.
After the second week of detentions, Draco thinks Potter has finally figured out that speaking his opinion in DADA really doesn’t do him any good. He only ends up with an injured hand and more anger than he likely knows how to deal with.
They do, thankfully, and Draco keeps staring at Harry with a slack jaw and bug eyes. With the argument seemingly over Harry appears to transform, angry lines softening until he looks nervous once more.
Draco hurries after Edgecombe in the meantime, keeping to the shadows. She’s getting closer and closer to the office door and if the twins don’t set off their distraction in time, Draco will have to resort to stunning the Ravenclaw.
“He was acting really weird the moment we started talking about that break-in,” Harry says, looking concerned and suspicious, glancing back towards the hut like Hagrid might be listening in somehow.
!” Harry calls, doing what Draco had done earlier and blinds the troll for a second. It thankfully gets it to stop attacking Draco, attention elsewhere as it swings down towards the kids on the ground, but Draco is still hanging by his leg in the beast’s grip.
“Hullo, Great Aunt Walburga,” he says, plastering on his best smile usually reserved for parties. “Lovely afternoon, wouldn’t you say?”
Draco, feeling woozy and exhausted and confused beyond measure, actually gives his headmaster a thumbs up with his good hand and says, “Coolio…” before passing out from the pain.
“I know what I am!” Max is going on, voice no longer defeated but furious, but there is still a warble there that Draco worries about. “I’m a proud Two Spirit, thank you very fucking much! Fuck Adham Najjar and his pompous ass! Just because I’m not something you understand doesn’t mean I’m wrong!”
It was enough of a reason for Draco to flee and find solitude with his radio, all his things already packed, ready to be done with his first year at Hogwarts.
That is until he reached one of the far corners. It had taken some weaving, but he had eventually found himself in front of a single cage, set just a little bit farther away from all the others, with a beautiful, menacing owl within. It looks furious the way its brows curve over its big, orange eyes and two tufts at the top look almost like devil horns. It stares at Draco, judging him, before it shakes its head and tucks it under a wing.
It certainly doesn’t help his nerves when he looks away from Umbridge, for a moment, and finds Potter’s striking, green eyes on him yet again. It’s only for a moment, but it’s a moment that has Draco stiffening up immediately until Potter looks away, attention split between Hagrid and Umbridge.
This time Umbridge is far less forgiving. With the Lung Dragon piece there had been no one to punish, and the goal was for it to eventually be shoved under the rug, but the article with Harry’s direct quotes? Umbridge wastes no time attacking Harry with more and more detention, forbidding the Quibbler, but only succeeding in the paper becoming a hot commodity among the students.
Dumbledore takes the folder and opens it, finding file after file of information held within, and his brows rise, clearly impressed. It is not every day one can say they impressed the great Albus Dumbledore.
“But the difference between you failing and me failing, you see, is if you fail you’ll just lose a game of Quidditch, but if I fail I could completely destroy the feeble foundation keeping the Order afloat and put everyone involved at risk, including you and your friends,” Draco snarls viciously, eyes narrowed, and Weasley glares right back. “Your rigorous desire to be someone ‘important’ is pathetic and insulting.”
Now, however, he uses a portkey, also provided from the Ministry, that takes him straight to the grounds outside the stadium. The sun is out but beginning to make its trek down the sky, while most everyone has already set up their tents and is running around, enjoying themselves.
“Do you believe in fate?” Draco asks conversationally, smiling too sweetly as Longbottom’s brows furrow in first confusion, then consideration. “I was just considering it the other day, wondering if we’re all here because something else preordained it.” He makes a show of moving his hands with the words, like he’s telling some great story, and he almost hears the scrape of Harry’s eyeroll.
“Maybe I should toss it,” Theodore hums, rolling the Remembrall around his fingers, “Let little Neville find it in the Black Lake, maybe? Or perhaps I should return it… that way maybe, just maybe,” Theodore’s cold eyes flick down to the class, “he’ll remember to fall on his neck next time he tries to fly.”
At least they both enjoyed reading and learning, otherwise Draco doubts he could have handled the girl. She was… fine. She just was remarkably pushy. And obnoxious. And loud. And bossy. And just about everything that made Draco grind his teeth. But she was nice, and understood what Draco was going through, and they both loved the library like a second home.
“Draco. I have heard much of you. You sound like a good boy. You treat my Evangeline right,” Miss. Hushburn says in a clipped, Japanese accent, nodding once at Draco.
Potter swallows, his throat bobbing with the motion, and now it’s his turn to look ahead of them, mind far away. “The Dursley’s didn’t let me see hardly any of their own world. I’ve heard of famous spots basically in my own backyard, but have never been allowed to see them. It wasn’t that my world was confined that infuriated me, it was the knowledge that it could so easily be more, that my world could be the world at large, but my own family wanted to keep me from it because I didn’t ‘deserve’ it.”
Gemma opens her mouth to say something but then the redhead girl, curly blonde boy, and a boy with dreads pulled into a bun say, in unison, “Then you’re all on your own and you’ll probably drown!” Gemma looks back at the trio of speakers, obviously agitated, and Harry snickers at Draco’s side. It was good to see the boy beginning to relax, despite how pale he still was.
It wasn’t just Moody Draco didn’t want to see him heading to his office, it was the students. All it would take was one well-meaning Ravenclaw to approach Moody on the pitch and let him know one Draco Malfoy was probably looking for him but hadn’t heard he wasn’t in his office anymore to ruin the whole thing.
With that, Draco is pushed along by the excited, energized Muggle child, and once he is outside, he goes in search of the Leaky Cauldron, returning to the wizarding world, but hardly returning as the same.
He knew exactly what this was about. Despite having joined Sirius and Dumbledore to the hospital wing those few night ago, Draco had hardly had a reason to be there. Sirius and Potter had only been interested in hugging and talking and having
“But… you’re family,” Draco whispers eventually, unsure how else to vocalize the turmoil Max’s father was abruptly causing in his young mind.
Dobby had even brought him one of the most hideous pairs of brown mittens he’s ever seen, but the house elf had been grinning so wide Draco could only offer a tight smile and nod back.
They get dragged over to the Gryffindor table for most of their meals, everyone wanting to ask about how they got onto their Quidditch team and what they were planning on doing. It wasn’t being kept a secret, it seemed, and most of the Gryffindor players seemed pleased to have a “healthy chance at competition from the Slytherin team” and Draco didn’t miss some of the dirty looks from the Slytherin table. Theodore and Millicent looked particularly displeased.
“Goblins,” Draco replies honestly, shrugging. “I spotted them in Hogsmeade surrounding Bagman. Paid them off and offered to get more dirt on him for them to find out why they were mad with him. They were also aware of all the bets he made, including yours, the nosey bastards.”
Draco hesitates as he passes the wall covered in information about the two, nuclear bombs that had been used as the final act of the war. So many people, wiped from the face of the earth, and he’d thought it was just a disturbing part of some Muggle fantasy. But, no, it was real. The United States had actually done that. Had actually killed that many people without batting an eye.
“Magic? I thought we were saying supernatural,” Hermione responds unhelpfully, smirking around her buck teeth when it makes Draco fume.
“How was everyone’s summer, then?” Draco questions, looking around at the compartment. Thankfully, due to the meeting in the prefect’s cabin, they are already at least halfway to Hogwarts and he won’t have to sit in this cramped space for long. He may as well strike up conversation so it doesn’t become stiflingly awkward.
She breaks down a few myths they have all certainly heard about the house and, appearing frustrated, explains there are plenty of nasty witches and wizards from other houses out there. She’s trying to reassure them, Draco realizes, knowing they will certainly get flak from the rest of the student body for their affiliation.
Draco stashes his camera away in one of his pants pockets, shrunken so as not to ruin the lines of his suit. He hadn’t expected to use it often tonight, especially not with how much dancing he planned to do, but now he was glad he’d brought it.
Thought I’d try to send you something from your neck of the woods. The Who ain’t exactly my speed, but I figured some local, English flavor might be nice for a change. Hope we didn’t corrupt you too much with our American propaganda! HA! Enjoy it, Draco.
“And besides,” Draco shrugs, looking back at the reporter, “You don’t have much of a choice, now do you?” he reminds her and her scowl is something to behold. That’s right, she was still under his thumb and he intended to keep it that way for as long as he could. “We’re graciously giving you all these great ideas, too, do you really have room to complain?”
“Oh! Sign language! I’ve always wanted to learn,” Hermione immediately says, leaning forward and near demanding they teach her some signs. Draco leans back and silently watches, brows furrowed curiously, listening but not commenting. Greg and Vincent seem pleasantly surprised by Hermione’s desire to learn, Greg talking her through the alphabet as Vincent does the signs for each letter. Draco wonders if Vincent will even be able to do some of the spells they’ll learn if he can’t say them out loud… McGonagall had done her chair-ostrich trick without a word, after all, so maybe it wasn’t as big a deal?
Harry tenses marginally, not much, and Draco only knows because he has his hands on him, but then he breathes deeply and sags. “It doesn’t matter anymore…” he whispers and reaches up to grasp at Draco’s hands. Once he has a good grip, he drags them down and around to his front, effectively dragging Draco against his back in a loose embrace.
So... From here on out the chapters are going to likely be shorter. It'll help my own sanity, but also get them out for y'all a lot faster. This particular one isn't super short, since I wanted to get a lot of the summer arc out of the way and introduce some new characters and themes, but after this it'll likely be much smaller word counts...
Draco doesn’t have to be asked twice. He knows Harry has to be better at this than him and he isn’t going let his pride keep him from making a smart, logical decision. But he also isn’t confident in how accurate he can throw the Remembrall on a moving broom and looks ahead. “Go long!” he calls, then barrel rolls under Theodore’s broom, pulls back his arm, and chucks the glass orb as hard as he can.
Skeeter glares back at the two of them before straightening herself out and attempting to give herself some dignity. “Why are we in your damp, dark common room, anyway?” she demands, making a sweeping motion with her hand at the room at large.
“Dumbledore… insinuated we get proof, and that there was a way to do it if we had more time and…” With a sigh Granger digs out a golden pendant with an hour glass built into it. Draco’s eyebrows shoot up as he immediately recognizes the Time-Turner, which is currently ticking down after being used.
Draco slowly rejoins the class as well, partnered with the twins as usual, and Potter does go over a few more points about the Unforgiveable Curses, but they never do get around to practicing resistance. Draco highly doubts this will be the last it is mentioned. He won’t allow it to be the last. If not for himself, then for Tracey and her worries.
He doesn’t say any of it, however, and instead forces a smile on his face and asks, “Do you think I could go out and practice my broom work?”
Standing in the middle of Draco’s dorm room are Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson. They’re looking at Draco rather smugly as he enters, like they know something he doesn’t, matching, thin smiles. What a lovely way to wrap up his Thursday.
They were surrounded in the room Draco can only assume is the Death Chamber with his own father and aunt bearing down on them.
“I am insulted you think anyone could be competition to me, Potter,” Draco drawls overdramatically, and Potter snickers.
“I DIDN’T FU--” Draco cuts off his furious scream and forces himself to calm down, grinding his teeth as he practically feels Eve smirking at his back. “All of the lightning in this storm has merely been in the clouds. We require an actual bolt of lightning.”
The tears well up quickly, then begin to drip free, turning their kiss wet until Harry pulls away. He doesn't go far, though, instead shifting them until he can hold Draco as close as his wounded shoulder will allow. The tears keep falling, wrecked breaths quake out of Draco on every exhale, body shaking as he presses his face to Harry’s neck.
It’s nice - it’s always nice - and some of the stress rolls off Draco’s back as he lays in the grass. Even when they bid Max good-bye and Harry moves to lay beside him, both staring at the stars, the worries don’t come flooding back in. It is all much-needed and much-appreciated.
“Really,” Draco says a bit more firmly, “It’s okay.” He had wanted to meet Sirius, had hoped he might show up when he’d found out James Potter would be showing up, but when he hadn’t Draco had felt both disheartened and a little relieved. “I wouldn’t have known what to do with myself if he’d shown up anyway.”
The snow still covering the Hogwarts grounds is remarkably soft and perfect for cushioning someone’s fall. Draco knows this because the day after arriving at Hogwarts, a Sunday, not long after he goes out to the grounds to wait for the Golden Trio, does Harry Potter bowl him over in greeting. They both flop gracelessly into the snow, Harry’s laughter echoing in Draco’s head, while Draco is still too surprised to respond.
That surprises the other boy enough to get him to step back. He’s back to looking suspicious and frustrated. “Seriously?”
“Oh! It’s a family book, actually,” Leandra smiles sweetly at Harry, showing him the cover of the book. There isn’t any visible writing on it, however, rather one large, intricate design carved into the leather. “I got it over Christmas. It is called The Geoscript, and I’m finally old enough to learn from it… If I can understand it.”
“Perhaps, if the evidence were more substantial. At the current instance I am merely in hypothesizing. I need to actually do more investigative research and tests before I can make any solid claims.”
“Hm, yes, and throwing you in the dungeon certainly sounds like it was fate,” Hermione hums and Draco shoots her a half-hearted glare. She only smiles back at him.
“You… What?” Draco attempts again, flailing his hands helplessly, and Harry shrugs and jabs a thumb at Blaise, who looks particularly bored.
“The other Slytherins signed it,” Weasley says, turning away from the chalkboard to glare at him, arms crossed. Potter has looked up from where he’s attempting to go over his plans for the next DA meeting, but says nothing.
“You and the Slytherins showing up, too, to save the day like some superheroes,” Harry continues and Draco shifts his right hand enough to wipe away a trail of tears with his thumb. The cheek doesn’t stay dry long. “It shouldn’t have been necessary. I shouldn’t have put you through all that.”
“He’s still sick?” Draco questions, brows beginning to furrow as he feels suspicion boiling to the surface. “Strange, isn’t it? I never knew Bartemius Crouch well, but every time I heard about him he was a hard, devoted worker. Does he really seem the type to miss so much work?”
. Why don’t you?” Draco was in absolutely no mood to deal with Theodore anymore. Who didn’t know that a three-headed dog was a Cerberus? Albeit, in mythology Cerberus had been only one individual, but still.
He enters the infirmary. Madam Pomfrey is already awake, eying the wall in the direction most of the noise can be heard from, but she looks to him as he enters. He makes a show of moaning, complaining about stomach pains, and while she shows concern, there is also a suspicious twist to her lips.
“The memory can change. So can the Patronus, for that matter, but even now my memory isn’t of you,” Harry takes a deep breath and Draco opens his eyes, seeing the anxious smile grow on the other’s face. “It doesn’t take away how much you mean to me. How much I’d do for you. How much I… well…”
There’s still plenty of spells on the docket they have been hoping to get to, not to mention the ones they’ve all been working on individually since Christmas Break. They need to continue practicing their offensive and defensive charms, review magical threats they might encounter, begin to introduce the Militus Charm, and continue working with the Patronus--
“That he is,” McGonagall agrees and her eyes fall on Draco, making him straighten up in surprise, her stare intense. After a few beats she does at least offer a small smile, and it lets the boy breathe a little easier, before she looks between his foster parents once more. “And you are what we call Muggles in the wizarding world. This is a term for those individuals who do not possess magical abilities.”
He tosses the towel at the house elf’s head as he hurries back inside for dinner, smirking when he hears the elf fumble to see again. He doesn’t even get reprimanded for setting the broom on the dining table when he reaches the dining room. Probably because it’s his birthday, so it is sure not to last long.
“Why her?” Granger’s brows furrow, clearly unhappy to not be part of the loop, especially if it has something to do with the safety of her friends.
He never finds out what Max meant when they mentioned Potter, since Max rambles for nearly two hours until they have to bid each other good-bye and turn off their radios.
Draco eyes Longbottom carefully, recalling the very first class with Moody. He’d taught every house the Unforgiveable Curses, everyone knew that. Perhaps he’d thoroughly upset Longbottom and had felt bad? Then again, Moody didn’t seem the type to “feel bad” about anything.
When Vernon Dursley opens the door it takes everything in Draco not to sneer in displeasure. What a disgusting-looking Muggle.
The traitor hardly has time to react, because when he finally turns to face his attacker Draco has already shifted, sprinting at full speed at him with a yowl and springing at him. His claws dig through leather robes and pierce skin, fangs digging into the imposter’s face with every snarl, growl, and yowl.
He needed to get to the hospital wing and tell Madam Pomfrey to hurry to “Moody’s” office pronto. He’d assured the real Mad-Eye that he would be safe, but that Draco had no way of getting him out of there. He needed a faculty member to do that, especially since, even from three meters up, Draco could tell Mad-Eye was injured.
“We aren’t done with the museum, yet, Max!” Max’s father calls from across the room, clearly frazzled, but Max keeps pulling at Draco, unaware of the conversation they’ve interrupted.
through Hagrid’s garden. Not even the garden, really, just some loose dirt off to the side. And is he… dropping a bone into the ground?
“How can I trust that he won’t rat me out the moment we leave here?” Skeeter continues, not really listening.
But he couldn’t. He wanted them to be alive, to want him, but he had a bone deep, cold feeling that they were no longer of this world. He had no way of explaining how he knew this, but he had no way of explaining most things anyway.
“What the hell, Max?” Draco yells back at them, thankful for his mother’s silencing charm over his room. He’d hardly even sat down in one of his sitting area’s chairs when Max had gone and pulled this.
Draco’s mouth falls open and Potter grins, looking like the kneazle that got the cream. Weasley is trying to hold snickers back behind his hand while Granger holds a hand to her head and shakes it in disbelief.
“That’s… something…” Potter mumbles, hands flopping uselessly at his sides as he just keeps staring.
“To Dumbledore,” she says, handing over her rolled up parchment, and the owl takes it gently in its talons, then flies out. The door shuts after it.
Draco sneers, nose wrinkling, before he schools his features and nods. “Hullo,” he says, chipper. He’d offer his hand, but both of them are stuck in their positions while their robes are sized. Draco takes a glance at the black robes almost identical to his own. “Hogwarts, too?”
Draco only just manages to stay upright, but he stumbles a few feet back as the sonic boom of the spell erupts out and blasts the door forcefully into the office. The handle and its lock, however, are all that remains, still attached to the wall with splintered wood hanging off of it.
“Well, sure, they should listen to me. I have a lot more life experience than they do, learned a lot more through mistakes than they have, but I don’t want them to be my clones. They are their own people. They should respect me, but build their own opinions too, and when I make mistakes or do something they disagree with, they are not required to stand beside me just because I’m their father.”
“On the night of the Yule Ball, Potter showed me the Marauders Map - marvelous spellwork, by the way, I am truly impressed,” Draco begins and Sirius preens a tiny bit. “In the Great Hall I saw the name Barty Crouch.”
“Oh! Yes, of course. My question,” the Slytherin nods, stepping closer to Sinistra’s desk and leaning his hands on the edge. “You have surprised me before with your knowledge on the magics that… interest me. You are an Animagus, wandless magic expert, capable of a Patronus, just to list a few.”
Draco still manages to catch up to Potter, though, ignoring the strange cold that permeates into his very core. Side by side with Potter, both have their hands stretched out for the Snitch. It is
“I dunno!” Vivian shrugs, hands flailing, “Maybe she wanted to see how much damage she’d done? Put the fear of Aurora Sinistra in our souls?”
Eventually the main course came to an end, Draco feeling stuffed already, but then the food disappeared, and piles of desserts took its place. Draco suddenly didn’t feel as full, eying the ice cream and apple pie greedily. He cut a hefty slice of pie then dropped a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of it while Harry piled his plate with treacle tart and only treacle tart.
“Grammy and Mama had a big fight a few years back. Mama never got along super great with either Grammy or Grandpa, but now… I dunno. We never went back to see them again and now Grammy’s gone forever…”
Harry audibly gulps, but thankfully nods and begins the stiff process of walking towards his friend. Draco sighs and walks at a normal, quicker pace down the other side of the table before plopping down beside Hermione.
He eventually settled on a sugar quill, thinking it looked like a lollipop, and Hermione asked to grab her a licorice wand. Then Vincent and Greg were maneuvering him back into the compartment so they could swarm the trolley themselves, CD player forgotten, and Draco arched his brows when they returned with armfuls of sweets.
Ollivander’s wasn’t at all what Draco had suspected, but then again, nothing had been so far. It was a thin building, rather shabby, and the gold lettering on the front was peeling. Draco had suspected that something so important to the wizarding culture would have a more spectacular shop…
“Whoever did this had to have planned in advance. To do that, they would have needed to know about the Triwizard Tournament returning. Bertha Jorkins was part of the Department of Magical Games and Sports, meaning it would not be out of the question to assume she knew about all this.”
There are no bells or jingles to announce their arrival, probably so as to keep the owls relaxed, but there is a front desk only a few feet away with a tired looking wizard sitting behind it. The place is dark and cramped, full of cages and shelves pushing in from every direction. Bird droppings litter the floor and the occasional noise of an owl hooting or ruffling its feathers fills Draco’s ears.
of a guy,” Weasley snaps, obviously thinking he needs to defend his friend, and Draco scowls at him.
The new pairs still dance near each other, but make a full spin around the floor, when Krum spots something over Draco’s shoulder and his thick brows rise. “Your champion just spat out his drink.”
“I’d really quite like to make up for that whole Astronomy Tower debacle,” Draco tacks on, fluttering his lashes, like he’s truly remorseful, and Umbridge’s eyes flick to him.
“He’s right, Harry. It’s far too dangerous for you,” Granger had said and Harry immediately bristles.
“So… what? You’re just playing tourist or something?” Weasley demands, sounding disbelieving. It is clear he wants to leave already, not at all happy with Draco’s presence, and the blonde gives him an assessing look before answering.
He blinks and he’s up in his room, throwing up his very soul and weeping, his mother trying to calm him down as best she can.
For a few minutes they talk back and forth about the game, speech awkward and stiff, but at least on common ground. Draco thinks things might be going well, compared to most of his other encounters, until conversation veers towards families.
As the train begins to pick up speed Hermione pulls out another book. Draco hardly sees what it might be when he remembers he had wanted to check something out while they were in the train. He pulls up his backpack and then removes Ada’s CD player and the album of CDs. Greg and Vincent watch, transfixed, mouths stuffed with some kind of biscuits.
“That’s Hagrid,” Harry offers, pointing up at the giant man at the front of the group. The man must spot the movement for his beard (fur?) twitches upward like a smile and he waves at Harry in greeting, asking how he is.
“Thank you, Professor Sinistra!” he calls back to her as he goes, then hurries along in search of McGonagall to show her his accomplishment.
“Oh, yes. His mother was a member of the… oh dear, I might get this name wrong, but I believe the Tracklebon family? They were considered purebloods, but she took on her Muggle husband’s name and, without anyone else to carry on the family legacy, the Tracklebon’s lost their pureblood status,” Leandra explains, “The process is called ‘squiking’.”
He hated the thought that something so much bigger than them was hurting his friend. He hated the thought that people so drastically misunderstood such an integral part of Max, on such a massive scale, that it was making them miserable. He hated that the world couldn’t understand that people were just born different. Why did it matter that Max wasn’t a boy or a girl? Why was that anyone else’s business?

They kiss amongst the bustling families, lingering as long as they can so they can remember the taste and the feel as long as possible. When they pull apart they rest their foreheads together, basking in each other’s presence a little longer. Something inside Draco settles.
“Did you know there are different poisons that target specific organs and functions within your body?” Tracey asks with equal airiness. Draco side-eyes her, but Luna looks to her and casually asks what these poisons are. Disturbingly enough, Tracey lists all of them from memory…
Somehow, someway, they make it up to the London streets without getting stopped, identified, or arrested. Draco feels a literal weight lifting off his shoulder and bug wings buzzing as Skeeter makes her silent departure the second they hit open air, but Potter doesn’t seem to notice. He, instead, rips the witch’s hat off, the blonde hair disappearing with the motion, and looks at Draco with an intense glare.
“No,” Hermione immediately responds, nose up high, “Grab your backpack, Draco, we can put Trevor inside if we find him.”
“Were you scared?” Max asks brightly. Draco had just returned from a Halloween Ball a family friend had held for the pureblood community and he was positively exhausted. Despite that, he had still called up Max, wanting to talk to the young Muggle to help Draco relax.
“You were unable to use that properly,” Draco rolls his eyes, enjoying the way the slinky moves as he hops it between his two hands.
There would be a lot of much-needed communication between everyone after all this was over, whether they liked it or not…
Turns out, however, the cat is named Mrs. Norris and belongs to the nasty caretaker, Mr. Filch. He is particularly unhappy to see students out and about when they should be in class, despite Hermione trying to explain their first period is free today, but Draco manages to worm their way out of a punishment by complimenting the cat profusely and referring to the bitter man with an overbearing amount of respect. They manage to slip away, finally, to the library with only a warning and a glare.
The concoction has turned reddish-purple, but if he has done everything correctly, and he’s confident he has, it will turn bright red when Draco goes outside during a lightning storm and the first bolt of lightning strikes.
Harry glances back over at him, still sad but thoughtful as well. Good, he needed to really be considering things. “I guess…” Then he takes a deep breath and tries to sit up straighter, despite his drooping shoulders. “Sorry. Nothing against Slytherin, or anything, just…”
” The room jumps when the glamour slams the table Millicent is sitting at, “Does saying my death was ‘deserved’ make your life more
“Now then,” Moody smirks cruelly down at him, suddenly so, so much bigger. Everything is bigger. Every single thing. The castle, the corridor, the professor, the trees.
“That hardly matters, little miss priss,” he smirks over at her, then winks when she puffs out her cheeks in frustration.
“Quit your rambling. I said nothing wrong,” Draco says to his radio with a roll of his eyes. Disagreements - Draco refused to call them arguments, they weren’t worth the title - like these were hardly uncommon between himself and Max. Usually they were mixed in with significantly more pleasant topics, but sometimes they got so heated they wouldn’t speak to each other for days. This one was gearing up to be one of the latter.
“Catch,” Tracey says again, then throws the brain at the witch before turning and bolting. The brain lurches back into motion, tentacles flying out to grab onto Bellatrix as Draco turns to run after Tracey, the sound of Harry, Longbottom, and Weasley somewhere right behind him.
“Like a person,” Draco sneers, mildly offended, but when Potter stays silent he decides to go for a slightly more underhanded method. “Very well, don’t think about yourself, but what about the other people bound to get detention from her? What if she uses the same methods on them?”
“They have nothing to worry about,” Fred - or George? - says with a nod, one hand patting Draco on the shoulder. George - or Fred? - on the far side agrees.
“That dog… looks really familiar,” Potter says slowly, finally sitting up. Draco, momentarily distracted, quickly snaps a picture of Potter with copious amounts of grass and leaves sticking out of his hair.
Draco looks back at McGonagall, eyes big and childlike. “Which do I pick?” he asks. Are certain types better than others? He knew next to nothing about the breeds of owls. Why would he until this point?
“I don’t know what to say,” Draco admits quietly and Harry is sliding out of his bed. He scuffles over, Hedwig on his shoulder, and climbs to sit cross legged on Draco’s bed.
“Oh!” Dobby’s voice seems to brighten, despite Draco’s attempt at dismission. “Dobby remembers that! That is Dobby’s happiest memory!”
“Read, darling. I will handle this. Read and rest,” she instructs, then moves to step out of the room. Draco doesn’t move, though, just staring ahead in numb terror. He doesn’t move for a very long time, but as the seconds tick by he finds the quiet just as horrifying as his aunt’s laughter.
“Umbridge sits in with Dumbledore and your Head of House,” Eve explains, “A pencil pushing desk jockey is precisely what she wants for Draco. Nice, safe, respectable work.”
Harry sighs, shaking his head and not looking at Draco. “Not really. I try to practice my Occlumency, but every night I see it. The same corridor. The same door.” Harry’s lips suddenly pull back into a scowl of frustration and he leans his elbows on his knees. “Knowing what Voldemort is looking for doesn’t help, either. I would have thought, maybe, it could have eased some of the visions, but it just makes me frustrated.”
“Whenever I have fought off the Imperius Curse,” Potter begins, every student very quiet and still, “It was like I had two voices in my head. One was the caster, giving me orders, while the other was my own will. It is… difficult to put into words, if I’m being honest, but the best way to visualize it is to hold onto this stubborn need to not be obedient.”
“Now, where have you been at this time of night, Hushburn?” Blaise questions innocently as Eve plops down in a loveseat of her own.
Thankfully, even with all the simpler tasks, none of the Seeker tryouts are anywhere near as good as Harry, and based on Flint’s scowl he knows that too. Draco quickly advises the three Weasleys not to make any comments, just smile at Flint. That will really infuriate him.
The teenagers are still, staring and uncertain if they’re actually in the clear. Then, Eve gives a sobbing groan. “Why can’t anything we do ever be
“Crabbe and Goyle got distracted by something, I’m not sure what, and Millicent got the drop on them,” Theodore explains, breathing heavy like he’d been running for a while. “Umbridge woke up and got Pansy, then Warrington tried to club me over the head with… fuck, I dunno. It just hurt.”
“My Prince Charming,” Potter sniffles, the shake in his voice sounding like he’d been going for a light and airy tone but failed. Still, Draco goes along with it.
“Trade you for any doubles you have,” he says innocently, ignoring Ron’s cry of betrayal while Harry immediately brightens with a wicked grin.
“Are you good at potions because it’s tradition?” Draco asks, rolling around the smooth sphere, watching how the faint torchlight makes it look like maple syrup.
“I had this spell for detecting lifeforms, right?” Weasley continues, clueless to Harry and Draco’s conversation. “But it was limited and I got bored and I started messing around…”
“Oh, you want to be in Slytherin, little first year? You better watch out, their known for being complete,” Seamus starts then pretends to look around, putting on a show, then leans in and stage whispers, “Jocks!” The boys all gasp dramatically and Hermione, at Draco’s side, rolls her eyes but smiles.
“My name is Ron Weasley!” the Gryffindor calls up, “He’s Draco Malfoy! We’re only students! We wanted to do some research, that’s all!”
The kid - Max - is suddenly sticking out their hand, smiling brightly. Draco eyes the hand nervously. Even as young as he is, Draco has shaken many adult’s hands. Aristocrats, the cream of the crop, high society.
“You know the rules,” Mrs Nubble immediately snaps, voice rising, and Draco is quick to sit down this time. No matter how much he could whine and complain, how angry and pouty he could get, when his foster mother gave a demand he followed it. She was a terrifying woman. Good, but terrifying. “You may read it once I make sure it is both reliable and appropriate,” she says then turns back to the letter.
“Malarkeying is my favorite pastime!” Lee calls, his bouncy dreads falling in his face when he leans over the table.
Eve smirks a little sharper and pulls out something small and cylindrical from her pocket. It looks to be the size of a cigarette but is made of black plastic with a keychain dangling off one end. “I am curious… Now that you’ve been an Animagus for some time now… How much of your animal behaviors have leaked into your human self?”
Draco looks back down at Potter, who seems incredibly focused on every word. “I find it very easy to share my time and my thoughts with you. I am hardly adverse to… hanging out with you as often as I can.”
The sky is clear tonight, the sky a wash of black and dark navy, like a smear of acrylic paint, and coated with brilliant pinpricks of light. It almost feels like Draco is looking up at a gigantic beast with billions of glowing eyes staring back at him.
“I… apologize. I am not here to sell anything. I was actually looking for someone,” says their visitor in a deep, but kind, voice. A voice that is particularly familiar to Draco, and his eyes widen in surprise.
“I honestly think she’d be something like…” Weasley begins, hands flailing a little as he tries to think, “You know those massive pythons?”
Stress writing can really bring you far, can't it? Still uncertain how consistent I'll be with future updates, fair warning, but I hope you all enjoy the new chapter and have a wonderful day! Thank you, also, for all the kind words after last chapter. They mean more than you realize.
“In my nightmares… Sometimes it’s Ron or Hermione. Sometimes Sirius or my parents… Sometimes it’s you…” Potter presses closer, like he’s reaffirming Draco is, in fact, there and alive.
Finally, the Hufflepuffs arrive, looking like they’d all sprinted up here as fast as they could, and Draco wonders why. He has no time to ask any questions, however, because only a moment later Professor Sinistra is gliding into the space. She is wearing a different set of robes than at the Welcoming Feast, but they are still dark with stars along the hems, her pointed hat the same color and covered in constellations. They seem to twinkle as if they had been plucked from the sky themselves.
“You guys really don’t mind?” Draco asks, looking around the room. It was nice of Dean to offer, but he needed to make sure everyone was in agreement. One loose thread could get them all in deep trouble.
“Suppose that would be something to ask Max,” the Slytherin says, but watches as Harry’s face twitches.
He starts going about what he planned to do already; practice his flying maneuvers. Everything feels normal, if a bit slower thanks to the weight of the metal rudder, so he tries for a sharper turn, like the gadget was built for.
at Fleur Delacour to go to the dance with him!” Sophie Roper says with a bright, loud laugh. Her hair, which she can never decide how she wants to style it, is tied into two braids that hang low down her back.
“A variation of the Revelio Charm,” Draco explains, “The Emfanizo Charm forces the truth out of inanimate objects. Weaker objects, however, have a pesky habit of melting after the spell comes to a close, but the Goblet is far too ancient for that.”
“Especially if you could rise multiple,” Harry says in clear amazement. He’s staring at the stone wall with his jaw hanging open, before he’s looking back at Daphne and Astoria. There’s a new light in his eyes, a new determination and respect, and Draco can see the sisters standing up a little straighter.
“Thank you for your wise advice, then, Max,” Draco says sarcastically, opening up the gate and stepping onto the path that leads up to the house’s front door. “I’ll have to get back to you on how helpful it actually was.”
With that Draco readjusts his backpack straps then storms forward, pushing past a shell-shocked Pansy and making his way to the Great Hall for lunch.
The shift he’s practiced a few times out in the forest, he’s gotten better at it, but it still takes a few seconds of visualization before the change properly takes place. Once it is done, however, with the world blossoming out for his senses and that animalistic energy back in his veins, Draco feels more at home than he ever has before.
This was all very good information to have. Draco glances up towards the castle and his eyes catch on the Astronomy Tower. Having a quiet place to go and do what he needed would be incredibly helpful, and he always had been more of a night owl. The library was nice, but to have an even more private space felt like a godsend to Draco.
“Maybe it’s because its been years, but I just don’t remember you being so… like, listen Draco…” Max struggles for a moment to find their wording and Draco glances over at the radio, expectantly. “Like, you’re not white, you’re translucent.”
“It sounds like an indecisive old person after they’re asked what game they wanna play at the retirement home. ‘What would you like to play today, Margo?’ ‘Let’s see, uhhh. What do I want to play? Hmmm, oh heavens… Why not… Ummm, Bridge?”
“There was a diner just across the way,” Max’s mother offers, releasing Draco’s shoulder, “Why don’t we visit there. Will your parents be alright with this, Draco, or should we stay here?”
“Hi there, Malfoy,” Creevey greets with a bright smile, “I got your shutter fixed! Sorry it took so long.”
“Who says I still have it? What if it was shattered?” Harry snaps, buying them time. Wasn’t the Order supposed to be on their way? Draco had left Hogwarts so abruptly after contacting Sirius that he wasn’t sure how long they would take.
“Okay, well!” Daphne cuts them both off, voice raised, before she takes a deep, audible breath, body relaxing. “My point in all this is… Astoria and I developed a new spell we’d like to teach everyone.”
“Blimey…” Weasley looks between the two boys, his eyes wide and his eyebrows so far up they nearly disappear in his fringe. “You told me about his help last year, but to actually see it… I feel like I’ve fallen into the wrong timeline.”
Draco blinks in surprise, realizing something with a very humanoid face is staring back at him. It is blurry, the shape still a bit of a distance away in the water, but slowly Draco raises his hand to wave. No response.
He stares at Potter, slack jawed, and he must look like a right fool. He certainly feels like one, left speechless by a… what even was that? A passing compliment, really. It hardly meant anything. He and Potter weren’t on the worst of terms anymore, they could compliment each other. It was allowed.
“I’ll see what I can find, Professor,” Draco says with a bow of his head, then swiftly ducks out of the storeroom, having no intention to help his godfather at all.
“Oh! Can we get Hermione, too? She must need to get her things as well, right?” he asks. He and Hermione had never gone to the same school before, so it sounded rather exciting to go get his supplies with her. He wanted to talk to her about everything, anyway. They hadn’t had a chance, yet.
Draco stares at him, manic and frightened and not sure what to trust. He’s shaking, can see it in his wand, and he still feels the fresh tear tracks on his face.
“You’re really not as graceful as you try to have people believe,” the Gryffindor observes, hand coming over to shove the blond, wet strands back and away.
“Fine,” Draco sighs in response. His bedroom door is locked, which he’s been doing a lot more of recently, and he’s sitting on his bed trying to organize he school supplies for his new year at Hogwarts. He has his books arranged by subjects, his supplies arranged by color and size, his clothes set out and folded, and now he is carding through his “miscellaneous” section.
Draco takes a moment to look down at himself. He was wearing a black turtleneck and some comfortable jeans and green “Chuck Taylor” shoes sent to him from his Muggle family over the holidays. He’d considered wearing the Weasley jumper, but he knew he couldn’t be seen around the castle with that.
Potter and Granger both begin joining Draco, and sometimes Eve, in the library after that. This both irritates and baffles Draco, but with his fellow Slytherin acting cool and collected it wouldn’t do for him to snap at them too harshly.
But has he really? He essentially ran into an active war zone with a bunch of his friends, who are as much inexperienced teenagers as he is, with a plan he sorted out as he got there, and then ended up being stuck as a cat majority of the time without the ability to cast spells. The Order showed up, anyway. Couldn’t Draco have just stayed out of it, left the professionals one less idiot kid to worry about? They would have shown up, saved the day, and Draco could have welcomed them all back with a snarky comment about checking with the Order first next time.
Although… he is beginning to look displeased as he sits down on Harry’s far side, not at all happy to be delving into pureblood politics.
They look to be cheering just like everyone else but seem tense at the same time. Hermione, Ron, and Seamus all have their wands in hand and keep glancing across the pitch at the staff stands. All of the teachers and visiting parents sit there, bundled up for the cooling weather, and clapping at a much more subdued rate than the students (except for James).
“What was next?” he asks, half to himself as he balances his books in one arm and pulls out the supply list again. “Wand, cauldron, set of phials, telescope, and brass scales.”
No, he hadn’t been up close, or even known who died until later, but it didn’t change the fact that he’d witnessed a death that night. He’d then had plenty of time to come to terms with it, which he doubted Potter had managed…
There is a burning, but nothing Draco read or heard could have prepared him for this. It is like every cell in his body has set itself on fire, his muscles pulling and popping and tearing, bones reassembling, organs adjusting. It is like an after-work out muscle burn that permeates every inch of his being like a steady flow of lava.
Why… Draco Malfoy… I’d even go so far as to say that you…” Potter pauses for dramatic effect, which he is awful at and should just leave to the professionals, before he sets his hands over his own chest, eyes big. “Have a heart of gold.”
For a moment Potter simply looks at him, sizing him up, suspicious but interested, before he’s smirking too and turning to his team. “Start warming up, guys. This won’t be long.”
A sudden series of pops sets off somewhere behind them and Draco looks back as Seamus stares, wide-eyed, as his potion seems to morph into a cacophony of fireworks, exploding rapidly within his cauldron like pop rocks. It’s enough to startle Neville, who drops what look to be porcupine quills into his cauldron and his own potion bubbles then quickly overflows, melting away his cauldron as it does.
Sophie Roper had always had a talent for self-transfiguration. She could transfigure her hair every morning into any style she felt like for the day - she’d even done an undercut on Draco’s birthday - and over the years she had gotten better and better at glamours and alterations to her appearance that suited her mood and rivaled that of a metamorphmagus.
“I’ll make sure to tell everyone you’re a prissy little git with no sense of decency and a penchant for social murder.”
Draco keeps his head ducked, staring at his tea, and hiding the smirk that has begun playing on his lips. So ironic she would bring up trust and betrayal in this situation.
“I guess. I’m looking forward to Charms, I think. I like thinking about all the spells I could use day to day,” the boy replies, taking over the conversation again. Draco would usually have been rather put off by that, but he didn’t have enough knowledge on what they were talking about to really contribute. “I can’t wait to get sorted, too! Uncle Sirius and dad tried to trick me into thinking I’d have to fight the giant squid to get sorted, but mom hexed them and told me it was just a hat.”
“AND you care about Max,” Harry offers back and Draco shakes his head, hand coming up to scrub at his blond strands until they're messy and unkempt.
The Death Eaters descended eventually, however, demanding Harry remove the prophecy for their Dark Lord. They’d been furious that their plan hadn’t worked the way they’d wanted, but Harry had kept arguing, saying he’d smash the prophecy, first.
“Well, before she died she had the portrait permanently stuck to the wall of the Black Estate so she could heckle and demean everyone that didn’t fit her ‘perfect pureblooded agenda’,” Potter says, then raises up his own cup to gobble down the top of the ice creams swirl, seemingly unbothered by the lack of utensils.
“Guess you really will have to become a professor to right this terrible wrong,” he’d said and Harry had shoved his side playfully.
“You sure you have enough?” Draco snarks, eying the food on the boy’s plate and Harry gives him an unhappy look.
Mr. Davis is silent, staring at Draco blankly, before his head tilts to the side. “Magic is full of loopholes. I would not test it, however.”
” followed by a strong flick of their wand has all of them save Granger getting flung backwards by the force of the blast.
“Remember when you were first learning how to play the violin?” Max replies without hesitation, “You nearly cried because you thought you couldn’t do it right and you’d never be a master, but it turns out you’d just not tuned it.”
When they turn the corner into a quiet corridor, though, the show ends and Draco stops to deflate, letting out a loud breath and leaning forward to brace himself on his knees. Hermione is beside him a moment later, patting his shoulder, but grinning and trying to hold back giggles.
“Nothing. I admit, I am far more accustomed to my wand,” Draco responds, rolling his feather between his fingers and eying it in agitation. Longbottom had managed to get his a few inches off the ground earlier, before he’d lost focus. How embarrassing to be shown up by that halfwit.
“No promises,” Vivian shrugs then winks at the two before she disappears to the third year, girl’s dorm. It leaves Harry and Draco to slip into their own dorm room and change out of their day-old clothes. Blaise, who is always awake first, gives them both a thoughtful stare as they enter before shrugging and going about his business.
“I’m Draco Malfoy,” he decides to take pity on him, his voice calm but his insides coiling up. Were they going to freak out or be cool? He didn’t know.
“Was he there?” Hermione asks, voice sharp and panicky. Around them the DA members are back on their feet or being helped up by the conscious Slytherins.
“Pink skin, you say?” Hermione repeats, frantically flipping through a book on anatomy and skin diseases, all kinds of other books scattered around the table. Draco has no idea where she digs up most of what she finds when they visit the library, but he has learned never to ask too many questions.
“It is rather disheartening,” Draco mumbles, mostly as an afterthought. Theodore shrugs, not really caring, but Draco doesn’t mind. People were talking about the articles and their implications right here in Hogwarts. This wasn’t something that was happening out in the Wizarding World outside of Draco’s view. This was happening here, with Draco’s peers.
Weasley also managed to weasel - pun not intended - another bag of PopRocks out of Malfoy. He had had four shrunken down bags in total when first arriving, and now he had two. He hadn’t wanted to hand over another bag, but Granger had given him a very pathetic pair of puppy-eyes and Potter had picked that time to lunge for an M&M, distracting Draco.
“Did it now?” the muggleborn retorts and Draco scowls as he looks back at them. They all look rather entertained.
Potter makes a face that clearly demonstrates exactly what he thinks of those ideas and Draco moves on. “You’ll just need to outsmart it, then. Do you know exactly what will be required of you?”
It was a scrawny thing, all skin and bones, with black, matted fur, a missing, left eye, and shaking like a leaf in Theodore’s hands.
“Fun,” Draco cringes, knowing full well what it felt like to have a parent more obsessed with his future betrothed than he ever would be.
But when Draco had gotten down to the Great Hall only Granger could be spotted at the Gryffindor table. Potter was gone. All of the Weasleys were gone. And none of them popped up through their classes.
“Fine,” Draco sighs as, just as quickly as it had started, the pain vanished, leaving him hyperaware of the beating of his heart. He takes a moment to catch his breath before gulping and glancing back at the two teachers, but neither are paying attention to him. “Who are those two teachers?” he questions and Pansy looks over where he’s pointing. It’s Harry who answers, however.
“That pisses me off too, actually,” he says when Eve moves back to measuring out where she wanted to shave. “Whatever Edgecombe decided, she still would have been a threat to the DA because of Chang. She shouldn’t have said anything to her, friend or not. She put the whole plan in danger by spilling it to the nearest Ravenclaw she knew.”
Draco imagines her saying and smirks to himself. He scratches lightly at her head and then she’s turning away to probably go searching for food. Snowflake remains, staring up at Draco without moving, almost like he’s waiting for something.
“Serves you right,” Harry hisses, not at all in a good mood, and Draco hurries to relay the new password Theodore had forgotten.
Except Eve is right about the tourist thing and both boys are immediately turned off when, standing at the entrance to the gardens, they hear a nearby child start screaming in an American accent about wanting to go to Disney World.
“These photos could have easily been tampered with,” Fudge says sharply, looking far more bothered than is appropriate for a politician.
Draco, still with his Slytherin ring, really can’t dredge up the desire to be upset by this, his emotional connection to that ring dwindling over the years, and his photo collection soon includes a very proud Ronald Weasley, wearing the ring upside down, and flaunting it like a woman’s engagement ring. Pansy even steps in to advise him on proper model poses.
“I… don’t think they are, actually,” Blaise cuts in, moving suddenly from his spot against the wall to crouch beside Draco. He sets a hand between the snow leopard’s shoulder blades, urging him to settle down, and Draco does grudgingly. He doesn’t take his eyes off the figures, though.
The Golden Trio plus Draco. Draco assisting the Golden Trio. The Golden Trio and their silent accomplice.
“He had a vision of you being tortured! He thought he was seeing what was really happening, like with Mr. Weasley, but CLEARLY that’s not the case!”
“Easily. The Trace detects magic that occurs around the underage witch or wizard, not just the magic done by them.”
He has to pause a moment, his brows furrowing, either in concentration or trying to remember how to cast his own spell. After a few moments, he raises his wand and places the tip against his own temple, shutting his eyes.
When they leave the locker room there are people already waiting for them. James Potter surges forward first and promptly scoops Harry up, hugging him and swinging him through the air.
“I actually needed some water,” he admits casually and it makes Draco snort, Harry’s green eyes glittering with mirth.
“I think you and Hermione are doing great,” Harry retorts, taking a step up to stand beside Draco. He’s still smirking.
Harry snorts, giggling under his breath, as Draco’s eyes widen. “She didn’t,” he argues, disbelieving, but Eve just smirks wider.
“Quit that!” Granger hisses, lurching forward to smack Draco’s hands down, looking back frantically at Krum before shrinking into her own chair.
It had been Weasley who had met them out there, the ginger volunteering to go into the woods and fetch a centaur while Potter remained inside, within Umbridge’s view, and Granger attempted to convince the house elves to also take part in the interviews later in the day.
In each class, even their Herbology class with Ravenclaw on Tuesdays and Thursdays or their Charms class with Hufflepuff on Wednesdays, Harry sticks by Draco’s side. Draco suspects it is because they’re the only ones who knew each other prior to their sorting, but it does begin to concern the blonde.
“Ah, you’ve found our lava lamps!” Terry says brightly, skipping after Draco when he moves to get a closer look, his mouth hanging open and his eyes wide as he watches the mesmerizing-- Wait, did she just say “lava?!”
“This is Ron,” Harry tells Hagrid, motioning to the redhead, who is beginning to struggle to keep Fang from knocking him over. “I’ve told you about him before.”
“Yes, Max, I was stabbed. But I’m going to be fine,” Draco promises with an eye roll. It was sweet that they were worried, but was this reaction really necessary?
“DON’T!” Longbottom somehow manages to scream through his agony, writhing at such an angle to stare at Harry. He can’t say more beyond that, but it’s enough to halt Harry. Draco wonders if they’ve forgotten the prophecy record’s a fake. If they just gave his father the stupid orb then Longbottom could be freed.
“That’s it! Sorry you gotta deal with that toad…” the Muggle trails off momentarily, before coming back with, “Hey, do’ya think she’d turn back into a prince if a princess kissed her?”
“I had a vision,” Harry says urgently, his eyes wild and his hands curling around Draco’s arms, too. “It was of Sirius. He was being tortured at the Department of Mystery and I… There wasn’t anyone I could talk to so I went to floo Grimmauld Place.”
Eve goes on ahead to get them passes, taking some of Draco’s money with her, and gets herself a camera pass so long as she keeps the flash off.
“Have witches and wizards not made it to the moon, yet?” Draco asks, suddenly curious, and the table quickly turns to him with raised brows, looking incredulous.
“Ohhh, I haven’t had a GalaxTea in ages!” Weasley says brightly, their group already heading for the stand.
He can’t help but think, however, that there’s no way a change to his and his family’s lifestyles could be considered a good thing. They’re at the top of everything… so wouldn’t a change only lead to something bad for them?
No, Draco needed a diversion to get in, something to keep Moody’s attention long enough to get past the lock, and a way to be both sneaky and fast if he needed a quick getaway.
“I clearly do not require to go over the process of becoming an Animagus, since you have already done so,” McGonagall pauses to give Draco a displeased glare and he averts his eyes to her desk. “But I suspect you lack tutelage on the matter of what comes after.”
“You’ll be fine. I want to know what happened to you at the Ministry, though,” now Harry is looking concerned, stepping up to Draco and setting his hands on the taller boy’s arms. “You’re soaked! What happened to you and Ron? Are you both okay?”
The lessons, being a very relaxed thing, also allowed students to leave whenever they pleased. Sinistra made it very clear that this was an optional lesson, and if a student needed to study or work on homework, then they should leave and do that first.
Luna, with a sereneness about her, smiles and offers to take the cup. The mediwitch huffs, but allows the Ravenclaw to help, and Draco sucks down as much water as he can as soon as the straw is within reach. He tries to smile at Luna gratefully, but it quickly vanishes. He has too many questions to be distracted for long.
Draco snarls out in frustration, attempting to gather himself and think of the bigger picture. He doesn’t get far, however, his brain going back to Potter, Potter, idiot, Potter. He had to get to him immediately. He had to make sure he was okay, get some answers, and knock some sense into his stupid head.
“Oh?” That had Draco curious, wondering what secret projects might go down in a place like Hogwarts. But Harry just shrugs, not knowing what it could mean. They look back at the schedule. Herbology is the next class they’ll have today, which Draco hopes he will find calming like tending to the gardens back home, and after that is Charms then Transfiguration.
Draco pauses only a moment, eying the hand and this Harry Potter thoughtfully. Then, with a small smile of his own, he reaches out and shakes his hand. “Nice to meet you, Harry Potter.”
It turned out to be a vinyl. A vinyl with the picture of a naked baby boy floating in water and the name “Nirvana” written on the bottom left. Draco had stared at the picture in baffled, disturbed awe before picking up the note that had been inside.
Draco would stay longer, catch up with Sirius and make sure everything is okay, but he sees the distinct visage of Rita Skeeter in the window, making her way to the door. Her presence is sure to insight a fight with the Gryffindors, especially after her piece on Hagrid’s heritage, and Draco isn’t in the mood for that right now.
“We’re able to sneak around for a little while, but they kept finding us,” Ginny says, glaring off at the far wall. “This is our first breather since we got here.”
Draco and Harry exchange one more look, amused and baffled by these two women, before chuckling and looking down at their food.
But Harry had looked strange. He kept nodding off, head bobbing, as if he hadn’t gotten enough sleep. Sure, it was a boring subject, but he was usually able to stay focused throughout.
He looked over to McGonagall with an excited, determined light in his silver eyes. “I want to go. What do I need to do?”
“What are… SS soldiers?” Draco asks curiously when he and the Muggle family return to the museum after “linner.” He still thinks the name is silly, but he’s in surprisingly higher spirits now than before. Muggle food was delicious and their music was infectious and their interior design could be just as intriguing as a wizard’s. Who knew?
“I don’t think there’s a way to make them stop, bud. My mom taught me about these things called ‘intrusive thoughts’ when I was younger. I’d have these awful, nightmare level images in my head, or these impulses that scared me, and I’d get so scared I’d run to her crying. We nicknamed them ‘daymares.’
Then, like a splash of cold water, he crashes. He thinks he hasn’t moved, but it feels like he lands back into his body after taking a very violent trip outside of it. His body shivers and his brain struggles to make the adjustment that these muscles and bones and organs are different, but still his.
“Did… did she…?” he asks weakly. Had what just happened to him been foul play? Had Vivian done it and Harry stopped her? But the older girl hardly seemed the type to attack anyone unprovoked. Or try to kill someone at all, for that matter.
Sagging slightly he steps back, hands falling uselessly to his sides as he stares out into the water. Had that really happened? Had he really managed to communicate with one of the merpeople? Despite the emptiness still in his chest from the nightmare, Draco begins to feel elated. Except… will it happen again? He’d hardly count that as a proper conversation. He’d very much like to speak with Augi many, many more times. Or any merperson.
“That is usually correct, yet you have shown more skill in one demonstration than most of our past tryouts,” Sinistra says, not looking up from her writing. “The other reason is due to brooms. First years, if they choose to try out, must use school brooms, which are subpar,” Draco glances down at the broom he had been flying on. He had no idea if it was subpar like she said, he’d only ever flown on these ones and he’d felt invigorated. Were they really so bad? Everyone certainly thought so.
“Whoa…” Draco whispers, thankful McGonagall isn’t rushing him through just yet, letting him absorb the place.
“I’m afraid so. Wizards like my father and the Death Eaters and Voldemort… They have manipulated society to believe something else… and at one point I believed it too,” Draco sighs deeply. “Leandra
“I’ve got you, Harry. Don’t worry,” Sirius whispers and Draco opens his eyes long enough to see Sirius morph into his dog form, then jump onto the bed and curl up at the foot.
” he says firmly, eyes staying squeezed shut for a moment longer, then he lowers his wand and opens his eyes.
The boats are four each, with Hagrid taking up one for himself, and Draco ends up with Hermione, Harry, and Ron. He’s surprised Vincent and Greg hadn’t hopped in their boat first, what with how they have been following them around like lost puppies, but when Neville nearly loses Trevor while trying to trip into a boat the two go over to assist him, joined last by a girl with blonde, curly hair.
“But why not? You aren’t giving me a reason here, Granger,” Draco scowls. Whenever he got particularly heated or frustrated he tended to use people’s last names while addressing them. It was a curious habit he picked up from Mrs Nubble, a lawyer that only called her clients by their last names.
He looks back, confused and irritated, but pauses when he sees Theodore Nott holding him in place, eyes wide and clearly anxious. All the other Slytherins, along with most of the students actually, are looking around at what they must perceive as empty air. But not Theodore.
“Tell me, you mentioned having fairies in your garden, did you not?” Draco asks. “I’d imagine they must look stunning in this moonlight. What do you think?” Growing up in a noble house like Malfoy meant Draco knew how to talk to people to get what he wanted. Flattery and saying exactly what they wanted to hear.
A few days before Draco’s eleventh birthday his father comes to sit with him in the manor library, a book in his hand. Draco, always happy to spend any amount of time with his father, immediately perks up and smiles brightly.
“She isn’t my pet!” Draco calls, then glares at Muddy, whose head waves back and forth leisurely. “She and the other two just… leave me be. And listen to me complain.” Draco’s scowl returns. “And she really shouldn’t be here!”
Draco thinks, despite the firm and assured words, Harry would very much like to be here when the Order shows up. He’s been fighting this fight for so long, he likely wants to see it through, with or without approval, but Harry has always put his friends first and he’s going to see them to safety no matter what.
This still held true now, but sometimes, without warning, it would grow tense and suffocating. Draco didn’t know exactly how he knew when the change occurred, but he did, and usually a glance over at Potter was enough to explain why.
No, the first thought in Draco’s head is how he forgot to pull his curtains closed and that he and Harry have been in complete view of his dormmates this whole time. Dormmates who Draco still isn’t sure he can one hundred percent trust. Dormmates who could, very easily, go tell Umbridge everything they saw.
“Oh my god, what do I do? What do people do to approach their crush?” For a while Max just begins stuttering out panicked, terrified questions, unable to handle the realization that they do, in fact, have a bit of a crush on the new kid. Draco listens, not interrupting, and finding the whole come apart positively hilarious, but also completely bizarre.
“She’s wrong if she turned you down,” he says with feeling once he’s gotten his breathing back under control and he watches Potter bite his lip and look away. “I’m not wrong, Potter,” he insists roughly, “Anyone would be lucky to—”
“Have you ever heard the phrase ‘blood is thicker than water,’ Draco?” Yes, of course he had. The purebloods loved that saying. “Did you know the full saying is actually ‘blood of the covenant is thicker than water of the womb’? It means the blood we shed in battle, or shed when swearing over a covenant, will always be stronger than simple genetics.”
When they get to Platform 9 ¾ Draco does as suggested, waiting and peering out the window until Eve’s mother has hustled her daughter out and away, the Muggle woman unfazed by the witches and wizards around her, completely ignoring any sneers or glares from purebloods.
“More based on what we value,” Draco corrects with a half shrug. The greenhouses are vacant since every student is preparing to head home after a busy school year. Everyone was talking about their former DADA teacher, Professor Quirrell, and how he had been found out for practicing dark magic. Most everyone was shocked and claiming they were glad he was gone. Most of the Slytherins were saying how they wished he could have taught them something.
A tension fills the room at these words and Draco looks over where the girl is lounging at one of the tables, smirking viciously at him like she’d won something.
“That one” turns out to be Ron Weasley, who is standing beside Potter, and looking like he might want to throw up. Or punch something, which seems more in character.
“Now I need you to breathe,” he whispers, voice wet, and Potter lets out a weak, shaky chuckle, shifting to stick his face into Draco’s neck. He makes a point of heaving a few times for air, just to appease the blonde, and Draco, still sniffling, buries his own face in Potter’s curls.
“She is attempting to make decisions for herself while fully conscious that these decisions could have dire consequences to her mother’s position and her family’s reputation, but if she went against Dumbledore’s Army she would be going against her best friend Cho and any trust she has built up with the other students, likely ruining her own, personal reputation rather than her family’s,” Tracey says blankly, her big eyes focused on her braiding.
, Draco wants to remind them, eyes tracking one very stern ghost that… oh god, is he covered in blood?
And they are certainly glad they followed as they all watch, with varying degrees of alarm and humor, as a tawny owl swoops out of nowhere and snatches the letter from Mrs Nubble’s hand. The poor woman shrieks in alarm, but appears unharmed, and the owl is flying into the distance as she hurries back into the house.
The remainder of Christmas break is strained. Draco stays one more night at the Hushburn apartment, reading with Eve and speaking cordially with her mother, who is a charming, straight-forward, spitfire of a woman. He’d especially taken a liking to her after the whole brandishing a kitchen knife at a group of witches and wizards, as a Muggle, and demanding they get their shit together.
since last year just before the final task, so they all knew there were plenty of spells within it that were safe to learn.
“The Space Room,” Draco announces, then steps around Saturn, ducking under its rings, beckoning Weasley to follow, then pointing up at the ceiling. The files Draco had obsessively researched when he had been looking into the Lung Dragon had told him exactly where to go. “We can reach the Unhideable Hall right through there.”
Draco immediately puffs up, standing straight and proper, before bowing to Lucius. “Thank you for this opportunity, father.”
With all of their apparent drama dealt with, the two boys are prepared to send up sparks for the other search party to come and find them, but are interrupted by the arrival of a centaur.
“What’s wrong, Harry?” Hermione cuts in quickly, voice raised more than usual, and the two boys look over in surprise, like they’d forgotten where they were. Well, Weasley looks surprised, Blaise just looks purposefully bored.
Arthur Weasley had been found, attacked by Voldemort, in said Department of Mysteries. Voldemort, if he was attempting to get something from this place, would not have drawn attention to it by dragging Mr. Weasley’s body there, so logically Mr. Weasley was already down there.
Judging by the Muggleborn’s very unpleased expression that probably wasn’t the best thing to say, but Draco’s question still stands. He never gets an answer, though, because the other boy’s robes get finished up right then and he gets ushered away.
“Food must be good; no one’s talking,” Draco hears a girl with straight, mousey hair tied into a ponytail - Daphne Greengrass - say a few seats down and he glances over. She must realize he’s looking because she glances up, turns pink, then clears her throat. “Sorry. Dad always says that.”
There is silence as the hall waits for the verdict, the hat wiggling so much it turns Harry’s head back and forth, but then there’s no call. Draco’s brows furrow as he waits and waits, but nothing happens. Whispers begin to pick up, mostly just kids going back to their conversations while they wait, but a few wondering why it was taking so long. Draco glances up at the head table and sees Lily watching her son with poorly masked worry, tapping her nails on the table as they wait.
“Oh, THANKS!” Draco snaps, panic turning to anger in a last bid to keep himself sane, “I hadn’t thought of tha-- AAH!” The broom suddenly lurches straight downward and for a split, horrifying second Draco is free falling, hands scrambling for purchase, and he only just manages to grab ahold of the broom handle before it can get away. He clings for his dear life and, for a second, the broom is still.
Not too long after that the Malfoy’s do return home to their manor, but it offers little comfort for the small six-year-old. He is young and growing, but even he can tell he is about to learn a lot about his parents he isn’t sure he wants to know.
“I think that was ‘good night,’” Harry guesses, still looking rather pale. Draco nods, then looks at Hermione pleadingly. Before he can ask if there is any way they can stay the night someone else speaks up from behind them.
“What else can we do?” Granger replies, “That’s likely why they never told us anything, so we wouldn’t stress over it.”
He doubted he’d fit into that Hufflepuff one. Sure, he was loyal, but only when he wanted to be, and considering his only friend was a friend out of necessity because they were both weirdos in their homes… no, he certainly wasn’t friendly.
All in all, it is a great start to Draco’s day, even if the beginning was a little rough. He still has plenty he wants to say in defense of his house, but he knows now isn’t the time, especially when he has so little to prove them all wrong. He has only been here for two days, after all. That was hardly enough time to erase stereotypes and reputations that had been building for centuries.
“Plenty of pureblood families have magical heirlooms,” Draco begins, earning all the girls’ attention, “Malfoy Manor is full of them. But I’ve never heard of one that
“I still think you should have said something sooner. At least to us,” Granger gives Draco a displeased look, but he just shrugs her off. Her “lecture” voice really didn’t work that well on him.
“That’s a big word, Weasley, are you sure you know what it means?” Draco smirks and Weasley throws an inappropriate hand sign at him in retaliation.
The one time Draco had managed to get up to Moody’s office without his notice, only made possible thanks to a diversion from the twins, he’d found his next obstacle. The door was locked tight, and while Draco thought he’d be able to spell it open in no time, that was the moment Draco had heard Moody approaching once more and Draco had to flee.
“Quite,” she whispers before hurrying off once more. If Draco didn’t know any better he would think his foster mother was fleeing, but he did know better, and not a moment later she reappeared with Draco’s letter in her hand. It had to be the most recent letter since all the others would be in the trash. Already she had composed herself, while everyone else was still in a state of shock at witnessing something that should just not be possible.
“I got her after I met you, actually,” Draco replies, reaching a hand through the cage bars to scratch lightly at the owl’s shoulder.
“Well, I must say our positions are quite reversed now,” Draco offers another shrug, “It does not make sense to accuse you of these… ridiculous claims. And, because I am fully capable of admitting when I am wrong, you are not, truly, obsessed in fame and glory.”
“What is the meaning of this?!” McGonagall demands, spotting the fallen troll and the group of gathered students. Her eyes are flashing with fury as she stares down at the children and Sinistra breezes past, impassive, to check the beast.
“Feed a man a fish, he is fed for a day. Teach a man to fish, he is fed for a lifetime,” Granger suddenly speaks up, startling Draco, and he hadn’t realized she and Weasley had stopped bickering to listen in.
“PLEASE, Malfoy!” Potter near screams, making Draco attempt to take a step back, “We don’t have much time, we need to hurry, and we need your camera!”
“Well, yeah, because you’re usually being a knob,” Max cackles, making Draco roll his eyes, “But… you do know that if I was there, and we ran into all these people that bother you so much, that I’d back you up, right?”
Draco’s brows are furrowed by this point, not sure exactly what was just said to him, and it looks like Ollivander might be laughing at him a little. “I remember every wand I sell, you see,” the old wizard supplies, then his silvery eyes flick past Draco and his smile brightens a little bit. “Ah, Professor McGonagall - fir, dragon heartstring, 9 ½ inches - how is yours suiting you?”
“Asphodel and wormwood create a powerful sleeping potion called the Draught of Living Death,” Hermione says eagerly, voice a little too fast, and Lily claps a few times excitedly.
” he says clearly and shadowy wisps jump from his wand, merging and shifting until they trot onto the ground as a puffy, arctic fox. Draco is still mesmerized by how the shadows move within the Militus, how they look like wrought iron but alive.
Harry stops talking, sucking in a breath as suddenly his arms are full of a very human Draco, the Slytherin’s hands coming up to frame Harry’s face, holding him steady. “I was scared, too. There were so many things that could have gone wrong, so many ways someone could have gotten hurt…” Draco takes a deep breath as he leans forward and rests their foreheads together. “But it’s all over now and we’re here. Safe.”
“You,” he answers, easily enough, and he wishes they had better light to see if Harry might be blushing. “Different thoughts of you…”
running rampant and tormenting the local Muggles?! Just a few moments before Draco had been enjoying himself, and now there was chaos!
Draco hurls a Stinging Jinx into Potter’s shoulder, making the other boy cry out in surprise and clutch the struck, and surely swelling, spot. Despite his clear discomfort, the Gryffindor pulls out his wand, too, and glares at Draco defiantly.
“Oh, you won’t,” she hums sweetly and Draco looks back to see what she’s looking at. Longbottom, nose still dripping blood, has stiffened under her gaze, scowling despite the terror in his eyes. “Hello there, little Longbottom,” Bellatrix coos and it sends shivers down Draco’s spine. “Did you know I had the pleasure of meeting your parents, boy? They’re screams were like music to my ears.”
be quite a frightening thing,” Draco admits, but he is still having a hard time grasping the idea that his own father would be frightened of anything like that.
“She probably insulted them before asking for an interview,” Eve sighs with a roll of her eyes. Draco grunts an unfortunate agreement before finally sliding the paper back to Harry. “So, what creature is your ringer?” Eve asks, taking a sip of her coffee.
“Not unless the culprit is a pureblood that they trust and, thus, their Trace records are generally ignored,” Draco flippantly. “Good for them, as they attempt to fix the blunder they have a very willing underage wizard at their disposal to help them out.”
There are a few more knick-knacks and toys, like a Rubik’s cube, a bouncy ball, something called an etch a sketch, another weird thing called a GameBoy, and, finally, at the bottom of the box, is a beanie baby snow leopard.
“Oh, Draco,” Granger suddenly says, pulling out a sheet of parchment from her bag and setting it down on the table, “You never signed the list for the DA.”
“I’m Ebru. Poppy Ebru,” the woman says, then waves long, frightening looking fingers at Draco. “What do you think you’re doing here, huh? You’re not supposed to be down here. Trip into the wrong room and a brat like you could cause some real damage somewhere like the Hall of Prophecy.”
They dance over to the pair, greeting them and earning a smile from Granger and a nod from Krum. “Mind if we cut in?” Eve asks and the four of them pause dancing with their partners to temporarily switch up. Except, as Krum is offering his hand to Eve like a proper gentleman, Eve brushes past him and sweeps Granger into a spin, making the girl laugh in surprise.
Snape’s robes very nearly crack like a whip as he swings around, pointing the spoon he had been using directly at Draco, a very cold fury deep in his eyes. “You will not use that word around me again,” he says, his voice far too controlled for the look on his face. It sends dangerous chills up Draco’s spine and he stiffens, eyes widening in shock. “Do you understand, Draco Malfoy?”
“Yes, very good! That was a tough one, so ten points to Gryffindor,” she says and Hermione beams, chest puffing out as she’s praised. “Now, next question. What is a bezoar and where would one find it?” Again, Hermione’s hand shoots up, but this time Lily’s smile on her is patient, “Give the other students a chance, Miss. Granger, but hold onto your answer just in case.” Slowly Hermione lowers her hand, pouting.
Umbridge has snapped. That’s the only way Draco can explain it, watching as she raises her wand at them, her eyes wide, hair wild, and a deranged smile beginning to yank at her mouth.
The corridor, and what Draco is very tentatively identifying as Moody’s scent - which is positively rancid and smells like a poorly made potion instead of a man - leads not further into the castle, but instead right back out. Draco ends up making one big U, growing more and more confused as he hops back out onto the ground.
Longbottom raises his shears and Draco, momentarily distracted by everything that has just been said, notices too late the other boy’s mistake.
The wand is snatched out of his hand and put back away. “No, certainly not,” he mumbles before he begins digging around again. He returns with another wand. “Rowan, dragon heartstring, 11 ¾ inches.” Again, Draco takes the wand and waves it. This time the bell on the front desk pops up into the air before falling back with a loud, clattering noise. Ollivander snatches that one away, too.
” he says lowly, clearly, and from his wand shadows begin to emerge, curling around each other and compressing. Twisting, moving designs like wrought iron, like they had been on Sinistra’s cobra, now curl around the form of a sly-looking fox. Draco’s Militus stares back at him, sitting regally on the carpet, its pinprick eyes unnerving.
” Harry near shouts and Draco releases his hand so he can twist and drag Harry into a proper hug again. He holds him tight, lets him bury his face into Draco’s chest, and feels fingers curl against his biceps until it hurts.
“Professor Sinistra,” he calls, once everyone else is gone, and the tall woman looks over, her expression blank. She wasn’t a very expressive woman, but she was fair and informative, if blunt. “I had a question about your time at Uagadou.”
“He just offered to cast an Unforgiveable!” Potter finally specifies, but he doesn’t get the reaction he’s clearly looking for.
“Yeah, I did. He was looking through his camera when they found him, but the insides of the camera were all melted.”
“I’ll still say you helped me with Astronomy homework,” Draco mumbles and Sinistra nods in acceptance, before folding her hands on top of her desk and watching Draco quietly. She waits, unmoving and unaffected, until Draco realizes she’s waiting for him to explain himself.
Remus Lupin smirks back at him, wand still raised as the Death Eaters continue their own assault. “Quite the rebellious one, I see,” his former professor observes with a wink, seemingly calm, before turning back to the battle at hand.
Perhaps it would have helped Potter more if Granger and Weasley could have joined them; created a fuller picture for the boy and helped him recover. Maybe they could have brought that happy look into his eyes a few more times.
Afterwards Draco feels drawn, but strangely content. Not happy, but respected. A bigger picture of his parents, and the world around them, has been made for him and he feels better in knowing it.
What a joke! Draco knew that Wizards and Muggles shared a good deal of knowledge when it came to the study of space, but that was all it was. Study. Draco’s father had made it very clear that any story he heard about Muggles travelling to space, circling the planet, and landing on the moon was simply propaganda. Muggles were too stupid to accomplish something like that.
“I don’t have an anatomy class either,” Max says flippantly before proceeding to outline the hand bones. “Carpus, metacarpus, and phalanges. The carpus is located in the heel of the hands and--”
“It is bullshit,” Draco snaps back and Potter turns to glare at him. “I didn’t agree to crouching around, my legs getting cramped, and branches poking every last part of me!”
“How did you find me, Potter?” Draco questions, voice low, honestly curious and unable to dredge up the accusatory tone he’d managed before.
“AND YOU DIDN’T TELL ME UNTIL NOW?!” Max roars, finally finding their voice again, and Draco scowls.
It doesn’t take Sophie long at all to trim then shave Draco’s hair into something acceptable, but she does take her time styling and lecturing on how to manage the strands. Draco has no choice but to listen along to the crazy girl with the multiple sharp implements at his back, but he doesn’t really mind. It’s nice getting to know someone he was already familiar with.
Draco Malfoy wasn’t present for the celebratory feast at the end of his second year at Hogwarts. After everything, one thing after another, he didn’t want to be around anyone.
“And we can also shock them by smashing one,” Tracey says and, to prove her point, hurls the record into the ground. It shatters with no issue, releasing the smoke trapped inside, but then something strange happens.
Despite everything Draco has been through, this might be the most nerve wracking thing he’s ever done. They cannot move fast with injured members and constant vigilance for Death Eaters. Plus, each time they have to go through the Entrance Chamber it resets itself, spiralling and twisting in headache inducing blurs.
“And we will most certainly get to that. However, Sirius is in desperate need of a proper meal, proper clothes, and proper rest.”
The third time, however, is the time that Draco could finally bask in the moment and comfort of it all.
“Malfoy? What are y—” Potter begins, clearly still intent to pretend like everything’s fine, but the moment Draco is close enough he’s grabbing ahold of both of Potter’s wrists.
“I am not complaining!” Draco complains, glaring at the side of Potter’s head. “This is just stupid! We could have gotten dinner by now if we’d wanted.”
“Potter,” Lucius says abruptly, like he’s in a business meeting, and Draco’s ears flatten back. He doesn’t know if he’s frightened or angry anymore. His emotions are tumbling and twisting in his chest and he needs to get ahold of himself. They’re still in danger, they can’t give up yet, but they can’t make any sudden moves without being struck first.
They aren’t here now, though, and for the first time since starting at Hogwarts Draco thinks he can finally admit to missing them.
“To my knowledge, no. Much of the potion-making process has been to do with light, or lack of. My assumption is it must bask in the light of the lightning strike,” Draco looks up at the dark clouds above. He spies a few flickers of light within the clouds, plus the rumble of thunder, but no strikes.
Barty Crouch? That wasn’t possible. That couldn’t be possible. Barty Crouch was meant to be so ill he couldn’t show up. That’s why Percy Weasley had shown up in his place. Granger had said so, and Granger made it an obnoxious point to always be right.
“I…” Draco begins, voice cracking, and he stops to just breathe for a second. When he finds his voice again, he says, with his gaze distant, “Potter just kissed me…”
“Good morning,” Draco replies, nodding to him then nodding to Vincent. The smaller of the two smiles a little brighter before raising his hands and doing a few, quick motions. Draco stares at him in confusion.
Feeling the heroic sort of righteousness only a young child can truly appreciate, Draco marches into the building, ready to demand answers as to why the Muggles were not letting the wizarding folk be secret. Magic, however, is not what Draco finds within.
“My little octopus,” Mr. Davis sighs, happy to be talking about his daughter, Draco figures, and then his head tilts to one side. “She tells me you are a very kind boy who refuses to acknowledge how much you have grown, which is why you have issue accepting honest gratitude and believe your actions to be unimportant and lacking in personal worth.”
“When,” Draco pauses to swallow, his voice breaking, and he scrambles to cling to the remains of his dignity. “When have I ever said that?”
They’d all mostly just been happy to assure Sinistra wasn't kicked out of Hogwarts after the whole Edgecombe and Umbridge situation. They’d laid the groundwork and worded everything to insinuate that Sinistra had been completely blameless in everything, and it had miraculously worked. Sinistra had been left alone, even as her classroom was heavily monitored without her permission.
Draco is prepared, that morning, to take Harry with him into Hogsmeade and sneak around, attempting to have a pleasant time without getting spotted. He’s trying to think of a way to actually do that while walking through the halls, when he’s yanked to the side and shoved into a hidden alcove. The lips on his surprise him, but assure him on who exactly has decided to manhandle him today.
Sirius asks Draco about school after that, clearly attempting to get a handle on his cousin and what they could talk about. Draco, having the opportunity to actually get to know a member of his family that isn’t obsessed with pureblood ideals, eagerly reciprocates.
Draco swallows and keeps his smile in place, nodding tightly. “Yes ma’am, I most certainly was. Perhaps we could have this conversation another time, however? I really would like to get some violin practice in. Why don’t you get some sleep?”
A small, humorous smile plays at Narcissa’s lips, her eyes twinkling with an openness she dares not show to the outside world. Here with her son, however, her edges soften. “I do,” she replies lowly, “What would you like to know?”
“Ah, where to begin? My first year was Professor Quirrell, who was dreadfully incompetent. Scared of his own shadow, you see, and could hardly get anything out past his stutter.”
“Oh…” Harry says lowly, clearly uncertain what to do with this information. Draco suspects, majority of the time, Harry was having to run into messes and fix problems without any help. Adults, the people Harry was supposed to trust, hadn’t exactly been on his side these years at Hogwarts.
by Wilson Rawls in their hands, while Leandra hefts a thick, ancient-looking tome in her hands, likely studying.
“Go away Nott. Bulstrode,” Harry snaps, not in the mood to play this game, his hands balled into fists at his side. From the corner of his eye Draco spots Ron and Hermione finally slip out of the classroom and cautiously move towards the commotion. Theodore and Millicent also seem to see the pair and they sneer.
For a moment Ron and Hermione bicker about who gets to sit in the front. Hermione wins, of course, and Draco shoots the redhead an amused but reserved smile. “I could have warned you that would happen.”
The door to Umbridge’s office is in sight and… it is opening on its own. Draco slows to a halt, confused, and watches as the door slowly creaks open, pauses, then slowly creaks closed, latch carefully clicking. That was… new.
They eventually come to a halt before an even larger set of doors with tall, stone walls and multiple corridors leading elsewhere all around them. McGonagall turns back to the group to address them properly.
Before Hagrid can respond Potter and Granger are gasping, before the bespectacled boy is rushing out of the hut, his friend calling frantically after him. “What was that ‘bout?” Hagrid questions and Draco moves over to look out the window. In the distance he can see a hoard of dementors floating ominously through the air before disappearing into the forest.
The blond twists on his heels to look at her, frowning. “Are you calling me a slut?” he questions, incredulous.
Silence falls after the blonde’s comment and he looks up curiously to see what may have distracted his friend. Hermione is looking right back at him, the most baffled look on her face he’s ever seen. “What?” he asks hesitantly.
“And flying accessories, sure,” Vivian nods and she turns back to her gadget, “At first it was for money, but now I just really wanna show the Wizarding World what they’re missing with Muggle stuff. Witches and wizards are so picky, stickin’ their nose up at anything that can’t defy the laws of physics on its own.”
Vivian Wilcom is completely at ease in her spot in the grass, her dark red hair tied back in a messy bun as she tinkers with a little, metal device. Draco doesn’t know her very well, she tended to function mostly at night, and also kept to herself. She was boisterous and protective, sure, but she hardly went out of her way to make friends, seemingly comfortable in her own company, and Draco didn’t have much chance to interact with people outside his own year.
“That can all be controlled by how Skeeter writes the article. I can have her send you a copy prior to print to assure it is
Umbridge curses under her breath, looking around again at the empty space. “Miss. Parkinson!” she snaps, apparently finally calmed down enough for words, “Tell Mr. Filch to keep a particular eye on the Astronomy Tower from here on out. I want these hooligans caught! The rest of you! Search the castle. They couldn’t have gotten far.”
“Your classes are so weird though! I mean, come on, you have a veterinarian class,” Care for Magical Beasts, “for shit’s sake! Like, obviously math,” Arithmancy, “science,” Potions, “literature,” Charms, “and history,” History of Magic, “you gotta have, but why do they even OFFER botany?”
“Cover it up?” Draco questions and Potter shifts closer until they’re pressed shoulder to hip to foot.
“This one leads into the room with all the brains!” Theodore yells back at them, the new door wide open and looking into the Brain Room. He leans out a moment, before looking back at them with a decidedly less happy expression. “I hear yelling and banging.”
Draco gets a note one morning, about a week or so after the second task, from his godfather requesting he comes by his storeroom before Potions class. He can’t imagine why, but shrugs and finishes eating, not thinking much of it.
Their professor moves to lean back against her desk, looking at ease in this environment, which is slightly odd considering she looks so official and chipper while the room is surrounded by shelves of very bizarre substances. Draco is pretty sure he sees a brain or two floating in some green liquid in a far corner.
“What?!” he finally snaps, taking his eyes off his stupid textbook to glare at the radio, “What would you like me to say? He’s a bumbling buffoon that gets along better with the worms in his garden than he does with people.”
“No worries, Professor Umbridge,” Draco immediately leaps into the part of obedient pureblood. His smile is comforting at first, before he scowls and looks down the corridor. “A few Gryffindors sets off some of those cursed firecrackers as a joke. I think they were trying to get a rise out of you. But, no worries! I ran them off and docked fifty points from each.”
“Give the job to a trustworthy member from their houses,” Draco shrugs. That should have been obvious enough.
So Draco has to wait and hope that the stress would eventually begin to unravel their culprit before the final task.
Draco never got involved, though. He kept his head high, even through the ridicule, and instead enjoyed getting to finally walk the halls of Hogwarts with Harry, Hermione, and Weasley. Other friends joined them too, but the four of them, specifically, felt special.
“That isn’t what I said and you know it,” she snaps, raising her wand but Blaise is already pointing back at her.
Draco gulps, looking back at Max with wide-eyes. “Why…” Draco pauses to swallow, “Why did they do this?”
“Lovely…” Weasley grumbles but they say nothing more afterwards. The building appears to be Asian in origin, but Draco knows too little about the variety of cultures to confidently identify it beyond that. It is mostly made of wood painted a vibrant red, with rounded pillars, a thatched roof, golden accents, and a porch. It is only one floor tall, but the roof comes to a point at the top with a decorated, metal finial at the top.
Potter gives a helpless shrug, eyes on the map, and explains, “Sometimes I like to just skim over it. Tonight was just… stressful, so I thought it’d calm me down.”
“They’re jerks, but it’s worth it so far,” Draco agrees. “Did you know that our Keeper, Bletchley, uses the word malarkey constantly? Like, unironically, too.”
“Don’t tell me you have more of your ‘photos’ for me today,” he snarls, “I won’t hear any more of this foolishness!”
“I think you and Hermione may have been related in a past life,” Harry deadpans, scooting closer to get a look at the book.
“I already let the rest of the Inquisitorial Squad know to meet me at my office,” Umbridge is saying as the group approaches. Weasley and Longbottom’s eyes are wide in fright and fury, but they’ve clearly given up trying to struggle. There’s a bruise on Longbottom’s jaw, which looks painful, and Weasley is leaning like something might be wrong with his left shoulder. “Join us, won’t you? We’ve finally got some rodents to catch.”
“That’s a compliment,” Potter smirks weakly, looking up at Draco through his hair, and for a second Draco feels the air in his lungs catch and hold.
“Okay,” Sinistra says. Despite her blank voice, she is never boring. She is to the point and keeps everyone’s attention as she looks around. “Is there any spell you are interested in?”
He wonders what spells they intend to teach their peers. He wonders if it would be a wise idea to skim through his three volumes of
“I have Ptolemy,” Draco cuts in, sounding cheerful, and Ron looks over at him immediately. Draco then picks up his backpack, which he’d only brought along originally to help out Hermione on her toad hunt, and pulls out a couple of cards held together by a rubber band. He undoes the band and shows Ron his Ptolemy card. The portrait is also currently occupied by said wizard, who is looking at Ron skeptically, like he isn’t a fan of being traded.
Eve and Draco fall quiet, watching Potter with raised brows, and the Gryffindor falters, looking between them. At first he’s clearly confused, but then slowly realization dawns on his face. Realization mixed with horror. “Merlin’s beard…”
“That would be a highly inappropriate thing for a Hogwarts professor to insinuate to one of his students,” Snape had replied coolly, hardly even looking up.
“I could sleep in those jack-o-lanterns,” Tracey comments at breakfast, staring at the carved pumpkins in the corners of the Great Hall, her eyes sparkling behind her curtain of hair. Draco eyes her nervously but says nothing. He’d learned that was usually the best way to deal with the strange girl.
Draco is slowly turning more and more into Veronica Mars, too, and I really didn't mean to do that on purpose
Oh boy, I can’t wait, captain!” James exclaims with a high pitched, gleeful voice and a very wicked grin on his face. Flint falters, obviously not sure what to say, and both Lily and Harry sigh.
Potter is still bright red as he turns to Dobby, but he tries to force a smile. “I am… very grateful. Thank you, Dobby. You shouldn’t have,” he says through clenched teeth. Dobby looks like he’s been given the world, beaming at Potter.
Draco’s thoughts are cut off as Professor Quirrell comes rushing into the Great Hall, a terrified shriek of, “TROLL!!” leaving his mouth as soon as he’s inside. “Troll in the dungeons!” he continues and the whole hall has fallen silent, staring at their DADA teacher as he finally stops in the middle of the hall. “Thought you ought to know.”
“If you are about to thank me,” Draco cuts him off, throwing his head back and looking down his nose at the trio. It makes Weasley bristle. “Then don’t. I don’t want your sappy approval.”
“Thanks,” Draco mumbles, still sleepy, but feeling better than he could have expected. Blaise rolls his eyes and turns, walking away now that his job is done.
The three of them talk for a short time over the article and what it could mean, as well as attempting to plan out the next step in terms of addressing the public.
“You make it far too easy. Anyway, where was I?” Draco taps his temple for theatrical affect, before snapping his fingers and continuing. “Right. Well, clearly Eve, Leandra - who was with us - and myself now all know of your little club.”
“Oops! Guess I pushed them up and forgot!” Max says cheerfully, the panic and crying from only a moment before completely erased.
If all three of them look through the files together, which is rare, they end up in the sitting room, papers strewn everywhere. Sirius takes one end of the sofa and Potter usually is on the other end. Draco varies from pacing, the floor, or, on one occasion, the top of the loveseat.
They make it to a quiet street off the side of Kew Gardens and call the Knight Bus. Shunpike gives them a hard time for calling on them so often, but he doesn’t seem all that bothered, and the two take a seat. Potter suggests a place in Brixton that plays live music outside. He knew about it because Vernon Dursley often complained about the young bands that were clearly wasting their lives away.
The idea that Barty Crouch Jr. might actually still be alive was a farfetched one, but based off what he’d found in Barty Crouch Sr.’s files, it wasn’t an impossibility. Upon speaking to Sirius a bit longer on Barty Crouch, the older man had agreed it suspicious how sick the official had been and how many days he’d missed. He also admitting to knowing very little about the man’s son’s death. All of the following disposal of the body had been done by the dementors.
So, despite everything else they are doing in their free time, all three of them make a point of keeping an eye on the Ravenclaw.
He retells this to the four at the table, leaving out the Weasley twins’ involvement. He figured their business was theirs, and if Draco could ever use it against them, it was best to keep to himself.
“Okay. Well, unless you are going blind I do not think this reaction is entirely necessary,” Draco scoffs, ignoring the judgemental gaze the Gryffindor gives the side of his head. After a few beats without an answer, however, Draco’s expression twists into worry. “
Draco scrambles backwards, further into the shadows, his eyes wide but staring at nothing. No… that couldn’t be… Why would… HOW could…
Harry lurches forward in a panic and Draco’s paws are moving before he can think better of it. He either needs to stop Harry… or he needs to back him up.
“He… gave you permission? He knows about your camera, then?” Potter questions, sounding disbelieving.
“Is that a problem?” Harry questions, shifting back away from Draco so he can look at him, his brows pulled together. He looked worried and anxious.
“Talk to your sweet little friends like their beneath you all you like,” Draco growls, stalking around Potter like his Animagus form would. “But if you think I’m going to bend over backwards for your vitriol than you are a bigger fool than I thought.”
That one sets Potter off again, while Draco groans and waits out the rest of this conversation to end.
“Keep working on your Occlumency,” Draco continues, fingers flexing as he scratches at Harry’s back. “I know you hate it and it is far from your forte, but practicing will be your best option.”
“Later. We need to get out of here, now,” he says urgently and Sirius gives a low ‘borf’ of approval.
“You sound like someone in prison,” Eve drawls as she walks up, sitting beside Granger, and Draco smiles overly sweetly.
“Just makes me wonder how you got accepted in here, is all,” Millicent hums, sitting back in her seat and looking far too pleased with herself.
Now the sneer on Bellatrix’s face is turned away from him, her cry of frustration making him jump and whimper even if it isn’t intended for him. “Oh yes, I am aware of the degradation of our mighty house! I saw one of them, you know? A filthy little blood-traitor helping Gryffindors at the Ministry.”
When it is time for Draco to return to school, Lucius Malfoy doesn’t accompany him to the train station. It seems remarkably childish to Draco, but at least his mother is there, and she smiles down at him and straightens his robes and gives him a good-bye kiss before he goes.
Eventually Potter ends up purchasing his two friends a pair of Omnioculars each, having to fight pretty hard to make sure Weasley kept his, plus a third pair for himself and a fourth that he claimed would go to Sirius.
“Trying out new things can always have its problems,” Luna says softly, turning to watch as Tracey examines the camera, snaps a few experimental photos, then hands it to the Ravenclaw. The two of them were handsy, Draco had learned, but they were gentle and respectful. He had no fear for his camera.
“It won’t fade. Sophie taught me how to keep the color permanent,” Eve says with a pleased smirk. “But I may change it to something darker. You’ll see it if I do.”
The blonde’s mouth falls open and he throws his arm out to point at Harry. “Why aren’t you getting on to him, too?” he hisses back, just as quietly, then glares at Harry when he clears his throat. “What are you even doing up, anyway?” Draco turns back to Hermione, who puffs up with indignation.
“This isn’t some school assignment or prank or a bid to get you in trouble,” he says sharply, setting his hands on his hips. “You could have died back there, and I may be a jerk, Potter… but I’m not a
Potter has had a nightmare. It won’t be until the next day Draco will learn that Potter, sometimes, dreams of his mother’s scream, the green flash of the Killing Curse, and the high laughter of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. These are not the same as Potter’s visions and burning scar, these are just nightmares that have haunted Potter for years that he has never been able to shake.
Potter pauses just long enough to glare at Draco, who smiles sweetly back at him. “But now…” Potter looks away, thoughtful, fingers subconsciously tapping on Draco’s arm. “We hardly have any boundaries anymore. We joke around and actually enjoy each other’s company. You’ve done so much for me even though I never asked. I mean, seriously, you’re willing to break the bloody law just to give me a few days to relax… Don’t you think that’s weird?”
Narcissa Malfoy wasn’t full of hate. She may express displeasure, or frustration in some rare cases, but she was mostly a private woman who focused more on herself and her son. She wasn’t hateful, but rather indifferent.
“And I’ll figure them out if I think I need them. Are there anymore not-dark-arts in your dark arts book?”
It takes only a second of the boys silently looking at each other for them to jump into action. Harry runs forward first, wand in hand, and screams at the troll until it turns away from the girls. Ron, not far behind, moves to the other side of the corridor and yells as well, throwing off the troll’s focus. “This way!” Draco calls, waving at the girls to make their way towards him from behind the giant beast.
Draco slips out of Snape’s office with a very vacant stare on his face. It is the Thursday before Valentine’s Day, a DA meeting is scheduled this evening, and Draco really isn’t sure what his life has just become.
When she looks back up and sees Eve and Draco staring at her, she blinks. “Luna said ghosts come out when they break,” she says, as if that’s enough explanation, and they really don’t have time for this…
this, and he always got what he wanted. Why couldn’t this have been the exception to the technology-magic rule? Why couldn’t this have just worked for Draco?
sad that he couldn’t research more about it, or any other Muggle conflict, while in the Wizarding World. It was morbid and sad what he had seen, but worth knowing, too.
“If you wouldn’t mind,” Hermione eventually decides for them and moves herself and the blonde out of the way. The two boys lift up the trunk no issue and get it up into the compartment, accidentally jostling Tootsie’s cage a little but not enough to make her too upset. “Thank you…” Hermione says, voice tapering off as if like a question, and the taller boy straightens up. He was… quite tall. Was he an older student?
“Yeah. I was right there and I couldn’t here either of them,” Vivian nods, her own expression pinched in concern.
“Well, don’t start now,” Draco retorts, an uncomfortable feeling quickly spreading through his gut and his smirk drops.
Max is never upset, they actually call it sweet, and usually are fine with picking up right where they left off the next time they can speak again.
Draco raises his wand, focusing as he’d been taught, and relives a memory that wasn’t happy in the moment, but now he looks back as the greatest event of his life.
“Nah. We’ll get our lessons at the meetings. They’re both too wired up right now to encourage successful work,” the Slytherin waves the idea off.
“Eve and I plan to study in the library. Join us?” Draco says, fingers going back to playing with Potter’s hair, Potter melting into the touch and his shaking finally subsiding. “It sounds like it may do you well to spend some time away from the other lions.”
“I think I can work with that,” Sirius croaks, his voice rough, then he’s smirking rather sharply over at Snape. “That alright with you, Snivy?” he says with fake cheer and Draco’s godfather boils with anger. Without a word Snape turns and marches away, robes billowing behind him. “So dramatic,” Sirirus snickers, half to himself.
“Sure, Harry,” Granger nods, looking worried but deciding getting back to training would be a good plan. “Why don’t we review the Shielding Spell?”
“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor - what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too--”
“Ebe! T’acey!” Longbottom calls, clearly pleased to see all of them, contrasting to Harry’s adrenaline-fueled worry.
“It’s not my fault you didn’t know you only had one,” Harry shrugs, sounding very nonchalant. When his green eyes catch Draco’s there is a mischievous glow to them that surprises the pale boy.
“Neither of y’all had any issue with your brooms, right?” she questions first and both Harry and Draco shake their heads.
Draco scowls, but flies back into action. He stays on the outskirts of the struggle, avoiding Bludgers, and looks for an opportunity to fly in. The strategy had worked for him well in the past, and he had no reason to abandon it yet.
First, though, he feels out walking. It isn’t hard. The instincts are all there, the knowledge on how this body is meant to do things is hidden away in his subconscious, and he wonders if it has always been there or only developed now.
The Quidditch pitch seemed so much bigger when he actually got to walk on it himself. The stands reached high into the sky, looking like they might just snag on a cloud from this angle, and Draco’s brand-new Nimbus 2001 felt like power in his hands.
It is clear, the moment the Slytherins walk in, that the other houses aren’t too excited they’re there. They keep their distance, ostracizing the serpents to a far corner, and Smith even makes a rude comment. The walking example that not all Hufflepuffs are friendly is shut down a moment later by the Weasley twins, thankfully, which keeps the mean comments to a minimum.
“Malfoy?” Potter questions, stepping towards him like he might frightening him off. “I don’t think you’re breathing…”
“So glad you asked!” Draco grins brightly, releasing Potter’s wrist and reaching into a trench coat pocket. He removes a brand-new disposable camera, except this one is far from normal. “The Weasley twins and I have modified this particular camera so that, every time it takes a picture, a copy of that picture is magically sent to Dumbledore via a magically enhanced fax machine.”
“You didn’t even let me get to ‘como te llamas,’ or ‘de donde eres,’ or…” Max goes on for a while, listing off more and more Spanish phrases, and Draco listens with half an ear.
Things did get a little out of hand one afternoon, however, with the twins and Montague. Draco doesn’t know what led up to the altercation, he hardly even knew where it happened, but one moment he’d been alone in a hall and the next Tracey was dragging a near comatose Montague towards him.
” she says and her fingers flip rapidly through a few symbols before she makes a jagged motion with her hand. From the sky a bolt of lightning suddenly erupts from a seemingly harmless cloud and strikes at a tree in the far distance.
They’re silent again, their breathing finally evening out and the very unnerving noises of the Forbidden Forest invading their senses. Except Potter doesn’t look that bothered by it. Instead he’s eying Draco like he’s some kind of puzzle he can’t piece together. It unnerves Draco more than the forest.
“Jealous, Potter? Would you like some Malfoy brand ‘sweeping you off your feet,’ or a Weasley styled serenade?” Draco hums, smirking, and Potter glares at him.
“Will Ron and Hermione be joining us at any point?” Potter asks out of the blue as he and Draco stand side by side, looking through a stack of records labelled “Rock & Roll” while Eve, nearly on the entire other side of the shop, looks through CDs.
Potter smells like cheap cologne, which he probably got for the dance, sweat, and a back drop of chocolate. Probably all the chocolate he’s stolen from Draco, actually…
“Sorry, Potty, Slytherins only,” Draco calls back as he and Eve turn to begin heading down the corridor on their right. Eve turns and waves patronizingly over her shoulder, Leandra the only one to take it seriously and wave back with a bright smile.
“Forget about it, Malfoy. It doesn’t matter,” Potter growls lowly. Despite not looking at Draco, the blonde still sees Potter’s eyes flicking around, like he’s looking for an escape.
Potter swallows, takes one, two, three deep breathes, then finally looks up at Draco with the most mournful eyes he’d ever seen. “Since Yule Ball.”
Shaking her head in unhappy disbelief Mrs Nubble focuses once more on Draco and she slowly stretches out her hand and the letter in it. “This is yours, Draco. Read over it and think carefully about what you want to do.”
“Why is it ridiculous? Why can’t it be supernatural?” It was true. They had talked about such a thing before, near the beginning, and had both decided it seemed too flimsy an excuse. Like a cop out. But after Draco’s conversation with Ada the night before the idea was bouncing around in his head again, demanding attention.
Draco takes a deep breath in, holds it, then lets it out in a long gust. “It’s okay…” he says slowly, “No one’s perfect.” That earns him a raised eyebrow and a very slight smirk thrown his way.
“I… suppose I have little choice,” Draco says very slowly, sounding more like a question than a statement, and then Patil is nabbing the camera from his grip. He’s too startled to be suspicious, he’s just trying to understand.
“Right… speaking of Max…” the Gryffindor says slowly and, with a grunt, he sits up and crosses his legs. “That’s what I was getting at earlier.”
Draco could probably fill a novel with all the grandiose stories he’d heard of the Malfoy family, but when it came to the Black side of his family, he was realizing his knowledge greatly lacked.
“Your Prince Charming,” he smiles weakly, tears rolling down his cheeks as he holds the shaking boy as tight as he possibly can.
In the end, when they get to the theater, two movies catch their eye. Draco thinks “Clueless” looks interesting, but Eve says “Apollo 13” was doing really well. Potter gets to be the deciding vote and they end up buying three tickets to “Apollo 13.”
“Are you sure? We’re waiting for some friends of ours, the Weasley family, if you wanted to stick with us for a bit,” Harry asks, fiddling with his hands nervously.
That startles a giggle out of the boy and he nods, like he’s come to some realization, before grinning brightly at Draco. Was this boy the embodiment of the sun, or something? “Sorry, sorry. So, there’s four houses at Hogwarts, right? And you get sorted into one at the beginning of your first year.”
“What was that thing?” Potter looks up through his messy hair at Draco, green-eyes still wide and panicky.
Something big and important. Someone who he hardly had any boundaries with anymore, who he wanted to travel the world with, who listened and understood, who Draco could do the same for. Something Draco didn’t think he could do without ever again.
“Never took you for the snooping type, Pansy, thought-- wait, no. That’s exactly what I took you for,” Draco drawls back, burying the mounting panic behind a wall of sarcasm. Pansy, unfortunately, doesn’t appear fazed.
It feels like a complete mess and Draco thinks he’d develop claustrophobia if he had to be in an office like this for too long.
Draco had watched in wonder as the Gryffindor had dug around in Draco’s things, as if he had every right, before disappearing into the bathroom, then re-emerging wearing some of Draco’s clothes.
“Oh, now don’t be ridiculous. We’ve already been over this,” she huffs haughtily before looking back at her book, trying to say that she was quite done with this line of conversation, but Draco wasn’t, and he was never a fan of being ignored.
The meal prepared for them is traditionally Japanese, Ms. Hushburn explains. She wanted them to experience a little culture while they were over at her home and had prepared rice, miso soup, grilled fish, salad, and a bunch of sides Draco isn’t even going to attempt to pronounce. It is the weirdest, yet most filling, breakfast he’s ever had, despite the Hushburn women getting a clear kick out of watching himself and Harry attempt to maneuver chopsticks. Eventually Eve fetches them silverware, but only when Harry has resorted to stabbing his fish with the sticks.
“No one will ever believe you,” Draco grunts, but can’t help shifting towards the other, Harry’s hands staying in his hair to scratch at his scalp in pleasing, gentle motions. “It’s good to hear you doing better,” he adds softly, finally stopping to stand between Harry’s knees, hands on the counter beside his hips.
“Wow,” Draco breathes, eyes shining. This was absolutely amazing. First the ostrich-chair and now teleportation. What all would HE be able to do, he wondered.
“Pureblood society has its own hierarchy within itself,” Leandra offers helpfully. “Sacred Twenty-Eight are the highest, then purebloods outside of the Sacred Twenty-Eight yet still European. Then pureblood families that have intermingled with Muggles or muggleborns. Then pureblood families outside of Europe. And, finally, blood-traitors.”
“They’ll be up and causing problems by tomorrow morning,” Madam Pomfrey grumbles as she bustles back over to Draco’s bed. She’s carrying a glass of water with a straw and only then does Draco realize how parched he is.
There’s a forced lightness in Max’s tone and Draco quickly snaps, “Shut up, peasant,” before turning off the radio to Max’s giggles.
But, Merlin, Harry looked like he was drowning in the stuff and it made Draco’s brain go funny. He must have been making a face, too, because Harry looked far too smug as he returned and plopped back down into Draco’s bed. It didn’t help that the blond couldn’t find the right way to move and was just frozen there, like an idiot.
“Did you get your wand from here?” he asks quietly, not wanting to interrupt whatever memory she may have been visiting, but too curious to stay quiet.
It is because of this terminal illness that Mr. and Mrs. Crouch get a visit with their son in Azkaban, in private, with no one else to see.
