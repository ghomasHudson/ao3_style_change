Harry was sick with himself. He had compromised so much already to have Draco: his marriage, his belief in fidelity, his relationships with the people he held dearest. Now he had used his magic against a boy whose only crimes were foolishness and greed.
Draco grabbed his waistcoat and jacket in one swift motion from where they lay discarded on a chair. "What right? None - it is clear that I am far, far down your list of priorities and so I leave you to deal with the things that
“I didn’t see the note,” said Draco weakly.
"I do not know," he forced himself to say as he began to sob. Sirius' arms came around him, and he clung to his godfather, wishing himself far away, into the life of a man who had never been subject to desire or the monstrous whims of his own heart.
Harry sighed, looking at his hands. "I must talk to Sirius. There are numerous arrangements which must be made."
As the Chair brought an end to the debate, Harry looked up to find Lord Malfoy's gaze locked upon him. Harry returned the appraisal for a long moment then turned deliberately away.
"Yes, Father," Draco said again, and Harry couldn't watch further. He ducked back fully behind the tree, leaning on it as he gasped out his sympathy for Malfoy, a sympathy he would never have anticipated feeling.
Harry exhaled. "Do you know I have been so troubled of late that I have barely given the matter any thought for weeks?"
For a long moment the two of them stood in silence, staring at one another with their eyes wide. Harry swallowed hard and had to look away, bile rising in his throat. He was behaving – well, like Draco. And it was every bit as sickening as it was liberating. Harry wiped his mouth as though he could shove the words back down inside him, have them become unspoken.
"You have hurt—"
Harry nodded slowly. "Remus asked you what was wrong?"
he reminded himself, wondering why it now felt so hollow.
Harry said nothing.
Lady Malfoy smiled like a shark. "Do excuse me, Mr Potter."
Draco pushed at Harry's shoulders, manoeuvring him against the billiard table. Harry wondered if he was about to be pressed down into it and a leap of renewed fear made him tense, but Draco soothed him with a kiss to the throat before meeting his eyes with the promise of pleasure and dropping to his knees.
Harry let his hands drift up to sit on Draco's wrists as Draco touched him. Then at once he had both those wrists pinned down on the bed above Draco's head for the sheer pleasure of denying them both what they wanted.
“And we’d never see our families or friends again. I have already missed most of Lily’s life, Ginny was right about that.”
"Yes, mother," said Draco tightly. "But he had already decided on a path for the future and did not require my help."
There was only one other door, with six different shapes carved out of the centre. Draco eyed the plum, and inserted it into the corresponding slot. The door opened at once, sliding back to reveal a room in the Moroccan style, covered in low sofas and ornate rugs.
“But I do. That’s not fair.”
Harry swallowed hard. Somehow he knew exactly what Draco was about to ask, why he was suddenly 'Potter' again. His heart sank. "You want me to get you a renter?"
~o0O0o~
“Oh, yes. I had a visit from Kirke last night. Not that I can blame him after the way I acted.”
Ginny thought for a moment. "Perhaps Lily Luna? We could ask Luna to stand godmother."
"I don't know what you want," Draco said. "You… I don't know what you want."
Harry froze.
“Delightful. Tell me, have either of you seen a Sneakoscope before?”
Ginny spared the Malfoys another glance. "It would be no small thing to stand up to that man," Ginny said.
"Squander it in gaming hells?"
None of this was enough to distract Harry from the letter. It was not in the hand he had feared to see but in another style he did not quite recognise.
Harry didn't quite know how to respond to that. "Mm," was all he could offer, non-committal as possible, taking another long pull on his cigarette in lieu of speaking.
“It’s a lesser charge,” Hermione explained. “So it’s both easier to prove, which they like, and comes with a more lenient sentencing.”
It was at times like this that Harry most missed being able to go to his friends for counsel. Hermione was the only one who suspected anything about his having an extramarital relationship and she was hardly prepared to advise him. It would be the height of cruelty to ask Ginny or Ron. Sirius… Well, he suspected that Sirius had more experience in that area than he had ever let on, but that didn't mean that Sirius was a viable option either.
"Harry," said Sirius hesitantly, "do you not remember Lord Draco's father? He was in the Inner Circle."
Sirius had never been awkward in Harry's presence before.
Draco's expression was gentler than he had expected. Harry kissed him then, unable to stop himself.
Rather than reply to anything Draco had said, Harry instead tried, “Does he have any undeclared Dark artefacts in the manor?”
He had thought he would just look, collect anything of value and hide anything which marked the prior residents as wizards before he gave up the room. Instead he found himself overwhelmed by the memories. Draco and I made love
"Three strong children! I should say so," Ginny said. She lay her head on the arm of the chaise-longue and Harry was abruptly reminded of another day, another chaise-longue and the length and beauty of Malfoy's throat. He forced it aside as she continued, "Visitors will help, you will see."
"Harry," Sirius said, clasping his shoulder, "you know you are always welcome here, so please do not begin another litany of apologies. I'm relieved you have seen fit to come at last." His tone was all reproach and Harry hung his head. "Remus is quite capable of looking after himself while we talk – unless you feel he could assist you in… whatever the matter is?"
Harry tried to imagine himself, all in white, in a room with Lord and Lady Malfoy and their ilk, all the purebloods raising their eyebrows at his half-blood self. So many people with such vile beliefs, all in a room to reassure one another that the world hadn't changed at all. A networking opportunity that some would give their teeth for, to be certain, but a prospect that filled Harry with dread.
Squaring his shoulders, Harry walked past the door and through into the room at the back, telling himself over and over again that Teddy must surely want nothing more than to talk.
"No," said Draco, not adding,
At ten minutes before nine o'clock, Harry adjusted the gas lamps to a lower level, to set a pleasing glow to the room. He smiled to himself and sat on the living area's couch, his robe discarded to reveal his shirt and waistcoat.
"Pleasure," Harry repeated, sinking deeper into Draco's embrace. "You know, it has been an extremely long time since I felt any such."
"When one is tired of London one is tired of life," an unfamiliar drawl interjected. "Or so Samuel Johnson said, and who would argue with so prolific a man, despite his being a Muggle?"
On the other side of the room, Kirke had stepped forward to help strip Draco of his clothes. The other two lounged artfully on the bed, awaiting their summons.
Harry was inclined to give Lucius the cut direct, but he was after all here with the man’s son. He wanted to afford those subtly watching no further cause for speculation or gossip. He swallowed his rudeness. “I meant to say, it was not announced this morning.”
~o0O0o~
“I did say to come by any time today, but the day’s almost over,” said Potter.
The man gave no answer but merely stepped from the shadows into the lamplight. A familiar flash of light hair gave way to a face which bore no further resemblance to Draco. Harry frowned at him for a moment. “Kirke, is it not? I would not expect to find you here.”
The lump moved and Draco’s messy hair poked up from beneath the sheets. “I see. I had no idea you cared so much for Percy Weasley, of all people.”
“Then you should have brought your own,” Sirius replied. At least there was a hint of humour there now. Harry gave a small, half-smile.
It was so far from what he had expected her to say that Harry almost started. "What a marvellous idea!" he said. Ginny listened to the matches on the wizarding wireless but they had not been to a game together in years. Perhaps this was a sign that she felt better able to ask him for what she needed now. Perhaps they could both be themselves. "I will see if there will be space in the box tonight."
It took a while, several fingers and a great deal of oil before Harry was relaxed enough to allow Draco to slip inside him. When at last Harry was open enough, Draco rolled on top of him, pressing their faces together, kissing him as he pressed inside. Harry hissed at the pressure and the sting of it. He wriggled, uncomfortable, but never asked Draco to stop. This was the closest he had ever felt to another person – completely different to any other experience of his life. The pain and pleasure bound together and Harry moaned even as Draco bottomed out and gave an animalistic cry of his own.
Harry felt his eyes narrow. "Suddenly my company is unwelcome?"
“I’m here to see the Head Auror,” Draco said at the desk.
“He told me he would. All the Weasleys, if I didn’t let Draco go.”
Harry had never had thoughts about a man before Malfoy. Malfoy had changed him somehow.
“Despite her lack of experience,” Malfoy added smoothly. The crowd hissed again.
"I won't," Draco whispered back, his fingers clutching tightly at Harry's elbows, shoulders, back. "I won't, I promise, I promise, I won't. Stay with me."
Harry's patience gave way. "This is intolerable! Draco, what right..."
On his return to the hotel, he lingered in the outer room and forced himself to think through everything that had happened in the last month: he had been blackmailed, Draco had been first violent, then withdrawn and now all but silent, Lucius had threatened him and carried out the threats… It was too much.
There had of course been no letter. "Oh, before school ended. Perhaps the owl got confused and it was misdirected somehow. It was nothing of particular consequence."
“Much obliged, sir. Thirty Galleons should cover it.”
Harry wondered how he must look to her, flushed and wild-eyed, and walked in without a word as he tried to compose himself.
His hair, usually sandy brown, turned gold. The muscles in his back and shoulders, slender and well-defined, moved beneath his golden skin. Then he turned to face Harry, droplets of water clinging to his chest and collarbones.
"Good day, Lord Draco," Harry managed. Lord Draco's voice had curled its way down his spine like an intimate caress even as the sight of him hit Harry in precisely the same way as it had that first time. He was wearing gold today, Harry noticed. Pale gold silks which somehow brought a certain richness to his pale colouring. Harry's eyes moved over him rapidly, taking in golden hair, golden cloth, sharp cheekbones. Harry was reacting like a man lost in the desert for forty days to whom Lord Draco was cool, clear water and he felt his jaw tense. What was the
He went to the breakfast room to eat and moved into the hotel foyer thereafter with the intention of taking another walk.
"Would you have reason to write to Draco Malfoy at all?"
Sirius shook his head. "Lord Malfoy is corrupt, cunning, ruthless and smart. His son is but a wastrel. He runs up gaming debts and abuses everyone around him. He is not a person I would wish to see developing influence over you." There was a definite edge to Sirius' voice.
“I do know,” Charlie said slowly.
lover of yours?"
No, though it had been threatened several times. "I do not see how Lord Malfoy could disinherit his only son."
“I can’t go through this again, Hermione,” Harry said. “I can’t. Will you tell Ginny how sorry I am? And that I won’t contest the divorce if she decides she wants one.”
"What the devil were you even hunting in May?" Harry wondered once Sirius had related his companion's numerous annoying habits.
“Order, please,” Diggory said, his tone resigned. “Mrs Weasley, you are here to act as advocate for the accused?”
Kirke fell silent. Harry clenched his fist around the letter and the strange wand. That Kirke had one at all, Harry had not known for certain until now. He sighed as the adrenaline left him.
“Mrs Weasley, do not force me to silence you as well. Mr Potter, this has been a hard case for us given your standing in the community, your past services to wizardkind and your connection with several prominent families. However, it seems beyond contestation that you have made explicit solicitations to at least one young man. And while many were prepared to accept the truth of your… feelings,” he managed, the word barely making its way past the man’s throat, “we also believed that you had attended bawdy houses. Someone who could do that must be dead to all sense of shame.”
"I always knew," Draco said carelessly. "I always knew what I wanted."
"Do you feel different?" she would ask after every attempt and Harry would search his feelings and be forced to conclude that no, he did not.
Days passed. Harry received another letter, delivered by the same owl. It, too, he threw in the fire. He was half-afraid that Malfoy would do something overdramatic and ridiculous like send him a howler, but nothing else came.
Harry stared at the memory, thinking of what Blaise had shown him. What could the memory be? Had Lucius seen something damning? Would he really involve his son, if the whole point of this trial had been to “save” him from Harry.
“Lovely to see you, Draco,” Harry said, and he gently caressed Draco’s wrist with his fingertips to make up for his standoffish tone.
“Kirke, I really wish you hadn’t done this,” he said quietly. “You are quite right that it was ungallant of me to use a Knockback Jinx in such a circumstance and I will happily give you the cost of the potion ingredients. Which I reckon to be less than two Galleons; I shall offer you five, by way of compensation, and I apologise sincerely for my lack of gallantry.” He crossed to Kirke in a few steps and tucked his wand and the coins from his bag securely into a pocket in the coat; Kirke stared at him in fear, all but frozen even though Harry had not used a full-body bind. “I am sorry not to have thought of the damage done to you before, and I would happily have offered you compensation. There was no need for this.”
~o0o~
Harry might have felt worse about Ginny's disappointment had he not been anxious to return to town and to Draco.
with you?”
"Watch for a while then," Malfoy told him blithely. Bertram threw a look over his shoulder before he fell to his knees in front of Malfoy, sliding his hands up those thighs to pull down Malfoy's trousers. His erect cock emerged and Harry swallowed hard at the sight. Malfoy chuckled and Harry squirmed again at realising that Malfoy had been watching his reaction.
"Don't say that," Draco breathed. He crouched down in front of where Harry sat, there in the corner but beyond the veil, separated from him forever.
Harry swallowed hard. "I see."
"Good morning," he replied, the moment's warmth fading fast as he remembered his purpose in coming. "I have everything you need."
Harry looked at his hands, folded in his lap.  Sirius had been through so much, all for the sake of a love much like Harry's.
Draco crossed the room, all confidence in his robes, and placed a kiss on Ginny’s cheek as though they were old and dear friends.
“Boys,” he replied. “Oh, my boys.” He knelt to embrace them properly, looking at his features and Ginny’s reflected in their faces and wondering who they were becoming.
“Right! I mean – what?”
“Ron,” Harry said again, nonsensically. Here he was, his best friend, solid as rock since they were eleven years old. “Ron, Listen. I need to tell you—"
Harry did not dare make any reply.
"You came," he breathed, and felt the sharp sting of tears behind his eyes as he looked into the face he had feared he would never see again.
“Our King.”
“Well?” Sirius was growing impatient. “Do you have nothing else to say for yourself?”
At last, the conversation flagged. Harry braced himself.
Harry closed his fist around the card at once. “Quite well, thank you.”
A long pause followed.
“Wait, Charlie?” Harry’s head came up. “Charlie’s really hot.”
“I am sure.” Ginny’s frown remained until Harry pressed her for more details of the children’s lives and she allowed herself to be diverted. Perhaps she did not wish to know any more than he wished to tell her.
Draco was panting, too, slippery with sweat cooling on his skin. "Damn you, Potter, that hurt."
"Quite right, Teddy," Harry said, though he was thinking about something else. "I'm sure many would tell you it would be a connection worth fostering, but if you do not care for his company then why seek it?"
"This is hardly conventional," Harry said. "You and I."
"You came," he breathed, and felt the sharp sting of tears behind his eyes as he looked into the face he had feared he would never see again.
Do it again right here and now, apparently. “Right, then,” said Draco, sitting back on Potter’s desk with his legs slightly open in invitation. “I’m not about to object.”
"It's a great profession," Harry said, his mind focused entirely on something else. "I meant to ask, did you not have a chance to respond to my letter?"
Harry had no answer for that. Instead he reached out and clasped his fingers around the back of Teddy's neck.
Draco said nothing in his own defence. Instead he said simply, "Will you?"
It was the first time Harry could ever remember being unmoved by Draco making such an offer. “I have to go to the Wizengamot.”
The simple declaration moved Harry more than he might have expected: it was nothing he did not know after all. He nodded, half to himself. "Yes, there have been other things that have affected my enjoyment of my time in town. We will have the presentation and then Ginny and the children and I will return to Godric's Hollow and we will stay away from London for a long while." It was the best course of action Harry had been able to come up with.
Blaise gave a sound somewhere between a sigh and a snort. He forced his body to relax, easing his wand down; Harry’s eyes tracked the effort it cost him. “All right. Honesty, then,” Blaise said as though the word offended him. “That is a real memory but it is from some time ago.”
“I am not the beloved hero,” Draco always replied. “No one worships me. Instead, I have the Slytherins.”
"Of course," said Ginny. "As could you. But I imagine he'd find a way to punish us for it." She looked at the monochromatic pair another moment before she shook her head. "And you are fighting the legislation he wishes to pass?"
Sirius drained his cup in a rush and deposited it back on the table. "I understand what you are trying to do," he said and Harry dragged his mind back to the topic at hand. "And yes, perhaps we must re-educate the population in order to ensure that the future does not merely repeat the past, but I fear that it must begin with children. Young though you still are, I would be surprised if you could change Zabini's mind."
"Aye," Aberforth said. "But if you're wise you'll not go back there."
"Two sons," Harry replied.
Harry let himself close his eyes and imagine it for a moment: a villa by the water. His children nearby. “I wonder how long it would take me to learn Italian.”
“We need brandy for this,” Sirius said at length, and called for Dobby.
Lucius’s smile only widened. “Quite. I would find it useful to discuss your position at another time.”
” just as Draco shouted a spell Harry didn’t know: “
"Of course," Remus said at once. "You are expecting an addition very shortly, are you not?"
Harry paused. He had not considered meeting so publicly with Draco – but what harm could it do? They were known acquaintances, Harry supposed.
“And if not this then what could the blackmail attempt have been about, madam?” Lucius demanded. “Should we not know for certain, if only to clear the accused once and for all?”
Please if you get a chance go back and read chapter 3 as intended and accept many mea culpas on the confusion. I hope it won't spoil your enjoyment of the story.
"I suppose there was Pansy Parkinson," Draco admitted. "She was more a co-conspirator than a beloved, though. Things didn't quite work, somehow. She left for France under something of a cloud, scandalous wench." His tone was distinctly fond.
There are any number of methods for bringing a person back to life. Magic makes so many things possible. Draco had encountered Inferi and charmed skeletons and zombies and ghosts and philosopher's stones and unicorn blood but there's nothing he knew that could put Harry back the way he was.
Harry laughed. "Ah, well. In truth I should be paying more attention to politics, the Wizengamot and what not."
"I like the peace," Harry confessed. "While I have been blessed with many good friends I do always feel the pressure to perform."
"That's up to you." Draco kissed Harry's wrist. He could feel the strength in Harry's muscles.
Draco had made Harry his God; at last, Harry answered his prayers.
"Draco…" Harry began, reaching out to catch his shoulder.
“Nngh,” he said, never at his most articulate first thing in the morning. He was naked, sore, and sticky in a fairly pleasant sort of way, which meant that somehow he’d managed to pull even in his blackout drunk stupor. Draco congratulated himself even as he crawled towards the fireplace.
"And Lord Potter," she said, offering him her hand to shake. "I recall we became acquainted in Scotland. What a pleasure to see you again."
The foyer was not, however, unoccupied. Harry was up considerably earlier than usual that morning and had managed to time his departure with that of a tall, slender blonde woman giving orders to a house-elf.
“That may have been how it started. It does not surprise me, knowing him as I do. But it became far more than that. And I think you know it.”
Harry swallowed convulsively as Draco slid his dragonhide boots off his feet. He stood there then in his trousers and open shirt, his feet, wrists and throat bared.
Teddy frowned faintly. "Why not rush when you know what you want?"
"What?"  Harry flew to his feet at once.  "But how- why-"
He sat at a corner table, raising a hand in greeting to Aberforth Dumbledore who grunted.
Lord Malfoy and Draco were walking up from the next Apparition point; Draco was in front, evidently trying to outrun the lecture he was receiving. Crabbe was behind them, but Lady Malfoy was nowhere in sight and Harry wondered why she had not chosen to attend.
Harry smothered a laugh as the announcer cried, "Lord Sirius Black and Harry Potter Esquire!"
Draco licked his lips. His fingers uncurled and stroked the side of Harry's face. "We have the full night. I believe that was what you wanted."
Harry wondered if she knew that he was really saying,
Harry winced, his selfishness coming back into focus; Ginny saw it at once and reached for his hand.  "I'm sorry," she said gently and for a moment she was herself again, the woman he loved. "I know this sort of thing isn't easy for you, and I truly wish I could be there to support you. You'll have to settle for my idiot brother," she said, giving his fingers a weak squeeze.
It was one of the worst evenings he could remember.
Harry looked at Malfoy and would not look away, willing Malfoy to look back at him. Malfoy fidgeted under his gaze before finally throwing down his cards. "Very well," he said, standing abruptly and stalking away.
Harry thought of the terrible night before, the violence and the passion, the turmoil and the thrill. How far he’d come – or perhaps sunk. But here was where he stood and this was where he would draw the line. Besides, “Would you even want me if I were?”
"Potter, what-?" Draco said in outrage. But Harry wasn't stopping, he was merely stripping Draco's lower half more completely. When at last he was naked for Harry's eyes, it took everything he had not to climb up onto the table with him.
"I saw your father in the Wizengamot today," Harry remarked to Draco later that evening, back in their suite.
"And there's still his friend, Lupin," said Lucius, his eyes boring into Harry's. A sense of terrible trepidation shot through him; something in Lucius' face warned of danger.
Harry pulled away. "Draco," he said on a huffed laugh, a pleading sound. "Shall we not dine?"
"Don't," Harry cried. Harry didn't think of the body as his, didn't think of things the way Draco did.
Remus nodded. "It still shames me. When she told me first that she was with child – it filled me not with joy but with fear." He looked at Harry. "You know of my condition. I could not be certain how any child of mine would be affected, and while you know that Teddy is as untouched by lycanthropy as I could possibly have hoped, at the time things seemed very bleak."
Draco shot him a grateful look then even as his father rolled his eyes.
“Because he told me he would if I didn’t call it off with you.”
" His tone mocked the very idea. He laughed. "People will believe anything. When first I understood what I was hungering for, I read about it. In England today there are such bizarre stories in print – they say that a sodomite's penis will change shape and become like that of a dog! They say that a mouth which sucks cock will change shape and distort to become like that of a Dementor!" Draco laughed. "I knew it could not be so. I never saw it on the faces of the lords and ladies, nor the whores or the renters. I knew not everyone could be as virtuous as we all like to pretend."
“Overruled, Mrs Weasley. Let’s see this memory and get it over with.”
Draco was still spiky and sulking and it only got worse as Harry accepted invitations from Luna Scamander and Seamus Finnegan and all the acquaintances he had been disregarding in his single-minded pursuit of Draco.
"No, indeed," Ginny said, smiling. "But she asked for salted fish and olives. That was what she ate when she was expecting Rose."
Of course, there would have to be a catch.
"I know it is against all reason," Harry went on, "but I could never give him up."  He tightened his arms around himself and waited, breathless, for what Sirius would say to that.
All that remained was to face the consequences.
“Relevant? Perhaps it isn’t, to you. Perhaps I needed to remind myself. I let myself become so constrained by everything you expected of me – all of you,” and he could not but help a glance to Hermione at this, “that I forgot what I owed to myself. I was fourteen when Professor Dumbledore told me ‘there will be a time when we must choose between what is easy and what is right’ and I let myself become confused about what was right. And it is simply this: I will stand here and tell you the truth. I fell in love with a man.”
“Which Weasley?”
,” Draco spat and Harry felt his heart break. “I’m going home to the Manor until you pull your head out of cock alley.” Then he spun on the spot and was gone with a
Tonight, though, Ginny turned her face up, meeting his mouth with hers. For a moment their lips pressed together, her mouth soft. Harry touched her face lightly and kissed her again before stepping back. "Goodnight," he said quietly. "I will leave for London after breakfast tomorrow."
And I will never see him again, Harry remembered in a rush and the force of it almost knocked him from his chair.
"Ginny wanted to take the waters."
seemed like a good place to begin.
Draco shrugged. "What is there to do? I read - I have been lax lately, I confess. In Quidditch season, I attend the games. But other than entertaining my friends, my life is quite idle."
“I’m sorry,” he managed. “Hermione, I’m so, so sorry.”
Harry swallowed. "Did you really think we could stay?"
Harry felt his shoulders slump. “I need some air,” he said.
"But what about you?"  Harry asked.
"Looks like there might be something of the invert to you after all," Malfoy said, and he was smirking and his cock, now flaccid, was still exposed, and Bertram was smothering a laugh and Kirke was kneeling at Harry's feet with come still on his mouth and Harry thought the shame of it all would burn him alive.
Malfoy arched an elegant eyebrow, his mouth forming that now-familiar smirk. "Do you know," he asked, "what you are getting into?" Without waiting for a response he rapped on the ceiling of the carriage and with a crack of Goyle's whip the carriage pulled away.
“Oh so he cursed you? How?”
Kirke looked up then and Harry noticed there were tears in his eyes. “I used to think you really were a hero,” he said. Harry stiffened. “But then you came and you…” He sniffled, wiped his face. “You’re just as corrupt as the rest of them.”
“It’s Charlie,” he said with a sigh.
"Harry's single and you want to move in on him," Terry said in an accusing whisper. "Well, let me tell you, you don't have a chance with him. Our love is real and once he realises it, there'll be a cottage in Devon, two black Labradors and a rose garden!"
"Mr Zambini," Harry responded.
Harry had not known where to look. "Draco, you know I desire you, you know I find nothing but pleasure in your arms..."
“I do. It reminds me a little of the Slytherin common room, which also had a glass ceiling. How was
Draco met his gaze, and gave an insouciant shrug. "I was delayed at the gaming tables. It was a winning streak, after all, and the allowance Father permits me would never enable the purchase of a robe such as this. Feel," he said, reaching for Harry's hands, "the lapels are velvet."
And then, because he knew that to be false,
Silence again. He looked around the room; there was no one whose full attention he did not command.
He had not been sleeping well even before Kirke and Lucius and Ginny had all struck him in quick succession. Now he was barely sleeping at all. Instead he made increasingly violent, frantic love to Draco who took everything he had to give with desperation in the lines of his body. They both knew time was running out.

Sirius offered him a nightcap and the two moved to his study. Harry knew Sirius had something on his mind; as usual it did not take his godfather long to voice it.
is not particularly opaque in meaning, Potter," Draco returned.
Harry sighed. “I did not anticipate her coming here. Perhaps I should have.”
"Are you still afraid?" Draco demanded, a hint of anger entering his tone. "I told you, you're mine, I marked you. Do you want me to be yours? Fuck me."
she’d help.
He smelled of cigar smoke, as though he had spent most of the evening in a gentleman's club. Harry swallowed. "Why are you so late?"
Carefully timing his arrival to be a few minutes late, Harry was confronted with a room filled with cigar smoke and the scent of brandy wine. Four tables were laid out for various card games, and he did not recognise most of those present.
“I can do that,” Ron said, smiling. He winked at Harry and let Padfoot off his lead.
Draco shifted. "I had a charm. So that I would know when you came back. If you came. I was by no means certain that you would." Draco looked as uncertain as Harry had ever seen him. His robes were winter white and his waistcoat embroidered with snowflakes and he had blue bruise-circles beneath his eyes. He was slightly thinner in the face, too. It had only been a fortnight but Draco weighed barely enough even at the best of times.
It was nice. They used to do this all through the League season, he remembered. Ginny had wanted to play for the Harpies even though her mother told her it was unladylike. Ginny had never worried overmuch about that kind of thing and Harry had encouraged her to try out, had shared her disappointment when she was not selected. The team had invited her to return the following year but by then she and Harry were married and Harry had wanted to start a family.
Draco trembled a little but managed not to grab Potter right that second. It felt like an impossible victory won.
“Sorry, Potter,” Fawley said, seeming to mean it.
As he put the book down, Draco burst into the room. He was all but snarling.
~o0O0o~
"Do not put yourself in a position where you are between Lord Malfoy and his son."
Kirke’s wand,” then for good measure, “
He did, however, remember her Bat-Bogey Hex from school and reflected that a foul temper was evidently a quality he looked for in a lover.
Harry bowed at once as Lady Malfoy called out, "Kore, do show some decorum dear." 'Kore' was a magnificent dark-skinned woman most likely ages with Lady Malfoy, but her hair and skin were those of a woman barely thirty. Her dress was fabulously
Harry was smoking a cigarette, head in his hands, when Sirius arrived home.
She made a face. “I was rather hoping to wait until Neville…”
Finally he retired for the evening, still alone.
"Do you find all this as tedious as I?"
"You are lucky to have such a love," Harry could not resist saying.
He wasn't ready yet for this to be the end.
"Nor I," Harry said with a laugh. "Though in turn I am rather surprised that Hermione is not more involved."
The frustration grew in Harry until he feared he would be able to bear it no longer. Some of his friends – Seamus Finnegan for example, an excellent friend but a man with an essentially pragmatic nature – would routinely make use of professional services during periods such as these, when their wives were unavailable, but Harry had never done so. He had been caught up in anticipating the child's birth. Never before had he felt himself so lost to reason. Caught on a knife's edge between lust and horror, one morning he finally gave in to onanism as the least of the available evils and brought his hand to his cock.
“There is nothing wrong with—” Harry began hotly.
The park at least was peaceful and green, and Harry remained there hours, until the lamplighters arrived to illuminate the falling darkness.
Harry ran his hand over the back of his neck. "I have made no arrangements but I hope to stay here for some time. I had hoped…"
“I see.” Draco thought for a moment. “So no details at all?”
Draco blinked, as if surprised by the question. “I feel quite well,” he said, surprised. “Indeed, I feel lighter, if anything.”
Draco had built something beautiful for Harry now, selected the perfect arms, the loveliest cock, the most luscious lips. It was strange, remembering the imperfections of Harry's body and wondering if he should seek to replicate or correct them. He could have anything he wanted in his lover now – a more muscular frame, a larger cock, stronger hands. It was not a dilemma he'd ever thought to face.
“Between that and your father, yesterday was really rather dreadful,” Harry said quietly.
"Thank you," he whispered.
he wrote,
real, or surely you would know that."
Blaise’s lip curled. “All right. I wondered if you would believe this was from today.”
Harry had rather hoped to stand, bow, and have that be the end of the encounter but Lord Malfoy had other plans it seemed. "Yes, indeed," Harry said, quite at a loss as how best to handle this. "And yourself as well, I presume?"
The last thing he wanted was to cause any friction between them.
“I see. And was this letter addressed to you?”
"Draco, we have had this conversation before," Harry said, a warning creeping into his tone. "I am still a man with a family. But it will be perhaps a fortnight at most..."
"It feels as though I do not," Harry said, raising his head, looking towards Draco once more and taking in the details of that face, imperfect and beloved. "I see you and my very soul leaps within me. It seems to me a great achievement that you have been in the room for the better part of a minute and I have managed not to reach for you. You have a great deal of power over me, Draco, and I fear that you are unafraid of exerting it."
Ron frowned. “I will.”
He should have known Draco would be his destruction. Perhaps he had known, just been reluctant to believe it even though
The three friends watched him go.
“We may have been on a date last night but that doesn’t mean…” Draco began.
"Does it help? To know that I love you?"
"Has it been causing problems?" Sirius asked sympathetically.
"Hopeless, Potter!" he snarled as he twisted to resolve the problem. Draco's cock was right in front of Harry then for just a moment as Draco turned, close and mouth-watering. Harry had known that he wanted to touch Draco, that he wanted Draco to use his mouth on him again. He had not expected that he would be so eager to do the same, that the idea would fill him with lust and make his tongue eager to know the flavour. And now with Draco's back to him, he could look all he liked at the beautiful curve of his spine, the lovely supple backside, the strong thighs. He could only look for a moment, though, before his boots and the remnants of his clothing were removed at last and Draco was back on top of him. Their skin was touching from the tops of feet to the press of forehead against forehead before they kissed again, again, again.
"So tell me, Potter," Malfoy said, his voice oddly empty of the mocking tone Harry had come to expect. "Was it really so unnatural and repugnant?"
Harry was confused at being led out onto the street to a carriage rather than to the fireplace through which they had arrived. "We will not travel by Floo?"
It was rather inevitable, he supposed, that the bill was being particularly supported by the other new member of the committee: Lucius, Lord Malfoy.
"But it is not something you yourself would countenance." Draco's tone was light, but his body was taut as a coiled spring.
Potter looked embarrassed. “We hadn’t had sex for a long time. And when we talked about it he said he was really sorry but he just wasn’t that into sex anymore. I knew it had to be me and he was just too kind to say so.”
“Do it again?” Draco managed; it was that or risk sounding like an idiot under a Babbling Curse.
“Not a word I would have chosen, but I take your meaning.”
“Very well. Jolty!”
Malfoy hummed in something that might have been pleasure and might have been triumph, and moved his head toward Harry's face again. At that Harry at last found the will to jerk himself away, but he had somehow been turned so that his back was to the wall and there was nowhere to go as Malfoy pressed his lower body into Harry's, slipping his thigh between Harry's legs.
“What do you hope to achieve by it?”
And now he was thinking of Draco even here. It was not the suite that had become saturated with Draco after all; it was Harry himself.
Harry found a bench and put his head in his hands. All the choices before him were bad, and he knew it.
Harry thought himself unnoticed until, during a particularly lovely aria, Malfoy shifted in his seat and looked over at him. That ever-present smirk was on his lips and he raised his eyebrow just enough that Harry registered the change.
Charlie was frowning now. “Ginny’s happy with Blaise, she wouldn’t…”
"Thank you; I will go there. Please bring in some tea."
Draco met his gaze levelly. "I fear that another will steal you from me. I am near consumed with these thoughts and I find myself hating your friends, your godson and most especially your wife and children."
Teddy turned towards him then. "Harry, are you well?"
He was greeted with a clap on the shoulder from Ernie, but when he turned, Lucius was looking straight at him, brow furrowed. Harry straightened and raised his chin.
"Think about it tomorrow," he said at last, touching Harry's sleeve.
betray Ginny." He had, already, so badly, but he couldn't tell Hermione of that; he could only hope that she could help him make it
"Do not tell me I am wrong to love my children," Harry said, his voice low and dangerous.
now and it had happened quite without him realising it. Watching Malfoy had taken him from shame to lust faster than he could possibly have imagined.
“I beg the court’s indulgence, as this man is a Muggle I will keep the questioning short in order to keep the obliviator’s work to a minimum.”
With a soiree of such distinction taking place in such a public area, and a place without Floo access no less, Harry knew Sirius had gone to great lengths to ensure that the guests would encounter minimal difficulties in travelling to the park. Portkey centres had been set up to allow entry at certain points around the site, with house elves waiting to take cloaks and hats from the guests. Apparition points had also been made available, but with a strict RSVP policy so that time slots could be allocated.
Harry forced a smile. “Well, I realised that I have been lax about connecting with my fellow Wizengamot members. It is so easy to become all but a hermit.”
"Father always did tell me how important it was to take an interest in policy," Draco said dismissively. "But I shall not have a seat until he is passed."
He was English and proud of it but not blind to the faults of the Empire, and determined to make at least his small corner of it better. That was what he had fought the war for, to stand up to injustice. Somehow he had forgotten how much purpose such action had given him; he would not forget again.
“And of course, you have the Potter and Black fortunes on which to draw should misfortune strike.”
That night Harry woke after a mere two hours of sleep, driven to waking by rich, strange dreams. He had been lying next to Ginny in that hotel they had visited after they were married, laughing and touching in the first discovery of the marriage bed. Harry had felt so in love then, so happy. But in the dream he looked up as he ran his hands over his wife's skin to find Malfoy watching from the corner. When his eyes met Harry's he ran his tongue over his lower lip and smiled, contemptuous and arrogant.
What could he say to that?
~o0o~
Hermione looked at Harry long and hard. He stood and let her look, wondering how much of his desperation she could see in his face.
Sensing the shift in mood, Draco said, "Yes?"
He resolved to do more even as his eyes flickered to the carriage clock behind Snem's desk, counting down the hours until seven o'clock.
“Charlie!” Draco said, pinning on a winning smile. “How delightful to see you again.”
On that at least Draco could agree with him. Neither of them was supposed to be dead, or both of them were. Or they were supposed to be in some other, parallel world where it would be just the two of them, no societal expectation to dictate who Harry will love and demand that Draco crawl wounded out of sight in repentance for his endless list of crimes.
“I cannot. The vote has been made. And if the bill comes back without significant amendment, I shall vote it down again.”
Harry would never want Draco to use Voldemort's blood in his resurrection. Draco already knew that Harry was going to have a hard time forgiving him, but that, that would be too much to ask.
“I s’pose not,” Kirke said. “Thing is, Mr Potter, I’ve got a letter here.”
"I am the Master of Death," Harry says, his lightning-shaped scar blazing with a strange light, the same vivid brilliance in his eyes.
Harry huffed a laugh, his first in several days. “Same old Hermione.”
Malfoy made his way a little haltingly down the hallway, clearly a little worse for Firewhiskey. He seemed completely absorbed in his own thoughts, and didn't see Harry at all.
“I see,” Hermione said when he was finished. “I understand, Harry.”
“Seems reasonable to me,” Diggory said before Hermione could reply. “Bailiffs, take Mr Filch back to the waiting room and bring in…”
Potter groaned and pulled his mouth off Draco and just looked at him for a moment, splaying his hands across Draco’s ribcage. “So perfect,” Potter said, bending down to tug a nipple with his teeth. Draco gave a choked sound, his cock beginning to leak.
Draco gasped as Harry's hands went to divest him of his clothes, pulling away frock coat, waistcoat, cravat, shirt,
“What did you do?”
Harry frowned. He never pressed Draco on the war, and wouldn’t now. He could hardly profess surprise that Draco’s father had encouraged him to support Voldemort.
He had been awake but in a kind of trance, deep inside his own thoughts and pain when the call came: "Potter! You've a visitor."
"Two sons and a daughter," Harry acknowledged.
It hurt, more than Harry had expected.
Harry asked her, as he always did, “How is Ginny?”
“Not overly,” Harry said with a sigh.
Now it was Hermione’s turn. “Harry Potter is well-known and liked in the wizarding world,” she began. “He is known to be kind and thoughtful. He is known to take the time to be kind to those beneath others’ notice and to be an exceptionally loyal friend. And he is rightfully known as the greatest hero of our generation. He sacrificed himself and his own desires over and over again to save us all from the Dark Lord. He was slandered during this dark time, a time when Voldemort was on the rise. I will prove the allegations that he is a predator untrue, just as the assertions that lied about Voldemort were proven to be untrue.”
"He doesn't half smell," Smith opined as they hauled him towards what Harry supposed must be the visiting rooms.
Harry instead nudged Draco over, turning him on his stomach. Draco looked at first as though he might make some kind of protest but Harry ignored him, grasping his thigh to move it so that he could run his tongue up Draco's leg and up to his buttocks.
"Yes," Harry said at once. "Absolutely yes."
"This will not do at all, Muffy. Here I am entering a public place and I find a hole in my shawl. Now I want you to fetch me another shawl, in the same hue. While I am out I expect you to mend this, and any other damage done to any item in my wardrobe. And when you are done, report to the Head Elf at the Manor for punishment."
A lot of readers angry with Draco at the end of the last chapter! That's part of why this fic sat for so long. But Harry and I both figured out how to handle it, as you'll see ;)
"Ah? So did Mother." Malfoy's eyes flickered between Harry's eyes and his mouth. His face relaxed. "Do I assume you're here to ask me not to speak of your interest in the windward passage?"
now. The whole world would know and Harry’s name would become a curse.
Malfoy's mouth, wet and hungry and desperate, worked frantically at Harry's own, tongue swiping over Harry's lips, enticing them to open. Malfoy's arms were coming around Harry's body but Harry struggled, pulling his mouth away.
Lucius’s face twisted and he looked at Harry with pure hatred in his eyes. “Very well,” he spat. “Very well. I would like to enter this into evidence.”
“It means I can use the overruling of that objection as the basis for an appeal, if it comes to that.”
Harry shuffled. "I do not know. Ginny, there may be a great deal of business in town…"
After Harry drank it and made good on his promise, the two lay tangled together in their bed.
Harry twisted his fingers experimentally and Draco's body arched again. Draco's cock was fully erect now, Harry noticed with relief. His own had begun to leak.
"Not this morning," Ginny would reply. "There is a treatment of the skin I am to take."
Draco's mouth curled unhappily. "I do not believe anyone has ever ignored me so effectively, before or since. Excepting my father, of course."
“To annoy you, of course, dear Draco,” Blaise drawled. “It is the central preoccupation of my life.”
~o0O0o~
"I cannot live without you," Draco told the body on the slab as he poured more of the elixir down its throat. The Elixir of Life would have kept them alive forever but it wasn't enough yet, because the body, this assembled body had never really been alive. The Hallows weren't enough because the Resurrection Stone brought him forth but couldn't bind him to the body. Voldemort's ritual it would have to be.
His first dream of Malfoy came into his mind. "I would have you naked and lying on that bed so that I might look at you and touch you as I please." The words came so naturally it almost disturbed him – he had been so afraid, before, of confessing his desires but now it seemed impossible not to give voice to them.
"They stopped you from seeing him?"
It had to stop.
Draco stilled. “What will you say to my father?”
Harry's whole skin felt skin flushed and damp with sweat as Draco finally broke eye contact to swallow him down to the root. Harry could do nothing but throw back his head with a choked, broken-off cry, his hands opening and closing reflexively before he gave in and buried them in Draco's hair, thrusting into Draco's throat until he was coming. Draco gave a moan of appreciation as the hot flood filled his mouth and Harry opened his eyes again to watch Draco lick him clean, his eyes on Harry's face again, his own hand stroking himself to completion.
~o0o~
Draco tilted his head to consider. "Now should I get some for you, or should I watch you suffer? It's difficult to know which will amuse me more, your gratitude or your misery."
"Come on," Draco said, and it sounded more like an order than a plea. "Come on."
Draco could hardly deny the charge. “Well,” he began in a confidential tone, leaning in. For a moment he breathed in that masculine scent and almost became distracted – but no, he was pursuing a higher cause today. “I heard a rumour that Wood and Potter parted ways due to lack of common interest and you were, er, comforting Potter in his hour of need?”
"Oh, goodness," said Sirius abruptly, "is that Remus over there?"
“Hey! That’s only,” Draco paused. “Mostly true,” he accepted with a wince.
Charlie Weasley was not a man who could sit around idle. He might have been technically on holiday from his work in Romania, but Draco knew he wouldn’t be sitting around doing nothing during his days off, not even taking a lie-in. He was always up at six o’clock sharp, exercising to keep his arms strong for the work with the dragons.
The two men sat for a moment, lost in thought.
Harry's jaw went slack. "You did?"
“Are you well, Potter?” asked Amelia Bones in the hallway.
~o0o~
Harry took a deep breath. "I fear I may be under someone's influence."
Draco whispered, "No," and the memory ended, cutting off all that had followed.
Harry felt his stomach twist. This was almost exactly the quarrel they had had over the Yule Ball months before. Harry didn't want to repeat the argument but the thought of spending time with Draco's parents, even if the subject of their relationship was never so much as referenced, was deeply unsettling.
"I hope to see much of you," Harry said softly.
"Draco," Harry said, his heart in his mouth. "Draco, don't you want-"
Harry woke to a sharp flash of sensation. He moaned, still partly asleep, and heard Draco's choked response; his mouth was already around Harry's cock.
Harry had been quite lulled into relaxing when danger found him again.
It went on in this vein for some time: Simpson initially demurred on the grounds that the hotel had a reputation for discretion, but he testified that several young men had come in and out of the hotel and at least one had shared breakfast with Mr Potter. On one occasion three young men had come in together and gone to the suite, apparently.
"Was his mother with him in the north by any chance?" Sirius asked, mischief in his eyes.
Kreacher’s muttering filled the hallway and Harry opened the door to the parlour a crack so he could see into the hallway.
As it happened, it was Draco who broached the subject first. He'd returned to their suite to find Draco in an affectionate mood. Draco had been lounging on the chaise longue in only trousers and linen, his shirt collar open and his sleeves rolled up.
Baddock gave some kind of squawk but Potter said something soothing and then a moment later stepped into the office, closing the door behind him.
“So you see,” Harry said, his throat dry from the smoke in the room and the effort of talking, “the relationship between Draco and I – I could not possibly give it up.”
“Order! Lord Malfoy, members of the public, please. Mr Potter?”
The rest of that day passed in a blur. Harry stood in front of a crowd of hundreds of witches and wizards from Britain and some guests of note from the continent and delivered his speech on the importance of choosing what is right over what is easy. He had written it weeks before, based on a lesson imparted long ago by Headmaster Dumbledore. Now, though, its importance in his own life had been renewed and he had felt all the passion of a minister lambasting his congregation. Be good or pay the price - that was the message pumping through his body, the message he nearly shouted. Recognise right from wrong and do not fail. The cost of failure is too high, and with that Harry had looked straight at Malfoy, unable to help himself.
The boy Bertram made a hissing sound from between his teeth; Malfoy quelled him with a raised eyebrow and turned back to Harry. There was a speculative silence.
Harry sat himself on the couch. One of the boys – Bertram, perhaps – handed him a sweet-smelling clear liquid which might have been gin or frankly might have been any one of a number of things. Harry smelled it a moment longer to ensure it wasn’t a potion and then took a long sip.
Sirius patted his hand. “You will see, Harry. The Malfoys will always have their supporters but as long as you are respected as a hero, Lucius can do nothing more than spread rumours which your allies will dismiss as spite.”
"But now there's Lily," he said softly, and Ginny smiled her agreement into his shoulder. "So we'll do what we have to do and then we'll go back to Godric's Hollow." He kissed Ginny's forehead gently and her smile widened.
"Very good, my lord," Filch was saying. "The chamber on the left is free." He began shooing the boys from the antechamber: Malfoy caught Bertram by the cravat and dragged him through the door.
He looked up at her, tears forming in his eyes. “I know, Mione. You can’t help me now.”
Harry gripped the arm of the couch tight, shoving his feelings down. When the next tot of gin was handed to him he drank it at once. Draco had been methodically stripped naked now. He kept glancing over at Harry for reassurance, perhaps, or maybe in an attempt to connect. But Harry knew his face was like stone and eventually Draco stopped. He had Hastings on the floor in front of him, cock in mouth, and Kirke behind him, opening him up with his fingers. The sight was nowhere near as arousing as that first time. It was only painful as Kirke kissed Draco’s shoulders and tugged on his own cock until he was ready to slip inside. Harry watched it all from far away, a roaring in his ears growing louder every moment Draco kept his eyes closed and Harry his feelings locked away.
. If he could have found his voice he would have begged, as Potter began to bob his head up and down, paying special attention to the head, working his lips over the top before sinking back down again to take Draco deep into his throat.
“No, no,” Draco said, laughing at himself, “of course, you’d never do that to your sister.”
Remus smiled sadly. "For better or worse, Harry. We marry, and we make promises, and though it may be hard, we must try to live by them. So if time is what you need, then take time. But remember that she is waiting, and that cutting yourself off from everyone this way is not good for you."
"With whom?"
Sirius nodded. The bitterness in his eyes transmuted into outright hatred as he spat, "Thus solving two family problems with one masterstroke."
~o0O0o~
Harry forced himself not to react as his character was thoroughly reviled and misrepresented. He could not stop an angry, shamed flush from staining his cheeks, but he did not raise his head once. The crowd did it for him, calling out their objections to Lucius’s words until Diggory gave up and cast a silencing charm on the gallery so that the Wizengamot could hear what he was saying. Harry wondered what would happen if a mistrial was declared. Would that be the end of it or would he be back here in a month?
In the end he shrugged. "So what are we having?" he asked.
“Can we go into the shop now, Uncle Charlie?” she said, quiet but distinct.
Sirius stared at Harry for a long moment before he finally gave a bark of utterly humourless laughter and demanded, “For the love of Merlin, Harry, have you run mad?”
They had met in the Atrium; Diggory had managed to look for all the world as though he had merely been passing through but Harry did not believe it for a moment. He followed the Minister into the lifts and to the first floor into his office while Diggory greeted the other people they passed throwing only the occasional pleasantry Harry’s way until finally they reached the office and closed the door.
Harry looked around from one face to another. "I think perhaps you are all the worse for drink."
Draco raised an eyebrow. "I often wonder the same, my family being as they are."
"Looking for pictures of the Holyhead Harpies are you, sir?" said the boy behind the counter. There was something oddly insolent in his tone, but when Harry looked up the face seemed over-friendly, if anything.
The jinx knocked Kirke away from Draco and smack into the other side of the room. Harry was across the room and hauling Draco into his arms and away from Hastings. A trail of saliva connected the boy’s slack mouth with Draco’s cock and Harry found himself shoving Draco into the wall. His grey eyes were wide, he grunted as his back hit the wall and then Harry was on him, hands possessive. He was almost fully dressed while Draco was naked against the revolting wallpaper and it was the only thing he felt he had control of in this moment. He smashed his lower body against Draco, the others in the room forgotten as he kissed Draco senseless, urging his lover to ride his thigh. He hadn’t known what reaction to expect from Draco, had thought he might rebel but instead he gasped and begged.
"Oh! Of course," Molly said, distracted at once into moving on to James and Albus, allowed to stay up past their usual bedtimes and pleased as anything for it. Ginny spared Sirius a grateful glance, while Harry turned to Bill and Fleur.
, which Harry recognised as Italian, a language he did not speak.
Harry looked away. "Your family counselled you against it, I am sure."
“Yes – no!”
Hermione again stood. “Minister, I still don’t see the relevance of this witness testimony.”
"Nothing to fear," Harry echoed. Of course there was nothing to fear. Harry had once blazed defiance and strength into the face of the Dark Lord Voldemort. He had always been rather mild-mannered and this attitude had become more and more of a habit in recent years to the point where he even felt himself meek, but he had not expected that even Sirius would have been so deceived. The self-loathing threatened to flare again; Harry forced it down.
“A man in the bed, you say?”
This compromise on the imprisonment was, in Hermione’s opinion, good news.
“No,” Harry said suddenly. “No, you know that’s not what he would say. Or else he would be here.”
Welcome to Book 3, where things kick up a notch. Coming up we have more filthy sex acts, unsafe in more ways than one. Bear in mind that as the summary says, "Sodomy is a hanging offence": the 1850s were not a good time to be homosexual and this isn't a fluffy AU where real world laws or attitudes are ignored. Triggers for homophobia and violence in every chapter.
But Harry was beyond caring about anything except the fact that he had been unable to see Draco for two weeks and was now mere feet away from him. With an abrupt lurch, Harry pulled Draco out of his chair and against him, his tongue finding entry to Draco's mouth as though no time had passed at all between the kiss goodbye all those weeks ago and this moment here and now. He was touching Draco and at peace again. Draco's bright smile curved against him, but Harry was not in the mood to be teased. He pushed Draco back, stood up out his chair and kissed him again, more fiercely this time, demanding and hungry.
Lord Malfoy's tirade ended abruptly as Harry, unable to bear another moment, pulled out his wand and cast the silencing spell. None of the Malfoys had noticed him do it, too absorbed in the battle of wills between father and son.
"Perhaps now some of that brandy?"
If Sirius had said something of the kind Harry could have retorted but this was Ron and Harry didn't know what to say.
"You need to sleep."
“Now, will you tell me?”
In the morning, Harry woke earlier than expected and ordered breakfast for himself in the suite’s sitting room. He stripped himself of the clothes he’d slept in and was half-dressed in his dressing gown when the knock at the door came.
. "Please, Hermione," Harry said and as he raised his eyes to hers again, he felt the weight of frustrated tears welling in his own. "Please, there is no one I rely on more than you."
"Ron and Hermione have an occupation and a cause respectively," Harry pointed out. He swallowed hard. What he was saying was true, it was all true, but the fact was that he was trying to leave his wife behind in order to begin an affair proper with a man. He almost wished that she would push her point and prevent him from going – but then he saw in her eyes that she meant to and he felt a flash of fear. Draco had promised him all he had hoped for and he would have it.
Harry didn't feel any different.
"It is a great pleasure," Draco said, his eyes intent. "I would wish you to know both aspects of it. I would wish to do everything I have ever thought of with you, to know you as my lover completely. I know you fear the one; very well, let us try the other. You will see the pleasure you give me and you will no longer fear the act. And you should not fear it, Harry," and the rare use of his given name made Harry realise just how serious Draco was. "You should not fear that your own body will betray you."
“So we’ll work out something he wants more.”
A small cheer went up. It really was going to be a circus, Harry reflected. The show of support warmed him but how long could it conceivably last?
Harry almost welled up when she said it. It was the certainty of a friend who knew exactly what he was capable of and what he was not – and to whom he was still the same person despite all the revelations of the hour.
“Shut up, Blaise! He wants me and I will make him see it.” Draco took a long, aggressive draw on his cigarette before stubbing it out. “By the time I’m done he will be completely at my mercy. He will swear he loves me and weep when I leave him.”
Harry raised his eyes to Sirius, who seemed to flinch away from the expression in them. "Yes, they are."
"Are you not afraid to be seen with me, now that your family has remembered your existence?"
Harry blushed and ducked his head down, but Draco would not permit him to withhold an answer. "Only you," he said at last, and it was worth the embarrassment for Draco's smile.
“Still working through her feelings,” Hermione always replied. “Give her time, Harry.”
Harry placed a gentle hand on his shoulder; Draco shook it off. "They'll never be happy until I marry, you know."
Harry shivered at the thought. Yes, it was true, he knew it. He caressed Draco's hair as Draco knelt still, his head in Harry's lap. He should have been sated, he knew, and he
"You are, after all, our hero," Draco said, a little mocking. "How must it feel to have achieved what will likely be your greatest success in life before you had even fully become a man?"
Mercifully, at that moment Draco's mother arrived. "Lucius, you're not torturing the poor boy who has come to celebrate with us, are you?"
“Then how can I refuse?” Harry said at last. “I hope you know that I would countenance such a thing for none but you.”
Harry opened his eyes and smiled at Sirius as best he could. “I think you should speak to Remus. I think if this is your chance you should catch hold of it with both hands.”
It could not last, of course. Nothing ever does.
morning?”
~o0O0o~
Harry could hardly say that he was surprised to discover that Nott, too, was like them. He had already had unarticulated suspicions about Zabini. It made sense that people with any such secret in common would band together. Who else could understand?
"Bones Estate, Sirius, it is not too taxing," Harry replied dryly.
"No," Malfoy agreed. He tilted his head to one side and smirked. "Quite the opposite in fact."
Fawley had been watching this interaction and said, with a kindly tone, “I think that’s enough time, Lord Potter.”
Harry sat on the floor, curled up in the corner between the wood and the wall. The Harry beyond the veil, that is. Harry's body was always on the slab; it never moved.
“It’s not going to be easy, is it? Given that I’m guilty as sin.”
"Oh, I'm sure she was," Sirius said, reaching out to pat Harry's shoulder. "She does exactly what she wants, and while that's a trait worth admiring it's also something to stay far, far away from."
"If you like," said Harry, "but only a few days. I prefer to be back in my own space before committees resume."
The carriage jerked slightly as the horses negotiated the corner onto Oxford Street, the sunlight on the brisk spring day illuminating the elegant facades of Grosvenor Square. Inside the carriage, Harry kissed his wife's temple gently. "You see? We've arrived in London. We'll be there soon."
"Oh?" Draco was the picture of nonchalance at this, save for the way his fingers twitched. He had a nervous habit of fiddling with his cufflinks; Harry had noticed that they were charmed to sit perfectly in place, meaning that the only time Draco needed to reach for them was when he was desperate to give his hands something to do. "And what was he arguing today?"
Diggory was speaking. “I’m sure you do, Lucius, but it is hardly an unreasonable point.”
How to get it involved going through Ron Weasley, who stood on the staircase in Grimmauld Place with his wand grimly held out in front of him.
The silenced crowd were applauding her – Harry could see their hands moving. He met her gaze and smiled, relief breaking over his face. Perhaps there would be a way through this after all.
“I just… I remember how badly it affected you. Last time.”
The letter crumpled in his hand. He had left Ginny behind but he could never sever the ties between them. Draco had the right of it. Harry wondered if this was a sign, if now, having indulged his desire he could return, refreshed to his life as it had been.
Harry sighed. "Very well, I shall ask Ginny, and when she says no I will accompany you."
Sirius nodded. "Well, I shall have to attend of course – and it would be terribly poor if I were not to bring any guests after having Mrs Bones extend the invitation."
Harry looked at him, incredulous. Draco was forever berating him for his bourgeois taste in everything from furnishings to robes.
and he knew what he wanted so why had his resolve abandoned him in that crucial moment?
Harry smiled shyly. “Yeah?”
Lucius nodded, mock-believing him.
"I thought this trip was about
It was a beautiful scene he painted, but…
Harry sighed. "I was engaged in a discussion not so very long ago about the role of the Muggle-born in the wizarding world."
Harry kissed Draco's wrist, turning to kiss palm and fingers and then to place it back against his cheek. "I mean it."
"There is," Hermione said, breathing out hard, "one thing I must know."
"There you are!" Ginny said, all smiles when Harry returned. "The last of the guests just arrived so I believe we may proceed." She lowered her voice to say, "The Malfoy family is here – did you know Sirius had invited them?"
Harry had always had more gold than he had known what to do with. His estates generated wealth, he had inherited cash from his father's family and, all things considered, he and Ginny lived quite modestly. The galleons were just sitting there. Harry now had reason to spend them.
That subject had not been brought up between them since the night it happened.
The words that brought the Dark Lord back into being were hard to find recorded but they were held of course by the Department of Mysteries.
"Do you enjoy Darjeeling, Lord Potter?" Lucius said as he sat down, indicating to the house elf that the tea should be poured.
"Lord Malfoy," Harry acknowledged. "How do you do?"
Harry smiled, wide and shaky and genuine. "Thank you," he said, feeling saved.
"I am," Harry said. "I am sorry to impose, I should have sent an owl at the very least but I'm afraid my thoughts were somewhat in disarray. Can we talk?"
A fortnight went by. Harry's days were marked by playing with his sons, ushering a string of in-laws through Sirius' house to see Ginny, and worst of all watching Molly Weasley fuss and Ginny cling to her where usually she would have insisted that she could look after herself.
"Well, here we are at least. We have made it through the summer," Ginny said, mostly to herself. “And I have lived another year.”
"You must have read the Greeks, Potter," Draco said. "This is not some new assault on society; the desire between men has been with us since the birth of civilisation. It is not an
~o0o~
"That explains why you reek of cigars and why you seem so tired. Did he not offer you any Pepper-Up potion?"
Harry tightened his grip on Sirius' fingers.  "They arranged for Remus to marry her."
“Not delicately, sir.”
Draco, gasping, forced himself to stand. "Yes, Father," he forced out though his eyes watered and his body language was full of misery.
Kreacher scowled. "Yes Master," he said before turning to mutter to himself all the way out of the room.
“Far too easy to manipulate,” Diggory said. “Although admittedly they are easy to overlook. I have one room where certain conversations are held for precisely that reason. This one, on the other hand…”
"I don't know if I can," Harry whispered.
, Harry thought again as Draco curled his tongue around Harry's own.
"It's that serious?" she asked, her eyes wide.
"Every moment. And you?"
for weeks – maybe years! And questions will be asked. If the people’s darling could succumb to such a
"Thank you. Now, did Sirius leave any word?"
"Do you think I care a whit what Draco says?" Sirius burst out, a man pushed beyond endurance.  "Listen to me, as you should have when I told you to stay away from him: if you pursue this course it can lead only to your destruction."
The stronger wand was not enough. Draco knew that, as Harry had known that. He himself had to be stronger, had to overcome the loss and the silence and twist the world into being as he would have it be.
Weakness: Outright loon where Potter is concerned
Harry would go alone, stare at the Eagle stone and listen to the local guide tell him of the legends. The Brahn Seer, a local clairvoyant, had made a prophecy about what would happen should the stone fall and Harry found himself almost wishing that it would, that the lovely valley would be destroyed by flooding just so he could go home.
Draco forced his eyes open and met Potter’s gaze.
Harry had been lingering in the corridor for the better part of an hour waiting for Malfoy to decide to retire. The alcohol seemed to have smoothed his usual sharp edges away. Harry reached out on impulse to touch his face.
Zabini shrugged, a very Gallic gesture which caught Harry's attention – where exactly was this man from? But he was continuing to speak. "My mother has been here for her health since July, with Lady Malfoy as her particular friend. They found themselves liking it so well they saw fit to summon Draco and I. It is strange how we men must live by the whims of women, is it not?"
Harry burrowed deeper into Draco's arms. Draco gave a soft laugh. "Ah, you are alive in there."
He had taken the potion precisely as directed and retired to his rooms. He had told Sirius that he was feeling under the weather and let the potion do its work. It was designed to flush his entire system and Harry spent most of the night in the water closet. But in the morning he felt merely hungry and tired. The thought of Malfoy still made his body react in the same way. His dreams had been full of the man and without the Draught of Peace his stomach was a pit.
knew his business, knew that he no longer lived with Ginny. Blind items in the
"Oh, yes," said Lucius, a thin smile appearing on his lips. "I saw you at Portree with your lovely wife but a week ago. And how does she fare?"
"This style of tying is the
After that, Harry said nothing.
Harry did not know how to answer. He settled on, "I'm not sure."
Broken, desperate sounds were pouring from Draco's throat. Normally, Harry loved doing this, but just then it wasn't enough. He tore his mouth away.
It was effort wasted. The second he entered the bedroom to see Draco kneeling on the bed, naked and waiting for him he had to clutch at the doorframe to keep himself in check. He felt a surge inside him that felt less like the urge of a lover and more like the rush a bird of prey must feel at snatching a defenceless animal from the ground in order to devour it. He felt powerful and hungry and wild, all at once, and when Draco shifted his upper body forward in a strangely demure motion, his eyes on Harry's, there was no help for it at all. Harry was on him at once.
The knowing look on Lord Draco's face sent Harry into a panic; he could barely bring himself to shake the man's gloved hand.
Wordlessly, Harry did as he was bid.
“I?” Blaise laughed. “My family has an estate in Sicily. I will return to it, marry some local witch with a suitable fortune who is not put off by my mother’s martial misfortunes, and make out of all this quite well. But I would rather not be in the position where I fear to return to what I do regard as my home. Which is exactly what will happen, Potter. I know these people in ways you do not and they are malicious beyond all.”
"No," Draco agreed. "No, you should be able to feel it when I touch you." Without thinking, he looked back over his shoulder to the body on the slab.
Well, that was when Potter shacked up with Oliver Wood.
Draco smirked, and sauntered through the door naked. Harry laughed to himself and followed, not bothering to cover himself.
The court was in such an uproar that Diggory had to clear it so proceedings ended for the day. Harry was dragged back to his cell all but catatonic in his shock, but somewhere between the courtroom and his cell the rage and pain hit and he began to roar without meaning to, lashing out in all directions as the weight of the day landed on him all at once.
Harry had rather forgotten himself, but when he looked towards Ron’s feet he saw a familiar, hulking black shape. “Padfoot?”
Harry dressed with particular care for the party that night: the finest of his dress robes with a white shirt, cravat and waistcoat. Dobby tied the cravat, chattering away to himself and Harry tried not to remember Malfoy's habit of matching his robes to his waistcoat.
"I was invited."
"You are anxious to return to town," Ginny acknowledged. "I never thought you would become so involved in politics."
Harry wanted to tell Sirius that he already was, by virtue of his new-found vice; however, his resolve to behave less like a child did not seem robust enough yet to survive such melodrama. "I am sorry. I only… Nothing has quite worked out as I hoped it would."
. He tangled his fingers in Potter’s hair, breaking the kiss long enough to press his mouth to Potter’s throat, felt Potter jerk in reaction and thought,
In response Draco crushed their mouths together, licking the spit and precum from Harry’s chin on his way to plundering his lover’s mouth. He slid off the rest of Harry’s clothes gently, so gently, his touches feather-light at first before becoming harder, more passionate but no less tender. His mouth curved in the purest joy Harry had ever seen him display.
“Yessir.”
And, most damningly, the incident in summer the year before.
this time. She simply bit her lip and nodded, hauling him into her arms.
Sirius grimaced. "The woman is my cousin Narcissa. Extremely apt, no woman ever loved herself so much. Remember, I warned you her son would be in your year at Hogwarts. Her husband…" But then another man came to speak with Sirius and press his embarrassing thanks on Harry, and Sirius forced himself to return to his better manners.
~o0O0o~
Something in Harry relaxed. He’d known. He
“So you offered to sell it back to him?”
Harry wondered if that would send Lucius into a rage but he barely acknowledged that his son had spoken, saying only, "Draco, please," as though he had merely spilled tea. "Children are so important," he went on, addressing Harry. "They carry on our traditions. Will yours be taught the traditional pureblood values?"
Malfoy eyed him. "Perhaps I misspoke. We shall conclude this night's business. I somehow doubt that will see an end to this."
“We have to take you through the Atrium to get to the departure point,” Fawley warned him as Smith put cuffs on his wrists. “There are going to be press there, though we’ve cleared the public as best we can.”
Filch whisked the money away and immediately turned obsequious. “Of course, sir, this way sir, at once, sir.” He bowed and scraped, leading them into a different room from last time. This one held a shabby four poster bed, vaguely reminiscent of the Hogwarts dormitories, a tatty silk couch and a bar by the side.
Harry didn't know how to untangle that. He'd known that Draco's relationship with his father was not as Draco would have wished it long before this, but he had never before seen the damage when it was like this, so raw.
A woman about Harry's age looked around from behind Mr Bones; Harry dimly remembered her as their daughter, Susan. Ginny wrote to her from time to time, so Harry made a point of speaking to her now.
“Do you think that to be possible?”
That was not even the worst of it. The day after the nightmare began, an elegant eagle owl arrived bearing Harry a missive in fine cursive. Luckily it came straight to him, obviously having been instructed to deliver it direct rather than allow house elves or other household members to accept it on his behalf. Harry did not need to see the Malfoy seal to know who it was from.
"I don't know what you want," Malfoy said, his shoulders seeming to tighten inwards. "You… I don't know what you want."
"Mother," he said, relieved.
Harry started. "Oh, is Remus visiting you? I am sorry to impose."
Sirius, Lord Black, had raised Harry for most of his childhood, and it was with pleasure that Harry now greeted him.
More afraid than he had been at any previous point in the trial, Harry clenched his fists as Lucius poured the silvery mist into the Pensieve and Harry found himself inside someone else’s memory.
Harry did not leave Grimmauld Place at all for the first week. He spent his time with his boys or with Ginny, unable to do much except watch them, terrified that if he wasn't there one of them would die. He
were all very well and good but the items in question would need to be blind, deaf and dumb to conceal the target of the insinuations.
Draco snorted. "Sirius Black would have you believe that he flouts convention but in truth he is just as conservative as all the other lords."
Harry felt shame flood his face.
Hermione had written a note to Harry on the desk before them. It was simply three question marks together.
Long after Blaise left with his memories, Harry brooded on what he had been shown, and all Blaise had said. The thing was, he could not tell himself that the memory had been altered – he knew what that looked like. Nor was it some stage play in Polyjuice – he knew Draco and that had been him.
"Indeed?" Hermione spat. She glared at him another moment then pulled out her wand. Harry wondered for a moment if she meant to hex him but instead she pointed her wand at the door, whispering the spell that would prevent them from being overheard. "You know that I am thinking of how hurt Ginny has been and yet how staunchly she has defended you against all criticism? I have said not one word of my suspicions to her and yet I can see in her face that she feels she has failed you as a wife?"
“Isn’t that against the law?” Harry asked as Hermione made circular motions with her wand, muttering to herself.
Harry wondered what would happen if his connection to Draco ever came to light but that was a foolish fear. It was over, done, and the risk was past just the same as the joy.
"How do you do?" Lord Malfoy responded, eyeing the finest robes Harry had ever owned with a disdainful eye. Lord Malfoy was notoriously a class snob and the fact that he was even deigning to acknowledge Harry Potter the half-blood was either a testament to Harry's notoriety or perhaps…
“She saw Draco in the suite once, in the morning. I think she suspected, but she didn’t say anything.”
He had known it would start with whispers. He had kept his ears and eyes sharp. He had tried to ask Sirius what to do but his godfather had no comfort or advice to offer.
Dobby was summoned, drinks were poured and Harry began his tale. He omitted some details – the renters, the roles between the two, the most private details. He talked well into the night and Sirius listened well and calmly, lighting cigarettes in between drinks.
Lucius smiled, or at least bared his teeth. “I will therefore see you later this week, if not before.” He raised his eyes to his son. “Your mother would be grateful for a visit,” he said, and then he was walking away, back to his ever-faithful shadow, Crabbe, who smirked at Harry before the two sat at a table with several others on the other side of the Atrium.
“He cannot have this!” Draco spat. “He cannot come between us.”
Malfoy's head jerked up then to look at Harry and Harry saw his expression: confused, shocked and helpless. At once he understood: Draco was used to being the one in control and Harry had challenged that. He'd blurred the lines by becoming the pursuer. For a moment Harry wondered if it would mean Draco would no longer desire him and he felt sick, but then Draco made a terrible noise deep in his throat and then he was kissing Harry again, both hands on his face, pulling him closer and closer.
"Indeed, and both quite to excess I assure you! Well, at least it will be summer soon."
“We can’t all live entirely on cold mutton like the Queen.”
But Malfoy was pushing at his shoulders. "No," he whispered, and Harry let go at once.
~o0O0o~
Ginny chanced a look at him then and seemed encouraged by what she saw. "Then we shall discuss, tomorrow, how we shall proceed?"
His voice came out hoarse and strange.
Aberforth grunted again and turned his back to Harry, whose mind raced. He considered forcing the issue, but he was certain that he would need all his resolve to make it through whatever might be coming.
Draco blinked stupidly at her. Then, “Potter’s single?”
In the morning, I am going to return to Godric's Hollow, Harry said to himself. I am going to go from there back to London, where I will spend more time with Sirius, learning properly how to manage the Black properties.
For the first time, the uncomfortable thought struck Harry that perhaps he was more responsible for the changes in his wife than he had realised.
Harry in the present had to swallow bile. This was Draco’s own memory. Lucius was right, it offered proof positive that all the allegations were true; he knew what was coming and knew how it was going to make him look. And worst of all, in order for this to be included in the trial, Draco must have given it to his father. The thing did indeed speak for itself.
"Of course," Harry said quickly. "Of course you are." He hated himself for it but said it anyway: "Let me fear losing you a while longer." He kissed her as he had intended to the first time, gently on the forehead. Ginny looked up at him again and then swiftly away.
"Does not always make a Muggle," Lucius said smoothly. "Somewhat to my own regret. But in a sense we have no one to blame for the rise of the half-bloods but ourselves, or at the very least their ancestors. If they would insist on mating with Muggles, what should we have expected but bastard half-base children who would do nothing but pollute our world."
, her hair curled to frame her face to perfection and she was wearing rouge, a fashion Molly had often referred to with scorn. She was overdone and extraordinary.
"Fleur's sister Gabrielle has also offered to assist us in obtaining a cottage in France," Ginny went on. "Regardless, I think a move would do them good. They could attend Beauxbatons when they reach the right age, unless of course the situation here is much changed."
"Of course. Dobby, tea in the parlour," Sirius said, gesturing.
Harry nodded, his stomach flipping as old memories came alive. "A staunch supporter of the Dark Arts. Pleaded Imperius to avoid Azkaban."
“He would never hurt
So when Ginny told him the price of seeing his children — "You must never, ever see Draco Malfoy again" — Harry thought of how many times over the last year he had told himself that same thing and how impossible it had felt.
Lucius looked at his son for a long moment even as Narcissa said, "Tea is a matter of preference, my dear. Exotic blends are all very well but provided the leaves are of a high quality, one may choose a different flavour on any given day."
“Stop that,” said Draco irritably. “We all know you can speak English perfectly well, and neither of us here finds that accent sexy.”
“That is what you learned?” Harry asked, his own heart breaking a little. “That love was not worth it?”
"You may be a sodomite and you may consort with sodomites, but you will
"May I help you, sir?" began the chain of events which ended with Harry outside on the terrace, cigarette in his hand, the cool Highland air soothing him. He pulled in another deep breath of smoke to clear his lungs and sighed.
Draco said nothing at first. Then he laughed, hollow and hurt. “I knew you’d eventually leave me. I knew you wouldn’t love me enough.”
The arrival of the food was a pleasing distraction. Harry immediately reached for a slice of pork pie, which he topped with piccalilli.
"Indeed," Harry said. "She is taking the waters."
"I have no doubt," Zabini said, still looking at Harry. "Do join us this evening, Mr Potter, it will make it quite the party."
Harry blinked a few times. When Draco came back into focus he had a little of Harry's come at the corner of his mouth. Aroused anew by the thought of Draco drinking his very essence, Harry licked at what remained without hesitation, kissing Draco fiercely.
"The first time, yes, as the act of love is for a woman. But would you say then that a woman must always regret having given herself to her lover?"
"No."
Remus seemed to feel that enough had been said, as he permitted the change of subject and the rest of their luncheon was spent in much more pleasing conversation.
Ginny had already taken a sleeping draught by the time Harry went to check on her, so he need not have braced himself for her displeasure at going out without her. Ginny had been fractious recently, which was not at all like her, and Harry found himself hoping against hope that it was merely the effect of pregnancy.
.” Draco’s wand flew into Harry’s waiting hand. He made no move to resist.
Harry took off his hat and cloak with a sigh. “I voted down the bill.”
“Because he was too good to even know who I was at school and when we met again, I saw in his eyes that he wanted me.”
Harry pulled from his waistcoat pocket a small velvet pouch. He had considered what to get for Draco, who had more money than he and liked to joke about his taste. In the end, he had decided on a gift more heartfelt than lavish, and had purchased a love token.
PLEASE READ THIS NOTE: a kind reader pointed out a couple of inconsistencies in the plot and on looking back I realised I'd posted the chapter here below (in its rightful place) instead of chapter 3. So if something there was jarring, that would be why. I'm so sorry. I have no idea how I managed to do this.
Harry stood and touched Draco’s dear, beautiful, pointy face. “Make love to me, Draco.”
"Mozart's
Ginny, Sirius, better judgement – all thoughts of anything but this moment flew from Harry's head. "Yes," he breathed and Malfoy smiled.
him.”
When he opened it, to his shock it was not breakfast – or rather, not just breakfast. Beside the porter stood Harry’s wife.
“Yes, you did, Harry,” Hermione said, her tone firm though not accusatory. “None of this will be without cost.”
“Draco,” Charlie said, half-pleased, half-puzzled. “Isn’t it a little early for you?”
"Come in, Harry!" Teddy called, his face bright with the pleasure of the cool water. "Come in, it's wonderful!"
Draco ignored him, entering the room and dropping hat and cane on the table, his cloak joining them. "Have you spent all evening smashing things?" He brushed past Harry to look into the fireplace. "If you have I suppose you must have repaired them."
Ron stared up at him from the floor, his eyes full of fear. Once that might have made Draco hard.
"Fuck me," Draco forced out, sounding as though he were dying. Such coarse language shocked Harry, but not to disgust. Rather, he thought it the most arousing thing Draco could possibly have said.
With that she inclined her head and retook her seat.
With visible effort, Sirius turned his thoughts away from his dear friend and gave Harry a piercing gaze. "You know there will still be a great deal of interest in you. Many people will wish to meet the famous slayer of Dark Wizards, Harry Potter."
Granger, this time. "Malfoy, don’t. Harry wouldn't want this."
Draco was not about to let the chance slip away; he bent down, eye to eye with Victoire. “Hello, little one. I am Draco Malfoy and you are?”
Harry flinched, not knowing what to do, wishing he was not witnessing this scene.
Harry wanted to tell him that he did not dare. He feared himself, he feared what he might do if he were to encounter Malfoy again. And yet, could he really allow himself to be held hostage to his fears?
“So? You think they have changed? Lucius Malfoy was a Death Eater not a decade ago and was working on anti-Muggle legislation
Draco laughed. "Oh, indeed? And in the Muggle world, are there not lords and servants, rich and poor, prostitutes and those who buy them? They may have different measures of who is deserving and who is not, but are you telling me they are better?"
"You care whether I stay?"
“No, she wouldn’t.” It was the same certainty she’d used when talking about him. “Say anything, I mean. She blames herself for the two of you being estranged.”
~o0o~
," Sirius went on. "A tragic story."
Draco’s glare shifted to Blaise’s face. “He thinks he’s going to get away? From me? I kissed him senseless and gave him a taste of sweet death and now he thinks to avoid me?” His voice rose with every syllable and Blaise’s calm, sardonic expression was growing strained.
make a sodomite of me!" Harry burst out.
“What?”
“Hey,” Potter said softly. “Hey, look at me.”
“You already chose love over duty and denying it is wasting time! Do you not remember the axiom that discretion is the better part of valour? Of course you don’t, you’re a bloody Gryffindor,” Blaise answered himself. “Potter, you have raised the ire of one of the highest in the land. The Sacred Twenty-Eight will all support Lucius because they cannot afford to have any of the lines go extinct: Draco must marry and produce an heir. It is his fate no matter how he chafes against it and you are in the way. If you let this go on it will be a death knell for all of us.”
One thing struck Harry in particular. “No portraits?”
"You intend to tell him of this?"
Hermione rose. She was clearly startled by everything Harry had said. Her entire statement would have to be rewritten, no doubt. What could she say?
Padfoot butted Harry’s hand with the top of his head, begging for more pets.
He knew, of course, what the next hour or so would entail and he was right. Draco drank from his wine goblet and licked his lips after every single sip. He leaned this way and that, revealing strips of skin, and emphasised every word that could possibly be regarded as an innuendo.
~o0O0o~
Harry had rather hoped to thrash things out with Draco that night but when he returned to the hotel he found Draco sleeping huffily in the middle of a room largely torn to pieces by hand – his wand remained where Harry had left it. Harry sighed and cast a series of
Molly opened her mouth. Harry braced himself.
At the edge of his vision, he saw a flash of silver – something that wasn’t a flash bulb, was something human.
Harry's body is almost perfect. It isn't Harry's original body, of course. They were clever: they burned that one.
"He was present in Scotland," Harry said. "He is a very urbane man, well-spoken. And he argued his case so fluently that I did not know how to put my own forward. To me it is so self-evident that progress in the world should be based on merit that I cannot understand people who think otherwise, yet I find that when challenged, I cannot articulate my reasoning."
It was more than worth the cost.
Sirius snorted. "It is the privilege of the young to be offended when the world does not suit them; older men have learned to live with it."
"No," Harry said, still whining.
Harry went back to his suite furious with himself. He had made his decision, he
That October in London was very warm. Indian summer meant the days could be spent walking through parks, taking in the Great Exhibition, meandering through the Muggle world.
Sorry to post late - kept getting 503 error yesterday :(
Harry never knew how to handle Sirius on the rare occasions when he became serious about something. "I would rather not—"
Potter had kindly cast cleaning charms on them both and handed Draco his clothes while he tugged on his own. Draco, however, could still barely feel his limbs and was enjoying a little more afterglow.
"Well," Draco said, and his hands moved to Harry's buttons. "Let us rectify that at once."
“Why must you always talk this way?” Draco demanded.
The thought was anathema to him. Even with Draco furious and petulant, he would rather be here than back in Strathpeffer, or even Godric's Hollow. He knew now why he was hesitant to give himself fully to Draco; it would be a point of no return. But Harry felt now as though that point had long since been passed. Perhaps in the back room of the Hogs Head, perhaps in the carriage where Draco had first kissed him. Perhaps even before then. He did not know.
Harry had never seen a courtroom as full as it was on the day his trial began. The entire Wizengamot had assembled to hear his case. Ernie met his gaze, a troubled expression on his face. Rosier looked less smug than Harry would have expected, but perhaps the man just had exceptional control of his expressions.
And Harry began to think.
"How do you do?" Harry returned politely. "So kind of you to include my wife and I in your invitation. Unfortunately she is much tired from the journey."
He was still sitting by the door three hours later when Dawlish arrived with a few other Aurors in tow. They all looked sad and serious. None were faces he knew well; they’d been carefully chosen.
Draco still lay on the bed but he at least looked at Harry this time.
Hermione didn't speak.
Draco paid him no attention. "I was sixteen when I was first sent to Beauxbatons. I already had an idea of the kinds of forbidden desires which might come to define me. And there was a boy there from the Jura mountains. His name was—"
important to you." His tone grew more and more vicious as he dressed. "So go back and drool over your children and wrap yourself up in your wife and perhaps indulge in some furtive stroking of your arbor vitae if you can face your sodomite self for long enough!"
When he told her of his intentions Ginny would probably argue with him; he didn't know if that would be better or worse than her meekly allowing him to go. And with that he became irrationally angry again: he didn't know the woman who had replaced his wife. He didn't know how to please her and he no longer wanted to try.
“Well, you know of course that the Weasleys once held seats on the Wizengamot but due to a decline in fortunes over the last few generations, have been reduced to… employment.”
Draco laughed at that, louder than Harry would have expected, enough to catch the attention of a number of other diners. Harry’s gaze darted around the room. Many familiar faces, a number of them alive with curiosity – swiftly hidden when he looked at them direct.
Draco glared.
Draco laughed a little at that, and bent to nuzzle Blaise’s groin through his trousers. Blaise let his head fall back, his hand in Draco’s blond hair.
Harry wasn't particularly enjoying the journey to London himself. Mercifully James and Albus had slept most of the way; Harry doubted his long-term ability to contain their natural exuberance in such a small space.
Draco’s mouth tightened. “That woman will always have a hold on you—”
So Harry did, starting with his confusion and desire, through his affair, his certainty that it was love, of a kind stronger and more passionate than any he had known before. The great love of his life, he told her bitterly. “I found that I could not control myself around him – and most times, I did not even care to. I felt free letting all the cares of the world float away.”
Harry had sighed and walked slowly after him, ready to reprimand him further. But then there was a splash and Teddy stood up in the water.
"So you abandoned me instead," Ginny said grimly. Harry felt shame colour his face. "I cannot live in this limbo," Ginny went on. "I have come to see that I have not been making you happy. Well and so: but avoiding our marriage is hardly likely to improve it."
Harry looked at Zabini in confusion. "I thought you invited me because I would be welcome here."
That was not something he had anticipated; perhaps he should have. "I am very tired, Ginny," he said, knowing that was no kind of answer but what else could he say? He loved Ginny, of course, always, but he had no desire for her. And even if he had felt anything such, he would never be able to look Draco in the face and lie about something like this: he would know.
“Auror Weasley, you’re not supposed to be here.”
Applauding for the end of the first act, Sirius shook his head. "Operas would not exist if it weren't for the messes people make of their lives. The characters never choose someone suitable." For a single man, he sounded rather complacent on this point.
Harry could not relax at all, despite Ernie’s good cheer and the relatively low-key debates. He trusted nothing he saw; there might be whispers in any corner. He was as on edge as he had been in fifth year when the rumours flew that he was crazy, dangerous, unhinged… What would the rumours say now?
“I think,” she said, “you had better tell me all of it.”
"I fold," Zabini said, smoothly drawing Harry's attention. "Well, Potter. We were just talking about the memorial ceremony, as it happens. We all heard you speak, of course. Responsibility, strength of character. Very important values, to be certain. We must accept all the consequences of our actions, would you not agree?"
Hermione, for once, did not interrupt not even to pass judgement. So he told her the rest: Lucius. Kirke. Percy’s dismissal, Blaise’s memory. He omitted only Sirius’s true relationship with Remus which was neither pertinent nor his story to tell.
"You should step aside," Draco replied coolly.
"Does it not hurt?" he asked.
"Thank you, Lady Malfoy." Was it teasing or kind to pretend they had not seen each other at Quidditch? Harry could not say.
"Really?" Draco's mouth twisted into something nastier. "You enjoy that you are become a dark cully?"
"The committee on experimental charms tends to run late." His tone tempted Harry to ask further questions, but they had reached the entrance to the main hall. Above the door was inscribed,
“I see. Is that the only word he sent?” Harry asked, heart in his mouth.
“Fine, fine,” she said, lower lip sticking out for a moment. “Have you decided who will be the first task?”
“There is, of course,” Lucius went on, “an alternative.”
“Thank you. If I can, I’ll write to him.” Harry fiddled with the cuffs of his shirt.
