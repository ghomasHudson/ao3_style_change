“How did you know?” As expected, the owl didn’t respond but looked longingly at the refrigerator. Draco rolled his eyes and rummaged around until he found some leftover spicy breakfast sausage. She wolfed it down in three gigantic bites, then set to work grooming her plumage. Draco took a cigarette from Harry’s pack and lit it on the hob. After the night he’d experienced, he deserved it. Artemis did not approve; she ruffled her feathers and flew out through the open window. Draco stood and watched her silhouette grow smaller as he smoked, stamping out the cigarette before it was finished.
A brief rumbling came from within, but nothing else happened.
Harry closed his eyes again, relaxed, and soon he was elsewhere. He wasn’t flying this time. Each time Harry had dropped acid, he’d started out flying, either levitating or on a broom. This time he was walking, and each footstep was ethereal. Connected. Vibrant. The earth pulsed with magic and Harry could taste it—sweet and floral. He came to a stop near a giant tree with expansive branches that twisted as though alive—which was insane. Except it wasn’t, not compared to what happened next.
Falling.
I stop for coffee on my way downtown—Kreacher’s coffee is too watery, but I’ll be damned if I admit it to his face—and make it to my desk just as the cuckoo-clock chirps. Robards briefs us on the day’s assignment and pairs me with Malfoy. Again. I think he does it on purpose. He’s either got a sick sense of humour, or he enjoys the drama.
Harry props himself up on one elbow. “It’ll be bloody freezing.”
Draco gasped.
Harry’s chest rose and fell. He remained unconscious but had gained a healthy tint to his cheeks. Hermione cast a round of diagnostic spells.
Of course, Robards chooses that moment to come back to his office. He takes one look at us, rolls his eyes, and sends us straight to the Third Floor of St Mungo’s:
“His invisibility cloak?”
Since then, Petunia had completely overhauled his wardrobe. He wondered if he had lost weight because all his old clothing was so big and fit poorly. Well, whatever the reason, he now had plenty to choose from, including jeans, trousers, button-downs, t-shirts, and hoodies. He laid out his outfit for the day: an emerald shirt and a smart pair of charcoal trousers.
Hermione’s hand shook, and so did the room. Draco placed his hand on hers. Together, they concentrated, bringing Harry’s magic closer to the rift. The buzzing amplified, ringing unbearably like the wards of Privet Drive.
Third, he used to have a cat, hence the cat flap on his bedroom door. Apparently Fluffy, who sadly died last year, was fiercely protective of Harry and would scratch and meow at the door until let in. Vernon had relented and installed a cat flap. This whole scenario surprised Harry—he felt more like a dog person. He’d love a big, shaggy, black dog who would jump up and lick his face.
“And how do you propose to do that?”
* * *
“Granger,” he said, and held out the bottle.
Swirls of carmine came next, pulsing and radiating.
Harry groaned. “There are so many places left to see.”
Harry needs to calm down, to do something to counteract his arousal. He purposely looks at Malfoy’s left arm with the Dark Mark prominently on display. The Muggles probably think it’s a cool biker tatt, not the brand that it really is. Malfoy has it glamoured so a wreath of holly surrounds the skull and snake. How very festive. Malfoy’s part in the war still nags at Harry’s conscience, but not enough to interfere with his desire.
The teacher makes her way around the room, passing out the handouts and offering praise and helpful hints to each student. She lavishes compliments on Hermione for her spot-on sense of proportion and realism. She praises Harry too, says his drawing shows a Picasso influence. Harry knows enough about art to know it’s not a compliment.
As Draco approached the house, with its neatly manicured lawn and perfect hedges, his skin tingled. It was subtle, and at first he took no notice. But as he strode closer, the prickly sensation amplified to searing pain, and the Dark Mark throbbed intensely.
The pebbles kept coming, one after another. Harry staggered to the window and couldn’t believe it—Draco was in the backyard. He stood in the bushes, with a pinched expression on his face, and Harry’s heart swelled. He wished he could touch him. But just to see his face, it was enough.
The light caught in Potter’s eyes, making them seem brighter and greener than should be possible. Potter leaned forward and gently pressed his lips to Draco’s. The kiss was chaste, but it set Draco’s world on fire. He knew he must be tripping, flying high as a technicolour aeroplane, because there was no way this could be real.
When he pulled back, Harry said, “Why does this feel like goodbye?”
“Harder,” he gasps. “Harry… I need more.”
Disappointment flooded Harry’s chest. He sighed and opened the bottle, brought it to his nose and sniffed. It was odourless and looked like water. But he knew it couldn’t be. He guessed the bottle must be Dudley’s. What was inside?
No such thing as magic… Everything would be so much simpler if that were the case. Vernon would still be alive. My sweetums would still be home. We’d still be happy.
Malfoy leans back in and slips a piece of paper into Harry’s hand. “You get invited back to mine for drinks. Come to this address at eight o’clock tonight. Don’t be late, Potter.” He pulls back, his silver eyes darkened to gunmetal grey. “You’re already on the Naughty List, I’d hate to have to punish you further.”
Whatever it was, it was a problem to be solved later. More pressing was the matter of Harry’s magic—there was little left to drain. But Draco had an idea.
Draco stowed his wand into the drawer of his bedside table, curled up around Harry, and drifted off into an exhausted sleep.
This seemed to placate Petunia; her expression softened, and her shoulders relaxed.
” Draco shouted. He hurriedly checked Harry for a pulse—there wasn’t one. Draco’s mind and body worked automatically, recalling the techniques he’d recently read about. He administered thirty chest compressions, then tilted Harry’s head back and delivered two powerful breaths. Thirty more chest compressions, two more breaths.
“What’s wrong, Harry? I feel as though you’re physically here with me, but your mind is somewhere else entirely.”
One by one, Harry pulls each item from the box—the green jersey with lucky number
Petunia told Harry the reason she hadn’t spoken about his mother was because she didn’t want to speak ill of her. She was Harry’s mother, but she was wicked. She had an evil streak living inside her, and Petunia had hoped to save her, but she couldn’t be saved. Overcome by her wickedness, she had married someone just as corrupted. Perhaps it was for the best that he’d been raised by the Dursleys. Petunia was so kind, catering to his needs, and the stories she told him about Vernon and Dudley always brought a smile to his lips. It was just too bad he couldn’t remember them. Harry felt terrible for betraying her trust and had vowed never to go searching in her room again. She had smiled, patted his arm, and told him in the future to come to her. That she’d tell him anything he wanted to know.
Then you look back down at your son, who looks up at you, positively beaming.
But Harry didn’t find out what he needed to do. Everything faded to black.
Satisfied, she nodded and loosened the grip on her wand—a wand that looked peculiar in her hand, yet strangely familiar.
Malfoy raises an eyebrow. “Candy canes are for good little boys and girls.”
“Nice try, Potter.” Draco sends the wine and glasses back to the kitchen. “We’re still going.” He gets re-dressed — Harry reluctantly follows his lead — and casts an Ironing Charm over them both. He frowns. “We’d better change.”
Harry let out a shaky laugh.
Harry skates closer and puts his hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Hello, Narcissa. Everything is as it should be. We’re delighted you’ll join us.”
will love this. Shame washes over him, but he swallows and boldly looks at Malfoy. “What happens when you’re on Santa’s Naughty List?”
Draco pulls back, and the look on his face is one Harry’s never seen before. “Do you really mean that?”
“I have another question for you. How did you end up with Harry’s wand? He took mine from the Manor. I always assumed his had been lost or broken.”
Harry paced the room. He lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. He paced the room some more. He banged at the door.
She took a long sip and closed her eyes. “There were traces of your magic mingled in with Harry’s. I felt it.”
Venom dripped down its pincers, menacing as they grew closer. Harry’s heart thudded in his chest as he tried to back up, but his feet remained rooted to the spot. The monstrous spider exhaled against Harry’s face; a putrid odour wafting from its cavernous maw—the remains of its last meal. Scuttling sounds came from all directions as more spiders closed in.
Apparently, Draco agreed—his clothing and Harry’s apron vanished. Draco nibbled along Harry’s jaw, and Harry inhaled deeply, savouring the familiar scent—honeysuckle and lavender—a heady combination of Draco’s magic and the Muggle hair care products he favoured.
He groaned, rubbing his forehead.
Surprisingly, Draco got along well with Ron and the rest of the Weasleys. Harry couldn’t keep his existence a secret from them, and they all promised to keep quiet.
“Not your fault.”
Petunia said he used to sleepwalk. Had he fallen asleep and taken the train? Harry ran his shaky hands through his hair and looked down at his rumpled bedclothes. A drop of blood landed on his wrist. He touched his nose; his fingers came away bloody. He was a mess—he couldn’t let Draco see him like this.
“Here, I’ve a pain potion for you,” Hermione said. “Drink it, you’ll feel better.”
A loud
They change, Draco straightens Harry’s tie, smooths down his hair, and glamours a love bite. “I liked you better in the other outfit, but this will have to do.”
The next day, Robards calls him down to the DMLE basement, to the morgue. Draco’s body washed ashore that morning, far too late to get a magical signature. Draco had listed Harry as his next of kin, so he’s called in to identify the body.
a lightning bolt scar—he knew it must be.
“I insist. I’d like to meet your new friend.”
, he wrote. He was a smoker. Obviously. He took another drag and relaxed as he exhaled. It made sense and certainly explained the smoky feeling in his lungs that first morning. And his hand… His restless hand, always reaching for something. Petunia said idle hands were the devil’s tool. So, he kept busy. Gardening, reading, helping his aunt around the house, and smoking… always smoking.
Draco gazed at Harry, drinking him in, like he was trying to memorise him. His eyes lingered on Harry’s lips, which gave Harry a boost of courage. “Look. I’m probably doing this all wrong. But you seem like someone I’d like to get to know better. Would you like to meet up sometime?”
Draco straightened. “Well, tonight, the current master and its two previous masters require its assistance—for the greater good. We can save him, Hermione. Together.”
, then staggers backwards, banging his knee against a chair. He vomits into the bin. Twice. Robards gives him the rest of the week off.
Harry stayed awake for hours, floating among the colours, but at some point, he drifted off to sleep. It was the best sleep he could remember having.
Potter laughed. “No.”
“Draco, you and I are about to sit down to dinner. Don’t you think we can move on to first names?” With a grin, she accepted the bottle.
“Get up, get dressed.”
Draco exhaled quietly. “No, that’s not it.” He placed a tender kiss on Harry’s forehead. “That was incredible. I definitely want to do that again. And soon.”
“I’ll make it up to you.”
Draco sat back down and took a sip of tea. He found it fascinating how Muggles could revive a person without magic; bring them back from the dead. He’d been taught to fear Muggles, to treat them as subservient, but they had this amazing physical... magic, for lack of a better word. That they could manipulate the human body and save a life was nothing short of miraculous. They called it the
She passed the paper through, and as she did, Harry felt a hand caress his backside, fingers dipping into the crevice. He struggled to maintain an even expression as he accepted the paper through the flames.
The truth is, I can’t stand an empty house.
Draco glanced at the clock—it was 9 am. Maybe he could reach Little Whinging before Harry? He didn’t want Harry out of his sight, not after what he’d discovered. Harry was vulnerable—a single drop of LSD could be his undoing. Draco had given Harry just enough of a boost to sustain him; he couldn’t afford to squander it. If Harry got curious or impatient to restore his memory, he could die. Again. And maybe this time it would stick.
Draco narrows his eyes. “You honestly don’t want me to answer that right now.”
“I’m sorry. I should have told you sooner. I shouldn’t have taken advantage...” Draco stood abruptly and backed away from the table, from Harry—no
The memory of slugs and ants remained fresh in his mind, and as he lay in bed, his arms and legs tingled as though pricked with tiny needles. He didn’t feel entirely in his body, but an overwhelming sense of despair kept him tethered to reality. And thirst—he was so very thirsty. Harry’s eyes darted around the room, and the furniture swayed, then steadied. He closed his eyes and tried to go back to sleep.
over them both and Harry summons a bottle of wine, two glasses, and tries to manoeuvre Draco towards the bed for round two.
“You like this, don’t you?”
Draco had hoped the memories might settle and the ones he’d created as
Harry blinked. His heart raced, and for the briefest of moments, his forehead throbbed. But just as quickly, the menacing figure before him shifted again, sprouting long, greasy hair, a hooked nose, and eyes as black as the night sky. Relief surged through Harry’s body, but swiftly turned to annoyance as the man looked down his curved nose at Harry.
Of course, she was right. Muggles and their amusing take on witches and wizards.
Harry passed him the money. When their hands brushed, an electric jolt pulsed through Harry. When Harry looked into Draco’s eyes, he was certain he’d felt it too.
“You knew about that?”
Draco looked over at Hermione, her face set halfway between astonishment and indignation.
Harry kissed him thoroughly, then whispered in his ear, “Where’s your lube?”
They have a beautiful daughter around Harry’s age. Lianne is virtuous and attends Mass every Sunday. Her blouses are always buttoned up to the collar, and her skirts fall well below the knee. If I’d have had a daughter, I’d have wanted her to be just like Lianne. She’s just the sort I’d have chosen for Dudders.
It was straight-up whisky.
“Close the door, Ron.”
is concerned. The journey to the cliff’s edge doesn’t take long. He’s been to this spot countless times; it’s where he first found Draco, brooding after the war. It’s where they shook hands, became friends, and then more. The wind blows through Harry’s cloak and tousles his hair. His teeth chatter, but he doesn’t cast a Warming Charm. Because he doesn’t deserve it.
. He’s filled out over the years, a side-effect of happiness, the stability of marriage, and perhaps too many late-night stakeouts with Ron accompanied by a box of jelly rolls to help pass the time. He surveys his profile—he’s greying at the temples, and there are fine lines at the corners of his eyes and mouth, put there by laughter with his husband and friends, by life well-lived.
Harry leaned in and whispered, “Who is she? Why are we here?” But before Draco could respond, Harry paled. Sweat broke out along his brow, and Draco’s skin prickled with the faint buzzing of magic—what little there was left. Harry’s legs buckled, and Draco grabbed hold of him so he didn’t fall.
Draco’s fascination with Muggle medicine continued. Every day he immersed himself in human anatomy, diagnostic techniques, and the modern advances made available through
With each day that passed, Harry noticed that Petunia became increasingly restless. She had difficulty sleeping and was plagued by nightmares. Harry could sympathise—dreams of the vortex had become a near-nightly occurrence. By day he felt drowsy.
Harry stood, but stopped dead in his tracks when he saw his desk. Papers. Pages upon pages, scattered, all filled with the repeated lines:
Petunia filled a plate to the point of overflowing with scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, beans, and toast. “A growing boy needs his sustenance,” she mused.
Harry grimaced. “What happened?”
Harry sits with his arms defiantly crossed.
Petunia ignored him.
The more Draco thought about it, the more concerned he became. It didn’t seem to have any outward effect other than allowing him to scratch the surface of his lost memories. But that couldn’t be all, and what Draco didn’t understand worried him.
Narcissa waves back, then returns her attention to Draco. “Shall I still come at 6 o’clock? Or do you perhaps need to reschedule?” She gives Draco a pointed stare that freezes him on the spot, her gaze colder than the surroundings. Draco stands still, horrified, burdened by the heavy weight of expectation.
Hermione put her hand on Draco’s arm. “You did what you had to do. You stayed alive. Then you left. Now, look at you.”
When would it end? Harry was too accommodating for his own good.
“How?”
. Harry thought about Hermione and Ron, how they had always stood by him. He saw their faces, firm and unyielding, when they told him they were coming with him, that they wouldn’t let him hunt Horcruxes alone. He saw them now, Hermione’s arm wrapped around Ron’s shoulder as they knelt by Fred’s body, surrounded by the rest of the Weasleys. They were home—all of them.
Draco was determined not to waste Potter’s sacrifice.
who flaunted their abnormality around willy-nilly. It was one thing to suffer their presence—their interference. But it was completely too much when Diddy became friendly with them. The Strumpet. Dudley said she was all right.
“Morning,” Draco said, instead.
, grew inside him until it was overwhelming. He didn’t know if he could spend the rest of his life with the knowledge of what might have been.
Harry smiled, and Draco kissed him soundly on the mouth. Maybe everything would be all right after all?
“Err,” I reply.
The bed rocked violently and ozone filled the air. The overhead light exploded, raining down glass, and Hermione cast a hasty
“Voldemort may have been using it, but it was never his. I’ve thought about this.” She straightened. “The wand belonged to Professor Dumbledore. Harry told me you disarmed Dumbledore on the Astronomy Tower, so the wand became yours.”
Draco sat down with a cup of tea and his copy of
They rolled down the windows, and the wind swept through, messing up Harry’s hair so he looked more like the Potter from Draco’s school days, sending a surge of arousal through Draco. They soon arrived at one of Draco’s favourite spots and parked along the side of the road. They both got out; Harry stretched, and Draco admired the view. They walked along a narrow pathway, so close their shoulders bumped and their fingers brushed. Harry didn’t seem to mind, and before Draco could overthink it, he took Harry’s hand in his. Harry turned to look at Draco, and he immediately panicked. Fear flooded his insides—had he misread the situation? But a moment later, Harry grinned and squeezed his hand. They held hands as they walked until they reached a clearing beside a pond.
together?”
Harry moaned loudly as Draco swiped his thumb over the slit, and another firm stroke had Harry’s hips bucking upward, seeking the warmth of Draco’s fist. Three more firm strokes and Harry shuddered and climaxed. Harry’s hand gripped tighter—Draco couldn’t hold back any longer; he came with a shudder, panting and mouthing kisses against Harry’s neck.
Lenny said it should kick in straight away, but it didn’t. Harry looked down at his hands; they trembled. He willed them to keep steady, but they wouldn’t cooperate—he needed a cigarette. But as he reached for his pack, he felt a tingling sensation in his fingers. The hairs stood on the back of his arms. The lights flickered, and Harry felt a rhythmic, pulsing sensation throughout his body. A flash of fear flooded through him, followed by a sharp jolt.
Harry reached out and pulled Draco down for a warm embrace. “You had a bad trip, love. I’m sorry about that. I’ve mostly had positive experiences.”
Harry cringes when he sees Bellatrix’s menacing picture on the opposite side of the tree. Draco frowns and turns the photo around. He ushers Harry out, down the hallway, and into the main entrance with the double staircase.
. His relationship with Harry would be over faster than you could mutter
She purses her lips and eyes him carefully. “Lovely. Carry on then.” The green flames flicker out.
Why couldn’t he remember anything? He pounded the floor in frustration—a strange, hollow sound made him pause. He ran his fingers over the smooth oak planks, then dipped his nails into the surrounding groove, surprised with the ease at which he could prise them up. A surge of excitement flooded his veins. Maybe it contained a clue to his former self. Maybe this would be the key that unlocked his memories.
In another life, one in which Potter would never consent to being alone in the wilderness with Draco, he would have Summoned the picnic basket from the car. Instead, he said, “Wait here,” and left a very confused Harry beside the water.
Lenny was in an interesting sort, not much older than Harry. He was charismatic, and easily dispelled Harry’s worries, both qualities surely an asset in his line of work.
Harry closed the oven door and began to tidy, whistling as he did the washing up. It was a beautiful kitchen, spacious and clean, by far his favourite room in their flat—aside from the bedroom. He’d been forced to cook as a child, and not allowed to cook when he’d served as Dudley’s replacement. This was the first time in Harry’s life he was finally free to do as he pleased, and it pleased him very much to try something new each day. He spent hours creating sumptuous entrees, delectable puddings, and even spicy owl treats for Artemis. Today, it was cranberry orange scones.
“Petunia!”
sign on the lawn.
“Lunch, sweetums. Eat up, it will help you feel better. You need to regain your strength.”
Harry woke up with the bottle of LSD in his hand. His mouth was desert-dry and his body ached all over. He slowly opened his eyes and groaned—the sunlight was way too bright. But he forgot all about his discomfort when he noticed his other hand. On the back was written the words:
Hermione gasped, and Draco felt an electric rippling, the exotic pull of Harry’s magic as it siphoned through the Elder Wand, through his arms, his body, and into the room. Draco’s entire body pulsed; the lights flickered. Mesmerised, he watched as a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours filled the room: currant and ruby, marigold and amber, daffodil and fire opal, fern and emerald, spruce and lapis, lavender and amethyst. Draco watched in awe as the colours swirled and danced. This was the essence of Harry, stupendous and enchanting. This was why he loved this man—had always loved him.
He kept himself busy. He immersed himself in healing books, both magical and Muggle, and cleaned his flat from top to bottom twice over—every corner, nook and cranny shone. But he couldn’t cleanse the horrible feeling that grew in the pit of his stomach. As days turned into weeks, Draco resigned himself to the fact that Potter might never remember.
Anger jolted through Draco—had she just called him a freak?—but her statement snapped him back to reality like a Stinging Jinx. She knew who he was and could ruin everything. His mind swirled. It made sense that she would be angry and have a hatred towards wizards. They’d used Harry, treated him as nothing more than a pawn in their war. Of course his aunt would be suspicious and protective.
What a bloody waste of time and money. I won’t go back.
“I’m wearing pants,” Harry lied. “It gets hot in the kitchen.”
, that’s Hermione’s advice. I comply because either way, I win. Either he’ll be nicer to me, or I’ll finally be rid of him.
I don’t think I mind that Harry is so inclined. Vernon, God rest his soul, wouldn’t have stood for it. But I’d like to think I’m more open-minded. I can deal with it, so long as there’s no
The wardrobe burst open, and a small rectangular box bearing the name
. Draco reached the top, and despite his precarious balance, tried to pull the bars loose. They were securely bolted to the brick.
"w-what? Then why were you scowling at me today?"
when he entered the bar though, his mood made a 180 degree. he was ready to dance his ass off.
draco didn't even notice harry come up behind him and now he was being pulled to the dance floor, all the while the only thing he could think of was harry holding his hand, he didn't know why but his first thought was to intertwin his fingers with harry's. as soon as he did that harry stopped and turned to him. draco sweared his heartbeat was louder than the dj but harry smiled and leant forward and pecked his lips. draco was still recovering from the shock of harry holding his hand and now a kiss?!! "oh shit, you didn't like it? oh my god i am so sorry. it's just i you looked so cute when we met and with you being flustered i was gushing over how cute you are! and that bartender flirting with you! that was - mmph" suddenly draco's mouth was over harry's and he was kissing him so passionately while one hand was caressing his cheek and the other was in his hair at the back of his neck. harry pulled draco closer to him.
Harry’s eyes sprang open, but he did as he was told. After he’d dried his mouth with the back of his hand, he said, “That’s… amazing. What else can you do?”
Dejected, Harry went back to sleep. At some point, the cat flap opened, and Petunia pushed a plate through. But he couldn’t be bothered to get up, so it sat next to the other uneaten meals.
She nodded.
Draco heard pounding in the background and muffled shouting.
Fire flashes in grey eyes. A challenge. He shoves Harry’s broom into his arms.
. It didn’t say ‘♡H’.
“But it seems there was one more Horcrux we hadn’t counted on.” She got up and left the room. When she returned, she had Harry’s mokeskin pouch in hand. She pulled out a note, one she hadn’t shown him before. She let Draco hold it, and he instantly recognised Harry’s messy handwriting.
The ghost of Harry Potter haunted Draco like it had done before when he’d thought him dead. But it was worse now because Draco knew what it was like to love and be loved by him. Because Potter was alive and wanted nothing to do with him. Because Draco felt Harry’s presence everywhere he went.
“What would happen if I boarded the train? Where would it take me?”
Cautiously, Harry peered into the living room and inhaled the musty scent of alcohol, cigarettes, and dust. He instantly relaxed, his shoulders releasing the tension they’d been holding when he saw it wasn’t a burglar. A middle-aged woman, petite and bony, with a long neck and short hair, stood by the fireplace with her back to Harry. Was this his mother? Her knuckles became white against the mantlepiece as she examined the row of family photos. When she raised her hand, Harry flinched—he didn’t know why. He watched her with intense scrutiny, wondering whether she meant to shove the photos or lash out in some other way.
Once the charm was in place, the room was cast in tones of sepia. Hermione held Harry’s wand in her left hand, the Elder Wand in her right. She glanced at Draco, then removed the Stasis Charm.
Potter blinked, stunned. “No, Draco. You don’t understand. I remember everything.”
“Harry!”
“Great,” Harry said, and smiled. He reached over the counter and grabbed a piece of paper and a biro. “Here’s my number. Call me. Soon.”
Draco smirked and casually looked up. Grey eyes met green, and Draco almost dropped the stack of cups. A sharp and familiar sensation, equal parts arousal and irritation, jolted through his body.
“Or maybe someone you hated with a passion.”
Draco ached inside. The hurt, the absence of
Draco kissed Harry’s lips gently, basking in the afterglow. He couldn’t tell him the truth. Not now. Maybe never. This was everything he had ever wanked over, and he wanted more. Sex with Harry was like a drug, one taste, and he was addicted. Instead of coming clean and telling the truth, he agreed to another date.
Harry takes your hand, puts a protective arm around you and guides you to the Floo. You don’t know why he’s doing this. Harry is just a shag — a bloody fantastic shag — but nothing more. This is not a relationship; you both made that perfectly clear right at the start. When you call out your address, he stops you and takes you back to his, back to Grimmauld Place. But there are so many things you must do. People to notify. Arrangements to make. Lawyers to call. The funeral home. The list is endless.
Harry runs his fingers through Draco’s hair, tucks a damp strand behind his ear. He nods. “All right. But I expect to come back here afterwards to warm up.”
… eighteen… nineteen… twenty.
Had he become frustrated and given up? Was he using LSD again? Was that why Harry kept cancelling their dates?
. He bows at Draco’s feet, then turns to the ice-encrusted table and busies himself with adding place settings and festive decorations. He snaps his fingers and snow falls in large, fluffy flakes all around them, and yet somehow the air feels pleasantly warm. It’s like being inside a snow globe.
Harry didn’t know what to say to that. Petunia continued to glower, but the intensity was undermined as she swayed and continued to cling to the chair. Harry realised she was three sheets to the wind. From her dishevelled appearance, Harry suspected this wasn’t the first time. He gestured to the fireplace, to the shards of glass scattered along the floor.
Harry was in the forest again, with the
“I’m fine. I can take care of myself.” Potter shifted from foot to foot and looked uncomfortable, as though he had something to say but didn’t know how to go about it. The awkwardness between them was stifling.
Harry felt as though he was walking along a precipice, steep on both sides, struggling to remain carefully balanced. It was difficult to keep his dream world—the one he could only reach through LSD, the one that felt so real to him no matter how improbable—separate from the real one. Harry blinked—the leaves sparkled like diamonds. He blinked again. They were bathed in moonlight and nothing more. Harry trembled. Was he losing his mind?
I always wake up sweaty and thirsty, my heart racing.
He’d thought it strange at the time, that she wouldn’t just hand it to him. But now it made sense.
No one else gets to see perfect, proper Draco Malfoy this way. Hot and bothered. Completely undone. Only Harry.
Draco cringed. His sleeve had ridden up enough to expose the lower part of the Dark Mark.
“It wasn’t. I was a coward. I should have healed them. I should have helped them escape. But I kept my head down and did the bare minimum.”
I despise Draco Malfoy. He’s ruining my darling Harry. Even without
“Well, you were so quiet the entire way back. I thought—”
We stand outside
Draco took a moment longer to bask in the grandeur, the total chaos of Harry’s magic as it swirled around him, powerful and intoxicating.
“Thank you, Harry. Ron will be by soon.” She tucked a loose strand behind her ear. “He’s still sore you beat him at chess, Draco,” she called out.
Reluctantly, Harry rises. “I’ll go put these back. Meet me in the kitchen and we’ll make dinner, yeah?”
“It brings back bad memories. I should have it covered.”
Harry’s eyes narrowed and his jaw clenched. He was sick of all these people asking him the same inane question, but equally annoyed with not having any answers.
“You don’t know how much that means to me. I’d love to… at some point in the future. But I can’t leave my aunt right now. She’s in a fragile state, and she needs me. I can’t leave. Not yet, anyway.”
Hermione’s eyes sprang open and she looked at Draco so earnestly he stopped talking.
Except it wasn’t okay.
“Now look at me,” he muttered.
Hermione removed her feet from Draco’s lap. She sat up. “Draco, I don’t know if this is such a good idea. I haven’t told anyone about it.” She sighed. “In fact, I haven’t talked about it much since then. Other than with you.”
Just as quickly, Draco pulls away and beckons Harry to follow. Harry complies, trotting down the hallway in pursuit.
Draco yawned, then took a much-needed sip of tea. The crisp bergamot flavour roused him. Instead of going to bed after his shift, he’d stayed up into the wee hours studying.
Reality came crashing down around Draco Malfoy in the form of a natural disaster called Harry Potter. He’d always turned Draco’s world upside down—set it on fire, distorted reality, unleashed chaos—ever since the day they’d first met.
The front door opened and Draco sat up straight, ready to be of assistance. But it was only Kirk, sweeping. Draco sighed and tried to bring his thoughts back to the present. He flipped through the pages of
“Nothing, I”—he needed to cover, had to keep up pretences—“I just can’t get enough of you.” He lowered his hands to Draco’s trousers and went to unzip them. Draco stopped him.
Now, I’m no prude. I once had a thing going with Sir Cadogan, after all. Of course, he now spends all his spare time with that milkmaid. Not that I’m bitter.
Harry sat on the floor, his back against the bed. He
their alarm. Why did Harry let him sleep in so late? There’s so much to do.
shook the walls... Draco’s eyes darted to the window. Artemis appeared behind the windowpane; eyes fixed on Draco. The glass glowed—vibrant, searing white—then wavered. In the blink of an eye, the glass vanished. Draco’s wand slipped from his hand and clattered to the ground. Majestically, Artemis flew through the open window, and once she’d passed through, the glass reformed.
Malfoy leans in and a shiver travels down Harry’s spine as he whispers into Harry’s ear. “I wasn’t cold, I was preoccupied. You made it exceedingly difficult to focus. I rarely resort to Legilimency, but you were broadcasting your thoughts so loudly I couldn’t help myself. I’ll have you know, every single one of your thoughts, all those things you wanted to do, were positively filthy. You most definitely are on Santa’s Naughty List.”
She clutched a book in her talons.
boring—and then into Viridian Vindictus’ portrait. I tell him to shove over and make room. He leaves in a strop, instead.
Harry moves closer and the first ornament he sees features a tall witch with Draco’s fine platinum locks, a hooked nose, and a constant scowl reminiscent of Lucius. She turns her nose up at Harry. Well, she wouldn’t be the first Malfoy to disapprove. To Harry’s surprise, there is a picture of Sirius. He’s younger than when Harry knew him, his hair longer, and he looks less weighed down upon. He winks and Harry feels a moment of longing. He really wishes his godfather could be at their wedding.
“He must have been under the cloak because I never saw him. He slipped the note, the pouch, and your wand into my bag. Must have done it when I was consoling Ron. Fred had just been killed, and we were all so distraught.” She took a moment before she continued. “I wish he would have told me what he planned to do. We would have found another way. I would have stopped him. But he willingly sacrificed himself to save us all.” She huffed a wry little laugh. “It’s such a
He stiffened. “It was to be expected.” He gestured to his notes. “I’ll leave my research with you. Perhaps the procedure we used tonight might be of use with your parents.” He headed for the door, then looked back. “Take care of him. Please.”
“I just thought… You said you loved me. I thought you’d want to. But if you don’t—”
Come off it, Potter,’
No bottle. No card.
There was no simple way to ask her, so he just dove in. In for a Knut, in for a Galleon.
When Draco finally felt calmer, more centred, he cast diagnostic spells—the ones he’d seen Madam Pomfrey use countless times in the hospital wing. The ones he’d used on the prisoners inside the Malfoy dungeons…
“It takes hard work to make something of yourself. I’ll help you.” She sounded as though she was doing him a favour.
“Yes. Mother grows them in her garden.”
“They forced me to torture people. Muggles and Muggle sympathisers. There was a family, and they lived in a tiny stone shack. I tortured the parents. They wouldn’t tell us anything. To be honest, I don’t think they had the answers the Dark Lord sought. When they didn’t comply, I was given orders to torture their child. She was so young, not quite old enough to go to Hogwarts.” He looked up at Hermione, her eyes filled with horror.
With a relaxed sigh, he entered the foyer. Harry was still holding his hand, and just like at the cinema he could feel Harry’s magic, present but muted. Having realised he was still holding Draco’s hand, Harry blushed and let go.
The sky opened and large snowflakes fluttered down to the ground like feathers. Harry and Draco quickly wrapped themselves up in towels, shivering as they made their way back to their cabin. Large stormy waves crashed into the beach and the snowfall increased rapidly until it was a full-on blizzard. In the distance, the wards flickered and flashed, then fizzled as they failed. Dozens of Lethifolds swarmed in, shrouds of death coming in for the kill.
“He would have died if I hadn’t. You don’t understand—”
“WHO are you?”
Harry Potter wouldn’t be pouring Draco Malfoy tea.
Many times, Harry opened Draco’s meditation book and sat down with intention. He attempted to empty his mind—through willpower, determination, and then desperation—but his thoughts continued to swirl and consume. The more he tried to relax, the less he could.
“I may have flashed my badge” — he’s blushing now — “and being the Saviour has its perks. Don’t worry, they gave me a magical signature test to make sure it really was me and not some Polyjuiced imposter.”
“You didn’t, did you?” Draco’s expression was more amused than upset. “Even the picture shows a Lethifold next to the lighthouse.”
Harry runs a hand along the inseam, revelling in the suppleness, remembering the soft slide of leather against his skin. But his nostalgia quickly washes away, replaced by rapidly growing panic. It’s been fifteen years since he’s worn the uniform, five since he last put it on, when an undercover mission had been unexpectedly extended and he’d missed Draco’s birthday. It took substantial grovelling—and
They sat at the table across the width, rather than at either end.
Draco laid out his papers on the table—the spell, the note to himself—and took three deep breaths. He sipped his tea. If he was lucky, it would still be warm when the procedure was complete.
Bringing a witch into Harry’s life would definitely be classified as
But Harry is such a good boy. I’d gotten a tad emotional following that ghastly letter, which is not Dudley’s fault, he’s clearly not of sound mind. Harry cancelled his plans with the Malfoy boy and spent the day consoling me. He sat with me while I made lunch, even offered to cook, but I shooed him away. It’s nice to be needed. Later, he accompanied me to the garden centre to buy new flowers. He planted them for me along the front walkway.
The old man in the silver cloak reappeared, but taller than before. His nostrils flared; he fixed Harry with an intense stare, fire flashing in his blue eyes.
was interesting news, but Harry found it hard to focus because Draco’s hand had made a slow descent down Harry’s crack and was now gently massaging his entrance, still pleasantly sore from the night before.
.” He holds them out for Draco, who looks at them but doesn’t take them. Harry smiles his bright, intoxicating smile and says, “Come on love. Where’s your sense of adventure? Live a little. Be a kid again.”
Malfoy is stunning. Statuesque. He should be on display, in a gallery or a museum, where the masses can congregate and pay homage to his sculpted form. Harry lets his eyes wander over every inch of perfect, alabaster skin. Malfoy’s outfit, if you can call it that, leaves little to the imagination. He’s wearing the most delectable pair of Santa underwear. The black elastic, edged with tufts of white faux fur, has a shiny gold buckle in the center; the fabric, red velvet, is so tiny it barely covers him. Harry’s eyes trace the obvious outline of Malfoy’s cock; soft, but definitely there, and most impressive.
“Have I caught you at a bad time?” Draco asked.
“Not right now. I’m concerned about you. Something is going on. Please tell me.”
My cheeks burn. Why does Malfoy always have to be so pompous and difficult? I need some air. I try to step back, only to find out I can’t. I’m unable to move at all. My hand remains attached to Malfoy’s wrist, as though held in place by a Sticking Charm (or industrial-strength Muggle glue), and the inside of my left foot is stuck to the outside of Malfoy’s right foot. It’s not just our shoes—somehow our feet are fused together through the rubber and leather.
“I want that too.”
“Draco, is that you?” Hermione called out. “You said I would be angry. What have you—”
Draco nodded.
He reaches into his pocket, and with a nonverbal spell restores his gifts to their proper size. “I brought you some flowers, and those chocolates you like so much.” His voice only wavers slightly. He holds them out, then lets them slip through his fingers into the darkness below, just like Draco all those years ago. The wind and the waves are loud; he doesn’t hear them land.
Harry’s eyes sprang open. The lights flickered violently.
She smiled in return. “Draco.”
02 April 1998
, reading about various imaging techniques. The doctors had declared Harry healthy, yet his headaches persisted, right in the spot where his scar should be. The more Draco thought about it, the more he wanted a second opinion.
“Mmm-hmmm,” was all Draco could manage amid the sensory overload. Every cell in Draco’s body felt attuned to Harry’s, aligned as though Harry was a magnet. It made sense; Harry had always drawn him in, like a moth to a flame. Draco’s orgasm was building fast—too fast—but there was nothing he could do to slow it down. Harry sucked Draco’s bottom lip into his mouth, gave it a gentle nip, and Draco sighed.
The man continued to stare, so Harry took a moment to really look at him. A wave of familiarity stirred inside him.
I have a feeling Harry and Malfoy are more than friends. They talk on the phone every day, sometimes multiple times. Dudders was close with his chums, but they never called to say goodnight. I can’t be certain, but I have a hunch, and my hunches are rarely wrong.
than against a mouldy stone wall.”
But Draco was better than that. No matter what else they had done together, this wouldn’t be right. As he tried to find the right words to explain himself, the look in Harry’s eyes punctured his heart—he looked completely dejected.
wasn’t so bad when you got used to it. She must have bewitched my Diddy to make him say that.
A snifter filled with two fingers of his favourite 150-year-old Goblin firewhisky hovers to Draco’s right; his usual layer of magic prevents the condensation from reaching the mahogany table—Draco has
Malfoy pulls the curtains open, flooding the room with light—Harry winces.
Harry opened his journal and flipped through the pages, all filled with the repeated phrase:
,” he announces.
He looked around yearning for a tug of familiarity. None came.
Draco enjoyed studying; found it relaxing, which was a good thing as it was essential to gain entrance to a Muggle medical school. He also preferred reading to sleeping because there were still many nights when the Dark Lord would enter his dreams, his face smug, noseless, with soulless eyes that at a moment’s notice would flit between ice-cold fury and psychotic glee. The very thought sent a shiver down Draco’s spine, which he chased away with another sip of tea. He took a deep breath, counted to five, then exhaled, as instructed by his Muggle meditation books. It had been nearly three months since the bastard’s death, but sometimes it felt like yesterday.
Harry hesitantly enters the sitting room. Draco, upright and regal in a high wingback chair, faces the fireplace. It shouldn’t be possible, but he’s become more handsome and distinguished with age—his pointy features now chiselled, eyes a deeper shade of slate, and minimal grey hair gleaming like liquid silver among his platinum locks. He favours smart, tailored suits, well-suited to his slender frame, and could probably still fit into his old Hogwarts uniform if he tried. Harry swallows down his mounting dread that Draco won’t find him attractive anymore.
After an enjoyable day, which included taking in an exhibit at the British Museum, a walk along the Thames, and a shared Knickerbocker Glory, they were driving through Knightsbridge when Petunia said, “It’s still early. Would you like to see a film?”
Draco also came to realise there were many possibilities where Muggle medicine and wizarding healing arts could be combined. In Harry’s absence—which he tried in vain not to worry about—he’d spent many an evening discussing the ins and outs of his theories with Hermione. He appreciated her intelligence and wit; it was such a pity they hadn’t become friends sooner.
“This might be a good option for you. After I left home, I began a daily meditation practice to help me relax and to help manage the nightmares. But I’ve also read that meditation can enhance dream recollection and assist with recovering lost memories.”
The tree blends in with the décor so well that Harry doesn’t see it at first. But once he does, he can’t unsee it. Like the room, it’s decked out in varying hues of lavender, aubergine, plum; covered in ribbons, garlands, and baubles. So much purple.
“You’ll be fine, Harry.”
Draco arrived at Queen Mary’s Rose Garden. He’d planned to ambush Granger—make her tell him the truth—but he softened when he caught sight of her. Granger looked like Hades warmed up; like she’d gone ten rounds with a vexed Hippogriff. Her eyes were dark, as though she hadn’t slept properly in months, her hair untamed, and her clothing ill-thought-out. Draco had heard the healer training program could be exhausting, but this was something else. Granger did not have the appearance of a smug witch who’d gotten away with a masterful charade. He approached her gingerly.
in the family.
“I’m serious, Harry.”
Harry and Draco decided early on it was best to start fresh. Their flat was in a Muggle neighbourhood, but it combined the best of wizarding and Muggle technology. Draco had the perfect study into which he disappeared for hours at a time to conduct his research. They travelled frequently and extensively—never to the same place twice.
He aimed the wand at Harry’s chest.
“It’s not an imposition.”
It had to work.
They head to the kitchen, and Harry stalls in front of the Floo, one hand on either side like a Kneazle trying to avoid a trip to the vet. He can count on one hand the number of times he’s been to the Manor; none of the experiences have been pleasant.
“What about the Canary Islands? Or Tuscany? Machu Picchu?” Draco punctuated each suggestion with a kiss, then nipped Harry’s earlobe.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Is that what they’re calling it now?”
He brings his hand, the one not fused to mine, down to the small of my back, and he leans in closer. His day-old stubble rubs against my cheek and involuntarily I tremble. He pulls back and looks at me—really looks at me—and the bastard’s lip curls into a smirk.
“That was intense,” Harry said when he could speak again. Draco grabbed a napkin from the picnic basket and cleaned them up. Not as tidy as a Scourgify but just as effective.
Harry watches his lips move, and although he can’t hear him, he knows exactly what he’s saying. He remembers it like it was yesterday.
Draco slowly awakens and shivers. The air is chilly, and the blanket has slipped, leaving his shoulder exposed. He pulls up the covers, burrows deep within, and wonders if the window has been left open. He turns to Harry to complain. To his surprise, Harry’s not in bed. Perhaps Teddy’s had another nightmare? Overall, he’s a happy, well-adjusted kid. But he often has nightmares, which Harry assures him is perfectly natural for his age. Draco hopes he’s right. He rolls onto his back and sighs. It’s Christmas Eve day, their last day with Teddy before he goes back to Andromeda’s.
The door bursts open and a middle-aged woman, with wild hair that contrasts with her tidy peacoat, comes bursting through. “So sorry I’m late,” she exclaims. “I’m glad you’ve started without me.” She smiles at Malfoy, “Drake, always a pleasure,” then looks around the room. “I see some fresh faces and some familiar ones.” She nods at Hermione. “Everyone, be sure to get up and look at Drake from all angles. It will help with your final product.” She drops her coat onto her chair and heads for the door. “I’ll be right back, just need to photocopy the handouts.”
“I know. But you figured it out.” Potter stared into his cup as he spoke. “I’m grateful.”
“I suppose you’re happy now. You’ve come to gloat, have you? To stomp on Vernon’s grave?”
He is surprised the following Monday, when he stops by Draco’s work—a shady apothecary in Knockturn Alley, the only place willing to hire a reformed Death Eater (to prepare ingredients, not to brew)—and finds out that Draco hasn’t been to work in over a week. Harry knows how much that job means to him. With an uneasy feeling in the pit of his stomach, he Apparates to Draco’s flat. But he’s not there.
Draco pulled back to catch his breath.
The mighty Eagle owl screeched again and came to rest on the table, scattering papers to the floor. There was a note attached to her leg, poorly folded into what Draco could only assume was supposed to be a crane. His heart fluttered. Slowly, he unfolded the letter.
Soon an enormous cloud rolled overhead, blocking out the sun. But it wasn’t cause for concern. They were in the tropics; surely it would blow over.
Harry seemed disappointed, but helped Draco fold the blankets.
“I open at the close.”
Draco smirks. “See, my Patronus is better than yours.”
Harry steps closer and sees miniature Eiffel towers, Fleur-de-Lis, gilded croissants and baguettes, wine bottles, the Arc de Triomphe and the Louvre Pyramid.
“There’s one for each year and one for luck.”
Harry broke off the kiss, lips beautifully swollen and wet, eyes blown so dark only a ring of viridian remained. “I want you to fuck me,” he panted.
“Harry, sweetums. You need to eat. How can you expect to get better if you don’t eat?”
Draco looked at Hermione. “I wish we didn’t have to put them all back in.”
“Petunia, you can’t do this,” Harry grumbled as he passed his tray through the cat flap—the porridge uneaten and congealed, the teacup full.
Rage, unlike anything he’d ever felt before, bubbled inside him and pushed the pain aside. He needed it—he needed it
“What should we watch?” Hermione asked.
“How did you get in here?”
“That’s what we were doing. Searching for the Horcruxes so we could destroy them.”
“Yes.”
“What’s that?” Harry asked.
Dr Vaughn suggested instead I keep a journal and try to write about what happened. But I don’t see what good it will do.
The mermaid’s lips parted to reveal two perfect fangs. She grinned wider, revealing row upon row of sharp, jagged teeth. With great agility, she turned and lunged at the monstrous fish behind her, stretching her jaw wide and swallowing it whole.
“Kiss toe, kiss toe,” Teddy chants.
Draco sighed and grabbed another sleeve of cups. “Well, he needn’t be such an arse. I’ve no interest in women.”
Of course not. How could I? What with Snape breathing down my neck for six years, and then Slughorn practically licking my boots every time I breathed.
“Let me out!” he shouted until his voice was hoarse.
He reaches the bottom and Harry and Teddy come skating — Draco blinks his eyes, yes, they are indeed skating — out of the sitting room, with Harry, dressed in his stag robe with its antlered hood, moving swiftly backwards while holding Teddy’s hands (he’s warmly dressed in his wolf robe). They skate down the narrow hallway, Harry winks at Draco as they pass, and the pair disappear into the dining room. Teddy laughs and Harry lets out a delighted
Petunia smiled. “There’s no such thing.”
He looks at me, his stormy grey eyes boring a hole into mine. “Did you not pay attention during potions class, you numpty?”
. “Here. Drink.”
“I’ll feel better if you let me out.”
“Why don’t you sleep over at mine, and we’ll do LSD together. I want to experience what you see and feel.”
They met in the park, not far from where Harry and Draco had first gotten off together. Lenny knew the place; he’d met Dudley there before.
“Did you hear me, Harry?”
Bewildered, he listens to the repetitive scraping noise that sounds like it’s coming from the main floor. Slowly, carefully, he descends the stairs, clinging to the bannister for support. He hears the unmistakable peals of Teddy’s laughter.
,” he shouted as he advanced.
“I have to tell you…” Draco appeared conflicted; his jaw set tight. But then his brow unfurrowed; he turned and walked to the bookshelf. He returned with a book.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to snap at you. It’s been a… strange day. And to answer your question, no, we’ve never been friends.” He put together Harry’s order and rang it up. “That will be £4.”
That was probably true. If only Draco could cast a discreet
“Scones,” he exclaimed. “I’ve got scones in the oven, and I don’t want them to burn.”
I turned the other cheek when he got tattooed. It was a phase; it would pass. But when he got the nose ring, I put my foot down. Just like Vernon would have done. I forbade him from seeing those never-do-well lowlifes he called friends. Do you know what he did? He laughed in my face and went out anyway. When I asked him where he’d been, he just said,
Petunia paled, her lips pressed into a thin line. “Over my dead body,” she seethed.
Jess rolled her eyes and smiled. “He does, but it’s nothing personal. He feels threatened. You’re gorgeous, all the birds flock to you, and not him.”
“Ugghhh… spearmint,” he rasped. “Horrid stuff.”
Harry sighed. “They have Neville; they don’t need me.” Draco slowly pressed his tongue inside; Harry inhaled sharply and closed his eyes.
The spell buzzed when the transfer was complete. Groggy and light-headed, Draco sat up and repeated the diagnostics. There was still a rapid pull towards the vortex, and Harry’s pulse was faster than it ought to be. Draco feared he knew why—patience was not one of Harry’s virtues.
03 May 1998
You look at Harry and he steps closer to you, whispers in your ear. “Don’t worry, everything’s done. Hermione’s notified all your family and friends. While you slept, I went to the funeral home and narrowed down your options. You can make the final decision when you’re ready. I haven’t told Scorp anything, but if you’d like I’ll be here when you do.”
Artemis tapped at the window to be let out, making a show of her helplessness. Draco rolled his eyes. She’d managed to get in, and he was certain she could get out, too. But he played along and opened the window. She ruffled her feathers and flew out into the sunshine.
All I can think about is the mission. Months of hard work, research, and intelligence are about to be rendered useless. I have to get us out of here before we’re seen. I grab Malfoy’s wrist, and before he can protest I Apparate us directly to Robard’s office. We land with a jolt and my skin stings, but I can’t tell if it’s from the potions or from punching through the multitude of Ministry wards.
“Daddy, Daddy, try one,” he squeals and shoves a cookie into your hands before you can even answer. You take a bite and savour the rich, spiced, sweet molasses-y goodness.
“I’ve been going over it all in my head. It’s something I do to make sense of things—part of my daily healing ritual. I visualise and I breathe. But lately, I’ve come to realise I only really know the events from my perspective. I think it might help me heal if I could understand it better from both sides. What did you, Weasley and Potter get up to the year you were on the run?”
He stared at them—they were written in his messy scrawl. They seemed strange and out of place, because something else should be written there instead. Shouldn’t it?
Draco stepped backwards, pulling Harry with him. “Doesn’t matter. He’s sick. He’s coming with me.”
“I’ll see you again next year.”
bed that had vibrated them onto the floor as soon as he’d slipped in his Knut.
There came a blinding flash of chartreuse, and Draco’s heart raced.
Harry straddles Draco, overwhelmed by the slide of well-worn leather against his skin, and the thrilling possessiveness of Draco’s kisses. Draco carefully inserts one, then two, lubed fingers inside Harry. He curls his fingers, brushes against
I can hardly bring myself to write about it. Writing it down makes it feel more real…
“But we’re ready to leave,” Harry pouted, an act which made Draco’s stomach flutter—he was in so much trouble.
“We should stop. It would be a shame for your scones to burn.”
Potter stood when he saw Draco. He looked much better than when Draco had last seen him—his cheeks were rosy, his hair artfully dishevelled, and he was wearing a navy knitted jumper with a golden ‘H’ on the front. He looked touchable. But Draco kept his hands firmly against his thighs—he wasn’t allowed touch. Not anymore.
Draco showered and primped in record time. He knew it was sappy, but he wore the same shirt and trousers he’d worn for their first date. Maybe it would bring him luck?
Draco turned onto the suburban lane lined with identical houses and pulled up outside number four, Privet Drive. He glanced in the mirror, adjusted his collar, smoothed down his hair, and made sure there was nothing between his teeth. He couldn’t be certain, but when they spoke on the phone, he got the impression Harry was attempting to flirt with him. Of course, he might have misunderstood, his judgement clouded by wishful thinking. Nevertheless, he’d packed a picnic basket and a blanket, just in case things took a romantic turn. It never hurt to be prepared.
“It’s Harry.”
. If the Malfoy boy so much as uses his
“Harry?” Draco called out. There was no response. Draco sat up and hoped Harry was just in the loo, but the knot of anxiety building in the pit of his stomach told him exactly what the cold bed meant: Harry was gone. The letter on his desk confirmed it.
In the kitchen, he lit a cigarette and stared out into the garden. The roses were blanketed in darkness, save for a sliver of light cascading through the back door. What was he going to do with his aunt? She needed help, and he wasn’t sure he was the one to give it to her. He reached down and grabbed the nearest teacup—hand-painted with dainty roses, Petunia’s favourite. Absently, he brought the cup to his lips and drank deeply.
Harry’s heart, full of love and joy, flutters. He turns and pulls Draco in for a proper kiss. “They’re gorgeous,” he says.
Harry; he no longer had that carefree openness about him that had set Draco at ease. But, he wasn’t the same person he was before the war either. Draco couldn’t put his finger on it, but something was different.
and a small pamphlet about tropical snowstorms.
Harry quickly dressed, put out his cigarette, and headed downstairs.
“A lot, Harry. But this isn’t about me. It’s about you. You’re in danger, and I need to help you. I think I’ve figured out how to fix this”—he gently touched Harry’s scar, angry and red—“and restore your memory.”
“I have no idea,” Harry replied and pulled back to look at Draco. He winked. “Only one way to find out.” With a wicked smirk, he captured Draco’s lips and busied himself undoing Draco’s trousers. Draco cursed as his elbow knocked against the glass in his eagerness to get into Harry’s. Draco gasped as Harry wrapped a hand around his cock.
* * *
“Let’s do it together.”
, Draco countered—“would need to be assessed magically by a Healer.”
But it felt real, and deep down inside, Draco knew it was.
. Harry didn’t even believe most of what he saw. Draco knew he should tell him the truth. About everything. All of it.
“There’s too much resistance,” she said, her voice strained.
And that’s how Draco would heal Harry—the Elder Wand would serve as a conduit.
Harry found a pair of scissors and cut a tab into four. He put one piece on his tongue and lay down in bed.
“I want to do this with you. I want to know what you feel, what you see.”
“Well, I like it. It’s part of who you are.”
Harry’s voice spoke clearly in his mind, and Draco intended to follow his advice.
“I thought I heard…” He looked at Harry, brow furrowed, the corners of his mouth curling downward into a frown. He muttered a string of expletives.
—he just needs a little bit more.
“You can’t take him.” Petunia rounded on them.
He desperately needed a hot shower to wash away the fear and the memory of the black hole. It wasn’t the first time he’d dreamt it, either. It happened regularly now, every two-to-three weeks, and during the time in between, it plagued his subconscious. But this was the second time this week, which left Harry shaken and unsettled. What did it mean?
he can handle it.”
Harry’s skin prickled. He felt like a caged animal.
“Mother loves Christmas, and decorating, so there’s a Christmas tree in every room, each with a different theme. This one here” — he points to a small tree in the corner, beside the oven — “belongs to the elves. Mother lets them decorate it every year, and they can do so however they like.”
“Right,” Draco said, his tones clipped. “I’ll see myself out.”
“Please.”
“Because I thought you could use a moment to calm down before we encounter my parents.” Draco takes Harry’s hand and urges him forward. “Also, because I want to show you all the trees.”
“Miserable?”
“Exactly.” Draco pursed his lips. “I think I know how to heal him.”
“I understand,” Draco said. And he really did. There was no way Hermione Granger would willingly cry on Draco Malfoy’s shoulder, or have Harry Potter’s wand in her possession unless she believed him dead.
Harry sorted through the pile: a bible, a syllabus along with the first books to complete his A levels at home, and a brochure for Grunnings, a company that sold drills.
“Thank you. It’s my mother’s recipe.” Hermione’s cheeks pinked.
Hermione had called twice to let him know Potter was improving, growing stronger by the day. But the lack of communication from Potter himself spoke volumes—he did not remember their time together.
We continue to dance. Malfoy’s arms are strong, and his hair is silky-smooth as it brushes against my skin. His lips move against my ear. “You do, I can tell.” With a quick movement disguised as a dance step, he pulls me against him, aligning our hips. I’m hard, and now he knows it. But, to my surprise, Malfoy’s equally aroused. Without a moment’s hesitation, he kisses me firmly on the mouth—he tastes of whisky and cigarettes—and I sigh softly. He nips at my lower lip as he pulls back, and there’s a wicked gleam in his eye. I shudder. I can’t help myself. His lips are shiny and he’s gorgeous.
Diddy’s a good boy. He’s just made a mistake. One day soon he’ll realise it and come home. I just know it.
“What do you have?”
. He liked blokes, especially blonds. This one came as a surprise. Petunia had taken him for a suit fitting—she insisted a fine young man such as himself should have one in his wardrobe. While standing on the stool awaiting measurement, he noticed the blond next to him. Something sparked in his gut. At first, he thought it was recognition, like perhaps this person had been a friend. But the man didn’t seem to know who he was, so he quickly realised it must be something else. Attraction. But he kept this revelation to himself. While Petunia had warmed up to him, forgiven him for whatever he had done in his past, he suspected this might push her too far, and she was already so fragile. Also, there were so many things he’d thought he'd discovered about himself, but they all turned out to be false. He couldn’t handle being told he was wrong about this as well. Not when it felt so right.
“Now we wait. Whatever shall we do?” Harry waggled his eyebrows suggestively. Draco smirked as Harry pushed him back onto the bed and straddled him, kissed him, consumed him. Draco sighed as their tongues slid together. He wrapped his arms around Harry, pulling him closer, feeling a hardness push against his own. Draco groaned at the spark of pleasure, centred at his groin, that radiated outwards electrifying every inch of his body. Harry kissed down Draco’s neck, pausing to nip at the tender spot near his ear, while they made quick work removing unnecessary clothing. Draco rummaged in the drawer of his bedside table for lube.
He could do this all night. Forever. But he knows there’s not much time left. There’s never enough time. He brushes his fingers along Draco’s icy features once more and exhales slowly, his breath crackling in the cold air between them. When Draco’s expression goes blank and he turns, Harry closes his eyes and slowly counts to twenty. In all the years he’s been coming up here, he’s not once been able to watch what happens next.
It meant something, though he didn’t know what. But he’d uncovered these words through LSD—not meditation.

Harry nods.
It was three nights later when they got their chance. Petunia dropped Harry off at the cinema, but instead of watching
“Oh, no, Draco. Harry would never willingly go back there. The Dursleys were awful people. They hated magic, and they abused him horribly.”
Draco leaned forward and brought his hand up to Harry’s forehead. He gently massaged circles into Harry’s brow, and Harry smiled. “That’s better. This is probably going to sound strange, but I feel different when I’m with you.” Harry pulled back and fished a pack of cigarettes from his pocket. He lit one, then inhaled deeply and let the smoke waft from his mouth. “It started the moment I first saw you. It’s like, the past few months, nothing concrete has come back to me. There have been a few flashes, but they’ve all proven false. But with you”—he took another drag—“it’s hard to describe the feeling, but you feel familiar. It’s like when you know the word for something, and it’s on the tip of your tongue, but you just can’t remember it. Are you sure we weren’t friends?”
09 August 1998
Draco sat on the floor, his eyes closed, taking deep breaths into his belly. He continued like this while he contemplated what Hermione had told him.
“I can see that. Why don’t you beg off and go see Loverboy? I’ll cover for you.”
The lights dimmed, and the projector flickered on, but Harry’s mind was elsewhere. He sat through the first preview and then excused himself to go buy snacks. Petunia gave him a crisp £10 note. He wasn’t hungry, but it was the perfect excuse to chat up the gorgeous platinum-haired cinema attendant he’d seen at the snack kiosk. Harry couldn’t explain it, but he felt inexplicably drawn to him. He was attractive, with flawless skin and sharp, chiselled features, but it was deeper than that. When their eyes met, something prickled up Harry’s spine and down his arms, like tiny electrodes. In that instant, he knew he had to get to know this person.
“It’s fascinating,” Draco said, as he opened and closed the fridge door, watching as the light blinked off and on. “I didn’t even have to cast
The tree in the centre is incredible, clearly installed by magical means — most likely magically enhanced as well — there is no other explanation for its sheer size and complete perfection. The tree stands five floors tall, the star at the top grazing the ceiling, elegantly decorated in silver baubles and Slytherin green bows.
“All right. I’ll try it.”
Petunia plunked herself down on the couch and smoked while she watched Harry work. Occasionally, she tapped the ash delicately into an overflowing ashtray. Goosebumps prickled along the back of Harry’s neck—he felt extremely exposed and self-conscious under her constant observation. He didn’t expect to be thanked, but it would have been nice. However, Petunia didn’t seem like a very warm person, so gratitude was unlikely, and she certainly wasn’t in a good place right now, especially if this Vernon person had recently died.
“No, it’s not yours anymore. When Harry took your wand at Malfoy Manor, the Elder Wand switched allegiance, which is why it never worked properly for Voldemort. During the battle, when we were inside the castle, Harry came around a corner and startled me. I expected to be attacked, so I disarmed him.”
“It’s a blessing you never became an Auror. Mind you, perhaps if you had you’d have more sense than to touch unknown masonry.”
They drove along one of Draco’s favourite scenic routes talking about everything and nothing, the carefree banter from their phone conversations easily extending into real life.
He didn’t even finish school. He should be home where he belongs—with me. He’d still be here if it weren’t for those
… But no. He’d sworn off magic for a reason. He wouldn’t get sucked into that world again.
Draco sits back, and Harry feels his absence like an ache.
Draco tiptoed back to bed—Harry, his gorgeous angel, slept peacefully, hair rumpled against the pillow. But what was going on beneath the surface? Drowsy, Draco curled up beside Harry and was asleep in minutes.
Hermione took a deep breath and closed her eyes. “If he’d have just come to me first… He must have been under his cloak—”
—a film that both terrified Draco and filled him with awe—as planned, they immediately left following Petunia’s departure.
The Floo roars to life and Narcissa’s head appears, because of course. She looks around the room with a raised eyebrow. Teddy comes skating by, pushed by the dragon, and he waves. “Hi, Auntie!”
Victory!
a surprise. Within Harry’s head, directly below the lightning bolt scar, was a swirling, pulsing vortex, slowly but surely sucking in all of Harry’s magic—no doubt his memories, too.
His stomach churned with guilt.
Harry rolled over, ready to nuzzle against Draco, but found him sitting upright instead, staring at Harry with a furrowed brow.
Except that wasn’t true—he wouldn’t even remember her.
“Let’s try this again, shall we? One-two-three, one-two-three.”
“I’ve already spoken to him on your behalf. You needn’t worry about him anymore; he won’t bother you again.”
“You’re awake,” she said, her tone surprised. Harry huffed.
“I know a guy.”
Draco leans in, licks Harry’s left nipple through the jersey while he pinches the right, and the sensation—sharp pressure, the damp fabric clinging to his skin—is overwhelming. Draco catches Harry’s nipple between his teeth and gently rolls the nub—Harry inhales sharply—before releasing it.
“All right. Good.” She looked over her shoulder again, then turned back. “You’re one of Harry’s friends?” Her eyes pierced him to his core, and if she weren’t a Muggle, he’d have suspected her of attempting Legilimency. He shrank, just a little.
Draco gritted his teeth. “Yes, we both know what a horrible person I was and that you hate me. I’m sure your sudden gratitude is difficult for you. You’ll get over it.”
Barely audible, Harry said, “What’s that mean?”
Draco’s translucent face illuminates with the light from Ron’s Patronus. Harry doesn’t even remember what the case was about, just Ron’s urgent plea for backup.
He breathed a nervous sigh as he opened the first page. It contained a large photograph from Petunia and Vernon’s wedding—they were both so young. Harry flipped through the book to see a newborn Dudley, Dudley blowing out the single candle on an enormous chocolate cake, and Dudley tottering around in a sailor’s uniform. His cousin had been a fat little porker. Harry thought about the overly large clothing he’d originally found in his room and shrugged. Perhaps they’d both been fat.
When Harry looks down, he sees Draco has already restored his Quidditch trousers, his hands still cupping Harry’s arse. Unexpectedly, Harry’s stomach growls, reminding him it’s time for dinner.
A delicious, wet tongue licked a stripe across his entrance, and Harry moaned quietly.
He wasn’t
“Harry,” Draco spoke calmly, attempting to keep his voice even despite the obvious panic threatening to rise and take over.
“Is that what I think it is?”
Harry’s lips moved, his murmurs inaudible. Draco leaned in, unsurprised by what he heard.
“Have you checked to make sure they’re not from carnivorous roses?”
Draco sucks on the tender spot behind Harry’s earlobe and Harry can’t help but moan. He can feel Draco’s triumphant smirk as he goes pliant in the man’s arms. Which gives Harry an idea.
“Ouch! All right, all right. I’ll go see him.” He feigned annoyance but fetched her a piece of extra spicy jerky. While she ate, he cast a Tempus. It was already 1 pm—he barely had enough time to make himself presentable.
Harry obliges, moving faster, deeper, feeling the pleasure build towards a crescendo. Draco scrapes his nails across Harry’s back, and the pain pulls him over the edge just as much as the tight clench of Draco’s arse as he comes.
Harry examines himself carefully in the dusty mirror—his eyes travel along his arms, over his torso, and down his legs. He’s not the scrawny boy he once was, neglected and malnourished, fueled by fear and determination. But he’s also not the toned athlete who downed protein shakes and kept track of his macros. Harry is blatantly aware that
Harry didn’t need to be told twice. He let his robe slide down, kicked off his swimming trunks, and stepped into the tub. He leaned back against Draco, resting his head on Draco’s shoulder.
“I’ve heard
“Aren’t you having any?”
having an ill effect on Harry.
. Draco grumbled. He was about to banish the book back to his trunk when he saw the illustration. He stopped dead in his tracks.
Harry got changed and sat on his bed.
“But for a squib, though, Muggle medicine should be sufficient. They have little to no magic, so you can treat them just like a Muggle.
. One for each member of the Black and Malfoy families.”
Draco opened the takeaway container and scooped rice and beef vindaloo onto a plate. He took a bite and continued to pace. Maybe it was a trick. Maybe Potter hadn’t died—they’d never found his body—and the Light Side had used his supposed death to further their agenda. Anger pulsed through Draco. Of course, more manipulation. He didn’t trust the Dark Side or the Light, but he’d believed in Potter, in his goodness and his decency. Draco had always desired to be more like him and had turned his back on magic in part because of Potter’s death. And now here he was, pretending not to know Draco and offering his friendship. Such irony. But to what purpose? This was too good to be genuine. What was he playing at? Draco didn’t appreciate being used or manipulated.
Harry does. Slowly. Self-consciously. He prays his spellwork holds up.
Draco exhales, long and slow, as though preparing himself for a feast. Hot breath ghosts over Harry’s entrance, and his body thrums with Draco’s magic as a Cleansing Spell washes over him. The intoxicating scent of lavender and rosemary lingers in the air.
Draco couldn’t do this. It was like whiplash—hoping, and then having his hope dashed. He stiffened.
When Harry thought he could risk it, he opened his eyes. Just a little. A bit more. Then all the way. Harry eased himself into an upright position. He was in a room he didn’t recognise. Sparsely decorated with just the small bed he’d slept in, a desk, chest of drawers, and a small wardrobe. It didn’t look like anyone lived in the room—there were no posters, books, or other signs of habitation—but it must be his room, he reasoned, for he’d just woken up in it.
embroidered across the back; knee pads, shin pads, arm guards, and gloves, all made from the toughest Hebridean Black dragon hide. Finally, his trousers fashioned from the softest sheepskin leather, custom made for maximum flexibility and minimal chafing, form-fitted to reduce air drag, fastened with laces at the crotch.
“What makes you think I have it?” She eyed him suspiciously.
“I’m watching my figure. Now go on and eat up. You have lots of unwrapping to do.”
A quick rifle through the chest of drawers uncovered a t-shirt and trousers, oversized, but he shrugged them on anyway. He eyed himself in the mirror with distaste. Was he always this poorly dressed? He attempted to flatten his hair with little success; the dark mess continued to stick out in all directions.
“I want to go home.”
Harry collapses beside him. “So good, Draco. You’re always so good for me,” he pants and casts a wandless Cleaning Charm over them. He tugs Draco closer and kisses him. “I could get lost inside you forever.”
Monday last I went to see the grief counsellor that Dr Vaughn’s been urging me to see. Utter nonsense, that’s what it was. We just sat and stared at each other for an hour. The only thing he said was to talk when I was ready. But what was I supposed to talk about? Then Dr Vaughn had the nerve to say it was too soon, and perhaps I wasn’t ready. As though it was my fault that quack didn’t do his job.
“Open your mouth,” Harry instructed, and Draco’s mind flashed back to the last time Harry had said that—his prick stirred. Harry placed a drop under Draco’s tongue. The liquid, cool and tasteless, sent a spark flickering down his spine. Harry placed a drop under his own tongue and closed the bottle.
With a
The Horcrux had taken up space inside Harry’s head from the time he was a baby. When eliminated, it would have left a void—an emptiness that was used to being filled.
Take advantage of the situation. Get his reward.
What would Lucius Malfoy do? He’d have gone straight to the Dark Lord and offered this juicy tidbit of information for a reward.
She tutted.
The house was a small two-story with absolutely nothing remarkable about it. Draco was certain his younger self would have made fun of it and included Potter in his
There came a tapping at the window in the main room, and Draco carefully slipped out of bed. He walked to the window, which opened on its own just as he thought to open it. Artemis flew in. She carried no letter, only a small bottle attached to her leg. A Calming Draught. Draco gratefully accepted the potion, tipped his head back, and drank it all down. The cooling relief spread throughout his body and settled his core.
They made small talk, and it all seemed to go very well. Better than Draco had expected, given the initial frosty reception. Then Petunia put her palm to her temple.
Draco comes up behind him and rests his chin on Harry’s shoulder as he meets his eyes in the mirror. “Because I endured the Weasleys last Christmas.”
What was Harry’s?
. Malfoy has that look about him, the one where he’s infuriatingly smug because he knows I’ve cocked things up again.
Had Potter been Cursed then?
He looked in the mirror as he contemplated fact number five. According to Aunt Petunia, his cousin, Dudley, was a drug addict. It wasn’t Dudley’s fault. He’d taken his father’s death hard and had fallen in with a bad crowd. In hushed tones, Petunia told Harry about the rolling papers, the bong and the three tabs of LSD she’d found in Dudley’s room. There must have been more she wasn’t telling him, though, because that didn’t seem like enough to label him an addict. Regardless, Harry knew Petunia loved Dudley more than anything, and he could tell how hard his rebellion had been on her. He vowed to do anything he could to make her happy.
“I wasn’t sure if you were being sincere, or just telling me what I wanted to hear.” She ran her fingers along the smooth surface of the wand. Draco’s eyes followed the movement.
“I thought you’d never ask,” Draco replied with a cheeky grin. He strode forward and scaled the trellis, muttering curses at the thorny roses with every handhold. Harry laughed. It was a weak laugh, but good to hear.
“My Saviour,” Harry said, and Draco was very much aware of the irony—one of the Saviours of the wizarding world calling him, a reformed Death Eater,
Harry’s eyes flitted to Draco’s and widened. “‘Mione? Why the fuck is Malfoy here?”
His insides contracted—as though imploding—and with a
“How did you do that, Draco?” Harry asked again, his limbs shaky. He did not look good—his eyes were bloodshot and smudged with dark circles, his complexion pale, and his scar had cracked further open.
When your father died, Stori was with you. When she got sick and passed away, your mother was there through it all. But now.
“I should have told you sooner.”
and curses; he should have set an alarm. Usually, when Teddy stays over, he
Draco pulled back, his face serious. “Harry, I don’t think you should use it anymore.”
“Your father hates me.”
He paced the floor.
“If you’re still worried about taking advantage, then why don’t I just fuck you?”
“Are you certain? Because I feel as though you’re elsewhere tonight.”
“There’s no guarantee this will work,” she said, voice tinged with concern.
It’s only when Draco growls, “Harry,” his voice hoarse, that Harry sucks him all the way down until his cock hits the back of Harry’s throat. Draco groans and threads his fingers through Harry’s messy hair. Harry sucks him hard with hollowed cheeks, and Draco pants and writhes, occasionally swearing.
Draco cast
As the steam billowed and fogged the mirror, a shiver ran down his spine. There was something about the image that was familiar, yet unpleasant. He shook his head and quickly got into the shower.
Potter was dead.
Harry stumbles out and dusts himself off; Draco does the same but with practised elegance. “Why are we down here?”
Their stomachs were sticky with their release, and Draco yearned to clean them, but he remained rooted to the spot, as though he’d lost the ability to move. His entire body pulsed with energy—
“You had fun and you know it.”
to remember. Draco wasn’t wicked, which meant neither was his mother. He cursed Petunia for confiscating his bottle of LSD. But then he remembered. Lenny had given him a little something extra. A sample. He opened the wardrobe and fumbled around until he found the jacket he’d been wearing that day—it was still inside the pocket.
Harry’s heart rate spiked, hammering beneath Draco’s fingers; a burst of magic jolted through Draco making him tremble. Harry’s body was out of control.
Hermione nodded in assent.
But he hadn’t. The note simply instructed Draco to go around to the back garden. The air was brisk, but not too chilly to sit outside. Draco shook his head and took a deep breath, relief and anxiety setting his nerves abuzz.
“I can see it’s lunch. But why have you locked me in my room?”
Harry’s not surprised when Draco avoids him. Whenever they fight, he always needs time to lick his wounds. He knows they’ll talk and make up. Eventually. They’ve always been drawn to each other, two magnets that attract and repel.
Draco chuckles. “So impatient.”
Harry hesitated, then asked, “Is everything all right?”
He was losing his mind.
“I’m fine,” he wheezed. “Just bit my tongue.” He was going to throttle Draco. He opened his eyes and focused on her ardent expression. “Hermione, I’ve done enough, and we both know I’m worth more dead than alive.” Shortly after regaining his memories, he’d started the
“Watch it!” Draco calls out, and barely gets a
Harry smiled. It was nice to be part of a family—he was lucky. He just wished he could remember Uncle Vernon and his cousin Dudley. And his parents. But he’d been so young when they died that even without the amnesia, he supposed he might not remember them. Harry rinsed out the shampoo and applied conditioner.
It had been three weeks since Potter’s magic—and memory—had been restored. Draco had taken to calling him
Rivulets of emerald and azure travelled through the wand and into Harry.
“I booked us the chef’s table at the Silver Dragon, Golden Pearl Restaurant.”
“It’s mine?” Draco asked, incredulous. “But I’ve never touched it.”
How did this happen? Was it a curse?
Artemis visited Draco’s flat frequently, usually while he was out, but he could tell she’d been there by the presence of a tail feather… or crumbs. He’d taken to leaving out pieces of spicy jerky in anticipation of her visits, and his library of books from the Manor continued to grow until it rivalled his collection of Muggle textbooks. He kept the magical books hidden away in the back of his closet, determined not to use them.
Eventually, Draco tears free. “Be that as it may,” he pants, “I would much rather have you in a
“I wonder if your aunt attended the ceremony?” Hermione mused.
“I didn’t want any part in it, but they gave me no choice.” Draco rolled up his left sleeve to reveal the Dark Mark—Petunia gasped. “My family supported the wrong side; I was branded and put to work. The things they forced me to do…” Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath. “They manipulated and used me.” He pulled his sleeve back down and buttoned the cuff. “I left home, and the wizarding world as soon as I could. I’ve renounced magic. It’s brought so much pain and suffering.”
Kirk narrowed his eyes at Draco and Draco scowled back. Jess prodded Draco’s leg with her foot. “You two need to get over yourselves.”
Harry opened the bottle and scattered the wine-red petals into the water. He poured two glasses of champagne. They clinked glasses, then Harry leaned over to wash Draco’s back.
“Hold still, Harry.”
Eventually, Harry padded down the hallway, instinctively knowing the way to the loo. He rinsed his mouth, used the facilities, and returned to the room.
“You know me so well.”
He hurried to the loo and splashed cold water on his face. He took three breaths, deep and steady, while he looked in the mirror. His face was paler than usual. He’d thought he’d moved on. Made peace with Potter’s death. Why would he suddenly see him now? Clearly, he wasn’t over it. He hoped this wasn’t one of those post-trauma situations where he’d start seeing versions of Potter everywhere he looked.
“We don’t have to.” Harry seemed nervous. Perhaps he was still worried about exposing this part of himself. But Draco hadn’t stopped thinking about it since Harry had confided in him. Was he somehow accessing his latent memories while high on LSD? Draco needed to know, both as a boyfriend who cared, and from a medical perspective.
... showed up unexpectedly, from Lord-knows-where, and claimed to have no memory. He didn’t appear to know about Vernon or Dudley, but I wonder if it’s a trick? Is he after the insurance money?
, she’d added. It was a viable excuse, but Draco didn’t trust her—especially not after Hermione’s disturbing revelation.
. Harry knew those words never boded well. “You don’t regret it, do you?” His heart clenched as he awaited Draco’s response.
“The forest. Must go to the forest. I open at the close.” Harry sat up, pushing against Draco, but in his weakened state, it wasn’t hard for Draco to wrestle him back down on the bed.
Foiled yet again by Draco Malfoy. Piers and Marjorie came around for tea and Harry was out… visiting
Heading out to Surrey to visit Harry Potter? Not something Lucius Malfoy would do… unless there was something in it for him. But while Draco’s intentions might be self-serving, he didn’t mean Harry any ill will.
“That’s the Floo, the chime for St. Mungo’s. I won’t be a moment.”
. The few times they’ve worked together, Malfoy’s made it clear he can barely stand to be in Harry’s presence: he avoids eye contact, keeps his words clipped and to the point, and he always leaves the moment their work is done. So Harry does his best to keep his pesky feelings to himself.
“Onward, as they say,” Dumbledore replied. He continued to watch Harry, his expression halfway between anticipation and compassion. “What would you like to do, Harry?”
“Hermione, please.”
“It’ll keep.”
She also pushed through a tray with a tuna sandwich, a steaming hot cup of tea, and a pack of cigarettes. Harry sighed with relief. He’d finished his last pack, and his hand was growing twitchy.
The store is empty. Not a customer or employee in sight, which is strange for a Friday afternoon. Malfoy, the gorgeous bastard, holds his finger to his lips, and I roll my eyes. I can be quiet and careful. We both make our way forward in silence. I’m so focused on each footfall, ensuring a stealthy approach, that I don’t notice when Malfoy suddenly stops. I bump into him full force, and we lose our balance. There’s a display case to our right, stacked to the ceiling with corked bottles and glittering phials, and we stumble right into it. The entire thing comes crashing down—shelves buckle, stoppers fly loose, and glass shatters. We’re both drenched in a variety of unknown substances.
A bony woman with a long neck appeared and narrowed her eyes at Draco. Harry smiled.
There. I wrote about it. But I don’t see the point.
Draco placed the book in Harry’s hands. “I’d really like it if you took a break from the LSD, just for a little while, and tried this instead. You never know. It might help.” He flipped the pages to the first exercise. “I could show you.”
Harry shivered. Draco’s hands, affixed in place, were now spreading apart the globes of his arse. Hot breath ghosted across his pucker.
Draco had chosen not to use magic. It was a conscious decision and he stood by it. How was this possible? He didn’t even have his wand with him. It was like… accidental magic. The cogs turned inside Draco’s head. The LSD had left him agitated and was now reacting with his magical core, amplifying his thoughts and accelerating his latent magical tendencies. A grown wizard was expected to be in charge of his faculties, but Draco was having difficulty keeping his in check, just like a magical child.
The slide of Harry’s leg against his skin stifled the words. A brush of hair across Draco’s cheek, the scent of sandalwood at his throat, sent a jolt of arousal straight to Draco’s cock. He knew he shouldn’t, but he wanted Harry so badly.
The tree glows warmly, but on closer inspection, Harry realises it’s covered in an assortment of used tea bags, napkin rings and several old socks. It’s perfectly odd, yet it makes Harry feel a little warmer inside.
Goldstein’s already on his feet, but Harry needs a moment. He’d rather wait for the obvious bulge in his jeans to deflate. He pictures Aunt Marge dressed in Santa panties coordinated with red, tasselled pasties. There. That does the trick. Harry stands slowly and wraps his sweater (bright red and green, patterned with trolls clubbing each other with giant candy canes) around his waist, so the sleeves hang down and obscure his crotch, just in case. Hermione raises an eyebrow but says nothing.
whispered in his ear. He contemplated moving, but he knew no matter where he went, the memories would follow.
For a month they kept their word. But eventually she
She looked at him as though he was being incredibly daft.
She turned back slowly, and patted her lips as she let out a dainty burp. Tiny bubbles rose to the surface. She winked at Harry and beckoned him closer.
Draco’s eyes widen. He suddenly remembers how much there still is to do. Christmas, once a peaceful time, has deteriorated into a chaotic mess requiring skilful navigation and multiple meals in separate locations. Andromeda refuses to be in the same room with Lucius (the feeling is mutual) and Lucius refuses to set foot in Grimmauld Place or acknowledge his relationship with Harry.
He cast a Healing Charm, and his skin knitted back together, leaving the lightning bolt scar. Hermione left the room, but Draco lingered. He looked at Harry, so beautiful, lying so peacefully. He bent down and kissed Harry’s forehead before he left.
“I couldn’t do it. Bellatrix took over, and she made me watch.” Draco swiped his cuff across his wet eyes. “The parents talked, told them what they wanted to hear. But none of it was true. The next day, the Death Eaters went back, and I don’t want to think about what they did.” Draco’s breath came in ragged bursts, and he forced himself to focus on each inhalation and exhalation until he’d calmed down.
*  *  *
“Do you like it?” Scorpius asks and looks up at you expectantly.
Draco stared at the outstretched hand. “After everything, you’re offering me your friendship?”
He dialled the number. The phone rang. Petunia answered.
It doesn’t make any sense. You hear their voices, garbled, surrounding you, and you know they’re right next to you, on either side, but they sound so far away. The Weasel. Granger. They say it’s such a shame. So close to Christmas. That she was still so young. You know what Robards told you, that your mother is dead, Killing Curse to the chest, and that they have the perp in custody. But it doesn’t make any sense. You just had dinner with her last night. You’re supposed to meet her for tea this afternoon and go Christmas shopping together afterwards. None of this makes any sense.
That’s how she mended Harry’s wand.
Harry snorts and gets to work on Draco’s flies, the fabric pulled taut over his straining erection.
Hermione inhaled sharply. “He shouldn’t be using that. It would react with his magic and—”
The potion bubbled, the surface glinting like diamonds, far more beautiful than something so Dark should be, and another Death Eater—Wormtail—came carrying a bundle. It looked like a baby, but when Wormtail pushed back the hood, the figure within had slits for eyes. Draco stared into them, felt them pierce his soul, and the Dark Mark burned. It had been nearly four months since he’d felt that sensation, and he’d hoped to never feel it again. He whimpered helplessly.
Draco’s jaw clenched and his pulse raced—he could not lose Harry. Just as he was about to cast again, Harry’s chest slowly rose and fell, and it sounded like… like he was snoring. As though he was asleep, and this had all just been a bad dream. It certainly felt like one to Draco. Slowly, he exhaled, letting relief course through his veins, willing his heart rate to slow and his head to clear.
We awkwardly make our way around the room with Kreature playing a waltz on the violin (I never knew he could play), and I attempt some semblance of rhythm. But it’s hard, because Malfoy is so close, and he smells of citrus and broom polish.
He needed Draco
With the towel wrapped around his waist, Harry headed back to his room. He sat at his desk and lit a cigarette. He exhaled and opened his journal, the one Dr Vaughn insisted he started keeping. It was mostly blank, except for this list.
“I’m afraid that’s not possible,” Petunia snarled. “He’s sleeping.” She looked at Draco as though she’d rather spit on him than talk. “He looked frightfully ill when he arrived home this morning, and we won’t even get into how unlike him it is to leave without letting me know. What have you done to him?”
Today, while Harry was outside mulching the roses (he’s such a good boy) and I was doing the washing up, he looked through the window at me and smiled. He’s so innocent, so eager to please. Why didn’t I ever see it before?
Harry held Draco tight and whispered, “So good. You were so good for me. Took me so well. So tight, so perfect.” Draco didn’t expect the rush of pride from the unexpected praise, but he held on for dear life hoping he’d always have this, that Harry knew what he was saying when he told him he’d always want him.
With determination, Harry looked up at his mentor.
“Well, everyone deserves a second chance, including you. Why don’t you forgive yourself and move on?”
Draco looked at Harry, his eyes fearful and pleading.
Another image flashed before him. His Uncle Vernon, face purple with rage, shouting at Aurors, and gesturing for them to leave. As they Disapparated, one by one, Vernon clutched at his chest, and his face went slack. Petunia screamed as she ran to him.
Vernon’s still dead.
“No,” I say, a little too quickly.
26 August 1998
We arrived home late that night. The house was so quiet without him, I–
eagerly sitting too close, and also because the only other wizard in the mostly Muggle class is that tosser, Anthony Goldstein, who’s chosen a front-row seat.
But that was the last he’d seen of Harry. They still spoke on the phone and made plans, but Harry broke them off just as easily, always because of Petunia… a heartbreaking letter from her son… a migraine… a terrible nightmare that had left her shaken…
Harry’s eyes darted to Draco.
The teacher announces the end of class. As Malfoy pulls on his Santa robe, he fixes Harry with an intense gaze that makes him feel like he’s the one that’s nearly naked.
He yearned to see his mother and the bespectacled man he knew must be his father. He hoped for an epiphany, a sudden return of memory.
Can you believe that? He called her a friend. Said that
They’d gone for a drive this past week, and since they were nearby, they drove past number four, Privet Drive. Petunia was nowhere in sight, but there was a
The alluring scent of bacon and eggs wafted through his open door.
“No,” Draco says firmly. When Draco has his sights set on something, he’s not one to be dissuaded.
But when Harry opened his eyes, they were gone. He blinked; they writhed inside the chamber pot. He blinked again. No slugs.
He shuffled off the bed, wincing as he moved, and prised up the floorboard. But the space within was empty.
“You don’t have to. Just say the words.”
Harry wanted to ask about Vernon, but he wasn’t sure about the best way. Petunia seemed a little unstable, as though the smallest thing might set her off. He decided to fish for information in a roundabout way.
Harry looked out his bedroom window into the garden. Petunia was busy tending to her roses, her painted rose teacup at her side, a cigarette hanging delicately from her mouth. Once she got started, she could be out there for hours…
“Lucky guess.” Draco shrugged. “You bought all that candy at the cinema, I figured you had a sweet tooth.”
Draco tries to look annoyed, but he’s sure his fond smile gives him away. He pulls Harry in by the lapel. “You’re ridiculous,” he says and captures Harry’s soft lips in a chaste kiss while Teddy claps in the background.
“Positive.” She looked down and fidgeted with her napkin.
“Are you sure?” They should have established the terms earlier. “Because I could—”
She eyed him cautiously. “Correct. He”—
“I will,” she replied. “I promise.”
“Fuck, Draco,” he calls out as this Draco fellow releases his lips and licks along Harry’s neck. He pauses briefly to nip at a tender spot behind Harry’s ear.
It was truly bizarre, however, to use the phone to dial Granger. But she had given him her number, and she’d asked him to keep in touch.
“Ohhhhh,” he sighed. Every sound, every touch, amplified. The slick slide of skin against skin, the low creaking of the bed, Harry’s chest pressed against him, the brush of stubble against his chin creating a delicious burn.
Draco nodded. “Crystal. So, he really doesn’t remember?”
Harry couldn’t be certain how long he’d been confined to his room. The days and nights blurred together, and his initial rage had dwindled to a state of apathy.
Draco skipped his customary morning shower in favour of the much faster Cleaning Charms. He dressed quickly and headed out the door.
“Do I get one of those?” Harry asks.
This is all the Malfoy boy’s fault. He’s all Harry talks about. Draco this, Draco that, prattling on and on about his car and films. I don’t know why he works that job—it’s hardly respectable. He comes from money, I can tell by his clothing, his accent, the way he looks down at me and my home. Perhaps he’s doing it to get a rise out of his parents? If that’s the case, I don’t know that I want him around my Harry. My sweetums is rather impressionable, and he needs positive influences.
Draco took a sip of his tea—it was scalding hot. He swallowed hard. The burning sensation travelled down into his stomach merging with the knots already there. The desire to flee was overwhelming. “Well, if that’s what you wanted to say… I appreciate your gratitude.” He pushed his tea aside and rose.
“Penny for your thoughts?”
Work at a cinema? Not something Lucius Malfoy would do. Study Muggle medicine? Not what Lucius would do. Give up magic and live as a Muggle? Draco hoped his chosen lifestyle had the man seething in Azkaban.
“I’d like to thank you. For rescuing me… and for healing me.”
The next room is the billiard room. The tree is larger than the one in the lounge and very simply decorated: fairy lights that twinkle and an assortment of picture frame ornaments.
“I’m afraid time is of the essence.” Dumbledore gently tapped his fingers together. Both hands were whole, as if he’d never put on the cursed ring.
Draco arrived home, still fuming, and paced the flat. He picked up Harry’s letter and studied the ♡H. He was beyond reach. But that didn’t mean Draco couldn’t help him. There was still a mystery to unravel—the swirling mass pulsating inside Harry’s head. How had it gotten there? What caused it?
*	*	*
"Well, Arthur, blackmail is such a strong word," Dumbledore replied, his eyes twinkling a bit more than they had been. "I merely pointed out to Cornelius that it wouldn't look good for him or his re-election chances if it had reached the Daily Prophet that he had denied St. Mungo's and Hogwarts very generous bequests, not to mention the bequest that sets aside a large amount of galleons and land for the creation of a home for wizarding orphans."
“You will need to speak Parseltongue to open the door,” Salazar said.
A tapping at a nearby window got the attention of Cormac, who grinned and opened the window to admit the large barn owl that was perched on the windowsill with a scarlet red envelope in its’ possession.  When Bill saw it, he worried that his mother might have seen the Prophet by now and thought, ‘Please don’t let that be for me,’ knowing that if it was, there was no way he’d be able to get out of the common room to a more private place before it exploded on its’ tirade.
“Of course not, I’m a Gryffindor.”
Nick was, of course, going to say old, but thought better of it.
Harry was quite relieved to be honest when Dumbledore said that he'd be taking over the group. While he had learned to deal with the position of teacher for the group, he had always felt that he really wasn't adequately qualified to be teaching his fellow classmates. The fact that Dumbledore, who was the most powerful wizard in the world, would be taking over as teacher was a relief to Harry and he looked forward to the group's meetings because he was sure that Dumbledore would probably teach them some very potent defensive spells which would come in handy in the war.
“Now, you must all speak the incantation in unison, so I’m going to ask you to practice with a much simpler spell first, before we move on.  Now, why don’t you try the Flower Conjuring spell, Orchideous?”
“Yeah, it is,” Bill confirmed after he did some quick calculating of his own.  As a pureblood wizard, Bill’s knowledge of Muggles was a bit obscure, but one thing that he did pick up while working at Gringott’s was the exchange rate between British pounds and Wizard galleons; one galleon is equal to five pounds.
“Ron, you are very lucky,” Harry said.
“I remember posing for this,” Matthew said, said clearing his throat and drying his eyes.  “Dad was so proud of me.  Mum, on the other hand, well, she was proud, but at the same time, she wasn’t.”
The professors all did a double take as they looked up at the coach’s driver’s seat and saw that the driver had no head on its’ shoulders.
"Where did you go to school?"  Nicolas asked as they got into the carriage.
“And how are you doing today?” the smooth voice asked.
*	*	*
Draco nodded as he entered the palace and took in the sight around him.  Despite the cold and desolate look of the land outside, the palace was a truly beautiful place.  Draco stepped forward towards the large doors to the throne room and they swung open as he neared them.  Looking into the large room, Draco could see Valshar, Lord of the Dead, sitting in his throne at the far end of the room, the numerous shackles and chains that bound him glinting in the torchlight.
Harry Potter and the Return of the Heirs
Finally, Filch realized what was making the noise.  He pointed up towards the sky over the Quidditch pitch and exclaimed, “Look!”
“I know and that’s why I was so happy when I found out that Hogwarts allowed professor and student relationships if the student was seventeen or older,” Nick said.
“Where am I supposed to find something like that?  And how am I supposed to get it once I do?”
“You know him, Bill?”  Nick asked.
“Well, then, Michael, Damien, you leave me no choice,” Adrian said.  “Since it’s obvious that nothing I’ve said about teamwork and good sportsmanship has registered with you, you’re both off the team!  So are you two,” Adrian said as he pointed at Crabbe and Goyle.  “I refuse to have players on my team who think its okay to attack their teammates.”
“Knew?”  Ryan prompted, noticing Bill’s use of the past tense.
“Yes, I like a Slytherin,” Harry said.  “I know, Godric, you’ve decided to hate all Slytherins because you insist on blaming Salazar for Alaric’s death, even if you have an equal share in the blame.  At any rate, I like Draco and nothing you say is going to change my mind.”
"I'm sure I speak for everyone here," Aberforth said, "when I say we could use some good news after the bomb you just dropped on us.  So spill it, Albus."  Aberforth Dumbledore didn't usually speak during the Order meetings, choosing to just quietly observe, but he decided to make an exception this time.
“Okay, let’s head back up the castle, everyone,” Adrian said.  “I’ll try to get a decision about Mr. Waters today.  With nobody but Professor Dumbledore and Madam Hooch knowing beforehand when the games will be played, I really want to wrap this up as soon as possible so that we can all start training as a team.”
"Because he was arrested after using the Killing curse on Narcissa," Dumbledore said as he entered the room.
“Are you saying I have morning breath?”
Madam Hooch paused for a moment, and then added, “There has been some concern that some students in this school might send word to the Death Eaters about the scheduling change.  The Headmaster and I sincerely hope that no student would ever do such a thing, but we aren’t taking any chances.  Until today’s game is over, all of the Floos and all outgoing owls will be being monitored.  If any student is caught telling any outside source, even if it isn’t a Death Eater, about the scheduling change, they will receive detention with Mr. Filch every night for the rest of the term and 500 points will be taken from their house.  That is all, thank you, and I will see you at the pitch this evening.”
“Draco was attacked during the Quidditch game today,” Aarik answered.  “The word is out that Draco and I are together and I guess some of his teammates don’t like that very much.  Crabbe and Goyle both hit Bludgers at Draco.  He got out of the way fast enough to miss the one from Goyle, but Crabbe’s grazed his foot and broke his toe.”
“He’s not my father.”
“Of course, Master Justin,” Dobby answered as he bowed and popped out.
“Is there no way to get around the pact?”  Professor Dumbledore asked.  “I think the recent battle in Inverness proves that Britain needs all the help it can get in this war against Voldemort.”
"What's wrong, Draco?"
"Oh sweet Merlin's beard," Elphias Doge spoke up.  "What could possibly be worse than that?"
Tracey and Daphne smiled and came over to stand behind Adrian, who now said, “For Beaters, I must say I did not really care for your tactics Mr. Pelphrey,” Adrian pointed to a fourth-year boy with black hair.  “I value good sportsmanship and I don’t believe that you have a grasp of that, so you can go.  As for the rest of you, you all played well, but I think Mr. Delaney and Mr. Byrne were the better players.  Welcome to the team guys.  Miss Atkins, should I need a temporary replacement for either Mr. Delaney or Mr. Byrne, I’ll definitely keep you in mind.”
“I’m sorry you feel that way, Ronald,” Hermione said, hoping that she would be able to make him see reason without going as far as she was prepared to go.  Of course, this was Ronald Weasley and she knew that he was a blockhead at the best of times.  So be it.  “Until you are willing to put your anger aside and trust Harry’s judgment, I’m afraid I can’t be with you anymore.”
“Who are you?”  Dumbledore demanded in his most commanding voice.
“Yes, Harry Potter, sir?”  Dobby asked, as he popped in.
"It isn't Charlie either," Harry finally spoke up.
“Happy Christmas,” Ryan said with a smile, before following Kevin, Stephen, Michael, and Anthony out of the room.
“Helga charmed that,” Rowena said.  “She was always very proud of it.”
“I don’t think a relic of one of the four founders falls into the useless junk category, Zacharias,” Hermione admonished.
“Morning Harry,” Ryan said with a smile.
To be continued.
“What will be strange?”  Harry asked.
“Yes, Rufus, it is,” Dumbledore said.
*	*	*
"Exactly. Tonks, Kingsley and I make sure the other Aurors don't come after you, but as far as the Ministry is concerned you are still a Death Eater and they don't know that you're working as a spy."
Placing his hand on the nearest workstation, Bill said, “Susan Bones and Mandy Brocklehurst.”
Meanwhile, Matthew, Oliver, and Corelian were in the Headmaster’s Office with Dumbledore and McGonagall, preparing to leave for the Ministry.
Colin nodded, before heading upstairs to his dorm to collect the book for Ryan, as McGonagall looked around at all the gathered students and said, “All right, all of you back to what you were doing, the shows over.”
“Ah, okay,” said Godric.  “Any strapping young Gryffindor boys you have your eye on then?”
By J.C. Vascardi
“Early? Harry, it’s almost eleven o’clock in the morning,” Hermione admonished. “Professor McGonagall will be here in about five minutes to help the sixth years with their schedules.”
“He’s Harry’s number one fan,” Seamus said.  “He’s asked me on more then one occasion for information on Harry, but I’ve never told him anything.”
“What does Draco think he’s doing?” she practically yelled as she sat in front of a mirror fixing her hair.  “How could he possibly want to take Blaise to the Ball instead of me?”
Well, my dorm mates are starting to stir now, so I should stop writing and put my journal away.  The last thing I need is for Ron to see this entry about Malfoy.  If he saw that I was showing him even the slightest bit of compassion, he’d probably insist I go see Madame Pomfrey, because I’m sure he’d think there was something seriously wrong with my brain.
"Now, to return you to the Land of the Living," Valshar said, as he again turned to one of the guards and said, "Summon the Dullahan and prepare the coach!"
Bill then began to walk around the classroom to inspect the potions, starting with Ron and Blaise’s. “Not bad, but not good either,” Bill said as he looked at the thick purple goop in Ron and Blaise’s cauldron.
“No problem, Harry,” Hermione said as she returned the hug.  “Why don’t we go to the Room of Requirement?  Defense Arts doesn’t start for another two-and-a-half hours.”
“Well, people would still recognize me wouldn’t they?”
Katie sighed and said, “That explains a lot.  I’ve heard rumors that Colin’s photography club is a front for an unofficial Harry Potter fan club.”
“You mean you can read this?”  Severus asked.
"Try this one," Ollivander said.  "10 1/2 inches, nice and swishy, holly, with a unicorn tail core."
"So you ended up starting a year late because your birthday was only nine days after the cutoff?"
“Yes, Dad,” Alaric answered.  “I mean Voldemort.  When he helped you breed that basilisk and to place the necessary enchantments to keep it alive long enough for Tom to find it, he cast extra spells that would allow him to return to the Chamber upon Tom’s arrival.  He killed the rooster, imprisoned Tom under the Dark Arts prison version of the Time Suspension charm, and then assumed Tom’s identity.”
"Yes, I know about them," Ryan said as he stepped out of the fireplace. "I've known since yesterday."
“That’s just it,” Zach said.  “I know he isn’t.  William Hufflepuff told me that he came into Helga’s quarters earlier and left almost immediately.  He said he was clearly very upset and in tears when he left.”
"Yet, you still showed emotion when you saw these little beasts," Lucius said as he kicked the smallest of the puppies, which whimpered loudly at the contact.
The boy drank his water and the house-elf then began to feed the boy spoonfuls of the broth.  If Voldemort was angry that the house-elf was helping the boy, he didn’t say anything.  Once the broth was gone, the house-elf grabbed the empty tray from the table and left.
“See, Pansy?”  Tracey asked, as she pointed at the magical mirror.  “Even your reflection thinks you should give up on Draco.”
“I think Draco probably knows why,” Ryan said as he looked over at the blond.  “He was at Cromwell Hall the day that my Uncle Charles told Matt, Oliver, him, and me a bit more about my late grandmother’s life at Hogwarts.”
“My pleasure, Ryan,” Helga said as she too left Salazar’s frame.
*	*	*
*	*	*
Blaise has suspected it for awhile, but earlier this evening he finally got the proof to back up his suspicions:  he knows that I like Harry Potter.
Harry opened the door and the four students walked into Dumbledore’s office, which hadn’t really changed much since Harry was last in the room.
"Yes, Ryan, I'm sure," Frances said. "I was going into the room to change the sheets, as she is usually downstairs in her laboratory by now. When I went in I found her still in bed. I thought it was rather odd, so I got a little closer and that's when I realized that she wasn't breathing."
Matt took a moment to smile up at Oliver as he set his wand on the nightstand and mouthed the words, "I love you." Matt just grinned at Oliver, before returning to the task at hand. Grabbing the waistband of Oliver's boxers in his teeth, Matt began to slowly pull them down. Freed from the confining material, Oliver's manhood sprang up and hit his abdomen. The underwear, followed shortly there after by Oliver's t-shirt, soon joined the growing pile of discarded clothes on the floor near the bed.
“On this extremely rare journey, one I only make every 1,000 years, I am not here for the usual purpose of retrieving a soul for the journey to Tartarus.  By the order of my master Valshar, the Lord of the Dead, who has granted me more speech than normal, I am here to return five people back to the Land of the Living from the clutches of death itself.”
To be continued...
While the second group went to Honeydukes Sweetshop, the first group went to Gladrags Wizardwear.  Professor Dumbledore had informed the proprietress of the shop ahead of time about the Halloween Ball, and she in turn ordered a wide selection of the very latest styles of formal attire.
By J.C. Vascardi
“A few short months?” Ryan asked. “Does that mean that you and Matt have set a date?”
“Hmm, well, I suppose that does make sense.  It is rather hard to find something when you don’t even know it’s there.  I suppose the founders could even have laid some sort of magic into the rooms to make it so that the heir had to know it existed before they could find it.  Headmistress Derwent knew of the possibility that the rooms existed, but never found anything because she wasn’t an heir.”
"Well, I'll see you later, grandmother," Nicolas said. "I suppose we should be getting to the carriages and up to the school."
“I assure you it wasn’t destroyed,” Corelian said.  “It’s still a thriving kingdom.”
“And how exactly do you know Mr. Cromwell’s father?”
Snape looked like he was about to unleash a scathing comment on Asheera, but Draco held up a hand to his godfather and said, “Sev, chill.  What’s done is done and while I appreciate that you care so much, it’s my life and it was my decision to risk it.  It’s not as if Asheera sent me unprepared.  In case you hadn’t noticed my attire, these are Atlantean battle robes.  Nothing particularly special about them, but they cover a full suit of mythril plate armor.”
“First you call me by my first name,” Harry said. “Then you apologize to me. Forgive me, but I never thought I’d live to see either of those things happening.”
“You got me a gift?”  Zach asked.  “Now I feel bad because I didn’t get you anything.  I tried, but I figured what could I possibly get for the boy who already has too much of everything?”
Percy, despite his horrid behavior the previous year, had at that point been accepted back into the family. After Lord Voldemort had been spotted in person at the Ministry of Magic by Cornelius Fudge and over a dozen Aurors, Percy really had no choice but to admit that he'd been a stupid fool for acting the way he had been for the last two years and had finally come to realize that family was very important. It pained him to know that he had caused the rift by taking the Ministry's side instead of his family's, who were right all along.
"My grandmother is the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher here," Nicolas answered.
I’m not sure how my friends would react if I told them that I wanted to stop fighting with Malfoy.  Hermione might be willing to give him a chance, but I know that being called a Mudblood really did hurt her.  I know that Ron would be totally, one hundred percent, against ending the rivalry with Malfoy.  I don’t think there is anything that Malfoy could do that would ever convince Ron that he isn’t a slimy git and evil Slytherin bastard; of course, I’m not totally convinced that he isn’t yet myself.  One night spent comforting him while he cried and having a civil conversation for an hour after that doesn’t really make up for five years worth of fights and insults.
Ryan, Hermione, Harry, and Justin were all a little too eager to see Helga’s quarters that they momentarily forgot the requirement that the heir invited them in and they were all abruptly stopped by an invisible barrier when they tried to cross the threshold.
“Yes,” Severus said as he gazed at Asheera speculatively.  “That was some fancy spell work you exhibited and without a wand.”
Lily and James looked at one another for a few moments, before James spoke, "Draco, your love for our son must be great indeed for you to have undertaken death itself for our stead.  I realize that you also saved your mother from death, but you didn't have to save me, Lily, or even Cedric, yet you did."
“I was against Professor Dumbledore adding fencing and archery to the offerings, but he didn’t listen to me.  They’re such violent classes which will probably cause their fair share of injuries.  I realize we’re at war, but still.  Oh well, Professors Lasinius and Firenze have assured me that they’ll be using dulled blades and arrows with rounded heads for now, so I guess there won’t be too many injuries.  You’re free to go, Mr. Malfoy, just be careful.  I was able to fix your nose this time, but each successive break makes it harder to fix, even with magic.”
“We’re prefects,” Justin said as he adjusted his robes so that his prefect badge was more clearly visible.
"Hello boys," Charles said with a smile.
“You know, Draco,” Asheera said, “I may have an idea.  You want to give Aarik an extra special gift, right?  Well, how about something that all the money in the world can’t buy and the magic of all living wizards and witches cannot produce?”
“Acromantula venom and ground basilisk tooth.”
“Sure, what do you want?”  Harry asked, after looking at Hermione, who nodded.
Harry and Ryan then set to work casting cleaning charms and vanishing the dust and cobwebs.  After about twenty minutes, the room looked much better then it had.  Rowena’s portrait smiled at Ryan and said, “Much better.  Now, did you want to clean up the other rooms or did you want to see about finding out the identities of the other heirs?”
“I didn’t know, either, Rufus, until recently,” Dumbledore said.  “It seems that the founders’ portraits were all in their private living quarters.  Only their heirs are capable of entering them and giving others permission to do so, so it was not known that the founders’ portraits existed until each heir was found and in turn found their portraits.”
"Draco, you will do as I say," Lucius said in a cold and unfeeling tone.  "That runt is the weakest, and therefore must be exterminated.  It's survival of the fittest.  The same goes for us, Draco.  It’s our duty, as purebloods, to exterminate all those who are weaker than us.  That means Muggles, Half-Bloods and Mudbloods."
*	*	*
“Well, his portrait,” Harry amended.  “As his heir, I’m the only one who can open his private quarters.  I did and I met his portrait.  He’s furious with Salazar, but then again, Salazar is equally furious with him, so it’s not fun getting the two of them in the same frame.”
As if on cue, the owl post chose that moment to arrive.  Sunday mornings rarely brought much mail, but those who had subscriptions to the Daily Prophet were guaranteed to have mail regardless of the day.  A large barn owl dropped Hermione’s copy in front of her.  After unfurling the paper, she choked on her orange juice as she gasped at the headline.
“So as your heir, does that mean that Ryan owns Raven Hill?”  Nick asked.
Harry’s Journal – September 4, 1996
"Who're you talking to Hermione?" a raven-haired boy said as he walked up, along with two red-heads.
‘Just lovely,’ Draco thought, ‘a dance, which Pansy will undoubtedly use as a way of trying to get into my pants again.  Honestly, what part of ‘I’m gay’ doesn’t she understand?  Oh Merlin, Harry looks so hot.  In a perfect world, I’d be going with him, but then again, in a perfect world, my mother would still be alive and we wouldn’t be at war with a psychotic bastard.  Why does life have to be so bloody unfair?’
“Welcome to my quarters,” Slytherin said.  “Who have you brought with you?”
Godric’s demeanor got very imposing, as if he was trying to scare Harry, and growled out, “Again who are you to talk to me that way, boy?”
By this point, total silence filled the room.  Bubbles were still emerging from Colin’s mouth, but he had run out of secrets by this point, so nothing more was said as each popped.  Everyone just stood there, not exactly sure what to do, until a moment later Professor McGonagall came in.  The Fat Lady had heard Molly’s screaming, even if she couldn’t make out exactly what was said, and went to get Professor McGonagall.
“What about Ryan’s other question?”  Justin asked.
“What?”  Slytherin asked.  “Nickolas, is this atrocity true?”
Draco’s Journal – September 25, 1996
"Very true,” Draco agreed. “Oh well, let’s just fuck.”
“It’ll be okay, honey,” Justin said as he rested his chin on Ryan’s shoulder and wrapped his arms tightly around his boyfriend’s waist.
"Their caskets?"  Ollivander asked, his tone clearly indicating his belief that he hadn't heard Dumbledore correctly.
Dating a professor had certain advantages, one of them being that unlike the last visit to the Headmaster’s office, time did not have to be wasted trying to guess Dumbledore’s password, because Bill knew it.
“Stop it, stop it, stop it!” a voice cried out.
‘Oh Ryan looks so cute when he’s thinking,’ Justin thought as he grinned from ear to ear.  ‘I’m as sure as I’ve ever been about anything in my life that he’s the one, so I hope he’ll agree to go to the dance with me.  Now that I know that the Wizarding World doesn’t care about same-sex pairings, I’m ready for the whole world to know I’m with Ryan.  Well, at least the Wizarding World.  My parents are a different story because I know they’ll be furious.  Probably best to wait until I’m legal before I tell them because I’m sure they’ll disown me.’
“There was also a listing for a Cedric Jeremiah Dig in the book,” Ryan added.  “Professor Weasley was with Nick and me when we saw the clue and he said that he thought that was possibly Cedric Diggory.”
“What other reason would there be?”
“Well, Harry, or should I say Aarik,”  Dumbledore said, “the reason your Hogwarts letters say Harry Potter is because I changed your student records to say Harry Potter instead of Aarik Potter.”
“Trust me; if anything gets started it’ll be Malfoy starting it.”
“Well, Ryan, now I can.  You see until you found this room, the magic that hid it from view also prevented me from visiting any other portraits and other portraits from visiting me.  Of course, after all the time that’s passed, I assume the only portraits left in this castle that would even know I’m here are Godric, Helga and Salazar’s portraits.  Tell me, have their quarters been found?”
Harry smiled at Bill as he removed the charms from his door. Harry wrapped the cloak around him, and then snuck out of the room ahead of Bill.
“Is something wrong, Valen?”  Dumbledore asked.
After several moments of silence, Dumbledore peered at the younger man over his half-moon spectacles and said, “Severus, I swear to you, if there’s a way to break the power of that fiend’s Mark, we will find it.”
"Well, Harry said it was one of your brothers Ron," Hermione said, "and he clearly said it wasn't Fred, George, or Percy, so it has to be either Bill or Charlie."
Arriving in the hospital wing, Asheera rolled up her sleeves and strode forward, ready to help however she could.
Filch nodded as he hurried into the castle.  Dumbledore and McGonagall both drew their wands as they watched the coach get closer.  Professors Snape, Flitwick, Vector, Sinistra, and Sprout soon joined Dumbledore and McGonagall on the front steps of the castle, their wands drawn.
“Technically, you are Rowena’s heir, Matt, but I’m the recognized heir since I found her quarters.”
"Ah, Kingsley, good to see you," Charles said.  "If you'd be so kind, as to make sure that Lucius gets to Azkaban for torturing his son and killing his wife, I would appreciate it."
“Just a quiet family holiday for me,” Anthony said.  “It’s just my mom and dad, so, it’ll be far less chaotic than Mike’s holiday.”
"Oh please, Oliver," Ryan said. "It doesn't take much to figure it out. I mean, we are in Matt's bedroom and you were showering in his bathroom. The bed is turned down on both sides, the sheets are rumpled, and it's obvious that two people ate breakfast in bed this morning. Of course, the clincher is that I heard the two of you on my way down to breakfast this morning."
Everyone laughed at Draco’s comment and the six students settled into a companionable conversation as they continued to eat breakfast.  Rowena spent quite a bit of time watching them from her frame, happy that she had at last been found and was no longer having to spend her time alone.  She was also looking forward to the day when the other quarters were found, as she then would be able to visit and talk with her old friends and fellow founders.
“Well, for now I think I’ll keep it so that only I can open the door.”
“Hey, only Matt has permission to call me that,” Oliver said as the four of them left Matt and Oliver’s quarters and headed for the Ravenclaw hallway.
“So, what did you want to talk about?”
*	*	*
As the Sorting Ceremony ended, Professor McGonagall put away the scroll listing the new students and the Sorting Hat, before returning to her seat. Professor Dumbledore stood up and said, "I'm sure all you are hungry, so while there is a time for speeches and announcements, now is not it, so tuck in!" All of the empty serving platters on the tables magically filled with food and the students and teachers begin to fill their plates.
“So you are really Slytherin’s heir?”  Snape asked.
By J.C. Vascardi
Shortly after the bell rang to signal the end of the period, Professor McGonagall said, “Class dismissed.  Creevey you will stay after class for a moment.”
“What about you two?”  Ryan asked, looking at Anthony Goldstein and Michael Corner.
I am so glad to be away from the Dursleys, although I am a little mad that the portkey took me to Grimmauld Place instead of the Burrow. It's hard to be back in this house now that Sirius is dead. I suppose I should at least be thankful that Kreacher hasn't shown up, because if I saw him right now, I'd get in big trouble. Not only for underage wizardry away from school, but also for using an Unforgivable, because I think I'd Avada Kedavra that wretched elf on sight. I know Hermione would frown upon that, but he deserves it after his betrayal.
“You’d actually take points from your own house?”
"Yes, well, Matthew if being with Oliver makes you happy, then so be it. Welcome to the family, Oliver. Barin!"
“That’s the strange part,” Ryan answered, “because I could have sworn the last time I saw it was two nights ago when I locked it in my trunk.”
“One moment, I’ll check,” the secretary said as she stood, knocked on the Minister’s door, and went in.  A few minutes later, she came back and said, “The Minister will see you now.”
"I didn't say it was worse, Elphias," Dumbledore pointed out.  "In fact, the other news I have to share is quite good.  One might even go so far as to call it miraculous."
Matt looked at Oliver with a questioning look and Oliver just shrugged and said, “Well, there’s no harm in playing along with him.”
Add one clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir.
“Yes, well, Salazar didn’t intend to give Voldemort the chance to turn Earth into the Tenth Hell either,” countered Harry, “but it is what might happen, nonetheless.  My point in this, Godric, is that your feud with Salazar has come at a very high price for many, many people and ultimately it might mean the destruction of not only the Wizarding world but also the Muggle world.  Don’t you think it’s time that you end it?”
“What did you mean earlier when you said you liked me?”  Draco asked.
At that moment, a silvery gray mist appeared near the Gryffindor table as Alaric appeared and said, “Hello Aarik.  Colin is in the common room of Gryffindor Tower, if you want to talk to him and find out if he’s behind this.”
“I will thank you not to insult my intelligence,” Rufus said.  “Of course I wouldn’t believe those experts, because in both cases it’s well documented that their claims are false.  I believe the experts the
"Yes, Master Ryan. Just sit out in the dining room. It will be out soon."
“You are correct, Zacharias, I am Helga Marie Hufflepuff,” Helga answered.  When she saw the questioning look on the boy’s face, she added, “You all stood there looking around long enough that Rowena managed to come and fill me in.”
Rowena nodded and said, “Well, Matthew, Oliver, please snap out of it.  As you can see Ryan is my heir and as unbelievable as that may be to you, standing there with your mouths open and not saying anything isn’t going to change it.”
“This must be a mistake,” Hermione said as she read over the list of names a third time.  “It says that Tom Marvolo Riddle is only sixteen years old.  That’s impossible.”
Adrian was soon writhing on the ground in pain, screaming, as the bone-melting pain of the Cruciatus Curse coursed through his body.  It was the first time he had ever felt the curse and it only served to reinforce his resolve to never use it on another living thing as long as he lived.
Everyone was looking around at the room and soon Kingsley Shacklebolt asked, “How do you keep all of the sea life out of here when all that water comes cascading in?”
"The powers of the Hells?"  Kingsley asked.  "Albus, what are you saying?"
“Well, of course I’m in the book, Nick, I’m an heir.  Of course, it’s possible my name isn’t visible yet.”
*	*	*
“Where is Raven Hill?”  Nick asked.
“Okay, Harry, have a good night.”
“Aarik James Potter,” Harry said, deciding to use his real name for the formal introduction to Godric.  “I’m your last living heir.”
Lady Asheera Laitannen’s brother, Lord Valen Jorian Lasinius, is purportedly teaching a Fencing class for sixth and seventh year students at Hogwarts this year.  No record of Ministry approval of the course, or of the school getting parental permission for the minor students enrolled in the class, could be found by print time.  For more information on the other unapproved classes being taught at Hogwarts this year, see page 6.
“Yes, Ronald, I’m breaking up with you.”
“Something wrong, Zach?”  Aarik asked.
“Donate some blood,” Dumbledore answered.  “Salazar said that the potion would require a few drops of blood from someone in Voldemort’s service.  I know that you are technically in my service, but you are a marked Death Eater, so, your blood will fit the bill.  We will also need to make use of your brewing skills.  You may not be the Potions professor anymore, but you are a certified Potions Master, unlike Professor Weasley.”
Voldemort conjured a table and chairs in the center of the room, and laughed as the boy began crawling towards it.  He was getting dirtier from the dirt on the floor and his robe ripped when it caught on a loose brick in the floor with a jagged edge.
“Why?”
*	*	*
“Cut the crap, Malfoy.  Everyone knows you’re a junior Death Eater in training.”
“Yes, he told me.  Of course, I know what my wand’s core element is and how long it’s been in use.  It really isn’t my fault that your machine isn’t up to date, although, it isn’t really your fault either.  The blame lies with King Erevan’s father and grandfather, I’m afraid.  Their Majesties King Tyriand and King Isulus were both highly xenophobic and isolated the kingdom from the rest of the world long before even the founders of Hogwarts were born.”
“Well, the last name that could be read started with a ‘Z’,” Nick said.
Within moments, Corelian, Matthew, and Oliver vanished from sight as Corelian made the three of them invisible and then Apparated them out of the office to the dingy street that the Visitor’s Entrance was located on.  Seeing nobody around, Corelian lifted the invisibility spell and the three of them walked over to the broken-down red telephone box.
Harry's Journal - August 22, 1996
“Yes,” Corelian answered, “provided that King Erevan agrees.  And you should be thankful, Ryan, of the fact that I am the Supreme Lord of the Circle and the elder brother of Queen Calliara, because King Erevan has already agreed to allow you to sponsor a total of five non-Atlantean couples, one of which can be Matthew and Oliver, and then four other couples of your choice.”
“So, who are the other members of the Circle?”  Ryan asked.
When he was sure that Ryan was out of earshot, he smiled said quietly, “He certainly has turned into a well-rounded and capable young man since I saw him last.”
“Yes, Albus,” Poppy answered.  “Though I only brought one of each.”
“Yes, Delaney, I will be.”
“Yes, I am,” answered Hermione.
Fourth-year Gryffindor Romilda Vane asked, “Aren’t you going to do anything to Harry for attacking Colin, Professor Weasley?”
Pansy looked stricken, to which Adrian just grinned and said, “I think it best that I be the only one who can ask the questions.  I’m sure you understand, Pansy.  If not, well, then I can always give you detention with Filch for interfering in official Head Boy business and you know that Professor Snape will believe me over you.”
Chapter Ten
“You broke up with your boyfriend because of me?”  Draco asked.
Knowing that they could do nothing against Asmodeus, Belial bowed and said, “My lord, Fierna and I willingly submit ourselves to whatever punishment you, in your infinite wisdom, think is best.”
It was Bill, who helped Harry come to terms with them.  Once their letters got personal, Bill felt that he should be totally honest with Harry, and told him that he was gay.  Reading those words on the parchment was an experience that Harry would probably never forget, and he felt like a weight had somehow been lifted off of his shoulders.  He no longer felt alone in the world, and it wasn't long, with Bill's help, that Harry accepted the fact that he was gay.  It also wasn't long afterward, that Bill's visits to Privet Drive became more frequent.  The Dursleys were none too pleased with Harry for having a frequent visitor, much less a wizard. However, despite any qualms they may have had about it, they were afraid that if they told the man Harry introduced as Bill, to leave and never come back, that they'd be getting a visit from that strange old man with the spinning eye.
Adrian motioned for the ten students under his care to follow him and they went over to talk to the distraught tavern keeper.  Adrian talked to her in hushed tones for a moment, before she nodded and led them behind the bar and through the door to her office.
After several moments of silence, Asmodeus said, “I’m sure you both know why I’ve brought you before me? Voldemort, lesser devil or not, was a denizen of the realm that you rule by my decree. You failed to prevent him from journeying to Earth and you failed to tell me that he had done so. He obviously used some very powerful disguising magic to hide the fact that he had left the Hells from me for as long as he has.”
"What do you mean until recently they were dead?"  Ollivander asked.  "That sounds as if you're trying to imply that they were dead, but aren't anymore, and I'm sorry, Albus, but I am a wandmaker.  As such, I'm very well versed in both wand lore and what they're capable of doing and restoring the dead to life as anything but an Inferius is not something a wand can do.  And Inferi don't need wands, so I know you didn't call me to sell wands to any."
“Now, Ryan, we’re not in class,” Oliver reminded. “You needn’t call me Professor. I’ll be your cousin-in-law in a few short months.”
“You are now looking at the City of Atlantia,” King Erevan said.  “Also known as the Jewel of Atlantis.  The city is, by far, the largest with a population of just under ninety million souls.  It is impossible to see the entire continent from this vantage point, but, I should hope that it isn’t necessary.  As you can clearly see, there is a thriving city beneath your feet, completely underwater, protected by the ancient shields created by Poseidon himself.”
At this point, Dumbledore took a moment to explain Sirius’ true fate to those present who had not been present when the true nature of the Veil of Baazlebul had been learned.
“Damn, 500 plus years?”  Matt asked, clearly shocked.  “Wow.  That’s quite awhile.”
“If it’s true,” Harry said, “and my name actually is Aarik Potter, then that means that I’m Gryffindor’s heir.”
"You'd better not even try Cedric," Draco said with a grin.  "Or you'll be on your way back to Tartarus so fast you won't know what hit you."
"Hi Nick," Ryan said as he recognized the voice of Nicolas Delaney.
As Ryan stepped towards the doors, he couldn’t help but sneeze from all the dust and turning back to Rowena’s portrait, he said, “In a moment.  I think I’ll just cast those cleaning charms you mentioned first.  All this dust is making me sick.”
“Ah, I take it you didn’t hear that part of the conversation,” Corelian responded.  “Your grandparents changed your name when I left you in their care sixteen years ago.  Your name at birth, however, was Kyrian Corelian Laitannen.”
“I appreciate the honesty, Draco,” Harry said.  “And no, you haven’t scared me off.  I’m a Gryffindor, remember?”
“I seriously doubt that, Justin,” Oliver said.
*	*	*
“Good, then if you could be so kind, please show Ryan and his guests to the bedrooms.  Please give Ryan the large room at the end of the hall, as he is now master of these quarters and it is only fitting that he has the master bedroom.”
Asheera got thoughtful for a moment, as if thinking, but Salazar beat her to the punch.
“So?  You’ve never pushed me away before when I’ve tried to show you affection during your study sessions.”
“But it is my business,” Colin said.  “It’s everybody’s business.”
“I think your brother is coming, Calli,” King Erevan said with a smile.
“My, my, this place really does need cleaning, doesn’t it?”  Helga asked as she looked around.  “I can scarcely believe that it’s really been so long, but Rowena tells me that it’s been over a thousand years since we died.”
“Yes, I can see how it would.  I’m rather glad to be a portrait since the dust doesn’t affect me as such.  Hmm, you will have to extinguish your wand light to cast those charms, but if you light a fire in the hearth, that should provide a nice amount of light until the candles are found.  Just please be careful and make sure your wand is pointed at the fire grate and not me before you cast the charm.”
*	*	*
“Then that means that if you are descended from the Edmund Cromnvell that was born in 1500, that would make you Rowena Ravenclaw’s heir!”
“SILENCE!” Asmodeus roared. “I don’t care if he is only a lesser devil, Fierna. You are the ruler of Phlegethos. Least devil, lesser devil, or greater devil it is your job to know the comings and goings of every single denizen of your realm! You have failed me and allowed a potential threat to escape your realms. Not that I believe for a second that Voldemort can succeed in his goals, but, nonetheless, you both will pay for your failure to warn me of his flight.”
“Yes Ryan, I fear that it would be too draining.  I think in order to cast the spell you should have at least four wizards, preferably more because of your age.”
“It’s worth a shot, at least,” Justin agreed.
Professor Dumbledore had just finished reading the article in the Prophet moments before the Minister’s arrival.  Dumbledore just smiled and said, “Yes, Minister, it’s true.  Would you care for some tea?  Or a lemon drop, perhaps?”
“Fair enough, Professor Weasley,” Salazar said.  “When the time comes, I’ll make sure you have the recipe.”
“You’re wrong, Ron,” Harry said.  “I’m not under a spell and I did just offer my friendship to Draco.”
“Why use a ship?” Harry asked. “I mean, wouldn’t a portkey be more secure?”
Exiting the throne room, King Erevan and Queen Calliara led their ‘guests’ into the entry hall of the palace.  Everywhere a person looked the trappings of royalty and immense wealth could be seen.  From the fifty-foot high vaulted ceilings, to the intricate black and white marble floor.  Three of the walls were made of white marble and were capped with intricate crown moldings made of solid gold.  The fourth wall was dominated by a large mural that depicted the Olympian pantheon, each god and goddess painted in vibrant colors, with Patron Deity of Atlantis, Poseidon, and his wife, Amphitrite, at the center.
“Who are you talking about?”  Bill asked.
“I’m assuming you mean Ginny Weasley?”  Zacharias asked, as Harry and Hermione nodded.  “Why would she freak out?”
Meanwhile, in a corridor on the sixth floor, Draco Malfoy was on patrol as a part of his prefect duties.  Normally, he would be with another prefect, but tonight Ron Weasley was his assigned partner.  Obviously, the two boys were not about to work together, and they both split up as soon as possible.
*	*	*
“Anything, son,” Hannah said.
*	*	*
In other news, dear journal, I think I might stand a chance with Harry after all.  I haven’t heard it from his own lips that he’s gay, but he did seem very happy when he found out that same-sex relationships were not only accepted in the wizarding world, but that same-sex couples could legally marry and have children.  If he is indeed gay, then I suppose I can understand why he would be happy about that, since I’m sure that as an orphan he wants children.  I just pray with every fiber of my being that if Harry does have children that I will be the other father.
“Well, Valen and I only friends,” Bill said.  “So, I’m not going to hold it against him that he ran out of here but I just wonder why he took Ryan and Justin with him.”
“Oh, sorry, I forgot,” Harry said, as he motioned for the six people in the Gryffindor common room to pass through the archway and added, “Please come in.”
As if some divine entity had decided to help Draco, the answer came to him almost as soon as he’d asked the question.  Reaching into the pocket of the Atlantean battle robes that covered the mythril armor that Asheera had given him, Draco pulled out Apollo’s golden Mirror of Truth.
Damien didn’t say anything and just walked away.  Adrian wasn’t stupid enough though not to know that he needed to watch his back, regardless.
“So, you’re Gryffindor’s heir and Zacharias is Hufflepuff’s heir?”
“No offense, Albus, but will you please get to the point?”  Amos asked.  “Being in this school brings back a lot of memories of Cedric and it makes both my wife and me very sad.”
“Why, Colin?”  Harry asked.
“Well, my great-great-great-grandaunt Hepzibah Smith apparently said we were related to Hufflepuff,” Zacharias revealed.  “From what I’ve been told though, the rest of the family thought she was just a crazy old woman who only said that to justify her purchase of a cup that belonged to Hufflepuff.”
"So you're gay, Harry?" Nicolas asked, as the train began to pull out of the station.
“It’s okay to say it, father,” Alaric said.  “You suggested it while you were having sex.  Oh don’t look so shocked, while it’s true that I was only nine when I died, I’ve learned quite a bit lurking around this castle for the last thousand years and I know all about what people in love do with one another in the privacy of their bedrooms.”
“What do you mean current state of affairs?”  Godric asked.
Harry Potter and the Return of the Heirs
Aarik, who had been staring silently at his parents, suddenly jumped up and lunged at Draco.
“I was taking a walk and I heard you crying.”
Silence ensued for several minutes, until it was finally broken by Percy Weasley.  “What if Atlantis was to acquire more territory outside of the shields?”
“As long as I draw breath,” King Tyriand said, “you will never see that filthy half-breed bastard of yours ever again.  You will remain here in Atlantis where you belong and you will banish all thoughts of your bastard from your head.”
Nick was so engrossed in looking over the ingredients on the page that he didn’t notice Professor Snape coming over to stand behind him.  Looking down at the page, Severus asked, “What is this nonsense?”
“If you are meaning what Master Draco did, yes.  All house elves is talking about it.”
“Must you say his name?”  Bill asked.
“Actually, it’s not in the Royal Library,” Corelian said with a grin as he reached into an inner pocket of his robes, pulled out an extremely small book and waved his hand over it, causing it to enlarge to it’s proper size.
“Cool,” Nick said.  “Are you in the book, Ryan?”
“You found a way to protect against the Unforgivables?”  Harry asked.  “Is that why I didn’t die when Voldemort cast the Killing Curse on me when I was a baby?”
The newcomers, save one, gathered around Corelian, for they were the members of the Circle of Atlantis.  The one who stayed back was the King and Queen’s daughter-in-law, Princess Alianna, who was temporarily guarding the Cosmos sphere for Corelian.  With Corelian calling the Circle himself, she wasn’t about to presume to lead this impromptu Circle meeting.
“What happened?”  Aarik asked.
“Mythril plate armor?”  Dumbledore asked.
“There really is a good selection,” Draco commented as he eyed the racks.  “I thought for sure I wouldn’t find anything suitable, but I admit I’m pleasantly surprised.”
“Yes, Miss Granger,” Slytherin answered.
“How do you know that, Ginny?”  Harry asked.
“So you and Rowena Ravenclaw were married?”  Bill asked.
The truth was that it was the Great Hall with the same magic employed by the Room of Requirement cast upon it.  Ryan had been right in his thought that Rowena and Helga had something to do with the decorations, for the two founders had indeed gone to visit Professor Dumbledore and taught him the spells they used to create the Room of Requirement.
“Rowena, the man deserved it!”  Salazar exclaimed.  “Our son died and instead of being there for me, the man he claimed to love, he blamed me for Alaric’s death!  It was like having my heart ripped out of my chest and stomped on.  I did not kill Alaric; I could never hurt a hair on that precious boy’s head!  I loved him and I did everything I could to save him, but he still died.  I can’t tell you how many times I wished that it had been me instead of my beloved nine-year-old son!”
“Harry,” Bill said, “no, I’m not jealous of Nick and Tracey.  I trust Nick enough to not think that he’s going to spend one night with her at the Ball and decide he’d rather be with her, instead of me.”
that the founders' portraits had been found," Ollivander said in awe.  "I take it this is Helga Hufflepuff?"
"Why don't we all sit down," Charles said. "Once Ryan gets here, I'll explain what Draco is doing here. I assume Ryan knows about you and Oliver, Matthew?"
“Well, as I said the Dark Marks bind Voldemort to the Death Eaters,” Asheera answered.  “Other than the Veil of Baazlebul, the only way for living people to end up in the Hells is for one of the Lords of the Nine to summon them to the Hells and they can’t do that unless the person was born in the Hells.  So, since Voldemort is bound to hundreds of living souls not born in the Hells, Asmodeus cannot force him to return to the Hells, without also forcing all of the Death Eaters to come to the Hells, which he can’t do because they were not born there.”
“Yes, dear,” Corelian said as he waved his hand, conjured a bookstand, and then carefully placed the book on it, before opening it.  Everyone in the room gathered around the book and peered at the writing on the page.
A few moments later, Ron was scheduled to take the same classes and activities as Harry, except that he didn’t sign up for Basics of Battlefield Medicine since he didn’t have the required ‘Exceeds Expectations’ in Herbology. McGonagall said, “All right, sixth years you can go down to lunch now. Hermione, Ron, please go to the seventh-year dorms and tell them I’m ready for them and then you can join your friends at lunch.”
"Hello," Charles called as they approached.  "I'm Charles Cromwell, and this is my nephew, Ryan.  You are?"
King Erevan stood still for a moment and then said, “Calliara, my dear, I’ve had a thought.  It might be better if we take more than just Minister Scrimgeour on this tour.  While being Minister of Magic does grant him a fair of amount of influence, I question if it’s enough to convince a majority of Wizarding Britain.”
Hermione just laughed and then said, "Oh, fine, Harry. I suppose reading something is better than nothing at all. If you ever get tired of reading such things though and want to read something with a bit more substance, let me know. I'm sure I can recommend some good books."
"Yes, you should," Professor Byrne said, "and I have to get the first years into the boats. I'll see you later though. I love you, Nicolas."
"Granger is just very smart.  She really should have been in Ravenclaw instead of Gryffindor."
“Really and how did that meeting come about?”
Daphne and Ernie moved to their table, as Bill moved to the table across from Stephen and Tracey and said, “Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter.”
"I just came from your grandmother's room," Frances replied through tears. "Oh Gods, I'm so sorry!"
“Well, Ryan,” Brendan said, “I am not one of Rowena’s in-laws, nor am I her father, uncle, brother, cousin, nephew, child, or grandchild.”
"We've been keeping it a secret."
“I’m inclined to agree with Tracey and Daphne,” Millicent answered.  “You saw Draco and Blaise kiss in the common room, along with half of our house.  To be honest, that was enough proof for me that Draco was gay, but with the Virginitas charm and Veritaserum confirming it, I don’t see how there is any room for doubt about Draco’s gayness.”
Draco closed his Arithmancy book, stood up and said, “Pansy, if you are referring to the fact that you think I should ask you to the Halloween Ball, that isn’t going to happen.  I’m gay, remember?”
“That is entirely possible,” Rowena interjected.  “As Headmaster of Hogwarts, he would also be in control of the castle wards.  As such, the castle keeps him very well informed about what goes in within its walls, almost as if he were omnipresent.”
“Minerva?”  Dumbledore asked with a twinkle in his eye.  “Could you go and get Mr. Potter and Mr. Smith?  I’m sure they’d both be very interested in where Mr. Malfoy has been today.”
Harry Potter and the Return of the Heirs
Finding Tom Riddle right where he’d left him, Voldemort smiled and said, “I’ll have to kill that stupid child for lying to me. Honestly, to think that my prisoner had somehow escaped – it’s ludicrous.”
“Curse you Godric Bryant Gryffindor!”  Slytherin screamed.
“I’m sorry, Corelian, I tried.”
When Ryan and the others brought Zacharias and Justin to Rowena’s quarters, Rowena hadn’t gotten back from the Headmaster’s office yet, so Zacharias didn’t know about Rowena’s portrait.  Noticing the look of confusion on his face, Harry said, “Zach, meet Rowena Fiona Ravenclaw; Ryan’s twenty-third great-grandmother.”
“I’ll gladly add the potion to the schedule,” Bill said.  “Unfortunately, it’ll have to wait until after winter break, because my lesson plans for the rest of the term have already been finalized and every available class period for all seven years will be needed to work on those potions.  I’d simply move one of the easier ones to next term, but I just finished writing the end of term exams for all the years and I really don’t want to rewrite them.”
“A decadant chocolate cake for dessert,” Aarik said.  “I know you can’t get alcohol, since Draco and I are underage, but could you get a couple bottles of sparkling cider?”
“Ten and three-quarters inches, unicorn tail core, in use nine years; is that correct?”
Once everyone was in the library, Rowena said, “Welcome to my private library.  The book on the center table is the key to discovering the identities of the other three heirs.  Now, unfortunately time has ravaged my collection, making the books unreadable.  I died in 867 and I never expected it would take over a millennium for my heir to find my quarters and renew the preservation charms, so I only cast a charm powerful enough to last 500 years.  Fortunately, there is a spell which can reverse the ravages of the last 629 years, but it is an extremely powerful spell that requires a large output of energy, and I believe it would be too much for Ryan alone to expel without killing him.”
“I cast the Secret Revealing Charm on him,” Harry said.  “Since Colin thinks he’s entitled to blab everyone else’s secrets to the whole world, the spell I just cast is literally washing his mouth out with soap.  Every time a soap bubble escapes from his mouth, it will pop and reveal a secret that he’s been keeping about himself.”
“MARCUS AVERY, ALECTO AND AMYCUS CARROW, EDWARD CRABBE, WILLIAM GOYLE, PHILLIP PARKINSON, NATHAN BULSTRODE, DAMIEN MULCIBER, AND WALDEN MACNAIR, STEP FORWARD NOW!!” Voldemort screamed at the top of his lungs.
"Well, um, you see," Harry said, "Ron, you've known the person all of your life."
An hour passed and soon the Headmaster’s guests were all sitting in plush chintz armchairs in his office, as the Headmaster peered at them from over his half-moon spectacles.  Finally, the silence became too much for her and Molly Weasley asked, “Albus, what is going on?  You tell Arthur and me to drop everything and then I show up here to find out you have invited my entire family, Remus, and two of my neighbors.  And now you’re just sitting there being annoyingly silent!”
