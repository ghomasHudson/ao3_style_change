Poor Cho. He felt... so bad for her. Maybe it was good her and Harry were snogging. Maybe shared trauma was romantic. Who knows? Not Draco.
The nice thing about dating someone is if they start being obnoxious then you can easily shut them up by kissing them. Draco had the feeling he might employ this tactic quite a bit in the future.
"Now you're just embarrassing both of us," Draco said even though his voice broke towards the end. Maybe it was better Harry didn't see this after all. Draco was seconds away from bawling in the middle of a battle field. "You know," he said, forcing lightness, "I've literally made out with several men and this is somehow the gayest thing to ever happen to me." He informed the stag. It snorted. "Yeah, well, if you're Harry's soul from the beyond or whatever..." He tried, losing the words right as he found them. Taking a long breath he reached out - barely touching the stag's snout when his disappeared with a final burst of light.
"It's part of the job, miss," one of the wizards told her calmly and Draco laughed louder at that. "Are you two ready?" He asked, shooting Draco an irritated look. Severus only sighed again as his answer, though there was a glimmer of trouble in his eyes.
“You’re not pale so apparently you don’t need it.” Draco told him and Harry scowled before playfully grabbing at it. “That reminds me-” He started, but was cut off by Krum suddenly appearing with an apologetic smile to whisper something in Harry’s ear. He frowned.
“Yeah, I wasn’t going to say anything, but her offers are more of orders so… I guess I’ll see you soon.” Draco laughed, “That’s good though. Maybe you can see Harry more often. Bring along Padfoot?” He suggested.
“No! No, fuck you. Don’t give me that bullshit,” Theo hissed, finger trembling in front of Draco’s nose. “You can say you did it because you care. You may even think that’s why, but I’m not going to lie to myself like you do.”
"Lavender, we need to get to class," Ron said, desperately tugging on her arm. Lavender frowned, lips going into a slight pout as she looked Ron over worriedly. Draco took another bite of toast.
“You think so?” He asked. Draco frowned. He was pretty sure as the resident gay friend that if anyone in their group felt even an inkling of none hetero feelings, he would be first informed. “He stares at boys a lot.”
trying to cut him off from people who might help him?" He asked and when Dumbledore opened his mouth, held up a finger, "No. Don't deny it. It took both Sirius and Severus combined to get him out of the Dursleys' house. You rewarded him for
"Sorry," he added to him and Severus rolled his eyes. "What are you doing here?" He asked and Severus rubbed the arm he had gotten shot in absently before glancing over his shoulder at the door. Silently, he gestured them all to sit before opening his cloak to bring out an old book.
"He was... but..." Sirius murmured, looking like he had been punched in the face. Repeatedly. Draco bit his lip and rubbed his arm. He couldn't stay here. There was a war they needed to fight, but it also wasn't fair to just
Maybe if Draco was lucky... they wouldn't be parted for very long. Draco would stick around to kill Voldemort and then maybe see how many killing curses were still flying about.
“You’re taller than me.” Draco said, interrupting Harry’s spew of emotions and apologies. He blinked a few times, clearly baffled by the comment. It wasn’t by much, really. Harry was maybe an inch taller (maybe even less… it was hard to tell with all the hair). Still, Draco had
“Ah, well, that, um, you… see…” He stumbled out awkwardly, “I had… an incident…” He said slowly. Draco waited. “I thought to make it up to her I would let things go further along than usual…Only when we started getting there, I, uh...” He trailed off.
Yeah. Draco drew the line at Hermione. He wasn’t kidding around when he said she was his best friend. Which was why he decided to do some investigating the next morning when the first round of hate mail burst at their table.
"Are Uncle Ron and Aunt Hermione going to have kids?" She asked suddenly when they went out into the corridor. Draco pulled back to give her a baffled look.
Draco hugged him. He could hear the others outside, sounding antsy. Forcing himself to take a deep breath, he steadied himself. Ted hugged him back tightly, practically squeezing the air out of him as he gripped at his robes.
,” Draco told him, “It was stupid of you to just take a bloody walk with Viktor Krum in the middle of the night-”
was used to bickering with Ron and Harry. He wasn’t sure how he was going to handle Harry against Ron. They were
“Guys. Hello. Hi. Move. Sit. We must speak.” Draco said. The other three looked at him in varying states of surprise. “Don’t freak out, but…” he held up both his hands. “Future day is here.” He said and leaned in more, “And Theo and Zoe said we can come celebrate with them.”
“Yeah, we should go,” he said and pointed a finger at Harry. “Don’t get cocky. You have two more tasks to go and I’m sure you won’t be able to use a broom for both of them.” He warned. Harry held up his golden egg with a promise to be better about figuring out the next task.
Okay… this was a little weird. He shared puzzled looks with the other two as they left the quidditch pitch back towards the castle. He debated about pressing for more information, but based on McGonagall’s expression it would be no use. About three turns later, Draco realized with a cold prickling of his skin that they were heading towards the hospital wing.
Harry’s head snaps up at that and Draco grips him as hard as he can manage. “Don’t!” Merlin his voice sounds awful. Why is the room starting to spin? His back feels like a bitch…
Perfect. Now his weird Parstletoungue boyfriend can talk to their Basilisk friend. He’s sure that won’t cause any problems for anyone.
Sirius gives him a dark look, but sighs all the same. “Well, everyone knows that Dementors feed on happiness. Normal prisoners are guilty maniacs, sure, but they all enter with happy memories of loved ones or family. I had my family ripped from me by my own stupid actions and the guilt was worse than any soul-sucker. They knew I was miserable, and since I didn’t have that much happiness they didn’t bother much with me. If they did it only took a few minutes before they got bored, and sometimes I would transform into a dog just to avoid them. Funny thing is, they can’t really read the emotions of a dog and thinking about James and Lily in that headspace was enough to remind me
Draco couldn’t agree more. He almost thanks the man when the four people in front of him step away, but that's before he see Potter’s eyes widen and feels a firm hand digging into his collarbone.
at Finnegan’s story. Like he wasn’t the least bit concerned about….Draco sucks in air. Potter doesn’t know.
“Think of how blissful it will be for you and Hermione when you accept that Death and I are frequent acquaintances.”
All that effort, all that strength just bounced right back off the door, sending him tumbling down the stairs and not even
It took all of five minutes to convince Harry to go to bed, and the boy had protested even after Draco swore they would talk to Dumbledore about it first thing in the morning. Not that Draco was looking forward to seeing the man after their last tea session where he stormed out in anger. That being said, he did get the coot’s reasoning.
The smile falls away from Draco’s face at the wistful dream. If only it could be so easy to get Potter home. Whatever his father had planned hadn’t started yet, but some nagging feeling told him it wouldn’t take long. With that thought a sudden funk came over him. Completely and utterly unfair, something akin to sadness maybe? He can never spend too much time on it before Pansy notices.
“Well, what can she expect? She didn’t want anything to do with you when you started screaming, I’d say that makes her a coward.”
they learned about all that, “No need to tell her everything, the point is that they’re not good people- Mrs. Weasley?!”
It’s a repeating pattern. Theo braids Draco’s hair, the ocean messes it up. Theo puts his hair in a bun, the ocean flings the hair-tie out of Draco’s hair. Theo combs through Draco’s hair, the ocean blows the straight locks until they’re wavy once more.
“Master Blaise and Misses Pansy are here for Master Draco.” Sisily pops in to tell them. Draco runs out to the living room, not caring at all that he’s still in his pajamas.
The part he doesn’t understand is why Snape is here too, glaring at Dumbledore like one would glare at a child.
Pansy rolls her eyes, Draco’s convinced they’re going to get stuck in the back of her head one day, and turns to Millie, begging to braid her hair while Blaise moans about how unfair his life is. Snape comes into the room soon enough, giving his usual first year speech and sends them all off to bed. Draco would usually go up and demand evening tea with his godfather, but they had tea yesterday and Severus’s already told him how busy he’ll be this year. Their first tea is scheduled for Wednesday, so he just smiles and takes the smirk he gets back as a win. Then he lets Pansy kiss his cheek ‘goodnight’ and wishes her and Millie the same before following Blaise to the boy’s fourth year room.
Hermione marches up to the game of Monopoly, grabs Harry by the shirt, ignores the indignant ‘hey!’ and proceeds to give him a verbal lashing.
“Thank you,” voice abnormally loud in the quiet room, “I’m sorry for worrying you, I promise I don’t mean to.”
Lockheart says something else, pulling back despite the panic in Potter’s eyes. “Alrighty then! One!”
A shiver runs down his spine at Dumbledore’s smile. He’d managed to piss off the most powerful wizard in the world, great.
No-Potter! Absolutely not! Do you have brain cells left in that big head of yours?! Let me spell it out for you! I. Am. A.
He can hear water dripping, senses the despair of losing flight, but the joy of clear water on wings, sharpening talons on cave crystals, learning secrets by crystal light. But one by one, the snakes with wings dwindle.
to be innocent, and killing the Boy Who Lived right in front of his useless eyes. But Harry is already starting to look a bit less like a depressed lump, and Draco’s already resolved to have a large cup of coffee in the morning.
“Really? Because despite their protective nature, a Kneazle cannot withstand a Dementor for even fifteen seconds, much less a whole minute. Do you know what that tells me?”
Harry would like to believe Draco would also go all scary veela on Aunt Petunia like he did on Crouch Jr, but he’d have to beat the Weasleys to her. His family would, without a single doubt in his mind, curse Petunia until her hair turned grey. Well, all of them except Ron. Ron would just punch Dudley and let Hermione knock out his Aunt. They’d save Vernon for Mrs. Wealsey.
“Who’s side are you on?!” Snap glares, now met with two of the most persistent people he’d ever met. Even worse is the look of glee on Draco’s face. He hadn’t seen that in ages.
A lie. If he were in trouble they wouldn’t be sitting with here making smores and drinking hot coco, he would’ve been accosted the second she got home.
His friends openly gawk now, uncomfortably so, almost enough to make him wish he hadn’t told them. “It’s fine,” he reassures, “I’ll still be getting presents, and they both write frequently, I’ll have the pitch to myself, and time to get ahead of my classes. I thought it was a great idea, really.”
The castle had been as empty as he was beginning to feel, they searched every room, every nook and cranny, even the unused and locked storage cabinets. Despite all that, he couldn’t shake the feeling that Lupin had something to do with it all. Quidditch was due to begin that Saturday, and Draco couldn’t even be happy about it.
No, no he would not thank you very much, but Dumbledore is already reaching into his desk and stepping around to pour the substance into Draco’s tea and then his own cup.
It’s not quiet, per say, because Draco can hear the calming sounds of the sea, a constant tide filled with who knows what, that goes deeper than anyone imagines, that looks like a black pit blanketed in clouds. If he takes another step, surely he’ll be able to walk on that infinite darkness.
“You bloody hell will not!” Draco meets Harry’s glare with one of his own. “You’ve already almost died once tonight, and I can’t imagine you know any of the rules that come with time traveling-”
“You’re already a bloodsucking leech, Draco, you can’t do worse than you’ve already done. I’m fairly sure the first years will be coming back with angry notes from their parents.”
“So, I’ve been doing some reading, and turns out my ancestors were actually really friendly with snakes? Like, uh,” Harry’s not really sure how to demonstrate, so he makes an attempt at shrugging and does his best.
of chances and yet the idiot’s head is just popping up in places it shouldn’t be, isn’t that strange? How did his head get all the way there, without his body?! Insanity! Bloody invisibility cloaks! OH, Merlin, he has one, maybe he
Lucius gathered them up one by one, directing the Weasleys, Harry, and Draco to the floo before sending a Patronus to the creepy Malfoy Healer and draggin Arthur though.
won’t acknowledge him. And he gets it, he’d be pissed if he had an owner and owner let someone maul him, but it wasn’t like Draco
Pansy and Blaise don’t even bat an eyelash when they wake to find him and LuLu pouring over their Potions assignment, they merely sink to the floor, dragging their blankets with them, and open their own books.
“Not too far from here! A muggle saw ‘m so they don’t really know, ya know, just thought he was an ordinary criminal.”
are there. Maybe Narcissa will see them one day and take care of it, he highly doubts she’d want her son walking about with such foul reminders. And because Draco looks a little sad at the topic of conversation, Harry leans in and kisses him softly.
Draco flicks it at the desk, ruffling papers with a nonverbal wind charm. He floats the boxes of wands that didn’t work for him back into place, he even points it at himself, casting a nonverbal calming spell that settles around him like his favorite blanket.
“Headmaster,” Draco sighs, slinking down in the empty chair beside the one Dumbledore had been reading in before he stormed into the man’s office, “I respect you more than anyone in the world, I dare even say I consider you an eccentric grandfather, so please know I ask this with all the courtesy available,
“Harry?” Draco sounds a little panicked, even to his own ears, “Harry, what’s going on? I don’t speak but those hisses don’t sound particularly happy. More like Poly after Lockheart hurt her.”
The bad news is that Dumbledore didn’t know Pettigrew was alive, but apparently he never trusted the man in the first place. The good news, if you could call it that, was that Dumbledore also already knew Pettigrew was an issue.
Draco bows, honest to fucking bows. Holds out his hands like some sort of weird prince and as if that isn’t enough, Myrtle places her hand in his and giggles while he kisses it. Harry’s so fucking confused. What is this? What is he doing? Going around and kissing other people’s hands is just
His life without Pansy and Blaise? “That’s unthinkable, sir, I would never lose them over something so stupid.”
Flint gives him a nod, “Potter was the person who found him too, he’s already been taken to the headmaster, and we, that means all Slytherins, have been ordered by Snape to return to the dungeons. Christmas break might be the only thing saving our reputation now.”
“Mister Draco did do lots for a wizard who hasn’t used magic in a long time! He being setting the floors, and the stairs, and fixing the holes in the walls, vanishing the dead plants,
Realizing that he’d gotten very off topic, Draco shakes his head. “Actually, sir, I came to ask about Moaning Myrtle. Her bathroom has flooded, and I had no idea about her until Pansy told me, but I’d like to know the full story.”
It was supposed to be something to look forward to, an early lesson to kick start his project, but what he found out is that Poppy is the hardest teacher in the whole school. No questions until she’s done talking, and yes, Draco did try to interrupt her and that’s exactly how he ended up covered in yellow goo on his way to Potions because he didn’t have the fucking time to cast Scourgify until
“Now, now, Sirius.” Narcissa grabs his arm, the lights get a little brighter. Oops, he didn’t mean to do that, “Albus, you and I both know how your reputation is fairing, I think it would be wise-”
All piled into the main living room with a book playing overhead on the ceiling, next to little stars Remus charmed to look like constellations.
Someone screams, Draco has time to look from Harry’s terrified face to Snape’s look of pure horror and then something slashes at his back and he’s falling forward into Harry’s outstretched arms.
Poppy’s eyes widen. “I want one.” She looks like she might snatch it right out of his hands, so he slips it in his pocket, but she’s still on about how wonderful it is.
“I asked if you were done being a fool.” Lucius sneers, and Draco, because the world around him is starting to darken, barely manages a nod before he’s dropped back to earth.
Draco reaches out for his wrist before he can think better of it. His action shocks them both, but Draco doesn’t let go. He can’t. Instead he forces Harry’s hand down and steps into his space. Glares haven’t fazed him since he was ten years old, and even though he had never seen so much hatred, he’s not going to sit by and let some spineless wimp take the light from his friend’s eyes.
Draco doesn’t answer him, but he does grab Harry’s arm and force him down the stairs, leaving Morgana and Nagini to their bickering. To Harry’s surprise, the rest of the kids have gathered already, exchanging whispers and excited laughs. Parents and adults watch from the couches, each with a cup of coffee in their hands.
Harry pities Lucius for that. He pities Lucius for having to tell Narcissa, who only freaks a little bit, like a restrained panic that Harry only knows because he remembers what her eyes looked like when she found out about Draco being cursed. Sirius doesn’t handle it well at all, so badly that the lights start playing tricks on his eyes, and when they tell Draco….well, Harry would argue that he handles it well.
The Slytherins tense up around him, and he can’t have that. Relations shouldn’t be tense like this, it isn’t good politics. So, Draco takes a deep breath and paints on his best smirk before stepping out next to Flint, who makes sure to stay a protective bit in front of him.
Obsidian, like all goblin banks, is impersonal and filled to the brim with little creatures who raise their eyebrows at him, but otherwise say nothing.
“I knew him.” Lupin corrects, “He was a few years ahead of us all though. A Perfect when we were first years, and quite terrifying if I remember correctly.”
Harry doesn’t know what the fuck to say to that, but Helga- no, Auksas, is already turning her back to him and making her way to her nest.
He hears screaming all around him, Dumbledore casts a spell, there’s a flash of light and the Dementors are gone but Potter….
Narcissa smiles at her husband, and then sees the way Blaise is trying to rip his lips off, the way Pansy is near tears with her eyes cast wide on Lucius, the way Draco shrinks away from the man striding past him. She sees LuLu rise up on her back legs in Draco’s lap, eyes and snarl trained on long blonde hair.
His mother thankfully doesn’t pick up on his cover, smiling softly at the sky outside that is rather breathtaking. To be fair, any view from this room is stunning, she set it up that way. Windows look out to the gardens, right where the main fountain is, and the water always manages to catch any light perfectly.
“It’s time for Check Ins!” Winky says cheerfully, like she’s not giving Draco another reason to hide under the covers.
Draco could kiss them. He really could, and he would if it didn’t mean waking up LuLu for the seventh time in one night. Instead he gives them a smile he can only hope conveys the gratitude he’s feeling.
Harry does end up warning him about the grosser things the further they get into the pipes. Partly because he knows if Draco sees a giant snake
“What the-” he barely made it out of the way, but the buzzing was gone, and Potter was chasing after it. So Draco followed.  He vaguely saw Potter grab it right before he started falling to the mud. Much to his horror, the boy landed, held up the Snitch, and then fainted in front of every damn person available.
Dumbledore had almost fucking hugged him when he told the old coot what had happened in the infirmary. Taking that as a good sign, he did finally feel the anxiety wearing away from his bones. For a long time there three potions hadn’t been enough, but he knew four were a little too dangerous. To remind Potter of their agreement, he kept picking on the boy, but he could tell Potter wasn’t really offended anymore. Somehow it made him feel a little lighter.
His team crowds around him like they can feel his discomfort, like they're trying to protect him against the disappointment creeping under his skin.
The whole lot of you?! After your vision- and don’t you dare lie to me Harry Potter! I know you, and I know your visions, and I know you
not to be insecure but I wrote like three different versions of this chapter because I thought they were all awful lmaoooo
“How do we open our books?” Draco repeats, watching in amusement as the class pulls them out, all bound in one way or another, Potter’s with a belt of all things. How annoying.
At least Hermione is finally not yelling at him. “Asklepios was the Greek wizard who came up with modern medicine! He was a genius! Without him we wouldn’t have any of our healing charms, even the ones for common colds! His work was amazing!”
He takes what little food they have and their repaired shared water cup and brings it into the living room where he sets it all down. A wordless
Draco’s mouth opens to snarl something awful at him, he’s never nice when he loses his temper, and Harry honestly can’t help himself. It’s been three days, and his boyfriend is stupidly attractive. So, like any sensible person, Harry grabs his very deadly, very
“Because I knew you wouldn’t have stayed in your dorm for long….” Harry looks like he knows that’s not all, so Draco gives up and lets his walls crack a little, “And because I’ve been thinking. A lot. Like so much I’m surprised my head hasn’t fallen off. I should have gone mad by now, and maybe I have because I was the one who dragged you up here and our record states that it should have been the other way-”
That actually gets a laugh out of the shaken up boy, but then Cedric’s brows furrow. “Wait a second. If I have
1) plz don't hate me for giving Snape a redemption story. it's gonna happen through the next few chapters but also if you read back i've been trying to make him a likable character from the beginning, unlike someone we all know and hate
He spends most of Divination thinking about how much simpler life would be if he could just be friends with whoever the hell he wanted to, and then he sees that Hufflepuff again and decides he really needs to ask
“I...might have discovered the magic of caffeine, and given that I don’t sleep at night and still have classes, I’ve become extremely dependent on it. I’m beginning to worry Blaise and Pansy.”
“Hello, Harry.” No need to sound so suspicious, but Krum does. Harry looks around them, sees that no one is really paying attention, and leans closer.
Draco, on pure instinct, has his wand out and aimed. Not that being armed lessens the shock value of seeing Sirius Black, in the flesh, with his wand pointed at an injured Weasley. He knows it’s a dumb move, but it doesn’t stop him from threatening.
Because Bill and his weird feelings for Draco aren’t enough, Mr. Wealsey managed to force him to come face to face with one of the hottest Quidditch players he’d ever seen. A Hufflepuff six year Seeker that Harry really never paid attention to when they were off the field but now….when the fuck was he going to stop running into attractive men? Shouldn’t he be finding women attractive?
He, against his will, barks out a quiet, shaky, almost insane sounding laugh. And then he can’t stop. Because this elf, the pure sweet little elf, the one who let him stay in her home, who sat with him for an entire week, making him eat, sharing water, who’s been so
“You see, Potter beat the Dark Lord as a baby, and there I was, standing between the most powerful wizard in the world and the most powerful Potions Master in the world, both allied with the kid who beat the Dark Lord without even trying. I’d have been a fool not to pick my side then and there. Plus I saw with my own two eyes what following the Dark Lord does to your mind...it’s not pretty.”
At the end of his mini-shopping spree, Draco finds himself with a few new books, a couple of mismatched coffee cups, a few toys for Salem, a new off-white sweater, some pants that were said to be the most comfortable thing
Draco wants to refuse on the sheer fucking principle, but Cedric is starting to leave so instead he grabs the kid’s cloak. Cedric is nice. Cedric kept Fleur from killing Harry on the night the Champions were announced. Draco
He shoots her a smile, “I’m a pureblood, what’s the worst it could do to me? Really, a peabrain like Potter is more of a threat.”
In a blink his name is signed, and they all smear blood on their palms and shake hands. The contract glows, lighting up the room for a moment. Bright light blinding so they almost miss the pages fading out of existence.
Pansy and Blaise call after him, and he’s fully aware that he’s more than likely causing a rather big scene by fleeing the Great Hall after making a very late appearance in the day, but he’s also a little busy trying to fix his father’s bullshit. Again.
Okay, so he seriously needs to have an in depth conversation with Charlie when this is all over. Stealing children is never an okay thing to do, dragon or not.
Sirius snorts, followed quickly by the sound of a smack, probably Narcissa, and then Lucius sighs. “I’ll have to speak to Harry tomorrow.”
dead,” Snape scoffs, and then he sees the body squirming on the floor and takes a large step back, “What the-”
Fred and George are somehow already drunk, someone having snuck in some type of alcohol he was actively avoiding. Hermione rolls her eyes, head stuck deep into yet another pile of larger than life books. Her and Ron were still fighting over the whole Scabbers Issue. Harry really was getting rather tired of it, because he couldn’t go comfort Hermione when she ran away crying without insulting Ron, which means he has to wait for Ron to go over to Seamus and get deep in conversation about the game before he can sneak off into Hermione’s room.
Narcissa’s face, the one he’s only seen in photographs, pops up into the fire with a smile. “Hello, darling. And Mister Potter, it is a pleasure to meet you, though I do wish it was under better circumstances.”
“I’ve highlighted the important bits I think Dumbledore might try to ignore,” His father is saying, “Percy and I have all the changed paperwork completed and waiting for signatures so we can input it into the Records. Don’t forget that you’ll need to get his medical paperwork updated as soon as possible.”
“The one with the long hair? That’s Bill. The other one is Charlie, go make friends I’ve gotta go grab spoons.”
Draco latches on the lighter topic like it’s his only hope, “So you’re the reason he’s so good at Quidditch!”
Draco doesn't say a word. His arm is starting to tense up, and while Kingsley’s hands have never been harsh, they’re still restricting. They still have the ability to break him.
Draco choses that moment to burst open the doors, like Harry’s heart isn’t stuck in his throat, like he’s not having a crisis at the warmth flooding through his chest. But it’s fine. He can totally get through a glass of hot chocolate without crying.
He was tired of seeing people suffer. Seeing himself in chains didn’t matter that much, if he was honest.  At one point his safety had meant everything to him, but he could barely find the will to care about it now. He did care about his mother being sent away, though. And the horror of last year’s hospital wing having to be expanded did. And the innocent lives that somehow kept getting swept up in a war that never truly ended. They shouldn’t be forced to fight what their parents couldn’t.
“Every night.” Draco answers automatically. “Before mother came home he would sometimes let it last for days.” He quickly comes back to his senses, “But you’re
With that done, it’s merely six o’clock, and the only things Draco has left to put away are personal artifacts that have no place.
Between classes, sneaking out to see Harry, Geia, or Fleur, his Transfiguration project, tea with Severus, writing to his mother, lessons with Poppy, and Hermione’s study schedule the rest of the month flies by. Before he knows it, finals are three weeks away, the final task is six weeks away, and Poppy is proud of him.
was there. Riddle, I mean. Him and Wormtail? And-and there was this cottage, and a lot of trees, a little lake by the mountains. I didn’t want him to, I asked him not to, and then he did. The cottage, I mean. Blew the whole thing up, and then I….the fire was so hot, ‘Mione...”
Ron frowns at that, setting aside the chess board as Winky brings them tea before wandering off in the direction of the Gala Planning Room. “Why do you do that?”
At least he has the sense to not talk about Draco being a spy, because instead his mouth opens and says something equally as bad.
They say goodbye to Salem, and two seconds later Draco finds himself in the middle of a busy wizard’s street.
“I know you're scared of the beast in the Chamber, and you should be, but we are of pure blood, it will not harm you.”
He gets a chuckle out of the man who uncrosses his arms and nods. “Well, Malfoy, it seems to me like you’re in good working condition. Carry on to your dorm, now, you should get some sleep before the first day.”
This Salazar he knows, the man is old and mean, looks every bit the blood purist Hermione complains about. Emerald robes, long white hair, a beard that puts Dumbledore to shame.
She glares at him but settles in his lap only to make a bunch of whiny noises until he pets her. Sirius keeps his smile throughout the exchange but it soon drops at the sight of a weird cloud rushing at them. “Draco? I don’t supposed that’s-”
know, which really makes the whole thing a bit funny. He’s so busy watching he doesn’t see Snape vanish his friend, but he does see Weasley tugging Potter away. This year kept getting better and better.
It’s been awhile since he got to be home, and he’s not complaining. He loves being able to see his friends, loves that his family is bigger and kind and welcoming even if some of them are a little scary. Honestly, if someone told ten year old him that one day he’d have everything he ever wanted he would’ve thought his aunt just found a new way to hurt him.
to be the only charmer who can do whatever spell Draco could probably find in a book if he tried hard enough. But, more than price, shopping with muggles means no one will recognize him.
“You won’t be getting anything for Christmas,” he lies as he hands over his money, knowing perfectly well there was no way in hell he’d stick to that. Call him selfish, but the look of joy on his friend’s face when they can actually
“The wound on your arm, it’s not healing because of the dark magic I suspect was on the blade. Normal healing potions and spells won’t work on it, you’ll have to keep your cast until we can speak to Severus about this. And yes, I will be speaking to Severus about this. All of this.”
He knows that voice. He’s heard it a lot in his probably cursed life. That last time he heard it was when his boyfriend’s dad lost his arm, and he was hoping that he’d get a few months before he heard it again.
“Yes, I apologize for unloading my mess on you.” Draco quietly replies. “Clearly, I was having some trouble with my mind.”
He blinks once, and finds himself no longer at the threshold of a ruined living room, but looking out at the ocean through a broken bay window. From here he can feel the breeze, it seeps into the house from the window in front of them, one that’s beginning to fall off and leave holes in the side of the wall, one with broken glass, one with him and a little elf staring out of it.
you thinking? You know it’s dangerous to come into the Slytherin common room, what if someone else had seen you? You could have gotten hurt!”
Lupin laughs at him, “No you did it right! In fact it was amazing, you’ve just produced something I’ve never seen before, I’d ask Dumbledore about this if I were you. It’s got to mean something.”
“I saw my mother recently," he rushed out. "She came home the week that Black was found, brought presents and everything. This she told me to give to you.”
He has one last room to inspect before he can return to his own room. It’s at the end of the halway, the brown room that Harry’s never liked. The lights are still on, and as he creeps closer, he hears several voices talking.
It’s quiet in the headmaster’s office, despite three people and one Phoenix being there. The paintings say nothing, the sorting hat is out of quick remarks, even the fire has calmed it’s cackling. Their tea is growing cold, but Draco can’t find the will to reach for it. Snape’s cup sits untouched besides his, and after a long moment, Dumbledore takes a deep breath and the quiet is shattered.
It’s nearing dark in the room, but Harry can still see the slow smile drag across Draco’s face, feel something stirring in his chest.
On Mondays, he ventures out to Yellow Brick Rd., stopping by Mrs. Daisy’s shop. The second time he did it, Howie was waiting with a big grin on his face, much to Mrs. Daisy’s annoyance, and from then on it became common to see various shop owners coming in just to see him.
“Fawkes! I missed your burning?” He makes a beeline for the creature to pick him up and gently pet him.
He tries to lie at first, Draco sees the cool expressionless stone make its way onto his father’s face. And then the idiot blurts out “Yes.” and Draco has the pleasure of seeing a flurry of emotions crack that mask he’s grown so used to.
“You know what I mean. I want to know why you won’t tell me things. I know the truth now, Draco. Sure, it’s probably not a good idea for us to be seen together in public, but that doesn’t mean we can’t be friends.”
He went on to tell them about realizing how vital Potter was to defeating evil should it rise again, and the sickening feeling that it already had, and about how Harry had managed to survive the Dark Lord all over again near the end of first year. Then he told them about second year, leaving out as much of his abuse as he could, while still alluding to it for the big reveal of Potter seeing the altercation between himself and Lucius after he thought he was in the clear. Then he told him half of the truth about this past summer, and how Harry had taken every chance to befriend him this year and how he’d finally given up and decided nothing was really stopping him.
Harry groans, because potions typically taste like ass, but he and Draco march down the stairs anyways.
Turning the corner, he sees Crabbe and Goyle glaring at Percy Weasley, who makes the nastiest face at his friends. His friends who had kept their heads down and tried so hard for their grades, only to fail, getting told off for no reason. They’ve been through enough this year, he decides as he strides towards the group.
Two heads turn to him, sitting beside Malfoy closer than he would like to provide warmth. Spells could only do much when you’d been in the cold for so long. Malfoy’s arm doesn’t tremble in his grasp, and even though he had originally flinched when Harry had pressed the damp cloth on the wound, Malfoy seemed much more relaxed.
It’s not as scary as it is in his nightmares, but maybe that’s because the monster that usually lurks in the darkness is tied up, or maybe because he’s not alone this time. Footsteps don’t echo in his dreams.
Draco reacts before he knows what he’s doing, only staying away because Harry still has a tight grip on his hand. “No! He didn’t, sir! He doesn’t even have his wand!”
Millie and Theo would lap up at the scraps Blaise and Pansy left them, going after the food, the curtains, Petunia’s barely passable self respect. Theo could probably take one look at Dudley and utter a single sentence to destroy him.
Eventually his father lets up and gives him almost an approving look before sending him to get changed. Another small blessing, his mother was coming home tonight. That meant a number of things for the young Malfoy.
Draco considers egging on his cousin more, but Narcissa whopped his ass less than five hours ago and he has to admit; he’s fucking
Apparently it’s not what Pansy was expecting. She takes a step back into a frozen Blaise, who looks at him like he’s lost every last shred of sanity, but Draco is tired and not in the right state of mind to refuse them, and since he’s already spilled his guts to one friend tonight, why not clue in his two best friends while he’s at it.
“Head tall. We’re almost to the next shop.” Sirius whispers to Harry, or maybe he’s saying it to Remus. They both look a little green in the face.
The man that tied him to a wall and beat him senseless, only to cry himself to sleep for the whole ordeal.
Harry finally reaches him and grabs him by his shoulder, dear Merlin he can feel the other’s cold body through his gloves. He quickly shucks off his coat and throws it on the thin shoulders, lifting Malfoy’s face towards him, inspecting the right black eye.
know the truth about Sirius’s innocence...can you really see him sitting by and letting his god-father go back to Azkaban? I’m personally not sure if Sirius will ever see those walls again….but if he is captured by a Dementor before he can- unfortunately- slip into safety...it would mean another life lost for Harry. He’s been through too much as it is, I daresay another loss so early in life would be the death of him, especially because Sirius and Mr. Potter were so close. Having spent many hours thinking over the situation, I assure you I have spent many sleepless nights on the topic, I decided that it would be safest for Harry not to know the truth until Sirius has fully achieved freedom, by trial or….other means.”
“Mrs. Weasley?” He begins in a small voice, “This is just as much my fault as it is theirs. They weren’t trying to be mean, I just told them a few things that Dudley and his parents have done to me and, well, you know Gryffindors….they don’t take well to their friends being bullied.”
The Kneazle purrs in his lap, rubbing her head into Draco’s stomach that is growing warm with affection. She didn’t know about the abuse, she assumed it was to protect him, of course she allowed it. She would do anything and everything to keep him safe. “Thank you, mother.” He swallows, throat unbearably clogged, “I can’t explain how much this means to me.”
Next he has to creep up the stairs, peeking into the pink room where Ginny should be only to find it empty. A bit worried, he checks Ron’s room next, but there’s no sign of his best friend, so Harry sneaks a glance into the twins’ room.
Ginny shakes her head, “I bullied Neville into taking me so I could dance with Luna when he gets tired.”
“I do believe that may be my doing,” Severus frowns, “And to answer your questions, we are at the beginning of a war, that is all the reasoning you need to be trained.”
The three watch hours of this, Draco being beaten, Draco tied to the wall, Draco with the Dementors, Draco getting cut, Draco starved, whipped, splashed awake by water, Crucioed, frozen, burned, kicked, slapped, taunted and cussed at. And then, just when he’s about to beg Dumbledore to stop, Lucius leaves Memory Draco passed out on the floor, only for one steel grey eye to peek open as soon as the door shuts.
“That won’t work, Granger, my father doesn’t use practical logic when he knows there isn’t any. He puts on a show and bullies people over, right now the Ministry all thinks they’re doing the right thing, we’d have to start with something even they can’t deny.”
Not actual anger because Harry thought his new, darker and more insulting, nicknames were funny. And Draco had another ‘lesson’ with Poppy that involved knives and a bit of potion brewing. At least this time he didn’t leave with a strange substance on him, and there’s so few people taking Arithmancy that he and Hermione could sneak glances and completely get away with it.
Even so Draco grits his teeth, trying to call on all that rage he had earlier. Fleur told him that until he could call on it naturally, he had to use whatever emotion his flames responded to. When she was younger, her flames burned away her tears, meaning they reacted to her sadness before becoming controlled. Gabbi, apparently, burns everything when she laughs if she’s not careful, which means she’s already got a leg up on Draco despite being a few years younger.
He takes a closer look at the sleeping boy before him. Quiet and calm, Potter doesn’t look disgusting for once. Instead, he looks peaceful, like nothing bad can reach him where he is in his dreams. Draco finds himself envious, half wanting to join Potter in dream land, a faraway place where not even the Dark Lord could get him. He thinks back to the last face Potter made at him, disgust mixed with hated, and lets out another, deeper sigh.
“Master Draco.” The elf bows, “Dobby did not realize he failed, he will burn his hands accordingly.”
It must be karma or something equally ridiculous, like Potter and his bunch of friends, for example. One second he’s laughing with his friends, and the next something is landing in Goyle’s cauldron and their potion is exploding everywhere. His nose is suddenly the size of his hand and oh, he could never do something like this to Pansy. It feels
smiling during the war, sir! Not even when Master and Mistress were going out! He is making the people happy, sir! You must believe Misty!”
And no, he has not been counting the hours since he was sent to his bedroom, so he cannot pinpoint that it’s been seven hours, twenty four minutes, and thirty three seconds when there’s a knock on his door.
“Line up everyone!” he roars, completely gone to his anger now. He doesn’t even care that a crowd is forming. “Harry Potter’s giving out signed photos!”
Draco Malfoy greets the boy with a smile and an outstretched hand. He looks bigger, stronger, somehow happier and Harry is smart enough to know it’s because of the man a few isles next to him looking like he’s about to fall over.
“Yeah, Misty is a bit of a plant finatic, but they’re scientifically proven to make people feel better, and I quite like them.”
“In bed.” Remus hands him and Draco a mug, ruffling each of their hairs just because he can. “We put the boys in the brown room and gave the girls Narcissa’s pink room for the evening. But nevermind that, how are you feeling?”
They spend their time in front of a broken window. Misty tells him about her life, how she once called the ocean her home until she met her first family that worked her until she nearly died. She says she’s lucky that her previous Mistress found her, Draco thinks so too. Misty brings him water and little berries on the verge of rotting from the garden. They eat together, sharing the same broken cup, while Misty chatters on about her previous family, about the Abbots, about the nice people that once filled the area.
Not that his actions mattered then, either. Because after the stunt Aunt Bella pulled over Christmas break, he couldn’t go back. Couldn’t ‘risk’ disappointing the Dark Lord again, much less his father.
Now, there aren’t many people here who say his name like that. Like he’s some sort of ghost. Nearly everyone here says his name with joy, hidden laughter, sometimes faint amusement masked by annoyance, but mostly the sound of his name is positive. Not spoken in a rasp, some sort of bewildered awe mixed with sorrow and hope.
meet the end he’s been waiting for. A quick curse to his heart, a stinger to his eye sockets, maybe a quick slitting of his throat.
“Yes. I am, and what about it?” Is his response, challenging and strong, nothing like what he actually feels.
“Technically that was Draco’s fault,” Harry yawns, moving closer to them so he can shake Dobby’s hand.
Pansy is quick on the uptake, moving even closer to look at him with such worry it sucks the air out of his lungs. He’d forgotten that people cared for him. “I know you’re worried about your godfather, and I know you want the distraction of learning, but it’s simply not safe...if you or any of my other friends…”her voice breaks off and Draco finds himself reaching out instinctively. Slytherins never showed weakness, and yet Pansy was shaking in his arms.
Draco doesn’t know what’s coming next, but when a whip appears in his father’s hands, he’s sure to cover Potter’s eyes with his arm. Unfortunately he can’t cover his ear drums. Lucius takes out whatever anger he has like Memory Draco is a punching bag, hitting him over and over until the whites of his eyes are showing. Then, he sighs, puts the whip down,and leaves Memory Draco tied to the wall until what he assumes is morning.
Draco groans once more, Blaise laughs from across the room, and he resigns himself to the fact that he will not be getting any sleep until Christmas break.
“I’ll agree under one condition.” Draco doesn’t like the sound of that at all, especially not when Snape points at him. “If I have to suffer, you will do it with me.”
alive, asleep on the hospital bed before them. True to Snape’s word his glasses weren’t broken, merely resting on his bedside table with water and various potions. Black hair fanned out over an unbroken face, his lips were even turned up in a smile as though he were having a sweet dream. He looked so peaceful Draco could almost forget, he would if he didn’t see the boy falling every time he closed his eyes. Draco also knows from personal experience that just because someone can sleep with a smile doesn’t mean they’re happy. Especially after being that close with Dementors.
“Defense.” She replies, coming seamlessly back into his arms. “We’re going to get Os on the Ancient Runes, it’s Potions I’m worried about.”
it got saucy! Oh no! fair warning, I love the idea of Draco in clubs, but also I love the idea of Theo ebing a massive nerd, and then turning and shaking his ass in the club (also, they're not going to be together, don't worry)
Harry would willingly face Riddle a thousand times if it meant never having to see that sight again.
Draco graces him with a smile, a small crass gesture to his father’s way of politics. Ruling with an iron fist is tacky to say the least. Sliver went so much better with his aesthetic, besides, Draco’s always seen better results in loyalty if the person isn’t, say, an abusive asshole governed by the mistakes of his past that just so happened to lead him to quite literally selling his soul. Not to be specific, of course.
something he doesn’t mind admitting at all, “Yes, sir. Professor Lupin asked me to stop by his office after dinner.”
Harry doesn’t even have time to duck from the meaty hand. He’s lucky Draco cast that unbreakable spell on his glasses last year, otherwise they’d be long gone.
“Well, Father. Attacking Potter in public, in the middle of the game, no less, roused suspicion that you were the one hurting him, all the Gryffindor’s teammates were looking at you, and I couldn’t bear to have that stain across your name, nor my house. I assumed that by going to Madam Hooch, it would look less like our fault, and it did.”
After they finish putting things away in the one cabinet that isn’t broken, Misty drags him down a hallway he didn’t know existed into what appears to be the only unruined room in the entire house.
Harry sighs, “We have to. You promised me after that Quidditch game that we would. You said any question I have-”
Hermione’s snap comes two days before the final Quidditch match of the season, the one that determines who wins the cups. Finals are only three weeks away, and he’d honestly been expecting this since she came in their abandoned classroom raving like a howler about how pointless Divination is. As much as Draco and Pansy had agreed with her, it still scared the rest of their merry crew enough that Weasley didn’t even glare at them. Blaise had actually given Draco some Calming Draught to add to his Headache Potion the day after.
“Yep. Hope you don’t mind being poisoned, I’m afraid I’m a rather terrible cook, and this was supposed to be a simple meal.”
Malfoy looks off to the distance, which happens to mean him locking those soft grey eyes on Harry’s. For a moment it’s like everything falls away. He can see every emotion in those eyes looking at him, and then they fade away before Harry can identify them.
That being said, he still has a type. One that a skinny, old, no-nose, strangely pale Dark Lord doesn't fit into.
“Don’t we have something more important to talk about?!” Ron whines and because he probably won’t get a better segway, Harry snatches this one.
Harry Potter has had one hell of a night, or really, one hell of the last two years. Because the giant secret room under a three-headed dog and almost dying his first year wasn’t enough for Voldemort, the giant git
“After Snape and I sent Draco away, he started experimenting on Lucius. You all know my husband has the Dark Mark, it was forced on him at a young age. But his is unlike the others I’ve seen, there is a flower-“ She swallows- “a narcissus flower. I won’t divulge the importance of that, you all are smart children, you can figure it out. It twists with the serpent and forms a crown on the skull. Severus and I each had our own ideas about it, but only after we spoke to a mind healer did we figure it out.”
“Merlin!” He chokes, “You two are gonna do just fine without me-oh! Draco,” he reaches into his desk and pulls out a small wrapped present, “I know it’s a little late, but your birthday was a few days ago, wasn’t it?”
for us to be in public together, but why the hell can’t we be friends? What the fuck is supposed to stop us? A crazed maniac? We already have one of those. A killer? Got that one too. Friends that hate the other? Well that’s taken care of on both sides, hasn't it. My father is going to kill me anyways, and you certainly don't need another asshole in your life. Dumbledore will be happy about it, and dammit!"
much better with the new beautifully wooden, lovely birch, perfectly stained floors. It does, admittedly, look weird with all the holes in the walls, so Draco discreetly casts a few
Weirder than his sudden suspicion of Lupin was walking into Defense Against the Dark Arts and seeing Snape in place of his gruffy professor.
Granted he fucked that up a day later when Lucius caught him apologizing to the fairy he was forced to torture.
care,” Draco sighs, because it’s probably better to get this argument taken care of so there isn’t a bad taste in his mouth all summer. “I wouldn’t have entered our blood contract if I didn’t care, which of course I do. If it weren’t for you two I wouldn’t have made it through second year. Not with my father and all the other secrets I was forced to keep, which you know were too important to divulge without Dumbledore agreeing, and he couldn’t deal with that while students were getting hurt.”
He is also not supposed to be here, in Mrs. Daisy’s shop, letting his briefcase fall from his left hand while the right one covers his mouth.
“I’m assuming Draco told you all what happened the night of your visit? It’s okay to be honest, he’d be an idiot to try and keep secrets from you two at this point.”
Narcissa’s eyes narrow, Belle and Katheriene look as though the plush white chairs they’re sitting in have been ripped from underneath them. It’s understandable, only a crazy person would dare to lay a hand on a Malfoy.
The professor lets him in and stares, and really, Draco gets it. His hair is a mess, eyes wide and probably a little crazed, robes all in disarray, and LuLu beside him eyeing him like he might just break down crying right here and now.
“Right…” Theo offers weakly, watching her walk out the door like he’s never seen a house elf before, “Your home, the two of you. Together.
Insane, how much a person could miss in four days. Dumbledore still hadn’t gone through his memories, but he knew that would be happening before he left the office, Merlin knows Potter would probably see them too. The stupid git had been with him so much apparently his friends had gone looking, and well, he needed to explain
He’s deep in law books in the middle of what should be his free period when he remembers his promise to Potter.
Draco snorts at him, but he does take Harry’s hand, lightly moving up until he’s gripping the marked part of his arm. “At the rate you’re going you’ll have a full collection by the time we graduate.”
“Hippogriff wounds are normally jagged, claws and beaks never make for a clean cut, you see, nor a deep one as they never aim to kill, merely scare off. So tell me, where
Remus turns him around slowly, Harry feels stupid for flinching at the contact, but he also feels justified for flinching when he gets a good look at Remus’s face. His teeth are going to break if he doesn’t stop clenching his jaw like that.
Astoria sighs, like it pains her greatly to repeat anything she’s said. To be fair, if she wasn’t from such a powerful family, he’d be sighing in the exact same way. “Look, Malfoy. I heard from Luna that you’re a decent fellow, so I’m offering you a trade.”
They take him upstairs after dessert, where Pansy consumed at least ten strawberry tarts and Blaise an equal amount of turtle and caramel ones. Since childhood the three had always come to this house during the summer. Even though it’s been a few years, they can still lead him directly to his usual room. Only they don’t leave this time.
“Draco! Your dad came to watch! Aren’t you excited?” Flint asks when they hit the ground, all of them sending daggers to the other team.
his magic starting to get testy around him, he’s shocked Harry hasn’t dropped his hand, and when Harry’s accused again Draco nearly lashes out. Really! How the hell do you forget about the Boy Who Lived?
, he was getting no sleep. No sleep, the discovery of coffee, and no one to talk to was beginning to drive him up the wall if he was being honest, which is why when Crabbe and Goyle beg him to go to Hogsmeade with them, he nods about ten times.
“Maybe, but we’re a little young to worry about that, aren’t we? There’s no need for you to be so worried so soon, relax for a few years, Draco, you deserve it.”
“Ah! The Hand of Glory!” Mr.Borgin rushes to explain-like Draco doesn’t already know- but the second the words ‘friend of thieves’ leaves the man’s mouth, he knows he’ll never be allowed to have it. Rising to bait his son is something Lucius would never pass, and his grades are sensitive enough a topic to have Draco red and annoyed.
“July starts tomorrow,” Ron mentions as Draco plans his next move. “Do they have a date for this party thingy yet?”
“You still haven’t started on your Transfiguration project!” Draco warns, but he’s not resisting so Harry counts it as a win.
“The only time that can be broken,” Pansy continues seriously, “ is if you’re about to die and we have to do something like go get Dumbledore for help.”
From the margins, the underlined bits, and the general warnings, Draco starts to understand why a wand is needed. Firstly, the spell has to be done under the light of the full moon while the ocean is at high tide, there’s a bit of blood that has to be dropped into the sea, there must be three firelights hanging around the elf being bound, and the spell only lasts for ten years.
It only takes a few minutes to spell everything away, so Draco moves though his bags to find the paintings, a few of the smaller plants, and a weird golden sun sculpture he’d felt compelled to buy. He plops them down on the bay window seal, places one of the Snake Plants at the center of the dining table, and then moves to put the rest of the plants in Misty’s sad sun room.
Harry reaches out to touch him, Draco moves away and the look Harry gives him makes something squeeze tight in his chest. The outstretched arm drops.
“No.” Sirius shakes his arm loose. “No….let me tell you what’s going to happen. Remus is picking Harry up tomorrow, when I get home I’ll offer him the adoption papers. He is going to have a
i'm excited for the next chapter so i hope you are! also thank you so much for the comments you all are wonderful and I really thought this wouldn't be interesting to anyone but here we are. thank you again and I look forward to seeing you in the next update
Remus raises an eyebrow, but Harry’s not a huge fan of talking about childhood trauma with anyone that isn’t Ron and Hermione and he has his limits with them too.
Lupin hits him on the chest for that one, taking a deep breath. “Sirius didn’t betray your parents, Harry-“
He fumbles around in his bag for a bit, not looking her in the eyes, and pulls out the blue sweater Blaise used to make fun of him for.

And Harry fucking does it. Follows him blindly up at least ten sets of stairs, through a few secret passages, and right to the Astronomy towers. He goes without a word or a second thought and blimey how the hell was this idiot not dead yet. Draco’s half tempted to ask what the fuck Harry thought he was doing; the two had been enemies and he
They run, full out sprint to the forests nearby, and they don’t stop until they’ve passed the veelas and the teenagers they surround. The group passes Mr.Bagman who gives them a bewildered look until Lucius shouts ‘You need to get your ass to the campsite!’

He expects a fight, some bullshit about how none of the people in front of him matter, so he rounds and steps in front of them, shoulders squared and jaw set.
to, but how the hell did anyone expect him to sleep when his mother was alone with Lucius Malfoy in the dungeons? Sure, he knows how dangerous Narcissa is. He knows what really fertilizes their flower beds, how she casts Unforgivables the second someone she cares for is compromised, how, of all the people in their family, she was both the most dangerous and cunning.
Finally, in his big speech, he turns to Howie. “My house would literally be barren if it weren’t for you and your shop. In a weird way, you and Mrs. Alice are the entire reason I get to have a home. You in particular have gotten me to trust- dare I even say
The masked figures that once plagued the hallways of his home, marching in a tight formation, carrying to people, no,
His friends suck in air beside him, Draco has to bite his tongue to keep from saying ‘I could’ve told you that’.
McGonagall, she would’ve chewed his head off then and there unless something was true. She didn’t bend to liars, he knew that from personal experience.
Blaise collects himself from George, which means Fred leads Millie over to their area and the entire group of them get to listen to Blaise’s boring explanation.
Her last owners were purebloods, like him, but, unlike him, they were kind. The Mister, Garon if Draco’s been listening right, was obsessed with muggle plants, always researching how he could mix muggle plants with wizard plants to create something new, even though it always failed. The Mistress, Emilia, was a recluse. She spent time down by the water, made her money through selling potions even though she apparently had a trust fund so big Misty couldn’t count it all.
It’s that image that leads his smirking face to a peculiar hand resting on a tattered cushion. The Hand of Glory, it would be perfect for his midnight watches, he could use it to sneak around the castle. His plans to get rid of whatever beast his father planned on unlocking needed that artifact. It's said to be the end of footfalls, vanquisher of sound, to make the owner completely unnoticeable when they need to be.
Not even the other mothers dare to breathe, they can’t really. Narcissa’s magic flows out from her in violent waves that clog up their throats even though they’re aimed at his father’s trembling form.
The paper definitely did not suggest that ‘friends’ were anywhere in their future, but who was he to tell them? Instead he slams his hand on his thighs to get their attention.
“By that of course I mean, Harry Potter and flying cars. I do believe his stunt will be all over muggle news in the morning, do you think they’ll claim it to be a UFO?”
As of this moment, all of Draco’s logic is gone. All of his years of studying, all the debates he had with Severus, the infernal
“That,” Draco doesn’t even bother fighting his smile this time, “Is one of those questions I can’t answer right now.”
He tugs on his softest pair of pants, the grey slacks that Pansy made him in his final year at Hogwarts. The ones that feel like silk and look like the usual stuffy business shit he was forced to wear.
Their dance gets sad from there because it’s just a memory. Lily and James were gone, Peter a traitor. Remus and Sirius, they’re all that’s left. So he commits it to memory, the two of them dancing alone in the kitchen, and when he presses his forehead into Remus’s shoulder he can almost hear his dead friends teasing. They don’t even notice their guests until he hears a throat clear and nearly jumps out of his skin.
“I don’t know…” Ron said faintly, “I ran.” He said as Ginny rubbed the side of his arm comfortingly. Harry gave an understanding nod at that. Draco wondered absently who he planned to ask given that he was required to have a partner.
There it was. His final order from the person who was supposed to keep him sane during all of this. The doors slammed opened and immediately Death Eaters filed in with his aunt cooing behind him.
“I’m okay, ‘mione,” he tried only for a small sniff to be given in return. “I missed you too.” He said and patted her back awkwardly, “But we’ve been standing here for ten minutes now.”
“I know you don’t, but I can’t find it within myself to care, Gingerbread.” He muttered and Ron made a face at the much-hated nickname before stabbing his mashed potatoes. “Shouldn’t we be focused on the fact Harry is in a death tournament?”
Draco wasn’t sure how… but a sudden realization seemed to click into place at once. Not just about what Dumbledore wanted… but what Draco did. He sat in the empty chair. After a few seconds he moved one of the white pawns into place.
“Yes,” Hermione supplies over the little ‘cell phone’ thing in his hand. “Harry disappears like that sometimes. He did it with the stone in first year, Geia, and you I suppose, second year, and I guessed he always disappeared with
“Come on, sleeping beauty, we all need to go to bed. Can’t fail that Herbology test in the morning.”
“Come on, Draco. It’ll be fun, after all….I hear dueling is a great way to let out pent up frustrations…” A single sneer and Snape turns on his heel, stalking out of Dumbledore’s office and leaving the young boy flabbergasted.
Whatever furniture that was left has been eaten through, covered in dust, or broken beyond repair. There’s not much of it, a broken, singed couch by a fireplace, a table that’s missing a few legs, tattered pillows, memories of a staircase with several missing steps, doors blown off their hinges, all the dust in the near empty room makes him sneeze.
for his soul, but horrible for his bank account, as this new, mush easier, way of shopping ends with him buying a fucking wheat colored, breifcase record player, letting the shop assistant pick out a few vinyls to go with it.
“I’m sorry,” Draco whispers in his ear. His head feels so nice on Blaise’s warm shoulder, it feels good to grip onto something solid. Blaise rubs gently down his back and it somehow doesn’t hurt as much as he thought it would. Everything is just warm here, and when Pansy joins their little hug fest it feels like home.
“AMYCYS!” He called after pointing Sirius in the direction of a couple first-years that Draco had hidden away, “I have a job for you.” He said, leaning against the wall. As he expected, Alecto turned as well, lips both curling in horrifying unison.
look a little similar. A little. Harry’s eyes were a different shade of green and Theo’s hair could be considered more of a very dark brown than black, but… you know what? He wasn’t going to read into this. “Quite frankly, I didn’t realize she knew you had a boyfriend. She seemed to… really like you. A lot.” He said, clicking his tongue a bit in almost annoyance. “You do know she’s seventeen, right?” He added on. Draco looked at him.
When Draco looked back up there were three figures in front of him. He recognized two... His father was donned in his best robes and face once again full and proud as Draco had remembered it as a child. Andromeda stood next to him, looking younger than Draco remembered ever seeing her. She might have been only a few years older than him. He could see Dora's face much more clearly in hers. He still recognized her smile as she beamed at him. The last woman was...
She practically screeched and threw down the hat altogether, “Besides, you get flustered when Harry gets close to you!” She told him, pointing a finger at his nose. “You get all red and nervous and sound like a complete idiot!”
He popped up to find both Ron and Hermione pointing stolen wands at him with fake-Ron on the ground, unconscious. Based on the blood trickling down the side of his face and the marble bust on the ground one of them had smash his head in with the statue.
"Yes, I hear you have a rather... eclectic staff," Draco decided, "I've been getting updates about Theo, but what has Harry done?" He asked, absolutely positive that Harry would have left out any retaliation he might have thrown back after Theo annoyed him. McGonagall's lips thinned, smoothing out a dark blue dress with a slight shake of her head.
"Draco, get the Hell up," Harry's voice said and he felt someone grab the sides of arms, "We cannot be having this conversation in the middle of a goddamn battle," he said and jerked his head. Hermione reappeared, also pulling him up. Weird. Why was she still here? She didn't die too, did she? Draco's heart stopped for a moment. He couldn't take that. He couldn't. "What's happening to him?"
"Will... you tell me more about what happened?" He asked cautiously. Draco tensed. No. No, he wasn't ready for that. Harry must have seen this because he dropped it within seconds, squeezing Draco's hand instead, “I should let you know,” he said, “I expanded the DA too. Sort of. I ended up being really productive these last couple months.” He said. Draco turned to look at him.
“I’ve failed you.” She said miserably and then turned her eyes to Draco, “But… master, I did my best to make up for it once I realized the prophecy was gone. I brought you a spy-”
Oh. Right. Yeah. Draco blinked. He didn’t often forget about quidditch given that it was the one thing he really felt any sort of joy from lately. Ron got up and grabbed his uniform, throwing it at Draco’s face.
"You... do?" He asked and felt a stab of panic, "I didn't think you would like something like this. I really would have been fine with waiting-"
“Voldemort may not be able to kill you, but heart failure will,” Draco informed him. Harry took another bite just to spite him. Draco had half a mind to deck him.
"Irrelevant. I know a Slytherin when I see one. She tricked you into feeding her pancakes for dinner last week. Slytherin." He said and Harry stepped in front of him, jutting a single finger into his chest.
“If we can even graduate like this,” Daphne said. Draco nodded agreement. Finally. Someone who understood. Why was their school the breeding ground for these sorts of things?
Hermione thought it was cute. Draco found it horrifying. Sometimes her letters consisted of only a couple sentences to inform him of recent events that were happening at that moment in time. Other times she drew him pictures and sometimes he just had no goddamn idea what she was talking about.
“Fertility testing,” he said, and both Harry and Hermione froze to stare openly at him. Hagrid grimaced, but didn’t comment as he served them all some of his rock cakes.
Ron made some improvements too... though this was through the watch. Draco might not be speaking, but Ron got the closest given that Draco had decided sharing his feelings through their connecting charm was okay.
“Come on,” he said, jerking him up. “We need to go. Quick.” He said. Harry was blinking rapidly, shock covering most of his features, but he didn’t need to be told twice as he got up. Draco was about to head towards the door when Harry suddenly shoved him.
"Harry has the Resurrection Stone," Draco cut him off and Ted blinked, "If you want to talk to her. Say goodbye. I don't know what he plans to do with it exactly, but I can get it for you." He promised and Ted nodded faintly.
himself better. Taking a deep breath, he sat up with a polite smile as Theo rubbed the back of his neck.
“What?” He asked and Draco shoved his book over towards him, pointing to the passage he was looking at. Harry read it a few times before sighing, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Orpheus Gigglemore,” He read along the spine, “He sounds pureblood.”
“Mr. Malfoy,” McGonagall said and placed a hand on his shoulder. “She’s over there,” She told him, squeezing tightly as she turned him towards the other end of the room. “I’m sorry. You must know we’re doing everything we can.”
Draco hadn’t gotten so much as a single word from his father since his sorting. Any form of communication almost always came from his mother – on occasion from Severus. For a moment he wondered if the man was going to ignore him before he felt gray eyes lock onto him.
“And yet here you are. Walking.” Draco said as he turned to find Theodore Nott himself leaning against one of the passageways to the side of the corridor.
“There’s a Death Eater at Hogwarts!” Harry said right as Draco reached the conclusion himself. He felt a wave of panic as Harry stood up, “There’s a Death Eater here - they put my name in the Goblet of Fire, they made sure I got throug-”
"Not that much!" Harry objected, "Don't tell them bad things about me!" He added, crossing his arms. Sirius raised an eyebrow at him. "I don't even swear that much..." Harry grumbled softly as he kicked the ground. Draco watched him for a moment, vaguely amused before looking back up at his cousin.
Draco couldn’t help, but grin at that. He didn’t have much time though with Harry gaining on them with concerning speed.
“There! You see? Are you looking?” Draco asked impatiently, pointing at the sky of the Astronomy Tower. Harry squinted up.
“You keep saying your family doesn’t matter.” Draco reiterated for possibly the hundredth time. Theo sighed.
“That makes sense - oh, you have something right there.” Theo nodded and before Draco could react, he leaned over and brushed his thumb over his cheek. Draco’s cheeks burned. Theo sat back, nonplussed. “Anyways, I kind of wanted to ask you something…” He said.
.” Harry said, suddenly standing up. Fawkes was still there, watching with curious eyes as Harry began to pace, “We can’t win without him. How are we supposed to find all the horcruxes? Or fight Voldemort? Does… Am I supposed to do that?” He asked, voice hitching slightly, “Alone? Why wouldn’t he warn me?”
"Hm. I figured it would be awhile," she said and Draco decided right then that was his cue to leave and to leave
So, yeah. They weren't hiding anything. Not really. It was just sneaking around to maintain balance... which was a little fun. Draco definitely had learned to appreciate the many advantages Harry's invisibility cloak brought them. However, uh... much like most things in life, well, these types of scenarios were short-lived.
“No,” Draco snapped back, “I chose my allies. Ever since I was old enough to visit you in Azkaban you’ve told me that the Dark Lord would rise. I’ve been preparing for it.” He said. The ground trembled - letting items fall off the shelves with a crash. A veil swooped by, sucking some of them inside. Bellatrix acknowledged none of the chaos. He could feel her trying to pry inside of his mind. He let her in. Not all the way, but enough for her to feel his anger. Granted, it wasn’t towards his friends like he was leading her to believe… but it would work.
"Sectumsempra." Hermione said, pushing her wand away from her as she said it. Draco frowned, "It... Snape invented the spell so I'm assuming there's some sort of logic to the name. Sect could be sectum or to cut."
“I get the feeling you’re mad at me over the gillyweed thing,” Draco greeted as he marched into Severus’ office, “Also, full disclosure, Harry overheard you and Karkaroff talking. Your Dark Mark is burning. Please reassure me you are no longer serving the late Lord Voldemort so I can stop hearing about you and get my paranoid group of miscreants to focus on the third task.” He said, all in breath.
"Why are you dragging me into this?" Daphne grumbled, but when Andromeda looked at her, sighed, "Sure, but I'm pretty sure I can only do one person too. I don't know how Granger dragged you both along."
...well then. That was much more serious than he had anticipated. Neville tilted his head expectantly.
“How long do you have detention?” Ron yawned, and Draco could hear him cramming some parchment in a bag.
"He's this wickedly smart muggle," Draco told him, taking out a few more peppermint patties to unwrap, "Hermione and Harry think it's funny that I'm so impressed by him, but you should see some of the stuff he figures out. I want to meet him." He said and popped one in his mouth. Neville went to open his mouth and respond, but was stopped by Ginny appearing out of nowhere to attack them.
“Yes…” he murmured, “Yes, yes! You’re a good one, my boy. Good. I will continue to greet my guests then - please, know I am so pleased you all came even if I don’t speak to you again,” he said, and Draco placed a hand over his heart to show 'no hard feelings'. He waited until Nicholas floated off again to turn to the others.
The audacity was really something else. In fact, he had a few choice words he might have thrown back if he wasn’t so shocked. There was a light pull on his arm as he felt himself led away from the absolute bullshit that was happening in front of him.
“It will make her hesitate,” Severus agreed, “But if you show enough potential she’ll look over it. After all, she does like to take credit for training the Dark Lord’s more talented Death Eaters.” He mused and gave a slight nod at Draco’s hand. “Try to make it scar. I'll give you something so you won't feel the pain.”
someone? Was the killing curse not good enough for you?" He asked dryly. Severus rolled his eyes. He put a preserving charm over his cauldron and then walked around to face him fully, crossing his arms over his chest. Draco waited.
have it then I need to know given that he's weak and it would be all too easy for someone to take control of it," he said and the paused, "Did you know he didn't tell Harry that he was dying?" He asked. Severus sighed.
"You used it on him?!" Draco asked, voice going a little high. Severus rolled his eyes, "You actually have used this spell that you claim is very dangerous on people?"
"You still want to be an auror?" He asked curiously, "I thought that was just something you said to get out of thinking more on it." He told him. Harry spluttered in return, looking actually a little offended by Draco's comment - which was pretty rare at this point. Draco and Harry's friendship had required them to both learn how to take blunt and insensitive comments pretty well over the years.
"Oh, uh, thanks, Cissa." Rowle told her. Nobody looked too thrilled by the offering, but it looked as though they were trying to placate her by taking small sips. Draco internally shook his head. He never knew his mother was so beloved among this group. His father's jaw clenched, looking at his wife with obvious betrayal before pushing one of the wands pointed at him to the side.
"Bellatrix knows we're missing," he said, voice taut with worry. A small pop interrupted him. Kreacher sighed. "You're back!"
Hermione, in particular, had latched onto him with an impressive strength and just outright refused to let go.
“The Dark Lord sends his regards,” Draco told him coolly and, for the first time since he was sorted, searched for whatever courage his house had to offer, “
“It was supposed to be a Christmas gift, but… well, Ron mentioned that maybe we should give it to you early.” Hermione explained with a small shrug. “I thought of it in the shop, but Harry picked it out and really it was brilliant-”
“What you’re suggesting is more than what Dumbledore had planned for you.” He said slowly. Draco snorted. As if he gave a
"I'm not a kid," Draco told him, voice completely monotone. Jenkins snorted and got off of the bed, walking the meager three inches to kneel in front of Draco, "I'm seventeen," he added, "And I've certainly done things to throw myself into adulthood." He added darkly. Jenkins raised an eyebrow.
“Of course he’s not! Draco can do way better.” Ron interjected “Besides, mum says thirteen is way too young to date anyways. He should wait until next year and ask Dean Thomas out or something.”
Draco opened his mouth. Was that a joke? It had to be. Dumbledore would have to tell Harry, right? He would have to. It didn’t make sense that he wouldn’t.
"We will," she agreed and reached out as if to touch his cheek. It was strange... she wasn't quite a ghost, but not quite solid either. He felt a tinge of regret when she couldn't feel her touch, "Until then... Be good." She warned. Draco laughed.
“Fine, tell Hermione to hit him in the head then.” Draco called over his shoulder as he whisked out of the common room. He wasn’t entirely sure what his game plan was. Outright confrontation? That might not work well. Besides, a more… gentle approach might be needed. Steeling his nerves, he slid down a few of the staircases before stepping out towards the greenhouses.
"I would get him thrown in Azkaban or maybe get the Daily Prophet to cause him headaches until his dying days. Perhaps send someone to jinx him if I'm feeling particularly venomous," he mused, "But your mother would kill him." He said with such surety that it honestly made Draco a little uncomfortable. He turned to Harry.
Draco grumbled, a bit bitterly as tried not to think about how many other heads this one, manky hat had been on. There was a low rumble from that hat that was either a chuckle of amusement or growl of irritation.
“Did you not know?” Draco asked calmly. Pansy flinched, but was immediately pulled away by Montague whipping out his wand.
“Ah, pumpkin juice then.” He said and flicked his wand again. Draco gave a tight smile. “I was just saying that I have heard quite extraordinary things about you since your sorting. You and Mr. Potter had gone on some grand adventures, hm?” He asked. Draco laughed.
“And you’re scared to ask a girl out,” he hummed “I can’t believe the savior of the wizarding world - no, no the Chosen One who has defeated the Dark Lord at the ages of one, eleven, twelve, and fourteen is-”
was that Draco wouldn’t mind having some insight if Slughorn would refrain from being… you know. Himself.
“Oh, you’re right,” she mumbled and sat up straight, wiping the tears away as she jutted out her chin with pride. Draco gave her a firm nod of approval. Dumbledore beamed down at them. Draco shook his head.
"Oh?" Bellatrix laughed, "I would accept those offers of help while you can, 'Meda. Ideally I would like a challenge-"
Only sleep didn’t come easily. Not with so much to consider resting at the back of his mind. Rolling over, he grabbed the red quill hidden underneath his robes and a piece of parchment.
"Fine. Then we'll talk here," he said and walked into the room. Harry glanced over to see who the others were lurking outside and then blinked when he made out Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson of all people. They didn't come into the room, but both glanced over at Draco before giving Theo and Harry acknowledging nods. Pansy wasted no time heading back downstairs, but Blaise hesitated - looking at Theo for a moment. There seemed to be some kind of silent conversation before Blaise also went towards the stairs as well.
"Hey..." Harry's voice came and Draco glanced up to look at him, "You're right. I'm sorry. Draco, I'm sorry. I wanted - Draco, please."
“Because they’re winning right now.” Theo said solemnly. He laughed. If nothing else, Theo was fun to be around. “Also, I’m sorry about the seats.” He added, Draco frowned.
“Draco, that’s brilliant!” Hermione said and before he could ask what was happening, they were apparating again. Draco didn’t even bother to ask anymore. He figured explanations were pretty much dead at this point. He was surprised it took him this long to accept it.
“Neville was the one who knew about it,” Draco shrugged and gave him a light splash. “Heard you came in last.”
“Oh, as if you know!” Ron threw back, “You don’t even fancy girls… which is quite lucky to be honest.” He said. Draco clicked his tongue. Maybe… navy blue. Hermione’s dress was light blue so navy would be fine for Ron.
“Well, reading is a loose term…” Draco said with a wary shrug, “But yeah. That’s the idea. Voldemort was famous for it. It was how he got a lot of his information.” He said. Harry pursed his lips at that. It was a disturbing idea to say the least. He watched a bit as Harry seemed to mull over the idea for a few seconds before continuing. “You want me to teach you?” He asked.
Now that Dumbledore was gone, Umbridge ruled the school. In turn, it gave Draco a lot more power as well.
“How are occlumency lessons?” He called as he walked into Severus’ office, flicking his wand to shut the doors behind him. Severus didn’t look surprised at his arrival. Draco dumped the knives Andromeda had given him for Christmas on his desk alongside the blood quill.
There was ONE specific scenario I did have mind that I thought would have been awesome and I am SO excited for you guys to have my version of how Voldy should have died.
"The professor at Castelobruxo?" She asked and the woman nodded, "I see. It's true what they say then?" She asked and Ginny cleared her throat, holding up her hands in a silent demand for an explanation. Draco had no idea why this woman was renowned by first name alone... though there was strangeness about her. He couldn't pin exactly what is was though. Sabelia smirked.
- out there who will be a better dad than you. Even if I have kids I will firmly believe that. You are strong and brave and smart and kind and funny and the
Sirius had decided to fully embrace his new role at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes and sent him (and everyone else) various products from puking pastels to muggle magic tricks.
“Don’t worry, I asked the Dark Lord first. He gave me permission. Besides, I wasn’t the only one. Severus said he once saw Crabbe with one of those coins weeks ago and so did Nott.” He told her.
“And outside that community, I doubt you have many friends,” she continued, “Which is why I’ve decided to overlook you being an absolute moron for now in favor of helping you because I think you are actually quite smart,” she finished and Draco took a long breath.
“This isn’t funny,” Severus told him, “You may be in Gryffindor, but I at least expect you to have some dignity and act like you have more than a few brain cells. If you keep this up then I can expect you to be riding a flying car to school next year, won’t I?” He asked. Draco frowned. “When you return to school you have detention.”
"Yes. She's ordered more as well, but I believe Toodles is more than up to the task of stealing them before another student touches one."
“Um, good?” He said and crossed his arms, “Much better than yesterday,” he admitted as he shook his head, “And now that Harriet is better - actually, I’m doing really good,” he decided and looked over at where his snake was sunbathing by the window. He went over to see if she was hungry, but he barely made it three steps before he felt a hand on his arm, spinning him around. He was greeted with Harry close - precariously close - much more than he had been before. His heart picked up for a moment as he realized what was happening a second before it did, the smell of spring almost drowning him. He moved forward before he could consider if it was really a good or bad decision.
Seriously, there was hugging, hair touching, cheek patting, random kissing, hand holding, crying tears of happiness, crying tears of regret - it was a mess.
"I can't!" He snapped at them and stood up, bitterly kick a rock over the side of the cliff so it tumbled down into the sea below. "I... can't leave him," he said and Hermione looked helplessly at Ron. He reached out, regret touching his expression and Harry knew before he even opened his mouth this was going to be a 'tough love' type of situation.
- and decided to fight a giant snake?” He said, voice raising with each word. Draco nodded. That about summed it up. “Explain!”
"You think you can hurt us with that stick?" One of them said, voice mocking and Severus rolled his eyes, looking seconds from casting a stunning spell when another one of the muggles spoke up from the back.
"No. Well, yes. I was. My plan was to just schedule days where I yelled at you about saving my life until I died," he informed him and Draco bit back a smile, "But now I see that if I hadn't been for your... stubbornness, that my daughter would be an orphan and grandson without any grandparents at all." He said and ran a hand through his hair. Draco bit his tongue.
"Thank you," he finally said and Harry shrugged, picking absently at the dirt. "I'm going to, um, go transform now." He murmured and rolled over. Harry simply picked up the potions book again.
“Okay, I’m going to see Dumbledore now!” Harry told him and kissed him again. Draco blinked a few times… was he on drugs? They learned about this muggle studies, he was pretty sure. They had their own version of herbology and potions that kind of mixed together and you could come up with nonsense like this. “Your eyes are like stars.” Harry informed him very seriously before bouncing off again, “We should eat chocolate later - with treacle tart!”
"Draco, look!" Ron said and also pushed between them to hold up his watch, "See? It's us. I have the watch!" He said and Draco stared at him - silver eyes calculating. Harry had always been quite partial to Draco's eyes. They were the only part of him that Harry couldn't fully read. Over the years, he had learned all of his boyfriend's mannerisms... which wasn't too hard since Draco was really an expressive person in general, but he had never mastered his eyes. There was really no telling what he was thinking just going off of them. They were always calculating - forever figuring out some mystery problem that the world didn't know needed to be solved. It was fun to try and decipher on a normal day, but now? When Draco was too covered in blood and bruises and
Molly asked and Harry immediately mumbled an apology as Draco snickered at him, "Speaking of which, I spoke to Ron, darling. He said to go ahead." She smiled to him. Draco nodded. He knew Ron would agree either way, but it was nice to have confirmation.
Oh, as if he could forget. Slipping on a new set of robes, he lifted his hood back up, making sure to cover most of his face as he went out. He waited until he took a few more turns until he apparated.
is that you’re sabotaging yourselves.” He said, “Figure it out tonight or I’m going to stand on top of the Gryffindor table and ask people for you.” He told them as he tossed Ron’s robes on his bed.
“I can’t believe you got him started on this again.” Ginny said, “He went on and on about this to Fred and George, already.” She sighed and sipped her tea. Neville, on the other hand, was nodding.
“So was it mutual or what?” He asked and Draco groaned. He kind of thought he had lucked out with being disowned sometimes. It saved him from more conversations just like this – though with less homophobia.
“Think about what you’re asking him to do!” Hermione said, voice quickly losing patience. “He’s chosen our side and that still isn’t enough for you? You want him to go around hating his parents to prove what exactly? What would that prove that we don’t already know? Harry, this is awful for him already. He’s on the opposite side of the war of people he loves and he is so scared that he’s willing to put himself in danger for both them and us. You’re being really unkind about this.” She said.
The class was… surprisingly enjoyable. Even without Hermione. Granted, Neville was no potioneer, but he wasn’t as horrid as Severus made him out to be. Besides, it was amusing to listen to him prattle on about some of the plants used in the potions in between anecdotes of his holidays. Severus cast them a few annoyed glances, but Draco’s equally fierce glare in return kept him away.
“Lucky guess.” He muttered and Draco gave a pleased laugh. Harriet was going to be a brilliant pet, he could already tell. “You’re
“Hilarious.” Draco said with a slight shake of his head as Ron left. If he had hoped for any peace to actually do the dishes it was quickly whisked away by Sirius slipping in the moment Ron left. He gave his cousin a wary look.
“Looks as though Malfoy is blocking Potter so he can catch the snitch. Um, I don’t quite see how he plans -
"Excuse me?" Another Hufflepuff asked, raising her hand eagerly, "Professor Potter won't tell us about your wedding and Professor Nott says we get extra credit if we write a paper about it so can you
Ah. Mudblood. Right. That wasn’t a good word around this crowd. He still didn’t quite get it… It was just a word. Hermione tried to explain it to him several times, but each time she just got more and more upset. Then Ron tried to explain and got mad. Harry seemed just as lost as Draco was… but for different reasons, probably.
“If you ask me a stupid question then I reserve the right to leave,” He said and Sirius clicked his tongue at him before bringing out a copy of Skeeter’s article. Draco groaned. “Not you too. I’m
“I know what I’m doing,” Draco reminded him, stretching out slightly, “Believe it or not, I’ve become pretty good at this Death Eater thing,” he said dryly, twirling his wand between his fingers. Sirius gave him a long look. “How are you doing?” He asked when he didn’t respond. “I, uh, heard about R.A.B.” He said.
“…Maybe a six?” He responded lightly. “No, a seven. Definitely a seven…And a half.” He said, winking at Draco. Ron was gaping – words spluttering incoherently until Hermione sighed and closed her book, tucking into her bag.
“Don’t touch him,” Draco snapped and pulled Harry back, yanking him away from Quirrell as he approached. “He sees his parents. That’s it. Keep yourself and the weird voice over there,” he warned.
"Maybe," he said after a couple minutes of consideration, "But I'm not really sure what else I could be. I'm not like you and Hermione with my grades." He said doubtfully. Draco rolled his eyes. Harry's grades - while not stunning - were acceptable in pretty much all areas that mattered. Besides, it wasn't like anyone would really care about the Boy-Who-Lived-Through-Bloody-Everything's grades. Assuming they won this war, he could ask to be Minister of Magic and the wizarding world would make it happen.
“It kills things, usually.” Hermione answered tersely, “They are highly regulated and mostly illegal in England-”
“You realize I’m a painting, right?” Regulus was saying and Sirius growled, picking up a cloak and draping it over the frame. “Wow,” Came the muffled response, “You got me there.”
blood. If he is to be punished it will be my hand or the Dark Lord’s!” She hissed and pressed the knife further into his hand so it went into the wood of the table beside him. “Do you understand me?” She whispered.
And things just kept getting weirder. Harry found a horcrux. Well, Draco assumed he had. There had been chaos at the ministry. Prisoners were released, Umbridge was robbed, and her very important locket had gone mysteriously missing. It was a little stressful, but Draco was confident Harry and the others were safe for the time being. Voldemort seemed far too interested in finding the Elder Wand to pay them much mind anyways. Gregorovitch had been his most recent victim, which was making Draco a little nervous. Voldemort would find out soon enough that Grindelwald had the wand and then...
“Take care of him,” he said with a nod towards Harry and moved away, “All of them. Tell Andromeda that I’ll see her as soon as I can, okay?” He asked, somehow knowing... knowing... he shook his head free of it. Bellatrix and Sirius were still dueling. He debated about transforming into his animagus form, but a voice in the back of his head cautioned him against. He was quick enough without it. Already, he was catching up to where Bellatrix was fending off Shacklebolt and Remus in order to keep up her current attack towards Sirius. At the last moment he leapt, sending both him and Bellatrix tumbling to the ground.
Draco was immediately entranced by the glass separating them from the lake. One girl was pressed up against the glass, smiling as she used her hands to signal various items to a mermaid, who was also nodding eagerly to whatever they were talking about.
“AND DON’T THINK I’M FORGETTING ABOUT YOU HARRY JAMES!” Andromeda snapped out. Harry, being Harry, only waved at the piece of the paper. “REMUS WAS GOOD FRIENDS WITH YOUR FATHER SO REST ASSURED I WILL BE CONTACTING HIM WITH DETAILS OF ALL OF YOUR NONSENSE OVER THE YEARS!”
“Ah, yes.” He mused, “For that I must thank you. Fawkes is said to come only when one shows extreme loyalty to me.” He smiled. Draco turned to look at Harry. That extreme loyalty hadn’t come from Draco that was for bloody sure. No offense to Dumbledore, but Draco would sell him out for a couple of galleons.
The words flooded his mind as skin felt as though it was hardening into ice. He wanted to push them away, but it felt as though tendrils were curling into his mind - bringing forward memories he didn't he know he had.
“Voldemort came back,” Draco told him as Ron flinched at the name, “We laid low in case he came looking for us, Gingerbread. That’s all.” He said. Relief played on Ron’s face.
“I’m going to break his nose,” Ron vowed with that expression of a hardened warrior that only a friend of Harry James Potter could have. “Then I’ll choke him with his scarf.”
”Seriously?” Harry asked, throwing up his hands, ”I went to school here too, you know! And you're also basically getting this job through nepotism-”
had not gone over well. The public backlash had been even more severe than it already was. It had made Draco's trial ridiculously easy. "You know, I'm the reason for court law put in place in 1999," he added.
“I get it,” Theo cut him off. “Tomorrow then?” He asked and Draco immediately nodded. “Good. Because I heard Beauxbatons is throwing a party and I want to see how lame it is.” He added and leaned over to kiss Draco. He really needed to work on not blushing so easily. His face was red all the way to the quidditch pitch.
fucking died? Part of him wanted to hiss in frustration. This was awful. And it should be illegal. The fear he felt right now? Illegal. Why wasn’t it illegal to feel this sick? Why were people laughing and clapping? He wanted to hex them until they screamed.
"It saved my life," Draco told him and Harry glanced up, "They were really on the fence with me... especially after the fight. All the little things though. My stuff with Montague. The knives. The fact I knew dark magic. My hand... it built me up quite the case. At least enough so they didn't kill me immediately." He said rubbed the back of his hands absently. Harry bit his lip.
“Oh, is it?” He snapped. Harry winced. He gave a quiet sorry as more people rushed onto the pitch. Lockhart seemed to be leading the charge, practically sprinting to them with wails of outrage. These people were damn lucky he wasn’t in contact with his father. He wondered if Andromeda had any pull with the ministry. Maybe she could sue them for him.
Draco grumbled, “Please, just stay out of it. Did you seriously follow me?” He asked and then narrowed his eyes. “Did Ron and Hermione go with you?” He asked. Harry at least looked a little guilty.
“I think this is a mistake,” he said, lowering his wand and turning to meet Yaxley’s eyes. “I know what the Dark Lord requested, but I don’t think we should do something that can’t be undone before he has all the facts.”
“My goodness,” Slughorn beamed, “I hadn’t realized what a group of entrepreneurs we had!” He said brightly. “Mr. Potter, I do admire your friends.” He chuckled. Draco rolled his eyes.
He gasped, "You were the specky git," he grumbled, thoroughly offended by the whole idea of being 'bony'. Please. "All scrawny with clothes three sizes too big."
Harry rolled his eyes and grabbed Draco’s arm. Before he could object (not that he would… it was just the principle of the matter), he was pulled out of the room towards the hallways.
"We need to move," Andromeda said and stood up, "I wish I could be of more help. The best I can do is tell you to find a way into Malfoy Manor." She said standing up, "You could also go and find Ted at Hogwarts. He can help you-"
Harry froze for a moment - body going unnaturally still before gasping. Draco dropped his wand, rushing over as Harry choked on air, moving to his side as he struggled to breathe again.
“Want a chocolate frog?” He offered and passed him a wrapped candy. Draco shook his head, but Harry only prodded him with it further until the other boy finally relented and unwrapped it.
Draco wasn’t sure what he had expected, quite honestly. Though now that everything had settled and he was left to mull over everything…
“McGonagall let you leave school?” he asked, a bit awed by the idea of such a thing. He didn't even think St. Mungo’s would heal animals… He would have taken Harriet there ages ago. Usually, as a kid, if his pet was ill his parents either got him a new one or hired somebody from France to fix the problem.
“I thought it was a normal wizard thing!” Harry defended as Draco tried hard - very hard - not to start yelling. Instead, he put a hand over his mouth before trying to speak again as calmly and rationally as he could.
“And I also have a boyfriend,” he told her. This seemed to capture her attention as she paused to look at him, “Listen, my boyfriend is a pureblood who is following the tradition of being forced into marriage even though he’s radicalized in every other way. Therefore, he’s asking this toad of a girl to the ball,” He explained. Fleur nodded. “Naturally, I’m annoyed by this and want to also ask someone to the ball to get back at him. I figured you were probably annoyed with all the creepy boys trying to get into your pants so I thought you would be a good person to go with.” He explained.
a runes section, but Winky apparently knows exactly where it is, which is how Harry ends up seeing one of the most stunning sights of his life.
Salazar Slytherin looks nothing like what Harry has imagined. Because surely, the man has been a mean, elitist, old asshole his entire life. He has no business looking young and playful, with black hair in a ponytail, dirt on his green suit, and a white marble wand tucked into flawless pants.
Honestly, how does Blaise expect him to behave after a statement like that. “We’re Slytherins. We don’t do things for other people’s benefits.”
“Don’t listen to him. He’s right of course, but he’s being a brat because I didn’t let him bring LuLu.”
“That’s a yes then...eatings? Yes, I makes sure Master Draco eats enough. Weekly interaction with Master Severus?”
His last thought before everything goes black is a vivid image of Pansy and Blaise cussing him out. Who knew he could predict the future?
The last time he had it was when Potter jumped down from Hagrid’s arms, and that action ended him in Azkaban. Not that he didn’t deserve it. If he had his way he’d be back in his cell, puckering up and hoping one of the Dementors felt a little frisky.
Hermione and the others come to her defense, but Draco watches her. He knows, with no doubt in his mind that she’s innocent. Even with Mr. Diggory, Prick In Charge of Something Important, reveals the last spell on Harry’s wand, that was very clearly in her hand. He knows. She didn’t do it.
“We were worried, Poppet. Draco’s been itching to come burn the whole manor down he’s been so worried.”
“I know you and Potter are friends, and that you worked together to free Sirius last year. I’m not angry, Draco, but I will be if you don’t tell me the truth.”
“I do not know how he found the chamber, or even where it is, but I do know that as soon as it was open the attacks started. They got worse and worse until a young girl was killed. Only then, when he feared punishment and realized how closely eyes began to watch him, did he close it. She was muggle-born, a Ravenclaw, one of the shy ones. Without her glasses, she couldn’t see anything, and everyone knew it. Some people used it to taunt her, she was always one to be bullied, not a single brave bone in her body. I never did get the full story, but one day, she ran into that bathroom crying, and never came out. Riddle got what he wanted in the end. Fear, and his first kill.”
The pent up worry doesn’t uncurl from his gut until he sees Harry Potter the next day at breakfast, in the middle of the table with, thankfully, no injuries and a flustered Wealsey beside him. He tries to keep his irritation to a minimum, staring over his morning fruit with a somewhat murderous glare Pansy is surely making a face at. Friendly conversation distracts him from the Daily Prophet’s ‘exclusive’ interview with his lying father, but it’s much harder to ignore the front page where the flying car moves. Merlin, he’s going to
“I think you missed the definition of a boggart that day in class. It is quite literally your biggest fear.”
Fleur nods through a mouthful of fruit, “True, even as a child Draco has never had problems with alcohol.”
Oh yeah, that had been the day Lucius told him how lovely his wand was on the fireplace, and how he was thinking about breaking it. A big mistake, telling a wizard where you were keeping their wand. He watches himself sit up and wait for a few hours before crawling to the door. Memory Draco stands and immediately falls, but grabs the wall at the last second to steady himself. He mumbles what Real Draco is sure to be the unlocking spell, and then the three are finally leaving the bloody dungeons.
“She did, take me to France I mean. She hasn't gotten a new husband yet, I think the whole blood contract thing is getting to her, but she’s happy I have people to protect me, even if she did curse me in every language I know, and a few I don’t.”
The dragon stills, wings flapping to keep them high in the sky. Harry can barely make out the tops of trees.
Around one is when McGonagall comes to tell them to go to sleep. They’re lucky they had time to hide the alcohol before she came, and that Fred and George had gone up to their dorm with some girls to play spin the bottle. With the wild parts of the party hidden, and their head of house gone, everyone more or less vanished into their beds and deep into sleep.
“You’ve had twelve hours, boy.” He hates her disappointed voice, it never bodes well for his body. “Twelve hours and you leave a mess? In my kitchen, in my
They take seats by the ledge, the night is a little cloudy from the leftover storm, but the moon still shines brightly. Draco doesn’t say anything, simply stares at Harry until he caves. It’s a nice view.
