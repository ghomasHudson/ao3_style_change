“HarryHarryHarryHarry
“I would do just about anything to not have people whisper about me on the streets,” he confesses. There’s just something about the darkness that allows thoughts to run freely. “Anything, to stop seeing my name splashed across papers, with wild accusations and conspiracies beneath it.”
Harry nods and thanks the man before Draco can agree himself.
~~~~~~~~
I barely hear him murmur, “I still don’t see why we can’t use orange…” I bury my face in my hands and groan aloud.
accept me before this.
“We can’t…” Standing up, I turn my back and flee the drawing room.
“Okay,” Potter agrees and holds out his arm. Draco takes it in his and Apparates the both of them onto the front step of his house.
“Um. Yes? Look, I don’t know what you’re getting at Hermione…”
That’s his brain talking, not his mind, and Harry shakes it away. There’s no way he’s dying from the cold, hypothermia be damned. If Draco could sit in a hole for days and only have a mild fever, Harry can survive this. He just needs to get closer to Draco. Hopefully being in the same room will be enough, but if it’s not, he’ll have to wake him up. That’s a good excuse for physical contact anyway. Hopefully it will be enough.
“You drive me crazy, so poised and perfect all the time. Look at how you fall apart,” Harry says, breathing harshly into Draco’s neck.
Draco huffs, but his head lolls back onto Harry’s shoulder. His eyes are bright silver in the darkness, alive with warmth despite his body turning steadily colder. He smiles softly at Harry, his expression open and trusting. It pulls at Harry’s heart, cutting him open and leaving him bare. Harry returns the smile and drops his head to nuzzle against Draco’s.
When his hand first touches his erection, it takes everything he has not to groan in pleasure. He can’t be loud, Malfoy is just a corridor away. Malfoy, who is flushed and sweaty and beautiful. Harry closes his eyes tightly, focussing on the bare chest he caught a glimpse of. He imagines Malfoy’s nipples, sees them pale pink in his mind. They harden, and he sees Malfoy reach for them to tug at the sensitive skin. Harry moans softly and his fingers wrap around his cock.
The silence that’s somehow grown becomes overwhelming, the tension thick enough to overcome them both. It’s no surprise really when Draco snaps. Unable to keep sitting there in silence
Harry watches from the towel as his boyfriend sits up and reaches the bottle of sun lotion. He closes his eyes again as he watches Draco approach him. Expecting to feel a warm hand smothering the cream onto his skin, massaging it in gently, he is then very startled when something totally different happens. He is blanketed in a charm.
She couldn’t sound any less interested, but Draco doesn’t care. He thinks it quite fits the aesthetic of the store.
night; he’s not the barbarian Malfoy seems to think he is—and combs a moisturising mask into it. He leaves the bathroom and closes the door with a click, making his way to the bedroom.
“That’s… impressive,” Draco says, sitting back against the couch cushions. “And you figured all of that out just now?”
Blaise’s rose is stunning too, pinks and oranges blending together like a sunset. Draco hadn’t known what to paint for Blaise—or Theo, for that matter—and had had to research possible flowers. Eventually he’d found a Francis blaise rose, and while there wasn't much on it, there was enough for him to clutch at. He’s glad he did, because the painting is truly one of his best. With yellow magic winding around the stem and bursting around the petals, it really ties it all together. Draco charmed the magic to warm up when touched, and while he wouldn’t normally encourage hands on his work, he knows Blaise will regardless. It might as well have some effect, and adding some extra wards to protect the paint isn’t exactly hard.
“I’d like to see you try,” Harry quips.
“Your paintings, of course!”
“You’d better,” Draco snarls, thrusting his hips up into Harry’s face.
There’s a soft moan behind him, and Draco nearly jumps out of his skin. His eyes flash open and his heart races, his hands itching for his wand. His wand! Where the fuck is it? It’s not against his thigh, or under his pillow, or— He doesn’t have a pillow…? Why doesn’t he have a pillow?!
Harry clutches at Draco’s face, gripping tightly as if he’s afraid to let go. Draco responds in equal, his hands tightening around Harry’s neck and threading his fingers into the dark hair. Suddenly desperate to feel their bodies touching, Draco pulls away and walks around the coffee table. Harry reaches out and drags their mouths back together, his hands now grabbing Draco’s waist. Draco moans when their chests come into contact, his hands clutching at Harry’s back. He aligns their hips too, causing both of them to groan as their growing cocks collide. Even through the layers of fabric, Draco can feel the heat radiating off of Harry, and hums happily. Draco is impatient and needy during sex, and all he wants is to Vanish both of their clothes and get straight to it. Harry seems to prefer the slow, teasing method of doing things, and Draco isn’t about to stop him.
friends behind it. Pansy has this thing where she thinks danger brings out emotions faster and what not. I don’t think it makes much sense, but there was something about desperat—” Draco cuts off, hiding his face in his hands. “Sorry, I’m rambling.”
I threw up today. It’s been 24 days since this whole thing started. Scars have made themselves a home between my shoulder blades, permanently tormenting me. I wish not for the first time that I’d done something sooner. Before I was in over my head. Potter had better get here soon.
Malfoy leaps up a second later and tugs Harry along with him, saying something about a bookstore he wants to check. Harry is lost by the time they arrive at the front of a shop, but sees a sign declaring ‘50% off the second book!’
Harry shakes his head. “The fact that Ron, who hasn’t seen you at all while you’ve been here, had to tell me, means I was clearly the more oblivious.”
“Fucking Merlin!” I retort. She makes me want to pull my hair out sometimes at how observant she is. “How on earth could you know that?”
Sometimes, when something has been tampered too much or too carelessly, there are signs of fatigue and strain visible. Of course, they’re only apparent to people who know what they’re looking for; Draco is not one of those people. He’s seen plenty of
Harry thinks about that for a second. “It is really quite strange, isn’t it?” He asks, and they begin walking through the forest quickly. “All of the clothes we actually wear were in the cottage, enough towels, food that somehow keeps appearing in the pantry and fridge… It’s just suspicious.”
He plucks a grape off the vine and pops it into his mouth. It bursts with juice, crisp and sharp. Harry smiles at the simplicity of it, and eats another. He wants to talk to Draco, is itching to get back to London, but it can wait. A part of himself is also aware that once they leave, whatever is between him and Draco will probably vanish as well, fizzing out into nothing over time. He doesn’t want that to happen, he actually wants Draco around now. He can’t believe he thinks that, but it’s true. Draco is an amazing person, clever, witty, quick on the uptake. Gorgeous, funny, sarcastic. Everything Harry craves for in a person. The irony of those traits belonging to his old school rival isn’t lost on him either.
“Draco,” Harry sighs. “I really like you, and I’m sorry for running.” He steps closer still, eyes locked onto Draco’s.
“Pansy, look. Calm down for a second.”
as she insists—has been helping me ever since we found the empty room this morning. Harry ended up going to the Burrow for an hour while Hermione arrived at Grimmauld, and he told everyone there the situation. At least, as much of the situation that was possible to tell. Which ended up going something like ‘something has come up at Grimmauld, and I can’t stay long’. Apparently, everyone there knew something bigger was up, but they didn’t push it and let Harry come back as soon as possible.
Harry pauses, wand-pen above the page. How much should he include? This is just dot points for now, but he will eventually turn it into an actual report. Should he just write everything he can remember? He doesn’t know, which really gives away how often he does this. He sighs, deciding it’s best to just get it all out there.
Later that same evening, I start to grow restless. With nothing else in my room, I’ve resorted to lying on my bed, face buried in a pillow. I don’t know what I’m doing with myself. Why I allowed myself to get into this mess. Why I even bothered coming back to the Manor. I wonder, not for the first time, why I’m given so much freedom. Well, except for right now, of course. I’m generally permitted all through the Manor and it’s grounds. I’m given unlimited access to anywhere on the continent, so long as I can be traced.
Potter releases a groan as he falls, before crawling up Draco’s body to crash their lips together again. It’s a quick yet strong kiss, lasting only a few seconds. He then trails down Draco’s neck, sucking and biting gently at the delicate skin. When he arrives at his shoulders, he licks up and down his collar bones. Taking particular care at the junction of neck and shoulder, he nibbles more marks into them. The feeling is intense, forcing Draco to rock his hips up and let out a breathy moan. Potter delights in the noise, and kisses his mouth again. He then leaves a trail of kisses all the way down Draco’s chest, licking stripes where his shirt hangs open. Feeling desperate, he pushes Potter away and tears his shirt off. Bare skin is revealed, and Draco leans back down. Gesturing for the other man to continue, he is disappointed when he notices that Potter is frozen.
. There is a series of static in my ear, which I think is words. I grab my wand and sharpen the sound so I can hear Harry talking to me.
Harry’s head snaps to Draco. He could swear he just heard… No. That’s impossible, and Harry doesn’t want to think about it. There’s no way Draco just said his name in his sleep. If he did, Harry would be forced to reconsider certain things. He doesn’t want to, he’s safe in his assumptions, he doesn’t need to think about the chance Draco likes him back.
Potter looks sheepish. “I was going to tell you when I saw you last night, but then…”
And then there’s the Seekers. Potter and I are on opposite ends of the pitch, scouring the sky for a tiny, and deadly fast golden ball. Both of us are diving every so often, fooling the other into thinking we’ve found it. I rake my eyes in every direction, almost straining with the effort. That’s when I see movement out of the corner of my left eye. I instead turn my head to the right and take off in that direction. I can hear the Snitch’s wings beating next to my head, but I never look at it. I can now see Potter chasing after me, seeking the right to victory for his team. He pulls up behind me, and I can feel his gaze linger on my every move, looking for the ball. But I’m dragging him in the other direction, away from his sought after prize. And he’s falling for it. Thinking he’s so clever all the while making an utter fool of himself. I then grab the front of his broom from behind me and spin it around, sending the boy whirling to the ground. Turning my own broom the other way, I start to chase after the Snitch. The golden streak never leaves my sight, and I twist and turn around the other players. The crowd is cheering me on, and Slytherin is going to win. I reach forward with my right my hand, my left still on the broom, steadying it so I don’t fall. I make to grab the ball and pull it from the sky, but I come back with nothing. I stare at my hand and then the spot where the Snitch was, utterly confused. Then the crowd stands and starts cheering wildly again. I look around me and see Potter holding his hand up high. I can just make out a streak of gold in between his thumb and the palm of his hand. He faces me and an amused smile lights his face. That’s it. My broom drops from my hand, and I’m rushing to meet the ground.
to be here!” The voice rings absolutely familiar now. The tone of irritation mixed with worry, mixed with impatience, can only belong to one person. I drop my knife, letting it ring out loudly in the room. A quick intake of breath nearby startles me, and I freeze again. But then the bookshelf is being pulled away from the wall, and I can once again see my room.
“Oh. Of course.” I feel so stupid, yet puzzled. How come I’m still here if they know the truth?
“Draco,” Harry murmurs. He grips Draco’s shoulders, digging his fingers into the flesh there in the way he knows grounds his husband. “If you were that same boy, you wouldn’t have married me. You wouldn’t have swallowed your pride, admitted you were gay, and left your parents in the dust.
Potter rolls his eyes. He flicks his wand at Draco and the paint is cleared from his skin. Draco nods his thanks. “Also, is that my hoodie?”
Draco flinches. “Really?!”
“I tell you I nearly committed suicide, and you tell me you love me?” Harry sounds incredulous.
*~*~*~
Draco huffs a breath, but the grin that pulls at his features gives away his humour. “We need to run more tests, need to figure out why the courtyard could have been duplicated. Nothing seems to make sense so far.”
Footsteps echo through my charmed and protected bedroom, and Potter is back by my bed. He looks extremely worried when he catches sight of me. I can’t look that bad, surely. Maybe he’s worried because of my injuries? But why would he care? I push my nagging thoughts away and make to get off the bed. I hiss through gritted teeth, but stand up on my own two feet anyway. I wish I hadn’t. Pain spreads, shooting from my back, up to my neck and down my legs. I immediately collapse and land heavily on the mattress behind me.
and what looks to be a portable table top that sits on your legs. Hermione sees me watching and smiles. As she sits down behind the tree, and invite some to join her.
“Definitely the latter. An argument broke out between a man and a woman, and it only stopped when the leader broke it up. When they made to leave, some of them hugged and others only shook hands.”
Malfoy sighs, a put upon expression on his face. He rubs the back of his neck uncomfortably. “Men often threaten to sleep with me if I don’t do whatever it is they want me to do.”
look like this ‘fridge’. Cold, hard, white plastic. I open it up and my eyes bug out of my head.
My fist presses lightly against my lips, my head tilting off to the side. “You mean…?”
~Marvelous job on the incantation. Meet me next to the lake tomorrow night after you tutor whichever kid’s turn it is?~

“I have an idea,” he says, pulling the plug out of the drain. Draco realises he’s been cleaning spotless dishes for the last couple of minutes. He closes his eyes, breathes deeply, and hopes his mind can keep up.
It’s just that now it’s the Dark side trying to get to me. And it’s also Harry keeping me safe. Another blow against both him and I in their minds. Another reason to take him down. It makes me all the more determined to not let any harm come to him.
“Been reading a dictionary?!” The girl sneers.
“My first question will be why, then.” She draws a line across the page and scribbles down a new heading.
Harry pulls off and meets Draco in another kiss, his jaw slack. Harry moans into Draco’s mouth, lining their hips up and pressing down. Draco jolts under him at the pressure, eyes snapping open. He fastens his mouth to Harry’s neck and sucks hard, rocking his hips up to meet Harry’s.
*~*~*~
“I’m going to guide you.” She accepts my reasoning, and I slowly start dicing the root. My hand gently moves up and down, making circles in the air before cutting. Once I’m halfway through one root, I remove my hand. She looks up at me and sees me nod quickly. She resumes her cutting and succeeds in making little slices of ginger root.
“Robards,” he says with a quick nod. “I am here to collect the file on the Bound Spoon.” The case name sounds utterly pathetic, but Draco has had enough experience by now to know that his boss loves giving ridiculous titles. It’s meant to ‘make filing more fun’. Draco disagrees. Instead of it sounding like the centuries-old spoon holds ancient and deadly magic that could wipe out the population of London, it sounds like a rusted spoon that has rope tied firmly around the handle. Significantly less threatening, and infinitely more boring.
It’s my free period, the sun is shining and warm for September, yet I’m stuck in the Potions Classroom tutoring this hopeless child. The Fourth Year girl is just as stupid as the Third Year I have been tutoring, but she isn’t pretending to be bad. She just is.
“So Pansy, how are you?” The basic inquiry rolls off my tongue, and I’m pleased that I still sound put together.
“Why did you wake me?” Draco asks, stifling a yawn.
Harry watches as Terry scoffs, fists his hands in Theodore’s shirt, and tugs him close. The kiss is a harsh peck, over in a second. Theo looks stunned, and then he’s hauling Terry back in. This time, it’s closer to snogging, and earns a few wolf whistles.
He only shakes his head. “That’s not the saying,” he says. “What’s got your wand in a knot?” He adds when Malfoy looks up at Harry for the first time as he shuffles into the kitchen.
“Probably… a year? The wood is still high quality, the corners and edges sharp. The magic is also potent, not worn thin with age.”
Potter heaves a sigh. “Okay then.” He begins pacing up and down the courtyard, never straying too far away but never coming too close either. “Physical exam,” he says, face lighting up. “Maybe there’s something there we haven’t found yet, some easy way to string the magic back.”

Draco chokes back a laugh. “That’s awful,” he says, but doesn’t protest at all when Harry presses kisses to the insides of his thighs.
the bone extending from my skin. The jarred skeleton of wings catches on almost everything I pass. I frequently hit them against walls and doors, my skin snagging whenever I reach behind myself for something.
“Did you ask for a whole shelf?” I ask him sarcastically, half expecting the answer to be yes.
“In the bedroom…? Oh.”
Harry beams at him, placing the gift down and pulling Draco into him for a kiss. His lips are rough against Draco’s, but it’s intoxicating. Especially when they’re used to open his ars— No. He does

Draco sighs in relief. He’s so happy to hear those words. “Wait one moment,” he says, searching for his wand again.
“Harry, please,” Draco begs, trying to play Harry’s weaknesses.
Almost.
Harry shakes his head, reluctantly amused. “So? Do I get the hot chocolate or not?”
I wake up in a cold sweat, sheets tangled and night clothes twisted. What was that…? I yawn and stretch my back and my arms. I sigh at the nightmare I just woke up from, and rise to my feet. I change into my robes for the day, style my hair, and clean my teeth again, before I draw open the curtain around my bed. It’s still dark out, and Blaise is lightly snoring from his bed. I throw my covers back into place and pull my curtains closed, before quietly crossing to the door and exiting the dorm. I tiptoe down the stairs, avoiding non-existent creaks in the timber. I pace through the Common Room and out into the corridor.
“You were multitasking? Harry Potter, the world renowned idiot, was

Ginny and Luna are softer than the others, but no less resolute. After playing Quidditch for years, Ginny has become very unwavering in her focus. When she’s on a task she doesn’t slow down until the very end. Luna… isn’t naturally as determined as the others. At least not in her own way. If she’s searching for an answer to something, or for evidence one of her creatures exist, she won’t stop. Coupled with Ginny, she is just as reckoning as anyone else. Surely the six of them could pull together and find Harry? They’d have to. But the world is quite big, and the only things he knows for certain about where he is, is that it’s English speaking and in the northern hemisphere. It doesn’t make the search any less daunting.
“Is that the extent of what you know?” Granger asks.
“I’m so sorry that I’m so oblivious,” I say.
“Well. What did you find?”
“How do you know?” Draco asks, deciding work can wait for a while.
It’s gorgeous, although obviously not finished yet. All it
“Are you scared?”
Harry pads into the kitchen, his feet bare on the floor. His red t-shirt sticks to the water droplets left over on his skin, and he tugs at it as he walks. Arriving in the small kitchen, he tries to decide what to cook. Yesterday he had barely eaten, so caught up with being annoyed at Malfoy for leaving that he hadn’t looked after himself. The only productive thing he’d done in the kitchen was cleaning up Malfoy’s bowl of porridge. Harry hates porridge, and he had done it with a screwed up nose and a lot of complaints. Now though, he has to decide what to cook for himself. After scouring over the contents of the cupboard and fridge, he gives up. He’s just not bothered cooking anything today. He grabs a green apple from the fruit bowl and calls it quits. It reminds him of Malfoy. He curses himself and bites into it, determined to not think of the man for a little while.
The tip of his index finger makes contact with Potter’s cheek. His skin is so warm, just as Draco had imagined. He moans quietly, and drags his finger across the skin. It moves easily, and he dips it down towards Potter’s lips. It hovers there, not quite touching but still
with all that muscle on him. He thinks that, even if he
Harry’s too far gone though, too caught up in his own mind. He runs out of sight down the corridor, and the slamming door a few seconds later tells Draco he’s locked himself in the bedroom.
“Yes. Have you thought of anyone that could fit that description?”
“I’m good,” Draco says. “I don’t want to die from weird Muggle snacks. I’m going to go find my bedroom.” He ignores the tongue being stuck out at him. Merlin. Who knew Potter was so… so… Okay, Draco can’t find a word adequate enough, but
Draco smiles at him, trying to hide some of his fondness. If Harry knew just how smitten he is, he’d laugh at him until he passed out. Well, probably not, but it’s the principle of the matter.
As he enters the room and walks to the bed, he can’t find it in himself to cast his own cleaning charms. He instead chooses to just slide under the covers and put his head on the pillow. It still smells like Malfoy. Harry sighs to himself and doesn’t think about it. He falls asleep quickly, out like a light.
“Yeah?” He asks, turning to me fully. When he sees my expression, concern takes over his features. “Is something wrong?”
The last little building on this side of the road is rather nondescript. It’s in the same red brick as the pavement from the plaza, and has a regular, black roof. Well, it looks black, but it is plausible that it’s just dirt and grime. Harry has no idea what it could be, and walks ever closer trying to make it out. He doesn’t come up with a single idea, and there isn’t a sign out the front either. Not wanting to break in—despite no one being around and having already entered two shops—he looks through the small windows in determination. Nothing. It’s only as he’s turning away and losing hope that a poster inside gives it away. “Best Butcher, 1995”. Well, that answers both of his questions. It’s a butchershop and the village was shut down only eight years ago.
Harry squeezes his hand now, and leans forward to plant a kiss on his forehead. “I feel the exact same way. The only thing that stops that, is your presence. Keeping me anchored even after the explosion.”
“Harry and I have an announcement,” he says, voice clear and well practised.
“Going for a walk, doing my first round as House Representative.” The lie slips easily off my tongue, and I think I’ve fooled him.
“Curse you gods!” Potter shouts, shaking his fist at the sky. “You do that at least once every day.”
“No, sick pale. How are you feeling?”
if that makes you feel more secure.” He moves a hand to the back of my head and rubs it gently. “I’ll go in myself if I have to, Draco. Narcissa won’t be allowed to come to any danger.”
“Here you go,” Potter murmurs as he shuffles into the bedroom. He doesn’t say anything about the lights, passing Draco a flask and adjusting his grip on the glass of water.
“How’d you learn to do that?” Potter eventually gasps out, a hand rubbing at his wrists and throat. Anyone would think it was
“Why do you need to know that? I have been the only one doing any work on our assignment so far, or have you decided you’d help?!”
“Only 47 years old,” Harry asks incredulously the second they’re out of earshot. “That’s ridiculously recent for a village that looks like this!”
Draco allows sleep to wash over him, and tries not to think of Harry pressed against him as he drifts off. The last thing he needs is for his dreams to taunt him with a reality he can’t allow to happen. He can’t let himself fall for the man, because the sentiment will never be returned.
out of the corners of his eyes as he resets the board. “That’s the fastest win you can get.”
pale, he can never hide it. “I was cold, and thought body heat might work more than the blankets.”
he probably would have been sitting in front of the fire pouring over a boring text book about a subject he doesn’t care about. Still, it would be preferable to walking through the cold halls in silence with only Malfoy for company. Suppressing a shiver, Harry wordlessly casts a warming charm over his skin. He shudders as the delicious warmth encompasses him. Malfoy looks at him oddly, before a frown crosses his pointed features. He quickly tugs the frown into an odd shape that no one would understand. Except that Harry does. Rolling his eyes and scowling at him, he casts a second warming charm over the blond.
“Draco, no,” Harry says, sitting back and leaning over to suck on Draco’s nipples again.
Draco pinches the bridge of his nose. “Fine.”
Draco is doomed. He breathes in the scent, delighting in the warmth it brings him. It’s ridiculous, he knows it is. But he can’t stop himself. Yesterday was a disaster he would like to wipe from his memory, would like to burn off the face of the earth. It wasn’t even that bad; actually, his time alone was going really well. It had started off innocently enough, just reading his newest novel in bed. And then he read a rather… steamy scene and couldn’t help sliding his hand down the front of his pants, taking himself in hand and—
Draco swiftly sets some more spells in place, keeping it at the same temperature and preventing anything from reacting negatively. This is a really important step, as when he adds the next ingredients things don’t hold for very long without it. Once magic is added, it just seems to keep piling up. He picks up the container of whipped cream and dollops a hefty amount on top of the drink. Then, he dribbles it with chocolate syrup, and places some marshmallows gently into the cream. He allows himself to actually smile now. Making hot cocoa always cheers him up. Draco flicks his wand and everything he’d set out whips back into its proper place.
“No! Did you decorate it?” Draco makes his way closer to Harry, taking in the rainbow tree from a distance.
After drying himself off, going through his ridiculously long morning routine yet again, and getting dressed into the clothes he’d taken from the bedroom, Draco moved into the kitchen to make breakfast. Cooking is held close to his heart these days. He’s reminded of the calmness he feels each time he stands before the stove or the oven. It’s amazing, how something that he never had a part in as a child has become such a big part of his adulthood. Pushing those thoughts away, he scans the cupboards and fridge, looking for inspiration for breakfast. He decides he’ll suffer through porridge today. It’s literally freezing outside, and porridge is just the right amount of filling and hearty to last him for a while. Even if the taste and consistency is enough to have his stomach curl in on itself.
He keeps the kiss slow, innocent and gentle. His hands find Draco’s on his own head, holding them securely and prying his fingers out of his hair. Draco whines as his hand is removed, but Harry allows to move it to the back of his neck. He seems to perk up at that, deepening the kiss.
“Nothing in particular,” the other man mumbles, dragging his index finger along the books’ spines. He pauses, lifting his head to look Harry in the eyes. “I found this shop in the other village and was desperate to look at the books. I left without touching anything though.”
“I nearly killed myself.” Draco had felt himself spiralling despite knowing it was coming. But now, in the present and not the past, he’s thought about it a bit and knows how to respond. How to comfort his not-quite-boyfriend. Draco swallows, tugs Harry closer.
Swallowing drily I manage to whisper, “They’re in there, Hermione. They are actually in there, with dozens of guests.”
“Not now, Draco,” Harry murmurs, pulling away from his addicting mouth.
It’s not like it’s much of a surprise; he’s known he’s bisexual for
“Thanks,” he says, voice rough. “That helped a lot.”
something. This always helps him feel better, and the stranger seems to know what he’s doing. Draco grinds down, rolling his hips harder. He finds the man’s cock just as hard as his own, pressing against his jeans. If the outline is anything to go by, his cock is huge. Draco wants it inside him, wants to feel himself split open with it.
Draco pauses. “I thought you’d argue that…”
Malfoy moves to enter the shop when something else catches his eye.
Draco doesn’t bother telling him that it’s impossible to ‘string back’ magic that is no longer there.
“Calling me what?”
“Fine,” Draco laughs. “Was gonna come, is all.” He looks over his shoulder and smiles at Harry, whose emerald eyes light up.
On the nights when Harry lies awake, mind tormented with the abuse the Dursleys made him suffer through, he tries to picture them as they might be now. Maybe they’ve grown out of their anti-magic bigotry, maybe they’ve realised that life isn’t long enough for the deep-seated hatred he experienced at their hands. He knows it’s fruitless, that nothing he dreams up will come to pass. But he’s also seen Draco leave behind his past beliefs, so he has to hold out hope.
ones. There are some shaped like hearts or teddy bears, meant to be endearing. There’s no way in hell he’s buying those for her. He moves slowly down the shelving, eventually coming across the multicoloured ones. The bath bomb directly in front of him has swirls of blue, green, and purple, lines of silver streaking through it. When he picks it up and smells it, he discovers it’s scented like champagne and strawberries. Pansy would love it.
A stone flies at Harry, landing at his feet and thudding into the snow. Harry shouts something unintelligible at Draco, but there’s no response. He listens carefully, trying to pinpoint where Draco is behind him. There’s nothing, no sound to give away another person’s presence. He slows to a stop, turning his body fully to search for him.
Harry chuckles, unable to help himself at the wide eyes looking at him. “Sure, what is there?”
“Hey Harry…” I murmur, not wanting to make a lot of noise.
“What?” He asks, eyes darkening again at Draco’s obvious approval.
“What? Do you have plans for today or something?” It’s meant to come out as a drawl, but Draco doesn’t quite succeed. He hopes Potter misses it with his rapid moving and panicking.
wants to do is curl back up and go to sleep again.
“I’ve never thought of it like that…” Draco whispers. “That makes sense though.”
Harry smiles gently, before slowly bringing their lips together. This time, it isn’t passionate or hungry, but slow and sweet. As if he agrees with everything said in the darkened room, and wants Draco to understand that he will always be that chain.
He’s clearly struggling to finish the sentence, so Harry just nods. Malfoy relaxes a bit and jumps enough so his feet lift off the ground. He wraps his legs around it too, and nods. Harry heaves a breath and tugs. If the vine didn’t weigh a ton before, it is doubly so now. Malfoy isn’t particularly heavy, but combined with the rain-soaked vine it’s a struggle for Harry to lift it; especially from this angle. He huffs another breath and blows his cheeks out. He needs to do this. Needs to get Malfoy up to safety.
Harry rolls his eyes but picks the box up before carrying it back into the living room. He shuts the cupboard door with barely a word and plops the box down. It’s heavier than it looks. He sets it up so it’s standing on end, opening the top. He quickly sees that this
One of them stands out to me. It is a book bound in a beautifully deep red, with black letters spelling out ‘Coloured Veins’. Well, that explains the colouring. I flip it over and read through the blurb. It’s about a world not unlike my own, but one of the witches can see people’s emotions by the colour of their veins. She goes her whole life thinking everyone can see them, only to bring it up and be shot down by others around her. Both figuratively and literally. It seems really interesting, so I charm it to float behind me as I continue searching.
Harry groans as he sees it, but kisses him again to show Draco that he doesn’t quite mean it. Draco smiles softly at him, sitting next to him on the bed with their gifts in the middle.
is a well known gay bar in Wizarding London. Despite everyone there knowing who he is and exactly what he has done, he can always find a way to forget the day. Whether that is drinking until he is stumbling home or losing himself in a stranger’s body, this club always works out. And today has been an especially hard one. Draco knows he isn’t the only man who has a challenging time sometimes. He does know though, that no one’s bad days are quite the same as his. No one else can say that they nearly killed people to save their own skin, or that they drugged multiple strangers, or that they let Death Eaters into Hogwarts… No matter how many people are telling him that he wasn’t a bad person, that he was just acting under duress, he can’t believe it. It’s a mindset, a dangerous one, but one that he takes comfort in all the same.
me,” Draco says, legs tightening around Harry’s waist.
The squirrel doesn’t give up, but it does release its hold slightly. With its claws out of his back, Draco can breathe a little easier. The little animal scratches his skin with it’s foot, it’s tail brushing the back of Draco’s neck. It’s rain sodden, the normally fluffy fur compressed with water. The squirrel makes a sound like chirping, and then begins sliding down Draco’s back. It scrabbles, trying to get a grip on the torn, wet shirt. It doesn’t succeed, grunting as it slides all the way down his back and left leg. It flops to the ground, making a squelching sound as it hits the mud.
The people around me jump to their feet and run to me, practically begging for this potion that will wake them up. I don’t bother to say that the fact they’re running already demonstrates some level of wakefulness, just hand out glass bottles. They nod and smile at me in thanks, and each grateful person fills a hole in my heart. I am well and truly on the right side now, my past forgiven by each of the people to wordlessly thank me. I can see it in their eyes that it’s more than thanks for the potion.
Draco does as he is told, and stares into emerald circles as he comes. He cries out a string of curses, his cum pulsing out of his cock. He drops back onto his mattress, short of breath and flushed all over. White streaks cover both his and Potter’s chests, and he suddenly doesn’t know what to do with himself. That is, until he sees that Potter is still achingly hard. With a glint in his eye that he can
can’t hear
“And what, Malfoy?” Harry says, sounding tired and annoyed. “Did you think I’d hate you or something?”
“I thought that would get your attention,” Draco laughs. “Yes. And it’s totally up to you.
“Working out,” Potter says with a shrug, reaching for a towel and dragging it across his forehead. “Why are
He shakes in the aftershocks, mind totally blissed out and blank. Harry doesn’t think he’s ever come that quickly in his life—apart from maybe when he was fifteen. Harry does nothing but breathe for a second, letting his body cool down and his blood redistribute. He pats around on the couch for his wand, and once he finds it he casts a cleaning charm over both himself and the couch beneath him. He tucks himself back into his pants and pulls his jeans back up, deciding not to think about what he’s just done.
“Of course, Hermione.”
“Not right now, but at some point probably.” He’s never bottomed before, never this easily at least, but he wants to try with Draco. Draco would be calm and sure, confident, focused on Harry’s pleasure. It sounds amazing. But not right now.
It’s really quite interesting, what someone can learn just from watching them go about their lives. For example, Potter is always running his hands through his hair, scratching at his head. Always rubbing the back of his neck, as if it will somehow stop him feeling awkward or embarrassed. He does it quite a lot right now, always touching his head or neck. Draco doesn’t want to think about what that means. He doesn’t want to think too much about anything where Potter is concerned.
Draco grumbles something and burrows further into the blankets. He doesn’t move Harry’s hand off him though, so that’s something.
“Fancy lube huh?” Draco teases. “Do you keep it on you all the time, or just when you‘re after a hookup?”
“They called it ‘The Golden Door’,” Draco says. “I’m not sure if that’s named after the cursed gold that we never found, or the Golden Boy,” he teases. “Probably the latter.”
Draco sighs, melting into the caress. He feels safe, secure. Loved. “You are too.”
There is a dim light peeking out from under the bedroom door, and I force myself to count to four and just breathe for a second. There’s no telling how Mother might be on the other side of the door, and I can’t allow myself to believe that she’ll be fine. I need to be prepared for bad news, as much as I’d like the opposite for once. Harry pushes me in front of him and nods to the handle. He wants me to open it. I open my mouth, trying to think of something to say to thank him, but then decide that there aren't nearly enough words to convey it properly. So I lean close and capture his lips in a kiss, morning—or, evening?—breath be damned. Harry snakes his arms around my waist, but instead of pulling me closer like I’d expected, he pushes me away.
Harry flops onto the couch innocently just as Draco leaves the bathroom, sauntering into the living room. Honestly, who actually
“Of course. I’ve seen ones falling apart and chipped everywhere.”
“Here is your food, gentlemen. Enjoy.” The waitress puts their plates on the table and takes her leave, bowing out of the way as if attending kings.
Even with everything clicking into place rather neatly, there’s still something bothering him. It tugs at his mind and heart, but he can’t seem to work out what it is. Deciding to come back to it later, he picks out some clean clothes and makes his way to the bathroom for another long shower.
Draco closes his eyes, his heart thumping in the dark room. Azkaban is far from a new dream, but the Vanishing Cabinet is. He’d managed to work most of that fear and anxiety away when he was seventeen, after he’d botched his mission but had somehow managed to stay alive. The combination of the two was horrendous, like an icy fist closing around his heart. Draco shudders and is suddenly aware of how cold he is. The sound of running water fills the cottage, and Draco tries not to think of the ocean he could hear in the dream. Azkaban is perched on an island after all, nearly impossible to escape from.
“Okay then,” I exhale. “Better get some parchment.”
“I have the file,” Draco confirms as a response to the look in Jekins’ eye. Only the one, piercing blue. She lost the other one early in her career, when she was still working as a field agent. Apparently one of the Cursers — an inside joke between everyone in the department as a play on the Curse-Breakers’ name — stabbed it with his wand and then pulled it right out of the socket. Draco isn’t quite sure he believes it, but it is a good story.
As he rifles through things, Harry finds all of the ingredients required for avocado and poached eggs on toast. Grinning at his luck of finding his favourite breakfast ingredients in an abandoned cottage, he gathers all of them up and lays them out.
“My ribs-”
Draco presses a kiss to his forehead, wrapping his arms around him. “I know Harry. But I’m okay, and you didn’t mean it.”
He chews his cheek. “I don’t think you’d want to know.”
“Should I buy you something?”
Eventually I had realised that I could just shove it into a bag and throw it out, so that’s what I did. I looked around the room and was quite happy with my progress. And then the walls had caught my attention. I remember scowling so hard my face hurt, before viciously ripping at the paper. By the time my disgust had worn away, most of the wallpaper was scattered on the floor. I also swept that up into a bag, and then removed the rest civilly with the help of some water and a lot of patience. All the while I was doing that, the carpet under my feet was starting to fall apart. The soles of my feet had hurt and I was growing tired. I took a break for a while, moving downstairs and finding something to eat in that truly horrendous kitchen.
Draco hums, kissing his cheek. “I’m sure you’ll figure it out.” He takes another bite of his sandwich. “You know? I might cast some charms over the items we found, something has to be there.”
for once.” Potter looks kind of smug about that, and Draco can’t figure out why.
“My mother always got the house elves to make it for me when I was cold. I can smell it a mile away now.”
“You’ve corrupted him!”
Sighing, he throws open the closet. He hadn’t wanted to look inside, worried that his brain would see Malfoy’s clothes and run. It has a very annoying habit of looking at someone’s clothing, seeing the lines and cut, and then picturing what that person looks like without it on. He
Letter in hand, he comes up to me back in Mother’s room. It’s a heavy parchment, a Ministry seal on it. Maybe they’ve found me?
I stare blankly into the corridor, tuning everything out until I’m draped in silence, like a cape. I’m slowly drowning, burying myself deep into the heavy folds of all my hidden insecurities and doubts. My mind reels under the water-like pressure, and I feel my lungs wanting to burst. My body willing my mind to give out. But my brain doesn’t succumb. I rip myself out of the illusion. Just enough to break the spiral down, and start floating to the surface again. No one else understands what I’m thinking or feeling, I hide my emotions too well. Too easily. Pansy was the one person I might’ve trusted after last year, yet I can’t help but to push her away. Can’t help but to seclude myself, and be wary of everyone, and everything, around me. Pansy hasn’t done anything wrong to me, but that doesn’t stop me feeling a strong sting of betrayal. I feel myself starting to go under again, and forcefully pull myself to the surface. The room around me feels like it’s going to explode with my pent up emotion and tension. I glance at Pansy sitting opposite me, at her peaceful face with her head resting softly against the window.
*~*~*~
“Ten points to Gryffindor!!” Roars over the loudspeaker, and the crowd goes wild. I sigh to myself, floating silently by the outskirts. The game continues through a wall of silence I decide is much needed. How can I concentrate with all that noise? I glance across the pitch and see Potter staring at a spot near my head. I narrow my eyes and search around myself. There isn’t anything though, and I look back at him. My gut twists and turns as he shrugs, before turning away and flying towards one of his Chasers.
The man’s eyes widen, and Draco realises he’s probably paying too much attention to the conversation and not enough to the bracelets before him.
Thankfully, when he looks around and wanders to the back of the store, he finds a rather large cosmetics and bathing section. Draco relaxes slightly as he walks through the aisle, taking in the colours and bright smiles of the models. One thing Draco has never understood about Muggles, is the way they cling to unrealistic beauty standards. No one’s teeth are
“I don’t think so, Malfoy. You’re absolutely freezing, and I’m the only thing that will be able to warm you up.”
“How are you feeling?”
“That was brilliant, Draco!” Hermione smiles, nudging Ron as she passes and murmuring something that sounds like ‘be nice, your eyes can be healed’.
“Correct,” Potter agrees beside me. When did he get so close? “It is designed to lure people in, and if you say something clearly Wizarding you are taken back here.”
Draco stands too, hands balling into fists. “Don’t you dare run away!” He shouts at Harry’s retreating back.
Harry shakes his head, hiding his laugh. “You’re also warm now, and there are things I want to do today.”
“Knees up,” he commands, voice firm and steady even though he feels like jelly inside.
“Of course not,” Potter says. “Way too bloody cold.”
It’s a good question. Once she found out what I was, she had been confused. For a start, being an angel is very rare. But even more so, being a
let alone strategise. I’m not sure what Weasley does, but Harry is clearly the field guy.
There’s a smile on Potter’s face as he stands, and Draco wonders what he’s thinking about; if it has anything to do with him. The expression reaches up to his eyes, and Draco feels like sinking into them.
Half an hour later, I’m directed towards ‘Mr Gresham’s room. He is sitting up in bed, filling out his own paperwork by the time I arrive. How I managed to fill it all out is beyond me, considering there wasn’t much thought given to Thomas Anstey’s background. How Harry is going to manage is an even bigger mystery, given how he isn’t good at making up information quickly. Scanning my eyes around the room, k smile when I realise Harry’s Healers aren’t in right now.
*~*~*~
“I thought I’d told you that I’ve already looked. Why are you exploding walls?” Malfoy asks exasperatedly.
Potter scrubs the back of his neck. “You have the right to say no, I’m meant to be your carer while you’re injured.”
Feeling oddly melancholic and shoving his hands into his coat’s pockets, he keeps his head down and walks on. It’s not like he is incapable of entering a forest. He would just rather he didn’t. He’d also like the memories to stay back, but they don’t really. Draco has sought help from many Mind Healers for this exact issue; they all told Draco that he just needed more exposure to forests, and that he needed to come to terms with his past mistakes. That may help in the long run, but Draco has never found it particularly comforting. Despite going to multiple Mind Healers, he doesn’t feel much better about the War. About his past and his many mistakes. Sometimes, it feels like he’s going to crumble under their weight. Other times he’s absolutely fine.
Without answering, Harry runs off to the nearest tree and ducks behind it. Draco can feel his magic spread out over the courtyard, encompassing all the people but making a careful circle around Draco. A very strong Notice-Me-Not is cast, and the Muggles all begin trickling out of the courtyard. Harry comes round the tree again and grins at Draco, waiting for everyone to leave before approaching.
“I’ll see you before we leave,” I promise him. Harry nods, all business now.
His hair is dusted with snowflakes, the white snow crystals shining on top of his pale blond head. He looks like an angel, poised and graceful and gorgeous. If Harry wasn’t already in love with the man, he would fall for him right now. Draco is so pretty, eyes sparkling as the sun peeks out above the trees.
Malfoy chuckles. “You didn’t. But to be fair, I made you spill coffee and ruin your book again.”
,” he murmurs, his wand tip lighting up in a soft blue glow. He holds it out in front of him, tilting it to reach inside the Cabinet without touching it. Harry is not running the risk of being teleported somewhere else, even if Malfoy did.
Harry can’t find the will to speak, unwilling to risk breaking the moment. Instead, he just nods. Malfoy takes that as an answer and leans down slightly. Without another second to spare, Malfoy presses their lips together in a kiss.
“We’re sitting in the atrium today boys,” Draco’s mother announces, leading them through the winding corridors.
“I don’t really have a choice, do I?” Draco sneers.
Harry bends low to avoid a branch, sidestepping a large root in the ground. His feet fly over the obstacles with no input from his mind. He jumps over a log and a gaping hole in the ground, landing on the other side. His foot slips and he falls, arms supporting his entire body weight as his legs hang in the hole.
“Oh stop it Malfoy,” Harry quips. He’s used to the false bravado the man opposite him normally puts on, and it no longer affects him. Well, not as much as it used to. Harry thinks.
Draco comes to his rescue. “I’m not
Harry bites back a groan of pain as his feet slowly awaken and leave sparse pin pricks over his skin. This is always the worst part, once they’re no longer numb and instead just sore. He grits his teeth, clenching them in a way Hermione would scowl at him for. Harry’s heart squeezes at the thought of his friend and the fact he hasn’t seen her for two weeks, and it’s enough of a distraction to get him moving.
“No, but I have a degree in potions. I can mix the ones we already have and make one that way.” Malfoy sounds incredibly smug, even if Harry can’t see his face.
A spell is used to numb my arm further than mine allowed, and an old spoon is shoved into my left hand. Before I get the chance to be confused, it activates and I’m whirled away from the Ministry.
Draco’s heart slows down, and he closes his eyes. When he opens them again, it’s to find himself in a ball on the sofa. He’s in the cottage with Harry, and none of what just happened was real.
Draco’s jaw drops. Directly in front of him
“Continue.” I pause, before adding, “Or, you know, don’t.” I can’t seem too keen.
Harry smiles. “I’ve also got a pretty good idea of which of our friends did what.”
He doesn’t know what to do now. Draco Malfoy is on his lap, sleeping, with his head pressed into Harry’s neck. He supposes there isn’t much he
“I understand that completely. But with me, you don’t have to worry about that.” My voice is cool and calm, comforting the boy. “Why don’t we do this. Ok. Here, I will teach you, and you need to actually try. And then in class you can slack off. Then, when it comes to exams you will still do well.”
Malfoy grins as he plugs in another marker and proceeds to sink the entire ship while Harry struggles to even locate one.
“Using me as a pillow, were you?” Harry teases gently as he kisses my forehead. I melt against him for a second. Then the alarms register once again with a loud chime.
“It’s weak at best,” I tell Potter. He groans before pushing me aside with his hand on my back and taking my spot next to her.
Harry
“Open it,” he whispers. Taking care to do so silently, I unscrunch his note. It reads;
“And now we begin crossing them out,” Harry announces, passing his wand to Draco.
“Is that what I think it is?” Harry asks, voice reverent and quietly excited.
Malfoy’s grinning at his book like a loon. It’s very distracting. Not that Harry’s really trying to do anything, mind you. He’s just sitting on the couch, staring into the flames of the fire and contemplating life. Well, that’s what he'd like to be doing, but instead all he can focus on is Malfoy. Malfoy, whose head is buried inside his book and is smiling at whatever he's reading. Harry’s never seen him so openly enjoying something; it's unsettling. And all that he can think about.
“Why a bath? I won’t be able to wash my hair properly.” He doesn’t bring up the charms that clean bath water out
Harry lost the second game, and the one after it too. He’d finally given up when Malfoy had won in under five minutes.
Tired of that line of thought for the week, he shifts into other ones. Malfoy crosses his mind, wondering where he’s gotten too. He can’t be far. Then again, he’s been gone for over a day. He could miles away by now. Harry groans to himself and pushes Malfoy from his mind. He starts to pay more attention to his surroundings. The forest is more sparse now, larger gaps between trees. It’s still quite crowded, but not to the same extent it was earlier. He’s in a new part of the forest, one he’s never been in before. Not that that’s saying too much, since he’s been steadily trying to ignore it for most of the week. He forces himself to actually look; to actually take it in and try to piece things together. He’s an Auror after all. He should be able to glean
Draco harrumphs loudly, knowing it’s true, before turning on his heel to leave the dance floor. When he looks back, Potter is staring at him and shrugging before turning to dance with someone else.
“Very elegant.”
Harry shrugs, lips curving into a smile against his skin. “No idea.”
[Two red cups of wassail/Christmas punch with dried orange and cinnamon sticks]
Potter exhales deeply, and Draco realises he had stopped breathing. Interesting…
“How is your back?” He asks, trying to find solace in the small talk. The small talk I would rather die than engage in.
“Absolutely,” I nod in agreement.
but for the time something was written. It had come back just before sunrise. Malfoy had been out for over twenty four hours by now.
Harry gives a tiny laugh at that and stands up, pulling Draco to his feet. “Come on. Let’s go look at some more lights.”
Draco’s heart squeezes at the reminder of their hesitant friendship, and how it’s clearly not going to work out after all. He tilts his chin up, looking down his nose at Harry. Potter. Whatever. “My mistake.”
“How old do you think it is? I wouldn’t have said too much.”
Potter throws a smug smile over his shoulder. “Indian.”
~~~~~~~~
“So… what are you reading?” Potter, seemingly wide awake again, reaches for the book.
.” Draco’s voice falls into a murmur. He hates that the papers and gossip columns have kept his old allegiance so close to the surface of wizarding society, not even bothering to add an ‘ex’ in front of it.
Harry shakes his head. “I want to see its
“Gonna- cum,” he moans. His legs begin shaking, and he realises just how far gone he is. He squeezes his eyes shut to lock in the sensations, hoping to remember this for a while.
“How are you feeling? Any pain?”
He has the sense to look a little sheepish.
Potter and I have now stood up from the table we were sitting at, and have been pacing around the room for a couple of minutes. I’m following Potter as he paces around the room, pointing at where things should go, and writing everything he says down. I occasionally interrupt him, because “no Potter, the music should not be played from a jukebox hovering above everyone’s heads” and “Potter, putting a floating stream of pumpkins right in front of the entrance is not a good idea”. Every interruption I make, he scowls at me like I’m questioning Merlin himself.
*~*~*~
“Yeah, it is kind of odd,” Malfoy says, voice scratchy from crying not even ten minutes earlier. Of course, if Harry were to tell him that he’d only get a glare and denial in return.
“And that’s worth moving an entire village and all its people?”
Sun streams through a window and hits my face. The warm rays heat my face up to a lovely temperature for this time of year, and I moan happily. I reach for the covers to pull them up, and my eyes fling open. There aren’t any. Where am I? Startled and confused, I scan my eyes around the room without moving and trying to keep my breathing regular. I see off-white, more like cream, coloured walls and maple wood floorboards. I’m in a room. That’s a start. From where I’m lying I can see little furniture, suggesting that whoever’s room I’m in isn’t here very often. I
“We don’t have any fever potions?” Harry calls, suddenly unsure of that fact.
“I don’t think so, Potter.” Draco throws his arms up as Potter moves even closer. His hands hit Potter’s wrists just before Potter’s hands would’ve touched his cheek. He blushes furiously but swallows it down as he throws Potter’s hands away from him. “I am not talking about that.”
“Bedroom!” Draco’s voice is hoarse, and his head spins.
“What about you?” Hermione rebounds my earlier question, drawing me from my thoughts.
Focusing on the task at hand, he continues around the cottage. At first, he just pokes the walls and joints with the tip of his wand, looking for any sign of weakness. When he hasn’t found anything or accomplished something greater than looking like an utter idiot, he goes back around. This time though, he casts various spells on each and every wall. These spells should detect any differences in building material, any spell work, or any tampering after the original build. Draco walks around, jumping to reach where the plaster meets the ceiling, and crawling along the ground. He thinks it’s stupid, and as he keeps going and things keep coming back negative, he finds it increasingly frustrating. So it's unsurprising when nothing shows up. No clouds of coloured steam, no annoying (but telling) dings; no nothing.
“Perfectly great, ‘Mione,” he says.
Draco groans, hands flying up to cover his eyes.
She hums as she pops a pink one into her mouth. “Fairy floss,” she says, a real smile pulling at her lips. “Take one.”
Potter passes me a couple of vials. I recognise some of them; Blood-replenishing potion and a Wiggenweld potion, but others I don’t.
“Obviously,” Potter drawls.
Harry’s suggestion probably has some truth in it, and Draco nods, trying not to feel bitter at how quickly Harry’s picking this up. He cancels the spell, letting the magic drop off into puffs of steam.
He shakes his head, clutching at his side. “Of course you do. Mr Draco Malfoy, serious Unspeakable.”
“Nope. Not a word of protest.” He walks over to the counter at the back of the room where Parsons is collecting an array of different coloured bottles. “How much?” He gestures to all of them.
Draco shakes his head, feet locking over the back of Harry’s knees. “I want you inside me, Harry. I want you to split me open and make me
“You okay?” Harry asks, hand on Draco’s shoulder and his face close.
Harry’s chest does that weird tightening thing again, but he doesn’t acknowledge it. “A sweater Ron gave me.”
“Of course I don’t!” I snap as I whirl around. That seems to have got her attention. “I don’t know anything! Because he never
“Yeah, just a splinter.”
know however, that nothing between you two is ever simple.”
“Blackout Angel…” Harry breathes, voice quiet regardless of the silent room.
“Good morning,” Harry murmurs, licking up his throat back to his mouth.
Malfoy doesn’t say anything, staring into space and thinking. “If what you say is true, how far does this plan go? Were we brought here deliberately? Was everything planned from the moment the Vanishing Cabinet came into the Aurors’ possession?”
I’m at a loss, my heart hammering in fear. All at once, the spells spin towards me, colliding in a mini explosion around me. I stumble backwards blindly, my hand clutching at my head. I hit something solid and fall to the ground. I register the cold ground beneath me before the world fades to black.
“About this,” Harry gestures vaguely. “Our situation.”
Draco agrees, taking a slice of apple, and Harry picks up his book again. There’s no use worrying about it now, it’s too early to go outside and the ground is still mushy from overnight rain. Something still tugs at Harry though, and he can’t seem to dislodge the idea that he’s forgetting something.
It hits him like a train. Potter. The insufferable git had removed Draco’s shoes—as he’s now noticed them stacked neatly at the end of the sofa, and he definitely didn’t take them off himself—and conjured him a blanket and a pillow. The pillow smells like Potter. Maybe he didn’t conjure it for Draco, but instead just gave him the one he’s been using this entire time. Scrunching his nose up at the thought of sleeping with Potter’s pillow, he finds himself suddenly wide awake and restless. No getting back to sleep now. Sighing, he throws the blanket off and stands up, tucking his wand beneath a cushion for safe keeping. He stretches his back out, simultaneously delighting and cringing at the cracks, and pads out of the living room down the corridor. He needs a showe— Shit. All of his clothes are in the bedroom. The bedroom which Potter is currently sleeping in. Fuck everything. Cursing the gods for the very first time this morning, he tiptoes towards the far door at the end of the hallway.
“Come on, let’s get some coffee.” Draco doesn’t wait for a response, immediately pouring the boiling water into the two mugs and stirring their coffee. When he adds the milk, he swirls it so a spiral forms in the foam. Harry smiles in thanks and amusement as Draco passes him his, even though he rarely drinks coffee; he think he’ll make an exception.
“Harry?” I ask, coming to a rather absurd conclusion about exactly
Harry’s chest tightens, his mind getting lost as an image of that flickers across his vision. “Yes.”
Draco freezes on the sofa, sitting up straight as if slapped. “What is?” He asks cautiously.
It sounds like he’s some sort of friend, not my enemy from since we were eleven years old. I contemplate his confession, and realise that I feel the same. I have always noticed random things about Potter that others miss. I don’t know what I would do if I couldn’t torment him, make his life miserable. He’s been such a big part of my childhood, making his life miserable was my favourite hobby. And despite everything, he saved me.
“Harry, you need to calm down,” Draco murmurs in his ear. His breath is warm against his skin, pulling goosebumps to his arms and neck.
“Why not?!” I yell, indignant.
He forces himself to stop. He doesn’t want to start his day like this, not when Harry is one single corridor away. Not when he could so easily walk down the hallway and wake him up with his embrace. Draco smiles to himself and gets out of bed, the blankets falling easily from his hips. He feels delirious, like his mind has gone off the rails. He feels sappy, like a character in one of his books. He doesn’t like it, he likes being in control. That’s one of the reasons he became an Unspeakable; it was something that used his brain and not the creative part that he indulges in for fun.
“It’s okay, Potter. I don’t care anymore.” In all honesty, Draco never really cared. This scar wasn’t caused from his own stupidity, it was just another mark of life. Unlike the black image on his forearm.
“Of course!” Draco smiles at Jenkins in false gratitude. “If I could be briefed now…?”
“You fell asleep last night.”
“Harry, you’ll need to speak up.” Hermione taps her pen impatiently against her notepad.
Harry looks like he could break down at that thought, spoken so plainly, and I wrap my arm around his waist.
“Glamour,” I confess.
“I think it’s just a casual lunch, Draco.”
Draco chuckles darkly. “I’m gay, Potter. You
Harry groans, mumbling to himself about his misfortune. He had gone looking for
“Draco, love, if I didn’t want you I wouldn’t have dated you. I wouldn’t have kissed you, or proposed to you. I definitely wouldn’t have stood before everyone I know and sworn the rest of my life to yours. Draco, I love you. I may deserve the best, as you so often say, but
was considered too bad. Legilimency, the Cruciatus Curse, breaking bones, threatening to bleed me out. I could be here all day,” I explain, the last bit bitter. Extremely so. “I was occasionally permitted leave. I usually took my broom and flew somewhere far away.”
The Common Room is dark, quiet, and empty. I’m the only one in sight, and I’m shocked with the sense of nothingness. For a second, I think I’m back in the Slytherin Commons, surrounded by unresponsive stone and cold water. But I know I’m not, and slowly but surely the purple, blue, and light wood comes into focus once more. I physically shake my head, a habit I’ve picked up from Potter, and shakily stand. Scanning the room, I release that I’m not actually alone, and that there are three people sitting in front of an empty fireplace. Two of them are leaning on each other sleeping, and the other one is reading peacefully. As I approach the staircase, the person who was reading catches sight of me. They place their book down on a table gently, and step over their friends to come over to me. Their bob of dark hair and pale skin reveals them to be a girl. As she paces closer, I recognise her in the dark. It’s Pansy.
“Yeah? What’s wrong with that?”
Malfoy pauses. “And?”
been to the beach it has been years since his last trip. And Draco. Draco has never been anywhere near the coast. Harry knew that beneath his calm exterior, he was silently quite scared. The waves were loud, the sand an unfamiliar texture beneath him, and the glaring sun was so bright and harsh. Harry had to feel a little bit sorry for his boyfriend.
?” He winks as he says Draco’s given name, knowing that the only other time he’s ever used it was last night.
Harry shakes his head in amusement, moving to sit down too. “Its freezing, and I couldn’t warm up.”
It’s the beginning of Defence Against the Dark Arts, and Professor Falco has given us some time to work on our assignments. Each pair has a dedicated table in the room, and some space to practise if need be. I sweep my eyes over the other pairs in the room, and notice that they are all working happily. Potter and I, are not. Well, I’m not. Potter is trying to find any more information on the Curse of the Bogies, and I’m meant to be practising the actual curse. However, while I’m standing and waiting in line for some room to cast, my gaze keeps finding Potter. His head is bent over the textbook, and his fingers drum impatiently on the desk. Whenever he turns the page, he licks his index finger, and of course my eyes keep falling on that. I hate myself for it, and force my sight to the line in front of me.
“Like the massage, huh?”
Harry cheers and races back inside, grabbing a coat. Draco rolls his eyes at him, tells him to wait while he puts his things away, and floats the paints into the cottage. The brushes and palette clean automatically, the water evaporating from the glass. His paintings turn around so Harry can’t see them, and they float down the corridor into the bedroom.
,” Harry says, and then he’s crying out too. He curls into Draco, dragging him into a fierce kiss even as his arms shake and he collapses on top of him.
Harry nods avidly at him. “That’s all anyone can do.” He moves his hand to cup Draco’s cheek, his thumb rubbing against his cheekbone and drawing electricity to Draco’s skin. “You choose, every day, to try to be good. That takes a lot of bravery, Draco.”
He stands up properly, cracking his back and—oddly—his knees. Potter grunts something at him again but Draco ignores it, not bothered to try to decipher it.
. Shaking my head and working for my heart to unclench, I prowl around the room. My footsteps are silent in the dark room, and I decide that I need to try one of the new challenges.
Harry nods. “If you’re coming to the Burrow, I’ll go to the Manor. Fair’s fair.”
A knock from the inside of the cottage startles Draco, and he drops the pencil. Harry’s head pokes through the door, and Draco moves so his body is blocking the canvas. The last thing he needs is Harry getting a sneak peek.
“I’m in the bed tonight,” Harry declares with his mouth full of bread and cheese.
had a good plan?
I nod at her and sigh. “I’m just tired.”
Opening my mouth to protest, Harry shakes his head. “Draco, no. If it’s a trap, it’s me they want. You are safest here. Besides, I have training.”
They’re all beautiful. None of them have pendants like the dragon he’d asked for, but some of the braided bands have silver strips threaded into the middle. When he looks at the price on one of them, he’s glad he wasn’t actually asking about them. They are not worth anywhere near the £300 price mark.
Their server is a middle aged woman with greying blond hair, tucked into a bun. She looks at them expectantly, notepad and pen ready to take down their order.
“You okay?” Potter asks, concern obvious in his voice.
I shush him immediately, nodding my head. “Mother’s door is ajar…”
“Ensure this match is quick and clean. Any serious injuries and the Captains, or someone else, are allowed to call a TimeOut. Otherwise, you play on.” Madam Hooch glances at all of us, daring us to say otherwise. She blows her whistle again, the balls are released, and the game commences.
than that. That’s
red though, spirals of it curving around the azaleas. He’d originally tried out silver and purple stars, but those hadn’t stuck as well. They were almost
Everyone in the family gets one, so it’s Mrs Weasley’s way of reassuring Harry that he’s a part of the family. Draco’s heart clenches at how nice that is.
Nothing had ever been explicitly stated, but with the benefit of hindsight, it looks to Harry that Draco might have had a bit of a thing for him when they were 18. Draco had been rather… touchy-feely. Especially at the end, right before they graduated in June. Harry’s heart squeezes, his stomach fluttering. He stamps it down. That was nearly two decades ago, there’s no way anything remains from the crush Draco clearly had. It’s impossible for him to still feel that way, to feel the same way that Harry—albeit reluctantly—does. Maybe he wouldn’t be so reluctant to admit it if he knew Draco had liked him once upon a time.
Potter trudges through various streets, all of which are quiet and seemingly unused by the public. When we accidentally come across a well lit, busy street, a chill races within me. The man next to me groans and grabs my hand. Before I have time to complain he leans in close to me, mouth to my ear. “We have to pretend Malfoy.” I open my mouth to ask what exactly he means by that, when it hits me. We are teenagers in Muggle London, at midnight, wearing robes. Potter is holding my hand tightly, gripping me to him. Here, we are together. Questions won’t be asked and we will be able to slip between people relatively unnoticed. Boyfriends. It’s a brilliant idea, but I don’t quite fancy it.
“Let’s draw it up. If we see it in front of us we might be able to make the connections we need to.”
“So, Malfoy,” the Potions Professor starts, “I’ve asked you here to talk about your class work, and a favour I would like you to help me with.” My face sinks in surprise and he must’ve seen because he quickly stammers out, “All good things, of course.” I release a breath I didn’t know I was holding in, and take a seat opposite him on the obnoxiously pale orange ottoman.
Draco nods his thanks and leaves the shop.
“The one concerning your father and Voldemort.” Granger looks amused at our exchange, but I recoil when she says the Dark Lord’s name.
“Nothing, will go wrong,” I assure him. “We both agreed that they were probably long gone by now.”
It’s hideous. Worse than how the tree started. It’s wonky, uneven, and not remotely attractive or pretty. It looks like a toddler did it. Harry sighs, supposing that’s true considering the lack of effort he normally puts into this. Usually Teddy does it, if he’s honest. He cares more about it being representative of family than drop dead gorgeous, but that isn’t possible right now. No,
“This Cabinet though, has lost all traces of magic. There isn’t anything to loop back together. I need to find a way to call the magic back, which can sometimes be done with the help of certain items chosen by whoever destroyed the magic.”
“I’m sorry, I don’t follow. You were cold… so you thought you could fix that by
The sound of conversation drifts throughout the Great Hall, voices and random words appearing in other people’s chatter. Most of it is pointless banter about the next Appleby Arrows vs Wimbourne Wasps Quidditch match, and everyone arguing over which team is going to win this time. I overhear a couple of students babble about relationships and family back home, and I try to ignore the hollow feeling and tune them out. True to my word, I’m sitting next to Pansy at the Slytherin table, buttering a piece of toast. She looks quite happy to see me, and is talking nonsense while daintily eating fruit. She starts off by mentioning her studies, since she knows I’m paying quite a lot of attention to my own this year. Eventually, our conversation shifts into more interesting things, like what her new friends have been doing and who they are seeing. I feel my face blush pink as Pansy informs me that she has recently developed a crush on a Ravenclaw boy. Her bob of dark hair moves around as she speaks, a sign that she finds the conversation interesting. I wish I could share that opinion. All her talk about this guy is wearing me out, and I think she notices.
She nods again, pen moving quickly across yellow pages. Draco’s mind flashes back to the day he left, when he wrote a note for Harry on similar paper. He swallows, forcing himself to look away.
It’s Harry’s turn to sigh. “I guess I could pull some strings at the Ministry…”
He’d left Potter a note this morning. Short and simple, telling the Saviour of the Wizarding World that Draco would be out all day exploring. Since Potter was still asleep when he left, he thought it would be courteous to give him some explanation as to the empty cottage. The note merely said ‘Potter, I’m going out to explore the surroundings. DM.” Three lines of swooping ink on a weird, squared, yellow page of thin paper. Draco thinks it’s Muggle—hell, it has to be, no wizard would write on something so small—but he hasn’t actually come across them before in the three years of living with Muggles. The fact that he rarely talks with the Muggles probably doesn’t help. There isn’t much time to write notes when he’s taking a stranger home.
“That was stupid, I’m sorry, you don’t—”
“Follow me,” he commands. His hand finds my elbow and he drags me away from the public Apparition point and down the cobbled street. I yank my arm back, but he clutched onto it again, his fingers wrapped around my wrist.
Harry moans, lips attacking his again. Draco groans into the kiss, his tongue sliding over Harry’s.
Harry nods, drinking from his glass. “I think I can manage that.”
One more group would have created the cottage, a group of people exceptionally strong yet creative too. Harry thinks it might be Neville, Sam, and Zabini. Sam would have to be really strong and knowledgeable about magic to be an Unspeakable—especially as Malfoy’s partner, who must be one of the best in England. Neville is surprisingly talented too, once he bought his own wand instead of using his father’s. Harry isn’t sure about Zabini, but Draco says he’s been working out and focusing on his physical strength a lot, which would come in handy when creating a building out of nothing.
“Thank you,” someone says over the noise. It rings out, and shuts off. I turn to look at the voice, and see that it belongs to Kingsley Shacklebolt. “Now that we appear to be protected, it’s time to leave. Your Portkeys will begin to activate within the next two minutes. There are no spares. Make sure everyone is holding on tight, we don’t know what we will see when we get there.”
“Good luck,” I say, praying that my voice doesn’t give away how scared I am for his safety. It trembles slightly, but beyond that it’s fine.
to be touched.
“Draco?” Harry whispers into my ear, afraid I’ll break. I think I might.
“Oh don’t look like that. You can’t tell me you’ve never slept with a stranger.”
The outburst makes someone else lunge at her, only stopped by others pulling them back. When the second person speaks, they’re revealed to be male. “I think you’ll find if you look a bit closer, that he actually has a
leave the cottage a mess so Potter had to clean it. It was highly satisfactory listening to him grumble and pick everything up. Draco doesn’t even remember what he did to trash it, just that the outcome was as he wanted.
“You have the beginnings of a fever, this will help.”
“I’m-” he starts. Harry can see his Adam’s apple bob as he swallows. “I won’t be able to-”
Harry heaves a sigh and sits up, swinging his feet onto the warm floor. The sun is beaming through the windows and casting golden light into the living room. Draco is reading over the reports Harry wrote up last night, and Harry is trying to do anything other than watch him. He’s still uncomfortable with where they left things off yesterday, awkward with how exposed he is now. Draco knows how he feels, has to have read between the lines and pulled out the obvious answer. It doesn’t help him
Harry sighs, feeling the tension leave his body. He cancels the spells and begins running again, slowly speeding up until he’s practically sprinting. Stamina be damned, he needs to beat Draco there. He can’t believe Draco did that.

“Of course, Caretaker Filch,” Harry nods. “Just one thing,” he says cautiously. “Where’s my partner?”
enters.
“Shh. You’ll see.” His voice is gruff and scarred. The perfect image of the two of us, really.
“I don’t know what I’m doing Draco…” Harry confessed. Draco had lifted Harry’s face and wiped a tear that was sliding down his cheek away. He can’t stand seeing Harry cry. “I feel- empty,” he had said.
This room is unusual, to say the least. Most of the rooms in the department have black-glass bricks, with fake windows and zero decoration. They have only what is absolutely necessary, as anything else runs the risk of ‘getting in the way’ and is therefore meaningless. This one, though, couldn’t be more different. Instead of the standard glass walls, it has wooden panelling running horizontally along the walls. They are pale and quite pretty, as far as average wood goes, and bring a feeling of life to the room. The floors are a plush silver carpet, Draco’s feet sinking into it slightly with every step. The walls are lined with huge windows, and even though they have to be fake—they
Harry makes a sound like protest, but then his stomach rumbles so loudly Draco can hear it from around the Cabinet. “I guess food wouldn’t be so bad…”
That, on the other hand, catches his attention. “And you didn’t push me away? Why the fuck didn’t you shove me off?!” His voice raises, tone becoming harsh. He knows it’s unfair, that there’s probably something deeper here, but he doesn’t want to think about it.
“Let me send this to Hermione, she’ll be ecstatic!” Harry says as he finally pulls away. I allow myself to flop down onto the leather sofa as I wait. The chime of the floo fills in the quiet, and then Hermione’s speaking too. Harry sends through the page and she exclaims something I don’t catch before calling for Ron. They speak for a while as I slowly drift off on the sofa. Mentions of battle plans needing to change creep into my awareness, but I push them away. I don’t really want to hear how I’m going to be utilised in a war right before falling asleep. I close my eyes firmly and determinedly block the chatter out. Harry’s hand on my shoulder rouses me a little later, and he’s flushed with the heat of the fire and the conversation.
Malfoy scowls. “Gee, thanks for your generosity.”
you get laid, Draco.” Blaise winks, the smug smile making Harry shake his head.
“I know,” Draco murmurs, kissing him again. He closes his hand over the top of Harry’s, pressing them flat to his skin. It’s warm under Harry’s hand, alive. “But I’m okay.”
“Really?!” Draco snaps under his breath, not wanting to draw the attention of his colleagues. “It didn’t seem like you had anything much to say except for-” Potter’s hand claps over Draco’s mouth, stopping him from saying too much. It would be inappropriate if anyone discovered what they’d done, even though they aren’t technically partners, they are constantly working together. Draco doesn’t want to risk being replaced and getting stuck with the filing again.
*~*~*~
from pleasuring Draco.
Out of the corner of my eye I spot my mother’s name and face, and walk over to it. My hand lightly caresses the tapestry, and I feel a pang in my chest. Where is Mother? Potter said she was safe…
Harry silently slides the book closer to me and gives me some space to cast. “Got it?” He asks.
Harry shakes his head. “It was part of a plot Hermione had. He’s actually in the Forest of Dean.”
Malfoy takes a seat on one end of the couch, pushing aside Harry’s pillow. Harry forces himself to take a deep breath, picks up his paper from the coffee table before Malfoy can read anything off it, and sits as far away as he can while still being on the same couch.
“He is conscious!” I shout towards the crowd. Madam Pomfrey runs in at that moment and places him on a stretcher before taking him to the medics’ tent.
Memories of yesterday rush over him, images of Harry kissing him. Of mistletoe growing over their heads and a laugh bubbling from his lips. His lips that were just on Harry’s. He’d felt alive with it, like a bolt of electricity had coursed its way through his body. Draco had never felt anything like it before. Had never felt so caught up in something. Harry had felt like a live wire, like something untameable. It had been glorious, and Draco had never wanted it to stop.
Harry sighs. “I don’t know. There’s something bothering me, but I can’t work out what it is.”
“It’s… kind of bent? Or is it meant to be like that?” Harry asks, his knowledge of anything remotely Unspeakable-ish tiny.
I don’t reply, just shake my head and move his hand off me. “It’s not important.” I know I sound dismissive, but he can’t know. “Where’s the chicken?”
“What? No!” A blush rises to his cheeks. “I just thought we could talk. Oh, and to give you this.” He pulls a bag from behind his back and passes it me. Inside it are some folds of fabric.
He’s slipped it into a crack in the bookshelf, hiding it between some books Draco isn’t going to go anywhere near. He’s quite happy with it, and can only hope that Draco will like it too come Thursday. Even if they don’t make it out of here, Harry is going to try his best to enjoy Christmas.
“Maybe we should try something on the suit of armour?” My idea is good, but I doubt it will work. Potter rains spells down on the armour, and as expected nothing happens.
“You’d fuck it up.”
“What were you painting?” Harry mindlessly asks after about an hour of quiet.
“Something to drink?” She asks, voice cheery.
“What? Do you expect me to take the damn couch?!” Potter is now arguing from the other side of the door. “I don’t bloody think so!”
Harry’s coat rustles in what Draco can only assume is a shrug. “Maybe they just decided they didn’t like the view.”
Harry eyes the wooden box in his doorway with an equal mix of suspicion and anticipation. Not many people send him things that manage to get past his mail wards, so he immediately knows who’s sent it. Aside from Christmas and birthday presents, the only other time he gets anything is when the Weasley twins send him a new experiment. Fred and George use him as their prototype tester, and have ever since Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes outgrew just the two of them. Harry always looks forward to the deliveries, but this one is slightly different than the others.
Harry hums. “Are there any other villages nearby? Or is this the only one?”
“I can immediately see a problem, gents.”
“So much indignation,” he teases. “Yet before you knew it was me, you seemed more than happy to grind against my arse.”
Draco fights back a flush and steps away from Potter. He squares his shoulders and drops to his knees, crouching in front of the Cabinet. He hears a gasp behind him, and Draco realises that he forgot to check for any new wards. Cursing
Harry’s pace picks up, his feet moving as fast as his heart beat. Despite everything, the cottage is the safest place right now. Kind of ironic, really. He shakes the thought off and runs back in the direction he came from. He’s barely watching where he’s running, leaping over branches on the floor and ducking below ones in the air. He isn’t even sure if he’s heading in the right direction, but it’s worth the risk. He’ll take anything to be as far away as possible. As much distance between himself and those 11 people who could have been doing anything.
“A week ago after we bought your potions, I sent Cynthia a letter. We agreed that Salazar Slytherin would be our password so she’d know it was us.”
says from across the room. “Are you okay?”
“Move aside,” Potter instructs. Draco does as he’s told without a second thought, and then instantly angers at that fact. Regardless, Potter’s raised his wand and is performing a series of detection spells. One of them chimes while a second puffs out a cloud of green steam. Steam, not smoke. There’s no smell to it and it vanishes very quickly, whereas coloured smoke always hangs around for a while.
“Great,” Potter sighs. He casts some more fancy spells, and I watch, intrigued, as a net of blue settles over the room. It looks like a setting charm mixed with a pressure charm. The combination would make sure nothing within this room moves from its normal position, and pressure would be constantly applied to various surfaces of my room to prevent Father noticing my absence. It’s rather clever of Potter.
Potter’s breath gets caught in his throat and he jumps up in a rush. “Ten?!” He exclaims. “Why didn’t you wake me?!”
Draco feels it though, and pushes into it. “You have a little something that wants attention, Harry,” he breathes, shuffling even closer.
“That too,” Harry agrees with a smile.
“Malfoy. It’s been over a week.”
close to the fire. Harry can’t blame him. Happy to have finally discovered everything, he actually leaves this time, closing the bedroom door behind him.
“Really.” Potter sounds so sincere and distraught, that Draco gives in.
“It’s a tree?” Harry asks, not quite seeing the problem.
“Where are we going?” Not
“Good morning class. My name is Professor Falco, and I will be taking you for Defence Against the Dark Arts this year.” She looks at us down her crooked nose, observing our reactions to her. Seemingly pleased, she cracks a smile and starts the lesson.
“Well, yes, I guess.”
My hands find the edge of the sink and grip hard, my tendons showing in my wrists. Potter follows behind me, so close to my back it’s almost suffocating. Almost. I stare into my own eyes and feel like crying, my world crashing down on me for no reason at all. He stretches his arms out to touch my back, and his hands press in firmly. My eyes flutter closed and I sigh, enjoying his warm touch. He starts moving his hands up and down, comforting me in the only way he knows how. He remains silent, hands working their magic, and leans in closer to me. His head nestles next to mine resting on my shoulder, and I briefly think that he fits perfectly against me.
stuck in a book. That’s a rather unusual sight right now, really. “Honestly, did you even hear anything I said?” Hermione is asking him.
,” Draco groans, hips moving against Harry’s stomach.
sweater is the problem.
“Where?”
Potter stares longingly into my eyes, his own blazing with desire. His finger trails down my jaw, tracing the lines my bones create under my skin. He dips his finger down onto my neck, carving zigzags into it. I feel shivers travel down my spine, and I push into his touch. His hand is back under my chin, and he lifts my face up towards him. He leans in close to me, and his breath flutters against my cheeks. He is so close to me I can see each pore, each tiny freckle laid gently on his warm skin. I press into his hand further and our foreheads are ever-so-slightly touching each other. His emerald eyes bore into my steely ones, and I feel myself melt into his touch. He is the first one to break, and draws my lips up to his own. His kiss feels warm, soft, and careful. I kiss him back slowly, hesitant at first. Eventually, the kiss builds up, and suddenly it’s filled with passion, energy, and desire. His tongue pushes against my lips, and I part them happily. He enters my mouth, running his tongue along the teeth and gums. It solicits a moan from me, and I bring my tongue towards his. Rubbing mine over his, I push him back to his own mouth. Our tongues dance within our mouths, and it makes my head spin. I pull away for a second. My eyes linger on his lips, red, pink, and wet. He is gorgeous. Our heavy breaths fill the silent room, and he smiles at me. This time it’s me who breaks, and I pull him towards me again, loving the sensation of kissing Potter.
Draco doesn’t know how to act. He feels awkward, out of place. They’ve never done this before. Sure, they’ve slept together on the sofa, but that was with pretences of warmth still firmly up. This is just because they want to, because they want to be close. He gets dressed quickly, hands sluggish and eyes drooping. He’s exhausted, but his heart is also pounding in his chest with nerves.
“This will look so much better when it’s darker,” Draco murmurs.
“That’s marvellous, Mr Malfoy,” she beams. “I would like to do a check-over though.” I nod my permission, and she traces my outline with her wand. She looks thoughtful for a second, before smiling again. “Your stats look perfectly normal.”
By the time he tears his eyes away, the village is covered in daylight. Still there are no people. Draco hopes that the village just likes to sleep in—it is a Friday, after all—but the longer he stands there the more he fears for the worst. A village should be bustling by now, store owners preparing for a busy day of selling, and buyers getting up early to try to get better deals. Draco runs his hand through his hair, displacing it slightly. Sighing, he pivots and faces the red bricked building again. Only this time he can see it properly. His earlier observation of unused is technically correct, but it is a big understatement. The benches and hooks are covered in spiderwebs, and there is more dust and broken glass on the tables than Draco ever thought possible. Scowling to himself at the cobwebs, he moves away from the abandoned butcher.
“Answer my question,” Draco snarls, eyes flicking back down over Harry’s body and resting at his belt.
Suddenly, he needs to get this done. Needs it to be gorgeous, stunning, beautiful. Draco needs to like it, otherwise he’ll just undo it all and restart himself. Harry can’t have that.
“-nything suspicious within the gates. Everything is good on my side and I will go ahead to Phase 2.” Harry’s voice is controlled, all business. He’s clearly done something like this before, and I can’t help but think he’d make a great Auror. Unless, of course, he is sick of battling dark wizards. I completely understand the sentiment, even though I’ve never done anything of the sort. I don’t want to choose a career in anything similar to this war.
Draco looks taken aback, but nods. “Go on then.”
so that people can wash their hair.
“It’s your turn anyway,” Harry says, rolling his eyes. He can’t believe he’s stuck with this insufferable idiot. He thinks he might die from how happy he is.
Malfoy opens his mouth—probably for another rude retort—but closes it. He shakes his head slowly and turns his gaze down to the floor.
to warm up.
She takes that as an answer for right now, and begins pulling things out of her bag. A Muggle quill is thrown out, followed by weird parchment book
“You should also use this.” Potter passes me another bottle filled with what I think is Murtlap Essence. I don’t see how I’ll use this.
He feels Harry smile against the back of his neck. “Good. Now go back to sleep for a few more hours.”
“Just around your back then?”
Draco groans, not listening as he chases Harry’s mouth. When he doesn’t find it again, he opens his eyes. He blinks, surprised to see Harry looking at him.
“No,” he says, voice quiet.
“Hey! What do you think about this?” Harry asks, tapping Draco on the shoulder. He’s holding a reindeer ornament that looks like it’s made of ice. Harry holds it out to Draco so he takes it, feeling it.
Harry shakes his head. “They aren’t entitled to your time, no.” He sips his wine. “That being said, you shouldn’t spend Christmas alone if you don’t have to.”
After a minute’s contemplation, he comes to the conclusion that he won’t enter it. Or any more stores, for that matter. The last two he entered just made him feel off and sad, and he doesn’t really want to push his emotions in that direction. He does decide to keep looking though, because window shopping never hurt anyone. So as he continues down the concrete path, Harry plays a game with himself. He has to try to guess what the building is before he sees any definitive give away, like a sign.
“You know what’s both gay and homophobic?” Theodore is asking a little while later, between rounds. Harry thinks having to kiss Dean Thomas is pretty high on his list. Dean a) has a boyfriend (as of 15 minutes ago) and b) is as far away from Harry’s type as possible. He won’t say that though; he would hate to offend one of his roommates of eight years.
Once he’s rugged up in jeans, a long sleeve shirt, socks, and a thick coat, Harry makes his way into the kitchen. His hair drips down his back, but he has to let it air dry. The muggle method of drying hair leaves it frizzy and unruly. The wizard way isn’t much better. Looking around the small kitchen, he opens cupboards and doors randomly. He knows he wants breakfast, but the problem is always
Draco makes sure to keep his breathing deep and even, eyes closed. Harry’s lips touch his again, barely pressing down. He wants to moan into it, wants to wrap his arms around Harry and invite his tongue into his mouth. He can’t though, not if he wants to find out the answer to his question.
to be something else here!”
isn’t it your turn to patrol tonight?”
“What does that mean?” Potter’s calm voice cuts through the blurred reality, and Draco nearly jumps right onto the threshold again.
Malfoy grins. “Very! I can’t wait to go read them.”
“I mean,” he says, stepping closer, “why do you care about how I feel?”
The thoughts consume me as I glide down the stairs and out of the Common Room.
There must be something I can do. Harry wouldn’t have suggested it if he wasn’t certain I could find a way to do it. Throwing caution to the wind, I adjust the light so I can see a bit better. As everyone around the room starts to focus in on me, a memory strikes and an idea comes to mind. Smirking to myself and waving cheekily at the others, I turn my back on them and look over my shoulder. What Harry might have called a reflection, is in reality light being bent and stretched in a complete circle. This is easier to create than going invisible. In order to eliminate myself from view, I would have to bend light around myself and remove any naturally reflecting light. To mirror myself or anything else, I only have to hide myself and then amplify the reflected light.
“Okay okay! You sound like a girl, Jesus,” Potter cuts him off.
“Actually,” Potter interrupts. “I think you should hear this.”
. He wonders if it’ll bruise…
Harry takes a deep breath; the air smells like Draco and his expensive shampoo. He breathes in again, calming himself and settling in. Things move, and Harry feels Draco’s hands coming up across his hip. Harry stills, sure he’s going to be pushed away. When the hands continue up to his waist and are followed by arms, his heartbeat spikes rapidly. Draco’s hands are cold when they push Harry’s jumpers up, skin on bare skin. Harry swallows hard. Draco tightens his grip and pulls Harry closer, slotting their bodies together and releasing a sigh.
to touch,
An hour or so later, Draco swaps Theo’s canvas out for a new one. He wants to create something for Harry so he can remember everything once they manage to get back. Draco’s sure they won’t be here much longer, and he wants to make sure he gets this done. He picks up one of his pencils and starts sketching an outline, straight lines rising up the canvas.
“I was wondering…” he begins, trailing off and waiting for the boy’s nod. “What do you know about this village’s history?”
If Harry has an inkling—a very, very strong one—than there’s no doubt that Draco has also realised it. He is going to kill his non-friends the second he gets out of here. Christmas or not. Ron and Hermione especially, because they are probably the ones who posed the idea in the first place!
Harry sighs. “Thank you,” he says, pressing his nose against Draco’s.
There is an awkward pause, both of us suddenly realising how little we have to talk about. Opposite sides of the war, or at least, used to be. Enemies since we were eleven. Fights, problems, bullying, betrayal. Is there a single negative adjective you couldn’t use to describe our relationship.
“I find that hard to believe,” I drawl. “What’s through there?”
Deciding he might as well waste his day away, Draco flops onto the hard ground and winces. He still isn’t used to lying on something so solid and cold as the bare dirt. His arm burns where he cut it, and when he looks at it he sees it reopening. Red blood slowly bubbles to the surface, a colourful streak against his pale, dirt-stained skin. He sighs. There’s nothing he can do for it but run it under the tap again. Draco stands slowly, dusting himself off and straightening out his injured arm. He makes his way across the small hole to the tap and faucet, feet dragging and kicking up dust. He’s so tired, so exhausted. All he wants to do is sleep, but he can’t; not like this.
behind Harry. Harry turns, grabs the door handle, and flees.
Before I can say anything, he has his hand on her jaw with his thumb and index finger creating a tick. It looks like muggles’ depictions of philosophers thinking. He then easily opens her mouth and looks inside. Shaking his head, he reaches for his wand. The holly flies into his hand and he raises it to her open jaw. Then he utters something I don’t hear and flicks his wand. Eyes glued to her chest, I gasp as it rises immediately. Potter copies my position from earlier and smiles.
Harry thinks about it. Aside from the usual Christmas lunches and funny competitions with the Weasley’s and his friends, there’s isn’t much he’d miss. Except Teddy. “I guess… I’d be missing Teddy’s fifth Christmas.”
“No actually I didn’t,” Potter replies. “I thought that was quite odd, but someone else told me they’d witnessed it. I figured that since it was obviously coated in dark magic I’d bring it in anyway, and that if it really was responsible for removing hair and I’d just saved someone else’s head, it would be a bonus.” He shrugs at the end, like he didn’t honestly care that much about it.
“I’m gonna come Harry, oh my god!”
“The Vanishing Cabinet,” Harry murmurs.
“For good reason.” Draco juts his jaw forward.
The end of this chapter is all smut. Aside from that there is a bit of plot at the beginning.
Draco gets the message, hands tightening even further in his hair. He thrusts up once slowly, testing Harry’s boundaries. Then he sets a pace of his own, plunging into Harry’s mouth. It hits the back of Harry’s throat and he almost chokes, but he manages to suppress it. He relaxes his throat further, hollowing his cheeks so Draco can see the imprint.
With new determination—and the possibility of annoying Draco
Draco smiles. It’s thoughtful, even if he doesn’t quite believe it.
Hands rub at my back, probably trying to ease my pain—or help the bones come through. However, the impromptu massage does nothing to help, instead causing my agony to spike dramatically. I twist my back, trying to dislodge the persistent hands. They seem to get the idea, and rush to remove them. I open my eyes to blood everywhere. I could feel it dripping down my body, but now I can see it. Everything within a metre of me is stained red, and my skin will probably be permanently pink.
“Of course, thank you.” The Third Year retreats and exits the room, and I put my book down. Sighing in frustration, I set the class back to how I found it, returning all the equipment to the shelves. I was planning to be here for about two hours, and now I suddenly have lots of free time. I could always go meet Potter early… The thought is a good idea, but I don’t want to seem too excited to see him. So I instead leave the dungeons and traipse over to the library to return some of the unused books from today.
“Sorry Filch, I was-”
“Quite likely,” Harry admits, drinking his juice. “But probably only once or twice. As I said, it’s not my favourite.”
is who I am. It’s who I was born as, what I was
into the pillow beneath his head, turning to nose at it. Harry gasps and then slaps a hand over his mouth. He swallows dryly and begins to creep away. He makes it into the hallway before realising that he’d left his papers there. Cursing, he tiptoes back into the living room.
“You can,” Draco says, nodding when Harry turns to look at him in surprise. “Blaise is the same, so I made sure it was safe.”
“No, but thank you.” This scar isn’t created by stupid decisions, unlike the one on my other arm. It serves as a reminder of something I’m proud of, the time when I helped people instead of threatening them.
“Hey, Harry,” I murmur as I enter the room.
Draco scoffs and crosses his arms. Harry doesn’t miss the way his eyes linger on his hair. “What the hell were you
Theodore swears loudly, standing up and storming back to his spot next to Blaise.
Harry flinches, freezing just above Draco’s body. Draco brings his hands into Harry’s hair, just as he’d wanted to do, and arches his neck. Harry growls, clearly liking the way Draco has bared his throat to him like an offering. Draco had thought he would, with the way he was dragging his teeth along it. Harry sucks Draco’s neck, his tongue moving over the sensitive skin. Draco mewls as he finds a sensitive spot on the left side of his throat, fixating on that until he’s writhing.
“Are you not sore from yesterday?”
The force of a spell hitting the wards knocks me back to the ground. I land with a thud on top of Harry, who instantly pulls me down again. A streak of red explodes through the air, colliding with the shields over the property. They shouldn’t be able to see the house, so I have no idea how they’re aiming at it. Harry’s wards seem to be holding though. This house has survived a war with Voldemort already, surely it can do so again.
“Ahh…” Potter groans when he twists his wrist at the heads. He gasps again as Draco rocks upward, driven by pleasure instead of his brain. Draco mumbles in complaint when Potter pulls away for a second, but is stopped by a hand on his cheek. Potter’s eyes seem to say ‘I’m not going anywhere right now’ even as he turns away.
Draco is sitting in someone’s lap, warm thighs under his own and a chest against his. He doesn’t know who they belong to, just that they’re warm and comforting. He isn’t sure how he came to be in this position, a part of him recognising that it’s unusual. The rest of him doesn’t care.
“Malfoy?”
Harry turns into the living room to find Draco lying on the couch, his face pressed into the pillow and the blankets down at his waist. His shirt has ridden up over night, a sliver of his bare stomach exposed to the room, and Harry’s eyes stray to it.
“Yes,” Draco says, glancing back at Harry. “I was called in on my day off.”
Draco sighs and heaves himself up, taking his plate and mug back to the kitchen. There’s a pile of dishes and cutlery scattered over the benches and in the sink, and he figures there’s nothing better to do. He moves the plates and bowls out of the sink and turns the water on. The faucet groans before water spills out, and Draco waits for it to turn hot. Once done, he plugs the drain and pours some dishwashing liquid into the sink. He flicks his wand and sends the other dishes flying towards him, manipulating them to land carefully in the sink. The water splashes onto them and bubbles, soft foam rising on top.
As he walks, he begins to pick up the pleasant smell of chocolate in the air. Once he enters the living room he spots Potter lounging on the sofa with a novel, mug in hand. He looks up as Draco enters, a cheeky grin on his mouth.
He leaps up and starts pacing, his feet dragging behind him noisily and his hand gripping the wand in his pocket. He sends the cushions and his blanket back into order with a quick spell, straightening them out and making it look presentable. Harry may not be bothered to make his bed—or couch, in this case—but he isn’t so lazy as to not get his magic to do it for him. Unlike Ron. His heart clenches at the thought of his friend. It’s Thursday. He’d normally have seen him four times by now, each meeting at either the pub, or Hermione and Ron’s cozy little house. Harry sighs, running his hands through his hair. It sucks, being so far away from the people you care about and having no way of contacting them. Harry can only hope that they find a way out of this soon. If not Malfoy and him, then maybe Hermione might be able to help from the other side of this mess.
Draco’s stomach lurches as he picks up his speed, trying to follow Harry’s pace. Harry looks back at him, checking to see if he’s okay, before he’s running again. Draco groans, thinking not for the first time that he’s not as fit as he should be, and jogs on behind him.
“Fine,” he agrees. “That’s probably a good idea.”
“Are you dizzy? Have you eaten?” The concern in Potter’s voice is unnerving.
“Malfoy! I found something!”
Malfoy gestures for Harry to go on, and Harry begins explaining what he found while he was out yesterday. He watches as Malfoy’s mouth drops open, and rage takes over his features.
Harry realises he’s been staring at the canvas for way too long and tears his eyes away. When he turns to face the rest of the room he sees a pile of game boxes sitting near the bed. He doesn’t remember seeing them before, but decides not to question it. The cottage is always doing weird, unexplainable things.
“You’re on Malfoy.”
[Santa (from his chin to his thighs) placing gold and red wrapped presents under a tree]
Draco holds his breath as Harry takes in the request, his eyebrows rising up his forehead. He doesn’t know why he said that. There’s no way in hell Harry would willingly set foot in the Manor, would want to go with him to the place Granger was tortured, where Dobby was killed. Draco holds his hands up, shaking his head.
Draco makes his way to an office shop and walks up to the counter. He asks for directions, and the worker happily points him to aisle four. Draco walks to the indicated section and quickly finds the fountain pens. There are rows and rows of them, some plain, some intricate and beautiful. Harry would love so many of them, and Draco has no idea where to begin.
With Potter safely out of the room, Draco flops over onto his stomach and inhales a shuddering breath. His nightmares are hard to deal with, and he’s astounded he didn’t break down crying in front of Potter. His pride would have caved beneath him, he would have been on equal footing with Potter. He shivers, suddenly aware of how cold the December morning is. Biting back a sob, he rearranges himself and kicks the covers over him. He clutches at the duvet, pulling it as high up his body as possible.
Frosty grass crunches beneath Draco’s feet, wind whistling through his hair. The sun still hasn’t risen yet, but it shouldn’t have much longer to go. It’s nearly seven thirty, and the birds are starting to rustle in their trees, beginning to wake up. There’s probably another twenty minutes or so before dawn, and Draco intends to make the most out of the day. Really, he intends to find any more clues on where they are and how to get back. He’ll take any hint at all. Even if it requires traipsing through a dark forest looking for civilisation. Forests have never been his favourite place in the world, only made worse with the war. Whenever he finds himself near one he tries to go around. They make him uncomfortable; too many memories. Too many opportunities for him to have changed something, instead of cowering in the castle or behind a tree.
Harry smiles to himself, finishes his wine and stands up. Malfoy stands as well, and together they clear their plates and glasses away.
’,” I argue. And it’s true, I tell myself. The fact that we sit a bit too close to each other for friends, or that we use the disguise of being boyfriends whenever we’re out in public, aren’t important things. They can’t be, because Harry clearly doesn’t feel the way I do.
, it’s not like anyone has
“That’s… strange,” Malfoy mutters. “You wouldn’t expect them to be so thorough… It sounds very organised.” He pauses, thinking. “That’s a strange place for a meeting, isn’t it?”
“I’m so proud of you, Draco,” Mother confesses when she turns me back around to face her. Her eyes are shining, a smile firmly pressed onto her lips. She’s willingly letting me see her, letting me understand her emotions. I pull her into a crushing hug, uncaring of the fact that we haven’t ever done this before.
“Come on sleepy head,” Harry says while pulling me into a sitting position. “Let’s get you to bed.”
“I was wondering,” Harry starts, a repeat of the conversation back at the baker’s.
Malfoy anymore, but he definitely doesn’t like him. And just because he’s realised that, doesn’t make him think any higher of the blond man.
“What is that?” I ask, curious about the muggle contraption. Because it has to be muggle. Wizards would never create something so strange.
Voices clamour as we descend to the ground floor, people shouting to each other about trivial things to distract themselves. As we turn to the back door, I take in the masses of witches and wizards lounging around. Some talk with others nearby, some lay on the ground in pretence of sleep. All of them are tired, muscles aching and staring at Harry and I like we’re important. I guess we are; or we will be.
“Thought you’d never surface from your bed.” I look up and see Blaise smirking at me across the room from his bed.
Malfoy laughs at that. “That’s a great image.”
“Are you guys sure this will work?” Harry asks cautiously. Granger—
Harry swallows hard, trying desperately not to picture the people who lived here not even a decade ago. He was fifteen. He sighs, not wanting to think about what he was doing at fifteen. It feels like it happened to a different person, in a different lifetime. Yet the scar across his hand begs to differ. He pushes his thoughts away. He’s spent enough of his life thinking about everything, he wants to enjoy himself right now without the war plaguing him. It’s only as he’s setting off down the path and heading back towards the plaza that he notices it. Snow. It’s falling lightly right now, little puffs of it that look right out of a photograph. But as he’s looking up at the sky, the clouds look heavy. If he squints into the distance ahead of himself, he sees it falling heavily beyond the forest. Cursing under his breath, he casts multiple shields and warming charms, and starts running back into the forest.
“Fine.” He leaves it at that. There is a slight annoyance in his tone, but it can’t be directed at me as he starts massaging the Murtlap Essence into my back.
“What if I can’t?” Harry asks. “We haven’t exactly tried.”
“Of course,” Harry readily agrees. He tries not to blush as he turns and walks from the bedroom.
“How did they get so many?” I whisper to Harry.
Harry takes a deep breath, his chest pressing into Draco’s back further. “Why are you here?” He asks, suspicion rising in his tone. “And why did you wake me up?”
“Dozens…” Her voice is filled with fear. “Anyone recognisable?”
Draco pulls his wand out of his pocket, his holster nowhere to be found. Miss Stinton will kill him if he goes back without it, but it’s not his fault it’s lost! It’s probably Harry’s, if he’s being honest. The man can’t keep anything in order unless he’s being paid to.
The second map doesn’t show paths and trails, only pinpoints people’s location. Harry’s own point on the map is blue, standing out stark against the red magic creating a three dimensional map in the air. He scans it, eyes quickly falling to a purple point a little ways off. Harry feels relief drain into his body as he realises Draco must be alone. His eyes follow the point as it moves, travelling steadily towards the courtyard. The bastard has found a faster route, and is hoping he’ll make it there before Harry.
Thank you for all the support on the previous chapter. Sorry this one took so long to be released. Enjoy!
Harry leads me all the way to the front line, and if that isn’t fitting for our relationship as a whole, I don’t know what else could be. Harry pulled me from the back of a war I wasn’t remotely interested in, and lead me all the way to his side. To becoming powerful and strong; to war. I swallow the thought and allow him to guide me.
He decides to investigate the physical structure of the cottage. If there isn’t anything in the spell work, maybe there’s something blocking certain types of magic. It’s a stretch, Draco
“Not even your mother? What about your friends?” Harry’s heart sinks at the thought of him spending Christmas alone, feeling totally unwanted.
Draco’s thoughts take a turn for the worse. They stray to his mother, sitting at her home in the countryside, waiting for any news of Draco. What if she thinks he’s dead? Well, he’s going to be soon anyway. Even if he doesn’t starve thanks to the awful food, his body won’t be able to take the elements much longer. As an Unspeakable, he knows first hand how important shelter is. Without it, a person is doomed to the weather’s mercy. He’s about to find out how horrifying that fate is firsthand. Potter won’t come for him. He won’t rescue him. After all they’ve been through, they’ll die apart. One, in a well lit and warm cottage fit for the Saviour, the other in a dirt hole fit for a Death Eater.
Draco scowls at him, trying to get around him. He
has him.
Harry needs an Auror partner. They’re supposed to calm you down, help you see rationally. That’s why every Auror is assigned one. Except he is alone, no one but the trees witnessing this break down. He runs on, his chest starting to burn with the need for oxygen. At last the sky becomes visible, a break in the forest. It could just be another clearing, but it looks like the end. The end of the forest and an entrance into daylight. He pushes harder, ignoring the pain in his throat and legs. Water and air can wait for safety.

somehow undetected, the sparks rebound back into my wand.”
“No, it’s perfect so far.” She blushes once again. “We now need to grind our Scarab Beetles in a mortar and pestle.” She rushes over to the shelves and finds one. She paces back to me and I show her how to properly grind them into a paste. I guide her again, and then she keeps going until it’s just the right consistency. Telling her to add it to the potion, she stirs it until it becomes a beautiful red colour. She looks up at me and I nod, then tell her to remix the Armadillo Bile, Ginger Roots, and Armadillo Bile (again) until the potion is purple. She starts mixing in the Armadillo Bile again, and I allow myself to daydream. I think back to a couple nights ago, when Potter and I spent the night studying and sending weird looks back and forth. My stomach twists again and I groan silently. It’s becoming more insistent and more painful the longer I’m at school.
Harry turns to see a sleep crumpled Malfoy, looking very apologetic. He sighs, pulling the book out of the mess of spilt coffee. “Use your spell please.” He leaves out the ‘again’.
Now that Harry’s made sure Draco remembers their suspects, he starts with the new information.
“It’s meant to bleed for-”
He steps closer and runs his eyes over them. Some are shaped like quills, and while that is

Professor Parsons, as it turns out, is an elderly wizard who specialises in Magical Creatures and Their Transformations. He is essentially a replacement for the shit job the Ministry does and the rude people who serve said creatures. And now I’m one, standing in front of his beechwood, meticulous desk.
“To… defeating the Dark Lord.”
Harry freezes, unable to tear his eyes away from Malfoy. His hair is for once not slicked back, but purposely tousled, hanging down over his forehead. His Hogwarts robes have been swapped out for a mesh black shirt and sinfully tight jeans. Harry can see his nipples through the shirt, and the sight makes his mouth water.
He shakes his head, tipping it back in frustration and despair. “Did I waste all that time for
“Good morning students. It pleases me greatly to see you all eating and chatting, preparing for the first Quidditch Game of the year!” A cheer rises up as everyone thinks ahead to the game. McGonagall raises her hand for silence, and the students quieten down.
then opened the doors and looked through it, having to touch it to do so, he wouldn’t be thinking normally. What if Malfoy actually did find something? What if it was a crucial piece of evidence to them getting out of here? If it was Harry in that position, he would have run. He would have tried to race back to the cottage to find Malfoy and figure it all out. But he might not have anything correct right now. Malfoy could have just up and left. Harry hopes not.
That was the year with the traitor Black escaping from Azkaban. The year with the stupid hypogriff breaking my arm. The year Granger punched me, and Potter laughed at me. Thankfully, that didn’t happen very often. My thoughts start straying back to life at Hogwarts, before the world turned a new head. Before my family started to repeatedly fulfill “tasks” and “assignments”. Before I had to seclude myself from my friends, the rest of Slytherin, and before I had to push myself to the extremes of my magical capabilities.
Harry groans and sighs, but accepts his fate all the same. Forgetting all about his wand and his magic, he starts to shovel the snow away by hand. He very quickly loses the sensation in his hands; and his patience. Wondering why he even bothered, he pulls his wand out of his coat pocket and blasts the snow away. Maybe it was a bit dramatic, but Harry thinks it was worth it to see the snow explode and melt. Grumbling to himself about the trials of winter and unfair weather conditions, he opens the door and enters the cottage.
“Very.”
Harry zones out again, letting the game play around him. He briefly sees Blaise crawling into the circle, but he doesn’t know who the other player is. He glances around the room again.
That appears to be the only answer I get, and quite frankly, I don’t have the energy to ask for more.
it’s a stretch, but it’s a possibility. He’s seen it before. Once. In the very first year of his training. That’s not the point though. It’s possible. Draco begins by checking along each wall and seam. No matter how unlikely, someone might have stuffed a bit of material between the walls, or where they join with the ceiling and floor. He isn’t even sure what the material could be, just something that can be magically altered to absorb certain types of nearby magic. It’s complicated, and definitely not his area of expertise. If this was a case—a
, and that’s only when Hermione removes it from the rest of the paper for him.
Hermione doesn’t move, just looks at me with eyes filled with curiosity.
He reaches the forest without taking much in, and he curses himself for his tendency to get lost in his head. He can
Something irks him though. Purple and silver are a massive part of this problem, being all over the place. The Cabinet, bracelets, the cloaked wix in the forest, the cotton Malfoy found, and now the leather. Harry sighs to himself and stands. His back aches from sleeping on the couch again, and he regrets allowing Malfoy to take the bed so easily. He also woke up shivering with cold multiple times, and no amount of blankets seemed to ease it. Harry rubs at his eyes and decides to get some coffee. He’s not going to be able to function very well today without it, he thinks, despite it making his brain race uncomfortably. What a Malfoy thing.
Malfoy pushes Harry out of the way roughly, making it a point to shove his elbow against Harry’s. He stalks right up to the door, twists the handle, and then prods it open with his wand. Harry watches as the door resizes and becomes bigger, and follows Malfoy into the doorway. The room beyond reshapes, but in the dark it’s impossible to see what’s happening around them. Malfoy is the first to cast a Lumos, and Harry hurriedly follows suit. Groaning as the room comes into view, he sees that it’s only a tiny broom cupboard. Well, he thinks miserably, that explains why Malfoy’s standing so bloody close to him. Harry wants to childishly push the blond man away, but there isn’t anywhere to push him
Malfoy sighs, removes his hands from the covers. “I guess we can talk then,” he mumbles. “Outside though.”
Is the great Harry Potter asking Draco out? Does he mean this as a date? No, probably not. Draco’s probably just overthinking and projecting, which gives him pause. Does he
Draco takes a breath. He needs to calm down, needs to
Malfoy flushes, his pale skin turning steadily pink. “None of your business.”
“Awful,” I laugh. “It started with growing the skeleton out of my back. It didn’t just slide out like in folktales, but my skin was torn open. Very painful.” I end the description there. Mother never has been good with blood, which I thought was rather ironic considering she prided herself on her pure blood. Prided, not prides. There is nothing to be proud about if that same pride results in genocide. “After that the feathers started to grow. Each time the skeleton folded back inside my skin and then re-emerged. It never became any less painful,” I say. “Actually, my feathers only became this white yesterday,” I explain. “I’m still quite sore, but Harry healed me quite well.”
the best. You’re the only one who truly understands me, who knows what I’ve been through. We’re two sides of the same coin, and I don’t ever want you to doubt my love.”
Harry nods, not able to find the words to agree in his state. He rolls off Draco and pulls him towards him. His heated skin rests against Harry’s, and he twists in his arms so they’re facing each other.
Harry closes the door, finishes stripping, and steps into the shower, pushing aside thoughts of Malfoy as he soaps up.
“Oh yeah,” Goldstein coos.
Malfoy has been out more than in, really. Well, from Harry’s view at least. He’s also spent a lot of time in the bedroom. Except, when Harry slept in it everything was in order. There was no sign that someone else had been in there before, let alone spent so much time there. Well, unless you count that the sheets smelled like Malfoy, but Harry was quick to spell that away. So, if there is no sign of the Ferret in there, he must have hidden things. The thought latches itself onto Harry’s mind and sticks there. He can’t shake away the idea to snoop. It’s not his fault, not when Malfoy is the one out. With his mind set, he leaps off the couch and makes his way down the corridor.
“Mother,” I breathe out, relief flooding my thoughts. I step into the room, Harry’s hand finding a spot on my lower back. “How are you?” This is the first time I’ve spoken to her, with a chance she’ll actually respond, in weeks. Sure, talking to her unconscious body was communicating of a sort, but she couldn’t actually reply. It was more of a one-sided information dump than a conversation.
Harry just shrugs, smile pulling at his lips. “I don’t like it that much.”
Malfoy purses his lips. “I don’t know.”
It’s only 5:38 am.
Without much thought about the process, he runs. He sprints through the forest, working himself into a panic. Retracing steps and reenacting events can be very useful, so if he is correct, he needs to do the same. Running makes Harry’s heartbeat spike again, and his breath comes out in heavy puffs of cloud. His arms move beside his body, his feet moving without any consideration about where they land. He allows his body to just
Harry chuckles, shaking his head with a smile. “A really good one.”
“Battleships? Really, Potter?” Malfoy wipes his hand across his mouth and sucks some of the cream off it, completely unaware of the tightening in Harry’s chest at the action.
“With marshmallows?”
though.”
“Indeed, it is a sweet-smelling potion, meant to induce happiness. This potion is advanced, and therefore quite difficult. This isn’t normally taught at Hogwarts, but I believe that you will find it a very beneficial elixir,” he informs us, before instructing us to retrieve our ingredients and start preparing the potion.
“I told you Potter. You’ve clearly never played against anyone
out with a flourish of his wand and tucks it back into his sleeve; only to pull it back out again. Someone else could stumble across the village, and the last thing he wants is for them to go poking around in a potentially dangerous Vanishing Cabinet. With a flick of his wand, the doors close and the built-in lock clicks. Then he adds some more challenging locking charms to the doors. Satisfied that no one but another Auror could possibly get around the spellwork, he pushes his wand up his sleeve and turns back to the forest.
It turns its eyes to Draco, tipping its head to the side in what can only be consideration. Draco lifts an eyebrow, watching the animal in its decision making. The squirrel launches itself out of the alcove and right at Draco, digging its claws in with fierce determination. It slides a little down his chest, nails ripping even bigger holes in his shirt. It claws at his body, and Draco feels more scratches being cut into his skin. He winces in pain but doesn’t move. One of the worst things he could do is try to grab at the animal, as that will only scare it. Right? Draco isn’t sure anymore, but it sounds correct, so that’s what he’ll do.
Potter gives a soft laugh as he drags his feet over to the sofa. Draco watches from where he’s perched near his pillow as Potter flops onto the couch, immediately burrowing his dark face under the blankets.
Draco grins, his face feeling like it’s going to split open. “Thank you.”
Draco blinks. Moves his hand. It brushes against the wood within, and nothing changes. Eyebrows furrowed, he begins to move with purpose. Now he is feeling for something, anything really, whereas before he’d just kind of held his breath. It’s nerve racking, having your hand wedged into something that could kill you. Except this time it shows no sign of murderous thoughts or tendencies. Draco doesn’t know whether to jump in joy at the fact he’s alive, or to fall to the ground with the fact that he’s still here. In the middle of nowhere. He freezes. Moves his hand. It’s hitting something soft, knocking into it. What could possibly be in there that’s soft and warm? It’s the middle of winter, in some abandoned village. Draco shifts his hand slightly and curls his fingers around it.
“Draco,” Harry says before biting at his jaw.
“Sir,” he prompts.
It burrows itself into the wet fabric, trying to escape the cold rain. Draco chuckles at the little thing that might be a demon, and picks up his coat. He moves it over to the tiny hole in the wall and places it in. The alcove-niche-thing provides good protection from the rain, and the squirrel pokes its head back out of the coat. It’s adorable, even if Draco vividly remembers it launching itself at him ten minutes ago. He sighs at his predictability, and prepares himself for hours of sitting in the rain with nothing to do and no way to warm up.
He scoffs before passing me the parchment. Shit. It
“Good afternoon young sir!” He greets, rushing to shake Draco’s hand.
Draco shakes his head at him, smoothing down his own clothes and clenching his hands into fists. He can
*~*~*~
“I’m still bloody freezing,” he grunts, hands clenching the blanket and looking back at Potter.
Twenty minutes later, there is a steaming pot on the stove that smells heavenly. Harry scoops some into a bowl, not bothering with any final touches, and carries it over to the couch. Harry wobbles a bit, soup threatening to splosh out onto the tiles a couple of times. He grits his teeth, tightens his grip on the blankets
Harry shakes his head. He can’t say it, there’s no point. “The snowflakes. They’re beautiful, aren’t they?”
They turn to see where he’s gesturing and burst out laughing again. “It’s supposed to be a reference to
Draco holds up a hand, both blocking Potter’s attempts to touch him and his apology. “Don’t worry about it. It was a long time ago.”
I sigh and let my shoulders drop in defeat. “You’re right,” I murmur. Potter smirks as I accept the bag and look through it. Potter may have said that I deserve new clothes, but I heard the words beneath the sentence. He thinks I need clothes with no memories. With no association to my father or my old life of torture and abuse. When I said he was right, I was agreeing to both the surface, and the hidden, sentence. Because he is. He is right.
“Took you long enough,” Goldstein jabs. I hold my hands up in defence and take a set opposite him. Bones starts talking about our plans, and saying that most of it is fine. She says something about wanting to change the pumpkin juice fountains, and I grin behind my hand.
Death Eaters, that is, don’t forget that I’m one too.”
Potter laughs like a maniac. “You forgot. You’re not the only one living here, Malfoy. I sleep on the couch every night for fuck’s sake!”
Sure enough, sitting on the bottom shelf is a box of cereal ‘clusters’. He picks the box up, turning it around so he can see the front of it. Apparently, it’s bits of cereal stuck together, with cinnamon and small chunks of apple. Draco shrugs, deciding it’s better than nothing, and a lot healthier than Buche de Noel. He pulls a bowl out of one of the cupboards, pours some of the cereal into the bowl, and returns the box to the pantry.
“Good morning to you too,” Harry says as Draco nuzzles into his neck.
Potter pulls his own wand out, and Draco watches as he prepares to Apparate out as well. His face pales and he stares at Draco opposite him.
“You were so good Draco,” Harry says, moving back up his body. His hand squeezes around his cock, and Draco jerks.
The heading ‘Suspected Wix’ becomes overwritten with other names, and Harry has to flip the page over and write on the back too. Draco would butt in and say he needs to write down his own names, but Harry’s got them already. When Harry memorized who Draco knows is beyond him, but he doesn’t complain. If anything, it makes his heart stutter and his stomach bloom with warmth.
“Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Dean, Seamus, and all of your friends too.” Potter’s voice is dull, as if it’s something really obvious, but his eyes are alight. Draco doesn’t know how to process it, can’t tell how Potter is feeling about it.
Draco looks back at his menu, eyes scanning over the options. “Just some water, I think.” His coffee is still half-full afterall, and it would be a shame to waste it.
Muttering under my breath that
The painting is incomplete, but Draco is quite proud of it. It’s set in a snowy village—in similar colours to the cottage, Draco realises as he looks at it now—with a sculpture in the center. The statue is a dragon flying through the air, carved from ice. Draco loves it, serving both as a reminder of this experience, and of course, a reference to his name.
“Trust me Potter, he has.”
“I didn’t know we were going anywhere?!” I leap to my feet and cross the room to stand in front of my mirror. I took Potter’s advice, grudgingly, and ordered some more furniture. Most of it has arrived by now—muggle postage is a drag, but I couldn’t buy from magical shops as I’m supposed to be back in the Manor and couldn’t risk being seen—for which I am incredibly grateful for. I catch his eye in the reflection, vivid green staring back at me. He nods, and I start to cast a network Glamours. Soon, my face is twisted beyond recognition. I’ve decided to replicate the work that he did the night I escaped from St Mungo’s. My skin is once again cool tone and covered in freckles and random red splotches. I watch in amazement as my wings melt away too, hidden by a cloud of air that isn’t there.
Another scream rips itself from me, and I can feel the bones rapidly withdraw into my back. Harry’s hand instantly latches on, rubbing circles into the skin most destroyed. It leaves just as quickly as he placed it there, however. I’m about to say something, when searing pain races through me. I shout a string of curses, my back contorting into odd shapes. I’m terrified. Why is my body doing this? I feel like I’m going to be sick as the bones push out again. It’s swift, torturous, and excruciating. They rush into the air, but they feel different. They’re heavier.
be at Hogwarts, but I’ve been pulled out for the remainder of Seventh Year. Potter isn’t there anyway, so I wouldn’t be doing much. Studies became quite boring Sixth Year, if I’m being honest.
Something seems to click in Malfoy’s mind, as he instantly freezes. “It’s true, then?” He asks.
Potter sighs. “Same. Nothing’s working.”
” I joke. “I don’t call you Weasle… although I could.” I raise my eyebrows at that and Harry slaps my waist gently.
“Fuck,” he murmurs, blinking rapidly and trying to dislodge his tears. He swipes at his face, his hand coming back wet. Sighing and pressing into his eyes, he stands up. He’s going to find Harry and go to sleep, wrapped in his arms for warmth.
“Yes, woke
“But—”
“I guess so,” I mutter. My eyes roam over the names and definitions, comparing each to me. I could be a Daylight Angel with my white wings, but as I look at its entry in the book I see that the transformations are different. Their wings don’t pull back inside every time, the feathers just regrow straight out of the bones. Much less painful, I think as I grit my teeth. Not resting on that for too long, I draw a line through the name—
“Oh I’m great!” The worker, she can’t be more than seventeen, exclaims. She puts the cheese Malfoy picked out into a bag, and slides the pack of red apples closer. “I don’t think I’ve seen you around. Where are you from?”
“I’m sorry too,” Draco says on a sigh. “I didn’t mean to snap.”
“I needed him gone for a second.”
. He does a lot of things with that in mind, I think. Even though we are both in rather shit situations right now, we have somehow come up with a method to the madness. One that allows us to be ourselves, and to live another day.
see, however, a bookshelf. I squint, trying to make out some of the titles. I see Quidditch Through the Ages, a bunch of Hogwarts textbooks, and nothing else. So they went to Hogwarts…
The smell of cooking toast greets Draco as he leaves the bathroom, and his heart sinks with the realisation that Harry is already awake. He’d wanted to wake him up himself, hopefully with kisses to the forehead. It picks back up again though when he realises toast means
As I halt just a couple of metres before him, my gut wrenches, and he breaks out into a smile.
“I needed to ask you something.” Potter stammers out his reply as if it pains him to admit it.
Draco turns the light on, hands flying up to cover his eyes. After a second he realises he’s shaking, and he drops them. He whirls around to face the mirror, hands gripping the basin for support. His face is pale, his hair a mess. There is saliva dripping from his mouth, strings of it connecting his lips to his chin. He can’t believe he did that. How the hell did he do that?!
Except, nothing’s really any different than normal. Malfoy is sitting on top of the bed, fully clothed again—and why is Harry slightly disappointed about that?—reading another one of his trashy, gay romance novels. Even so, all he can picture is Malfoy flushed and desperate. He swallows, knowing he has no other choice, and pushes the door further open.
Draco leans in and whispers, “Magic.”
“Malfoy.” Draco’s name sounds mechanical coming from Potter’s mouth. Just a rhythm of nature, another second in the day; but to Draco, it means everything. Everything that happened last night has been ingrained in Draco’s mind, but that clearly isn’t the case for Potter. Or maybe it is? Because Potter never talks to Draco at work. So maybe it does mean something? Most likely, Draco is overthinking it.
Draco’s head snaps around. He feels like giving up and asking the gods to end it for him. They’d probably be delighted. “Potter. What are
“I do
As he peers around the door and runs his eyes over the room, he feels his mouth fall open. It’s beautiful. Light wood makes up the many bookshelves, piling up in tall stacks all the way to the ceiling. Book covers of every material and colour fill each shelf, titles written in swirling loops visible even from a distance. Draco pauses though, not yet entering the shop. Why was it unlocked? Why didn’t the door creak or show any sign of disuse? Even with dusty windows and cold door handles, things aren’t adding up as neatly as they should. It’s almost as if someone else has been here recently. That can’t possibly be the case though, because the village is deserted. That much is all too obvious.
Draco approves of, he’s wearing something Draco definitely does not. First, there’s a plain white singlet, and then a purple sweater. Purple looks quite good on him, he thinks, but he isn’t sure he’ll ever wear it after this whole experience. But that’s not the bad part. No, his
anything. He huffs a breath out and fiddles with the sweater he’s wearing. It’s the one Ron gave him for Christmas last year, a beautiful red that stands out dramatically in the subtle colours of the living room. Harry doesn’t particularly like the picture on the front, but it’s comfortable and warm and reminds him of his friends.
“Help me move it,” Potter announces after a minute in thoughtful silence.
Whispers shoot around the hall, everyone conspiring and holding their breath. All of us are wondering who will be selected.
*~*~*~
Harry’s face warms, and as he looks up he notices how close he is sitting to Malfoy. Strangely enough, he’s not overcome by the urge to move away. Instead, he wants to rest back into Malfoy’s touch, to fall asleep next to him again. He sighs, shakes his head, and forces himself to pull away. He’d had enough trouble convincing Malfoy that them falling asleep together was just because of the cold, if he practically drapes himself over the other man, he might be a bit less persuadable.
I startle back into the present, Harry’s face right in front of mine. His green eyes are tired and weary, but his mouth is crinkled into a smile. I return it and lean forward to press my lips against his. He sighs contentedly, his arms wrapping up around my neck.
It’s bitterly cold as Harry makes his way down the cottage’s path. Clouds cover the sky and it looks like it will snow later in the evening. Harry shivers and pulls his coat tighter around himself, trying to block the cold from seeping in. If Malfoy isn’t going to come back to the cottage, then Harry isn’t going to
“Yeah,” Potter says, already tucking his wand into one of his many pockets. “The back is pressed against the water fountain, and I need to get to it.”
“I’m sure you’ve had tea these past few weeks with me,” Draco says, trying to remember what’s actually happened.
“There. That is perfect. Now repeat that for the rest of the roots.” The girl blushes and starts on the next root. This one leaves a bit to be desired, but is significantly better than how she started.
Draco’s head snaps to his. “Who on earth would make a
A stick breaks behind me and I jump. Pivoting around, I’m met with sad, green eyes.
Draco flushes. “I did no such thing!” Even though he knows that he
“Oh believe me, that didn’t go unnoticed.” I shuffle closer to Harry so I can see the book, and maybe also because he’s warm and I’m shivering.
“Don’t forget there’s still the other two people we haven’t thought of. The leader could be one of them as well.”
I reply, “I’m not a prude. I’m also neither gay, nor seeing someone.” With that final comment I place my books in my trunk and fall into bed.
Harry steps back, shaking his head at him but softening it with a smile. “Not today, Draco.”
“Uh, sir. Is it supposed to be dark green? I thought it had to be yellow?” Abigail lifts me from the depths of my mind, and I splutter.
Draco nods in agreement, but finds that that metaphor doesn’t quite work for him. “For me, it’s the opposite, I think. For me, you’re the chain attached to the anchor. The only thing stopping me from dropping away completely and becoming lost if the water’s too deep.”
Malfoy huffs a small laugh. “Not very. We work together five days a week, but we don’t really talk about ourselves, you know? The only time we really speak is when we’re drunk, which means we don’t remember any of it.”
Needy hands grab at Draco’s waist, and he is pulled off of the wall and walked backwards. He doesn’t know how Potter managed to know where his bed is, but he is being pushed onto it hungrily. Opening his eyes, he sees Potter standing above him, just looking. Draco takes his time to roam over Potter’s body with his eyes too, and smirks at his appearance. He is absolutely dishevelled, totally messed up. His hair is somehow in more tangles than usual, and his lips are swollen red from snogging. Green eyes are clouded over with what can only be discerned as arousal, and all Draco wants is that body on his. Impatient, he pulls Potter down to him by his belt loops.
,” Harry says, tipping his head back. Draco uses it as an invitation to lick up his throat.
Draco hums. He looks around the village, a slight wind blowing trees gently and floating leaves along the ground. “It’s beautiful here.”
I nod before leaning over her. I line my ear up to her mouth and look down at her chest. Puffs of air hit my cheek and I can faintly hear breath from her nose. There is little movement in her chest, and I pull away.
“Merlin Draco, you can’t just say that!” Harry's head is spinning with the confession, and all thoughts and plans fly out the window.
The lists are missing so much it’s not even funny, and Harry’s amazed it’s taken him so long to update it. He scribbles down some more dot points, adding Malfoy’s incident with the hole, the new information about the Cabinet, the people he saw in the forest, Malfoy’s fever and injuries, and what just happened. Now he’s thinking about it, he really needs to update
“Why don’t you tell me about how you Rose?” Mother pulls away from the hug, rapidly turning around and walking back to the bed. She takes a second to compose herself as she sits, before offering me the armchair in the corner. “And about Mr. Potter, perhaps?”
I don’t know what he expects me to do. ‘Help me defeat Voldemort.’ Honestly. I would love for him to be killed, gone. But I can’t have a part in that. My family. My reputation. My mother, especially. I briefly wonder where she is, before deciding that Potter would’ve told me if something had gone wrong. He would’ve at least mentioned it. When did I become so sure.
going to fall in the process. This time.
He places the cups down, listening to the clink of Harry’s glass hitting the wood. Harry slides over to him, pulling him against him. Draco chuckles as Harry presses his lips to his forehead.
“No one really knows,” the boy says, tucking some of his purple hair behind his ear. “All we’re sure of is that it was a
Walking even closer to me, he reaches for my arm. His touch is warm and gentle, yet firm, and I relax into it. We are now so close I can see all of the tiny freckles spreading over his nose. His shamrock eyes close in on mine, and I can’t help thinking that they shine like emeralds. His breathing has shallowed, and a very faint pink coats his cheeks. It’s rather cute… He blinks, and I’m drawn out of my thoughts. His hand leaves my arm, and instead snakes its way to my hip. I gasp and lower my eyes to his hand. A soft pressure on my chin forces me to lift my head and meet his eyes. My breathing became irregular sometime ago, and now my palms are sweating. Oh, come on Draco…. Potter looks like fire and smoke, eyes boring into mine, threatening to set me alight. The soft hand on my hip tightens it’s grasp and moves further around to my back. The gentle hand on my chin also moves, and he is suddenly clutching the side of my neck. Feeling stupid standing here, I lift my own hands and place one on his waist and the other on his chest. I can feel each of his breaths and lose myself in the feel of him.
“Like? We’re stuck here.”
, fuck.” Harry’s heart hammers in his chest as he brings a hand up to rub at his head. He’s sitting on the floor, a blanket twisted around him and a very annoyed looking Draco on the couch behind him. “What the hell Malfoy?!”
“Mine,” he demands. He doesn’t want to have to get out of bed before dawn, especially not when he is so tired.
Harry’s breath catches. “And you wanted me to hold you… why?”
Instead, he nods decisively at him and straightens his clothes out. Pushing away thoughts of Potter and work, Draco realises that the situation they’ve found themselves in is actually quite strange. It’s not everyday that you wake up nestled against your former-enemy turned reluctant colleague turned— turned what? Draco doesn’t know how he’d define this relative peace forming between them, so instead decides to add it to the list of things he’s ignoring. Regardless, something about their current situation isn’t sitting right with him. It feels… strange. Set up, almost.
much about the shirt, since it was already ruined anyway. He huffs a breath and knows what he wants to do. Despite everything, he can’t allow the bloody thing to die like this. It may be his fate to die at the bottom of a hole, but it’s not the squirrel’s.
With that done, Draco walks around and looks for somewhere to buy bath things from. He passes the butcher, the baker, a home decorations shop that he doesn’t remember seeing before, and lots more. None of them will sell anything close to what he’s after. As he passes the grocer, he thinks ‘what the hell’ and turns into it. It was full of things last time he went shopping, so he might have some luck here. If not, it’s back to the drawing board for Pansy.
Draco tears his eyes away, remembering about the second item. He places the book down on the bed and opens the wrapping paper further. Inside, he finds what looks to be a wallet. It’s made of beautiful white leather, his given name inscribed on the front in blue. He picks it up, running his fingers over the soft material. It’s smooth, light under his fingers. The colour almost blends into his skin with how pale he is, and he chuckles at the idea of that. He really should get some more sun.
“Malfoy, what’s there?”
“Okay, yeah, whatever.”
It’s a very normal looking bakery, with chalkboards stating specials and glass cabinets displaying the goods. Harry’s eyes roam over the counter and its various knickknacks, and spots a very strange looking plant. It’s dark green, sitting in a small white pot, and is curved up to the left. From the end of the curve dangles a red bauble.
A third group would have been in charge of making the items: dyeing the leather and cotton, creating the robes for the group Harry stumbled across in the forest, maybe even altering the Cabinets aesthetically. The only people he can think of that would be interested in that are Luna and Seamus, both of them being creative and extremely talented in the arts. It would make sense, since neither are particularly powerful, either magically or physically. Harry feels kind of bad thinking about them like that, but it is true. If Seamus has a knack of blowing up cauldrons, what would he be like dealing with delicate magic to this degree?
“I was going to offer to cook for you, but I guess I have my answer.” Potter huffs and walks over to the kitchen.
“All the more reason to try again!” He grins. “May I?” He gestures to my room, and I nod. Walking in, he reaches his arms out and grabs my hands. I’m pulled off of my bed and dragged out of my room. Fighting the urge to pull Harry closer, I instead pull my hand away.
Potter chuckles. “I was thinking maybe some more detection spells and other things you might like to try, and a thorough physical exam.”
you been doing?” I ask, trying to hide a laugh.
“Look at me,” Harry urges, digging his fingers into Draco’s thighs. “If you don’t look at me, this isn’t happening.”
Harry blinks his eyes open, struggling to get them to focus. Glasses. Right. He flings an arm out, hoping to hit a table or something of the like where he could’ve put them. When he doesn’t, and instead just causes more pain down his back, he gives up. He sleeps with his wand in his pocket. Very dangerous, he knows, but it’s a habit left over from- Well, never mind
The wall explodes, sending plaster and dust everywhere. Harry scrabbles to cover his ears and turn his back, berating himself for not putting any charms up. It’s all well and good to go about removing walls to look for signs of tampering, but he could at least have been somewhat prepared. Instead, he’s standing in the living room in grey sweatpants and a dark purple, Muggle hoodie, brandishing his wand about and deliberately exploding walls without any form of protection. The epitome of stupid, really.
said Harry was comfortable, he clearly wasn’t lying.
Draco groans, shivering despite the warmth coursing through his body. He starts sweating, growing more and more uncomfortable as the seconds tick by.
“Cheer up Potter! At least you didn’t almost lose your hand to a Cornish pixie when it caught you wanking!”
A warm feeling trickles up my spine, and I’m reassured. For the moment. Maybe Father won’t be able to find me. Potter is watching me again, and I nod at him silently. He pulls up his own hood (when did he get those robes?) and grabs my hand. I open my door and we walk out into the corridor.
Malfoy scoffs. “Really?”
“I’m so close,” he grunts, voice gravelly and deep.
“Difficult?” I ask, knowing the answer already.
“Not deliberately,” Harry replies, not bothering to elaborate. “First, the day after you left, I went looking through the forest again.” Malfoy huffs, and Harry ignores it. “I stumbled across a group of,” he checks his paper, “11 wix, all in purple and silver robes. There was one person who was some kind of leader, I guess? There was a spell over their voice so I couldn’t figure out anything about the person by listening alone. They were talking about something time sensitive, and it sounded really important.”
“Too warm,” he mumbles.
*~*~*~
“Oh yeah…”
in this bag. Eyes widening, he very slowly and carefully extracts the tiny canvas, being extremely cautious of not damaging it. Rocking back onto his knees, Draco runs his eyes over it. Satisfied that it hasn’t been harmed, he rises onto his feet and puts it back to its original size.
Draco smiles. “I guess I am.”
“So we aren’t.” He starts reading again, and moves onto the next thing on the list.
“I’m not sure,” Harry murmurs back. He leaves in a jog, pulling Draco along with him. Together they approach the crowd, pushing through the people and looking up above them.
She offers me another smile before standing from the bed. “Now, I’m hungry and am going to fix myself a meal. Would you and Mr. Potter like one too?”
What he sees though, is Draco sitting up in bed reading. His book is one of the new ones he bought from the village, the cover a beautiful beach with ‘Merry Christmas’ written in the sand. The irony of Draco buying a Christmas romance while getting together with Harry isn’t lost on him. He frowns though, eyes moving down to his arms. If it isn’t Draco he’s holding… A pillow. A bloody pillow is in his arms. Harry sighs.
“Your cock!” Draco says, hips bucking into Harry’s hand. “If you don’t put your fucking cock in me—”
“Well, come on a walk then. You haven’t been out of Grimmauld Place for ages.”
“Can someone please tell me what just happened?” Hermione asks, clearly not keeping up with the realisation still fresh in my mind, regardless of Harry’s comforting presence.
“What do I want with that?” Draco asks, scrunching his nose up.
“Crowds?” Harry asks, nodding out to the amount of people standing around.
Draco just shakes his head, turning away so Harry can’t see his smile. “Let’s hear it then.”
hugs very often, preferring more ‘refined’ means of affection, as his mother would put it. Now though, a day later, he realises it was
With one last glance at Malfoy, Harry pulls his own shirt off and drops it to the floor. He lifts the blanket and slides in under it, and he’s immediately being grabbed. Arms wrap his chest and neck, icy feet pressing against his legs. Harry sighs, accepting his fate, and turns around so his head can rest against Malfoy’s chest. He breathes in the other man’s scent and wraps his arms around him, pulling him closer. Harry drifts off to sleep like that, wrapped up in Draco Malfoy.
“Come
Harry smiles and kisses me softly, lips pressed together for a brief second. “You know what I miss?” He asks out of nowhere.
“Of course I’ve eaten, I’m perfectly capable of caring for myself,
Harry laughs, shaking his head. “
Draco knocks his head against the dirt wall behind him. He needs to stop thinking of Potter. Needs to stop imagining him in comfort like he has multiple times today. He stares into space. The squirrel is long gone, his only source of company and entertainment vanished into the rain. It had slept for a bit, ate a bit of the food, and then used Draco’s head as a stepping stool for jumping out of the hole. He doesn’t know how it jumped high enough to get out, but it managed somehow. Draco closes his eyes, rain falling onto his forehead and running down his face. He’s sure he looks like a right mess. His hair is no doubt soaked with mud and rain, he’s body is covered in bruises and cuts with blood dripping from them and mixing with the water, and he’s so tired he could drop dead and not be able to tell the difference.
Draco shakes his head. “Not a chance,
Harry blushes fiercely, feeling his skin boil.
He sighs. He needs to talk to Malfoy about sleeping in the bed tonight. There’s no way on earth that Harry can spend another night on the couch. It’s only been two nights in a row, and his neck and back are already killing him. Harry should really talk to Malfoy about
