The man looks up, throwing the fag on the ground and stepping on it.
“And everytime I force myself,” Harry says, his voice sounds broken to his own ears. “Everytime I hate myself a bit more, and I hate you for not seeing it. I hate you for pressing the issue and begging and making me feel that I’m not enough, or that I am not open minded enough or good enough or sexy enough or interesting enough!” Sadness and anger twist inside of him.
“Are you really Mum’s gay cousin?”

“You are such a
Too hard to bear sometimes.
“Same!” Theo smiles.
And after the first words, he realises there are many other words that need to come out. They talk for hours, they walk back to his flat and talk and talk, while Theo cooks some bad pasta carbonara and they eat in front of the telly. He tells Theo everything, about his fears, his loneliness, his anger. He tells him about Harry and about his hollowing sadness and how he misses his previous life.
Even though...
also, thank you very much for your kind support, babies! <3
He stands up, excusing himself and walking towards the bathroom. His breath is catching in the back of his throat and his eyes are starting to sting.
with you?” Draco spats. Looking for his own wand and turning to fix the lightbulb.
Pansy snorts and he snaps his eyes open and looks at her.
This is my favourite chapter so far. I loved writing it, and I hope you guys enjoyed reading. I think my endless love for Wolfstar was very pronounced, wasn't it? Thank you for all the comments and kudos and encouragements! Maybe drop a line today? I think this chapter rather deserves some love. Draco, my darling, you definitely deserve all the love in the world and many, many years to live and love and find happiness <3
“You were shit,” he spits, before taking a sip to calm himself. “You were all shit.” His voice is firm now, and he feels sorry for Narcissa’s son.
“I feel like I will never be able to fuck again. I’ll be too concerned and scared and cornered, and what if I transmit it?” He shakes his head. “But it’s not just that, you know. I miss it, I crave it, the feeling of being desired, the debauchery, the game, to go with a man to a dark alley and just have a go at it. Dirty and messy and nasty and—”
Harry shudders at the thought.
He shouldn’t need to do it without wanting it. He shouldn’t need to be bargaining  his own limits everytime. He feels disrespected.
And suddenly, he can’t breathe, because Draco is
Which isn’t very healthy.
“C’mon Potter, I need breakfast before I faint,” Draco huffs. She stares down at him, her perfect eyebrow shooting up as she catches sight of  Harry’s obvious erection under the sheets. “Well,” she smirks darkly, “good morning to you too.” She huffs a laugh and opens the door with a bang.
” even after Harry told him specifically a few weeks earlier that he really didn’t feel comfortable with “
“Draco—”
“Overreacting my arse,” he spat at the mirror.
It feels like rotten tree roots tangled with his soft, vulnerable entrails.
“I hoped,” Draco admits, smiling softly, shrugging his shoulders. Then his nose wrinkles a bit, clearing his throat and saying: “It’s reciprocal.”
“Let’s go home now. I’ll tell you everything about my grand gay life!” Sirius beams. “I told Harry I would bring him a surprise,” he informs them. He disentangles from Draco and kisses Remus hotly on the mouth. “Hey, beauty,” Sirius winks theatrically at Remus, who laughs.
He loves Draco, his sharpness, his imperfections, his curiosities, the way his eyes shine and dart quickly to check if Harry is still there.
Hermione is the only one who understands—well, her and Luna. But Luna is understanding and sweet about everyone's life choices. They get it.
He gets into bed and kisses Draco softly. Something turns inside his chest, something observing from a different perspective as Draco hugs him under the blankets with so much familiarity. It pains him how Draco drops a kiss exactly over Harry’s scar, over his heart.
“It wasn’t a dream, Harry,” he whispers back, cupping Harry’s cheek and caressing his sleep-warm skin.
“Draco...”
is a stand alone story, and whatever comes next will be just me giving it a bit of extra information.
He’s hypnotised.
“Hey, are you still going out tonight? I need a drink.”
Why couldn’t they be satisfied with the multiple hours of sex they just had?
“Fine,” Sirius concedes, voice tight. “I’ll help, but not for you. For him. No one deserves to go through what I've been. And this kid will need family, and he will need people who he can relate to—gay people, queer people, HIV-positive people.”
“What are you doing in the dark, pup?” Sirius asks, blinking at the sudden light.
“Sorry that I was late,” he starts, and his voice sounds like warm tea and chocolate cake. It’s weirdly calming. “I hear you talk and I hear myself,” he says, looking at Draco and he lets out a bitter laugh, shaking his head and sighing sadly. “I was nineteen and had sex only twice in my life when I was diagnosed,” he tells them. There’s such sorrow in his eyes. “I hated myself so much for trying it out with a man, for craving it so much that I fucked up everything.”
tw: grieving
Harry would always take a moment, before disrupting the quiet surrounding Draco, just to watch him. He was deeply in love and he felt at home. Even when they fought and said hurtful things, seeing Draco perched on the countertop was like staring at a favourite painting.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry only observes. There’s something so compelling and beautiful in the way Draco is drawn to new things, new people, new information. He’s curious and adventurous and Harry has always found that so special.
Tw: slut shaming and internalised homophobia. I didn’t want to sugar coat it, as anger, guilt and shame are common parts of the grieving process.
“We’ve been talking for months,” Draco tells them. “And I only told him recently, and he kissed me!” he says, biting his lip and smiling stupidly. “He said:
Suddenly, it's like Draco is finding his footing in life again, slowly and steadily. And it’s beautiful—it's amazing and he loves it. He feels alive in a way that is truthful to himself. He doesn’t know when or how it started, but it’s happening and he couldn’t be more pleased. He thinks maybe there’s not only hope for love, but also hope for happiness, hope for life.
They sit at the park and sip at their takeaway tea. It’s not raining for a change, but the air is cold and crisp. It makes Draco shiver and hold on to the warmth of the paper cup, his long thin fingers holding on to the heat like a starved man.
Life flows like river water, strong and intense, then sometimes slow and calm. And life right now feels tempestuous, just like his heart beating a fast tempo while Malfoy checks Teddy’s temperature and runs diagnostic spells and checks his tonsils with a blue light on the tip of his wand.
Draco blinks surprised at him and smiles softly; he looks so sad.
Harry doesn’t know exactly why he is suddenly so anxious.
He needs a moment to calm his body, feeling overwhelmed with Harry’s tight hold around his cock, and he peppers kisses on Harry’s shoulder blades and his sweaty neck and caresses his sides, before moving.
Then Sirius’ dad died, and to everyone’s surprise, left him a third of his fortune, so Sirius stopped working at the motorbike shop and they bought the bookstore from old Mr Binns who wanted to go back to Aberdeen with his grandchildren.
They stay there with him in silence for a while until Harry feels strong enough to move, slowly. Sirius tucks him in this time, for real, like when he was a kid.
And Draco busies himself in stretching Harry open with great amounts of lube and greedy fingers. He is mesmerised as Harry opens up and moans and gasps and breathes deeply, asking for more and deeper.
And Draco...
The feeling is overpowering and tense, making his skin tingle with arousal and need and devotion, as he sits back on his knees and watches enraptured as Harry moves: muscles flexing under beautiful olive skin, turning under Draco’s body and then disentangling, manoeuvering himself to rest the side of his face against the fluffy pillow, bringing his knees up and apart, exposing himself to Draco’s hungry eyes.

~Fim~
“That’s really kind of you, Sirius,” she says politely. “I’ll be forever grateful.”
. He looks so much like a perfect mix of Great Aunt Walburga and Great Uncle Orion all of a sudden.
He hated it. Maybe he should just accept they were not the best match anymore.
“I’m reaching out to you in the hopes that you may be amenable to help me learn. I know your partner is HIV-positive, Andromeda told me once, a long time ago. And I hope I can maybe be a better person to you as well.” Her eyes shine with unshed tears. “I’m very sorry Sirius, but I had no strength back then to protect you, nor the capability or critical thinking, or the open-mindedness to see homosexuality as something normal. I was young and prejudiced and weak.”
He feels his body go cold, heartbeats slowing down, his own breath comes out shaky and his hands are sweaty and disgusting. Harry stares at them in silence, embarrassed and cold. Oh gods, so cold. And suddenly he understands most of it was only in his head.
“Want me to finish him off?”
him. This is the dragon he’s been living with. This is the person that held him together during the worst period of his life. This is the man who holds his bare pulsing heart in his hands.
Both of them walk up to the middle of the circle of chairs and Remus smiles brightly at him.
“Intervention over, now if you don’t mind, I’ll go back out there and try to charm Longbottom into a threesome.”
“What are you talking about, Sirius? And can you please lower your voice.” Her voice tightens, looking around.
“Oh boy...” he mutters, shutting his eyes closed and lying down, feeling the room spinning around him in dizzying circles. “HURRY UP, DAD, I’M GOING TO FAINT!!”
He drops to his knees and takes Draco in his mouth, eyes closed with a fiery kind of anger and madness and hate. He sucks him off, while Draco clings to his hair, to the table, thrusting into Harry’s mouth and moaning deliriously.
“But it's okay now,” Sirius reassures him with a gentle squeeze of their hands. “I don't want you to put yourself at risk, I love you too much to let someone play with your feelings.”
“Thank you, Moony,” he whispers wetly. “I’ll take good care of Harry, I promise.”
“But it would be so fun to try-” Draco starts, but Harry shuts him up with his tongue.
Draco sighs.
“Good! Well, I will go tell Horace about it, that old drag is going to flip!”
He becomes used to it. Harry surrenders to the emotions and feelings and the inevitability of it. He starts to enjoy the way his body lights up when Draco is around, how his eyes chase him in the room, how his breath speeds up a bit every time their gaze holds or when they exchange words.
“But I’m not enough.”
er... *looks around*... are you mad at
“I’m not sure I like this whole thing.”
“Hello,” Harry welcomes the blonde woman. “How can I help you today?”
Narcisa gives a small nod.
Harry loves this place.
“Are you serious?”
Because there’s hope in this bright, colourful room.
“Yes, pup, you look very tired.” Sirius agrees.
Once they move and each take a chair, keeping close to Harry, Remus smiles warmly at him.
To honour the ones long lost and the ones who survived. Counting the days as blessings.
“C’mon now. Pads is outside. I would love to introduce you two.”
“Hmm.”
But love can also be simple, soft, kind. It can be a mole behind one’s ear, and a constellation on someone’s back, it can be a touch on a child’s brow or long fingers braiding a friend’s hair.
“Here you are.”
He laughs at that and Draco feels like he can release the breath he’s been holding.
He walked into the bathroom at the end of the hall, washed up quickly, putting on sweatpants and an old t-shirt and ventured through the hallway, listening to Draco and the Irish dude going on again, quite loudly.
He feels a pang.
But Harry had honestly believed...
Harry enjoyed most of it. The way the Irish lad kissed him like his life depended on it, how he appreciated each and every single touch on Harry’s body, muttering nice words with a thick accent. As thick as his dick. How he managed to bring Draco closer and soon enough the three of them were dissolving into a gasping mess of hot bodies and slick fluids on top of the coverlet of the bed.
Draco sucks one ball into his mouth then the other, then both. He feels greedy and starved and alive. So fucking alive and the heat inside his body is one overwhelming feeling of raw pleasure and surrender.
“I started dating a boy,” he says, quietly. Mr. Dumbledore claps cheerfully and Cho whistles, laughing and Draco beams at them, feeling the spark of happiness burn hot inside of him. “He said we’re boyfriends now, and as I told you before, I’ve never loved anyone. But I’m crazy about him,” he confesses, feeling his cheeks grow warm. Remus watches him with a soft, proud smile. “But he’s not HIV-positive and I worry about it,” he explains, now looking back at Remus. “I mainly worry about broken condoms, to be honest.” The group members nod understandingly.
Draco is sitting on the old threadbare rug, naked long legs crossed, hands gently holding a steaming mug of coffee, hair forming a messy blond halo on the top of his head, falling lovingly over one side of his brow, eyes transfixed on the old Black genealogical tree tapestry.
Draco looks around and sees Luna talking animatedly with Mr Dumbledore and Horace by the rainbow Christmas tree, and that Remus is quietly nodding at Cho as she gestures around her big baby bump. It’s getting closer to her last trimester.
He just needed a bit of space, a bit of time to understand why the fuck he was dealing with all this like a little shit. Like a fucking teen with a broken heart.
“Oh, Potter,” she sounds serious, watching his face with careful eyes. She is probably evaluating the red rims, probably catching how his hands shake though he’s trying to get a hold on it. “I’m guessing this is about the Austrian hottie talking to your husband.”
He is not though.
It’s his mimicking Harry in a baby voice that gets a rise out of Harry and he throws a cushion at his godfather’s face, but Remus catches the cushion midair before it crashes against Sirius and his plate of cake.
“Mr Dumbledore—Albus, that would be a great pleasure, an honour even!” he babbles, feeling awkward and soft, his heart fit to burst with the feeling of possibility.
“Oh, Sirius,” Remus mutters, disapprovingly, putting the cushion on the floor and sitting on it. “You are
Sirius takes the information in. The poor kid. He can imagine the fear.
And then he sees.

Harry grabs his legs, the tight globes of his arse, leaving crescent moon marks with his nails, bruising with his finger prints. The anger is spiking inside his chest in a mix of self loathing and hatred over his own husband and he knows deep down that he shouldn’t be doing any of this.
He writes it down.
“Wrong. You thought wrong!” His voice is cold and he doesn’t even say goodbye to anyone, grabbing their coats and leaving the house without seeing anyone on their way out and apparating them back to their townhouse.
It resonates with Draco. The guilt, the disgust, the undeservedness that accompanies bad outcomes. The idea that now he doesn’t get to have happy, beautiful, joyous experiences.
thank you for all the lovely comments! you are all too kind to me. I hope you enjoyed this chapter! x tai

“I try...”
about his health. “I’ve been with Remus for twenty-six years now, and I’ve never got a positive test in my life. Your son will need guidance and support.
As if he could hear Harry’s thoughts, Draco looks straight up to him. The music is so loud Harry feels like he is floating. Grey eyes focus on him with that slow, indecent smile... Harry feels himself hardening inside his pants and he just wishes he could have Draco’s attention only for himself.
Harry’s breath hitches and he chokes stupidly on his own spit while coughing and clicking in the photo attached to the email.
“It’s too much.” He rasped. Voice almost catching in the back of his throat.
Draco looks up at Harry with excitement written all over his face. “Walden has one of the most exquisite homoerotic art collections of the 19th century, all safe under protected wards in his estate. Guess what, Harry?” he beams at him and Harry smiles, checking Walden's smug face floating. “We are bringing it to London!”
He wonders if he’s getting old. If something is wrong with his libido. If he should go to a sex therapist or something.
After a few silent minutes, Draco takes him in his arms and holds him for a while. Clutching to each other, scared and devastated. Draco kisses the top of his head and hugs Harry while both of them cry, until their sobs quieten and their breathing stabilizes again.
, Harry?”
We all know that back in 2004, transitioning for trans folk was not something easy to achieve (we’re in bloody 2020, and it is still insanely hard to get hormones and surgery), BUT I’m using a bit of poetic license here and this chapter contains one (1) really fit trans counsellor, who—god bless him—got his top surgery and hormones alright in our imaginary 2004. This character was inspired by my best friend Will, an amazing man that has a huge heart and a beautiful way with words. He’s a massive blessing in my life! I can only drool so much at his gorgeous writer-psychologist vibe and style, his arms, his legs, his hands, his smile, his eyes, his beard, his voice, his whole amazing being!! As you can see, my dear readers, this author has one (1) strong crush. Will you marry me, William? <3
“Oh yes,” he agrees, voice turning soft at Harry’s presence.
and she is gorgeous and he’s never loved someone like this– he’s never wanted so much in his life. And he wants her, her, her.
“He’s HIV-positive, Sirius,” she whispers—there’s fear in her voice now.
And Draco is kissing him, gentle and careful at the beginning, lips touching softly and tenderly, and it feels beautiful, all things inside Harry are fluttering and giving space to something new: to reality, to experience, to liveliness.
She smiles. This time not sadly, not meanly. It’s just a very honest smile.
you came?
(See the end of the chapter for
This is all sexy and painful in equal measures. He knows it is. He deeply wishes Draco wouldn’t need the extra effort to find sex with Harry more appealing, less boring.
He feels defeated. He wants this feeling to end but it is a bloody ocean of never-ending terror. And he shakes with it, as if his whole body is being dragged by the uncontrollable waves of anger.
Harry stares at the mirror. He looks pale with humid eyes. He’s been here for at least ten minutes trying to calm the fuck down and not overreact. That's what Draco called it the last time: overreaction. Since the last time when they brought the Irish guy back home .
“Mmm...” Draco starts kissing his neck, tongue lapping and mouth sucking and Harry trembles with a spark, feeling his cock fill and his knees go weak.
The strong pull of affection and hope blossoms like springtime in Harry’s chest. Inside his body, there are waves crashing and winds blowing and rainforest storming.
Harry James Potter, go read the goddamn email, you shit! xD Much love your way, my darlings. What comes next now?
“I cut myself. The floor is full of shards, don’t step on it,” he adds quickly, before Remus could walk in.
Harry knows that.
And there it is: the tears are back, prickling his eyes stubbornly.
And the signs are all there again. Draco is already disengaging, walking out of the room, putting on some rather loud music with a sharp flick of his wand and disappearing to his own personal headspace.
sensitive,” he reproaches.
They fucked for hours, or at least it felt like hours. Harry was pretty spent when they started it all over again. The sheer appreciation in Draco’s eyes once Oisin, or Eoin, or Eammon started sucking his dick back to life once again.
, he thinks. This is the most embarrassing and awkward moment of his life. He will forever remember the hot burn of shame of having his boyfriend’s dad is giving him
How Harry felt the bite of guilt like poison every time he visited Moony in the ITU.
“So, I have something coming up on the 20th,” he says boldly. “It’s a queer literature reading event, and I’m going to be reading some of my things. So I was wondering if you guys would like to come along,” Draco invites them cheerfully.
“What’s going on?” he asks without turning.
The workload of paperwork today was insane. Three cases solved and ready to go, people dispatched to Azkaban or major community services assigned and Harry had to inspect all the reports and file whatever inconclusive or lacking bit before signing and sending it down to the Archives. A massive pain in the arse. Harry had a fucking headache since lunch break. Most of his days have been like this lately; they were even advertising for Auror recruitment next month, as they were short on personnel.
Albus smiles brightly at him.
“You shouldn’t look at me like that,” she says, and she’s flirting, because Harry has seen her flirting so many times he could recognise it even in his sleep.
Harry looks up in time to see the way Draco grabs the wine bottle by the neck, how he looks disappointed, a stern look on his face, pouring another quite large glass of red and standing up in a fluid motion.
He falls asleep with Draco’s legs tangled with his, feeling his soft breaths against his neck, his eyes damp, but feeling weirdly calm, as if suspended in the air.
I hope you enjoy this chapter! :)
And it’s all so dark inside his heart that he drinks, drinks, drinks the pain away.
“Couldn’t sleep,” he shrugs.
He lets out another breathy, wet sob, eyes shut tight and hands grabbing hard at Sirius’s hands.
“You are disgusting!” Harry hurries out of the kitchen, cursing under his breath. “Jesus!”
And Draco shivers with the intensity of his velvety voice and bright grey eyes, with the weight of Sirius’s words.
“Maybe we should talk after New Year’s Eve. I’ve been talking to Horace, and a few of us old queers would love to share our stories with the younger generations. I’m sure even Remus would like to join us. That is, if you would like to maybe engage in this bit of indulgence for old queer people’s sake.”
To be honest, Draco has been so wrapped up in his own journey of acceptance that he didn’t realise the LGBT Centre had different group activities, for different target cohorts. There’s a group for LGBT teenagers and another one for parents. Then there’s the Trans Circle, the Sex Workers Group, and the HIV-positive and AIDS sessions.
“Harry?”
Harry smiles looking at his feet, adjusting his own coat.
Draco averts his eyes with embarrassment.
prompt: colourful lights
Harry thinks these grey eyes carry such depth, a mix of sadness and mystery, as if he had lived a whole life, and Harry asks himself what else Draco is not telling him.
Wake, wake, wake.
And Molly laughs at him, patting his cheek softly, kindly. Muttering when would they have ever imagined having Draco round their kitchen so often, and how he turned into such an admirable young man.
“It must be important, she’s never called you before.”
It feels surreal and too much and not enough.
“What happened?” Harry asks, and he feels terrible, because he spent the whole day doing nothing and thinking of her and avoiding her and feeling sorry for himself and his life, just like he has been doing since the war. Since he couldn’t manage more violence and his Auror dreams went to hell, since he stood on that bridge, thinking of dying this time for real, but instead found Draco there, thinking of dying too, and they stared at the dark dark dark sky, and the space bodies and then stared into each others eyes and muttered secrets and truths like it was the last thing they would do in life. And Harry wanted the pain to be over, but when Draco said “She, she, she,” Harry decided he wanted to stay and watch. To stay and see. To be mesmerised by Draco and her life and her changes and her light and her life, life,
“Almost six months ago, now. He only told me a few weeks ago, and then I called you.”
“The loneliness of being inadequate, of being the outcast, the weak one; it kept me a prisoner of the darkness in my own mind, Draco.” His voice is firm in a way Theo normally doesn’t show, the firmness of someone talking from experience. “Y
He touches himself while reading the answer, sneaking his hand under the waistband and teasing the head of his cock.

makes an appearance...
“I hate you,” Harry mutters, closing his eyes. “I’m so glad I gave in and am going to this new club with my friends tonight. I’ll get so shitfaced I’ll forget all about this bit of information.” He takes a deep calming breath. “I’ve just decided, I’m not moving back after all. I’ll go to my room and pack my poster of Brian Kinney and LEAVE!”
“Concerning your worries about condoms breaking,” Remus laughs, shaking his head, and Draco feels his face flush, all embarrassed and small and fucking young and exposed. “Don’t worry too much, condoms don’t break that easily. I should know,” he adds, laughing at Draco’s flushed face.
“I don’t think he is bored of you, you know,” she pops a chip to her mouth, and sips on her IPA Lagunita. “Maybe he is just curious. It's normal to want to spice things up, isn’t it?”
Draco feels his body turn soft in the chair. With relief. With the gentle, warm feeling that somehow, someway, this complete stranger with soft hazel eyes has a love story still going on for him.
prompt: it was an ice deer figure, so: PRONGS! happy reading babes!
“Please don’t.”
“It’s not like I don’t want to see them, it’s just that Draco has been a bit closed off lately, and I don’t know... It’s driving me mad.”
I can't believe it took me 34k to bring us here, to this moment. oh well, here, have at it!
“You are the
“So boring, Auror Potter,” Draco restots, rolling his hips anyways, playfully. It pushes all the wrong buttons and Harry feels himself deflating. “You could tie me to the bed and spank me...”
Sirius must understand, must realise—because having death’s breath on the nape of their necks made them all realise how fleeting life can be.
, light, light.
He has this thing that Harry could never explain. A specific colour in his irises when the sun sets reddish in the horizon on summertime. When the grey in his eyes shine with sparks of gold.
So Harry drives Remus to the Friday evening HIV-positive support group at the LGBT centre.
Harry asks himself how many constellations he could count, if he dared to press his fingers and draw the patterns on Draco's back. They are not like the Milky Way of freckles that Ron and Ginny have. No. They are proper tiny dots, some bigger than others, perfectly round and distinct.
“I’m serious,” he says, taking another sip. Maybe, if they explored it together, Draco’s anxiety would go down, they would have a few nice new experiences, he would calm down, they would go back to normal and see how it goes. “But I think we should be discreet and try to avoid the press if possible. Just do it together as you proposed. Maybe have some ground rules...”
,” he says. “So I hear you, and it takes me back to that day, takes me back to when I hated myself and my actions so much that I wished I was dead.”
“Good luck with that,” he laughs as she opens the door. “Pansy,” the woman looks back from the unlit hall. “Thank you.”
“Well, Theodore, I wouldn’t mind showing you,” Blaise plays along, voice smooth and velvety and Draco cackles, seeing Theo finally flush at the offer. “It’s when someone kisses and licks your arse, Theo. Quite enjoyable, if you wanna know my humble opinion.”
He couldn’t get over the warm feeling that blossomed inside his chest everytime.
“You don’t need to explain, Harry,” Remus holds his hand tighter. “Would you like to sleep now?”
“So I met his friends and we talked, and they said Draco has some pretty valid reasons. And they were really worried that this was going to break him, and Draco is depressed so I now worry too, because what if this is what does the trick and he—he—
And Draco shivers, hands grasping at the back of Remus’s woollen cardigan. He’s half-sobbing, half-laughing at the same time, feeling how ridiculously insane this situation is: that the man who gave him hope is Harry's godfather and that he is deeply concerned for their well-being. But also that Remus is here: opening his arms to welcome Draco into their very non-traditional queer family.
It all feels alien, like something that happened to someone else, not him. Harry shrugs.
“Harry...” Sirius' voice sounds deeper and Harry looks up. Sirius reaches over the tabletop, taking his godson's fingers in hand. “I haven't seen you like this in a while. I know that this past month has been very difficult, with Remus in hospital and you coming back home. I was terrified of him not recovering this time around, too.”
’ and crying, and I-I asked him to wait, but he didn’t—” he gasps around the words, emotions boiling inside of him with a sour taste in the back of his mouth.
Harry laughs, shaking his head, seeing how tense Draco looks waiting for an answer.
“What is rimming?” Theo asks, curious.
“Yes, we are real,” Draco keeps repeating, like a mantra, like a prayer, a promise against Harry’s open mouth.
“The last thing Draco is is self-confident, you know that by now.”
Draco’s blush grows brighter and Harry wants to touch it, but he doesn’t. He just watches.
So when Harry watches Draco on that sunny morning, sitting on the threadbare rug in the drawing room of Grimmauld Place, with his naked legs and a steaming cup of coffee in hands, Harry wants to keep him.
He would always find Draco sitting on the countertop of the kitchen in their townhouse, the one they chose together and bought together. Draco would be holding a cup of tea, or waiting for the kettle to boil, a book flipping pages, floating in front of him. His grey eyes transfixed on something that spiked his curiosity and made him sleepless.
“I just-” his voice broke.
When Remus looks up, there are tears trickling down his cheeks; he looks bitter and mad. His sad hazel eyes look straight at Draco’s grey ones, almost as if he could see his soul.
Harry kisses him, trying to voice his needs with his tongue against Draco’s lips. It starts soft and sweet, but there’s an urgent need to it, and suddenly the kiss turns messy and delirious, wet and hot— feverish as last night, but even more.
in which the boys go naughty ;9
“Don´t worry,” Harry says quietly, pulling away. “It was a long day. I really need a shower.”
What was his name again? Something Irish, something like Oisin, or Eoin, or Eammon. He doesn’t care. The guy was nice enough, easy going, long brownish hair in a bun, big blue eyes, a bit of a belly with really strong arms and legs and a damn fine arse.
But it feels just like this.
And Draco breaks down.
But it shook them to the core. The almost-there feeling of loss, of death looming over them like a dark, heavy cloud. And Harry felt so lost, so out of balance, so upset.
for the first time.
They move around each other falling in an old known synchrony. They get dry and go back to their room.
“No, it wasn’t a date,” Harry shakes his head. His hair is still damp but he changed into his pyjamas once he arrived home, feeling too cold to handle the feelings in wet clothes. “He—he was in the club.”
And he needs to live.
And he is, so goddamn tired. He doesn’t even know what time it is.
“You know how much it means to us that you are here, right? I know that, at some point, you will want to go back to your flat, but you can stay here as long as you want. Moony feels more at ease having you around...”
Warmth embraces him as he closes the door on his back and sighs, thankful.
People laugh and clap, cheering him on and he feels high and his chest is so full that if his life ended right now, he wouldn’t mind at all, because he has a love story going on for himself.
“Take your time, Cissy,” he listens to himself saying. Feeling like she doesn’t deserve the kindness, not after everything, but knowing how hard it can be and feeling like she needs it. “It’s not easy to digest.”
His godparents’ love for books and stories drove Harry to studying Literature. He always thought he would end up at some school, teaching teenagers about Byron and Wilde and Joyce and Austen. But even though he enjoyed literature, he much preferred his slow, everyday life in the lovely company of Sirius and Remus.

“I didn’t know that, Theo.”
“I was afraid of opening my eyes,” Harry says and Draco turns around in the bed to look at him, at his bright green eyes, still sleepy and blinking slowly against the cold light that enters the room.
Narcissa looks at him fiercely.
’ and ‘
Maybe that’s what friendship really is: being happy or sad when your friends are happy or sad. Draco’s chest warms at the thought.
“What? It’s true, because my wonderful cousin Bella caught beefy Arpàyd Krum and me going at it in the guest room.”
“Harry,” there’s such softness in Draco’s voice that Harry’s shoulders relax, like coming home, like giving in and stopping fighting. The blond stretches his arm over the wooden table top and holds Harry’s hand. “I would never leave you for anyone else,” his voice is kind, his grey eyes are soft and there’s this small, beautiful smile on his lips, though a bit sad; “I love you.”
“I just had the greatest talk with a long-lost cousin, who happens to be your mum, kid.” He barks a weird, wild laugh, looking at Draco dead in the eye. His long black hair, peppered with grey, blows dramatically with the wind. “I’m Sirius Black, Draco, and it's a huge pleasure to meet you.”
How his long fingers braid small yellow and white flowers into Luna’s long, messy hair. How he does it slowly and methodically, entwining blonde strands of hair with thin green stems of flowers, creating intricate patterns with dedication and calm, his back turned to Harry.
Once Harry accepts the tempestuous turmoil of feelings inside his chest every time he sees Draco, the warmth and kindness of those feelings become something delightful and familiar. Not quite like the initial butterflies and winds, not as intense as the rainforest storm, but something like the comes and goes of the waves on a sunny beach. Lapping at his chest in a constant rhythm.
prompt: ocean/sea/waves (it was a beach, but who cares?)
Draco has been a bit restless the last few weeks, and Harry is trying to prepare himself for the worst, but he really does not want things to go there. He wishes he could have the same curiosities his husband has.
“That’s alright, kid,” he watches Draco’s face in an earnest way. “Are you going to be okay?”
:) hi, I'm so happy with this. omg, I'm emotional! hope you guys enjoyed!
“I don’t want to have sex everytime you do,” he starts, closing his eyes and taking a long breath. This is not news to Draco, he’s sure. “Some things you want to explore make me uneasy and disgusted at myself.” This is also not news.
It’s Draco, Draco, Draco. Her name echoes back in his mind as Harry curses and presses a hand against his eyes and his long, untamed curls. His legs are tangled in the sheets and blankets, and around him the room looks a mess. Of course– it’s Draco’s room in the shady block between Knockturn and Diagon Alley. It smells mouldy even though he knows Draco always refreshes the spells. Its a fucking shithole, that’s what it is, but Draco lost friends along the way, and she hates living off others, and couldn’t accept a room in Grimmauld Place.
“It’s scary,” Draco admits. “I dunno if I’ll be able to enjoy sex while I’m thinking the condom will break.”
Harry looks down, feeling poorly. He sourly thinks that at least someone enjoyed their night.
His hands are clammy, his heart is beating hard. He is afraid of Draco saying the “
Her voice cracks a bit and she fusses with the napkin.
into you, didn’t you realise?”
He sounds childish to his own ears. He hates it. He hates the way his own voice rings in the kitchen and the way Draco is looking at him from the other side of the table, as if he were a little boy. Sharp eyes and a probable scold on the tip of his posh quick tongue.
And then Hugh, and Mark, and Susan.
He can’t control life, he can’t control feelings.
“I’ve never thought about it,” he concedes. “Most of what I write comes from my own experiences and emotions, but I’ve done a few journalistic reports before. It would be an interesting project.”
” catch phrase again. But Draco and the Austrian guy are nowhere to be seen.
This is so embarrassing.
*go sip your tea now, see you all tomorrow!*
Also, I have NO WORDS to thank everyone commenting and cheering me up with this story. You guys are bloody amazing. I got really nice feedback on the sirem/wolfstar bit and people asking for prequels! I would love to write more about them in this universe or even add extra wolfstar scenes in a side fic, after finishing writing Dragons. So if you would like that, subscribe to this fic and to my dashboard and I'll let you know when I create a collection for new Dragons's universe fics with wolfstar delight.
“You are very welcome.”
And numb. Definitely numb.
Sirius is standing by the door, his arms crossed lazily over his chest, wearing striped pyjama pants and a faded Queen T-shirt, his tousled hair falling over his shoulder, grey strands blending into the thick, smooth black mass.
And now Harry is also mad. Because he is neither stupid nor blind.
He reminds himself every time.
“Did you get to see him, then?” Remus asks gently.
I’ve never said we wouldn’t have a glimpse at their second time, though, have I? *winks*
He would be fucking lonely.
Draco had his own ways of making Harry be more malleable. And Harry was becoming very aware of it.
“I am sorry,” he mutters.
“Look, I haven’t been feeling very sexual. We both know that. I know you are bored of our sex life an-”
“No, he was with another friend.”
“You sound
, Harry missed this. He just needs to stop overthinking, to let it go. To feel. To allow himself...
The thing about change is that you never see it coming until it’s here, established.
“I don’t know how I will feel,if I will deal with it well or not. I fear you falling for someone else and leaving me, but honestly,” Harry sighs. “I am also curious. It could go well, right? If we do things together?”
The club smells like men’s sweat and alcohol.
“I felt stupid, almost like I deserved it, for wanting this sinful desire. I felt like, for what?” he says, shaking his head. “For a bit of pleasure and to quell a years-long curiosity that I couldn’t keep down anymore? It felt meaningless, and after I got the result, it felt like a curse, that I should learn from it, that I did not deserve good things. Or anything that I wanted deeply.”
“Welcome to the family, Draco,”  he says, bringing Draco to a fierce warm hug.
Change is like this, like spring unfolding gently after a freezing winter. Every day slightly moving the weather into more pleasant temperatures, into longer seconds and then minutes of daylight. Suddenly, without you realising it, the blossoming flowers and colours take you by surprise: they are there for good, for months, until the surroundings change once again, slowly, into too hot breezes and days so long you never know what time it is.
Hermione stares at him, clicking her tongue.
“SIRIUS!” Remus yelps. Harry gasps and Sirius laughs.
prompt: cold night
, Har-”
Would love to hear your thoughts! love, tai.
Moony puts three steaming mugs of tea on top of the table and steps closer to Harry, running his hand in big calming circles over his back. Harry trembles and shivers and takes deep, shaky breaths. Padfoot only nods at him, holding his hands and eyes with a serious expression.
“Yeah... I think I was starting to fall for him.”
“The fucking will need to wait, Harry. The doctor ordered Remus ‘absolute rest’, remember?” He waggles his eyebrows provocatively.
“You sound very excited,” Harry laughs, watching Draco take a swig straight from the bottle. “Oh gods, you’re even overlooking your manners!”
There’s a throbbing in his head and he feels queasy. But it’s too bright inside and he blinks against the light. “
“They were a gift,” he says, shrugging. “Come along, pup, you are in for a treat as you’re going to meet the most beautiful man alive,” Remus says proudly and Draco laughs.
“I asked him if he would like to meet the other day, but he said he can’t again. We've been talking for almost a month, so... I don't know, Sirius, he's obviously not as interested as I am.”
Alive, alive, oh so alive and Harry smiles at his back.
“Draco?” Harry murmurs as he approaches him. “You alright?”
“Draco Malfoy,” he says, with an out-of-place proud smile on his face and Draco feels he missed something, the bit in which they are introduced to each other. “You’re Harry’s boyfriend,” he continues and Remus sputters beside Draco, also confused.
“You really should stop baking, Moony,” Sirius says, staring at the cake.
this really small chapter contains a scene of deep angst & blond nudity. (check the tags if you need it)
“Yes,” he says, memories messy and blurry with emotions and the rain and the cold that comes from both outside and inside his body. “He’s white—I mean, he is not black,” he shakes his head, confused with his own words. “He’s blond, and looked pale, very thin... I-I don’t know, I didn’t see him close enough. It’s just—like a glimpse. Not enough. I don’t know how to explain.”
the real reason Harry is moving back for good,” Sirius says smartly. “Because I am wonderful and he cannot live without me!”
Harry is looking intently at the screen. It’s Friday night and he is so pleased Draco is online—he doesn’t want to miss a beat of their conversation.
Harry stumbles in the hallway and Draco laughs, manic, delighted, high. And Harry laughs with her, her, her. He holds Draco’s hand and stares at her lovely face, the messy makeup, the sweaty brow, the long blonde hair sticking to the sides of her face.
He can’t stop looking at Draco and how engaged he is in the conversation, how he nods and Harry can make out the straight line of his jaw, his pointy chin, the fair stubble...
“Look, I just don’t feel comfortable with that,” he explains.
His resolution is faltering in a mix of bless and doubt, he thinks he better enjoy the fact that he is enjoying it.
His hands are shaking slightly and he feels like crying all over again. So he takes a long shower, puts on some warm clothes and sits in front of his computer. Turning it on with shaky fingers.
Sirius snorts gently into his tea.
“That’s good,” Sirius says reassuringly. “You don’t need to worry too much, then, he’s with friends.”
“Lovely!” Sirius smiles openly. “I don’t miss cousin Bellatrix one bit,” he says.
do yourself a favour and have a tea with it!
” Harry shivers once, twice- “
Hope for the future.
But it’s Draco’s eyes that take Harry’s breath away. They are clear grey, very similar to Sirius’s eyes. They look piercingly at the camera, and his gaze pins Harry down to his chair. These eyes can see him, as if Draco is seeing through to his soul.
, well, at least we can try. And if it doesn’t work, we stop.”
And exhaustion engulfs him into sleep.
“I press the issue?” he growls. “I cannot fucking believe you, Potter!” His voice echoes, irritated in their living room.
And Draco’s chest is full with a lovely kind of happiness.
He has no idea if they can mend things. If they will manage to put their pieces back together. He wants to believe they can, but he doesn’t know.
Remus is more concerned about his son’s feelings. About him dealing with the always-present concern and the emotional rollercoaster that comes with living with HIV and AIDS. And Draco asks himself if he’s doing something wrong in getting together with Harry and exposing him to not only the possibility of something going wrong with condoms, but also exposing him to Draco’s emotional ups and downs.
And it’s delicious and terrifying and marvelous and arousing. Draco presses open-mouthed kisses over his hole, stretching Harry’s arse cheeks with his hands and sucking on the coarse skin of his heavy balls.
Sirius grunts.
Harry envies him. Envies what Remus and Sirius have, this kind of love that only grows fonder and mixes up their personalities. Makes their lives so very intertwined that neither is able to say where one starts and the other ends. Like a matching set that cannot go mismatched.
And then it all clicks into place, as if turning a switch inside his mind, a light turning on in his brain. His mouth forms a stupid
“What?”
“But Padfoot is stubborn as all hell, and Harry will be the same, I’m sure of it.” He laughs. “They have this kind of loyalty that is not easily found, you know... So—” he takes another deep breath “—you will need to learn how to be honest, brutally honest with Harry. About your fears and your feelings. And that’s the tricky part of any relationship, to share and communicate, because this is the only way to go about it, HIV-positive or not, see.”
Draco sits at his Friday therapy group and listens intently as Remus talks about his worries; apparently his son is dating someone HIV-positive and it’s making him feel scared, so scared.
There’s a discomfort inside his chest that Harry cannot exactly pinpoint. The pit of his stomach feels acidic and scratchy and a painful headache is starting in the back of his skull.
Remus has been hospitalised for two weeks due to pneumonia. Sirius had been sleepless for days on end, pacing in the living room until dawn so he could go back to the hospital. Harry had decided to return to his godparents’ house to help Sirius control his anxiety and keep everything in order for when Remus returned.
“I was angry at him because I was in love with him,” Remus says, and there’s a sad silence. “I thought:
He feels like death warmed over.
He has followed her since that night three years ago, when it was dark, dark, dark, the only light was coming from the immense sky and the stars and moon and space bodies. When Draco mumbled, “She, she, she.” And Harry felt lost, lost, lost looking at her eyes and seeing her, her,
in which, Draco needs a hug.
A sob escapes through his lips. He feels so much pain. His shoulders shake and the tears sting and his whole body feels broken.
She came to last week's Family and Friends meeting with his mum, because she wanted to know more about the centre and even volunteered to help in their next free rapid STI, HIV and Hepatitis C tests next month.
Draco stirred in his chair, resting his cup of coffee on top of the table.
But Harry doesn't answer, he’s going to cry if he tries.
“Thank you,” she mutters. “I’ve read a lot and I keep feeling I know nothing. I want to be there for him, Sirius. I don’t want him to feel like he is alone. It took him five months to tell me. It was the first time he brought up his homosexuality, actually, as if I wouldn’t have noticed.”
“Yeah...” Harry murmurs, not wanting to worry Sirius or talk too much and let the strange sensation in his voice show.
oh, they're so very close now...
“We deserve it, right?” Draco asks firmly, feeling the tears blur his vision. Because he wants to believe it, that they all deserve it. “We deserve to live and love and I hope I can live this a little longer.”
And Harry decides he wants to touch that one. With the tip of his tongue. He wants to taste the flavour of Draco’s skin. He wants him.
Harry just sighed lightly and excused himself telling them to enjoy it.
“Don’t you know already?” Harry asks.
“Potter...”
It’s dark, dark, dark. It echoes around him and inside him and he feels small, small, small.
I'm soaring. Got so drunk on prosecco after I finished writing lol. I hope you guys enjoyed this story!
“I don’t want to lose you,” Draco whispers, sounding scared. “I’m so sorry.”
His blood rushes inside his veins.
Maybe someday.
Also, some good news for those who feel curious about Sirius x Remus story: I'm definitely going to write about them after Dragons is finished, I have a fic title and all, so that's that! :)
He can still remember when he first moved in with his godparents after the red tape with the Dursleys worked out and at 5 years old, Harry finally got to live with his parents’ chosen guardians after the car crash. No cupboard anymore—he had a playroom and his own bedroom and he would spend the afternoons with Moony in the bookshop while Sirius worked 10 hours a day in the motorbike shop so they could keep up at the end of the month.
The kiss intensifies. Harry puts all his anger into it and Draco meets him in intensity. But Harry isn’t feeling it anymore. He feels stupid and impotent in the face of not being able to give his husband what he is asking for.
Harry looks at him, and he
So they move, chasing the feeling and the desire, thrusting and holding and gasping. Draco’s hand manoeuvres Harry up, bringing him to a sitting position, hands on the headboard and head falling back against Draco’s shoulder, his sweaty back against Draco’s chest, moaning as Draco’s cock goes deeper inside him.
It’s so incredibly hopeful to see how these two men are so utterly in love with each other even after all these years.
real—” he sobs, pressing back against the slow thrusts of Draco’s cock deep inside him, one hand going up and grabbing Draco’s hair, bringing their lips close. “We are real.
“A few days later, he came back. And then, I wasn’t angry anymore. I was devastated and starting to accept that that was it, that I would probably die.” He laughs, licking his lips and rubbing the palms of his hands together. “But then, the little shit took my face in his hands, crying, and told me he loved me, that he didn’t want me to die because he selfishly wanted time to love me properly.”
Draco never mentioned Harry’s name in therapy. They all avoid saying people’s names.
“Shut up!” Draco flushes.
“What’s wrong?” He turns on the light, his hazel eyes looking around quickly.
He steps quietly through the halls of their house to find Draco perched on the countertop of the kitchen, a hot cuppa in his hands. There’s no book this time and Draco’s eyes are staring at the wooden floor at a loss.
“We do, Draco.” Remus says, his own voice full of emotion. And he laughs again, a bit wildly and deep. “You deserve this and I am sure Harry will be there for you.”
“Yeah...”
He cleans himself while waiting for Draco to reply. It was taking a while, so Harry moves around the room and puts on a clean pair of pyjamas and an old fluffy sweater. On his way, he ends up knocking off the miniature pine plant pot from the windowsill. It clashes loudly against the floor, dirt and porcelain scattering everywhere.
prompt:  xmas lights and ornaments
“I’m so deep inside you now, Harry,” he whispers hotly against the shell of Harry’s ear, heart bursting with meaning and emotion and pleasure. “This is real, do you feel it? Do you feel me?”
It’s cheesy and effortless.
“Are you sure?” Draco doesn’t seem convinced.
?” Draco asks dumbfounded.
It pings again.
Is he online?
The thing about love is that love is unsettling. It can start quietly and gently. It can turn into something so massive that sometimes one can’t even breathe with the weight of it. It can crash in violent waves inside one’s chest and sometimes it hurts.
“Fuck,” Harry squirms.
They have been trying it out for a few months now. And everytime Harry feels a mix of regret and excitement and jealousy to see Draco entertained by other men.
prompt: plants (it was mistletoe. honestly yall, at this point I'm making do the way I can xD)
He knows it’s weird. To meet people online, to prefer to spend his time in front of a screen than to go out with his friends. Ginny and Ron have been messing with him about it as he stopped going to the pub on Fridays night to spend his time talking to Draco.
“I feel...”
Harry watches and surrenders at the face of love.
Harry is playing a board game with some teenagers at a corner table and stuffing his face with cinnamon rolls. He smiles at Draco.
And there he is.
like a Draco.
They say their farewells to everyone and Remus puts on some rather bizarre woollen gloves; they look like small hedgehogs and are ugly as fuck. Draco stares and Remus laughs loudly.
*winks*
“I stink,” Harry laughs, unconvinced, a bit bothered by the quick approach.
He has been trying to subtly convince Draco that they should meet. But Draco is a sneaky bastard that always finds a way of saying no without actually saying no.
Sirius laughs softly, and stares at the empty doorway—with teary eyes and his heart full—for a long while after Harry closes the door to his room, he has a wonderful family and Harry deserves all the happiness in the world.
“I don’t want you to do this if you’re not comfortable,” he finally says.
“Harry, I will kill this boy myself,” he starts, voice cold and sharp, fingers digging into Harry’s shoulders. “What exactly happened, pup?”
Because
“About what?” he retorts bitterly, a perfect eyebrow going up, his fork playing with the food. He is in a foul mood, and Harry is always trying to make it better.
I wrote this sex scene three times. I tried to make it detailed and hot, but it wasn’t right. I wrote Harry topping, then Draco topping, then delicious rimming. But honestly, it didn’t feel right. So I sat on the porch with my husband, drinking a cold beer and feeling terrible about my writing skills and life in general, and he asked me if I was writing the scene for me and the readers or for the characters in this story. And it clicked, it clicked that this very intimate first time is not ours, darlings. This first time is theirs and unfortunately we can’t pry into the secrecy and intimacy of Harry and Draco making love to each other for the first time. It’s not ours to know or see who tops and who bottoms, or how it goes, how they make out and how the foreplay goes or how they go about specifics. So I hope you don’t mind that the sex scene is not outright explicit, but I hope you feel how it goes on the feelings department. It’s soft, and tender, like surrendering, like giving in gently. Happy Christmas once again. I hope you enjoyed it!
Draco.”

“So you met the friend?” Sirius asks, trying to understand.
Maybe it was after their holiday trip to Tuscany with Blaise and Pansy last summer, when they talked about the massive adventures of their open relationship.
“We could check out a group support, it might help,” Theo mentions before he left.
“I’ll take care of you, now,” Draco whispers, dropping his kisses lower, against the round, meaty globes of Harry's arsecheeks; softly, gently, breathing his scent in.
Draco is like a stretched violin string ready to burst.
But Draco can’t.
prompt: a hot drink
“Fuck off.”
Draco knows well that acceptance is a process, and just as with any other journey, he will have ups and downs.
Harry just wants to get lost in the beat, in the heat of stranger’s bodies bumping into him as they dance. He wants to stop overthinking. He wants to stop feeling this much.
He takes his feet from Sirius’s lap and informs him he is going to be in his room. He reassures his godfather that,
“Hmm,” Draco hums.
“Can you get to the point, Cissy?” he asks, carding his fingers through his long hair and pulling a strand behind his ear. He feels out of sorts. He feels tense and gloomy and he wants it to end.
Harry smirks.
So the word makes him furious.
“I would love that, Albus.”
It had been years since Remus had looked that bad. His health has always been controlled, taking his meds and following a balanced diet, doing exercises, keeping exams up to date.
“Shh, turn around, Harry,” he commands.
“What is his name?” he asks.
Harry groans and turns right.
Something huge, beautiful, real.
Sirius rolls his eyes dramatically and eats his cake making a face.
,” Remus reproaches and Harry laughs.
Remus shrugs.
I promised Lis it wouldn't take long, so here it is.
This is fucking crazy.
But to think back, to when he met Harry online, when he was in the depths of his depression, when he thought he prefered being dead to feeling so empty and hollow and so full of pain and grief, not knowing how to deal with his virus... and to reflect on how now he is so full of life and hope.
YES this is me indulging in Wolfstar gaydads being gooddads, of course, light of my life, fire on my loins, sending you happy christmas with a bit of family joy!
“Yeah, I heard about that.” Remus smiles brightly and knowingly. “We just didn’t know then that you were
Harry nods.
“It’s hard for me to see you with other people, even when I’m there, I just feel like I don’t fit in.”
So Harry goes, goes, goes. He always goes after her.
“It’s okay,” Draco starts. “You care for him. I get it.”
They all laugh, a bit hysterically, a bit euphoric, a bit high on hope.
“We will see about that, pup,” Moony winks. “I just worry about you, Harry. And you deserve some fun, that’s all.” He affectionately caresses Harry’s shoulder. "Have fun tonight," he watches Harry with a warm smile on his face, says his goodbyes and then runs out of the car.
“Is he getting support? Medical, psychological?”
Harry’s breath hitches. Draco didn’t even notice his absence, he didn’t even go check if Harry was okay, and he’s pretty sure he spent more than 15 minutes to calm down.
“And I thought I would be the one giving you a nice surprise by introducing you to Draco,” Remus says, shaking his head and touching Draco’s shoulder. “You always steal the scene, Padfoot.”
The music is melodic in the background and people are chatting happily around him, the lights are a bit dim, candles are lit. Dean organised his birthday celebration well, and the decorations are very nice.
It takes a while for the reply to come back, so he grabs the roll of toilet paper by his bedside and goes back to his chair.
“That was very honest,” Rolf says. His eyes are a bit wet as he looks warmly at Draco, and now Draco can see that many others are nodding or drying their eyes or blowing their noses. “Would anyone like to share their feelings about it?” He looks around.
prompt:  woolen socks
“What? I don’t know what it is,” he explains, rolling a joint and shrugging.
His foot is bleeding quite a lot over the pale blue duvet and he can’t see his slippers around. There are a lot of porcelain shards on the floor, and the pain is getting worse. He can see the blood pooling around his foot and soiling his bed. It looks black under the bluish light from the computer screen.
“Don’t say shit you don’t mean,” Draco replies sharply, and her voice is so full of emotion that Harry thinks maybe, maybe, maybe.
“Thanks.”
The Austrian man is staring at Harry and lighting a lumos with the tip of his wand. He seems confused and out of sorts.
It’s been more than two weeks since the graveyard visit, but somehow he is still holding the smallest grudge against Sirius. Also, Draco has been terribly quiet, and last night when they finally met online, he wasn’t only closed off, but he also declined Harry’s attempt at cybersex.
“Fuck off, Potter,” Draco is considering him with sharp eyes.
Draco nods with a weak smile, lighting a fag and breathing deeply.
“So you did know!”
It’s a scene to behold. A sight to be cherished.
He scribbles it in the notebook; then he puts down pen and paper, lets out a shaky breath and lies down, closing his eyes. Allows his mind to quiet down.
The comfort bit finally arrives to this blasted story. Y'all. I'm so glad I'm weeping ;_;  love, tai :3
“I still find this generation very strange. How do you fall in love with someone you don't even know?”
“Shh, it's okay now, Harry,” Sirius shushes him.
“Dammit,” he mutters, feeling his eyes sting with pain but trying to be calm. “REMUS!” he calls out. “C’mon,” he starts feeling dizzy, he hates blood so much. He looks up, blinking the tears away staring at the ceiling. “SIRIUS!”
The snow is falling heavily outside when they wake up, groggy and sluggish, slow with the warmth underneath the blankets and duvet. Draco luxuriates in stretching his long lean body and Harry moves like a needy puppy, touching him, nuzzling him and kissing his back sweetly.
The wind and drizzle starts to shake his new headache away. It’s becoming an everyday thing. Too much work, and now the stress at home with the constant feeling owing Draco sex in intense amounts that he can’t actually keep up with, at least not lately.
“Draco!
His bloody fault, because he keeps lying to Harry like a bloody online creep. He tried to keep his distance over the last few weeks, and he is working the hardest he can to gather enough courage to tell him the truth. Draco is trying to accept the possibility of Harry rejecting him, but it is hard.
Blaise spent brunch making stupid jokes about it, like it’s some kind of big joke, like the universe is taking the piss. But his dark eyes shine with something sweet, something that kept making Draco smile broadly at him.
“It is bloody unfair!” he says, his shaky hands gesticulating grandly. “I was no saint, that’s for sure, I had my good share of messy sex with many strangers, but why me? What have I done so wrong? Why not my best friend who was even more of a whore than I was?” he gasps, broken. “I didn’t mean it like that, I am sorry,” he adds quickly, feeling ashamed.
“I know, kid, I know.”
poor harry. I am sorry, folks.
“Yes,” Draco feels himself blushing. “Sorry about that, Albus.”
. And it was pronounced like Owen. Trust Draco to be so engaged he would know the guy’s name.
“Should I point out that you should get laid?” Remus asks looking out of the window. “I feel like that’s something Padfoot would say right now.”
Moony laughs, muttering to himself that maybe he
” He closes his eyes as if watching the scene on repeat on the screen in his mind. “I shouted at him, told him to leave, that I needed to be alone.”
“Don’t be nosy,” he mutters, turning the mug in his hands. “Yes... just a few...” Harry rubs his hands over his flushed face. “He is... Mysterious, attentive... I thought it could work.”
Harry makes himself a cup of tea and sits by Draco’s side over the countertop, legs hanging in the air.
Draco goes back to his chat with Mr. Kolontai, speaking fast, talking about specificities of the artwork of the 19th century, asking about one art piece or another, about possible censorship and minimum age requirements. Harry figures some pieces are very explicit.
“The first person I told was my best friend and he cried. He got so sad and he cried so much and I was so bloody angry. At him, at me, at my life, at fucking AIDS, at gay sex...”
“I’m fine,” Harry offers.
*quote from Ernest Hemingway <3
Sirius takes Harry’s face in his hands.
“Well, Harry, you’ve been together for what? Six years?”
Even Pansy is here.
And faint he does.
“That bad, eh?” the man replies, and smiles gently at him. “Pretty sure you will live long enough to be as eccentric and bold as good old Albus,” he cracks a teasing smirk.
Folks, you are killing me with love! Thank you for the comments! I hope you enjoy this one!
They sit in tense silence and Sirius sighs.
And they smile at each other.
“You know we love you very much, don't you, Prongslet?” Sirius’ voice sounds slightly choked as he places a kiss on Harry's forearm and squeezes him once more before letting go of Harry's embrace and composing himself, sniffing.
It means a lot to me, honestly. Haven’t written so much and steady for YEARS. Since 2011, if I’m not wrong. Thank you to all of you who are reading and commenting and giving me kudos and love.
Draco laughs, and it sounds a bit hysterical and Harry
“Fuck, Potter,” she says, and takes a deep breath, smiling still, looking bright and messy and gorgeous. And Draco hugs him, hard and clumsy and it's perfect, lovely, really, it’s all Harry ever wanted. “Harry, Harry, Harry...” she whispers against his neck, nose against the curve of his jaw, inhaling his sweaty scent and Harry laughs.
“I’m so full,” Harry gasps, his mouth chasing Draco’s and they kiss, messy and hot, all tongue and saliva.
He seems at ease and distracted, and Draco can’t quite control himself as he walks straight up to this man, this stranger, that somehow now Draco knows too much about.
He feels small, and childish and ridiculous.
“Happy Christmas, Draco. But please, call me Albus.”
“Oh well,” Moony says. “This is the worst cake ever,” he admits and they all laugh at it. He pouts at the cake and looks from Harry to Sirius. “Your godfather is meeting a long-lost cousin next week,” he finally says.
They cackle like teenagers, as if happiness is something contagious and the fact that Draco is happy makes them happy as well.
, Draco and Harry had breakfast. Draco was over the moon, speaking fast, gesticulating, a glint of happiness in his eyes.
surprise!”
It’s decided. And Sirius is stubborn as all hell. He can already see her, with a high-quality glittery rainbow t-shirt. It’s going to be the best revenge. And Sirius’s bigoted father will turn and scream in his ugly posh grave.
“I said I’m sorry. I saw you at the table all flirty and then-”
Harry has a bite.
“Like you could eat me alive,” she smirks, and she knows him all too well, because Harry would die to eat her alive.
“Why are you acting like that?” Harry presses, losing his patience. “You’ve been a right tit all week long.”
“I would like to talk if that's okay, Rolf.”
Draco realises that Remus’s son is Harry, and the HIV-positive person his son is dating is Draco himself.
“WHAT?”
And now we start the second week of advent. I hope you all are well and safe <3
. He had his fair bit of exploration in the first few years after the war. He had different partners and tried different things.
Yes, it was definitely after that.
“Too right, pup, not her and not anyone else since that awful summer in which my father so nicely kicked me out for sucking cock!”
“Must you do this right now? I am
Sirius laughs, taking a sip of tea, and pouring more milk into the mug.
“I think you’re thinking too much, Harry.”
Draco’s acceptance feels like a warm embrace; an embrace he wants to be able to physically feel.
“It’s been 26 years now,” Remus says. “He never tested positive. We are still very careful. He is always taking care of me, fussing about my meds and my diet and my exercises and the way I make tea...”
“Who is enough?” she gestures perplexed. “No one is completely satisfied with their lives, everyone is holding on to vices and activities that will make them stop feeling unsatisfied. Some fuck, others work, or use drugs, make money, exercise, or pop kids out for god’s sake.” She takes a long drag on her cigarette. “But he loves you. He always has.”
Harry nods.
He shrugs.
Sirius had always been the cheerful one, the first to crack a joke in a tense situation, the first to look on the bright side. Seeing him so low this past few weeks made Harry realise they are all very vulnerable. Existence is fragile and no one is ever ready to manage such drastic life changes.
Remus is looking at him, concerned. Still thin and frail from the hospital, but much less pale. His shaggy brown hair is peppered up with quite a lot of white here and there.
Draco laughs and nods.
“I know, Pads...” There’s a sad smile on Harry’s lips. “Thank God everything went well...” he sighs, squeezing his godfather's fingers tightly.
Harry hears the kettle and Remus’s soft steps around the kitchen.
Draco grins and winks at him. He has been supervising the installation of said exhibition the whole day.
It opens and maximises on the screen of his computer.
The knocking on the door startles him.
Sirius doesn't like revisiting his past. It's like poking on a tender wound that never healed quite properly. He shuffles uncomfortably at his seat as Narcissa sits primly on the posh armchair of the tea house.
Right?
But now Remus was back home and Sirius had returned to work. Things were slowly getting back on track. Harry just wanted something good to come out of the whole ordeal, and Draco seemed to be the best thing about it.
“I really don’t like this, Draco,” he rasps.
“I’m sorry, Sirius.”
Harry finishes his coffee and smiles at the newly organised showcase. There is this new book series about a boy becoming friends with a dragon, and the cover art depicts a lot of iridescent figures of dragons flying by the mountainside. It is beautiful.
Maybe then Draco started wondering.
But above all, he hopes Draco wants to stay.
She grins, pats her hair and straightens her shoulders, taking her leave.
“Saw the friend, and approached him thinking he was Draco, then he realised and told me he is not Draco, and that Draco had just left after seeing me. So I rushed outside after him, and he was getting into a fucking cab and saying ‘
“Yes,” Remus laughs, shoulders shaking with the mad force of it, nodding. “I’m Moony, Draco.”
He licks his lip.
He looks wonderful. Like the bad boy of an old ‘80s film.
“It’s not that I don’t want to. I’m just scared.”
It feels like once he lets his anger surface, it comes in wave after terrifying wave of pure, breathtaking, blinding rage. Even his voice is disgusting and cold. Sharp as a dagger's edge. Ready to hurt and maim.
“He will know how to go about it,” Remus says kindly and pats Draco’s shoulder. “If you need, he will know how to teach you and lead you through all the protection measures.” He adds, starting to stand up. “Now, I apologise for this rather uncomfortable talk,” he laughs, entertained.
“Well, if you don’t mind...”
Harry knew the feeling. He knew what it meant. He never expected to feel it towards Malfoy, though. Not like this, not this strong. He wanted to fight it, to throw it off like he did an Imperius curse.
Slowly, he figures that he wasn’t really alone. That the loneliness in his head and heart are part of the fear of losing the people he loved.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are you and Ron planning on opening the relationship by any chance?” he asks back.
Last night, Harry kept chatting to him and hinting that they could—
“That was before, okay?” Harry lets out. “And I feel safer here, that’s all. At least until I’m sure Moony is all well and safe and healthy,” he shrugs and sticks a tongue at Sirius.
He isn’t sure. But Draco is offline in the chat box. But there is an email from him.
“Hello, Mr. Potter, nice meeting you,” greets the man from the other side of the floo with a thick Russian accent. He looks sharp, in smart clothing and dark hair slicked back, a charming smile on his lips.
His head was providing, over and over again, images of the way Draco’s fingers paused in the tender skin under his earlobe, their wedding ring shining golden, and the Austrian guy licking his lips.
Known that the string would burst, that things would go spiraling in a very bad way.
He feels high with sensation and feelings. Because they are real.
Outside, it’s fairly cold and there is Padfoot: arms crossed tight over his chest with a fierce expression. But before Remus and Draco can say anything, the man walks straight up to them and smiles brightly and grandly at Draco, putting his hands on both Draco’s shoulders.
Sirius' voice floods the kitchen and Harry looks up, his fingers holding a big cuppa, feeling the warmth on his palm and the pleasant aroma of Assam—a smell so typical of that house, that kitchen, the home where he was raised. There is something very welcoming about the pale yellow walls and light coloured wooden furniture and the not-so-organised organisation of the kitchen.
Harry is stunned into silence.
“I don’t understand why you’re still with me if I’m obviously not enough for you...” he said honestly.
He puts extra effort to make it good, though. He makes it dirty and harsh, because he feels harsh and pissed off. He wants to make Draco come as fast as possible and be done with this. And when Draco spills in the back of his throat, moaning and shaking under Harry’s hands and mouth, Harry spits spunk over the kitchen floor with disgust, completely out of character, and stands up in a hurry.
“Thanks, Theodore,” he mutters, once he feels he can trust his voice again.
“Yes...”
“I saw him tonight.”
:) and here's a cliffie :D  would love to hear from you all! <3 love, tai.
It feels insane, how he gasps and his movements going erratic and Draco allows himself to go with the flow of pleasure that starts in the small of his back and washes down his navel and flows through him like an electric shock or a hurricane.
and they look into each other’s eyes, bewildered, crying and laughing nervously at the same time.
“Not in the sex department,” he muses.
“No, not today,” he says, bringing their lips together again, biting Draco’s lips, undoing the buttons of his shirt. “I want you to suck me off on your knees...”
He delights in the anxiety before their encounters and rejoices in their interactions. His green eyes never miss any heartbeat of movement.
He’s known Pansy Parkinson for quite some time now, but he never in his life thought she would be able to give good advice.
“Oh here, I have a picture of him in my purse. Draco is the most handsome, you will see, he has the Black eyes,” she says, laughing proudly and reaching for her purse. “Do you have a photo of Harry? I’m curious now.”
Harry is surprised by change.
“Do you send pictures, then?” he asks, raising a perfect eyebrow, drawing a naughty expression and Harry throws the dishcloth in his face.
Just like this. Draco keeps looking at him from the bar, while the stranger closes the space between them and catches Malfoy’s lips in his.
Remus takes a moment, his jaw working, eyes fixed on the ground in the middle of the circle and Draco hears in his silence the understanding of their shared agony.
She puts the music on, moves the coffee table, and the fake dragonhide short skirt rides up her thighs when she starts dancing.
