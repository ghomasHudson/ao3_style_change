Draco glances at him dismissively. “Yes, read your book.”
“Any particular reason?”
something whispers in Harry. He licks his lips and lets his vision drop to Draco’s.
He’d decided to take a cup of Spoonfuls coffee upstairs to soothe his soul after lunch, still feeling sluggish and morose after his lay-in, and he’d just gotten back to his street when he saw a flash of red hair and thought no… it couldn’t be. But then he saw him, looking cruelly identical to how he had last night—wide eyes, paling face, speechless.
While he stands deep in thought, Malfoy stares straight ahead until the lift opens, hardly blinking, exceedingly quiet. Without a pause he exits, dark robes fanning out behind him in his haste, and disappears in the first available floo without a glance. Just flames, and Harry is alone.
Harry senses his guardedness. Crosses his arms. “You mean when you kissed me.”
best-seller.”
“It’s just Blaise, he doesn’t—“
“I suppose I wouldn’t disagree.”
On his arm, two gnarled circles that never fully disappeared, despite Hermione’s best efforts. An enduring reminder of Nagini. Draco’s hand willingly follows his guidance, and his eyes dart from Harry’s arm back to his face when he speaks.
“You know, I’m the same way,” he said once after Draco’s frustration turned into an incredible flurry of blows that successfully knocked the wind out of him. He stood panting with his cold water bottle pressed to his forehead, trying to catch his breath.
“You’re always in greys… and blacks… and dark blues… and dark greens,” he says, pinching the piped edge on Draco’s lapel. “Has your mother never told you to try a… sky blue? It would make your eyes pop.”
he thinks. Pansy’s scoffing, too—she knows him just as well. The look they share is at once private and bonding. They both stifle a laugh they’d be hexed dead for if heard through the door.
“I’m sure he is. All I hear about is Draco’s research, his books, his handsomeness… Your mother makes you out to be quite the intellectual heartthrob.”
“It’s Emilia.” Harry speaks even-toned, though sitting beside him suddenly feels electric and dangerous. He doesn’t look at Draco.
“Er, we want to
“And Hermione was really into the India trip and all the genealogy research. We had coffee yesterday and she talked about the Sacred Twenty-Eight for like, thirty minutes. I bet she’ll even have questions for you.”
,” he beams.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” he’d said, taking another bite of his lasagna. Strangely, Ron eating through the conversation comforted Harry— it wasn’t a concern worth putting a fork down. “Mum would go spare. Pass the bread?”
“Sure, but—“
“Sure,” Draco laughs.
“Your daughter, Rose—Harry says she’s started opening cabinets, turning knobs. I’m sure baby-proofing is in your future?”
“Unbelievable.”
,” he mumbles.
Draco frowns, as does Pansy, and when they look towards the door, there’s a second knock, clearer in their silence. She has to nudge him into action, gesturing to the door with a look like she’s worried she’ll have to teach him how to use a knife and fork later, too.
“You what? Thought if you kept popping your head in, you’d discover something? I’m here
Harry’s next words freeze him in place. “Well, that’s an afternoon less of setup, then. Get changed!”
“Why do you ask?”
Finally, agonisingly, he turns to Harry. They’re right in front of the valet, so he signals to his right and walks towards one end of the building away from prying ears. He throws his hands into the pockets of his coat, shoulders tight and high, and pretends to notice something in the flowerbed under the restaurant’s fogged windows.
“Nothing.” Draco pushes off the door, begins to make room on the desk for more work. “So are you sticking around?”
Three beers delicately balanced in his arms, Draco returns to his friends, happy to find that the conversation had shifted in his absence to Blaise’s last hearing. They’re thankful for the pints, and in return he’s thankful to have heard the last of the Potter jokes.
Harry’s magic felt like the taste in the air before a thunderstorm. The crackling of electricity that sends birds flying clairvoyantly to clearer skies. It feels dark and stormy, but benevolently so, naturally so. Like it is such an intrinsic part of the circle of life that even the trees it could fall won’t take offence. Warm and blustery, a summer squall.
“I’ve been studying,” he says.
Draco starts flying in waves and patterns, letting the cool breeze flying past him therapise. He shoots high—Teddy’s informed him that they’ve only got magical neighbours so it’s not a worry—and lays back on the broom like a lounge chair, his legs dangling.
Harry laughs and looks over at Draco almost protectively to make sure he’s still doing fine. He’s staring straight into his emptying soup bowl with wild eyes, and when Harry nudges his shoulder they meet his with something complex behind them that he can’t pinpoint. If Harry had just proposed a riddle, he’d say Draco was solving it.
Draco’s head rises quickly, brows drawn in, and he opens his mouth to argue instantly.
So he braces himself, when his plate is dropped in the sink (Harry insists always on hand-washing), to turn around and be confronted by what might as well feel like nakedness compared to his usual wardrobe. Harry does look him over. He watches green saucers trace slowly down his body and deliberately doesn’t throw his arms behind his back like he wants.
Murray’s eyes dart to the place setting. He opens his mouth, then closes it again.
“I’ve pulled files on anyone who’s supported the probationary release of Death Eaters or said anything laudatory about Death Eaters and Voldemort. The problem is, those files are the centre of a Venn diagram of everyone who’d support you having a second lease at life for both the right
“Come on, then! Shall I scold him or do them myself?”
? Maybe some others.”
“I come every Friday,” he explains as they reach the gym. He informally gets Draco a visitor’s pass from the front reception, which technically consists of pointing to him, saying “Wants to watch me today,” and getting a thumbs up from Bindy behind the desk. “
Harry remembers being unsurprised when Malfoy’s name wasn’t on the guest list. He’d been internalising this as the reason he’d stared so intently and shocked when he’d picked Malfoy out of the crowd earlier. He simply didn’t expect to see him here.
Harry waves goodbye with papers in hand and they’re back on the street. Draco takes a second to appreciate that, unlike every other shop exit, Harry’s finally started to flag and chooses to lean against the wall and reorganise his bags.
With a smirk and only once the dew has sufficiently seeped into his back too, Draco lets him go, standing and holding out a hand. Harry takes it and doesn’t release it until they’re almost into town. He stops just outside the bookstore to pick a leaf out of Draco’s hair before they push open the door.
Draco would love to say that he’d taken in every inch of New Delhi that they’d visited, but he’d spent too much time watching Harry witness it.
Freed, he headed instantly towards the Weasley clan as the band started back up, where Harry stood waiting next to Hermione, face turned into an emotional frown. Draco hunched, linking his arms under Harry’s armpits, and hugged tightly, lifting an inch or so.
Draco pulls his head back to make strict but warm eye contact. “You’re overthinking. Stop. I’m just knackered, that’s all.”
said he could stay or go, though it seems that Harry had at least left and returned. He’s in a different pair of jeans than earlier, a long-sleeved striped polo shirt and another pair of homey knit socks. He doesn’t remember how long ago he’d felt comfortable enough to start kicking off his shoes.
His mum doesn’t need to know all that, though. She’s lived with enough of that prejudice, and he reckons the least he can do for forgetting about her visit altogether is to omit such a painful reminder of their past. So, all he adds is, “Thank Merlin that woman’s alright.”
“I know he can’t do that,” Harry says tiredly, “but it’s not my place to challenge.”
Harry sits for a while, reading. Long enough to have read it twice, and then he flips it over and looks at the envelope again.
“Virginia,” she squeaks.
They’d already ordered a round when he gets to the pub—a godsend because Friday nights at Boggarts are packed. But the more packed, the more invisible Draco is as he weaves through parties standing near the bar.
“Any signs of magic yet?” he asks Ron.
He freezes, momentarily, then quickly returns to fitting the box. His back is still to Malfoy, so he bites his lip to hold his tongue, hoping he hasn’t given the man the satisfaction of catching him off guard.
Harry tries again, unsurprising in his persistence, and the second one he catches with the grace of a Seeker, leaning swiftly with one arm braced against the wood of the boat frame. He captures it in his palm easily, grinning in victory as he sits back down.
His thoughts wander as he throws kick after kick at the bag, and it swings back obtusely, croaking under the weight of its chain and his aggravations.
“If these are deliveries, shouldn’t we check the mailroom, too?”
“What, I come all the way through the fire and that’s all I get?” he asks them.
years ago. I know you two dated for, like, 18 months and it was…
Draco’s scowling and his hand has been cruelly removed from Harry’s leg to cross his arms with scorn. He glares at the wall across from the bed, muttering, “You make me sound like a slob.”
“I don’t know, but I’ll look for you. I’ll find out.”
Harry raises his hands to his cheeks with a faux gasp as she runs and jumps into his lap in attack, then rocks backward flat onto the floor, taking her with him and raising her over his head. “Betrayal! Betrayal!” he shouts, and she’s giggling and kicking her feet, and when he sets her back down, he places the crown on her head.
Harry’s eyes are glued to the family as he speaks.
He keeps his eyes transfixed piercingly on Draco’s deft fingers while they work through the second set of buttons, then helpfully shrugs out of the sleeves. When Draco looks up at him, he can’t wait any longer—he reaches forward, holds his face in his hands and kisses him.
He crosses his arms over his chest and sweeps them out, knocking both of Draco’s arms from under him and he yelps, twisting quickly onto his side just to keep his face from smashing into the mat. Harry straddles him immediately and pins his wrists to the ground. “You really didn’t know?”
*****
Draco is surprised when day after day passes and it seems Harry has listened to his instructions and won’t return unless it’s with evidence in hand. He’d meant for that, at first. Especially so shaken after a day that started with voluntarily entering the Ministry and staying composed as the Head Auror berated him and ended, inexplicably, in a Muggle gym.
“I can almost pull the top of this into a sprout on your head,” he remembers Draco saying during their lazy morning just two days ago. He’d wrapped his fingers around the crown of Harry’s head and gathered the curls up, managing to keep most of them held together.
Draco shrugs.
Slowly, he would work through his cross-referenced inventories while his host worked on personal projects, mostly. He scribbled a lot of what seemed to be arithmancy, occasionally reciting a spell aimed at the cursed skull. When he began a test, Harry would find his parchments drooping distractedly as he watched Draco feel for a trace of magic—the absence of which would be proof of success—with his eyes shut, hand extended so innocuously. Always, Draco would growl in failure and Harry would snap his attention away before he noticed that he had an audience.
“Wood!” Harry blurts. “Not Wood as in…”
“What’s ‘it’?” Ron played along, buttering a piece of bread.
He’s blinded the moment he exits the building.
There’s more heavy laughter, some glancing back to find him by Mari after the joke, and he shakes his head affably for their benefit. When he lifts his gaze and spots the guest of honour speaking to another Auror across the room, it takes one barely-tilted head towards the door for Ron to signal an exit, and Harry nods imperceptibly back. Ron excuses himself from a conversation and Harry does the same within a minute, meeting him just outside his office.
“You’re easy to please.”
He lifts his head and starts lightly stirring again. The top of his hair tickles Draco’s face.
Harry’s pushed open the door to Draco’s bedroom, sober enough to know that if his friend was that bothered, he could put some truly restrictive force into the hand he has on Harry’s shoulder.
“We’re not negotiating.”
“It’s a formality, you see. To double-check the evidence in a situation where the previous specialist has been terminated.”
“I didn’t show signs of magic until I was almost four,” Draco adds. “It must’ve been my father’s pure desperation not to have a Squib that finally drew it out of me.”
Draco sighs and sits back from the coffee table. He watches with good sportsmanship while the rook bashes his king. A miniature cloud of chalky dust explodes upward, then falls softly back to the board.
instead. The England Quidditch team merchandise on the wall is tacked up haphazardly, without pomp, and most of the walls remain boringly beige. There’s music, at least. And cheerful chatter.
Ginny plasters a big smile on her face without intimating that she’s heard a word from him, looking right past to the other end of the table. “Well! That’s enough on the Boy Who Lived, eh? Didn’t Wood do better today, Luna?”
“Well, the evidence is at…”
“He froze, didn’t kiss back. Just stared with mortified eyes and didn’t stop me from leaving.”
Something happens on the television, a nonverbal farce maybe, and he hears Harry laugh lightly in response above him as his fingers comb through. As though it’s just another evening and his hand in Draco’s hair is a regular addendum. Slowly, Harry’s hand adds pressure, and when at one point he grazes down gently with his fingernails, Draco sighs audibly. He swears he can hear Harry smile.
Meanwhile, Harry walks the courtyard. He bends forward and squints at Tamil and Sanskrit inscriptions, shades a hand over his eyes to stare up at the tall stone reliefs, stands far from Draco with his lips pursed and his hands in his pockets investigating the ceiling mural of the Nandi shrine.
“I saw you use your feet too.”
Technically, he’d called off from work. In an owl to Cassie, writing
Draco’s never eaten so much in his life. He’s not sure where Harry procured a feast with the speed and range of Hogwarts kitchen elves, just that by the time he’s changed (albeit slower than usual) and come traipsing into the kitchen, a full spread is waiting. There’s oatmeal and eggs and jam on toast and Spoonfuls pastries and fruit and coffee and orange juice. There are also two little Muggle pills.
“You are
Harry accepts his hand in a friendly shake, trying to steady the heaving rise and fall of his weary lungs, then lifts the boxing ring’s top rope gallantly for them both to duck through.
Draco shakes his head, sipping his beer, happy for the calming buzz that’s starting to land. The Juliya debate has been ongoing for weeks. No one had asked him to take a side yet, which was delightful.
“I don’t want to shout! Come down!”
“Hm.” She turns to him, dark eyes meeting his own, still warm. It’s a stunning recreation of Mrs Weasley’s ability to affect anger and love in the same breath. “It’s been too long.”
“It was for me.”
“Come in and shut up, your bad jokes will make me sick again,” he mutters.
“I’m your ‘
that was an evasive answer. But he’s glad to have it out. They’ll only move past ‘nemeses’ if they talk candidly. He lowers his voice as he speaks.
The way he sees it,
“You were standing right there when I realised I had feelings for you,” he says abruptly.
“And this dress shirt,” he says. “You don’t want it to be wrinkled.”
Startled by the strength of the thought, he rocks the boat with how quickly he jerks back. He clears his throat and reaches for his water, drinking half of it before his nerves begin to settle. Harry is spectacularly oblivious, poking one foot with the trouser leg rolled up to the knee into the sand.
“I wanted this, too,” Harry says before he can get there. “Honestly, I thought I would get further. I guess I underestimated just what you’d do to my composure.”
“Only the ones our investigators managed. Basic spell memories, but they showed nothing.”
, don’t you think?”
“Harry, it’s fine. I don’t care,” he says, watching the relief visibly cross his face.
“Tace, Foley.” Harry nods, fixing his stare back on the lift doors.
“Erm, alright.”
Draco sits up straighter. He wants to reach out and place a hand over those fingers, stop their nervous tapping, and with it settle his own guilt. He’s been pushing Blaise away, and in the orbit (as Harry would call it) of his new obsession, he hadn’t seen how it affected the other man. He deserves more than Draco’s been offering.
Harry recounts the whole tale, including Murray’s less-than-ethical attempt to get him to look the other way for a few days with Malfoy in custody while they began tackling leads. Hermione is shocked, while Ron looks as unsurprised as Harry had felt.
“Sickle for your thoughts,” he speaks warmly. He’s dropped the camera back into the bag and propped a knee up on the seat of the boat, his hands flat on top.
“And they—Mr and Mrs Dursley. They didn’t tell you why?”
His voice lowers almost inaudibly by the time he’s finished and his gaze shifts down. Draco surprises himself by briefly wondering what would happen if he clambered to the floor and wrapped him in a tight hug. It’s a borderline perverted thought for a man who’s barely embraced his mother since he’d surpassed her in height.
Teddy just shrugs. “’s alright. Gran says it’s really important and dangerous.”
They both stare down onto the ring of blank space, but it makes the hair stand up on the back of Harry’s neck and leaves them both a little sick to their stomachs, so they move upstairs efficiently.
“Now look, I didn’t
“Huh. Sit.” He steps back into the hallway between the two rooms and levitates the skull from one to the other, setting it before the man who’d sat obediently at one head of the table. “Anything?”
“I thought you must have left,” he says, his voice gravelly.
“Weird bloody poetry,” Harry muttered. With a Seeker’s agility, he swung the rolling pin at Draco’s hand, which had reached once again for the chocolate. “If you eat it all, these won’t be pains au chocolat, just… pains.”
“You’re here,” Draco breathes, with little care for coherence, throwing his pressed slacks into a heap on the floor. “So good.”
“It’s really important to me that you feel you can do just as much work as would get done at home,” Harry shakes his head. “I don’t want to be dragging you from something. Honestly.”
“I—you know, I didn’t mention, but I think I was recognised yesterday,” he says.
Or perhaps,
“Blimey, I guess I forgot that misreading someone else’s behaviour is an excuse for your own.”
“I do,” he says softly.
“Yes, er, he wanted a case update, but he’s out.”
Harry’s fuming. His leg taps incessantly below the desk. This may truly be the most emotionally confusing week of his life. “I will… convey the information,” he bites out.
“Now if we could just get her down from the tower a bit more often, it would be perfect.” Ginny smiles wryly, approaching steps behind Luna and looking beautiful in a blue gown that makes her hair look even more flaming than usual, her eyes a warmer amber.
He nods and guides him to look to his right, traces the line of his split lip, then lifts his shirt. He notices when Harry winces as he lifts his arms, and investigates the remnants of hex damage on his bicep and his upper ribs.
“Yeah, yes. Sorry to bother, I was just seeing if Ron was busy.”
“And lose a chance to see your face?”
surprise trip to India had been executed. They’d been together more often than not, and yet neither he nor Draco’s friends had any clue that he was practically moonlighting as a travel agent. Harry, on the other hand, took his plans to Hermione almost immediately.
“Remember that talk we had about not giving Ron anything to work with?” he murmurs in Draco’s ear.
“It would look suspicious, wouldn’t it? Someone like you on the case? Best to keep it quiet.”
They leave him for a moment and Hermione returns alone, with a blanket and a pillow and a little pill. “Melatonin,” she says. “You need sleep.”
, Potter.”
Draco closes the door softly and nudges past him. When he kneels in front of the gifts on the floor and shuts his eyes, Harry ogles freely. His eyelids are not squeezed shut, but closed lightly like in meditation, and he lifts a hand delicately. Everything about it exposes elegance, not force.
He has a moment, then, sitting across from Harry, who’s brought him water and felt his forehead and cared so deeply. And beyond that, has been an impressive Auror despite the personal complications this case has brought him. There’s a crashing feeling in his chest, of overwhelming emotion.
Harry speaks high-pitched and fluttery. “I have my jewels and my honour. They can take me from the court but they can’t take who I am.”
Harry looks up towards the sky. “I don’t know. I don’t know the right answer.”
“Did you eat?”
Right in front of him. With an intimidating kindness, like McGonagall, like Marinella. With respect and years together in the field. She has
Harry transfigures a box to hold the cursed book and begins fitting a lid for safe transport, when Malfoy sneers, “It’s a date,” voice dripping with sarcasm. “Alert the press.”
It’s not a word he takes lightly, but Draco loves Dante. He’d gotten him as a kitten in Diagon Alley a few years back when the flat had begun to feel especially lonely. Dante’s done well at filling the space and loving him back, and was eerily good at knowing when he’s in distress, even for a creature with an affinity for reading peoples’ trustworthiness. Just as importantly, to him at least, Dante was one of the few living things that only knew post-war Draco.
Hermione purses her lips and sends Ron I-told-you-so eyes as she sets Rose back on her feet. She gestures to the young babysitter, sitting unobtrusively on the rug where Ron had scooped Rose up minutes ago. He joins Harry by the fire and together they watch Hermione and Francesca guide Rose in her little pink pyjamas towards her bedroom.
“You snore, by the way,” Harry adds, testing his luck.
“I do.”
“I have a track record for eventful Halloweens.”
“Great idea,” Harry says and kisses the top of his head. “I may just hike down, but I’ll be back in time for lunch, bring sandwiches, maybe. I spotted a radio in the kitchen, in case you want it. There’s tea in there, too. And coffee.”
and begins to move quietly past the residences.
, he thinks, trailing off.
“At school, right? But... not now?”
“It sounded like…
If the two men thought what they witnessed by Thursday’s lunch was a load of flowers, the reception desk on Friday morning is a lush garden. Harry has half a mind to think Murray has sent him
He’s having trouble keeping his thoughts straight. In one moment, he’s whirring through all the ways someone could’ve gotten into his flat, and in the next, he’s preoccupied solely by Draco’s recuperation and what it’ll entail. Then he’ll stumble into regrets he knows are stupid but hit hard anyway, like why he let Draco take a shower, why he didn’t give a cursory trace of all his personal belongings on Halloween when he got home.
“It wasn’t my secret to tell!” Blaise defends, pushing Pansy back across the table for what must be the fourth time that night. He looks back at Draco. “Sorry, but it’s been over a decade, and if the Potter jokes were getting at you because you thought I’d care about that, then I wanted you to know I know. And I don’t. Care, that is. Men
She turns to him just as the egg timer goes off. Saved by the bell. He escapes to the kitchen and busies himself with plating dinner as he hears Ginny moving to the table. At the last second, he waves his hand vaguely towards the radio, playing some light music to guarantee that they’re never sitting in silence.
“I made the egotistical decision that you saying ‘I need to be alone’ didn’t include me.”
you get your work done, so long as it gets done?”
“No,” Harry concedes tenderly, staring at his profile. “You’re elegant. Exquisite.”
, which sends his thoughts back to the Muggle bar after his first major paparazzi experience and Harry’s fifteenth year of the same. He’s been written about plenty, but never ambushed, presumably because unlike Harry, he offered not an ounce of patience.
He nods slowly.
“Well then…” Draco pants between kisses. “Here’s a challenge… Make me… speechless.”
“Why is this framed as though there’s any competition between her husband and this old boyfriend?” he asks thirty minutes in. “Her husband is much closer to her age, respectful, and a resistance leader. He’s handsome and fights Nazis.”
Ron looks at him keenly. “He’s the worst!”
“Draco,” Pansy hisses.
“Perhaps.”
“Did you have a good Christmas?”
Draco stops the investigation there, feeling it too soon to spend exorbitant time examining his features. The book in his hand, however, seems like fair play, so he answers Harry’s bizarre question with one of his own.
“You’re not a Muggle!”
Draco had to practically kick Harry out of his house that evening, he’d been so excited to make progress. Though he’d had often watched Harry work on study nights, it had been paperwork for a job he seemed less-than-thrilled about, though he’d never make such a bold claim to Auror Potter’s face.
Draco doesn’t answer, but he does attempt to take him down again. Harry counters him hypocritically, with the same confidence in his strength that he’d pointed to as Jack’s fatal flaw, and Draco smirks and dodges swiftly. Harry looks shaken, surprised—just as Draco likes him—and they lock eyes.
, Harry had walked into the study with his collection of files from home and instantly recognised the absence of the antique chair.
He thrusts out his forearm, the left one.
“Yes yes, I—
“Thank you,” he says.
Draco feels that crawling, dark feeling growing in his stomach. Sod the risks of drinking while apparating. He’s never sobered up so fast anyway.
“I’m fixing this. I’ll fix this.”
“Use the little arrows to move around the screen, and the little green button here to start the time, I already set it for five minutes, okay?” He mumbles it under his breath, watching Draco hold the phone as delicately as a raw egg, comically outside his comfort zone. “Just say ‘Go’ and ‘Stop’ for us,” he adds, louder now, as he ducks back in.
“Then why do you wear them?”
It’s just past five, so the high street is full of shoppers, people bustling home from work or heading out to meet friends. Harry is stopped much more than usual—the papers have not let up on speculating about the case and the role he might play. ‘
“She’s on the warpath, Harry, truly,” he whispers. “But you’ve got to remember, I see you at work. If you’re not visiting, she’s not seeing you at all.”
*****
Bitterly, it’s that exact kind of natural, silent conversation that sent a twist into his heart all over again. It acted as a reminder that they could have compassion for him, but never a complete understanding. For them, he’s happy, and for himself, in the rawness of a separation, perhaps jealous.
“You see Draco more than I do,” Pansy is saying, “did
“—arry? Earth to Harry…”
“Did you… just wake up? It’s noon,” he questions.
Neville and Luna spy the pair just when they pop up into the teacher section, waving them towards an open bench near the top rows. Luna’s golden curls are flattened under a royal blue knit hat, and beside her, Neville has taken up Harry’s more unassuming approach to dress and looks, as he has for almost the last decade, rather handsome in a mutely-toned jumper. He glances past Luna with an easy, toothy smile.
. Virginia Woolf.”
“You would.” He says it flatly. A statement of disbelief.
“Waiting for your full attention.”
Hermione taps her finger against her lips thoughtfully. “Not just with your wands maybe, but a specialist might.”
“Is this okay?” Harry whispers an inch from his mouth.
“He didn’t tell you?”
Draco beckons him in, still in a dressing robe and his silk pyjamas. Their plates from last night are in the sink, and when he glances into the study, it looks like a tornado has blown through.
“Big day.”
? He’d imagined it often enough that it felt odd to be a reality.
And yet, there’s a surprising bright spot in his wretched work week: Each afternoon, from the day he compiled his files, he would gather his lists and ball himself up in Draco’s reading chair, originally under the pretence that he ‘might have questions’, but eventually in the honest enjoyment of quiet companionship, though neither would announce such a thing aloud.
“Pardon, Harry? Potter?” Everyone swivels to a quiet young woman standing just behind Ginny, approaching timidly as she speaks. “Sorry to bother, I was just wondering if I could get your signature. Or buy you a drink,” she adds, blushing.
Draco thrusts his head under the water once more, rubbing his face vigorously, and resolves to go with his proven success—engaging with the enemy. Running away, in more ways than one, has never proved especially helpful.
It reminds him of when people are star-struck by him but go so far out of their way to appear otherwise for his benefit that they overcorrect, and seem to be working incredibly hard to partake in normal human behaviour.
“It was flowers,” Harry finally informs in privacy. “Murray’s been receiving them for days, and Cassie grabbed one. Her hair caught fire. Ron put it out,
in me.”
“Can I ask you a question?” Harry speaks as they’re limbering up.
And so yes, this is all to say that he certainly feels rather comfortable with Ron and Hermione and even Ginny by now—none of which, unfortunately, lowers the specific anxiety he feels for entering the Weasley sanctum itself.
“You know what I love best about Christmas Day?” she prompts, crossing her legs and leaning back casually.
Blaise makes a face, one that implies Draco’s being dramatic, which he is. “Can you cool off, Malfoy? Your energy is unmatchably intense.”
“NO! Merlin’s beard, what do you take me for?” he baulks.
he thinks.
“This was everything I needed,” Draco says, muffled.
Blaise and Pansy both look respectfully agreeable for a moment, but it’s not built to last. Pansy seems bright with deviousness.
“Send just a draft to that Marta woman, a brief. If she says no, I will drop it forevermore.”
To understand what synapses fire in Draco’s brain to turn what Harry obviously expects to be incendiary into the fondness he feels instead probably requires a Mind Healer, but when he thinks back and attempts to parse through it himself, he sees it like this:
,” he recites, focusing on maintaining clear sight and annunciation. Curse-breaking spells were volatile, a single stumble capable of escalating instead of mollifying. “
, it’s called poetry, Potter. Have some class.”
Ron stills in front of him, one foot out of the hearth.
Any self-created, internalised homophobia is fair game.
she’d said.
Harry opens one eye. “Really?”
Draco’s thoughts are stuck between squirming under the truth of the accusation and celebrating the proof that he’d been right to restrain some information for so long as he wanted to coast along with his feelings unrecognised.
“Harry Potter.”
It’s becoming apparent that Harry’s lack of eye contact is not, as he’d imagined, rooted in anger, but embarrassment.
“The new curse—“
“Okay, shit. We need to slow down whatever
controversy into your own life, for the fucking love of Circe.”
“Cool.”
“Oh, you first,” Harry decides, staying on his knees, his arms resting on Draco’s lap. Without even thinking, Draco leans forward and cards his fingers into that hair, capturing his lips and thinking how delightful it is to do something so simple and human and mortal, to do nothing but listen to Harry sigh deeply through his nose. “What was that for?” he asks breathlessly.
“Quite right,” he replies, patting a surprised-by-agreement Ron on the shoulder. “Or perhaps ‘was’, but more for ‘later’, yeah?” He pulls the cloak back around his shoulders.
It’s late when Harry walks back towards Islington. He ambles slowly, enjoying the cold air on his cheeks, his hands in his pockets, not even a need for his iPod. It’s a fair walk from Ron and Hermione’s, but to feel his legs moving after a day of trace practising and no associated sparring (a strange absence, after he’d taken notice of Draco’s proclivity to immediately counter one with the other like a transaction) was pleasant.
“Boggarts nights with Pansy and Blaise.”
here.”
She quiets at the interruption and looks down at his hands hesitantly. In a moment, she’s charmed them clean.
He seems unsure of himself in front of Draco, no doubt confused about what he wants now that he’s here. Draco wishes he could help, but he doesn’t know either. Rather considerately, Potter hasn’t mentioned what they both know; Draco could’ve chosen any location for escape, so long as he didn’t announce it to the journalists. But he chose here.
Upon reaching the evidence room, however, Harry’s in for a shock.
“Harry’s cross with you.”
“This has been good bits, bugger off.”
, he considers.
“Look, er,” Potter watches him curiously, taking that same muggle contraption from around his neck. He absently coils the long wires around his fingers as he hesitates. “D’you fancy a drink? It’s a bit early, but it is Happy Hour.”
time I said please, I was ridiculed,” Harry reminds him.
“Er, hey,” he says quietly, almost nervously. “Hey, what’s…”
Draco chuckles, pulling the duvet up to the headboard.
(See the end of the chapter for

He nods slowly before looking back at his drink.
leaving him with you,” Pansy says. “There’s nothing quite like a damaged Draco trying to prove he can handle himself.”
“Okay,” he says faintly.
“I don’t,” Harry answers solemnly.
Draco rolls his eyes to the ceiling. “Are
“I know. You’re completely cleared,” he says calmly. Firmly. “Get out.”
“Of course not,” he replies, sitting back on his heels. “You first,” he repeats, forcing Draco back into the gravity at hand.
Hope it was worth the wait! Warning that there will be a slight mention of blood again.
“He’s only human, ‘Mione.”
Draco scowls. “You have not.”
She gives him that look—the one Jack had given—and it sticks with him as he’s leaving, still when he gets home, and as he looks at himself closely in the mirror while the shower heats, tracing and pulling at his skin with his fingertips.
“Good.”
Harry sends him out through the kitchen window. A late summer breeze filters through, cool and serene, accompanied with the scent of blooming jasmine, and it drops Harry’s shoulders, loosens his tense muscles. He takes a deep, cleansing breath and leaves the window open.
need to relax?” he scoffs. “You should see yourself.”
Hermione lays her hands flat on the table definitively, determined to repair the strange downswing in conversation. “Rose said the funniest thing this morning—“
And the entire time he’ll wonder whether Draco’s owled him. To break up with him. Or to demand an apology, which he’d give. Or to forgive

the spell! She’d be in a lot worse of a state!” he spits, nodding towards the recovering woman with the little mobility he has left.
“So are there any wizards proficient in curses who have access to your floo, don’t necessarily need to work at the Ministry, and have a motive?”
Just yesterday, he’d mentioned Luna while bustling about Draco’s kitchen—two weeks into their study nights he’d found the urge to prove his skills in the kitchen and was letting himself because it was a Friday afternoon. Draco had allowed him to ramble as if she was nothing more than a passerby from his school days.
“I don’t
case, why would you—“
, but… nothing else?”
“Just waiting for me at my home? Had you thought to try saying ‘Hey, Potter, wait up’ instead of pointing a wand?” Harry is tense, and it shows in his voice.
The box fills up quickly on the second and third floors thanks to various bedrooms that hadn’t found use even during the Order days, and in cupboards and dressers and under beds Harry discovers several items subjected to various levels of Dark severity. They both dodge a nasty grandfather clock that tries to hex them as they pass in the second-floor hallway, and even Draco isn’t interested in having it in his own home.
“Damn.” His hands come up to cradle his face the moment the owl hoots and soars off, either because he hasn’t signed the note or because he shouldn’t have sent it.
“Well, who took it?!”
Draco groans before he can stop himself, feeling another speech bubbling up, but it’s one that’s felt especially necessary and so he lets it boil over.
Draco’s face flushes, Harry’s too when he turns to look at him. “Oh well,” he says casually, voice a bit high. “It’s—I mean, I’m moving in hopefully before December. But Draco… he’s—“
Now, he levitates the cursed copy of his book out of its evidence box, throwing a shield between Harry and the rest of the table for peace of mind. At the addition of the shield, Harry looks up from the notes with hesitant interest.
He tries a smile in truce, says “Thanks for still meeting with me,” then glances at the emptying dishware across from his steaming coffee. “I hope you’ve not been waiting long.”
“Who’s Simon?”
“Would you
The problem is, Hermione has given him enough to chew on that he needs to talk about this, but she didn’t offer herself up. That’s convenient, isn’t it? Drop something to someone she never speaks to that she knows will leave him confused and rethinking very large decisions. Never mind that he and Harry agreed not to speak of this to their friends, and he seems to have told Hermione everything, or at least enough for her to seek out and send exactly what might sway him. If they’re over, he supposes Harry’s free to do as he wants.
He clears his throat. “Er, since Emilia,” he admits with an air of disingenuous nonchalance, turning and busying himself by clearing the table to eat. Harry says nothing more while he clears the papers and stacks the evidence and the Ministry form for Harry by the door, but the second he’s in sight again, he’s being interrogated again.
says –" Harry broke off, looking at Ron with concern. "Are you alright, mate? Not having second thoughts are you? Because Hermione would kill us both, you know."
. There's nothing to do here. Why can't I be there with you?"
"I take it you haven't seen the
"I'm sure you know why I'm here," Neville said, his voice measured.
He eased himself out of bed, wincing as his muscles protested the move. He noticed he'd managed to get his shoes off, at least, last night. Thankful for the added stealth his sock-feet gave him, he padded down the hallway, wand out in as he searched for the bizarre noise.
"No, thank you," he said, tossing a Galleon onto her tray anyway. She smiled and winked at him, moving on to another table.
"He's amazing, Blaise," Draco said earnestly, his slender fingers stroking the stack of papers that sat on his desk. "Did you see this? I told him I liked James Evans in passing, weeks ago. Yesterday he sends me this – it's James Evan's newest book, not even on the market yet!"
him, today, but Draco wouldn't trade the chance to be so near Harry for anything. There would be plenty of time for touching later, after their courtship was firmly established.
Hermione pulled his laptop over toward her side of the table, pulling up the document Harry had been working on all morning. It was nearly blank.
"I'll see you around, Pansy," he said before turning to nod stiffly at the blond, who moved from the doorway to let him pass. "Malfoy."
"Draco Abraxas Malfoy, I seek to be of one mind, one spirit and one life with you for all eternity."
. There were many reasons to be nervous. The joking, carefree man he'd spent the day with seemed different here in the privacy of Draco's study, drumming his fingers absently on the arm of the chair. He looked sexy, and more than a little dangerous.
"Sorry," he said again, tossing the bag onto a nearby table. "Took longer than I thought it would."
"It was," Neville agreed, looking around before casting a surreptitious Warming Charm on his neglected breakfast. He dug into his eggs, his stomach rumbling as he ate. "Still," he said between bites, "You're going to have a hard time with Draco, Harry. I hope you're prepared."
Harry could feel the hot prick of tears, but he made no effort to stop them. Everything he'd ever wanted was right here in this room.
Draco turned, his tentative grin turning into a full-fledged smile when he realized Neville and Blaise were still there. His resolute chaperons had Conjured comfortable chairs near the edge of the pond, staring back with watchful eyes. He relaxed a bit, confident they would stop any inappropriate contact between him and Harry. He looked at his bouncing son, black hair hidden under a Slytherin-colored knit cap, cheeks flushed a rosy red from the cold, grey eyes dancing with excitement. Cal's presence would prevent anything from happening as well, and his smile grew as he met Harry's sparkling green eyes, sure that had been at least part of Harry's intent. It was a relief to know that Harry was sticking with the courtship rules, even though those rules prevented them from having any physical contact for another week. It wasn't that he didn't want to touch the Gryffindor – in fact, he'd like nothing better than to strip him naked and shag him on the snow-covered ground – but he knew following the stringent rules would protect Cal. It meant the world to Draco that Harry seemed as committed to that as he was.
"He's out in the vineyards with Nev," Blaise said. "Call tonight before bedtime? I'll make sure he's here."
Thanks again to Kamerreon, beta extraordinaire!
"Were you in on the scheme, Malfoy?" The Auror sneered, his expression full of disdain. "An innocent guy like Atalier couldn't have come up with this on his own. What was your cut?"
"I appreciate it, Harry," the red-headed wizard said, smiling tightly.
"So it would seem. You are free for lunch, aren't you?"
"Gone," he gasped skidding to a stop in front of them. "Cartwell's gone. He had a hidden Portkey. He's escaped."
interpreted that way, but he has a very expensive solicitor who seems to think it can be."
He sighed, bored with the film already. Deciding a book might hold his interest better, Draco turned the television off and Summoned the first edition copy of
“You don’t mind, do you?” Hannah asked innocently, her brow furrowing as Theo failed to answer her.
“You don’t mind if I watch, do you?” she repeated, studying the Slytherin’s slightly sweaty face.
Harry spread his hands in mock invitation, gesturing for Neville to continue.
, he thought, grinning fondly despite the being the one to concede. After all, he'd managed to have a marvelous orgasm, and he'd helped Sly have one, too. He stretched lazily, enjoying the slight burn in his muscles from the strenuous wank. He was pleased that Sly's hand had felt so familiar when it touched his cock. Definitely something he could get used to, but surprising since they'd only done it once before.
Blaise tucked a warm cloak around Draco's shoulders, snapping him out of his reverie. Neville materialized at his side, winding a familiar Slytherin scarf around his neck. He hadn't realized it was cold before that moment, but now he noticed he could see his breath crystallize in front of his face.
Pansy sighed, tucking her legs up underneath her.
"Draco," he breathed, the sound barely audible. It was both exaltation and reprimand; Harry didn't want him to stop, but he also didn't want to consummate their bonding in such an unromantic – and undignified – manner.
Harry sighed, closing his laptop. He wasn't going to get any work done with Draco so agitated. He crossed the room, wrapping his arms around the other man, stilling his nervous motions.
Harry sighed, looking longingly at his laptop before setting it aside. "Yes. She said thanks."
hadn't served the Dark Lord, no matter how forced the service was.
They'd had this conversation many times, too. He wanted to compensate her for the lost income she surely suffered from not having Harry Potter as her client, but she wouldn't hear of it. Hell, he'd love to buy her and Ron a house, or start a vault for them at Gringotts, but neither would even consider it.
More shocked looks and frantic scribbling. He almost felt sorry for them. He and Draco were dumping so much newsworthy information on them all at once that they'd likely have a hard time figuring out what to lead with.
He looked up at Ron, a brilliant smile splitting his face. "Thanks, mate. Looks like I owe you one."
"Sly," Harry answered, twining their fingers and letting Draco pull him to his feet.
Draco's frown deepened. He hadn't been able to allay Madam Atalier's fears a few weeks ago, nor had he been able to convince her that her son was the problem. She and her husband steadfastly refused to turn him out, despite the fact that the business had been on the decline since he took the helm. Blaise had put all the Atalier's Gringotts accounts under surveillance for the last two weeks, though, and they'd gotten the proof they needed to show the little bastard was embezzling.
"I, er, should go with him," she stammered, watching Ron approach Neville. The two men headed out toward the gardens, and Ginny started to follow. "Ron doesn't know anything about flowers. I should make sure he's telling Neville the right thing."
"Hermione?" Ron whispered, and she shuddered as his breath caressed her ear. "
Cal looked impossibly small standing there before the Minister, his body dwarfed by the large man in front of him. Still, he held his head high, his thin shoulders squared as he answered him.
He nodded stiffly unsure of what protocol he should be following. There wasn't a chapter in the Auror Training Manual about how to address your best friend's love-interest-and-likely-future-husband while overseeing a Ministry-mandated search of said love interest's office.
“A lot would’ve been different if we’d been less hostile,” he says instead.
He rolls his eyes, “Yes,
“It’s
“No. I love it,” Draco stammers. “Magnificent.”
Harry’s eyes dart between his, and he shakes a hand out from under the sheets to place warmly on Draco’s cheek. He closes his eyes and focuses on the warm palm as he speaks his longest, most detailed recounting.
At this, Draco exhales through his nose thoughtfully, staring out onto the fountain for a moment.
Considering he hadn’t known he’d choose to walk home until he’d hugged Hermione goodbye, the concept that someone else had correctly predicted this too and sat on his stoop waiting was shocking. He stops right before his first step, head tilted with a curious smile at the seated figure.
Harry hums thoughtfully. “Is that what you felt in the mailroom?”
Draco continues to put on airs, snapping back quickly at her jokes, affecting exhaustion when she asks of Luna, trying not to fidget. He’s not nervous to see Potter, despite Pansy’s continual teasing, but there’s no telling how long he’ll resent his old professor for forcing him into an entire banquet for some charms questions—he’d thought their academic relationship was strong enough to grab a pint, at least.
“G’morning,” he mumbles then, to win Harry’s attention.
“It’s not
The window wall opposite his desk is charmed as he always leaves it; the view of London that he’d see if he wasn’t a kilometre underground. Now, in the late evening that sundown had passed through hours ago, the blinding sight of Whitehall’s ivory masonry is lit only so much as the streetlamps will allow.
“I think we both didn’t want to upset our straight friend by talking about gay things.”
And yet Harry doesn’t feel that purposeful, stunted affection of trying from before, but something easier. Natural.
Harry almost chokes. “That seems a bit extreme. It’s perfectly normal—“
“If we could just have some Junior Aurors on the case with me, or Auror Weasley, I’d have enough hands for some stakeouts or even a setup. To see if we can catch anyone in the act of purchasing or—“
“Yes, mother.”
“I haven’t seen it.”
“Tea, then,” he decides, touching his arm amicably.
“Tell me word-for-word what he said about a date again?” Hermione says thoughtfully.
thing we have in common, if you need ideas. Hogwarts School of fucking Witchcraft and Wizardry.”
Ron’s cheeks are as red as his hair, and he snatches the robes closed as fast as he can. “It was a funny gift for Hermione once,” he whinges. “Rose was up early and I had to leave so fast and… you’re having a laugh!”
“Wh—Jealous?” he splutters.
His family isn’t mentioned by name, so he picks up the next. It’s called
“Ginny!” Hermione meets her with a tight hug, looking just as surprised as Harry feels. “Since when were you coming? Shouldn’t you be away with the team?”
“Who’s Jack?”
Besides his personal agony, the event runs smoothly, though his left hand hovers anxiously by his wand under the table for most of the meal, and he’s never been happier than he is to see Draco already on his sofa, case notes in hand and feet propped on the coffee table, when he finally arrives at his home that night.
“So you’ll go?”
She looks him up and down, fingers laced together. “Please, Mr Malfoy. You’ve left Hogwarts twice. Stayed longer than any student who didn’t become a professor. Beaten me
“Done.”
The ‘Ministry schmuck’ comment hurt, yes, but it was the identity of the man behind the words that did him in. He was surprised, after what he’d thought was friendly progress, to elicit such a livid reaction. He wouldn’t have followed Malfoy out of Boggarts if he didn’t think their relationship could be different now, and until Friday, he’d assumed they were circumstantial enemies, thrown into a feud bigger than them, fueled by old stereotypes, partisan sorting, and loads of bad parenting.
Draco takes a step forward, eyebrows raised, not sure himself. “Er, why would you…”
“There was so much that could’ve stopped it from working,” he explains instead. “All the things I’m sure you’re hesitant about with him right now. So I thought it was safer, if it was going to implode in two days, to save us all the trouble.”
“Harry, you’re a bloody celebrity! I know you don’t act like one, and I love that, but you’re still you. You need… security. Wards. God almighty…” He throws a hand into his hair. “No wonder. I’m lucky you weren’t assassinated ages ago.”
“I’m taking a break, pay attention to me.”
At this last accusation, Ron makes it five minutes into haranguing them on the moral issue of referee foul oversight before Hermione cuts him off to turn the conversation sharply around to Harry.
“You used to spar with Jack? It was helpful?”
“Harry?” Cassie says softly, gently poking her head through the open door.
“Thanks,” he says, holding them to his nose for a sniff. “What’re these for?”
, but I’ve once again been reduced to a hand that signs case reports and Obliviation requests.”
He’s barely audible as he says, “Thank you.”
Draco turns to face him on his bed, the mattress bouncing as he situates himself with his legs crossed under him like a child. He regards him thoughtfully. “Can’t two people just do nice things for each other without keeping score?”
Blaise throws his hands up. “Oh come off it. If
magic?” Ron asks. Harry thinks his physical appearance makes this obvious, but he nods anyway. “Merlin, I can see the articles now. You’re rubbish at flying under the radar.”
“I don’t,” he lies, just a little, “but it is late.”
“Very briefly.”
Draco.
“Well… I’m sorry you did so much work and it wasn’t that helpful.”

—they’ve spent years comfortably past those early idolised interactions. But if it hurt her, then intention didn’t matter, did it?
Draco hums in response. “Are you coming up soon?”
“Yes, darling, and there will not be a single copy of the
The title comes from William Wordsworth's Lakes-inspired poem 'I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud'
“H-hello, and thank you for joining us tonight,” Potter stutters. Strong start, then. “Ten years ago, I began my journey to defeat the very… personification of evil and restore peace to the wizarding world.”
Draco’s face is emotionless beside his large eyes, offering Harry no marker of how he’s feeling.
“Yes, wonderful, Kreacher. I believe it’s likely she was an arrogant blood purist, so unfortunately I’d be similarly honoured to have her hatred.”
His feet work faster than his mind, sprinting back up the stairs two at a time to the bathroom with a terrible feeling in his gut like he just knows something has gone terribly wrong. He turns the corner, listens to himself shout “
“I don’t mind staying.”
Harry jerks awake, the scream still echoing in his ears. He lays silently, slowing his breathing and sitting in silence, attempting to decipher if he’d cried out loud. His heart beats as if he did.
“Do what well?”
Harry shakes his head. Looks around quickly. “Erm, windows.”
“Piss
“You sappy bloke,” said Harry as he let go.
Draco feels a surge of annoyance when he looks past him for the umpteenth time as if he cares about whatever the game score is. At his question, though, two wide green eyes snap back to him with abrupt alertness. “What do
“Auror Potter!” Murray tries to act unflustered by his sudden entrance. It’s an attempt to save face, as everything is with Murray, but it only makes Harry roll his eyes internally—only a fragile man would think it worth his time to mask such a minor moment of surprise. “What’s brought you so… unexpectedly into my office?”
Just like that he’s ruined everything. He thinks this might be the biggest mistake of his life.
“I’m always happy to see you. I was just expecting someone.”
He knocks his feet together, spreading his arms out like he’s going to create a snow angel in the greenery. “I think it’s rubbish. You don’t need turning into a frog to tell you that kissing is gross.”
Murray looks at him with confusion. “Cassie…?” he says, clearly unable to place the name.
“Well if you two are going to the Ministry, we’re going to the park,” announces Hermione, standing and lifting Rose from Harry’s lap. “Ron, make Harry eat. God knows what I’ve done to deserve spending this week just trying to put food in a grown man.”
Harry had stood with the rolling pin raised as he spoke, and whacked at the dough with confusion on his face. He put his full weight into rolling. “You got an icebox because you like plums?”
He stares unseeingly at Harry’s socks, and, abruptly, his heart is in his throat and his stomach drops to his tailbone, his hands clammy and breath shaky. And then, just as suddenly as it hit, his insides calm and he’s reborn into a single train of thought:
,” he replies, rolling his eyes before looking beyond Draco in sudden speculation. “…
Harry can’t be mad that they’ve circumvented Draco’s protocol. He’s too intrigued. “It feels as strong as a curse, but not malicious,” he says.
Draco delicately placed his hand on hers, removing it from his shoulder, then runs his fingers through his hair. Once cropped fairly short, it’s grown long enough on the top and sides to brush the middle of his ears. “I’ve been working on breaking a curse. It got a little out of hand. Tea?”
Harry responds casually as he returns from the kitchen, “Oh, it’s mine.”
“Gin, I’m so sorry,” Harry starts instantly. “I-I’m mortified. I didn’t mean it like—I didn’t mean you, I—“
“Ugh, yeah, she would.”
“We did a number on each other,” Harry corrects, taking a big sip. “But separating let me… find something new about myself. Something that Ginny had noticed first. I started seeing men and realised that—with the women, they were never as perfect as Ginny? But these blokes could be far from perfect and I’d still… you know.”
*****
He’d left around three that morning, but he was past calm into steely ire at the Ministry, and a strangely platonic almost-thankfulness (almost) for Potter, as persuaded by his friends. They made plans to meet up soon, and Draco had stumbled into bed with two pacts in mind: he’d never walk into the Ministry again, and he’d avoid hypocrisy by giving his Hogwarts peers the same open mind he was so desperate to receive.
“Well, Slytherins are smart too, but they like to call it
Harry declines politely, moving further into the stall even as he does so. He lingers by a short bookcase, fingers pulling at a book on wizard sport in Asia, which he tucks under his armpit as he journeys further into the back of the shop.
Draco doesn’t argue. Instead, he sighs knowingly, as if this is something that’s already been weighing on him. “Yes… I imagine tonight will be telling of just how much mercy is needed.”
. But he can’t bring himself to challenge the why so long as there is a what that he wants from him.
His legs are stretched out across the empty sofa, ruminating heavily when, too soon to have changed, he hears the footsteps again and Harry hurries back around the corner, leans down and kisses him quickly.
Draco remembers; the letter and his goading ‘
“When we—at the shop. You held your hand out and—“
“Oh, I refused to get in the ring, don’t worry.”
“Harry,” he breathes, then stands there saying absolutely nothing else.
He brushes past the man to a hawthorn wand he knows all too well. He picks it up, sure that it practically purrs at him like an old friend. They’d done an incredible thing together, once upon a time. He’s unsurprised when it reveals only a handful of light charms and a counter-curse.
There it is again; the feeling that his heart and gut have traded places.
Harry glares around their side of the table at him. “No, this is a key to Draco’s own place—well, not-not the flat, I—it’s a cabin. Outside Rydal. The Lakes. I reckoned for writing retreats, getting away when you need a change of pace… do you… like it?”
house?”
Ron makes a face, stiff but complex, and Harry doesn’t exactly want to do this now, but he’s kept him waiting long enough, so he flicks his attention towards Hermione by the door. “Erm, I think it’s time we talk,” he tells Ron. She raises her eyebrows and drifts effortlessly from the room as though she naturally has somewhere better to be. In her absence, they both sit awkwardly, staring at the floor.
“The evidence is
“Yes, well it’s another thing entirely if you’ve gotten your bloody leg over.”
“Harry, I
“Everyone was stoking our egos, of course we were.”
Draco nods without looking at him and brushes through his hair, his left hand smoothing the path his comb traces with his right. Harry stretches his neck one way, the other, then stands with a yawn, extending his arms tall over his head. He crosses the couple feet between his bed and Draco’s and sits next to where his friend stands by the foot of it, forcing a mutual gaze.
“Feel free to continue being so.”
Sometimes, he did win when they grappled. The radio would be blasting and Harry would run through some helpful moves to keep on hand for escaping from underneath in ground fighting or maintaining dominance on top. Then they’d go a round or two.
He smiled when he saw a front-page article about the release of James Evans' newest book. Apparently, it hit the shelves that day and it was already on the best-seller list, thanks to pre-orders. It deserved to be, he thought flipping to the business section. He'd enjoyed it immensely, back before he knew James Evans was Gryffin and Gryffin was Harry.
He tucked the vial into a small box, blanketing it with charms to render it unbreakable. He layered on another spell that would respond only to Draco's magical signature, ensuring no one else could view the memory. He was positive he could trust Draco with this, but he didn't want to risk it falling into someone else's hands.
Harry buried his nose in his daughter's tufts of blonde hair, inhaling the sweet scent of baby that was more intoxicating than anything he'd ever smelled before. He loved Cal, and that wouldn't diminish one bit with the arrival of their daughter. He met Draco's eye, seeing nothing but love reflected back. He'd worried, back when Luna had first approached him, that Draco and Cal would be upset if he chose to have a child. He'd been blown away by their response – both father and son had been enthusiastic from the start.
Draco stepped out of the Floo, looking around curiously. He'd expected Blaise or Neville to meet him at St. Mungo's this morning, but he'd been surprised when Theo showed up instead. The other man helped him out of the fireplace, Draco's overnight bag slung over his shoulder.
Hermione shook her head, her warm brown eyes unsure.
Neville shook his head, casting a few diagnostic spells over a plant on Harry's table. It would be so much easier if he could just take Harry to see Draco, but he couldn't. Complicated wards and protections – similar to the Fidelius Charm – blanketed the chateau, and Neville was bound by an Unbreakable Vow not to speak of it or anyone who lived there. Everyone who knew about Cal had taken a similar vow, not that any of them would have divulged any information about the boy's existence. Not even to Harry.
"Thank you for coming today," Harry began, glaring at several reporters who started shouting questions about Cal. "I have a statement to give you, and after that will be available to answer a few questions. I will only answer
Severus studied his blushing godson for a moment longer.
"An open letter from the Savior of the Wizarding World about his mystery love interest, inside on Page 8!"
"You should thank Neville and Blaise too," he said easily, purposefully misinterpreting Draco's words. He knew the blond was talking about his role in bringing Cartwell down, but he really didn't want to talk about it. Not tonight, at least. "They spent all morning in there with me."
Remarkably, the thought of Malfoy's hand on his cock didn't cause its immediate deflation, as Harry had expected. Instead, he found his arousal ratchet up a notch.
Draco blinked. Harry got overwhelmed?
Harry sent another glare at the reporters when they began shouting out questions again, waiting until they had stopped before continuing. He murmured something in Hermione's ear, and she disappeared inside the house, returning with Draco and Carina.
Draco cut Harry's whispered words off quickly, placing his fingers over his husband's lips. This was something he wanted, and he knew Cal wanted it, too. He just hadn't realized Harry would want to do this so soon.

want to be talking with his godfather about Harry Potter wanking, especially with a hard-on himself.
Oliver laughed, shaking both Harry and Draco's hands before stepping back, making room for Daphne and Neville, whom were both gushing over the eternity bond.

coming in. Everything after that was a blur. Harry didn't know if he'd spoken to the blond at all.
"No, I did," Harry said absently, raising his hand to catch the shop keeper's attention. "Can you tell me a bit about this?"
Harry nodded, the hidden meaning in Blaise's innocuous words clear to him.
"Life's about taking chances, Harry. You could bollocks it up, or you could meet the love of your life. It's a risk you've got to be willing to take."
"No," Draco said calmly, Summoning a magazine from the table. "There's no relationship."
The dark-haired wizard whirled around, his jaw dropping when he looked at Neville. He wasn't sure if it was something he heard in the other man's voice, or something in his expression, but suddenly the realization that Neville knew exactly what was happening crashed down on him.
“Hermione?”
She merely shrugged, not looking the least bit ashamed of herself.
"No, not yet," Draco said, frowning slightly. "I'm not sure I'm ready, Blaise. What if he has a horrid reaction to my identity? I just don't want to lose whatever it is that we've got going on."
"He's fine. I just needed to clear my head a bit," Draco said, suppressing the urge to question Pansy about Gryffin's identity. He knew it would do nothing but frustrate both of them – she'd sworn an Unbreakable Vow. She couldn't tell him if she wanted to.
"I will, but I'll thank
"Well, your
He helped Blaise lower Ron onto the dark leather couch, taking care to keep him upright as they eased their arms back. When he was satisfied the redhead wouldn't fall, Blaise turned to Theo, watching as he struggled to get Harry up the stairs.
Harry grinned. Things were going fabulously well, if this basket was any indication.
between Harry James Potter and Draco Abraxas Malfoy and found both partners to have entered into the bond willingly and with no uncertainty or regret."
"I'm sorry," Hermione said, smiling uncomfortably. Harry and Draco were fifteen minutes late, and everyone was getting restless. "More tea?"
he thought uncharitably, his lower lip pouting ever so slightly.
"Merlin," he whispered when he'd freed the stone basin of its wrappings. He ran his hands around the cool soapstone, tracing the carved runes with the pads of his fingers. "It's amazing."
"She's perfect. Absolutely perfect, and one hundred percent yours," Luna said, her eyes sparkling with pride and unshed tears. "You two are excellent fathers, and I know she'll be loved and cherished."
Pansy nodded, her eyes still locked on his.
"You'll not get any sympathy from me, mate," Harry said knowingly. Ron had been an absolute bastard to Theo for years. The rest of the family had been cool to the Slytherin at first but had quickly warmed; by the time they married he had been welcomed into the Weasley family with open arms. Except for Ron, who was sure his three year courtship and six year marriage to Ginny was just the prelude to some sort of evil plot.
Ginny's head joined his in the fire, her features drawn.
The smile slid off Harry's face as he turned toward the voice, quickly replaced with the most civil expression he could muster.
were you thinking? I don't even want to
It was true. Harry wanted to get to know the real Sly, but he was having a good time exchanging emails and gifts with him, and he didn't want that to end. What if they didn't get along in person? Harry rubbed a hand across the back of his neck, gently squeezing try to dispel the tightness there.
"He's out with the team," she said after a moment, her expression reluctant. She clearly didn't want to have this conversation.
He hurried down the hall to his office, almost afraid to check his email. He expected a few angry missives – surely Gryffin wasn't so patient that he'd let a five-day absence go unchecked, especially since Draco had promised he'd only be out of contact for a few days at most.
Draco looked away, studiously avoiding eye contact with the other patrons. He didn't understand the compulsion to sit in a room with dozens of other men watching women undress. Dozens of
? And where the hell were you this morning?"
funny. But what are we going to do about it? They're getting more and more attached, and it's going to blow up in their faces when they find out."
"Harry Potter in the Chamber of Secrets with the Sword of Gryffindor," she said after a long pause, nodding confidently.
at least, will join me at the club?"
"Shouldn't you tell Malfoy –"
he thought wryly, mentally berating Blaise for being as emotionally closed-off as Draco.
“The key to the spell is visualization,” Draco said, his voice bored. Theo knew better, though. Draco was always willing to do whatever necessary to help his friends, he just didn’t like anyone to know that. “Unlike most Transfigurations, this one draws from your mental conception of the end goal. Get a clearer picture in your mind and you’ll get a better result.”
done something? Where would that leave his relationship with him? A note stuck to the screen caught Harry's attention, and he leaned over to grab it.
"There's no ice here, Uncle Blaise," he said, his brow furrowed.
"Do you think I should tell him now?" Harry asked, his fingers absently worrying the fraying fabric on the arm of the chair.
"It's Mr. Potter-Black for me, as well," he said, smirking when the man actually flinched when he looked at him. "Harry and I aren't just married, we share an eternity bond."
"None of my concern," Draco said quickly, holding up his hands to stop her. "It's moot, anyway. I've met someone. It's still in the early stages, but I think it could really work out."
"I don't understand," Harry said, his brow furrowed. He heard the ceiling collapse around them, stepping back so he could make out Draco's words.
"Get off," Blaise muttered, giving Draco a half-hearted shove.
"Activation phrase?" He asked the man, holding up the medallion still clenched in his fist.
"I know you want to come back to Wiltshire, but I need you to stay there, Cal," Draco said, pinching the bridge of his nose. He was crouched uncomfortably in front of the fire in his study, trying to reason with an increasingly hysterical Caleum.
Hermione accepted the mug of coffee Harry extended toward her, folding her legs beneath her as she sat in the large, comfy chair he offered. She pulled his computer into her lap, balancing the mug on the arm of the chair.
He sighed in relief when his name and family seal appeared next to Harry's. He felt Harry squeeze his hand reassuringly, though he knew the man had harbored similar fears.
"I haven't had the chance to say it, but thank you," Draco said softly, settling into a chair a safe distance away from Harry's.
"Harry James Potter-Black, Head of the House of Potter, you have petitioned the Ministry to adopt Caleum Alexander Malfoy. Is this your wish?"
A short, stocky man fell to the ground, frozen by Ron's quick
Draco's eyes narrowed as he watched Potter gape. He needed to wipe the surprised look off Potter's face and get the idiot to close his mouth before he did something rash. Like taste those deliciously parted lips.
: MustLoveQuidditch
Draco sighed, pushing the bedclothes back and easing himself up, careful not to jostle Cal. They'd had another epic bedtime battle the night before, so he was sure he needed the extra sleep. The house-elves had already laid out tea for him, and Draco shuffled through the door to his private sitting room to read the morning papers. They had all taken Harry's letters seriously – no word about Harry or his courtship had made it into any of the papers Draco or his solicitors were monitoring. There had been a few small pieces about Draco's retreat from London, and some gossip about Malfoy Industries hitting hard times, as evidenced by his desertion of his role as chairman. Draco snorted, picking up the
"I'm not just anyone, and that's fabulous," he said, truly happy for his friends. Neville and Daphne had married less than a year after he had. Initially, Draco had questioned his friend's decision, but as he got to know Nev, he began to see the same brave, beautiful, courageous man Daphne did. "Really. I'm thrilled for you two. When is she due?"
"Your father is with the Aurors now, so he's safe. And your
Harry shifted Teddy's warm weight in his arms, pressing his face into the curve of his sleeping godson's neck. He wasn't sure what had caused Malfoy's sudden departure, but he was sure about one thing: there had been an air of finality about it that made something inside of him clench and throb. Harry blinked as he felt the hot prick of tears behind his eyes, and he swallowed thickly, unwilling to let himself think about the fact that the burning he felt in his chest was unlike the emotions Malfoy usually stirred in him. He wouldn't think about how his heart had lurched when he saw the Slytherin in the shadows, or how that joy had turned to something much more complicated when he'd seen the naked hunger in those smoky grey eyes. Most of all, Harry wouldn't think about the burning, tearing pain in his chest when Malfoy turned away, which had felt remarkably like his heart shattering. Because it wouldn't do any good to think about any of those things, Harry's rational mind insisted, since he wasn't attracted to Malfoy in the first place.
He looked up at his fathers, hesitating briefly. He'd paid special attention to his Astronomy lessons with
"Figured it out, did you?"
"Oh God," Harry groaned, his hands fisting in the fabric of the sofa. It was too good, too much. Draco's talented mouth, combined with the aftereffects of the binding spell, had Harry spiraling toward his climax much too soon.
He looked at her blankly, his eyes traveling around the kitchen until he found a clock.
The blond ignored him, casting several diagnostic charms over him instead. Draco called for Madge, asking her to bring the wizard a glass of water.
"You've no business being here, Mr. Zabini," she scolded, making sure he drank the water she'd brought him. "You should be home in bed."
"I'm in a relationship now. I didn't want the press to interfere."
," he continued, his voice barely audible as he circled Draco's heart with the tip of his wand. "
Draco swallowed, unsure of what to say. Neville grabbed Harry by the robes, forcing him back onto the sofa while he tipped a vial of potion up to his lips.
He sighed, closing his eyes again as his mouth opened. "The Malfoy Chateau in Amboise, France."
Harry looked up when Narcissa swept into the room. She still looked every bit the haughty pure-blood he'd thought she was, though he'd learned the public persona was quite different from the caring and warm
Ron smiled in spite of himself, still angry with Harry for putting himself in such a dangerous position. "I wouldn't count on it," he said with a sharp laugh. "More like Harry Potter: The Boy Who Was Killed By Hermione."
She blushed slightly, and Draco knew he had been forgiven. She closed the door firmly behind her as she left.
"I'm not saying it wasn't," Harry answered, shoving his uneaten dinner away. "I'm just saying it was a surprise."
“Yes, I know. But she’s been so much more fun lately that it’s easy to forget.”
? Harry's heart slammed against his ribs, and he was suddenly very, very glad for Bill's Sobriety spell. He'd had a disturbing dream about the blond bastard the night before, no doubt caused by their accidental meeting and the fabulous but not-quite-fulfilling wank he and Sly had shared later. He'd written off his earlier appearance at the joke shop as a fluke, but now he had to consider the truth: Fate hated him.
The smoky world around them swirled, the cool mist solidifying into a familiar Hogwarts scene. They were standing on a moving staircase, which deposited them in front of a large, scarred door.
Draco just nodded absently, the words not registering until Blaise had already jumped up from the chair. He nearly made it through the still-open door before Draco's mild Stinging Hex caught him on the arse, the slight pain not enough to wipe the smirk off his face.
Neville burst into the room, ready to pull Teddy and Caleum apart if he had to. From the ruckus he'd heard from the other room, he was sure the two boys were at each other's throats. He skidded to a stop in the middle of Draco's study, shocked to see the bickering boys sitting next to each other, Teddy's arm wrapped around Cal's thin shoulders, arguing with a portrait.
A few of you were worried because I hadn't updated in a few days. It's not the start of a new trend, I promise you. A bad bout of the stomach flu swept through the dracosoftie household, and caring for a vomiting toddler and husband whilst vomiting yourself just isn't very conducive to writing boylove.
"No, thank you," Kingsley said, crossing his legs as he settled into the comfortable sofa. He'd arrived a little early, thinking the two young men would be anxious to sign the contract and get started on the next phase of their lives. Harry hadn't told anyone Kingsley would be the one to administer the contract, but no one had been terribly surprised when he'd turned up. It would ensure the privacy Harry and Draco needed, since they knew they could count on Kingsley to keep a secret.
, Harry thought, the sight of Draco's erection pressing against his wool trousers making Harry's own cock twitch painfully.
. He could see a future with Caleum and Draco.
She smiled weakly, a sick feeling blossoming in her stomach. She grasped for a subject change, babbling about the problems Hermione was having finding the types of flowers she wanted, which were apparently out of season in Great Britain this time of year, and the snit Molly was in because they'd insisted on having the reception catered instead of letting her take care of it.
"Seriously, Hermione, I think I have carpal tunnel," Harry whined, repeating the charm for what surely must have been the hundredth time.
Harry snorted, shaking his head. "Glad I left the Harry Potter part off, since his reaction to James Evans was bad enough."
Draco was thrashing against the restraining hands of a mediwizard who was currently pinning him to the bed, weak but determined to get to his son. He'd woken up a few minutes ago, disoriented and in a lot of pain, but the moment he'd seen the grim Auror guarding the door everything had rushed back. The questioning, the pain of trying to resist, the moment he gave away his son's existence, the blissful rush of unconsciousness.
"Exclusive story! Auror charged with stalking!" A photo of a beaming Weasley holding a magically bound and extremely irate Smith showed the duo walking into the Ministry at the center of a crowd of other Aurors.
, he thought, blinking when he saw Harry shiver slightly.
Neville sighed, casting a longing glance at his own plate of cooling eggs before answering.
He lifted the box carefully, placing it on the low table in front of Harry. "For you."
They'd shared a lot of mundane facts about themselves, arguing back and forth about wine and favorite foods, trading jokes and tidbits of their daily lives that wouldn't give them away. Harry was still laughing about the anecdote Sly had told him about his secretary last week – by all rights, it sounded like
He stood when everyone else did, gathering up his notes and the dog-eared manuscript. He could tell he was in for a lecture from Hermione, since her back was ram-rod straight and her smile forced as she accepted thanks and congratulations from nearly a dozen different people as they made their way out of the publishing offices.
Draco smiled weakly, opening his lips this time when Seamus held the draughts up to them. He swallowed them quickly, reassured by Harry's words and eager to stop the buzzing in his head.
"I think you have the flu or something," Draco said, frowning.
"I won't finalize the contract until you do," Harry said, his tone laced with warning. Until the marriage contract was signed, there would be no sex. And Harry didn't want to have sex with Draco before the blond knew everything there was to know about Harry's involvement in the war.
Harry's mouth dropped open in shock. How could she just walk away from Cal? The boy was perfect. His heart broke for the worry and pain his mother's abandonment must still cause him.
"Do you really think

"Mr. Malfoy? Your personal owl is here for you, sir," Madge sounded slightly put out. "He won't allow me to take the package he is carrying."
," he continued, repeating the same motion against his own forehead.
He briefly considered calling Kreacher to make him a sandwich then changed his mind, throwing a pinch of Floo powder into the fireplace instead.
"Well?" Hermione asked, tapping her foot as she watched him.

He was unprepared for the jolt of magic that wrapped around him. It was so unlike what he'd experienced in the promissory ceremony with Patrizia. He'd felt the tingle of the ancient magic then, but nothing like this. He could
Nothing he'd imagined prepared him for what he saw on the front page. Draco's eyes widened in shock as he read the headlines.
Nev nodded, his eyes sparkling with excitement even as his mind whirled. As happy as he was to have shared his news, he wasn't about to let Draco distract him from his original purpose – to find out what had the blond so upset. Blaise had Fire-called an hour ago to let him know Draco was on his way to France, apparently disturbed over something his online mystery man had said the night before.
He opened his mouth, unable to find any words to refute her statements.
Neville looked troubled at Snape's words, but was reassured when Cal jumped up from the floor hugging his legs.
"I, Draco Abraxas Malfoy, Head of the most Ancient and Noble House of Malfoy and Heir to the most Ancient and Noble House of Black do freely and gladly accept the yoke of a magical bond with Harry James Potter," he said, noting with pride that his signature also registered in silver before fading to black.
He sat back heavily, feeling utterly drained. Harry grinned as he realized he'd screamed Sly's name as he came, wondering if the other man had done the same.
"Er, Malfoy. Oh hell, Pans, you know what I mean," Harry said, blowing out a breath.
"I think I know," Ron said carefully, piecing everything together in his head. Everything he knew about Sly. Everything he knew about Malfoy.
This wasn't about Cal going off to Hogwarts, not entirely. He was just so worried about what the press would do when they found out who Cal was, and by extension, that Harry and Draco were married. They'd enjoyed several blissful years without the spotlight of the media on them, but that would all change in just a few minutes.
"I'll Owl you later to fill you in," Draco said, nodding to the wizard before he closed the connection. He had some paperwork he needed to look over if he was to present this himself.
"Er, no, Mr. Wedgewick," Draco said, his gaze still locked on Harry. "I'm afraid I don't make it to the club anymore."
"As the Head of your respective families, the contract has recognized your right to swear your intent and has accepted those promises. You will hereafter be bound to each other for a period of thirty-six months. If after this time you are unwilling or unable to marry, the bonds will dissolve."
"No, but thank you, Madge. This was just a bit of personal business," he said, sounding as though he had never sent her or other employees on personal errands.
"Shall we?" Neville asked, cocking his head toward the sofa. Harry and Draco could sit next to each other, and he'd take the chair next to it, close enough to intervene if necessary but far enough away to allow them to comfort each other.
Harry wondered, his stomach clenching at the sound of uncontrollable giggling outside his door. His brief reprieve was over.
"No," Draco said firmly, sliding a few more Galleons across the table to the pouting witch. They disappeared quickly, and so did she, sauntering off to another table. "You'll thank me in the morning, trust me."
"What should we do with him?" Blaise asked, inclining his head toward Ron, who had also drifted off.
Hermione stroked Theo’s balls lightly, teasing every last bit of come out of him. After all, he’d definitely earned his reward, even if a blow job wasn’t what she’d initially had in mind. Hannah had said the party was still going on, though, which meant she’d be able to sneak him back to her room – being the Head Girl had
"Master Draco…" Chessie let the word trail off, her voice pleading.
Pansy lingered in the doorway, unsure of what to do. Unlike Harry, she knew exactly who had sent that basket. And unlike the sender, she also knew exactly who it had gone to. Could Draco really be falling for Harry Potter? It must be serious if he had cooked for him; Draco was a fabulous cook, but he only bothered to share his gift with those he truly cared for.
" – three
Hermione choked off a suggestive laugh, running her bare foot up Theo’s leg to ensure his other wand was raised as well.
"We all did so willingly," Neville said softly, shaking his head to wave away Draco's apology.
"I can't believe you sent him the manuscript, Harry," she chided, her voice stern. She really didn't like where this was heading – if Harry didn't fess up to his identity soon, this Sly person might never forgive him. "You should have told him you are James Evans. He's going to be mortified that he's gushed over it when he finds out
"Not just us!" Cal piped up, hopping further down the corridor. A door creaked open and Percy's oldest daughter, Molly, hopped out. The seven year old bounced down the corridor to Harry, her tight red ringlets jumping with each movement.
"Harry James Potter, Head of the House of Potter and Head of the House of Black, your magic has accepted that of your chosen partner. Do you accept the awesome burden of your newly forged bond?"
Draco groaned, letting the curtain fall back into place. The hat had just placed Elphias Abbott in Hufflepuff, so he figured they had time to rehash this old argument for the last time.

Ron could see two shadows around the corner, and he motioned for Harry to stop. They waited a few beats, jumping into action as soon as the shadows turned the corner.
: MustLoveQuidditch
He arched a brow at Blaise, who was looking a bit worse for the wear himself. Theo was completely pissed, though not as far gone as Potter or Weasley. The dragon tamer was chatting up a dancer at another table, surrounded by several other of Potter's Gryffindor classmates.
Both Harry and Ron agreed, taking a step closer to Blaise.
Harry was worried about Ron. The wizard had been staring at him all morning, and it was a bit concerning.
Harry slid his hand into his pocket, grabbing the silicone spatula by its wooden handle. He was a bit of a gadget buff, and his kitchen was stocked with Muggle appliances and tools. He slapped the flexible yellow head against his open palm, a wicked grin stealing across his face.
"I am confident Mr. Malfoy will be able to help you, Madam," he said politely, flashing her his most irresistible grin. "I'm so glad we had the chance to chat. He has a habit of monopolizing our most charming clients."
"Well, I'm glad
Draco blew out a breath, laughing. He let Harry lead him to the sofa, pulling a small vial of swirling silver mist out of his pocket. He shared a look with Harry, nodding resolutely before uncorking the vial and tipping it into the basin.

spell on nondescript bracelets, combining it with a slightly modified Sensilis Potion that would heighten the drinker's sensitivity to touch.
He shook his head ruefully, finally removed enough from the memories to feel sorry for his ex-wife. She'd married him hoping for an exciting life filled with luxury and entertainment, and she'd ended up saddled with a baby and a disinterested husband.
"He loved it, and so did I. In the future, though, don't buy him anything live without checking with me first."
"He seems to know a lot about babies," she added, looking over his shoulder to watch as Caleum carefully pressed a kiss to the sleeping girl's forehead.
Draco opened the box, holding his breath as he delved inside, batting away the layers of gauzy cloth wrapped around the heavy object. He was surprised at how small it was, expecting something two or three times its size given the weight of the box.

"I can't help it," Harry muttered, his brow creased in a deep frown. "He's so young. We should have held him out a year. He's only ten!"
The stylist nodded, shortening Harry's blond hair with a few deft snips. Flaxen strands fell to the floor, the uneven cut transforming Harry's face. He watched, fascinated, as the shape of the new cut emerged. He

Pansy snickered, her chest shuddering as she tried to hold back more laughter.

was at his wit's end with the wanker. He had the benefit of knowing that the blond pulled himself behind this mask of distain and aloofness when he was truly hurting, but Potter didn't know that. It had been so obvious that Potter had been excited to see Draco, but the prat hadn't been able to see past what he had considered an affirmation of the
"Now stop stalling and check the blasted e-mail account. I'm dying over here," he said with a grin.
"Sir, is there something I can help you with?" Madge asked, eying the oddly-shaped package.
"Enough pleasantries," Kingsley said after he'd let Harry regain his balance. "I imagine you gentlemen are in a bit of a hurry to speed things along. Shall we?"

He stood, pushing his chair back and making his way into the kitchen to brew some coffee. He loved tea, but situations like this one called for coffee, he thought. He was two days out from his final deadline, and he had no clear plan of attack. He couldn't focus. His mind slipped back to Sly's latest email, and Harry laughed as he pictured a pre-teen Sly with a loyal Crup tagging along behind him. He had no way of knowing what Sly looked like now, let alone then, but his imagination was rich.
: A dramatic turn, but we're still only a few chapters away from fluffy smut, I promise. But hey, at least Harry knows about Cal now …
"Longbottom cottage."
"It's not as bad as all that, surely," a disembodied voice called out, startling Draco from his reverie.
Draco's eyes narrowed and he reached out and pulled his laptop away from Blaise, who raised his hands in defense and adopted an innocent look.
Harry grinned, pressing a quick kiss to Draco's lips before turning back to the crowd.
"Cool it," Blaise said, waving the increasingly worried house-elf away. He'd given her explicit instructions not to let Draco leave without him, and she'd popped in to tell him Draco was home moments ago. "He's with us. Doing better, then? All healed? No lingering side effects?"
Pansy's brow furrowed in confusion. Draco had gone on about how much he admired Harry Potter? She honestly couldn't reconcile the statement with anything she knew of Draco.
He unfurled the scroll, his tight expression easing at the single word elegantly scratched across the page.
He studied the man, sure he knew him but uncertain how. "Harry Fire-called a few minutes ago. He said to tell you 'Weasley is our king'."
? he wondered, the large sip of Firewhisky he took burning a path down his throat. Once he managed to get past his initial reaction – horror – he could see it. They were different, but in complementary ways. They both hated large crowds and tried to stay out of the public eye, happy to stay in reading or watching a film. They both loved wine and gourmet food. They were both well-known in the wizarding world, and both shunned their fame. Draco doted on his son, and Harry wanted a family.
"I'm not sure how he found out about it, but it's a perfectly legitimate law," Neville put in, answering for Harry since the other man was currently chewing.
Draco looked up, his expression slightly censorious, but lacking the venom Pansy was expecting.
"Feeling a bit rough, are we?" he asked, smirking as he dropped a bag of sandwiches in Blaise's lap.
The bird nipped at him impatiently as his sleep-numbed fingers struggled to untie the scroll on its leg. The owl clearly wasn't any more pleased with its early-morning task than Harry was; he'd only gotten to sleep an hour earlier. He grumbled at the bird darkly before letting it go, slamming the window shut without watching it soar away into the inky blackness outside his window.
"First time," Draco murmured, sucking hard against Harry's neck while he thrust his hips into him roughly, eliciting a long moan from the dark-haired wizard. "Second time," he continued, punctuating his words with another hard thrust. "Third time," he gasped, panting as he thrust again, the resultant friction almost too much to bear.
Harry whimpered, squeezing his eyes shut as a wave of nausea swept over him at the thought. He fumbled in the medicine cabinet, his hands closing over the last bottle of Hangover Potion. He spared a quick glance for Ron – still passed out cold in the tub – before uncorking it and downing it in one gulp. He could always go out to buy another for Ron later. This was an

"Why have you been living in France, Malfoy?"
The dark-haired wizard squirmed, feeling foggy from oversleeping. They'd spent the entire night making love, finally falling asleep sometime around dawn. He looked out the window, frowning at the pitch-black expanse outside. He had no idea what time it was, but he was sure it was late – probably the middle of the night.
. "Yes, I know."
He was too tired to think straight, so he was clearly in no condition to respond to Gryffin's email. But the man had been waiting nearly a week for a reply, and it seemed unconscionably cruel to put him off any longer. Besides, Draco's exhaustion leveled the playing field; it made him nearly as vulnerable as Gryffin had been when he wrote his last email half-drunk.

"It's hardly your fault, Malfoy," he said, his voice laced with sympathy. No one down at the Ministry actually believed the charges that had been levied against Draco and his company, but all formal complaints had to be thoroughly investigated. "I'm sorry for the disruption this is causing. We'll be out from underfoot soon."
"I'm not exactly likely to have one of my own, Ron, being that the thought of sleeping with a woman is revolting," Harry said with a grimace, smiling apologetically at Hermione. "My only other option is to adopt or find a partner who already has a child."
Harry had passed on the dessert, choosing instead to have a third glass of the smoky Pinot Noir Sly sent to accompany the meal. It paired perfectly with the tender grilled salmon with a slightly spicy chili Hollandaise sauce that had been the main course. The meal began with delicate buckwheat blinis piled with caviar and crème fraîche, the perfect combination of salty and creamy, followed by a rich leek soup. Sly's choice of Pinot Noir had gone perfectly with each course, surprising Harry. The light-bodied wine was one of his favorites, but he had never paired it with fish before. The smoky spiciness of the wine had been the perfect complement, however, and Harry let his mouthful of wine rest of his palate for a moment before swallowing, picking out notes of tart cranberry and spicy clove.
It was unexpected that our lives would already be so intertwined without our knowledge.
Draco shivered, feeling cold and bereft as soon as Harry leaned back, instantly missing his closeness and heat. He looked at Cal, who was racing around the small pond, his hands out as though he were flying, laughing gleefully as his cloak billowed out behind him.
Harry clenched his jaw, reeling in the flare of pure magical energy that fought to escape at the words. He'd attained marvelous control over his magic since the defeat of Voldemort, but he still struggled with bursts of wild magic when he was angry or tired. Right now, he was both.
"Mmm," Harry moaned appreciatively when Draco's cool hand slid into his pajama bottoms, wrapping around his erection.

Of Malfoy. Holding Ron in his seat while he waved a very beautiful – and mostly blurred out – naked witch away. Harry was visible in the background, quite obviously asleep with his head on the table. The table that looked – Harry squinted, leaning closer to the photo – like it was covered in something sticky. Like a spilled drink.
"Just a little Sleeping Draught," she said with a smirk. Ron raised an eyebrow, and she grinned. "Alright, alright. It was a Calming Draught mixed with Dreamless Sleep. God knows I don't want to be awakened by anymore of his dreams," she said, blushing as she looked away from the sleeping man.
Draco swallowed hard, worried he wouldn't be able to force the binding words out of his mouth. Harry squeezed his hand again, and he felt Cal's small hand slide into his as well.
Harry nodded, shrugging. It was true. He knew how foolish this situation was – what if Sly ended up being some lothario? What if he wasn't anything like he seemed in his emails? He'd allowed himself to get emotionally entangled with a complete stranger.
Hermione frowned, squinting at Harry's image in the mirror in front of them. The stylist hovered nearby, scissors raised, waiting for the verdict.
. I think your sister wants you to cut her dear husband a break. It has been nearly six years, after all, and he's managed not to poison or hex her yet. She may well be safe after all, eh?" he asked with a grin.
Sensing that Draco was overwhelmed, Harry reached out for Cal, pulling the boy down into the snow so he could help him with his skates. Draco followed suit, the cold bite of the snow under him as he sat helping him gain control of his emotions.
Harry read the short email for the fourth time while sipping a gorgeous glass of Shiraz from the bottle Sly had sent. Pansy sent it over via owl earlier that day. Harry had been so excited he hardly knew what to do with himself. He'd never had such a thoughtful gift, not even from lovers he had dated for months.
"To skate," Harry confirmed, answering Draco's nearly forgotten question. The blond's mind went absolutely blank at the electric thrill of Harry's warm breath against his skin, all cohesive thought fleeing at the tantalizing almost-contact. Draco heard someone – probably Blaise – clear his throat across the ice, reminding him of their presence. "To date. To get to know each other. To share our lives."
Hermione heard the Floo roar to life just as she was putting the finishing touches on dinner. As she was finishing plating the takeaway, at any rate, which in a way could be considered making dinner, she reasoned. She grabbed a dish towel to wipe a stray bit of curry from her hands and walked into the sitting room.
Draco smiled, and Harry was blown away by the love and relief he saw in the blond's usually closed-off expression.
look so happy, after all?
"I think I fucked it up," Draco said, his head buried in his hands. Blaise crossed his legs, waiting for the blond to explain. "He told me he's James Evans, and I freaked out."
"I don't mind," Draco said, flipping through the pages. It really
"I love Harry Potter."
"That was the idea," Harry said with a small smile, giving everyone a tired wave as he entered the room. Both he and Draco looked exhausted, and Neville didn't look much better off. Kingsley stood immediately, striding over to grasp his hand.
"Everything is in order," he said, his voice taking on the slightly officious tone he used for Ministry business. "Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy, please take your places here," he said indicating a tall table Harry had placed there earlier for that purpose.
she was around the chateau.
"I'm not going to hex him," Draco said shortly, resuming his pacing without regard for the wizard now standing in his path.
Caleum was fine, thank Merlin. Draco insisted that he remain at the Amboise chateau, which was where he spent most of his time, despite the fact that he had begged to be allowed to come home with Draco. Draco wanted to keep him out of the papers, to keep their relationship a secret for as long as he could. He didn't want to be associated with Caleum in the wizarding press, and he took all manner of precautions to prevent it. The chateau was Unplottable, and Caleum always used the Floo when he came to Malfoy Manor. Draco had managed to keep him a secret for five years, and he prayed to all the Gods each day that his luck continued to hold.
"No, none," he said, his voice a bit scratchy with disuse. He wasn't allowed a very active role in the editing process. As Hermione had said, it was a miracle he was there at all, and only because she'd insisted. He hadn't had the privilege the first few times around, but as a best-selling novelist, he had some pull now. "Thank you. It's fabulous. Brilliant work, everyone."
"First year, the Philosopher's Stone," he said, going on to explain the horrors he'd faced as a boy of eleven with no one but his two best friends at his side, the first of several encounters with Voldemort Harry had placed in the vial.
"This is bone china and crystal, Harry," she said, shaking her head and plunging her hands into the suds. "Scourgify is too rough for delicate pieces like these. You obviously want to keep them, so that leaves the old-fashioned way."
They'd lost an entire crop of grapes their first year, thanks to inexperience and an unseasonably cool spring with a late frost. Neville had researched like a madman after that, even more determined to make the winery a success after the initial setback. And he had.
could really learn from that attitude."
"Devastated Auror caught in love triangle between Boy-Who-Lived and Puddlemere Keeper!" the headline screamed, accompanied by a picture of a distraught-looking Smith shielding his face as he left a restaurant.
"It will," he said, serious now. "You and Molly have done a fabulous job, and Fleur will be there directing everything. The dress is gorgeous, and you'll be stunning. You know Ron's just as excited as you are."
They worked together in comfortable silence for a few more minutes, putting the finishing touches on the meal. He mixed everything together with the pasta and drizzled the sauce over top, rolling his eyes when Ginny gave an exaggerated sniff of delight and pretended to swoon over the finished product.
"He seems brilliant, Draco. Have you made plans to meet yet?" Blaise knew full well they hadn't, but he'd been nudging Draco in that direction for weeks.
Kingsley laid the contract down on the table, tapping it twice with his wand over the Ministry Seal. The seal glowed deep purple, accepting him as an official with the authority to oversee the oath.
"That's not what normally happens," he whispered, his lips grazing her ear as he spoke.
spells on it, all sealed in place with a
"No," Blaise said again, turning back to Ron. "Not until we're certain Cal is safe. The Aurors guarding the room will tell him soon, no doubt. We need to go."
"You have no appreciation for tradition," Harry chided, lifting his hips obediently when Draco started to pull the silk over his hips.
Incarcerous
Ron cut him off, smiling smugly as he took a forkful of Harry's rice. It was an intentionally casual gesture, meant to show the other man that their conversation was over. "Oh, Harry wasn't at the wedding alone, Zach," he said, taking a bite to let the wizard have a few moments to mull his statement over. "He was there with someone he's
She turned toward Neville and his shoulder sagged. He shouldn't have opened his mouth. He knew what Hermione was like when she didn't understand something: ruthless.
Instead, he felt curiously sad to see him go, disappointed to have ended their brief but barbed conversation. He shook his head as though trying to clear the inappropriate thought, stepping in to place a form similar to Potter's on Pansy's desk. Potter was gone, and that was what mattered, he reminded himself.
"Now get to work."
Harry stood quickly, throwing a signed document on Pansy's desk – his official request to be removed from the site.
Draco fidgeted with his cuff links, clenching his hands and forcing them to his sides when he caught himself. Malfoys did
"I appreciate that, I do," he said, holding up a hand to prevent Hermione from interrupting him. "But I'm hardly a conventional bloke, am I? I'm enjoying myself. I've never had the chance to get to know a potential partner slowly like this; they always know everything about me before I know anything about them."
Draco stood, not noticing the gobsmacked expression on Neville's face.
"It's just for a few minutes, then we can go have fun," Harry said with an easy smile. He'd been a lot easier to be around after Draco had accepted his courtship offer two days ago.
"How's your replacement doing?" Harry asked warily. Ginny had not been pleased when McGonagall and Pomfrey had banned her from flying just two months into her pregnancy, something rather integral to the job of flying instructor. She had taken over for Madam Hooch several years ago after retiring from the Holyhead Harpies.
He sighed, pushing his hair out of his face. It had gotten too long, but he was reluctant to cut it. A bunch of imbeciles had taken to copying his hairstyle, even going so far as to name it
The wedding was in two weeks, on Christmas Day. Harry knew it was a risk to invite so many people, but he truly trusted every one of the friends they were inviting. The location of the chateau would remain a secret, entrusted only to those few who already knew. The invitations were Portkeys that would bring their guests directly to the ballroom where they were having the ceremony and reception.
Cal hesitated, then placed his own in Harry's larger palm, shaking his hand. "My name is Caleum Malfoy."

Pansy held up a wicker basket when Harry opened the door. He was surprised to see her on his doorstep, and she looked a little uncomfortable being there herself.
"Today we witness the joining of a silver-bonded pair," Kingsley said, his deep voice reverent. "As is their right as a couple of such distinction, Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Potter have chosen an eternity bond. Few in the wizarding world are granted the opportunity to even consider such a bond, and fewer still have chosen to invoke one."

and you still weren't here!"
He sighed loudly, hitting the refresh button on his email once more. He had plenty of new messages in the inbox, but none from the only bloke he was interested in hearing from.
"Pansy, you know he's one of my favorite authors. You don't have to play dumb – he's already admitted he's James Evans. You won't be breaking the vow," he said, exasperated.
Can't watch."
"Should be –" Harry threw his head back, losing his train of thought when Draco ground against him, the heat of his erection evident even through their trousers. " – romantic –" Harry gasped when he felt Draco's hands slide down his bare back, slipping beneath the waistband of his trousers and cupping his bare arse. " – the first time."
"You know it, too," she said, her eyes sad. "You're half-way to in love with him, and you don't even know who he is."
Harry hated Netspeak.
"Age?"
much involved with."
"Illegal to interfere?" Hermione still wasn't sure what bearing that had on Harry's pursuit of Draco.
Theo cleared his throat, biting back a moan when Hermione’s hand fisted up and down his rock hard shaft. Clearly, his reward was going to proceed, audience or not.
Blaise watched Draco stare morosely into the flames – normal flames, which meant he'd warded the Floo. Apparently, Draco had known they'd be having it out tonight and had taken precautions against interruptions, he thought wryly.
Harry jumped up after reading his e-mail, hurrying to the fireplace and throwing in a pinch of Floo dust.
Head of the House of Black
"Must Love Quidditch," Blaise read. "That one could be something, yeah? Open it up so we can see more."
"Abraxas Wedgewick, president of the board, will read the agenda," she said, folding her hands primly in her lap as she discarded the gavel.
Teddy's presence helped calm Harry's nerves, which was why the boy had been at Grimmauld Place all day and was spending the night. Draco wasn't due until the early afternoon the next day, and the Ministry official would be a few hours behind him. Hermione didn't think they had a prayer of keeping Harry in line until then without his godson's help.
, Harry thought, wincing when he noticed the blond head bob in agreement at something Ron had said. Probably inviting him to join them at their next stop, the strip club that had Bill so worried.
She heard a low groan from the kitchen, quickening her pace until she found the source – Harry, head down on the table, a mostly empty bottle of Ogden's Best and an overturned glass next to him. Her concern turned to anger, her lips tightening as she took in the scene in front of her.
"I appreciate it, Draco," Theo said, turning his head to murmur something to his wife.
asked Harry if it would be alright for the shop to carry a similar product, since he figured Harry's idea would appeal to more than a few wizards out there.
He rubbed his eyes, hoping to dispel the muddiness in his mind before reading the missive. He'd waited for hours for any word at all from Draco, finally giving in after midnight and retiring to his room to toss and turn for two hours before sleep finally claimed him.

Seamus lifted the vial again, huffing out a frustrated breath when Draco's lips stayed firmly closed.

"Can you Transfigure that to look like the picture?" he asked, nodding to the items on her desk.
She nodded woodenly, saying her goodbyes before extinguishing the fire. If Draco had reacted that badly to finding out his mystery man was James Evans, what in Merlin's name would he do when he found out he was actually Harry Potter?
Harry held the vial of swirling grey smoke in his palm, realizing he was taking a huge step. He'd repressed these memories for so long it was almost as though they had happened to someone else. His muscles felt tight and shaky, and he wiped away a stray tear absently with his fist. It was important that Draco knew these things. That part of Harry's life was over, but it would never truly be gone.
with my other clients, Harry. I've tried to coddle you lately, since I know you're excited about this mystery man and the anonymous relationship you two seem to be starting. But it can't interfere with your work – I won't let it. You have a deadline next week, and you still haven't finished the manuscript. I know you have three best-sellers under your belt, Harry, but Abigail won't wait."
"We're coming in," Harry called, holding Draco's hand tightly in his own as they made their way to the study. He was both relieved and alarmed to see Ron standing next to her, both of them nearly pressed against the wall.
"That's a Slytherin way of approaching it, I suppose," she said, leaning forward to encourage him to continue.
Thankfully, he hadn't been awakened by one of the erotic dreams he'd been having about Harry this time. He felt his heart speed up at the memory of the dreams, which had become more explicit as the courtship wore on.
Draco laughed aloud when Harry's latest gift arrived, utterly delighted. It was the perfect companion to the gift he'd received yesterday.
Kingsley stood, grinning widely.
should be working."
Neville grinned, shrugging. His confidence had blossomed in the years since the war, and he'd grown into a self-assured – even cocky, at times – man. Especially when it came to things he was an expert in, namely plants and his friends.
"You're not," Draco said sharply, sitting his lunch aside to examine Blaise more closely. He pushed the man's feet off the low coffee table, crouching next to him to place a cool hand against his feverish forehead.
"Isn't that a bit much?" Draco asked, a smile lighting his face when the tall, dark-haired man came into view.
Hermione shot Theo a wicked grin before slithering under the table. As soon as she was situated between his thighs she snaked a hand up to grab her bag. A second later he thrust her book under the table as well.
"I don't
Harry laughed, the tense moment broken by Draco's petulant tone.
skim off the top, Malfoy?"
He'd barely been back in London for 20 minutes when an emergency Fire-call had come from France. Caleum had taken a nasty spill off a horse at the Malfoy chateau in Amboise where he had been staying. Draco hadn't even wasted time packing; he'd simply jumped into the Floo to get to Caleum's side as quickly as possible. That had been four days ago, and he was only now returning home.
"Aren't you –"
"So you know?" she asked him, eyeing him with concern.
Blaise winked at Draco as he retreated from the room, pausing again to smirk as he pointedly glanced at Draco's crotch, raising an eyebrow. The blond blushed, both embarrassed that the darker wizard had heard his earlier spell and grateful he'd had the sense to delay Madam Atalier in the corridor until it had time to work.
Draco clenched his teeth biting down so hard his jaw ached. It had been more of a statement than a question, and he hoped the potion would let him keep his silence. The building sense of urgency in his mind shot that theory down, and he was forced to answer.
"Exactly," Daphne said, settling onto a stool at the kitchen island. "Can we eat? I'm starving."
"Can you get them home?" Charlie asked, his eyes flicking back toward the woman he'd just left. "I think I'm staying."
Draco saw a thin blue light snake around them, circling them once and evaporating, leaving only a silvery mist behind.
"I hadn't intended to have children. I thought it might be best to let the Malfoy name die out with me," Draco said, shrugging lightly. "I still don't know if it was premeditated on her part or not, but after we'd been married a little over a year she announced she was pregnant."
"Here," he said, his eyes sweeping over the room. His study was the best choice – comfortable chairs and a low table perfect for placing the Pensieve on. The blazing fire kept the room slightly warmer than comfortable, which would help combat the chill that usually followed viewing violent or upsetting Pensieve memories.
Hermione giggled to herself, feeling indescribably naughty as she slung her bag over her shoulder and made her way to the library to meet Theo. No bra and no knickers would make for a very interesting study session indeed. After all, Theo had asked for her help studying Transfiguration tonight. She smirked, sure her outfit would produce at least
They'd debated renewing their vows, but Kingsley and Hermione had been quick to point out reciting the ancient spells again might have unforeseen consequences. No one had ever invoked
Harry shrugged, taking another slow sip. Draco watched his throat work as he swallowed, feeling the blood rush to his already half-hard cock at the sight.
Heavily lidded eyes blinked slowly as Draco's hand snaked around Harry's hip, roughly fondling his balls before pressing a knuckle against his perineum, making him gasp out loud again. He was transfixed as he watched a pale, slender finger disappear, his eyes finally drifting shut as he felt it trace a gentle pattern around his entrance. The finger was slick – Draco must have cast a wandless Lubrication Charm. A thrill rippled through Harry at the thought of having such a magically powerful partner and he cried out when not one, but two fingers slipped inside him the faint burning enough to stave off the climax that threatened just moments before.
Harry nodded. Hermione noted his earnest expression and sighed in resignation. If Harry was going to have an internet dating ad, then Hermione would make sure it was the very best it could be. By the time the two were finished, they had crafted an ad that clearly spelled out what Harry was looking for in a partner, keeping the language and tone casual and easy, just like Harry.
"Aunt Minnie said you two were coming tonight for the Sorting anyway," Cal said, rolling his eyes.
Harry frowned in confusion. "Well, yes," he said slowly, looking over at Draco. He looked confused as well. "We
"He said he did. The flowers are from his greenhouse, too. He said he has several magnolia trees there, and he uses a Stasis spell to keep them blossoming all year round because he loves the lemony scent so much."
"He realized – we all realized – that you two are good for each other," Neville said, his eyes finally resting on Harry again.
Draco's eyes widened in horror as he absently watched Potter turn an alarming shade of red, noting with detachment that it didn't look like the Gryffindor was breathing at all. He had much more important things to worry about. Like the fact that
The thought reminded Harry of the other secret he no longer had any hope of keeping – his identity as James Evans. The cold realization stopped him in his tracks, obliterating the odd but undeniable enjoyment he'd been getting out of verbally sparring with the Slytherin.
"If you have carpal tunnel, Harry Potter, it's not because of

sort of warning would have been appreciated. I mean, you know how I feel about him."
"I'm going out, Madge," he called as he walked by the secretary's desk, surprising her.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. Not mine.
Draco shrugged, lazily retrieving the spilled file with his wand. The papers were still out of order, but it hardly mattered. The Ataliers had just made it clear that Malfoy Industries no longer represented their businesses, so keeping their file tidy was no longer necessary.
"You'll find that Harry has many surrogate parents," Kingsley whispered in Draco's ear. "My wife and I are among them. Welcome to the family, son."
His son was blossoming under the extra attention, which only intensified his guilt over leaving Cal for days at a time over the past two years. It strengthened his resolve that his momentary lapse of judgment regarding Potter had been just that – a lapse in judgment. His place was here, with Cal. He had already started the necessary arrangements to close up Malfoy Manor so he could live full-time in France. He had a small flat in London he could use on the nights he worked too late to come home. It was what he should have been doing all along and he hated himself for sacrificing time with Cal for the good of the family and the business. Without his son, none of that mattered.
The wizard smiled, confident in his sale. It would take a very powerful wizard to be able to detect the magic swirling around the piece. This was

"You can't cook naked," Draco said, his burgeoning erection tenting the silk sleep pants.
he thought, slightly maudlin from the three drinks he'd already had. It was unusual for him to have more than one glass of the Muggle whisky at a time, generally preferring the more familiar Firewhisky if he was on a mission to get drunk.
"Let's do it," Ron said, hooking arms with Harry and striding out the door.
he corrected himself, his smile growing.
Hermione clamped a hand over Harry's knee, which had apparently been bouncing madly as he once again ran through the list of reasons why Sly might be avoiding him.
"Let's get started, then."
The book was taking a different path than he'd originally imagined, but he was happy with it. Harry grinned, saving his work and stretching again as he stood. Until now, the Aurors he wrote about were all single, and happily so. His main character in this manuscript, though, was married with a son. A six-year-old son, who liked puppies and snowball fights.
"I have to –" Draco was appalled at how rough his voice sounded, and he winced when pain lanced through his tongue. He moved it tentatively, deciding it was still in one piece.
Kingsley motioned for Harry to tap the parchment once more with his still-glowing wand. The words he had just spoken transferred to the page in silver script.
"Harry? Are you coming through? I've just finished dinner," she said.
"We're putting the cart before the horse," she said, all business, as she released Harry. "We have to make Harry's response witty and intelligent enough to keep this guy interested. We can worry about Harry's reproductive future later. Say, after they've had their first date."
Harry nodded taking a sip of the Shiraz he'd poured himself earlier. Every time he drank it now he thought of Sly's assessment of the wine, calling it bold and spicy without being overly sweet. It was ironic, since that was how Harry would describe Draco. His favorite wine and his favorite man.
. He'd avoided cutting it ever since that development, hoping to deter his so-called fans, but it was becoming annoyingly unkempt.
," Harry repeated, nodding over his shoulder at the wizard who had just entered the club. "He's here."
He took the file, nodding curtly to Blaise, who mirrored his earlier actions, bowing to the witch.
"Hmm?" Draco looked up, unfocused. "No. He's still in France at the moment. I'm rather anxious to see him myself."
Kingsley paused, his gaze traveling around the room. He knew how much Harry had been looking forward to a big wedding ceremony, and he wanted to give him as much of the pomp and pageantry as he could, even here, amid only their closest friends in Harry's study.
"More," Draco whispered, unsure how long he'd be able to take Harry's teasing touches. He sighed in relief when Harry acquiesced, shuddering as Harry's warm palms stroked down his body, resting lightly on his hips.
He forced himself up off the couch, grimacing as his damp skin stuck to the cool leather. It didn't dim his smile, though, or his newfound good mood. Not a bad end to an otherwise crappy day, he decided.
"Get some sleep."
Another ten seconds.
for each other. Malfoy was a git, but he if really was Sly, then there was no denying he and Harry would be great together.
"Come back to the house. We can have some tea," Neville said, his arm forcing Draco to stop.
"Stop it," he snapped, pushing her hands away. He hated wearing his glamour, but he knew it was necessary. Still, couldn't the publisher just use his old photo? Did he really need to have new shots taken? He'd argued for a good half an hour at the emergency meeting he'd been summoned to a few days earlier, finally giving in so he could get back to St. Mungo's to see how Ginny was progressing. "And I want it shorter. This looks ridiculous."
"Ugh," Bill groaned, grabbing his robes, which were draped over the back of the chair. He threw a few Galleons on the table to cover their meal and drinks, trudging dutifully after Harry and his brother as they made their way to George's store for party favors.
Madge gave Blaise – her favorite person in the office after Draco – a grudging smile.
It was unexpected to find my soul mate through an online dating service.
“Because I had an Arithmancy exam. So did you,” Theo answered, giving the blond a disapproving glare.
"Everything go alright?" Harry asked, wondering what could possibly have taken Theo away from his wife's side after her complicated birth.
being the best, of course – and now he was into some of the ones he'd never seen before. He'd had no idea Hugh Grant had been in so many movies, but he was enjoying each one immensely.
"I still can't believe you gave me Christmas as your last gift," Draco said, and he saw Harry's eyes flash gratefully at the subject change.
Harry nodded woodenly, fishing in his pocket for a small box. He nudged Blaise's hand, forcing the wizard to release him and take it.
really call your daddy stupid?" Blaise asked, curious to know exactly how the conversation had gone. He couldn't imagine Narcissa saying something like that, but she
"Er, Hermione?" Harry winced, wondering what she'd seen in the paper. Had there been any reporters there last night? He grimaced.
Draco would never be completely sure if it was in reaction to Harry's starkly honest and beautiful words or a simple physical reaction to the dark-haired wizard's channel constricting almost painfully around him as he came, but Draco followed Harry into the abyss of a mind-numbing orgasm. As he thrust up violently into Harry, a kaleidoscope of color bursting behind his eyelids as he came, Draco would have been shocked to know that similar promises of love, devotion and loyalty were falling from his lips as well.
Harry grinned reluctantly. He was having too good a time to be put out with them. Even the aforementioned Percy had shown up to toast the last days of his brother's bachelorhood. He looked around the club – filled mostly with their friends – and smiled, laughing as he saw Ron taking a body shot off Seamus.
He glanced at the now-warm bottle of Butterbeer on the desk, condensation beading wetly on the outside of the dark glass. He picked it up, throwing it into the fireplace. The resultant crash made him feel slightly better, as did the decision to head to the kitchen to seek out something harder to drown his sorrow.
Blaise took charge of Cal, shepherding the boy to his rooms and helping him get ready for bed. He figured Draco needed the break or at least the chance to calm down. He hadn't seen him look so stricken in years. Even the mess with Potter hadn't upset him as much as his son's innocent words.
“S-she left a b-bit ago,” he stammered, his face heating both with the lie and the fabulous things the witch in question was currently doing to his cock.
"Her loss," he said clearly, his muscles tense. "My gain."
, and she still wasn’t ready.
"As I will, so mote it be."
"I'm sorry –"
"I noticed you were alone at the wedding," he said, winking at Harry. "It doesn't have to be that way, you know. We were great together. We'd be great together again."
"No," Seamus said, Summoning several potions from a cart near the door. Draco recognized the distinctive color of Dreamless Sleep in one of the vials. "Harry was very clear that you are to stay here. I don't know what he has to do with any of this, or when you two became friends, but he seemed to think you were close enough that you'd trust him."
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. They belong to JKR, I'm just taking them out for a spin.
he thought, closing the web site and shoving the computer roughly away from him. Hermione had been right – as always. He should have warned Sly that he was James Evans when it first came up.
Hermione glared at him, looking down at her outfit.

"Will Theo be there?" Draco asked, still scribbling notes on a piece of parchment.
"I'm afraid he'll lose interest when he finds out everything."
The crowd quieted, cameras and Quick-Quotes Quills ready.
Draco couldn't help but return the smile. He picked up the small bag, fishing inside so he could see what Harry had brought. His brow furrowed in confusion when he pulled out two silver bracelets and two small vials of a lurid purple potion.
"Harry?" she called, annoyed that he had missed his appointment earlier that morning. The publishing house was going over final edits to his latest book, and he really needed to be there.
Tentatively, Draco grasped his own cock, only slightly surprised when he didn't feel the motion. His hand became a blur as he quickened his strokes, sure Gryffin was feeling the sensations, just as he was feeling Gryffin's hand as though it was moving over his own aching erection.
Harry shrugged, snatching Draco's hand back. He tightened his hold when the blond tried to squirm away.
"What? Why would you ask that?" He asked, keeping his voice carefully modulated.
She grimaced as she heard the newspaper crinkle underneath them, pausing to grab it and throw it aside. She didn't want to end up with ink all over her back from the newsprint. Hermione gasped as a few words caught her eye, abruptly sitting up and yanking her hand back.
"No," Draco admitted, watching as Harry's shoulders tensed. He knew it was important to Harry, but he hadn't been able to bring himself to watch them yet. He was afraid of what he might see, though he knew nothing Harry could show him would make him change his mind.
He'd gotten a panicked Patronus from Blaise twenty minutes earlier, instructing him to guard Cal and gather up anything they'd need to be away for a few days. He didn't need any further explanation – this was a possibility they'd been planning for since Cal was a baby.
Though he hadn't thought it possible, things got worse. Draco watched, his stomach plummeting with each passing second, as Harry replayed the rest of the Battle of Hogwarts in precise, horrifying, sickening detail. All through it, Harry repeated his litany of apology, repeating the words over and over until they were nearly a meaningless hum in the background.
Kingsley ruffled his hair reassuringly, standing so he could press his wand against Harry's heart.
Draco rolled his eyes but complied, opening the post titled "Must Love Quidditch" with a sigh. His straight-as-an-arrow friend was having much more fun evaluating Draco's potential internet suitors than Draco thought the situation warranted.
But then Draco was kneeling above him, wrenching Harry's trousers completely off. He didn't take the time to similarly divest himself, instead simply unfastening the button and zipper and taking his thick cock in his hand, a sigh of pure relief escaping his lips as he gave himself several experimental strokes. Harry watched, eyes heavily lidded with desire, as Draco pleasured himself, his own cock jumping at the sight as though the pale hand was fisting it instead.
Harry grinned, finally realizing who had sent the last request, clicking away so he and Sly could chat in private.
He didn't respond, edging back enough to fumble with the fastenings on Harry's trousers instead. This was no time for romantic gestures, not when he was poised on the edge of razor-sharp desire. Harry gasped when Draco reached his prize, long fingers delving into the now-open trousers and curling around his erection.
"I'm perfectly fine," Draco snapped, slightly irritable from the last round of invasive poking and prodding the Healers had subjected him to before releasing him earlier.
"I just need to know that you're going to explain it all to him some day," Neville said suddenly as he made to leave, his gaze seeking Harry's assurances.
Draco went lax in the man's arms, letting himself be propped up on the bed. This man knew Harry.
Draco roused himself out of his near slumber, mindful that he was still fully dressed and hadn't responded to the rather large pile of urgent owls that had accumulated on his desk down the hall. He'd been up all night with Caleum, neither wanting to waste any of their precious little time together. He'd finally left him just before dawn, tucking the covers around him and kissing him gently before spending another hour giving instructions to the staff about how to deal with the mood swings and tempers he knew Caleum would have when he woke to find Draco had left.
Blaise nodded, taking a seat in the chair across from Draco's desk. Caleum's obvious desire to live with Draco full-time was troubling. He'd seen it coming for months; the boy was no longer content to see Draco a few nights a week or on the weekends. He wanted to be able to go out in public with his father, to be able to live where he rightfully should be, at Malfoy Manor. Blaise knew Draco felt torn about it as well. It killed him to be away from his son so much, but at the same time, Caleum could be in danger if the wizarding world knew he was Draco's son.
Blaise gave her a weak smile, waggling his eyebrows. "Is that an offer, Madge-pie?"
"Alright, who's next?" He looked around, pointing at Luna. She grinned back at him, asking her question before Hermione had a chance to pretend to lift the Silencing Spell. She'd been exempted the first time around.
Cal leaned in a little closer, his eyes seeking out his godfather briefly before he continued. "You're Harry-Bloody-Potter, The-Blasted-Seeker-Who-Never-Loses."
He opened his eyes, arousal spiking through him at the sight of Draco running his hands over his own body. It was almost sensory overload, watching Draco touch himself but feeling those touches glide over his own skin. Harry moaned, biting his lip to keep from crying out.
"Before we hear the vows they have written for each other, however, there is one other vow that must be taken first," Kingsley said.
"It means you're on dangerous ground," he said, ruffling Cal's hair. The boy had taken the evacuation with surprising calm. Bringing Harry had been the right call – his presence had reassured Caleum. "Are you doing alright? Hungry?"
"I don't know where he is," Draco said, his tone sharp.
The Auror laughed darkly, scanning the file again. There were dozens of photos of Malfoy and his love interests there, and none of them looked like he'd been trying particularly hard to hide. Was something different about this one, then?
, he thought fondly, a bit happy that Charlie thought enough of him to take the piss like that.
"Oh, you," she said, swatting him fondly as she left, a faint blush tinting her cheeks. "You make him go home, Mr. Malfoy. He's too sick to be here."
He knew Harry wanted to keep Cal close as long as he could. Hell,
Harry simply nodded, letting Draco watch the events as they transpired.
Stormy grey eyes met his, and suddenly Harry felt like lying on a sofa in his drawing room in a tangled heap of half-clothed limbs, with the late afternoon sun casting weak patterns across the old rug he kept meaning to replace but never quite managed to, was in the most romantic spot imaginable. There was no soft music, but the harsh and rapid breathing of his lover, fiancé, bond mate,
Harry's wand tip glowed bright silver when he finished, and runes appeared on Draco's skin, etched in silver over the places Harry had tapped his wand. Hermione strained forward slightly to read them, smiling as she recognized the symbols for intellect, heart and soul.
"What do you need, Harry?" Luna asked, tying her long blonde hair up to keep it out of her way.
"You were a just child sixth year," Harry said, hating the way Draco stiffened at the words.
Blaise laughed, a rich sound that Draco had missed over the last few days. "Hell yes I'm jealous!"
"Gin!" he cried, sounding scandalized. "You can't talk like that. You're my
He tried to turn over, his eyes snapping open when his torso didn't respond to his command. He blinked sleepily and his arms automatically felt around for his son. Cal was splayed over Draco's chest, his head resting against his shoulder.
She nodded absently, wondering how she'd never picked up on the attraction between the men before. It was so obvious now – all those years of fighting, that intense hatred between them. It was no wonder Draco had felt sparks fly when they touched.
"Spit it out," she said, grinning when he flinched at her directness.
"Oh, I know. I can hire a surrogate and have her carry my child. It's not that important to me, to be honest. What would it matter whether or not the child was mine biologically?"
he thought dryly, his lips quirking at the awful image of Madam Malkin's pins anywhere near his bits.
"You have two portraits," Harry whispered, his voice still brittle with humiliation. Snape had just watched he and Draco –
!" Harry yelled as the mist dissipated, catching a shocked Cartwell off guard.
"Took one," Blaise said, squeezing his eyes shut and sitting up, rubbing his hands briskly over his face.

"I, Kingsley Alexander Shacklebolt, Minister of Magic, have hereby witnessed the completion of the ancient rite of
Draco ignored Neville's prompt, setting off down the row again. Neville followed, his arm still firmly clamped around Draco's shoulders. He knew Draco would rather gnaw off his own foot than talk about anything that even touched on emotions or feelings, but this was a conversation someone needed to have with the blond.
He slapped her hands away from his computer, scowling.
Draco woke to the smell of crisping pancetta and strong coffee. He allowed himself a languid stretch and debated heading downstairs to pounce on Harry. His hand settled on the sticky mess that covered his abdomen, remnants of last night's sex marathon. They'd been too exhausted to even manage a weak Cleaning Charm before falling asleep. He grimaced, deciding he had time for a quick shower before heading down to find Harry.
his mind corrected, his thoughts drawn to the books Sev had forced him to read about the potion.
"I, Harry James Potter, Head of the most Ancient and Noble Houses of Potter and Black, do freely and gladly accept the yoke of a magical bond with Draco Abraxas Malfoy," Harry said, touching his wand to the bottom of the contract.
Harry stopped breathing, his mind racing. His hand was frozen, still touching Draco's, but he was powerless to move it.
"The Diagon Alley warehouse isn't as cut and dried," he continued. "The zoning there is less clear, and I have the junior counsel looking into precedent. We'll need to know how other clubs and pubs are zoned and which permits we'll need before we try to go before the board. I'll have that report on your desk within the week."
"I'm corresponding with a bloke who was in Slytherin. We met through that site I told you about last time I visited," he said.
"– Uncle Ron said there was a potion that could turn C.C.'s fur orange –"
Draco held his gaze, waiting a few beats before moving. Instead of responding, he stood quickly, tossing the bracelets onto the table carelessly as he scrambled to unbutton his shirt. Harry almost choked on this tongue as creamy flesh came into view, snapping himself out of his stupor when slender fingers slipped under Draco's waistband, deftly unfastening his trousers and pushing them to the ground.
"Do you think this wizard has children, then?" she asked Harry, who was hovering nearby waiting for her reaction.
"The proposal for the warehouse in Diagon Alley should be on your desk in the morning," he said, switching easily back to work mode. "Theo's hoping to get everything finalized before the end of June."
He tried to keep the bitterness out of his voice, pressing on. "She's gorgeous. Tall, olive skin, black hair." He laughed. "I never realized she bore a resemblance to you, but she does. I'm grateful for it now though, because Cal could easily pass for your son."
It was unexpected that said soul mate was, of all things, a Slytherin.
, s-sir."
sorry."

"The flu," Harry said, his voice sounding choked again. "Yes. Yes, that's probably it."
Draco smiled slightly, his hands brushing the manuscript on his desk again absently.
do you love? Did you love your dear, departed daddy? Did you love him even after you found out he had raped and killed my
Draco gasped at the feel of Harry's teeth against his lip. It almost felt like a rough kiss, and he was quick to let his own tongue slide over his lips, flicking in teasing circles. He saw Harry stiffen, another moan escaping his lips.
“Fuck,” Theo swore quietly, whipping his hand out of Hermione’s skirt. They heard Hannah’s voice calling out to them.
his mind corrected him, and for once he didn't fight it.
Teddy opened the magically sealed envelope carefully, prolonging Hermione's anguish. He had a pretty good idea what the solution was, and she was off by one important point.
Pansy shook her head, her mouth tight as they made their way through the small talk.
Draco gasped as he felt a hand firmly grasp his cock, his heart racing as an unfamiliar callused palm ghosted over the head.
"Is father –"
More likely. Harry ran a hand through his hair, grimacing in disgust as he found it to be sticky.
"That it is, mate," George said cheerfully, grabbing two of the prototypes and stuffing them in a bag for Harry. He held the bag back though, his face sobering. "Ang and I tested them," he said, his face coloring. "And, er, they're good. They work, I mean. But they won't actually physically stop you from, you know –"
"Finally," she mocked, allowing herself a husky laugh of relief before their mouths crashed together; her assault on his mouth so fierce it actually knocked him backward into the sand.
"In fact, I wouldn't be terribly surprised if there's another wedding before the year is out," Ron continued, leaning back in his seat and taking a sip of water.
"Blaise?" Harry said, and the other wizard colored, assuming Harry was teasing him about the drunken kiss he'd shared with the younger Slytherin a few years back.
“It was brilliant,” he murmured against her lips, letting his renewed erection brush against her hip so she knew he was only teasing as he continued on “–and shocking behavior from the famed Gryffindor princess.”
The Auror sat with his arms folded, waiting for Draco to continue. He no doubt figured he'd at least get the name of Draco's partner, and the blond assumed all hell would break loose when that happened.
"We've been passionate about each other since we were eleven years old," Draco said dryly, drawing a groan from Harry. "It's true. It takes passion to hate that fervently."
They were silent through a memory of a dingy pub in Hogsmeade. Draco closed his eyes when the memory shifted again; unable to watch one of his closest friends die again.
, he thought, his legs trembling as the finger breached him.
Harry was waiting in a comfortable armchair by the fire when Neville stepped through the Floo. He'd clearly been expecting him, since Nev's favorite Muggle beer was waiting on the table, chilled to the perfect temperature, and held there under a Stasis Charm.
"Harry," he continued, nodding at the other wizard. "You've been searching for a relationship like this for your entire life. Just enjoy it. You
Cal's lip trembled, his boyish pout softening Draco's resolve. He knew he didn't see Caleum enough, but it was just too risky have him here in England where they could be seen together.
"Just open it so I can go," Pansy sneered, grabbing Ron's Muggle soda and taking a drink.
?" Hermione gasped out, coughing as she choked on her drink.

Resolved to get it right this time, Theo concentrated fully on the parchment, envisioning it as a strong sapling with vibrant green leaves. He leveled his wand and cast, pouring his vision into the words as they passed his lips.
Possible.
Of course, he
definitely
"What was the first spell you tried when we were on the Hogwarts Express in first year?" he asked, his head cocked as he watched Ron roll his eyes.
"That's not what I meant, and you know it," she said reproachfully, scowling as he kissed both her cheeks.
A piece of parchment floated to the table, and Draco grabbed it, his brow furrowing at the cryptic message written in Harry's scrawl.
Ron shook his head, his expression still shell-shocked. The story Harry was telling him about his online mystery man had just meshed with something Hermione had told him yesterday. Something about Harry's odd reaction to something in the paper.
"Of course. We'll be through in a minute," Hermione said with an indulgent smile. "I'll just pack up dinner. Open some wine, will you?"
"Christ!" Harry all but shrieked when Draco added another finger, his pace relentless as he finger-fucked him in time with his strokes. "I'm going to –"
"Sorry," he muttered against Draco's swollen lips, the sincerity of his apology ruined by a sharp triumphant cry when he managed to wrest Draco's shirt off, buttons scattering across the floor.
"Do you Harry James Potter, Head of the House of Black, Head of the House of Potter, swear on your magic that you have no other bonds or entanglements that would prevent you from legally wedding Draco Abraxas Malfoy?"
Hermione squinted at her reflection in the mirror, adding another coating of lip gloss. She’d learned a lot about makeup and clothes this term from her new friendship with Lavender, and she was pulling all the stops out tonight.
Theo nodded, heading toward the door. He knew better than to thank Draco for the advice. The blond’s reputation had taken a beating after Seamus let it slip that the Slytherin had been the mastermind behind his romantic gesture a few weeks ago, and Draco had been amping up the cold bastard routine ever since in an attempt to salvage his image.
Saturday's gift was sitting on the coffee table in front of him, with several passages marked for future use.
"You're quite welcome," Kingsley said, uncrossing his legs. He'd been in the drawing room for nearly half an hour, and he was getting restless. "I must admit, I was surprised when Harry invoked the ancient courting laws. A brilliant move on his part, though. He'll be able to control what information gets out about his relationship with Mr. Malfoy, even after their marriage."
“I don’t generally drink at these things,” Draco explained, helping a now-blushing Harry off the table and casting the same spell on Ron. “Someone needs to keep a level head, after all.”
Harry felt like he was on an emotional rollercoaster. He'd initially been giddy to hear from Sly, then angry that the other man hadn't had the consideration to email him when his trip was extended. That segued into the warm, fuzzy feeling he got while reading Sly's playful answers to his questions, which became a slight tingle of anticipation and desire when he read Sly's questions. And then, of course, irritation, since Hermione came back 10 minutes after Harry had finished reading (and re-reading) Sly's message and forced him to close down his email altogether so he could write without distraction.
"Fine," Harry rasped, forcing his gaze to move from Malfoy to Hannah, who was half-standing, leaning across the table to try to rest a hand on his forehead. "Sit, sit. I'm fine."
He followed the same pattern Harry had, placing his wand against his own forehead after finishing with Harry.
"We're about finished," the dour woman seated down the table said, looking up at Harry. "Unless you have any objections, Mr. Evans."
"But –" Draco looked around, dazed. Surely, Neville wouldn't allow the greenhouse to be turned into a wintry retreat. What about the delicate plants? The fragile fruit trees Neville cherished were covered in snow, their leaves a shockingly vibrant green against the white flakes. "The snow, the plants! It's –"
Draco sighed, his head pounding from the overdose of the potion – six drops, when three would have worked perfectly well – and the extended interrogation.
"Hang on," Blaise said, tightening his grip before Disapparating.
Signed and sealed,
Their eyes met for a moment as they fumbled to uncork the vials, not looking away as they blindly brought the potion to their lips, swallowing at the same time. Draco shuddered as he felt the potion slide down his throat, accompanied almost immediately by a heightened awareness. He could feel the slight breeze from a half-opened window caress his skin, the soft touch making his cock jump. He grabbed his wand to activate the bracelet, his eyes falling shut at the unbelievable sensation of the cold silver sliding down his arm as he did.
"Do you think you're getting the flu as well?" Hannah asked, reluctantly settling back into her seat. She was clearly disappointed to be denied the opportunity to touch him, and Harry found himself intensely grateful for the table separating them.
Hermione looked up, the frown she'd been wearing while reading easing. She stood and put her arm around Harry's strong shoulders, leaning in to him.
Draco's eyes rose to Neville's the resolve in them clear. He opened the box, joy and sorrow mingling into an overwhelming urge to cry when he saw his old wand nestled in the dark velvet. The wand he never thought he'd see again. The wand he'd never even thought he
"These insufferable brats –"
"Do you think I don't know that?" He asked, bracing a hand against the mantle as he spoke. "I think I've been half in love with him for years, I just didn't realize it."
"Do you – do you think it's wise? Letting them correspond like that?"
"He liked it," Harry said, grinning like an idiot.
Harry shrugged, taking a small sip of whisky. He savored the rich flavor, letting it roll over his tongue before swallowing. He didn't intend to indulge in more than one glass since he was having a hard enough time resisting Draco without the lowered inhibitions another shot of whisky would bring.
Neville grinned, his eyes lighting.
"I said I think we should stick with the tradition," Draco drawled, making his way to the bedroom door. He'd be sleeping in one of the guest quarters tonight, as per Harry's ridiculous plan. "It's obviously important to you, and as your husband, I want nothing more than to… satisfy… your every wish."
Blaise watched Draco's face as his longtime friend scrutinized the post. He knew Draco's love life had been a mess for ages. He had a long string of failed relationships behind him. Men either wanted to date him for his money – either to have him support them or support various business ventures they wanted to pursue – or because they enjoyed the status of dating such a notorious and well-known man. Draco was loved and hated by the press at the same time; his every move was splashed across the pages of wizarding publications for all to see. Blaise wrinkled his nose in distaste. He hated the publicity seekers even more than the money grubbers, since they paraded Draco out in public so they could be photographed on his arm. Draco hated the press and he hated going out; though he'd never admit it, he was a homebody at heart.
"You think so?" Harry asked, his voice crestfallen. He'd just read the glowing email from Sly, excited that the man had spent the evening curled up reading his words and eating his food. It was almost as if they'd spent that time together.
"How are things working out?" she asked, hesitant. The boundaries of the Unbreakable Vow would prevent her from saying too much, but she was curious about how one of her oldest friends was getting on with one of his oldest rivals. Blaise had mentioned a fight, but he hadn't given her any details.
“It’s a difficult concept, Theo,” she said, stroking the back of his hand with her thumb. It certainly wasn’t out of his grasp as a wizard, but she could tell it was making him doubt his skills. “It isn’t that you
"I need to talk to Nev about something," he said, trying to keep his voice light as he left Harry with them to head across the room. "Something I just remembered about – the flowers for tomorrow."
they worked and any problems you had. No details."
write those things to Draco?" She ran a finger over the raised runes that decorated the bowl, which looked like it had been carved out of soapstone. It was gorgeous. The absence of a price tag also likely meant it was expensive.
Was he
Dante’s large yellow eyes meet his, so he lifts his index finger to his lips to shush him as he tiptoes around. The kneazle blinks them shut—
“Brilliant, and—I have to ask and I’m genuinely not trying to aggravate you,” he says, stopping at the opened front door. Draco holds a breath. “I wanted to take you to my local, if it’s okay. It’s a muggle pub.”
“You’re welcome,” he replies softly, dropping a few drops of the potion onto the handle of the forks, knife, spoons, and a single blank page extracted from the back of
“Bulstrode will be there, I suppose,” Draco considers. He slips his wand up his sleeve, ushering them out the door as he contemplates. “You guys. Luna. Flitwick…”
“Thanks, I’ll… see you around,” he says again, frowning thoughtfully. He still looks distant and a bit peaky when he reaches for the floo powder.
He cups his hand under the swinging charm and holds it up flat against Harry’s chest, feels the fighting heartbeats.
Draco nods and flips the lid. It’s a small pendant on a gold chain in the shape of a crescent, shiny as if it was boxed yesterday. The chain is delicate and thin, the crescent slender, and he spies a note folded in the padding the necklace sits on.
“I’ll take the case, Harry,” Hermione offers in response, a familiar determination in her tone. She holds his gaze fiercely and with love. “It’s not my expertise. Maybe Blaise and I can work together—I’d be happy to collaborate—but they need more proof that Draco’s involved than a lack of alibi. We can start by appealing for release until a trial, okay? The judge’s office will be open tomorrow.”
the evidence available to him. Maybe he got caught in his own curse the last time.”
“She’d know.”
He nods again, and she tilts her head, staring past his shoulder into space. He feels almost weightless with the announcement, and so he opens up completely and tells her everything—the early consultations, the study sessions that set it all into motion, the way it happened so easily that it felt like an unstoppable force of nature. The tracking lessons, the fight training, and then the pub.
Ron speaks up from behind them. “Rosie Posie, I think we should return this crown to the real queen, huh?”
“I don’t know.”
“Wait, but when—would that—show me.”
“Can’t have that if they have
“I’m sure he was a great teacher to a willing student,” he replies cryptically.
“I shouldn’t have let my temper get the best of me before when I’d already hurt you. It hit hard. The insinuation that you don’t like me the way I am.”
He remembers his surprise to watch Harry’s face fall at the ramifications of vanishing Draco’s completed evidence—a feeling he thought he’d been alone in, and that he wasn’t going to confront. But in watching him, his stomach had turned, and he felt an overwhelming need to convey reassurance, to make that look disappear alongside the heaviness in his chest. The longer they’re friends, the more his stomach does that, like he’s anxious that Harry will wise up and stop being kind, or decide Draco wasn’t worth the effort.
This is when, despite his strong constitution, Harry’s mind would fail him. They wrestle hard; two competitive men, starting with steady eye contact and locked arms on each other’s shoulders, heads lowered, but it always devolves quickly—heads tucked under arms, torsos curved over shoulders and dropped to the ground, legs straddling hips, hands pinning down wrists, half-arsed punches that aren’t meant to hit forcefully.
“Auror Bode, sir.”
“I will allow you to say that you were unpracticed. In compromise.”

He has Draco’s full attention, wonderfully attentive, face unreadable still. Harry wills himself to find his words better than the rambling he’s doing.
“I like the half-up. Frames your face.”
some of the congratulations, but either way it’s clear that not a single department has missed the opportunity to get in good graces with MLE.
“And what, since then no one compares?”
or right now?”
Harry pulls a face, then turns back to Hugh, who has returned with a paper bag for Draco and a stack of papers, which he hands directly to Harry. “All our stockists, though I don’t know how helpful the locations outside the UK will be.”
“I was surprised you said yes.”
“How did you…”
In the morning, they won’t speak of it.
“I just put those up,” he says, lacing his shoes.
Balance is restored in the study-turned-laboratory once he’s well-rested, keen to work with his hands after days of reading and theorising. He tries to clear some space on the cluttered desk. What was once a second bedroom had been filled with stacks of books in rows along the walls, against the furniture, on two filing cabinets against the wall opposite the door. Some were turned into a makeshift table by an old claw-footed reading chair, forgotten teacups staining rings into a copy of
A joke dies on Harry’s lips as he’s pulled close and swept effortlessly into an easy two-step waltz. Draco’s feet move easily, making up for Harry’s clunky ones, until he feels like he’s floating in circles around the furniture, rising and falling in time with his lead’s lifted steps.
“Hold on,” Blaise interjects loudly. “I’m very sorry that this turned out this way. Obviously, you really care for him, up-bup-bup—” He holds up a finger when Draco opens his mouth. “But you need to calm down, mate, or you’ll do something daft again. Just wait. Give him time. Follow his lead. Be cool.”
They’d gotten an expensive bottle of wine for the table and all raise a glass as Ron gives a long, winding, Dumbledore-esque toast to his wife’s incredible work ethic and the lack of toddlers currently sitting at their table, which Harry and Hermione laugh along to.
Harry takes a deep breath, jaw clenched, clearly not interested in the attempt at casualness that Draco’s offering. “Why’re you ignoring me?”
“Astoria Greengrass.”
She looks up with raised eyebrows. “Yes, if he’d missed one more of his daughter’s recitals, I think his wife would’ve finally… left him.” He catches the glance she gives to her family photo. The room feels very awkward and he suddenly can’t wait to be finished.
“Alright, uncle, uncle,” Harry groans, tossing the book down and sitting up straight.
“Thursday.”
“Just gone.”
Thanks for your patience yesterday, if you were waiting on an update. As we close in on the climax, I decided to put quality before timeliness.
“I just remember how hard you were always working at Hogwarts towards your mastery,” she enthuses. “Invite me to the release party?”
Teddy shrugs this off and continues following Harry’s instruction. He’s not the best, not a prodigy, but he has passion. This, Harry thinks, is the best signifier of his future skill.
. It’s a testament to the disaster the dinner’s been so far.
“Look, if… I don’t know whether you have something to do with this, but I’m domesticated, alright? I didn’t do shit to that girl. And if I wanted to, I wouldn’t be sloppy enough to point a wand at her after.”
“How much of the silverware set was used at that event and this one?”
Dromeda has a photo for him when he arrives for Teddy. He almost tears up. It’s Remus, Sirius, James, Lily, and Peter all crowded around a little bundle of blankets with eyes and a nose.
. He’d sent him off with some poetry, too, but Harry had read a couple pages and given up. It was too flowery and boring. This book, though, has captivated him.
“Reading,” he offers, holding up the pages. Draco rounds the couch, wrapping his arms around Harry from behind. He looks at the paper from over his shoulder.
“…Sure.”
“It’s just been

“Mm-hm.” Blaise looks unconvinced, or at least sceptical, but he moves on. “I’m dropping by because Pansy said to. Told me one time seeing each other was a fluke, twice proves you haven’t been purloined from me by the Ministry.”
