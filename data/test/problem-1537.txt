Draco’s expression became thoughtful. Sarah could practically see his brain picking through the information. “You’re right, it would make sense,” he agreed. “So, if it’s a sort of snake, what kind can petrify its victims? Also, how would it be getting around the school?”
Harry’s Occlumency lessons with Snape were as bad as ever. Every Monday night he returned to one of the common rooms shaking and pale. Sarah and Draco would spend countless hours calming him down and helping him clear his mind before bed.
“Wish you would,” said Fred, looking irritated at the interruption. His expression softened when he greeted Sarah and he held her hand as he turned back to George to continue their conversation.
“We’ve only got half an hour until midnight, so we need to act fast! A battle plan has been agreed between the teachers of Hogwarts and the Order of the Phoenix. Professor Flitwick, Sprout and McGonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to the three highest Tower – Ravenclaw, Astronomy and Gryffindor – where they’ll have a good overview, excellent positions from which to work spells. Meanwhile, Remus, Sirius,” he indicated the pair, “Arthur,” he pointed towards Mr Weasley, sitting at the Gryffindor table, “and I will take groups into the grounds. We’ll need somebody to organise defence of the entrances of the passageways into the school – “
“Exactly,” Draco stated. “Which means we should have started it yesterday but of course there was the Quidditch game and your complete inability to stay unharmed.”
Quidditch practice had also amped up again. Slytherin managed to destroy Ravenclaw in their most recent game, keeping their lead in the Quidditch Cup. This, however, meant that Warrington was calling for nearly daily practices to prepare them for their game against Hufflepuff; the one which would determine who would win the Quidditch Cup. The team was furious at Sarah and Harry for naming their fathers as Death Eaters, so each practice session was full of hissed threats and glares. Sarah and Draco found themselves collapsing into seats in the library late after practice, groggily pulling various texts towards them to work on the countless essays, spells and translations they had to complete.
“ – by which time, many of you may be ready to take your tests,” Twycross continued, as though there had been no interruption.
“There is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection to Cedric’s death,” Dumbledore went on. Sarah felt even sicker as Dumbledore said, “I am talking, of course, about Harry Potter.”
“Fred, stop, he didn’t enter,” Sarah muttered to him as Harry was passed between people, hopelessly trying to get away.
Since her father had died, the Manor and all the Deaumont assets went into Sarah’s possession. She, Remus, Sirius and Draco had spent most of the summer sorting through inventories and dealing with the bureaucracy of Gringotts. Finally, after weeks of mind-numbing work, everything was in Sarah’s name and she had stepped foot into the Manor for the first time in three years.
Voldemort did not speak, but prowled in a circle, and Sarah knew that Harry kept him temporarily mesmerised and at bay, held back by the faintest possibility that Harry might indeed know a final secret…
“But people would know that Pettigrew was an Animagus!” she said shrilly. “I checked the register – there are only seven registered Animagi from this century!”
Scowling deeply, she followed the others as they stepped toward the woman who, at once, turned and hobbled off back the way they had come. Leading them past several houses, she turned in at a gate. They followed her up the front path through the garden nearly as overgrown as the one they had just left. She fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door, then opened it and stepped back to let them pass.
hilarious high-pitched scream from Ron) and, whenever he fancied a break, spent hours at a time floating along after Umbridge and blowing loud raspberries every time she spoke.
“Draco, Ron and Hermione had to go to the prefects carriage,” he explained as Sarah took the seat beside him. “I thought you might’ve sat with Fred.”
“Well, hello caffeine-dependent people,” Sarah said as she strolled toward the counter. Someone, (Sarah guessed Mrs Weasley) had laid out a tray with bacon, eggs, toast, mushrooms and sausages loaded on it, kept warm under a Stasis Charm.
“I should be going,” Remus said, smiling as Hermione and Harry attempted to clean butterbeer off themselves while making sure Ron didn’t die. “Do you want me to tell anyone anything?”
Drifting along in the sparkling current inside was a tiny, jewel-bright egg. As it rose in the jar it cracked open and a hummingbird emerged, which was carried to the very top of the jar, but as it fell on the draft, its feathers became bedraggled and damp again, and by the time it had been borne back to the bottom of the jar it had been enclosed once more in its egg.
“Why don’t we make an appearance and give our regards to Hermione and then go home?” suggested Fred. “Harry here can make sure his boy doesn’t stay out too late talking of legal petitions and complicated bindings. Honestly, I was surprised Percy did ask Draco to marry him when he mentioned cauldron laws.”
“Are you really going to the Weasley’s house for break?” Pansy asked, breaking the calm silence that had settled on the room. A slight smile graced her face as Blaise settled on his bed beside her, casually wrapping one arm around her shoulder. If those two didn’t start dating soon, Lyra was going to forcefully go up to them and make them.
“Get your shit together Deaumont!” Warrington growled at one point. “Or I’ll put you out of action!”
“It’s okay,” said Harry, still breathing rather faster than usual, “Just – just prod me or something in the future, all right, don’t bend over me like that…”
They made quick progress down the lane leading to Hogsmeade and exhaled a great sigh of relief as they stepped into the warm interior of Gladrags Wizardwear.
The night soon came to an end, with Rosie and Naomi being completely enamoured with Harry and making not one but three invitations to join them should he ever choose to take a chance with girls again. Draco had dragged Harry firmly out of the door at the last one, throwing the finger over his shoulder at the cackling heathens left behind.
Sarah had been prepared for her boggart this time and didn’t hesitate with casting the spell. She joined Draco and Theo, who had done just as well as she did, and watched as Pansy, Harry, Ron and Blaise completed the course. Millicent came to stand next to them as they watched Ron become confused by the hinkypunk, sinking waist-high into the quagmire.
She sighed heavily but didn’t shoo him away. They settled cross-legged on the bottom bunk and Sarah hugged a pillow to her chest.
How long they all stood there, listening, she did not know, nor why it seemed to ease their pain a little to listen to the sound of their mourning, but it felt like a long time later that the hospital door opened again and Professor McGonagall entered the ward. Like all the rest, she bore marks of the recent battle: there were grazes on her face and her robes were ripped.
“Where’s the proof You-Know-Who’s back?” said the blond Hufflepuff boy in a rather aggressive voice.
Draco flinched away slightly from Sarah’s screech, a frown on his face. Behind him, Harry was struggling to keep his own face neutral, even though his emerald eyes were shinning in delight.
“Apparently they haven’t gotten to it yet,” Sarah commented idly. She reached for the cylindrical package attached to one of the owls’ leg. “Oh shit, I know what this means.”
“Neville doesn’t hate you,” Sarah said quietly, wiping the tear tracks off Draco’s face. “He’s always known who you were and he still chose to be friends with you anyway.”
“There is work to be done,” he said. “Molly…am I right in thinking that I can count on you and Arthur?”
Pansy continued to stare at the front page in horror, her tanned face quickly losing all its colour. She wordlessly moved some of the dishes out of the way and spread the newspaper in front of them all, pointing, rather unnecessarily in Sarah’s opinion, at the ten pictures of jeering Azkaban inmates. The headline read:
“It’s one extra day,” said Sarah, when Harry looked mutinous. “I know you want to get going but we have to do this last thing and then we can leave.”
“Draco!” Pansy snapped her fingers in front of Draco’s face and brought his attention back to her. “Brilliant, he’s back with us.”
“Dunno,” Ron said, shrugging as if it weren’t a big deal. “But he didn’t get in trouble, did he? Dumbledore’s letting him enter. A thousand Galleons prize money, eh? And you don’t have to do end of year tests either…”
Professor Lupin had come back. He paused as he entered, looked around and said, with a small smile, “I haven’t poisoned that chocolate you know…”
“This is purely for selfish reasons,” countered Sarah. “I cannot bear to witness one more horrifying minute of them devouring each other. It’s been quite pernicious to my overall wellbeing.”
Draco nodded heavily. Pansy started chattering about the newest fashion trend to fill the tense silence. Eventually, they called it a night and Sarah went to bed with her head full of questions and worries.
Sunday morning dawned bright and chilly. The soft pattering of rain could be heard against the window and yet sunlight still streamed in across the bed. Sarah sighed as she woke up and immediately pressed back against the solid body behind her, rotating her hips slightly against the warm hardness she met there. A soft groan near her ear and a huffed breath caused a smile to slowly spread its way across her face. A gentle hand trailed itself across her waist and down her hip as a wet mouth latched onto the side of her neck.
“But yes, in regards to your comment, Ron, it is strange,” Draco acknowledged, leaning back against Harry’s chest.
George huffed a laugh and let go of her so that she could turn around to face him. His back was pressed up against the trunk of the tree as he sat straddling a thick branch. Lyra found herself practically in his lap. They both seemed to realise their position at the same time, for a red flush was making its way up George’s neck. Lyra felt her face heat up slightly in response but didn’t move back, unsure whether the branch would continue to take her weight.
There was a lot of commotion in the house. From what Harry had gathered, Fred and George had bewitched their trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying them, with the result that they had hurtled straight into Ginny and knocked her down two flights of stairs into the hall; Mrs Black and Mrs Weasley were both screaming at the top of their voices.
“My father was less than pleased at my refusal to bow to his every wish,” she said shortly. She quickly changed the subject. “I’m truly sorry to drop in so late, but would it be possible to trouble you for a room to stay in for the remainder of the holidays?”
“Now, sit back down, dinner is almost over.” With those words, Professor Snape spun around, his robes flaring dramatically behind him, and marched back toward the teachers table.
Up at the top table, Professor McGonagall had got to her feet and swept past Ludo Bagman and Professor Karkaroff to whisper urgently to Professor Dumbledore, who bent his ear toward her, frowning slightly.
Draco shook his head slightly. “Hermione, you didn’t hear the reception I just got,” he said. “And that was from Harry’s
Sarah gaped as she entered the Hall. The walls had been covered in sparkling silver frost, with hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry, black ceiling. The House tables had vanished; instead, there were about a hundred smaller, lantern-lit ones, each seating about a dozen people. There was a large round table at the top of the Hall were the Judges were already sitting.
“If somebody swapped the real sword for the fake while it was in Dumbledore’s office,” Hermione panted, as they propped the painting against the side of the tent, “Phineas Nigellus would have seen it happen, he hangs right beside the case!”
“Well, I also think that if I spend more time with you, you’ll be more likely to come to your senses and remember that relationships aren’t all physical,” she admitted.
“Except it was always meant to be a lesson, not proof that the Hallows actually exist,” Sarah added quickly at Hermione’s scoff. “It’s just a morality tale, it’s obvious which gift is best, which one you’d choose – “
“The ring, the ring that became the Horcrux, Marvolo Gaunt said it had the Peverell coat of arms on it! I saw him waving it in the bloke from the Ministry’s face, he nearly shoved it up his nose!”
Sarah couldn’t believe what she was hearing. Judging from the others’ expressions, neither could they. She had always thought of Fudge as a stable figure, a little pompous and arrogant but essentially good-natured. But now a short, angry wizard stood before them, refusing, point-blank, to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and order world – to believe that Voldemort could have risen.
Just then, a small commotion caught their attention. Vincent Crabbe was being dragged by the ear toward Slughorn by Argus Filch.
The Hogwarts Express moved steadily north and the scenery outside became wilder and darker. Occasionally people ran past the door of the compartment, chasing friends of animals down the corridor.
Hermione laughed briefly. “Probably. From what I’ve heard, they find out a few hours after finding me and Penelope. Snape was on his way back to the dungeons from the hospital wing when he stumbled upon you in an empty corridor. He immediately alerted the other Professors. They were freaking out because you were attacked in a completely different location. But the attacks have stopped now – Professor McGonagall was here about twenty minutes ago and said that the culprit had been apprehended.”
“It was a magical virus,” Draco explained, his words slightly muffled from where his face was pressed against Harry’s shoulder. “It was eating away at them. I had to use magic to save them – so…Rosie knows now.”
She raised her head as much as she could with tremors of pain still wracking through her body. The Death Eaters were ignoring her prone form and instead were fixated on Harry’s loan figure. Voldemort was still facing her and she watched as his expression flitted from anger to annoyance to terrifying calm.
A horrible suspicion began to brew in Sarah’s chest and she suddenly found it difficult to draw a proper breath. Without looking at anybody she stood from her chair and rushed from the room, ignoring the calls of her name behind her. She ran until she found herself outside near the lake, trees surrounding her on all sides.
A body sat next to her and put an arm around her shoulders. She melted into the familiar warmth, turning her face away from the lake for the first time in hours to bury it into a soft jumper.
He sheepishly smiled at her and grabbed her hand again. “All right, I’ll stop,” he promised as he held the door to the pub open for her. “Do you want a drink? I can go get – Blimey, is that
“Everyone’s allowed a day to cry, darling,” Draco said softly. “Although, I must say that you’re lucky I sit so far back in the library or else I fear you’d be scaring the other students. You are Slytherin’s Ice Queen after all.”
“Yeh look tired,” he commented with a worried look on his bearded face. “Yer not puttin’ too much pressure on yerselves, are yeh?”
Lyra raised a hand to silence him. Her voice was quiet as she said, “I don’t know why I thought this would work. There’s just too much bad history between us.” She ignored Harry as he tried to reach out for her, turning around and walking down the empty corridor. “Draco and I will figure something else out, Potter.”
“Well, I’m sure that was quite a harrowing time for Ron,” Hermione explained. “And having that associated with the image of his best friend’s genitalia may be unsettling.”
Harry’s eyes opened and he let out a cry of pain. Once the cloudiness had disappeared from his green irises, the manic laughter cut off and he lay on the ground staring up at the ceiling, heavy pants falling from his chest.
The door opened and snapped Harry out of his frenzied thoughts. He sat up straighter as Draco walked in before pausing, shaking his head with a slight smile.
She threw one more hate-filled glare at Professor Lockhart before marching through the crowd, Draco at her side.
sake, I’ll give you another chance. But this is your last one – one more time screwing us over and it’s done.”
She relaxed on his back as he ducked through the door Draco was holding open for them. The others had disappeared into the living room so the trio followed.
Unfortunately, Hermione had already gone to bed by the time they returned to the common room and Ron had finished apologising to everyone he had hurt in the last few days. Harry had clapped him on the shoulder, smiling in relief, while Ginny had just scowled and flounced away, her red hair dancing behind her.
“Er…” Harry said dumbly, “because she was the first person I found and then I sort of became distracted?” He sheepishly smiled at his boyfriend and ran a hand through his thick curls. “I meant to tell you, I just – er – forgot…”
“Love you,” she told him. She turned and pressed a kiss to Teddy’s button nose. “And love you too, little man. Look after Freddie for me, okay?” Teddy gurgled happily in response.
Breakfast was a very noisy affair at the Gryffindor table on the morning of the third task. The post owls appeared, bringing Harry a good-luck card from Sirius and Remus. It was only a piece of parchment, folded over and bearing a buddy paw print on its front, but Harry seemed to appreciate it all the same. A screech owl delivered the
Rosie sighed pitifully and traced a finger down her cheek in imitation of a falling tear. “Shame,” she said. “Guess neither of us are getting laid any time soon.”
Flint and Wood approached each other and grasped each other’s hand very tightly; it looked as though each was trying to break the other’s fingers.
won’t do, now, will it? I should like you, please, to reply ‘Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge.’ One more time, please. Good afternoon, class!”
“Pansy, I told you, I’ve been studying the entire time,” Sarah said calmly. “Now I’m taking a break. There’s no need to worry myself the night before when I could relax.”
A moment later, Remus appeared at the end of the hall, Teddy wrapped around his side, a bib tucked into his shirt covered in food mush.
When she reached the landing, however, she found herself face-to-face with not a tiny old lady, but a great snake. Nagini struck her and she fell sideways through the open door, crashing painfully into a cabinet. She screamed as a vicelike grip fixed itself onto her leg.
“Er – well, when I freed him from your father he probably had nowhere to go. Maybe Dumbledore hired him?” said Harry.
Voldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving slowly overhead, and he seemed to be lost in thought.
“It’s not up to me, you filth,” Sarah said harshly, wrenching her robes out of his hands and stepping back into Draco’s steadying arms. “You ruined Harry’s life, it’s up to him what happens to you.”
“There you are, Harry, I knew they’d drag you into it somehow,” said Hermione, looking over Sarah’s shoulder at the
“It’s not that we didn’t tell you because we didn’t trust you,” Harry said softly. “We just knew you would care enough to get involved and we didn’t want that.”
“Good thing you were brought up for nonsense like this,” Blaise muttered to her, smiling slightly at a passing partygoer.
“You keep doing that and it’s going to get difficult to stop,” panted Harry as Draco’s tongue circled a raised nipple.
“I’ve completed all my tests and everyone is free to go,” the matron said kindly. “All the students are in the Great Hall for dinner – don’t worry about changing.” She walked off, leaving the pair sitting in confused silence.
But she was cut off by Harry groaning miserably. She whirled around in time to see Lockhart pale slightly, his toothy grin faltering.
“We have to go and find her!” Fred’s voice said loudly. “She’s smart. She would have found somewhere to hide!”
Harry left them as they arrived at the Great Hall, veering toward the Gryffindor table as Lyra and Draco headed toward the Slytherin table.
“We’ll wait outside, Molly,” Tonks said. “Arthur won’t want too many visitors at once…It ought to be just the family first.”
Against Sarah’s will, her body began to shake. She was absolutely horrified: Umbridge was planning on using the Cruciatus Curse on a
“Tonks is living with him and Sirius now,” Ron said quietly. “She’s apparently getting pretty big too.”
Half the crowd seemed to realise what was happening; the Irish supporters rose in another great wave of green, screaming their Seeker on…but Krum was on his tail. How he could see where he was going, Sarah had no idea; there were flecks of blood flying through the air behind him, but he was drawing level with Lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward the ground again –
Harry nodded. “It also doesn’t help that Seamus and a few others don’t believe me about Voldemort being back,” he muttered. “I was just telling Draco.”
A woman with floor-length black hair appeared. Her skeletal, green-tinged face split wide as a long, wailing shriek sounded – a banshee.
“Stop sulking,” Sarah continued, “Viktor asked Hermione. Get over it and don’t ruin this night for everyone else because you’re in a funk.”
“What?” she said innocently, stirring her tea and accepting a kiss from Fred when he appeared beside the table.
“What?” Rosie started, but broke off with a gasp as he waved his wand over the dog in front of him, resulting in a colourful diagram to appear.
“It’s muggle,” Sarah said in surprise. “That must mean whoever owned it was probably a half-blood or muggle-born.”
One problem that arose, however, was that Rita Skeeter had published a horrid article depicting Hermione as playing with Viktor and Harry’s affections. It included the picture of Harry and Hermione taken before the first task and a quote from Viktor from the end of the second task. Both Viktor and Hermione had no idea how Rita had overheard their private conversation and Hermione had been on a warpath ever since, trying to find out if Rita was doing something illegal.
“Naturally,” said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. “Never saw one without the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here – ooh, they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James Potter!”
“Maybe they just need this really big fight to come back together?” Harry suggested in a hopeful voice. “And then they’ll be less likely to fight to this extent again.”
Weasley, however, just shrugged. “I trust Harry,” he said. “And for some reason, Harry trusts you. Besides, you weren’t horrible last time we spoke.”
“I did some reading a while ago,” she admitted. “When I first started to have my suspicions. And I found that there are multiple different options for same-sex couples when it comes to children. So, if in the future, you find yourself in a situation where you need an heir but can’t have one naturally…well, you have options.”
! They didn’t give their health and their sanity so their only son would be ashamed of them, you know!”
The silver stag burst from his wand and charged: the Dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight. Sarah took a deep breath as warmth began to flow back into her shivering limbs.
knew you liked each other,” he said. “When you and Lyra came back I was so sure that you would take the night to think about it and then confess to him in the morning but she was sure you would go straight to Draco.”
“So, we thought we would just say that if the Minister knew what he was doing, he wouldn’t be very happy – “
But sometimes, deep inside him, he couldn’t help but remember his Uncle’s cruel comments about people on TV. Harry knew that his Uncle’s opinions were worth less than centaur shit but it didn’t stop the niggling little voice in the back of his mind from telling him that he was a freak,
They had nearly reached the entrance to the tower when Hermione and Weasley suddenly appeared before them, battling two towering Death Eaters. Lyra raised her wand but Severus yanked her arm down, hissing at her furiously, “Do not intervene!”
“So!” said Umbridge triumphantly, looking down upon her prey. “So…you think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp, do you?”
Sarah waited a few days to see if Ron’s behaviour would improve. It didn’t. His new aggression actually seemed to be getting worse. He had been constantly arguing with Hermione in between classes and refused to sit with any of them even at mealtimes. The night before the Quidditch match, Sarah’s tolerance finally snapped.
“Come on, Neville. Let’s go sit by the fire,” Sarah said kindly, leading the distraught boy toward the table commandeered by Hermione and Draco. She ran her fingers through Draco’s hair in greeting and he gave her a kiss on the cheek.
At last, the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle. Sarah found it peaceful, rather than gloomy – she had always loved the snow. She and Draco took advantage of the empty common room and spent most of their evenings researching what could be hiding in the Chamber.
“Oh, so it was a misunderstanding that he was warming your bed at the same time that he was dating me?” Lyra said loudly. She straightened and turned away from them. “Lovely talk, Greengrass – or sorry, is it Nott now?”
It was then that she noticed the thin, shabby black diary clutched in a death grip in Ginny’s freckled hand.
Harry checked his watch again and nearly stopped breathing when he realised that Draco was due any moment. It was a stupid, impulsive decision but it wasn’t like Harry could just take back the invitation when the food was already steaming on the kitchen counter and –
to Sarah, who unfolded the paper, glanced at the front page, and spat out a mouthful of tea all over it.
Sarah, Harry and Draco walked slowly back up the grounds toward the castle through the crowd, many of whom shouted congratulations at Harry.
“Why’s that?” Harry spat, struggling against Hermione and Draco’s grips. Draco wrapped an arm firmly around Harry’s own and Harry relaxed fractionally. But his eyes were still a fiery green that shone out clearly in the dark room. “Didn’t care last time, did you? Didn’t mind slaughtering all those muggles to get at Pettigrew…What’s the matter, gone soft in Azkaban?”
“Do it! You have no idea of the danger we are in!” shrieked Bellatrix. Her grip on Sarah’s hair was extremely painful and Sarah could feel a few strands break free from her scalp.
“Well, well, well,” said Umbridge, looking triumphant. “Little Miss Perfect is going to give us some answers! Come on then, girl, come on!”
Sarah let herself float upward and broke the bubbly surface, pushing the water out of her face. Draco and Harry burst up beside her and shook their heads vigorously, droplets spraying everywhere.
“Vell, ve fought bravely,” said a gloomy voice behind Sarah. She pulled back from Fred to see the Bulgarian Minister of Magic smiling down at their row.
“I could hear the match commentary from here,” said Ron, his voice shaking with laughter. “I hope Luna always commentates from now on…
They went to dinner with everybody else but did not return to their common rooms afterwards. Harry had the cloak hidden down the front of his robes; Sarah couldn’t help laughing every time she saw him awkwardly folding his arms to keep the lump hidden.
“What about Goyle?” Sarah asked. “How are you going to keep him away from the common room? Also, how are you going to explain that Tracey suddenly decided to return? There’s so much that can go wrong with this plan!”
“What do you want?” she asked tiredly, rubbing a hand down her face. “I just want to go to dinner – “
!” Sarah continued, ignoring Harry’s comment. “That’s what is amazing! We need to find Draco now – Oi! Seamus! Have you seen Draco?”
“I don’t recall you ever stating anything of the sort,” she said stubbornly, releasing Fred to cross her arms over her chest.
And then Harry was there. Directly behind him were Hermione and Ron, both clutching at Harry so they didn’t lose him. Ron caught hold of Sarah’s free arm as Harry latched onto Draco, and Sarah felt Hermione turn on the spot; sight and sound were extinguished as darkness pressed in upon her; all she could feel was Ron’s hand as she squeezed through space and time, away from the Burrow, away from the descending Death Eaters, away, perhaps, from Voldemort himself…
Mrs Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing her arms. Bellatrix spun on the spot, roaring with laughter at the sight of her new challenger.
When he stepped through the door, it closed behind him and Draco pushed him up against the wood, kissing him hungrily.
“No, you can obviously ask it. It just means I won’t answer,” Lyra corrected. “What I will say, however, is that if you are still interested in Draco, you should talk to him about it.” She paused for a moment and then added. “So, are you?”
“Right then,” said Aberforth, when they had eaten their fill and slumped dozily in their chairs. “We need to think of the best way to get you out of here. Can’t be done by night, you heard what happens if anyone moves outdoors during darkness: Caterwauling Charm’s set off, they’ll be on to you like Bowtruckles on Doxy eggs. I don’t reckon I’ll be able to pass off a stag as a goat a second time. Wait for daybreak, when curfew lifts, then you can put your Cloak back on and set out on foot. Get right out Hogsmeade, up into the mountains, and you’ll be able to Disapparate there. Might see Hagrid. He’s been hiding in a cave up there with Grawp ever since they tried to arrest him.”
“If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will not be with us for very long. He seems aware, himself, that his time is short. He positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him – “
“Only Sarah would shout at a teacher and get away with it,” Draco sighed, reclining more comfortably against the headboard.
“We’re good,” Harry replied, trying to stop the blush that he could feel threatening to creep up his neck. “I’m not too sure what we’re going to do once summer’s over, though.”
Remus and Tonks had got up hastily and retreated so that Mr and Mrs Weasley could get nearer to the bed. Mrs Weasley bent over her son and pressed her lips to his bloody forehead.
“Worse even than that, m’dear…” Fudge dropped his voice and proceeded in a sort of low rumble. “Not many people are aware that the Potters knew You-Know-Who was after them. Dumbledore, who was, of course, working tirelessly against You-Know-Who, had a number of useful spies. One of them tipped him off, and he alerted James and Lily at once. He advised them to go into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know-Who wasn’t an easy person to hide from. Dumbledore told them that their best chance was the Fidelius Charm.”
Draco didn’t hesitate to hurry after his boyfriend, Snape’s eyes trailing him disapprovingly. The black eyes suddenly shot to Sarah, who pursed her lips and held eye contact for a moment before turning back to cleaning up the last of their workplaces.
“You’d better open it, Ron,” said Draco in a timid whisper. “It’ll be worse if you don’t. My father used to make the elves listen to any Howlers he ignored – it was horrible.”
It was much easier getting out of the party than getting in. When they were in the corridor, Harry produced his Invisibility Cloak.
“So,” said Hagrid, rubbing his hands together and beaming around, “if yeh wan’ ter come a bit nearer – “
Sirius laughed and walked over to her bed. He brushed back her hair tenderly as he took a seat next to Draco.
“Oh yes,” said Professor Umbridge, smiling widely as before. “Yes, I think we can etch the message a little deeper with another evening’s work.”
Draco nodded in reflection. “Yes. Lyra and I were separated and she was apparently beyond distraught. Turns out, George found her right before she would have gone over the edge. He had just lost his twin so he understood her fear. That seemed to be the real start of their friendship.”
“I’m going to sit out on this one,” Sarah said. She smiled weakly at the others. “I’m finding it a bit difficult to stay upright. I’ll be downstairs when you’re done.”
“You think that you were exposed to the magical virus and then introduced it to the animals,” Rosie summarised. “Why wouldn’t more – what did you call it, Muggle? – Why wouldn’t more Muggle animals fall ill from contact with magical viruses then?”
“You don’t think it was us, Professor?” Harry repeated hopefully as Dumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk.
The Death Eaters swarmed forward, stepping over Sarah or kicking her as they passed. Her father sneered down at her one last time before taking his rightful place amongst the followers.
He waved his wand. Old-fashioned wooden hoops instantly appeared on the floor in front of every student.
“Actually, I grabbed it,” Sarah said, pulling her bag toward her once more. “I put it in after Harry threw – “
defensive spells?” Professor Umbridge repeated with a little laugh. “Why, I can’t imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would require you to
“I could be on here?” Harry said in amazement. “Do you think it would adjust to include the other Potters?”
Sarah nodded. “Exactly. I also think the dreams you’ve been having about that corridor and door aren’t yours, but his because
For a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratching quills on parchment. When everyone had copied down the three course aims, she said, “Has everybody got a copy of
“You did it!” Sarah cried, kissing the side of his head and wiping sweat and dirt off his face. “You were brilliant, Harry!”
“No, it wouldn’t,” urged Fred. “It’d still be his. But I would at least like to be prepared. Because it would also mean that if something happened to
“Me,” said Moody grimly. “And unless you’ve got anything to say to Potter, Karkaroff, you might want to move. You’re blocking the doorway.”
“No,” she said, stepping in front of Greg and crossing her arms over her chest. “You’re not taking him.”
“I – um – well – er – “ he stuttered briefly as Sarah kept looking at him in shock. Suddenly, his face changed; it turned from panicked to determined. “I mean it. I love you, Sarah.”
As the werewolf reared, snapping its long jaws, Sirius disappeared. He had transformed. The enormous, bearlike dog bounded forward. As the werewolf took a step forward, the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backwards, away from their group. Hermione was dragging away a still unconscious Snape as fast as she could.
“Every night,” Pansy replied in a whisper. “It’s usually not obvious but sometimes I wake up for a glass of water and she’s in bed, reading.”
“You say you remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,” murmured Professor McGonagall. “Do you remember who his best friend was?”
“Thank you, sir,” she said politely, scanning the list. “Wait, half of these people don’t even play Quidditch.” She looked closer at the list. “They’re not even in Slytherin!”
“Took you long enough to get here,” continued Ron as the three women cooed over Teddy, whose hair began changing colour rapidly to match theirs. “I already saw Blaise, he said that he and the Slytherins are going to get a compartment in the next carriage – we won’t all fit in one.”
“I miss dear Cissy,” crooned Walburga. “She was of good breeding stock. Unlike my traitorous son, befriending half-breeds and blood-traitors.”
. Harry, you’re just getting carried away. Please,” she said, as he started to speak, “please just answer me this. If the Deathly Hallows really existed, and Dumbledore knew about them, knew that the person who possessed all three of them would be master of Death – Harry, why wouldn’t he have told you? Why?”
“I want that, too,” Fred breathed, looking at her in wonder. “You’ll have a library and I’ll have to drag you out of it to spend time with me. Or I’ll just sit with you, watching as you read.”
Her father was pressing so tightly against Sarah’s windpipe that she could not breath – through watering eyes she saw Sirius duelling with a Death Eater some ten feet away, Kingsley was fighting two at once; Tonks, still halfway up the tiered seats, was firing spells down at Bellatrix – nobody seemed to realise that Sarah, Harry and Neville were cornered.
“Harry, I hope you know how much I love you,” Sarah muttered moodily. He simply smiled at her and kissed her cheek lightly before hurrying off after the twins.
Cauldron Coffees was a quaint little store with beautiful dark wood panelling along the walls and pale floorboards. Comfy armchairs with low-set tables filled the space and the intoxicating aroma of coffee beans filled the air. Sarah and Fred found a small couch in the back corner positioned next to the window, offering a gorgeous view of the snow-capped hills in the distance.
The smile faded slowly from Lockhart’s face. For a few tense moments he gazed intently at Harry, then he said, “Haven’t we met?”
“Take this to Professor McGonagall, dears,” said Professor Umbridge, holding the not out to them. “I will also be talking to Professor Snape later this evening.”
Regardless, she pushed those thoughts to the back of her mind and instead drew Harry toward the chairs situated in front of Dumbledore’s desk.
Unfortunately, when Sarah and Draco pushed into the kitchen twenty minutes later, it was to find Snape and Sirius standing opposite each other, wands raised. Remus had his own wand out and was watching the two men wearily as Harry stood between them, his arms outstretched. They all froze comically as Sarah and Draco entered, eyes wide.
“No, Harry, I don’t,” said Dumbledore, though his face was sombre again. “But I still want to talk to you. Miss Deaumont, if you would please wait outside – “
“He’s angry and jealous and doesn’t think,” Sarah said flatly, tears pricking her eyes. “But I will never
Draco nodded and slowed his pace for approximately five minutes before finding an important piece of information and losing himself in his frantic researching once again.
“I’m guessing your father runs some stupid little village newsletter?” she said. “’Twenty-five Ways to Mingle with Muggles’ and the dates of the next Bring-and-Fly Sale?”
The morning of the first Hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy. After breakfast, Sarah, Draco, Blaise, Pansy, Millicent and Theo queued up in front of Filch, who matched their names to the long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to visit the village. Sarah still wasn’t talking to Harry, but Hermione had told her that he had agreed to Hermione’s idea for a Defense group. Some students would be meeting at the Hog’s Head later in the day so Hermione could talk to them.
of us until you figure out how you’re going to come and grovel for our forgiveness – if we’re even willing to give it to you.”
“Right you lot, you need to be careful, because doxies bite and their teeth are poisonous. I’ve got a bottle of antidote here, but I’d rather nobody needed it,” said Mrs Weasley.
“It probably wouldn’t be until after the Christmas break,” Fred said quietly. “We need to finalise a few more things…”
Fred’s eye opened, looking like warm honey in the sunlight. He shifted slightly so that he could properly face Sarah without letting go of her.
“Well, Blaise-y and I have been speaking with dear Millie and Theo, and we’ve come to a mutual consensus that it would be advantageous to us if we were to accept your overture of protection, if it is still obtainable?” Pansy stated flippantly, waving a manicured hand through the air. Despite her casual nature, Lyra could tell she was extremely nervous about the entire situation due to her use of overly complicated words. “Also, your positive endorsement of us will ensure that after this whole debacle is settled, people will have less distasteful sentiments regarding us.”
“Well, there you have it!” he said, tottering back onto the platform. “That was a Disarming Charm – as you see, I’ve lost my wand – ah, thank you, Miss Brown – yes, excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don’t mind me saying so, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy – however, I felt it would be instructive to let them see…”
“You’re even more attractive up close,” Verity said shamelessly. “If you ever decide you want to take a chance with girls, send me an owl.”
“Arthur!” said Mrs Weasley suddenly. She had risen from her chair; her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window. “Arthur – it’s Percy!”
George turned to look at her with pain-filled brown eyes. “It gets worse the longer I think about it,” he admitted. His eyes widened slightly. “Did you find Draco? I’m sorry, I promised I would help you – “
Sarah and Harry scrambled down the benches one by one until they reached the stone bottom of the sunken pit. Their footsteps echoed loudly as they walked slowly toward the dais. The pointed archway looked much taller from where Sarah stood now than when she had been looking down on it from above. Still, the veil swayed gently, as though somebody had just passed through it.
“Thank Merlin, you’re back,” Blaise said with a yawn. He hauled himself off the couch and pulled Theo to his feet, who teetered slightly and rested his head on Sarah’s shoulder when she stood beside him to steady the boy.
Lupin turned back to Sarah and seemed to crumble at her expression. “Okay, you can still live with me –
“We even figured out how to stop puking long enough to swallow the other side of the Pastille,” Fred said proudly.
, the next was permission to pick their own mistletoe, and the last a warning to keep off the dirigible plums.
On Monday, they entered the Great Hall for breakfast at exactly the same moment as the post owls. Sarah helped herself to some juice, when the first owl landed with a thud in front of her, causing her to pause and glance up at it in surprise.
“If you’re going to ignore me, at least have the decency to notify me beforehand so that I don’t waste the effort of talking to you.”
“I only have about twenty pounds,” said Sarah. “All right, then, I’m off. Don’t do anything scandalous.”
Sarah turned to look at him and squeezed his waist tighter. “I missed you, too,” she said sincerely. “But I’m still pissed at you. You and Ron are both being idiots and it’s not far to Hermione or Draco or me!”
“Oi! I heard that, you harpy!” Draco exclaimed from where he was sitting next to Harry, the pair whispering quietly to Sirius.
Sirius had taken to walking through the halls, piles of tinsel in his hands, singing “God Rest Ye Merry, Hippogriffs” at the top of his voice. Walburga Black woke up on more than one occasion and it took the combined efforts of Sarah, Remus and Draco to drag Sirius away from her portrait so he wouldn’t sing obnoxiously in her face. Draco always had to spend a few minutes calming down the old woman with polite words and fake smiles.
“Ron, you know the Map doesn’t lie!” Sarah said. “If Lupin saw Pettigrew’s name then it means he was with us and the
“SILENCE!” cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a flash of bright light, and silence was forced upon them all. “It is over! Set him down, Hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!”
Draco got her back the next day when he pushed her headfirst into the pond in the next field. Since then, a brutal war of pranks had commenced – only coming to a screeching halt when Mrs Weasley put her foot down after Sarah and Harry had dyed Draco’s hair bright pink and in retaliation, Draco and the twins had caused the pair’s hair to disappear.
“And paid for by wizards,” said Bill quietly, and the goblin shot him a look that was both furtive and challenging.
Lyra turned to glare at Harry, who blanched and said defensively, “I only told them a little, okay? I thought they should know before everyone started asking them questions.”
Sarah, Draco, Harry, Ron and Hermione were spending all of their time together. The beautiful weather seemed to mock them. Sarah spent nearly almost as much time in the hospital wing, helping Madam Pomfrey and keeping Bill company as she tended to his wounds. His scars were as bad as ever – in truth, he now bore a distinct resemblance to Mad-Eye Moody, though thankfully with both eyes and legs – but in personality he seemed just the same as ever. All that appeared to have changed was that he now had a great liking for very rare steaks.
“I don’t blame her,” Harry said quietly. “This time last year she had just been crushed by a giant snake.”
Sarah looked around as they entered. Snape had imposed his personality upon the room already; it was gloomier than usual, as curtains had been drawn over the windows, and was lit by candlelight. New pictures adorned the walls, many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain, sporting grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts. Nobody spoke as they settled down, looking around at the shadowy, gruesome pictures.
Draco was twitching slightly beside Sarah; punctuality had been trained into them since birth and the thought of being late to the train filled them with anxiety.
Sarah watched silently as Draco tried to get Harry to leave Dumbledore’s side but the boy refused to budge. It wasn’t until Draco stood up and took Harry’s hand that the other boy allowed himself to be pulled to his feet.
“I can still get owls,” Draco said without thinking. “If it’s easier for you, just send me the days you’re free and I’ll sort the rest out.”
“I don’t know, Harry, I don’t know…There are an awful lot of things that could go wrong, so much relies on chance…”
. The easy carelessness he had had with Potter after being released from the Hospital Wing nearly two months ago had not returned (although Draco adamantly blamed his carefree behaviour on the numerous pain-numbing potions he had been given), despite Lyra’s best efforts. Draco could simply not comprehend how his twin was able to act as if the last five odd years had never happened and effortlessly assimilate into the Gryffindors’ circle. Draco suspected it was both Lyra and Granger’s love for fiction novels that was an unfortunate bridge between them. Yet, despite this, Draco was coming to find that the Golden Trio were not as intolerable as he had originally perceived.
“Harry, you shouldn’t think about things like that,” he said softly. “There is no power to bring the dead back.”
“I simply enjoy the beauty of nature and thought you might appreciate it with me,” Sarah breezed. “Look at all the pretty trees.”
Sarah huffed a laugh at that. They had foolishly agreed to let their friends help them move. Trying to work around Hermione’s suggestions, Blaise’s commentary and Draco and Harry randomly snogging in various rooms was a nightmare and one that Sarah was very glad to be rid of.
Harry held out his left hand. The other three vanished beneath the Cloak. The printing press blocking the stairs was vibrating: Xenophilius was trying to shift it using a Hover Charm.
“Maybe don’t curse him?” he suggested placatingly. “Just race him around the pitch or something. That way no one gets hurt.”
“That’s sick,” Ron muttered, watching the smallest Muggle child, who had begun to spin like a top, sixty feet above the ground, his head flopping limply from side to side. “That is really sick…”
A tiny white dot had reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and now Ariana was walking back towards them, growing bigger and bigger as she came. But there was somebody else with her now, someone taller than she was, who was limping along looking excited. His hair was longer than Sarah had ever seen it: he appeared to have suffered several gashes to his face and his clothes were ripped and torn. Larger and larger the two figures grew, until only their heads and shoulders filled the portrait. Then the whole thing swung forwards on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a real tunnel was revealed. And out of it, his hair overgrown, his face cut, his robes ripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece and yelled, “I know you’d come!
The rest of dinner passed quickly with Teddy steering the conversation to any topic, with both Harry and Draco adding comments when the boy paused to breathe or eat. More than once, Harry caught himself staring at Draco and how the light bounced off his white-blond hair, how his eyes shone silver when he laughed at Teddy’s stories.
They crept out of the office and back toward the door into the black hallway, which now seemed completely deserted. They walked a few steps forward, Neville tottering slightly due to Hermione’s weight. The door of the Time Room swung shut behind them, and the walls began to rotate once more. Harry stumbled slightly and Draco grabbed him by the waist.
Lyra and Draco looked at each other in surprise but didn’t reply. They had a silent conversation that went slightly like this:
“They seem unaffected,” she said thickly. “I already called Mindy while I was waiting for you. She’s going to arrive soon to keep an eye on them for any changes.”
“I think so,” said Lupin, holding Scabbers tightly in one hand and his wand in the other. “One – two – THREE!”
“This is Mila Lehmann,” he indicated to the curvy girl sitting beside him, “and this is Aleksander Bachkov,” he turned to the tall, lean boy on the other side of Mila. “They are my close friends.”
“So, what seems to be the problem?” he asked as he began the usual checkup. The cat was unusually subdued and Draco frowned slightly, not liking the lack of response from the feline.
“Don’t be stupid, Harry. Potions is really important for nearly every career,” Draco said, making another mark on his list.
Fred and George exchanged a look and then nodded at her. George slipped the bag into a pocket and clapped Harry on the shoulder in thanks.
He smiled at her and leant back down, kissing her deeply. She smiled into the kiss and shifted so that Fred’s comforting weight was resting along her body.
One by one, the Bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box, and Bagman called out the name of each as they shook hands with their own minister and then with Fudge. Krum, who was last in line, looked a real mess. Two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face. He was still holding the Snitch. Sarah noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the ground. He was slightly duck-footed and distinctly round-shouldered. But when Krum’s name was announced, the whole stadium gave him a resounding, ear-splitting roar.
“I’m just amazed you managed to Apparate us without leaving half of us behind,” Draco muttered as they crept toward the house.
“Why were you just carrying that around with you?” Draco hissed as they all huddled under and began to creep down the hallway on silent feet.
so Sarah zoned them out. She was pissed that Hermione didn’t warn her but she knew that it was a good idea. She just didn’t know how she felt about having to retell the night’s events again. She felt Fred’s warm hand rest comfortingly on her thigh and she turned to smile at him.
Everyone began leaving once Bagman and Crouch had finished speaking. Viktor gave Sarah and Harry one last sympathetic glance before following Karkaroff out of the room.
Hermione let out a piercing shriek behind Sarah that was swallowed up by the rushing wind. Sarah did not think she had ever moved so fast. The thestral streaked over the castle, the tall towers zooming passed in a blue of stone. They were over the Hogwarts grounds, they had passed Hogsmeade. Sarah could see mountains and gullies below them. In the falling darkness Sarah saw small collections of lights as they passed over more villages, then a winding road on which a single car was beetling its way home through the hills…
“We haven’t been allowed in the meetings,” Sarah said sourly. “Sirius and Remus update us when they can but it seems like there isn’t really anything to tell. They’re planning something but because the Fidelius was only just completed, they haven’t been able to have any larger meetings yet.”
Sarah rolled her eyes and continued, “What about each summer where I changed my eye or hair colour?”
,” she purred, running a hand down Draco’s cheek. “If I didn’t love my girlfriend so much, I would eat you right up.”
Draco reluctantly followed Lyra to the two seats crammed next to each other in between Granger and Potter. Of course, it was Potter. Draco could never seem to be rid of the boy-who-lived-to-annoy-him.
“Yes,” Harry said, gripping his wand very tightly, and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom.
“Cracked skull,” said Sarah, walking up and pushing him back against the pillows. “Rest. Pomfrey wants you here overnight. You shouldn’t overexert yourself for a few hours.”
Lyra pinned him with a silencing glare and continued, “Draco, be honest. You have been obsessed with Harry since forever.”
Everyone looked up and sure enough, Percy Weasley was striding across the front lawn toward the door.
Harry looked worried for a moment before Ron interrupted him, “Don’t even try arguing, Mum has everything planned out already.”
“And now,” he said, “it is time for two of our number to recognise each other for what they are. Sirius…if you could resume your usual form.”
“I know what you’re doing, darling and frankly I’m offended,” Pansy stated. “I am excellent company.”
Their ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher pushed open the double doors marking the entrance to the Spell Damage ward. He walked toward them, the long lilac dressing gown he was wearing swishing at his feet.
“Anyway,” Sirius added. “It’s not like you couldn’t have figured it out. Dear Bella’s name is on that horrid tapestry in the other room. You know she’s my cousin, remember?”
“Hello Sarah,” Blaise said, looking up. His dark eyes widened as he looked behind her and he added, “And hello surprising addition.”
“But before we heard from Royal and Romulus,” Lee went on, “let’s take a moment to report those deaths that the
With that, he waved his wand, Vanishing the hoops, and walked out of the Hall accompanied by Professor McGonagall. Talk broke out at once as people began moving toward the entrance hall.
Sarah laughed. It was an overloud, bright sound but it helped her feel better. Fred joined in and soon they were both struggling to breathe from the force of their laughter.
“I’ll pop in and check on her tomorrow before the exam,” Sarah said, yawning. “We better head to bed.”
“And its Johnson, Johnson with the Quaffle, what a player that girl is, I’ve been saying it for years but she still won’t go out with me – “
! Merlin, you might figure out halfway through that it’s not for you and then decide to go get a Mastery in something. But at least you would have
“What about those that want to fight?” Sarah asked, looking desperately at Blaise, Theo and Pansy. “Surely, they’re allowed to stay.”
Sarah rolled her eyes. “Yes, but now you’re dating Draco,” she explained, as if it were obvious. “That means you need
Sarah and Draco had marched off to the Slytherin common room after visiting Hagrid, having had enough of Ron for the day. Harry had watched them sadly before leading Ron up the marble staircase.
Sarah just shook her head and looped her arm through Draco’s good one, pushing open the door for him when they arrived outside the Potions classroom.
. No! Don’t interrupt me, I’m not done,” Draco said as Snape opened his mouth to retort. Draco’s silver eyes were flaming as he stared down his godfather. “There is no excuse for the way you treat Neville or Harry or Hermione or hell,
“When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight, he was transported straight to Voldemort,” said Dumbledore steadily. “He witnessed Lord Voldemort’s rebirth. I will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office.”
“Have you thought of the possibility that he’s genuinely interested?” Lyra asked, noting to herself to tell Draco to dial it back a bit.
There was another beat of silence during which neither of them moved until Harry took a small step back.
“What? Are you Gryffindors not as open about these conversations?” Pansy asked innocently, her lips pulling into a smile that could only be defined as predatory.
They had to leave Remus, Sirius, Mrs Weasley, Bill and Harry after lunch to go to their final exams. They returned to the Great Hall for the evening feast. Viktor beckoned Sarah and Draco over and introduced them to his parents: a dark-haired woman and a towering man with Viktor’s hooked nose. Mila and Aleksander were happily conversing with them and the older couple warmed quickly to Sarah and Draco when they realised they could speak Bulgarian.
Harry sat down at their table in the Great Hall and tried not to moan as his head spun and his stomach turned. He looked at the pile of food before him and decided the safest option was the pot of coffee Parvati had just given up.
Sarah dropped to her knees beside Fred and held her wand tight in her hand. Blinking dust and tears out of her eyes, she began casting any spell she could think of over George’s body.
“What does he expect?” Hagrid said gruffly. “A cat is gonna do what cat’s do. It’s not yer fault, Hermione, if yer cat hunts a rat.”
Sarah was concentrating so hard on her own memory that she almost missed the wisp of silvery gas that whooshed suddenly out of Harry’s wand.
“We’ll see you in class,” Draco muttered to the others before leading the way back to the Slytherin table.
“He will not do either,” said Snape. “The Order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust everything to do with the place.”
“I can’t believe I get to shadow Madam Pomfrey,” Sarah said, grinning ear-to-ear as they walked down the corridors.
Why not bring Draco as well? His father was there and it’s not like he hasn’t disappointed the Malfoy name. No offence, darling,” she added to the blond.
Fred scowled darkly. “I’d be right alongside you, mate,” he said. “No one just gets to hurt my girlfriend and get away with it.”
He was right. Madam Pomfrey was anxiously hovering at the edge of the lake, a large table in front of her covered in towels and potion vials.
“Fudge cleared the charges against Sirius,” Remus explained. “They’ve spent the past few days making sure everyone knows he was wrongfully imprisoned.”
The last thing Draco heard before he and Harry disappeared up the stairs was Lyra descend into a detailed explanation (lie) about male pregnancies for a horrified Ron.
Harry glowered at it and left the room, walking into his bedroom and collapsing onto his bed. He let out a loud groan of misery and stuffed his face into the pillows.
Lyra watched slightly opened mouthed as Molly Weasley stepped towards her and Draco and put her hands on each of their shoulders, peering at them intently.
Snow was now swirling against the icy windows once more; Christmas was approaching fast. Hagrid had already single-handedly delivered the usual twelve Christmas trees for the Great Hall; garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs; everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of suits of armour and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridor.
She had trodden on the giant slug, which burst. Her scolding carried after them on the still air, mingling with the little boy’s yells – “You bust slug! You bust slug!”
Sarah and Draco ran through after him and found that the entire Gryffindor House were screaming, applauding and whistling.
“You can’t just say things like that and expect me to last,” he groaned. “But I take that as a yes?”
Sarah cursed and let go of her wand. She had been surreptitiously trying to summon the sweets she knew Draco kept in Harry’s room.
Harry stepped forward and placed a hand on her arm. “We’re not going to let Nott anywhere near you,” he said firmly.
“Kinky,” Blaise smirked, causing Sarah, Draco, Theo and Millicent to throw napkins and various utensils at him.
The day was relatively quiet, not that Draco was expecting a huge rush. He had just sent Rosie out with a late lunch order when the bell above the door trilled.
Sarah clenched her jaw tight to avoid making a scene. They needed Crabbe to go out and talk with Harry and Ron if the Gryffindors’ plan was going to work.
“You know too much,” the horrid voice continued. “It wasn’t my plan to hurt a pureblood but fortunately, your blood is so traitorous – a real pureblood would not be associating with mudbloods and half-breeds.”
“I assure you, Molly,” he said, visibility trying to keep his voice even, “that Remus and I have been doing everything we can to make this place more habitable. It hasn’t been occupied for nearly two decades.”
She went to his office whenever they were both free and spent a few hours talking about her mother during her Hogwarts years and after. Sometimes, she would bring Harry or Draco with her, but most of the time she went alone. There was something comforting about sitting in the older man’s presence as he talked about years gone.
“I doubt many people are going to be interested in hiring ex-Death Eaters,” Draco said darkly. “But we’ll try to get the best grades we can.”
“Enough about me,” she continued as they entered the sunroom to find a quaint tea service set up in front of the low chairs. “How was the Ministry gala last night?”
Despite his worry, Harry was finding it very easy to chat with Draco. He was extremely intelligent and had an opinion on everything. All Harry had to do was mention something controversial and Draco was off, hands waving through the air as he passionately spoke. But they also spent a majority of the time in comfortable silence. Harry would hover behind the counter, occasionally serving customers while Draco curled up on a nearby chair, reading and offering comments every so often. Those days were the ones that Harry enjoyed the most.
When Sarah walked back into the room a few minutes later, everyone was ready to go. Ginny, Gabrielle and Sarah were all wearing the same golden dresses, while Fleur wore a stunning white gown. Madame Delacour wore a grey dress yet still looked just as stunning as Fleur.
Several things happened at once: first, Sarah choked on her mouthful of scalding tea and barely managed to stop from spraying at across the table onto Harry, and second, there was a noise like a plug being withdrawn from a sink and Ron surfaced. Hermione acted as though she had not seen or heard anything.
Draco laughed loudly. “She had found this hideous dress at a second-hand shop and decided to ‘work her magic on it’, in her words. I swear, I have never seen so much bleach and fabric dye used. In the end, it became this mind-boggling concoction of hand-drawn designs and coloured patches. In some places you could still see the original pattern but Rosie said it just added to the complete picture. If I hadn’t known her, I definitely would have thought she was insane.”
“Well now,” she said finally, setting down her quill and looking like a toad about to swallow a particularly juicy fly. “What would you like to drink?”
“As long as you’re sure, dear,” Mrs Weasley said lightly. “Now – you both don’t mind helping me take these dishes out?”
“Remind me again why we can’t just say at Hogwarts?” Draco asked, cringing at the slight whining tone of his voice.
“What are – oh,” Draco said, holding up the letter. His face paled slightly and he looked as if his last mouthful of toast had gotten stuck in his throat. “These are…”
“Not as bad as it could have been,” was the terse response. “You’re lucky, Miss Deaumont, that it was just a scratch and not a bite.”
something to worry about, Sarah being one of them. She thought she was started to understand Snape’s cryptic warning now.
“ – you meant that Black and Pettigrew switched as Secret-Keeper without telling anyone,” Draco finished.
To Lyra, Blaise and Pansy’s surprise, Harry stepped forward and pulled Lyra into a tight hug. He was surprisingly taller than Lyra remembered; she thought that he must have been nearly the same height as Draco.
“…they searched the whole area but they couldn’t find the snake anywhere, it just seems to have vanished after it attacked you, Arthur…but You-Know-Who can’t have expected a snake to get it, can he?”
“Is there a problem here?” said a mild voice. Professor Lupin had just gotten out of the next carriage.
“No,” Harry said, and Bill looked startled. “I need both of them here. I need to talk to them. It’s important.”
“Teddy, why don’t you go tell Molly all about the kittens that were just born?” Draco suggested, running a hand over the boy’s now white-blond hair fondly. “Harry and I need to have some adult talk before I can come see the chickens with you.”
Saturday morning dawned a beautiful mix of pink and blue. Not that Sarah or Draco could see it, stuck under the lake as they were. Instead, they were sitting in front of the fire, working through their Charms essay while sunlight trickled through the water, sending sparkling reflections across the common room.
“I don’t know what they hit him with,” said Luna sadly, “but he’s gone a bit funny, I could hardly get him along at all…”
“Oh, you should have seen your face,” he chuckled, wiping his eyes. “You looked terrified. Don’t worry darling, I want to finish my training before any talks of marriage start.”
“I’m sorry!” shouted Sarah as the Quaffle shot through the left hoop, despite Ron’s effort to catch it. “I know you can do it, Ron!”
you! If they find out who they’ve got – !” They’re Snatchers, they’re only looking for truants to sell for gold – “
by the solitary ray of sunlight falling onto his bed. He looked around as they walked toward him, and seeing whom it was, beamed.
“Exactly!” Ron said in excitement. “So all we need to do is get some Basilisk fangs and we can destroy the one we have.”
Mr Weasley marched Sarah and Harry across the short stretch of pavement toward the first of two old-fashioned dark green cars, each was driven by a furtive-looking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet.
Harry burst into an explanation of the skeletal horses that had dragonish heads and pupil-less white eyes. They had vast, black leathery wings similar to those of a bat. Sarah listened in interest as Harry described them, sounding less and less distressed as he talked.
“I haven’t done something like that in years,” panted Draco, wiping snow off his face but leaving behind a trail of cold water.
“Shut up,” he grumbled. Suddenly, he slouched lower in his seat. “Actually, it’s getting quite tiring if I’m being honest. It’s all physical with her.”
“Well, move along, then!” said Professor McGonagall sharply to the bedraggled crows. “Into the Great Hall, come on!”
“Yes! Let’s go!” Harry agreed. His face was still burning and he wanted to get away from Draco as fast as he could. He hurried to the Floo and threw the powder into the fireplace, glancing over his shoulder briefly before he stepped in. The image of Lyra struggling not to laugh while Draco looked at her in confusion remained with him as he tumbled out into the Burrow’s living room.
“I beg your pardon?” Voldemort said, taking a step forward. “I must have misheard you, Draco. I could have sworn you said, ‘no’…”
Sarah turned her attention back to her own gifts when Seamus threw a piece of wrapping paper at her.
“Honestly, Harry, is that all you care about?” Sarah said grumpily, crossing her arms. Draco scoffed beside her and ran a hand over her shoulders.
“Hey, you’re not alone this time,” Sarah said, poking Harry in the cheek. “Besides, I’d say that Draco and I are the odd ones out, considering how we’re usually outnumbered by
Sarah, Madam Pomfrey, Mila and Aleksander rushed forward and Cedric helped Cho out of the water. Both of them were violently shivering.
“Not until we’ve all had a little talk,” Black croaked. His grip lessened enough that it didn’t feel bruising anymore. “I thought you’d come and help your friend. James would have done the same for me. I’m grateful you didn’t have for a teacher…it will make everything much easier…”
Hermione were going to give her shit about. Swearing under her breath, she quickly put all the books on the trolley next to one of the bookshelves – the books would magically return themselves in due time. She rushed out of the library, ignoring Madam Pince’s disapproving glare, and hurried toward the Great Hall.
“Right you are, Headmistress!” wheezed Filch, who was a Squib and could no more have Stunned the fireworks than swallowed them. He dashed to a nearby cupboard, pulled out a broom, and began swatting at the fireworks in midair; within seconds the head of the broom was ablaze.
“I hope you’re right,” said Sarah. She pressed a hand over her eyes. “I’d feel so sorry for Xenophilius if – “
She rolled her eyes at him in reply but Harry didn’t miss the small smile playing at her lips. He smiled to himself as he dug into his food. It would be good to have some time for the two of them. With everything happening the past year, they had rarely found any time where they could just enjoy each other’s company without any distractions.
He did not need to finish the sentence. It sounded to Sarah too as though Mr Weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death. Still exceptionally pale, Ron stared at the back of his mother’s letter as though it might speak words of comfort to him. Fred pulled the parchment out of George’s hands and read it for himself, tilting it so that Sarah could see it.
“They sealed off all of those before the start of the year,” said Neville. “There’s no chance of getting through any of them now, not with curses over the entrances and Death Eaters and Dementors waiting at the exits.” He started walking backwards, beaming, drinking them in. “Never mind that stuff…is it true? Did you break into Gringotts? Did you escape on a dragon? It’s everywhere, everyone’s talking about it, Terry Boot got beaten up by Carrow for yelling about it in the Great Hall at dinner!”
“Undetectable Extension Charm,” said Hermione. “Tricky, but I think I’ve done it okay; anyway, I managed to fit everything we need in here and Sarah’s bag.”
Mr Weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to ask what these big plans were, but seemed to decide, upon reflection, that he didn’t want to know.
“Well, I woke up, I couldn’t get back to sleep, so obviously I decided to wake you up and do homework,” Sarah grinned. “If I’m awake, then you’re awake.”
Harry had taken a spot just outside the tent, a blanket laid on the ground beneath with one over his shoulders.
“ – Then you can start the next step: flirting.” Lyra’s smile was so wide that Draco was worried her face would split completely.
Surprisingly enough, the pair of them talked well into the early morning, only stopping when Madam Pomfrey woke up and spotted Fred sitting at her bedside. Sarah was still laughing on the way down to breakfast as she recalled the fiery way the nurse had shooed Fred out of the infirmary, wand raised high above her head.
“Okay, thanks everyone for coming,” she called as the remaining students settled on the ground. There were only seven people left. Draco, Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Katie landed behind Sarah and leant up against the locker rooms. “I’ll let you know by Monday who made it or not and practices will be scheduled afterwards.”
“Nasty little thing,” he replied, shrugging the coat on. “I could never understand why she adopted it in the first place.”
“I think wrinkled robes are the least of my problems right now,” muttered Harry, eyeing the other side of the courtroom where robed figures waited impatiently for the trail to start.
got her?” he was shouting. “Her crazy father was out there! He wouldn’t hesitate to hurt her – he’s done it before!”
Hermione ran to hold open the gate as Sarah and Harry led a stumbling Draco across the paddock. Sarah could hear Hagrid shouting at Crabbe behind them.
Harry took it silently and allowed Draco to lead him out of the tent. Hermione came and sat down in Draco’s vacated seat, her face in her hands.
She had just started explaining the translation when a strangled yell echoed down the boys’ staircase. The whole common room fell silent, staring, petrified, at the entrance. Then came hurried footsteps, growing louder and louder – and then Ron came leaping into view, dragging with him a bedsheet.
Harry told her all about how he had first bumped into Draco a few weeks ago and the subsequent meetings they had had since. He told her of the way the Draco interacted with Teddy and his patients and the hours he had spent lounging in Harry’s shop, alternating between buying and reading. After a pointed glance from Hermione, Harry finally admitted his revelation at that first dinner they had shared together.
Once the golden plates had been wiped clean, Dumbledore stood up again. A pleasant sort of tension seemed to fill the Hall now.
“As if I would get involved,” scoffed Lyra. “You two are big boys, you can figure it out yourselves.”
Harry held out his hand to help Sarah off the wide window ledge. Together, they headed downstairs to where Sirius, Remus and Draco were sitting in tense silence. Sarah perched on the arm of Sirius’ chair and took in the sombre faces.
“Holy shit!” shrieked Lee, pulled Sarah back to where Fred was standing, still clutching George’s body to his chest.
“Well, I’ll remember that the next time you want to act like a git and not talk to one of us for months on end, shall I?” Sarah said slightly spitefully, with a pointed look at Ron.
Harry nodded and burrowed his nose into Draco’s hair, inhaling the familiar smell of mint and cedarwood.
“Be with you in a moment!” he called. He was crouching over Bernie, giving him his last pain injection of the day. “Hope that helps, buddy,” he said, patting the sleeping dog.
A scream of pain sounded and Sarah’s eyes shot open. Draco was kneeling on the ground, holding his left arm close to his chest, blood blossoming all over his robes.
“And did you kill a basilisk with that sword in Dumbledore’s office?” demanded Terry Boot. “That’s what one of the portraits on the wall told me when I was in there last year…”
“Moony…babe…” Sirius started weakly, looking sheepishly at his boyfriend, who was standing at the bottom of the stairs, arms crossed over his chest and a suspiciously calm expression on his face.
Lyra just shook her head. “Don’t worry about it guys,” she said. “After this year, I’ll never have to see either of them again. Yes, it sucked that my boyfriend lied to me for months while sleeping with another girl but I’ve had time to get over it. And it’s not like I’ll be alone forever. I just want some time for myself and my life.”
“Don’t worry, ‘Mione,” Sarah said in a sure voice, “McGonagall’s already approved the party. Seamus practically wet himself when she said yes.”
“Hermione,” Draco said quietly, his grey eyes darting to Winky, “house elves will die if they’re not surrounded by magic.”
“If you’re not planning to engage in some amorous threesome,” Pansy started, ignored Harry and Draco’s scandalised gasps, “What
“It’s on his case,” she replied, pointing at the luggage rack over the man’s head, where a small, battered case held together with a large quantity of neatly knotted string. The name
“I know you adored the old man,” she said softly. “But it doesn’t mean that his treatment of you was okay.”
Sarah’s eyes cut to Fred and George at the Gryffindor table. Both of them wore matching glares as they stared up at Bagman. Sarah now had an idea of why they had been getting gradually more annoyed recently.
“Perhaps when you’re silent,” Draco muttered. Before Pansy could retort, he asked, “How’s your current paramour. What was his name…Bastian?”
Lyra turned to face him and the corners of her lips flicked upwards. Harry felt relief rush through him. He hadn’t realised how worried he had been that it was too late – that both of them were too far gone from the Dementors. To see Lyra nearly smile made Harry want to smile himself.
“Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law!” shouted Mrs Weasley. Sarah couldn’t help the quiet giggle that escaped her mouth. Draco pinched her shoulder in warning.
There were small noises of comprehension around the table. A broad, hunched woman with pointed teeth cackled.
And then the world resolved itself into pain and semi-darkness: she was half-buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack: cold air told her that the side of the castle had been blown away and hot stickiness on her cheek told her that she was bleeding copiously. Then she heard a terrible cry that pulled at her insides, that expressed agony of a kind neither flame nor curse could cause, and she stood up, swaying, more frightened than she had been that day, more frightened, perhaps, than she had been in her entire life…
“A display from the team mascots will precede the match,” Ron read aloud, looking at the program over Hermione’s shoulder.
“Not getting up to any inappropriate business, were we?” Sirius asked crudely, wriggling his eyebrows.
“Well, no time like the present, I guess,” Sarah said, standing again and hoisting the book comfortably into her arms. “Let’s get back to the common room.”
Potter stared at the ground in deep thought. Lyra was surprised smoke didn’t start pouring out of his ears, judging from the intense look of concentration on his face – it almost looked painful.
shrieked Sarah, aiming at the closest Death Eaters who just happened to be Lucius Malfoy and her father. She heard, rather than saw them collapse as Harry’s leapt the last few feet toward them.
They bid their goodbyes and walked as fast as they could out of the dungeons. Each step they took away from the party filled their bodies with warmth and it wasn’t until they were about to arrive in the entrance hall that Hermione and Sarah stopped shivering.
“Anyway,” she continued, “I like Sarah and Draco and zey like you. Also, you’re practically Bill’s family. Zerefore, you’re my family.”
“Poppy,” Dumbledore said to Madam Pomfrey, “I know you are waiting to attend to these children but would you be very kind and go down to Professor Moody’s office, where I think you will find a house-elf called Winky in considerable distress? Do what you can for her and take her back to the kitchens. I think Dobby will look after her for us. You can return here afterward.”
“What are you looking at?” She demanded with a firm look at the patrons. “I know I’m gorgeous but that’s no reason to stare.”
“Aren’t they simply stunning?” Rosie gushed. “Naomi is a collector. You’ll have to get us in contact with this Luna!”
“Yes, you should have!” Sarah said angrily, crossing her arms. “I know you’ve been busy with Quidditch practice and Lupin’s lessons but so have I, Harry, and I still found time.”
Screams of terror rent the air: the fighters scattered, Death Eaters and Hogwarts alike, and red and green jets flew into the midst of the oncoming monsters, which shuddered and reared, more terrifying than ever.
He was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway, carving out the ceiling as it struggled upwards, towards the fresher air, away from the shrieking and clanking goblins. Sarah, Hermione, Ron and Harry copied her, blasting the ceiling apart with more gouging spells. They passed the underground lake, and the great crawling, snarling beast seemed to sense freedom and space ahead of it, and behind them the passage was full of the dragon’s thrashing, spiked tail, of great lumps of rock, gigantic, fractured stalactites, and the clanking of the goblins seemed to be growing more muffled, while ahead, the dragon’s fire kept their progress clear –
It was one of the fastest Quidditch games Sarah had ever seen. The speed of the players was incredible – the Chasers were throwing the Quaffle to one another so fast that Bagman only had time to say their names.
Harry seemed to crumble even further now that he was in Draco’s arms and a soft intake of breath indicated that he was trying to fight back tears.
“Ask before one of the meetings,” Sarah suggested. “That way your mother can’t shout at you in front of everyone.”
Lyra sighed and summarised the events of the last two days and watched in amusement as Draco’s face morphed into disbelief.
“Stop playing with it or we’re going to have to go back and get it rewrapped,” Sarah warned, smirking slightly.
“And you two are clearly Weasleys,” Mrs Longbottom said, proffering her hand regally to Ron and Ginny in turn. “yes, I know your parents – not well, of course – but fine people, fine people…and you must be Hermione Granger?”
Harry called down Hedwig and Sarah tied the letter to her leg. With an affectionate nip to both their ears, the snowy owl took flight, her gorgeous plumage shining brightly in the morning night.
At that moment, Hermione coughed slightly and Draco’s head shot up as he realised the audience they had.
“Harry, I forgive you,” he said. “Yes, you hurt me but I know you would never do it intentionally. Sarah told me how you sat with me every day until I woke up.”
“And if, for whatever reason, it doesn’t work out or nothing comes from it, I’ll always be here to support you,” she promised. “Even if it doesn’t end up the way you think it may, it doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you. I also don’t expect you to immediately dive into a relationship with anyone. Merlin knows we’re still a bit too young for that, despite Blaise’s opinions on the matter.”
“Oh that’s already worth watching,” said Mr Weasley. “National teams bring creatures from their native land, you know, to put on a bit of a show.”
Silence fell and none of them spoke. Half of Sarah yearned to hear more, half of her was afraid of what might come next. It was the first time she had felt fully connected to the outside world for a long time.
“Yes, Dumbledore’s dead,” said Harry calmly, “but you didn’t have him killed. He chose his own manner of dying, chose it months before he died, arranged the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant.”
Many of the students looked petrified, However, as Sarah, Harry and Draco skirted the walls, scanning the Gryffindor table for Ron and Hermione, Ernie Macmillan stood up at the Hufflepuff table and shouted, “And what if we want to stay and fight?”
Sarah’s mind had gone blank with shock. They stood there as the very last rays of the setting sun cast a bloody light over the long-shadowed grounds.
They eventually trooped back into the kitchen. Hermione had summoned one of her books and sat reading it while Sarah braided her hair, balanced on the table; Harry was flipping through the
“But that’s servitude!” Hermione exclaimed. “How can someone willing bind themselves to someone else just to be a slave?”
Sarah woke up early on the first Hogsmeade trip of term. It was already mid-October and the term was continuing to fly by fast.
“The Ministry of Magic,” Dumbledore continued, “does not wish me to tell you this. It is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that I have done so – either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, or because they think I should not tell you so, young as you are. It is my belief, however, that the truth is generally preferable to lies, and that any attempt to pretend that Cedric died as the result of an accident, or some sort of blunder of his own, is an insult to his memory.”
“I literally can’t move,” she called back, her voice muffled by the soft, silky, pillows which were oh so comfortable –
?” Lyra asked, sitting up and leaning back against Draco’s chest. “Whyever would you want to do that?”
Draco went bright pink and scowled, throwing a bread roll at her. She laughed and caught it, taking a large bite and winking at him. As she chewed, she remembered her first question.
“Where are you going?” Draco asked, batting Harry’s hand away as it snuck towards the plate he was holding.
Mrs Weasley kissed all the children, including Sarah, Draco, Harry and Hermione. Harry looked secretly pleased that he was given an extra hug from the Weasley matron.
“I expect you to eat all of that,” said Madam Pomfrey, ignoring Sarah’s grimace. “No exceptions or you won’t leave this bed.”
Sarah looked up from Fred’s embrace to glare at his twin. George was smiling innocently at her from his spot in the doorway, looking very pleased with himself for interrupting Sarah and Fred’s heartfelt reunion.
“They’re evacuating the younger kids and everyone’s meeting in the Great Hall to get organised,” Harry said. “We’re fighting.”
Ginny, Neville and Luna were holding their own while they stood in front of Remus’s hunched figure. He was kneeling beside Bill’s unconscious body, wand moving quickly. Sarah ran toward them as quickly as she could, jumping over bodies and debris.
In an instant, Ron and Hermione had both placed hands on the top of Harry’s head and forced him off his chair and out of sight. Sarah slid down beside him and stared at him in horror. The adult’s feet moved toward the bar, paused, and then turned and walked right toward them.
“Father made me take it, remember?” she sighed. The air around them chilled slightly. “But at least I got to get out of Astronomy. Seems slightly pointless when you’re literally named after a constellation.”
“At least let me get our pants off,” huffed Draco. “I don’t want to come in my pants like a fourteen-year-old.”
They all took several steps backwards, stunned by what they had done. Sarah could feel Draco on her other side begin to panic, struggling against the ropes binding him.
“Please?” Lyra said. She stepped forward and grabbed hold of Draco’s hands. “I won’t go without you. But I want to –
“It’s illegal!” shouted Hermione. “The Minister wouldn’t want you to break the law, Professor Umbridge!”
“Agreed,” said Fred. “So, people, let’s try and calm down a bit. Things are bad enough without inventing stuff as well. For instance, this new idea that You-Know-Who can kill with a single glance from his eyes. That’s a
“I’m sure we’ll get used to it,” she said, her voice thankfully even. “I mean, what was the point of all those Healer sessions if we can’t even step foot into the castle?”
“Well, great minds think alike,” replied Sarah. “If you don’t want to talk about it, you don’t have to.”
Professor McGonagall ushered them away from the chattering crowd, up the marble staircase, and along a corridor.
“These types of cases aren’t uncommon,” he said gently. “I’ve performed this procedure numerous times with positive results. The good news is that this obstruction hasn’t progressed enough to result in the removal of the entire kidney. Fluffy is very lucky.”
Lyra nodded and fully withdrew herself. In a manner of seconds, the usual Malfoy mask was back in place and she looked as if she’d never been crying in the first place.
“You guys have really improved,” he said, smiling brightly. He gestured at everyone with his free hand, the other wrapped securely around Draco’s. “You’re even starting to work together – to know one another’s moves. I think we can plan to start on something more difficult now: patronuses.”
Sarah had eagerly raced after them, closely followed by Harry. They found the pair in a lone corridor deep in the dungeons, Draco’s enraged voice echoing off the stone walls.
“I didn’t want to be found,” Harry said mulishly. He sat down against the wall and crossed his arms, not looking in Sarah’s direction.
“Sounds like a plan,” Harry said. Without thinking, he reached over and brushed back a strand of Draco’s silky hair that had fallen across his face. “Night Draco.”
Granger smiled at Harry briefly before addressing Draco. “Would you like to come with me and have a drink? I’m sure you’ll need one before Teddy takes you on his adventure.”
“How long’s this been here?” Ron asked, as they set off. “It isn’t on the Marauder’s Map, is it, Harry? I thought there were only seven passageways in and out of school?”
Form their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds, they had a clear view of the smooth black surface of the water – except that the surface was suddenly not smooth at all. Some disturbance was taking place deep in the centre; great bubbles were forming on the surface, waves were no washing over the muddy banks – and then, out in the very middle of the lake, a whirlpool appeared, as if a giant plug had been pulled out of the lake’s floor…
“I’d love to see Mum’s face if you suggest that,” Fred said brightly. “She’d probably try to convince you to do a Portkey trip back to here in time for lunch.”
She followed the Professor in silence. The towering walls of the castle cast sinister shadows across the darkening grounds, leaving Sarah feeling jittery and nervous.
Sarah met Fred’s eyes from across the Hall. They were glinting wildly and Sarah already knew that he and George had something planned.
“Well, Kingsley save us,” said Remus. “Thanks to his warning most of the wedding guests were able to Disapparate before they arrived – including your Bulgarian friends, Sarah.”
“Ah, Harry would have been fine,” Lyra smirked, somehow still looking elegant and put-together while covered in plaster dust and paper. “We all know how hard-headed he is.”
Sarah, Draco, Pansy, Blaise and Theo filled into seats at the end of a row beside the lake. People were whispering to each other; it sounded like a breeze in the grass, but the birdsong was louder by far. The crowd continued to swell; with a great rush of affection for both of them, Sarah saw Neville being helped into a seat by Luna. Neville and Luna alone of the D.A had responded to Hermione’s summons the night that Dumbledore had died, and Sarah knew why: they were the ones who had missed the D.A most…probably the ones who had checked the coins regularly in the hope that there would be another meeting.
“We know, Harry,” Sarah said, leaning against the other boy’s side. “But at the end of the day, it was just a broom. Admittedly, one you loved, but still – just a broom.”
“I was thinking,” said Hermione, frowning at Fred, “more of a name that didn’t tell everyone what we were up to, so we can refer to it safely outside meetings.”
She held the magazine up so they could see. Harry’s face was on the front cover, emblazoned with the words
They turned, halfway along the third-floor corridor, to see Fred and George peering out at them from behind a statue of a humpbacked, one-eyed witch.
She groggily got into her robes and tried to force her eyes to stay open. She had no idea how she would make it through the feast.
“I won’t,” said Ron, “let you see,” he added under his breath, as he turned back to the sprout mountain.
Christmas break was finally upon them. Despite Pansy’s continuous, mind-numbing worries, they had all done well on their term exams and could now happily enjoy three weeks of blissful break. Sarah had never been happier to see the ghastly serpent knocker of Grimmauld Place. Despite Sirius’s best efforts, the stubborn thing refused to be removed. It was with no small amount of glee that Sarah banged it as hard as she could against the wooden door, Draco and Harry shaking their heads at her from behind her.
“Damn, Sarah, who knew you were the reason poor Theo only knew the comfort of his hand all these years,” Pansy whistled.
“That’s so strange,” said Sarah, staring out the window at the moving horizon. “I wonder why he would be trying to keep you from Hogwarts.”
Harry and Ron went up to collect their borrowed equipment as Sarah dragged Draco’s attention away from the intoxicating potion.
Lyra snorted and adjusted the sleeping child on her lap to accept a drink from her brother. Draco and Harry’s youngest was only four but already looked like a spitting image of them both, with Harry’s messy hair and Draco’s silver eyes. Scorpius and James, however, were the perfect opposite, both sporting gleaming white-blond hair, and bright green eyes.
“Of course not,” Sarah said absently as she tided up the room slightly. “Tom is an old friend of my mother’s and helped me out when I needed it.”
Fred shifted all the way back to allow Sarah to sit up properly. He grabbed her hand and kissed her knuckles.
“I will not calm down!” she screamed. Never before had Sarah seen her lose control like this; she looked quite demented. “Give me back my wand!
Bill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell neatly upon it, a small, reddish mound.
Sarah beamed at the oblivious boys as Draco told Harry that veelas enticed men and women through attraction and sometimes caused them to act without thought. Harry furiously blushed a bright red at the implication of his lack of action as Draco smiled at him.
Then the veela started to dance. Sarah watched in amusement as the men in the box became entranced by the veela, pressing closer toward the front of the box to get a better view. Fred made a choked noise and gripped George’s shirt with one hand and Sarah with the other, blinking furiously.
Sarah rolled her eyes fondly at the children and hugged them all, smiling brightly when they all pressed kisses to her cheeks. The other parents also said goodbye and soon they were waving at the pile of kids huddled in the doorway.
“You shouldn’t have done that to Percy,” Sarah said quietly to Fred as Mr Weasley attempted to console his wife.
Viktor shook his head at her. “Do not vorry about that,” he said. “I haff been very vell. The team haff kept me very busy. How haff you been?”
“You know it’s okay if you’re not?” Hermione pointed out. “I was a mess when I couldn’t find my parents.”
They waited until Harry continued, sitting up to look at them both in the eye. “I’ve been having weird dreams the last few weeks,” he admitted. “I didn’t want to mention them because I didn’t think they were important, but…They’re weird. I don’t really know how to describe them.”
Sarah thought for a moment that McLaggen might punch Harry, but he contented himself with an ugly grimace and stormed away, growling what sounded like threats to thin air.
“One moment,” she said, before marching off in search of her brother. Thankfully, he was easy to spot, as Harry was standing beside him and it was always a simple task to pick Harry’s mess of hair out in a crowd.
“Why shouldn’t I?” said Hermione. “Mudblood, and proud of it! I’ve got no higher position under this new order than you have, Griphook! It was me they chose to torture, back at the Malfoys!”
Gradually, Harry managed to coax Draco from out of the warm bed, somehow promising to not only give his boyfriend a massage but also to spend the afternoon doing nothing but stroking Draco’s hair.
“I’m going to allow myself to be treated like a failing servant, Hermione,” Sarah said in a strong voice. “Draco is affected even more by that horrid thing than Ron and he isn’t complaining about it. For Merlin’s sake, he also has to deal with it whenever his boyfriend is wearing it.”
Sarah slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted, feet first, towards the surface of the lake, eyes clenched tightly shut. The drop was greater than she had thought and she hit the water hard, plunging like a stone into a freezing, green, reed-filled world. She kicked towards the surface and emerged, panting, to see enormous ripples emanating in circles from the places where Draco, Harry, Ron and Hermione had fallen. The dragon did not seem to have noticed anything: it was already fifty feet away, swooping low over the lake to scoop up water in its scarred snout. As the others emerged, spluttering and gasping from the depths of the lake, the dragon flew on, its wings beating hard, and landed at last on a distant bank.
Sarah nodded but gripped Hermione’s hand tightly. “If you want to talk, at all, remember I’ll be here.”
, boys,” yelled Mr Weasley over the tumult of the crowd below, “is why you should never go for looks alone!”
Sarah bolted after them and leapt at where the two boys had come to a stop next to Ron, causing all four of them to tumble to the ground.
Draco led them up a few levels until they reached his rooms. Sarah’s was opposite his and Harry’s designated room was beside hers. There was a bathroom, library and study on this level, similar to the other levels of the old house.
A baby’s head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick, muscled neck of the Death Eater as he struggled to get up again. But even as they watched, their mouths open, the head began to swell to its previous proportions again, thick black hair was sprouting from the pate and chin…
“I hope they don’t kill him after all the effort I went to ensure the Death Eaters got a glimpse of Harry before we left,” Sarah said, lowering herself to the ground.
“Lyra!” Potter shouted. Heads turned toward the boy at his shout. Lyra noticed that a few groups of people were eying the two of them speculatively, bending closer to whisper into curious ears.
. The Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any Dark wizard. If you are still worried, by all means come and see me outside class hours. And now, you will kindly continue your reading. Page five, ‘Basics for Beginners.’”
Sarah cautiously pushed aside the tent flaps and walked out to where Hermione was sitting wrapped in a blanket.
Sarah rose to her feet – Draco grabbing her as she swayed slightly – and said to Harry, who had paused, “Well, go on then. We don’t have all day.”
“I’m more curious as to why father was trying to contact me,” Sarah stated. “Two years no contact and suddenly he wants to be back in my life – not like he was ever really a part of it in the first place,” she added sourly, stabbing at a potato viciously.
During Tuesday morning’s Herbology lesson, Harry recounted what he had learnt at Dumbledore’s private lesson the night before. It had been a memory of Tom Riddle as a child, already quite powerful and independent.
A chorus of “Ohs!” and “Come on!” surrounded her but she stubbornly refused, crossing her arms and glaring until they gave up.
Abruptly, as though the tree had been turned to marble, it stopped moving. Not a leaf twitched or shook.
Draco’s eyebrow was twitching in annoyance, something Harry soon noticed. He touched his best friend’s arm and said, “Maybe you see if Seamus and Dean want to go flying?”
She squealed, jumping up and wrapping her arms around his neck. “I’m going to start crying because of how happy I am.”
Draco forced his shoulders to relax slightly. “No thank you, Cassie,” he said gratefully. “How are you holding up? It’s your first truly busy day – as bad as you thought it would be?”
“Stop!” Potter snapped at his friends, who immediately shut up in surprise. “She’s come to me for help, so I’ll help them.”
The Bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted Harry’s scar and started gabbling loudly and excitedly, pointing at it. Sarah began to snicker as Draco calmly began a conversation with the Bulgarian minister in Bulgarian, causing Fudge’s, Harry’s and the Weasleys’ eyes to pop out of their head. Sarah interjected a comment every so often but left Draco to his own devices.
don’t think important enough to mention. It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell.”
He grunted unexpectedly and released Lyra, falling backwards, Stunned. Lyra ran to Draco and they looked around in surprise, trying to find who had shot the Stunning Spell.
“I have no idea!” Rosie was trying to keep one of the younger cats breathing, the small chest moving up and down shallowly. “I came in this evening to check on them and found them like this! Nothing I’ve done is working. I have no idea what’s wrong with them!”
After a few more minutes of searching, Draco found a gravestone with the same eye symbol in Hermione’s book.
Harry sat between Sarah and Draco at the Slytherin table and they were quickly joined by Viktor, Mila and Aleksander.
“Did you hear?” said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to their table, “apparently Sirius Black’s been sighted. It was in the
Lyra nodded but voiced the one final secret she hadn’t managed to tell anyone except Draco. “Hermione, I just – I
Ron flushed red. “No! It’s just that living with the bloke for sixth years means I hear some weird things.”
Sirius had taken Sarah aside one afternoon to ask about her progress in her Animagus transformation. She gleefully told him that she had gathered all the ingredients and the potion was now stewing as it had to for a month. It would be ready for her to drink when she returned to Hogwarts for the new year.
“Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them – nowhere fucking near, in other words!”
Speaking of blonds, a flash of white caught Sarah’s attention as Draco walked toward her, Harry following at a more sedate pace. Sarah frowned as she observed the two boys. They had been gone most of the day, with Draco only offering Sarah a quick kiss on the cheek and a promise to be back before the end of the feast before he pushed Harry out of their shared common room.
They burst through the Hospital Wing’s doors, Madam Pomfrey already waiting near a bed and holding her wand aloft. She immediately began treating Draco while Professor Snape whirled toward Potter, eyes flashing dangerously.
“You have disappointed me, daughter. Time and time again, you were expected to uphold our family’s values and yet you threw them to ground like dirt. You befriended blood-traitors, mudbloods! Stained our reputation – and for what? Your own selfish excuses?” He continued to stalk towards her and terror flooded Sarah’s body. Some part of her instinctually knew that she wasn’t to make it out of this situation – she would need a miracle to save her from her father’s wrath.
“You can’t just drop those bombs on us and expect us to be fine!” she exclaimed. “At least give us a few minutes to process.”
“Ah, there you both are,” Bellatrix Lestrange said, stepping forward to caress Lyra’s cheek. “We were wondering where you had disappeared too.”
And then she saw the door of number twelve Grimmauld Place, with its serpent door knocker, but before she could draw breath, there was a scream and a flash of purple light; Hermione’s hand was suddenly vicelike upon hers and everything went dark again.
The days began to pass quickly after that. Ron had gotten over his little spat and apologised to Draco for being unnecessarily rude to him. Kreacher was found lurking in the attic. Sarah didn’t miss it when Draco pulled the house-elf away angrily. His face had remained pinched for the rest of the day and he spoke to Remus and Sirius in hushed tones at the first opportunity. The festive decorations vanished and instead, school things and uniforms began to make an appearance as they packed for the new term. Mrs Weasley was cleaning and pressing uniforms, clothes, and robes in between checking around the house for any items left lying around.
But at that moment, there was a deafening rumble of thunder and the doors of the Great Hall banged open again.
“Look, it doesn’t matter that Draco didn’t tell you,” Sarah said, rubbing her face roughly. “Today has been quite shit and I want a nap. You already knew what our families were like and seemed to deal with it before. So all I’m asking is for you to deal with it now.”
“Do you think we should wake Sarah up?” Harry asked Draco, absently tracing his thumb along the other boy’s hand.
“Just the truth!” She exclaimed. “That he was a self-conceited arsehole who couldn’t even tell one end of his wand from the other.”
“She is my daughter,” Antonius snapped cruelly. “She will listen to me when I tell her to do something.”
“I just want Draco to wake up,” Lyra whispered. She rested her hand on Draco’s arm, a slight sheen of sweat coating it. He sucked in a breath and turned his body towards hers slightly in response.
He stalked around the class, turning his nose up at the potions, only offering a small nod when he saw Draco’s and Sarah’s. The worst of it occurred when they had ten minutes left of the lesson.
There was a soft, crackling noise, and a shivering light filled the compartment. Professor Lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames. They illuminated his tired, grey face, but his eyes looked alert and wary.
The feast continued throughout the rest of the night. A big surprise was Hagrid walking through the doors at three-thirty, recently released from Azkaban, the wizarding prison. Harry had explained that Draco’s father had gotten Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic, involved to arrest Hagrid and remove Dumbledore as Headmaster. Thankfully, both were back in their rightful positions.
Harry didn’t answer. He shot Sarah a worried look and she frowned at him, wondering what could have spooked him enough to leave a frightened look in his green eyes.
“Yes!” Harry said loudly. Draco looked startled by his enthusiasm so Harry quickly added, “I don’t mind at all. Unless you have a problem with it?”
She was curled up in Draco’s warm arms on his bed. When she had walked into the common room after her meeting with Lupin, she had immediately headed toward the boy's dorm, not even stopping to check that Draco was following her.
Fred reached out for the parchment and cheerfully put down his signature with a wink at Sarah. As everyone got up to sign the parchment, Sarah walked up behind Hermione.
“I may have asked the house-elves to include some…” Sarah admitted. “Hermione, darling, I’ll see you inside. Come on boys.”
“It’s not like I’m not having the time of my life here,” said Ron, “you know, with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night. I just hoped, you know, after we’d been running round a few weeks, we’d have achieved something,”
“I didn’t mean – I mean – “ stuttered Potter, blushing furiously. He gulped and started again. “Where did you study?”
work,” Teddy inputted happily. “He said that if Draco had the choice, he would just live in the clinic with the animals.”
There was a flash of flame in the very middle of the office, leaving behind a single golden feather that floated gently to the floor.
“Let’s go meet your stupid boyfriend before I give in to my urge to go get a butterbeer,” she said to him, drinking in the warmth from his side.
“What?” Draco said defensively. “The sooner we get it done, the sooner we can do whatever garish Gryffindor idea you’ve concocted.” He sent a pointed glance at Harry, who shrugged, not denying it.
“Thanks, Hermione,” Lyra said, a genuine smile breaking across her face. She took one last deep breath and cleared her throat. “Right. I’ve had my breakdown. I’ll be okay, now.”
Sarah frowned. “That’s appalling,” she said. “You’re always welcome to study with us, Luna. As long as you can deal with Hermione and Draco’s pedanticness.”
The swirling sleet began to fall heavier, causing Sarah and Harry to clutch their scarves closer to their faces. Ahead of them, Sarah could see the blurry figures of Katie Bell and one of her friends.
Fleur’s bright blue eyes narrowed slightly and she said, “I will not lie to you, Sarah. Zey were not pretty. Bill and I did as much as we could but…”
“Well I did,” he said, ignoring the dirty looks he was getting from the other houses. “Judging from Pansy’s outburst, she doesn’t believe my offer was sincere. I’m here to rectify that.”
Lyra looked extremely confused. “Of course not,” she said, frowning slightly. Her eyes suddenly lit with recognition. “Muggles have a problem with it, don’t they?” she asked.
She shrugged unapologetically. “The owner’s about to kick you out anyway.” She nodded toward the back of the shop where the owner was standing arguing with the person behind the till while gesturing angrily in Blaise’s direction. “Besides, we have places to be,” continued Sarah. “Nice seeing you, Jessica.”
“Very good, very good!” said Slughorn happily. “Now,” he continued, pointing to the cauldron nearest the Harry, Ron and Hermione, “this one here is pretty well known…Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too…Who can - ?”
“Headmaster?” It was Snape. The trio kept quite still, ensuring that their breathing was long and deep. “The whole of the third floor has been searched. He’s not there. And Filch has done the dungeons; nothing there either.”
“I know it’s cheesy,” Fred blushed, “because of the whole ‘my queen’ thing. But I thought you should have this to always remind you that you have someone waiting here to protect you and love you and treat you the way you deserve to be treated – “
“I don’t suppose I’ve got any choice, have I?” said Rita, her voice shaking slightly. She opened her crocodile bag once more, withdrew a piece of parchment, and raised her Quick-Quotes Quill.
“On a happier note,” he continued, “I am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year. First, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.”
There was a sound of scurrying feet behind them, and Ludo Bagman entered the room. He hurried toward Harry but stopped short at Sarah’s fierce glare.
“We were there,” said Harry. “We spent two nights there, and the second night I kept thinking I could hear someone moving around in the dark and calling out!”
Nothing could have prepared Sarah for what happened next. The smoky shadow of a woman with long dark hair fell to the ground, straightened up and looked, not toward Harry, but directly through the web of light toward Sarah.
Thursday’s Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson came too quickly for Sarah’s liking. Draco had been let out of the hospital wing the morning after the incident and had actively avoided Moody whenever he saw the Professor in the corridors. Harry and Sarah were still filled with righteous anger at the entire thing and weren’t looking forward to the lesson as much as the other Gryffindors and Slytherins.
“So kind of you to make an appearance, Miss Deaumont,” Snape drawled as she entered his office, panting for breath.
“Next time, give me some warning so I don’t have to sprint across half the school, sir,” she said, collecting herself and dropping into the seat in front of the desk. “So, why the sudden change?”
“Shut up, you sap,” Draco laughed, rising from the bed. He threw a clean shirt at Harry and pulled on his own, quickly finding his pants and slacks. Harry followed him, pulling on the first pair of jeans he could find and running a hand through his hair.
“Honestly, we wouldn’t have been able to finish them so soon if Sarah hadn’t helped us with the ignition charms,” Fred said, gazing down lovingly at his girlfriend.
Sarah dabbed her mouth with a napkin before replying, “I did. I was also lucky enough to have Ernest Worthington as my mentor. It’s thanks to him I achieved as well as I did.”
is keeping something from me – I know it. I just want people to be honest with me, is that too much to ask?” He turned pain-filled eyes on Sarah and she leapt to her feet.
“Right, Kreacher, I want the truth: How do you know Mundungus Fletcher stole the locket?” Draco demanded.
“Oh, come off it,” said Ron, striding over to her and whipping her results out of her hand. “Yep – ten ‘Outstandings’ and one ‘Exceeds Expectations’ at Defense Against the Dark Arts.” He looked down at her, half-amused, half-exasperated. “You’re actually disappointed, aren’t you?”
The only useful bit of information Ron brought back with him was that Voldemort had put a Taboo on his name: anyone who said it was immediately swarmed by Death Eaters, protective enchantments or not.
Sarah had gone up to try to see if Hermione would talk to Ron but found the other girl fast asleep, covered in books and parchment. Sarah tidied up for her and then went back downstairs, where Ron was waiting with a weary look on his face.
“Hey. Where’s Hermione?” he said, looking around in confusion at the massive pile of books beside Ron.
The drawing room door burst open and Potter and Weasley emerged through it, Weasley shooting spells at random. Potter raced towards Draco and easily grabbed the wands from Draco’s hands, spinning around and shooting Stunners across the room. Lucius was caught by a strong Stunner and was flung into the opposite wall. He sunk to the ground, a trickle of blood falling down his temple. Screams echoed around the room as Weasley kept shooting off spells.
“Harry, we already told you we want nothing to do with it. We shouldn’t even know where you’re doing it!” Draco cried.
I never noticed how many mistakes are in this series but this chapter really annoyed me so here are some edits. smh how did I manage to confuse Umbitch and McGonagall 🙃
The bathroom was softly lit by a splendid candle-filled chandelier, and everything was made of white marble, including what looked like an empty, rectangular swimming pool sunk into the middle of the floor. About a hundred golden taps stood all around the pool’s edges, each with a differently coloured jewel set into its handle. There was also a diving board. Long white linen curtains hung at the windows; a large pile of fluffy white towels sat in a corner, and there was s single golden framed painting on the wall. It featured a blond mermaid who was fast asleep on a rock, her long hair over her face. It fluttered every time she snored.
“It appears even someone as perfect as myself makes mistakes,” Lyra sighed, shaking her head. “What can we do for you, Harry?”
“Little Miss Perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived,” said Rita, taking a large slurp of her drink. “I suppose I’m allowed to
Dumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on top of it, where it would be clearly visible to everyone in the Hall.
Ron, Hermione, Sarah, Draco, George and Mundungus drank. All of them gasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats. At once, their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax. Hermione, Sarah and Mundungus were shooting upward; Ron, George and Draco were shrinking; their hair was darkening, Hermione’s and Sarah’s appearing to shoot backwards into their skulls.
“Well, sit down,” Umbridge said, pointing toward a pair of small tables draped in lace. A piece of blank parchment lay on the table, apparently waiting for them.
Their moment was interrupted by footsteps. Sarah and Harry released each other and turned to see that Draco had come back early from Hogsmeade, arms laden with bags.
Draco knew there was no room for argument in the Weasley matron’s tone or expression, so he simply nodded, catching Granger’s eye, who looked as if she were struggling not to laugh.
“Man, I forgot you went to live with Professor Lupin,” Seamus said to Sarah after he had greeted the old professor. “Did he make you do your homework over the holidays.”
“You’d have thought Black, Potter and Jacobi were siblings!” chimed in Professor Flitwick. “Inseparable!”
Harry huffed out a laugh and kissed Draco again. Much more lightheaded and significantly more aroused by the time they pulled back, Harry released Draco. The blond pouted slightly didn’t complain, a smile fighting for dominance on his face.
“Well, take these anyway,” said Romilda, thrusting a box into his hands. “Chocolate Cauldrons, they’ve got Firewhiskey in them. My gran sent them to me, but I don’t like them.”
Draco waited patiently as Harry contemplated his answer. Finally, the other boy sighed and sat up a bit.
“Wouldn’t that impact him as well?” Harry asked curiously as they began to make their way downstairs.
“Roger that,” she said, accepting the Quaffle he passed her. She flew up to the goalposts and said with a shit-eating grin, “Who’s first, boys?”
Ron’s retort died on his tongue as Professor McGonagall approached the group, her lips pinched together tightly.
But Ron did not seem to have heard; Lavender had just arrived with Parvati. Squeezing herself in between Harry and Ron and causing Draco to be pushed up against the person next to him, Lavender flung her arms around Ron’s neck.
“Not that it’s any of your business,” she drawled. “But this is what you look like after a good snog with your boyfriend.”
Draco said steadily and the severed ropes fell away. Ron helped Sarah to her feet as she pointed her wand at herself, stemming the blood flow.
“Weasley,” Blaise replied after a beat of silence. “Apparently he’s gone and offended the dear lady.”
“Spectacular,” Lyra said drily. “I’ll endeavour to remind Draco not to kill you when I tell him the news.”
Once dinner ended, Sarah dragged Draco away from the Slytherin table and didn’t stop until they had reached her dormitory.
Sarah shivered in fear as she stood up and began to back away from Ginny’s body, which had begun to move seemingly of its own accord.
Lyra hummed. “Hermione, they’ve already given up. Ron is practically drooling over there and Harry would rather whisk his boyfriend away than continue to study.”
The team was right in the middle of it, receiving pats on the backs and drinks passed to them. Even though Harry didn’t play, he was still getting congratulated at every turn. Thankfully, Katie had returned from St Mungo’s in top condition in time for the game and with Ron back in the team, Harry had gratefully gotten rid of McLaggen, much to the relief of everyone.
“It’s okay, Draco,” Sarah patted him on the head. “You, Ron and Harry can geek out to your hearts' desire while the adults talk.”
This time it really was Hermione running toward them from the stands. Sarah saw Lavender walking off the pitch, arm in arm with Parvati, a rather grumpy expression her face. Ron looked extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he grinned at the team and at Hermione.
“Exploding Snap anyone?” George said, pulling out a pack of cards. Harry, Draco, Ron and Hermione accepted. Sarah and Fred declined and settled against the corner of the compartment, Sarah resting against Fred’s chest.
“As – yes,” said Mr Weasley, grinning, “this is my son Percy. He’s just started at the Ministry – and this is Fred – no, George, sorry –
Sarah followed his finger and saw a sign which said: DO NOT ENTER WITHOUT EXPRESS PERMISSION OF REGULUS ARCTURUS BLACK.
Draco lasted about another minute before he hurried down toward her, scooping up a large handful of snow on the way and shaping it into a snowball. When Lyra’s back was turned, Draco aimed and fired, hitting her squarely in the back. She stumbled and whirled around, silver eyes sparkling in the sunlight reflected off the snow. They soon fell into a vicious snowball fight, using hands and wands to ensure that the other was always drenched in freezing snow.
“Ginny, we’ll be back in a moment, just keep out of the way, keep safe!” Ron said as they began to run back to the stretch of wall beyond which the Room of Requirement was waiting to do the bidding of the next entrant.
“I was thinking of going out today to look for a grocers,” Sarah voiced once three steaming bowls of porridge had been placed on the table.
Sarah was silent for a moment and then she whispered, “Do you ever think of flying away? Just – escaping…”
“If you Splinch me, Sirius, I’ll curse you to stay in your dog form all week,” Sarah hissed as she grabbed Sirius’ arm tightly. “
“Pansy, shut the fuck up!” hissed Draco, as a few heads turned towards them in interest. Harry frowned at their group.
The problem, however, had only increased when Pansy and Blaise had decided to drop by one day. Harry couldn’t help but notice how Blaise’s dark skin shone in the sun and how pretty his perfect smile was. That had inadvertently led Harry’s thoughts back to another set of silver eyes that lit up brightly whenever Draco smiled.
Gulping, Madam Pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth, her eyes wide. Somewhere out in the darkness, a phoenix was singing in a way Sarah had never heard before: a stricken lament of terrible beauty. And Sarah felt that the music was inside her, not without: it was her own grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows.
“I’ll follow in a minute,” Sarah said, frowning at the other two. Draco nodded and left. “What did we miss?” she asked Ron and Hermione.
When they all entered the Hall later for dinner, they noticed at once that the usual decorations were missing. The Great Hall was normally decorated with the winning House’s colours for the Leaving feast. Tonight, however, there were black drapes on the wall behind the teachers’ table. Sarah knew instantly that they were there as a mark of respect to Cedric.
“Quite right, take ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, it’s a funny little potion, Felix Felicis,” said Slughorn. “Desperately tricky to make, and disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed correctly, as this has been, you will find that all your endeavours tend to succeed…at least until the effects wear off.”
“Stay strong, my darling. I am so proud of you.” The words echoed in Sarah’s head as she watched her mother turn towards Harry. Harry’s eyes snapped to Sarah’s and she couldn’t hold back the tears, freely letting them slip down her face as her mother circled the group with the other ghostly figures. Sarah had already guessed that her mother had been murdered but seeing it confirmed was another thing – and by Voldemort’s wand no less.
“Let’s go,” Flint said gruffly, standing up and leading the team out of the Great Hall and toward the Quidditch Pitch.
Sarah burst into laughter and the girl in question stepped up to her girlfriend’s side. “Not bad, Sarah,” she complimented. “Even your boyfriend looks handsome – that’s an achievement for a ginger.”
“Oh, look, Draco’s coming back,” Millicent observed. “Any luck with your boy?” she asked him when he fell into a seat beside Theo.
She nodded again. She shuffled past them, pushing Hermione and Draco aside as though she had not seen them, and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting room.
“We won’t be going home at the end of the year,” Lyra continued. “Dumbledore is going to try to help move our mother to somewhere safe. Harry also said he was willing to help protect you guys and Theo and Millie if you needed it.”
“Thank you,” Lyra sniffed, struggling to keep a smile off her face. “I personally think you could pull off being a girl if we just added a
“As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you,” said Dumbledore, “we heard Barty Crouch confess. Under the influence of Veritaserum, he told us how he was smuggled out of Azkaban, and how Voldemort – learning of his continued existence from Bertha Jorkins – went to free him from his father and used him to capture Harry. The plan worked, I tell you. Crouch has helped Voldemort to return.”
“The Manor always hosted an extravagant Christmas party on the twenty-fifth,” Draco explained, sorting through the gifts under the tree to find one for each person. “So we always did our celebrations the night before.”
Harry frowned but didn’t say anything. Sarah thought that Griphook was looking entirely unaffected by the circumstances.
The days quickly passed until finally, they were getting ready to leave for Diagon Alley. Mrs Weasley had woken them up with plates full of bacon sandwiches and Sarah had barely managed to grab one before the boys and Ginny were descending upon them.
“Harry,” Hermione whispered so quietly they could hardly hear her. “I’m so, so sorry. I think it was me. As we were leaving, you know, the snake was coming for us, and so I cast a Blasting Curse, and it rebounded everywhere, and it must have – must have hit – “
The crowd exploded again as the Gryffindor team came onto the pitch. Harry smirked at Sarah and she winked at him playfully.
“So sorry,” Draco said drily, “next time I’m cursed within an inch of my life, I’ll be sure to wake up earlier to eat. We wouldn’t want you getting ill.”
Sarah got shakily to her feet. Harry stepped beside her and the two of them stood facing the oncoming Death Eaters. Miraculously, the prophecy was still undamaged in Harry’s left hand.
Luna was not there; the thing that was making such a racket was a wooden object covered in magically turning cogs and wheels. It looked like the bizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of old shelves, but after a moment Sarah deduced it was an old printing press, due to the fact that it was churning out
Lyra’s face darkened and she stopped walking, pulling Draco to a halt with her. Her grey eyes, identical to his, were steely as she stared at him.
“I agree with you, Sarah,” Remus said carefully. “But I trust Dumbledore. He’ll tell us when it’s important.”
“Good,” said Professor Umbridge. “I should like you to turn to page five and read chapter one, ‘Basics for Beginners.’ There will be no need to talk.”
“Ah, sir,” said Winky, shaking her head, “ah, sir, meaning no disrespect, sir, but freedom is going to Dobby’s head, sir. Ideas above his station, sir.”
,” said Madame Maxime, whose enormous hand with its many superb opals was resting on Fleur’s shoulder. “’Owgarts cannot ‘ave two champions. It is most unjust!”
“My, my, Draco, your language is atrocious this fine morning. You’ve been spending too much time with Pansy.”
“Shit,” gasped Draco, trying and failing not to arch up at the sensation Harry knew was fighting with me.
Sarah just had time to see that the door of the carriage bore a coat of arms (two crossed, golden wands, each emitting three stars) before it opened.
She flew around another corner and a curse soared past her; she dived behind a suit of armour that exploded. She saw two similar-looking Death Eaters from before running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them, but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing, who ran screeching into neighbouring paintings. As she leapt from behind the wreckage of armour, Sarah heard more shouts and screams; other people within the castle seemed to have awoken…
Silence fell over the ward once she had left, only interrupted by the soft sounds of Madam Pomfrey flitting around Draco.
“Well,” Remus said once they had finished their lunch. Fred and Sirius had managed to eat half the sandwiches between the two and still looked ready for more. “I think we better get back and cleaned up before Draco arrives. We don’t want any delays.”
Harry’s mouth fell open when he caught sight of Fred and George. His mind seemed to realise that they were all sitting in a car parked in
They combed through the room examining Quidditch memorabilia, souvenirs, various personal belongings, but no locket.
“What if I did? Going to cart me off to Azkaban? Kill me for sticking my nose out my own front door? Do it, then, if you want to! But I hope for your sakes you haven’t pressed your little Dark Marks and summoned him. He’s not going to like being called here for me and my old cat, is he, now?”
Sarah flew forward to take the penalty and feinted to the right before throwing to the far left. Wood had veered right before correcting but still just missed the Quaffle as it soared through the hoop. Cheers erupted from the Slytherin stands and play continued.
“May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said Dumbledore brightly into the silence. “Professor Moody.”
about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. He disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. After a while, there was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and Slytherin left the school.”
Ernie continued to stare stubbornly up at her. “Well maybe he’s doing it because he’s friends with you and Malfoy – everyone knows what your families are like, with your pureblood propaganda and hatred of anyone else! He could be being influenced by you two – or you could be telling him to do it! You could be contr – “
Someone laughed behind them. Turning, Sarah saw Fred, George and Lee Jordan hurrying down the staircase, all three of them looking extremely pleased.
Sarah looked up to see Draco and Harry separate, Harry looking very dazed but happy. She glanced at Cho to see the other girl scowling at Draco.
“Of course not,” Lyra said smoothly, calmly replacing the shirt she was holding. “I was merely informing Draco that this shirt colour clashes with his skin tone.”
Another pressing matter was vying for Harry’s attention. With Katie still in St Mungo’s, he had to find a replacement Chaser before the opening match against Slytherin. Sarah had refused to tell Harry her new teammates, even Draco had been close-lipped.
“Oh, why did we go there?” groaned Hermione after a few minutes’ silence. “Harry, you were right, it was Godric’s Hollow all over again, a complete waste of time! The Deathly Hallows…such rubbish…although actually,” a sudden thought seemed to have struck her, “he might have made it all up, mightn’t he? He probably doesn’t believe in the Deathly Hallows at all, he just wanted to keep us talking until the Death Eaters arrived!”
Sarah heard Hermione gaps, and she had the odd sensation that something was swooping low over her, immersing her body in its shadow.
“What’s wrong?” he gasped, looking around the room quickly. When he determined that there was nothing wrong, he dropped his wand arm and looked towards Draco and Lyra in question. “Er – is…anything wrong?”
“You just have to tell him what you told me,” he had said, grinning from ear to ear despite the fierce glares he was getting from the surrounding Slytherins.
She saw Lee’s silver shaggy dog burst into the air, flicker feebly and expire, and her own wand trembled in her hand, and she almost welcomed the oncoming oblivions, the promise of nothing, of no feeling…
stressed?” Harry exclaimed. He ran a hand through his hair, messing up the already tousled locks. “Maybe I should have warned them…”
“It seems – almost impossible – that Black could have entered the school without inside help. I did express my concerns when you appointed – “
Ron flushed slightly but grinned. “Probably smarter to get the little fellas to do it. See you tomorrow, mate!”
Draco placed small, open mouth kisses wherever he could reach as Harry slowly caught his breath, pulling gently out of Draco.
Sirius looked at her in horror before pushing her laughing body through the doors to the front sitting room, where Harry, Draco and Remus were already standing with a selection of Weasleys.
Theo flinched at the memory. “Daphne had come out to ask for our help; thought we could calm them down or something.”
“And that was when Sarah, Draco and Sirius arrived,” Ginny said. “Next thing I knew, Sarah was blasting a Death Eater away from me and running after Draco and Harry.”
“N.E.W.Ts are going to kill me,” Pansy whined from Blaise’s bed. “I swear we haven’t even learnt half this stuff.”
“I found them in a second-floor bathroom,” Snape explained. “I need to go back to deal with Potter. Use this spell.”
“As you can see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position,” Lockhart told the silent crowd. “One the count of three, we will each cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.”
Neville leant against his bedpost and watched the two of them avidly. Harry decided it was better to sit this one out and join him.
“Misbehaviour in Dolores Umbridge’s class could cost you must more than House points and detention.”
“Miss Granger,” said Snape in a voice of deadly calm, “I was under the impression that I am teaching this lesson, not you. And I am telling you all to turn to page 394.” He glanced around again. “
Before anyone could reply, Mrs Weasley appeared from the kitchen with a large cake in her hands. She called everyone to attention and the group crowded together near the buffet table with Harry standing awkwardly at the front. His face was bright red as everyone sang happy birthday before distributing cake slices.
Theo went to open his mouth but stopped when Kingsley stepped forward on the raised platform to address those who had remained behind.
Sarah burst into laughter along with most of the crowd and she threw Draco’s wand back at him, his Seeker reflexes allowing him to grab it from the air with ease.
Harry’s announcement made Sarah pause with her fork poised in front of her mouth. He had dropped unexpectedly into the seat opposite Sarah and Draco at the Slytherin table the next morning at breakfast.
The room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace, and as such, was even more cluttered than the kitchen. Though much smaller and entirely round, the room somewhat resembled the Room of Requirement piled high with hidden objects. There were piles upon piles of books and papers on every surface. Delicately made models of creatures Sarah did not recognise, all flapping wings or snapping jaws, hung from the ceiling.
Draco shivered slightly against him and Harry wrapped his arms around the other boy, holding him tightly.
“Dobby, I need to ask a favour,” Harry said. He bent down so he was eye-to-eye with Dobby. “I’m going to ask Draco to go to the Yule Ball with me but I need your help. Will that be okay?”
Sarah turned to face the tapestry Sirius was talking about as Kreacher left the room, muttering loudly under his breath.
After a few days of walking around in a constant state of half-arousal after failing at not watching Draco spend way too long rubbing moisturiser into his skin each morning, Harry finally caved and went to the only person he could think of to help him.
“Yes, they’re very complimentary about you now, Harry,” observed Sarah as she scanned the article. “Honestly, it’s a load of rubbish. I’d prefer to read that quiz you have Luna.”
“Perfect Quidditch conditions!” said Wood enthusiastically at the Gryffindor table, loading the team’s plates with scrambled eggs. Sarah and Draco watched in amusement as Harry struggled to eat through the sheer amount of food being piled in front of him. Sarah took pity on him and scraped a bit of it onto Draco’s plate.
Luna walked towards the grave, crouched down and placed her fingers tenderly upon each of the elf’s eyelids, sliding them over his glassy green stare.
Neville looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone to help him, then said, in barely more than a whisper, “Professor Snape.”
“Apparently Dumbledore wants Harry to talk to Slughorn,” explained Draco quietly. “Get a memory from him. It’s meant to help…”
He dropped his bag at his feet and angrily sat down, slamming his quill, parchment and textbook on the desk before he began furiously taking notes.
“Thank you,” said Lee’s voice. “And now we turn to regular contributor, Royal, for an update on how the new wizarding order is affecting the Muggle world.”
“What have you chosen then?” she asked, grabbing his list. “Only Care of Magical Creatures and Divination? That’s pathetic, Ronald.”
“Sorry for waking you up,” she said in a nasal tone. She wiped her face with her borrowed shirt and burrowed deeper against Harry’s chest.
He smiled down at her. “Considering how many practises we’ve had these past weeks, I’d be worried if I wasn’t.”
“Then…where is it?” asked Umbridge, with a hint of incredulity in her voice as Sarah continued to stride toward the forest.
“That’ll be enough,” said Harry, who was examining Griphook’s hand-drawn map of the deepest passageways.
“With lots of cushioning charms,” Harry muttered to Draco as he led him to the dining room. “I’ll just go grab dinner. Teddy, would you help Draco get settled?”
“I’ll do it,” said Ron at once. “I’ll tell her Peeves is smashing up the Transfiguration department or something, it’s miles away from her office. Come to think of it, I could probably persuade Peeves to do it if I met him on the way…”
“Well, I think that went quite well,” said Hermione happily as they all walked out of the Hog’s Head. Pansy and Millicent had gone off together and Theo had returned to the castle. Blaise had already disappeared, probably to find Jessibah and shove his tongue down her throat.
Harry peered down at her seriously and put his hands on her shoulders. He couldn’t help but admire how strong she was even when she had lost so much in the last few years.
“Excellent,” Harry said brightly. “Right, well, Kreacher will show you to your rooms once you’re done. I think I’ll have an early night.”
“I think you’d be an extremely good Healer,” observed Madam Pomfrey. “You can keep your head in an emergency but you also have the magical capability. Your results are extremely high as well – that’s important in becoming a Healer.”
Harry nodded and leant down to kiss Draco gently as he slowly began to thrust in and out, barely containing a low groan at the sensation of tight heat constricting against his cock.
“IT WASN’T A NIGHTMARE!” Ron yelled. “PROFESSOR I WOKE UP, AND SIRIUS BLACK WAS STANDING OVER ME, HOLDING A KNIFE!”
Sarah’s eyes shot open at the shout. Ron had burst into the drawing room; the Death Eater above Sarah looked around, his wand raised high –
“Okay, brilliant.” Sarah looked around at the disorganised room and made up her mind. “You two go. I’ll stay here and try to explain things as best as I can. When you all get back we’ll decide what we need to do next.”
“There you guys are!” exclaimed Sarah as they finally made their way downstairs. “I’ve been waiting for ages!”
Hermione looked amused. “I have my hands full with Ron and Harry, unfortunately. You’re on your own.”
“We don’t know what he was hit with,” Sirius said thickly. He gazed down at his husband’s still body and began to cry. “I don’t know, I don’t know.”
Sirius winced slightly. “Er – about that,” he muttered, running a hand through his hair in a manner reminiscent of Harry. “You’ve only done about half, maybe less, of the first floor. One of the doors was locked which led to another wing.”
The four of them looked under the sink where Myrtle was pointing. A small, thin book lay there. It had a shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom. Harry stepped forward to pick it up, but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back.
“I won’t, I promise,” he rushed. “This year’s really taught me what’s most important and petty jealously isn’t it. I’ll be better, I will.”
“Well, think back,” said Sarah. “Have you ever let it slip that you’d like to go out in public with the words ‘My Sweetheart’ round your neck?”
“Shit, really?” Blaise said, turning sharply to face her. “I’m guessing that conversation didn’t go too well.”
Finally, the feast came to an end and the Slytherins trundled tiredly down to their common room. Sarah gave Draco a quick hug before stumbling to her dorm, collapsing in a heap upon her bed and falling into a blissful sleep.
“Very well,” Lyra replied. “Aunty Andie was saying that she’s taken up knitting. Apparently, Molly left an impact on her since her last visit.”
Draco felt a warmth blossom in his chest at Teddy’s pure faith and leant forward to ruffle the boy’s hair.
Ron had become an instant celebrity. For the first time in his life, people were paying more attention to him than to Harry, and it was clear that Ron was rather enjoying the experience. He was more than happy to recount every detail of the night’s events to whoever asked what happened.
“That story never fails to kill me,” Naomi gasped, wiping her eyes. “Poor baby Draco with his endless admirers.”
“We were expecting you young Malfoys to meet us at the cabinet,” a gruff voice said behind them. “Imagine our surprise when the room was empty.”
Instead of having it in a snowy forest clearing like Sarah had, Draco and Harry had chosen to have a gathering in the Manor grounds. They had properly moved in there after Narcissa had left for France, with Sarah and Fred moving into her family Manor. Harry had decided to keep his parents’ old house for Teddy or his own children.
“Just you flying,” Sarah replied, rubbing her temples. Harry’s flying had given her a headache. “I managed to get a brief glimpse of a memory but you quickly shoved me out.”
“It’s a diary,” Harry stated, drawing closer to the other three and opening it eagerly to the first page. The name “T. M. Riddle” in smudged ink could just be made out.
“The Cruciatus Curse,” said Moody. “Needs to be a bit bigger for you to get the idea,” he said, pointing his wand at the spider, “
“Well, I spoke with him again today and asked about protection when school ends and he said he has a place we can stay,” Lyra stated, ignoring Draco’s incredulous look.
“I think we better get started now,” she said, standing up straight, a queen taking back her throne. “I only have so much time to look completely irresistible. I want to make her regret ever getting on her knees for Goldstein.”
There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to say loudly, “If Scabbers hadn’t just been
Professor McGonagall, deputy headmistress and Head of Gryffindor House, had come dashing out of the Great Hall; she skidded on the wet floor and grabbed Hermione around the neck to stop herself from falling.
“I forgot they were coming now!” shrieked Hermione. She reached forward and grabbed her letter, jumping from the table before ripping it open.
“They’ve also started to move against Muggleborns,” Remus said, pointing at the newspaper again. “They believe that Muggleborns are acquiring magic through theft.”
“The Goblet of Fire is a binding contract,” Mr Crouch said sternly. “You are now a champion – you must compete.”
“I believe I will leave you two alone, I think you have much to discuss,” Dumbledore said, blue eyes twinkling behind his half-moon glasses. “I will contact you both when I have more to tell you.”
Sarah leant back against Fred’s chest as she quietly confessed her thoughts and conclusions about her mother’s death. Fred didn’t say anything but his grip around her tightened slightly.
Sarah was so tempted to go and slam her fist into Smith’s face but refrained from doing so, instead accepting a pass from Blaise and putting it through the goals.
Ron just grunted and Padma stood in a huff, accepting Blaise’s hand gratefully. Blaise shot Sarah a wink and led the other girl away.
“Get – away – from – there – “ Percy said, striding toward them and starting to bustle them along, flapping his arms. “Don’t you
“You don’t understand. There isn’t much time. We’ve got to get into the castle,” Harry said. “Dumbledore – I mean, your brother – wanted us – “
Ron was enraged that Hermione had never taken Crookshanks’s attempts to eat Scabbers seriously, hadn’t bothered to keep a close enough watch on him, and was still trying to pretend that Crookshanks was innocent by suggesting that Ron look for Scabbers under all the boys’ bed. Hermione, meanwhile, maintained fiercely that Ron had no proof that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger hairs might have been there since Christmas, and that Ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever since Crookshanks had landed on Ron’s head in the Magical Menagerie.
Draco watched him in open disgust as he said, “Well, we’re not a couple, Weasley. And we don’t intend on ever being one.”
Draco flushed slightly. He had been thanking Blaise for his gift but could clearly overhear Fred’s words.
The cheerful tune started up from inside the marquee and Monsieur Delacour nodded excitedly at Gabrielle. The younger girl beamed widely at her sister and began walking down the aisle, Ginny and Sarah following with Fleur and her father on their heels.
“Their blood is pure,” said Sarah primly, making the wizard’s attention turn to her. His pale eyes widened in shock and sweat began to bead across the top of his forehead. “Purer than many of yours, I daresay. Off you go,” she ordered the Muggleborns, who scurried forward into the fireplace and began to vanish in pairs. The Ministry wizards hung back, some looking confused, others scared and resentful. Then:
“Please, sir, we’ve done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas, and grindylows,” said Hermione, quickly, “and we’re just about to start – “
The silence swallowed them all again. Every head turned, every eye in the place seemed to have found Harry, to hold him frozen in the glare of thousands of invisible beams. Then a figure rose from the Slytherin table and Sarah recognised Tracey Davies as she raised a shaking arm and screamed, “But he’s there! Potter’s
Sarah looked up to see Harry zooming away angrily. Ginny and Demelza scored a goal apiece, giving the red-and-gold-clad supporters something to cheer about. Then Cadwallader scored again, making things level, but Luna did not seem to have noticed; she appeared singularly uninterested in such mundane things as the score, and kept attempting to draw the crowd’s attention to such things as interestingly shaped clouds and the possibility that Zacharias Smith, who had so far failed to maintain possession of the Quaffle for longer than a minute, was suffering from something called “Loser’s Lurgy.”
Sarah looked up as Draco raced toward her, his smile nearly blinding her as his white suit glimmered golden in the light. He swept her up in a tight embrace, twirling her around as they both laughed loudly.
Rosie snorted. “Hardly,” she said. “Naomi’s been ill the last few days so I’ve started drinking herbal tea to fight off the cold. I can’t possibly leave you alone here with only the animals for company.”
With that, Professor Snape spun around, his black robes flaring as he quickly exited the Hospital Wing.
“We’re not laughing,” said Harry. Ron blinked. “It’s a brilliant idea! It’d be really cool if you got on the team! I’ve never seen you play Keeper, are you good?”
“I’m not lying, Minister. Voldemort is back and he’s gathering his followers,” said Harry calmly from across the ward. Again, the others in the room were surprised to realise he was awake. Honestly, Sarah was glad none of them were meant to be protecting her because so far they were doing a shoddy job at being observant.
“I vas very sorry to hear about that,” Viktor said softly. “I vanted to come for the funeral but I vas avay.”
“It’s me,” she said, pushing the door open and slipping into the dimly lit room. “Are you okay, Sirius?”
Sarah nodded and let the tears she had been holding back slide down her face. Fred’s breath was warm against her hair as he continued, “I want you to promise me that you’ll come to me or Draco or Remus or Sirius or Harry – anyone – if you need to. Don’t bottle this up inside you. Talk to me, talk to others – you’re not alone – neither you nor Harry.”
Sarah and Fred looked at each other before bursting into laughter. There was no way they would be doing
She spun on her heel and marched toward the Great Hall and the Slytherin table, not bothering to check if anyone was following her.
Draco exploded with laughter again and didn’t manage to calm down until they arrived in Charms twenty minutes later.
Sarah heard Hagrid’s moan of pain and shock but she did not stop; she walked slowly forward with Draco and Harry until they reached the place where Dumbledore lay. Harry crouched down beside him, Sarah and Draco standing behind him.
The five of them were in an excellent mood when they arrived at the station. Sarah hugged Draco tightly goodbye and greeted Narcissa, before following Harry, Hermione and the Weasleys through the platform barrier.
Two weeks before the end of the term, the sky lightened suddenly to a dazzling, opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morning covered in glittering frost. Inside the castle, there was a buzz of Christmas in the air. Professor Flitwick had already decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned out to be real, fluttering fairies. The students were all happily discussing their plans for the holidays. Sarah and Draco had decided to stay home for the holidays, as Narcissa had hinted in her most recent letter than an unexpected guest had taken up residence in Malfoy Manor. Sarah knew that her father was camping out there in case she returned for the holidays. Ron and Hermione were also staying at Hogwarts, though they were doing it to keep Harry company. Luckily for Sarah and Draco, the other people in their dorms had decided to go home, which meant that they could bring the Gryffindors in to hang out without anyone caring about it.
“Rich, old families? Sounds like the aristocracy to me,” Rosie said airily. “Do you think green-eyed beauty is single? I’m sure Naomi wouldn’t mind him joining us for a tumble between the sheets.”
Potter, Granger and Weasley sat there in shock as they processed her words. Lyra ignored them and glared at the lake, regretting not grabbing something from the Great Hall before accosting the Gryffindors.
“I’m just happy we’re all here,” Harry replied. He gripped one of Draco’s hands tightly in his and Draco’s curious expression softened into a sad smile.
“Well, you know, they do work well on non-magical wounds,” said Hermione fairly. “I suppose something in that snake’s venom dissolves them or something…I wonder where the tearoom is?”
“So what?” he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces. “So what? You send Dementors down my street, I’ll send a Patronus back at ‘em! I’m not having ‘em near me, I’ve told you that, I’m not having it!”
Sarah’s father released her hair, shoving her forward roughly and causing her to fall face first in the coarse dirt. She spun around, backing away from him as he advanced slowly, turning up the sleeves of his robes to make movement easier. The Dark Mark glinted ink-black against the paleness of his left forearm.
“And if you don’t start behaving, you won’t get another story again,” Draco threatened as he walked into the room, arms ladened with a tray of new drinks.
Professor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape was looking as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed poison.
“They don’t know?” Mrs Longbottom said incredulously. She turned to Draco and looked down her nose at him. “Too ashamed were you? Good.” She turned back to Ron and the others and said in the same haughty tone, “It’s thanks to
Draco stood in front of the sink with his arms crossed over his face, his face set defiantly as he stared at his sister.
Mad-Eye growled his approval of this idea and set himself with his back against a corridor wall, his magical eye pinning in all directions. Harry, Draco and Sarah drew back too, but Mrs Weasley reached out a hand and pushed them all through the door, saying, “Don’t be silly, dears, Arthur wants to see you…”
Harry refused to look or speak to any of them the entire trip back to Grimmauld Place. Mrs Weasley kept asking is he was all right but he just nodded his head silently. As soon as they walked through the front door, he raced passed them all, disappearing upstairs.
“Didn’t even really give Moony a choice,” he muttered angrily. “Just arrived at Grimmauld and told him what he wanted done.”
The snow melted around the school as February arrived, to be replaced by cold, dreary wetness. Purplish-grey clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chill rain made the lawns slippery and muddy. The upshot of this was that the sixth years’ first Apparation lesson, which was scheduled for a Saturday morning so that no normal lessons would be missed, took place in the Great Hall instead of in the grounds.
“Can you believe that we only have two years left?” Ron asked as he slouched onto the bench in the compartment. “I mean, it feels like yesterday that we were shaking in our boots about to be Sorted.”
“He wants me to meet him at his cabin tonight,” Harry said, his brow furrowed. “Has something to show me apparently.”
“You got angry at Ginny for kissing Dean, didn’t you?” said Sarah slowly. “And then she went and listed all your friends who have been with someone while you haven’t. She made you feel undesirable, didn’t she?”
“Would that be okay?” Potter asked, the line crackling slightly. “Teddy would really appreciate it. And so would I.”
“Thanks for letting us stay at your place,” Theo said to her, slinging an arm around her shoulders. “I promise we didn’t make too much of a mess.”
“I was just leaving,” Draco said. Harry reluctantly dropped his arm. “I should get back and help Rosie close. One of the dogs took a turn for the worse yesterday.”
Sarah closed her eyes and finally let the tears she had been holding back fall. Harry released her hand and wound his arm around her shoulders, pulling her body against his as she sobbed quietly. The stress of training, homework and her father had gotten to her at last, crumbling beneath a mental wall weakened by lack of sleep.
“You don’t have to thank me,” he said sincerely. “You’re my best friend and I’ll always be there for you. As will Draco and Hermione and, hell, even Ron when he isn’t being a stubborn git.”
“Very funny, Coco,” Lyra said. She stared down at her plate for a moment before saying quietly, “You didn’t tell them.”
As Kreacher nodded and got to his feet, Harry suddenly moved. He pulled out Hagrid’s moleskin purse he had gotten a few years ago and took out the fake Horcrux.
Sarah groaned and slowly pulled her tired limbs out of bed. She mindlessly threw on some clothes and made half an effort to tidy her hair, then made her way downstairs.
“Remus!” Sarah called, jumping up and beaming at the man who had just walked into the Hall. She raced over and hugged him, jumping back when she felt something nudge her leg. Sirius, in his dog form, smiled up at her, tongue lolling from his mouth. “And you brought Snuffles!”
Blaise nodded solemnly. “Theo and I walked into their room yesterday to find them in the middle an extraordinary row.”
Sarah smirked devilishly at him. “We give each other pointers,” she said, enjoying the way Harry’s blush got darker. “It’s
“I think we should start with this one,” Sarah whispered. She carefully waved her wand over a large, leather-bound book to ensure there was nothing sinister about it. Once sure, she pulled it off the shelf, dropping to the ground with Draco to examine it.
All the adults turned to look at the kids' table in shocked horror as Orion giggled happily, completely oblivious to the effect his words had on them.
“Shh and let me tell it,” he scolded. Sarah mimed zipping her lips. “Yes, he was rambling so I kissed him and then told him I loved it and that I loved him. Then he started laughing and said I was sentimental because I had been planning for ages to tell him when he thought it was just obvious. And then he said it back.”
They wrote a letter to Ron which Draco and Sarah would send with one of the Manor’s owls later in the day.
“All of you get your arses down here!” called Sirius. “Unless you want Molly to come up there and drag you down by your ears!”
Harry smiled weakly. “Can we leave that as a problem for another day?” he asked. “And just go home and rest?”
“Neither the time nor place, Lyra love,” he said quietly, absently straightening his tie compulsively. He ignored the questioning look Potter sent him. “Transfiguration?” he prompted his sister.
“Oi!” said boy shouted, throwing a handful of plaster at Lyra. He laughed and shook his dark head, sending little flakes of white floating down to the ground. Harry glanced up at Draco, his green eyes bright and happy behind his dirty glasses, and Draco felt his breath catch slightly. He could not deny that Harry was extremely attractive.
is declaring you a liar and refusing to admit that Voldemort is back,” Sarah elaborated. “We didn’t want to tell you yet because it’s been quite horrible, really.”
With that, she swept gracefully from the room, wondering all the while why Harry seemed to perk up slightly at the mention of her brother.
– “ Potter called, hurrying down the hallway toward her. He had his hand reaching out in front of him as if he were about to rest it on her shoulder, but obviously thought better of it and awkwardly retracted it.
Charlie shot her a shit-eating grin. “Looks like you’re gonna have to get used to that sweetheart, if you keep up with dear Freddie.”
“So you aren’t wanted, then, Vernon? Or are you on that list under a different name? What house were you in at Hogwarts?”
The trio nodded seriously and thanked the professors before joining Harry in the corridor. He gave Sarah a questioning glance and she just shook her head at him. They followed Professors McGonagall and Snape back into the Great Hall, where they separated: the professors going to their empty seats at the teacher's table, Harry and Hermione veering off to the Gryffindor table, and Sarah and Draco going to the Slytherin table. Students looked at them curiously as they walked along the back of the hall but soon went back to their conversations.
Sarah cut off abruptly and stared down at her best friend. His face was pink from anger and he was breathing heavily.
“Bathilda must have been dead a while,” Harry elaborated. “The snake was…was inside her. You-Know-Who put it there in Godric’s Hollow, to wait. You guys were right. He knew I’d go back.”
One of Harry’s hands crept between their flexing bodies to grasp Draco’s neglected cock. Draco groaned loudly as Harry began pumping it in time to his thrusts. It only took a few pulls for Draco to spill over Harry’s fist, clenching tightly around Harry’s cock in his arse. Harry let out a strained breath as his movements became frantic. Draco’s name was a chant upon Harry’s lips as he finally found his release. Draco watched through blurry eyes as Harry stilled and shuddered, his face pressed damply against Draco’s neck. While Harry came down from his high, Draco ran his hands up and down Harry’s back, drawing patterns in the sweat-cooled skin.
Voldemort looked up at the crowd, his scarlet eyes glinting cruelly in the early morning light. His gaze seemed to lock onto Draco and Lyra and his thin mouth split into a smile.
Sarah knew she should have been listening to Professor Moody’s words but after what he had just done, all she could do was sit in shock. Draco was mechanically taking notes as if that’s all he knew how to do at this point. Harry was sitting on his other side looking dazed and horrified. Sarah knew he must be thinking about his parents – how they had no hope of stopping it, how they looked after, unmarked and unblemished, as if simply asleep but unseeing…
Hermione smiled at her through the mirror and put the finishing touches on her makeup. She had gone for a very natural look, just adding a touch of shimmery powder to her eyes and mascara. She also put on some shiny lip-gloss.
After they had signed their names, they began to leave for class. But they were stopped in the entrance way by Crabbe before they could so much as put one foot on the marble staircase.
“Don’t be a fucking idiot,” she snapped. She looked out across the attic and muttered to herself, “’
And then, at ten past five in the morning by Ron’s watch, the kitchen door swung open and Mrs Weasley entered the kitchen. She was extremely pale, but when they all turned to look at her, she gave them a wan smile.
“Now, Professor Snape has informed us of how this injury came about,” Professor Dumbledore began. “He also has informed us of your request, Lyra.” Dumbledore held up at hand as Lyra’s mouth opened to reply. “Steps are being taken to ensure your safety and your mother’s safety.”
She stood up as the others began chatting about the show. Gripping her bag tightly to her chest, she sat on the bunk and resisted the urge to rummage for the notebook she knew was buried right at the bottom of it. She had removed the charm that allowed her and Fred to communicate through it but she hadn’t had the heart to leave it behind.
“Sorry, thought you were Blaise or that hag,” muttered Pansy, flopping back against her headboard. “It was my intention to cause pain.”
“Imagine that,” he said gleefully, “a small horde of little children doing crazy experiments and picking fights.”
Meanwhile, it became clear just how many Skiving Snackboxes Fred and George had managed to sell before leaving Hogwarts. Umbridge only had to enter her classroom for the students assembled there to faint, vomit, develop dangerous fevers, or else spout blood from both nostrils. Shrieking with rage and frustration she attempted to trace the mysterious symptoms to their source but the students told her stubbornly they were suffering from “Umbridge-it is.” After putting four successive classes in detention and failing to discover their secret she was forced to give up and allow the bleeding, swooning, sweating, and vomiting students to leave her classes in droves.
