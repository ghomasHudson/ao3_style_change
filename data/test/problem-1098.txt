His scales vibrated over his skin as he watched his family dig into the food once it was fully cooked. He ached to change into his snake form, knowing he was much faster in it than his human one, and steal a bit of meat from one of them. He hadn’t had any since they first found out he could turn into a snake when he was seven. Likewise, he wasn’t even sure why he changed forms anymore as it was so long ago, only that ever since then his bed in his cupboard had been replaced with a table and a medium-sized fish tank that Uncle Vernon had found after the incident.
They decided to head to Gringotts before getting food so that Harry and Dudley could help pay for some of it. Harry thought that at least the bank would have some semblance of normalcy but he was soon proven wrong. There were no service desks with people, well there were, but they had goblins behind them. There were a lot more goblins than he had thought possible, and all of them kept staring at him and whispering about him being a prince or a protector. Snape and Dudley both sent confused glances down to the medium sized creatures only to be ignored. While Harry just tried to tune it out as much as possible and pushed down the urge to change forms. It was too bright here, he wasn’t used to being in sunlight so much, and all of the loud noise vibrations were hurting his jaw and over sensitizing him. He felt like he had a massive headache from all of it and he really wanted to hide. He knew he couldn’t though because he had to get his school things so he ignored the pain and followed Snape to the main service desk.
Severus suddenly blanched, "Right, okay, what kind of cuts, and where?"
H: Hiya!
What do I do?
H: But I do!
Uproar was the initial reaction, after Quirrel fainted (with Harry checking his pulse and such). Once Dumbledore had calmed everyone and sent the teachers on their way to the dungeons, Harry and Quirrel escaped to Fluffys room, to do more investigating.
"Mister Evans if you have impregnated mister Malfoy or he has impregnated another, I will string you up by your toes."
Harry was genuinely concerned, to be honest.
H: Okay Tom, I must go now, my uncle is calling.
Harry agreed, and the two searched Muggle London for twenty minutes before finding a suitable place to eat.
H: Is that safe?
S'okay, 'Arry." He nodded, and slid to the floor. Draco sat by him, hugging cautiously. Harry gripped onto him tight.
The man seized at the boys words, "How do you know his given name?" He asked first, avoiding the question.
Harry and Draco rejoined the adults, and they slipped into easy conversation. Harry inquired as to what was to happen with the other Weasley children, and Lucius spoke up, "Well, the ministry is organising a court date. Molly has been placed in a watching cell in the Azkaban prison, and was charged five years for child neglect on the spot, but obviously we have other things against her. She will be removed from her cell after Christmas for a full scale investigation. Each child will be interviewed, including the two oldest. And then, if Arthur is unable to take care of his children, we will see as to where we can place them for care. Koden naturally comes to us, and as Ginny has been placed in our emergency care, we would be first on the list for her home."
H: Can I tell Draco about you? He might be able to help.
Harry did have to jog to keep up for a small while as Severus had left without him, but they were soon at the marbled entrance. Harry, despite looking all evil and brooding, would always be excitable at the sight of the magical alley.
Ron sat beside him, trying to think of who. "Snape?"
The train quickly arrived at Hogwarts, and Harry stretched his muscles, loving the feel of his new robes that he had changed into in the bathroom. He packed all his books away and picked up Bellona, her wrapping herself around his neck under his shirt. Harry walked with a steel and ice cold glare,  taking long strides to where the boats he was due to ride in were placed. He ended up getting in one with a quiet dark skinned boy, the blond ponce from the robe shop and the Granger girl.
Draco nodded. Harry could see that he had a basic idea of what he was going to get.
Harry sat in between Draco and Karkoden, in front of the others. They were in their own little compartment, warded against the rest of the court. Behind him were Percy and the twins, with Severus, The Malfoys and Ginny seated behind them.
Harry was all too glad when the lesson came to an end, and Draco was fidgeting in his seat. Harry took the recently drawn and coloured pictures, folded them up, and placed them in his pocket. The fidgeting continued even as they were walking to their next lesson - history of magic - so Harry decided to take a quick detour to the toilets.
With Draco and the rest of the students around him sufficiently distracted, Harry pulled out the diary and began talking to Tom.
Everyone nodded.
When Severus found them, in his annual morning check, he almost smiled.
"I care for you a lot, Draco." He spoke, his voice low. Mentioned boy smiled; he brushed his hair out of his face to leaned up and kiss Harry's Jaw.
H: You have got to be kidding me?
Ron, er, Karkoden and Draco got along splendidly. Well, they had to. They would be living together soon if the Malfoys had any say in it.
"Yes, I'm all better. Thank you for helping, Draco." He received a proud grin in reply, "Say, darling, what are you drawing?"
Snape was speechless, and the blond ponce spoke up, "Go on then, figure me out. Prove it." He smirked, and Harry scoffed, "I figured you out from the five minutes in the robe shop. Rich, and rather spoilt, but kept in check by your mother. Surprisingly, it is your father that insists that you must be spoilt, leading me to believe you are loved and cherished by him no matter what people say about his shady past, which he easily got out of. Which then makes you believe your daddy owns the world. There are other facts, but I do believe they are too personal, even for the Slytherin common room. Am I wrong?" The entire room was silent, and Malfoy squeaks out a tiny, "No." And everyone gasped, leaving Snape to be very impressed.
Harry, I am waiting upon  the back of Quirrels head, hurry up he has to teach again soon.
After a small conversation with Tom, the plans were changed. Instead of Harry and Draco being in the hall when Quirrel ran in to moan about the troll - which was the original plan - Harry would deposit Draco at the dorms and run in with Quirrel. The plan was practically foolproof. Draco agreed with it a bit more anyway, once he was told he could have ice cream in bed.
Severus asked about Draco, and why he bought all the childish things. Harry refused to tell him, and said Draco would explain in his own time. He did mention, however, that Severus could floo Lucius and ask him.
Ron shook his head, "No, she was fine. Born in the living room actually."
"Lets get started, shall we?"
"That is enough regarding the children. She also was drugging her husband, Arthur Weasley, with Mollia Nervos, which is a highly illegal and potent potion, designed to make someone puppet like."
"I'll teach you a few tricks one day."
"Kill Granger!"
Corner, Michael
He looked around, the bones mostly that of small creatures. Rounding a corner, he spotted a rather large snake skin. He was frozen in fear, "Belladonna really wasn't kidding." He whispered, stepping forward.
Once again, someone else was was called up. This time Severus. He was mainly there for Dumbledores case, so his statement was similar to Lucius'.
Harry decided he'd stay out of his mind. That was weird, and he didn't like it. Perhaps Tom would have a cure. For now, he grabbed Draco some clean clothes and set them in the bathroom for him.
Lucius looked pensive for a moment before tilting his head, "I'm not sure, but more than likely you as it's alphabetical."
The voice was almost welcomed, and Harry escaped into his mind, the black smoke like substance in the corner clearer. He walked through, and saw Tom sitting, still chained in his chair.
Ron motioned for him to continue.
"Could.. could you ask uncle Lucius that?"
"You do not... Share a mind, do you?"
Tell him about me if he corners you. Make it dramatic and sad. Make him feel bad for you, like you're a victim. Do not let him know you did it off your own will.
"How could muggles know such magic that not even we know of?" Narcissa asked, "Well you see, its not magic. Its a very high level of logic. And you have to be very smart to acquire the gift. Many people are born with it, but few learn how to control it. And the few that do control it, hide this gift, as they are tended to be used." Harry explained as simply as he could. The two Malfoys nodded, and Snape shook his head. "You really are extraordinary, aren't you?" Snape chuckled, sitting up.
Draco, suddenly filled with unwanted anxiety, nodded.
"Are you okay? You look a little lost." The concern was very clear in his tone, and the boy slightly shook his head.
T: Hello?
Outside the store, he found out it was also for Draco. "He has to look fashionable while I'm doing my evil bidding," he murmured, "I can change the colour if he doesn't like it."
All he was met with was a nod and kiss on his head, "Thank you for trusting me. I promise to never let anything happen to you, my sweet."
"The first witness statement please, Mrs Narcissa Malfoy, nee Black, step down to the witness stand."
He was met with a shrug, "She needed to die."
"Yeah, Ginny. She's cute." He had an unwavering amount of love in his tone, and Harry couldn't help but smile.
Harry decided they were both presentable and slipped their shoes on, before walking Draco into the bathroom to brush his teeth. Draco left his little belongings tucked up on Harry's bed, and the two made way for the great hall.
"No. You shall not do it alone." His voice was wavering, but only slightly. Narcissa got up, telling her husband quickly that she was taking the children home. Lucius nodded, and Draco was dragged away with the other two.
"Well, she would call me useless, and say I was dirt and that she was going to kill me."
After introductions, Percy ushered everyone back to the castle. Neville and Harry wandered off, with a warning glare from the oldest.
Draco finished his drawing quietly, and Harry sat back watching him.
Percy and Severus got along quite well, and after eating excused himself so the two could finish their conversation. He wandered the halls, delving into his mind. He found Voldemort to be good at keeping him company.
After most of Harry's scars were almost faded, he redressed himself. Severus was obviously keen to talk to Tom, and so Harry reached under his pillow for the diary. He grabbed an inkwell and quill, sitting back down besides his professor. He flipped the book open, dipping his quill in the ink.
The mentioned man turned bright red, "How dare y-!"
Her cries drew eyes, but Lucius' presence soon had them averting them again. Karkoden was holding his hand, and soon they were at Severus' office door.
"Yeah, among other children." Harry mumbled, looking around the shop. He didn't dare touch anything while Severus browsed, or so the older man thought. Severus didn't buy anything, and the two of them were exploring the alley once again.
She often did, disappearing for weeks at a time. They had agreed that she would stay at Hogwarts over the summer, as she was quite safe here.
Harry turned his head to the window and said, "Don't do dark arts, kids!" He then stuck his thumbs up and turned back to Tom, a bored expression on his face. Tom scoffed, "You're so muggle." And Harry nodded, "I know dear. Now, what are we doing?" He drawled, leaning back in his chair, "Well, we know where the stone is, but a rather large amount of traps are being set. Baring in mind a two year old could pass them, but I need to know what spells Dumbledore has placed on it. Quirrels magic is too weak to do that level of spell casting, and while I could, I cant risk Dumbledore getting my magical signature. Plus, using that amount of magic when I'm not whole could be dangerous."
While Severus was talking to Tom, Harry decided to spend some time with Draco. The little boy was all to happy to see his best friend approaching.
"Why would we help you?" One of the many snakes hissed back, and Harry thought quickly.
"No." Tom's voice was hard, and it was clear no one but Harry was to answer.
T: Goodbye child.
When he was looking up a ginger boy opened the door, "Excuse me? Can I sit here?" Harry wanted the world to swallow him whole. He groaned, "Sure, but sit over there, my snake wont appreciate being sat on." He motioned lazily at the galaxy themed snake by his book he was reading.
T: I remember the first time all of my followers killed someone, some were stricken with glee, and they made me sick, others cried, one particular man didnt show up for nearly six months afterward. I started to loose my sanity, about six months before my demise and now I'm stuck as a book. The light side twisted my doings, and said i was out for muggles and muggleborns, which was true, but is no longer. I did see them as lesser, and did not want Muggle raised at Hogwarts, and that is still true in some forms. I hate the fact that muggle raised are bringing such filth to Hogwarts and extracting it from its roots. Dumbledore is not a good man, however by any means. Shall I go on? I can sense that youre tired.
Then, as if by magic almost, words appeared on the page, and the child rushed to put on his too big glasses.
T: Thank you, love. I'll make it work.
T: I always wanted children, and I suppose he sort of popped up. I took the chance.
With the newfound tragedy it was easy for Harry to sneak around the school. He shone his torch down the trap door, eventually, to see that it was in fact devils snare. He hadn't gone down, just in case there was no way out. It did look rather deep.
After showering he tied a towel around his waist and all but dragged Draco into the shower, letting the water spray onto him, his tears getting mixed in. Harry washed him gently, humming softly. Soon enough they were clean and Harry got Draco and himself dry and dressed, ready for classes.
Tom was sweaty, and he looked sickly.
Lucius scoffed, "Honestly dear, I do know how to look after children." She gave him a side eye, before leaving. Harry burst out laughing, clutching his stomach. Severus also smiled. He had turned down the offer of ice cream, but now he was almost regretting it.
"No, but it's okay cause I got Harry now. He looks after me! But I'd still like to come see you sometimes."
Harry coughed a little, "Sorry, what? How big?"
Too soon, Fred was being called up, just as Lucius had suspected.
"No sir, like Muggle London."
After sitting down, Molly was called back out, back into her chair.
"Percy!" He called, turning the corner to be met with two faces. Wrong Weasleys. Harry huffed, "Do you guys know where Percy is?"
Percy laughed, "You need to be careful. Don't go exploring by yourself."
When he opened his eyes, they were blazing red. The fire and anger was evident deep within, and he was met with four sharp intakes of breath, before blinking once again and having his bright green back. "Back to the task at hand, yes?"
"Harry! There you are. Come on, I've got to keep an eye one you. Let's go." Percy grabbed his hand, twisting on his heel and walking back in the direction he came.
Draco readily nodded, "Let's go! Mr. Teddy and Straw are gonna be lonely."
There were hundreds initials in the wall, and he decided to scratch his into the woodwork near Toms. H.J.P/R written in his untidy scrawl under the notably neater one. He stuck his nose in a book, and that was that.
Severus nodded, feeling peckish himself, "I'm not paying for you."
"So what did you two get for Christmas, then?"
In fact, very mad. But the boy simply told him it was fine and that he was tired. So he closed the diary and went to sleep. Tom was upset, however the boy apologized for it in the morning and all was well.
"I don't know how I can do it. It's unsettling and strange. I can see memories pop up, they're faint. I can ignore them usually, and I dont pay much attention. It was a gift so that I could avoid my uncles brutal throws when I was younger, but now it's more of a curse. It is still lovely, but now I know it would end up in my enslavement. I can delve deeper. Watch peoples lives in thirty seconds. Everything is fast and nothing makes much sense. Recent memories are stronger, and if I poke around I can know the things you recently thought about."
The large man - half giant - was talking, but Harry wasn't listening. He hardly noticed when the old man dropped his mole skin coat over him and laid on the slowly sinking sofa.
T: Well you see, one part of my soul is on the back of Quirrels head,
"Yes, Potter?" Snape said, barely containing the sneer, and Harry decided to pull out the big guns, "Please Professor, is their any way to get my last name changed? My father was an utmost vile man and I do not wish to share his name. If possible, I would prefer to go by Evans, my mothers maiden name." He said politely, and Snape nodded, "I shall see what I can do. Now, was that your question, or just a spur of the moment?" Harry nodded,
Harry was awoken by a small tapping on his shoulder, and when he blinked his eyes open he saw Draco standing at the side of his bed. His hair was sleep mussed, his two friends and blanket clutched under his left arm and his dummy lazily bobbing between his lips.
There was no more meetings between Harry and Tom-Quirrel, but they spoke through the diary almost daily. Harry ended up telling Tom about Draco's regression, not used to keeping secrets from him. Tom too thought it was adorable.
"Do stop staring Harry, it doesn't do well for your image." The man drawled, his body limp but still radiating power.
T: Hello child, how was your day?
"Oh no. He is chained up in here," Harry tapped the side of his head, "but he talks. I dream of things, that only this half knows, meaning you have forgotten them. For instance, I know wjere your spell book is. Do you, Tom?"
H: Tom, Draco's asleep so let's talk about how exactly I'm getting you out of this book.
Malone, Roger
"What are those? Where did you get them?" Severus asked, the alarm apparent.
H: Tom, you're getting off track, how did she know he wasn't dead?
There was a knock on their dorm door, and it was pushed open in a second. Draco froze but Harry blocked the intruders view with his body, pulling his wand, just to see it was their head of house.
She hit the ground with a thud, her face frozen in terror. Harry sat by her, and dragged one of his fingers down her cheek. "Sorry, professor." His voice was dead as he drive the knife straight through her chest. He twisted the knife, so the wound was more open.
Draco slumped, "You're just going to keep killing, aren't you?"
After that was done they arrived at their lesson, taking a seat at the back. Draco was asleep within five minutes and Harry got tired of waking him just for him to fall back asleep.
H: Thanks!
"Well, I helped set up their rooms. Koden wanted to do the cleansing ritual quite quickly, so after he was settled and had clear health my mum cleansed him of unwanted magicks. We all hung out really, tool them shopping. Just, kid stuff."
"It's a deal." Harry nodded, and escaped his mind. He went to sleep with a sadistic look on his face.
"Excuse me, Griphook?" Mentioned goblin turned to the boy and nodded, "Is there anyway to get Muggle money? From my fortune already, I mean."
Harry was stunned,
He heard rustling behind him, tensing his shoulders.
Harry was instantly alarmed. He could not afford to go insane. "Why didn't Tom tell me you were here?"
She spoke with Severus, and got her a dreamless sleep and calming draught. They got her the correct amount and had her take both, with her falling asleep in minutes.
Once they were out of the magical alley, Harry perked up a bit more. "Can we sit in a diner, professor? I'm getting hungry."
(See the end of the chapter for
H: I suppose.
Soon, they were in Severus' rooms.
He backed Harry to a wall, and growled lowly, "Motive?"
Draco gripped Harry's robes tighter and soaked up his warmth, his body trembling. Harry started humming a little tune, and Draco's anxiety melted away. All that mattered right now was Harry, he knew he would understand why it had to happen eventually.
"What can you do about this one?" He asked suddenly, laying back so the full scar came into view. Even Severus felt a pang of pain at that one.
Longbottom, Neville
Lucius was about to speak when Narcissa spoke up, "No. I love my sister, but I have no idea what state she'll be in. No one but myself, Severus, Tom and possibly Lucius shall have any contact with her until I deem her healthy. We have a ward in our Manor, but she will have her own seperate room, charmed and protected. She was insane before Azkaban due to the loss of her son. If we give him back to her while she's still ill there's no saying what she'll do. She would go to lengths to keep him close to her, such as murder. She is a powerful witch."
He rested a gentle hand on Harry's shoulder, and shook his slightly, "Harry, can you wake up for me?"
Narcissa had spoiled Ginny, excited to have a little girl, even if it was temporarily. The girl had clearly never had the best of things, and Narcissa decided she deserved it.
Now that that was done, Harry was readying to leave.
He noted his dummy bobbing in his mouth, and pulled it out, unclippling it from his shirt. He handed it to Harry, "No thank you, darling." He smiled, but it was t very convincing. His voice was raw and cheeks tear stained, plus he looked exhausted. Draco kissed Harry's cheek and placed it on the bedside table.
He acted clueless, but spoke in an incriminating way. He mentioned Ginny's strange birthing times, and that was checked over. It was seen that there was no way Ron and Ginny could both be the Weasleys biological children, and so were both due to be given blood tests tomorrow.
"I'll get back to you on that. Is there a quicker way out of here? Also, Belladonna."
"I know sweetheart," Severus swung open his office door, and made quick work of making his way to Draco's dorm.
“Are you afraid of him?”
The old tattered books at his side called to him like an old familiar song when he imagined where they came from and why. He picked up the serpent book first, flicking through it haphazardly and only searching for torn pages. When he didn’t find any he set the book back down and picked up the flowery red one like he was trying to get close to an injured animal. He bit the inside of his cheek as he flicked the book open to quickly find hastily torn pages. He then matched the letters up to the ripped up interior and frowned when they all fit together. What would make her rip only a few of them out? Why didn’t she leave them with the others?
“Your mother instructed me to give you this, little horned serpent.” Slurd said while holding out the envelope for Harry to take.
In order to do that though he needed to find Snape.
“Mom said you get the corner of the floor and I get the other bed.” Dudley smirked with a haughty reply.
His stomach rumbled almost as loud as his thoughts were in his head and made him groan in rebuttal. He was tired and annoyed. All he wanted to do was eat something but this was taking forever. It felt like they had been here for over an hour and were still in the lobby! Harry had eventually gone to sit on a bench to pass the time and watched the goblins with predatory eyes. Dudley came over beside him on the bench and let out a long sigh, which Harry knew from experience meant that he was bored as well. He glanced over to the service desk and saw that their chaperone was still talking to the same goblin.
His pajamas, like all of his clothes, were Dudley’s from two years ago and made him look like a small doll trapped inside of a pillowcase. Harry didn’t seem to notice him watching, or didn’t care, as he turned around and took off his shirt only to put on an equally large t-shirt and sweater.
“I see. I believe I have something for you that will assist you in both of these endeavors.”
His words caught in his throat when he thought Harry would be offended and think he didn’t want to be friends or wanted him dead.
Then at nine there was the addition of the invisible door lock that didn’t have a traditional knob which replaced the previous keypad handle after Vernon broke it in a fit of rage when he forgot the code. With the new addition he installed a new keypad that came with a remote control that he kept on him at all times. Which was the exact same one that had lasted for the past three years.
To this day Dudley had never been sure if he wasn’t supposed to mess with the new knob or if his father had meant he could no longer be friends with Harry. His childish mind had accepted quicker than he’d now like to admit that he reasoned it meant both, and took Vernon’s words to heart, especially when he had mentioned their special language. Regrettably, he began treating his former friend just like his father did while his mother just watched from the sidelines with small noises of encouragement when Vernon was around.
“Currently? Terrified.”
“Why do you wish for that?”
The ten inch snake scrunched up his face and flashed his fangs in response, which was a very non-snake thing to do. Contrary to what most thought, Dudley wasn’t an idiot and always knew that Harry didn’t eat nearly enough because of his parents' rules. He also knew that if they had a choice of raising Harry as a human or something else that they were going to choose the other form so that he really “didn’t exist,” as they so enjoyed reminding the boys. So he figured that if his parents were more than likely going to force his cousin to live his life in this new form then the least he could do is try to sneak him the correct food and be able to read his body language.
Harry just nodded beside him since he wasn’t sure if he should say anything else. Was there a truce between them now that they were similar or was Dudley going to deny it and still torture him? Deciding it was better to not ask, he took off his glasses, frames really as they had no lenses, and readied himself to curl up on the floor, debating whether to sleep in his scales when Dudley spoke up once more.
“How dare you do that to my husband! Change him back immediately and leave! You have absolutely no business being around us!”
Harry poked his head out from under the pillow and glanced over at his cousin. He was certain that if snakes could look drowsy then he would look exhausted. The bruises on his ribs were burning from all the moving around he had to do in their hasty escape from the letters, and he was fairly certain one of them was broken. His stomach growled in contempt once more as he waited on Dudley to speak. Even his scales somehow ached from exhaustion, and he couldn’t for the life of him remember the last time he had drank something. He knew if he looked in the mirror in his skin form that his eyes would have dark circles under them and his ribs would be sticking out under Dudley’s hand-me-downs.
He heard Professor Snape say to them after a while.
“Why do you call me that exactly?  Horned serpent, I mean. It’s just… I got told why from someone else but it didn’t make sense so I was wondering if you’d explain it a bit better?”
“He looks like a strange mix between a pig and a bird like that.” Harry hissed out from behind him.
“What’s in the box?”
“Honestly Harry, it’s like you’ve never spoken to another magical being before! Didn’t your Oma teach you anything?”
They left the small bathroom and were greeted with his parents yelling at some long haired man with a rather large nose. Dudley thought he looked like his old math teacher Mr. Wilder who wasn’t one of his favorites, then again he didn’t really like any of them. The man was glaring at his parents and his father seemed to be squirming under his gaze. If Dudley had seen this a couple days ago then he would have come to the defence of his parents, but now he only wished to encourage his father’s fear, especially since he knew what was going to happen to him after this strange man left. Upon closer inspection he saw that the man had a small box wrapped in dark green wrapping paper in his hands.
“Glad to be of help Keeper Dudley!”
It was strange how two words: like him, could be filled with love one second then so much hate and fear it consumed your very core the next. Harry was thankful for it though because for the first time in their lives since the accident he felt like they were finally on the same page on how awful the elder Dursleys' really were. Petunia was more passive, but Vernon was known to favor his fists more than words and knew where to strike to not raise suspicion.
“Don’t call me that you disgusting sewer rat! Why on earth would they send you of all people to come get them anyway?!”
'Probably mom’s doing,' He thought before he saw Harry change back to human.
Harry learns some family secrets and is even more confused
To prove his point Harry shoved his letter in Dudley’s hands and his own letter was shoved none too gently at him. He wasn’t sure if it was the force of the shove that Dudley gave him or the fact that he was so thin that made him almost go backwards. Split second panic rose in him as he started to fall over only for his wrist closest to his cousin to be pulled back gently which Harry assumed was a reflex for the other when it wasn’t acknowledged. His cousin favored skimming his own letter instead and Harry saw the exact moment Dudley realized Vernon wouldn’t show mercy due to their blood relation.
Before any of the three wizards could move the Oruwin jumped off of Dudley’s shoulder and ran straight into the nest. Dudley called and ran after him only for Harry and Snape to follow closely behind. Their bodies shrunk automatically as the rings and pendant reacted to the hive's spells.
He had started researching the day after Harry bit him and had every intention of telling him all he had learned about snakes when he got home that day only to find Harry’s door had odd pieces of metal attached to it. The normal knob had been taken down and replaced with a knob that had a keypad above it.
Snape sat down on one of the floating seats and eyed them expectedly making the children squirm a bit before they followed his lead once more. No words were spoken between them as the bus started moving. An announcement came on from the driver that they should buckle up before they really got going. The three of them did as they were told as they looked down to see seat belt attachments now next to them. Harry had just buckled his in when the bus jerked forward. The strap did nothing to keep him in his seat due to his small size as he went flying through the air. Midway through his ascent panic took over his senses as he shifted back into his snake form and landed in a pile of suitcases that had fallen off of the overhead rack.
Harry and Dudley meet Professor Snape, take the knight bus to Diagon alley and Dudley makes a friend.
Harry glared at his cousin for interrupting his impromptu meal and screamed when he was suddenly drenched in water. Harry reflexively dropped the mouse, ignoring the thud and subsequent scampering, and wiped his eyes of the water that he was somehow drenched in. Glancing up afterward to see a small storm cloud fading from atop his head.
The goblin continued on his way and left Harry with just the manilla envelope in his hands. Realizing no one else was going to give him any actual answers he decided to take matters into his own hands and see if his mother had anything to say. He exhaled a deep sigh he hadn’t known he was holding in before opening the envelope and found that it contained a smaller envelope that he found held a letter as well as two old books. Taking them out one by one he saw that both books were rather thick regardless of their medium size and seemed as if they were being ripped apart from all the pages stuffed in them or as if they were held together by sheer force of will.
Harry’s eyes widened as he peered at the box in the professor’s hand. It was small, whatever it was but it was also his mother’s so he knew that he would cherish it forever.
Harry’s hands fidgeted anxiously as the goblin only paused his step at his words, “If you already know the answer then there is no need for me to repeat it.”
The noise from the adults in the other room filtered through the closed door and he tried to tune into it even though it was nearly impossible to hear anything over his mother’s crowing.
He debated on what to tell Dudley that wouldn’t be overtly rude, as in: ‘No, we can’t both fit because you’re a giant pig’, since he’s pretty sure the other boy was trying to extend some semblance of peace before the oncoming storm that was Vernon Dursley. So instead he just nodded, shifted into his snake form and allowed Dudley to pick him up to set him on the bed gently. He honestly didn’t know the other boy could be gentle, especially not when it came to him.
“Get off him you vile creature!” Petunia screamed out just as the world around him came into focus.
‘How on earth is he still sleeping?’ Dudley thought as he got a hand out from under the snake and poked him in between his eyes.
A wave of nausea overtook him, as it always did when he felt like he was talking for too long or when he felt like he was being too much of a person than was allowed; he forced his eyes shut to readjust himself. His hands clenched at his sides upon reflex and fought the urge to change back into a snake once more as he gathered the courage to ask the goblin what he wanted to know.
“'Verus! It’s so good to see you again!” The woman yelled from behind the counter.
“I’m not… I swear! See, look.”
The man looked stunned once all of their questions had been asked and they were waiting anxiously for a reply. He went on to explain that a parselmouth is a person who can talk to snakes and that it was an extremely rare trait to have. While a maledictus was normally a witch cursed to turn into an animal and that they would eventually be forced to live their lives as their animal form instead of their human one. Dudley gulped at that and imagined Harry stuck in his other form, only able to change his scale colors for entertainment.
Harry asked, his voice shaking like he was much younger than his actual age.
“Oh? You don’t normally give out presents. Who’s it for then? If you give me a good reason I’ll keep it off the books.”
The boys glanced at each other quickly before asking rapid fire questions at the same time.
Dudley let out a small laugh and shook his head in agreement as his father puffed up in front of the man and shouted at him to leave. He imagined his father with a pig’s tail coming out of his pants and bouncing in the air as he waved his arms around in frustration. The intruder seemed to completely ignore his father’s display and turned to them once more with shocked wide eyes as Harry spoke. The spontaneous rip that came from his father’s pants seconds later made both he and Harry practically jump out of their skins. Dudley watched in horror as the pig tail he had just imagined in his head made its way out of his father’s jeans just like he thought it would. He felt the absence of Harry’s hand soon after and didn’t need to turn around to know he had shifted and was probably hiding in a corner somewhere.
No, no, absolutely not. He didn’t want to be a magical creature. He didn’t even really know what a horned serpent was but it didn’t sound like anything good. He just wanted to get out of this shop, get the rest of his school supplies and wait out the rest of summer so that he could learn how to do magic at Hogwarts.
. x. x. x.
He slammed the book shut and ran out of the library to reach the newly built Slytherin common room. He had to do a lot of research, he didn't know how long it would take to realize the crazy idea that shone in his mind like lights in the sky on Saint Patrick's Day. He couldn't really think clearly and ponder if what he would do would be catastrophic, if it would somehow alter the world he lived in; but morality went out the window as soon as he remembered how much he longed to see that smile again.
(See the end of the chapter for notes .)
—Precisely because I changed, everything I felt for you was in the past. Draco radiated calm with his touch, and for some reason, it didn't reach his heart. I was trapped for many years when you rejected me in first grade, and that's why I couldn't let you go ... and all this that happened made me realize that I shouldn't stay there.
-I like you.
Draco only saw Ron shrug his shoulders.
It would take maybe months to replicate it. Hermione and Ron will definitely help him — they were his best friends, he could count on them — and he has no other motivation than to think about seeing him again. He would break the rules again, even risking misrepresenting time-space as it is known.
May the existence of other alternate worlds teach them not to wish for impossible things, for Harry, at some point during his last vacation before returning to class, thought for a few moments how things would be if he had been friends with Draco since first grade.
-What?
It was a very strange loneliness; it was reminding the little eleven-year-old boy who saw and envied the very real relationship Potter had with his henchmen. It was to feel like being there and grabbing all the attention of the subject who dared to deny his friendship to someone like him. Well, at this point in the story, maybe he could understand why Harry did all this.
Nobody believed that the oldest members of Slytherin would return, they all associated that they had fled, had shut themselves up or something similar; but seeing them there, defying that fact as resounding as it was that the members of Salazar's household were not welcome, provoked in them a primal emotion that few could properly express.
Although the smile of satisfaction that was born in him when the Harry Gryffindor saw him with that air of arrogant puritan, nobody could take it away. Much less the crushing defeat he gave the pompous Gryffindors at Quidditch.
That day he went to great lengths; He woke up early, Hermione helped him dress in the best Muggle casual clothes he had in his closet - black jeans, a red plaid shirt over a black T-shirt, and his faded converse - and had arrived fifteen minutes early at the venue. agreed ... even so, time was passing too slow for her liking. For this reason, the anxiety that he felt from long before, when he could not even recognize the feelings he had for Draco, simmered inside him slowly, thinking that the other had repented, that he decided better not to attend with him, leaving him with his heart. runaway.
As they continued to talk (of simple, easy things, for the sake of not having a completely awkward journey between two so-called strangers), the train had already passed through various fields and forests, and when he thought there were just under three hours to go, Harry looked at toward the compartment door, just as Draco Malfoy passed by, without his two trusted bodyguards. After thinking about it for a second, she got up quickly, surprising Ron, and yanked the door open. Malfoy, who had drifted very little, turned with a frown.
After that, the twins continued on their way and he looked at Ron, who was staring at him. Harry simply waited until his friend settled his thoughts, so he looked out the window for a few moments before Ron spoke.
—I remember that the you of my world, used to get away from what bothered him, be it situations, places or even people. Draco was instantly uncomfortable at the mention of his alter ego, the affection in his voice was evident; and he couldn't help feeling a stab of self-loathing. I don't want to say that you are someone you are not, and much less impose something on yourself, just… I think it's the best when there is something that you don't even understand yourself. It is necessary to put distance sometimes.
Think of a man dressed from head to toe in black, greasy shoulder length hair, aquiline nose, black eyes that he is really looking into his mind, an annoyed look full of hatred-
Harry Slytherin turned his deep gaze towards Draco, who saw him surprised, curious, strange ...
"Draco's a seeker too, you idiot," he grumbled as if it were pretty obvious.
When I wrote this chapter, I felt like I wanted to scream with excitement. It's just that Harry G. started working, and honestly, he's too desperate to do things ... it was almost obvious that he was going to tell him that he liked him to see him right away.
“When you are here, you will reign over all who live and move, and you will achieve the highest honors among the immortals. There will forever be a punishment for those who insult you, those who do not try to propitiate themselves with your spirit with sacrifices, celebrating the rites piously and offering you the gifts that are proper to you ”.
Chapter 17 : Chapter XVI
The first is more difficult. It is easier to fall into madness thanks to the second.
"Then the sweetest thing I'll say is that you're wonderful." Ron lifted Hermione's hand and kissed it. And that I want to eat a piece of cake.
They both laughed a bit at that joke, since Potter has a bone that has not yet been healed seemed a miracle, because for the last few years, the Golden Boy lived on the border between Quidditch - sport with quite a few unsafe points - and quest to eliminate Voldemort and everything he stood for. Soon the laughter ceased, the silence grew between them, and the awkwardness of an encounter appeared.
"There are seven of us in all." Ron grimaced. I am the sixth in the family. Bill, the first, and Charlie, the second, have already finished Hogwarts. They are followed by Percy, then the twins, then me, and finally our little sister, Ginny. You can tell I have a very high bar. ”The redhead frowned and Harry remembered how depressed he was trying to stand out in his family.
Was the universe wrong again? Because he really did not dedicate himself to investigate, he only saw that Hermione Granger did not greet him and ran to take refuge to the only place that felt a home.
Harry thanked the taxi driver again when he helped him place his trunk in a wheelbarrow, and after paying for the ride and tipped him for the extra help, he entered King's Cross and walked slowly to platform 9¾. She wasn't going to deny that she felt a little guilty for wanting to run into the Weasley family again, and that she was going to take full advantage of Molly's solidarity to get close to Ron again; at the end of the day, the first time and thanks to being close to Harry, Mr. Weasley was almost killed by Nagini and then Fred had been killed in a battle that if Harry had been a little quicker or a little more knowledgeable could have been avoided . He shouldn't get close to them again, or Hermione for that matter, but he actually realized that he was very selfish and that, as he fought in blood and sweat to kill Voldemort strictly asking for help only when he knew he won't be able to alone, he he deserved to have his best friends by his side, although he greatly wished he wasn't as close to him as last time: he doesn't need to put them in even more danger.
"It would explain as to why Bellatrix went after them. Helping her family." Narcissas voice was wistful, and she stared at her lap.
The boys were going to go to class today so after a spot of breakfast they found their way to the defence classroom. Quirrels stutter was giving Harry a headache and Draco was struggling to keep up with what he was saying.
The smaller boy left forward on his elbow, "Why did you do it?"
Harry was eleven now. Well, nearly. Harry didn't write a reply to his letter, so Hogwarts was unaware that he had received it. So letters would come in every way possible. And now he was laying on the dirty floor of an old cabin - in the middle of the sea. Harry wasn't actually sure where it was.
The next morning, Harry decided today would be the day he confronted Ron. Tom had thanked him for letting him talk to Severus, and the book was safely tucked up in his pocket. .
Ron nodded wisely, "Makes sense I guess."
Severus nodded, "You haven't been hit since you were eight?"
Harry told Tom he wanted the boy to fall. He didn't like how he was treating him, and Tom knew that it was him, Harry had in fact killed him. He was a murderer earlier than Tom was, and that was a scary thought.
Harry was six now, and he couldn't wait to be sent to his cupboard for the night, with or without food. Tom had helped him a lot in realising who he was. And Harry new as much about Hogwarts and magic as one could without actually seeing it.
Harry's eyes lit up and he nodded, plastering a smile on his face. He skipped over towards Neville, "Hi!"
"It's normal to not understand. I don't know what will happen, but just know, I'll cover for you." Percy grinned a little, and went back to his book.
"I know what you're asking, and he didn't. He threatened it, but I like to believe he would never."
"Karkoden, really, you think I learned all this from a book? I'm a death eater child. Sort of. Now come on, we have a letter to write."
H: Thank you Tom. I promise I'll sort Zachariah out once he gets back.
T: She won't be. Narcissa has healed unimaginable things. She is a tier one healer, which is basically the most desired healer in the world. People pay millions of Galleons to have people of her stance heal their loved ones. I don't doubt that she could heal them emotionally, mentally, magically and physically. People who have been effected by dementors do not actually go insane, they just feel and act that way because the sadness is too overwhelming.
After reaching the dorm, and getting himself and Draco into pyjamas, the two sat cuddled on Harry's bed, with Mr. Teddy squished between them. It was calm, and quiet, and soon enough Draco was sleeping, again.
"It's a long story. We'll fill you in after." Harry supplied and all the adults nodded. Draco had climbed onto Lucius' lap already.
They soon entered a shop, and both relaxed, "I thought you were supposed to be brave?" The professor said, a small smirk on his face, showing he was only poking fun.
"At midnight she checks the bathrooms by the great hall. Can you get there?" After receiving an affirmative reply he continued, "So you'll just get her then. I'll be able to cover everything up." Harry rubbed the large snakes head, "Do you need any form of payment?"
"Nothing in particular. See you around!" He sped past them, but they followed. They were honestly starting to creep him out.
Harry leant down and grabbed a bag from the floor, pulling it towards the bed. "Nappies. Cloth nappies, to be exact."
As long as you feel alive once more.
However, apparently life was still pawned with him, collecting bills that were not his ... or so he wanted to believe not to accept that streak of bad luck, because having a Harry - who was not a Gryffindor - being installed by McGonagall in his room, it was like one of the worst jokes in the world.
Notes:
He didn't know what the other Harry had planned, but he knew it wasn't good.
"At last wake up, Mr. Potter," Madam Pomfrey said, entering the door, holding a small earthenware mug in her hands. He had us all worried. Here, drink this.
-Anyone there?
We read each other.
"You'll have a lot of fun, I promise."
"Just work on your damn journal and go back to your world." I do not trust you.
Cadiie arrived at Ao3: 3
When a door to his right opened, Harry looked in his direction and saw the goblin just urging him closer.
Draco rolled his eyes at the memory. A small part of his mind did wish he had the possibility of polygamy ... although that would be a very utopian world, and to be honest, he did not feel prepared to be with two Potters at the same time; And of course he agreed with Pansy and Blaise, above all. However, it was difficult for him to be able to unite the scraps of emotions within him.
Although, it could also represent your home; As captain, he had a duty to strike up a conversation with the Gryffindor Harry and find out how he is doing, exchange a few words and end with a good wish for his speedy recovery.
"Unfortunately for you" Harry pointed to a corner of the trunk, where there was a small round symbol with two horizontal parallel lines inside and a dotted line between them, carved into the wood of the trunk, "it's just a rune." It was recommended to me when I bought the trunk. If you want, I can show you how to place it; the spell is not difficult.
Summary:
"Oh sure, but he and I are a team," he replied calmly, as if nothing affected him. He does not worry because the hunters, thugs and the guardian do our job. Draco, as captain, knows that he would only have to be the last resort for the match to end.
“I don’t think you’re a monster, you know?”
“Potter, would you just let me say what I need to say?”
The boy clung tightly to Buckbeak’s neck. New waves of terror washed over him with each swing of the creature’s wings, he did not dare to open his eyes. The smell of pine and fresh water suddenly washed over him. Hesitantly, Harry opened his eyes - never ending forests surrounded him at either side, parting to make way for the river. Buckbeak dragged his claw through the water as he flew above the surface, Harry let go of the creature’s neck and let his arms stretch out with the wind. His smile radiated genuine happiness, for the first time in a long time. But perhaps it wasn’t happiness that he felt, perhaps it was relief. As they flew above the water Harry didn’t have to think about anything, what waited for him on the ground didn’t mean anything anymore. It all seemed so distant to him, so finally, Harry allowed himself to experience the moment at hand. He allowed himself to feel the air on his skin, and the water beneath him, and the unsteady beating of his heart. Harry laughed as everything seemed to be left to the wind.
“In your dreams, Potter”, said Draco with a smirk - “Um, yeah. I just wanted to tell you that”
“I just- I think you should know that I’m not who you think I am, that’s all”
“Part of the act I guess? It’s not an excuse, but I don’t know what else to do”
“Open your books to page 49!” - yelled out Hagrid.
“Look who’s talking”
“You dragged me all the way out here to tell me you’re thinking about me telling you to shove it? Seriously? That was the point!”
“Fair enough”
“Yeah because being the golden child wasn’t enough”
Against better judgement, Draco carried on - “Wait until my father hears that Dumbledore’s got this oaf teaching classes”, Crabbe and Goyle laughed - but their amusement was short lived.
“Oh yeah, terribly funny. Really witty. God this place has gone to the dogs”, interrupted Draco with a scoff. Hermione’s expression became enraged and Harry grabbed onto her arm as a silent way of saying it wasn’t worth it.
“Oh really? Because I would beg to differ, it’s pathetic really. You trailing him like a little carbon copy. Have you ever heard of a personality, Malfoy?”
“My mother. She cares for me, but I think we always bonded over fear of my father’s opinions. When I was a kid she would sometimes sleep in my room with me because she didn’t want to hear what he had to say. She’d read me books about knights and princesses, I would fall asleep in her arms. It was our safety”
Harry confronts Draco, and tension rises.
“Come on, Oliver’s the star of the team”
“Not in the ways it would matter”
“You think so?”
“It’s not hard to be worse than you”
Harry sat across from Ron on the study hall benches, “You can’t tell me you haven’t noticed that Hermione appears out of nowhere! I mean seriously, I check to see if she’s in the class - she’s not, I blink and she’s sitting right across from me! You’ve got to be joking, you’ve never wondered why that is”, Harry looked up from his textbook and leaned on the table - “Ron, have you ever considered that you may be less bothered if you didn’t think of Hermione all day, every day?”, he said in a hushed tone. Ron’s gaze darted around the room in panic - “Harry!”, he whispered. The boy laughed and shifted his weight back on the bench. Draco made his way down the steps with swiftness, in his full black attire he had almost seemed like a shadow. His shoes making an unmistakable clicking on the stone floor, the boy walked up to Harry - hesitant to stop. “Potter, we need to talk”, he said quietly. Harry didn’t look up at first, he just stared at Ron - silently asking what to do. Draco lowered his voice even more, “Please?” - his tone almost sounded desperate, ‘coward’ he thought to himself. Reluctantly Harry stood up, “what?” - he spit out. Draco took a breath of relief, “follow me”.
“Well people think you’re a lot like her, don’t they?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The three laughed, “ooooooo” - Draco smirked. Leaving his bag behind, he made his way toward Harry. The class had now gathered around the two - anticipating a fight. Draco’s gaze shifted to the sky abruptly, he was jumpy on his feet and his voice trembled - “D-d-dementor! Dementor!”. The class whirled around with a unanimous gasp, yet the Slytherins laughed. Draco ran back to the group, and after putting on their hoods, they began imitating the soul-sucking creatures - “ooooooooo”, they mocked. Hermione mocked back and led Harry away from unnecessary conflict.
“Well done, Harry!” Yelled Hagrid as he saw Buckbeak approaching the landing clearing. The moment the creature’s feet touched down on the ground Draco charged forward. “Are you joking? This is ridiculous!”, he yelled. Harry gave the boy a confused look, before Hagrid shoved him aside - “Stop! No!”, but Draco didn’t listen. Within a second the boy was on the ground, “OW!” - he yelped. Buckbeak raised himself up on his back legs and stretched out his wings to deliver another hit, but Hagrid dove in front to wave him off. The groundskeeper picked Draco up off the ground - “I have to take him to Madame Pomfrey, class dismissed!”
“Okay, why do you care so much about people’s blood status?”
“What?” - asked the boy, entirely caught off guard.
“Shut up, Malfoy” - quietly, yet forcefully said Harry, now making strides toward the group himself.
“And how exactly are we supposed to do that?” - returned Draco, in a particularly nasty tone.
“We both know that’s not true. You just don’t want to admit that you get special attention”
“You are going to be the death of me, Potter. How about this, you ask me the questions and I’ll answer with complete honesty”
“I think they’re funny” said Hermione.
“And who do I think you are?”
Chapter 2: Some Promises are Best Made Silent
Harry burst through the door of the hospital wing, making determined strides toward Malfoy’s bed. “What the hell was that, you weasel!”, he yelled - half surprised at his own aggression. Draco remained quiet, also surprised by Harry’s straight forwardness, taking the opportunity the boy carried on - “You are a spineless, pathetic excuse for a man. Look, I’m sorry your precious daddy didn’t love you enough, but you have no right to take out your own stupid insecurities on everyone around you!”, Harry took a pause to breathe, “Not accepting your friendship that day was the single best decision I have ever made in my life, I’d be damned if I became anything like you. And I don’t care what you have to say about my friends, they will never compare to you, you see they actually realize that they’re not the only bloody people in the world. You may act all tough and all knowing - but you’re nothing, Malfoy. Nothing”. Draco stared at the boy in silence, unable to grasp what he had just said - “I-I-“, he stuttered. “I don’t want to hear it, Malfoy! What could you possibly have to say? That ohhh your father is gonna hear about this? I hope he bloody does, so that he could see that he raised a bloody coward, you can’t even show basic decency to the people around him! You’re not superior, Draco. You’re not elite. You’re a sorry excuse for a person. I see right through your cheap act! You want everyone to be so scared of you, but you’re the one that’s terrified. So go on whimpering like a bloody lost puppy, and keep me, and my friends out of your filthy mouth”. The boy’s shoes were heavy on the floor as he marched off, leaving Draco practically paralyzed.
I'm sorry some chapters are so short. My writing style is wavy
"Go to bed you insufferable brat." And the door was closed on Harry's face.
And so Draco started listing everyone off, pointing to the obvious ones first, "Thas me, and mummy and daddy, and thas Sev'rus next to daddy. Next to mummy is auntie 'trix an her little boy. He doesn't have a face yet cause dunno what he looks like." He stuck his tongue out the corner of his mouth, "Thas you, next to Sev'rus."
Thomas, Dean
Draco, who was now in an older headspace and no longer so upset, decided this was the perfect time to confront Harry.
Tom had told him all about the half giant, like how he got him excluded for opening the chamber of secrets when it was in fact himself. He zoned out the entire conversation and only noticed when Hagrid held out a plate of sausages for him, which he took gratefully. Harry took the chance to look about and noticed that his entire so called family were white as a sheet. And his uncles gun was bent in a complete circle. Fascinating.
The girl, Granger, who was clearly a mudblood, wouldn't shut up. This was going to be a very long seven hour trip. Unless he lost his cool and killed the girl.
The plan was originally to have to troll find her, but the teachers caught it before it could cause any damage. So Harry just had to step in. It would mess up the whole plan, otherwise. Her cries were pitiful, really. This, of course, was only part of Harry's plan. Tom needn't know it wasn't an accident.
"Who's we?"
It was in pretty cursive writing, and harry struggled with the last word, but figured it must mean book or something alike. He tried to find one of Dudley's old pens he didn't use that Harry had stolen, or rescued as he put it, to write a reply, Aunt Petunia used to make Harry write apology letters every day when he was four, and still did now if he had nothing to do, so he was a decent writer for a five year old.
"Harry Severus Riddle," Tom was so angry he hadn't realised the name he'd used, "What have you done?"
He was quite surprised Ron, or Karkoden, changed his views so quickly.
He was sent back to his seat, and George gave a very similar statement, rushing back just as quick.
T: Now that is a tricky bit of magic. I would suggest just throwing the whole book into the cauldron, and waiting for me to form so I can remove myself from Quirrel.
It was early morning, and the three were once again in Severus' rooms. Suddenly there was a knock at the door, and Lucius stood in the hall with two ministry officials behind him, "I'm here to collect Ronald Weasley," Severus nodded and sent the boy on his way. Lucius discreetly smiled at Draco, before leading the ginger boy up to the headmaster office.
T: Over six years and you didn't notice that this diary was made in nineteen forty five?
Draco stumbled over, and Harry made quick work of pulling him onto the bed. He kissed the side of Draco's head, "I'm just being silly, okay? You've got nothing to worry about. Thank you for getting Severus."
Severus, much to Harry's confusion, placed one hand on Harry's elbow, pulling him around to the man's front. The hand let go of the elbow and in stead wrapped around his shoulders, leaving him half pressed against Severus' chest.
H: Why not? You knew that one when you turned thirteen.
"Well, I don't fancy killing Percy or his brothers. The Ravenclaw student? Although I feel like that would extend the break. I don't feel like he deserves it, either." Harry sat down on the floor, thinking things over.
"Well, find some blood, write 'the chamber has opened' on the wall, and then leave them all in suspense."
H: I suppose it could be worse.
"Sounds great. Okay so I need to kill McGonagall." Harry leaned against the big snake, running his hands over his scales.
"Tom wouldn't ask you to murder a poor eleven year old girl." His tone was bland, and Harry felt genuinely guilty for upsetting him so.
And this, my friends, is where I stopped writing. Maybe I'll pick it back up one day, maybe not. Thanks for getting this far in my absolute mess lol
Harry nodded, almost. "Death Eaters have specific times for having children. All married death eaters that could were due to have a baby in 1980. They figured this out, and realised you would be insanely strong just because of your mother, and who they assumed to be your father. They were smart. They didn't know who your godparents were if you had any, but they knew if they finally imprisoned all the death eaters, Lucius Malfoy would get away, and you'd go to live with them. They couldn't risk it, so they took you from your family."
Narcissa stood up, "Thank you, Mister Weasley. Please may you sit down with her?" He nodded and sat with her on his lap, "May someone tell me what is the matter?"
Potter, Harry
"Percy?"
He dusted himself off, and slipped out into the hallway. Luckily no one was around to notice him, and he sped away from the bathroom.
"What's got your knickers in a twist?"
After buying a few childish items for Draco, the two once again set off in search of more shops.
Harry nodded, "I'll calm myself. But I'm going to make them pay." His eyes were darker, and Tom stared into them, "I don't doubt you will, my child."
"Sweet. Who should we kill? I must admit I am rather bored."
Once in his dorm room and he had picked his bed, the overly smart boy changed quickly. When all the other boys were asleep, he heard quiet crying from Draco's bed. Harry instantly knew what it was and made his way to the blondes bed. "Hey Draco? Is it alright if I open the curtain?"
He had a small chat with the prefect and just as he was leaving he heard his name being called, "Ah! Professor Snape, before you leave may I have a moment of your time?" The too awake raven haired Slytherin asked.
He ran his fingers over a few jumpers, popping them into his basket. They were a variety of colours, mostly light. Considering Harry's other clothing, all dark, he couldn't help but think they weren't for the boy.
H: Now please teach me about Dark Magic? Please?
Lucius looked gobsmacked, surprised his little boy had this in him.
"Let's get you changed, hm?" Draco nodded, quickly shuffling over and laying on his bed. Harry laughed and made quick work of getting Draco dry, waving his complex cleaning charm over the wet garment. Harry didn't trust the house elves, and thus was very adept at cleaning charms. He could go his entire life without using any cleaning product and still be the cleanest child in Hogwarts.
Severus raised his eyebrows at one of the items - a complete suit, in pink, with a white silk shirt.
Harry nodded, looking at the scar once again, "I'll probably get a skin graft or something when I'm older. Do you reckon you could do my arm? It feels nasty."
Harry read the first three letters with ease, and eventually the last six too. Although he was severely struggling with the middle name. "Mar.. Ma'vo...Ma'volo!" He managed eventually his mouth stretching into a small smile, as his eyes glistened.
H: ...youd rather break a deranged woman out of Azkaban than break into Gringotts?
"Draco?" The tone was soft, buy soon turned harsher when he looked at the other boy, "Weasley, what is the meaning of this?"
Harry wiped his cheek just as Draco started stirring. Quickly, he jotted down,
Narcissa took to the stand, and began speaking with a clipped tone, "I was the Medi Witch asked to test Karkoden Black, previously known as Ronald Weasley, for any relations to Bellatrix LeStrange. The test came back positive, proving that someone was working at fault. Molly reacted in a violent way, which lead to Ginny Weasley coming into mine and my husband's emergency care."
This set off alarming bells in both the Malfoys heads, but it just made Molly angrier,
"We got dressed in our nice clothes for nothing, hm?" Draco nodded, and kicked his shoes off. He curled up against Harry, eyes wide with wonder. Harry awkwardly kissed his head, and traced a finger down his cheek,
H: You're a real person?
"He simply didn't know, I suppose. The other pieces must of realised that I was removed and assumed I'd died. I'm insane on my own, but with the rest of my soul I shall be normal again. Lady Magic did not destroy me, thankfully. I can hear bits and pieces, but the diary tom blocked all contact with other soul pieces, unless he was talking to them. He blocked me, but as he thought I was dead it wasnt as strong as the others. I know little bits."
"Alright with the cursing, are we? You did fine, great actually. I owe you my life. Now, how did you get that good?" Harry was smirking, and Draco almost wanted to slap it off his face.
T: Yes child. And have you never heard of Hogwarts, how old are you?
"You don't know anything, get out!" Still Severus refused to budge, and Harry reached for his wand, pointing it at his professor.
After a while of silence Draco just blurted it all, "I miss home, and I'm scared, and usually when I'm scared father will sleep in my bed with me and promise its all okay and he doesn't get mad when I wet the bed and have my teddy but everything's gone and I want to go home." He teared up even more, angrily wiping at his eyes, and Harry grabbed his wrist lightly, "Don't do that, you'll hurt yourself." The smaller boy let his hands fall to his lap. Harry was a good size now, possibly tall for his age and he snuck food quite easily so his stomach was back to normal. And the fact Harry was bigger than Malfoy was quite adorable.
Ron nodded, and the two sat writing the letter.
"That's understandable. Now, it's nearly dinner time. What do you say we see where Harry and Neville have gotten to, hm? Also, Karkoden you are going to be resorted by Professor Snape."
The two students sat in the library for a while, reading.
"Mr. Evans, please lower your wand," he started and after Harry did so he continued, "The headmaster has agreed for me to take you on a trip to London. I needed to get some things, so I offered to take you. I do hope that is satisfactory."
At this Harry looked up at Quirrel, who was bent over the table in a way so nobody could see his face. Harry assumed it was because Tom was fronting.
Both boys nodded, Percy speaking first, "She hit me- but I always assumed I was taking the brunt for everyone else. She would get angry at the twins, and then hit me. All the emotional stuff was there too."
He said, forgetting the capital 'H'
"He hasn't. He wouldn't know how to without my help."
Karkoden had pulled some chocolate from his pocket and was nibbling away, partially blocking out the conversation.
Going to the ice cream shop was the best part of the day. All seven children sat around the largest table, the three adults sitting on one slightly to the left. Percy had vanilla, the twins shared a large bowl of cookies and cream, Harry had chocolate mint, Draco with salted caramel. Karkoden had butterscotch, Ginny simply having banana. All in all, a good meal.
Draco, soon enough, was told by Harry to stop paying attention because it was stressing him out so. Harry handed Draco a few sheets of plain paper and a box of crayons, while he took notes for the both of them.
Oh, the irony.
And this boy was seven.
Once all was dealt with and they had dropped Piers home, and they reached home, Harry was thrown away, with a smirk playing at his lips. He told all to Tom, and went to sleep.
"What are you doing?" Tom hissed, but Harry nonchalantly waved his hand at him, effectively silencing him. Once Harry was done being stupid he dragged himself and Tom out of the room, locking it again.
"Bella? Bella! Don't you dare go to sleep! Young lady! You're worse than Tom!" With that, Harry huffed and turned on his side for some much needed rest.
"No, why,"
T: I think that would be a lovely idea. Have you perhaps got and clues as to who it may be?
T: Eventually she stopped screaming and collapsed. We, naturally, rushed over to see if she was okay, but she was inconsolable. We later found out that whoever had her baby had blocked his magical bond, which filled her with a little but of hope because that meant they weren't going to kill him, and possibly get adopted out. But then a new craze set in, and that's when she lost her first ounce of sanity. Someone had her baby and she had to find out who and get him back. But we never found him.
Ron shrugged to that, "Oh it's alright. My mum does that too. Pisses me off. It always seems like she targets me, you know?"
H: Night Tom.
Malone, Roger
D: Yeah, I'm very tired.
"I'm afraid not, but we can talk in a more private place with less watchers after the hearing. Now, she withheld food, locked you away and hit you. Is there anything else you would be comfortable sharing?"
He puffed up his chest, clearing his throat, "And who are you?"
Draco fiddled with his shoes, finally getting them on. Happy that Harry wouldn't see him leaving, he trudged out the room. He was on a mission.
T: Yes, I shall name you my son. I shall kill Harry Potter and request my Son attend Hogwarts. With a blood adoption, you shall look like me, instead of that worthless James Potter.
Harry was eleven now, and would be leaving for Hogwarts in a matter of days. Tom was disgusted by Hagrids entrance, and due to Hagrid, Harry had had a terrible punishment. That whipping and carving of the skin was the first punishment since he was seven to make him shed a tear.
T: Goodnight my child.
"Merlin, this boy sleeps more than a bloody cat." He mused to himself quietly,  but was still glad of his quiet time to talk to Tom.
Harry worked on channeling magic to the Horcrux, already going back on his earlier word, while tears gathered in his eyes. He had to make this believable.
Both children nodded, and with shaking hands, they both sliced into their palms. Karkoden was finished first, and so got his potion, and Ginny got hers immediately after.
"I have my ways. Why?" The green eyed boy made eye contact, but the dark man avoided his gaze.
Draco spent most of the time relaxing, and Harry spent the time taking in Draco's complete beauty. He had never seen anyone as beautiful.
"We are a united house, do not expect anything from any of the other houses. They see you no better than the scum on the bottom of their shoe. We maintain calm in the public eye, any quarrels between dorm mates must be sorted and kept within your dorm rooms, or, by extension, the common room. There are only three rules within Slytherin, one which I have already covered. One, is we stick together, two is we must maintain the highest spots and three is that we dong get caught. Is that clear?" The girl got no reply, so she nodded. "Good. I shall hand you over to Professor Snape."
The small boy nodded, "He called my hair nice!"
H: Of course, Professor Riddle.
"I believe you call me... Tom? Yes, that is my name. Although I do have a feeling you also call me something beginning with a Q. The lines a bit messed up."
Ron's was overwhelmed, "They ripped me from my mother for what? Because she was insane?"
T: Fine, the Blood-boiling curse. The incarnation is 'Krljuca'
His Aunt Petunia was getting wearier of him by the day, she had even stopped making him do chores and doing them herself, just to save herself from seeing him. He preferred his cupboard anyways.
S: You've put me through more hell being dead. Will you ever come back?
H: I've killed someone before.
Harry quickly soothed him before continuing, "Draco, I can't help but notice, you are very," he paused for a second before deciding on his phrasing, "childlike. Yet, when we originally met, and, before the first night, you seemed very mature. Possibly too mature for your age."
He stripped as he was walking into the bathroom, and didn't bother locking the door. No one was here besides Draco, and there was no reason to lock him out.
That was one thought as Harry woke up in a wet bed, yet again. "Draco, darling, wake up." He murmured, and the smaller boy did, tears gathering and lip trembling once he was aware of his surroundings. He stuttered out many versions of sorry, and Harry soothed him.
The man had also acquired the boys last name and then went on to explain how his parents actually died and what happened. Harry wasn't sure whether he wanted to talk to Tom after that, but the man promised as long as Harry didn't end up becoming Dumbledore's pawn, he wouldn't try to kill him.
"Professor Snape?" He asked, tone a little softer.
Harry shook his head; "No. Why are you here? How?"
Finch-Fletchley, Justin
"Told us what?" Tom was clearly fronting now, his voice worried but also stern.
"I made a deal with Lord Voldemort. I need your help." He hoped it worked, and thankfully it did.
The information was a little much for Harry and he felt a tear roll down his cheek, much to his dismay.
Cornfoot, Stephen
Well, it wasn't really Tom.
Cornfoot, Stephen
"He always did put writing anything to the back of his mind, it's not purposeful. Come along, should we head to the library?" Percy held out his hand; despite Harry acting older, the ginger boy still treated him like a child. Harry wasn't averse to it, and almost liked it.
Either way, Snape was walking back up to fight the troll. Harry let out a sigh of relief and pulled Tom from the room behind him.
"What the fuck was that?" He hissed to him in the snake tongue. He received a confused look in return. Harry left for the Slytherin dungeons, gripping his diary with white knuckles.
"You mentioned Tom yesterday, on a tense that meant you have contact with him, and what you insinuated makes me believe it was not a child from your home town."
While Ron was dealing with all the new information, Harry pulled out his diary.
Eventually Harry gave up and put Draco in bed with him. Draco soon fell asleep after that, and they both got a decent night's sleep, well, for the most part.
Narcissa couldn't help but snicker, "I think he's rather following in Severus', my lord."
Harry took strides with Draco skipping alongside him, and soon they were sitting down to eat with variations of fruit on their plates. Draco was more unsophisticated than his taller friend, but Harry thought it cute anyway.
"He's following in his father's footsteps, Lucius," Tom drawled.
T: Harry? Do you understand them?
Harry was hoping they would leave him locked in his cupboard after the news of Mrs. Figg's broken leg, but, however be it, Lady Luck was not on his side today. His uncle didn't believe him to be able to be left home alone. His aunt was too afraid to try and fight against her husband. Harry was used to it honestly.
"Of course professor. I would greatly appreciate you talking with the headmaster." He gave the teacher a pearly white grin, and turned on his heel, Draco following suit.
"Well, yes."
D: Why did you do it? The killings, and such.
The Malfoys were awarded custody of Karkoden, and Narcissa started the cleansing soon after. He was bedridden for two weeks, which brought us to now. Ginny had gone into emergency care with the Malfoys, and they planned on talking to her about adoption. The twins and Percy were so far undecided.
"Why aren't we learning about what's in the book?"
During this time Harry spoke to Tom,
T: Yes you are, my child. When will you fight back?
He also conversed with Narcissa regularly, as to make sure Ginny was okay. Narcissa did invite him and Harry for Christmas, but both declined. Percy was still struggling with the new terms, and he didn't want to be out in the world. Harry just preferred to stay at Hogwarts.
Harry once again agreed, before speaking up once again, "Did Dumbledore not ask my guardians permission?"
H: That's how old you are??
The boy nodded, and all three set out to find their friends.
"Belladonna?" He hissed, and the rustling stopped, "You speak the tongue of the snake, young one?"
Once he was rounded a corner and gone, Severus turned his attention back to the small blonde boy now clutching his robe, and pulled him into his office.
Tom was enraged when one night Harry was in so much pain that Tom could feel it. He had politely forced the boy to tell him, and that's when he told him how to control his accidental magic, and how to stand up for himself the muggle way.
"We have viewed the evidence, now it is time to take a vote." After a few minutes of shuffling, she was announced guilty on all charges. She was dragged away kicking and screaming.
He looked up and half nodded at the man before going to eat his food and urging Draco to eat his.
Mr. Ollivander creeped Harry out quite a bit, and he wanted to leave as soon as possible. Turned out he had the brother wand to Lord Voldemort. Who in fact was Tom. He found that quite amusing. Hagrid has also picked something up from Gringotts, he decided to tell Tom and Bellona about it later.
He had his basket full, when the women's section caught his eye. He took a mosey over, leaving Severus a little confused, but he didn't mind none the less.
H: My aggression? Never.
At approximately 2 am, after the boy awoke from nightmares and the sheer pain of his injuries, he found an old tattered book on his bed, centimetres from his head. He picked it up as cautiously as a five year old could and opened it, but it was blank.
After getting over his shock, the professor led the student out with card and galleon pouch in hand.
It was Dudley's birthday, hence the extravagant meal, and his Uncle being home.
Just when Dumbledore went to reply, Harry turned to stalk from the hall before turning towards Slytherin table and ushering Draco up, whispering in his ear. Draco's face lit up at whatever he said, and he hurriedly got up. The two, or rather Harry, speed walked out, with Draco trailing slightly behind holding Harry's hand. At one point Draco even skipped to keep up, ignoring the looks because he knew, that, no matter what, Harry would protect him.
Draco had no idea what was going on and just hid behind Harry.
Now, Harry was laying in bed, focused on the ceiling. Percy had a night off, and so he was left with nothing to do.
"Upon further examination in Severus Snapes office, all three children, Percy Weasley included, showed severe signs of abuse, and their medical test came back and furthering the proof. After mental evaluations on the younger two, Ginny is deeply traumatised. I have all the medical forms and memories to show her behaviour, and how concerning it is. I also am willing to give memories of Mrs Weasley trying to physically attack me."
Harry, too tired to fight with obnoxious Gryffindors, shoved past them and continued down the hall. An annoyed, "Oi! Watch where you're going mate!" Was yelled after them but Harry honestly didn't care.
"What's that? You always liked holding my hand." Percy let go, smiling again.
Harry smiled at the concern, "Don't worry Sir, all is well and I am safe. Now," he redirected his attention to Draco, "let's go back to our dorm, shall we?"
T: Okay, there may be a Slytherin chamber that houses a basilisk. He's friend's and won't attack unless a parselmouth instructs him so.
"Hermione Granger," the old woman continued, a single tear on her cheek, "it appears that the troll found her. We are all in sorrow at our loss, and children are welcome to go home until the legalities have been dealt with. If you wish to stay, counseling will be available and classes will be cancelled."
T: That's understandable. Do you perhaps know about Harry's morning?
Harry excused himself, and Tom let him go with a comment to not kill the headmaster. Harry grinned and said he was going to get Belladonna.
Draco giggled abruptly causing Harry to smile, before replying.
"So, who do you think is going next out of us two?" Fred asked, mouth half full of sandwich, whilst motioning to his twin.
D: That sounds funny. And it doesnt surprise me much either. But I have a question, if you dont mind?
H: Alright, dad.
Thirty more chapters til we reach my stop point
T: Which would be?
Percy couldn't help but smile; he loved the childish joy that filled the young boy.
"One for me and one for you. Well, I got them for Tom, but really, is there much difference?"
Harry snapped the book shut and looked up at Snape, who was looking generally displeased with the world.
Harry had in fact spoke to Hagrid, and found out the only way to calm Fluffy was to play music. So Harry did that when Tom, now fronting looked around. He lifted the hatch, and saw the bottom was pitch black. Just as he came back up to tell Harry he couldn't see anything, they heard footsteps approaching, and quickly.
The two older boys got to pick, not that Harry cared. They went everywhere when Dudley suddenly goes, "Mummy, daddy, I want to see the snakes! Now!" And with a few strange glances, the five made their way to the reptilian area of the zoo, much to Harry's delight.
"Prove yourself." The tone was sharp, and he stood straight.
"No. I like your hair." Draco replied, one hand gripped onto The older boys robes, skipping along.
"Snape. He berates us for not getting something perfect, but gives his Slytherins extra lessons." He was slumped, and Harry chuckled a little bit.
Harry was eager, "His would I do that?"
"Mister Evans, may I have a word?"
Severus headed off to find the twins, and Tom pulled Harry aside. The two had been working on opening the bond, so Tom may be able to watch through Harry's eyes.
Harry tensed, "Well, I may have slipped up. Yes, I have contact with the Tom we both know. It is nothing bad, and I do not wish to discuss it further.
H: No, it's someone else. I do believe you'll enjoy it so.
T: Since thirty seconds ago, now sleep. I have thinking to do. Coming back to full health - with a body - may be easier than expected.
But when Harry had come home one uneventful day, did Tom realise something.
"I got a new chess board! And a really nice blanket, and some books that are easier to read. And a new wand, and clothes, and everything!"
Harry was nine now, and his aunt was sufficiently terrified of the boy. Harry didn't know why, he was never bad. Just scared Dudley's friends a bit. And the kids at school.
"Can you go to sleep for me? You need it." Harry complied, nodding off quickly. He was tucked up on the couch, when Tom disappeared and Quirrel slumped against the sofa.
Severus sighed, "I will talk with professor Dumbledore. You may need permission from your guardians, and will need to be escorted."
Malfoy, Draco
"You mentioned an abusive household?"
He replied after the story had been told.
“No. But you have to stop trying to be like him, it’s gonna eat you alive one of these days”
Neville had finally managed to get his book shut, however not before it tore his clothing to shreds. “You’re supposed to stroke it” advised Ron as he pat the boy on the back.
“Maybe, maybe not. I suppose I’ll never really know, no matter how everyone treats me, I’ll always feel they say they love me because they feel like they have to”
“People tell me I remind them of my mother. And that hurts as much as it comforts, I wish I got to know her”
“I know someone like you, and he never stopped to question if what he was raised to do was right. I don’t think he’ll ever know life outside of having everything his way. But I don’t think anything is going your way, is it?”
“Where are you taking me?”, asked Harry as the two walked down an empty hall. Draco looked over his shoulder to answer the boy - “There’s an empty classroom no one uses down this way. I came across it last year when I needed somewhere to hide when I skipped class, a marvelous discovery - if you ask me”. Harry rolled his eyes at Draco’s returning arrogance,  but didn’t say anything further - deciding it was best to let the situation play itself out. “In here”, said Draco - holding a door open for Harry. The inside of the classroom was dark and stuffy, luggage cases were piled on top most of the furniture, except for a desk and a few chairs. Draco bolted the door shut behind himself and walked over to the empty table, quickly lifting himself up and sitting on it cross legged. Harry leaned on a drawer unit and crossed his arms, assuming a very stand-offish demeanor, “What am I doing here, Malfoy?”, he asked quietly.
“Are you deaf, Potter?”
“Would you two quit!”, dismissing Hermione’s remark, Ron looked at Harry - “I think those extra classes are getting to her”. Harry chuckled but immediately dropped his expression when he noticed the death-glare Hermione was giving him, “sorry” he muttered. The group made their way down the hill and into the forest, sunshine penetrated through the leaves - giving the arena a heavenly, light green, glow. Most of the class was already gathered beneath the trees, a group of Slytherins was huddled around Draco, they were laughing about something.
“I suppose it would only be fair”
“Oh?”
This is kind of a set up chapter, and I’m having a little bit of writers block so forgive the odd pacing for now. I’m writing this fic just to prove that it’s possible to have a realistic enemies to lovers Drarry narrative, without it being insanely toxic, so I hope you enjoy this!
