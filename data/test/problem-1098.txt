“Draco,” Harry breathed, shoving his wand into his pocket and then hurrying towards him. “Draco, are you hurt? Are you alright?” He must have forgotten that Daphne was there, because he gripped Draco’s arms, checking him over, before pulling him into a suffocating embrace.
“Fuck, your mouth is so good,” Draco said, staring down at him. “I knew all these years your mouth must be good for something. Use your tongue, go on.”
“Lay down.” Again, Draco meant to comply, but he had barely started to shift over when Potter pushed him down and climbed on top of him. As they kissed, it suddenly occurred to Draco how strange their life was—how strange that outside this house, a war was raging, and yet here in this room they had the time to kiss each other leisurely, to bask in each other’s warmth, to twist and turn together in the sheets night after night.
“Draco,” Pansy said suddenly, reaching out to grip his arm. “Theo said he needs your CV, for that job application. Have you written it yet?”
Harry held Draco’s hands as he cried. Though his chest hurt, he pressed on. “There were times when they tried to force me to do it. I—I know that one time, in the bathroom, I fucking…I was scared. I really thought he was going to kill me. I
Even though he was embarrassed, Draco forced his eyes up to meet Harry’s. Draco reminded his heart, once again, to settle down, to resist bruising his ribs as it pounded in his chest. He needed to get a grip. But it was becoming difficult to ignore the feel of Harry’s knee against his leg, the pout of his lips as he took Draco in. They stayed like that for one moment, gauging the other’s reaction, until finally, Harry said, “I think I’m going to kiss you.”
With a sort of grim resolution, he had decided that this was his lot to bear—the fear, the apprehension, the restlessness that gripped him every so often. And it was almost as though that sense of acceptance had lightened the load. He knew, now, that the shrill voice screaming at him in panic was a liar—he was not in danger, he was not doomed, everything would be alright. There was still good to be found in this world. Even in a world where people like Colin Creevey died, and where Harry’s godson, Teddy Lupin, would grow up without his parents, and where George Weasley was now forced to live without his twin brother, there was still some good. There was good in the sound of Harry’s voice, rumbling softly as he read through his friends’ letters. There was good in Harry’s calloused hands, rubbing his back whenever he woke from a nightmare. There was good in Harry’s eyes, following him protectively wherever he went.
“Oh, would you quit it?” Her tone was brusque, but there was a little smile on her face as she turned her chair to face him properly. “It’s so strange when you get weepy.”
Just as he was about to work up the courage to remove the stupid cloak, Harry pulled away. Draco instantly reached out for him, unwilling to let go of that soothing warmth, but Harry didn’t stray far; he sat atop Draco, shaking his head. Draco whined and tried to drag him down, but Harry resisted.
They walked back to the castle in silence, Pansy gripping his arm tightly. It had finally started to rain. Thick raindrops dripped down on them; they slipped down Draco’s brow, his cheeks. Neither of them bothered to conjure an umbrella, nor did they pick up the pace as they traipsed down the path.
“No. Just locked me in the cupboard. And then locked me in the bedroom. They didn’t really talk to me much, to be honest. I sort of just stayed out of their way. Except Dudley…he’d come and find me whenever he was bored. Him and his friends would take turns punching me sometimes. It got better once I went to Hogwarts, though. He was scared of me when he found out I could do magic.”
“It’s a shame,” Blaise said, sighing dramatically. “Slytherin are going to be absolute rubbish without you.”
“Alright,” Pansy said, pulling back out her magazine. “Skip the dinner. Fine. I’ll manage on my own. But you’re coming to the party next weekend, and that’s final.”
Draco drew out his wand, steeling himself. He glanced over at Harry, who gave him an encouraging smile. “
Unable to argue, Draco sat up and pulled it on. It was about as baggy on him as it had been on Harry, but it was warm. And, he thought vaguely to himself as he lay back down, it smelled of clean sheets and soap.
Harry shifted, and his leg came to rest against Draco’s. “Check your Mark. Does it look any different?”
happened,” Draco insisted. “We talk sometimes. He’s alright. He’s not as much of a prat as he used to be.”
Slughorn sighed, leaning back into his chair. “I suppose…” He looked away, gazing at a painting of a pastoral scene. “I understand that you need your N.E.W.T.s. Perhaps a tutor?” Slughorn glanced over and, at the sight of Draco’s face, said, “Never mind, then. It was only a thought. Well, I’ll be waiting for an improvement. Otherwise, we may have to discuss again…”
Draco winced as Potter’s wand suddenly came alight. “Fuck off, Potter,” he growled, throwing an arm over his eyes.
Draco could have sworn there was a bitter hint to Potter’s voice, but he didn’t have time to ask about it. He flew out the door, bound down the stairs, and threw himself out of the portrait hole. Mercifully, the corridor was empty. He all but ran down the labyrinth of stairs. At first, he planned to head for the Slytherin common room, but that was likely where the other eighth-year Slytherins would go, and he had no interest in being interrogated by them. Instead, Draco made his way to the Owlery. As he traipsed through Hogwarts, the sounds of students talking and laughing slowly filling the air, he thought back on what he and Potter had just done. The details were hazy. He felt as though the events of the last hour had been so momentous, so beyond what he had ever imagined, that his mind was still working to process everything. And, as he walked further and further away from the Gryffindor common room, his anxiety returned with a vengeance.
Draco forced himself to take a deep, steadying breath. This was ridiculous. “I don’t know. Daphne asked me to come. She’s started seeing Dean Thomas…and she wanted me there, in case the others…” He shook his head.
“Yeah?” Harry smirked, enjoying that. He straddled Draco’s lap. “Want to show up at breakfast tomorrow and have everyone know you’re mine?”
Their bickering followed him as he rushed out of the hall. In truth, Draco didn’t have a letter to send, but he absolutely did not feel like discussing his father. The very mention of him brought up a fresh tidal wave of anxiety that lapped at him fiercely as he climbed the stairs to the Arithmancy classroom. By the time he pushed into the cold, stone room, his forehead was damp with sweat, and he doubted very much that it was from the climb. He felt shaky, uneasy, as though a flashback was about to pounce on him from some angle that he couldn’t detect. To give himself something to do, Draco pulled out his quill, an inkpot, and a fresh foot of parchment.
She said nothing as they pushed through the oak door and into the evening air. A group of Hufflepuffs stood huddled by the entrance, playing Gobstones. Pansy dragged him down the path to the lake.
Harry, it turned out, had a knack for wrapping presents. Granger had left them with a colorful assortment of bows, ribbons, and paper. They spent what was, on the whole, a very enjoyable afternoon in the Gryffindor common room, wrapping gifts and drinking hot cocoa. For Weasley, Harry had picked out several bright Cannons shirts, each one louder and more obnoxious than the last, along with a box full of sweets from Honeydukes. Granger was to receive a more subdued present—a thick book on Arithmancy, signed by one of her favourite authors. They pretended to scuffle as Draco nearly pulled his gift for Harry out of his satchel and Harry tried to reach for it, which ended up with both of them on the sofa and Draco in Harry’s lap. He had just convinced Harry to unbutton most of his shirt, and had nearly summoned up the courage to try to pull off Harry’s jumper, when there came a sharp tapping sound at the window.
This time, he did retch. Draco just managed to drag himself off the crimson blanket before he vomited into the grass. He hated that Potter was there, and he hated himself for not being able to stop. As dry heaves racked his body, he felt Potter’s hand on his back; he was muttering to him softly, although Draco couldn’t hear what he was saying.
“Your brother, Ron,” Lavender said suddenly. “Bill. He came to see me, at St. Mungo’s. He told me everything would be alright, you know, that I could live a normal life.”
Potter was already standing, used to their routine by now. When Draco remained on the blanket, cradling his head in his hands, he could feel Potter dawdling.
“Potter.” Now that he was here, Draco had no idea what to say or do. He shoved his hands into his pockets.
“I don’t know,” he admitted. “I don’t know what’s going to happen. I never even had the chance to warn him before Nott interrupted us. So…I don’t know.”
He wasn’t surprised when a deafening roar filled his ears. Uncomfortably aware of his pulse as it galloped away, Draco only just managed to stumble back to his bed. Leaning over the sheets, he groaned as an awful vision burst before him: the Dark Lord’s wand against his arm, ripping through his skin, his flesh curdling as thick plumes of steam escaped the wound. He was screaming, and it
I can guarantee you he’s up to something. Why doesn’t he just ask Granger? You’re telling me there’s no one else at Hogwarts who can teach him? Why you of all people?”
“I bet it was Boot or Goldstein,” Nott declared. “You were all buddies at the Three Broomsticks, weren’t you?” Zabini sniggered, which seemed to only encourage Nott further. “Had them both at once, did you?”
Draco took out his wand and, slowing tracing a pattern, started to suck the fumes out of the air. “Have you got the recipe?”
“I know I didn’t have the grades to sit my Potions N.E.W.T.,” she went on, “but he said he might have a few connections…Slughorn of all people should be able to manage something, right?”
As the others brought their toads to the box on McGonagall’s desk, Draco hastily slipped his mouse into his cloak pocket. He looked over at Blaise and Pansy—they were still discussing their plans for the summer holidays. Before they could notice him, Draco grabbed his satchel and hurried out into the corridor. He made his way to the entrance hall, taking the little mouse out of his pocket as he stepped outside.
“’Cause I kept looking over at you,” he muttered. “Kept thinking of you. Kept thinking of what I want to do to you.”
Draco blanched. If it weren’t for the strange look on Harry’s face, he would have thought he’d misheard. He didn’t know how to react to the flighty, shaky feeling coursing through him, and his disorientation made him irritable. “Go on, then,” he heard himself saying. “Get it over with, if it’s so important to you.”
“Forget about that,” said Draco. “I’m sure…I’m sure it was funny. I would’ve laughed if it was someone else.”
Potter had dragged off his pyjama bottoms and was now pulling down Draco’s. They caught around his ankles for a second, and Potter laughed before casting them aside. He was in an oddly good mood tonight. That usually meant Draco was going to suffer in the best way possible.
Draco tried to tell himself that Pansy was only commenting on their public display of affection. Acting as though he couldn’t hear her, he started to tidy up their workspace.
He was right: Pansy and Blaise were running towards them. As Draco's fear evaporated, he found the sight to be quite comical. Pansy was waving her arms, shouting something he couldn’t hear, while Blaise lagged behind her. Baffled, Draco glided down towards them.
Harry had sped off to circle the pitch. There were angry boos from the Slytherins as Peakes swung a Bludger towards Baddock so forcefully that he was nearly thrown off his broom.
“I’m fine,” he muttered. In the bright light of the entrance hall, he felt exposed, as though all of his thoughts were written plain across his face for anyone to read. “I’m just tired.”
“If you care about me, then let me do this,” he said in a voice that he hoped would brook no argument. At the furious look on her face, Draco said more gently, “Potter’s the one helping me. You know how he is. I doubt he’d be doing this if he thought I’d get hurt. It’s going to be
“I ate a lot at lunch,” he lied. “Anyway, I’ve got a Potions essay to finish for tomorrow. See you.”
and yet obstructed by several layers of clothes. He wanted to see Potter, see all of him, more desperately than ever. But before he could complain again, Potter was licking down his stomach, shifting so that he sat on Draco’s legs. Draco trailed his hands back to Potter’s hair, tugging whenever he did something he liked: dipped his tongue across the contours of his hips, rubbed his hands along his thighs, sucked hard on the space just below his navel.
Draco stared at his mother. He couldn’t discern whether she was being polite simply to avoid spoiling Mrs. Zabini’s dinner, or because she wanted to watch her step around Harry. Regardless, he was grateful to her.
he thought scathingly. Potter himself had fainted all over the castle in third year. But that had been because of the Dementors, he knew. And after the events of the war, he could scarcely stand to be around them, either. What was his excuse, then? He had none. He was just weak. Pathetic. Feeling very small, he pushed through the crowd and followed Blaise and Pansy into the entrance hall.
Harry crawled onto Draco and then kissed him again, kissed him with an intensity that left Draco dizzy. His hands strayed to the bottom of Draco’s shirt, and then pushed up under the fabric. He shuddered as the calloused fingers trailed along his stomach, coming up to brush against his sides. Wanting to feel more, Draco sat up and pulled his shirt off over his head. The way Harry looked at him set his heart to staggering. But he wanted to feel him, too, and so Draco tugged at Harry’s jumper. Finally, he relented, sitting up and pulling it off, along with the shirt underneath. At the sight of him, Draco couldn’t wait for Harry to ease himself back down; he pushed up and caught Harry in a kiss, taking his fill as he explored the bare expanse of his shoulders, the contours of his chest.
“We heard what she did at the Battle, Draco. She was looking for you. She was scared. And she lied to V-Voldemort.” Draco looked up in surprise; Pansy almost never managed to utter his name. Emboldened, Pansy said, “She lied for
“Are you alright, Mr. Malfoy?” Shacklebolt asked quietly, crouching down so that they were face-to-face.
“Why do you let her bother you?” Draco asked suddenly. Daphne looked up at him, surprised. “What does it matter what she says? You’re of age, aren’t you? Tell her to sod off.”
Draco smirked. “Probably. We’ve never really talked about it. We haven’t talked about much of anything, since…”
Draco refused to let her see his gratitude at her remarks. Instead, he grimaced and said, “Let’s go. Potter will be busy with his admirers for ages.”
“Right,” Potter called to get their attention. “That was a good effort. But it looks like we have a long way to go with Transfiguration. Let’s focus on that for the next few weeks, yeah?”
In a desperate voice, he whined, “Make me come. Want to come. Want to feel you in me. Please, Draco, please.”
After a moment of silence, Granger tried again: “So, Malfoy—D-Draco—what do you think of Hufflepuff’s odds? Slytherin…Slytherin played very well against Gryffindor last match.” Weasley looked as though he had just swallowed a slug.
“It’s where you grew up, isn’t it?” Harry asked. “It’s only for one night. Your mother’s not going to murder me on the spot.”
But Theo went on: “Draco’s never willing to see anyone as an equal—have you ever noticed? He’s only ever known how to look up or down at people. He's spent the last few years being bossed around by You-Know-Who, and otherwise he fancies himself superior to everyone else.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “I don’t know. What do you want me to say? My father told me to get closer to him. I tried. It didn’t work out.”
“I’m a bit tired,” he said in a low voice, praying her friends wouldn’t hear. “I thought we could go home.”
Before he could change his mind, Draco signed the letter and called Callidus. Still ruffled, he hopped over and held out his leg, though he wouldn’t look Draco’s way. He was too well-trained to refuse him, but he showed his displeasure with the sharp click he gave before taking off. Well, that was done. Draco suddenly remembered that the Ministry was reading his parents’ mail, and the thought made him smile. Which poor Ministry official would be assigned to read that letter? And what would they make of it? Perhaps they would think it was some strange code. Good, let them stew over it.
“Well.” Draco tried to keep his tone as neutral as possible as he said, “You could stay here with me. At Hogwarts.”
“Draco.” At the sincerity in Harry’s voice, Draco turned to meet his eyes. “Please. Do it for me. At least warn him, so he can be prepared. Otherwise, I’m afraid you’ll never forgive yourself.”
As though sensing his predicament, Blaise said quietly, “You’ve been meeting since the start of term. To get rid of your Mark.”
Shacklebolt took a moment to check over Draco’s father before rising to his feet. “Madam Webb,” he said in his deep, slow voice. “Would you please explain what is happening here?”
Draco didn’t hear Pansy’s response as a wave of laughter erupted at the other end of the classroom. Looking up, Draco saw Potter surrounded by his usual entourage. Finnigan had managed to turn his toad into what looked like a beaver. The enormous rodent launched itself onto the floor, darting through people’s legs as it made for the door. Potter, Weasley, and Thomas howled as Granger hastily transfigured it back into a toad.
Predictably, Harry was livid. It was possibly the angriest Draco had ever seen him—storming around the courtyard, face red, fuming as Draco recounted the events of the last half hour. Harry insisted that they go to McGonagall at once, or perhaps even the Ministry, but Draco emphatically refused.
“Right,” he said in a dull voice. “Well, I’m sorry it’s so difficult for you, trying not to behave like a prat.”
Harry’s hand twitched as though he was going to reach out to him. He must have thought better of it, because instead he moved to flip through his textbook, a grim look on his face. Out of the corner of his mouth, he said, “I’ll ask Hermione for another one of those healing potions.”
?” Harry looked as bewildered as he felt. Draco wondered if perhaps news had gotten out about their relationship. That wouldn't be so bad, he decided.
“What?” Theo exchanged a surprised look with Lavender. “That’s…that’s not fair. You’re not leaving, are you?”
“Hermione will be fine, you saw her letter,” Harry said. “Ron…er…I hope Hermione’s been working on him over Christmas. I thought we could all play a game of Quidditch together, once they get back. Maybe you could convince the Slytherins to let Ron block a few goals.”
Winky squealed with excitement, wrapping the scarf around her neck so tightly that Draco feared she might suffocate.
But then he would catch Potter staring at him, that intense, serious stare, and he was forced to accept that it
“Would you stop it?” Harry took Draco’s face in his hands again. “You’re brilliant. Wherever you work, they'll be lucky to have you. And anyway, I’m the Chosen One, aren’t I? The Boy Who Lived Twice? We’ll use that rubbish if we have to.”
“You!” Weasley growled. “How the hell can you show your face here?” Granger was at Weasley’s side, her face red as she tugged on his arm.
“Fuck, look at you,” Harry said, his voice filled with awe. “I could watch you all day, like this. Fucking yourself on my fingers.”
He didn’t expect it when Harry shifted and wrapped his hand around his cock. “Oh, God.” He thrust into Harry’s fist, taken by his careless rhythm as he seemed to lose himself. “Fuck, you’re good.
"If it was my parents, it might have been different,” Harry said quietly. “Or Ron…or Hermione…or…” He looked down, embarrassed.
Potter took a step forward. “Do you ever feel like you’re so overwhelmed, so anxious, that you can’t even breathe? Like the whole world’s stopped and you feel like you’re going to die?”
Draco refused to fly, but he agreed to watch. It was too late and too dark out to practice with a real Snitch, but they found a bag of golf balls in the broomshed, and—after Harry took ten minutes to explain to Draco what golf was—he sat in the stands and threw them for Harry to catch. That proved too easy, so he began to fling them with magic, laughing as Harry pulled off several stunts as he raced around the pitch.
Draco shook his head, but that only caused him to feel even more nauseous. “S’not you,” he croaked. “Just tired.”
“You…” Potter looked over at him. In the dark, Draco couldn’t make out his expression. He waited. “That…was good.”
“I think it has to be that one,” Harry said shakily. “But Draco—in the memory—we didn’t see—what did he do?”
“But what about Draco?” Daphne’s voice rose from the din. “He's leading these lessons, too, isn’t he?”
Draco didn’t want Harry to see the extent to which his words affected him, and so he quipped, “Possessive, aren’t you?”
“I mean…” Draco shifted his satchel on his shoulder; his old wand was still tucked safely within. “I guess it makes sense.”
“What a night,” Dawlish was saying loudly. “Christmas dinner was an absolute nightmare—my mother-in-law, you've never met her, have you, Proudfoot, just unbearable—and I’d already been called away for a bunch of explosions up in Norfolk—can you imagine…”
"Think of your mother, all the good parts of your childhood,” Harry suggested. “Think about that time you let a Dungbomb off in the Manor.”
They made their way to the seventh floor together. The corridors were suspiciously empty—though Draco thought that might have something to do with the stench of Dungbombs they encountered in the entrance hall. Something shifted in Draco when he saw the door to the Room of Requirement materialize; whether that was because of the visions of Vincent being swept up in Fiendfyre that continued to afflict him, or the weird feeling he got in his stomach whenever he thought of kissing Potter, he couldn’t say. The room was packed with eighth-year students, and it was quite different from the bare space he and Potter had practiced in. Though it was still dark, illuminated only by the soft glow of enchanted candles floating above them, there were cushions and armchairs strewn along the floor. To their left was a trestle table, sagging under the weight of pastries and countless varieties of alcohol. A wireless was playing loudly from somewhere. Most people were dancing, though some milled around, bottle in hand, conversing in loose groups. The room was already hot; Draco undid the first two buttons of his shirt.
Draco stared at him. As Proudfoot's words sunk in, he said, "It's you. You're the contact from the Ministry who made the Portkey. You're the one who connects him to the Floo network whenever we need to talk."
Lovegood seemed wholly unbothered by their discussion. She was back to surveying the branches as they swayed in the wind.
“You could try.” Granger closed her book and set it aside. “Who knows? It might change. Try thinking of something else, Draco, some other memory. That might bring something new to the forefront.”
Draco lay on the blanket, his head nestled onto the pillow. Above them, the leafy canopy swayed gently in the wind. He waited for Potter to take his arm, to examine his Mark. Instead, Potter sat next to him, cross-legged, and took out a piece of parchment from his bag.
Draco rubbed his eyes, suddenly drained. “I’m fine. I knew this was coming. My father heard rumours from the Ministry.”
“Yeah. Just four more days until the holidays, right? And then you can bring your father the Portkey.”
“The two times Hermione and I tried it,” Harry said softly, “she said neither of my memories were about my scar. Not really. One of them was about the Dursleys—the Muggle family I grew up with—and the other was about Sirius. My godfather.”
“I knew that one!” she cried. “They both start with ‘n.’ God. Alright. Fine. Your turn. Er…” She turned to her textbook, flipping through the pages. “Dagaz.”
The Hog’s Head was as dim and shabby as he remembered. Harry spoke quietly to the barman, who led them to a little room and shut the door behind them. It was draughty; the only warmth came from the little fire struggling to stay alive in the grate. Draco shrunk into his cloak as he looked around at the bare brick walls and the shuttered windows. He was starting to have second thoughts, and Harry must have known, because he gave him a reassuring smile as he took the little bowl of Floo powder off the mantle.
"Aren't you forgetting something?" Aria allowed one corner of her lips to tug upwards into a slow, malicious smirk. "You said it yourself. I'm the Chosen One,
It certainly didn't help that everywhere he looked, he saw his friends being annoyingly sweet with their partners (Blaise was spending more and more of his time with Luna Lovegood; Greg and Astoria were practically joined at the hip; and Pansy and Neville acted like an annoying married couple already); and he wasn't eager to spend another week having to watch them.
and his eyes automatically fluttered shut. Out of their own accord, his arms wrapped themselves tightly around her waist and he pulled her closer, savoring the feel of the soft curves of her slender body pressed up against him.
Later that week, after all the rumors about the whole vandalism fiasco began to die down in the halls, Aria and Hermione – as well as a handful of other 8th years unfortunate enough to be taking advanced potions that year – found themselves listening intently to Slughorn's lecture about their assigned potion for that afternoon.
Granted, it took Aria a few minutes longer than usual since she had to limp her way through all the flights of stairs she encountered (she only just realized how annoying it was that there were so many of them around the school), she eventually reached the Headmistress' Tower just in time to see Hermione walking away from the Stairwell Gargoyle guarding McGonagall's office.
would earn that person a one-way ticket to Azkaban right? But they chose to look away in my case. Because I was the girl-who-lived. Bunch of self-serving hypocrites they are." Aria said scornfully.
"No, everything's fine! It's just that…Well…" When Hermione paused again and bit her lip, Ron finally seemed to have lost his patience and turned to Aria with a wide, ecstatic grin.
"Well, yeah. What do you expect me to do? Drag this whole thing out and make you crawl on your knees, begging me for mercy?" Aria rolled her eyes and laughed at the disbelieving scowl on his face. "I mean, it
"Anyway, enough of that." Aria bit her lip and hastily decided to change the topic by standing up and pulling him to his feet. "I think I have some wine left in the kitchen. Do you want some?" She asked, giving him a disarming smile.
"Thanks for that." Aria's left eye twitched with a mixture of surprised irritation - surprise because
Once he was done, he straightened his robes and set off, heading quickly towards the east wing of the castle. Since Aria couldn't attend their European Magical Anthropology class with him that afternoon, Draco had promised to attend so that he could lend her his notes (though she did have to negotiate a very interesting deal with him before he actually agreed).
"Sorry, but I'm going to have to pass this time." Aria walked over to where Blaise was sitting and clamped a hand down hard onto his shoulder. From the way Blaise winced under her tight grip, it wasn't hard to guess that she was probably paying him back for that 'babe' comment. "I'm heading out to London tonight to do some errands." She added.
Draco hesitated for a split second, before he held the feather up into the air and spoke out loud. "You will cease carrying out your previous instructions immediately!
Luckily, before she was tempted to shove Blaise to the floor, Hannah sat down on the other side of the bed beside her.
Before he left, he tried to convince Aria to come with him like she usually did, but Aria decided to decline. As much as she loved the Weasleys, she knew how important it was for them to spend their Christmas together alone as a family this year – especially since this was their first Christmas together after Fred's death.
"No, it's okay." Greg rushed out, giving her a reassuring smile. "I know it's not your fault. It's just that...I never realized that heels were pretty dangerous." He admitted, chuckling.
"Wait!" Draco called out to her again in panic when the train began to pull away from the platform. "You never answered my question! Can I see you again? And how do I even get in touch with you if I don't know your name—"
"If it's saving up for a house that's making you delay the wedding, you don't need to worry about that just yet. You're both welcome to stay in Grimmauld Place for as long as you need to. Nobody will be using it anyway, I'll be moving into a new place after graduation." Aria reminded her.
"Honestly, I'm just happy those two kids weren't expelled." Blaise told them with a weary sigh as he collapsed into one of the couches in the common room a few days later.
"No, it's not." Blaise's eyes were wide as he flicked his gaze back and forth between Aria and Draco with a look of genuine amazement on his face. "You ordered her to kill Draco, and so she made him her mate. And everyone knows—
Her lips twitched at the carefully guarded tone of his voice, but when Draco just smiled nervously at her and didn't say anything else, they both eventually burst out laughing.
"So…How was your investigation, love? Did you learn anything?" Ron asked, giving the Ravenclaw a curious look.
After the war, a few months before she manifested as a veela, she spent a lot of her time with the Weasleys at the Burrow, helping them with the necessary arrangements for Fred's funeral, as well as making arrangements of her own for the funerals of Remus and Tonks. During that time, she and George had grown close; ironically much closer than they had been when they went to the Yule Ball together back in Aria's fourth year.
"I don't know exactly." Blaise shook his head to clear the dazed expression away from his face before reclaiming his seat beside Draco. "I saw her when I was getting some snacks from the trolley. She's…I don't know, she looks
The words were spoken softly, without any hint of mirth or teasing in them, but Draco recognized them easily, and he was overwhelmed with a wave of
Aria's chest ached as she watched Draco lower his eyes again and stare longingly at their clasped hands. She felt the way his fingers shook, the way they clasped tightly,
“You’re starting to make me feel like this was a big mistake, allowing you to poke around in my mind,” Draco muttered.
fun, I’m warning you now. Everyone is old and miserable and nosy, and they play music that might have been popular sixty years ago, and—”
“That’s not why I keep those memories of you upfront.” Potter gave a shaky laugh. “I do it because I’ve spent the whole summer trying to tell myself I hate you.”
“What? No.” Harry shook his head absently. “He’s disappointed. He thought we’d do Auror training together, after Hogwarts. He’s happy for me, I think, but it’s a bit awkward.”
They laughed as Weasley’s face turned an unflattering shade of red. Draco smirked at the memory of Weasley and Lavender snogging around the castle…Weasley, he recalled, had all but eaten Lavender’s face.
Draco looked at Harry, at his open, innocent face, and leaned in to kiss him. It was a soft, chaste kiss, their lips barely touching, but still he turned into Harry’s embrace. It was comforting, being held like this. He wished desperately that they could stay in this room forever, just the two of them, oblivious to the world outside. Draco pulled away and studied Harry’s face. A question lingered on his tongue. It had been bothering him for some time now. He tried to convince himself to let it go, but before he could, it spilled out: “What are we?”
Embarrassed—by how quickly he had come for Potter, by the noises he had made, by his willingness to accept a handjob in an empty classroom—Draco rearranged his shirt and did up his trousers. Drained as he was, he still wanted to reach out and touch Potter. He couldn’t deny that he had been up the past two nights thinking about how Potter might writhe and moan under his hands. But Potter was already pulling away, a satisfied smirk on his face.
, he knew that, they had always tried to support him, to understand him, to make sense of him. They would encourage him to go. They would want him to go. Their faces had been suspicious the moment his mother’s owl swooped down and dropped the letter into his lap. It was almost as though the stupid bird had waited until he was with his friends, knowing that they would pester him, that they would urge him to respond…
For a moment, Potter said nothing, staring down at Draco’s hand in surprise. Then, finally, he muttered, “I agreed to help you with your Mark. Not to fuck up your memories, or…or whatever else this is.”
and the sound of fluttering wings. He wasn’t surprised to see Callidus soaring towards him, but the sight was still unwelcome.
They heard Pansy before they saw her—she was tugging her parents towards their table. Mr. Parkinson looked as irritable as ever, his little black moustache twitching as he frowned, while Mrs. Parkinson readjusted her pink, feathered hat. Suddenly, Draco had an idea. As his mother stood to greet the Parkinsons, he leaned towards Harry.
Harry looked very guilty as he whispered, “I’m so sorry. Here, let me heal it.” He began to reach for his wand.
Again, Harry looked at Draco; again, he looked away. “Some of them. Maybe not entirely corporeal, especially the fifth-year students, but we can at least get them started. In the D.A., we…” He trailed off, ducking his head in embarrassment.
They were walking through the grounds, bundled tightly in their winter cloaks. Draco illuminated his wand so that they could follow the path to the Great Lake. Thanks to Harry’s Warming Charm, they were quite comfortable, and Draco enjoyed the gentle breeze against his face. It felt good to be outdoors.
Since the end of his sixth year, Draco had refused to step foot in the Astronomy Tower. Most days, he managed to avoid looking at it entirely. And so when Harry proposed that they climb to the top of the tower to see the night sky, he blanched. Terror and guilt threatened to engulf him until Harry finally held his face in his hands, looking straight into his eyes.
“Probably.” Draco ground his neem leaves into a watery green oil. Next to him, Harry did the same. Up at the front of the class, someone laughed loudly. The sound ripped through him. All at once, his knees buckled, nearly sending him to the floor. The pain in his Mark was immense. Before he could stop himself, he dropped his pestle onto the bench with a loud clatter. A sickening scene flashed before him: his aunt Bellatrix, jeering as she dueled someone Draco couldn’t see…and then there was a blinding flash of light, and he knew that they were dead, and he felt his stomach turn…and still, his aunt was laughing…
Draco jumped violently when the door to the changing room banged open. He pushed Blaise away, already dreading the taunts he was about to face from Nott, when he realized that it was Ron Weasley standing at the door. He should have made to cover himself, or at least barked at Weasley to piss off, but for some reason he could do nothing more than gape at him.
“Right." Draco took a deep breath, preparing himself to stand up, when he paused. "Here, I forgot.” Before he could change his mind, Draco pulled the little golden chocolate out of his pocket. “This is for you.”
"That is a very bold conclusion to make, Miss Potter." She pointed out, folding her hands on top of the table and leaning back against her seat. "The evidence clearly points to Mister Parkinson as the culprit this time. So where exactly are you basing your assumptions on?"
; and that was when the blank mask on Aria's face finally crumpled. A soft, choked sob escaped her lips as she grabbed a glass teacup from the tray on her lap, hurling it across the room until it shattered into tiny, broken pieces against the door.
As soon as he was gone, the nervous smile on Aria's face faltered and she groaned to herself, covering her face with her hands.
"I was afraid of that." Ron mumbled, letting out a dejected sigh before he scowled petulantly at Aria and sank back down into his seat. "I thought you said you weren't interested in playing quidditch this year. Something about studying for NEWTS and preparing for Auror qualifying exams."
"It's in the way you stare at her when she's not looking. I've seen you looking at her that way for years."
Blaise snorted at that and leaned down slightly to his side so he could whisper something into Aria's ear without Draco hearing.
Luckily, Draco didn't seem to notice her embarrassing behavior (and thank Merlin for that, because Aria was certain that the bloody git would never let her hear the end of it) because he was much too busy staring and being amazed at all the strange new sights. His eyes flicked from one muggle contraption to another, and every now and then, he tugged on Aria's arm, demanding that she tell him exactly what it was.
Pansy snorted at her hostile reaction and rolled her eyes, walking back over to the other side of the classroom to continue cleaning the floors. After awhile, Aria stood up sharply from her seat and stalked over to her with a dangerous glint in her eyes.
have to sit with our new houses, okay? I don't want the Headmistress to think we're disrespecting her efforts."
Neville blushed darker when Blaise and Draco began laughing at his reaction. Grumbling under his breath, he shook his head and shot them both a glare before he stomped away without another word.
She made her way across the hall towards the refreshment table, taking that opportunity to glance appreciatively around her.
Both Morag and Granger raised their hands and Wood looked amused as he glanced back and forth between the two of them. He eventually decided to call on Morag.
at me when all I did was tell him to straighten his tie! I'm a prefect after all, I have the right to make sure all my housemates look presentable!" She huffed.
Aria's lips tilted with misery as she lowered her eyes and looked away. Beside her, Ron looked just as equally distraught and he alternated his gaze back and forth between the two girls in concern.
" Aria hissed at him, her eyes flashing with humiliation. "You knew all this time, didn't you? Is that why you were teasing me back there? Did you have
He didn't wait for Aria to answer before he continued. "And funny you should mention Puddlemere, actually, because you
"It's the mate bond." She whispered back, biting at his skin and causing him to hiss in pleasure. "I can feel you too."
As she stared at Blaise Zabini's smirking face across the table, Aria couldn't help but wonder exactly how beautiful his mother probably was, especially given the fact that Blaise was, undeniably,
Aria's lips twitched at that but she pretended as though she hadn't heard him. "Then we'd better get started on this if we want to finish on time. Are you coming with us, Hagrid?"
"And it's not like I said it to be rude! I just didn't want the git to lose us any more house points! Did you know that he lost us
in bed with you, I might have told you the truth sooner." She purred, rolling herself back on top of him and kissing him again until Draco grumbled in protest and pushed her away.
Aria smirked at his reaction and sent him another mental image through their bond — this time one of him tied to the bedposts with Aria riding him hard and fast — and Draco stiffened again, gritting his teeth as he felt himself nearly succumbing to the overwhelming urge to fuck her into the bed.
"You mean she dumped you, right?" Pansy cut him off with a mocking sneer. "Is that why you're trying to salvage your ego by going after me again? Am I supposed to be flattered?"
Once he was fully buried inside her, his hips pressing hers down hard onto the bed, Draco broke their kiss with a groan and leaned down, resting his forehead against hers. His eyes clenched shut as he went completely still, every single muscle in his body tensing in an obvious effort to control himself.
Slowly, the realization began to dawn on Burt's face when he recognized who exactly it was he was facing and he suddenly
"They weren't that hard to find." Aria smirked as she straightened back up and loomed over him, twirling her wand around in her hand. "Did you really think that I would let you take advantage of me again? You must think
"You shut up, Malfoy! Or we'll kick your ass!" Jenson finally spoke for the first time since Draco had arrived, though he seemed to cower and step away when Draco just smirked at him and arched at eyebrow in response.
He turned to give Corey another admonishing glare, but instead, it ended up as a worried frown when he noticed the distressed expression that continued to linger on the younger boy's face.
A little encouraged by her reaction, he set his empty glass back down onto the counter and turned around fully to face her.
The lights around the entire hall began to dim just then, saving her from the need to say anything else; especially when a slow romantic melody began to play in the background. Aria looked up, turning her attention towards the stage where Stubby Boardman had paused from his singing to announce something over the microphone.
"You should have gone easy with the alcohol, Zabini." Draco mused, smirking when he realized that Zach was already passed out and was snoring loudly, half of his entire form sprawled on the table.
"Seriously?!" The suspicion in Corey's expression immediately faded into an ecstatic grin as he blinked at her, practically bouncing in his seat. "You'll help me with my flying? You're not just pulling my leg, are you? But what about Pansy?"
"What?!" Draco's eyes bugged out of their sockets as he immediately whipped his head around and glared at her as though she had just admitted to having a crush on the Dark Lord. "Potter, have you gone mad?! How can you even consider this?!"
He watched anxiously as she and Fisher continued to wrestle and grapple with each other; until Fisher finally grabbed at Aria's injured wing, causing her to cry out in pain. Fisher used her distraction to pin her against a tree and lift her up into the air. She hissed at him but strangely, she didn't pull away when Fisher bared his fangs and leaned his face closer towards her. He lifted Aria closer against him and bent down, sinking his fangs into her neck.
She lifted the small basket of muffins in her arms, but she winced and immediately stepped away when she saw the hostile expression on Aria's face.
!" He laughed when a red-faced Aria shoved him hard on the back, nearly causing him to fall off the bench.
"Look. Maybe Blaise is right, Pans." Draco cut her off, interrupting her impending tirade and causing both his friends to glance at him. "I think that's what McGonagall's stupid little resorting is all about, really. Everyone just wants to get along and forget about the bloody war. Maybe you should too. For everyone's sake." He said quietly.
He listened intently as she explained to them how, because of the ongoing reconstruction efforts of Hogwart's west wing – which had been badly damaged during the war – there was currently a shortage of available house elves to keep up the school's regular maintenance chores that year.
"I suppose she did." Aria arched an eyebrow and met his smirk with one of her own. "Personally though, I think the way we did it was so,
They sat together in one of the empty compartments near the back and spent the rest of the trip in comfortable silence.
"I'm just trying to keep you out of Azkaban, you git." Blaise retorted, scoffing as he held his hands up at Draco in a mock gesture of surrender.
"Is that so? What position do you play then?" Draco smirked, surprising everyone else with his sudden interest in the conversation.
"No, it's fine. It was long overdue anyway." Draco cut her off with a soft, defeated sigh. He lifted his gaze and glanced reproachfully at Hermione across the table. "I'm sorry for what happened, Granger. Not just for what my Aunt Bellatrix did to you, but for
"Really? You will?" The nervous look on Astoria's face finally melted away and her shoulders slumped in relief. "Th—thank Merlin—I mean, that's great." She bit her lip and chuckled nervously at herself. "I suppose I'll see you then. Would seven be an acceptable time to meet up before the Ball?"
Draco's pupils dilated at her words, and his gaze darkened, roaming hungrily up and down her barely clothed form. Though, when Draco looked up again, Aria was surprised to see a slight bit of hesitation that continued to linger on his face.
"It's nothing, Corey." Draco was quick to reassure him, managing to give him a forced smile that ended up looking more like a grimace. "Anyway, where's your sister? Aren't you two usually together on the weekends?"
birds." She answered. By then, Draco noticed that she was beginning to look irritated by his prodding as she was scratching impatiently at something behind her shoulder. "Anyway, I'd better get going—"
"At least you're not stupid." She titled her head slightly to the side and regarded Aria's appearance with an arched eyebrow. "That suppression of yours is pretty strong magic, by the way. Apart from the hair, you look exactly the same as you did before the war. Isn't it exhausting to keep it up all day?"
"I see. That's good then. So—" Blaise arched an eyebrow and peered closely at Draco, trying to gauge his mood. "—are
Aria giggled and rewarded Draco with an exhilarated smile at that before she flew off, exchanging a quick high-five with Blaise as she passed the Keeper's post. As he watched her fly away, Draco felt another strange, fluttering feeling somewhere in the pit of his stomach.
Trying to get through our classes." She spoke to him in a soothing, steady voice, hoping to calm him down.
She suppressed her true form and shoved her glasses onto her face, pulling the thick curtains back from around her bed. Afterwards, she wrapped a warm blanket around her shoulders and trudged sleepily across the room, yawning as she sank down onto the rug in front of the fireplace.
Draco stiffened at the other boy's question, and he couldn't help the sigh of relief that escaped him at how incredibly lucky they were that Aria wasn't in the classroom. Obviously, Granger and Weasley seemed to be thinking the exact same thing because Draco saw the way they glanced uneasily at each other, their gazes flicking to Aria's vacant seat.
you to change, because I don't want you as anything other than who are. And that includes every goddamn wonderful, perfect, and terrible part of you." She lifted her eyes again, meeting his gaze with a slightly crooked smile.
"Your name is written in every single history book now, after all. You're practically a top-tier celebrity. So how does it feel? Having reporters from the Daily Prophet track you down, requesting exclusive interviews all the time. I read in some tabloid somewhere that you even received marriage proposals from at least
"What's up with that face, Potter?" Draco chuckled as he reached up and took her by the chin, gently turning her head so that she was staring back at him with her big, beautiful green eyes. "
Draco and Blaise both watched in horror as Pansy's face turned purple and her eyes began to roll to the back of her head.
"Oh come on, Aria. Don't be like that. You don't have to worry, I haven't dealt with something as mundane as blackmail for years." Blaise rewarded her with another smile before he used his wand to levitate a fresh batch of clean dishes into an empty cupboard.
Draco brought his awareness back to the present as he lifted his gaze from his desk and stole a quick glance at Potter at the opposite end of their DADA classroom.
Another trail of whispers rang out from the reporters gathered in front of Draco, and he watched as one of them stood up and called Aria's attention.
When Draco just shrugged and turned another page of his book, deliberately ignoring her, the worried look on Pansy's face quickly transformed into one of outrage.
"We'd better head down to the Potions classroom already if we want to get good seats. Oh yeah, that reminds me." Pansy cut herself off and rifled briefly through her schoolbag, pulling out a small sheet of parchment. Without glancing at her, she thrust the parchment at Aria and waved it impatiently in front of her face.
Neville seemed to have noticed the same thing because he sputtered with outrage and glared furiously at Skeeter. "Don't make up stories about us like that! Aria and I are just good friends; we're
She slammed her book shut, glaring irritably at Hannah and wrinkling her nose in disdain at the sight of the gowns she was holding up. "Please tell me those aren't your only choices. Because I will stop associating with you if they are." She sniffed haughtily and tilted her nose up high into the air.
"I just finished submitting my application for my apprenticeship courses under the Wizengamot this summer." He answered quietly.
The woman blinked at his words and pretended to give him an affronted glare. "Is that any way to greet your mother properly?" She scoffed.
To her surprise, McGonagall just gave her a weary look and adjusted her spectacles onto the bridge of her nose. When she didn't say anything, Aria shared a look with Corey from the corner of her eye, meeting his anxious grimace with a small, reassuring grin.
"And while we're at it, Headmistress, please tell the school board that I also want them to revoke the expulsion orders of the other Slytherins who were expelled for the previous vandalism incidents too. In fact, I want these incidents wiped from their academic records completely."
He ignored her icy glare and chucked her chin up gently, waiting until she met his eyes before he spoke.
"Honestly, Potter. You have to pay more attention in class." Draco retorted, rolling his eyes at her. "Bewitchments. Like…vampire hypnosis, mermaid's songs, veela allure, even
"Parkinson and I professed our undying love for each other and then proceeded to have hot, lesbian sex on one of the teacher's tables." She mumbled while chewing.
"I'll try one, Blaise." Neville suddenly offered, glancing warily from the corner of his eye at Aria's annoyed expression. He took the muffin Blaise offered and took a small bite, pausing for a moment in surprise before he turned to Pansy and gave her a genuine smile.
Her eyes immediately riveted to the lone, silent male figure who was seated, with one ankle resting lazily on top of his knee, on a high-backed armchair facing the foot of the bed. Even in the darkness, Aria recognized the light blond shade of Draco's hair instantly; and she met his heavy-lidded stare from across the room with a slow, sultry smile.
"Is the Chosen One really going to bother fighting me over some no-good, Slytherin bitch like Pansy Parkinson? Wasn't she the one who wanted to turn you over to the Dark Lord? We both know she's not worth it. It's okay, you know. You don't have to help her. I won't tell anyone." He smiled at her, oblivious to the way Pansy flinched at his words.
"Why the hell are we still talking about sex?!" Hannah finally screamed at all of them in her frustration, her loud, hysterical voice echoing loudly in the Great Hall and causing the students from the three other tables to stare at them in varying degrees of shock, amusement and disbelief.
The hand Draco had been using to caress her cheek fell limply by his side. He stared at her, trying to mask his hurt and confusion with a frown.
They stayed in that position for awhile, their forms completely intertwined as they kissed and lazily explored each other's naked bodies, pausing every now and then to whisper reverent words into each other's ear.
"I didn't see anything, I swear!" Draco blurted out as he immediately whirled around, fixing his gaze intently on the walls. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have come in here, I should have realized that you needed to change—"
"I was just concerned." Draco smirked at her reaction, watching as she began fiddling nervously with her utensils. "Like I said, it might be difficult for you to play quidditch properly. Plus, it's dangerous since it could impair your visibility while flying—especially if your hair is
"So I had a lot of fun last night, Morag. When exactly are we going to meet up again?" He purred in a seductive voice.
He snatched the coat from her hands, shaking his head and meeting her surprised look with an apologetic grimace. "We shouldn't end things this way. It's
"Yes." Hermione sighed. "We checked their wands to confirm if it really was them. They were definitely the ones who trashed the common rooms. When we asked them why they did it though, they said they don't actually remember doing it."
"Seriously?" He grumbled under his breath as he and Pansy switched seats so that he now sat directly between her and Neville. "For the record, I think you two are completely
Gryffindor always managed to consistently become Slytherin's fiercest rivals for the Quidditch Championship over the past couple of years.
at that, and Draco felt his cheeks begin to flush at the way he could feel her soft, warm breaths against his pulse, causing the skin there to tingle pleasurably.
"No, actually." He admitted, ducking his head and giving her a sheepish look. "You would be the first."
hers quite well. The three of them were very different from each other despite being sorted into Gryffindor. Not to say that she didn't like being with her new housemates or anything, but being around people who were too much like her
In other words, now that he finally managed to confirm that Potter was, in fact, a veela, he didn't actually know what he was supposed to do with that information. Or the fact that he was, apparently, a compatible enough mate for her – if her reaction to his touch a few minutes ago was any indication.
"Wow. I uh—" Aria hesitated under Blaise's expectant look, her eyebrows fusing together. "I'm not sure, Blaise. Given everyone's history with each other, are you sure that's really such a good idea?"
"It wasn't that hard to figure out. I realised it immediately after our first discussion about veelas in our anthropology elective. Besides, all of the clues were there. Aria's magically powerful and all but she's not exactly the most impressive when it comes to subtlety." She drawled.
"How about holy water and crosses? Is it true that vampires are terrified of them?" Susan Bones asked.
She ignored his remark and stood up, reaching out and taking his hand in hers. For a second, Draco hesitated and looked up at her with a strange, unreadable expression on his face. With a heavy sigh, he stood up and reluctantly allowed Aria to lead him to the dance floor. Just as they were about to step directly under the bright lights, however, Draco suddenly froze up.
Most of the contents of the letter hadn't said much, just the usual meaningless pleasantries they often exchanged with one another at the start of every correspondence. However, what surprised Draco about the letter was that his Dream Girl had finally given him an official
The beady-eyed reporter fell completely silent at Aria's words, and Draco was amused when he saw the stupefied look on her face as she sat back down into her seat. Aria went on and turned to address the crowd with an irritated look.
"She didn't want anyone taking advantage of her again." Blaise smiled grimly at her before his eyes suddenly narrowed and he turned to her with a very strange, knowing gleam in his eyes.
The short-haired girl completely froze up at that, blinking a couple of times and staring at the flower as though it was going to catch on fire and explode right in her face. Undaunted by her reaction, Neville squared his shoulders and continued, a light flush beginning to stain his cheeks.
Growling in frustration, Draco was just about to head out of the Great Hall to look for Aria himself when Luna suddenly stood up and walked quietly over to the window behind them. The expression on her face was deeply contemplative as she stared at the expansive view of the Forbidden Forest outside the castle.
"Sorry, but I don't really like repeat performances." She quipped, deliberately moving away from them and turning back to her books. "Besides, I've definitely had better and you two pretty boys aren't really my type." She added bluntly.
Pansy snarled as she rounded on Aria again; and Draco couldn't help smirking as he watched Aria hastily move away. Instead of backing down, however, Aria just shrugged and met Pansy's irate expression with a defiant look.
"She accidentally fell asleep in front of me in the library one time while we were studying. Her guard dropped for like a few seconds; but it was long enough that I saw her true form."
From where she was sitting between Neville and Ron in a comfy corner of the library that afternoon, Aria blinked and glared up at Blaise with an incredulous look on her face.
"Who's the girl latching onto him?" Neville asked, lifting his unimpressed gaze and watching the pair's interaction with a look of uncharacteristic disdain written all over his features.
we're going to win this year. You and I are both on the same team this time. That means no other team is going to stand a chance. So I'd better not catch you slacking off on your training."
The action seemed to snap Aria out of her near-frozen state as she flinched and snatched the gloves from Blaise, hastily yanking it onto her bare, exposed hand. When she finally stood up, Draco's attention was once again drawn to her hair, noting how the dark strands were long enough that they ended just a few inches above her shoes.
"Wait a minute." Neville suddenly spoke as he latched onto Aria's arm. "If you're not sitting with the Slytherins yet, then I'm going with you. I don't want to sit there all by myself." He complained.
"Veritaserum, yes." Aria answered, grinning slyly at him. "I switched the drinks when you weren't looking."
you two!" She blurted out, and she looked as though she wanted to hurl her goblet across the table at their matching smirks. "You should go after her, you're her friends! She looked like she was going to cry back there."
"Aww...Isn't he sweet? Can't we keep him, Estelle?" Emma, another Healer who was in her early twenties, said as she cooed at him and turned to Estelle. "Maybe you can talk to the Ministry and ask them to extend his sentence with us for another year? I'm going to miss having someone so cute and handsome to ogle all day while I'm doing my rounds." She added.
When she gave him a questioning look, he sighed and hung his head. "My Ministry trial is tomorrow. It's why I'm here, actually. This could very well be the last time I'll get to go out freely like this, I might as well enjoy a drink or two before I'm sent to rot away in Azkaban forever." He felt bile rising up in throat at the thought and with a grimace, he quickly tossed back the rest of his drink to wash away the bitter taste in his mouth.
Granger looked confused at her answer and she looked as though she was going to ask another question but just as she opened her mouth, Finnigan suddenly raised his hand again and grinned unrepentantly at Fleur.
"Whatever. I've done my part. I'm going to bed." Pansy broke Aria's train of thought as she rolled her eyes at their staring and sauntered pointedly over to her four poster bed at the very end of the room. "The bathroom is that door beside the fireplace at the back. The small closet by the door is for cloaks and boots only. Oh, and be sure to leave your dirty shoes outside." She cast a cursory glare at them and waited until they all walked back to the entrance and removed their shoes.
"Relax, I'm not going to blackmail you or anything." Aria rolled her eyes at his reaction. "But how's this? You pay more attention and actually exert some real effort when I teach you in the mornings. And in return, I'll help you with your flying and give you some tips after every lesson." She arched an eyebrow at him.
"Before I dismiss you, Headmistress McGonagall instructed me to inform you all about your assignment for the next topic. You are to research on
"You'd better not fuck that up for us again, Smith. Or I swear to Merlin, I'll knock you off your broom in front of the entire school." Draco drawled in a mocking tone of voice.
"Does that make you angry, little boy? Knowing that your precious savior, who for some reason you worship so much and choose to put up in that pathetic golden pedestal of yours, could be a filthy, two-faced Slytherin
"I don't remember doing anything either, I swear!" Corey blurted out, his voice breaking when a half-sob, half-hiccup wracked his frame. He turned his attention back to McGonagall and gave her an imploring look. "It wasn't me, Headmistress! I didn't do this! Please don't expel me, my father will disown me if I get kicked out of Hogwarts! Please—"
Corey somehow. The same way he did those other kids. But I'm not sure how, exactly, possibly an Imperius and then a Confundus? Or a memory charm? " Aria frowned again and shook her head.
Hermione." Aria groaned out loud and gave the brown-haired Ravenclaw an accusing glare. "Are you intentionally choosing the subjects most likely to make me and Ron
"There's no mystery behind it, actually." Blaise told her, watching as Aria levitated another pile of newly cleaned plates over to him to be dried. "Just as Neville said, those two knew each other since they were children. Pansy, Neville and Draco are all part of the Sacred Twenty Eight after all, so they were almost always made to attend a lot of pureblood gatherings back then."
Draco merely blinked and gave him an impassive look instead, smirking slightly as he towered over the other boy's form.
She tasted absolutely exquisite on his mouth; like a unique mixture of salted honey and Draco couldn't stop himself from humming in delight as he lapped and sucked all of her wetness up, loving the way she was dripping with so much arousal that she was staining the sheets of the bed.
Draco turned the parchment over in his hands, checking to see if anything else was written. “Father says he needs my permission to have funds withdrawn from my Gringotts account.”
When Draco arrived in the kitchen the next morning, he found Lupin and Potter at the dining table. He levitated his suitcase down the stairs, setting it neatly next to Potter’s bag.
“We practice loads,” Harry insisted, leaning forward to plant a kiss on Draco’s shoulder. “All kinds of things.”
Draco jumped violently. Looking up, he froze at the sight of Proudfoot standing in the colonnade, smiling at them. He made to shift away, but Harry was having none of it, placing his hand firmly on Draco’s back.
“It’s okay,” she said softly. “I know what this lot are like. But...whatever you’re doing, I hope you’re being careful. Does Pansy know, at least?”
“I’m in the library,” he muttered to himself. “I’m in the library and I’m fine. Nothing’s happened.”
Draco’s thoughts were racing by so quickly that he struggled to catch hold of them. Blaise had only been this frank with him once before—a tense night in their sixth year, when he had begun to suspect what Draco was planning and urged him to go to Dumbledore. “Talk to him,” he had said. And here he was again, urging Draco to speak up for himself, to be vulnerable, to be open. The trouble was, he had spent years perfecting the art of closing himself off, of compartmentalizing his emotions until they were firmly locked away in the back of his mind. To be vulnerable, he had learned, was to leave oneself open to all manner of betrayal. And he didn’t know if he could stand to be let down again.
He expected the sharp slap against his thigh. “Behave.” The mattress shifted and Draco came to sit next to him. “Behave,” he said, more gently now, reaching forward to inspect his wrists. He tutted to himself, tracing his thumb along the pattern of bruises there. “From the restraints?” he asked. Harry nodded. Carefully, he sat up and inspected Harry’s bottom, rubbing the cheeks with his palms. The subtle ache barely registered. “These have started to fade. You’ll need fresh ones, I think.”
Draco reached over and snatched up the list Granger had drawn. Most of the N.E.W.T.-level spells, he suspected, would be over his classmates’ heads.
“Well, he had to go to St. Mungo’s for a while. To see a Healer, I forget her name…she was a very nice lady, though…she used to give me sweets…”
Draco stood in front of the little mirror hanging on their wardrobe. Blaise was already gone—he wanted to send a letter before breakfast. After all these years at Hogwarts, Draco still found that he needed to look in the mirror to arrange his tie. As he straightened the knot, pulling it to lay at the base of his throat, he considered his reflection. Between yesterday and today, he was unchanged. And that was what he couldn’t understand. He had spent all night awake—not upset, not scared, but pensive, dragging his fingers through the filmy green curtains surrounding his bed as he tried to digest what had happened.
He whined when Harry pulled away; the sudden loss of heat was distressing. But he needn’t have worried, because Harry shifted to straddle his lap, looking down at Draco hungrily as he settled in.
“That isn’t true,” Harry said quietly. “I’ve seen your memories. Your mother didn’t want you to get the Mark.”
“His face!” she sniggered. “Like he’d seen a slug or something. Poor Millicent. How long did it take her to forgive you for that?”
“Right. Thank you.” Draco felt as though he should say something else, but nothing came to mind. Finally, he said, “Your commentary. At the Quidditch match. It was very good.”
“That’s right.” She nodded. “Memories leave marks on us. Not just on our minds, in our thoughts…but on our bodies. And so do erasures.”
“Right,” said Potter. “Thanks to all of you for coming. This is a bit of an unusual situation, as neither of us expected to be leading this. I guess we can think of it as a study group, or a bit like the D.A., for those of you who were members.” It took everything Draco had not to roll his eyes. “McGonagall wants us to practice our spellwork, especially since there were so many interruptions last year. And some of us, like myself, weren’t even here, so…”
“Okay.” Still frightened, the bittersweet memory gripping at the edges of his consciousness, Draco leaned into Harry’s touch. In this raw state of vulnerability, he couldn’t help the unbidden thought that leapt before him: he wanted Harry. He did. His stomach did all sorts of funny things as he allowed himself to take Harry in—the worried look on his face, his cheeks ruddy from the cold. The curl of hair tucked behind his ear. His long, dark eyelashes. The shadow of stubble across his jaw. He hadn’t felt anything like this in so long. Hadn’t
Harry gave a bitter smile. “Yeah. I’ve gotten rather good at that. Years of practice. And over the summer, that’s the only way I got through it all. I just sort of…bottled it all up.”
“Blaise and I are helping Slughorn restock potions for the Hospital Wing. I guess their stores have been depleted since…what happened last year. And anyway,” she said brightly, “you need Potions for loads of careers, right? And he’s really well connected, Slughorn.”
Theo pulled a face at him but didn’t bother with a retort. They were all exhausted: Transfiguration had been gruelling that afternoon.
Back in bed, Draco stared up at the ceiling, wide awake. Things had been tense between him and his father for years now. Theirs was a complicated relationship, made more difficult by the Dark Lord’s intrusion into the Manor and the bitter fights between his parents over their involvement with the Death Eaters. Regardless, he couldn’t bring himself to consider the possibility of his father being subjected to the Dementor’s Kiss. Everyone said it was worse than death. He had no idea how his mother would carry on if it were to happen. He still believed that Shacklebolt had some sense, and that he wouldn’t be so cruel, but the papers had been absolutely scathing in their portrayal of his father. Now that the Dark Lord was gone, and so many Death Eaters were in hiding or dead, it seemed that in many ways his father had become the target of an incredible barrage of collective anger. He hoped that the Wizengamot wouldn’t give in to public opinion, but it wouldn’t be the first time a trial had turned out unfairly.
“It’s freezing out here,” Blaise complained. Draco heard him cast a Warming Charm. He refused to look over at him. “It’s eight o’clock, you know. You missed dinner.”
“No,” Harry said. “It wasn’t really important—just Sirius and I cleaning stuff at Grimmauld Place, having a laugh, you know—but I stopped Hermione before she could erase it.”
Draco gasped as the cold night air hit his face. The pain in his Mark shot through to the tips of his fingers, the crook of his elbow. He gave a low groan as Harry gripped his wrist. Looking over, Draco was shocked at what he saw—Harry was angry. His lips were thin and he had a harsh look on his face, glaring at Draco’s Mark as he swept away the final remnants of his memory. When at last he was finished, he pulled his wand away, still staring at the Mark.
“That package is my last hope,” he said. “More than ever, you need to protect it. Keep it with you at all times. And then bring it to me when you come for the Christmas holidays.”
“I’m doing a Tarot reading for my class,” Pansy said crossly. “I can’t wait until we go back to crystal balls next term.”
“Like what?” Draco asked, exasperated. “I couldn’t, I don’t have—” He stopped himself short. This was stupid. Draco was starting to suspect that Nott was right, that this was all some great ruse to punish him. “Can we just get this over with?”
Harry was still looking out at the field when he said, “I want to see you. Let's work on your Mark tonight."
Draco looked over his shoulder and scowled when he saw Potter coming down a flight of stairs. Potter’s tie was loose, and he wasn’t wearing a cloak. His hair was as untidy as ever. Perhaps Saint Potter felt that he was so above the rest of them that he didn’t have to bother with his uniform anymore. Draco made to ignore him, continuing on to the dungeons, when Potter said, “Malfoy. Where are you headed?”
Harry was silent for a moment as he twisted his wand into Draco’s Mark, muttering. The pain pinched at him, but it wasn’t unbearable. Finally, he pulled his wand away and replaced it with his warm, gentle fingers. “Yeah, it was,” he said. “The one we didn’t erase before.”
Highly amused, Draco watched as Harry reached over the side of the bed for his wand. “Careful where you point that,” he warned.
Draco drew himself up with as much dignity as he could muster. The effect was rather muted, he thought, by his position on the ground with his arm in Potter’s lap. “That has nothing to do with it. Would
Harry shrugged, grinning. “Because I can never just have a quiet, boring life? I don’t know. Come on, go write Blaise and then pack. Or we’ll be late.”
Silence. He expected Harry to question him, and he urged him not to. Finally, he felt the holly wand press against his arm. “I’m starting now. Alright?”
Draco raised his eyebrows. “You’re a Gryffindor, so I’ll assume that using your status as the Chosen One and threatening someone’s father with Azkaban is beneath you.”
Draco did his best to take notes and to focus, but it was difficult when his hand kept straying up to his collar. He touched, very lightly, at the spot where Harry had bruised him. They would be meeting again tonight, to work on his Mark, but Draco hardly seemed to pay mind to his Mark anymore. It had nearly disappeared. Perhaps that was good enough, Draco thought, as he watched Vector draw a convoluted diagram on the blackboard. He could settle for good enough.
Draco didn’t like to think of it that way. He preferred to believe that Harry had done it for him specifically, not because of some unstoppable urge to save people. But he couldn’t say that to Blaise, so he merely grunted in agreement.
It took a huge effort to lift the cauldron of boiling onions over his sieve. Draco jerked his arm back as his Mark gave a painful throb; boiling water splashed onto his workbench.
“God, look at you,” Draco gasped. “Does it feel good, Potter? Does it feel good when I fuck you like this? Look at me. Look at me when I talk to you.”
Draco considered the satisfaction he might gain from snapping his old wand in half—a clean break from the past, maybe—but then he shook his head. “No…I’ll keep it, I think,” he said. “It'll be a good reminder."
“Yes, sir. Don’t want to be late for my first class.” He held up his timetable and flashed a smile that he hoped seemed genuine.
“Fuck,” he swore to himself, pocketing his timetable and rushing to class. The corridors were mostly empty, and he managed to make it to the classroom before Delacour had arrived. It was a bright, airy room, with high ceilings and long, narrow windows that welcomed in the morning sun. Rows of pine tables faced a chalkboard hung at the front. Draco slipped into an empty chair at the back of the room, next to Theo, who was speaking in hushed tones with Daphne and seemed not to have noticed him. As Draco was setting up his quill and inkpot, Delacour suddenly strode into the classroom, her pale silver robes fluttering as she proceeded to the teacher’s desk at the front of the room. Her blonde hair was pulled into a low knot. Instantly she seemed to command the room: there was an expectant silence as the students watched her, transfixed. She held several thick tomes in her arms, which she set down gently on her desk.
“Well, I’ll leave you to it,” Daphne said, rising from her chair. Draco checked his watch; two minutes left. “Think you can look over my Runes essay tomorrow?”
“Draco, how are you finding your internship?” Granger asked in a high-pitched voice. “Are you interested in teaching?”
"No, you’re not. Your mother’s going to kill me when she sees the state of you. You’re nothing but skin and bones these days.”
“Oops, we forgot to strain our onions.” He could barely hear Harry over the ringing in his ears. “Let me get your sieve.” But Draco couldn’t bring himself to respond; the room spun so sharply around him that he feared he would be sick if he opened his mouth. He grasped the edges of his bench, clinging tightly as he took in a stuttering breath.
Draco turned the scroll over in his hands. For a moment, he thought of chucking it—perhaps into the Great Lake—but, giving in to his sense of duty, he unravelled it. There was a single line:
“What? You’re not going to help me with nonverbal magic anymore?” Harry asked, giving him a mischievous smile.
“Oh, yes, what a great idea,” he said sarcastically. “Have you Stun me and then leave me here to rot.”
Again, he had half a mind to tease him, to make him really beg for it, but he almost didn’t dare. The feeling of Potter's tight heat was overwhelming. He could see that Potter was covering his face with his hands, moaning into his palms. For a second, he wondered why Potter was hiding his face—was he embarrassed? Was he trying to quiet himself? Was he as overcome as Draco was?—and then all thoughts were driven from his mind as Potter suddenly propped himself up on his elbow and took his cock in hand. He stroked himself as Draco thrust into him, both of them working together to establish some kind of rhythm. Their synchronicity brought about a strange sense of intimacy, as though they knew each other so well that they were able to match each other effortlessly.
Exasperated, Draco only just controlled the impulse to shout. “You have to believe me. It’s the truth. I know it is.”
“Potter.” He sighed angrily, reaching over to tug down his sleeve. “If you’re trying to get me to admit that I wasn’t actually a Death Eater, that I was on your side, then stop it. I took the Mark.”
Draco shook his head. Feeling strangely numb, he reached forward and dragged his satchel onto his lap. His Bag of Sad Things. Perhaps not so sad anymore, though. He moved his copy of
"I—I don't even know either, 'Mione!" Aria managed to wheeze out in between her hysterical laughter as she bent over and clutched at her stomach. "But this whole situation, i—it's just…
2. Not sure if it came across the way I wanted, but yes, Draco has PTSD from the fiendfyre incident. So for him to step directly into it is a very big thing.
"Potter. Longbottom. Do you need the table?" He ignored the death glare that Pansy was shooting him from across the table and swept some of their books aside to make room for the other two Slytherins.
Their lips were still joined when Draco parted her legs again and finally pushed into her tight, wet warmth. Aria immediately closed her eyes, gasping as she felt a whole new wave of pleasurable tremors threatening to overwhelm her all at once at the feeling of him entering her for the first time. She sighed in relief and arched against him, wrapping her legs tightly around his waist to draw him closer and lock their bodies together.
he said about you was true; that's my point! Don't you get it?!" Neville suddenly exploded, causing Aria to wince at the uncharacteristic anger she heard in her friend's voice. "And not only am I angry at that tosser for talking about you like that, I'm
Unfortunately, as they continued to spend more and more of their free time together, everyone began to notice the 'cold war' that was undoubtedly building up between two of their housemates.
"Hannah, I er…I'm not so sure I'm comfortable giving you advice about something as personal as your sex life. It's a little creepy, to be honest." She admitted, wincing.
Draco heard Pansy and Blaise's panicked shouts when Aria finally reached him and bent down, pointing her wand directly over his heart.
It took some time, but when she managed to calm herself down, she looked up and felt a wave of relief when she noticed that Draco had completely backed away from her. He stood a couple of feet from where she sat on the ground, an impassive look on his face as he leaned one shoulder against a tree and watched her with narrowed gray eyes.
"Give me the notebook, Skeeter." Aria repeated in a much harsher voice this time, her fingers tightening threateningly around the older woman's arm. "I won't ask you again."
left my finger." Draco drawled in a bored tone of voice, growing a little impatient at her questions. "Why are you so interested in this anyway? Do you want one for yourself? Protection against the stalkers in your fan club, maybe?" He sneered at the nonplussed expression on her face and rolled his eyes. "If you want one that badly, I saw a couple of cheap talismans in Knockturn Alley that provide a similar kind of protection. Probably not as strong or comprehensive as mine is but—"
They kept up with this silent cleaning routine for awhile, with Aria also taking charge of cleaning most of the dust and grime along the walls and windows and Pansy focusing on charming the floors with wax and then later wiping down the tables and chairs.
She paused when she noticed the way Draco clenched his jaw at her words, but when he tried to tilt her chin up so he could look into her face, Aria's expression shuttered and she gently pushed his hand away.
In the blink of an eye, Fleur tucked her wings back behind her shoulders and turned around, her high heels clacking loudly as she walked back to her desk. She motioned with her wand, causing a small piece of chalk to float up into the air and start writing a couple of strange-looking names on the blackboard.
From personal experience, Aria knew that he was usually the mastermind in all of the other Slytherins' underhanded schemes after all. So if he was involved, was he the one who told Blaise or Pansy to do it?
Thoughts like why, of all people, would Potter ever be interested in him when for the last seven years, he did nothing but torment her and make her life at Hogwarts miserable? In fact, veela or not, why would Aria Potter even look at him? He was a Death Eater, a coward, and a traitor. All throughout the war, he did nothing but cry and hide in the shadows like the pathetic simp he was.
"Aren't there any laws in place to protect against this sort of abuse from happening? Or laws in general to protect veelas from being abused?" He asked.
Draco gritted his teeth as he inwardly reminded himself that he was a Malfoy and a Malfoy did not have brawls in dingy, backwater pubs like some dirty, ill-mannered charlatan.
"Oui." Fleur agreed with a nod before turning to give the class an apologetic look. "Je suis désolée. I have an important meeting with my associates at Gringotts later so I cannot stay for the entire lesson. But as the Headmistress suggested, I will be able to give you a brief opening
"Well, what do you want me to say?! I'm sorry I kept your feather, Potter." She set the basket of muffins down onto the foot of Aria's bed and huffed, crossing her arms over her chest. "Back then, when I decided to keep it, I didn't exactly have the best opinion of you. And to be quite honest, I was actually planning to use it to make you embarrass yourself."
As she scoured her gaze through the many different crowds of students, Aria couldn't help but be amused at all of the interesting pairings she saw — a surprising mixture of couples from different houses.
"He's been placed in a temporary holding cell in the Ministry until they decide what the proper charges are to be filed against him." Hermione told her.
I told you I could handle him and that I had everything under control! That asshole wasn't even worth the attention!" Pansy snapped again. "But
"Hey, I wasn't the only one who thought she was a fraud. It was all over the Daily Prophet!" He countered huffily, lifting his chin and meeting their gazes with a defiant glare. "Besides, Minister Fudge told my father that—"
Draco's eyes narrowed as he flicked his gaze back and forth between the two girls. His suspicions were immediately confirmed when he felt a trickle of glee filter down through his and Aria's mate bond. Since he was pretty sure that he wasn't feeling particularly gleeful about anything, Draco realized that the feeling was Aria's — and he
"You could say that. We're actually on our second round of drinks." Zacharias Smith answered, taking a sip from his bottle of beer. "Speaking of which, Zabini's spent the last hour trying to teach Hannah here how to drink alcohol properly." He smirked, chuckling.
As Hannah gushed and began talking animatedly with Astoria about her wedding suppliers, Zach shook his head and turned his attention to Neville.
Theo opened his mouth to answer but before he could say anything, the doors behind them suddenly slid open. They both looked up just in time to see Pansy strut out of the common room, dragging a blushing Hannah along behind her. As they approached, Draco couldn't help but notice that Hannah looked very different from how she usually looked.
Draco's eyebrows furrowed angrily at her reaction and he used his free hand to remove her goggles and the protective gear covering her face, tossing them away.
"Ron, is that you? Are you with Hermione right now?" Aria asked, confused. "I thought you two were going to spend Christmas separately this year?"
"Baking is one of the few 'womanly' things that Pansy is actually good at. Every now and then, when she's been possessed or in a particularly good mood, she goes down to the kitchens, chases away the house elves and bakes some random pastry. Unfortunately, her baking skills aren't enough to land her a boyfriend." Blaise quipped, smirking when Pansy turned to level him with a scathing glare.
"Really? What did he do?" Aria asked curiously as they finally made it to the ground floor and began heading in the direction of the Great Hall.
"Come on, Neville." Aria looked completely unaffected by Draco's accusing glare as she leaned back down, pulling Neville back to his feet. Draco let out a long suffering sigh but eventually resumed his position on Neville other side, supporting him as they walked.
"Yes, I was just getting to that." Wood stood up, vanished, and reappeared once more at the very front of the room. He ignored the disoriented looks on everyone's faces and stood in front of the teacher's table, leaning backwards against it.
"Anyway—" She didn't wait for him to respond as she began backing carefully away from him. "—I'd better go. I'll see you around, Malfoy."
The rest of their afternoon proved to be uneventful after that, and Draco was more than a little disappointed when, after the Slytherins finished setting up all the Yule Ball decorations and settled back into the common room, he realized he was too exhausted to do anything other than sink down onto one of the couches, pull Aria onto his lap and bury his face into her neck.
students, usually 6th years or 7th years who witnessed her horrifying plunge during the quidditch game and wanted her to get better as soon as possible. She
She held both of her hands up and met his crazed eyes with a steady gaze. "It's me you want, right? We can talk and settle this somewhere else — away from all of these people."
"Have I mentioned how much I love your breasts?" Draco teased as he pulled away, smirking at her aroused expression.
He stopped in front of her, completely out of breath as he bent down and rested his hands on his knees.
"That's private." Neville added, slanting his gaze over to Blaise and meeting the other boy's wicked grin with a warning look.
She knelt down, one of her gloved hands reaching out to caress the rough patch of dirt and grass on the ground.
Blaise cast a quick, warning glare at the way Zach was blatantly staring at their new guest before he spoke in a helplessly amused voice.
Blaise in the Common Room, was going out of her way to avoid them outside of classes, spending most of her time with her old Hufflepuff housemates.
"—that's it for the special announcements. I wish you all good luck for the upcoming school year." McGonagall finished as she looked up from her clipboard and gave them all an encouraging nod. "The new first years will have been sorted by now so you may proceed to the Great Hall for dinner. Afterwards, I'll have your respective house prefects escort you to your new dormitories."
there is no plan." Draco cut him off sharply, causing all three Slytherins to share wary glances. "This year, we keep quiet and avoid drawing any unnecessary attention to ourselves. Is that understood?"
Sometime later, as Aria was about to rejoin them at the table, Hannah suddenly called out to her in a worried voice before making her way over to where Aria was standing.
"Are you upset about the match? Because it doesn't matter if we lost, you know." Pansy ignored Blaise's antics as she brought her attention back to Draco, trying to console him. "That was just our first game against Gryffindor anyway, we're bound to get another rematch against them." She told him.
I think." He said wryly, taking another sip from his flask. "But they've been dancing around each other's feelings for years now. Frankly, I think the only reason they've been holding back is because Astoria's father really wants to match her with Draco."
did. I mean, there were a lot of us back then, I wouldn't blame you if you've forgotten everyone's names—"
thick-framed glasses - even more hideous than the pair she used to wear back in their third year. She still wore those hideous glasses
When she finally looked up and noticed him standing there, Aria's eyes widened and a light tinge of pink stained her cheeks.
Astoria all had to look away, their shoulders shaking in an obvious attempt not to laugh. She shrugged, returning Skeeter's accusing glare with an overly sweet, innocent smile.
"You obviously hated the idea of having a mate. So why did you even do it anyway? Did you make me your mate because you felt sorry for me? Is that what this is about?"
"Draco?" Pansy leaned forward and waved her hand a few times in front of him, trying to rouse him from his thoughts. "Are you okay? Do you even hear me right now?
"Do you really think it's that simple? I just told you that we were enemies, didn't I? Set aside the fact that we were on opposite sides during the war, I have no bloody idea if she feels the same way about me." Draco retorted, glowering at her as though he thought she was the most ignorant person alive. "Besides, I'm pretty sure she's already rejected me anyway. She told me she doesn't trust me."
Draco hummed in approval and kissed her over and over again until Aria's skin began to glow a faint, shimmering yellow.
"Whether I join the Slytherin quidditch team or not is none of your business. I don't owe you, or the rest of the goddamn wizarding world, anything. I did, after all, already defeat a dark lord last year for all your ungrateful asses. So frankly, I can do whatever the hell I want with my life now. And if you – or anybody else – expect anything more from me, you can all go to hell."
worthy of her? You pathetic little bloodsucker?!" Draco managed to wheeze out, drawing Bentley's attention away from Aria back to him.
They laughed quietly at each other, their actions accidentally jostling Neville a few times that he hiccuped and jerked awake in confusion.
He cleared his throat and reached over, clapping Draco lightly on the shoulder. "Good luck; and let me know how it turns out. Oh and it goes without saying that I expect to be your Best Man, by the way."
Aria's expression shuttered and she used a powerful gust of veela magic to shove the other girl away from her.
have a date to the Yule Ball already." She told him, frowning when she saw the way Bentley's eyes darkened with displeasure at her words. "So unfortunately, I don't think I can go with you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go—"
"I probably should have mentioned it during practice last time, but seeing as you were the only girl on the team, it must have slipped my mind." Draco looked up from his plate, and turned to her with a curious look. "As captain, I'm obliged to tell you that it would be best if you kept your hair tied really well during the game. Not only would it be a horrible distraction, but it could also be dangerous. In fact, you should consider cutting it shorter."
"And you didn't answer my question, Potter. Do you want some company?" He asked, trying his best to keep the expression on his face as nonchalant as he could.
"Oh, this is so wicked! I've always wanted to meet a veela!" She blurted out happily, ignoring Blaise and Draco's amused snorts as she reached out and began poking incessantly at Aria's shoulders. "So how do your wings retract? Can you fly? Your true form was so pretty, by the way! How does the veela allure work? Is that why you always keep your hair tied up?"
sake, Aria." She shook her head to herself in disapproval before striding purposefully into the room and plopping down onto one of the plush armchairs across her friend.
by the way. But in that case, I was happy regardless because it meant I could finally escape all the responsibility in my life. Second, I could actually succeed in killing the bastard responsible for it all and then
For some strange reason he couldn't understand, Draco was becoming more and more uncomfortable with the discussion as it went on. He forced himself to listen as Morag raised her hand again and answered Fleur's question.
Her voice broke as she stared imploringly at him, and for a moment, Draco tried to understand her; he tried to understand all of the unspoken thoughts and the fear that lingered in those beautiful green eyes of hers; hiding all of the important things that needed to be said and he wanted desperately to understand.
exactly but my dad just floo-called me and told me to not cause any trouble or attract any attention right now." He told them, shrugging.
"So I guess that means the three of us are still in Slytherin then." Blaise mused as he stared at Draco and Pansy's robes, noting that like him, the other two were still wearing their old Slytherin colors. "To be honest, I don't know if I should feel relieved or disappointed that I didn't get a new house." He drawled.
"Yes." She answered, placing her hands on top of the arm he had wrapped around her waist and caressing his skin. "I actually manifested a few days before you met me in that pub."
"Hmm." Pansy ignored the despondent look on Hannah's face and smirked to herself, meeting Aria's curious expression with a haughty, half-lidded gaze. "I might know someone who's still free. Do you want me to ask if he can take you to the Yule Ball?"
As Pansy flounced back inside, Theo chuckled and turned to Hannah, meeting her embarrassed smile with a lazy grin.
By some stroke of luck, the three of them were able to make it back to the school grounds in one piece.
The blunt nonchalance in Luna's voice caused Draco to scowl at her in confusion. "Most people are trapped by circumstances, after all. And we make do with what we can."
to be exact. But when she revealed herself to him and asked him to be her mate, he rejected her – even after she told him she was pregnant with me. And so after that…" He let his voice trail off, a dark, brooding expression creasing his handsome features.
"Um…Malfoy?" Aria was stifling her own laughter as she glanced at Draco again, noting that the blond Slytherin finally seemed to have come to his senses and was now staring at Aria with wide, mortified gray eyes.
"Then I'll walk you there." Draco insisted again in a firm voice before he called the bartender over. "Here, I'll pay for your drink as well." He added before she could protest, giving her back her money and tossing a few of his own bills over onto the counter.
She avoided the suspicious look on his face and glanced at Blaise, giving him a strange look. When he returned her gaze with a wince and brief shake of his head, Aria acknowledged him with a nod of thanks and
"I repaired my skirt already so you can have this back now, Malfoy." She looked a little embarrassed as he took the sweater from her hands. "Thanks again, by the way. I really appreciate it."
"I see." Morag snapped the book she was holding shut and handed it back to him. "Well, you won't find any book on Ancient Veelish here. All of them are actually being kept in the Restricted Section of the library." She told him.
my fellow veelas. The statements you published were just biased and completely unjustified. Did you even research any of them?" Aria pointed out.
me to correct him! It was obviously a misunderstanding!" She argued, glaring at him as though he was insane. "Don't pretend like the very idea of us being together is some sort of dream come true for you either, Malfoy. You were always very vocal about how much you despised me!" She pointed out.
Everyone turned to watch as the wedding entourage finally made their entrance into the reception area.
"Trust me." She reached across the table, placing her gloved hand over his again and giving his fingers another comforting squeeze. "For all you know, she could feel the exact same way about you and not realize it just yet."
He took the syrup of hellebore from Aria's offering hands and they both stiffened as he added it very carefully to their mixture, both of them watching with wide eyes and bated breath as the potion seemed to sizzle for a minute before a thin, silvery vapour began to evaporate from the liquid's turquoise blue surface.
"Of course." Blaise snickered under his breath before he turned and walked off, leaving Aria and Malfoy staring awkwardly at each other from across the wooden table.
Corner's left eye twitched at her words but he continued, ignoring the way Pansy was desperately trying to wriggle out of his arms.
At the disgruntled glare Hannah gave him, Theo flinched, while all the men around the table burst into hearty snickers.
She ignored his grumbled protests and snatched his wrist again and Draco sighed, allowing himself to be dragged along.
"He's doing alright." Ron picked up on her mood easily and his laughter dried out. He sighed and leaned back against his seat, fiddling with his hands. "All things considered, he's holding up pretty well, actually. Well, much better than Mum, I suppose. D'you know that he and Angie met up at the Leaky a few months ago? They're um—" He paused and glanced uncertainly at Aria.
They turned around to see Hermione rushing across the hall towards them. Ron followed closely behind her, but unlike Hermione, he didn't run towards Aria but instead, he headed towards the reporters, throwing himself into the crowd in an attempt to hold them off. When Hermione reached them, she turned her attention to Draco and gave him a sharp look.
Sighing in defeat, she seemed to have sensed he wasn't giving her any room to argue on that because she just gave him an awkward smile and allowed him to lead her out towards the pub's exit. As soon as they had stepped outside, they both adjusted their cloak hoods back up over their heads and began to trudge through the snow in the direction of the train station.
To Draco's relief, the bewildered look on Aria's face quickly melted away. She smiled at them and gave Teddy a piece of pie from the table before turning her attention back to her dinner. After a few minutes, however, Aria paused and looked up again, frowning when she noticed the strange expression that lingered on Draco's face.
"Oh come on now, don't you worry about that." Hagrid dismissed her concerns with a wave of his large hand. "I know that the three of you are busy training to be the big, fancy names you'll surely become after you graduate." When she made a face at that, he chuckled and gave her another reassuring pat on the shoulder. "But of course, you're always welcome to visit anytime. Fang misses you, after all."
, you had to go all reckless Gryffindor and attack him! And because of your stupid little stunt, we both have detention! Are you happy now?! You should have just left it alone!"
"That happy to be chore partners with me for this week, are you?" Blaise was smirking when she looked up and met his teasing gaze. "I didn't know you liked me that way, Potter."
agree to give a public statement." Aria glared dubiously at her. "I'm just supposed to believe that this isn't going to come back and bite me in the ass?" She challenged.
As he spoke, he flicked his eyes up and met Blaise's gaze over Morag's shoulder, both of them smirking when they heard the girls at the next table gasp again and sputter loudly to each other in disbelief. Unfortunately, Morag did
"Speaking of shagging." Hermione shook the embarrassment away from her face and turned to Aria, a smug smile tugging on her lips when she noticed the way Aria stiffened under her scrutinizing gaze. "Do you want to tell us about your Hogsmeade date, Aria?"
She also vaguely remembered participating in the Slytherin – Hufflepuff quidditch match they had a few days ago, and how they almost lost because Draco had refused to acknowledge her during the game, severely crippling their team's strategy.
Pansy cut off the rest of Draco's retort and sneered at him in disgust. "Draco, do you even realize that you're playing with not one but
graduated; and that she was looking forward to going out on a proper date with him this coming Yule break.
When he finally made it to the classroom, he caught sight of a couple of his female classmates hovering by the entrance, squealing and giggling amongst themselves as they peered through the doors. Glancing around the room, Draco walked over to his usual seat beside Neville and Pansy and gave them a curious look.
Aria made a strangled noise, and all she could do in that moment was to moan pleadingly and reach for him, her eyes blurry with tears of drunken need and lust.
When she looked up again, she found it strange how Bentley was staring at her with a mixture of frustration and stunned astonishment written all over his face. Aria's eyes hardened and she leveled him with a suspicious glare.
Aria smiled at him and leaned up, pressing a feather-light kiss against his lips. Before she could pull away, Draco wrapped an arm around her waist and took advantage of their closeness by leaning down and pressing his mouth against hers in another kiss. As their tongues met, Draco hummed and traced seductive circles along the exposed skin of her waist below her shirt.
"I can't believe you've been hiding these from me all this time." He murmured in a suggestive voice. "It's a shame to keep them covered up like this."
"This is where it happened, isn't it?" He swallowed the dry lump in his throat, watching the myriad of emotions running through her face. "This is where you faced him?"
know that we'll have an opening for Seeker soon. Is that something you'd be interested in? Because we'd love to have you join us."
She crawled towards her, her hands shaking as she felt desperately around Hermione's neck for a pulse. Her eyes blurred with tears of relief when she found one, however weak it was. Biting her lip, she bent down, trying to gather Hermione's unconscious form into her arms when Bentley caught her ankle in another bind, sneering as he pulled her closer towards him. Aria hissed back at him, and she let her features twist into a cruel-beaked, bird face as she tried to wrestle herself away.
“Of course, sir.” Harry took his textbook out of his cauldron and held it up. “Just about to get started.”
“Have it your way, then,” he said, sitting back in his chair. He couldn’t help but gaze over at Harry, who was tapping his wand smartly against his textbook.
“That’s right!” Harry’s enthusiasm was infectious. They went on to identify Cepheus, Perseus, and Ursa Major.
“Yes. Sorry.” He checked his satchel one more time to make sure that the velvet pouch was still there—by now, it was a habit he couldn’t shake—before hastily passing by her and making his way to the entrance hall. This had to stop. He needed to avoid Potter and just get through this year so that he could finally be free of this place and the dangers that constantly seemed to plague him. He wished, not for the first time, that he could just be normal, just a regular Hogwarts student who had a nice girlfriend that he brought to meet his nice, normal parents just like everyone else. A normal student whose father wasn’t constantly in the papers. Since September, he had listened to the others go on about their internships, and he longed for their problems: Pansy and Blaise complained that Slughorn spent most of the time bragging about famous witches and wizards he had met, while Daphne bemoaned the complicated work Vector set her. They were all planning for their futures, using their internships as a means of making connections and honing skills that would serve them in their careers. Meanwhile, he was saddled with Potter, and they were apparently only capable of vacillating between trying to kill each other and trying to snog each other. He had spent countless nights wondering what it was like to go to bed and be kept up by mundane worries like an upcoming quiz or an overdue paper.
He snorted. As she snapped her organizer shut, Daphne looked over at the others, who were ambling out of the common room. “Draco,” she said in a low voice. “Can I ask you something?”
“Er…well, I thought about jewelry. But we only just started seeing each other, and that seemed a bit…”
“That’s right. The Headmistress wants us to sit down with the eighth years to discuss their internships,” he said.
As far as potions went, Skele-Gro was quite simple to prepare. They filled the cauldrons with tepid water, and then Draco instructed Pansy to gently slide the ingredients off the cutting board and into each cauldron as he stirred clockwise. She was about to bring them to the boil when Draco stopped her—“No, look, you need to wait ten minutes.”
Unnerved, Draco reached into the wardrobe and took out his robes. The solution was…what, then? To push Harry away? To assume the worst of everyone? He was tired of being afraid. It was exhausting, keeping his guard up out of the fear that he might be let down again. The logical part of him knew that Harry was nothing like his parents, nothing like Macnair. They couldn’t have been more different. But the entire thing was just so
They found a mat of bearberry shrubs easily enough. Blaise conjured three pillows and they sat in the grass together, pulling out their sketchbooks. Draco felt a fresh wave of guilt when he spotted the torn corner of his thistle drawing. Ashamed, he turned the page, hoping the other two hadn’t noticed. They sketched quietly, the silence broken only by the sound of dry leaves as the wind swept through. It was a beautiful autumn day: the sky was blue, dotted with thin, snaky clouds. Draco sketched the little red berries as they jostled together in the breeze.
If his words stung, Potter didn’t show it; slightly breathless, his cheeks pink, he reached out and grasped Draco’s arm, startling him. “Where are you going?”
Draco felt a strange warmth spreading from the top of his head. It was almost as though someone was gently pouring a cup of water onto him; he shuddered as the warmth trickled down to his shoulders. The base of his skull tingled. It should have been unpleasant, but it wasn’t, not really—on the edges of consciousness, he found himself uncharacteristically unbothered.
“He was about to hex you!” Blaise cried, indignant. “Hex someone who doesn’t even have their wand on them, who’s
His hands nearly numb from the cold, Draco angled the tip of the broom downwards and landed gracefully. He could have cast a Warming Charm, but the cold was bracing. After storing the Comet back into the broomshed, he checked his wristwatch, and saw that it was nearly time for lunch. He was surprised to find that he had a bit of an appetite—a rare thing these days. He set off for the castle, wondering if he would have time before Charms to return a book to the library, when suddenly he saw Callidus swooping down towards him. He was about to call out to remind him that he didn’t have his leather gauntlet but, well-trained as always, Callidus soared low and let the parchment drop from his talons. He wheeled around and then set off for the West Tower.
Harry looked up at him, surprised. “I mean, there’s Ron. But he’s barely keeping it together as it is.” Giving him a rueful smile, he added, “He’d kill me, if he knew I was telling you all this.”
This was technically true. Over the years, Draco had been forced to sit through countless retellings of her ridiculous escapades.
“I hope so.” Draco tugged down his sleeve. Checking to see that they hadn’t been spotted, he gently pulled her forward along the path. “Potter thinks it should.”
Gazing up at the members of the Wizengamot—several of whom he recognized from his own trial—Draco nearly missed the only person who was not wearing plum robes: his mother.
Of course, Potter ignored him, gingerly picking up his cup of tea before settling into his favourite armchair. He had his copy of
” He knew that he was at Potter’s mercy—that he needed to be calm, reasonable. But it was almost impossible to douse the anger swelling up inside him.
The look on his father’s face was terrifying. He shut his eyes and said, in a dangerously soft voice, “Draco. You
or something. Anyway,” he gave a short laugh, “you don’t care about all this. The point is, Ron’s cross with me, and Ginny—she isn’t angry, really, just awkward. And Hermione’s dating Ron, so she’s trying not to take sides. And then they bring all of this to Quidditch practice, and, yeah…” In a sardonic tone, Potter added, “It’s great, telling someone they need to pass the Quaffle when they won’t even look at you.”
He felt rather like a dog on a lead as she hurried them down the path. “Are we in a rush to be somewhere?”
“What are you doing?” Pansy asked, watching as he crumpled the parchment in his fist and shoved it into his pocket.
“I wouldn’t be up at midnight, in the middle of the Forbidden Forest, helping some prat,” Potter teased him.
“Yeah?” Draco settled onto the pillow, urging himself to relax. The last time. Those words were not as encouraging as they might have been months ago.
“Here, Ron, help me.” The next thing Draco knew, Harry was supporting him on one side, Weasley on the other, and they lifted him to his feet. He wobbled, but Harry tucked his arm around him.
“It was about him,” Draco gasped. The air was chilly as it rushed into his lungs. “Wasn’t it? V-Voldemort. I can still see him, his face…”
“How are you?” Pansy asked excitedly. “You look great!” Turning to Blaise and Draco, she said, “Doesn’t he look great?”
Something in Nott’s face shifted as their eyes briefly met, but then he looked away angrily. “I’m sorry, Draco. But my father…he’s old. He won’t survive in Azkaban. And I can’t bear for…” He swallowed thickly. “He’s all I have left. So, goodbye, Draco.” And with that, he shut the door.
“I’m going to miss you, Draco!” His vision was clouded by a mass of black hair as Pansy crashed into him, throwing her arms around his neck.
“Now.” Proudfoot shifted in his seat. “I wanted to talk to you about your plans after Hogwarts.” Draco was barely able to mask his relief. So this wasn’t about Potter after all. “I know you would usually discuss this sort of thing with your Head of House, but, well…Professor Slughorn told me that your last meeting with him was…tense. And I suppose I’ve taken a bit of an interest in you. You remind me of myself, sometimes.”
They parted at the entrance hall, heading to their respective common rooms to grab their broomsticks and winter clothes. By the time they arrived at the pitch, it was very dark out.
“Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Malfoy,” Diggle was tutting. “I warned you not to outdo yourself. This isn’t a Dueling Club, boys.”
“We’re going to my parents’ afterwards,” Theo informed them. He brought his arm to rest around Lavender’s chair. “And then Lav’s tomorrow, for Christmas morning.”
Draco turned his head to the side, absolutely refusing. If he looked, he would be undone. The edges of his sanity were already fraying as it was; he needed to keep
“Pansy’s always been a clever girl,” Draco’s mother said mildly as she picked up her menu. “Oh, good, they have salmon, I wanted something light.”
As Blaise studied him with his dark, clever eyes, Draco felt as though he was being opened up for examination. Finally, he said, “You’re overthinking. Everyone could see how Potter looked at you today. I know you think you don’t deserve this, but you do.” He paused. Draco had the sense that he was supposed to respond, but he couldn’t make his mouth work. When he merely sat there, staring stupidly, Blaise sighed. “Talk to him. Tell him. You’re going to miss your chance, and then Pansy and I will have to listen to you whine about it for the next ten years.”
As they arrived in the entrance hall, Draco made for the staircase, but Proudfoot gently took his elbow and steered him towards the dungeons. “To your common room, I think. Lead the way.”
Draco waited for Proudfoot to move on to the next pair before asking Pansy in a low voice, “What have I done this time?”
Draco looked over and saw that Weasley was crouched down next to Harry, frowning. That was strange, he decided. And Granger was on his other side, face full of concern. That, perhaps, was even stranger.
“Oh, no, no,” Theo assured her. “He wasn’t transformed when he bit her.” His face took on an uncharacteristically resolute expression as he said, “But still. It wouldn’t bother me, even if she did.”
“Really, Potter? A bit forward, aren’t you?” He tried his best to sneer, but his heart wasn’t in it.
“It’ll be fine. I’ll be fine.” He checked his wristwatch and then rose abruptly, startling Pansy. “Come on, I need to get back. I’m meeting him at nine in the entrance hall.”
Harry leaned forward and trailed his arm across Draco’s chest, resting their foreheads together. “I’m sorry,” he muttered.
He looked put out. “I’ve been asking around for you since term started. Everyone says you’re at the library, but I haven’t seen you.”
“It’s nice to see you all,” Lavender said, fixing her earmuffs as she pulled away from Blaise. The scar on her face shone pink in the sunlight.
more attractive than Potter. He told himself this, hammering it into his head dully as he stared at his fingers, thinking about how they had traced Potter’s jawline. He could remember Potter’s stubble, rubbing not unpleasantly under his palms. And when they had kissed the second time, Potter had moaned—a low, primal sound, as though he couldn’t help himself, as though he felt in the pit of his stomach what Draco also felt. The only silver lining in all this was that whenever he thought of that strange hour with Potter in the Room of Requirements, the anxiety that usually constricted his chest lifted.
Harry groaned. “It sounds stupid, when you say it like that. But I guess…Not really figuring out who I am, but what I’m going to spend the rest of my life doing. I’ve never really had the time to think about it. And near the end of the war, honestly, I sort of knew. Knew that…”
“Alright.” Who was Draco going to tell? It wasn’t as though he spoke to Daphne’s sister, or anyone else who might be interested in her career ambitions.
As Draco entered the clearing, he had a fairly good idea which memory they were about to witness. He just knew. Every little nerve in his body was sharp, sharp, sharp, prickling against his flesh. There had been plenty to be anxious about over the years, but he had always managed to tuck it away. To compartmentalize. To avoid. And now it seemed that everything was coming to the fore. It had been so much easier before, when he had alternated between anger and that uncanny numbness that permeated him.
The Marauder’s Map was an endless source of fascination for Draco. Never before had he seen such a detailed plan of Hogwarts. They often sat together tracing the dots across the map, laughing as they watched Filch chase Peeves around the Trophy Room or whenever they caught Anthony Goldstein spending far too long in the prefects’ bathroom. Harry showed Draco all of the hidden passageways, enjoying his reactions as he learned of Hogwarts’ many secrets. As they leaned over the map, Harry pointed out the tunnel to Honeydukes, explaining how he had managed to sneak into Hogsmeade in third year.
Finally, Harry made his way down Draco’s stomach, past his navel, kissing at his skin as though he meant to cover every inch of it. Draco could hardly breathe. Harry looked so beautiful like this, so impossibly beautiful, eyes closed as he drew a gentle trail of kisses across Draco's hip. Just as he thought Harry was finally going to touch his cock—so hard it ached, so hard it took everything in him not to thrust against Harry’s jumper—Harry smirked and sat up.
He shrugged her off and stared at a spot on the table in front of him. There was a moment of uncomfortable silence, which Daphne broke by saying with a forced cheeriness: “Greg is right. What are you all planning to do after Hogwarts, then?”
Harry shrugged. “I haven’t heard anything from Ron’s dad, or Percy. All they’ve said is that Shacklebolt has it under control.”
Harry said nothing but instead ran his fingers through Draco’s hair. They lay like that until finally, Draco gave in to his drowsiness. For the first time in months—probably years—he slept deeply, hardly dreaming.
After changing into his pyjamas, Draco climbed into bed. He was supposed to be working on a chart for Arithmancy, but he couldn’t be bothered. His head was spinning. It wasn’t even two months into the term yet, and already his world had been flipped upside-down. He wondered where Potter was right now—what he was doing, how he felt, whether or not he was thinking of Draco and all that they had gotten up to. He felt ridiculous, mooning over Potter like a first year, but try as he might he couldn’t get him out of his mind. Visions of Potter ripping down Draco’s pants, taking him in his hand, staring at him with those intense eyes that refused to look away...they all melded together, both exciting and terrifying him. He was curious whether Potter’s friends had accosted him, and if so, what he had said. But perhaps they were all in the know...there was still the chance that this was some queer plot and he was their unsuspecting victim. He still wasn’t sure how he had gotten to this point. To let Potter drag him wherever he wanted, and do whatever he pleased...it went against every bit of dignity he had left. And yet a small voice in his head reminded him that he wanted this. Wanted to be taken, to be ordered around. For some reason it quelled the anxiety that always bubbled just beneath the surface, threatening to overcome him.
“Be honest with me. I’ll know if you’re lying.” Much as he wanted to, Draco refused to look away as Blaise’s dark eyes met his. “Is that where you go at night? To see Potter?”
Harry looked as though he wanted to say something else, but Blaise had his hand on Draco’s shoulder and was leading him to the dungeon. They exchanged a smile and then Harry followed his friends across the hall and up the marble staircase. Draco felt a sharp pang as he watched them go.
you,” Pansy cried. “She’s worried, Draco! Your mother’s not this awful person you make her out to be.”
“Because, if you…if you start…I’ll never be able to…” He shook himself. “Keep practicing your Occlumency. You need to keep practicing. Otherwise, all of this was for nothing.”
“I…” He closed his eyes, trying to calm the deluge of fear that overtook him. “It’s sort of…awful,” he whispered.
“Oh, please don’t cry,” Draco said. His own chest tightened in empathy. “If you cry, I’ll cry, and I look awful when I cry.”
“Who’s this?” Daphne asked, holding up a card for further inspection. “Dorcas Wellbeloved…Founder of the Society for Distressed Witches…huh…”
Nott laughed. “So play it up a bit. Make it sound dramatic. If Draco doesn’t make the right choice, a Chimaera’s going to come and eat him. Or make him sound like a long-suffering soul, wandering through Hogwarts, doomed to be alone. That sounds about right.”
over each other at the Three Broomsticks,” she said, face twisting with disgust. “She didn’t even warn us, either. He met us there and next thing you know, they’re snogging right in front of us.”
They made it to Hogsmeade in record time. Harry peppered Draco with all sorts of questions—who went to these dinners, what did they usually serve, why did they open presents Christmas Eve instead of Christmas Day, how should they behave? Draco answered as best he could, well aware that Harry was trying to distract him from his apprehension. He appreciated the effort.
"Proudfoot’s alright, isn’t he?” said Boot. “Ernie and I are working with him. He’s let us do loads…connected us with one of his old buddies at the Ministry, in the Investigations Department…if I can say so, it’s rather important work. Of course, that’s made Ernie an absolute nightmare to work with…”
Harry shook his head. He still had that gloomy look on his face. Had Draco done something wrong? Silently, Harry took his hand. Draco would have ordinarily resisted—anyone could see them, it wasn’t even curfew yet, there were students everywhere—but, in his panic, he allowed Harry to pull him down the corridor. He only released Draco’s hand once they were at the blank wall opposite Barnabas the Barmy’s tapestry. Draco waited as Harry paced by the wall three times. The moment the door appeared, Harry took Draco’s hand again and led him through the doorway. It was as though he didn’t trust Draco to find his way on his own. He should have been annoyed, but it was oddly touching. He had no idea what Harry had asked for, but the gist of his request was apparent: although he felt nauseous with fear, he couldn’t help but crack a smile at the sight of the giant four-poster bed. There was a fireplace at the centre of the room, crackling merrily away, and a pair of armchairs faced the fire, one scarlet and the other green.
Arriving at the blank space of wall concealing the Slytherin common room, Draco decided that he just wouldn't give the password. His heart fell when Proudfoot said, “Wampus cat.” As the stone door slid open, Proudfoot motioned for him to enter. Nervous, he stepped into the common room, hoping that perhaps one of the few Slytherins who had stayed behind for the holidays might be there. No such luck.
“Sure.” Theo looked as though he knew Draco was being evasive, but they were interrupted by Pansy and Blaise, who pushed through the pub door and out into the cold.
Kreacher and Winky were delighted to see them. They refused to let them go without first stuffing their trunks full of sweets. Harry presented Kreacher with a new pair of oven mitts; they came up to his shoulders, but he seemed very happy. Winky, meanwhile, was ecstatic with her gift of a little blue brooch. She pinned it proudly to her shirt.
Harry gently placed his hands on Draco’s shoulders. “I’m going to hug you. Alright?” Draco nodded, and Harry rose to his knees, pulling Draco against his chest. Slowly, Draco wound his arms around Harry’s waist, hugging him back. He exhaled as he listened to Harry’s heartbeat. It was slow, steady, soothing. And again he felt himself growing calm. Harry was right—Ollivander was well, now, and Draco’s tears wouldn’t change anything. His guilt wouldn’t improve Ollivander’s life, or take away the scars he had endured. Feeling rather foolish, he pulled away, intending to apologize, but Harry held him tight.
Even without most of the Slytherins in attendance, the Room of Requirement was filled with students. It was dark inside, illuminated only by candles floating mid-air, and it took a moment for Draco's eyes to adjust. He had barely stepped through the door when several things happened at once. First, Daphne squealed and race off towards Dean Thomas, who was standing by the trestle table with Finnegan. Second, Draco heard someone call his name. He looked over and, to his surprise, saw Terry Boot waving at him. Not sure what else to do, he was about to head over to greet Boot when Ron Weasley was suddenly storming towards him, face contorted in fury. Before Draco could react, Weasley shoved him. Several people shouted in alarm.
“How should I know what the Wizengamot will and will not believe?” his father snapped. “They’ve got more than enough rope to hang me with.”
Thursday mornings he had double Arithmancy, and Professor Vector was notoriously strict about punctuality. Draco checked his watch, saw that he had fifteen minutes to get to class, and hurried back to the castle. In the entrance hall, he waded through the crowd of students when he suddenly felt a hand grip his forearm. He jumped, whirling around.
