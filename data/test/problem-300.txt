Of course, like everything Granger, it led to relatively quick and effective improvement in their relationship. 'Yes, I'm happy too,' Draco replied.
News about the siege of Potter Manor and the subsequent defeat of its master was spreading like wildfire throughout the Wizarding world. Celebrations began as more soldiers returned to their homes, puffing in pride and smiling despite their injuries. There didn’t seem to be any other subject the townsfolk were interested in and the victorious troops indulged their enthusiasm and patiently quenched their queries. It was, after all, the day they had been waiting for.
He wrapped a hand around Draco's neck and pulled him back, resting his chin on Draco's shoulder and exhaling loudly, 'Ah, young love!'
'Well, Grimmauld is too big for me,' Harry shrugged, leaving a lot unsaid. The girls understood, though.
It was a Thursday in mid March when they were in the eighth year common room, studying together. The others were busy with the upcoming NEWTS while Draco was studying Potter's lips up close, with his own.
'You are not the kind who dumps people without telling them. From Harry's reaction, it's clear he didn't know. So what is it?' Hermione was trying to be quite patient.
He wondered if that time he had been waiting for never came because they weren't meant to be. It was a depressing thought.
May of 1999 was in some way a recollection of all things that a large part of the wizarding populace was trying their hardest to forget or let go since the past twelve months. Hogwarts was no exception.
‘Shit! Dean!’ Sam immediately dropped his gun and shuffled to crouch next to his brother, gently turning him to get a proper look at his face.
Harry raised his brows but nodded and began to go his way. His friends were still arguing behind him. They haven't spent quality time owing to their busy schedules but maybe they could talk this issue out? It could just be stress.
Draco hummed. 'Strong people fall apart the hardest,' he said quietly. 'Mother can get through to her, I'm sure. I'll write to her about it.'
Harry turned to see Draco reading a yellow memo. He had a sinking feeling he knew what it was before Draco confirmed it.
Draco quietly left the classroom, Potter’s hurried footsteps following him; they shouldn’t have bickered. That annoying idiot. Why was he trying to give Draco whatever in her class?
When Draco left the room, Harry sank onto his bed, his hand unconsciously going to the tattoo on his chest. Either Harry was reading wrong or there was a finality in the air.
'Sometimes, Harry,' Luna said, thoughtfully, 'we may be able to co exist with those we hate but not possibly live with those we love.'
Andromeda was bullshitting about them being unexpected, of course. There were four packages sitting under the Christmas tree, a glaring reminder of the white lie.
'You and me both,' Pansy replied, pretending to rub her temples. 'Nights were at least better because of those Silencing charms and stuff.'
‘Yeah,’ Dean agreed, tossing one of his shirts into a duffel bag. ‘We had enough on our hands here.’ Before Sam could even frown at the neutral reply, Dean shot a look at Cas again. ‘Which is why we’d like to get some extra time for resting.’
‘Interesting,’ Sherlock said, leaning forward. ‘Was there a specific reason their cottage didn’t have magical means of travel? Is it to avoid detection by the villagers?’
'.... so to get Draco out of his petulant mood, I've organised a picnic for us. You'll enjoy it, Dray, don't worry. The resort is big and known for its discretion so even if we get caught with the "services I availed", we're fine. Isn't that right?' Smith curled his hand around Draco's waist and pulled him in, him and his cronies snickering lewdly at his crass joke.
He's truthful for once. 'I don't know. Half of it is the neck, though.' He bends his neck again and this time an audible snap releases. Harry's beyond happy. It's going to settle Ron. For now. Ron always looks like he suspects, and Harry thinks he really does, but he doesn't ask and Ron doesn’t tell.
'Hold your stone like this,' he said, taking Draco's wrist and wrapping his fingers around the stone. Harry could feel Draco's pulse racing madly. 'Now you flick it,' he motioned and let Draco release the stone. It skipped thrice before dunking in.
After the third time when Draco and Smith were sitting in the common room with hardly any space between them, heads together and laughing, at one in the morning, Harry was sure something was afoot.
Granger frowned at Draco and Potter, sometime later. 'You two can't slack off just because you've finished.'
‘He had been a promising student. Chief Weasley and several others often rated him higher than Young Master. It all must have got to his head. It should be why he deviated to the path of Dark,’ the first soldier said.
Luna's been humming a song Harry never heard of since he entered her room and it finally stops. Her questions so far have been:
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw that Neville looked ready to pounce, Dean and Seamus restraining him with their combined strength. Harry took a deep breath and walked towards the podium.
It was a quiet evening some ten days before Halloween. Most of the eighth years had gone to the Black Lake or Hogsmeade or were just wandering the castle, taking the evening off to themselves.
Harry's not hearing it for the first time. Though Grace never repeated herself, she reiterated this same point to him time and again, just not in as many words. Harry has to wonder if his mistrust in her started with this. Relationships of all kinds fall or form on this delicate foundation and it needs to hold out till the end especially between a Healer and their patient. That much, he's sure, is obvious even to the Dementors. He wasn't scared of Grace going public with his info. She was known to deal with high profile celebrities and was famous for her discretion. No, the reason Harry switched Healers (again) was because he no longer believed she could help him. It was always like this- he'd come a certain way with each Healer and one day he'd just up and cancel his prescription with them. Grace was the only one who made any real progress and yet, it was all the same.
Draco grabbed him by his collar and pushed him against the wall. 'I do! Of course, I do. Because the first person I wanted to see and hug, the only person I wanted to console me, the only person I wanted to reassure me, fucking stopped speaking to me the moment I returned from the funeral. Like he couldn't even look me in the eye.'
Harry didn't want to sing in front of Draco but Teddy woke up when he had sat and Harry had no choice.
Or maybe it was just the shock of something so brilliant that rendered them all speechless. It wasn't exactly news to Draco. He had overheard Goldstein and Longbottom talking about gardening and had joined them with tips he learned from unwillingly helping his mother out. Longbottom came up with his idea then and soon they had formed what others started calling "The Green Group."
‘No. I’m going to let John Davies take that credit. He needs to pay for what he did. Also, it will be a sure fire way of pulling them off the line of questioning. They won’t like to admit that they failed to properly evaluate a now convicted fraudster.’
Blaise laughed, slapping his thigh. 'This,' he said in between bouts of laughter, 'is exactly what she meant. Normally, a stinging hex would have been your answer.'
First to arrive had been his mother's owl with the Ministry's letter that informed them of Lucius' passing in his cell. Draco couldn't read past the first four sentences, the ground shaking beneath his feet. Lucius Malfoy's imprisonment was coming to an end in two months. He'd been fined and banned from using magic, barring the most basic spells, for life. Truthfully, Draco and Narcissa had been happy with that.
Draco craned his neck too, excited and eager. It was a simple tattoo of a fox sleeping curled up, it's tail tucked in with its hind legs. Decorating its head, almost as if it was a crown, was a small flame.
‘So, this magical school you say is a boarding school?’ John asked, lifting his pen up from the notepad he was pretending to write the details on. He had a strong feeling that he didn’t need to refer to his notes to recount such a terribly insane tale. It was already implanted in his head.
Blaise wanted to blame Pansy. She had unnecessarily involved them both in a mess that wasn’t related to them.
'It's bullshit that Potter didn't know, Granger. He made it abundantly clear in the weeks past that he no longer wants this. Us.'
'I didn't know what to get for you,' Draco mumbled, rocking on his heels. Behind Potter he spotted a radiant Granger hugging Weasley and talking his ear off about the book in her hand.
‘It will surely help when I doze off in Professor Seth’s class tomorrow. I can already hear her say, “Out!”’
Longbottom went on but Draco didn't hear it. He recognised those flowers. His mother loved to garden after all. Hearing it confirmed from their resident Herbologist made him snap his eyes to Potter's wonderfully blushing face.
‘But please, Mr.Holmes. I implore you to do something in this case. I want my Nancy back. She didn’t even get to see the world.’ Tears rolled down her face as she hastily tried to wipe them away. John pushed the box of tissues he always kept on the side for exactly these situations, towards the weeping woman.
'Dragon Lilies?' Harry cut in. Draco's mouth closed shut, as if only then realising. 'I hate Smith, Draco. I hated that you had time for him but not me. You behaved as if you didn't want this. You had time to play Snap before NEWTS but when I needed to talk to you, "personal things had to wait"? I was only giving you an easy out.'
McGonagall approached them then. 'I see that your plants are growing,' she said without preamble. 'Yes, Professor,' Luna replied in awe. The smiles on their faces grew as they watched more shoots push up from the ground. The tiny leaves sparkled as the floodlights caught the water on their surfaces.
Harry likes how he can always count on his children to bring randomness into his routine. Once upon a time, it was the extra morsel of food he ate without the Dursleys knowing, then it was Voldemort and after him was Ginny. Like it or not, Harry is forced to acknowledge that it has been some time since life with Ginny became monotonous.
Finnigan turned fully in his seat, eyes narrowing at Thomas' hand before quietly wrenching his fingers away one by one.
Two hours later, Harry groaned and banged his head against his desk. He had only managed to fill three pages so far and just eyeing the rest of the file made him want to Incendio the damned thing. One look at the opposite table told him his partner was in a far better place with three completed folders adorning his desk and humming happily to himself as he worked through the fourth one. Harry didn’t understand why they were doing this when there were seven unsolved cases waiting for them to pounce on though the slightly rational part of his brain supplied that they were benched as a punishment. From what Harry could judge, he wasn’t going to complete the paperwork anytime soon, let alone that very day, which meant he had to bail out on his blind date, again. He hoped Hermione wouldn’t kill him.
‘We’d avoid you if we could, trust us,’ said Pansy Parkinson, crossing her arms. Behind her, Blaise Zabini looked hopeful. Draco Malfoy tried not to make eye contact.
'So Harry, if you had to choose two people, two things and two situations you'd like to hate and resent, what would they be?'
‘The dead do not show such characteristics. They are driven by their motives and needs. Hunters, over the years, have developed and compiled their standard methods of subjugation.’
‘It was across the road in a lane on the other side of the park,’ Ms.Hope answered. ‘One of Mr.Lestrade’s constables spotted her with a man.’
Dean spluttered and spit out his burger just as Cas started snickering loudly. Sam glanced up at his brother and threw him a winning smile.
'And, are you?' Potter asked, wrapping his warm arms around Draco. That's how things were between them now.
‘This way,’ she said and led them down a hallway. Harry heard Ginny mention she was here to see Luna but was preoccupied in sending a Patronus to Malfoy. He gave a passing thought to his friends’ words from earlier on and then dismissed it quickly. This was Auror business, after all.
Important members (royalty)- Tom Riddle Jr., Seamus Finnigan, Daphne Greengrass, James Sirius, Mary Thomas (Dean Thomas' mother)
John added hysterical and clumsy to his mental list, idly wondering if the loss of her niece resulted in a loss of her cerebral function as well. After all, overwhelming grief could stop hearts, brains were nothing, he reasoned.
'I'm NOT going to feed you tomorrow when Potter's not home!' Draco knew it was ineffective. He suspected the dog even flicked his ears.
,' Ron objected, trying and failing to hold back his smile. Hermione rolled her eyes at him in fond exasperation.
Harry hummed and sighed. His gaze was still on the moon determinedly playing hide and seek with him. Harry observed that the glow was a more muted white that day. He gave a tiny smile, kissed Draco's temples and burrowed into his blankets.
‘The facts, if you please, Ms.Hope,’ Sherlock said, not wanting to waste any more time, when their guest relaxed enough, ‘John here tells me you think your niece was kidnapped right before your eyes.’
'Bobby will drop by at 5 in the evening. What about the armory?' Sam asked, turning around from his luggage to the staring contest between Dean and Cas.
John coughed, took a sip of his tea and cleared his throat. ‘What do you mean by a witch, Ms.Hope? A sorceress who deals with voodoo and spirits and stuff or a magician who performs tricks?’
‘Okay, maybe I didn’t. But if that is the account of an eyewitness, what choices do we have? She must have been drunk, delirious, dreaming or demented. And I don’t think she would have dreamt of her niece going missing, though her supposed theories could very well be a result of her dreams that, according to you, have proved to be as eccentric as the lady herself.’
'Objectively, I know that black, white and grey exist. But I can't differentiate them in reality. People were being nice for the first time. Their intentions, my actions and their consequences all got lost in translation.'
‘Nothing,’ Sam shrugged nonchalantly, ‘just having a hard time understanding how two seasoned hunters got winded just putting a ghost down. Because in the seven years that Dean has been in this field, this is his first time with a ghost, right?’
He jogged to catch up with the rest of them as they entered Parvati’s private office. His mind was swirling with colliding thoughts regarding Hermione’s abrupt insistence on blood analysis. Hermione’s usual habit was to exhaust every resource she had before she contacted the Healers for their help. In his seven years of Auror service, Harry had never heard her directly referring to them. He raised a curious brow in her direction as they settled in their seats. She shook her head at him and continued going through her hastily written notes.
Ron looked at him wide eyed, his face as pale as Draco’s skin. Harry decided not to point it out because he doubted either of the two would appreciate the comparison.
Hermione shook her head and exhaled loudly. Ron’s assumptions were baseless. He was making an issue out of nothing. It now started affecting the Slytherins. Whatever. She shrugged and picked her book up.
'VIPERS!' Potter laughed, falling out of his chair and clutching his stomach for good measure. 'Grass snakes. That's who you are!'
'Means a lot,' Ginevra said, barely keeping it together. 'Excuse me,' she whispered and then she was exiting the common room, Draco's eyes trained on her till the door shut behind her.
'Dumbledore believed in second chances,' Harry said, slowly sweeping his gaze over the assembly. 'So do I.' He went over to Blaise and held his hand.
'Strange why my mind conjured that when I was clearly receiving them,' Draco went on, deliberately riling Potter up.
‘I think he’s reverted to his “Malfoy is up to something” phase,’ he explained, using air quotes for emphasis.
'Teddy and I will be having our lunch over there. You are welcome to join us after you are done being a kid.'
'Is it just me or does that cloud look like a Crumple-Horned Snorkack to you too?' Luna asked no one in particular.
As Harry racked his brain to take the conversation forward, Andromeda entered and everyone relaxed as though released from a freezing charm. She took one look at them and rolled her eyes.
'Hm,' Ron said, thoughtful, 'I think his methods there and the Slytherins here are helping you well.'
Weasley and his sister came up to them next, eyes shimmering. They held up Fred's chocolate frog card that read "one half of the only two who managed to set off fireworks in the Great Hall and literally got away with it." That had been Draco's personal addition. He would never forget Umbridge's horror at that.
In what would be the most unforgettable war ever, the who’s who of the Wizarding world joined forces to defeat Harry Potter, the self made Dark Lord. It had been a long time coming, and so were the festivities that followed.
A massive migraine the size of their realisation was blooming in Sam’s head rapidly and steadily. He doubted it would reduce any time soon. ‘It’s not just modus operandi of the creatures that changed,’ he said instead, sinking his hands into his hair.
Dean snorted. ‘Not on a fucking aeroplane, Sammy, nope. Besides,’ he lifted a hand, preventing Sam from retorting further, ‘Isn’t it easier this way? Cas touches us between our brows and bam! You open your eyes to a different place.’
'Oh Draco,' Potter whispered, folding him into his arms even as Draco struggled, and quietly stroking his back. 'I'm so sorry. I thought you blamed me.'
‘Which, being a problem of vision, can probably be corrected with a pair of spectacles. I think I saw a store on my way here,’ Cas added.
Daphne had done that for him, however, whining every possible minute she could about how potentially disastrous the others could think their gifts were. Pansy and Blaise, in their attempts to find courage in liquor since they seemed to lack it in themselves, added to it after stumbling into the common room drunk, half an hour later than the time they had fixed.
'Congratulations, love.' Harry pulled him down for a wet, toe curling, sappy kiss. Draco purred contended, tightening his arms around Harry.
‘It wasn’t one.’ Cas looked at Sam thoroughly confused. ‘It is like I said, the ghost was under someone else’s power. There was nothing tying it to the mortal world, we could not even find his bones. I doubt burning them would have even worked.’
Sam kept looking at him, the scathing look in his eyes informing Cas how stupid his attempt at explanation had been.
All six of them planned to go out of their way to avoid trouble. It was the need of the hour. However, Hogwarts and chaos went hand in hand. There was no escape.
‘Creatures, humans, non-humans or animals, alive or dead are similar in that they show behaviours particular to their group,’ Bobby began. ‘You could say that’s how they were classified and divided in the first place. In the living, however, mutations lead to variations and development of new species. Even then, only those variations and mutations that lead to a more sustainable form of being persist in time.’
‘Rosie Watson,’ Sherlock replied, cuddling her closer. Neither of them spoke for a while and it became increasingly clear to John with every passing moment that he would once again have to be the mature one. Sherlock’s antics never grew old and John never tired of them, but he wouldn’t admit to the latter even if his life were on line. Doing the only thing he could, he threw his hands up in the air, rolled his eyes and went to take his four year old. Half an hour later, Rosie was in her bed, the floor was cleared up and John took the chair opposite his friend, steam billowing from the beverage in his hands.
Ron chewed them easily, gripping Harry hard on his shoulder. 'Don't pretend, Harry. I'll admit I didn't want you helping the snakes but I can see that it benefitted you equally. I just suspect that has more to do with Draco Malfoy than the others. You always were behind him.'
‘She’s clueless. She doesn’t know her name. George bolted out of storage within a minute of her arrival while I crumbled to the floor where I stood. Her aura, Harry, oh Merlin..’ Ron locked eyes with Harry once more. ‘The girl is projecting dark magic that felt akin to those horcruxes of Voldemort. Both George and I felt drawn to her as though called. It took everything in me to pull us out of that trance and not give in. I used those magic dampeners you gave me last winter to bring her till here,’ he said, turning to Draco at the end.
'Anything?' Potter had asked, a wicked grin on his face, a subtle echo of a previous similar conversation striking Draco in waves.
Ms.Hope nodded and began. ‘I had taken Nancy to play in the neighbourhood park that day as she had been quite restless throughout the morning and afternoon. It wasn’t really unusual to either of us. Nancy has made friends there and we were hoping to meet one or two of them during our time there. You see, Mr.Holmes, due to my mother, we cannot stay out for as long as we’d like. Anyway, Nancy, and by extension I, were relieved to see that her friends had made it to the park as well. Two hours had passed in which Nancy enjoyed herself and I spoke to a few of the other parents. When the time came for us to leave, I turned to find that Nancy was not in the place I last saw her. It really was only a few paces away from my bench and had a row of bushes on the other side. She couldn’t realistically go anywhere without passing by my eyes. The ball she had been playing with was gone too. The other kids couldn’t give us any satisfactory answers regarding where she was.’
Blaise's voice cracked towards the end. He didn't try to stop his tears from falling. It could be because Theo was in Azkaban or because Crabbe was dead or because Goyle had a lifelong ban on magic. Harry will never know.
Which would have been good if not for Potter avoiding him like plague. He shrugged himself out of the thoughts and tried to concentrate on the pity party before him.
‘No, disappeared. The police haven’t found a body yet. In fact, Ms.Hope claims she saw it happen before her eyes.’
'I'm glad you see reason,' Draco replied with a small amount of sterness in his voice. He kept his face open and eyes, forgiving.
Harry was left speechless and amused as the others laughed at his expense. Even Sirius released a rough snort before curling up at his feet. They all stared at the shiny, white clouds for a while. 'I was so afraid things wouldn't work out after the war,' Harry whispered to Draco.
‘If you help me with this, ‘Mione’s going to believe me, we’ll patch up and Parkinson would be off your back. Think carefully.’
Hermione, Ron and Ginny would track him on his map as Luna suggested they leave him until he's ready. Neville would be worried. Blaise, Pansy, Daphne and Millie would pretend they are not. But Draco? Harry no longer knew.
'Whatever do you mean, Ron,' Harry mumbled and immediately stuffed his friend's mouth with the crackers lying about.
When it came to good fortune, the six of them really had unparalleled luck. It came with pans and cauldrons as the price, though.
‘So this is what we’re doing,’ Harry said, getting up. ‘Malfoy, send a Patronus to Kingsley briefing him about the situation. Ron and I are going to meet up with Hermione and see what she has to say about the kid. Meanwhile, I want you to look into any old records we have of any case that is even remotely similar to this. Dig up any horcrux and enchanted objects case that you can find. Don’t involve anyone in this other than those we explicitly trust.’
Al looks affronted and about ready to chuck some potatoes at his brother's head but Ginny interrupts them. 'That's enough. What is food for?' She asks them, her tone stern and posture alert.
The Auror bullpen is in a flurry of activity by the time Harry enters. There's the sound of pages turning, owls swooping in and out, yellow interdepartmental memos whizzing to the recipients and the scritch scratch of quill on parchment. A steady thud of footsteps in and out of the cubicles follows him as he walks towards his room at the end. Astoria joins him midway, her quick quill and notepad hovering behind her as she briefs him up. Harry listens partially as his mind busily sorts through everyone he knows for the answer to Luna's question.
'Skipping stones is guaranteed to bring love!' Ron yelled, his arm settling around Hermione's shoulders.
‘Mr.Lestrade took him to the police station for questioning. He was probably suspicious of attempted kidnapping since we didn’t recognise the man, but the latter insisted he was only trying to help Nancy find her way home. Since the nearby security footage showed no signs of abduction, he was released.’
‘No, Granger. Listen. Blaise wants “peace” so I’m relying on you. It’s urgent so I demand you solve your silly problems at the earliest.’
'I did these!' Al proudly picks up the topmost sheet from the pile of crayon drawings next to him and presents it over the table to Harry. He inspects the mis-coloured drawing of a squirrel that Jamie seems to have befriended in their backyard that day.
Students soon began to bet on when it would rain. An unspoken belief settled in all that the first person to see it happen was going to be incredibly lucky. Draco and Ginevra hooted at that. It was nearly midnight, one day in late April, when Draco was squinting to look at some bird perched above his window sill. That's when the first drop fell onto his cheek.
'Besides, you might have picnics in the future without 'Mione and me and we might have them without you or Harry and Draco. Whether we realise it or not, we're adults now. Life is going to be different,' Ron said.
Try as he might, he couldn't not get Draco a gift. He wrapped it, set it on the dresser in Draco's room, where Draco spent his time now, and cast a Disillusionment on it, timed to wear off on June 6th.
Hogwarts was huge and easy to sneak away from if one knew their way. Harry used the Marauders Map to hawl those extra intelligent students to detention.
‘My sister met Tony when she was 13 at that boarding school they both attended. He was a charmer, a total ladies’ man. To be honest, I didn’t expect Jane to fall for someone like him, but it is as they say, Mr.Holmes, love is blind. And blind she had been! Tony visited us once and in the duration of that single visit managed to make my mother loathe him for the rest of eternity. They were married for nearly thirty years. Nancy was conceived quite late, three years before they both died in an unfortunate accident. And that was seven years ago. I’ve been raising her since then.’
She sat down beside him, shaking water from her hair. 'Anyway, Pans, what are you going to do next?'
Sam leaned forward and looked up at his brother. ‘Because they’ve all been sporadic. No two occurred in the same place or on the same day or in a manner that would rouse suspicion.’
Potter smiled in a way that meant he knew something that Draco did not. 'Okay,' he winked and walked away.
'And you, a Hufflepuff,' Draco retorted, grinning wider, because yes, this group of unlikely people made each other smile to the maximum.
'They always do,' Draco whispered back, burrowing close to Harry. 'Maybe not always in the way we expect or at the time we expect. But they do. I'm positive my mum and aunt will eventually recover. They are already doing better than predicted.'
He can't pinpoint when it happened or why but the spark that made them trust and depend on each other is now dying. Harry is sometimes scared by how that realisation doesn't terrify him.
There was undoubtedly no question of, ‘The Slytherins don’t listen to me, Professor.’ She’d glare at him over her glasses.
‘I need some air,’ he said and left the room only to return ten minutes later, white faced and panting.
'In those who have had it from the beginning, you mean,' Daphne snorted. Most Slytherins knew she had mommy issues and had helped raise her younger sister Astoria. The others too seemed to understand it was a sensitive topic and went back to their work.
'I'm sorry,' Harry croaked. He conjured a bunch of white narcissus flowers. 'I didn't forget. I didn't ghost. Happy birthday, Draco.'
‘A ten year old apparated alone into our shop with no memory of who she is or where she’s from,’ Ron amended.
'So,' Ron slapped Harry's thigh as he took the seat next to him on the common room couch, 'how was Christmas at Andy and Teddy's?'
'No,' Draco shook his head adamantly after the party. 'Not going to happen. I will not give that to you under any circumstances.' He had asked what gift Potter wanted because he had failed to buy a suitable present yet again.
'For God's sake, Ginevra! I'm not going to delete it!' Pansy screamed, still trying to tackle Ginny onto the ground.
'You know,' Goldstein said, scratching his chin, 'for all that you said about Mrs. Tonks being depressed, she sure still has some wits remaining about her.'
Harry stared at Draco, properly shocked and silenced. It wasn’t the first time that Draco played peacemaker between him and Head Auror Gawain Robards. It also wasn’t the first time that he took on more work. He remembered this behaviour streak in Draco started after he, in his drunken stupor, complained about it on one of their team pub nights. It was weird and Harry wasn’t good at making sense of Draco’s weirdness. So he instead chose to dutifully immerse himself in the top most file on his table.
'Not much there to not mope,' Daphne replied on his behalf, sitting cross legged on the floor near his feet.
'I'm sorry too, Draco. I'm so so sorry.' Potter pulled back and cupped his cheeks. 'I'm involving myself with the man I have feelings for. I don't hate you, quite the opposite.'
'Last year, I was too numb to feel anything,' he said, voice garbled. 'Ron had gone off, Hermione was angry and I-' his voice cracked, 'I was so lost. I couldn't ask either of them to relive those moments again. I couldn't come alone either. I'm sorry.'
‘Robards wants those done by tomorrow evening at the most. Direct your fury at him,’ he said and bent over his desk.
'Muggles celebrate Thanksgiving in November,' Blaise said, inhaling deeply. 'On the fourth Thursday, to be exact.'
'No,' Harry smiled again. 'My next appointment isn't until late Jan. He assured me that I'm doing okay and I feel that way too.'
Harry gave them a small smile and regarded them curiously. 'What are you guys doing after school? Did you decide?'
The stress of worrying his brains over the small surprise that lit up the faces of everyone present, finally melted away the stress beneath his skin. Draco wasn't even aware that he was beaming until Blaise knocked him on the shoulder, sloshed and swaying.
It was as April started fading away that the attacks started. Physically on Slytherins (but eighth years were specifically sought for it), emotionally on those who chose to fight in the war and mentally on everyone. Madam Pomfrey had to send vials of Calming Draught to each dorm after dinner. The nightmares weren't kept at bay by any means. That kind of healing had to come from inside. But no one had full blown panic attacks and Pomfrey counted it as a win.
Potter rolled his eyes. 'Oh for fuck's sake!' he huffed and yanked Draco back by his shirt collar. Draco went stumbling into an unused classroom as Potter closed the door and pushed him against it.
They conjured wings, tails, ears and antlers and played tag wearing them. Teddy clapped and yelled in glee, Sirius scampered along with them, darting in between their legs, having the time of his life. By half past eleven, they were a panting heap of bodies. Draco hauled Potter away later, just before the clock stuck midnight. He pushed him against their bedroom wall, wrapped his arms around his waist and leaned in.
He inelegantly turned tail and ran back the way he came. His lungs burned for oxygen and his heart screamed in agony by the time he reached Hogsmeade. McGonagall was going to be angry. Yet, Harry apparated.
These three are introductory chapters so bear with me. I promise you there's a lot of action coming up. I won't be working on anything else until this is finished so I'll update as and when I finish writing a chapter.
The Slytherins were also in a bizzare entanglement of limbs and bodies that made Harry laugh. Neville caught his eye and shook his head like he too couldn't believe it.
Harry raised an eyebrow at that but his attention was drawn to the disgruntled noises Draco was making as he stomped up to them. Harry took his wrist and dragged him back to the edge of the lake.
‘But they’re all different!’ Sam exclaimed. ‘None of the seven incidents I’ve picked as the most severe are because of the same supernatural creature. I mean, I’m almost sure we’re dealing with a wraith in Michigan and a siren in Colorado. My guess is, the remaining five are different too.’
'We know you are right in blaming us. We know your hatred is justified. We know we can't call ourselves the victims of the same malevolence as you because you suffered more than us. We also know that we aren't sure if we would have acted any differently if time reversed.'
‘And yours is much easily accessible right here on the table,’ Sherlock replied, quickly shooting a text message. ‘Come on, John. We have a child to find,’ he continued, picking up his coat and sauntering out the door.
His patience was usually tested come Teddy's nap time. Putting a high on sugar and energy Teddy to sleep was about as easy as convincing the Ministry of Voldemort's return had been.
Hogwarts reopened new and bright after the winter break and kept its students busy for the first few days. It wasn't until the homework submissions were done that any of them could properly unwind.
‘Well,’ Hermione said, lowering her voice. ‘The Unspeakables need to get something checked and we needed someone we could trust. Parvati, I want you to analyse her blood.’
‘No, I found one thing common between our victims here and the victims in London, but it doesn’t make sense,’ Sam clarified.
'Sure you weren't. I suppose all the non kissing, non cuddling and non touching was all just my imagination.'
'That's your jealousy talking, Potter. I know you don't like that I stay up long teaching. I know you don't like me spending time with others.'
Granger and Weasley had sat them down after their "totally ridiculous" spat and gave them "the talk."
'Oi,' Harry poked Ron in the shoulder with his free hand. 'It's all on you and 'Mione and Millie and Goyle. Teddy would want cousins sooner rather than later.'
Harry Potter looked up to find that the heavy thudding he heard was because of a bundle of folders settling onto his desk from Draco Malfoy’s, who was currently looking smug and withdrawing his wand. He threw his partner a glare, asking what it was about.
Tears began flowing out of her eyes and in her attempts to dab them with her handkerchief, the cup in her hands tilted, spilling the tea onto the carpet.
'To be grateful to the good things or people that happened to them that year? Mother says Muggles cherish it a lot.'
‘Is she why I’ve been called?’ Parvati Patil emerged in green robes from a crowd of people moving about the lobby where Harry and the others had been waiting. Her hair was sticking out in all directions and her face looked sallow with sunken cheeks and dark circles. ‘I was almost signing out, you know.’
It was a modest birthday with balloons, streamers, props, photos and cake. Draco's mother, aunt and Madam Augusta were the attending adults while Teddy Lupin was the guest of honour. The little toddler's chubby face was covered in icing ten minutes in. His regular giggles and cackles, a delightful music. After dinner, Daphne took out her paints and brushes and coloured their faces. Potter sported a dragon, Pansy an owl, Blaise a rabbit and Longbottom a bumblebee. Draco was last and chose a stag.
That was how Draco found himself walking down the path to the castle gates with Potter, just as Hogwarts got ready for the evening feast.
Pansy huffed. ‘It is distressing news, Blaise!’ She jumped up and down to stress her point. ‘I never thought they’d break up, especially since it took them forever to confess!’
‘Yes, it doesn’t make sense,’ Sam said, pulling his laptop over. ‘They were mentioned only once in the news too. I’ve checked the newspapers of the days after the incidents took place, there’s no mention of anything related. It’s as if those dead have never even existed here.’
Sam and Dean were quiet as the implication started becoming obvious. An icy cold chill ran down their spines, shaking them from the core. Bobby had it spot on, as usual.
Ron groaned. The two tried to tackle him but ended up bumping their conjoined hands into a stand midway.
'Oh stop being dramatic, you all,' Ginevra snapped. 'Knowing them, Dean and Seamus are probably only pulling a prank on Draco and Harry.'
‘Seven years ago, I followed Ron and Harry to escape from Filch. It brought us together. Supposedly for this.’
Thomas' research apparently was how long a couple could kiss on the broom but Blaise was doubtful and was proven right, when Finnigan lit a fire behind the group of birds they had secretly dragged out. This sent them flying hard and high into the air, knocking over Potter's broom as they zoomed past.
As they lifted their wands in respect to the fallen, Harry saw bright green leaves sprouting from the soil in the garden. His heart felt light like it hadn't ever been. He was delighted to see his feelings mirroring on Ron and Hermione as they moved to grab him into a hug.
‘Why? I’m sure we can get a copy of the surveillance footage and start there.’ John said soothingly.
‘No pattern whatsoever be it the victims or modus operandi or the days on which the incidents happened,’ Dean said, throwing the papers he had been fruitlessly examining down onto the coffee table. ‘Any innocent could be the next target and we are here, blindly shooting in the dark.’ He started pacing up and down the room agitatedly.
'Hush it and give up,' he finished, extending his hand and making grabby motions. For some reason, Sirius looked forlorn as he dropped them near Draco's feet. Draco decided not to think too much about it.
'And I,' Kingsley Shacklebolt agreed, rising from his seat. All the teachers of Hogwarts stood with him.
'Your actions made it explicitly clear. You hardly spoke to me for 23 days. I noticed.' Draco still didn't face him. Harry saw red.
Granger, Pansy, a few Slytherins, a handful of Hufflepuffs and a decisive number of Ravenclaws agreed with McGonagall. It was anybody's guess what the rest of the eighth years thought.
‘Oh no, Mr.Holmes,’ Ms.Hope gushed. ‘There was no such danger since it is a fully magical settlement. Tony preferred and had a certain affinity to purely wizard based and wizard run establishments. I believe the reason for not fixing a magical mode of transport was to protect their privacy. Tony had quite a reputation,’ she laughed. John smiled good-naturedly. ‘Both good and bad,’ she hurried to add.
Emma Hope glowered at John. ‘Dr. Watson, do you mean to say that I’m being delusional? Because I assure you I’m not. My sister and her husband have not taught their child anything about the wizarding world before their death as they weren’t sure if Nancy had such capabilities or not. They didn’t want to give her a false hope.’
Almost immediately Cas appeared before him as if he had been waiting for Sam to call him. He swayed slightly clutching his abdomen and Sam guided him to the foot of his bed and propped him up on pillows. He then gently attended to Dean’s cut before settling him into a sitting position on the floor, leaning his head against his bed, next to Cas’ bouncing knee. Turning enquiring eyes on Cas, he crossed his arms across his chest and waited for him to say something.
‘I’ve been meaning to ask, Ms.Hope, but I’m afraid I never got the chance to. Where did Lestrade find her that day?’ Sherlock enquired.
Pansy rolled her eyes. 'Why did you kiss that tosser, Dray? Care to share?' Draco remained mute. Harry tried to figure out what was going on.
‘Something strange,’ was all Hermione revealed as she ushered them all out of the room to the Atrium and flooed them straight to St.Mungos.
‘That’s an understatement. We’ve had four new admissions to the Paeds ward and three newborns. They’ve kept the entire staff up and running all night. What’s this about?’
Potter stumbled from his bed, half drowsy, and yanked Draco downstairs to the Training Grounds. Draco couldn't bring himself to be upset. Yes, his pajamas got splashed with mud and tiny chunks of the wet clay got stuck between his toes, but Potter, wild, free and happy, spun him in a circle, lifting him off his feet and kissing him tenderly.
Pansy, Daphne, Blaise and Draco were easily settled in Grimmauld after graduating from Hogwarts. Granger and Weasley were visiting the former's parents in Australia. Ginevra and Luna Lovegood were in Ottery St. Catchpole, relaxing, and Thomas and Finnigan had moved into their own flat in London. Longbottom lived in Grimmauld in an unofficial capacity, popping back at night to sleep in his bed. Madam Augusta was very… particular.
Ron pounced on the opportunity at once. Even if it was Parkinson sitting next to him and not Hermione. He missed her. ‘This is his timetable,’ he said, recovering quickly. ‘He’s usually in class or in the library. I’ve included his seven detentions as well. Quidditch is on Wednesdays. On Tuesdays and Fridays, he is free after lunch and returns to the common room late.’
'Totally like you to backstab. Keep up,' Potter replied, giving a thumbs up at the end. Pansy stuck her tongue out at him for that. Draco thought Potter deserved it.

Harry counted the files and exclaimed, ‘Twenty reports in two days! That’s impossible!’ He shook his head as if that action alone could help him escape from the boredom the activity he was assigned would most likely cause him.
'You,' Daphne pointed out when he passed by her in the hallway, 'are being irrational.' Draco paid her no heed, knowing the husky would follow him.
When he turned back, he found Potter staring at him and he blushed, remembering that he hadn't got anything for him.
Harry realised he was rambling and his face went red. Draco seemed to feel similarly awkward. 'Yes, obviously,' he said.
‘I’m worried this could be beyond us, Sammy,’ Dean sighed and looked up. ‘We couldn’t kill the ghost. It just exploded out of existence right in front of our eyes. And when we came to, we were covered in bruises. Cas had a tough time zapping us back.’
‘Sit down, Sammy there’s a lot you need to know,’ Dean said closing the door behind him and holding out a glass of water to Cas who gulped down the cool liquid gratefully.
‘Neither are we, Ms.Hope. John here’s an army man and I myself am a consultant detective. I’m not sure how we can help you here.’
Draco tuned him out and found Potter staring at the group with barely concealed repugnance. Draco was suddenly angry. Like always, this horrible association with the pest that is Smith was all Potter's fault. He stomped up to the Gryrfindor, throwing a hex at Smith when he didn't let Draco go.
Draco hunted it into their living room where Potter was reading a book. 'Sirius,' Draco growled. 'Give. Me. My. Papers.' Sirius stared unblinkingly up at Draco. 'I SAID GIVE THEM TO ME, IDIOT! Do you know what they mean? No, you don't. You're just dumb. Ha-'
'Oh hush!' Hermione cut in. 'You know they are trying to rile you up. Why do you want to give them more fodder?'
Draco hesitated before slowly taking Potter's hand in his and squeezing it. Potter immediately laced their fingers together and wiped away the tears with his other hand. Draco pulled him forwards and they walked towards the cemetery, passing the Potter's home towards which Potter had looked at with such yearning that Draco wanted to wrap him up in his arms until the grief disappeared from his shoulders.
The two Aurors raised a brow at each other, as though offended, before they turned to Ron in all seriousness. ‘What is it?’ Harry asked.
‘I’d like to remind you that I’m several years older than a lot of humans on the Earth.’ Cas said in between his chips.
A right, a left and another left later, they reached the door and burst in immediately. Hermione was sitting at a small table before a ten year old, both of them in a deep conversation. The little girl was the first to notice Ron and Harry as she tilted her head up and scrunched her face in confusion. Hermione looked up at that, relief crossing her features as she took in her two best friends.
Harry wasn't looking forward to the Commemoration Day. He had to visit Remus, Sirius, Tonks, Fred, Colin, Dobby and Snape. Draco, on the other hand, was excited. McGonagall had asked Blaise to speak and Draco helped write it. This made the Slytherins jumpy like never before.
‘And your guess would be correct,’ Cas said, standing up. ‘Someone succeeded in releasing the dark creatures onto us in a very unconventional way.’ He walked over to Sam, scooped some of the newspaper cuttings up and blew them onto his face like confetti.
Sam Winchester jerked awake to the sound of something heavy falling on the floor. He peered into the darkness of his room. The shadows all looked much the same as the day before. Whoever it was who had stolen inside was either a figment of his imagination or hid remarkably well in a small chamber that was rapidly getting bathed in the rays of dawn filtering through the windows. From his experience, though, Sam knew that the probability of the latter was impossibly high. He quietly reached under his pillow for his revolver, rolled onto the other side of the bed and assumed an attacking stance with his weapon aimed in the direction the sound came from. Before the room could fully light up and give the intruder the advantage of surprise. The sight that met his eyes, however, took his breath away.
'Curiously, your crush seems to be taken with me,' Draco went on. 'He even managed to present me with a bunch of-'
‘How are you so sure about this?’ Sam asked Cas who was very busily operating the controls of a gaming console.
Two hours later, Harry was filling out the official records of the second case when a panting Ron waddled into their room and collapsed in a chair, interrupting their workflow. Harry exchanged a look with Draco and set his quill aside, taking the empty glass on his table and casting an Aguamenti. Ron took a large gulp of it before throwing his head back and running his fingers through his hair.
'Is this revenge, Malfoy?' Potter shouted when they landed on the hill, wet and shivering from the rain falling at Hogwarts.
‘I heard differently,’ said another soldier limping over to where everyone had convened to hear the story. ‘Apparently, Young Master wasn’t the one who delivered the final blow. There are rumours going on that his own powers of Dark Magic backfired on him.’
Smith, Draco, Ron and Hannah were around a coffee table pouring over the theory of Dreamless Sleep. Smith usually had the most doubts and Draco explained patiently.
Sherlock was spared from further explanation by the arrival of the very woman they had been talking about. Emma Hope was a middle aged, black haired and frantic eyed spinster who had moved to Baker street ten months ago. She lived with her ailing mother and her niece, whom she had been taking care of since her sister and her husband died seven years ago. Nancy Lovhood was the ten year old who had gone “missing.” Both men observed keenly as she limped her way to the chair they set out for their clients, John’s racy brain quickly concluding that her limp must be from tripping on the last step she very obviously missed on the stairs in her hurry to come up.
'If I knew pushing Harry to get his head out of his arse and talk to Draco would have smooch level consequences, I wouldn't have done it,' Weasley said, exasperated.
All of them exchanged significant looks at that. The tiny flame of hope that Harry didn’t know he had been harboring was extinguished in a single breeze. The conclusion was too much in their faces to avoid it now. The incident hadn’t been accidental. Someone had deliberately sent the kid into their midst. Why? Harry didn’t yet know. He just sent a desperate prayer up, wishing little Rose wasn’t a ticking time bomb walking amongst them.
Harry gestures at Ron's opposite ear instead of answering. When they settle down, he rotates his neck a bit and bends it from side to side, hoping to get some crick to sound. 'I have a stiff neck today,' he lies. Astoria watches him like a hawk but he doesn't glance at her. 'You guys can get started with… what's his name.. Murray, yes. I'll be by in a bit. And Astoria, can you get me the authorisations I have to sign on?'
Narcissa visited Hogwarts to meet her son at the end of February and informed him that she was going into therapy along with Aunt Andy. Draco was relieved. Being with Potter was therapy in itself though Granger and Pansy both liked to say it was "like blind leading the blind."
Professor Arya Seth taught Potions and was strictly no-nonsense. She scarily resembled McGonagall and Snape. Draco was most glad that he didn’t have to report to her as “one of the students in her house”. McGonagall had removed house affiliations for the forty eighth years who had returned, thank Merlin!
'You didn't speak to anyone for three days after receiving the news, you shut people out. I overthought and assumed..'
'Idiots, I know,' Pansy replied, rolling her eyes, 'and it's fucking crazy that it's Sunday night but they'll be fine because we will be right there if something happens.'
Sam shrugged. ‘Yes, it’s as if they’ve all forgotten about that one person. We won’t be able to find out more unless we go there.’
'Harry!' He exclaimed when he finally found him in the study. 'Harry!' He jumped onto him and straddled his waist. 'Can you believe I did it? I can't either! I thought he hated me and was going to detain me. I was so nervous during the interview, you have no idea.. '
Sherlock opted not to acknowledge John’s interruption and carried on, ‘This was all, of course, confirmed by the impressive amount of dog hair on your coat, the smell of lilies from her perfume that wafted in before you and the clay on your boots that could have only come from the garden Ms.Hope so religiously tends to. Judging by the tea still remaining in the kettle, I think I can safely assume that you’ve invited her here for a consultation with me.’
‘Can you tell us about the accident that orphaned your niece, Ms.Hope?’ Sherlock asked, after ensuring that the lady was sufficiently composed.
Blaise rolled up his scroll. ‘Forever or not, separation is a natural part of relationships.’ He began packing his materials into his bag. ‘It’s normal. Stop worrying yourself over someone else’s relationship. I want at least one year to be peaceful.’ He started walking towards the boys’ dorms.
'I'm on the side of peace. It's not everyday that I get to relax,' she replied, stretching herself on the grass, their picnic basket, food, towels and napkins spread out next to her. Sirius barked, as though in complete agreement with her and went to lie down beside her. Soon, the rest followed suit.
'I think you now hold the record for the longest stare held by a wizard against an elf,' Blaise said conversationally.
'Rains are messy, damp and muddy,' Draco told Ginevra that evening as they lounged in the common room while the others were out in the garden. 'They used to make disastrous messes in Mother's Rose bed which she used to insist I help her clean.'
Silence reigned for a few minutes. Cas and Dean abandoned their respective games and windows and sat at the table opposite Sam and began to go through the articles he had accumulated. Sam could tell it would end up being a futile, tiresome exercise because none of them knew what exactly they were looking for. Regardless, he refused to sit still and ploughed on determinedly. He loved research when he had the basic groundwork formulated and laid out. Starting from the scratch was always a sure shot way to ensure oneself of a massive migraine. He dismissed the distracting thoughts to the back of his mind as he immersed himself fully into his work. At long last, Dean rested his head in his hands and pushed back the air from his forehead.
‘I honestly thought I’d have to physically break the two of you apart,’ Sam complained as he opened his laptop. ‘This Mama business ain’t all that easy, Dean.’
Ron noticed it first, the nearly unmistakable similarity to their sixth year. Nearly. It was both there and not there. He asked the one person who could reliably answer him.
Harry goes up for a wash and when he returns, the dinner table is set and his three kids are eagerly waiting for him. The sight puts a genuine smile on Harry's face. It won't be a long shot to say that sometimes, coming home to this daily ritual was all he went to work for. Harry's not about to admit it to anyone though. 'So,' Harry asks, taking his seat, 'what have my favourite Potters been up to today?'
Draco snorted. 'I'm sure.' Sirius flicked his head up in their direction. He let out a low bark of disapproval, as if to remind them that he was there. Harry rubbed Sirius' belly with his toes to pacify him.
Sherlock’s grin couldn’t be stopped. ‘Your astonishment at my methods and conclusions is still just as it had been six years ago when I first deduced your stint in Afghanistan. I thought you would have got used to it by now.’
Harry's resolve crumpled at Draco's desolate look. 'The flowers were mine,' he whispered. 'I left a note too.' He knelt before Draco, cupping his wet face in his palm. He distantly registered their friends leaving the bubble of Muffliato.
Blaise, Pansy and Ginny moved away as Ron nudged Harry to the couch. Hermione cast a Muffliato. 'Do I have to make the first move?'
Cas tuned into Nickelodeon for the afternoon as the two brothers shared a smile. They knew their reprieve wouldn’t last long but over time as hunters, they began to appreciate what little of it they could get.
Hermione, Ron, Dean, Seamus and Ginny were assigned patrolling duties in rotation. Flitwick proposed the idea after two sixth year Ravenclaws were gutted for torturing their friends by seven Hufflepuffs. The vote was unanimous.
Draco burrowed his face in Harry's neck. Harry kissed his head, trying to calm him. He knew Draco loved Lucius despite his faults.
Draco and Potter took a sudden plunge to the ground terrifyingly fast. They were furious at their friends after landing, none of whom could stop laughing. They tried to speak, only to spit out owl feathers instead. With that the thread holding Blaise's last shreds of control snapped and he laughed the loudest.
Parkinson scoffed. ‘Yes, Weasley. I’m not blind. I don’t refuse to notice the obvious. Let me see your research.’
'She says that's where she's going to settle down but that is what she said of Milan too so I wouldn't bet on it.'
He was more surprised that they were there since he made sure to return at ten to eleven, fifty minutes past the time Draco had said they'd be leaving for the pub.
'Harry!' Granger exclaimed, awed and momentarily speechless. She traced the otter on his left shoulder even as Weasley hugged him, kissing his forehead, eyes teary at the sight of the terrier on Potter's right shoulder.
They both turned towards Harry who gave them a sheepish look. 'Andy might look normal, but she is far from it. The war-' he stuttered, 'she lost her family and is extremely possessive of Teddy. Some days, it's like she's just a body, no soul. I don't know what she and your mother discussed, Draco, but if I know anything about her, she would have avoided talking about it altogether. She needed to feel like she still had a family. But Ron and the others needed me too, so I went over to theirs the next day.'
Pansy descended from behind Ginny, hair wild, expression so cold that Harry flinched as though hexed. Smith was still gathering his wits when Harry locked eyes with Draco, clutching his bouquet.
‘This entire thing is fucking frustrating,’ he grunted, running his hands through his hair and tugging at it, a part of him wanting to rip it out entirely. ‘Today can’t get any worse.’
By evening, Harry understood two things- one, he will have to give a speech and two, Draco wasn't going to let go of his hand anytime soon. The crowd was as expected, large and parted way for Blaise with surprise and trepidation when he was called upon.
Daphne was still on her firecall with Astoria. That left Blaise, who was studiously pacing the room up and down, a finger on his chin, deep in thought.
‘The Weasleys must be at peace now. They adopted him and taught him when he was nearly begging on the streets. They even gave him the title of the Second Master of the clan. The ungrateful demon bit the hand that fed him. Without them, he wouldn’t have survived until now and yet, he brought shame upon his family,’ said the first man, who had asked the soldier about the war.
'What?' Potter asked, then looking up, eyes curiously sparkling. Draco realised his mistake instantly.
The worst part about February so far had been Zach Smith from Hufflepuff installing himself beside Draco. He was convinced he was the only person who could bring Draco out of his "moping." Like his father dying was something common enough to not grieve about. Draco was slowly realising how tedious a Hufflepuff can be.
Draco refused to believe his father "succumbed", as they had put it, two months before his release. A part of him was sure it was because his father couldn't bear not being magical but a larger part was scared he was killed. For everything the man had been, he was Draco's father and Draco loved him dearly.
Ron took it from her immediately and tossed it over to Ginny, who became Pansy's next target for leap practice. Ginny held her arm high above Pansy's head, ducking and swerving and keeping the cam out of reach.
‘Kim Jung Joon,’ Harry chuckled. ‘The guy who refuses to kill an ant.’ He started laughing then. ‘Hey Malfoy, do you ever think about Gwen briefing JJ? Must be erratic.’
Harry ignored the pangs of hurt, jealousy and anger. He started to noiselessly make his way to his dorm when Smith was thrown off. Ginny lowered her wand, glaring furiously at Smith.
Harry scoffed, folding his hands. 'I'm not jealous. And I don't like that we don't spend any time together.'
Dean looked unconscious but relatively uninjured, if one didn’t count the gash on his left cheek that ran from the corner of his eye to his mouth. Sam didn’t think it was deep but it looked red, angry and was bleeding profusely. He hoped it didn’t scar, at least for Dean’s sake.
2. The characters were chosen keeping the nature of their counterparts in the original and the relations and characteristics of the HP universe characters in view. That is why a lot of the common "good" characters from HP universe may not appear in the story.
‘What are you guys doing here?’ she asked. ‘And who is this little woman?’ Ginny crouched in front of her and held out a hand.
‘No, I don’t want to know,’ he said again, sensing a quirky comeback that he was absolutely not in the mood for that morning.
Things got emotional when the staff, Potter and other Gryffindors took their turn. Thomas and Finnigan hadn't stopped holding hands for hours afterwards, Longbottom had disappeared with Blaise, Weasley and Granger were behind a tree and Potter was in Draco's arms, sniffing into Draco's neck.
It only made sense the others told him what presents he would be receiving. 'Neville, I'm getting you that sea urchin cactus. You said that was the only species missing in your collection, right?' Potter asked.
Sam had to keep his laugh contained at Dean’s expression of discombobulated anger. ‘Or maybe it doesn’t have as much to do with vision.’
Draco looked on flabbergasted before he went after him. 'The guy hates me. He'll never approve of my apprentice work. At this rate, I'll be stuck there forever. Potter!'
‘There’s absolutely nothing here that’s remotely normal,’ Dean replied, stretching his hands and cracking his knuckles.
, like his namesake and his owner, was an absolute disaster. Draco would be lying if he said he never wanted to kick him out. 'Sirius! You blasted dog! Give me my papers back!' Draco yelled, chasing him. Sirius made short work of the stairs and disappeared to the third floor.
'And not just any lilies,' Longbottom explained. 'They are dragon lilies, often mistaken for the garden variety for how similar they are. They also..'
Harry didn't comment on "us" or "Zach". He tried not to think whether or not Draco would have invited him if he hadn't asked, what "want to come along" meant. He frowned.
Draco stared at Harry for a minute. ‘They at least have a good chief,’ he eventually said, going back to his report.
'Then I'm really glad you see reason,' Draco said calmly and confidently. Harry laughed hard at the sudden terror on the Hufflepuffs' faces.
Granger handed out everyone's revision schedules as soon as the first of March dawned on them, causing half of them to groan. The Gryffindors accepted them without a second thought as if it was completely normal for them. It probably was. Draco was surprised she knew the subjects they were all individually taking but then again, she was Granger. Lovegood might have had a point about her obsession.
'It's selfish of us to ask you this after taking so much from you but can we please get another opportunity to prove ourselves?'
Thanksgiving dawned on them, abnormally cold and cloudy. Draco woke up late from a fitful sleep and didn't even have time to overthink if the atmosphere outside was setting the tone to what was to unfold that day.
Hermione found him sometime later, looking as if she had seen and heard everything. Harry was too tired to be vulnerable. He hid his face in her shoulder.
‘We’re starting easy then?’ asked the soldier, his lips curving against the scar on his cheek. ‘Who else? Ronald Weasley, his own relative. He led the Four Great Sects into the battle and stormed the Potter Manor. I have to say, I’m impressed.’
Pansy, Daphne and Millie were often seen escorting Slytherins to and from the Infirmary. Harry and Neville accompanied them if Blaise or Draco got admitted.
Dean threw a newspaper onto the table and opened it to the international section. He turned it around for the others to see and pointed at an article. ‘It’s happening everywhere in the world. Seven mysterious cases in London, all of which started way before our ghost decided to dance on our heads. I think we've found the epicentre of the hurricane.’
‘I like chaos. There hasn’t been much of it in the afterlife. I miss it,’ Tonks winked from her portrait.
‘Yeah,’ John said, shifting in his seat. ‘All along the walk she regaled me with what she considers is substantial proof and what in reality is just a lead, regarding the incident. I think I’d better warn you about the peculiar theories she has as well.’
'For which you'd have to start studying from now if you harbour any hope of passing them,' Granger said, rolling her eyes.
‘It’s very possible that we may not prevent the next incident from happening but all this preparation will help us protect the other unfortunate souls who are no doubt on the list.’
'And I,' someone said from the far back and it rang through them all like a war cry. Harry watched as more and more took it up. He smiled at McGonagall and snaked his arm around Draco's waist.
When Harry went back to the common room in the evening, he found Draco and Smith occupying the love seat next to the fireplace with tongues down each others' throats.
‘I’m pretty sure you can narrate the events in the order they occurred without misspelling any names or places with the number of times you’ve read them. So, what is it, Bobby?’
Thomas awkwardly rubbed the back of his head and Draco looked away from the intimate moment, straight into the green eyes of Harry Potter, who had apparently sneaked up to sit behind him on the couch and watched the whole scene.
Harry smiled, his mind suddenly flooding with the best parts of the day. 'It was different. Quiet, or as quiet as it can be with a toddler,' he chuckled, 'but it was a quietness that didn't feel out of place.'
'I have permission to go to Godric's Hollow that night,' Potter continued, looking at him meaningfully.
Potter-Harry- smiled up at Draco, revelling in the wonder his boyfriend was. 'Draco,' he said softly, tucking Draco's hair behind his ear. Draco stopped and stared.
'Ain't that a sight to behold!' Hermione exclaimed, a clicking sound issuing from her camera. Harry chuckled. 'Oh Merlin, yes!'
John looked as gobsmacked as ever. He opened his mouth and closed it again. Finally, he sighed and said, ‘It’s about her niece. You remember how we heard something was wrong with her three weeks ago? Ms. Hope believes it isn’t all as it is said to be.’
'Harry!' Ron exclaims, wiping behind his ear. 'You're late,' he claps Harry's shoulder. 'And off. What's off about you?'
At around twelve, Harry wakes up for his midnight routine. Quietly, without disturbing Ginny who’s faintly snoring on the other side of the bed. Today has been less gloomy, all things considered, but it still required him to follow the drill.
‘We went to the cafe for breakfast as we do every Sunday. It happened when we were leaving to go home. You see, Nancy went out first but as I was about to join her on the pavement, I realised that my coat got stuck in the door. I was untangling it when she disappeared with a yelp. One minute, she was there, Mr.Holmes,’ Ms.Hope said, pointing to a space to the left of John, ‘and the next, she wasn't. My situation is totally desolate. I won’t find her!’ She hid her face in her hands, her small frame shaking with her sobs.
'I'll admit I was trying to get you into my bed when it looked like you and Harry broke up, because man, you are damn fit!'
‘Now, Sammy,’ Dean said groggily, ‘I’d love to have explored that possibility had the ghost not been that of a 70 year old man.’ He stretched his arms and smirked at both of them.
Draco and Ginevra found themselves groaning for completely different reasons. They realised they both hated the Monsoons and were not looking forward to them. It was an unlikely kinship in which they were strongly united much to the surprise of others.
‘Leave it, don’t involve yourself. This is a new world around us now,’ Blaise responded off handedly to Pansy’s pleas, quill scratching away on his parchment.
‘Relax, Harry,’ Hermione said, ‘you can do that after you go back. It’s only going to take fifteen minutes here. Besides, this is part of your job, you know.’
Harry had to look away. The moment was too private to have an audience even if said audience happened to be someone they fought a war with. He felt a pang in his heart as he kept looking all around the room in an attempt to distract himself from the emotions threatening to overwhelm him. He was twenty four now and still as homeless and family-less as he had been when his life changed at eleven. He told himself it was because of Teddy and he told himself it was because he was too busy with his work. He knew they were partly true. He also knew they were mostly false. He stopped his thoughts from going too close to the truth that was looming in his head in capital letters and neon lights and instead went to the papers lying about a few paces beside the kid.
It was a comparatively chilly morning, he said. He was mid sleep, his brain mushy, eyes foggy, mouth fuzzy and dry, he told himself. The light in their bedroom was low, he was three quarters underneath the covers, the visibility was low, he reasoned.
Soul summoning rituals were conducted in vain numerous times and there was always a look out for strange happenings around the world. Nobody found an answer for sixteen years.
A half an hour after further discussions and inputs from Granger, Lovegood, Hagrid and Prof. Flitwick, the eighth years filed out of the office. Potter slid an arm around Draco's waist, nuzzling into his neck. 'So your Green group meetings were about this brilliance?'
‘You don’t believe a word she spoke,’ John said, looking his friend in the eye. There was never a Morrison’s case or a trip to Bath. Sherlock had spontaneously made that up.
That was where Draco had been impressed with Potter's brilliance. 'Which is why,' Potter said, smug and happy, 'I'm also going to run a Daycare. I'm the sole heir to Potter and Black fortunes, both of which alone are enough to sustain me and the orphanage but Andy wouldn't grant me custody of Teddy if I didn't have a proper occupation. She says swindling money is easier than blinking.'
‘I can’t not involve myself when it happened right in front of my eyes!’ Pansy exclaimed, tired of convincing her friend.
All's well that ends well and whether the gossip about Lord Potter was true or not, people had no time or reason to pay attention to. He was someone who had to be annihilated and Young Master Weasley had achieved it. That was what mattered.
He therefore had little to no time to think about the skull on his arm. During the three instances that Draco did, Potter caught his hand and stopped him from scratching it raw. 'Your marks don't define you, Draco,' he had whispered, eyes serious and worried. Draco was reminded of those words each time he had looked at his mark from then on.
‘Excellent,’ Sam said, getting up from his seat. ‘We’ve faced the Apocalypse, Demons and Angels just so we could watch the world get torn down because of another supernatural entity. Is it just me or is our luck really rotten?’
Blaise suddenly turned on them all. 'Neville is not synonymous with plants! He likes to bake muffins, he likes coffee over tea, he likes to watch muggle movies and he likes shopping. He likes watching quidditch, reading Asterias Cranford's novels and Celestina Warbeck. I don't like how you insinuate that Neville is only plants and nothing else.' He grabbed Longbottom by the wrist, dragging him out of the room.
After dinner, Harry reads a story to his kids while Ginny cleans up. By ten o’clock the Potter household goes to sleep.
It was largely because of his soul. His body was lost and his soul couldn’t be found. This left the people with an opportunity to go wild with their theories. Not a week passed without someone or the other hearing from their neighbouring towns and villages about some kind of speculation regarding Harry Potter’s demise. The two most commonly in circulation were that Harry Potter’s soul had either been ripped apart by his ghostmen or that it disappeared without a trace.
, exasperated. ‘Alright. Pansy wants me to tell you to get back together with Weasley. This is your second fight with him and it’s been a week since then. She thinks it’s enough.’
'Yes,' Harry smiled, gaze fixed on Draco's face. They stared at each other oblivious to the whistles and catcalls.
'Moving on or moving away?' Ron asked, stroking his back. His uncannily accurate intuition was a balm to Harry's troubled soul.
'You're screwed.' Pansy shook her head and told him that day. Draco vehemently denied it. He had it all under control.
John was silent for a moment before a thought occurred to him. ‘This tells me that you’ve deduced all this before I even came home. And you still let the mess in the room be undisturbed? Why couldn’t you have at least attempted to clean it?’
Draco and Potter's dynamic had undoubtedly changed ever since Potter got that dragon lily tattoo on Halloween, even though Potter's behaviour towards him didn't. He still went to classes with Draco and sat next to him, partnering him in Charms, Potions and DADA. No one had mentioned anything about the tattoo in the two weeks since and Draco wasn't a fool to harbour hope that they didn't understand its significance too. He wasn't going to talk about it for as long as he could.
'Smith,' Draco confirmed. 'I swear he either slept or skipped all his Potions classes from year one.' Harry massaged Draco's temples and they slipped into a tired sleep.
Ron folds his hands and frowns- two things that scream danger. Harry's guard goes up. 'What's wrong with you today, Harry?'
‘Not like they would tell us, Potter, but I suppose we should assume so,’ said Draco, pointing to the memo.
‘You would do it nevertheless,’ Cas retorted and stared at the coffee table. The mess immediately sorted itself into neat piles.
Potter looked from his elf to Draco and back again before shrugging out of his apron. He patted Draco's shoulder on his way out. 'Kreacher has your best interests at heart.'
‘It is as she said, John. A child is missing. It could be anything from murder to trafficking. I didn’t take the case because of Ms.Hope. I agreed because of the ten year old,’ Sherlock replied, walking towards the window and staring out at it as usual.
The day of planting arrived sooner than expected. The core of the Green Group had formed a careful blueprint of where every shrub was supposed to go and were currently supervising the younger years. Every student or staff member who wished to plant picked one from the clusters brought in from Hogsmeade and Forbidden Forest and planted it in the assigned place. Draco was proud that the idea had been a product of his own genius.
Harry laughed and plucked Teddy out of his hands. It was probably the familiarity but the toddler calmed down a bit. Harry paced up and down the room, one hand continuously patting Teddy's back.
Draco snarled, hissing as he deliberately showed his canines. Potter cooed and ruffled Draco's hair before getting back onto his chair.
Harry knew his speeches and actions would alone not be enough to wash away years of resentment and was aware that the lull of the past few months after school started was only suppression. He knew he decided to let bygones be bygones partly because he didn't want to lose more people and partly because something changed when he died. He also knew that wasn't everyone's case so he did what he could- wait. Because change was gradual and inevitable.
'So,' he began, fidgeting with his shirt, 'Blaise told us, technically it was Blaise's mother, that muggles celebrate Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday of November and well,' he gulped, ' well,' he licked his lips, 'we just..'
Kreacher padded into the room, one bony finger pointing accusingly. 'House elves be trained in them things. House elves be knowing what is helping their masters.' He bowed to Harry and spoke in a much more obedient tone, 'Kreacher be taking over the dinner, Lord Potter.'
'Mr. Phantom,' Al and Jamie correct her at the same time and make gagging faces at each other when they realise it.
‘Someone with a big enough motive and plenty enough resources to carry it out for two months,’ Bobby continued.
Sam rolled his eyes. ‘Okay, this is what we know till now: seven different kinds of creatures have been preying on people left, right, centre for about two months and these are more powerful than the ones we previously faced, almost impossible to kill.’
‘All the eighth years share this common room, Pansy. It could have happened in front of Portrait Tonks, in all possibility. Don’t be unnecessarily excited,’ chided Blaise once more.
Draco tilted to the side a bit to capture Harry's lips with his own. 'Yes,' he breathed as they separated.
‘For distracting me from the game by chattering on about this and making me lose the race,’ Cas replied, flipping his wrist.
When Draco couldn't sleep that night, he took out some parchment and dipped his quill in the ink. Potter was sleeping peacefully when he left the note on the table next to his bed. Draco couldn't help but smooth Potter's hair and graze his knuckles on his cheek. He returned to his room feeling inexplicably light and elated. His sleep was uninterrupted.
It had been easy for Draco to get a first edition copy of Rare Charms and Unique Spells for Granger, a chocolate frog card made in honour of Fred Weasley for Weasley and his sister and an assorted collection of Celestina Warbeck's classics for Longbottom, who loved them and transferred some of his admiration for her onto Blaise as well.
‘But it’s been charmed to repel non magical people. Jane said it looks like a dilapidated castle in ruins if I were to ever see it. So you see, Dr. Watson, I absolutely cannot go search for her there. It has to be someone else.’ Ms. Hope begged, her desperation and distress evident in her tone.
He settled into the armchair opposite Draco's that the latter had drawn close to the fire and held Teddy to his chest.
'Here are the gifts, bitches!' Pansy screamed, wand shooting confetti into the air as she twirled, tripped and fell over the neatly wrapped presents. 'Oops,' she said, grinning up at them with a dazed look in her eyes.
He tried to soothe his friend. ‘It’s really sinister and I get a feeling that this is just the tip of the iceberg. I’m sure we can sort it out, however.’ He wasn’t really as certain as he was making it sound and knew that neither Ron nor Draco were particularly convinced. He believed Ron, though. If he said the girl had radiated magnetic dark magic, then she had done it. It’s the comparison of its strength to horcruxes that was disturbing him.
If their first kiss was any indication, Draco would be a fool to do anything of the sort. He smiled and snuggled into Potter, inhaling his scent and letting more tears fall. People passed by and Draco knew it was the first time he was crying openly, but he didn't care.
Harry slipped his fingers into Draco's hair and scratched his scalp gently. 'One day,' Draco began, 'we'd be bringing out our kids to the park for play dates and that day seems more in the near future than distant. I'm more surprised that I'm no longer intimidated by it.'
Years of practice as a physician and several prior experiences with Sherlock on his cases made it possible for John to keep his expression open, patient and gentle in spite of the wobbling in his brows that suggested they wanted to disappear into his hairline. He could perhaps write a book titled “The Quirks of Sherlock Holmes,” and there were going to be two parts to it, one containing his gestures and body language and the other explaining what they really meant. John knew Sherlock was an enigma, he just had it reinforced on occasions such as these. He was fully aware that his friend was by no means interested in the Lovhoods, just Ms.Hope’s reaction to them.
‘It happened just fifteen minutes ago. George was at the back, making note of our stock and I was manning the counter. It was when I was thinking of how finally after seven years of the war things have gone back to normal that I saw her appear before my eyes. Literally. If I didn’t know better, I’d say she appeared out of thin air but I’ll recognise that pop of apparition and the feeling of disorientation too well for that. It can’t even be considered accidental because Apparition is advanced magic. Children usually have a tolerable control over their magic by the time they’re ten and these kinds of things rarely happen with kids, if at all they do.’ Ron finished, shivering a little and dragging the sleeves of his jumper down.
Draco's gaze was hooked onto the way the emerald orbs were reflecting the sunlight, brimming with satisfaction.
'...and mum said she wants me to go into jewellery designing,' Pansy was telling Millie and Ginny while Luna hung upside down from the tree by the Lake under which they currently sat. 'That brings the total of what she ever wanted me to become to four hundred and seventy eight.'
‘Someone powerful enough to command supernatural creatures and cause them to behave erratically,’ Sam answered, furiously rubbing his temples.
Pansy sat up at that. 'That,' she said, pointing to the cam, 'is excellent blackmail material that will serve me for the next forty years to come. I'm too much of a Slytherin to let go of that kind of treasure.'
Harry looked between his two friends. ‘You people sound as if I don’t do anything without telling him.’
'So, what do you think, Professor?' Longbottom asked, pulling his sleeves down his palms. Blaise tried to steady him with a hand on his back.
Ron mock gagged. 'I don't understand how you could tolerate this everyday for almost three months,' he told Pansy, waving a hand in Harry and Draco's direction.
Five minutes later, Draco felt accomplished at having shoven Potter into the chair with a threat of a body bind if he moved.
‘Yes,’ said three voices in unison. They turned to see Ginny walking up to them. She slung an arm around her brother as she approached the group of four.
Ms.Hope deigned to concede with a short bow and continued as if she hadn’t heard Sherlock. ‘You don’t have to believe in magic, Mr.Holmes. The fact remains that my niece disappeared without a trace. It’s been two days and there have been no ransom calls suggesting abduction nor has Nancy returned. She’s ten years old, sir. I beg you to do everything you can in this impossible situation and at least find some light where others couldn’t.’ She became teary once more towards the end as she held her own trembling hands tightly in a grip.
'Wrong,' Goldstein and Lovegood both called out at the same time, sending Daphne, Millie, Pansy and Hannah Abbot into fits of giggles.
Potter often rolled his eyes at Kreacher's extremely formal terminology. 'It's the sitting room or the living room, Kreacher. We are in the twentieth century, for God's sake!'
The sky was clear, the wind was cool and the clouds were white, fluffy, enticing. For a moment, Harry didn't want to go down. He could imagine what was going on.
It was not in tune and slower than the original song but Harry lost himself in it. Teddy had slept somewhere in the middle of it. Opposite him, Draco was also sleeping, head drooping to his left, mouth slightly open. Harry only had energy left to smile at the sight before he closed his eyes as well.
‘How do you mean?’ she asked from her place on Ron’s lap without putting down the book she was reading.
Harry blushed and blushed until he was sure his face resembled a tomato. He was caught and he didn't want to lie to himself, his best friend or Draco. Luckily, Hermione came to his rescue.
