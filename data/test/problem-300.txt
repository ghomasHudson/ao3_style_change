Harry laughed and was about to say that he could just bake more for Malfoy tomorrow, but his grin vanished when he saw the concerned look on Malfoy’s face. He froze when Malfoy leaned towards him and grabbed the sides of his head. His long fingers brushed Harry’s bangs aside and Harry could feel his hand against his skin and everything suddenly felt hot.
Later that night, when they get into bed together, Malfoy tucks himself against Harry’s chest. "Goodnight, Potter," he mutters softly, bringing the blanket up to his shoulders.
In exchange for tweaking the roster to Harry’s benefit, Luna made him perform all the heavy lifting duties for the day, while she worked on her friendship bracelets behind the till. From time to time, she would read aloud from a horoscope magazine, citing how Harry’s love life ‘is at a stalemate’ and ‘communication is key’. By the time his shift ended at 5 o’clock, Harry’s back hurt like a bitch, there was a blister forming on his left thumb and he had made a mental note to ask Draco his birthdate.
Harry yelped and turned around so fast he nearly banged his head against an open cabinet.
Pale eyebrows rose quizzically. “Why you?”
did. He claimed all my work and contributions as his own and painted me as a useless Auror. He wanted to discredit me, and I guess it worked. There are people in the DMLE who still consider me a criminal. And he got the promotion, while I'm still here, like you said, being left behind."
Don’t get Harry wrong: he recognises how much Faith Apparatus could help the Federation win The War, but—
Malfoy peers into the cauldron and studies the bubbling pink solution. Then he takes a ladle-full of the potion and pours it into a small cup.
“Do you want dinner?” Harry asks, still touching Malfoy’s face. He notices then that Malfoy’s voice has returned to normal and he doesn’t sound like he has a blocked nose anymore.
“Well, I can’t work in my current state,” said Draco. “So I wish to have lunch in bed.”
To be frank, Harry was
, and nobody else’s. Nobody had told him to like Harry. Everything he felt was born purely out of his own heart and soul. There was also the undeniable rebellious aspect to it, which made the whole notion so much more enticing.
“Since when have you cared so much about the rules?” Blaise asked skeptically.
Harry didn’t manage to watch longer before he was being angrily honked at from behind. Hastily pulling down his visor, Harry released the brakes and continued his journey home while adding another mental note to the long list of things he wanted to learn about Draco Malfoy.
“Shut up, Theo. Didn’t you say you want to skip sports clubs this year?”
Draco sighed; the sound of his breath was so close, Harry felt his ear grow warm. "Why do you always say incredibly nice things?"
"Continue with our humble existence?" Harry quipped, earning a chuckle from Draco. Harry felt his stomach drop.
He sighed and started gathering the ingredients for dinner.
“You are in no state to Apparate, and neither am I,” Harry commented. “Come on, I know a great coffee place not too far from here.”
It was a short walk, and they were both healthy athletes, but as soon as the bedroom door closed behind Draco, they were both breathless with anticipation.
When Harry returned after using the loo, Malfoy was still removing clothes from his briefcase. He stood awkwardly for what felt like a minute as he watched Malfoy unpack.
Harry smiled apologetically. "You still have the second half to catch up. I've been watching you closely, and I think I know how you can turn this around and start getting your shots in."
This was Draco’s first time living away from his parents. Harry was his first ever roommate.
Harry leaned in again as Draco met him halfway. He cupped Draco's jaw as their kiss grew deeper, both mouths parting. Draco grabbed his T-shirt, shivering when he felt Harry's other hand slide down the curve of his bare spine. He leaned back until his head rested on a pillow, pulling Harry with him, all this without ever leaving his lips.
of the semester, Harry had other things on his mind. More pressing, more
Draco shrugged. “What I like doing is none of his business,” he said, wrapping an arm around Harry. “I only won because of my teammates. And you. I couldn’t have done it without you.”
He expects a witty reply, a biting remark or even maybe another smack, but Malfoy smiles. It’s one of those rare ones that reaches his eyes and makes his face bloom with joy and always causes Harry to forget to breathe.
business, okay?”
“My goodness, Potter. Chaperoning students is a terribly dull task,” Malfoy scoffs. “Why are you so eager?”
“You mean you don’t drink alcohol?” When Draco nodded, Potter added, “You know they also serve things like sparkling water and soda, right?”
Panting, Harry went to Draco and pulled him into a kiss.
Draco wondered whether Snape was going to tell his father about how abysmal he was. He imagined Lucius’s displeased expression, that twist of the corner of his mouth that signified how disappointed he was in Draco.
He understood what it felt to lose control of his mind. He knew how scary it was. Malfoy was afraid of how this infection would affect him. Healer Kim had said that they were healthy, but she had also warned that this could change anytime. They were supposed to monitor each other for symptoms and remind each other to take potions.
Draco's hand hovered hesitantly over Harry's. The Auror muttered a quick apology before grabbing Draco's elbow and yanking them both to St Mungo’s.
required to play an entire match at this level—
"And suffocate while unconscious."
“Yeah, Harry obviously can’t greet you himself because he has to get ready with his team,” Weasley explained. “By the way, you’re coming with us to our house after Harry’s game. We have some work to do before Harry’s parents arrive.”
By Healer Kim's orders, they drank the yellow potion in front of her. It tasted sour, like freshly squeezed lemons.
Less than a minute later, he grabbed his wand, jumped out of bed, and hurried towards the living room, where Potter was tossing and turning restlessly on the transfigured couch. His tanned skin was pale, beads of sweat perched on his eyebrows and his eyes were screwed shut as if he was bracing for pain. His hands held the blanket in a vice grip; when Draco placed his hand over one of Potter’s, it was cold and clammy.
“Hold on to me,” Harry’s voice instructed while he pulled Draco’s hand to wind around his waist. Draco, already feeling off-balance, wrapped both his arms around Harry.
“I don’t have a driver’s license.”
Draco reached the gym early and started getting ready way before the other students arrived. By the time the captain entered the changing rooms, Draco was already in his sports attire, standing in front of a mirror with fingers in his long hair.
Harry pushed a large trolley filled with volleyballs to one of the courts. “I always practise whenever I can.”
Harry, finally free of his helmet, gaped at Draco. “Then why’d you confess to me
“Apologies for the interruption,” said a Mediwitch. “I was asked to lead you to Mrs Kelley as soon as you arrived.”
With a sigh, Draco went to a corner of the hut and kicked a large rock the size of Quaffle to Harry’s feet. “Do you have a wand?”
Draco had said.
Even with Granger’s explanations, Draco struggled to grasp the perplexing rules. If someone had asked him about the match later, he wouldn’t be able to answer.
When Harry opened his eyes, it was already bright and the space beside him was empty. He realised that he had been woken up by a rapid tapping noise. He slipped on his spectacles and saw a large brown eagle-owl outside the window, a parcel hanging from its talons. As soon as Harry opened the window, the owl swooped in and deposited the parcel on the bed. The owl flapped around the room twice and then flew back out.
They didn’t see each other for the rest of the day.
Healer Kim's head disappeared into the fire. Shortly after, a leather briefcase shot out of the fireplace and landed on the coffee table. The briefcase bore the Auror Office insignia.
Healer Kim quickly examined Draco while her team cast monitoring charms on them. "Get him to Iso ICU 6," she ordered, shooting another spell Harry didn't recognize at Draco. Then she turned her attention to Harry. She placed herself between the two Aurors, while the other healers levitated Draco away.
His unfortunate crew had been less prepared for the sudden jump, so there were a number of accidents, albeit nothing serious.
But watching someone else, particularly Harry Potter, struggle with nightmares was terrible. He wanted to do something about it. He would do anything to relieve Potter of those nightmares. But only if Potter let him.
Neville Longbottom, the most responsible one in the house, waited for Harry by the front door, twirling a ring of keys around an index finger. Harry zipped past him, out the door and gate and climbed into the backseat of Ron’s car. Ron was behind the wheel, nervously rubbing his palms together while Dean Thomas rode shotgun, his charcoal stained hands nonchalantly flipping through the pages of his own sketchbook. After Neville settled next to Harry, house keys jingling from his belt, the four of them made their way to campus. Ron’s radio was broken, so Dean sang off-key renditions of Spice Girls’ hit songs throughout the journey.
“That tastes
They stay like that for several minutes until the thin fabric of Harry’s T-shirt becomes uncomfortably wet. “Um, Malfoy? You should get dressed.”
Draco's breaths are uneven when he pouts. “Are you sure we can’t kiss right now?”
Potter laughed. “Not predictable. Consistent. They’re different.”
Harry’s practice mainly involved repetition. Draco would toss a ball a certain height and Harry would hit it towards the opponent’s court. They repeated this until Harry had sent all the balls flying across the net.
“Yes, Thankfully, the ingredients for the antidote are much easier to procure. I have them all in my shop. I’ll owl you when I’m done.”
The days that followed were akin to a honeymoon. Being with Harry was exactly how one would imagine being with the Saviour of the Wizarding World would be like; he was passionate, loving and did nothing halfway. Since there was nothing much to do while trapped in a small house, most of their time was spent eating or reading. They also spent time talking either with each other or with their friends via Floo.
“Er, hi, um,” Harry stammered. “Yesterday Mrs Kelley of the Wizengamot was found unconscious in her office. We found this next to her.” He held up a small plastic bag containing pieces of a broken vial. “We suspect she was poisoned. We need you to figure out what it was… and make the antidote.” Harry winced at his own words. “I can bring you to see her if you want.”
“You two have been unconscious since yesterday,” Weasley explained. “It's great that you found the perp behind the illegal potions ring, but you really should have waited for back-up to arrive before charging in.”
Hermione beamed. "Whatever happens, Harry, we're proud of you and we'll always love you."
“Why don’t we test that?” Harry suggested mischievously. Malfoy only managed to yelp in indignation before Harry took the last scone from the tray and hurled it towards the open window.
Harry struggles to control his breathing; it is impossible to ignore the weight and feel of Malfoy’s head on his chest. “Why?”
Draco’s obsession with Potter was insatiable.
They took this chance to discover what the other liked and how to please each other. As expected, Harry was an enthusiastic and fast learner. Being the centre of Harry's attention was overwhelming, but Draco doubted he could live without it now that he had gotten a taste.
They didn’t even go into warp. They have somehow materialized at a different part of the galaxy in a split second. Like teleportation but with both of their ships. Like magic.
"No, not like that!" Potter pulled at his hair in frustration. "Why is it so hard for you to understand?"
“What if he doesn’t like him?” Uncle Harry sounds distressed.
They entered a glass box with no furniture. As soon as their bodies passed through completely, a section of the glass wall parted and a team of wizards and witches in Protective Bubble-Body Charms hurried towards them. Healer Kim, leading the charge, fired a spell at Draco.
With a placating smile, Blaise reached into his robes and extracted a long black cuboid box, larger than a wand case. Draco’s eyes widened and his body straightened. Blaise moved closer and allowed the Auror to grab the box out of his hand. He sat down on the bench as his friend tore off the lid and gasped.
The universe’s supply of dilithium is running scarce, no thanks to the alien race of
“Then they are exquisite. I am thoroughly impressed by your culinary skills, Potter,” Malfoy remarked with a flat tone, but a tiny smirk adorned his lips. “I implore that you continue cooking for me every day until we get out of here.”
“Partners!” His voice boomed within the lecture hall, not needing a microphone. “When I read out your names, you must sit with your partner in the seats I designate for you. No changing partners or seats without my permission.”
Zabini smiles, the line of his lips smooth and manufactured; he must have practised this smile for ages in front of a mirror. “I would be happy to provide sustenance.”
"Clearly it's not enough for me!" Harry sat up. "It still tears me apart, how I could have… I could have killed you."
Oh, right. Harry had slept through the night. He tried to remember if he had any nightmares. Perhaps he did since he could feel that familiar throb in the back of his head that he always had whenever he had a restless sleep, but he couldn’t recall exactly what it was. Which, Harry supposed, was what dreams were supposed to be like.
Harry barely noticed the Rosenberg team arriving when they took their place at the other bench. Their jerseys were black with bright red along the seams and the font.
Later, Draco explained that after getting Harry’s letter, he had owled Luna and asked for her help. She had enlisted Ron’s assistance and together, they plotted to have Harry return home early so that he could spend the first moments of his birthday with Draco.
“Bring up the tempo. Decide what you want to do with the ball before you catch it.” Harry couldn’t elaborate more than that. He knew little about basketball, after all, but he trusted Draco to figure it out. “I know you can make the ball go wherever you want it to.”
He preferred playing video games over sports, but never missed Harry’s football matches.
"F… Forget I said that," Malfoy squeaks, bowing his head as his hand continues to rub Harry's chest. "I'm sorry."
Harry stopped walking around shirtless after he noticed Draco hiding his flushed face behind an upside-down book.
“I wish,” Teddy says, beaming, “for a big, happy family.”
After lunch, Malfoy resumed his report-writing while Harry kept himself busy in the kitchens. Towards evening, Harry proudly presented Malfoy with a tray of English scones and more tea.
Harry recalls Madam Pomfrey listing the symptoms to watch out for, including the side effects of the potion. Even though Malfoy’s body is hot and feverish, he himself feels cold, and so insists on being pressed up against Harry to take advantage of his body heat.
“Of course it is. Can you imagine my father entrusting it to anybody else?” For some reason Draco finds this idea amusing and chuckles. “Whenever the Captain gives us the order to jump, we activate the Black Alert. Then my father hands over the ship to me and my crew. So during these short moments,
Harry dozes off at some point, jerking awake at the sound of knocking on the door. He is still drowsy, so he only realises that Draco has walked over to the door by himself and opened it when he hears Madam Pomfrey’s loud exclamation of relief. The nurse trots into the sitting room with Draco in tow.
of my father.”
As Potter led the way, Draco observed Potter’s gait. If Potter stood straight, he would be almost as tall as Draco. But now he walked with his shoulders hunched, as though the act of saving the wizarding world had also thrust its problems onto his teenage shoulders.
The first time Potter pulled off his Invisibility Cloak in front of Draco, the blond had yelped in surprise and accidentally banged his head against the headboard.
“Has it occurred to you that perhaps,” –Zabini’s expression is as icy as steel— “the Federation does not deem you trustworthy enough to be privy to this information?”
“Yes, I want this and so much more,” Harry said, feeling nervous yet hopeful. His worries evaporated when Draco smiled.
mind their own businesses.”
“You didn’t have to call her, you know,” Malfoy whines.
Harry briskly sends a Patronus to the hospital wing. Then he takes Malfoy's arm and tugs it around his own shoulders, while his other hand pulls Malfoy closer by the waist. Malfoy slumps readily against his body as Harry half-carries-half-guides him back to his quarters.
“Can’t help it.” Harry made sure his hand was obscured by the tray before skimming the edge of Draco’s sharp jaw with a finger. “You’re beautiful.”
Madam Pomfrey looks up at Harry. Her eyes twitch and narrow as though trying to give him an admonishing glare, but her gaze softens when she observes the way Harry is holding Malfoy.
did you mean—"
Harry didn't move from his spot, shuffling his feet instead. "So, um, what do you want for dinner? I saw fresh tomatoes and, ah, I can make pasta for us, if you, er, eat pasta, or you can choose something else
They sit together in silence for a while. Harry suspects that Malfoy can hear his loud heartbeats but neither says anything. At some point, Harry stops touching Malfoy's jaw and moves on to idly play with his blond hair. To his pleasant surprise, Malfoy lets him do it without any complaints.
Harry had been feeling sombre and guilty over the apothecary accident, but Draco had been nothing but gentle with him since they got back. And now, as Draco closed his mouth over a piece of chicken, pulled it off Harry’s fork and moaned in satisfaction as he chewed, Harry felt his cheeks getting warm.
When Draco asked Blaise to give him a lift to the City Stadium, he hadn’t expected to be interrogated in return.
He was too tired and devastated to lie to Pansy, so he spilled. He recounted from the beginning: They crossed paths at the Ministry about two months ago. Potter had asked for his address on the pretence of returning his wand, but even after doing that, they kept on exchanging letters until two weeks prior, Potter had asked him out on a date. That was when they embarked on their nightly trysts.
The room was large, capable of fitting more than a hundred students, with tiered seating structured in a semi-circle surrounding a pitched floor, where the lecturer's desk and blackboards were located. Ron and Hermione had chosen seats in the middle of the hall, leaving an empty space between them for Harry.
“Stop that. I love you, and that’s
The largest of the men, probably the leader, advanced towards Harry with glee gleaming in his beady eyes.
Weasley parked in front of a corner-lot double-storey house. It was homey, with a modest yard in front. The compound was surrounded by white walls and a small black iron gate. After Harry woke up, he guided Draco through the gate. Draco recognised Harry’s motorcycle parked near the door and also caught a glimpse of a small garden in the yard — someone with a green thumb must be living in the house.
Draco couldn’t tell exactly how long they stared at each other. He was proud he managed to keep a straight face even though his heart was hammering like crazy. His palms were sweaty when he reached into his bag and grabbed a biro.
He was in the middle of another yawn when his shoulder bumped into something — someone, causing him to reel back and drop his backpack. There was a loud crashing of books on the floor, followed by a pained grunt and rustling of clothes. Startled, Harry blinked at the person he had bumped into, but could only see the top of his blond head as the other student bent down to collect his things.
Harry knew better than to argue. He followed Malfoy’s instructions, rested his head on the cushion on Malfoy’s lap and carefully pushed back his bangs without touching the pustule. He tried not to think of how close he was to Malfoy and was actually relieved when Malfoy took off his glasses and told him to close his eyes.
Harry smiled. “It’s fine. You can ask me anything.” He pulled himself back into a sitting position. “My adoptive dad is a high school teacher. He makes a decent wage but I don’t want to rely on him for everything. I try to save up money to buy my own things. I’ve been taking part-time jobs since high school.”
One week later, Harry chanced upon Draco at the Auror Office when the blond came to submit a report. Harry caught his eye and shortly afterwards, found himself slammed against the wall in a broom cupboard by a charming Unspeakable, who was crafty with a Silencing Charm.
Draco frowned. “What’s wrong with them? They are supposed to be romantic.”
Draco withdrew and wrapped his arms around himself. He was wearing a long-sleeved jersey shirt over a cotton T-shirt and a pair of black joggers. He had left his hair untied, letting the pale strands brush against his ears and face. When he moved his head, his hair swayed, and his black earring flickered in and out of sight like a tease. “What do you need me to do?”
When it quickly becomes clear that Malfoy is too shocked to move, Harry steers him back to the sleeping area and to the wardrobe tucked in the corner.
Draco believed that in the future, people would grow tired of them and leave them alone. Everyone would have to live with the fact that the Saviour of the wizarding world was already taken and off the market. They would let them live their lives.
Draco's mind was still reeling and going over Harry's words when Theo lightly elbowed his arm.
They never brought each other home. They never went on dates. They never addressed what they did, but not due to any lack of effort from Harry. Whenever he tried to talk about it, Draco would stare at him in trepidation and despair, as though Harry was going to curse him or strike him with a sword. Then he would use whatever Unspeakable skills he had to escape and disappear.
Harry apologised to the cashier with a sheepish smile before heading to where his husband was.
Before he could retort, Draco was called to meet Healer Park while Potter went into Healer Algot’s office. Healer Park was a middle-aged gentleman with kind brown eyes. Draco wasn’t too forthcoming, so the Healer just asked him harmless ice-breaking questions. After an hour, the Healer gave him an appointment slip for the following week.
They were strong enough individually, but even stronger together.
Just like Healer Kim, Ron had a Bubble-Head Charm around his floating head. “How are you, mate?”
“That was brilliant,” he wheezed, nipping Draco’s lower lip. “You’d make a magnificent setter.”
“Potter?” Draco yelled, a hand shielding his squinted eyes from the harsh wind. His dark robes billowed out around his knees  “What are you doing here?”
Harry’s green eyes were wide open, staring up at him. “What did you think of the game?”
Draco stood frozen for a good five minutes before he finally went into the other office and took his usual seat on the sofa opposite Healer Park.
Malfoy nods and turns towards the wardrobe. Harry manages to escape and not look when the towel drops to the floor.
"Do these people have faces?"
Harry chuckled and shook his head. “I saw you at the outdoor basketball court. I was on my way back from work.”
Harry immediately grabbed his hips and pulled; Draco had to grab Harry’s shoulders to remain balanced. The tips of their noses almost collided. Draco carefully removed Harry’s round spectacles and placed them on a nearby dresser, out of the way.
Potter tilted his head, thinking. "I think so, but I don't remember how to do them."
“Maybe after the cruise. After you rescue me,” Harry teased, flashing a grin that made Draco blush.
“I had a great time, Malfoy.” Potter beamed. “I’ll see you around.”
As Hermione continued explaining the rules and positions, the crowd suddenly erupted into cheers. Harry looked up to see the Hogwarts team walking in with Snape leading. They dropped their bags by the players’ bench. The five starting players started removing their jackets while the others took their seats on the bench.
“Good game, Harry!” Granger said as Weasley started driving the car into the main road. “You must be exhausted. Why don’t you take a nap back there? You always do that after a morning game.”
Sirius released Draco’s hand and shrugged. “Not very well. Your mother and I are distant cousins, though. How is Narcissa?”
Longbottom and Thomas took care of cleaning up. Weasley sent Granger home in his car while Draco found himself on Harry’s motorcycle again.
Harry's statement made Draco’s cheeks flush pink. Their moment was once again interrupted by Snape, who suddenly appeared behind Draco and glared down his sharp nose at Harry.
“Draco, pass!” Blaise yelled when Draco gained control of the ball at the six-minute mark.
Harry slumped back in his seat and crossed his arms. “He might.”
carries a secret weapon that her captain believes is the key to winning The War.
“Mother, I’m so sorry about this,” Draco began but was instantly cut off.
They broke up a few days before July 31st. It was after breakfast, and Draco had just refused to attend Potter's birthday party.
Weasley calmed down just enough to answer. “Yeah, I think he’s gone to bed. I’ll go get him.”
The Healer had advised Draco to seek forgiveness.
Harry felt an invisible weight lift off his shoulders while another, newer and more hopeful, sensation settled in his stomach. "Then let's make sure we make this work," he said resolutely. "It takes effort from both of us. We have to try."
"No. Don't make me leave. I do like you," Harry blurts out, tightening his grip on Malfoy's shoulders. "Regardless of whether it's convenient or not. I actually wanted to tell you this at Hogsmeade, but—”
It is so intimate and comfortably domestic. As he eats, Harry has to remind himself that they aren’t boyfriends or lovers. Even though he suspects Malfoy may have feelings for him, neither has confessed yet so it is still up in the air, and Harry shouldn’t jump to conclusions about—
“Hey, hi,” Draco’s voice sounded slightly different through the telephone line, but it still sent joy through Harry’s entire body. “It’s me, Draco. Malfoy. Is this a bad time?”
The devastated expression that crossed Potter’s face made him shut his mouth. Potter closed the bathroom door behind him without replying. They tacitly agreed that it was too late for this conversation.
Draco's kiss made Harry's body sing, and as his hands brushed the flawless skin on Draco's back, Harry wished for this harmony to never end.
Draco walked to the registration desk, which was manned by a thin woman with greying hair. There were two white doors beside her, each labelled with the name of a Healer.
blond down to the roots, side-parted and stylish, the tips stopping short of his sharp, clean-shaven jaw. His eyelashes were as pale as his flawless skin and Harry could see some shine over his pink lips.
Draco felt angry with himself. He hated making Potter sad, but he also knew he would be eaten alive if he went to the party. He'd be the only Slytherin, the only one who had been on the opposite side of the war. The only one with a Dark Mark. This conflict within him was like a bundle of thorns, pricking him from the inside. "Your friends hate me, Potter."
It was late at night when Harry returned, his body fatigued but eyes bright and happy upon seeing Draco safe. He agreed immediately when Draco requested to go to Malfoy Manor. They packed some overnight clothes before Harry Side-Along Apparated him to his parents’ home.
Once done, Potter stayed in his spot, gazing up at Draco for a long time, his expression thoughtful and in wonder. Draco stared back, taking in his unruly black hair and tanned skin, and finding himself lost in thoughts about him.
He collapsed onto the couch, tucked his legs underneath him and picked up the cordless telephone. Despite having already memorised the number, he glanced at the small paper in his hand, just to make sure.
a new strain, though. I suspect the man you captured yesterday has been modifying them, both magically and genetically. That could be why you are not exhibiting the common symptoms. You might get them later. You might not get them at all. It is really difficult to be certain.”
Draco's lips twisted in displeasure as he glared at the table, arms firmly crossed over his chest. "I know what you want, but it's not going to work. You'll get sick of me very quickly. You hate when people keep secrets from you. My whole career is a secret."
But Draco neither said nor did anything more to chase Harry out.
"Be careful, mate," Ron warned under his breath.
“Sure. Ask Ginny. Tell everyone I’m taking Harry home, okay?”
Their first date was on a warm summer night.
“You play basketball?” Harry said as though this was the most interesting news ever. “My friend Ron does, too. Did you start playing in high school?”
“I know you’re doing this to protect me,” Malfoy says later when they are both recovering from their highs, his back against Harry's chest. “I think… I don’t care anymore. I’m more worried about you, though.”
Harry smiled, a hand caressing the smooth skin over Draco’s thigh. “So do
Even though he physically towered above everybody else, Remus was probably the most non-threatening and mild person Draco had ever met. His light brown hair had flecks of grey and his eyes crinkled when he smiled.
Greg got the rebound and dunked the ball through the hoop. They scored two points, but Draco tasted bitterness in his mouth.
Malfoy huffs. "That can't be further from the truth. No, what I mean is I prefer to do things according to my own choices, out of my own volition, and not because certain circumstances force me to.”
Potter didn’t wait for any reply. He just smiled and kissed Draco's knuckles before entering his Healer's office.
about basketball, Harry! You never take any interest when
He hadn't had to wake Potter up for two nights in a row now, but it was too early to feel complacent. Nightmares loved giving a false sense of security and appearing again when the victim least expected it.
“Starting countdown,” one of the twins – Parvati? – reports as she pulls up a timer onto the screen, dialling back from thirty. The lights in the cockpit change back from red to normal off-white.
Draco tilted his head and regarded Potter curiously, which made the other wizard chuckle nervously.
Harry rolled his eyes while he pulled on a white shirt. “For God’s sake.” He pushed wet bangs up his head, shoved a pair of round-rimmed spectacles onto his face and grabbed his backpack. As he leaped down the staircase, he glanced at his wristwatch and grumbled about how they weren’t even
“Head of Engineering, Lieutenant Commander Malfoy,” Zabini says, but the young blond waves him off.
good,” Draco purred, sliding a hand along Harry’s forearm.
He had to face Malfoy during the day, at night and in his dreams. Could Harry really survive this?
But they could think about that later.
"Well," Harry scratched his forehead, "I don't
“We won’t know until we try,” Grandma says kindly.
"I don't do everything myself," Draco pointed out. He was stretched next to Potter, his ankles resting on the coffee table and a cup of tea between his hands. "You're helping me with them now."
Harry feels flattered. He is also ashamed that he never bothered to do extra homework on
That night, Pansy, Daphne Greengrass and Vincent Crabbe threw a private congratulatory party for the basketball club boys right in Draco’s sitting room. Draco managed to have a decent dinner and play a few rounds of games with his friends before announcing he was going to bed. He had over-exerted both his mind and body during the game, so after he changed and got under the blankets, sleep immediately overcame him until sunrise.
He lowered his hands and tried to imitate Lucius, from his smile down to the way he offered a handshake. “You must be the captain, Roger Davies. I’m Draco Malfoy, first year.”
"You look tired," she observed. "Do you need to rest at home?"
“I already apologised for sixth year!” Harry protested, quickly glancing at Malfoy. His Silencing Charm held, though, and Malfoy was writing without a care for the world.
“I don’t need you, you know. I can live just fine on my own.”
Harry glanced at his watch. The party was supposed to go on until midnight; it was barely ten o'clock. "I'm alright. Besides, I don't want to leave my own birthday party early."
Potter brought him to a fancy Muggle restaurant, which served juicy steak and excellent red wine. Afterwards, Draco tasted this wine again when they kissed in the hallway of Grimmauld Place.
“Malfoy is allergic to Pepper-up,” Harry says.
Harry paces for a minute inside Malfoy’s spacious bathroom, his bare feet slapping against the tiles as he thinks things through.
“There you are!” the bushy-haired woman exclaimed, running over to give each of them a hug.
“I’m pleased to meet you again so soon,” Harry remarks sincerely as he and Draco walk side-by-side in the hallway. He isn’t sure where they are going but he follows his new companion readily, Dean and Seamus trailing after them several paces behind.
"I can't say I’m surprised, Harry," said Hermione, her voice clear despite the Bubble-Head Charm. "You have been obsessed with him for almost a decade now."
Malfoy’s cheeks and nose are adorably pink, his eyes half-lidded and drowsy while hot puffs of air escape his parted pale lips in short bursts. Droplets of sweat perch on his forehead and eyebrows while his platinum blond hair is more tousled than Harry has ever seen it.
did you just call me?”
Harry glanced at the red glow of the medallion around his neck and pulled his stool closer to the other man. "Draco, we need to talk."
“There," Harry said contently, dropping back onto the stool. "I should have done that as soon as I found it.”
Harry felt warmth exude his entire body as he walked over and pulled Draco into a tight embrace. He pressed his nose against the side of his neck, inhaling his scent like a starving man. “Fuck, Draco. I’m so glad you’re back.”
Teddy continues playing with his dragon, turning his hair green to match the stuffed toy’s colouring.
"Let's go to St Mungo’s," Harry said, holding out a hand to Draco. "Mrs Kelley is getting worse. I'll bring you to her so that you can see the effects of the poison for yourself. It'll help you figure out what’s happened."
“Yes, we are sure,” replied Healer Kim calmly. “We have identified the genome from the spores. It
“There’s a tournament there tomorrow,” Draco muttered grudgingly. “I want to watch a game.”
“I didn’t want to be late for our date.” Draco stands up, pulling his cloak tighter around him. It is still winter and even though the Entrance Hall is laced with a dozen Warming Charms, Harry knows it’ll be freezing once they step outside.
“What do you mean?” Draco asked without thinking.
He knew where Draco was. 'Iso ICU 6' meant 'intensive care unit, isolation wing, room 6', but no one could tell him what he needed to know. The Mediwitch who brought him his potions only said that Harry would be discharged on Day 14 of exposure. On the same day, Draco would be moved out of the isolation wing and to a general ward. Harry would be able to visit Draco there.
“Calm down, you beast. It’s been a long day for me.” Draco laughed for the first time since the Prophet story was published. “How was
Harry doesn’t mind escorting wheat across the galaxy if that’s what it takes to bring peace.
, for Salazar’s sake.
“I can’t imagine learning anything worthwhile from a beach game,” he retorted, amazed at the fire that burned in Harry’s green eyes in response.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “You mean those nights where you and your Gryffindor friends get drunk in a crowded pub and converse so loudly everyone can hear your unsolicited opinions? No thanks. I don’t go to pubs.”
Draco's hands fisted the edge of his jumper as he pulled himself out of the fantasy and met Harry’s gaze. “I suppose that’s wonderful for them. They look happy, after all,” he answered Harry's question, feeling disorientated. “They must have done a decent job as parents too. Look at how you turned out.”
Harry sent them puzzled looks before glancing at the wine glass in his hand. “I’m not being a very good birthday boy, aren’t I?” he said with a sigh. As he finished his drink, he spotted Ron raising an eyebrow at Luna, who simply shrugged.
Harry was listening with rapt attention. "Most Valuable Player, right?"
Malfoy raised an eyebrow at him and then shrugged. “It’s a pancake, Potter. It’s just fine,” he said blandly, continuing to eat. Then he lifted his head and regarded Harry suspiciously. “Did you make these? Is that why you’re so eager for my feedback?”
The Aurors apprehended Mrs Kelley’s assistant, who had swapped her regular dose of Anti-Aging Potion with the poison. None the wiser, Mrs Kelley had poured the poison into her own tea. Thanks to Draco’s brewing, the antidote was ready in less than twenty-four hours and she soon regained all her magic and former strength.
Potter fixed him with a solemn stare, his hair and clothes still dripping water. “This spending-two-weeks-alone-together thing. This situation sucks. Isn’t that why you’re angry at me today?”
"If I'm not an Unspeakable, what am I?" Draco demanded, the unspoken implication hung in the air.
Potter got the same slip too.
Harry and Malfoy were paired up after Ron and Malfoy’s old partner both got promoted. Ron was promoted to Deputy Head while Malfoy’s previous partner got offered to head a new branch in Northern Ireland. On the first day of their partnership, he had jokingly said, “We’re the ones being left behind, aren’t we?”, expecting a scathing reply.
Harry brought his hands to his face, just to make sure. A finger graced his forehead and — his breath hitched — touched the smooth skin over the spot where his lightning bolt scar should have been.
Harry didn't know the way, so he panicked a bit, quickly searching for his friends. He was relieved to see Hermione and Ron a short distance in front of them, both standing still and watching him curiously, having heard the commotion. Harry signalled them to “go on” before bending down to pick up his backpack, which had been lying abandoned on the floor. It was a miracle no one had stepped on it.
When he opened his eyes again, he reached out and cupped Harry's cheeks. Draco turned Harry's head from side to side, studying the latter's face. "You're pretty handsome without those ugly glasses."
He only raised his head when he heard a knock on the door. A Mediwitch opened the door but instead of entering the room, she stepped back to allow Harry to walk in. Once Harry was inside, the door closed behind him.
A pink flush blossoms on Draco’s cheeks. "What else?"
“Something edible, I hope,” said Malfoy, his curious gaze indicating that he hadn’t missed the way Harry evaded the question.
He wore joggers and long-sleeved jumpers in their room, and cotton pyjamas to sleep.
Harry had prepared him a warm bath, which Draco coaxed Harry to share with him. The water soothed his tired muscles as he leaned back against his boyfriend’s chest, sighing in contentment when Harry kissed his neck and fiddled with his golden hoop earring (a Christmas gift from Harry).
“The people at MAD sent this to my department last month,” Draco explained. “My senior colleagues knew right away that this sphere was previously used by Dark Wizards in the seventh century to extract a person’s soul from their body, basically leaving behind an empty shell.”
Ron tapped his chin with the end of his pen pensively. “He needs some practice playing in a team, and his defence is shit. His passes and shots are decent. He is shorter than me so that limits him a bit.” He stopped his tapping and glanced at Harry. “We will have a practice match with Rosenberg in November. Why don’t you drop by?”
As quickly as it appears, the smile vanishes from Harry’s sight when Malfoy turns away, pushes against Harry’s chest and stands up. Harry leans forwards in his seat, chasing his body heat, and almost falls clumsily to the floor but Malfoy catches his arm just in time and pulls him towards the bed.
“You’re getting tipsy, I’ll get you home,” said Ron, holding Harry’s elbow.
Potter gritted his teeth. "So what if I do?"
He had it all planned out in his head. He’d probably need a drink or two first, okay, but he is still a Gryffindor at heart and he is going to sweep Malfoy off his feet.
Malfoy reaches for the cigar, but Harry pulls it away and jerks his own head forward instead, smirking and earning himself an eye-roll for his cheeky tactic. After removing Harry’s glasses, Malfoy holds his face and practically slams their lips together.
If Auror Harry Potter had to describe his relationship with Unspeakable Draco Malfoy, seven years after the war, he would use the phrase "in limbo": neither here nor there. Frustratingly stuck somewhere between nothing and everything. Friends? Yes, but not really. Boyfriends? Maybe, but not quite. Perplexing? Absolutely.
mounts the top surface of
Harry is too stunned to speak.
In the second quarter, Draco held back on shooting and focused on bringing the ball to the other scorers — namely Greg, Blaise and Weasley —  as quickly as possible. The strategy worked because they soon narrowed the score gap.
“It’s actually good news for you,” he said, casting an
After a final review by Healer Kim, Draco was allowed to go home on a Friday evening. He and Harry stood outside St Mungo’s where it was drizzling. They had many things to do: work to catch up on, friends and families to update, letters to write and food to eat.
Harry, on the other hand, doesn’t trust himself to be touchy with Malfoy. Only Merlin knows what would happen if Harry puts his hands on Malfoy and — God forbid — Malfoy lets him. Harry’s mind goes down the gutter just thinking about it.
Suddenly his vision blurred and he found himself looking through a layer of translucent fabric. Potter had spread the Invisibility Cloak over them.
“You’ll see.”
And it was this understanding that compelled Harry to flirt shamelessly with him.
With a huff, Draco leaned back and resumed drinking his tea. He wondered, for the umpteenth time that day, whether he should address Potter's nightmares. It was a sensitive topic, one Draco knew all too well, having been haunted by them during the war and after.
Later that evening, after making sure Pansy had left, he Floo'ed to Grimmauld Place. The Wizarding Home recognized his blood and connection to its Master, and so allowed him in. This display of sentience and acceptance by the house always made him feel welcomed, more so than his own boring flat.
“Hey, I’m not saying I won’t help you,” Blaise clarified, raising both hands in surrender. “I can drop you off, but I promised my mom I’m visiting her tomorrow afternoon so you’ll have to find a ride home yourself.”
Harry reached inside his shirt and pulled out a silver medallion that fit nicely in his palm. At the centre of the medallion rested a small piece of jade stone, which now glowed red. Hermione had told him to wait until the stone turned green before attempting any more dimension-hopping.
In his mind's eye, Draco saw himself wrapped in Harry's embrace again, this time chest-to-chest, the smell of Harry's aftershave so strong he almost tasted it on his tongue. He yearned to climb into Harry's lap, to straddle his thighs and taste his lips. If Harry’s adopted dad and godfather could be together, couldn’t they, too?
“Do you have a cold?” Harry asks, going to sit next to Malfoy but discovering that he has to remove a pile of books and parchments (students’ essays) before he can do that. “Do you have Pepper-up?”
The scars at the back of his left hand were gone too.
Draco shook his head. “I have a basketball club meeting this evening.”
"And I hate acting this way in front of you,” Malfoy continues. “I bet you think I'm silly and pathetic because I say these embarrassing things to you but I can't help it because—" He slaps a hand over his own mouth, muffling the rest of the sentence.
“Jumps?” Harry repeats bemusedly. He is saved from making a fool of himself when the door opens and in walks Draco Malfoy, now with his face clear of any dirt.
Draco took a deep breath and waited for a short while before answering. "Good night. Go to sleep, Potter."
“No, there isn’t,” said Blaise, baffled. “There isn’t any basketball tournament in the city at the moment.”
"You hate hugging me?"
“Draco, darling,” Pansy purred. “What could you possibly be up to at the City Stadium?”
Unfortunately for Draco, Pansy was home when he stumbled through the door in tears.
It is just a simple brushing of lips. When they separate, they gaze into each other’s eyes for a moment before Harry brings up a hand to caress Draco’s cheek. In return, Draco cards his fingers through Harry’s black hair.
“Second Cockpit?” Harry repeats. It’s the first time he’s heard of such a term. Ships only have one cockpit. Only one captain.
“I suppose,” Draco replied, uncertain. “Maybe it’s pissed at me for taking it apart, and wants to make sure no one in the physical world can use it to rescue me.”
After returning the tray to the bar, Harry ducked into the kitchen, casting a Disillusionment Charm on himself as he walked towards the back door, removing his waiter apron and uniform along the way. By the time he exited out back and into a corridor, he was Harry Potter, but a specific kind of Harry Potter. This version was dressed like a gentleman, a sophisticated tuxedo and a black bowtie, complete with his signature round-rimmed spectacles, short stubble across his chin and jaw, hair slicked back to display his lightning bolt scar.
“Where are we going, Lieutenant?” Parvati asks as Padma continues counting down.
Draco’s heart skipped a beat. Potter was showing his protective side again, and it flattered Draco in a way he could not explain. "It's fine. He's gone. I'm with you now."
“You sneaky little thing,” Harry growled, playfully biting his earlobe, “telling your parents you love me without me around to hear it.”
“Did he tell you two I was coming?” Draco asked while they waited.
Gasps, interrupted breaths and soft moans fill the air as they continue kissing with little care for anything else.
They rarely talked about the war now. Draco had apologised to Potter and his friends many years ago, during their first year of Auror training. Shortly after, Potter had pulled him aside in private during one of their Auror training camps and apologised about the bathroom incident in sixth year. He had claimed it was the worst thing he had ever done.
there wasn’t one. There was a window in the living room that allowed them a glimpse of their surroundings. Harry only saw trees and the clear blue sky, no signs of other houses or people within sight. He turned the window latch, expecting it to be locked. But the window opened without trouble, letting the cool evening breeze in.
When he reached Draco, he eyed his white-blond hair briefly before reading out from the list, “Draco Malfoy?”
Harry recalls the cauldron in the classroom. He drops to the now clear space on the sofa. This close, he can feel Malfoy’s feverish body heat. “When will it be ready?”
"That's, uh, my first class too,” he stammered. Their height difference allowed Harry a direct view of his mouth, so now he couldn’t stop
Did Potter ever feel safe?
After they separated, Harry took a step back and held out a hand. “Let’s get started.”
There was an audible gasp from the audience when Weasley successfully caught the speedy ball with both hands. He smoothly tossed the ball into the hoop before any defender could stop him.
Harry grumbled. "Thanks for your input, Hermione, but I don't think that's useful in my situation now."
Hermione and Ginny had taken care of the invitations and arrangements, while Molly had prepared the menu; there wasn't much for Harry to do aside from showing up when the time came.
“Because I don’t drink.”
The letter was succinct, asking when Draco would be free for lunch. ‘
"I know you've been practising a lot. I believed you could do it."
“Yes, there is,” Greg chimed in, looking up from his cards. “But not basketball. It’s a volleyball tournament. Right, Daphne? Thomas told you about it in class.”
“Harry, where are you going?” Hermione gasped in horror when Harry slid off his seat and stealthily moved down the bleachers.
“Did you notice the way her veins were turning green?” Harry asked. “It looked like, well, like the veins of a leaf.”
Draco gritted his teeth, furious. He felt somebody grab his arm. Blaise gave him a loaded look, which Draco did
, connecting the two spaceships. The two metal wires become taut and shorten, until in the end,
And God knows Harry only got to see Malfoy at work. He had invited Malfoy to pub nights with his friends many times, but he always turned him down.
Harry was stunned into silence, clearly not expecting Draco to respond in such a manner, which made Draco blush even more deeply. For almost a minute, neither of them spoke. Draco took this time to calm his quickening heartbeats and level his breathing.
The incident at the apothecary had been a disaster. Harry had woken up at the Emergency Unit of St Mungo’s to the sound of Draco’s screams. His chest felt like it was being ripped apart when he found Draco with his face buried in a pillow while he cried in pain and begged Harry to switch off the lights. Pale hands had gripped his fingers tightly as a Healer wrapped bandages over Draco’s eyes.
“A broken vial? How am I supposed to do a reliable analysis when all they give me is a few drops and no ingredients?” Draco mumbled under his breath, “I may be good but I’m not a miracle worker.”
“We should leave immediately and—” The rest of Draco’s sentence got lost in a huge yawn.
“Are you sure it’s spattergroit?” Potter asked while Draco tried hard not to hyperventilate. “Isn’t one of the common symptoms facial pustules?”
Harry peered over his shoulder, at Neville’s closed door. When he turned back, his face was flushed pink. “I asked you simple questions. Like, is he good? What position does he play?”
Rasps escaped Draco’s throat as he struggled to respond.
“Okay, okay.” Harry bites his lower lip to stifle his laughter. He leans forward and returns his arms to where they have been wrapped around Malfoy’s waist moments before. Malfoy has since turned so now he sits sideways in front of Harry, his own long legs crossing over Harry’s left thigh. “What other names do you call me in your head?”
By some miracle, Harry recognised Draco’s address, so he didn’t need Draco guiding him at every turn. Draco was grateful because he doubted he could speak with the helmet around his head. He prayed that Harry couldn’t hear him whimper and yelp every time the motorcycle picked up speed or turned a sharp corner. Draco kept his arms tightly wound around Harry’s torso, not daring to move lest he’d fall.
Draco had been staring into Harry’s eyes, so he immediately noticed when Harry’s gaze dropped to his lips. Draco’s mouth suddenly went dry and he subconsciously sucked in a shaky breath.
He casts his own Warming Charm on Draco’s cloak, making the other wizard gasp when Harry’s magic sweeps over him.
Granger hurried to open the door. From his position, Draco was able to see two men walk into the house, both shrugging off their coats while Hermione yelled for Harry.
"You saved me, too." Harry obediently withdrew his hand but stayed close.
"You didn't."
The feel of Harry’s breath against his cheek was his only warning before Draco felt that first timid brush of Harry’s lips against his. His eyes instantly slid closed and he clutched the back of Harry’s neck as he pushed forward for more. Harry tilted his head and slotted their mouths together just right.
“Draco,” he says, a hand over his chest as he sends a tiny, sly smile to Harry. “Draco Malfoy.”
Paired with him for the Hogsmeade trip is Malfoy. Professor Malfoy.
. They were supposed to be
He discovered they were approaching their destination when Ron's red head disappeared into one of the rooms. “Here we are," Harry declared once they entered the lecture hall.
What did Ron say? Find the root cause?
They wordlessly surveyed the entire house. The living room was basic: a fireplace, a three-seater couch, a coffee table, and a small side table. There was a large Turkish rug covering the entire floor. If Harry had to describe the colour scheme of the furniture, it would be "boring beige". In the hallway, there was a writing desk, a matching chair, and an empty bookshelf. As they walked further, they found a kitchen with a pantry modestly equipped with groceries and ingredients. There was also a small dining table
“No.” Harry wandlessly sends the cigar to an ashtray and casts Stasis on it. “I picked this flavour.”
Draco only realised he had been staring when Harry disappeared into the crowd.
“Weasley,” he croaked, slightly out of breath. “During our first game, when you said I wasn’t as fast as
The briefing goes smoothly once the Captain gives full cooperation. Gone is the snide attitude. The Captain now regards Harry as an equal and an ally. Harry answers the Captain’s questions perfectly, with no stammer in his sentences.
Healer Kim nodded grimly. "I actually considered taking you to St Mungo’s to be monitored but we are short of resources at the moment. Our other patients are critically ill. I cannot justify using up two valuable isolation rooms for something that might not even happen. Remember, this is a new discovery. The fungus has a property that can cause these symptoms. There has been no real-world evidence it can happen to anyone who inhaled the spores."
It was rather unsettling how easily Weasley and Granger accepted him into their folds. Draco’s relationship with Weasley only existed in the basketball club and this was his first time interacting with Granger. What they were doing now — preparing for Harry’s adoptive dad and godfather’s visit — felt very domestic, a private event between family and close friends. He wondered what Harry had shared with them, and whether they had ever discussed Draco.
Weasley won the coin toss, and his team chose to be the offensive team first. When the match started, Draco was confident in his chances. He had played almost every day for the past few months and never missed a shot.
"About Sectumsempra. About you."
"Yes."
Draco almost added that most of his friends were in Arts School, too, but he was interrupted by Professor Scrimgeour, who declared that time was up and ordered the students to leave.
"Madam Shaw of the Wizengamot lost her husband this morning," he explained, letting Draco brush away tiny specks of dust on his attire. "The funeral is tomorrow but she is having a small gathering at her home tonight to… pray?"
and its crew, having known so much about Captain Malfoy already. However, he didn’t know that the older Captain had such a personable and intelligent son.
She tossed a pink star-shaped pillow into Harry’s lap. Harry took it into his hands right away but stilled when he turned towards Draco.
“Although, there is one thing you can help me with,” Draco said, holding up a finger before rubbing it gently against Harry’s bottom lip.
Harry lifted his head and pushed up his visor. Draco could see a tiny part of his face, but his eyes were hidden behind tinted lenses, so instead of green eyes, Draco could only see his own distorted reflection. Which actually helped with his anxiety and what he was going to say next.
“I was looking for ingredients to make our own lube,” Draco confessed, giggling. “It was supposed to be a surprise. That’s why I panicked.”
Draco remained where he was, horrified. “Not out
The kiss ended too soon. Draco opened his eyes, found himself staring into green eyes and realized that either of them could end this right here. They could pretend the kiss never happened. But who was he kidding? This was Harry Potter, and he was Draco Malfoy and they were always going to gravitate towards the other.
“Er, no?” Harry stammered and discreetly wiped his sweaty palms against his joggers. Malfoy was still holding his head. “Like a… purple pustule?”
Draco had long acknowledged that Harry was more brawny than him. He had sat next to him every week all semester, had lunch with him a couple of times and had the pleasure of hugging him from behind whenever Harry gave him a ride home. He already secretly considered Harry attractive in his long-sleeved shirts and loose jeans, often lying to himself that it was envy instead of desire. But he hadn't been prepared for this. It was impossible to ignore the effect Harry had on him now.
When it had gotten too late, they had to end the call; both had classes the following morning.
"Are you going to take his advice?" asked Theo, sounding uncharacteristically interested.
Draco carefully collected the remains of the potion and put it under a bubble charm. As far as he knew, the vapours from the potion could be deadly. He started casting diagnostic charms on the potion but it was hard to keep check of the potion’s swirling colours with Harry standing so close to him. He was standing still but his mere presence made Draco lose all his focus.
With a silly grin still plastered onto his face, Harry dropped into the seat between Ron and Hermione, instantly feeling two pairs of eyes curiously inspecting him.
They took turns casting spells to try to transfigure the bed into two single beds, but the bed seemed to repel any magic cast on it. Malfoy even tried to make the bed wider, but that didn't work either.
When Hermione said the game was going to start, Harry leaned back and paid close attention.
He shook his head. Stopping now would just be delaying the inevitable, and he wanted none of that. “I’m not telling you to stop, Harry.”
Potter yelled, petulant. “I am
“You can ask Healer Kim if you don’t believe me,” Malfoy said. “Anyway, I don’t like that. I don’t want to lose my memories. They make me who I am.”
It seemed like an eternity had passed before Draco felt a hand gently nudge his. "Can I call you Draco?" The request was anxious, shy and hopeful.
As Draco sat on the bench, wiping his face with a towel, Harry felt himself growing restless. He had a nagging feeling in his gut that had begun during the first quarter, after only several minutes of observing Draco’s movements. Now with Draco out of the game, Harry couldn't stop himself. He needed to talk to Draco immediately.
Draco nodded. "I hope if I get that in my first year, my father will stop belittling my hobbies and let me do what I want. I mean,” he continued and started gesturing at the university building, “I'm already taking this programme because he wants me to. I’m getting sick of him controlling all facets of my life."
The white peacock fan, open and large, shielded their heads from the rest of the room as they kissed.
Potter obeyed and slept soundlessly until morning.
“Yeah,” Weasley replied readily. “I was referring to Harry.”
Harry tipped his chin up and captured Draco’s lips again.
The following week, they met in the Healers’ waiting room again. Potter talked while Draco listened, basking in his attention and drinking in Potter’s bright green eyes and straight white teeth.
Draco's head emerged from beneath the blanket as he glanced at her and nodded.
“Forget I said that. Please forget I said that,” Malfoy begs, panicking as he looks at Harry. “Please stay.”
"What are you doing here, Potter?" Snape drawled.
“Yes.” The answer came easily. He hesitated to share more but decided to just go with it.
“Potter, listen,” he began, putting both hands inside his jacket pockets to protect them from the cold.
“We have visuals on one. Locked on target,” Ron reports over the comms. “Our radars detect more incoming ships, but they’re too far. Fire?”
“Draco?" He opened his eyes to see Harry right in front of him, concern evident in his green eyes. "What’s wrong?”
Harry didn’t acknowledge his thanks. Instead, he asked, “Is that… your girlfriend?”
The classroom itself is empty and quiet, save for a bubbling cauldron at the corner of the room. Harry makes his way to the back of the class, down a short corridor until he reaches an ornate mahogany door, which he knocks on firmly.
Now being given the chance to address their relationship, Harry didn't know where to start. So he started with the most recent development. "Did you know we're soulmates?"
“Hm, no?” Draco lied, smirking as he signalled for Harry to put the plate away. Harry didn’t need to see the glint in his grey eyes to tell Draco was feeling mischievous.
“Blimey, it worked!” Weasley cackled delightedly.
Draco returned with an armful of bottles and jars. “The brainchild of Master Potioneer Cornelius Yap, who gave them to his enemies, either killing them or turning them into Squibs. The only reason not many potioneers have succeeded in replicating his poison is that the list of ingredients includes—" he walked over to Harry and jabbed a finger on the open page, “saliva of a Komodo Dragon, boiled whiskers of Sumatran tigers and the faeces of bats in pitcher plants.”
Draco surveyed his opponents. The Rosenberg players were all winded. Smith, previously cocky, was now heaving under the exertion of keeping up with their accelerated gameplay. Their defence had considerably weakened. To do what Davies was asking now would be cruel, but after recalling Smith’s taunts, Draco nodded earnestly at his captain.
Potter’s forehead furrowed in confusion, so Draco lifted up his arm and showed Potter how the mark looked as Draco viewed it, with the origin point at his wrist at the top and the branching lines going down.
Harry looks at Draco, who has a smug grin on his handsome face.
If the room suddenly became too hot, well, Draco blamed the fire.
Harry looks at Malfoy's face in horror. "No! Hey, don't cry."
and still are
Inside the box was a hand-held fan, folded and harmless-looking. But anyone who had seen Draco in action could testify that the fan was a terrifying weapon, one designed by Draco himself, with the help of Blaise’s skills and resources in the Department of Mysteries.
Oh fuck. His
Draco twirled back around to face his cauldron. "Your ghastly Auror robes will scare my patrons away."
They emerged from the hospital two hours later, blinking hard against the glare of the sun.
But Harry could not have good things, apparently. Within a span of one day, he got them infected with a potentially dangerous fungus and trapped in a boring house in the middle of nowhere. It was all his fault.
"I didn’t want to tell you when you're sick," Harry explains. "It's not the right time, and the potion makes you do and say things you're embarrassed about. So I thought I'd wait until you get better and until the potion wears off."
When the referee blew his whistle to signal the end of the game, the applause and cheers in the gym were deafening. Harry didn’t bother checking the final scores; Hogwarts had won, and only that mattered.
“Really? Are you acting shy now?” Harry teases, reaching out to gently run his fingers through Draco’s sleek hair.
The fan whipped around like a boomerang and back into Draco’s hand. Draco cleaned his weapon with his wand, deactivating the poison and blunting its paper edges, and then proceeded to languidly fan himself as he sauntered towards Harry.
He was in a room similar to the one he had woken up in two weeks prior, only this time Harry was not sitting on the other bed. Despite the ache in his bones when he moved, Draco sat up, folded his legs and rested his forehead against them, taking deep breaths.
Later, Davies deftly stole the ball from Marcus Flint and bounced it to Draco.
But they don't care anymore.
“It’s okay. I wasn’t asleep. Just resting,” Harry explained mildly. “Last week you called on a Monday. Today is Tuesday, so…”
Draco was reluctant to ask what he meant, so he asked something else. "Did you see a Mind Healer?"
This thought made Harry's ears grow warm. "Stop it, Harry. He was joking," he scolded himself. "Just. Joking."
Draco wouldn’t have thought of his plan if Harry hadn’t spoken to him. He suspected Harry possessed a keen strategic sense that he was downplaying. “What did you think of the match?”
It was a chocolate cake, plainly decorated with pink and white frosting.
“They’re with the coach and team for a de-briefing. I asked to be excused early since my dad and godfather are coming. So, Draco,” he began with a sly smile, gently pulling Draco’s hand and backing towards the kitchen, “do you know how to grill lamb on the stove?”
“Safe? It has no seatbelts! No airbags! Nothing!”
Prequel for 'Sacrifice'. Draco watches Harry's training session while he waits for his fan to get repaired before heading out for their cruise/mission.
. “Let, er, let's go together?"
They laid back against the pillows. Harry stayed still as Draco’s hands felt around his face. Nimble fingers touched his scar, tenderly removed his glasses before softly skimming over his eyebrows and eyelashes, and rubbed against his lips.
he demanded, wiping his face with his sleeve, which did not help much since his T-shirt was soaked too. Draco then realised that Potter was only wearing a thin white T-shirt, which was now practically transparent and clinging to his body, and a pair of black pants.
“You didn't come to the Hogsmeade trip today. I got to know you’re sick, so…”
When he stormed out the front door, Potter didn't stop him.
There was always something missing, wasn’t there? With Malfoy. As though Harry desperately wanted something - for him, from him,
Due to his sheltered upbringing, Draco was socially awkward. He acted confident and cocky in front of others, but alone with Harry, he was anxious, shy and spoke a mile a minute whenever he was excited.
“Well, apparently we did!” Malfoy exclaimed. “Back then, there was a virulent strain of the spattergroit that caused confusion and memory loss. It infected the entire stadium during Great Britain’s first match with Greece. Everyone there had no recollection of what had transpired. The global secretariat disqualified Britain on public health grounds. To save face, the Ministry doctored the history books a bit.”
“What? Us? Going on a holiday?” Draco chuckled. “Together?”
Draco looked up at him thoughtfully. “Are you sure this is what you want?”
“I’m not obsessed,” said Harry weakly, but even he knew that wasn’t the truth. Ever since he got promoted, Ron had been giving out these mature, crazily insightful pieces of advice that always drove Harry insane.
Malfoy returned to his spot on the couch with the bag of potions. He took out one of the pink potions, placed a cushion on his lap and patted it. When Harry just looked at him, perplexed, he rolled his eyes. “Lie down. I’ll drop the potion on your pustule. Don’t expect me to believe you can do it yourself, Potter. You almost touched it with your bare hands.”
Draco turned his head so fast, Harry had to yank his hand back to avoid getting smacked by the folding fan that Draco had brought up to cover the lower half of his face. His eyes were still shielded by those sunglasses, so Harry only saw his own reflection. Draco could be blushing or smiling or glaring daggers at him, Harry didn’t know.
“You know Snape?”
“No, I stayed at Grimmauld Place. The wards there are strong,” Draco explained. “Are you alright?”
“None of your business, Pans,” Draco said wearily. “I don’t care what you order. Shoo!”
"Dentists? Muggle Healers specializing in dental pathology?" Draco remembered reading that somewhere.
Draco propped himself up and gazed down at Harry, taken aback.
Harry’s mind had been filled with Malfoy all day; Malfoy offering to help with his nightmares; Malfoy giving him milk before bed; Malfoy applying medicine on him; Malfoy smiling at him; Malfoy joining him in bed at night; Malfoy being attractive and everything Harry wanted without even trying.
When Draco first opened his eyes to darkness, he did not know what had roused him. A quick
“It could have killed you!” Harry protested.
Harry happily complied. The only thing he didn’t remove was the bandage around Draco’s eyes. Although Harry’s lies were fun during foreplay, Harry refrained from talking when they finally got down to business. He only allowed himself incoherent grunts and one-word curses as he moved above Draco’s body.
When Snape told the first years to make groups of three, Draco immediately grabbed Greg and Blaise. Theo ended up with Weasley and a boy with dirty blond hair named Anthony Goldstein.
Pansy clapped her hands. “Well, glad
"If there's anything I can help with, let me know." Draco stopped himself from saying anything more, lest he made a fool out of himself.
“How did they…” Draco trailed off, watching closely for Harry’s reaction.
Harry had seen the sphere before, minus the cracks. He was the one who found the sphere a few months ago during a raid. The sphere was unimportant to the case at hand, but Harry had a suspicious feeling about it, and after blasting it with every curse-detection spell he knew, he wanted to destroy it. But Robards stopped him and sent it to the Mysterious Artifacts Division, more colloquially known as MAD.
"How are you today, Draco?" the Healer asked gently.
With a grunt, Malfoy came to stand next to Harry, carrying a briefcase. Malfoy was dressed in a plain white shirt and crisp black trousers. His short platinum-blonde hair was swept to the side, fair strands falling into his face and curling at his nape. His eyelashes were as pale as his skin. His grey eyes were eyeing the Portkey suspiciously, his lips pressed into a frown.
Draco grabbed Harry's hands. “I never want to hear about potted plants again in my entire life,” he declared out of the blue, before whispering, “Don’t just
In August, Draco was sitting under a tree in the university’s park, trying to study, when a shadow fell upon him. His throat clamped up at the sight of Potter’s grinning face.
They had never kissed in public, not even in Muggle London. But today they did and they didn’t care.
“It’s good to see you here,” Potter said. “What are the odds of the two of us having a session at the same time? Maybe they arranged the timetable in alphabetical order."
Draco shrugged flippantly and rested his elbows on the now-empty table, purposely avoiding looking at Harry.
Draco slams into Harry’s side, snickering when Harry reels unstably and almost falls into the snow. They race to the gates, where they link their arms and Apparate together to Hogsmeade.
The following Friday evening, after the last student has filed out, Harry hastily casts cleaning spells around the classroom, sending chairs tucked into desks and loose pieces of parchment flying into a dustbin. He then hurries to his quarters to freshen up and change.
While they waited for the professor, Harry tried — and failed — to forget the way the blond's skinny jeans wrapped around his slender legs.
is a science spaceship, equipped to the teeth with advanced technology and scientists but as useless and vulnerable as aluminium foil if under attack. Hence why Harry’s
“Our mission, you mean,” Draco corrected him as they got ready to return to their office for some last minute preparations. “We’re not going on a holiday.”
is for you to feel safe around me, too."
Harry grew up in a modest suburban town, son of a pair of government employees and the elder brother of two bright ginger-haired girls. He grew up playing football in the streets with friends, surrounded by love. He inherited his dad’s mischievous ingenuity and his mom’s creativity. He chose to study Electrical Engineering because he dreamed of helping people all around the world.
When Harry returns to The Second Cockpit with Draco this time around, the navigation and communication stations are manned by Draco’s officers, who turn out to be the same people who were in the laboratory, the ones Harry had mistaken for scientists.
When Weasley zipped forward to block, Draco spat, “I won’t lose.”
Harry forgot to breathe for a moment. He gathered his courage and leaned down to bring himself closer to Draco. “When this quarantine is over, would you go out with me?”
’ Captain, Lucius Malfoy, is far from a scientist. He is a veteran warrior, who stands as stiff as a pole and as unkindly as an affronted serpent. Even over the virtual comms, he has his chin lifted as he sneers at Harry with contempt.
Harry feels annoyed when an officer comes to announce that the Captain is ready to see him now. Zabini, who has remained silent throughout Draco’s entire spiel, stalks out without bothering to check whether Harry’s following him. Harry signals for Seamus and Dean to head out first before turning his full attention to Draco.
came to accept Draco after they got over the initial shock. Andromeda seemed pleased to see her nephew get on so well with Harry while Teddy was just thrilled to have another relative who spoiled him with gifts.  Draco was most nervous about telling his parents, so they held that off for as long as they could.
Draco lowered his legs and quickly found himself in Harry's arms again. His body relaxed in Harry's embrace as he was rocked slowly.
Captain Malfoy’s face appears on the screen, face lit with red light. “We are being attacked by Krurian vessels,” he says urgently. “Are we ready to jump?”
After receiving an undeserved scolding from Snape, Harry scurried up the bleachers, back to where he sat beside a bushy-haired girl.
"I wasn't paying attention. The rules are too complicated,” Draco complained. He tried to avoid looking directly into Harry’s eyes with limited success. “Basketball is much simpler.”
“Malfoy, how are you?” Potter smiled.
Hermione, an Unspeakable herself, had a theory that the problem lied in their inability to communicate effectively. Harry was notoriously bad with words while Draco became quiet and subdued after the trials and induction into the Department of Mysteries.
“Welcome, Mr Potter!” she exclaimed as though just noticing his presence. “I apologise for my rudeness. Please make yourself at home.”
“Don’t you think I’m going to spoil the mood?” Harry asked, pulling Draco closer.
“Tell me, Potter,” Draco drawled, throat raw. “Why are you talking to giant, humanoid slugs?”
Surprisingly, Harry looked impressed when he accepted the handshake, his grip sure and gentle. “Draco, as in the constellation?”
Getting on the motorcycle turned out to be easier than it looked. Once he got on behind Harry, however, he didn’t know where to put his hands. He waited as Harry pulled on a pair of leather gloves and fastened his own helmet.
“Then I’m your friend, too,” the man says cheerfully, holding out a pale hand at Teddy. “My name is Draco. It means dragon.”
Captain Potter of
“May I see?”
Much to Harry’s chagrin, he and Malfoy are still in bed, their fronts pressed together as though stuck by glue. Harry is glad that Madam Pomfrey can’t see beneath the covers, where Malfoy’s thigh has slipped in between Harry’s and is dangerously close to his groin. He is still baffled about how he got into this situation or why Malfoy is acting like this. He swallows and hesitantly asks Madam Pomfrey, “So… is he going to be okay?”
“I like you, Potter,” said Draco firmly, hands trembling in his pockets. “I mean, not in a platonic way. I mean in a romantic way. I think you’re kind, humble and really nice to people, especially to me. You’re also pretty handsome and have… well-defined lower limbs.”
That night, an owl swooped in through his open bedroom window, dropped an envelope onto his desk and promptly flew out before Draco could even react.
Until then, Draco could try little things.
while the other half desperately wanted to
“Just ask him out already,” a familiar voice suddenly spoke into his ear.
“Malfoy,” he said, holding out a hand. “Draco Malfoy.”
“You’re… satisfactory,” Draco murmured, trying to be teasing as well but instead just ended up sounding wheezy. Had Harry’s eyes always been this beautiful up close?
"When you imagine yourself attending his birthday party, do you feel afraid?"
Harry’s expression turned sombre. “My parents died when I was a baby. I grew up with my adoptive dad and my godfather.”
s is mine.”
They spent their day in the bedroom. Harry discovered things about Draco he never knew before. His lips were soft and warm. His hair was as soft as Harry had imagined when he carded his fingers through it. His pale skin flushed pink at certain moments and the sight never failed to drive Harry insane with want.
When it was time for bed, Draco waited for Potter to exit the bathroom and pointed to a glass of cold milk on his bedside table.
Harry glanced at their schedules side by side. “Sorry, Tuesday is volleyball day.”
“Tried that. Turns out I’m allergic to them. My eyes were red for a week.” Harry flinched at the unpleasant memory. “Anyway, do you always play basketball alone?”
This makes more sense.
Uncle Harry sighs again, but this time in relief. “That’s great, Teddy! Er, wait here. I’ll go get him.” He leaves Teddy’s room for a short moment. When he comes back, he is followed closely by a slender man with a strikingly fair complexion, sharp features and sleek blond hair, dressed entirely in dark colours.
If Harry had to describe his relationship with Draco Malfoy, five years after they exited the realm of limbo, he would fiddle with the silver wedding band on his left ring finger and grin happily, no words necessary.
Draco appeared to be taken aback to see Harry. He took a step back and would have fallen down the short flight of steps if Harry hadn’t grabbed his arm and hauled him inside.
Malfoy scoffs and, after a moment of contemplation, walks over to Harry. When he climbs onto Harry’s lap, removing his bathrobe as he does, Harry’s heart skips a beat or two. Malfoy is beautiful like this: all long legs, acres of pale skin, silky platinum-blond hair and thin pink lips.
At four years old, he is wary of unfamiliar faces. He is only comfortable with Grandma and Uncle Harry, because he spends the most time with the two of them. Without either of them, he doesn’t feel safe. He cries loudly whenever he finds himself around people other than his grandmother and his godfather, much to the chagrin of Uncle Harry’s friends. Initially, everyone attributed Teddy’s reactions to ‘stranger anxiety’, and accepted it. But lately, Uncle Harry has begun looking more troubled whenever Teddy acts up around his friends.
When he reached a meter from Harry, something white and fast darted across his neck, sending his eyes rolling to the back of his head while his body convulsed and dropped to the floor.
When it was time for Draco to visit the Healers, he went without putting up a fuss.
The gym was enormous, with a high ceiling and tall tiered rows of spectator benches along the sides. In front of them were long benches for the players. The court’s floor, adorned with a large Hogwarts logo in the middle, reflected the harsh lights from above. When the students crossed the gym to reach the coach, their shoes made squeaking noises.
Potter might not see, but Draco nodded. "Yes, a bit. Better than nothing."
Two days later, the photograph of them kissing was featured on the Daily Prophet and it was a nightmare.
“You disappoint me, Ron Weasley,” Harry hissed back. They were both sitting at the dining table, pens and open books between them. While Ron had been peeved at how they were given homework on the first
“I feel fine,” Draco replies, a little surprised. His eyes dart momentarily toward Harry but then return to Madam Pomfrey.
Feeling sheepish, Harry walks to the doors. Before he steps out, he turns around. “When can I see you again?”
On the way home, Harry passed a large park that had a playground and multiple courts. He had never paid any attention to it before, but when he stopped at a red light on the road just next to a basketball court, he couldn’t help but look over at the lone tall figure throwing a basketball at the hoop. Harry pushed up his visor to get a better look.
Holding the ball low, he leaped backwards and landed behind the three-point line. Weasley’s eyes widened in realisation as Draco swung the ball up and threw it towards the hoop.
After making sure no one was looking at them, Harry gently placed their joined hands on his right knee, keeping them clasped between them. He rubbed his thumb soothingly over Draco’s bony knuckles and fingers.
“Harry trained for years to build up his speed and stamina,” Granger remarked, sounding like a proud mother. “I think the game is going to end soon, Ron.”
On the first day of the semester, Harry Potter had to be dragged out of bed by an irritated Ron Weasley. Being the last person to use the second floor bathroom, Harry bathed in cold water, teeth chattering as he quickly rubbed his body with soap. As he got dressed in his room, hair still dripping water onto his grey T-shirt and jeans, angry honks sounded from the street below his window.
There was a small gasp coming from Remus, and Sirius frowned, causing creases to appear on his forehead. “Are you related to Lucius Malfoy?”
“You didn’t have to do that,” Draco says softly as they exit the building, snow crunching beneath their boots.
When he was in high school, he wore his normal spectacles for all occasions, even during sports activities. It was only after receiving a volleyball to the face and breaking his only pair of glasses that Remus had advised him on having proper eyewear for certain purposes. Now Harry owned at least three pairs of spectacles: for his usual day-to-day use, for motorcycle rides and for volleyball.
“My father is the one with a chauffeur, not me,” Draco clarified, brushing off dead leaves from his jeans. “And I don’t see the point of owning a car when I can’t drive.”
When they entered the gym, spectators were already taking their seats on the bleachers. Harry and Hermione selected a spot several levels behind the Hogwarts players’ bench, high enough to see the game. While they waited for the players, Hermione brought Harry up to speed with the rules.
As Harry glared at his soggy French toasts, he felt Draco's arms wind around his waist from behind. A sharp chin rested on his shoulder. "Are we going to eat that?"
“This is… interesting. I can’t see you, but I can still feel you, even more so than usual.” Draco’s breaths were hot and short. “You know, we can make the best out of this situation.”
Draco tossed the letter inside a drawer and went to bed, trying his best to forget.
The Auror’s report contained a lot of praise concerning one independent Potioneer — although Ron had crossed out the parts where Harry waxed poetic about Draco’s seastorm eyes.
“You should stop staring at me.” Draco warned, and Harry could practically hear the unspoken “
Draco Malfoy was forced to return to Hogwarts as part of his sentencing. He joined the other Eighth Years, though he kept mostly to himself. Draco rarely sat in the Eighth Year Common Room because it was often taken up by Gryffindors, who made up a majority of their year.
Draco groaned, feeling harassed by the torrent of questions. He regretted not getting a driver’s license and his own car before starting university; he could have avoided all this. “Forget it,” he snapped. “I’ll just take the bus.”
Harry’s eyes sprang open. The first thing he saw, looming directly in front of his face, was Malfoy. Older, but with the same grey eyes, same platinum hair, and alive.
Harry's hand reached up and touched Draco's silky hair. "How was it?"
He hoisted Draco onto his back and carried him to the living room. Yelling "St Mungo’s!", he threw Floo powder into the fireplace and promptly crawled through the green flames.
Malfoy freezes. He lifts his chin and gapes at Harry, who sighs. So much for not confessing.
As always, the Potions Professor is clad in Slytherin colours, his robes dark green with silver piping and a thick black cloak clasped around his shoulders. A group of Ravenclaw students on their way to the Great Hall briefly bow at him when they pass, wishing him an amiable, “Good evening, Professor Malfoy!” Draco nods back at them, smiling as they scurry along.
“Do you have a way to get us back?” Draco enquired instead.
Harry returns with his own stare. “Your captain claims to be carrying the most precious cargo in the galaxy. The Federation has failed to inform me what.”
He hadn’t noticed that while he spoke, Potter had gently guided him inside and sat them both on the steps. Potter was silent as tears streaked down Draco’s face.
Their last interaction was two years prior, a few months after the War trials. Draco had met Harry and his friends at a Ministry event and apologised to them as best as he could.
Draco stayed awake until he felt the bed dip with Potter's weight. Draco remained on his side, facing away.
Draco’s face grew warm; he discreetly fanned himself.
"What about Weasley? Granger?"
Healer Kim raised an eyebrow. “We don’t usually let non-family members room in with patients, but I don’t mind. If anybody questions it, I’ll just say your name.”
The downside of being the one leading the way was Harry could no longer sneak glances at the blond, who followed silently behind him.
It was clearly a rhetorical question, so Harry asked, "Why can't I be nice to you?"
On Wednesday, Harry sold his soul to a devil by the name of Luna Lovegood.
While they wait, Seamus and Dean trade theories on what the cargo could possibly be. Is it a biological or a chemical weapon? Can it destroy suns and stars? Or, if one is well-read on Captain Malfoy’s past missions, is the weapon something sneaky such as war prisoners or material for blackmail?
A few minutes passed where no one spoke. The wind outside grew more violent, transforming into a full-on blizzard.
Draco looked over his shoulder briskly. He appeared taken aback to see Harry, but he quickly recovered and whispered to the brown-haired player beside him, "Theo, cover me." Then he swung both his legs over the bench as he spun around until his body faced away from the court, facing Harry.
He rarely called or texted his family.
Anger burned in the pit of Harry’s stomach, yearning to burst. Didn’t Draco have any idea how worried he made Harry?
“Ouch, that hurt my feelings,” Harry remarked, grinning. He drew himself closer and asked in a low voice, “What were you expecting?”
Harry stopped walking, confused. “I say that all the time.”
Potter’s soulmark was Draco the constellation.
“You’ve just experienced your first ever space jump, powered by Faith Apparatus,” Draco says happily. “I call it Apparition.”
Ron spotted Harry and Hermione and happily waved at them. Hermione waved back, a proud grin on her face.
At the party, Harry plastered on a smile and greeted everyone. Hermione had invited all Gryffindors in their year plus several Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaw they knew. He recognised people from other years as well, probably friends of Ginny and Luna.
“What am I supposed to do for an hour?” Harry snaps, patience wearing thin.
"He is happy to see me," he whispered.
"We’re under quarantine, not on a holiday," Malfoy reminded, closing the briefcase. "Don't worry, Potter. I'll handle this."
inside. They found a utility room that had two large bags they were supposed to put their dirty laundry in. Lastly, they walked into the bedroom.
Draco’s mind was in shambles, so it was a miracle he managed to reply, as calmly as he could, “I expect you to.”
Before they exited the waiting room, Potter suggested they grab some snacks from the kitchens. Draco grudgingly agreed; he was feeling bleak and could use some sweets to lift his mood.
"I'm not angry at you anymore," Draco said, which was a half-lie. He might feel better in the morning but right now he desperately wanted to go back to sleep. "Come on, let's sleep in the bedroom. At least if you have a nightmare again, I don't have to get out of bed to kick you awake."
“Not worried about her telling your dad?”
“Well, that makes sense,” Potter remarked, putting his teacup on the coffee table.
“Yes,” Harry replied before his voice became hesitant. “I mean, only if you can? I know phone bills aren’t cheap.”
Recognizing the shadow in the doorway, he sighed and cast a stasis charm over the cauldron.
“Now,” Captain Malfoy begins, facing Harry completely, “tell me about your crew, your ship and how you plan on protecting my ship.”
But his desire to scold vanished when Draco asked, “Why did the Department of Mysteries send you, an Auror? Why not another Unspeakable?”
Draco felt a tentative hand rest on his lower back, the simple touch sending a nice tingle up his spine. “You like how I turned out?” Harry’s words were teasing but his voice quivered just slightly.
“I’m fine.” Malfoy struggles to speak normally with a blocked nose. “You didn’t have to come here.” He tries to close the door but Harry pushes it back.
“Give me a minute!” Came the muffled reply, as though Draco was yelling from inside a water tank.
Potter pouted. "Malfoy, I'm serious."
liked it when Draco referred to him as his boyfriend. He liked that he was
Everything about Draco was expensive. Harry felt like a criminal just for touching him.
Then he envisioned himself snug in Harry's arms, his back against Harry’s wide chest, Harry's nose nuzzling his neck, and his own pale hands stroking Harry's chiselled, tanned forearms.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Malfoy said before biting into another scone. “They purposely forgo doors, and yet still leave windows? I bet there’s a spell on them that kills anyone that goes through.”
Healer Kim laid a hand on his shoulder. "We will do our best, Auror Potter. We'll take care of him. In the meantime, you will need to finish your quarantine period in our isolation ward. Iso 22," she said that last bit at a Mediwizard, who nodded.
Draco tilted his head, giggling as Harry pressed his mouth against the side of his neck. “Hush, Harry. I have my loyalties. Snape will kill you if you make me jump ship.”
But he can’t help wondering whether Lieutenant Commander Draco Malfoy has ever looked at a man with the same ardour as he does when he talks about pink wheat.
“You’ve met my son,” he says in lieu of a greeting. He nods at Harry, a gesture Harry didn’t expect to come from the war-worn veteran. “He tells me to be kind to you.”
Harry leaped to his feet and pointed his wand at the sphere.
Draco’s eyes flash indignantly, but Harry caresses his cheek and hastily explains, “I know what you want and
Draco laughed as Harry climbed on top of him and showered him with kisses and affection.
Together, they touched the Portkey and were transported into a living room. The first thing Harry did was look for a front door
, but he told himself that it was just his imagination.
There is a confusing tangle of limbs and indignant grunts. Harry ends up helplessly supine with Malfoy sprawled against his chest. Harry stops breathing and freezes, his hands suspended in mid-air.
He hid in the university’s library to read it. Potter apologised, claiming that he didn’t blame Draco for ignoring him since they weren’t friends. But instead of leaving Draco alone, Potter went the opposite route.
Malfoy doesn't respond to that. Harry is about to fall asleep drinking in the scent of Malfoy's hair when finally he hears:
Draco slowly slid his arms around Harry’s chest, the action bringing him close enough to brush his lips against Harry’s ear and he whispered, “Teach me how to be as fast as you, jump as high as you and last as long as you.”
"What makes you afraid?"
Draco didn’t want to think about the outside world. It was too scary.
Draco’s face burned as he quickly confirmed that Potter was out of hearing range.
“Nonsense!” Narcissa cried, opening the doors to Draco’s bedroom and spelling all the lights on. “We’ve been expecting this ever since you first declared your love for The Chosen One back in Halloween.”
“My parents,” Harry explained, taking the spot next to Draco. “I don’t remember them but they were best friends with Remus and Sirius, so I learned everything about my parents from them.”
Spending his entire summer playing basketball alone meant Draco never had any formal training in passing, but he considered it similar to shooting. He already honed his accuracy so well that he could get the ball wherever he wanted, as long as nothing got in the way. But passing meant somebody had to catch the ball he threw, and for now, the only one he could trust was Blaise.
They agreed to stay home until the potions wore off. Harry didn’t want to talk to anyone, so while he cooked in the kitchen, Draco made several necessary Floo-calls to their friends and families, updating them about their situation.
But as more days went by, Harry grew dissatisfied with the second-hand stories. He wanted to see Draco play, but his work schedule never permitted it. Ron had convinced him to wait for the actual game against Rosenberg, so Harry had the date circled on his calendar and made Luna promise to keep his name off the roster for that day.
Since it was too cold to wait for Harry outside, Granger suggested they all sit in Weasley’s car while Harry showered and changed. Draco had deduced that Weasley and Granger were dating, judging from their body language, and so didn’t dare object when she sat in the passenger’s seat beside Weasley, leaving Draco to take the back seat.
"Draco darling," she said, rudely waving the Daily Prophet in front of his face while he ate. "You need to find something to do. Like a job. Otherwise you'd just waste away your days, pining for Potter."
This confused Blaise even more. “Why are you going to a
Draco crossed his legs and clasped his hands on his knee. The game had just started, and it was going to be a long one.
Healer Kim was relieved to see them. "I'm glad you two are doing so well. I was afraid about the possible symptoms I talked about yesterday. Maybe I have been too worried."
Every student was required to meet either one of the Healers at least once. The first session was marked on each student’s schedule; skipping the session would cost house points and incur detentions.
“Believe it or not, Potter, those of us who use our brains actually spend some time pondering on our observations, rather than rushing to the wrong conclusions.”
Harry was short of breath, though now it was less due to the exercise and more because of this gorgeous being in front of him. “What is it?”
With an annoyed snort, Malfoy backs away from the door and allows Harry entry.
This could take months, years or decades, but it didn’t matter.
Harry stepped back and Draco busied himself with searching for his books of ingredients. When the Auror took a seat on a stool, Draco spun back to him.
“You didn’t even look at me during dinner,” Potter said, looking dejected. “I’m really sorry for getting us into this mess.”
Draco glanced at the empty seats around him. He wasn’t sure if the other students were averse to sitting so close to Professor Scrimgeour or simply avoided sitting near
“Please come in,” she said, gently patting Harry’s arm. “My husband is already seated in the dining room.”
“Were you planning on telling me at some point?” Harry asked softly.
Potter tilted his head pensively. “You’d feel left out.”
At eighteen, his beauty was pristine, as though manufactured. His blond hair was slicked back and glistened like platinum. His clothes were obviously tailor-made for him, though not by his choice. His shirt and trousers accentuated his slim waist and long, slender legs, but he appeared too young in them, like a child wearing a grown-up's costume.
And he wanted Draco so
He hastily patted his chest, stomach, arms, and thighs. Aside from his eyesight and scars, his physique was unchanged. He still wore the same uniform he had on at St Mungo’s before he blacked out.
“Draco?”
Draco found the question odd, so he had to seek clarification. “About them being your parents?”
The images sharpened and he forced himself to identify the faces. "It's the students from our year. The Gryffindors. Potter's roommates."
“Not every night!” Harry corrected. “Just… whenever I’m exhausted or stressed, they come more easily. Even so, I don’t… people can’t always tell when I’m … I mean, I don’t wake up screaming anymore. But it still happens sometimes so I prefer to sleep alone.”
in love with him!” Draco denied helplessly, which earned a laugh from Blaise. Sighing, he slowly fanned himself as he continued observing Harry. “I can’t. Aurors aren’t allowed to have romantic relationships with their partners.”
Potter had the
“This doesn’t smell like smoke,” Harry assures, patting his thigh. “Come here.”
"Good night, Malfoy," Potter murmured.
“Sort of. He used to hate my father and despises my godfather, so he hates me too,” he remarked flippantly. “Good thing I’m not on his team.”
At some point while Draco spoke, Potter had rotated his body onto the side, so they were facing each other. The faint moonlight from the windows highlighted Potter's features, his square jaw and broad shoulders. "I'm afraid I do, Malfoy."
They agreed to meet at the library on Thursday afternoon. Harry gave his house’s landline number, along with tidbits about his housemates, which confused Draco because he never asked for this information.
Draco sighed in relief. "Please."
“And has it ever occurred to you,” Harry counters, just as icily, “that without my protection, should enemies attack your ship to get to this cargo, your defenceless ship will be flattened like a pancake sooner than it takes for you to blink?”
Harry snorts. "I don't tell people they're hot just to be nice!"
"Please, stay," Potter whispered earnestly. "Let me replace that bad memory with good ones."
“If it appears again, remember not to touch it,” reminded Malfoy, putting away the potion. “It spreads easier and quicker that way. As soon as you notice one, we must apply the potion right away.”
After their visitors left, Healer Kim gave them a long explanation on what to do during isolation. They needed to monitor each other’s symptoms, make sure they drank their potions every day, put their clothes into special bags to be sanitised and much more. Draco tried to listen, but he found it hard to focus with anger boiling in his chest. Stupid Potter for brandishing his stupid powers with stupid, reckless abandon. Stupid Potter for getting them into this stupid situation. Now he had to stupidly spend two fucking weeks with stupid Potter all stupid day.
“No, they're on another floor.”
“Ten seconds!” Padma cries out. “Eight. Seven.”
One of the many lessons Lucius had taught Draco since a young age was the importance of making a good first impression on the people who mattered.
Harry raises an eyebrow. “Yes?”
He stays like this even through lunch, not bothering to move when a Hogwarts elf appears and presents them with a tray of food. He doesn't want to let Draco go, as if he is the one with the need for Draco’s body heat instead of the other way around.
in his drawl.
Harry usually sleeps in during the weekend, so when he wakes up that Sunday, he is confused why the sun isn't beaming on his face. It takes him a minute to recall that he has slept in Malfoy's quarters in the dungeons. Speaking of Malfoy…
“I don’t suspect you of anything,” Harry replied, puzzled. “Why would I think that?”
Harry followed him and placed the cake on the kitchen counter. “Draco, I
Their session with Healer Kim today was different from before. Ever the cheerful lady, she was uncharacteristically solemn when her bubbled-head emerged from the flames.
Harry guffaws, dropping back against the large and plush cushions of Malfoy’s sofa. They have just finished having a late breakfast together, and would have fallen into awkward silence if it wasn't for Malfoy’s potion-induced chattiness forcing them to engage in conversations. “That doesn’t make any sense.”
"He is quite pretty, isn't he?" Hermione remarked innocently.
Draco blinked, his expression morphing from frustrated to intrigued. "How?"
Draco summoned back his pillow, pulled his blanket over his head, and ignored Potter until Healer Kim returned with their bags, supplies and Portkey.
Draco leant above the bubbling potion, frowning at the pink colour. It had been five hours and five minutes since he added the Moondew, and it was supposed to have turned a deep red by now… A sudden bang, followed by the shrill sound of the jangling of the doorbell, made him look up in alarm.
Draco gazed forlornly at the device resting against Harry's chest. "Well, it's not typical to find oneself in a limbo world and needing to be rescued, is it?”
appreciate. He swatted Blaise’s hand away and grumbled, “Make sure you catch my passes.”
Harry swallowed.
He spent a lot of time catching up with Hagrid and Headmistress McGonagall, until they excused themselves, the Headmistress saying she was getting too old for late-night partying.
Harry hissed but otherwise remained still when Malfoy applied several drops of potion onto the pustule. The potion stung, and there was a faint smell of burning flesh, but it was gone within seconds.
“The other Aurors will arrive in approximately two minutes,” Draco muttered, leaning forwards expectantly. “Now, what did you say about me being beautiful?”
Draco rolled his eyes, mumbling, “My boyfriend is a volleyhead. Only
When he steps into Teddy’s room, Teddy immediately stands up and hides behind Uncle Harry’s legs.
“You’re a Potions Master!” Madam Pomfrey exclaims. “You’re expected to be wary when taking medicinal potions for the first time.”
“The original name is Engineering,” Zabini explains as he ushers them into an elevator and presses Down, “but the department has grown so much that one section has been upgraded to a more sophisticated lab. And a second cockpit.”
“I’m not here by
Later, Healer Kim came to examine Draco, who almost didn’t recognise her without her Bubble Charm. She appeared surprised to find Harry. “Auror Potter, I was under the impression I approved your discharge this morning. Why are you still here? Aren’t you eager to go home after so long?”
“If you want to continue this hobby of yours, then be good at it,” he had warned during their journey to Snape’s house, many months ago. “Be the
Draco always paid when they ate or shopped together. He would be terribly offended if Harry offered to split the bill or worse, pay the bill himself.
Draco's body relaxed against his. He soon fell asleep; Harry carried him to his bed and tucked him in. He brushed blond hair away and planted a kiss on Draco’s forehead.
Robards cleared his throat and waited until he had obtained everyone’s attention before speaking. “As we were just explaining to Potter here, the perpetrator you caught yesterday was using the warehouse to grow various types of plants - many of which are heavily regulated by the Department of Magical British Biota - to use as ingredients. During your skirmish with him, Potter, you destroyed a few crates containing spattergroit spores. Both of you inhaled a dangerous amount of them.”
Harry pauses. He knows the answer, of course, but is trying to decipher how this information is relevant.
At the top of the hill was a small hut, in which they took shelter from the harsh elements. Inside, Draco had arranged several flat stones to masquerade as a stool and a table. On the table sat an emerald green sphere the size of a Remembrall. A small key-shaped trinket suspended inside the misty orb. Numerous narrow cracks ran around the surface of the sphere.
Potter had cut his hair short, though still untamed and unruly. He was clean-shaven and sported a new pair of round-rimmed spectacles. He had also grown since sixth year. Perhaps now that the Dark Lord was dead, he finally had time to eat properly.
“Well, I am.” Harry tucks strands of silky blond hair behind Malfoy’s ear before pulling his hand back. He has promised himself he won’t make any moves on Malfoy while the other wizard is ill, but here he is, very close to breaking his own promise if he isn’t careful. “I’m going to ask the house elves to send some food. You can either stay in bed or accompany me while I eat on your sofa.”
under a cauldron. “These three are only found in a certain part of the world —  Learn your geography, Potter, I’m not spoon-feeding you — so if you check recent shipments from this region into the country or history of recent travels, it’ll narrow down your list of suspects. You’re welcome, oh Chosen One.”
“What do you need now, Potter?”
"Well, that was reassuring," remarked Harry sarcastically after the session ended.
“I assume you meant I
And of course, there was a lot of time for sex.
After that first jump, Harry returns to
“And we have mated,” Draco announces flippantly, fingers typing briskly on his panel. “Let’s drink to a pleasurable coupling.”
At the finals of the University Basketball Spring Tournament, Draco won the MVP award. He hugged the trophy close to his chest throughout the entire closing ceremony. He only allowed Harry to pry it out of his hands before he got on Harry’s motorcycle because “I’m not having this thing dig into my back, Draco.”
Harry wasn’t ready to share his thoughts with Malfoy yet. Without another word, he went to the kitchen and got to work to distract himself.
One week before the Rosenberg game, Draco was visibly nervous. His fingers kept tapping the table in a flurry of pent-up energy.
Working as an Auror for ten years has taught Harry some detective skills, so he can tell that Malfoy harbours
“That wouldn’t be so bad, would it?” Harry tilted his head thoughtfully.
A short time later, another two guys arrived, both peeved that they had started eating without them. They were both tall and visibly tired.
“Is it? I’ve never had one. Neither do my friends. Isn’t it your parents’ responsibility to pay for your expenses?”
Greg slapped the jump ball towards Draco. Instead of grabbing it with both hands, like what Harry said he did, he stopped the ball’s trajectory with one hand, promptly flicked his wrist and pushed the ball towards Blaise. Before Rosenberg knew what was happening, Blaise had already launched the ball through their hoop.
“Where? Why? What? Urgh!” Harry groans incoherently, slamming down his bottle of butterbeer.
They froze.
He trails off and sends Teddy an apologetic look. “I’m sorry, Teddy. If you’re uncomfortable, I can tell him to come another day.”
“Neville’s bedroom is nearest to the phone, so he’s usually the one to pick up,” said Harry cheerfully. “The other two guys are Ron and Dean. You’ll meet Ron at your basketball club later. Dean is in Arts School.”
Draco chuckled. “Well, I’ll see you next week. Bye, Potter.”
They obediently drank the yellow potions as instructed and answered all her questions. She found their progress satisfactory. She was visibly impressed when Harry reported they made sure to be in the same room at all times in case one of them loses consciousness; it made her happy when her patients took her warnings seriously.
Draco hummed happily and pressed his body against Harry's back. "Brilliant, because I want you to come to bed with me."
“Is that a yes?” Draco asked hopefully, drawing closer.
Draco rubbed his forehead exasperatedly. "Then what are we?"
“Hi, Teddy, may I come in?”
All Harry could do was wait some more.
After the dinner feast, there was a gigantic cake that they made Harry cut and distribute to the guests. Years being in the public eye had taught him to treat everyone amiably, to put on a mask even when all he wanted was to hide. He felt he did a great job at hiding his despair.
They whispered good night to each other before going to sleep.
“Of course I do,” Harry remarks, beaming. “Wouldn’t want you to catch a cold again.”
Harry had promised himself that this would be his last mission with Draco. Because after years of flirting and dancing around each other, Harry was going to confess following the completion of this mission. And then, regardless of Draco's response, they would have to be separated and assigned new partners because of some Auror policy Harry had never cared for until he started developing feelings for his partner.
“Have I ever given you the impression that I care what the public thinks about me?”
Yes, Draco felt it. Frankly, he didn't need any convincing. "Show me."
"Why won't you come to my birthday party?" Potter frowned.
Harry smiled gratefully. “Thank you.” The smile vanished as he leaned forward in his seat, sporting what Hermione liked to call his ‘Game Face’. “So, serious talk now, is he good?”
Harry’s eyes followed Draco’s fan as it spun around the room and nicked the necks of the perpetrators while simultaneously introducing a quick-acting poison that caused them to lose consciousness instantly.
They had just completed their morning routine. Harry was holding his hand and pulling him towards the kitchen; he had been planning to make those scones that Draco loved again, and he wanted to get an early start before Healer Kim called.
He then recognised Weasley’s voice, so he dropped the excessively polite act. “Yes, is Potter around?”
Potter apologised for sixth year, for the scars on Draco’s chest, for failing to help when he could’ve.
Harry decides to wait until the potions effects are gone before he confesses or makes any moves. In the meantime, he’ll take care of his sick friend.
His hair was not just blond — it was
“Excellent observation, Potter.”
“Thanks,” he muttered nonchalantly and went to the front row.
So he had no choice but to wait until after dinner, once Pansy had retreated to her room on the third floor. Draco stayed in his room on the second floor for another half an hour before trotting downstairs to the telephone, which was beside the three-seater couch in the sitting room.
Later, once the lights were out and they were lying side by side, Potter asked, "Did this help you with your nightmares?"
The only unordinary thing was the white folding fan, made of enchanted paper and bamboo, Draco had open in his right hand. At its full size, the fan was longer than the span of Harry’s elbow to his fingertips. The patterns on the slats and paper depicted a white peacock, tail proud and beautiful, just like the man using it.
Pansy rubbed his back as he buried his wet face in his hands. She let him cry until he was spent before bringing him to his bedroom, which was so bland, he found himself wishing that he was still in Potter's bed right now.
They moved on to work on their assignment. At the end of their discussion, Harry asked him, “How are you going home?”
Draco felt his neck getting warm, but he could not look away. It felt like a challenge; breaking eye contact would mean defeat. “Surely basketball is more challenging.”
"As for symptoms, watch out for anything abnormal in your partner and yourself. In an event of an emergency, this Floo is connected only to the decontamination chamber in St Mungo's. Just throw Floo powder and walk in. If either of you enters this chamber, the on call team and I will be immediately alerted. Any questions?"
Daphne’s blue eyes brightened. “Oh yes! I do remember Dean inviting me, but I told him no, I’m not interested in sports.”
“Hi, may I speak with Harry Potter, please?” Draco spoke stiltedly.
Draco appeared unperturbed by the sudden change in climate. The wind was still strong here, though, so Harry obediently followed Draco as the latter trekked up a small hill.
was settled amicably. I hope you’ll have fun at the volleyball tournament, darling.”
But having
Draco suddenly banged his empty coffee cup on the table and gaped at Harry. “Of course! Why didn’t I think of this before?” He sprang to his feet and put on his cloak. “We have to go back to the shop right now!”
would willingly come to university on a
“Will you wait?” Harry hazards asking, a little amazed at his own brashness.
It takes them a week to finish one thousand multicoloured paper cranes. When Uncle Harry asks him for a wish, Teddy glances at both his godfather and Draco, who are sitting together with their clasped hands between them.
“All the more reason I should stand by!” Harry cries. “What if you pass out or get a severe reaction?”
Later that evening, Draco put aside the paperwork and rested on the couch. He dozed off at some point and woke up when Potter tapped his shoulder.
So corny.”
"Too much all at once? I'm sorry," Harry apologised when Draco nodded. "Would you like to go up to my room? Get away from this for a bit?"
“Thanks. I just felt like telling you.” Draco paused for a moment. "Thank you for this morning. I was nervous about possibly not making it into the lineup. I wouldn't have been able to forgive myself if I had ended up on the bench."
,” Narcissa said, kissing him on the cheek. “Please take care of my son, Mr Potter.”
Draco despised having people ask him about his father, but his mother was fair game. He had a lot of good things to say about Narcissa, so despite the apprehension pooling in the pit of his stomach, Draco was able to carry a conversation with Sirius while they ate lamb steaks drenched in black pepper sauce at the dining table. Throughout the conversation, Harry stuck to Draco’s side, listening with rapt attention. Remus kept glancing between Harry and Draco, smiling at whatever he saw.
Draco wondered how much Potter knew about legends of the Greek Titans, of Atlas and the globe on his back. If Draco offered to tell the story, would Potter place his head on Draco’s lap and listen attentively, like Draco had done with his mother when he was a child?
But this was his first time playing in a team and with actual opponents. Much to his chagrin, his lack of experience quickly showed.
“It’s milk, Potter."
Harry shrugged. “I didn’t find basketball interesting before.”
There, Harry had said it. He could not backtrack now. “Hermione and Ron can make it work. They even have a baby together.”
For the first time ever, Harry sees the Captain smiling when he sees Draco. When he looks at Harry, the stern mask is back on. “I believe our matter here is done. Your crew is welcomed to aboard my ship and utilise my resources. Please protect us in our travels. Welcome to
Pansy rolled her eyes and disappeared back into the house, leaving the door ajar.
Draco apologised to Potter at the Astronomy Tower, overlooking the school grounds while the cool breeze chilled him to the bones. Once the words were out, he couldn’t stop. His mind yanked at each of his mistakes, uprooting all his flaws from his first year, from the first time he spoke to Potter, from the moment he was
Everyone watched the ball fly in a smooth arc and fall straight into the basket.
Just before bedtime, Potter handed him a vial of pink potion and sheepishly pointed at the purple pustule on his right cheekbone. He took the vial and climbed onto the bed. Potter seemed eager when he took off his spectacles and rested his head on the pillow Draco had placed on his lap.
“Six o’clock.” Draco stood up and took his bag. “Don’t be late.”
Harry himself had brought success to his volleyball team. Draco still found the rules confusing and maintained his policy of only watching Harry instead of the actual game. But he had learned enough common terms to contribute his ideas whenever Harry started a deep strategic discussion.
"Has nobody warned you against being too kind?" Draco muttered, a little incredulously.
They had a belated birthday celebration for Sirius because Harry hadn’t been at their home on his real birthday. There was a vanilla sponge cake with blueberry filling and strawberry frosting which Draco and his sweet tooth loved but couldn’t eat too much of. Much to Draco’s quiet delight, Harry never left his side, always managing to place his hand either on Draco’s back, shoulder or arm.
the one who doesn't understand!"
Like a recurring nightmare, Draco found his shots being blocked time and time again. It was as if all his training the past month had evaporated due to his internal rage. They ended the first quarter lagging behind in scores.
“Don’t be. I feel less tired now, hearing your voice.” There was a rustling noise from Harry’s end, as though he was adjusting himself on his seat to get more comfortable. “I was wondering when you’d call again.”
“I have… there’s something… someone I want,” he found himself saying. Perhaps it was the alcohol in his system loosening his tongue. He would never have admitted this to Ron otherwise. “It feels selfish… to want him so much.”
Draco took Harry's hand and asked him to take him home. Harry smiled as they walked towards a future they had chosen: together.
He quickly surveyed his surroundings. He was standing in a clearing in the middle of a vast field of yellow wheat. Earthy brown mountains lined the horizon, and a strong breeze chilled him down to his bones, despite his thick Auror uniform and robes. As he looked down to inspect his boots, he realised that his glasses had vanished, but his vision was perfectly clear.
Draco laughed.
Malfoy seems to enjoy Harry’s attention, often telling tall tales and giving lengthier explanations than necessary as if simply to keep Harry longer. They sit next to each other during meals, taunt each other whenever there is a quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin and brag about how the students enjoy their respective classes more. Sometimes they even get so engrossed in their discussions that they don’t realise they have practically walked the other to class until they arrive in front of the DADA or Potions classroom.
Nodding, Harry transfigured the rock into a proper stool, complete with a cushion. He then did the same to Draco’s stone-stool. Draco muttered his gratitude as they both settled down around the table, the sphere glowing ominously.
Draco told Harry about his father’s impromptu visit to Snape’s house at the end of the summer and his first basketball meeting on Monday, including the newspaper smack. “Basically I have to practise harder if I want to be crowned the MVP," he sighed.
"You also said I was brilliant," Malfoy points out. "I thought you were just being nice.”
"That would be impolite to the widow, Potter," Draco replied.
He had to pick up and decipher the social cues from multiple people and think of appropriate responses using his own wits with no previous interaction to work on. He managed in small doses, but after a while, he desperately needed a rest.
“You’re warm,” Malfoy whispers curtly, and that is the only answer Harry gets before Madam Pomfrey arrives.
Potter was like an addictive potion. If you’d never had it, you could live and die happily, not knowing what you had missed. But once you get a taste, you’d want more and more and yet, it’d never be enough.
“One of my officers, Granger, has gotten in touch with your First Commander,” Draco says, stepping aside to make way for other officers scurrying about. This brings their bodies closer together. “We have instructed him to initiate the anchoring sequence. Let’s watch from my cockpit.”
“Ages?” Harry repeats, a little light-headed. “How long?”
“You don’t have to worry about that, Greg,” assured Draco. After all, he wasn’t interested in the game or even in the sport.
“So, did it help?” Harry asked, ignoring his coffee. “Did you figure out what was in that potion?”
Draco hoped he didn’t sound too eager when he agreed after rechecking his schedule. “Sure, I don’t have anything planned that weekend. What time is your game again?”
Draco smoothly changed his course and walked toward his teammate, who waited for him beside a girl with bright eyes and large hair.
“What?” Draco sat up straighter, his heart beating loudly in his ears. “Did you really just say…
But beneath the platinum gleam was a man who yearned to be loved, and Harry had lots of love to give.
Harry tries not to see that invitation as anything suggestive. It is near impossible. "Of course I'll stay. For as long as you need me."
Ron snorted. “You’re the least selfish person I know. You need to be
Draco warned, jabbing a finger in Potter’s direction. “Don’t talk to me.”
Harry pondered for a second before throwing caution to the wind. “I've never thought about the way your hair glimmers in the moonlight.”
No. He wasn’t losing this. He had found something that he liked, not because someone told him to, but out of his own volition. He wouldn’t let anyone make him stop.
When Draco sat in front of Healer Park, he opened his mouth and, as though channelling Potter’s energy, shared his deepest regrets with a stranger with kind eyes.
Potter took Draco's hand and lightly pressed kisses onto his knuckles. "Maybe you should come with me."
“Oh, yeah. We should start doing that. Can I call you Draco?”
“So, you think I’m the genius of the Auror department, huh?” Harry raised an eyebrow slyly.
"I'm not pining," he protested too quickly. He hadn't told anyone he had been seeing Potter every night for the past week.
“I doubt it.” Harry grimaced. “I can’t imitate Snape. He’s too depressing.”
Draco’s arm automatically swung to his left. His sharp elbow would have impaled Blaise’s face if the latter hadn’t leapt back in time. The dark-skinned man landed on his feet soundlessly, blue robes billowing around him. His Disillusionment Charm slipped off his frame like leaves falling in autumn.
, Luna tapped his shoulder.
“In your bed.”
But Potter only grunted and pulled his hands away. He turned his body and curled into a fetal position, sobs escaping his lips, still trapped in his nightmare.
“I thought you didn’t want to spend time with me outside of work.” Harry chuckled. “So all along, I could have just asked you out to dinner? I’m an idiot.”
"Malfoy, pass!" Weasley yelled from under the opponent's hoop. The defence was still running over so he was open.
When he returns to bed, Malfoy is on his stomach and sobbing into his pillow.
Was taking pleasure in The Chosen One’s embrace a crime?
Harry didn’t need to think. “All my life, I’ve had people deciding things for me, telling me what to do. I always feel I have to be a certain way, do certain things and even like certain people.” He paused to glance at Draco, who was fidgeting in his seat. “But nobody needed to tell me to love Draco. I just do. It’s my own feelings born out of my own volition and choices and no one can tell me it’s wrong, or that I shouldn’t feel this way. I am being selfish for the first time in my life and I won't apologise for it. I promise you I will do everything in my power to keep him from harm.”
Suddenly, Harry feels self-conscious and hurriedly places his hand on Draco’s jaw when the other wizard tries to lurch forward. “Wait, wait,” he says urgently.
"Would it be impolite if I fake a stomach ache ten minutes after arriving?"
being wary,” Malfoy argues, still with his head against Harry’s chest and his back to Madam Pomfrey. “Potter is here, isn’t he?”
Malfoy makes a distressed sound in his throat. He has his back to Harry, so Harry doesn't know what Malfoy is trying to say (or stop himself from saying). He is still holding the plate for Harry, who suddenly isn’t hungry anymore.
“You did, but you still feel guilty about it,” Ron pointed out, and the statement hit Harry like a punch to the gut. “Tell me, Harry. What was your nightmare last night about?”
Harry returned home and sulked in his bedroom. Five minutes before five o'clock, Ron dragged him out of bed and tried helping him find something presentable to wear. It was a disaster as both men were out of their element. It wasn't until Ginny came to the rescue that they managed to pick something decent and Floo'ed to the Burrow.
Harry hurries to Hermione’s station. “Ron? Do you see a Krurian vessel?”
But Harry barely looked at the Dark Mark. His gaze was fixed on Draco's torso, where three parallel scars ran diagonally from his right hip up to his left shoulder. Harry reached to touch the longest one, his fingers warm.
"In the same vein, I don't blame you for these scars. I've gotten over that. It was years ago. Worse things have happened since." Draco took Harry's hand away. "It was a war, Harry. We all did things we regret. Have you forgotten that you saved my life? Multiple times?"
but the event resulted in him receiving a letter from Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, cordially inviting him to have lunch at their humble abode. Formal attire, please.
This meant that when Harry arrived, hair still wet and smelling of shampoo, the only available spot in the car was next to Draco, who had to jam his fists into the pockets of his jacket to stop himself from grabbing Harry. He had his usual round-rimmed glasses on, along with a long-sleeved purple jumper and a pair of blue jeans. When he closed the door, Draco caught a whiff of his vanilla-scented soap.
“Oh thank Merlin, I thought you left,” Malfoy breathes as he turns, enveloping Harry in a bear hug. “I thought your silly brain misinterpreted my blatant and desperate need for your company and made you bugger off.”
Malfoy sniffles. “Give me another minute.”
Harry steers towards the sleeping area, pushes the peacock screen aside and heads to the unmade king-sized bed with dark emerald sheets. He tries to untangle his arms from around Malfoy’s body but the other wizard is having none of it, instead wrapping his arms around Harry’s torso and yanking him until they both fall clumsily onto the bed.
, for Merlin’s sake.
Draco scowled. "As you can see, Potter, I'm on the bench, so I'm not okay."
Potter got into bed and wandlessly spelled the lights off, plunging the room into darkness. Usually, Malfoy would turn his body to the side, away from Potter, but this time he stayed on his back and waited until his eyes adjusted to the darkness before turning towards Potter. Potter sensed his movements and looked at him, even though Draco wasn't sure how well he could see without his spectacles.
“What position?” Ron slapped his own forehead in exasperation. “You know
as he stared wide-eyed into Malfoy’s eyes, reminding himself that it was
Later, Draco fell asleep in Potter's bare arms, skin sweating in the summer heat.
Face still warm, Draco forced himself to focus on the reason he had called in the first place. “I want to thank you for yesterday. Your advice really helped us.”
Harry laughed. “It’s true. I love you.”
"Talk to him, Harry,” urged Hermione gently. “Be honest with him. Find out how he feels."
“I thought you were excellent.”
“I, well, I
play. Do you even know the rules?”
Draco’s body shuddered with laughter as Potter rolled on top of him. The cloak cascaded down Potter’s head and Draco’s fingers brushed its velvety texture while they kissed under its cover.
“How am I supposed to know you expected me to spy on Malfoy?” Ron demanded, keeping his voice low. “I didn’t even know he was in the basketball club until I saw him in the gym!”
Ron sighed, seeing right through the lie. “You still have unfinished business with him, Harry. I’ve tried suggesting to Robards to have you two be isolated separately, but he kept going on about saving resources and respecting the advice of St Mungo’s healers.” He took a deep breath before continuing. “Look, I am speaking as both a friend and your Deputy Head: take the time to get to know him. Since there is no escaping this, maybe it is finally time to confront the root cause of your nightmares. Maybe there’s a reason why you’ve always been
"Shit, Malfoy, are you okay?" Harry demands, turning him in his arms. "You're burning up."
Blaise must have detected the sadness in his response, because he didn’t say anything more. Instead, he sat quietly with Draco for a few more minutes before returning to his department.
"I want you," Draco murmured, breaths short and hot against Harry’s cheek, "but I don't… I don't know…"
As soon as Draco made the toss, Weasley appeared—out of nowhere—and jumped to block. His hand touched the ball, not enough to grab it out of the air, but more than sufficient to derail its course. The ball flew cleanly over the hoop and bounced against a wall.
“I refilled the poison and reinforced the frame with Hardening Charms, so that they don’t break as easily as before,” Blaise explained, grinning proudly. “You’re leaving on a mission tomorrow, right?”
advice?” Draco said incredulously.
“You shouldn't have saved me,” Draco murmured one night, mouth pressed against Potter’s jugular as they both lay breathless, sweaty and sated. “You should have left me in the fire.”
"I don't think he likes me very much either,” Draco commented, recalling his coach’s perpetual scowl whenever he looked at him.
They found a nice spot under a tree and sat on the grass amidst fallen orange foliage.
Draco said nothing as he watched Potter walk away.
“Thank you, Harry!” Luna smiled sweetly, handing Harry his leather jacket before he left. “Have fun on your date tomorrow.”
Draco sighed. “I don’t like the effect of alcohol on me. I lose my rationality quickly. I say stupid things. I do not remember what I do when I’m under the influence. It’s very unpleasant. I don’t know why other people do it, but hey, who am I to judge what other people do in their spare time?” he said with a big shrug.
This quarantine was
Without any warning, he chugs the potion back.
Teddy looks up at Uncle Harry, who laughs at the hope in the boy’s eyes. “Sure, anything you want, Teddy.”
Draco relaxes and looks at him expectantly.
The next time Draco managed to steal the ball (from Theo, who obviously wasn’t even trying), Blaise called for him again. Draco refused to pass. Instead, he kept the ball and immediately saw Weasley running over to defend.
Sirius was almost as fair and tall as Draco but more well-built and charismatic, carrying himself with a casual elegance that reminded Draco of his mother. His long black hair was pulled into a messy bun. When he shook Draco’s hand, his gaze lingered on the younger man’s white-blond hair. “What did you say your full name was?”
When speech finally failed him, Draco wiped his face with a sleeve. Potter slid closer and engulfed Draco’s thin body in a hug.
He was only interested in Harry.
Slowly, like a cat, Malfoy’s arms slide around Harry’s torso. He presses his cheek to Harry’s chest, his shoulders rising when he inhales deeply, tension rolling off his body. He stretches his legs around and in between Harry’s. As if that isn’t bad enough, Malfoy lets out a pleased
obsessed with him.”
“Are you well, Draco?” She quickly checked his pulse and his temperature. “Has any of the cursed letters reached you?”
“It must have been chaotic,” Draco remarked, unable to imagine it.
The first space is a sitting area that doubles as a study. There is a three-seat sofa, a coffee table and a writing desk. There are also bookshelves lining the walls, each packed with so many books they couldn’t possibly fit without Extension Charms. Then there is a small kitchen with marble countertops and a tiny sink. There is a door off to the side, which Harry suspects is the bathroom. A wooden screen, its surface depicting the drawing of a large white peacock surrounded by colourful flowers, separates the living area from the sleeping area. There is no dining table or fireplace.
Hearing Potter say that made something in Draco snap. The following words came out in waves; he could not stop them, no matter how embarrassing they were: "You make me feel safe. You should feel safe too. The least I can do for you, or I suppose, what I
Harry kisses Malfoy’s shoulder. “What are you worried about?”
Healer Kim smiled widely. "Certainly. But they would need to come to St Mungo's, enter this decontamination chamber with me and follow all the necessary precautions before I can allow them to make a Floo call to you. There have been rare cases of spattergroit being transmitted during Floo calls, so I am not taking any chances.
The sphere exploded into a hundred pieces before vanishing into thin air.
“Then take them off,” Draco commanded, playing along. “Take
Harry finishes putting the books and essays on the coffee table before looking at Malfoy incredulously. “You what?”
to stay, but now that I'm here, I want to. You have a neat shop. Whatever you're working on smells nice."
As he got his bearing, he felt the air chill and the wind blow stronger. He heard footsteps approaching, and immediately grabbed his wand by his hip.
Suddenly the lights in the cockpit turn red and an alarm blares from the overhead comms.
Harry gives Ron, his First Commander, the Captain’s Chair before heading to the Teleportation Chamber.
About five metres from where Harry stood, a tall wall of wheat parted and out walked Draco Malfoy, decked in his elegant navy blue Unspeakable uniform. His skin was pale and there were dark circles below his eyes, but he appeared unharmed. His usually immaculate blonde hair was slightly tousled, thanks to the breeze.
“Your dedication to following your father’s orders while also doing nothing is impeccable,” Draco said, smiling despite himself.
“Why not?” Potter grinned. “Although, I should tell you before we go in…" He stepped closer, and Draco couldn’t avoid gazing into his emerald eyes. “I really like you, Draco. I think I’m in love with you.”
“The Sorting in first year? You remember that?”
Feeling like an idiot, Harry dropped to his knees and picked up the nearest book, the cover of which looked strikingly similar to one of his own textbooks. “I’m sorry, I—” He held the book out and froze, words caught in his throat because at that moment, the blond lifted his head and stared at Harry with cool grey eyes.
Harry looked at the bright side. At least they had two weeks of rest. As much as he loved his job, he had been pushing himself too hard lately. Ron and Hermione had been reminding him to take a break, but Harry frankly hadn’t seen the point. Why rest when he could help catch bad guys before they do bad things? Malfoy was just as much of a workaholic as him, so it felt natural. Harry loved working on cases. He loved to solve mysteries and help civilians. He loved them even more since being partnered with Malfoy. He loved watching Malfoy work.
"I'm so glad you're alright," Harry said, holding Draco even tighter. "I missed you so much."
Draco's nimble fingers tapped the surface of the stone absentmindedly. "If you say so. It's not like I can go anywhere."
The blond shrugged as if he couldn't care less. “Alright.”
“And that thing followed you here?” Harry raised an unbelieving eyebrow, but it explained why nobody mentioned finding any cursed objects around Draco’s unconscious body.
together."
“Tuesday is volleyball day,” Draco exhaled, recalling the first day they met. He pressed his face against a cushion, embarrassed. “I’m sorry.”
From the other bed, Harry gave her a bashful grin. “Can I stay here longer? Keep Draco company until he can go home?”
They had long crossed the line from being on opposite sides of a war to being lovers.
For the rest of the day, Harry tried very hard to be a good Birthday Boy.
When it was time for him to go, Potter headed to the fireplace, which earned him a scolding from Draco.
He brought Potter to the university cafe where they sat on opposite sides of a small table. After their drinks arrived, Draco demanded to know why Potter was here.
“Did you ask?”
Draco was under observation in the general ward for three more days. Harry stayed with him throughout; nobody dared to kick The Chosen One out. The staff even provided him with meals and drinks even though he wasn’t a patient anymore. Refusing them quickly proved to be useless because they kept coming. Every time Harry grumbled about this, Draco just laughed and thanked him for keeping him company, and this would immediately cheer Harry up.
Draco didn’t reply, but he reread the letter multiple times over the next few weeks.
As expected, Davies was the most reluctant. “That’s an advanced technique, Malfoy. We’ve never tried it during practice. We might screw up badly.”
After experimenting at the hospital, they had discovered that if Harry phrased his sentences into questions, the potion wouldn’t kick in and he could say what he wanted. “What do you want to do now?” he asked.
Draco’s jaw dropped. “You only say that because—”
“Does this have anything to do with that Potter bloke?” Theo asked while munching. “The one who gave you advice during the Rosenberg game that basically won the match for us?”
our clothes off.”
“Perhaps,” he replied, catching Harry’s hand that had been playing with his hair. “You never asked, so I never gave it a thought.”
Eventually, Harry cleared his throat. “Hey, uh, my volleyball tournament is going to start soon. The first game is next Saturday, at the City Stadium. I’ll have only one match, and then afterwards, my dad and godfather are coming to visit me. So, er, if you’re free, would you like to come to my game? And then join me at my house later?”
“Will I get you to call me chocolate love or—?” Harry whispers cheekily but is interrupted by Draco’s laugh.
"I'm not sure," Hermione admitted. "There are only two minutes left in the first half. Maybe Snape thinks Malfoy has been making too many mistakes. But that pass from Malfoy was really fast. I'm impressed Ron caught that."
Draco wheels toward Harry again. “Tell me more,” he implores, eyes curious and intrigued as he grips the front of Harry’s jumper, “about this alleged obsession you have towards me.”
Harry’s stomach clenched. The name of the class sounded familiar.
"I, uh, I thought you liked me too," he says, voice low. "Am I wrong?"
When Harry first closed the distance between their lips, conflict erupted within Draco. Half of him was beyond himself with questions
The day they closed the case, they all went out to celebrate — the usual suspects, with the unsurprising addition of Draco. Harry insisted on buying Draco a drink and ignored Seamus’s loud remark —
Draco lobbed the ball at Greg, who jumped high, grabbed it clean off the air and turned mid-leap to dunk it into the basket. While the crowd cheered, Draco went up to Smith and sneered right at his face.
"I, uh, I don't mind," Harry stammers. "And you are, you know. Hot. Both in the fever sense and the… other sense."
Did he also love the git to death? Utterly and completely.
With that, Madam Pomfrey exits Malfoy’s quarters, the door clicking shut behind her.
day?”
Harry knelt behind the players' bench, keeping his head low so that he could hide behind the other players. He noticed a guy with brown hair glancing at him curiously but he only focussed his attention on Draco. He carefully tapped Draco on the back.
Malfoy seems to calm down the more Harry caresses his cheek. “I’m not hungry.”
A grimace flits across Malfoy’s pale face. “I think you should leave," he croaks weakly. He attempts to move away but is stopped by Harry's hands on his shoulders. He is still warm but not as bad as the day before.
On the day of the Hogsmeade trip, Malfoy doesn't turn up. Neville cackles at the look of utter despair on Harry’s face.
"I wear my heart on my sleeve.” Harry wraps his arms tighter around Malfoy’s waist. “And guess who's in my heart."
“Please refrain from breathing down my neck, Potter,” Draco remarked coolly. “Unless you’d like a front seat to the explosion that’s bound to happen if you distract me. In which case, do go on.”
Draco’s entire world had shifted on its axis and yet, he had never felt more enlightened.
Harry, who usually hated getting special treatment because of his popularity, simply nodded and thanked her gratefully.
Harry urged Draco to step forward. “Remus, this is Draco. Draco, this is my dad, Remus.”
“No,” Potter said firmly. “When I sent that letter on your birthday, I hadn't gotten my soulmark yet, and you had just gotten yours. I couldn’t have known. I’ve been obsessed with you since I was sixteen. I realised later that I have feelings for you. Travelling the world taught me that I should explore these feelings before it’s too late.”
Harry sees the smile again when he’s deep inside Malfoy, when fingernails are dragging down his back and long legs are around his hips and those thin pink lips are murmuring Harry’s name like a prayer. He feels undone, utterly enamoured and hopelessly in love. The only thing better than seeing his smile is kissing him, so Harry leans in and does just that. Malfoy kisses him back with new levels of passion, hunger and boldness; it brings Harry even closer to the edge.
“Harry?” Draco said later in bed, after a plate of roasted chicken and peas was placed on his lap. “How would I eat this?”
Ron’s face fell. “I was worried about that. You've always wanted to get closer to Malfoy, but have you considered that spending more time with him than usual might trigger your nightmares?”
Potter stared at the glass for so long, Draco almost lost his patience. Then Potter piped up, “If I drink this, do I have to brush my teeth again?”
“Hi,” the other student greeted, smiling. He placed an elbow on the table and rested his head on his palm, all the while not taking his green eyes off of Draco. “I’m Harry Potter. You?”
“I’m sorry I’m not the person you wished to spend the day with. If I don’t already know how you feel about Malfoy, I’d be offended,” the Herbology teacher remarks as they grab a quick drink in town.
Completely hidden, he nodded.
The scarf was thick, warm and felt expensive. “Thank you, Mrs Malfoy.”
As soon as he, Neville and the students return to Hogwarts, Harry goes straight down to the dungeons and to the Potions classroom.
until he felt raw and sick.
"Is that why you wear an earring?” Harry tilted his head, eyes going to the stud in question. “To piss off your dad?"
Draco ignored his friend, determined to try again. He swivelled around Theo and dribbled until he was close enough for another shot.
“You deserved this,” Harry said, immediately biting down on his tongue and cursing.
“Deal,” said Harry cheerfully.
“Is there an owl I can borrow?” asked Luna, removing the glass from Harry’s hand.
“Yes. We managed to control the infection before it got too severe,” the Healer jumped in before Robards could answer. She stepped forward, pushing her thick-rimmed glasses up her nose and smiled at her two patients. Her long raven hair was pulled back into a ponytail. “I’m Healer Kim. As both of you know, spattergroit is very contagious. That’s why we are wearing Protective Bubble-Body Charms. These are full-body and stronger versions of the Bubble-Head Charm,” she explained, gesturing at the blue bubble-thing. “Both of you were infected by the same strain, so you don’t need the Bubble Charm around each other. Anyone else, however, is vulnerable to catch the infection from you. We were discussing with Auror Potter about your treatment options.
Harry almost bit his own tongue. "What?"
This went on for several minutes, Healer Kim listing out symptoms and Harry and Malfoy shaking their heads at each one. When she asked whether they had taken their potions for today, they shook their heads too.
“We might, but only in the beginning,” Blaise said, saving Draco the trouble of explaining himself. “We just need a couple of trial runs to sync our tempo, then we’ll be good to go.”
And maybe, just maybe, it was the same for Potter.
Weasley shrugged. “You’re not as fast as him.”
When the professor turned to draw on the blackboard, Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and squeezed, halting the erratic tapping. Draco quickly looked at him and opened his mouth, but Harry hushed him, nodding at Professor Scrimgeour, who had faced the students again.
Harry glared at Ron with such intensity that the red-haired man fidgeted in his seat. This went on for a couple of minutes before Ron slammed his pen on the table and hissed, “What?”
“What? Who?” Blaise demanded.
Draco studied Harry's face silently for a few seconds before answering, "After our kiss at the pub." He tucked strands of blond hair behind his ears and cleared his throat. "I was just curious. There is no benefit in knowing your soulmate, after all. It's old magic; interesting to study, but practically, it isn't useful."
Draco deflated, feeling energy being sucked out of him. “He’s my father. Do you… know him?”
but I'm also right here. I'm right in front of you and I'm in love with you. But you don't want to see that. You don't
“I just finished a tournament.” Draco guided Harry’s hand higher. “You’re going to have to do all the work.”
Harry was distracted while preparing breakfast. He burnt the toasts, spilled sugar all over the kitchen counter and overcooked his eggs. The day didn't start off very well for him.
After a short pause, Draco turns to face Harry and pulls on his hand, sending Harry reeling forward.
"My friends, the ones who matter, already know." And they are worried about what this arrangement is doing to Harry's feelings.
were like lightning, he himself would never win in a foot race. If he forced himself, he could sprint for a while before having to slow down to recover. He wouldn’t do well in a marathon, either. Since basketball is a timed game, he would always know how long he’d be expected to play, and conserve his energy accordingly. Draco had never played a single game for more than an hour.
When the players started walking in, the first thing Draco noticed was Harry and his spectacles, which were unlike any Draco had seen him wear before. This pair resembled his motorcycle glasses in terms of shape and fit, but the lenses were transparent and there was a band that went around his head. His black hair was as tousled as ever. He wore a short-sleeved, maroon-and-gold jersey with matching shorts, which showed off a generous amount of muscular thighs and calves.
When Harry sees on the staff notice board that he is scheduled to chaperone the students to Hogsmeade this weekend, he is excited. A big grin appears on his face. He goes to the Great Hall for lunch with a barely concealed spring in his step.
It takes just a second; Harry notes the exact moment Malfoy tastes it, when the blond moans almost in surprise and proceeds to suck on Harry’s bottom lip, on his tongue and pries Harry’s mouth open wider. Harry feels like he is being eaten alive, the way Malfoy swipes his mouth with his tongue, the way Malfoy grips his head, the way Malfoy’s arse slides against his thigh.
Harry found Draco Malfoy lying on a lounge chair by the swimming pool at the topmost deck of the cruise ship. The blond wore a pair of large sunglasses, which Harry didn’t see the point of because the sun wasn’t too bright and he was completely shaded by a large umbrella next to him. His light blue polo shirt was open at the collar and his khaki shorts rode up his pale thighs when he crossed his legs, one calf over the other.
Harry was not the tallest player in his team, but he was undeniably the fastest and the most mesmerizing to watch.
They broke apart, gasping for air. Back still pressed against the door, Draco blinked at Harry, who appeared to be winded, eyes wide and licking his lips slowly, as though he couldn’t believe what had just happened.
The look of utter confusion on Harry’s face made Draco laugh.
said Granger, sounding unconvinced, “but you don’t know when you might develop severe symptoms, like extreme fatigue, confusion, memory loss
to be safe. When it came clean, he studied the writing which looked familiar. It was only after he took out the letter and read the content that he realised why.
Before he could think of a response, a fire roared to life in the living room fireplace. They went to the living room and saw Healer Kim's head in the fire. Her head was surrounded by a Bubble-Head Charm. She smiled when Harry and Malfoy knelt in front of her.
Harry turned just in time to catch Draco in his arms. His green eyes were the last thing Draco glimpsed before his mind plunged into darkness.
“Watch me play. You might learn something.”
Harry tossed a volleyball to Draco, who caught it easily. “I want to practise my spikes. I need you to throw the ball.”
His voice is husky and raw.
Harry gazed into his cool grey eyes. “You know why,” he muttered. “Apparently I’m your soulmate.”
To Draco’s surprise, Potter’s smile vanished. He looked stricken. “It’s… not me?”
Draco kept his eyes on the professor’s ruler, ready to evade in case it strikes again, but the Professor walked away with a huff. Draco turned and saw the bespectacled guy from earlier sitting to his left.
Harry smirked and
“Do you want to know what I was doing at the apothecary when you bumped into me yesterday?” Draco asked the following afternoon after the potions’ effects finally wore off, hands around a steaming cup of tea.
Back in his bedroom, Draco placed the trophy and certificate on his dresser, grinning proudly at his accomplishment.
The bastard did not bother answering his question. Instead, from his own bed, Potter leaned towards Draco’s, eyes attractively green behind his round-rimmed spectacles. “Malfoy, are you alright? How are you feeling?” he asked seriously.
"Draco? Draco!" Harry shook his shoulders. When he didn't respond, he placed a hand on his chest, which barely moved.
During morning lectures, he realised that he hadn’t thanked Harry for his advice.
"I'm not sure," Draco said groggily, resting his head on Harry's shoulder. "I feel sleepy."
The short moment of silence reminded Harry of what he wanted to say, what he had scripted in his head while making breakfast. “I want to thank you for last night,” he began. “Er… The nightmares… Yes, I still have them. Sometimes.”
When the dreaded day came, Draco dressed him up and managed to get them both ready and arrive at the Manor right on time. Narcissa Malfoy and a house elf named Jumpy greeted them at the front door. She hugged Draco tightly for a long time before wrapping Harry in a similar embrace, albeit more briefly.
“Um, my glasses, for instance.” Harry pointed at his eyewear. “Prescription glasses are expensive so I try to pay for them myself. The same goes for most of my volleyball gear.”
Harry cried in disbelief, eyes skirting between Draco and Sirius.
"I think…" Draco closed his eyes, picturing Potter's joyful smiles and hearing his own heartbeats loud in his ears. "I think I'm in trouble."
Then, much to Harry's surprise, Ron grabbed Draco's upper arm and pointed in Harry’s direction.
Snape blew his whistle, signalling the time was up. Draco’s successful shot had earned his team three points, so the game had ended in a tie.
That had been the correct thing to say, because Potter instantly grinned, as bright as sunshine. "Damn right you are!" He cleared his throat and tried to keep a straight face. "So is that why…you said you were glad I became your partner?"
“Volleyball?” For the first time since meeting Harry, Draco felt disappointed. “I expected something more exciting.”
"My nightmares lately have been about…" He took a deep breath, "you."
"Your dad sounds like an arse," said Harry lightly.
Pansy said it looked like the root of a tree, or a leafless tree if you looked at it upside-down, but Draco knew better. He had seen the exact pattern across the sky during a rainstorm.
When the man’s gaze dropped to the book in Harry’s hand, he took it with a murmured “Thanks” and turned to grab his leather bag. His hair had fallen forwards so he tucked it back behind an ear, drawing Harry’s attention again to his hair, long fingers and — Harry’s breath hitched — a lone black stud on his left earlobe.
They were to play three-on-three matches. “Half-court. Fifteen minutes time limit,” Snape explained. “Two points for any scores made inside the three-point line, and three points outside.”
Teddy nods, and Uncle Harry steps in and sits wordlessly next to him on the carpet.
Potter,” Draco clarified, rolling his eyes as he slowly pulled his hand out of Harry’s grasp. “I suppose now that you’re involved, I can explain how I got here, while we wait for the Transporter to recharge.”
Something dangerous flashed in Harry’s green eyes as he rolled on top of Draco. “That’s the price I’m willing to pay.”
Harry is sweating. Did he make a mistake?
Draco detested Rosenberg’s Zacharias Smith instantly. The guy had an obnoxious face and an even more despicable attitude. His gameplay was mediocre but he was extraordinarily annoying and sucked all the fun out of the game. For some reason, he particularly enjoyed taunting Draco. When Smith successfully stopped Draco from scoring in the first quarter, he emitted a shrill laugh.
Once again, Harry doesn't know where to put his hands, which are suspended awkwardly in the air.
"You can't see me, can you?" Harry murmured bleakly. "No, you refuse to. You always work hard for people to acknowledge your work and that's
At the end of the lecture, Harry said, “Good luck today.”
Harry emerged from the kitchens, grinning widely when he saw the two new guests. He grabbed Draco’s wrist and practically hauled him as they both approached the two men. Harry only let him go in favour of throwing his arms around the tall brown-haired gentleman with thick black-rimmed glasses.
It takes a long time for Malfoy to open the door; he clearly hasn’t been expecting visitors. When the door finally creaks open and Malfoy’s flushed face peeks through the gap, Harry’s heart feels like it is being impaled by an arrow.
The idea sounded extremely terrifying, but Harry nodded and said, "Okay."
A moan escaped Draco’s throat; he was so embarrassed he almost broke the kiss, but the sound roused something ferocious inside Harry; he forcefully backed Draco against his bedroom door and deepened their kiss.
"Potter, I want you to know. You don't need to apologise for having nightmares. I used to have them too. I… I understand, is what I'm trying to say. So you don't have to be sorry."
“Hi, you’re early,” Harry says once he is near enough. He offers a hand, which Draco takes without hesitation.
In the kitchen, they sat together on a wooden bench, surrounded by treats and desserts. Potter talked openly and happily, as if enjoying Draco’s company. He remained this way — treating Draco in a friendly manner — until they reached Draco’s private dorm. He was the only Slytherin who had returned for Eighth Year so he had a room to himself.
On the bedside table was an old tennis shoe, which was the Portkey that would bring them to the safe house where they would spend the next two weeks together.
Potter’s arms tightened around Draco's bare body, pulling him until his long pink scars kissed Potter's brown skin.
Draco couldn’t help the guilt gnawing his insides. “I’m sorry.”
“So be it,” he said, resuming his movements. “You know how strong my Silencing Charms are.”
“You again,” Draco noted, blinking.
“Why?”
All this happened over the span of only a day.
Any talk about souls — extracting, separating, severing — always reminded Harry of Horcruxes. Even when Hermione was explaining to him the plan to save Draco by sending Harry’s soul after him, Harry had been uneasy. Their real bodies — both his and Draco’s — were lying in a ward in St Mungo’s, lifeless and dependent on magic to keep them alive. “Sounds like something you should stay away from.”
Malfoy opened his mouth, but nothing came out, as though he had forgotten to speak. Or, Harry realised, he had yelled himself hoarse trying to wake Harry up. That explained the pain blooming on his cheek; Malfoy had literally slapped him to consciousness.
Draco couldn't count the number of times they dragged the other inside alcoves or empty classrooms for a snog. Potter’s lips were warm, delicious, sometimes even sweet. He kissed with a passion Draco envied, with his whole body leaning in and his hands all over Draco like a starving man.
“I appreciate your chivalry,
When Harry placed a helmet in Draco’s hands, the latter stared at it in confusion. “What are you doing?”
closed his eyes. His face relaxed as he dozed off in Draco’s lap.
Harry chuckled. Draco smiled before they both leaned forward and their mouths met in a chaste kiss.
Malfoy jerks up and starts rambling, "Don't be daft. Of course I like you! That's the only reason I didn’t kick you out as soon as the potion started working. I like hugging you. I love it when you hold me. But I also hate embarrassing myself in front of you. Nothing frightens me more than you discovering how hopelessly infatuated I am with you. How I call you endearing names in my head. How I fantasise about you." He buries his blushing face in his hands, but the words don’t stop. "I assumed you liked me, but you never touched me back when I touched you before this...
He leaves Harry, Dean and Seamus in the hallway without any guards, but never lets them out of his sight even as he opens a private communication channel to – Harry hopes – Captain Malfoy.
After promising to owl some snacks and give Hermione Harry’s regards, Ron ended the Floo call. Harry spelled away the Silencing Charm but stayed by the fireplace to collect his thoughts. Against his better judgement, he quietly turned his body so that he faced Malfoy at the writing desk. The scratch of Malfoy’s quill against parchment served as background noise as Harry watched Malfoy work, something he had done many times in their own office.
The events of each nightmare differed every night, but sometimes they repeated themselves. The most frequent version was the one where Harry really did kill Malfoy. Malfoy had bled to death in the bathroom because Harry didn’t know the countercurse to the very spell he himself had cast.
Before the semester started, Lucius had dragged Draco to meet the basketball coach, who apparently had been his father’s junior in high school. Draco had sat by awkwardly as the two adults conversed over cups of tea, Lucius telling stories about the Malfoy family while Severus Snape remained silent, seemingly unimpressed. Throughout the entire exchange, Snape never once looked at Draco. It was only after they walked out of the front door that Snape had placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder, given him an irritated scowl and pushed him unkindly towards his father’s limousine.
Draco’s jaw went slack; no words came out as he stared unblinkingly at Harry’s face.
Lucius’s legs had been damaged during his short sentence in Azkaban, and his mind sometimes lost the plot as he blacked out from time to time. But during his moments of clarity, he gazed lovingly at his wife and son. During the meal, Narcissa asked Harry basic questions about his work, family and aspirations while Lucius listened quietly and only spoke after the last course was over. He asked Harry why he had chosen his son.
Beside him, Harry began to chuckle but stopped when Narcissa approached him.
They didn’t get to talk much in the library. The librarian, a fussy middle-aged lady with dirty blond curls and large horn-rimmed glasses, would berate any student who even whispered in her vicinity. After obtaining the reading materials they needed, Harry suggested they study at the campus park instead.
A big mistake.
“Not bad,” said Harry. “I don’t remember… Did I wake you up?”
“What if I promise I’ll make it worth the wait?”
There, Potter did it again. Since they started regularly meeting up in private, Potter had been dropping hints that he couldn't wait to let everybody in the Wizarding World know about them. Draco, however, was still paranoid. Unlike Potter's, his reputation was far from good. His family name had been tarnished after the war and even though they managed to keep their riches, people didn't like to be associated with known Death Eaters. That was why Draco struggled to find a Wizarding job or a Potions apprenticeship until this day, and why he now mostly hid in the Muggle World.
A mediwitch reminded them that visiting hours were over. Narcissa bid farewell to Draco, kissing him on both cheeks. Then she went to Harry, took his hands in hers and said, “Please take care of my son, Mr Potter.”
If being the best was what he had to be, then so be it.
“What difference would it make?”
“Show me the cargo,” Harry says suddenly.
Madam Pomfrey takes out her wand and casts diagnostic charms on Draco. “Your temperature and other vital signs are normal,” she reports. “How are you feeling?”
“Err,” Harry said, confused.
Harry smiled, gingerly brushing Draco's cheek with the pad of his thumb. "I always feel like something is missing between us. Don't you feel it too? Don't you want to find out what it is?"
with Potter wasn't any less terrifying. Nobody would be pleased to learn that The Saviour was sharing a bed with a Death Eater. Any animosity would certainly be directed at Draco. He was a criminal, after all.
When Draco is done, the paper has taken the shape of a creature with wings, a long neck and a sharp beak. “This is a paper crane,” he explains, balancing the paper crane on one palm. “I can make it fly. Look.”
"I almost did."
offend Draco's ego, it didn't. Draco welcomed Potter's attention, relished in it. It made Draco feel special. Safe.
The parcel was addressed to “Harry Potter & Draco Malfoy” without any address. Harry deduced that the owl was a DMLE-trained owl who knew the location of the safe house they were in. He decided to wait for Malfoy before opening it.
“Where are your other housemates?” asked Draco after Harry offered to take his jacket.
Once Draco was out of sight, having gone to the changing rooms with the rest of his team, Harry picked up his backpack. “Are you going to wait for Ron?”
Potter smiled. By the play of moonlight and shadows, Draco was reminded of how handsome the other man had become.
if Malfoy thought he was pathetic? The man had seen him cry in his sleep. “We’re stuck in this situation because of me. And you were angry at me.”
”I know.” Harry reluctantly released Draco’s hand. “You’ll do great.”
At the Burrow, Arthur had set up tents outside the house. Harry had dropped by and offered to help Ron with the decorations but he kept thinking about how Draco wouldn't even be at the party, so he was distracted and wasn't very efficient. Even Ron lost patience with him and told him to leave the tasks to other people.
"Is he going to be alright?" Harry demanded, adrenaline still rushing through his veins. "He passed out right in front of me and I remember you said
Later that night, Draco had his head on Harry's lap, chin tilted up as Harry carefully dropped potion on the lone purple pustule on his jaw. He kept touching Draco’s face long after the pustule was gone and the procedure was completed because he couldn’t help himself, and Draco let him.
Harry remembers how to breathe and quickly says, "You're my friend too."
“I tried taking a hot shower, but it didn't help,” Malfoy declares in dismay. “I still need you.”
Harry doesn’t have time to survey the equipment because at that moment, the Captain's Chair swirls around, demanding every ounce of Harry’s attention.
Harry wonders what conversation has transpired between the father and son during the short time it took for Harry to walk here. “That’s very generous of him.”
“Whenever you receive the ball, you always hold it between your hands before you do anything with it. You waste a few milliseconds, giving time for your opponent to get closer to you to block you. In volleyball, we never really hold the ball once it’s in play; we just divert it elsewhere.”
“The old man forced me to join something.” Theo sounded bored, as though the very act of speaking about his father made him drowsy. “It was between being stuck here with you brats or with Vince in football. Basketball has fewer players on the court, so my chances of remaining on the bench are higher.”
With nothing in the way, Draco drank in the deep green of Harry’s eyes and the heated desire in them. Harry’s hands were sliding up his spine and around his waist, bringing their bodies even closer still, and Draco’s brain practically melted because he had spent the entire day fantasizing about being in Harry’s arms and here he was.
Neither of them had real jobs; they didn’t have to. Nowadays, Potter was more known as a philanthropist while Draco mostly kept to himself in the flat he shared with Pansy in Muggle London, spending away his inheritance while looking for things to do. Draco didn't subscribe to the Daily Prophet, but Blaise sometimes sent copies through the Floo. That meant Draco knew whenever Potter was on the news.
“You’re welcome. So...” Blaise drew out his words, “when are you going to tell Potter you’re in love with him?”
Soulmarks showed you who your magic was most compatible with. But they didn’t necessarily go both ways. The mark just implied that Draco’s magic was compatible with Potter’s, but Potter could have a different person altogether as his soulmate. Soulmates could range from romantic to platonic, strangers to enemies. This field of magic was poorly understood.
"Potter," he murmured. With how close they were, he didn't need to speak above a whisper. "I want to try something. It might help you with your nightmares."
Draco practically moved to Grimmauld Place because the house had strong wards to repel any Howlers or unfriendly letters. Before moving, he warned Blaise, Greg and Theo not to send him any letters for fear that they would be traced back either to him or to them. Pansy then quickly sold off their flat and escaped to Paris. Reporters and ‘concerned citizens’ hunted down all of Harry’s friends, demanding to know whether it was true:
"I'm going to take a shower. I'll be quick," he adds when Malfoy's shoulders sag. "Sorry. Just bear with it for a while. I'll hug you as soon as I'm done."
This turn of events magnified the insecurities Harry had been too afraid to face until now. How could he love someone he had almost killed? How could Draco ever feel anything romantic towards him, after what he had done?
Draco lowered himself onto the armchair, back straight and hands folded in his lap. “I’m fine, thank you,” he said stiltedly.
Draco, who had been busy adjusting his hair, grudgingly looked up and stilled when his gaze landed on Harry.
Blaise. Just let me have this a bit longer.”
"Okay," Harry whispers, blissful. "Tomorrow."
Harry raked his fingers through his black hair, a weird expression fleeting across his face, as though he couldn’t believe his luck. “Come on. I’ll give you a ride home.”
Harry recalls Captain Lucius Malfoy’s irritated drawl:
"I ask that you two keep monitoring each other. If one of you loses consciousness and doesn't respond to call or pain, quickly come through this Floo like I've told you."
Malfoy shoots Harry a disturbed look. “I’ve never tried it before. I’m not sure how I’ll react to it.”
When there were only three minutes on the clock, Davies jogged next to Draco and said with a smirk, “Hey, Malfoy. Time to show off.”
This invited even more snide remarks from Smith. "Reduced to just passing now, are we? What would Mr Lucius Malfoy say?"
Draco ordered for the both of them, assuring Harry that it was only natural, seeing as he was the only one of the duo with taste. Harry huffed but let him order what looked like half of the coffee shop’s stock.
Eventually, Zabini returns to their side, a resigned expression across his features. “The Captain has generously bestowed us his permission. I am to escort you to the Second Cockpit.”
Harry follows Malfoy to the cauldron back at the classroom.
