Tom Riddle
Hermione conjured a handkerchief to wipe her eyes, and her nose.
“Harry’s worst memory. Worse than the people he’s lost, the people he saw die. Worse than dying himself. Something he did that made him see himself in a completely different light. Something he has so much shame about that he’s never spoken of it again.”
This was partially true. But mostly a load of horse shite. Few knew better than Draco how important it was to take proper rest, to recover and recharge. But somewhere between his brain and his tongue, his essential self had seen the opportunity to make an excuse for the rest he really needed.
He was in love with Harry sodding Potter, with his stupid martyr complex and his tragic backstory and the things he’d done, the strength he’d had to do what was right no matter how difficult it was. He loved Harry, and he had since long before he’d taken the Dark Mark. He loved Harry at least as much as he hated him, wanted him more than all of that. Lived for his stupid smiles, when they were real, when they crinkled his eyes; lived for the moments of honesty between them, even when they were awful.
“Does anyone have a snack an owl might like?” Draco called. All over the day room, patients stood, approaching the owl that was gripping tightly to Draco’s wrist. He was busily untying the message with his free hand, and the owl, in the meantime, was enjoying a great deal of attention, several pieces of fruit and lots of gentle neck scratching.
Draco rose to his feet, shifting the wand in his hand. It was longer and heavier than most and he seemed to be experimenting to find the right point of balance. He turned back to Harry, who gave him a reassuring smile.
Draco hesitated, and shook his head. And then nodded, and then shook his head again. He drew two rolls of parchment from the pocket of his robes.
“Thank you.” He might have stood a little straighter; he was certain he looked a little more smug.
. You know I can come by when you have some time in the evenings, help you relax…”
It was so fucking humiliating.
“That’s what you think?” Ginny asked, innocently. “Hmm. Funny. Yesterday at brunch Draco looked like he could barely sit, and unless he got bitten by a goblin —”
It took less than half an hour in the library to find the recipe and instructions. Tomorrow night, he told himself, he’d get this sorted right out.
“Don’t misunderstand, darling. I am very pleased. I thought for a while that you might end up marrying that dreadful half-Veela boy —”
“Oh, not him. Fuck, probably gets a marriage proposal once a week, but he always says he’s married to the job, laughs it off. And he only dates models and movie stars, innit?”
With that, Draco closed the Floo, warded his door, and made his way to Harry’s room. He took a very long time preparing. He used almost half a tub of potion on Harry’s skin, beginning with his feet, moving up his legs, spending extra time on the scars that were tightening over the weeks and months. His stomach, his chest. Again, the scars, working the potion in to soften them.
“I thought your imagination had rather a lot going for it, actually,” Draco replied. He looked like he might melt; his pale cheeks were stained with a bright flush, his mouth was red and kiss-swollen, and he was looking at Harry like he was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen.
into a vampire,” Professor Saltzman said. “Isobel Flamel. Obsessed with immortality. You might have heard of her, uh… dozens of times great grandfather.”
“I’m perfect,” Harry said. “I’m here with you. Day off. Nowhere to go, nothing to do… just us.”
“And then there was… Tom Riddle,” Harry said. “I fought him for the first time when I was eleven years old. No one believed me for years. It’s alright,” he said, raising a hand. “I do understand, and it’s not a problem. But it’s true. And Albus Dumbledore… he took actions that would only ever ensure that I would live long enough to defeat Tom Riddle. He expected that I would die. And I did, as well.”
“I don’t think I really want to be, though. I think I just want to sleep. I don’t think it’s so bad, sleeping. Sirius said it, you know. He said it was faster than falling asleep.” Harry closed his eyes. “Thank you, though. I think I’ll sleep better than I would have before. But I really do think I’m done.”
Saturday night, Harry ate Chinese food at Grimmauld Place with Ron and Hermione. The two of them were going to see a movie, afterwards, enjoying the last few weeks before Ron sat his exams and became a fully qualified Auror, and his hours became much less predictable. Harry, on the other hand, was planning to hit Muggle London and find himself someone to waste an evening with.
“I know you can be hard to see, but I think we both know I’m well trained and remarkably powerful,” Harry said. “I’ve done my best, the last couple of weeks, to be respectful, since I assume you’re here to watch me for Hermione’s sake — or under her orders, though I hope that’s not the case — but I think it’s time we stopped pretending you’re not stalking me.”
Harry felt dreadful when he realised that Ron was going to be so disappointed.
“I should go; I’ve taken up far too much of your time. Please, I can see myself out,” he said. “I wanted to apologise, that’s all. I didn’t mean to stir all of this up.” He stood awkwardly, and Mrs Malfoy stood as well. Harry’s desire to be elsewhere was so strong that for a moment he fancied he was going to disapparate by accident again. Merlin, but he needed to work on his involuntary magic.
“Is he getting better?”
“Er,” he said. Like a fucking idiot.
“Really? That was what it looked like. For years.”
Blaise gripped Draco’s shoulder.
Harry said nothing, guilt gnawing at his gut.
“He’s my Mind Healer. Was, anyway. That’s all there is to it. All there can be. All there ever should be. He’s come a long way, ‘Mione. He’s a good man doing good work and he doesn’t — he’s good. I don’t —”
“You know I’m gay,” he said, abruptly and too loudly.
“Stop trying to use legilimency on the paper, Draco, it’s very vulgar.”
His trunks set themselves in place, ready to be unpacked.
Harry seemed only too pleased to oblige. The name-changing joke had been running for almost two years, at this point, but Draco quite enjoyed it. “You know if we’re not fifteen minutes early, Molly Weasley will probably box both of our ears,” he said. “I’d rather like to avoid that.”
Harry was absorbed in a book over breakfast. He had taken to reading because it made him eat more slowly, and he hated the way Draco still eyed him sometimes, looking to see if Harry would curl his arm protectively around his plate. Even if they were getting along well, there was a part of Harry that regretted, terribly, having told Draco about his childhood. It meant there would always be one big exposed nerve there, even if he trusted Draco not to poke at it.
“Oh,” Harry said. “Living? I seem to remember that for years, your idea of living was swanning around drunk on the society pages of the Daily Prophet, in and out of people’s beds and flashing your money around. Not something that appeals greatly to me.”
“You’re procrastinating. Have you any idea why?”
with. No strings, no stupid attachments, no garbage childhood resentments, no war — I have people I go out with and eat dinner with and get drunk with and sleep with and they know who I am. They haven’t created some kind of fucking…”
“Certainly not. We have more class than that. Imagine a nice dinner somewhere. Pansy knows all the best restaurateurs in Dublin. Muggle and Wizard alike.”
And every time they moved, their shoulders would brush, or their legs, and once Harry caught Draco’s ankle with his own and gave him such a heated look of
“No, thank you,” Draco said. More like the old Draco, polite to adults (and in front of adults) than the version who had broken Harry’s nose only a few months ago. “I don’t use magic anymore.”
And then he was gone.
He was relieved to find Draco quiet and reserved. It meant that for a little while at least he could pretend he didn’t remember anything of the last few months; and he didn’t know the date but the flowers outside the window told him in no uncertain terms that it had, indeed, been months.
“Did you mean what you said?” Draco asked.
He signed some autographs, his face hot and his voice strangled, starting to feel claustrophobic as the group around him got bigger, and he hoped he wouldn’t hear the next day in the Prophet that he’d been rude to them when he eventually made a hasty escape. Merlin, it was embarrassing. And it was hard to reason with people. They saw him a particular way, and he couldn’t begrudge them that; he only wished it wasn’t so very, very different to the way he saw himself. And he wished that he was allowed to mourn in his own way, without people telling him he must be
“I thought we might go out to dinner,” Draco said.
“What’s the hurry?” she asked. “Not that I’m complaining, I’ve been asking you to come in for a diagnostic on your magic for weeks, now. But why today?”
Was that all he needed to say?
“You can explore tomorrow,” Draco said, kindly but firmly, and steered Harry toward a staircase.
“I always thought you and she…”
He held Harry’s gaze for a minute, for two. Harry searched his face for something — Draco couldn’t guess what. A sneer, a sprinkle of mockery, a pinch of cruelty.
in love with you.” His voice was rough with desire, almost husky. “But you —”
“I’ll take some bottles to Poppy,” Harry said.
“I told her I would be delighted,” Harry said, finishing his last piece of sausage. “Now, if you’ll both excuse me —”
"You weren't here, but we needed it. We didn't want to disturb you. Pom says you haven't been sleeping. Blaise said he could, and we tried to stop him, but he locked the door. We blasted it, the lock, tried to get in, and something fell. The baby—"
Draco wanted to cry. He wanted to roll his eyes and he wanted to cry. "Shut up Harry, and get away while you can. This will destroy the machine."
Luckily it seemed she did as she walked over mere seconds before Severus was sure Alex would have patted his ass.
Besides, before he had the time to picture his destination in mind, Piper was already in front of him, jabbing a surprisingly sharp finger into his chest.
Piper huffed, "This is what I was trying to tell you. Wyatt is missing and you two," she pointed fiercely at the white lighters," were nowhere to be found. I had to ask Spike for help and he just laughed and said, 'no worries, love.'"
"Never had a demon explode on you before?"
"There, there, pet. You'll be fine and well in a minute. Just rest here while I go find someone to bring you up to the-Oh, hey Harry," the blond said as he stood, nearly bumping into Harry.
Paige opened her mouth to scream again when her lanky nephew interrupted.
Deciding it really wasn't worth it to get worked up, Paige shrugged into her 'really fat day' purple jogging suit and headed downstairs, almost turning around when she heard Piper shouting in the living room.
"We never sent it Harry. Blaise tried to make it but there was an explosion. Severus was… Severus was hurt, and Blaise. If it hadn't been for Malfoy and his friends, they'd be dead. Snape might still—"
"That makes sense. And I'm sure the fact that Hermione would kill you if she knew has no bearing on the matter."
"Look, what is going on? You," she said, waving the remains of her ham and Swiss pointedly at the blond "Are you here to attack anybody?"
At the same time he saw the room, everyone in it saw him and Draco. Alex and Spike began whistling while Hermione was yelling for them to 'do it,' and 'take it off.' Her part-time job at The Meat Market had shown a marked effect on her normally sensible behavior. Finally the girl dissolved into giggles, as did most of the others and Harry burst into a fiery red blush as Draco pressed his face into his neck.
"Well how can I resist such an offer," he said, taking one of the bags and together they orbed away.
"I don't want a lifetime with Harry."
And that was exactly how the brunette phrased it.
And with that the brunet grabbed Draco's arm and before Harry could say anything both men disappeared in a shower of sparks.
"I didn't mean to. I was just so angry. I mean he said he was leaving and he couldn't come back, but he can."
In the midst of the war Harry tried to keep Paige's words in mind. He was more than the tool of some prophecy. He was Harry Potter, regular eighteen year old boy. Yes, he was fighting a battle, and he was an integral part f it, but he wouldn't let it consume him. Not anymore.
Now it was just a question of time.
Lucius looked up and saw Pomphrey, the nurse he had assigned to his son's care. To see her here brought into reality that this boy before, the image of his late queen, was their son, his son, and the last remnant of Narcissa on Earth.
Spike had the same smile and the resemblance was striking. Xander seemed to notice as well and he pulled Spike closer in his arms, his eyes softening as he looked at the still-crying whitelighter.
Severus grabbed a robe from his desk and threw it on over his muggle jeans and sweater, and followed the red-headed girl to his labs.
He made it across the courtyard and into the kitchen before he was stopped.
"Ah, nephew. You can't take it so hard. My XanPet broke my heart a hundred times and look how happy we are."
Blue eyes were piercing, "He came here to help you people. And all you've done is harass him, or molest him," this remark aimed at Phoebe, who squawked indignantly.
Sobering quickly in the heavy atmosphere, Chris turned to the group and said, "What happened?"
Severus's face was flushed pink with the pin and frustration, but he nodded in agreement and Harry dragged Draco out of the bedroom and into the living room, this time settling on the couch and pulling the blond to a seat next to him
Severus had been trying for the past year to get the other soldiers of the light to address him by his proper name. It came easier to some of them than others.
And by the way, Godfather," Draco said with a smirk, "You will be explaining to me why you're complicit in the creation of a new generation of Weasleys."
Harry grinned up at the man and Draco looked at the green eyed boy more carefully. He was dressed in regular clothing, but studying him more carefully Draco now saw a small crest on his shirt sleeve and above that a small crown. This was the prince. This was the prince of Gryffindor.
Paige tucked her emergency kit in the pocket of her robe and moved towards the two men.
Paige blushed again; her elbow had slipped against the vampires ribs and hit something infinitely more vulnerable, and not too much lower down.
Ron, who had been dragged along as well, pushed past Harry. "Blaise? Baby, are you okay? Is it—Merlin, is it the baby?"
When he came back,
Just before the rush of Post owls were due to arrive Draco staggered into the Hall. This was actually a change. The blond-haired Slytherin had strutted, stalked, slinked, and sometimes just plain walked in, but this is the first time he'd staggered in, late and disordered. Smooth black robes that usually swung and settled around him like the wings of a bird were crumpled and disordered like dead leaves. His hair, tossed out of place, was almost as messy as Harry's own, and purple bags stood out under the grey eyes, visible from across the room.
But at the same time, could he trust Alex? Alex, Harry's boss, could have been trusted with the information but would never have asked. Alex the monster was an unknown quantity.
Walking in, he felt the rush of memories over his skin, "Draco? Love, are you here?"
Harry was happy Hermione was doing all of the talking. Ron always looked at him queerly when he brought up the blond Slytherin.
Following a nudge on the shoulder from Chris, she saw their target, the man they had been searching for, sitting on the floor against one of the walls. Eyes open and staring at nothing,
Ginny nodded firmly, "Then they sent it. Snape must have gotten better wherever they took him and finished making it.
"Never mind. We know what happened, Alex was nice enough to call us. Why didn't you say something before you went to the park. We could have sent someone to watch out for you or at least we would have known where you were."
, and he didn’t have time to think about Draco, or parties, or anything at all.
“We were going to visit Number Twelve,” he said. “Yesterday. I think I’m ready. Do you still want to come? I really don’t mind going alone.”
“You did the right thing. Even when it was idiotic. Even when it was dangerous or illegal. You weren’t following a thousand years of Pureblood law and honouring the commands of your father,” he said, with some weight, hoping that one day, this might be a conversation they could have more seriously. “I hated you. But you were my hero.”
Hermione and Ron shared another look. Harry pretended not to notice.
“He shouldn’t be closed to
A moment later, two elves appeared behind him. One wore a smart blue dress, and the other, a grimy old pillowcase. Harry smiled at them both, still confused, but deeply grateful. He
“Your definition of light duties would probably frighten the hair off most people’s heads, so I won’t ask.” Draco looked at his book again, but he couldn’t even pretend to read, now. He reached for his bookmark, a pretty, embroidered thing that a patient had given him, with a tree on it that changed as the seasons passed. Right now, it was looking rather optimistically summery, ready for the flowers to become fruit. He tossed the book onto the coffee table.
Draco nodded. “Children soak up prejudice like tiny sponges, just as easily as they soak up favourite Quidditch teams and poor grammar.”
He wasn’t expecting Granger to join them, but there she was. They’d booked a snug. By the time Granger arrived, briefly wearing a Glamour so she could get across the room without being jumped by her constituency, Draco was on his third Firewhiskey and feeling no pain.
Harry relaxed. They made breakfast and read the paper. No real news, there never really was, but eventually, Harry found the crossword, and that was enough to stay occupied for a while.
So it was at sunrise that Hermione and Blaise apparated a mile from the wards of Malfoy Manor. Hermione frowned.
Draco flashed an expression that brought to mind a much younger Draco battling his desire to preen. He sipped from his water glass, and dabbed at his mouth with a napkin.
“Your
So he did, and they talked, and Harry almost leapt from the bed when Draco summoned Rubino to bring them a small antipasto platter. “I wasn’t serious about snacks!” he cried.
“Madam?”
“The castle
Except… well, this was the problem, wasn’t it? For twenty years, when Hermione had asked how he was, he’d always said he was fine, and he’d never been fine. He’d kept his secrets, and protected her from worrying, and protected himself from feeling vulnerable or needing to cheer her up after he’d been honest. And it was bollocks. He never felt burdened when she told him about things being difficult; why would she feel any different?
“Do the houses mix, much?” Harry asked Malfoy, at lunch. There was a little splash of colour here or there, but for the most part, the houses still sat in their rows, oldest students at the back where teachers wouldn’t have to listen to them lie about their sexual conquests, youngest students at the front so the teachers could watch for any homesickness.
“So then, one day last year as the weather was getting colder, I… I needed a day off. I don’t know how long it had been since I’d really had one. Probably back when I’d been sneaking a Portkey all the way to Italy when I had time. Perhaps sometimes I had a day where I wasn’t as busy and I could finally get around to doing things I’d promised other people I would do, but not… a day
“Yes,” she said, carefully placing the wand back in the box. “I do hope your friend is alright, Mr Potter.”
“Yes, thank you,” Harry lied. “And you?”
devoid of fingers,” he sighed. “You know I was a Death Eater, Harry. I do like a finger or two. Cured in salt and smoked with rosemary —”
“Happily ever after?”
It happened, sometimes. He loved the dungeons, loved sitting by his window and looking out into the green hues of the lake, the fish and tiny sea monsters that made it their home; he loved how safe and enclosed it all felt. But from time to time he felt suddenly oppressed by all of that, and he needed, on those days, to fly.
“Please don’t. I’m still a Slytherin, Harry. We’re like cats. It’s never a good idea to point it out when we do something less than dignified.”
Harry missed the tattoos right away.
The first time the bell over the door rang Harry’s heart began to race, his pulse almost painful in his throat, certain that it was Draco escaping; but it wasn’t. It was an older woman whom Harry had met several times; she had been a political correspondent for the Prophet, until she had retired to write romance novels. She was very good at it.
“The stasis spells can only do so much,” Draco said, quietly. He folded the sheet down and cast a quick spell over Harry’s pyjama top, exposing his chest. Hermione felt herself tense, but Draco seemed to ignore it, reaching for a pot of some sort of potion for Harry’s skin. He was gentle, almost fond, taking his time, massaging it into Harry’s chest and neck carefully before moving to his arms and hands. Hermione only watched.
“Ouch,” Draco replied drily. “Never mind, then.” His smile was brisk, and professional. “I thought you might like to stay at my villa. I have a tower guest room with a view over the water. Plenty of books, access to the hospital via the Floo — I think I need to engage someone else to be your Healer, from now on, but I think it’s a good option.” He raised his hand. “I can hear you, you know, thinking so loudly — oh, Malfoy, I couldn’t possibly impose; oh, Malfoy, I know a Healer in Britain who owes me and will sign off on me going back to work, wouldn’t you prefer I got out from under your feet? Oh, Malfoy — blah blah fucking blah Chosen One needs to get back to work.”
“I was talking about pureblood nonsense,” Andromeda replied. “And I never taught him to extrapolate.”
“But something to do with my days. Something constructive. It’s too easy to get caught up in my head; d’you know what I mean? She told me to find a new challenge, something to do with my hands and my magic. Something I’d be proud of in the end. I don’t know what, though.”
. He was playing a part, yes.
Draco nodded. “I said terrible things to Ron, when we were children. Called him poor. I’ve never been in a house like that. With people like that.”
“Actually, I won’t. You don’t know my mum, do you, Harry?” He didn’t, except by reputation. “There’s a very good chance you’d end up my next stepfather.”
and back again, insensible. Hands tangled in Harry’s hair, controlling his head, which was also all kinds of hot. Apparently, they were going to take a similar approach to sex as they always had to Quidditch. Competitive and snarky.
It didn’t take the band very long to get set up again, after what must have been a sound check earlier. Harry cast a mild, wandless Muffliato just so his eardrums wouldn’t pop, and sipped his chocolate stout.
There was a question in Harry’s tone.
Harry nodded, and stared out the window again.
What possessed him to do it, Draco would never know — but he reached across Harry’s back, and settled a hand on his shoulder, and gave a small squeeze. Harry either barely noticed, or (and this was what Draco hoped for) didn’t mind. Maybe liked it.
, if we were in love, a happy couple sharing a life. What we’d say to each other. If I couldn’t sleep, or in the morning after I’d slept badly, I might lie with my eyes closed and imagine waking up with him. What he’d smell like, how we’d touch each other. I liked it. Sometimes it felt a lot more real than the hours that I spent as an Auror. I’d dream about it, as well. Wake up with a smile on my face, instead of… well.”
Draco reached for a strawberry, and carefully twisted out the stem.
“You’ve never in all the years I’ve known you shown a single shred of interest in a woman. It seemed like a fair bet.” Emrys looked over the water. “Relationships that develop out of a therapeutic arrangement… don’t end well,” he said, cautiously. “But they end
He paused for a long moment. He could sign off, but this letter barely counted as a letter, and his mother would immediately know that he was holding something back.
“At least once more,” Harry said, with an earnest nod. “Is there something I can do for you?”
Cleaning the pipes had clearly been an excellent idea; Harry thought he might be able to go forever, like this, his spine melting into lava and Draco’s mouth bobbing over him like he was starving. Without looking up, Draco held his hand out, slapping Harry’s hand away when Harry tried to take it.
Harry didn’t think he could ever be a parent. He’d had no good role models. But he thought that he had the knack of being a Godfather down quite well, having known Sirius for at least a few years. Teddy seemed to have no complaints, and nor did Hugo or Rose.
Draco nodded. “I know that. When someone hands you two different types of poison, and tells you that you can choose which one to take, it’s not much of a choice at all, is it?”
“No need to ask where you’re going,” Hermione said smugly. “Those are your
When he woke the next morning, Harry was instantly tense. Noises in the house. Not the cat. In soft grey sleep pants and not another stitch, his glasses askew on his face and his wand in hand (offensive spells he could easily cast wandlessly; defensive spells, for some reason, were still easier with a wand), Harry opened his bedroom door.
“Very impressive,” Mrs Malfoy said, and sipped her tea. “I use strong wards, and many of them are ancient, tied to the family lines. There are still people who would use any weakness in them to enter the grounds and do me harm. Or hurt my home. She’s still recovering from the occupation, of course.”
And then, because he was selfish, and because hope had stayed, and because Draco had no idea how long it would be before he knew what might happen next, he kissed Harry’s forehead, before leaving him to rest and closing the door silently behind him.
“Potter,” he said,
Draco calling him
Topher frowned. “Yes. No!” He pulled a bottle of Firewhiskey from the pantry, and Summoned a couple of mugs. He seemed a bit more real, suddenly, and Ron felt himself relaxing. “Honestly, it’s been a rough few weeks and I fancy a drink. You’ll join me, right?”
“My son was a petty, spiteful child, and then… trapped in a situation he had no way to escape. He did the only thing he thought he could do, embracing the image of the young terror, strutting around with his Mark hidden under his robes, talking about how we would usher in a new world. But he is a good man. He has been a good man for many years. I’d like you to try to remember that, Harry.”
With a burst of desperate humiliation and precise intention he was back in his too well-decorated chamber almost before Draco could register that he had left. He sat on the edge of his bed for a long time, fighting the urge to punch himself in the face.
Teddy made a mournful expression. “Mr Fortes— Forks—“ he bit his lip. “Mr
“I’m going to take you upstairs,” he said, and apparated them both as gently as he could to one of the spare rooms.
“I’d pay a million Galleons to know you cried my name out when you were done,” Harry growled, smiling wolfishly. “Loud enough so all the other Slytherins wanted to beat themselves unconscious.”
“Are you sure?” Hermione asked. “I mean — you can’t really be sure, can you? He seemed so different. I keep thinking of him sitting on your couch with that deer-in-headlights look, wearing your cardigan…”
“We could decorate in here, if you like,” Harry said, delicately.
“Sounds like the sort of law only a complete swot would make up,” Draco said with a snort, easing himself down to sit cross-legged on the floor in front of the fireplace with a second mug of tea.
“No, I love it,” Harry said. Mad-Eye Mooney’s foe glass didn’t work well anymore, occluded with white fog. “It’s not — I just mean. Do you think we’re broken?”
. Because I hope he’ll wake up, I swear I do, I know you love him, and I know Draco
“There’s a memory Healer Black can’t get to,” Hermione said, pushing her plate aside. The burgers had sounded like a top idea, in the beginning, but now, she was remembering why she didn’t eat them very often. “I need your help, Ron. Something is missing from the list. The timeline.” She pointed gently at it, and didn’t miss the way Ron tore his eyes away from the sight as quickly as he could.
Draco spent a long time — much too long — writing in the journal he had begun to think of as
Harry was powerful. Few knew exactly
“We were at school together,” was all she said, but Draco flicked his eyes up and Parvati looked sad.
“Yes, I do. But I have you. I rest. We take holidays together, Blaise, and not to a dragon sanctuary in Romania. Harry doesn’t have a home — have you ever really thought about that?”
“Mr Malfoy — Mr Potter has too kind a heart. Can you tell the Wizengamot, under Veritaserum, whether you recognised your classmate at that time?”
“He knows how to play it,” Arthur marvelled. “Can you believe that, Molly?”
“Let’s go back to not talking about it,” Harry said, sitting gingerly as if he was afraid that wild magic of his might tear the lovely old couch to pieces. “You can tell me about that ring of yours.”
“I dare you,” Draco said. “I dare you to ask Luna Lovegood out for a proper date.”
“Apparently not,” Harry said. The smoke was getting worse. He cast
Draco didn’t look at him. He sipped his tea, instead, and glanced at the breakfast tray. Harry might have wondered if he was about to say something rude about the service here (which would be ideal, as it would give Harry the opportunity to toss him out on his lily-white arse) but a moment’s consideration suggested something else. Draco was starving hungry, ravenous: he just didn’t think he could eat.
A long time.
“Draco,” he said, as Draco zipped up the front of his hoodie.
“You feel so good,” Harry murmured, and pressed his lips to Draco’s, shifting to his neck. He tasted clean sweat and skin, arousal, he smelled herb tea and something a little citric, orange hair potions maybe, a rich patina of scents and tastes that Harry planned to map.
Harry shook his head. “No, I want — I’m probably going to do this all wrong, but I’m going to try, if you can indulge me.” He hesitated. “Actually, I think you should know that I’ve been seeing a Mind Healer for a while, now. And it’s been good.”
Or maybe he didn’t think he could eat that.
“Ron?” she said, kindly.
Mostly, he wanted to marry him. He wanted Harry sodding Potter, Gryffindor git and all-around speccy wanker, the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, with his reckless power and his terrible childhood under the stairs to be his partner and his husband. To share their rooms in the Castle. To go to sleep with him and wake up with him and press behind him when Harry made tea. To bend Harry over his own desk and fuck him ruthlessly until Harry was sobbing and babbling; to hook his legs over Harry’s shoulders on their wedding night.
appreciative noises.”
Draco wanted to take Harry’s face between his hands. He wanted so
. “And Snape —”
What a
She was still utterly tongue-tied but her eyes were wide and bright, and colour tinted her cheeks.
“Your interest in girls has never been especially notable,” Snape drawled.
“Good girl,” Hermione said, scratching the back of her neck. Persephone was a beautiful owl. She closed her eyes and hooted softly, nibbled gently at Hermione’s finger, and flew to her perch to eat in peace.
In the meantime, Harry began a chant, under his breath. The curse was unwilling to cooperate, digging in harder, but little by little he began to pull something that looked like a plant — some kind of kelp — out of Malfoy’s arm.
Harry burned red, and covered his face with his hands. “I’m sorry.”
Harry actually smiled at that. “I’m glad to hear it, Auror Bones. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“Yes,” Hermione said, flustered. “And you’re clear on your cover story?”
It read. As if Harry was concerned that somebody else might find the note. He didn’t want to read it. He wanted to throw the sodding thing into the fireplace. But he read on.
“Harry Potter,” Draco said. “Are you honestly trying to explain that you’re not
“It was. Maybe I’ll see you around again some time.”
“What can I help you with, Harry?” she asked, and she really
Draco let out a tortured moan, and seemed to collapse in on himself. Harry had no choice but to catch him, ease him to the ground, wrap arms around him.
your name?” She smiled wickedly, and hurried her cousin out the door.
“Two in particular,” he mumbled in reply. “I don’t suppose there is anything that
“Now, off you go to lunch,” Harry said. “And don’t imagine for a second that anyone who is not doing well in my class will be allowed to participate.”
Harry reached out, and settled his hand on Draco’s knee. Draco tensed, and relaxed, and seemed to slump. A little, and then a lot; he unfolded himself and dropped his cheek onto Harry’s thigh, letting Harry run a hand over his spiky hair. It felt so strange, and so right, and Harry felt his heart race and then slow again. The sky brightened from black to dark blue, and then the beginnings of purple crept into the shadows.
Draco didn’t look away from his book. And yet.
“How do you want me to take care of you, Harry?”
Harry hadn’t been expecting to go home, of course. Couldn’t bring a Muggle one-night stand back to Grimmauld Place without obliviating him afterwards and that just seemed so
“You’re getting along fine with Ron and Ginny, and Hermione is quite fond of you, these days.”
So — nightmares.
Harry tensed, suddenly. One of the seemingly empty portraits on the wall had shimmered slightly.
Ugh, terrible. Appalling.
Harry bristled. “I see Malfoy has been telling tales.”
“Well, then, I guess that’s why I let you in.”
As if it was a fucking burden. Draco felt a familiar rock in his throat.
When he went to Diagon Alley in the morning, Ollivander’s was closed. He asked at Flourish and Blott’s and the proprietor there said that Ollivander’s health had been failing, and he preferred to take appointments, these days. Harry groaned. He felt badly for Ollivander, he did; he was a kind man, and he had helped in the war when he was needed. But Harry needed a wand. He paused too long in Diagon Alley, and was spotted.
Not long after he arrived, Neville pushed a brown paper bag into Harry’s arms, blushing.
Harry was just relieved that their conversation the night before hadn’t left any awkwardness to float around between them. “Yes, please. Because I am so intrigued, and also, really fucking hungry. You’re up early,” he said.
“Dreamless sleep?” he asked, as if the list could be for anything else. Of course it was for dreamless sleep; Potter was looking as enchanting as ever, with his eyes that ridiculous emerald green, and his hair sticking up in the back, and a jawline that could only be described as patrician. But the shadows under his eyes were very telling. “I usually have some on hand, but after last week’s accident with the boggart in Ravenclaw Tower, a number of first and second year students had rather urgent need for it. I should have prepared some more.”
“You sound like a fucking press conference.” Hermione got to her feet, frustration written all over her face, in bouncing curls and a square jaw and lips pressed into a thin line. “Can you just be Harry Potter for a couple of hours? Will you listen to Draco, Harry?”
“Oh, fuck,” he said. “I think… ‘Mione, I must be misreading this.” He passed her the front page, and his eyes went very wide as he took in the second.
dramatic.”
“Oh,” he said. “I hadn’t given it much thought. That Muggle café near your school with the brilliant steak and mushroom pies?”
She sighed. “I would like very much for you to start calling me Narcissa, but I have long since stopped believing in miracles.” She was silent for a while, leading Harry into store after store and finding nothing that interested her. Harry purchased gifts for the Weasleys, and Hermione, for Teddy and Andromeda.
Ron snorted. “That’s too advanced for ickle firsties like us,” he said glumly. “Really, help defeat a Dark Lord and they don’t even cut you the smallest break. Harry’s not allowed anywhere but theory classes until he has a wand they’re all satisfied with.”
Draco had already seen the thin mattress than had been shrunk down to the size of a novel and placed on a shelf. He wondered who had done that. Maybe they didn’t like the idea of anyone knowing that this was where he’d gone to sleep, on his day off, and never returned.
“You’re a superb Healer, Draco,” he said, forcing himself to meet Draco’s eyes. “I think… I think I would have died.”
“Er.” Harry wasn’t sure he could call her by her name, but he vowed to try, as uncomfortable as he was. “Is there something I can help you with, Mrs — Narcissa?”
Salazar damn her, she might just have been onto something.
Mrs Malfoy waved the concern away. “They are untouched. Draco, on the other hand…”
“Viktor Krum, Fleur Delacour, and Cedric Diggory. And Cedric won, of course, he’s brilliant.”
Excitement came, and he thanked it for its optimism, and then he let it go.
Draco raised his eyebrows, daring Blaise to argue with him, but Blaise’s expression only softened into a warm smile.
And there had been the trials. Harry had refused the offer of a place on the Wizengamot because he thought he was too young to be determining the fates of people he knew, or didn’t know. And he wasn’t sure how he could ever be impartial.
! Are you not a wandmaker, and a powerful Wizard? What is this all about?”
“Naturally. Also makes me want to poke you in the eye with my wand.”
Hermione nodded, tears burning her eyes. Draco stood and crossed the room to fetch her a handkerchief, smiling kindly before he eased himself onto the settee beside her.
“Oh, now I know you’re pissed off with me. You only call me Potter when you’re pissed off with me. Time will fly, Draco. It’ll be Christmas before you know it.” The three of them stood on the platform, watching the train disappear, surrounded by parents who look sad and relieved and worried all at once. The Leaky Cauldron would be full to bursting tonight. “And I’m sure that on average Hufflepuff is a much safer house than either Gryffindor or Slytherin.”
“A deer in headlights.”
Draco bristled.
The whisker was gone.
“I forgot how… he has a lot of scars,” she said quietly. “I suppose these days I don’t see him without a shirt on all that often.”
He knew he should leave. Which was the main reason he decided to act before he could chicken out.
“You win.” He shrugged. “Did you see my kitten?”
“I sometimes think I’ve seen some of his legs,” she said, surprised and pleased. “I see seahorses a lot, though. They’re so sweet, the way they gallop along in groups, with their green manes flying. And the baby Grindylows, until their parents come to chase them home. And when the weather is warm you sometimes hear the mermaids sing, did you know that?”
“When did you stop being able to talk to me, Harry?” Hermione said.
The guilelessness of the very young was charming, always, but Harry’s heart clenched tight at the memory of Hedwig, falling lifelessly, and —… he closed his eyes.
“I’ve got an idea,” Ron said, moody. “Build us a tree house so we can get away from things.”
Draco smiled, and crossed the sitting room, gesturing at the fireplace to fan the flames before he sat down on the edge of the couch. But he didn’t touch Harry, and he didn’t lean to kiss him, either, and Harry’s entire body ached for it. “How are you?” he asked Harry, and took Harry’s hand.
“Harry has constructed a world in his mind. It is very consistent. It is very secure. And he doesn’t want to leave. Every attempt that I have made to work against his wishes has resulted in some catastrophe or another. I am pushed out of his head, I am attacked by a basilisk. He has doors in the house which he has sealed closed in various ways and until I can find a way to get him to talk about them I am completely stuck. It’s been a month since you brought him to Naples, Hermione, and the only real progress I’ve made is figuring out some of the reasons he doesn’t want me to make any progress.”
magic. And this book is why.”
“Your dress is very pretty,” Harry said, surprised that she was wearing one at all. “Happy Christmas, Lissie.”
Over Draco’s life, he’d often heard people describe therapy — particularly those rare and terrible moments of clarity — as painful. Yes, this was it. A moment of clarity forced into his psyche. Harry Potter wasn’t the only man who would be changed by this.
That painted a picture. “You’ve heard them before?”
Malfoy was sitting up, if not very straight. “But where are your things?”
, Merlin’s bollocks.”
Nope. Never trying that again.
“It’s fine.” Draco sounded sad, and Hermione couldn’t help but hear both meanings. It’s fine;
“It’s a nice old house. Feels like it’s been asleep a while. It used to communicate a lot better.”
After that, Draco was painfully cordial.
“What’s November 1
“But you are, you idiot. You are the most Gryffindor person to ever walk this earth, Harry Potter, and I need you to summon up the last of your courage and wake up. Just a little bit more, Harry. And then I’ll lock the doors. I’ll tell Hermione you need a
“So,” she said, with no preamble. “Will you do it?”
“I think I’d believe it, actually,” she said. “What’s your secret?”
“I suppose,” Draco said. “Or —”
“I’m dessert tonight,” Harry said, and he pulled two of Draco’s fingers into his mouth. Draco snickered at him, but then, very annoyingly, he wrestled Harry to his feet. Standing there in front of the fire, in his home, with Draco’s hands cupping his face, Harry should only have felt safe and happy, but something stirred deep in his stomach.
Harry winced.
Draco felt slightly ill. He had worked so hard not to be suspicious of everyone he ever met. How the fuck had he… but he kept his mouth closed.
like.”
Half an hour later, they were back at Draco’s work counter, and Draco was offering small pieces of advice as Harry prepared the ingredients — he was so slow at it, and Draco wanted to be frustrated. But he would look at the intense concentration on Harry’s face, and the shadows under his eyes, and remember telling him he was rubbish at potions and just like that he’d find himself speaking quietly, soothingly instead, as if he was helping little Amelia, and not the Boy Who Lived, Scourge of Dark Wizards, highest ranked Auror of his age in over three centuries.
The first best thing was taking Rose into his arms. She was much smaller than Hugo had been, but no less interested in the world. Hermione had been right (really, when wasn’t she?) and Rose’s skin was as dark as Hermione’s, and her hair was red, though not a Weasley red — it was rich and dark and stuck out in all angles, curling this way and that. She was also significantly sleepier than Hugo had been at her age, content to nap on anyone as long as she wasn’t poked too much.
And then Harry descended the stairs, a little shaky, still very pale, but alive and awake.
. It’s alright, Draco. I’ll figure it out for myself.”
“So your sainted grandmother wants you to ask Luna Lovegood out on a date?”
, instead of… because of the stupid scar on my forehead.” He closed his eyes. He looked younger, for a moment. Unburdened, perhaps. Resolved, certainly.
The Hog’s Head was quiet; it was never as full as the Three Broomsticks, but also, the night was cold, and Hogsmeade was quiet in general. Harry spent a few minutes speaking with Aberforth, and, in possession of two pints of Abner’s Ale and two chasers of a rather lovely, almost ruby-coloured firewhiskey, he took a seat at the table Neville had chosen, close to the fireplace.
Harry tried to take him aside after breakfast, several days later, but Draco jovially explained that he was Very Busy. Apparently he was Very Busy every day. Not too busy for Duelling Club, which was nice; but he was cheerful in a way that never reached his eyes, and never gleeful, never tossing an insult or showing off for the students.
“I can help,” Harry promised. No, he didn’t just say; he
,” Draco said, suddenly alarmed to have Hermione’s arms around him. Hermione’s arms? The Minister for Magic’s arms? A Gryffindor’s arms? “Granger? Hermione? I’m not sure this is the time. You can give me a hug when you’ve paid my bill,” Draco said.
“Do they mean anything?”
Harry slipped his fingers under his glasses and rubbed his eyes, set the wand down by the television. “I must have missed your owl.”
He shrugged as he sat down.
“You’ve been obsessed with Draco Malfoy for almost as long as I’ve known you,” Hermione said, wistfully. “Perhaps not always for good reasons. I hear he has become a good man, though. Are you really so frightened?”
“I want you to fuck me, Draco. Hard. I want you... I want you to hold me down and make me feel it. I want you to bite my shoulder, and whisper in my ear. Take me out of my head, Draco,” Harry begged, even as Draco pulled back, to kneel on the bed, hooking Harry’s legs over his thighs, exposing that hungry little hole of his.
“I see. Why?”
“Potter,” Draco said. “You remember my mother.”
“I suppose we’re officially adults,” Ron said. “It’s not really the… turning seventeen thing.”
about this? I thought we’d agreed to
every
“Harry!” he said. “Are you… can you…”
“Tell me about our first kiss,” Draco said, and Harry didn’t really feel like it but there was nothing quite like being the sole focus of Draco Malfoy’s affection.
“I can’t believe I didn’t know. I wondered… he only ever brushed those questions away, or… and Dumbledore gave him to them, and…”
. Oh, Draco. I don’t want to see this.”
The bench in Regent’s Park where Blaise was now sitting was the same one he had been sitting on that night that he heard his calling. One he had often returned to when he needed to think. He didn’t expect anyone to join him, and no one did, save a student who sat for an hour with a textbook in her hands. She didn’t notice him. She drank a bottle of something that was a frightening lime colour and couldn’t have been very healthy. She ate an apple, and tossed the core into the lake. And she read, and Blaise thought, and she read, and Blaise kept thinking.
the Potions Master,” he said drily, as he assembled everything on a tray.
“I’ve been thinking about the nature of longing,” Blaise said. “You know, I’m not supposed to talk about my work at all.” He didn’t bother to say that he trusted Harry not to share this. “It’s interesting — longing involves love and time, and that is an unusually complicated relationship. I shan’t bore you.”
He made his way downstairs to the kitchen to make himself a cup of coffee. Harry drank about a thousand cups of tea a day, but he still preferred coffee in the mornings, and the Muggle coffee machine that Hermione had enchanted to work without electricity made an excellent brew. He didn’t bother with sugar or milk, just brought his mug to the dining table and reached for the next folder on the pile.
He remembered the potion Madam Pomfrey had given him that year — not all the time, she’d warned it was addictive and could cause an eventual decline into madness, but in the worst times she’d given him at least a little. In his early years as an Auror he’d fallen back onto the stuff when times were especially difficult. But in the years since, he’d learned to get by; he’d wake up drenched in sweat and tell himself over and over again that it was a nightmare, that he was safe, that none of his traps had gone off and he was alone in his bedroom at Grimmauld Place, or the flat he often used in the ministry building if he’d worked too late.
“Indeed.” He sighed. “If it will make you feel any safer, I could remind you that I owe you rather a number of life-debts. If you’d like, you can collect on one by asking me to refrain from poisoning you. Forever, if you like, or if that’s too tedious a commitment we could say until you retire from Hogwarts? We could take up our blood feud again as old men.” Potter looked distinctly uncomfortable about that, and less than inclined to ask questions about it, but Draco resolved to make sure he understood the concept, sooner rather than later.
Once he was presentable, he summoned the Healers that would take care of Harry’s physical needs and spoke to them for a few minutes about the dehydration, Harry’s weakening muscles, and ordered some more of the potion for his skin. Legs, this afternoon, he thought, before he slipped back into Harry’s dream. But for now, he had notes to take and a light meal to linger over. He needed time to think, and time to meditate, and time to plan.
“That’s implied by the prefix ‘tri’. Now fuck off out of my room or I’ll throw you out the window.”
“Flattery will get you nowhere. I know we don’t have our appointment until late this afternoon, but I wanted you to think about something before then.”
Draco rolled over, and pressed against Harry’s body, in a gesture that suggested he wasn’t prepared to have that conversation yet. He bit Harry’s bottom lip, and sucked it into his mouth. Harry shivered, and rubbed his hand over Draco’s bristly head.
. This memory. But I’m going to try.”
“To be honest, I’m glad you said it that way. I was starting to think there was nothing left of the boy I knew in there,” Hermione said, with a feeble smile.
This was only the third time that Draco would experience the first night of school as a teacher, and he spent a few extra moments in his rooms adjusting his tie and smoothing down his hair. It was beginning to curl at the ends as he grew older and he let it grow longer. There was a part of him that thought his father would hate that and tell him to straighten it, but Draco didn’t mind it, in the end. Perhaps because it made it easier to look at himself in the mirror and see something other than the man he’d almost become.
“It’s for you.”
“Harry!”
On Monday morning, he had to explain to Auror Bones (apparently a distant cousin of Susan’s, and with none of her gentleness) that he did not yet have a wand.
Some of them were big and obvious; he and his mother were free to disavow his actions, and as much as Narcissa had loved Lucius she had hated him, too, especially towards the end. Draco didn’t hate to come home, anymore, even though the walls held memories of things that could never be scrubbed clean.
“There are many, many ways to help people, Mr Potter. Some of them don’t require one to put one’s life on the line every day. Perhaps you should be thinking further afield.”
There were a lot of good things.
“Not at all.” But he drank, and he seemed impressed. “Lovely. And you were mostly right, you know. Well, you do know. It’s a disaster. And I’ve supervised Healers who fell in love with every patient they were ever attracted to — and Topher, it happens, there is no point in denying it — but I’m curious because it’s not something I’ve ever heard you so much as hint at. You have a satisfying sex life, am I right?”
“I — no?”
“Harry,” Draco murmured. He had to get up. He had to run diagnostic spells, and make sure that this was true sleep and that Harry was ready to come home. If he decided to wait, selfishly, to enjoy the puff of breath against his jaw and watch the jump of the pulse in Harry’s neck… well, this had been exhausting for Draco, too.
They all sat down to eat a little while later and Draco’s spine was straight, for all he was subdued and anxious-looking. Harry bumped their knees together under the table, which seemed to help. Molly was struggling, Arthur was focused on her, Ginny had absolutely no filter, Hermione was carrying the conversation and Harry was wondering if he’d made a terrible, terrible mistake.
Someone needed to do something. Say something. Break this unbelievably tight silence. And of course, it was Hermione.
“Pansy is the only person in the world who knows where I am. At least, she was, up until… what is it, now. Two months?”
“Anything,” Harry promised, slipping his hand under Draco’s t-shirt and thrilling to the way Draco whimpered in response. “We — bedroom? Please. I want to look at you.”
“Seekers do it better. At least according to Derrick.” Harry’s face burned. Draco rather enjoyed it; Harry had a number of rather excellent looks, but squirming in discomfort about his sexual history was one that Draco thought he’d like to provoke more often.
Harry wanted to help him walk back to the potions classroom and his rooms beyond, but he was too hurt, and embarrassed, and angry. So he nodded tightly, and Malfoy left.
Harry kissed her cheek, and stepped into the Floo.
didn’t need to be either of those things.”
charm at you that had you yelling at your feet? In what sounded a lot like
New Year’s Eve was a play in two acts. In the late afternoon, Harry, Hermione and Ron visited the Burrow for an early supper. Everyone who could make it was there; Ginny, about to start her final semester at school, teasing everyone with her offers to join half a dozen Quidditch teams across the country and asking Harry if he’d met a nice young man yet, and reminding him that Charlie was still single.
But he stayed silent through his robe fitting, and tried not to smile at himself in the mirror (really, he looked
Draco had come to get magic back.
He laughed. “Zouwu?”
He knew he had won when Hermione’s final Owl was nothing but a scrawled, angry face and a demand that Persephone (who was a stunning creature and welcome to grace Draco’s rooms at the hospital anytime) only be returned when Draco was satisfied that Harry was ready for a visitor.
“Just needed something to do with my hands,” Harry said, standing. He rested against the countertop and crossed his arms over his body. “Are you alright?”
“But they do. There’s nothing about you that I don’t want to know. You must know that.”
“And efficient.” Harry moved to cover Draco’s body with his own, slotting their cocks together beautifully, desperate to just rut against something. “You’re so fucking beautiful, Draco. I just want to look at you.”

“You prefer it with the lemon?” she asked.
The first few days of the rest of Harry’s life were blissfully structureless. That didn’t actually mean they were easy; in fact, Harry was starting to think that the guilt about not working, not being out
For now, though, he asked Harry why he had such a grasp on wandless and non-verbal magic.
“You don’t have your wand?” he asked, gently. Draco shook his head. He looked like he tried to sneer, as well, but failed. “I could bring you one. Or you could come down and pick one out.”
“Always so observant,” Draco muttered in a thin, reedy voice. Harry gestured at the mess, murmuring
, he always thought.
Harry was tired; he rested his hip against the bulky old chest of drawers under the window. It was magical; beautifully carved, with schools of fish dancing in the scrolled corners. He gazed at the slippers on his feet for several long moments, looking up when Draco took a tentative step toward him. Dressed in comfortable flannel pyjamas and a thick, heavy, warm robe, he’d never felt so naked. Not even in that horrifyingly realistic dream place, the inside of his head, with Draco’s lips all over him and Draco’s warm, filthy words in his ear.
“Why are you being dense?”
She didn’t want Harry back in the Department. Suddenly, Hermione hoped he’d
On Harry’s other side, Professor Bennett took her seat. Her dark curls bobbed about her face.

like that. It was exactly like that. He was mad about Draco Malfoy, and though he sincerely doubted that the feeling was mutual, he wondered now if there was a reason that Draco had shown up at his shop. His home. How had he even known where… anyway —
“Er,” Harry replied.
“I forgot how much fun that is. Do you know how ridiculous you looked, on your jelly legs?” Draco rolled over and held his head up on his hand. “The Saviour of the Wizarding world.”
“If he can ditch the creepy cloak for an hour, I’d be happy to host you here for breakfast. Seven-thirty, if you please. I have a lot of work tomorrow. And you and I need to discuss something else before you leave. Something I think Harry would prefer Blaise wasn’t present for.”
“He made a point of telling you it wasn’t sealed,” Hermione said, as she sat cross-legged on the end of the bed.
Another secluded weekend.
Ron looked genuinely baffled. “I don’t. But I’ll help you look.”
He began to rub the potion into Harry’s skin, trying not to think about the knotted scars beneath his fingers. “It doesn’t matter. I suppose it’s a numbers game, in the end. We might talk about your tendency t throw yourself into the line of fire, some day.”
“Oh,” Ron said, understanding dawning on him.
“We were talking about Harry Potter, who I am most assuredly not in love with. Did you convince him to let you cheer the place up a bit?”
“Harry? Are you alright?”
“Are you alright, Harry?” Hermione said, leaning hesitantly against the door jamb.
Harry nodded. “Yes. Otherwise, the signatures can get tangled up.” No need to tell her that a deep understanding of the function of wands had made them almost completely unnecessary for him. He raised his eyebrows. “Is it — the core. Is it the quill of a peacock feather?”
Harry realised afterwards that he should not have dropped his guard, but he did. He had a moment to reflect on the unmistakable crunch of a broken nose as Draco punched him right in the middle of his face. By the time he had regained his balance, Draco was gone.
“Thank you, Madam.”
Harry heard a commotion in the Floo, and laughed as Ron swore.
“Certainly,” Harry said, rising to his feet. “You want to start a Duelling Club.”
“You love your life, don’t you?” he asked, but it was less like a question than a wondrous understanding. “You really love your life. This shop. Your friends. Your… family. You figured things out.”
She was dressed, as always, in traditional African garb, gold and red robes which made the blackness of her skin look even richer. Harry hurried to the other side of his desk to pull a chair out for her.
“Better.” Draco sniffed.
. It’s brilliant.”
“It’s frightful out there,” Hermione said, throwing her arms around him. “How was your week?”
“I don’t want you to,” Ginny promised.
charm and Draco returned to looking smug as fuck and ready to lie around for a while.
“Oh, Harry.” She tipped her head to the side and took his hand. “I don’t know where this all came from. But even if you hadn’t saved my son’s life, along with the rest of the world… you’re perfectly adequate just as you are.”
Draco reached for his wand and wordlessly nudged the curtains the rest of the way open. “It’s beautiful all summer, if you don’t mind the heat. Beautiful all year around, really, but the beaches, and…”
”, and held her lit wand over the box. “Not as often as it used to. There are some people who will never forgive, and never try to understand. You’ve seen this particular curse before, Harry, I take it?”
“Happy Christmas, Blaise,” Harry said.
Draco nodded. He seemed slightly strained.
He didn’t need to. It was awful, the way people fawned over him, barely letting him answer a question before asking another. The young woman to his right grabbed his thigh and whispered to him that she’d been thinking of getting a tattoo of his name on her —…
“Oh, but… I haven’t tidied up,” Harry argued. Hermione looked around the spotless shop.
Harry snickered. “Maybe in the summer.”
Harry’s smile broadened.
“I wanted to be dead. I wished that something terrible would happen to me at school, that I’d be accidentally killed, because I thought that would be the only way I could escape without my parents paying the price. Do you know… in Sixth Year, I got so desperate that I almost went to Harry for help. But I convinced myself Harry would think I was weak. Throw me to the Ministry. Something.”
“I have to go, Pans. I’m not feeling well.”
“Your father was not a happy man,” she reminded him gently. “I don’t want that for you. And he didn’t have his emotions under control as much as you think. He gave in too easily to the wrong ones, mind you. Certainly I never saw him laugh until his sides ached.”
Harry nodded gravely. “I can see how important rest might be.”
Draco smiled smugly, and sipped his Firewhiskey. Harry didn’t touch his own, but a few moments later he moved to the coffee table —
He sat bolt upright, all thoughts of arousal gone. Maybe for a moment he had imagined the war; but no, there was just that one sound, and then silence. He didn’t even know where it had come from.
“The first is this. No one thinks you have time for any kind of secret life, because they cannot fathom that you spend any of your spare time not looking for their company. But despite the appalling hours that you work and your general exhaustion, you do have time to yourself that you don’t spend building homes for orphans and campaigning for the rights of Hippogriffs. And when you have time — you travel.”
Ron watched Topher’s face for a few moments.
“No,” Draco said. “You didn’t do anything wrong.”
Alaric waved in the general direction of his left forearm.
“Harry?”
And one night, when Ron had been called away on some kind of Auror business, Hermione came to visit on her own. Unscheduled. At first, Harry thought she was worried about Ron, but when she produced Thai food and beer he realised she just wanted to talk to him alone.
year. I told them there was no way to let anyone in, and for some reason, they believed me. Meant I could escape.”
Harry only flinched for a moment before he kissed Narcissa’s cool cheek. “It’s beautiful, Mrs Malfoy,” he said.
“Does it hurt?” Potter asked, and Draco didn’t feign ignorance. He turned his forearm to look at the Mark, blurred and scarred, the musculature beneath warped and twisted — his left hand hadn’t been quite the same since. Sometimes it didn’t cooperate the way it used to, his thumb failing to curl quickly enough or a sharp pain would make his fingers spasm suddenly.
“I hear you saying you mean it,” she replied, carefully. “But I don’t understand.”
Potter actually smiled at that. Snickered, even. Relaxed, crossing his arms on the bench and meeting Draco’s eyes with something that might have been guarded optimism. He was still watching Draco work; trust wasn’t something that came easily to either of them, but it was still somewhat disheartening. He’d been looking forward to the possibility of… well, not a friend, but someone to talk to who was under the age of seventy and not obsessed with plants. Not that Neville was a bad sort, and he had won puberty roulette with flying colours which made him awfully nice to look at, but he was hardly a challenge.
It was an interesting revelation, actually. Certainly nothing he would have ever learned from his mother. She was intelligent, certainly, but she made decisions moment to moment, and Blaise didn’t think he had ever caught her in anything like a contemplative moment.
“This Glamour of yours is a bit of alright,” Blaise said, gesturing at Malfoy’s face. “You really just wear it all the time?”
He spent a long time at the edge of the lake, feeding the ducks. There were three or four that always made a point of coming close enough to be petted, their lovely long necks stretching out in the sun. He named them. He never remembered the names. He named them again every time.
Draco adjusted his robes as he ascended the steps to the head table — and he froze.
“You could be a part of this life,” Harry murmured, and when Draco choked, leaning in, Harry wrapped him in his arms and pulled him close. He kissed Draco’s shoulder, his neck, his jaw, and when Draco let out an almost mournful cry and leaned for Harry’s lips, Harry kissed him properly.
“I came to apologise, Mrs Malfoy. For leaving the party so abruptly. It was indefensibly rude of me.”
“I will,” Draco said, but his eyes were still on Harry’s face. What the fuck was wrong with him? Why couldn’t he feel the weight the air in the room? Why didn’t he come over and snog the life out of Draco and see what might happen next?
“Wouldn’t you like to know,” Draco replied, sneering. “I won’t explain it, you’re altogether too stupid to understand the intricacies of a Slytherin plan.”
Black,” Harry said. His eyes were bright and determined and even if it was disappointing that Harry hadn’t just stepped into Draco’s space and pulled him close, there was something about Harry’s posture that said Draco needed to let this happen at its own pace. As Draco let his Glamour shift, Harry gave a small shake of his head. The Glamour slipped back up as easily as it had slipped down. “I don’t have an appointment, but I was hoping that we could talk.”
“Well, I wasn’t. And I know it’s not fair. Not many people fall in love at fourteen and stay that way for the rest of their lives. But Harry — you’ve seemed so terribly lonely.”
“Don’t look so appalled, Harry. You know I was on house arrest for a year while the rest of you were nursing Hogwarts back to health. I mastered a few spells. I was desperately bored without you to taunt.”
He experienced rejection rather like most people experienced, say, a slow beheading with a rusty spoon.
Harry sold twenty-two children their first wands, that day, and felt a warm glow every time their eyes lit up when they found the right one. Nine of them bought wands Harry had made himself, not that they knew it, and Harry floated home in the evening on a cloud of satisfaction.
“Get your fingers out of my hair, Potter,” he said, summoning up all the willpower he could locate (there was damnably little) and pulling away, just a little.
It wasn’t as if anyone had bloody asked him.
And then, on Saturday night, when Harry arrived at the Hog’s Head with Neville and half of the faculty Draco was just on his way out.
“Not really,” Blaise said, sauntering to the bar, his Unspeakable robes shrunk down and tucked into his pocket, wearing dark grey trousers with a perfect crease beneath a black t-shirt which drew the ayes of almost everyone in the room, whether desirous or envious. “I was a snooty git in school just like you. I’m not sure either of us have changed. We’ve just got different bits hanging out, now. Metaphorically speaking, of course.”
“There is a world of difference between watching out for unexpected love potions, and screening for highly concealed dark magic; but I should think that for the near future, Draco’s mail should come through you.” Her mouth was tight and angry. “The packages, at the very least.”
Saturday night at the Hog’s Head, then, for a few pints with some of the other teachers. And Sunday, somehow, Draco found himself in Harry’s room, curled up on a comfortable armchair while they both marked homework, chatting from time to time about Duelling Club the following evening, and eating an early supper in front of the fire, thick-cut bacon sandwiches and boiled eggs, followed by Harry’s beloved treacle tart.
Draco made himself a cup of jasmine green tea, inhaling the earthy aromas as he studiously ignored the front page of the Prophet. It was folded into quarters but Draco could see familiarly untidy black hair waving in the top centimetre of whatever photograph of Harry Potter was on the front page.
“And I thought you might ask Ginny. If there’s something terrible. Something she remembers. Maybe something he never told us.”
It didn’t feel like the sort of evening where the dining table was appropriate. Harry spread the food out on the coffee table in the upstairs sitting room with a couple of bowls, in front of the television (it had taken him almost a year to figure out how to shield it from all the magic in the house, but it worked fine now) and opened a couple of bottles of beer. He was about to knock on Draco’s door — the guest room door — when it opened, and Draco stepped out like a very tall ghost, drawn in by the smell, or perhaps by the sound of the television.
, the voice muttered.
Harry's face transformed into a mask of shock. "What? Why?"
Draco took a deep breath and closed his eyes before speaking. "I'm in love," he said.
Harry pictured the first alcohol bottle that came to mind, cognac. It was the only thing the Dursley's drank at home, just a small glass every now and again. Harry had snuck a sip once, out of curiosity, and after his eyes stopped burning, he promised himself he would never drink again.
"What's going on," Draco asked.
"Yes, Weasel. I'm all torn up inside over that mass-murdering bastard. In fact, if you don't mind moving, I have to go weep over his grave."
Neville shook his head. "It wasn't nothing. If it were nothing you would have come home right after, as it is you've been gone for almost a day. What happened?"
From where he stood Harry couldn't see who was winning, but he did spot a small tent at the eastern border of the battleground, just under a small copse of trees.
Another burst of the harsh laughter and Voldemort raised his wand, "I don't think you need concern yourself with old age, Potter."
"Go on Paige. You're the only person in this room in one piece."
The king jerked back and Draco could feel Severus stiffening in outrage behind him, but he gestured for the dark man to remain silent.
Alex, Harry's boss and the co-owner of the club, had left early. He didn't say where he was going, but the slight smile told Harry all he needed to know. Over the weeks Harry had been working at the club, he and Alex had become friendly and even though Harry had never met the one-eyed man's boyfriend, he knew the two were very much in love.
Harry snorted. "Oh, I'm wonderful. Every day is paradise. Did you know that there is a weapon coming?"
Severus's tone was even and businesslike, but Paige bit back a gasp. "He'll- I mean, they're going to be okay, right," she asked, whispering harshly and hoping no one could hear her over the racket.
"That's nice. Very sexy."
Harry shook his head, still gripping his wand tightly in his lap. The relaxed smiling man he was used to, slacker by day and stripper by night, had turned into a creature, and an unfamiliar creature at that. Part of Harry wanted to run, but the other part saw Remus in this man, saw himself, and almost against his own will he began to relax.
"He's gotten so big. Wow."
During their preparations to leave the Hogwarts infirmary, Paige had managed to drag an explanation out of the blond whitelighter, and she figured it was probably best if as few people as possible knew the nature of wizarding magic. Draco enthusiastically agreed.
A light pink color touched the edges of Ron's ears as he looked down and muttered something.
Blaise raised his hands, "No, please, don't sing. Just tell me what's going on. Ron was sniggering when he came back to bed that night, but he never told me what happened."
Again the spinning swirling nauseating sensation of traveling hundreds of miles in a stream of molecules and Paige found herself standing on a cool stone floor in the middle of a crowded hall.
Pomphrey nodded. "I heard it all from my room. Your poor father. He fell apart when Narcissa died and he has no way to put himself back together."
Taking a deep breath, he said, "Are you sure?"
"Why do I need a name at all," Draco growled.
The field was covered with the remaining fighting force of the castle and that of the Dark Lord. Black robed forms shifted under the ever-present haze of curses and spells.
The potion appeared and Neville snatched it off of the table before Harry could blink. Ron had been trembling steadily for the past hour, and his fever had given way to a serious chill.
Severus closed his eyes and nodded. Ron wasn't his favorite former student, but he had grown up well and Severus knew too well what being a werewolf could do to a family, especially under the Ministry's strict non-human guidelines.
And this man was exhausted and he hurt.
"Draco? What are you doing in the hall? And on the floor?"
Then something occurred to him and he opened his eyes, "How did you know where to find them? Their location was kept secret, even from me."
Draco healed without counting. He couldn't mend the wounded wizards broken bones, punctured organs, completely with his white lighter powers, but he could get them healthy enough to have a chance of survival. He only hoped he would have the strength to get to all of them.
Draco gasped as a piercing pain cut through his stomach. He fell to his knees, filled with fear and despair, knowing the emotions weren't his.
"Tell us what you're doing here. Who sent you?"
Severus's voice broke on that last word and Draco was released as the older man rubbed his hand over suspiciously damp eyes. Remembering what happened the last time they touched when Severus was upset, Draco kept his hands to himself. But his heart ached with the pain his godfather was feeling all the same.
Before Severus had the chance to speak Spike had slammed the door closed and moved behind the man, holding him in place with pale sinewed arms wrapped around the tan and shining torso.
Chris paled and his lips tightened into a thin grimace. "I can't tell you anything so please don't ask me."
Occasionally Severus would see Hermione pop her head in through the curtain and wave her off. There would be time enough for friends and noisy sympathy soon enough, now was the time for peace and reflection.
Feathers.
Harry nodded and stood, his posture straighter and stronger than it had been earlier. "I will, Severus," the boy said, walking towards the door. Before he left he turned back and said, "You should consider your own advice. I'm sure Paige would be very happy to see you again."
"You have to be here for me," Ron said.
As the potion was administered, Ron calmed down, and his temperature settled back to normal. He still looked sick, but Neville looked relieved for the first time that night.
Harry shook his head, his mouth pinched into a tight line.
Chris looked confused, but Severus saw Harry's pallor and felt they couldn't spare any time for the puzzled whitelighter. "All right, Chris just orb us to the alley outside of the nightclub and we can carry him in. I trust you know a back way in, Spike," Severus said looking at the vampire who leered in return. "Very well then."
And so Draco lived for a year, alone in the woods. The nights were cold and frightening, but eventually he got used to the constant noise of the forest, so similar and yet so different from palace life. Sometimes he heard hunters or travelers moving through the forest, but he was intelligent and he hid, trusting to the foliage and the bearskin cloak that he never went without to hide him.
She watched as Spike stood, grabbing the back of Severus's shirt and dragging him along. After a few moments of whispered conversation, the two men beckoned to Chris, and together the three of them orbed away.
Lucius was confused. "What do you mean? it was my Narcissa, my bride come back to life."
Shivering now, though Harry's arms tightened, almost painfully, around him, "I don't care, Harry. It's just public opinion. If you can weather the storm, so can I."
"Is he okay?"
The object of their conversation had just walked into the room.
"How can it be a tight fit? We've been at this for hours."
In a choked voice, Spike said, "There are easier ways to get a man's attention, love."
The vampire laughed, and got off the desk. Walking to the door he turned and blew a kiss at the man who reached out a hand to catch it.
Draco smiled and pressed his hand, now glowing with a soft blue light, to Harry's still stinging cheek.
Draco tightened his grip on Harry's hand and muttered, "I think they're are a bit tarty."
The brunette looked at the three men in the room, his gaze lingering on Severus for long moments, but he spoke directly to Spike. "I'm afraid I need more than that, Spike. I know who you're talking about, but walls have ears."
"We came out here to warn you," Draco said.
Paige snorted. "If half of what I've heard is true this is nothing." Passing Xander she dodged a solid pinch to the bottom and returned a solid slap of her own. Holding Draco's hand she orbed the two of them back to San Francisco , hearing Xander's merry giggle as they disappeared.
Draco froze for a second, then began sawing again, frantic to get into the tent, to find the weapon, to stop whatever was going on in there.
"No."
With that, she pulled an icy can of soda out of the bottom drawer of the fridge.
Two hours into the card game and Harry's eyes were drifting shut. The wine and Firewhisky had flown freely and he'd enjoyed enough alcohol to loosen his tongue. Staring out of the card room and into the mass of colorful, twirling dancers, he searched for a familiar white-blond head.
She nudged Draco over and took a seat on the couch next to him, pressing a cool-fingered hand against his forehead before moving it through his thick hair to the back.
"Greetings, my lord father."
"And the baby?"
The next morning found Harry only slightly hung over thanks to one of Snape's potions, and throwing his clothes around their small motel room in search of the right outfit. What does one wear to an interview for a stripping job? The most logical answer would be, 'very little,' but Harry wasn't quite ready for that.
The boy sighed, but coughed heavily on the exhale. Paige wasn't sure what to do and finally settled for awkwardly rubbing his back until he caught his breath.
Harry shifted Draco's shirt out of the way, but the skin beneath was smooth and unmarked. There were no wounds and Harry said as much.
As Draco recited the items, Paige turned to the strange red head. "I'm Paige Matthews, pleased to meet you," she said, offering her hand.
"It was nothing."
The quiet, mad laughter tickled Harry's ear.
Paige gasped. "Harry?"
Harry wondered exactly how much the Slytherin was supposed to be helping him when he'd almost died hundreds of times over the past few years. And Draco had almost killed Dumbledore, and Katie and Ron. How could he be telling the truth about being Harry's guardian angel if he was trying to kill people?
Snape with a smirk.
It was their first lead, and though Harry hadn't seen the blond or the woman since, he had heard other mentions of the Dark Lord. Enough to justify their mission, at least.
He nodded and Paige walked out of the room, dragging Phoebe behind her.
The green eyed boy walked closer, examining Draco carefully. "He's not a vagrant, Ron, and he's definitely not a bear." he smiled softly and spoke directly to Draco. "Are you alright? Did the dogs hurt you?"
"Don't really want to talk about it?"
"I can't, Ron. I can't."
When the king was gone from his chambers, Draco shook his head to drive away the fear and disgust he felt at the older man's hand s and called out his nurse.
He trailed off and the three sisters waited for him to continue. He opened his mouth a few times but nothing came out and Paige watched in fascination as emotions trailed across his face. Confusion, anger, fear, sorrow, humor, joy, and love.
"You and Potter? Finally," the brunet crowed.
"Potter. It's time."
"Harry? What is that," Hermione asked.
She was going to go search for them when Blaise looked up with a beaming grin on his face. "Look. It's my baby. Isn't he lovely?"
"Did you get hurt, Paige," Phoebe asked.
Blaise looked at the retreating Charmed One, then at the unconscious blond, before turning to the others. "I asked before and I'll ask again, what the hell is going on? Draco got hurt? I know I'm a heavy sleeper, but this is insane."
Paige nodded and Phoebe got a determined look on her face. "I think we need to have a talk with this Harry. See what his intentions are to our Draco."
Phoebe looked sick, and Piper seemed on the verge of tears. Even Paige felt a little sick. There had been more than one occasion she had given the… boy… the eye, and even been disappointed in his lack of response. Well, now she knew why he didn't notice, he had barely started puberty.
"You're expecting?"
Paige looked at Severus for help, not sure what to do for the injured vampire and saw that the otherwise dour man was barely restraining laughter. She could see his full lips twitching and a dancing light in his eyes. For a second she wished she had hit Spike intentionally to make Severus laugh.
Snape shifted upright in the bed, "But what are you doing here? I thought we wouldn't be seeing you again." Snape caught himself as the boys face fell and deadpanned, "Not that it isn't wonderful to see you, of course."
It was an image of him at sixteen. Lily's idea.
The red head nodded. "Of course I can." He motioned for Paige to take the baby, which she gladly did, then lifted Blaise gently.
Severus, however, was a much more serious case.
Lost in reminiscence he didn't hear Paige until she was standing next to him.
Some minutes later, exhausted and crying, he came back to himself again on the floor of the bathroom. He was cold and his hands were shaking. After his years of fighting he expected to grow past his fear of blood, but though the reaction had weakened, it never went away.
A warm American accent said, "Alex Prewitt, manager of The Meat Market. Pleased to meet you, River."
"Shannon? Shannon, can you come here?"
When the last few crumbs were wiped away, and before Blaise could grab another piece of bread, Paige moved towards him. "'They're going to kill each other' Blaise?"
Through the monstrous ringing he heard Piper say something, but he couldn't make it out and the ringing seemed to travel through him, through his chest, his heart, and out of his mouth in a fierce scream before the world disappeared.
Harry turned to Draco, sweeping water from his glasses, "I have to go in, but remember, I love you. Even if we can't… You know."
He tried to back out of the room. "I'm going to go see how Ron and the bab-"
"Harry? Harry are you all right? You're drifting."
Regular clothes suited his long, lean figure well and she had to force her eyes away from the sight of his denim clad behind, much to Spike's amusement.
Draco froze. He had to change, he had to hide, but the cook's voice brooked no argument and Draco nodded, reaching out with the hem of his cloak to pick up the coal scuttle.
The vampire grinned, and the man in the chair echoed the expression before saying, "He can bite me, I like it," and flicking a quick tongue over the vermilion drops that beaded up on the swollen flesh of his mouth.
Harry heard Hermione snicker and opened his eyes to see Draco beside him. The blond's hand was still pressed against his forehead, but the other held a small plate of food that Harry was surprised to see held several things he knew the blond wouldn't eat.
When he was calm she looked at Severus, still standing frozen in the doorway. That didn't last long. A fiery red flush rose in the pale ascetic cheeks and when Severus turned to Paige she saw a fire in his eyes that frightened her in its intensity.
"Where's Draco?"
Her voice was so steady and so matter-of-fact that Harry wanted to laugh. Even through the fear and strain of the war the essential Hermione hadn't changed.
Or it was supposed to be, when Harry was pinned to the ground, watching purple streams of magic from several directions cross his field of vision.
Caught in the feathers and with the weight of Harry bearing him down Draco could not fight back as the Elder grabbed one of his arms and Shannon grabbed the other.
"Not really, Draco."
"I'm trying to prove a point, Harry," he answered as he poured the bottle out into the glass.
, Draco thought,
Draco gently extricated himself from her hold and moved away, gesturing for Shannon to take a seat on the couch and taking a seat of his own.
Picturing the delicate blue light and pondering those words, Harry could feel the connection just beyond his grasp.
That night Draco cooked, and helped plate the food. He wasn't allowed into the dining hall in his fur and soot, but he could prepare the trays in the kitchen.
"Really? I would think a lavender and aloe infusion might be better. They used wormwood in this and it might react badly with the mallow."
Because we still have to fight, and I'd like to get it over with before I die of old age."
Paige pulled her arms back as Draco stood up straight and moved closer to the blond vampire, a long thin stick in his hands. Paige wasn't sure what he meant to do with it, but there were very few options at the moment.
His head was throbbing, and as Harry walked closer to him Draco let out a pathetic muffled whimper.
"So, if you're an angel, where are the wings?" Harry still didn't believe Draco, but he had to ask.
And now in the sunny garden he saw Draco for what felt like the first time.
Harry's breath caught in his throat as he saw Voldemort raise his wand, the tip already glowing an ominous green. So close to the weapon, an Avada Kedavra would take out the machine -and everyone around it including the now-trembling blond. It would be the solution to all of Harry's problems, the weapon and the Dark Lord destroyed in one go, except that Draco was there.
Cut off mid-sentence but pleasantly by the pressure of warm lips against his own, Draco didn't fight the kiss, he just relaxed into it, in case it was the last.
The red head snorted softly, "Better hope the Ferret has, mate. If he's still out there, he's drowned by now."
Harry snorted, though he felt a sinking in his stomach. He was weak and injured, his shoulder now thumping with pain to match his head and he could feel the thick flow of blood trickled down his arm. He was starting to feel dizzy and sick, but he steeled himself. It was all going to end soon, one way or another.
The brunette looked startled for a moment. "You're eighteen."
Paige walked over to the black haired man's, Severus's, bed. His shirt and pants had been cut away, exposing severe burns. If he had been awake, he would probably have been screaming, but he was still, almost too still, and Paige shuddered.
If the Dark Lord got that weapon, the war would be over, and not in Harry's favor.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm sorry Hermione. I was upset and I wanted to take a walk, I never saw it coming. I just needed to clear my head."
Blaise gasped, "If the baby comes out looking like Draco, Ron'll never forgive me."
A few months before, he hadn't hit the growth spurt his death denied him, and he would have been a few inches shorter than the screaming harpy, but now he could look down his aristocratically pointed nose at her and wait for her to run out of breath.
When the brunet was laid, half-drowsing, in his bed, Paige turned to Ron. "Do you want to take him," she asked, offering the baby.
A light dawned in the older man's eyes at Draco's words. Leaning forward he said, "You must escape. That is the only way you will be safe. Your father will not propose until the full moon, it is the night he proposed to your mother. That gives us time to gather your things and find a way out of the kingdom. I still have friends in other countries and we can make our way to them. It will be difficult, but I believe you can be free-"
She settled him into an oddly comfortable chair and explained the procedure. It took a few moments to get arranged, then per her instruction he took a deep breath and everything went black.
With a swirl of blue, the brunette orbed into the kitchen. The small space was rapidly becoming crowded, but Paige couldn't leave if she wanted to, it was too interesting.
Caught up in planning, neither Severus or Draco had noticed Lucius entering the wing, two hulking guards at his back. "I had thought to surprise my beloved, and in turn I am surprised. Did you truly plan to leave me, Draco?"
This feeling was reinforced by the blurry appearance of a blond man in Snape's own blue robe.
"It's about time, you two."
"Draco? Merlin! Are you all right?"
Harry moved forward and gripped Neville's shoulder in thanks before embracing Hermione. These missions were hardest of all for her. She didn't do a lot of the field work, instead spending hours researching and waiting for one of the boys to come back from whatever they had been doing. As months passed and the injuries were mounting up, Harry could see the strain growing.
The second row of guard, three of them, had seen him come out of the darkness and as Harry hexed the first four, theses three had a chance to ready their spells.
Before they could fall he fled the ballroom and hid in the pump house, to weep until he fell asleep.
He heard his name and nodded in agreement, but most of his attention that wasn't focused on how Harry's presence made him feel was wandering over the Great Hall, looking for people he hadn't seen in months. Some were around, but others were missing and while part of Draco wanted to ask where they were another part of him had a strong suspicion that it didn't want confirmed.
Harry's birthday was coming. He would be eighteen and three balls were planned. Everyone in the castle was working to prepare the palace, it's grounds, and the grand ballroom that Draco had never seen.
With a shaking hand the boy took the pictures, his mouth slightly open in what Severus presumed was awe. "This… This is Blaise?"
Still he knew tears weren't entirely appropriate so he shoved his hands while he tried to think of a change of subject and internally cheered as his fingers encountered the pictures.
"It's- I'm not sure exactly." Harry turned to Severus. "I'm in love with him, you know?"
Even in the face of mortal danger, Harry had to roll his eyes in the face of blatant cliché. "Yes, well, apparently it was destined, Tom. We didn't have much choice in the matter."
My anxiety is riding high today so this is my distraction. I hope folks are enjoying it
Severus nodded. "Of course I do. I know about that weapon you mentioned. They told me, but I didn't think Voldemort would get his hands on it. I know that James Narcissus is sprouting a lovely head of strawberry blond hair, and I know that Draco is completely puzzled. Have you been ignoring his letters? What happened between the two of you?"
With that the boy turned and went back towards the party. Behind him, Draco called out, "I can weather the storm, Harry! Can you?"
Tugging his Dudley trousers a little higher, then adjusting the handed down T shirt that had slipped off of his shoulder to reveal a few livid bruises, Harry winked at the congregation and walked out of the room.
Hermione glamoured as a man was just… unsettling.
He arrived there only seconds before his uncle swept in the door. Severus wore a dark shadow across his face, and Draco felt his heart leap into his throat.
"Okay, you want to do this? Then who am I to stop you. It's a good way to make money for college anyway, right?" Opening the manila folder that had been laying on the table, the man went on, "According to your application, you're nineteen, and a recent high school graduate, right?"
Severus had enough time to re-ward his doors before his rooms were out of sight.
Severus struggled up from the pillows, pushing away Paige's restraining hands. "I am not vulnerable, Potter, and I will help you figh-"
Head still spinning with this new information, Harry could only nod, barely noticing Snape do the same.
"Xander!"
They left the boys alone, nothing could be done, and Harry wouldn't leave the blonds side. The green-eyed boy said something about 'weathering the storm,' and refused to leave as the wind howled around the Astronomy Tower.
"Great Harry, you can meet with the manager tomorrow."
The Golden Boy wasn't supposed to touch the Dark Prince.
Harry shook his head, "I'm sure I would remember that."
Draco held his breath. It was Severus. He did not know whether to fall to the floor in a dead faint, or embrace the man and weep into his robes. Stuck, he just stoked the fire, slowly so he could hear what was being discussed.
She just smiled and said, "Probably with Harry."
The next morning he had woken up on the couch next to Draco, the blond sleeping at his side, pressed against the back of the couch. It was a bit of a squeeze, but better for that because Harry felt like he was resting and protecting the blond at the same time and it was a nice feeling, a content feeling.
Her initial resemblance to Lily was nothing more than superficial. Where Lily was merry and thoughtful, Paige was all mischief and enthusiasm.
"Do you want forever?" he asked. Harry crouched next to but not touching Draco, completely ignoring Paige and Severus. He took a deep breath and said a silent prayer to any gods that was listening before he went on. "Do you love me, Draco? Was that ever true?"
And if he didn't want to complicate things with another face to face encounter, that was his business.
"Hey Ron, any idea how lover boy is doing?"
As honorary aunt Paige knew her responsibilities so she moved closer to coo over the tiny infant. It wasn't hard. He didn't seem to have the squish-faced redness she'd seen in other newborns. His skin was lovely and smooth already and thin tufts of reddish-brown hair covered his scalp.
"Why not," Paige replied, "It's an orange soda. That's almost like juice." She cracked the can gently, allowing any excess gas to escape, and waited for the explosion.
"Fine, whatever, just let me go," the blond grunted, the red now turning to purple from lack of air.
(See the end of the chapter for
Thoughts drifting from one problem to another, Harry sipped at his glass of champagne slowly, it was not the first drink he'd had that night and he had to keep his wits about him as best he could, and absentmindedly nodded his assent to whatever question Ron had asked.
With a sharp whistle the dogs let go of his cloak and he was able to sit up, getting his feet under him in case he had to run.
And she orbed out.
Harry blushed a violent tomato red and Draco buried his also-pink face in the green-eyed boy's shoulder.
She nodded. "He's in the attic."
The Death Eater ground down again and Harry groaned at the pain, squeezing his eyes shut tightly. Then the pressure eased up, until the Death Eater had stepped off completely and Harry reopened his eyes and saw her standing a few feet away.
She bit back a sigh, silently reminding herself that nose whistling was not adorable, and turned back to Phoebe.
Draco giggled, before slapping his hands over his mouth, but Harry was left shaking his head in denial.
Again Alex and Spike shared a look. This time it was Spike who answered, "Can't pull the wool over your eyes, can we, Golden Boy?"
, he thought.
Severus and Spike were at her sides, but Draco didn't respond to either. Paige opened her arms to the boy and he moved into her embrace, dropping his head against her shoulder.
When he was settled and Paige was sure he wouldn't fall, she stepped back and examined him. The green tint was gone, and though he was still pale; he was no longer paler than usual. As she reached out to check his forehead for fever, the obsidian eyes snapped open and she froze in place, one hand hovering over his face.
The next thing he knew he was in a living room full of shouting people. Looking around he saw Snape crouching over a screaming figure with a redheaded woman and a brunette at his side.
"I am Draco Malfoy, my Lord, Prince of Slytherin. Do with me as you will."
Reaching the bassinette he picked up the baby gently and handed him to his friend.
"Let me go."
"Yes."
"Still out, I think. Pity that. Hope Dragon is better, at least."
Harry stayed off to the side, memories of his brief encounter with Draco returning to his mind.
"I need a bed for him."
"Oh yes, half Malfoy, half Prewett, and all squib. And now, all vampire."
Voldemort was standing over him, and almost kindly expression on his lipless face as he held out his hand.
The voice was familiar, only the second wizard he's ever met and the first his own age, but the tone was new. No longer sneering and cold, it had warmed up over nights in this room, in front of this fire.
As it settled, he heard Chris's voice come through, "-ry should be fine, Severus. It took a while to get him stable, but he was awake when I left and I think Alex and Spike will take good care of hi-" Chris broke of as the shimmering orb faded. "Oh, hey Draco," the white lighter mumbled.
Harry looked back to Voldemort to see that the Dark Lord had gotten to his feet again and advanced on the weapon and the man that knelt next to it, Draco.
The Slytherin pressed a finger to his lips briefly, staring contemplatively at a blank spot on the wall, and then looked at Harry, "You know, I'm pretty sure it was during our last date. You spent the entire time trying to keep your cousin's cast off trousers up, despite my best efforts to remove them, and then said, 'Draco I really need a makeover.'"
The two, aunt and nephew, met eyes, and disappeared in a shower of light, following the pained cry.
"Fourth year. I died during fourth year."
Severus shook his head. "I hardly think so. I was too tall, too thin, and too pale. The other students used to call me a bat or a vampire."
The steel in Harry's eyes softened as strong fingers brushed against the side of Draco's neck, caressing his nape and cupping his ears. The Gryffindor leaned in, smiling, and said, "For me?"
The boy he loved was dead. And gone.
Shannon released him and let him flop back onto the couch and pant until he regained his breath before leaning down and pinching his cheek. "There, that wasn't so hard, now was it?"
There was a flash of light and two brief screams as the remaining demons were unfrozen and blown up.
He was woken from his drowse as they approached a large castle. Panicking for a moment at the thought they had returned to Slytherin, Draco sighed in relief at the sight of a red and gold flag of Gryffindor. As they dismounted their horses by the stable Draco clutched his bag tighter, looking around him with wide eyes.
The Death Eater pressed her foot down a little harder and Harry felt bone grinding on bone under her heel.
"Eat."
Draco moved towards the door, but stopped when Hermione grabbed his arm.
With those three words Harry fell apart. It had been months since he had seen the blond boy, and weeks since he thought he was over him, but with those three words everything Harry had felt the day Draco disappeared came back. He collapsed on a chair, gripping the mirror tightly.
"Come on, Potter. It's time for your makeover."
A louder snort followed, but still his godson didn't wake.
In fact he found a kitchen, brightly decorated and sunny. But it had a door of its own and on the other side of that was a garden. Harry walked out onto the grass and raised his face to the sky to take a deep breath of air not stuffy with the scent of sweat and blood and pain.
For the first time in a long time he thought about his life, and the existence he had now. He couldn't call it living because he was technically dead, never mind that he ate and drank and breathed and slept.
"There, there, love," Blaise said, rocking the baby until he stopped crying and returned to sleep. Then Blaise looked up and, with a lowered voice, said, "Don't you think this gets you off the hook. I still want to know what's up with you and lover boy, but we'll need to keep it quiet."
Without turning from his place Severus said, "I know white lighter healing has a diminished effect on our type of wizard, but if you could focus on the baby while I take care of Blaise I would very much appreciate it."
"Chris, do you know this kid?"
Harry didn't know what it was, but it didn't sound good. Still, he had his own evil overlord to destroy. Any others would have to take a place in line.
Chris?
When the girl stopped,
Draco scowled slightly, remembering Harry sharing more than a few heated snogs with various Weasleys before they got together. At the sight of the scowl the man behind the counter smirked smugly, and Draco got even more irritated. That smug smirk was his, damn it.
There was a heavy feeling in the house, like the air before a storm, and Paige knew that no matter how normal everything felt, trouble was coming. So she stayed vigilant and took a break from the endless round of magical temp jobs to work with Chris and Draco. Rumors were starting about some kind of magical weapon and every demon that mentioned it sounded either very envious, or very scared.
In these rooms he was just another not particularly bright student and the weight of the wizarding world was lifted from his shoulders; for a few short hours at least. Many nights Harry and Draco had fallen asleep on the thick rug before the fire.
"Are you- I mean, could you- I mean, I know there's an age difference, but-"
Draco and Harry were happy. They had weathered the storm, and they knew they would be together, in this life, and any life to come.
Things continued in this fashion for months until one day the level of excitement in the castle spiked. Draco wanted to know what was going on, but since Harry was unavailable, he had to ask one of the kitchen crew. Moving furtively he grabbed the hem of a maid's shirt. She gasped in shock when he spoke, but then told him what he wanted to know.
Together the two of them traveled through the castle. After a few yards Severus gave in to accompanying the witch, but she seemed not to notice as her grip on his forearm only tightened.
