"So this is what I do. I stock shelves, whatever department needs it most at the time. I've got a grey tunic, which means I don't really have a department of my own. I'm a floater. Luna, too - have you met her? She's brilliant."
Better. The word winded Monty. He was better for James than some ruddy spell. He could help the doctor to understand James better than a magic wand could do. But James didn't trust him, even after all these years. After seven years, countless hours in each other's company, a hundred romantic and nutritious picnics for all three Charmings, new habits and rituals formed and broken and formed again around their excruciatingly slow-built relationship, James still fought tooth and nail whenever Monty offered his help.
“The Healers will get you back on track,” offered Remus, and Harry nodded. They’d explained his recovery plan and he’d listened to every word, despite their belief that he was still in shock. It was simply that he’d had enough of the same two voices and wanted to hear someone else speak for once.
Eyes fixed on Remus, Harry signed again. Alec hesitated and Arthur smothered a laugh. This time, Monty translated, rather aggressively: "Yer not much good at it."
“Everyone thinks Potter is so perfect, with his stupid hair and those ratty old trainers. When someone else lets their department fall behind, he swoops in with his cart to come to their rescue.”
After much shouting and crying and tea, they hadn't really arrived at any decisions. They were drained. Hugo was just a toddler, but Rose, their eldest, she knew something was up this morning as Ron herded the children through the floo to the Burrow. The five-year-old had given them such a knowing look that Hermione was nearly convinced their daughter was a Seer.
Warmth beyond sunshine flooded Harry and he couldn't help the little smile that stole over his face. They'd never lost their urgency to find him -
"She was my very good friend," he managed emphatically. "She was with me at school and at home when, erm...well, having her company meant a lot to me when I was lonely, or scared. I've missed her. And, I think she would be quite jealous of this one!" He nodded at the snow bird and chuckled at the thought. She might've very well pecked the poor thing back to powder.
"You should keep your wand in a drawer or something instead of on the bedside table," Hermione suggested lightly, offering the wand back. James didn't take it and she placed it on the table. "Keep it somewhere close by, of course, but where you can't reach it while you're dreaming. Plenty of witches and wizards have found themselves sleepwalking with their wands..." She rattled off some story about a witch who wandered into a Muggle circus in the dead of night and released all of the animals, only to wake up the next morning without a clue.
and unending. The sun was still stuck behind the mountains, but its power painted his whole world in more colors than he could put a name to. How could such a view exist while everyone just went about their lives with their heads down?
Weasel darts a hand into the box of chocolates that Mum prepared, but Potter fends him off valiantly. He pops a truffle into his perfect mouth, sucking on it whole and glaring over at Draco as if in challenge. The Gryffindor table descends into roaring chaos:
"PUNISHED!" Lucius screeched from the stairs. Draco focused all his attention on calming the poor creature in his arms while his father's voice drifted away. He wondered what Scorpius would have to say about his grandfather's awful manners today.
"Yes, you are," Ron mumbled, pouring himself a glass of water. Tony returned to the kitchen with a helpless shrug and Ron rolled his eyes. Harry was a stubborn arse.
James had suffered a long scratch on his forearm from Helen the Robot, a scratch that should have stopped bleeding after a few minutes. Instead, Monty walked into a veritable bloodbath upon returning home. Blood had dripped all along the stairs - where the mauling took place - along the hall and into the bathroom, where he found James with his arm over the sink, clasping a soaked flannel to the wound and getting greyer by the minute.
"Doubt that very much," Harry snorted, then added earnestly, "But, thank you. Do you fly much these days?"
He tastes chocolate and salt and the remnants of strawberry syrup, and a fresh wave of heat tears through the room. Perhaps Potter's right—perhaps the old crone is trying to cook them—or perhaps it's just Draco's libido. Well, there's one way to fix that.
"Azkaban fudges with your head in a way that's hard for most to understand," Kim agreed. Harry bit his lip. 'For most.' What about him? He reckoned he had quite a bit of experience when it came to wrongful imprisonment, even madness.
Harry simply blinked at McGonagall, his eyebrows lifted slightly in politely masked incredulity. No tension in the shoulders, no grinding of the teeth, no narrowing of the eyes behind those odd rectangular glasses. Just the same as the other Muggle families Remus had visited earlier that day; Harry was displaying all the mannerisms of a polite Muggle father who found himself entertaining a couple of nutcases for dinner.
Harry and his boys were in the west wing of the Manor, giving their statements under a strong dose of Calming Draught. The Malfoy family remained in the Blue Parlor. Lucius was ranting and raving about the Dark Lord - Draco assured them this was normal behavior, but it was setting the rest of the team on edge. Narcissa was holding up better than Ron would have expected from a civilian; she was her normal stoic, civil self, even with her elegant robes splattered in blood. She wouldn't leave Draco's side, however.
“Ms. Granger has suggested we try to recover lost memories of all sorts, both the banal and the dramatic. Is this something you’re interested in?”
"Well, Scorpius, I've been in Greece these last couple months, as you know," she began. Scorpius nodded and pried for more details that he wouldn't fully understand, details about her research and studies. Astoria specialized in ancient magic history. Scorpius could barely remember what he had for breakfast, so Draco doubted he could quite grasp the intricacies of ancient Grecian male fertility ceremonies.
There are no electrical plugs on his end, nothing to pick apart and use to start a fire. Not much to burn, anyway, except some old storybooks, some meager bedding, and his food supply. That certainly wouldn't be enough smoke to filter through their shared vent and incapacitate the man - and what would be the point, with Harry still locked in on his side?
Draco blinks, baffled. Harry stands, scooping the bag from the table as his other hand darts under one end of the centerline gap. He pulls. A squeak, a spring-like release, and the table suddenly folds up, sending Draco crashing to the floor.
There was a long silence and the room felt tense. Harry realized with a jolt that he had no idea how to end a conversation like this, with a stranger, or rather someone who was meant to be a stranger. But he didn't want to be found out for the unsocialized freak he was.
The mood turned somber, but James swallowed the urge to change the subject. Those words from the woman on the telly, long ago, rang in his head:
"No. No, call me Haz, I - I do like that." Harry took a deep, steadying breath. "What else did I say? What's a deadname?" he added belatedly.
"Humans are social creatures," she said, not for the first time. "It's not something we say for bits and giggles - " and Harry knew it wasn't bits, but rather shits, and he cracked another little smile at her insistence on playing along with his quirks, " - but pretty fast, without any input, the brain will start sending random signals. Firing off whatever it can to produce
was the one to trust implicitly. Nevermind the fact that he'd just mentioned a blond assailant in his fragmented memory of the incident…
It’s a red brick room, windowless and in stark contrast to the gingerbread walls and swirled-syrup windows of the rest of the cottage. Five paces by five paces, the sparseness makes the surrounding brick pattern dizzying. A few wall-mounted torches provide light. In the far corner rests a wire table with a huge spread of sweets and cakes, fresh and tempting after a salty dinner. In the center of the room is a single bed on an iron frame, sporting a flimsy blanket and no pillow. Charming accommodations. Better than the forest floor, at least.
“Corporate likes you, but let’s face it, your department’s new. It could easily be reabsorbed back into Beauty.”
"You mean you and Pansy would crumble if either of you had to open shop at eight in the morning..." Terry quipped, winking. "I do miss flying, but I'm not cut out for circus life. My luck, they'd hire me as their bearded lady!"
At some point, McGonagall began talking in depth about her school subject, transfiguration. Then she said something that implied, somehow, that she had personal experience as a feline. Monty seemed content to blink and let it go, but James nudged him urgently before the subject could move on.
"The Aurors saw some suspicious activity, but nothing to be alarmed about!" she added quickly when James jerked around in her grasp. He surveyed the platform with huge eyes, taking in the students and families that were milling about. Suspicious activity, what did that mean? He'd heard that phrase on the news countless times and he felt helpless, utterly
James reared back, eyes wide. Monty stood by what he'd said. The man was being stubborn, was throwing away his family for a blond cock and then turning it around on Monty, as if the man hadn't done enough to keep them going through the years -
It's agony, like Poseidon is waging war in his guts. He's sore beyond reason and just wants it all to end. He collapses weakly against the toilet and wonders where he'll end up if this
"Why do you not want your memories back?" The question took him aback but he seemed to consider it carefully, as he had many of the tougher questions in their therapy sessions.
"This farm?" Draco looked around theatrically, eyes wide. "You mean the farm we were both sequestered to for six agonizing months after a string of attempts on our lives? The farm we were meant to keep running in the absence of its tenants and which we subsequently ran into the ground? The farm my funds paid Longbottom to revive after we were through with it,
“Yeah,” Pansy answers in a slightly breathless voice, pulling her bottom lip between her teeth. The black cherry shade of her lipstick remains perfectly undisturbed. “And I’ve come...to you.” She lifts a brow suggestively, deploying a dangerous little smirk. Hermione remains oblivious as she flips back a page, looking through the notes.
James lay in the middle of the bed, a son on either side as he stared at the ceiling, unable to sleep. His boys assured him that, between Narcissa holding Alec against her neck and Draco pressing Arthur to his chest, they hadn't actually seen anything until after the Aurors arrived and pried them off their father. Even then, Alec said, it was only a glimpse of Tony's arm in the corridor.
"It all began seven years ago when a first met the dumb salad what jus' started work at the bakery." He winked at Al, who didn't even see it through his hands. "Worked the same shift, five tae five. He was a beauty, but skinny as a rail, so a brought him homemade treats to fatten 'im up. Ye know, like how a big strong bird woos a wee little bird tha's too stupid tae feed itself properly!"
Blaise looked to be in pain as he oh so bravely swallowed his laughter. "Be that as it may, I cannot witness you make another public appearance in that disgusting knit cap!"
"You won't because I gave it back to Potter." Draco gave his best dignified sniff as he poured himself a glass of water. "It was a matter of urgency. I wasn't about to go out in Mum's vintage tartan beret!"
Monty was left alone in the kitchen with a crumbly mess on the floor and another commercial break on the radio.
"There's a sweet man," Molly cooed quietly to her husband. Monty couldn't help but preen proudly as he went on.
It's Lenny who resorts to tying him down to the bed to keep him from "ruining" himself. The second time he's caught with the evidence in his pants, he vows never to have to endure this lesson a third time. He's not even allowed up to relieve himself - Lenny changes his nappies and spoon-feeds him his meals and by the time he's trusted again, he has half a mind to sleep standing up rather than ever return to a horizontal position.
The other boy wore clothes similar to Potter Senior himself: a striped t-shirt, denim trousers (though his were more fitted than Potter the Pigeon, who apparently still couldn’t dress himself properly), and brown ankle-high boots which were clunky and incongruent with the rest of his outfit.
James signed, not knowing how else to respond. Of course he wasn't cheating. The idea was laughable but James had never felt further from laughing.
And Malfoy was picking, picking, picking. He made pointed comments about Monty's absence, Monty's personality, Monty's
With a sigh, Charming started signing and Gibbs spoke, albeit softly: "Thought a was under attack, people were chasing me. They caught up when a went down wae ma hip busted." Draco stopped breathing. This had to be
James simply needed to remember how good things could be when he let Monty take care of him a bit. He was going through a rough patch with the boys gone, there was no shame in that. Sleeping all the time, hardly eating, opening the shop late. He hadn't cleaned upstairs since August, hadn't put together a new variety box since July. Monty made dinner nearly every night, he took care of the mail-orders in his spare time, he even cleaned upstairs where the health inspector wouldn't look. Without a word of complaint. He was
I couldn't find a graceful way to insert the traditional detailed-description-of-Draco's-hair, so I took care of that problem.  Also October 21st 2010 is when I started dating my then-boyfriend (who later became my husband on that same date in 2017).  So including that date is just a little shout out to us.
"You're not broken," he said adamantly, perhaps a bit antagonistically. "But you can be more than just scared and frustrated. And - " he grinned, feeling genuinely happy about this part for not entirely selfless reasons, " - you can keep James with you."
, he signed, testing out the new spell. His own holly wand spelled out the word next to his head in gold smoke. In his opinion, the wand thoroughly deserved to be banished to a dark corner in his flat, but instead it was on a grand tour for the sake of these appointments. He kept it in his back pocket while traveling (he had written a whole three pages to the boys to tell them about the Knight Bus), only pulling it out once he had settled into the appointment with Healer Malfoy. He dreaded to think of what would inevitably happen when he was faced with another flashback while carting around a magic-conductor, but after the row with Monty, he wasn’t going to give in and bring him along to translate.
"I graduated with honors," he said in the special clipped tone he reserved for the truly inferior. "Honors earned in the field of memory recovery."
There was a single broom - his Firebolt - hanging on a wall-mounted brass clip outside. Harry wondered if that was how he'd get to the top. Beyond that, it was hard to think. His butt was numb, he noted. It had been a long walk.
"The point, Severus," Arthur interrupts before Parvati can retort, "is not to see profits improve, but to see
“There’s all sorts of boy and girl mannequins in couple-y positions,” Seamus insists. “I wanna see the men holding hands for once!”
"Well, now they can put a face to the name for their best customer," she quipped fondly. "Perhaps make your purchases first, I rather think they might close up for the day when you start with the spells."
Al and Ar sat on their knees next to the tree, folding their feet under their bottoms in a way that only children could do. They were showing off their levitation skills as they passed out the presents. James told them about Ron's well-timed Wingardium Leviosa in their fight against a troll in the bathroom, then immediately regretted it when Arthur told him about a seventh year who was possibly part-troll and
They had a bit of a row at the jukebox at some point and things got rather heated before a tiny woman with long silver hair broke it up and put on her song instead. Draco and Harry returned to their seats, content at least to be losers together if it meant the other didn't win. Since when did Draco Malfoy know anything about Muggle music anyway?
The kitchen was silent with the exception of a few passing remarks from the boys. Monty grunted his approval for some dishes, but otherwise the meal was spent in relative quiet. Remus felt the tension in the air like a vice on his head, getting tighter with each blank, curious, or polite look he received from Harry.
Robert was gone, the shop was closed, and Monty was ready to have it out. James didn't love him, not anymore. To claim otherwise was cruel, heartless. He was angry. He was hurt. He wasn't even sure he wanted to fix things now, or if he just wanted to lash out.
"Not now!" he snapped, adding a drop of goblin water to the vial. The solution turned pink briefly before returning to its original blue. Clean. Next vial.
James hesitated. It was his shop, technically, and had been since the grand opening four years ago. His name was on all the paperwork, his hard-earned money got it started. He didn't hire Monty full-time until a year after opening, and he paid him a salary as an employee, not a co-owner.
But no matter - she was married. James had mentioned this past week that her husband Bobby or Robby or Knobby worked at a restaurant across town and was happy that his wife was able to find a job closer to home. A job with a boss that was all too sympathetic, Draco thought, to the stresses of pregnancy and money; a boss that was always willing to listen to her endless, prattling stories, while Draco lingered at the edge of the shop counter like a dunce -
“Why - my dear!” he cries. “We’re not yet out of our forties! Both prone to greys, I’ll admit, but we're quite spry!”
Potter is watching the sky through the naked tree limbs overhead. Draco drops down beside him, crossing his legs and arranging his cloak elegantly. He doesn't lie back. He doesn't want to see that damn void again, the blinding sheet of blue on a sunny afternoon. He stares hard at the spot where the Dark Lord must have been. He imagines what it must be like to stand on the precipice between life and death, the promise of the sun and the finality of the cold ground beneath his own divine arse…
“You alright?” He squatted down but felt unbearably close to the boy, like he was crowding him, and stood back up, shuffling his feet awkwardly.
really Da'? Er - a motorbike that flies, a great big snake an' its big teeth, some sorta car crash but...er, the tree was fighting back?" Harry nodded to confirm, still staring right at Ron almost in a challenging way. "Always red things, like furniture an' rugs an' shit - sorry Da',
Monty started howling with laughter and the table descended into chaos. Arthur looked like Christmas had come early, whether from the spotlight or from remembering one of his favorite Dad's-too-stupid-to-be-allowed stories. James propped his elbow on the table and covered his eyes, pushing his glasses askew.
The charmed creatures faded and reality began to creep back in. Monty was holding his hand where it was still clutching his forearm, watching him excitedly, knowingly. That Lupin fellow was staring at him too, but nobody else was paying any mind. Their guests went on with the meal as James forced himself back. Back to the kitchen, back to his clean trousers and thermal shirt, back to his left hand on Monty's arm and his right hand on his wand -
"Settle," he grunted in his partner's direction. Tony's hands fell away from his robe snaps and clenched at his sides. Everyone took energy potions differently and Auror Goldstein, it seemed, was one who indulged his nervous ticks.
The words could have been sarcastic but he looked disgustingly earnest, which caused Draco to choke on his spit.
No promises that I'll post next week since I clearly can't be trusted with a deadline, but I'll give it a shot!
"We can eliminate Healer Malfoy and Obliviate you again," Tony said, swallowing convulsively. "The children too, of course, and your Muggle; there's no knowing what you've told them over the years. Eventually everything will return to as it was." Surely he had to know that wasn't true. Anthony Goldstein had been missing for months, he couldn't just go back to work as an Auror - as Ron's partner on this very case, no less. "After a year or two, the press will die down and the Ministry will label it a cold case again. You can run your shop in peace."
Except that he was a git. He knew that much. He decided to watch him, closely. Eventually he would remember why Hermione had been driven to slap him. And also he would work on his habits and cope with his current...funk.
At the edge of the herd, he suddenly regrets riling Potter's temper. He dreads the moment Potter goes for the low blow, the moment he brings up the fact that it's Draco's fault all the Eighth Years can see the creatures. The moment the fire burns him.
"There's two o' ye?" he cried in mock-horror. George grimaced and shook his head, but provided no explanation.
Heaving the roast over to the table, James slammed it down, missing the trivet by a mile, and hurried to close the window just as -
“It's vital we get them back,” Mr. Flamel says emphatically. “Rarer than you'd believe, these are! Not a set like ‘em. They're
He actually manages to get his hands on the floor and then latches onto Ben's legs to drag himself the rest of the way off the mattress. When he bends over to pick him up again, Harry swings. A loud crunch tells him he's broken Ben's nose, and he scrambles away on his bum. Ben is clutching his nose, blood dripping down his chin, eyes tearing up. Harry uses the table to heave himself up just as Ben rushes forward. He gets in another punch or two before Ben grabs his arm in a bruising grip and swings him around towards the bed.
Not taking the piss then. He breathed a sigh of relief. Alec was perfectly friendly, but Arthur had been somewhat of a mystery to him. Relaxing, he lifted his hands to continue the game:
"Da', no!" Alec demanded, like he was speaking to a dog. "Bloody h - can you imagine what the others will think if they see you
Potter cries now, jabbing his wand at the door. Nothing. He stomps over and makes to grab the handle, but there’s nothing to grab. No handle. Just a heavy slab of iron with a few small ventilation holes where a handle once was.
he asked, panic gripping his heart and making it hard to breathe. Monty relayed his question and Hermione placed a hand on James's elbow.
James settled in for what was turning out to be their longest appointment yet. He told Malfoy about hiding in his and Aarti’s flat like a hermit for a few weeks, paralyzed with fear, nearly forfeiting his job at the grocery. About learning how to strap both slings to him at once in order to safely carry both squalling demons to buy supplies at Tesco. About pawning off Aarti’s clothes in an act of desperation, earning enough to pay a girl in their building to watch the boys after school so James could get back to work. About the simultaneous relief and anxiety he felt when he left the boys with her every day.
They were high up, eye-level with most of the action. Camera flashes lit up the glass walls of their box almost constantly, but James had plenty of breathing room. The game was incredible. Ron brought along a few vintage omnioculars, apparently their own from the Quidditch World Cup years ago, and they all passed them around gleefully while watching the Harpies thrash Puddlemere.
Draco couldn't ignore the click of the door locking or the whoosh of an unfamiliar ward filling the room and snuffing out the fire. His hand automatically dipped to his wand, his mouth opening to warn Blaise that something was wrong, but it was too late. He was bound to his office chair - the slightly gawdy brocade swivel chair that his mother had acquired from a specialty shop in Historic Alley. His wand slipped from his hand and into Blaise's own poorly tailored robe pocket.
The Head Auror was no match for Hermione's rapid-fire questioning and that's when they learned about the collapsed house in Godric's Hollow, the six dead witches and wizards inside, the wand which
They were that same gorgeous yellow-pine as the floor, whole logs now instead of planks, and Harry could almost smell the wood.
“I have complete trust in Harry,” Albus says with a benign smile. “Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Flamel. I assure you, your gems are in good hands.”
- and it was packed with shelves, bins, chocolates, and people. A dark wooden floor, old, scratched, and polished; a matching dark wooden ceiling with low beams that nearly touched Remus's head and did not improve his claustrophobia. There were too many colors, sounds, and smells to distinguish. Even the walls were busy: floor to ceiling, the cream-colored walls were covered in neatly arranged shelves, newspaper cut-outs, photos, even sketches and paintings. He couldn't even begin to guess what a blond man sporting an archer's kit had to do with chocolates, but he was the subject of several posted drawings.
"It's London," he said, mimicking Sirius's nonchalance. "There's always a pub within a three-minute walk."
The Aurors had gone, after promising to send over their most sullen guard, Auror Mendel, and ordering Draco to keep the savior safe for a few hours in the meantime. James soon declared his head buzz-free, indicating that Draco's special combination of potions and charm had worn off.
He pushes his shins down into the bed to gain leverage, pushing against Potter's firm chest until he gives. Potter lies back and Draco tips forward, and then they're in an all new position. A brilliant position—all Draco's doing, really—that allows him to pick up the pace.
In the memory, Draco started barfing slugs. In the pensieve, Auror Weasel laughed himself sick and had to be excused.
"This is personal humiliation, Draco!" she cried, lifting her face to stare at him incredulously. "They blasted his business for the world to see and you threw it back in his face with a shit comment and one of your little smirks!"
This time, the silence seemed charged with tension. Alec and Arthur shared another look, feeling nervous. Dad didn't often lose his temper, but when he did...well, Helen was built mostly to explore the full electro-magnetic effects of James Charming's emotions. And she was already smoldering in the pantry. Arthur idly wondered if Dad had even pieced together Helen's true purpose or if he still thought she was just a mascot that Alec had built for a laugh...
Twelve years of wondering and then forcing those curious thoughts to the back of his mind, and these people waltz in without a by-your-leave, invite themselves for tea, and spew a load of fairytale nonsense to entice his boys while saddling him with a past he didn't want anything to do with. A violent past. It couldn't have been anything else, he had always known that, but now he knew details. He didn't want details. He wanted to leave the flames, the screams, the blank, staring, dead eyes in his dreams where they couldn't hurt anyone.
When he could no longer read the words through his tears, he clutched the letter tightly and stumbled upstairs to bed. He would have to skip lunch with Hermione tomorrow if he wanted to make a new batch of Central America-themed chocolates for Malfoy. And he very much wanted to.
It had been a week. New Year's Eve was spent at Ron and Hermione's house. That was fun - George brought new tricks - but Arthur just wanted a normal Saturday night tonight. He wanted to make heaps of chocolates for Sunday's rush. He wanted Marge to bang on the shared kitchen wall when they played their music too loud. He would even endure Dad's ABBA albums, if that's what it took to set all this to rights.
"Trust the process, Haz," Draco murmured from beside him. "She's a mad genius." Harry peeked over and saw him looking perfectly at ease in his smart Muggle clothes, long pale hands resting on his pointy knees as if the traffic outside was no trouble at all to ignore.
A horrible twist is building up in his thigh and he tries to ignore it in favor of the brilliance going on between them, but it claws and coils and forces its way through his bliss. He hurls himself forward onto Potter’s chest, winding the oaf, as he stretches his leg out behind him.
The voice feels like a physical blow to his heart and he clenches the edge of the metal sink, willing it to fade or...or, keep going. He wonders who his addled brain has conjured this time. It doesn't sound familiar, which is brilliant, so brilliant. He's just decided this disembodied voice can stay when he hears furniture scrape across the concrete on the other side of his door.
He poured him a fresh cup and settled back into his chair at the head of the table. He noticed Mr. James didn't bother to say thank you either, but before he could think of how to broach the topic of these ill manners, Daddy changed the subject.
"Cannons," he agreed, before he could be swatted on the nose with a newspaper. "I'll acquire the tickets post-haste."
Downstairs, when he went to move the first piece of furniture, it occurred to him that this idea would be much easier to execute with his wand. But he had left it upstairs, stowed away in his sock drawer. Ah well. He would rather drag around a bit of old, fairly light-weight furniture than heave himself back upstairs to retrieve the wand.
"My workshop…" he breathed, his chest swelling madly at the thought of spending his days here instead of Sirius's musty old shed. He could spend hours upon hours here and not get used to the way the sunlight was streaming in at that angle through the window. A carousel-stand in the middle held a few old prototypes of his broom designs and Harry tore off his gloves automatically, already itching to start a new project, if only just to
"That's to fatten us up!" he cries, slinging out an arm to indicate the picked over desserts. "She said to stay in here while she prepares breakfast!
Though London's rain was only a dreary mist in this area, Harry quickly managed to spot a large, muddy puddle and had himself a grand time while Malfoy watched him with that wide-eyed stare. Harry barked a true laugh that came from deep in his belly. He kept stomping right on down the trench, running his hand along the ancient wooden fence, until he came upon a brick house, with no windows.
"Just like our sessions this past autumn," Malfoy said, "I'd like you to lay it out as a narrative. Don't concern yourself with whether something may or may not be important to Weasel. Just talk me through what happened."
"Sounds about right, for that one," Harry offered, and gods did he hope he was pulling off a casual tone. "The git can't go a few months without causing an international crisis."
"I thought he were a ghost!" said Ninian Jerome, a witch from London. "He didn't say anything neither, seemed jumpy if you ask me. I suppose that's to be expected, what with all the excitement."
"Cormac McLaggen. I've been in Sporting Goods for three years now. Actually, I want to expand what we do here, start up some fitness classes - "
He felt a wild bubble of laughter in his chest at the ridiculous problem that faced him at the end of a hellish 48 hours, a problem that had nearly undone him. How to get the infants home?
"Let's talk price range, and then we can look at some options," Malfoy said amicably enough and Harry allowed himself to relax.
“Remus?” Harry squinted at the thin figure standing off to the side. Sirius was still blubbering into his own arms, careful not to touch him. Harry felt a tad guilty about that and wondered if the Healer would go and tell her gossipy coworkers that he had snapped at his godfather. Wait… “Sirius! Sirius, you have to go! Now!” he whispered, lurching forward to seize him by the shoulders. Sirius froze mid-sob and peeked through his arms at him with watery grey eyes, not even breathing. Useless mutt! Harry turned to Remus. “Get him out of here before he gets caught!” he hissed.
And Harry's eager for his touch, even now. He clearly loves Draco's hand on the back of his neck as they lounge together on the sofa. He leans into it. His muscles are always knotted up after working a full day in the shop. Broomwrighting is hard, physical work, the way Harry does it: every handle carved by hand, sanded by hand, stained by hand. Every twig meticulously selected with Harry bent over the workbench, brows knitted in concentration. Every rise and fall of the hand-braided twine that weaves the twigs into a tight cinch. A certified Lightning broom dominates every custom-model market, and Harry's coiled muscles carry the price.
Monty heaved an exaggerated sigh, then winked at Alec, who relaxed marginally and returned to watching Minerva suspiciously as he picked at his plate.
"I'm starting the last round day after tomorrow," Harry said with a grimace. "Healer Wilkerson says I'm already of age, physically speaking."
He had found the proof he was looking for, but he didn't feel any better for it. Holiday shopping would help put a spring in his step again. He couldn't concede to James on the Malfoy issue, not after what he'd seen Saturday, but he could still show James a better Monty. A more committed Monty. He could show James their future, hand it to him on a silver platter so all he had to do was unwrap it Christmas morning and let Monty do the rest.
The embers are snuffed out. All that's left is ash and the reverence of what once was, and what might come.
Without a backup gift, Draco's birthday was ruined. But not as ruined as it would be if he arrived and saw this oversized disaster.
That look annoyed James at the time but later in the night it would haunt him. Monty was snoring away next to him, but James was wide awake. He was treating the man like shit, he knew. Pushing him away when he only wanted to help. It was in his nature to help, it was what made Monty
"Scam a seventh year," Monty stage-whispered. James glared at him. He'd known he would regret this one, but it was too perfect to pass up.
"What's the choice then?" Arthur translated, earning an arm pressed against his windpipe. James twitched as Arthur choked slightly, but he seemed to be able to breathe for now.
“Leave the mail,” she ordered. “I need a shower.” James wisely kept his hands quiet as she marched out of the kitchen and up the stairs, grumbling under her breath.
“Oh my fuck!” Sirius croaked, crossing his forearms against his pale, scruffy face, and wailing with abandon. The swear jarred Harry for a moment, making him forget about his window. “Oh my fuck, Remus, oh my fuck! Oh my fuck!”
The silence that followed was suffocating and Draco dearly wished it wouldn't be so telling to gulp down the entire pitcher of water, or perhaps attempt to drown himself in it.
“Why, my sweets, you’re wasting away!” she cries out, sounding withered and old once more. Her voice cuts across Draco’s mind like a knife and he feels a stab of concern—
He read it again, drinking in every word, every punctuation mark, every terribly-formed letter G. This was what he wanted, wasn't it? Another chance with Charming...and this time, it would be without that Gibbs fool breathing the same air. And an exhibit! Harry Potter wouldn't have been caught dead visiting a dragon art exhibit - perhaps destroying it with an actual dragon, Draco could see that happening, but to appreciate it? Never.
Six hours later, Remus hustled down a street teeming with couples, families, kids, and teenagers. The crowd around him moved lazily in the summer heat; people wandered aimlessly in and out of the quaint little shops and restaurants that dotted Bell Street. He tried not to get impatient, but intense smells and loud noises pressed in on him from all sides. His patched Muggle clothes scratched at his skin every time someone brushed by and he very much wanted to call it a day and Apparate back home to Teddy.
. He bustles about the counter, unlocking drawers and cabinets with a set of keys attached to his vest by a fine silver chain.
It's fitting, Harry will later come to appreciate, that the Days of Fin are his last in the bunker: Fin. Finito. Finished with this bullwinkle.
Its versatility and addictive quality made a fortune for sellers, but their customers never lasted long. The build up of toxins in an addict's body was quick, painful, and lethal. Recovery was long, painful, and often lethal.
Wednesday, Draco and Scorpius seemed to sense some silliness in the air as well; they were both in a bright mood and the trio only checked one house before detouring through the city zoo. And later that day, of course, after Sirius and Remus asked why he smelled like fish and he told them about the penguin exhibit, those two gits spent the rest of the evening waddling around and kissing each other like penguins. Did penguins kiss? Harry had spent half the afternoon in that exhibit and still didn't know.
“Your potions seem to be working well,” he observed. Six months on growth potions had fast-tracked the rest of his puberty, though he was still quite short. Sirius and Ron had quickly learned not to tease. “How much longer?”
"...I feel like I've lost the plot. I'm not used to this feeling, I'm quite astute, I'll have you know, I - "
Suddenly the gingerbread cottage seems rather less tantalizing, and the witch sees his trepidation. She nods her head sadly, then keeps nodding as if she can't stop.
Alec gave up trying to call his broom into his hand and simply bent down to pick it up. Next to him, Arty was a little more successful and managed to stoop down and catch the broom when it twitched a few inches off of the ground. Dad seemed to freeze when he saw his old broom and Alec just
His face twisted again and Hermione stared at him in alarm. The situation went beyond caveman communication; James looked as hurt by this as Monty sounded on the phone.
"Phantom pain," Malfoy said in that official Healer way he had. "You can read up on it if you'd like, it's fairly common. More so with amputees but you've always been exceptional." Malfoy blanched and rushed to say, "The exception to every rule, I mean. The odd one. Freakish, if you will."
"Before," he confirmed. They were just getting started in their long history of tormenting that little bakery that culminated in the jam incident that got James sacked. "Anywho, took five years tae catch tha' bird. Finally wore 'im down wae some erotic chocolates." Ron started choking on his breadstick and Monty flashed a winning smile at the table.
"It's a bit late to ask now, seeing as it's all over," Malfoy began with a weary sigh. "And you're quite right, Charming. We are not friends."
The Danny Days are long gone and Harry longs for a time when he was still in his captor's good graces. The man's patience has been worn thin after one too many escape attempts.
"Did you hear they lost Harry Potter again?" Scorpius said, breaking the silence and starting up his spins again.
Harry soon lost track of exactly how many properties they checked out that morning. Some were an instant, hard no - apparently "ultra modern" was code for "concrete block" - while others were simply...not a yes. He couldn't pinpoint what felt wrong about them and only offered half-answers to Draco's probing questions.
"Think on it, love," he said mildly as he gave the frosting another stir. "A just wanna give you something to do besides pine over Malfoy."
Alec sucked air through his teeth but still didn't step back. Good. He'd make a Gryffindor out of his brother yet.
he mocks. Draco rolls his eyes and looks up—cold blue eyes meet his through the slat in the door. "Potter!" he whispers urgently.
He staggered back into his bedroom. Alec seemed to know what he'd seen the moment he came in. A twin thing, maybe. He nodded. And then the tears blurred his vision and he lost sight of his brother. He sniffled a bit as a few tears leaked out, not quite feeling up to crying right now. It didn't feel right. Nothing felt right. Everything felt upside down and two inches to the left.
"Let's entertain the idea that you're right," he says slowly, eyes scanning the room with renewed interest. The red bricks match those that make up the fireplace in the sitting room, and isn't that a chilling observation. "And I'm not saying you are, but…what happens next?"
In a massive bookshop on the other end of town, he found an extensive business section. He spent nearly an hour roaming the aisles and pulling down books on entrepreneurial ventures and small businesses, accounting, even contracting and renovating.
Monty dropped the pot he was drying and it clanged to the tile floor, wobbling around on its rim until he stooped down to pick it up again. James squinted in
Throat feeling a bit tight all of the sudden, James nodded. The stag was small and delicate, he was almost afraid to pick it up again. But it had an ethereal quality, much like his old Patronus which he could suddenly see in his mind's eye so clearly.
Monty was taken aback for a moment at the ferocity of James's signing, but reminded himself that the man had been through quite an ordeal that day. He was cranky and he just needed to get home and rest. They could fight this battle another day.
The warding was fine. It was having a security wizard on duty that made him feel ridiculous, like a critical political figure who was intent on fucking off and making chocolates instead of buckling down and getting to work. More and more lately, he had admitted to Malfoy that week, he felt like he owed more to these people than to simply carry on with his chocolate. But he
Would you stop being a spikey little princess for three minutes and just tell her what you do? She'll probably be your cover if something were to
"Realtors," he answered. The word felt foreign on his lips and it occurred to him that he'd probably never said it out loud before. Remus paused minutely in his stirring before continuing with an air of nonchalance.
After everyone had laughed themselves half-sick and had come back down to earth, James lifted his head from his hands and glared at Arty, the fucking traitor. His eldest smirked at him much too proudly, basking in the glow of his stage time. James couldn't stand it but Arty hadn't actually done anything wrong.
"When your mummy stops buying sweets for you," Blaise argued, "you can say they're yours. When's the last time you went to..." he looked down at the label on the box, shiny gold script on red, "...Charming Chocolates to buy your own?"
"Do you remember how the heating charms on the house wouldn't hold, so we were forced to share a bed?" Harry asked innocently. Draco stilled.
"YOU KEEP WANKING IN THERE YOU'RE LIKE TO PULL IT OFF!" Sirius sounded halfway between a leer and a bark of laughter.
“Generations of jewelers in my family while your corporate daddy snags you a posh job selling third-rate rocks to old ladies! But you’re right," she scoffs, "I don’t know what I’m talking about because we don’t use
"And blingin' stress is bad," he summed up from many previous sessions. She popped her thumbs up into finger-guns.
Arthur winced and within moments another set of feet thumped down the stairs, a bit more gracefully this time. An identical boy - brown skin, black hair, wide eyes - dressed in more muted colors stopped at the bottom step, taking in the destruction on the floor with obvious distress.
Draco kisses his stupid hair and tries not to wonder if it'll be the last time. It's a test he can't afford to fail but there's no bloody manual for this, despite his clever words. He holds Harry against his side and feels him relax marginally. He cups his arse – in for a knut, in for a galleon – and to his surprise, Harry doesn't pull away. He turns into it. Right... Right. Draco knows this part. Maybe he's not quite as lost as he thought, though the endgame has changed. When they snog, it's soft and warm, then a bit more warm, and just as Draco thinks he's found his rhythm, Harry pulls back.
They crest a small hill and Potter clamps a hot palm over his mouth. Draco can almost taste the salt of his skin through his chapped lips and he has to reign in his tongue before it darts out to get a proper nibble.
how?!" He spent a rotation in Spell Damage during his studies and the memories of all those horrible injuries flooded his mind as he tried to piece together what had befallen James.
From a red and gold wrapped package, Monty unveiled a new creme brulee set, complete with a torch and extra butane, and a marble rolling pin. The handles of the rolling pin were stained to match the dark wood of the kitchen table.
James hardly looked satisfied with the reassurance. He surged to his feet, swayed dangerously, then seemed to think better of it and dropped back down onto the sofa. Draco snorted.
Depressive episodes brought on by daytime flashbacks, they'd touched on that in their earliest sessions.
“How old do you think we are?” Mr. Flamel asks challengingly. Minerva’s eyes widen slightly as she considers. The couple looks ancient. They seem to be competing for who can look more dead: frizzled white hair, skin so pale it’s almost blue, wrinkles on wrinkles on wrinkles.
"What did ye say?!" the man suddenly said in a booming voice that instantly cut off the boys' celebrations.
In the pandemonium - strangers grappling him, voices shouting over each other, the meager light of a grim sky burning his eyes - he latches onto one discernible fact: It's day. Not night. The sun is obscured, but that's fine because
"You're on a cushion on the floor of this space," she went on. "Find what that floor might be. Is it a luxurious carpet? Perhaps a rug on a hardwood floor? Or textured stone, or smooth tile?"
Harry broke off and scrubbed a hand over his jaw, knitting his brow as he tried to recall. Malfoy had warned them that this moment, the exact moment of Obliviation, would likely remain disjointed from the rest of that night. Harry was striving to cram together his brittle memories of two separate events, two separate lives.
Why was James doing this to him? Was he not enough? He was human, he made mistakes, and yes, he was prone to jealousy…but this went beyond his control. There was
He wanted Scorpius in that kitchen, laying out the silverware as he signed the proper words for each knife, spoon, and fork. He wanted the twins to hang onto his every word as he told them all about their father in the stupid years, when they fought on the Quidditch pitch and dueled in the corridors instead of putting their biting mouths to better use. He wanted his mother to relax, to stop asking after his family with a guarded expression, always prepared to hear that he'd
by now," he grumbled miserably. "I lied to you, about - about everything - my name, and - and I'm - I didn't mean for it to go on for so long, but I just thought - " Bricks and mortar, why was this so difficult? He'd had nearly five months to think of a way to come clean!
beside him, whether in terror or joy, Alec couldn’t tell. The broom felt too thin and small to hold him up. Death was imminent. He clutched the handle and prayed to the laws of magic-physics. He was trembling, shaking, his feet kept sliding off the hooks behind him. He just wanted to land, he could ask his questions from the safety and comfort of the ground!
He told him about all the awful things that had happened, from the moment they were disarmed to the mysterious case of the flaming shoe. He confessed his undying gratitude for that ruddy old crystal in James's shoelaces, the heirloom that had absorbed the blasting curse and saved his legs.
"You'll have to excuse me," a refined voice came from the parlor to the left. Harry quickly rounded the corner into the kitchen, following the sounds of Scorpius's stomping, and ran into a tall, thin man in a crisp checkered shirt with a thin tie.
"Sorry - Arthur got on his belly to watch from under the door," he went on. "Stuck his wand out and managed a good enough swish-and-flick to levitate that big heavy sales register over Monty's head. Cracked him right open which saved his dad's arse and gave Harry enough time to get the boys out."
"You're recalling how to say it," Draco observed. "You remember this spell?" A nod, but those eyes went back to studying the cane again. "How do you feel about this spell?"
"You've chocolate on your lip," he says gently. Potter darts a tongue out, but misses. "Here…" He reaches out and grips Potter's jaw, brushing his thumb firmly over his bottom lip, as he did earlier. The bit of chocolate smears. He leans forward. Potter's eyes flick down.
Harry launches himself at the stranger, clutching his dark red robes and burying his face in his chest as he pushes against him with all his might. Out, out, he needs to get out!
Sirius was guarding the "broken" floo, pretending to fix it, and Harry was hiding in his workshop, staring dejectedly at Luna's not-quite-right broom. He thought it could do with one more coat of stain over the bulk of it, but he'd already done the tail, so now he had to find a way to protect the finished twigs from the stain. There were far too many tricky charms layered into the tail for him to risk it. Perhaps he should just call it quits...but he was loath to deliver anything less than his best when Luna came round tomorrow.
As Tony approached with the vial, Narcissa snarled in a way that clashed strangely with her exquisite dress robes, but Nott gave Arthur a wrenching twist that had him crying out in pain. Draco pushed himself up, out of his mother's reach.
That wasn't always the case, of course. Pansy was a disaster. Greg was an awkward experiment – he shivers just to remember it. But he began to hit his stride in Blaise.
Ron blinked before the question registered. His head whipped over to Hermione - she was just as breathless as he felt - before he answered:
"So why aaaAAAH - " He gagged violently on the next one; it was too heavy to come up by itself so he was forced to use his tongue and teeth in order to give birth to it. "
"He's alright," Weasley began, eyeing him warily. He wore his Auror robe over bright orange pyjamas. Draco pulled to a stop at the bottom of the stairs, those words ringing uselessly in his skull. "But I thought you ought to get the story from me before you hear some half-baked rumor. There was an attack. Just an hour ago."
Midnight came and went, the boys were down, Monty was lying back against the pillows, but still he couldn't sleep. Malfoy had come over again that evening and he'd brought his son Scorpius. Hermione, Ron, Rose, and even little Hugo rounded out their party. Monty was a sucker for kids and spent much of his time listening to little Scorpius critique their cutlery while Rose practiced her signs for kitchen-nouns.
look at his pants… His slightly loose, bright red pants with little gold snitches fluttering around the band.
"Well..." she began, eyes darting down to James on the bed. James blinked owlishly up at her. He was full of blood replenishing potions and still out of it. There had been so much blood in the sink… "Our other theory would mean calling the Aurors in. So let's hope it's just a bad combination. Either way, we'll get you fixed right up."
While the entire bookcase was overflowing, the collection was meticulously organized and entirely free of dust, just like the rest of the flat. Words flickered through his head -
Dad pushed his fingers under his glasses to rub at his eyes. He was pale and hadn't touched his own waffles. Alec thought he looked a bit fragile, if it were possible for a human to look that way. Like the icicles on the awning outside the shop, the little ones that chipped off with a little
James cradled him on the beach. Arty didn't even look like himself anymore, he was shriveled up and tinier than ever, his unnaturally huge eyes staring up at him accusingly. Alec was still shrieking, James could hear him under the ocean waves - it was an ocean now, not a lake - and cold fear gripped him again... Alec was still under the water, he didn't come up with James, he would drown too!
"LALALALA!" Alec sang, dropping his fork with a clatter to cover his ears. That broke up the somber mood well enough as their guests tittered and blushed.
The living space faced a magnificent stone fireplace that reminded him of Hogwarts - of the Gryffindor Common Room, in fact. He wondered if Pansy had paid a visit and filed that delightful thought away for a laugh later. There was a huge, deep green rug in the middle, and - the sofa from Blupin Frottage!
A second round of suffocating silence. Draco swallowed and poured himself another glass, spilling over slightly. He mopped up the little puddle with a random bit of parchment, only to realize it was a patient intake form that had yet to be duplicated.
Harry screwed up his face at what he was now certain was an outhouse. As in, a hole in a plank of wood over a hole in the ground that never flushed. Outside. For once, Harry was faced with something that might possibly be worse than a loo-bedroom.
Harry grinned widely and M-- Draco checked his watch, a flash of regret in his eyes dimming the effect of his suddenly pink cheeks.
"Enough bloody puns!" he growled. "This hasn't turned out to be one of our better anniversaries, Potter, let's just get it done - whatever game this is - so I can go home." Preferably
"Where's the list of everyone who was there that night?" Ron asked, shuffling through the miles of parchment spread out on the conference room table. Rachel flicked her wand and a single scroll flew over to the wall. Another flick and she attached it there with a sticking charm. "Could've just handed it to me..." he muttered, stepping over to examine the list.
"Are ye?" he seemed delighted with the surprise. "An' what d'ye want wae ma boys?" The man lifted a section of the counter and stepped through, hurrying over to the door. In one smooth motion, he flipped the sign to closed and locked the door. Then he waved cheerily through the window at the disappointed face of a young woman on the other side. He was a stout man, average height with thick arms that were covered in coarse hair. Golden-brown curls on his head and rosy cheeks made him look like a child that had gotten hold of a wand and tried to disguise himself into an adult.
“Quidditch can heal just about anything." James would give him that one. He felt on top of the world when he flew. He wondered how a professional Quidditch game would compare to football on the telly…
could certainly use some." Ron furrowed his brow as Draco cleared his throat and raised his voice, carrying on louder and louder with each word: "It's his fault anyway! I invite him into my home - yes yes, I
But they find their perfect fit again. There's something awkward about it, something...expectant. Draco's expecting something, Harry's clearly waiting for him to
Alec reached out a hand and James yanked him in for a tight embrace, squeezing every bit of love and support he had into a single hug that had to last until
Harry signed something short and fast: a clear dismissal. The boys grumbled but got up from the table, leaving the room swiftly and retreating upstairs.
Potter is not shocked enough by the Muggle car that finds them in the depths of the Forbidden Forest. Surprised, certainly, but more relieved than outright shocked. Draco means to interrogate him, but then Potter drops this line:
James fumbled and dropped his colored pencil. It rolled off the table and hit the tile floor with a clatter. Arthur rolled his eyes and picked up his charcoal again, returning to his sketchbook as if he hadn't just dropped a nuclear bomb.
Then Narcissa was at his side, using a smart little cutting spell and summoning his shoe right off his foot. She doused his smoking sock with an
He heaved a great sigh and finally nodded, then turned to head for their room. He needed a hot bath. As he reached for the doorknob, he saw the white of an eyeball peeking through a crack in the door down the hall. Monty grinned over James’s shoulder and flashed a quick thumbs up. The eyeball widened and James frowned.
"Yes, thank you," Draco agrees readily, striding over and crossing the threshold without hesitation. Potter is wary, but he follows.
As it was, he only needed it in order to test the spell with a few words and phrases. And it worked! And he owed Abbott a heap of chocolate!
Healer Malfoy was so similar to and so different from the boy in James’s memories, the sneering blond git. James recalled Hermione slapping Malfoy once, though he couldn’t remember why. He probably deserved it. He was always saying shit things in James’s memories. Or seeming to. He couldn’t quite recall the specifics, but nobody sneered like that when dishing out pleasantries.
his boyfriend. The boys hadn't given any...any declaration of approval, or permission. They'd simply gotten used to Monty over the years.
"Yes," he says with a stiff nod. "Exactly like that." Draco opens his mouth to carry himself to victory but Potter interrupts. "I judged Slytherins, too," he blurts out. "Before I was sorted, I heard Voldemort—" Draco rears back on reflex "—came from Slytherin, and then I saw you sorted there so I decided to have nothing to do with it. I judged the whole lot."
he said after he'd set up his wand. She tried not to rely on the translation as much as possible, but he signed so fast and she couldn't get her eyes to stop reading.
He retreated to his bedroom - leaving the door open, as always, as if it didn't even exist - and read. As he read, his lips spread into a slow, wide smile that grew wider and wider until his cheeks hurt with the force of it.
. He felt at home with that name - he'd always liked it, ever since he spotted it on the long list of names at the hospital. It was yet another big deal to hear
Charming signed stiffly, stopping and starting as he considered his answers. Gibbs translated: “The nightmares’re worse now, more detailed. Sleeping less fer that. Eating fine - the liar, he’s no’ - an’ work is the same. No point going out wae the boys off at school. Been a real layabout lately if ye ask me, a - ”
Alec stood nervously outside the blanket fort. The multi-colored lights looked much better in the blankets than they did on the tree, much cheerier. Dad blinked again and swallowed. He pulled his arm out of Arthur's grip, resting a hand on his shoulder instead. Arthur felt a gentle squeeze and nodded to Alec, who lifted the flap to let Dad in first.
“Ron Weasley, twenty-five, been here seven years. My family’s all over Voldecorp. Well, Fred and George are still trying the entrepreneurial thing. But Mum’s in the deli, Charlie’s in Pet Supply, Ginny’s in Women’s, Dad and Percy are Corporate tossers, and my oldest brother Bill drives the armored van that takes the money away every week. We
James bumped him playfully and Monty wrenched his gaze away from the fridge to stare at the man. He was in a better mood today, thank fuck for small mercies. Monty had never before seen him shut down the way he did yesterday morning, after Monty went and cocked up a sweet surprise. He did feel bad for the way things went down, for the accusations he hurled blindly at James, but he also felt they had glossed over the core of the issue. He had promised to trust him, but James wouldn't even consider his side. He just needed James to see things from his side properly instead of chalking it all up to a caveman complex.
Harry's muscles jump and quiver in protest of the cold floor, but, as with the scratches on the walls, he welcomes any fresh experience, even the painful. He stares at a crack in the ceiling, wondering if it's grown, wondering if there's a fault line nearby, wondering if one day the ceiling will crumble down on top of him. He finds he doesn't even mind the thought, as long as he catches a glimpse of the sky before he's crushed.
"It's perfectly natural," she said simply. Harry kept staring up, wondering if his trembling legs would calm or collapse if he tried to climb. "Puberty hits, hormones pick up, and us mammals like to diddle ourselves when the mood strikes."
“M-my hair?” he asked, his hand automatically rising to smooth it over. It wasn’t as long as it had been before the incident, but he’d certainly cut it shorter than this in the past. After the war. He narrowed his eyes suspiciously. “Are you taking the piss, Potter?”
He didn't think he could take it if they laughed at him today. It wasn't fair. He was giving them what they wanted. He was doing his best.
Hermione frowned and grumbled, ushering Scorpius and Rose to the opposite side of the box. Turning his head one way and another as the two went on, James wondered if they were still insulting the players.
"That you had a confession to make, that your real name isn't Haz Blue - mind-blowing, that revelation - it's Harry Potter, but that you - " Draco cleared his throat again, going pinker, " - you like it better that I call you Haz. I thought it might be a...deadname situation, or something, to be honest."
"Against half-breeds, creatures—you know what I mean!" Potter roars, stopping in his tracks to level a proper glare at Draco. "It's the same thing!"
"Never saw 'im eat the treats, mind. Took 'em home instead, but he swore they were the most delicious he'd ever stuffed in 'is gorgeous gob. Now a crammed those biscuits wae butter an' sugar, but he never gained an ounce, so a knew 'im fer the dirty rotten liar 'e was. It wasn't til a happened upon 'im at the park one day that a knew he had kids, and lo and behold, there's both of 'em wae their fat little fists on ma biscuits!"
Care of Magical Creatures is a waste of time as long as a biased half-breed is the professor, in Draco's opinion. He's not particularly attached to this opinion, but he will defend it to the death against Potter's barrage of spluttering rage. The fight distracts him from the blustering December weather as they scout the forest in search of Hagrid's herd of thestrals. When the class finally comes upon the demonic beasts, Draco hangs back.
"Can you not do that, please?" Blaise asked, lip curling. Draco didn't even bother opening his eyes, he simply raised a finger, still cradling the truffle with love, and carried on with his savoring. "Not decent..."
James shoved it back across the counter. He wasn't hungry and he didn't want his damn muffin. Monty's frown deepened.
What we don't have is boys playing nice with each other.  Draco is a little hung up on some things, and Monty is pushing again, and James is confused.
Monty frowned softly, his eyes going all watery with concern, but then he set a timer for the oven and left.
A feral hiss and, seconds later, an ear-splitting meow rang out in the alley. There was a series of crashes and swears, and James smirked.
Unbidden, thoughts of his old friend Hedwig came to mind. She would've loved a roost up here. He hoped that, whatever had happened to her, she had lived a long, full life without him. Perhaps she was still out there, somewhere. Maybe she'd find him one day, if he stayed out here, free of the anti-owl wards of Blupin Frottage.
"A home that doubles as a shop, then," Malfoy said, noting it with the overly large quill. Harry nodded. "What sort of business?"
James never said no to that and by the time they made it home, he was exhausted and his whole body was screaming. He collapsed in a kitchen chair and summoned his pain potion for a premature dose, resolving to go to sleep early tonight.
"Disguises are elementary," Tony explained shortly. "You must recall your own disguises at the train station in September? It's no trouble." James nodded automatically, remembering a flash of dark blond hair in the compartment of Aurors. Of the three Aurors, he hadn't managed to disarm Tony.
He wasn't Draco's significant other or anything, not by a long shot, but he was through doing things halfway. His friendship was good for James and James would lay himself bare if that's what it took to make a good thing better.
Draco bends to retrieve a rag and a spray-bottle of blue cleaning product from a drawer. He sprays Harry fully in the face to get him to back up before dousing the counter thoroughly.
"Aw, tha’s the real end tae the jam incident," Monty said, waving a dismissive hand. "Manager let ‘im finish his shift then cut ‘im loose. Said it were a lot of bad publicity an’ she needed tae do somethin’ tae ease the customers’ minds. A reckon she was worried what the neighborhood would think, all those policemen fussin’ all night, draggin’ a brown man outa the store in the wee hours. But James needed a push anyway, an' he does better as his own boss. Plus the nanny wouldn' come back after twenty-four hours wae these two!"
James sighed. That was another thing they'd agreed on two weeks ago - they wouldn't dig themselves any deeper until after the holidays.
Potter shrugs, squaring his shoulders and lifting his head but still not looking at him. "They're not fond of…of things that’re different. Freaky."
Draco's perfect pink face scrunched in mock-disgust before he saw something in Harry's expression that prompted him to backtrack.
"Not too crowded in your hovel?" he couldn't resist asking. He hoped Scorpius didn't know the word hovel. Though his back was still turned, Draco could feel the anger radiating from the man. But it was the middle of the night and Weasley had woken them up because he failed in his duty to protect James - Draco felt he was perfectly within his right to push some buttons in return. Especially when it was so easy.
There, that shuts him up. Draco obstinately ignores the trickle of blood or sweat that runs down the side of his face in favor of smirking triumphantly up at Potter.
Unknown hands, strangers' hands that are so exquisite, so different from his own or Fin's, help haul him to the surface when his trembling legs threaten to give out on the steep ladder-stairs. He bangs his elbow on the trap-door, but doesn't feel it.
"Looks like," Arthur said as he tried to piece together the conversation from one side. Some of Mr. Malfoy's messages were pleading, some were sharp and antagonizing. All of the letters were painfully formal. Even little Scorpius had written, in purple ink:
Their bedroom was dim, Monty's lamp was flickering violently, and the bed was drenched in wet. For a moment, James thought one of the boys had snuck into bed after a bad dream and had an accident overnight, but that tradition had petered out years ago. So why was everything wet?
James ran his hands through his hair in frustration. He was shaking. They argued in circles, nothing ever got better! He either said everything wrong or Monty twisted it into something horrible.
"No, wait - Da'!" Arthur cried out, and James felt his heart stop. Tony grappled with Arthur while James surged to his feet, blood thundering in his ears, and then the Auror put a wand to Arthur's throat.
"No!" Narcissa cried, throwing her arms across her son's unprotected chest. Arthur whined and James jerked forward as if to stop whatever was about to happen, but Alec was still clinging to him and he fell back once more.
"You've always been independent, I just assumed..." she said. "I didn't - well." She swallowed past the lump in her throat. There had to be a way to work through this, to get Monty to see what James really needed from him. They couldn't just give up -
Sirius looked as though he was trying to keep himself from reaching out and taking Harry's hands in his own, and he stamped down his desire for the touch. He wouldn't like it. He never liked it, even when he wanted it.
Silence descended again and Remus watched Harry's face intently as this unspoken but definite line was crossed. He cringed, waiting for the inevitable explosion of Harry's infamous temper...
Harry jolts in his seat before shooting a look over his shoulder at Hermione, as if asking for help or maybe just solidarity.
As if reading his thoughts, Monty went on: "A dinnae mean to cut ye off from folks. Ye deserve yer own friends. A jus' think maybe married couples won' be as like tae take advantage, ye know?" Though muffled through the pillow, the words came through and sent James spluttering. "Harry Potter is famous, like it'r no', an' the whole world wants a piece o' ye now. When a saw all tha' work ye put intae that...that gift fer Malfoy, am sorry James, a lost it. A know yer better 'an that, yer no' the sort tae...well, ye know."
Remus thought they would, but a fire was in McGonagall's eyes and she seemed to grow taller in her seat. She pulled out the photo she had grabbed from her office and slammed it triumphantly onto the table, lips pursed around a smile as if Gryffindor were on the verge of winning the House Cup.
He seemed to have no control over his own actions. He watched his hands as they dug a makeshift grave for Arthur's transformed corpse. He kept digging even as he listened to Alec's screaming, wailing, howling, until all he could hear was the sound of the waves.
Percy nods, clears his throat pompously, and starts the timer on his watch before ducking his head to take the minutes.
Hermione threw back the last of her coffee, looking far less pleased with their efforts than Harry was. One day, he hoped, he would find a way to show her how different fourteen years was from an eternity.
"It's fun to rile him up. It's not that I like him, or don't like him, or whatever you've heard... I just like it when he goes pink."
"More floor space in the shop w'be a good practice run," Monty said amiably. "We cannae look at a full expansion if we've no proper idea of how they'll sell."
“He’s not the only one hungover,” Draco grumbled. Weasley led them through the locked door and called out into the empty shop.
He hates it here. He hates Denny. He hates the stupid screen that shields the toilet from view but doesn't actually offer any privacy when the man wants to spend time with him.
"Potion-induced hemophilia," Doctor Abbott declared. He rather liked this doctor when she performed James's physical back in September. She was able to sign quite well, having a Deaf father. "Did you bring a sample of the potions you're using?"
"If that's all..." Harry braced his hands on the cushion beneath him and, at Remus's nod of dismissal, pushed himself up and made for the floo.
"We'll get you home soon as we can, mate," Ron promised, apparently able to follow the signing well enough too. Monty's heart swelled up - Harry Potter, whatever he was wrapped up in that was still plaguing James, had damn good friends. He was glad to have found them, even if he could do away with the rest of the nutty magic world that was stealing James away. "Just a few more questions. Your potions were fulfilled by post, correct?"
This chapter took a long time (and a lot out of me) to write for many reasons.  There's so much conflict (James/Monty) and conflicting emotions (relationship angst/holiday fluff).  It's a tricky thing to write, to give weight to a two year relationship and seven year friendship without turning anyone into a raging supervillain.  I have a lot to say on their relationship, too much to type in the notes.  Dissect this chapter to your heart's content.  There's some intentionally squicky stuff I hope you'll recognize as Unhealthy Relationship Goop but also some gray areas I hope will confuse you, because real life is messy.
"James and a've been together for two years now," Monty explained, clearly thinking to clear up her confusion. "Known each other for a spell before then too - "
"You can't root around inside his head if you're looking for something more," she went on in a decisive tone, as if they'd already arrived at the next course of action. "He's not a crup and you're not his trainer."
Life at Blupin Frottage was a decided improvement over his last situation. Remus taught at Hogwarts during the year, popping over each day after classes, and Sirius practically ran Zonko’s by himself. The shed had been converted from its original purpose - motorcycle repair - into a broommaking studio. Harry was working on his fourth broom, which happened to be his first paid commission. All in all, he had no complaints.
"Are ye foolin' round wae Malfoy?" he barked. James gritted his teeth. Not this shit, not after the hours he spent breaking his back to transform his shop, not today!
A young man in a plain grey tunic sighs, tucking his inventory cart into a little-used dressing room alcove. He can hardly see over the sea of clothing racks, but he spots a shock of red hair and hurries over.
"Then we spent the summer recovering. Funerals, memorials...it was a difficult time, we were coming out of a dark period in our history and our world was rebuilding itself. Harry was just seventeen, but he was a legend. Not a person in our world didn't know his name. He'd always been famous, of course, but - "
It was strange to eavesdrop on people again. It seemed as if, since the dawn of time itself, he’d only ever heard two voices: his own screams, insults, and pleas, matched against his captor’s wheedling attempts to break him.
Shit hits the fan, goes down, splatters everywhere.  In author-terms, this is the "turning point" of the story.  So buckle up for the next 16k.
"The other side was led by a powerful dark wizard," Remus answered. "Called himself Lord Voldemort. To this day, most witches and wizards are afraid to say his name… Harry killed him."
to carry on with his chocolate. And Malfoy had insisted that it would be an abomination unto mankind if he were to abandon his work, so James shoved the feeling aside and carried on with the mail-orders.
And with that, Draco and Harry are left alone with only a brightly lit counter and a plate of Jell-O between them.
"Yes, I believe we can work on that," Draco said, putting on his best soothing voice. Apparently he overdid it because Pott -
Monty's attention was finally torn from Remus when Alec stood and raced around the table to the robot, bending down behind it and fiddling with something under its stumpy legs. A hiss of smoke came billowing out of its head, stinging Remus's eyes. The sparks petered out, the movements eased up, and the whirring slowed down into nothing.
Monty ate dinner in stony silence, watching James's hands as he tried to make conversation but only ever responding with noncommittal grunts and shrugs. It was out of character, even for an unhappy Monty.
All in all, with the added Slytherin company, things were a bit strange tonight. Blaise matched Seamus one-to-one on shots of exotic spirits, which sent little Seamus babbling all night and left Blaise standing suspiciously still. Dean was poking through the comics, sketchbooks, and coloring pages stacked up on the kitchen table. Harry and Malfoy were seated on the other end in a heated discussion on something he couldn't read in the translation from across the room - if Ron's knowledge of sign language could be trusted, it was about either plumbing or footwear. And Ron was pretending to talk to Monty who was pretending to listen while he peeled the label off a bottle of Ogden's and watched Harry.
"Because she's a young, pretty Pureblood girl," Draco said flippantly. "They like to see her at those posh academic galas in dress robes with her hair nicely done, but they won't bother to read her work."
, let - let me OUT, LET ME OUT!" his all-too-familiar plea is broken by crumbling sobs. The man's arms wrap around him and he smells like the outside world, like
, he should have toned down the shine, why did he try to show off his temper skills at a time like this?!
With great effort, Mrs. Flamel opens her puckered mouth and tries to speak, but coughs instead. The coughing persists, her withered old face turning purple. At long last, she manages to swallow and catch her breath.
He wondered at the Muggle man that stood behind the trio. He was the same height as Potter but twice as wide with brawny muscles and hairy arms under his fitted-and-appropriately-colored shirt. The hand he rested on Potter’s right hip was telling. So. Potter played for his own Quidditch team. Judging by the Potter-spawn, of course, he was possibly bisexual, and Draco wondered how long -
“--company than you ever dreamed you’d have,” Remus finished for him. They’d had this conversation before.
Monty raised his brows. He supposed this wasn't entirely a surprise. When Alec ran into a spot of trouble with his English teacher, who "didn't believe in learning disabilities," he went off the radar. Spent ages plotting his revenge, writing angry letters to the school, consulting lawyers, researching the mechanics of car engines in order to incapacitate the lout's motor once every morning, thus preventing him from getting to school for two whole weeks. Monty reckoned that kind of passion could easily translate into a publicity campaign for werewolf rights.
A wide and true smile spread over Draco's pointy face, bigger than any smirk or shit-eating grin or pinched laugh he'd shared before. His eyes squinted from the force of it, nearly disappearing between pink cheeks and furrowed brows. Draco laughed himself hoarse, hunched over and still cradling the travesty to his chest as if it were precious.
Draco was on his third round of checking through the month's supply of potions that would be shipped out to Potter when Blaise interrupted.
Harry's reeling thoughts came to a screeching halt, which meant the next thing he said was not his fault. "I've never snogged anyone before," he confessed. "I used to try it, sometimes, in - down there - in the - I used to practice snogging with my hand, like this!"
Sharp angles surged up into a peak, and a strong, thick beam of pine cut across the widest part. A humble chandelier hung overhead, three teardrop swoops of iron cradling several candles. But it was all nearly lost in the clear expanse of sky. Huge windows in the angled ceiling lit up the room spectacularly, like perfect rectangles of that singular blue that he adored so much.
"Harry disappeared July 1st. When James woke up, he couldn't remember his name but he thought it might be James?"
The wind battering against his eardrums was music, the early morning air smelled delicious, the pinkening clouds against the dimmest blue of a fading night was unspeakably beautiful, and the chill of it all on his back and face and arms, ruffling up into his sleeves, was nothing short of rapture.
Dinner was actually going smoothly thus far. Monty subtly reminded him (by signing for all the world to see) (and James could only hope that no one else except his boys knew sign language) (except there they went, immediately whispering to George and Teddy) that he had always harbored a fondness for redheads and so he must be thoroughly enjoying himself now. James, of course, began plotting his revenge on Monty. Chili-powder in his special ganache, that would teach him. Monty abhorred chili-laced chocolate as much as James adored gingers.
Harry sent Monty a withering look and started signing agitatedly. Arthur and Alec startled slightly at whatever he was saying and then Monty cleared his throat, looking chagrined.
Arthur was leaving the bathroom when he caught Monty in the hall with his suitcase. His face was red and splotchy. He said nothing. He put his hand on Arthur's head for a long moment, swallowed a few times as if he would speak, and then, he just...left. Down the stairs. Arthur heard the front door open and close. And Monty was gone.
Ron had to admit that he’d be lost without his duty-driven, protocol-following, uptight-wanker of a partner.
My eyes are crossing so I'll post this before my usual final proofread, and this whole story is unbeta-ed, so...enjoy some typos!
"Yes, you and your hysterics!" Draco waves in the direction of the door, where he smashed his head moments ago.
"Nice face, Malfoy—do you want to keep it that way? …Did you seriously take the last piece of toast, Neville? Bloody well died for your sins, mate…"
He decided, after much Inner Screaming, to ask Monty for help. The man was technically his employee after all, he could handle counting down the drawer and marking some notes. It took everything he had to sacrifice his pride, creep into the kitchen, and confess.
Not quite ready to return to the Land of Precarious Vats of Custard, Draco took his time exploring the Charming flat in a way he hadn't before. The hall was narrow and the mismatched furniture made everything feel crowded. But large windows brought in plenty of light, and bright colors made the small spaces feel warm and comfortable.
Heavily favoring his hip and feeling his own face grow more pale with every step, James limped from the room and hauled himself upstairs.
It’s nine o’clock in the morning and first shift is well underway when Lee’s cheery voice interrupts the soft, carefully inoffensive music:
And Harry explains. He says he's broken, “or something.” He says he thought he just couldn't keep up with Weaslette – and damn it all, the bitch scores just as he says her name and Draco slashes his wand at the radio. They're left in silence, Harry's words ringing between them.
Blaise's gaze darted down to the form as Draco lay it out flat to dry. His eyes widened in understanding.
"No memory?" McGonagall gasped. Remus felt his heart, which had spent the last two hours winding up tight like a spring, break to pieces as Harry glared at Monty, at McGonagall, at Remus, at the pantry, and finally at the table.
“Well, best get to it. Lots of paperwork this week.” He nods politely at the others before pushing through the door, which only opens halfway before crashing to a stop. “Mr. Malfoy! Are you quite alright? Did you need something?”
“She doesn’t mind,” Pansy says in a husky voice, crouching down beside the partially decapitated dummy while Hermione struggles to free herself. “She likes it rough.”
thatch?" Harry scrunched his nose when he laid eyes on it. It was a dazzling property with all the flowers, the bright stone path, and the bold lines of the house itself. But, "How d'you hear the rain?"
"Me?" Harry said weakly, mind reeling. Absently, he traced the rim of his own mug of tea, rubbing the pad of a finger over a chip in the lip.
but she really wants it - can tell a good cake when she spots one, good ol' lass - so she calls the manager over an' a explain it's fer James. Ma wee little bird flies in, dumb as dirt, actin' like he's never been wooed wae heart-shaped confectionary before. We end up in the manager's office, she's reaming us both out fer sexually harassing the elderly!" Monty shook his head. "Dunno how we got there, tae be honest."
"He'll be home in an hour with take-away," Arthur said, his Scottish accent much lighter than Monty's but still very much present. Frankly, it was surreal to hear that accent from a Potter clone.
in their interactions that kept him yearning for more. Blinging heck, it had barely been a week, but somehow Scorpius was precious to him already, and Draco was...sardonic, and annoying, and facetious, and such a doting father - to an actual child, no less! - that Harry
Silence reigned and Harry sipped his tea, longing for his toast, for his godfather, for a pickup game of Quidditch with Ron, Ginny, Charlie, and the twins.
"Erm, Da'?" Alec said lowly. The table was far too quiet now. James turned to Al expectantly, trying to ignore the staring. "Er, Arty's not the one who's afraid of cats..."
"I work in a variety of markets," Malfoy said pointedly, as if it meant something. Harry nodded dumbly. Malfoy looked heavenward as if praying for patience before angling his back towards the Muggles. With an odd little flourish, he used his pinky-finger to tap the card in Harry's hand twice. Harry's eyes widened with understanding, and he nodded again. He pocketed the seemingly non-magical card for now, until he could take his wand to it.
And today, after a meal as stiff and silent as a grave, Monty had sent them straight to bed like they were in trouble. Except Dad was in charge of their discipline, which meant...something significant, he was sure. They weren't in trouble, surely, not even after last night. But it seemed like it. They were banished to their room, no dessert, no telly. No explanation.
teasing you, in a friendly-banter sort of way, mind you, about your, ah...peculiar collection of housing requirements that we've uncovered these past few months." Harry's cheeks burned. "I'll admit, the story behind your preferences caught me off guard, but it all made
"Well, fancy seeing you here!" Beatrice called out from the front room, full of energy despite just having come back from maternity leave that week.
James hesitated. He had had it in his head that Monty was sour for being left behind to mind the shop.
Then again, he thought he’d matured enough over the years to follow at least one measly order from an overwrought Auror, so he obliged and left the mail on the table until she could check it for tampering.
"What?" Potter jolts, but remains crouched next to the door. The old crone examines the room eagerly but she must not be able to see much through the slat, for her eyes return to his after just a moment. Draco is rooted to the spot.
"I've got a team heading out to Monty's sister's place," he said, visibly trying to reign in his Weasley temper. "But I'd have a better chance of solving this if
In the wake of a question so similar to the one false-Blaise had asked a month ago, Draco fell silent. But that was all the answer so-far-seems-to-be-truly-Blaise needed. His friend settled back in his chair, all smug and shitty.
Draco swallows heavily. A bead of sweat drips from his hair into his eye, stinging and blurring his vision. He blinks rapidly, staring down at his wand in mounting horror.
Night fell and Arthur couldn't stand to look at his tattoo book anymore. This wasn't right. It was Christmas, they were meant to be in a sugar-coma by now, but they were staring at two half-finished sandwiches and mourning for Monty, who'd left. Left them. Seven years, and then he was gone with a suitcase.
"Here here!" Scorpius toasted, raising his green and silver teacup ceremoniously. Daddy toasted too, but Mr. James didn't, which was - "Rude..." he grumbled under his breath.
But it was too late. Arthur was clearly in the planning phase already and James just had to hope all ink stayed off his son's skin until he was older and a bit less stupid.
"Oh my god..." one of them whispered gleefully, turning away from the disaster that was Harry finding his old nemesis under a twinkling electric chandelier that was far too much for the kitchen.
Charming was funny! Potter had never been funny in his life, not once. Charming was witty and sarcastic and could be delightfully cutting sometimes. Potter was a blundering, semi-sentient Expelliarmus spell without an iota of humor.
"Draco, you didn't..." Astoria buried her perfectly painted face in her perfectly manicured hands and Draco felt a pang of foreboding.
They landed in a tangled heap on soft, muddy ground, the overcast sky appearing as just a ring of light above. Harry swore and Draco whined, their voices bouncing off the surrounding stones. His jumper was most certainly ruined.
"We want to learn magic," Alec said flatly. Neither of them were much in the mood to deal with their dad's weird issues. Arthur was 96% certain the other Muggleborns didn't have to worry about whether their parents would bug out and keep them home because of some dirty politics that went down a lifetime ago!
Draco rears back, looking at him incredulously. "You most certainly do know when and where your next meal is…at least while you're at Hogwarts," he adds, thinking of how dismally famished the Golden Trio had looked in May after spending several months on the run.
Draco loses his train of thought—shame, that—and stares blankly at the nutter with whom he's apparently negotiating a bed tonight.
this? Magic and warlocks and dragons seemed like a fantasy to Monty and the kids. And it should have seemed like that to James as well, but it only brought up his nightmares again, which were all too real.
James pressed his right pointer and thumb to the underside of his left pointer, then brought them out in the same motion he had just used in Draco's name.
“Oh no, this was last week,” Malfoy admitted proudly, sending James into another round of snorts and giggles. “You should try it actually. Quite refreshing.”
As he paused to rest - bloody hell, why was he so wiped? - Monty signed in the dim light of the hall.
"The Dark Lord..." he hissed. "Potter will come for his precious pet! This is Potter's, you said? Yes! He will come!"
In the memory, Draco kept his mouth shut like a properly defiant captive. In the pensieve, Draco smirked heroically over at Aurors Robards and Weasley.
His breath catches and then he falls apart in a whole new way. He's not sure if he's laughing or crying. He thought he'd won this one, but of course Ben has found a new key to unlocking his madness. He truly is sick of seeing the room, though, so the laughter wins over.
” The way he said it made it clear what he was thinking and Draco narrowed his eyes, considering whether it was better to play dumb.
“I just think everyone should be treated fairly,” sighs Cedric. “She’s always had it out for him and nothing ever gets done about it. Maybe if it’s documented, things will change.”
Nott faltered as he reached for Alec, seeing something in James's face that gave him reason to reconsider. James felt mad with fear and anger. He wasn't sure what he'd do, but he knew in that moment he was capable of anything short of growing claws.
Pink juice dribbles out of the corner of his mouth, blazing a sweet trail down his chin. Draco's trousers tighten at the sight. He leans into Potter's space, tilts his mouth, wets his lips—and just barely manages to stop himself before he can stoop down to lick up the sticky mess.
James gritted his teeth and rolled out from the pallet, crashing into the blanket wall and tearing down the whole contraption. The boys cried out and whined sleepily as pillows and cushions came crashing down on top of them, and still James kept rolling out to sea, wrapping himself in the sheet that was once their canopy.
He manages to flood his room once by pulling at the wrench-tightened pipes under the toilet until his palms bleed, but it isn't the deadly, time-to-leave-the-bunker type flood he's hoping for...just a cold puddle to soak his socks. He could do more damage if he left the sink running.
Four weeks. James wasn't sure whether he should be horrified or impressed at how long Arthur had kept a living, breathing, meowing, shitting cat a secret.
Remus lay the stirring spoon to the side of the cauldron and approached Harry, gesturing at the sofa. Harry blinked at the sofa, then at the fireplace, then back at the sofa. It seemed his trip to the magical branch of M & P Realty would have to wait. With a sigh, Harry threw himself down on the leather sofa. Remus joined him with decidedly less melodrama.
“We’re here to talk about things like this,” he said distantly. James nodded. It still felt as if he had crossed a line. “Was it her blood pressure?” He nodded again. “What happened after that?”
"Oh," Draco said, eyes sparkling. "My mistake. I've a friend in the Department of Mysteries, shall I call on him to investigate this pervasive illusion for us? Or shall we go upstairs?"
He stopped, feeling sick. Eleven years later, over a decade of reminding himself that he had had no other options, and he still felt like the scum of the earth.
"Fascinating," Draco said, turning the mobile over in his hands as Monty's garbled message played on speaker for the third time. "A clever little device, but it doesn't seem to work very well. Floo's still better by a long shot."
And exactly how quickly was possible? Alec wondered. He leaned forward experimentally and tried valiantly not to piss himself when the broom began moving. Arthur held a hand on Ron’s broom and the man guided him through the air a bit faster than Alec was going; they were turning, rising, and falling at random. Alec tentatively pulled on his right hand and wobbled over in that direction, nearly upsetting his balance. He resettled himself and watched as his dad flew by him confidently. He watched carefully...there!
Dad didn't say anything for a long moment. His mouth twisted at the corner as he chewed the inside of his cheek. Then he grabbed his cane, tapped his watch to indicate the late hour, and nodded goodnight to them, closing the door gently on his way out.
"What kind of person lives in a gingerbread house in the woods, Draco?" he says pointedly, but Draco misses the point.
Draco opened his mouth to let out a witty retort but none came, of course. The crafty bitch always tripped him up. Pansy was easier.
It suddenly becomes very obvious that everyone in the room is looking - but trying not to - at Harry, Hermione, Parvati, and Blaise. Cho and Pansy meet eyes, exchanging looks that are both relieved and annoyed. Harry sighs heavily and Ginny pats him on the hand. From the row behind them, Blaise frowns at the small touch.
"Not all of them." Potter abandons the next truffle back on the tray and turns his attention to the ground. He scuffs his filthy trainers in the cracks between the bricks. "Dudley's alright, I reckon."
Nobody believes them, of course. Pansy is in perfect agreement with Granger's theory that they simply poisoned themselves with hallucinogenic berries near the acromantula nest. When he and Potter present the ruined sneakers as proof, Granger counters with something clever about natural heat pockets. Potter nearly peals the shirt off his back to prove them wrong, but Draco stops him before he can back them into a story they're not ready to tell…
