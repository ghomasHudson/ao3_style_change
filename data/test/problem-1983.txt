‘You’re doing so great, love. But we still haven’t come and you agreed earlier that that’s not fair at all.’ Just Harry tells him.
‘You’re doing great, love. If you want me to stop, squeeze my hand.’ Draco doesn’t squeeze. ‘If you want me to go slow, you can squeeze my hand at anytime, okay?’ Harry strokes his hair, a gentle gesture that calms Draco. It makes him feel he’s in control of this.
Harry showed me the show last year, telling me that if I was queer, I should make myself acquainted with Muggle queer custom too. I enjoyed it immensely. I tweeted quite some nasty remarks about the clothing, singing and stage designs like a Muggle pro. To my surprise, my twitter exploded and people adored my snarky comments. Perhaps they aren’t as bad as I once made them.
Harry apparates them straight into his bedroom, already sucking at the mousse spots on Draco’s face. The spots are a reminder of their glorious sexual encounter and the hilarious food fight afterwards in restaurant the Ramblas. It makes Draco’s ludicrously spent cock twitch a little, just thinking about it.
‘I think Ron would help you. But I think we stand an even better change if we broadcast this.’
‘Remember to use them if it gets too much.’ Harry replies as he twists this thumb on Draco’s ankle bone. Draco yelps. ‘You have 20 seconds. Make good use of them’. Harry closes his eyes as Draco gets up and makes a dash for it. Seconds later he finds himself in the forest once again, his heart pounding and his head filled with anticipation. If only he could reach the outskirts of the forest, he’ll be safe. Luckily, his ankle still hurts, so he’s not as quick as he usually is. Draco smiles at his own thought.
Harry leans in and gives him a kiss. ‘You know I like you exactly for who you are, right? So tell me. It can’t be more kinky than the things I want to do with or to you’.
I see a man enter the stage. He takes his place behind a piano. He looks good. Friendly. And fit. The music starts, and I gasp. A chorus of angels appear to be singing, but I can only see the one man. The audience is cheering and clapping. And then he starts singing.
‘Don’t touch yourself yet. Wait until I’m enlarging.’
Harry watches as Bellatrix climbs up the golden rope. When he hears the rhyme, he knows he’s in a weird version of Rapunzel. He waits patiently before she returns, without her basket. Silent as a mouse, he follows her.
‘Harry?’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Well, I’ve received an invite to the Flagler’s ball.’
Harry looks at him surprised. ‘I believe you.’ And he does. He also feels drained. He should leave soon, or he’ll fall asleep sitting.
Harry rummages through the cabinets, finding ingredients everywhere. His names everything he finds and sings a song for them. ‘Pi-pa-penne will be muy bienne’. He feels silly, but Rose seems to enjoy it. ‘Pi-pa-peaches are so very sweetches.’ He starts cooking while Rose watches him. He hold some broccoli in front of his eyes and pulls them away. ‘Peekaboo!’
Malfoy grins and lubes his fingers and lightly rubs Harry’s hole. He shivers. ‘Fucking hell, Malfoy! It’s cold. Arse.’
‘Yes.’
When the oven pings, he takes out all dishes. He puts them under a conservation spell, with a small note in front of each dish, stating what it is. Then he draws a big heart and puts it in front of the cobbler and the roasted potatoes.
Harry feels someone chucked a bucket of cold water over him, his heart freezing. What if something happened to Malfoy? After the war, they shared a long and tender kiss, just before Malfoy got taken to Azkaban. Thanks to the fair trials, he got free. But he never replied to Harry’s letters, leaving him wondering if Malfoy regretted what happened. If something has happened now, he’ll never know if he’s the only one that felt a spark.
‘Will you distract me?’ He looks frightened but determined. Well, this is unexpected. I’m fumbling in my pockets, to see if I have anything useful there, when a very sinful thought forms. Who ever needed keys to distract? I nod and let him pull me into the elevator.
‘Did you kiss?’
‘Don’t be. Not your fault. Now, if the tea party is over, I’d like to fuck you. If, that is, you don’t mind. Or maybe you’d rather have me braid your hair?’
‘Seriously, give her my love, okay? Tell her I’ll visit soon. Tonight I need a quiet night. I’ve been far too busy these last weeks.’
Harry looks disgusted. ‘Really? Yuk. Which brother, though? I hope it is Bill. He has some awesome scars.’ A small smile tugs on the corner of his mouth. I throw my pillow at him.
He hears Harry’s footsteps nearing. Damn, he’s close! Draco presses himself closer to the bark of the tree.
‘What if we wait for Gin to come back up and go together?’
Malfoy blinks, before the meaning of Harry’s words dawn on him. His eyes turn feral. His teeth blink as he growls. ‘Let’s get you out of your cape, Little Red Riding Hood’.
‘Hi Lu! How are you?’
‘Draco?’ Harry looks at him inquiring. ‘Don’t overthink, love. Just tell me, okay?’
‘Don’t worry, Saviour. They’re spelled to endure all kinds of fluids.’ The Counts wiggles his eyebrows at him as he captures him in a long, intense kiss. Breaking it, the Count grabs a luxurious, posh bottle. He lathers his hands in lush, creamy foam. It smells of sandalwood. He turns Harry around and starts massaging him, his hands roaming Harry’s body, sliding over them. Taking extra care of his shoulders, back and buttocks. Harry leans into him, enjoying the softness of the foam and the strongness of the Counts hands. The unexpected kindness of his actions make Harry wonder. Does he do this to all his conquests? Or is Harry somehow special? He’d better not get his hopes up.
Ron takes her with him, apparating into the ministry. ‘Take care, mate’, he shouts, as he fades away.
What?
‘I told you it would be wonderful.’ Harry lubes his hands and continues fondling Draco’s butt, his finger mistakingly slipping in the perfect hole every now and then.
‘Such a lovely, little prey. As red as your cape.’ Malfoy starts unbuckling his belt. His hands unbutton his jeans, as he tugs out his hard cock. He puts his hand on Harry’s head and pushes him down. Hard.
‘I’m Drapunzel.’ He smiles tentatively. ‘Are you prince Harry?’ He blushes even further, crimson red spots showing. Fuck, Harry is screwed. He looks so deliciously innocent.
Harry moans my name as he’s coming. I want to watch his semen soil the bed, but suddenly I feel my balls tighten and my cock stiffen. Am I...? I feel my release wash over me, as I come untouched. Ropes of white, hot mess spoof over my legs and stomach. I scream, but the ball muffles my sound. I’m panting and drooling when I hear Ginny walk over to me. She gently unclasps the gag and carefully removes it. ‘Your jaw will hurt for a few hours, maybe days.’ She tells me as she strokes it. ‘Don’t be worried about that.’
‘I thought you had changed, Malfoy.’ He staggers up and makes his way over to the desk. He grabs it with one hand, as if he’s in need of support. He looks so vulnerable, so broken. I feel the urge wash over me to cradle him.
‘Such a Gryffindor. You want me to fuck you?’
‘Gross, that’s my brother! It’d feel like incest, writing that!’
‘Are you okay?’
‘Good for her. Does she know how you screamed my name when I penetrated you? How you begged for more? Or maybe you do that for her too. Maybe she has a lovely little strap-on she uses on you. She is fiery enough to do so.’
Draco starts thrusting his own cock, coming embarrassingly hard from the third stroke. Harry looks at him in appreciation. ‘You did so well, love. I’m proud of you.’ Harry cleans them both, windless and wordless.
Malfoy’s eyes soften. ‘I am not a monster, Harry. I will use lube. But I also will fuck that arse of yours. If you don’t want me to, this is your change to walk away.’ Malfoy retreats a bit, giving Harry space to get away. Harry’s mind whirls. Is he really doing this? He feels his arousal and something else. Trust. Hmm, strange. Where did that come from? He looks up at Malfoy, eyes determined, jaw set firm.
‘See?’ He looks entirely too smug as he resumes lathering my arse in lube and adding a finger, his other hand stroking my cock.
Harry looks up for a moment, as if he can’t believe this is truly happening.
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home
‘If you don’t want to continue, just revert to a normal blow or hand job. Both are equally fine with me. When I come deep in your throat, swallow hard, so you won’t gag. And trust me, you’re doing fine. If you doubt it, feel how hard I am. Don’t overthink. Yeah?’ Draco nods around his cock. The thought Harry likes what he’s doing makes him giddy.
‘Look at you. Begging for it.’ Harry kneads Draco’s cock as he clashes his lips with Draco’s. The kiss is aggressive and forceful. Harry returns to pulling down Draco’s trousers. Too easy, Draco thinks, I have to resist. He spits at Harry’s face and looks at him with as much challenge he can muster.
‘Maybe I did, maybe I didn’t. Maybe your thoughts are visible for some of us.’ His smile disappears. ‘Just be careful, lad. Don’t leave the path.’ The woodsman tips his hat as a greeting and briskly continues his walk.
I snigger and kiss his perfect, soft, tousled hair.
When late afternoon arrives, he forces himself to eat some hot, buttered toast topped with strawberry jam. It’s all he manages to swallow, his throat tight, butterflies in his stomach. Harry showers, brushes his teeth and shaves. He tames his long and curly hair and rubs some coconut oil in it, making him smell like beach and summer. He ties his hair back in a loose ponytail. He uses the gorgeous golden elastic ribbon Hermione once gave him for special occasions. It sparkles in the light and forms a pretty contrast to his dark hair.
Draco tastes a bit of pasta, its creamy, velvety texture melts away in his mouth, the rich, hearty, deep flavor makes him moan. ‘I would never have thought I’d be jealous of a strand of pasta, but here we are.’ Draco almost drops the bowl from shock. The dragons look at him angrily. He didn’t realize Harry had entered the kitchen. He looks up and finds him leaning in the doorframe, dressed in tight briefs, arms folded.
‘Do what?’
‘I’d forgotten how vocal you are.’ He pushes in deeper and deeper, and suddenly he’s at the right place. I see stars as his prick hits my prostate over and over again.
I almost choke on my tea. ‘Loves me? He has a weird way of showing. He could’ve had me then, without hesitation. But he chose you, Ginny. Not me. And now that you’re leaving him, I’m suddenly good enough?’ I feel my anger rising. She looks astonished. Maybe she didn’t expect Harry to tell me this soon. It deflates me a bit.
I nod, not trusting my voice.
Draco smells the musky scent of Just Harry’s arousal, making his mouth water. ‘I know. Maybe I could lick it?’ Draco manages to blush again, a nice dark red color that reaches his neck.
‘Did that feel like wrong to you, Potter?’
‘Yes, Harry’, Draco meekly replies.
I'm still fixing all the cracks
‘I didn’t hear the magic word?’
The Count looks startled. ‘I’m sorry, Count. I have to be at work.’ He casts a tempus. ‘Well shit, in an hour! And I can’t bloody well show up wearing that.’ He points at his clothes as he quickly gets up and dresses, casting some cleaning charms. ‘I’m so sorry!’
How many pennies in the slot
He vaguely hears her voice from the kitchen.
‘Yes, I do. You look fucking amazing, Gin.’
‘Draco.’
‘What will you be drinking tonight?’ Harry’s twinkling eyes search out Draco’s as the corner of his mouth twists up in an amused half smile.
‘No. I’m going to get fucking medical aid, as you so kindly suggested. If you want my arse that fucking badly, come and get it. Or just come fuck it in St. Mungo’s. See if I care.’ He hears Harry get up.
Draco fondles clumsily with Boy Toy’s prick. Boy Toy groans. Sexy Arse lubes Boy Toy’s cock and then his own, as he guides Draco’s other hand to his prick. Draco can’t hold back anymore and begins tossing them both off. The feeling of two velvety, smooth, swollen pricks in his hands makes him feel incredibly powerful. And incredibly aroused. So aroused, he’s on the brink of coming. Suddenly he feels something around his aching cock. Looking down he sees Just Harry has put a cock ring around his painfully swollen prick.
‘Well, auror?’ He steps back a bit, looking me up and down.
‘I don’t need your pity either. Please, leave.’ I stay where I am.
Of course he has bloody fucking checked the dates. I sigh too. And roll my eyes. That will teach him.
Huh? ‘What are you talking about?’
I feel his erection pressing through his trousers. ‘Merlin’s Cock, you’re gagging for it, aren’t you? Begging to get pounded in that arse of yours. How many men have you accommodated? Did you like it? Them emptying themselves in that arse, and you crying for it, like the defiled slut that you are?’ I grind against his hard-on.
Draco strides over to me and grabs my arse. ‘I’m looking forward to ravishing you.’ He whispers. ‘I wonder if you still scream my name when coming.’ I feel myself swelling at a dizzying speed.
‘Don’t worry, handsome. It’s been a while.’ I grab his arse and pull him closer.
Harry smiles, besides the dire situation he’s in. He reaches for Draco’s arm and squeezes it. ‘Not dead yet, only blind. I wouldn’t mind a kiss to take my mind off things?’ And yours, Harry thinks.
I swallow. ‘Please, don’t be mad, okay?’ My eyes are starting to brim up with tears again.
‘Safeword out.’
‘Dra-cooo. I know you’re there. Hiding is futile.’ He hears Harry’s voice. Thank Merlin, it is coming from a great distance. He hasn’t found him. Yet.
‘I wasn’t ready to share him, Draco. I wanted him all for myself. I was selfish. I see how much he hurts now. That’s why I came here.’
Suddenly he hears front office aurors Jaimy and Sybil approaching. He tries to close his legs, not wanting to have harry suck him while he helps them with an urgent incoming firecall. He feels Harry force his legs open. A soft whisper from under the desk follows. ‘Be good, love. Safe word out if you’re too uncomfortable. Or stomp your feet twice if you can’t speak. Green?’ He swallows. ‘Green.’ He breathes back as his cock is rock hard under the desk, hidden from view by Harry and the cloak for the front office aurors.
It’s always strange, being in someone else’s kitchen, but Draco makes do. He finds some tagliatelle in a cupboard, and some eggs, Parmesan, bacon, onions, garlic and cream. And an unopened bottle of dry Martini. Perfect! Draco cooks the tagliatelle al dente, with just enough bite. He chops the onions, fries them until they are tender and translucent. He sets them apart and fries the bacon to a crispy perfection, then adds a splash of vermouth. He lets it bubble away, allowing it form a thick, salty and sweet syrup. He burns his tongue slightly while tasting the hot goo. Fuck!
The count winks at Harry. ‘Well, Mispy, this one was too cute to let leave.’ He stage whispers. Harry grins as Mispy pours him coffee too.
Harry gets up swiftly, casts some cleaning charms and summons a set of clean clothes. He writes two quick letters to Hermione and Molly, telling them he’s off on an adventure. He fastens them to Woolly, his new and fluffy owl. He packs a satchel and fills it with food and a bottle in which he can keep his conjured water. He floos over to the manor.
I’ll put a longer one up later today (European time)
‘Let’s have some coffee, and then we talk.’ Shit, of course. Harry with his Saviour complex, of course he wants to talk. Well, best get it over with!
‘19, 20. Ready or not, here I come!’ Harry singsongs with a deranged cheeriness. Draco’s heart is hammering in his chest. He has to make his way back. Has to hide. He turns around and starts running again. His sides start burning. Hearing Harry coming his way, he abruptly changes direction.
‘Then let me help. I will show you just how perfect you are. I will tell you over and over again how gorgeous you are, how well you can follow orders. How I love it when your disobedience takes over. I will force you to do things, but you are the one in true control and can always, and I mean on every single occasion, tell me to stop. I will respect your limits without fail. I will take care of you, my precious thing, if you let me. Do you want that?’
He gets up and looks at Malfoy. ‘Thank you for making me feel, even if it was just for a little while’, he whispers as he wishes it would’ve been enough to let him live. He doesn’t feel anything as he picks up Malfoy’s wand and vanishes Malfoy’s body with a flick of his hand. Maybe next time, he thinks as he promises himself he will make an appointment with a mind healer tomorrow.
‘Excellent. Now back into character, Mrs. Potter.’ I stick my thumb in her mouth and feel around for hidden evidence. She sucks on it looking me straight in the eye. My cock stirs it’s neglected head at the sight.
Bellatrix picks up a mobile phone. What the hell? This must be how they stayed under the radar, Harry suspects. He hears her talking to someone.
Draco tries to relax his throat. Harry waits a moment, to make sure Draco’s ready, before he forces Draco’s head down again, pushing his hips up in sync.
Loving you is a losing game
‘It changed the day you walked in. Of course I recognized you immediately. But I knew I couldn’t hand you over. I couldn’t let you get slaughtered by our Dark Mad Megalomaniac. I was shitscared. It was the first time I began to second guess my mark. Of course the bloody Dark Lord was furious when he found out. He threw me in the cellar, without a fucking wand. They-‘ Harry is silent. He gives Draco’s thigh an encouraging squeeze.
Giving us up, didn't take a lot
‘Nope. Not gloating.’ He’s searching my eyes for deceit. I feel a small smile tugging at my lips. ‘What do your auror senses tell you, Potter? What’s the verdict?’
‘Now, kick it towards me.’
‘Until I move, I will continue to live in the house I live in now.’
Harry rolls his eyes when she isn’t looking. ‘Of course, love. Now sit.’ When he returns with the tea, Hermione is vast asleep, snoring slightly. He gently covers her with one of Molly’s quilted plaids. Then he takes Rose back to the kitchen. ‘Let’s make ourselves useful while your mummy is being such a rude host, falling asleep on me.’ Rose giggles and reaches for his long curls. She is in a playful mood.
He smirks. ‘Fuck, Harry. Do you need to ask? I feel so fucking recharged. And sore. Wanna do it again?’ Draco’s eyes twinkle mischievously
‘My, my. Kinky. No underwear.’
‘Thanks, dear. Dance?’ He holds out his hand. Harry grabs it without thinking.
The telltale sign of stillness warns Draco Harry’s on the edge. He starts swallowing, prolonging Harry’s release. Harry’s orgasm is intense, spurts of semen fill up Draco’s throat, warm liquid trickling down his throat. Proudly he realizes he doesn’t gag. His cock throbs, but Draco’s not sure if he is allowed to continue.
‘So I’ve been told on many occasions’ Harry tells him, as he takes him back in, inch by inch. ‘Fuck, Harry, are you...’. Harry grins around his cock, as he relaxes his mouth and lets him slide in even deeper. Adjusting for a moment, he swallows even further, until his nose is right up into Draco’s fine, blonde curls. Draco gasps at the way Harry’s tight throat feels. His cock twitches, making Harry choke.
‘Neither am I. But here I am. We’ll make it work. Please, Malfoy. Give him another change.’ She looks so sincere, so altruistic, it makes my throat tighten.
I tap twice. Harry grins a downright filthy grin as he gets in front of me and starts preparing himself. He puts one leg on the bed, so I have front row view. I want to moan, but the gag suppresses the sound.
Draco swallows. He would like that very much. But today he’s gotten desk duty. It’s not something he’s looking forward to, but he can’t let someone else take the unpopular job, just because he’s horny. He curses his own strong sense of responsibility. ‘I wish I could, Harry. I’ve got cellblock today.’ Every auror hates cellblock. They call it like that, because it’s like being in prison. The officer on duty has to file reports and be available if the front office has questions about incoming fire calls.
‘You keep surprising me, Saviour.’ The Count pulls out his cock again, looking at Harry with such lust, he feels himself go even redder. The Count lays down, leaning against the pillows. His hand moves over his cock slowly. He gestures Harry.
Harry softly tugs Draco’s hair. A tiny noise escapes Draco’s mouth. Damn, this feels so bloody good. ‘You like that, now don’t you?’ Harry pulls his hair a bit more forceful. Draco can’t bite back his groans as he shudders from the painful pleasure. He feels Harry’s cock pressing up with each noise he makes.
Harry sets a relentless pace. Ginny moans. ‘Would you like me to touch myself too?’
‘Red!’ Harry’s voice is clear and very normal, as he plops into view from nowhere.
‘Do you need a mediwitch, auror Malfoy? You look like you’ve gotten a fever.’ Sybil looks at him in concern.
‘What the fuck!’ Bellatrix screeches as she kicks around her to get loose. Draco holds her from behind. Harry bends over to pick up Bellatrix’ wand. With one last forceful kick, she manages to hit Harry hard enough for him to loose balance. Unfortunately, Harry is standing next to the window and topples out of it. He hears Draco’s primal scream and Bellatrix’ maniacal laughter while he tries to process what’s happened. His life flashes before him. He is glad to have found Draco. He might love him, but now he’ll never know for sure. Will never be able to tell Draco. Suddenly his head clears. He can do wandless magic! His cushioning spell misses, but he manages to conjure up some bushes. Thorny ones. Fucking fitting for a Rapunzel story, he thinks as he falls into a very thorny one. It hurts. He hears Draco’s voice from the tower, casting a full body bind. He should’ve thought about that himself, he thinks, before the world fades into black.
‘We skipped this yesterday, but today we’re going to try it, okay? Want me to ride it first? So you can see what it’s like?’
‘Ma’am, article 305 section b clearly states an auror can restrain a suspect when she’s a flight risk.’
Do you know the feeling when you're being chased in a dream? The fluttering feeling in your stomach when you wake, aroused and half hard? Well, this was nothing like that, Draco decided while hiding behind a tree, trying real hard to adjust his breathing. It was way more uncomfortable in real life.
‘While I appreciate your creative thinking, today I have something else in mind. Now watch.’ Harry gets up and whips the omelette out of the pan. He halves it, and puts one halve on a plate. Harry sits himself back on the chair and starts eating. ‘Hmm, Good.’ He makes indecent little grunts while he eats. The grunts set up camp in Draco’s rapidly hardening cock. Harry groans appreciatively as he finishes his plate, licking his lips clean.
‘Right. I’ll be off then. Will you firecall the aurors? Let them post here, until we are back.’
‘The first time I got raped, I felt sick and threw up. Countless Death Eaters and other fuckers came by after that. They would come alone, at night. Some were gentle, almost kind. Some weren’t. I would still feel filthy in the morning, but the initial shock had worn off. It was better than being Crucio’d. After a while I started to enjoy myself. I liked the feeling of being helpless, being overpowered. I got aroused when they forced me on all fours, when they hit or hexed me. It made me harder than I ever was.’
What? Did Draco just hear Harry telling him he finds him arousing? Hmm, maybe he did read the signs right. Maybe he... ah... oh... Harry’s palm searches out Draco’s hard on, making Draco’s train of thought incoherent.
‘Fuck.’ Malfoy stands and rubs his hands through his hair. ‘I never do this, Potter. I just kill and leave. It’s what I do. This... it’s just a fucking diversion.’ He walks back to the recliner and picks up the magazine.
‘What. Is. The. Consequence?’ Harry’s eyes flare up.
In which Draco is too eager for pureblood customs, but decides to screw it all.
‘Top? Bottom?’
‘Auror Malfoy, will you talk some sense into him?’ Sybil sounds exasperated as she enters first. Sybil and Jaimy always bicker like a married couple. They would indeed make a lovely set, both equally feisty and arrogant, he thinks, as he feels Harry’s lips enclose him.
‘Oh sweetie, we can’t have you waking your mummy.’ He smiles and does a silly dance, distracting Rose. ‘You’re just as curious as your mom. You can’t wait to go and explore the world, can you?’ He spells the chair to wobble softly, hoping it’ll soothe her.
She doesn’t do it. She’s going to put up a fight. It’s a good thing she’s not looking my way, because there is no way in Hell I could hide the lust that’s rushing through me.
‘You take this ride then, and see if I care if you don’t come out in one piece.’ He makes a face at her.
He narrows his eyes, only to widen them, brows shooting upwards. It’s comical to look at his rapidly changing features. But I’m dwindling. If I want to know if we’ve still got a change, I need to focus. My hand seems to have a mind of its own as it wanders to his unruly mop of hair. It’s still as soft as it was then, a few silvery strings making it even more beautiful. My other hand travels from his chin to his hip. He catches it and weaves his fingers through mine, The feeling of his hand on mine sends magical shocks through me. He pulls me closer with his other hand.
Without hesitation I fling my mouth to his. Before I know it, we’re kissing fiercely. Both struggling to get the upper hand, not letting the other win. Sometimes the sex is like that with us. Competitive, but ludicrously hot.
Malfoy just smiles a crooked smile. ‘You did well, now let me help you get through this’. He touches Harry’s hard prick, stroking it softly, slicking it. Harry groans, discomfort forgotten. Malfoy sets a steady but agonizing slow pace. The forest is quiet except for the slopping sounds and Harry’s heavy breathing. He groans as Malfoy keeps stroking him, while he gently moves his cock inside Harry’s hole. ‘Please, don’t stop.’ Harry’s voice comes out lower than he ever thought possible. ‘You feel fucking incredible inside me’. He watches Malfoy’s eyes darken as he keeps on stroking his cock.
I should apparate, but my head is spinning. I’m too shellshocked, apparating is not safe. I decide to walk. Every step clears my mind a bit. When I’m close to my home, I see Mrs. Potter walking down the street. Too late to take a detour, she has already spotted me. I wonder if she really knows.
He hears Draco cast a strong silencing spell. Something is wrong. He is awake, but the world is still dark. ‘Dray?’ He manages to whisper.
‘What’s the matter?’ Boy Toy asks.
He enters, looking around. ‘Nice shed you’ve got’. A smirk is playing on his lips. He’s challenging me.
‘Labyrinth of Jareth.’
We were always a losing game
He presses in, slowly, his eyes never leaving mine. ‘You love this, don’t you?’ I bite my lip and nod.
‘Yep. I’ll tell you all about our good family name and the lovely Malfoy deeds.’ Another snort follows. ‘But not today, Harry.’ No, Draco thinks, not today. Today he has other things to learn and discuss. He casts his eyes downwards. ‘Today I really need to discuss precautions.’ Draco swallows a he looks at Harry through his lashes. He feels his heart beating so loud, it almost explodes in his chest.
Harry raises an eyebrow. ‘Why the fuck do you care?’
‘Same if you get too aroused and need to stop.’ Harry adds. ‘We’ll practice first.’
Harry looks away. He feels tears welling up. ‘It’s my first time’. He blushes. He’s had sex with countless, sometimes nameless girls, but never with a man. With men, he’s only had quick encounters in dirty loos, on his knees on sticky floors. Sucking, but never fucking.
She grins. ‘Just like you, Draco Malfoy.’ She is right. I wouldn’t have missed my time with Astoria for the world, nor my dear Scorpius. If I was even forced to choose between them and Harry? I sincerely don’t know which choice I would’ve made. We drink our tea in silence, both contemplating our families. The thought strikes me I still don’t know why she is here.
Draco can’t stay into character anymore and grunts and moans as he is taken apart by both men. ‘Fuck, more. Harder. Yes!’ He mumbles between breaths as two Harries slam into him, forcefully.
‘Anytime today would be great, love.’ Harry teases. Draco picks up his cutlery. ‘Nope. Filthy boys are not allowed to use tableware of any kind. Put that obscene mouth of yours to use.’
‘Yeah. You might want to explain why you’ve kidnapped me and put me in a tower in a dress and made me perform fellatio on you?’
Finding his voice again, Draco replies. ‘Yes.’
‘You, you’re Boy Toy’, he tells Harry number one. ‘And you’ He makes eye contact with Harry number two. ‘You’re Just Harry. Is everybody clear?’ All three Harry’s nod. ‘Good’. Suddenly Draco realizes he is in control. It makes him feel brazen. An interesting scenario plops up in his head, making him giddy with want. Can he play this part? He will try. He just hopes that Harry picks it up.
The ball is in two days! What do yóu hope will happen at the ball?
Are you just as nervous as Harry? I know I am.
‘Yes, thank you Mispy.’
‘Ah, I see. You do remember. Did I repeat my warning tonight?’
‘Hello, ‘Mione! Want me to come over and help?’
Draco tilts his chin up, his posh voice holding as much challenge as he can muster. ‘You would fuck me right here on the table between desserts’
Draco’s volume increases. ‘Do you freaking hear me, Harry? I got randy as a teenager by being fucking forced balls deep! Who in their right state of mind finds bloody pleasure in this deluded shite? I fucking hated myself for being this twisted, sick cunt. Who for fucks sake likes being fucking raped?!’ Draco realizes he’s shouting. He stills, shoulders slumping as he buries his face in his hands. Shame washes over him. He’s sure Harry doesn’t want anything to do with him, now he knows how sinful and fucked up he is.
Returning his attention to the Count’s leaking erection, he tries to swallow him down even deeper. He chokes a bit. The Count moans when he does. ‘So tight.’ His hands guide Harry’s hair up and down in a steady rhythm. He takes him in as deep as he can, savoring the feeling. Suddenly Harry stops.
‘No?’ Malfoy looks a bit setback, shoulders drooping a bit.
Draco looks frustrated. Can’t Harry see he’s hungry? Harry picks up a gloriously bacon wrapped date. The one Draco had his eyes on. His mouth starts to water. He narrows his eyes to slits. The nerve Harry has, picking just the piece he wants.
‘I know you’re here.’ Harry’s voice has gotten closer. He can’t see him. The bloody bastard must’ve put on his invisibility cloak. Cheater.
‘I don’t know what came over me, mother. I’m so sorry.’ He sobs a bit. ‘Thank you, mother, for combing my hair.’
‘I must file a report.’
‘Love, how can you know you don’t want it, if you’ve never tried it before? It’ll be so good if you let me. And you’ll let me, because you’re such a good boy and you’ve been so good to us. Now let me return the pleasure.’
He fills the basket with a bottle of red wine, a flask of homemade lemon-strawberry lemonade, ginger buns, a fruit cake, some more chocolate cookies and a few apples. Now only for the flowers. The fuckers only grow in the enchanted forest next to Molly’s cottage.
Harry gets on his knees and closes his eyes, waiting for the inevitable. He puts his hands in his neck.
“Take my place.”
His heart did somersaults in his chest, and he tried to hold his smile but he couldn’t, so he turned it into a smirk as he turned around to face Malfoy.
“A brave greedy man could rob a bank.”
I think was justified to ask for even one comment before posting another chapter, when normally you are required to pay $5-$25 before reading a book. And you most likely looked for the reviews to see if it's worth reading.
Harry caved to his own selfish desires and quickly kissed him. Harry pulled back and in fascination watched the array of emotions that went through Draco’s face. At first nothing but a faint sleepy smile as he almost leaned back in, but then he sleepily looked around and in Draco’s eyes he saw the realization of what Harry had said and done befall him. Draco blinked himself awake, his faint smile dropping as he quickly got up to his feet. “It’s morning.”
Draco didn’t look at him, only at the plain, gray, brick wall which hid a bunch of Slytherins behind, he sighed, “Cunning. Ambition. Which of those do you think makes us evil?”
“Hmm?” Harry had a feeling of what he was agreeing to, but he needed to hear it. He also had a feeling that Draco knew his ‘hmm’ was said with all intentions of goading that out of him if his glare and response were anything to go by.
It was an easy thing to say, for a stranger who didn’t know much about Harry but wanted to comfort him anyway, and it kind of worked.
He sighed, “Don’t rush.”
“Hermione, you’ve read every history book that Hogwarts uses. You could give the class yourself. You don’t need to pay attention.”
Harry just gulped.
After the game, while everyone went inside the tent to celebrate the win of Ireland, Ron grabbed Hermione’s elbow and dragged her away from the crowd along with Harry, who gave nothing away with his expression, but deeply wished he could narrow down his reveals to one person per night.
Draco nodded, sighing as he said, “Except those that need-to-know?”
Draco noticed Harry when he was a few feet away from him and looked at him apprehensively when Harry sat down next to him, straddling the bench, a determined look on his face. Draco nodded, “Potter?”
He knew Dean and Seamus accepted it with no question when both realized that they had each other on their wrists. They are now the best of friends and are appropriately growing into something more. That both had some pureblood family names in their opposite wrists that were once suspected of being Death Eaters.
So, after years of giving him only long-sleeves hand-me-downs from Dudley, so that he would hide his wrists, they began to give him regular summer clothes -- hand-me-downs -- and Harry had to figure out new ways to hide his wrists.
Draco nodded, “Can I go now?”
Suddenly Neville, the twins and Ginny reached them, none of them stopping, just pulling the trio along with them. They dragged the trio for a few feet before Harry pulled Neville to a halt.
Hermione did not raise her head from the bed and at the angle she currently was, face down on the bed looking away from them, Harry couldn’t pin down what she was angling for.
Seamus shrugged, dropping on his bed, “Not for our sake, but for hers. I’m sure seeing a few cocks is going to traumatize a girl like her.”
“Let me tell you, Amos, my boy tells me that when that ‘attack’ with the poor hippogriff happened, that the Malfoy son, walked up to it and attacked it to anger it. Hungry for attention that boy is. Just like his father, if they’re not the stars of the show, no one else-”
Roll Credits. Wink Wink
Ron shivered, “Still, she should not be so nonchalant about it!”
Harry huffed, not adding anything to the conversation. He hated that. He wanted his friends to be happy no matter what, but it made him bitter how easy it was for them. So he tried not to focus too much on it.
Fucking Lucius. If it wasn’t for him he’d be pushing all of them away and asking Draco out himself. Make it as public as possible. Hermione joked in History class that Harry just wanted to mark ‘his’ territory. Fuck it if she was right. Fuck it if he was territorial. Fuck what people thought.
-> I had originally planned to write a book per chapter. Book 1-2 = Chapter 1, Book 3= Skipped, Book 4=Ch. 2, Book 5=ch.3 etc.
Hermione closed her eyes in defeat and sighed, nodding.
Hermione quietly groaned, trying to ignore their whispered argument.
Harry laughed internally as Ron turned around and buried his face on his pillows, apologizing for letting it slip. Ron moaned into his pillow before sneaking a glance at Harry, relaxing as he saw that Harry wasn’t glaring at him. “Just explain it to Lefty.”
Sometimes he hates his blush. It shows up at inconvenient times, making him feel like a love struck teenager. But not wanting to blush only makes matters worse, so he’s long ago learned to just give in to it. Let it happen, there’s nothing that can change it anyway.
Harry’s sudden outburst startles Draco. Meekly he enters the office. Harry’s strictly gazing at him, over the rim of his glasses. ‘I’m sorry Harry, I was in a hurry this morning, I forgot to pick out another set of clothing. I’ll be changing in my auror wear now. Okay?’
To get back at him, I thrust my tongue in at full force. It elicits a perfect moan from him. Our tongues are playing with each other, seeking each other out, checking if the right spots still are the right spots. It’s strange, kissing someone you knew intimately long ago. His hand grabs my arse, while he grinds his cock against mine and my brain shuts down.
‘Would you like to close you eyes?’
‘Perhaps someday is sooner than you think.’
‘No, you’re not.’
It surprises me that the gesture comes so naturally and doesn’t make me feel awkward at all. Maybe Ginny is right, maybe I’ve got more love to give than I realize. I look at the two of them and know I’m the luckiest wizard alive. I pull them together in a hug.
‘Draco. Dray. Draykins. Please show yourself. I’m not going to hurt you, love.’ Harry’s feigning a sweet voice. Next he will get threatening, Draco knows. But this time, he won’t get caught.
‘You wish. Malfoy.’ Harry takes a step closer, wand pointed at Malfoy. ‘How...’ he falls silent. He hasn’t gotten a clue what to ask first.
‘I’m counting on it.’
‘What if I did? My stuff is for sale, auror Malfoy. Whoever pays the price, can have some.’
‘You can’t hide from me, Draco.’ A shuffling noise comes from close by. Draco tries to  make himself smaller as he hears Harry’s footsteps on the other side of the tree. He holds his breath, which proves to be extremely difficult if you’re still panting from the run before.
‘Malfoy. Come in.’
Draco squeaks. ‘No fucking! You promised!’
Harry looks his way, even long after the mist swallows Malfoy. Determined, he puts on his clothes and walks out of the forest. He’s got a new goal in life. First: get Molly her sodding basket. Second: fight for werewolf rights. And he knows just the person to help him. He starts whistling. Maybe life will get better. Once the unfairness about werewolves gets out, maybe he and Draco have a chance.  He’s just got to be the woodsman who hunts down the truth and slices open the belly of the ministry to reveal it.
Fuck! He sprints away. He hears Harry’s footsteps nearing as he makes a dash for the border. Of course he’s too slow, with his ankle still hurting, and he feels Harry closing in. He runs into a clearing. The light filters in through the trees, shining in bright rays on a patch of daisies. I looks soft.
He picks up his phone and dials. ‘Hermione? I need justice done. Can you help me? Yes? Bring your axe. We’ve got some ministry wood to chop.’.
Harry looks at me like I’ve gone mental. His nostrils are flaring a bit. That’s not a good sign. It’s just as bad as swearing.
‘Please, Harry, put your cock in her.’ I stroke myself and moan.
He does that twisty thing with his tongue, that always makes me a bit dizzy when he blows me. I moan. And that’s my mistake. Because of the moan, I don’t hear his wandless spell. It’s an admiringly Slytherin thing to do.
I bare my teeth in a growl. ‘Too late for that. Turn around and hands behind your back.’
That I may climb thy golden stair!’
Sitting down on the bed, he feels his cock ache. He imagines how prince Harry would come up and would stroke his cock. Maybe he wants more for saving him. Don’t all men want to have intercourse? He should be accommodating to show his gratefulness. Drapunzel gets some lotion from his dressing table and reaches between his legs, feeling his hole. Experimentally he dips his finger in, while stroking his cock. Oh, that feels good. It’s been a while since he’s been well fucked, he thinks and immediately wonders where this thought comes from. One finger become two, three. He scissors his fingers a bit. The pleasure it brings makes him bite his lip. His breathing quickens as his hand flies over his cock. He thinks of prince Harry bending him over his sofa and fucking him raw. His orgasm takes him by surprise as he spurts long ropes of white spunk all over his hands and the floor. Slightly embarrassed because putting his fingers in his hole felt so lovely, he cleans himself and the floor up. He applies some perfume Mother gave him behind his ears. It smells of lilies. He likes it.
‘At first I thought it was just some porn you read when bored. I understand, Gin, your sports injury makes you restless. I really do. But this? You didn’t only read it, you created the fucking stuff!’
‘Don’t be considerate. Use me.’
‘What? Oh no! Malfoy, not what I meant. I meant please, come visit me sometimes in London.’ The relieved look on Malfoy‘s face tugs at Harry’s heart. Harry winks. ‘I’ll open my wards for you.’
‘Yes, I want you to help me.’
‘Damn, Draco. I would never! I meant what I said to Drapunzel. I would never intentionally hurt you. I... I really like you, okay?’ Harry feels a blush creeping up.
‘I agree with your lovely wife that we need to discuss our triad regularly, to avoid misconceptions. Our feelings should be a principal discussion point, to prevent any of us from having undesired thoughts.’ I hum.
‘Hrmph’.
Get me off this roller-coaster
Mother looks at him sternly. ‘That’s better.’ She gets up and leaves a basket of stale bread and water. She pulls Dray’s head back, using his hair as leverage. It hurts!
Harry stays deep in thought for a while. He knows she’s right. Ginny would hate to see him waste away. He crumples the letter and tosses it in the trash. He’s going.
He turns around and walks away. Not even looking over his shoulder. I break down. I’m crying like I’ve never cried before. Everything comes out all at once. Everything that was, all the could have been, all that’s lost. I pull my knees up and rest my head on my knees. I must let this uncontrollable grief out, or it’ll suffocate me.
‘Hello to you too.’ Harry manages, a little startled.
‘Want me to do all the hard work, Potter? I never knew you were this lazy. You’d better make it up to me later.’ He thrusts in. I moan. Again. I moan louder.
‘How do I know you’ve had enough?’ Harry asks after a long, comfortable silence.
‘Dray, handsome, hundreds of muggles make use of this every day and there never is news of someone dying.’
‘Well? If you want to come, you’d better take off that poncy shirt. Or maybe you’d rather have me take it off for you?’ Draco starts and stops in his tracks again. His own indecision frustrates him.
Malfoy’s tongue flicks down, between his cheeks, until it stops at his hole. He circles the puckered hole, before dipping in. Harry moans, wanting more. The wet warmness of Malfoy’s tongue makes him squirm. Malfoy pushes his tongue in again, fucking him with it. He whirls it around, exploring the ridges of his hole. Harry has to force himself to stay still, as he wants to move so badly to feel more. Just as he is as open as he thinks he can be, Malfoy removes his tongue.
‘Why don’t you beg? It’s what they all do.’
We sit down in the muggle restaurant. Thank goodness he didn’t take us to a pub. I would’ve been ludicrously overdressed. He looks at me like I’m the most gorgeous human being on earth. It delights me, until I realize he looks at at least one other person like this. It brings me down to earth quicker than a dragon with wing cramps.
‘Oh dear, I must’ve forgotten. What about that time when Bill came in while we were-‘
‘Precious? What’s wrong?’
Malfoy flops down on the sofa, his elbows on his knees, hands twisting. He looks in deep thought. Suddenly, he looks up at Harry and asks: ‘Do you think Weasley would listen to my story?’
‘It’s okay if you don’t want it, hun.’ Ginny tells me.
In which Harry floos Ginny, who does her best to keep her jealousy at bay.
‘Let’s talk...’
‘Will I see you again?’
I feel the cold edge of the desk as I thud into it. Draco is so close, I can see the fine lines near his eyes and mouth. ‘You want some nice sex? I’ll give you an owl address. They have lovely little playthings, that would gladly suck off the Boy Who Lived. But I’m not one of them. Not anymore.’
‘I CAN’T HEAR YOU’.
That’s when I know it’ll all be alright. It’ll be hard work, but it’ll be alright.
‘If you don’t reply, I’ll take it as a yes.’ Bloody auror husband. Knowing me through and through. The door opens and I hear the floor boards creaking. The bed sags a bit where he sits his muscular butt.
Dean shakes his head. ‘Well now, I’d best start tailoring the best suit ever. What’s the dresscode?’
‘When?’
‘It’s perfectly fine to gag or moan, it feels marvelous from my side. Don’t think you’re doing it wrong. If the feeling gets overwhelming, touch yourself, your own pleasure makes you more relaxed.’ The ministrations from Harry’s long, slender fingers feel incredibly soothing.
‘No- ah...’ he stomps his feet twice. He feels Harry stop immediately. ‘No, I’m fine. Nothing a pain potion can’t fix. Thank you for your concern, auror Smith.’ He looks reassuringly at her. She nods. Draco tentatively reaches one hand under the table, seeking out Harry. He finds his head. Or he thinks it’s his head. He pushes him back onto his cock. ‘I’ve gotten a GREEN potion that does just the job.’ Taking the hint, Harry resumes his ministrations. Draco can almost feel him smirking against his hard prick. It feels so hot and sinful.
Suddenly he hears his floo chime. ‘Harry!’ It’s Luna. He answers.
Harry retrieves his quill for him, and as he gets up, he wickedly checks out Draco’s crotch area. ‘I see. Your way of telling me thanks is unorthodox. A “Thank you, dearest senior auror Potter, for going out of your way to help me, before my muscular butt splits my way too tight pants.” would have sufficed. By the way, those trousers aren’t really suitable for chasing suspects, are they? I expect a better choice of clothing next time’. Harry gives him a stern look.
I stay quiet for a bit. Let him sweat on it.
In which Draco contemplates.
I sigh again. This will be a long day. I’m considering my options when a kind looking elderly muggle couple come up.
The Count looks at him. ‘You don’t like it?’
I close the distance between us and take a swing at him. My fist cracks on impact. His jaw makes a crunchy sound. I look at him intensely. Will he use his word?
Ginny undresses me in the chair, while Harry tests the ropes. He is doing it the muggle way, which is tremendously arousing. He tugs the ropes, gauges their flexibility. When I’m starkers, he ties me up, so my hands can’t reach my cock. He leaves plenty of room for my legs to move. ‘Try it, please. Can you stomp?’ I put my foot down thrice, creating three clear thuds.
Ooh, ooh
Malfoy removes the safety. He looks torn apart.
Harry looks intensely at him, slight concern fleeting over his face. ‘As we haven’t discussed any safety precautions beforehand, I’m going to ask you just this once. Are you okay with this?’
Harry shakes his head.
Ginny raises her eyebrows at me, knowing after living together for half a year now, I have a better change of talking some sense into him on this.
Checking one last time to see if the monitoring charms are working properly, he steps into the floo. ‘Auror’s Office.’
He gently cups his cock through his underpants, feeling it swell at the prospect of a good wank. He pushes up his sweater, letting his other hand slide up to his nipple. He bites his lip. What would he like Jareth to do to him? He pinches his nipple as he pulls out his cock. Would he want Jareth to suck him off? Or... would Harry rather be fucked by him?
‘Yes, please.’ The answer comes too quick, to eager. I support her as we walk up our garden path together. I order our tea as she settles down onto our garden bench.
‘Always such an eager thing.’ Harry feels the amused smile through his closed eyes. The Count starts thrusting, softly and gentle at first.
Harry’s eyes defiantly flick to Malfoy’s. ‘Don’t you fucking dare judge me.’
If he looks deep inside his heart, he knows he isn’t. No, he must never tell him who he is. Let him remember their tension and the wonderful fuck they had. Even if that means he can never see him again. It’s for the best.
Well, duh. Harry thinks. It’s a ball for singles... He decides against telling him that. ‘Yes.’, he simply states.
Harry nods. ‘Would you mind bringing over a basket to cheer her up? We could put in some of those cookies you made yesterday.’ Hermione is already filling up the compartments of a large wicker picnic basket.
This elicits a dark chuckle from Draco. He tries to get up. ‘You hurt me all the time. You get off on it. I get off on it. No big deal.’ His face distorts when he puts pressure on his ankle.
Harry bites his lip and looks away. He is right. He didn’t offer anything. He just got freaking turned on from a gun to his head. He should’ve talked to that mindhealer when he had the chance. But as his life is probably ending soon, he’d better not waste the time he’s got left analyzing his feelings.
‘Fuck!’ I see her on the ground, face screwed up in pain, her hands grabbing her knee. I remember the Prophet writing about her injury. Took one too many bludgers to the kneecap. I walk back and help her up.
Draco clutches onto me. ‘No Har, please, don’t leave me here alone.’
‘I couldn’t if I tried. She’d see right through me.’
Harry knows what’s coming, he feels Malfoy’s cock getting bigger as the blood is rushing to it. Malfoy is thrusting and panting, his breathing becoming erratic. He grunts and growls. ‘So tight. So fucking lovely. Fuck. Harry. I’m coming.’ Harry feels Malfoy spurting come in his hole with a sinful low groan. He is so hard himself, it hurts. Malfoy turns Harry around, pulling him onto his lap. His cock is still deeply buried in his arse. The bigness of it starts to hurt, but Harry knows he can’t get out yet. He feels panic rising, but Malfoy strokes his hair, tucking it behind his ears. His hands trail downward, stroking Harry’s chest and tweaking his nipple, pinching them. Harry gasps. Malfoy lubes his hands with a wandless, wordless spell.
Draco? Not Malfoy? What the fuck is coming?
Spent, they lie on the recliner for a little while, waiting for their breathing to even out. Malfoy gets up and casts a few cleaning charms. He dresses and tosses Harry his clothes too. ‘Mustn’t leave evidence.’ He half-jokes. The atmosphere changes. Malfoy looks at Harry from his standing position. Harry watches him as he picks up the gun. ‘I’m sorry, Harry. I really am.’
Draco sobs. ‘I was so afraid. I thought I lost you.’ Harry feels Draco’s arms wrap around him. ‘And I don’t want to loose you.’
I nod, Gin too.
That I may climb thy golden stair!’
‘Have you seen yourself? You already are.’ He tweaks my nipple underlining his statement. I gasp and indeed, I writhe.
Harry holds up his hand, immediately silencing Draco. ‘You wíll get yourself ready, or I’ll be fucking you unprepared. And I’m not small.’
Suddenly the ground is being pulled from under him, as Harry tackles him in a move a professional muggle rugby player would be jealous of. He swirls around as Harry pins him to the ground.
In which Draco and Harry play rough.
‘Harry?’
‘But, Harry, you can’t be...’
I’ve seen her naked before, it’s unavoidable when living together, but I’ve never seen her breasts this perked up, nipples hardening as Harry sucks at them, his hand stroking her other nipple.
We resume kissing, removing our last garments. His hands stroke my cock, that is already embarrassingly hard. He whispers a spell and I feel the coldness of a slick lubricant on my cock, balls and arse. I yelp. ‘You could’ve warmed it first, you prick!’
‘I can’t hear you.’
Harry immediately starts stroking him again, while pounding inside him. ‘Green?’ ‘Green. Don’t stop.’ Harry starts hitting his prostate. Draco whimpers. His body is shaking from exertion. Harry holds him up with one arm as he keeps on stroking him, his virtuous fingers flying over his cock. Draco sees stars as he starts feeling his pent-up release build up. His body stills. ‘Oooooh- fuck’, he sobs as wave after wave of semen pour out of his cock, splattering the tree and his stomach. The pleasure is overwhelming. He feels his cheeks get wet and realizes he’s crying. His legs give in, leaving him hanging by his arms, still trembling from a mind blowing orgasm. He thinks Harry comes too, but he’s not sure, as he passes out.
Laughter instantly fills the kitchen. I’m glad to realize they chatter away together. They seem to be getting along much better than I hoped for, sharing the same twisted sense of humor. It eases my tension.
Fuck, they’ve planned this. This will be brilliant, my mind supplies, as I feel my knee pits bump into the chair.
‘Distracting, what does it look like?’ I grin as I kiss him, my hands caressing his arse and lower back. He moans into my mouth as he is kissing back. Before we know it, the elevator stops and with a loud ‘ping’ the doors open. I see Ginny standing outside the elevator, grinning broadly. ‘That’s clever, luv.’
‘Good?’
‘Really?’ Harry quirks up his brow. ‘Not even when I tell you I have a potion which can dupe- or triplicate me for an hour?’
‘Oh, Precious’, the Count lets out a loud laugh, throwing his head back. His hands move up to the ribbon in the nape of Harry’s neck.
Selfless love is more Harry’s thing. Not everyone is as generous as Harry Potter, not everyone has as much love to give as him. Even my bratty Hogwarts student self knew how unselfish this man was and bullied him with a hero complex I now recognize as an altruistic desire to help and love. We must be careful with him. Of all three? I think he’s the most likely to get hurt.
‘Yes, dear nephew. Do that. Please. I’m sure you’ll enjoy your time in Azkaban. Say hello to that sorry excuse of a father of yours there, will you? While you’re being raped by the entire death eater population?’ Bellatrix spits at him.
‘You should’ve thought about calling me such a nasty name. I am not a liar. I think I should punish you for your foul mouth’.
‘Oh no, auror. You caught me.’ She turns around, looking innocently through her fluttering eyelashes.
Malfoy’s look is smoldering. ‘Yes, Potter. I’ve been offered. But you’re not doing exactly that, are you? You’re not offering at all.’
The Prophet tells me Harry is happy with her. I’m glad. I wish nothing but the best for you. Every time I hear Duncan Laurence on the wireless, I think of him. Of all we could’ve had. I cry every single time. When I meet him on all the sodding social events we go to, I nod politely. I see in his eyes he doesn’t understand. He doesn’t need to. He’s never loved someone in a losing game. He’s happy now, and that’s all that counts.
‘No, you fucking idiot. I’m disappointed. I really like this scenario and want you to take me by force. I was ready for getting hurt, I have been aroused ever since you proposed this fucking role play, okay? When I stepped into that hole, all I could think about was you taking advantage of it. Pinning me down to the ground. Pressing your thumb on the sore spot and making me- aaaah’ Draco can’t finish his sentence.
My throat feels drier than a freaking desert. I lick my lips. ‘Are you sure?’
‘As much as I like you begging, it is too late for remorse. What’s your safe word?’
The waiter returns and collects the mostly empty dishes. Harry orders the chef’s dessert. Harry refills Draco’s wine, who sips it contently. There are pink spots on his cheeks. He enjoys his post-orgasm bliss, it felt so good to come. Shit, Harry. Without warning, he feels his happy mood slide away.
Opening his eyes, Harry replies. ‘Would you please just get on with it? I get you want to punish me, but please don’t draw it out.’ He is surprised how calm and collected he feels at gunpoint. Not feeling anything has become his second nature.
‘Have fun!’ I manage to squeeze out.
Ron looks like he wants to protest, but when he sees the tenderness in Draco’s eyes, he agrees. ‘We’ll take care of Bellatrix.’
I start searching the garden methodically. ‘Wait until I’ve got you, you filthy slut. I’ll show you what it is to be fucked by a real man, not some junior auror.’ He has hidden himself quite expertly. No sign of him anywhere.
‘I must ask you: do you want the gag?’
‘Oh-Kay. Just don’t fuck me, okay? I’ll do whatever you want, just don’t fuck me. I’ve never been with a man before.’ Draco manages to let his lip tremble a bit. Just Harry looks at him like he’s a tasty morsel of treacle tart, ready to be devoured.
Harry makes his way down, stroking the towel over the back of his legs, getting on his knees. Draco’s cock is dangling in front of him. Harry gives it a tiny kiss. ‘So irresistibly handsome.’
‘It’s Mrs. Plymouth again. She thinks her neighbor has eaten the neighborhood’s stray cats. All five. We all know it’s her fucking prejudice. She just doesn’t like that Mr. Adrien is a werewolf. But he’s on wolfsbane.’ Harry uses his hands to stroke Draco’s cock. It feels great. He has to use all of his willpower to even out his breathing.
Draco swallows again. ‘I... I like being overpowered.’
‘msorry, will leavezzoon’ He yawns. He wants to get up, but the chair feels too comfortable to part with.
I circle him, and stomp my foot into his knee pit, while pressing him down, my thumbs piercing the hollow under his collarbones. Not able to hold himself up, he falls to his knees. I take out my cock and get in front of him. I grab his hair.
Looks like I won’t have to wait too long, as I feel Harry’s prick swelling and hardening, his pace becoming more erratic, his breathing uneven. He moans, as I circle my clit with renewed vigor. I feel my nipples hardening, my mouth twitching, my jaw tightening (for as for as you can have your mouth tightening with one very hard cock shoved in it to the hilt). I’m so close.
Inside I die of sniggering. That bloody perfect wife of mine. Of course my outside doesn’t show. ‘I think I might’ve heard of him, ma’am’.
‘Would you like to watch? Harry and me, I mean?’
‘I am sorry sir. What do you mean?’
‘Yes, that’s what I’m talking about. Now, down with you.’
‘I’ll be off. Best of luck! I’ll think of you when I’m biting in my avocado salmon nigiri.’ He ducks as Ron swats at him.
‘Do you want to have a cup of tea? I live here, you know.’
‘Excellent. You boys do that. I’ll just watch from behind.’ Sexy Arse gets on his knees next to Boy Toy. Draco doesn’t know where to look. Two swollen cocks, dangling in front of him. Alternately he takes them in his mouth, sucking them, licking them, fondling with them. They both grab his hair.
‘What are you doing?’ He squeaks.
Drapunzel hears his mother and lowers his hair. He feels strange. Like this is the first, but also one of unnumbered times.
Of course Malfoy notices it too. His eyes roam over Harry’s cock. ‘Bloody hell, Potter.’
‘Yes, really. You’re so pretty, I would like to kiss you. May I?’
‘You cannot come from friction. You have to come from watching. Understood?’
The portkey transports him into a small booth. Mirrors surround him. He waits a moment to let the dizziness wear off and checks his outfit. Retying the ribbon in his hair and checking one last time to make sure the mask is securely in place, he exits. A long hallway with many booths like the one he just came out leads to an enormous, oaken double door. It’s plated with golden latticework and leads into what Harry suspects is the ballroom. He makes his way over to it, his stomach feeling jittery.
Harry’s voice pulls him out off his spiraling thoughts. ‘Dray, you’re doing it again. Please, just listen to me.’ Harry grabs his chin and turns him to face him. ‘I really like you, love. I want to see as much of you as I can. I want to take care of you. Want to spoil you. Want you to feel at home here. Want to have kinky sex with you, but also make love to you and cuddle with you. You’re perfect. Am I understood?’
Ron and Hermione are ever loyal at his side, even now. He knows they want to get a place of their own now ‘Mione is pregnant, but he also knows they don’t want to leave him alone. He feels guilty for being the reason they don’t start their family in a new home. But he doesn’t know how he would cope without them. They’re his purpose now.
‘It’s the notes section of my iWiz.’
‘Well, here goes nothing.’ Harry reaches out to the portal, his hand slipping in with ease.
‘I’m not. But I wouldn’t mind.’ He turns his head back to Malfoy and sees his own arousal reflected.
‘Never!’ Draco stares back defiantly, slightly tilting his chin. Harry grabs Draco’s hair and pulls back. Draco moans as Harry licks a stripe in his neck, finishing with a bite. Draco’s cock is so fucking hard, it feels like its ready to burst right out of his boxers.
‘Potter, why isn’t anything ever easy with you?’ Malfoy looks at him in exasperation before he closes the distance and hauls Harry to his feet. Feet not working properly from the awkward sitting position, Harry stumbles. Malfoy throws the gun onto the sofa as he pushes Harry onto the recliner and straddles him. He captures Harry’s mouth in a rough kiss. Harry opens his lips to give Malfoy better access. Malfoy groans as he plunders his mouth.
I’m sorry... I promise to make it up to you in chapters to come, okay?
‘Bring it on, auror.’ She smirks. ‘Auror, If I suck your cock, will you please let me get off with a warning?’
Finally, I see him stepping up the walkway. His tread seems lighter than it has in years. I take one look at his hair, unrulier than ever, and his swollen lips and I know.
Harry closes the distance slowly, eyes never leaving Draco. ‘Gods, you look so fucking pretty.’ He strokes his hair and lightly presses his lips on Draco’s. A familiar yet totally different kiss follows. Harry’s tongue trails Draco’s lips. Gently, he gives Draco’s lush bottom lip a bite. Draco gasps. Harry’s tongue uses it to enter Draco’s soft, needy mouth. Draco whimpers in his mouth, the sound goes straight to Harry’s cock. When air is needed, they break the kiss.
‘None of your fucking business, auror Malfoy’, he hisses. ‘Just fucking do it already.’
Still daydreaming about Prince Harry, Drapunzel chooses a high waist renaissance gown. The top is a light apricot color, trimmed with golden braid. The front has an inset of beaded fabric in an intricate lily pattern. Its long, gauntlet sleeves have a slight poof at the shoulder. The skirt is a beautiful apricot and cream striped fabric, with a weaved through golden thread, trimmed with pastel green braid. It’s full skirt rustles as he puts it on. He laces up the back with a pastel green satin ribbon. It fits perfectly.
‘Ouch.’
Tentatively Draco takes the tip of Boy Toy’s cock in his mouth. Boy Toy grunts appreciatively, as he stays very still and let’s Draco decide the pace.
He dries the front of his legs, leaving off at his feet. Harry gets back up, leaving a trail of slow butterfly kisses, worshipping his whole body. The kisses go up from his foot, his lower leg, knee, inside of his thighs. ‘So intelligent, hardworking, reliable.’
Harry shakes his head again, eyes never leaving the Count’s. In for a Sickle, in for a Knut, so he decides to be bold. ‘I’d like you to...’ He bravado falters as he blushes again spectacularly.
‘Smug bastard.’
‘Oh, yes. Just like that.’ My voice comes out hoarse.
Ginny has the gag in her hands. ‘Ready?’
‘Watch yourself come.’ Malfoy’s gruff voice almost sends him over the edge. Harry is so close, so fucking close. Malfoy rocks his cock again and that’s it. Spurts of white spunk stream out of Harry’s cock, covering his flat stomach and Malfoy’s hands. His heart is beating so fast, it feels like it wants to leave his chest. Malfoy holds up his hands in front of Harry’s mouth. Is he really expecting...? Fuck it, Harry thinks, as he opens his mouth and licks his own come from Malfoy’s hands.
‘I’m going to search you now.’ My hands start at her sides, gently tapping from top to bottom, making sure I “accidentally” touch the sides of her breasts every now and then. I take a good while to search her legs, starting at the ankle and working my way up. I’m circling her thighs, raking my fingers up and down. I hear her whimper.
Sudden realization dawning on him, he asks ‘Harry?’
He really is seriously pissed now. I can tell. Okay. Only one way to go now. I’ll just dust off the hysterics. I’m sorry dear, but you asked for it. I pout my lips, as I angrily seize the iWiz out of his hands.
‘You do realize I’m a werewolf now? That means when I start, I can’t stop.’
‘But it isn’t fair if I’m not getting off, don’t you think? We’ll have to think of something else.’ Just Harry eyes him expectantly.
Draco’s eyes shoot up. ‘Really?’ A hopeful flare lights up in his stormy grey eyes.
I'm afraid of all I am
‘Mrs. Potter.’ I give her a courteous nod when passing.
‘Ouch!’ Harry falls on his knees.
‘Then why are you so upset?’ Harry asks.
As Harry enters the ballroom, his jaw drops slightly. A lush red carpet leads into an opulently decorated room. Glistening icelike chandeliers are hanging everywhere, their crystals tinkling and glittering. White candles are flickering in it, wax dripping down, forming beautiful creations. Shimmering crystal balls float everywhere, giving the room a dreamlike glow. Stunning marble pillars carry the roof. The walls are covered in black silk backdrops. Enormous mirrors hang where the windows probably are. In front of a wall is a tall, antique clock with 13 numbers on its dial. Harry smiles at the reference to the movie. The ebony parquet is shining, mirroring the lights. A hauntingly gorgeous tune fills the room. Harry recognizes the voice of David Bowie.
But I don’t move.
‘I know, Har. And I will. Okay? Green.’
‘He looked so fragile in those moments, his thoughts so far away. When I asked him about it, he told me that decisions weren’t fair. That you sometimes had to choose between two good things. Two perfect things. And neither choice would ever be right. I always thought he was talking about Fred and George, or about how the death of Tonks made sure her son, Teddy, grows up in a better world. But now... ‘ She is silent for a while. I let her gather her thoughts as I sip my Earl Grey.
She simply says: ‘Yes.’
‘Ouch! Deranged bitch.’ Drapunzel doesn’t know where it’s coming from. He would never be this disrespectful to his mother. Would he? It’s like there is another person inside of him, fighting to come out. Mother hits him, hard. Her other hand twists itself around his neck and presses the pressure points in his neck. Drapunzel feels like he’s choking. He claws at mother’s hands, but she seems to have superhuman power.
‘Spear yourself on my cock.’ He shudders at my commanding voice as he eagerly presses his hips towards me, my cock disappearing in his open hole. I shiver too. ‘I won’t last long, Har’, I mumble gruffly.
‘Like a train ran over me.’
It feels like the floo calls we used to have the first year we were together, when Harry was studying and I played overseas. Both telling the other to disconnect, a game that could go on for half an hour. Ah, young love.
Harry feels how soft his lips are. Just as soft as kissing a girl, he thinks. But then the Count parts his lips slightly, as to invite Harry. He slides his tongue in. The Count immediately chases it with his own, rough and needy. Nope, definitely not like kissing a girl, Harry thinks. The kiss turns sloppy and then downright filthy. He’s never been more glad of the mask, as he wouldn’t want these pics in the Prophet tomorrow. But maybe they will anyway, as the Count seems to know who he is. Maybe this is just an elaborate setup. He feels himself still.
As I make my way up, I feel her shiver. Her hands slide to my hair. ‘Hands back on the window, ma’am.’ She looks at me challenging through the window, but complies. Her smoldering look shows me she’s got something in store.
Draco’s prick swells dizzying quickly. Knowing Harry’s just as turned on as he is, he feels his confidence returning. His silvery eyes sparkle mischievously as he tells Harry: ‘you didn’t just notice them yesterday, did you? Oh no, I bet you thought about it every evening in bed.’
Her pubic hair is moist when I stroke it. She pushes against my hand, wanting me to move further down. Teasingly, I slide my fingers down, not touching her clit, until they reach her entrance. I push my finger in. And another. She shudders.
‘Such a foul mouth’. Malfoy yanks him towards him, using his hair as leverage.
‘Good, me neither.’ He replies, as he pushes himself onto my cock. My hand finds his leaking prick and I start fisting it. Harry moans desperately, increasing his pace. Within seconds I feel him stutter and spill all over my hand. I’m not doing a better job, as I feel my cock stiffening and I still before thrusting one last time. ‘Har... oh...’ I keep on pulsing come into his hole, as I throw back my head. This man will be the death of me.
‘I wish I could sit around here somewhere.’ She is scanning our surroundings, her eyes resting on our front gate. Suddenly I wonder if she is as innocent as I think she is. She must know I live nearby.
Harry waits.
‘I want to watch you fuck him too. And maybe, someday, I might join in.’ She leans over and gives me a kiss. On the mouth. I tilt my head a bit to allow her entrance. She doesn’t hesitate and plunges her tongue in. I moan into her mouth and softly pull her hair. She whimpers.
Rose’s laughter fills the kitchen. Every single ingredient Harry uses, he repeats the peekaboo with, until Rose starts to rub her eyes and yawns. He puts down his knife and picks her up, bringing her to her bedroom. He changes her diaper before he lays her in her crib gently. He tucks her in, humming a soft tune. When her eyes droop, he tiptoes out.
She presses her hand between Harry and herself, her other hand tweaks her nipple. Her eyes close for a moment.
‘Take care, Harry. Happy wanking!’ Ron waves as Harry walks to his favorite sushi joint. Wanking, he contemplates, another thing he hasn’t felt the need for in a long time. Coming to think about it, he can’t remember the last time he’s been aroused at all. Maybe he does need to see a mindhealer. But not today, he thinks, as he whistles across the street.
‘Fuck.’ Malfoy crouches down in front of him. ‘Maybe you are bloody different after all.’ His tongue trails his bottom lip.
After the arse-ogling incident on the stairs, Draco finds himself watching Harry. He catches him staring at his butt countless times, but Harry’s always confident in returning his gaze, leaving Draco flustered and wondering if maybe he’s seeing too much in this.
Carefully, he lowers his wand. ‘Who are you?’
‘He didn’t leave me. And he didn’t choose me then, not really, not with his whole heart. He just... He couldn’t choose both of us. He chose the easiest, most normal path, but don’t for a second think that made his choice easy. I think he kept on doubting until I was pregnant.’
‘I... I’m not sure how we go from here. We’ll figure it out on the line, right?’ They nod in unison. I’m so relieved, I could cry. I love these people more than anything in the world. Except my children, of course, but that’s a whole different kind of love. I get up and give Draco a long kiss, before making my way over to Gin and snogging her too.
‘Get on the bed.’ She pushes Harry on all fours onto the bed. I can see his cock sliding against the bed sheets. He wriggles his arse up for Ginny. Desperately I look for friction myself, but my poor cock doesn’t find any.
She opens them and looks at me. She moans as Harry pounds into her. His cock is making soppy noises as he thrusts. ‘Oh Draco, I’m so close.’
I hear Ginny grin. ‘You’ll survive, hun.’ She tries to coax him to come with her, but he doesn’t budge. Ginny rolls her eyes. ‘I think I saw some stairs for scaredy cats, maybe you can take those.’ Draco glares at her.
I don’t know how long I’ve been sitting here. Nor do I know how long I will remain here. I seem to have lost track of time. My eyes are sore, my throat feels like I’ve swallowed a razor. I’m sure Gin will come looking for me at some point. I don’t what I’ll do then.
Sniffling from laughter, I tell him ‘We have to talk about this, okay? But not right now. Let’s order some food.’
‘I’ve got it under control, love. You can go. We’ll see you down.’
‘There’s nothing wrong, pet. I just don’t want... After all those years I don’t want us to fuck in a sodding shed over a desk.’
‘Thank goodness! It’s about time you got laid.’ Dean smiles broadly at him. ‘Might stop you watching my arse.’
‘What?’ He must have heard wrong. There’s no way he’ll be getting on his knees in a full restaurant, to suck off the saviors freaking cock.
Harry’s heart breaks. He wants to wipe Draco’s tear away, but he doesn’t want to scare him. ‘She wasn’t. You are lovely. What is your name?’
Draco doesn’t know why he’s so lucky to have this. Doesn’t know if it will last, because nothing ever does and he always ends up devastated. But before his train of thought can thunder down that particular depressing rail track, Harry’s mouth pulls the emergency brake and forces his brain to shut down. Pleasure spreads through him, making him moan and glow. Harry’s praise seeps through, his brain subconsciously registering how precious Harry finds him, how beautiful and how promising. Draco surrenders and lets go, his orgasm rippling though him on a wave of warm pleasure and newfound trust. He’s never come this peaceful in his whole life.
‘Right now, I’m telling you it’s enough. That ankle is seriously broken and needs to be healed, or it can leave a permanent injury. I don’t want that. And I know you don’t want that either.’ Harry strokes his hair. ‘I care for you, precious. How come you are so mad at me?’
‘You sit down, right now.’ Harry presses him down angrily. With no energy left, Draco lets him, his face showing the pain he’s in. Harry’s voice is suddenly kinder, more understanding.
‘Don’t prolong the inevitable, please.’ Harry‘s voice isn’t as steady as he would’ve liked it to be.
‘Step out of your knickers. Now.’ I use my hands to part her arsecheeks and feel between them. She doesn’t particularly like having anal sex, but she sometimes does to accommodate me. Today is not one of those days, as it’s all about her pleasure. ‘You are lucky the potion doesn’t fit there.’ I tell her as I make my way to her front.
‘Malfoy, What the fuck are you talking about? I...we... The aurors thought you were dead. Killed by Greyback.’
Harry looks at him with a mixed expression. ‘My aunt forced me to. I could cook a three course meal when I was six, a perfect chocolate soufflé when I was seven and salt-crusted salmon with Bearnaise sauce when I was eight. I should hate her for it, but I’m sort of grateful she thought me this particular skill. I too find cooking the muggle way extremely relaxing. It clears my mind when I’m chopping carrots. When the nightmares were at their peak, I used to bake. Beating eggs, kneading dough, chopping apples, removing pits from cherries, anything to take my mind off. It worked like a charm. Only downside was that everyone around me got fat.’ Harry laughs. ‘Only thing I never could quite manage was treacle tart.’
‘What’s off limits?’ Harry asks.
Pacing around in his living, glancing at his muggle watch makes him even more anxious. What if Potter stands him up? Maybe he is angry for him not returning the favor this afternoon? Images of the hot scene flood through his mind. The way Harry swallowed him whole, letting him fuck his face while staying in control the whole time. Draco shifts in his pants, his half hard cock strains against the fabric.
‘Mr. Potter? Please bring him back in one piece.’
I spent all of the love I've saved
‘Why did you ask me to bring clothes? I’ve got a feeling we won’t be engaging in a lot of activities that require clothing.’
‘No you.’
‘You can touch it, if you want.’
Draco snorts. Harry returns his smile. ‘Now back into character, Mr. Malfoy. I didn’t come here to talk about daisies, but to fuck you right into them.’ Draco’s breath hitches. Fuck, he wants this.
‘Hush handsome. You did so great. I’m so proud of you.’ Harry’s calloused thumb wipes the tear away and kisses it’s trail, while Ginny softly fondles with my hair. I murmur something, not sure what, before I feel the bliss of sleep wash over me.
‘I advise you to mind your language, dearest Draco.’ Harry leans in and whispers in a low voice: ‘I didn’t forget my promise, you know’. Of course Draco knows exactly what promise he’s talking about. If he doesn’t behave, Harry threatened to fuck him right through dessert. On the table, for the whole restaurant to see.
Ginny gets on her knees behind him, lining herself up. ‘Harry, I want you to pretend it’s Draco fucking you. Cry out for him, can you do that, luv?’
Harry nods, eyes shutting again. It hurts, but he’s thrumming with anticipation of finally knowing how it feels to be fucked. The adrenaline is taking over. The Counts removes his fingers. Harry’s eyes fly open. ‘Wha-?’
‘Fuck’. Harry moans. It feels... not good, but better. Loads of better. Malfoy starts thrusting, deliberately, giving Harry time to adjust. Harry feels himself ease into the rhythm. Until all of a sudden his vision turns blurry. ‘Fuck, Malfoy, yes, oh gods, there, right there’.
‘You’re doing great, hun.’ She gently puts in the ball, fastening the soft clasps behind my head. ‘Okay? Not too tight? Stamp your foot thrice if it’s too tight.’ I sit still. ‘Good’, she tells me.
‘Thanks, Ron’
I feel boneless. I love playing rough. With Ginny, I’m always careful not to hurt her too much. She is strong and can take pain too, but with Draco? We’re able hurt each other equally bad, overpower each other and hit each other without holding back.
Not true at all, Draco feels his hands clench under the desk. James Jones is notorious for his bad decisions and awful planning. He tends to blame others for his own fuck ups. All the aurors dislike him. ‘You absolutely never asked me such a thing, sir. I would’ve remembered, being half your age.’ He tries to be respectful, but he can’t stand injustice. Jones pisses him off.
‘Yes?’
Spent, they lie on the recliner for a little while, waiting for their breathing to even out. Malfoy gets up and casts a few cleaning charms. He dresses and tosses Harry his clothes too. ‘Mustn’t leave evidence.’ He half-jokes. The atmosphere changes. Malfoy looks at Harry from his standing position.
‘I’d fight for you. I’ll make it work!’
‘You’re gorgeous.’ He hears Harry tell him. ‘Yes, he is, isn’t he? The most gorgeous thing I ever laid eyes on.’ What the?
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco looks at her: ‘Shame. I wasn’t opposed.’ His grey eyes are dead serious.
Draco returns his hand above the table and runs it through his hair. ‘I think you should send a team. But...’ Harry’s takes him in deep, his tight throat enticing.
Carefully he folds in the cream and eggs and some pasta cooking water, softly tossing as he creates a thick, creamy, sinful sauce that clings lightly to each strand of tagliatelle. He grinds some fresh pepper over it.
She looks at me with compassion as she continues. ‘Harry was devastated. I didn’t realize at the time. I thought is was the aftermath of the war. But he... I used to walk in and find him in our window sill, looking out over the big oak tree in our garden.’ I blush. That must’ve been the tree where we first kissed. The tree that Harry pushed me flush against when I came to apologize for my misconducts.
‘Okay.’ He looks at Draco with a lopsided grin. Draco feels Harry’s hard on and knows he’s just as far gone as he is himself. ‘I won’t hold back then.’
I decided Harry needed some domestic fluff to allow him to daydream of the Count.
‘Oi!’ I yell, ‘I can hear you two, you know!’
‘Did you do... anything else?’ Way to go, Gin. Eloquently formulated, this.
She gives me an intense stare that reminds me of my mother. ‘I’m here to ask you what I couldn’t find the courage for then. Because at that point I didn’t know of how much love Harry is capable. Or maybe I did, but maybe I wasn’t ready yet.’
Just Harry starts pounding Draco’s arse in earnest. Every other thrust he reaches Draco’s pleasure point, which makes Draco see white spots. Just Harry’s prick makes sopping noises as he keeps on plunging balls deep into Draco. Sexy Arse sets a relentless pace in fucking his mouth. His hand is entangled in Draco’s hair, pulling him up with every thrust. The throbbing pain would’ve made him come if he hadn’t had the cock ring on.
‘I didn’t expect you would be a freezer. You know, people fight, flight or freeze. I’ve seen it all. It gets so fucking tiring sometimes.’ Malfoy sighs. ‘No pleading? No last wishes?’
‘Later, I promise’.
‘Bastard’ Draco grabs a spoon full of pudding and flicks it at Harry. Enjoying the startled look on Harry’s face, he fills up his spoon again, only to be hit right in the face by a spoonful of orange mousse. Harry’s laughter rings through the restaurant. They continue to keep throwing food at each other, until all bowls are empty and they are both breathless, crying from laughter. Harry gently strokes a strand of hair out of Draco’s face. ‘You are the best man in the world, you know that?’ He pecks a quick kiss on Draco’s lips.
Harry now paused, contemplating whether to tell Draco he’d told Ron, then deciding too many people mistreat Draco and he didn’t want to be another one on the list, “Ron-”
“Eh! I wasn’t going to let ‘Mione stay out of the loop!”
Mid thought Harry stopped, mouth half open to express his distaste for history, but a question came to mind. “Do-... Do you think we’re going to have another war?”
“How did it look like from the stands?”
It was when Harry arrived back to his bed and laid down that he realized he hadn’t worn his wrist wrap.
Draco stared at nothing in contemplation before nodding, “Because to point out that part of the story you would need to answer the questions that come from it. Like,” Draco turned to Harry, “Why did it not stay in the family?”
“But I will do my fucking best to save you. I’ll save you… No matter the cost.”
Draco glared at Helena before walking away to a bench, and Harry nodded, leaving him to decide whether he wanted Harry gone or if Harry could continue to broach this subject.
Sitting in the classroom, waiting for a late professor, Harry snuck one look at Malfoy, faking to be paying attention to what Ron was saying, probably something about how unfair the Quidditch World Cup was with Bulgaria.
When Harry returned to his room at the crack of dawn he had no answers, just bruised lips and two angry looking friends waiting for him in the common room.
When they went to lunch Harry noticed Draco wasn’t there. And that added a new reason to worry. What had Malfoy said or done to Draco?
Harry went to grab Draco’s hand, but instead found his hands in Draco’s grip as he flipped them over on his lap and traced the lines of his palm, “When you didn’t let go last night, and tighten your grip until it bruised-”
But Molly was more than mature enough to understand how complicated the situation was. So she agreed to secrecy. After mentioning the difficulty of getting access to Narcissa, without Lucius around, Harry agreed to talk to Draco and somehow schedule something for them. Or get Molly her schedule… if Narcissa has one.
Harry heard Ron murmur in agreement and a shuffling of a chair beside him.
Hermione shrugged, taking the coins and passing them to Seamus, stating their bet, “Art takes time.”
“Give up.”
After dinner and after a nice warm and relaxing shower, Harry laid in bed, wondering if Viktor, or anyone else for that matter, became a threat to his mission… what would he do?
Malfoy nodded, looking away.
“So… can you understand why I didn’t tell you guys?”
“Harry thinks he’s too close with M-… him.” Hermione looked around, noticing a few people who shouldn’t be paying attention to their conversation, were.
She nodded, “So he agreed to go to the ball with you?”
“Like I’m not a big fan of school, but there is something important to learn from our history. We wizards and witches have a rich history, and for it to be completely disregarded in school due to us having just about the most BORING professor we could have been cursed with- You know who would have made that class more interesting? Lupin! DADA was amazing last year. I’ve never wanted to learn more-”
Malfoy tried to remain indifferent, but the way his chest took more air than needed at Harry’s word let him know that comments like that seemed to make him uncomfortable. He didn’t say anything.
A faint snicker escaped Draco as he heard the full on distaste in Harry’s voice as he succumbed to his unfortunate fate. Harry groaned, squating down with Draco’s hand on his left and his right gripping the banister as he banged his head against the rail, “Fuck man, it was hard getting you to come with me and now I have to find another one? One was hard enough,” He stood up quickly, turning to Draco with beg in his eyes, “Please just-”
Ron looked down, ashamed, “Only his lip is bruised.”
“You told Harry to cheat.” Ron leaned forward, forcing Harry to lean back as Ron did everything possible to not allow Hermione to look away from him.
Harry smiled and softly reached for his cheek, leaning forward and softly pressing his lips to Draco, flinching himself at Draco’s flinch of pain. That woke the boy up.
“I am very well justified to be freaked out about this. Like what would you-”
“I kissed you. Someone saw it… and they told you father. And this is your punishment?”
“Can I guess that this will warrant a visit from your father?”
“I say start by talking to someone about all that screaming in your head-”
don’t have every adult on this building worried about my sleeping schedule. What are
Harry glared at it before remembering why he’d come here, then sighed and nodded, grabbing Ron’s hand and now paying a ridiculous amount of attention to every move and step Ron made, trying to copy it. Despite the motivator, it still took another two hours to get Harry to a nearly decent stage, still needing a few reminders along the way.
Did… did he get two enemies?
He heard them call for him, but he ignored them all and left. They seemed to either think this wasn’t such a bad idea, since they didn’t chase after him.
Pity adorned Draco’s face, and through the corner of his eye he glanced at Harry who was grimacing at the floor.
“What if someone tried to hit on Hermione?”
The problem was that Draco did not have an ally with Harry in this matter, he was also desperate to find out what the letter said. He’d seen what could happen, the worst of it. He needed to know if he’d done the right move, “Please.”
Ron had not expected Harry to actually explain it. Harry had not realized he had an answer. But hearing it out loud, it wasn’t a lie. He could recall those nights at the Weasley’s when he’d spend the majority of them sleeping for thirty minutes, fighting to go back to sleep for two hours and then sleeping for another thirty, and blaming it on some noise that didn’t exist.
Harry’s hand, gripping Draco’s left wrist, squeezed tighter. And it’s all in the seconds. The quick looks. The deep breaths. The fear. The excitement. The truth. His eyes in Draco’s. His fingers squeezing his veins. The rising of his chest. The fatigue. The second long thought.
“I… don’t know? I can’t say for sure… He dislikes you.” Draco looked apprehensive at Harry as he nodded, and then confusion took over, “Why do you care?”
Harry blinked. Ron smiled smugly, “And how would you know that?”
“I’m not here to interrogate-”
“It was a long boring day of school today. And I had enough time to do… to see that infamous ‘bigger picture’. He thinks You-know-who is going to come back someday.” Harry internally flinched, knowing it was true. Draco sighed and continued, “He hopes he does. And if he does… he wants to be ‘on the right-side of history’ with those-... deatheaters.” Draco nodded, as though saying it outloud helped solidify it as truth, “He was the first to denounce himself of being one when-” Draco paused, and Harry knew why as he smiled and nodded.
To Harry it felt like hours of Ron standing in front of him, waiting for his reply as he contemplated whether or not to do it, but it really was barely even three seconds before Harry ripped off the bandage and confessed to Ron what destiny had in store for him.
Symptoms of stress:
Harry didn’t believe in God but right now he was praying finding the kitchen would be easy.
“What has your father told you about me?”
... It's not gonna happen. I feel like I need the cut off to regroup myself.
“It’s all I’m known for.”
He stumbled all the way towards Dumbledore, who handed him the piece of paper with his name on it, and Harry felt sick as he didn’t recognize the signature, the penmanship. Someone did this to him. He looked up at Dumbledore who pointed him towards the back room, with all the other champions. Harry sighed and moved towards it.
Mentions of decapitation.
“It appears as though… someone stole it? And used it to cast the Mosmorde charm. I had to explain far too many times that it would have been impossible for Harry to perform the charm, not just because of what it means, but because how would he even-”
“Do you think your name’s on his wrist? Or are you eternally destined to want him but never get him?” Her smile made sense now, it was pitiful as that of a mother who was bracing to hold her wounded child in her arms and help him heal the pain away. She wasn’t wrong. It’s pretty rare, but just like with the enemy-bond, there have been people whose signatures are on multiple people’s wrist. It’s either a sign of unrequited love or that one of the suitors is… not going to make it. It’s cruel. Some people think those originated from a curse. No one’s really sure.
Harry smiled, “I’ve considered it a few times, just out of spite. So that when they’d attack me I could give them a genuine well educated retort. Hit them back with their own book.”
“I bruised-”
“Why?”
Ron looked at the ground, never liking it when Hermione scolded him, and grumpily nodded.
Harry nodded, “Does your father hate me?”
Harry shrugged, their anger not being able to so much as graze the fullness in his heart that warmed him all over. “In the tower.”
“Wh- What- What… Hey, buddy!” Ron stuttered over what to say before remembering Harry was still on health watch.
These are the things no one will or can ever tell him.
Harry heard Malfoy inhale a hiss as though Harry had just stabbed him and then more silence.
“But Slytherins cheat all the time and get away with it and you don’t see us complaining.”
Harry had heard tales that for the most part, you wouldn’t find either of the people on your wrist until you were 20+, so he didn’t worry about either. A problem for later.
It could have been an hour later, or two, Harry had no perception of time, but suddenly he heard Ron whisper, “Are you awake?”
Arthur nodded and joined in on the nervous laughter, “Yeah, and he almost got it. I bet you he was paying off the minister.”
“I know this is invasive, and I know this will make you angry, but was he right?” Harry joked to himself that nothing made him more gryffindor ‘recklessly brave’ than poking the snake in front of him.
Harry turned back to Draco, expecting him to expand on it, while Draco bitterly smiled at Helena, “Salazar Slytherin had a belief of blood purity and that muggles were beneath us, and a group of people to follow him in an attempt to achieve it. Gellert Grindelwald, believed that it was degrading to us wizards to hide and ostracize ourselves from muggles and that we should expose ourselves and establish dominance over muggles, and he also had a group that followed his beliefs.” Draco finally turned to Harry and tilted his head as though expecting Harry to finish that thought.
“I-...” Harry was making a list in his head of things to watch out for. He was beginning to create a timeline with his reactions. He had a vague understanding of when to back off in regards to Draco's anger. And now he was watching Draco’s nervousness and shyness increase as he began biting his actual lips, leaving faint bruising with how hard he was doing it.
Hermione shook her head, wrapping her head around Harry’s fuck up, “What would Lu- Sorry, Lefty Senior, what would he do to Dr- LEFTY! With seeing your wrist? Is your-... What- Oh my-!”
Harry leaned in, wanting to share with Draco as much vulnerability as Draco has shared with him, “You know what’s worse than going to Azkaban for twelve years even though you’re innocent?”
“Seven. I’m guessing due to studying for exams a lot of people are having difficulty waking up. So thank your luck for that, Harry.”
Harry looked up at her confused, because to be fair, ‘Mione and Ron should be the ones confused seeing as he never explained that whatever may or may not be happening between them had to be a secret. There was an undertone, but never explained.
Enjoy this! I have 17 tabs open due to some research I had to do to make this chapter good.
So, he couldn’t help his smile.
But I must meet demands and now I'm curious.
“It’s a warning, or a statement. Made by death-eaters to remind us, that they are still here.” Arthur did not sound happy about a single word he said.
Fear that addressing Lucius would warrant a worse punishment for Draco. Fear that his actions would have drastics consequences. Disgust at knowing the right move right now was to not do anything until they had the advantage and Lucius had no way of making the situation worse. And that’s how he found himself, two classrooms away, ears searching desperately for the sound of a door opening and a tall man walking away so that he could rush in and pick up the pieces of Lucius misdeeds.
Harry and Ron, rejoined everyone and took their respective seats, quietly enjoying everyone’s banter as they debated who was gonna win.
I also wanted to play with one of my favorite things, The Butterfly Effect.
“Hush Ronald, look for information. Ask the other champions. Ask the prof-”
Draco shrugged, “I don’t know either. Pansy makes a lot of plans that always fall through. So I wouldn’t worry.”
He nodded, not sure if it was true or false, but knowing he didn’t want to be there.
“I just said it.”
Ron sighed and stood up, taking one last look of confirmation from Harry before glaring at a passive looking Draco who -sadly for them- just happened to be casually conversing with Parkinson in the most non-confrontational way possible and sighed one last time, “Oi Malfoy!”
Just Harry stills as both men have come. He pulls Draco on his lap, without removing his cock. ‘You two, make him come. I want to feel his perfect hole clenching around me when he comes.’ Just Harry removes the cock ring. Sexy Arse swallows Draco and starts sucking with vigor, while Boy Toy fondles with his balls and kisses him deeply. Draco knows he’s close. He wants to draw it out, but he knows the attempt is futile. When Just Harry starts moving again, hitting his nerve bundle perfectly with every stroke, Draco tips over the edge. He pants curse words in Boy Toy’s mouth as he spoofs up Sexy Arse’s throat. He hears Just Harry panting behind him.
‘She was talking to Yaxley.’ Harry provides. ‘I’m sure she’ll talk about his whereabouts if you cut her sentence.’ A shrewd look crosses Bellatrix’ face. She’s already thinking about how to save her own skin.
‘So I can see you better, dearest Potter.’ He deliberately comes closer, moving with an animal like force. His bare feet pad on the leaves. Malfoy walks him backwards. With a thud, he collides with a tree. Harry’s eyes become large as he instantly knows what’s happened. ‘Greyback bit you.’ It’s not a question. Malfoy stills.
‘Oh love...’ Harry looks at him with so much compassion, it almost smothers Draco.
‘Oh!’ Harry exclaims as he watches the count pass. The feathered mask on a stick dangles from the hand that’s holding the witch, revealing his real mask. It’s an emerald green Harlequin pattern, with off-white and gold accents. The same as Harry’s. He tries to make his way over to the Count, but he dissolves in the crowd.
‘So I can hold you down better when I fuck you.’ Malfoys posh voice emphasizes on the k, letting it pop in his mouth as he covers the last ground. Harry’s hand is trembling as Malfoy takes his wand. ‘You won’t be needing this.’ Harry’s hand lets go of it. A little voice in his head curses him for being so stupid as Malfoy drops the wand on the thick leaves on the ground.
He swats me. ‘Seriously, Draco. I love you. I’ve never stopped loving you. Not ever.’
He makes his way over to his desk, stomach grumbling. Good sex always makes him hungry. Shit, he’s forgotten all about lunch! The canteen will be closed now. Fuck. His legs tangle in something and he all but falls on the ground. He’s glad Harry’s already left, because he would laugh his arse off over Draco’s clumsiness. Feeling his way, he makes out a rectangular shape. Carefully he lifts the fabric, uncovering a wicker basket. He looks at the fabric. It’s the invisibility cloak! Harry left it. Unguarded. With him, of all people. Wow. Suddenly a bit overwhelmed by his trust, he swallows.
‘Good. Me neither.’ Harry lets his hand fly over his cock again. The pleasure it brings is wonderful. Harry feels his cock tightening and swelling, knows he’s going to burst. Malfoy hits his prostate once again. He grunts as he releases his load and spoils it all over his own hand and the recliner. Malfoy follows suit and Harry watches his face contort with pleasure as he closes his eyes and comes with a rough grunt. He topples over, leaning into Harry, while his still half hard cock slides out.
Harry watches his internal conversation with an amused smile. Pompous prick.
‘Oh fuck, right there. Don’t you dare stop now, Harry Potter.’
He looks sideways at me. ‘Are you still sure you want this? If it makes you unhappy, I... I’ll have to stop...’
He enters our holiday cottage and looks around. I’m expecting remarks about the interior, but as he looks around, all he tells me is: ‘At least it isn’t a closet’.
Jaimy throws his fist up in victory. Sybil gives him a death glare. ‘But with appropriate urgency.’ His own urgency becomes almost too much, he needs to have these two out of the office. ‘If that’s all? I have to finish this report for Senior auror Jones.’ They give him a sympathetic look. ‘Close the door on your way out, please.’ He looks sternly at them. Well, as sternly as he can, considering Harry’s relentless pace makes his face twist in anguish. He’s so close. He feels his balls tighten.
‘Ah... Harry!’ She throws her head backwards.
Harry feels the edge of the bed in his knee pits. The Count looks him in the eye, pupils wide with raw desire, as he pushes him on the bed with one hand. The bed is soft and enormous. Harry clambers to the middle, propped up on his elbows, legs pulled up and wide open. The Count takes off his blouse while he climbs on the bed.
‘Why did you come back?’
Malfoy puts his hands next to Harry’s head, his leg in between Harry’s. Harry is trapped. He feels arousal rush through him.
I shake my head. ‘Are you being oblivious for a reason, Draco? It’s not what I mean and you know it.’ I see anger flashing in his steely grey eyes.
‘Next time I won’t ask nicely, ma’am. Now turn around.’
‘But it doesn’t. It’s just a job. You’re just a job. Like all the others.’ Malfoy points the gun at Harry. ‘On your knees, hands behind your head.’
Harry’s jaw relaxes as he looks inquiring at Draco. Draco’s heart flops in his chest. Isn’t this what this is all about? His desire to be dominated? Draco knows his own submissive character. A treat that wasn’t always there.
‘As an only child I’m not used to sharing much. I need you to help me when it gets difficult. To be short: I want to feel loved and needed and you’ll probably get some emotional crap and a raging dose of constant bickering from me, that I hope doesn’t scare you, Potters.’
‘Tomorrow? It’s a full moon then, you’ll be able to make your way in the garden better.’
Gin and Har aren’t downstairs, so I walk upstairs, opening the bedroom shouting ‘I’m home!’.
‘Does that sound like something you do over a desk in a fucking shed?’
‘Nothing is, love.’
Draco shakes his head. He flushes even deeper, sure that Harry doesn’t want anything to do with him anymore, sure he’s doing it all wrong. He wants to retreat, but Harry starts speaking in encouraging tones.
Harry is swearing. He normally doesn’t, that’s why I know he’s serious. It’s time to send in the big guns, so I make my lip tremble and start crying.
‘Fuck, Harry. That was so hot!’ He reaches under the table to pet Harry. When he doesn’t find him, he kneels under his desk and feels around. Harry’s musky and sensual scent is still lingering. But no Harry. He hears the telltale poof of apparation and bumps his head forcefully on the desk. ‘Fuck.’ He rubs the sore spot and gets up. He’d forgotten Harry is such a strong wizard, he can disapparate from anywhere. Even the ministry.
‘I want to have these conversation regularly, so I expect us to eat together every week, to prevent the trolllike miscommunication crap, that I know the both of you are more than capable off. And don’t you fucking dare to deny it.’ She sounds like a mixture of Molly an Hermione, a scary as hell combination.
‘Rumor has it Count Flagler himself might join.’
‘I prefer bottoming, but I’ve never topped when with a man. They wouldn’t let me, you know.’ Draco replies in a small voice. It’s the first time he feels real emotion talking about it. Something other than anger or the feeling he somehow summoned his faith. Suddenly he realizes that all that’s happened to him, was not okay. He may have enjoyed it physically, but that doesn’t make it right. He didn’t have a choice. It feels strangely liberating to think like this.
When he wakes up, he hears Draco’s voice, screaming at the top of his lungs. ‘You fucking, murderous psychopath. Deranged maniac! I should kill you right here. Splatter your brain onto the floor.’
Harry’s laughter fills his hallway. ‘I was talking about your house, you dork.’ He enters and whispers in his ear ‘Don’t worry, I’ve never met a bloke that couldn’t take me. It just takes proper preparation’. His naughty wink morphs into a thousand butterflies that settle in Draco’s stomach. As if he wasn’t nervous enough...
I know she’s close when I start rubbing circles around her clit and she moans the moan. I suck on her tits, licking them with devotion. It doesn’t take long to finish her. A few soft strokes and she is screaming my name, her nipples hardening and her back arching.
Draco turns serious . ‘Thank you for coming. I didn’t think you would. I never...’ his voice trails away.
‘On fours. Now.’ Harry scrambles on his fours immediately, surprised the forest floor suddenly feels soft as a bed. He looks up at Malfoy startled. Did he?
When he’s opened me enough, he lays on top of me, pressing his calloused body on me, holding my hands above my head. Ginny likes to be overpowered, but I’d forgotten how much I like it myself.
‘It figures. This is Rapunzel’s realm after all.’ Harry says between kisses. Draco picks him up carefully and carries him to the gate. He levitates a very angry Bellatrix behind him as he warps through the gate. Ron and a team of aurors are already waiting.
The towel makes its way to his back, sliding over his arse. ‘So round, so firm.’ Harry kneads his arse through the towel.
Harry looks at her wide eyed. I know this is what he has wanted for some time now, but he never wants to push Gin or me. The Gryffindor Goody-two-shoes.
‘Of course. I would never make you do anything against your will. You are much too precious.’ Harry wonders what nasty things this Drapunzel has had to deal with. Judging by the marks on his throat, he thinks he’s got an indicator. Aroused as he is, he would never abuse his power over him.
‘It is an exquisite specimen’, Harry quips, without betting his eyes.
‘Hmm?’
Deciding he’s had enough, Harry grabs Draco’s hair and pushes his head down on his cock. ‘Naughty ones must be punished, don’t you agree? Now start sucking.’ Harry guides Draco’s head up and down, using a bit more force than necessary. It arouses Draco even more, he feels his own neglected cock bursting with want.
Harry hasn’t had a relationship or even sex since Ginny died two years ago. Not that people weren’t offering. He just couldn’t bear exploring pleasure with someone not her. But lately, he finds himself opening up again. Wanting to explore the feeling he’s not only into witches. He knows he likes to watch the wizards in porn mags just as much, their muscular, square bodies and hard cocks. He should just go clubbing and pull, as his friends have told him over and over. But going out for a quick fuck isn’t what he wants. People might only want him for the fame, he can never be certain of their intentions.
‘I’m sorry. Am I not to your liking?’ Draco averts his eyes and starts retreating.
Almost there! One small chapter left and after that three seperate installments of smut. They won’t be added as chapters to this fic, because the roleplay elements (non-con) result in a change of warnings and I don’t feel like that does justice to this fic.
A sigh escapes him. That feels good. He softly presses deeper, feeling the hole stretch a bit. He bites his lip again. He lubes his finger again, and then his cock. The finger returns to his hole, as he circles his cock with the other and tugs it a few times. He pulls away the foreskin and lets his hand slide over his cock, spreading the lube further. He imagines Jareth kneeling behind him, lining up that impressive cock and pushing it in his hole. He can only imagine what that would feel like.
‘Yes, fuck me. And I want you to pretend she’s you, fucking me. Think you can do that?’
‘I started writing about us, you know. But people don’t ship us. They think we’re too vanilla. Too domestic. They write me like I’m some direct gal who knows exactly what she wants in bed and knows no shame, and you as Mister Perfect, Forgiving Auror and Saviour of all Wizardkind, with rock solid abs that could crush a walnut when you’re doing crunches.’ He sniggers.
When the laughter has settled down, Ginny adds: ‘He means moving here, you daft prick.’
‘Now you’re ready.’ Malfoy kneels in front of the recliner and slides Harry’s arse to the edge of it. He grabs his legs and puts them on his shoulders. Harry is pressed against the soft fabric of the recliner. Malfoy lines up his cock with Harry’s hole and pushes in, inch by inch. Harry has trouble relaxing. ‘It’s been some time.’
Harry laughs as the Count pulls him up, off the bed. He leads Harry into a véry pretentious bathroom, bath with claws and ginormous gold framed mirrors included. The Count turns on the water of an immense shower booth and takes off the last bits of his clothing. He steps under the two sprays, pulling an already very naked Harry towards him.
Still not a single shift. I grab her hair and kick her legs wider. I hear a tiny gasp when I pull her head back a bit, using her auburn hair as leverage. ‘You’re hurting me, auror. I’ll file a complaint.’
‘Watch that rude mouth, auror Malfoy. I am your superior. It’s a good thing senior Auror Potter has his day off, or I would discuss a good disciplinary action with him.’
Harry wakes after a long, wonderful sleep, filled with dreams about Jareth and Malfoy. He sports a morning wood, something he hasn’t woken up with in a long time. He wanks with long, languid strokes, relishing the feeling. He thinks of Malfoy taking him from behind, while he presses Harry’s face down forcefully on the bed by the nape of his neck. He comes with a low moan. Harry cleans up and fetches himself some coffee. He knows he should eat, but he’s too excited. He spends the rest of the morning in bed, reading the novel Hermione gave him last Christmas. He hasn’t had time for it yet. It’s a wonderful story of a vampire Count who falls in love with his prey. How appropriate.
‘Yeah. It’s said he has found a suitable person this year. Hey, it might be you!’
‘No love, far from. I expected you would. It helps, or so I’m told. I don’t think I’m ready yet to give you this request. But when the time comes, I’ll do it without hesitation. Okay? I’ll do it for you. You’ll be in full control. But not yet, I can’t do this yet, okay? You first need to feel loved. Need to have been in control. Need to know when and that you are able to stop. To stop yourself and stop me. You need to know how precious you are to me.’ Harry’s earnest eyes fill Draco with warmth. He nods. He thinks he understands.
The Redhaired Bitch is a freelance tour manager. She manages big events, this time for Michael Rice. She got us the tickets to the finals of the Eurovision Song Contest.
A small pop sounds, and a cute, fully clothed house elf apparates into the room. She is wearing an abundance of pink, frilly things. ‘Master be wanting his coffee now?’
‘Touch yourself.’ He tells me. He doesn’t have to say it twice, I’m already slipping my hand into my panties, finding I’m even wetter than I thought. I moan when I touch my clit, rubbing circles around it. The moan is stifled by Harry’s cock.
‘Fernando, can you make sure no one will disturb us? We’ve got a rather pressing... conversation at hand.’
‘Will you...’ Harry’s voice trails away. He coughs. ‘Will you use lube?’
‘Dean! Please, keep it simple.’
‘Red.’ Of course he knows instantly what to say. It’s him who introduced me into the world of kinky play.
Thank you for reading and following this fic! I will add extra smut in seperate fics, but this main one is done. I loved writing this triad and I hope you enjoyed reading it!
Just Harry cleans them and summons blankets from the bed. He snuggles next to Draco, who is being sandwiched by Boy Toy and Sexy Arse. Both of them are caressing every inch of Draco they can get their hands on. Harry lies propped up on his arm and watches the scene. He strokes Draco’s chin with his thumb as he tells him appreciatively: ‘You did well, love. So well. I loved your little scheme. And you didn’t come until I told you so. I’m proud of you.’ He gives Draco a small peck on the lips. ‘Now sleep.’
I come home early, hearing the creaking of the bed but not thinking anything of it. It is my play night with Harry, after all. When I enter, I see Harry on the edge of the bed, Ginny between his legs sucking him off. It’s quite the sight. But what stands out more are the soft, black ropes and the gag, spread out on the bed.
The sound of that posh voice always sends a shiver down my spine. I learned how to hide it, I almost had myself fooled I hated him.
Harry circles him, hands behind his back. ‘What should I do with such insolence?’ He holds still in front of Draco and starts walking him backwards, until Draco is flush against the wall. Harry leans in. ‘I did disclose the consequences of wearing those trousers to work again, didn’t I?’
‘Fits you?’ He looks at me taken aback. ‘Fits..? Oh, I understand. Well, if you want to be the auror, that’s fine too.’
‘I know, Draco.’ The name feels strange on his tongue. Harry swallows.
He sees the Count’s reflection in the mirrors, but when he swirls around, the Count is gone again. It’s madness. People are pointing at him, laughing or even jesting. Just as he’s about to give up in annoyance and walk away, he sees him in the middle of the dance floor. He beckons him, a small smile playing at his lips. His arrogant stance should infuriate Harry. He should turn around and leave. But he finds himself drawn to the Count like a moth to a flame. The Count holds out his hand. Harry takes it and finds himself spinning around the dance floor in the Count’s strong arms.
Draco is silent for a while, choosing the right words. ‘I don’t ever want to feel second best. You cannot let me into your life and not mean it.’
The Count watches Harry sleep. He looks so peaceful. He is still surprised by Harry’s act of faith. Even after all that he’s been through, he’s still the same courageous, trusting man he was as a boy. And the Count still isn’t as good a person as Harry is.
‘Fuck. I’ll kill her for this, I swear.’
‘What? No.’
‘That is an excellent suggestion, love.’ Draco gently licks Just Harry’s hard-on. His eyes lock onto Just Harry’s. Falling out of character, Draco’s looks at him with a provocative glint in his eyes, while continuing to lick teasing stripes on Just Harry’s cock. He raises his eyebrow to challenge Harry. Who, of course, immediately takes the bait.
A quick Tempus tells him it’s seven PM. No wonder his stomach is growling.
(See the end of the chapter for
The first tear slides down my cheek, unnoticed. It leaves a trail as it slithers further down and shatters on my collar. I think of all the love I saved for Harry.  All the kindness I have in me, just for him. I knew from the start it would never work out. Yet I grew addicted to him. To his kisses, his beautiful, kind heart, his selflessness.
‘I like it when I’m forced, pushed or coaxed.’ Harry nods again, encouragingly. ‘I like pain. I like fighting. I likes sex. I like fighting that leads to sex.’ The look in Harry’s eyes, predatory and protective, makes him spill his secrets.
Draco feels light as he gets up. Lighter than he has in years. It might have something to do with the conversation Harry and he had this morning. Was it just this morning? It feels ages ago.
‘I’m serious, love. I’m afraid I’ll lose it all. Your love, the fresh friendship with Malfoy, Ron and Hermione, the kids. What good will come of this? I’m a happy man. I’ve got you, the kids, our family. What more could I ever ask for?’
‘Of course. Now you’re silent.’ She looks on the brink of crying. ‘Oh Har, what am I doing wrong? Maybe I wasn’t cut out for mothership.’
‘Oh.’ I’m speechless. I guess Draco is more of a gentlewizard than I gave him credit for.
Startled, Harry wakes up from the couch to see Narcissa Malfoy in his fireplace. He rubs his eyes to check if he’s dreaming.
‘No, thank yóu. You were fucking amazing, Saviour.’
‘I’d rather have you tie me to the bedpost, auror, to continue your search. Otherwise I might run off.’ She replies, a bit of sperm trickling down her chin. If I was 17 again, I would fuck her this instant. That look. But sadly my prick usually doesn’t warm up that soon anymore.
Harry looks at him sternly, his emerald eyes hold a challenge in them, that makes Draco’s insides squirm with want. His insides also tell him he’s really freaking hungry. Slowly, Draco puts his palm back on Harry’s cock. He starts rubbing it through the sturdy fabric of his jeans. His cock is hard and gigantic. Harry keeps on eating.
‘What the..?’ Jones looks around, settling suspiciously on Draco. ‘Did you just hex me, auror Malfoy?’
‘Draco.’
She gets up quickly, but adjusts herself halfway. Too late, love. I’ve already seen how much you crave this. Slowly, catlike, she moves to the pane and puts her slender hands against it. She wriggles her arse at me. ‘Like this, auror?’ Her voice comes out huskily. I really need to think about non arousing things, but all that plops up are images that make my erection even harder. I decide to cast a quick spell on my cock to create a magical cock ring, or I won’t last another five minutes.
‘Since I saw you step into the ballroom.’
When we’re seated and halfway through our meal, I think it’s time. ‘We need to set some rules. Draco, Ginny, I’m so happy to see you sitting here together at this table. You have no idea how much I love you both.’
His hand speeds up a little. He wants to go slow, but he feels his body’s need. He’s sure he can’t hold back long. He imagines Jareth leaning in, kissing him. Out of the blue Malfoy enters his mind. Naked too, cock in hand. Well, Harry grins, might as well let the two fuck me. Imaginary Malfoy makes his way over and straddles Harry, pushing his cock in his mouth. He still feels imaginary Jareth push inside, as he moves his finger in a steady rhythm. His hand slides in the same rhythm as he imagines sucking Malfoy, while Jareth keeps fucking him. His hand flies over his slippery cock. Before he knows it he feels his hole contract around his finger, as he comes all over his hand and couch. Spurts of semen stream out as he grunts. He leans back into the couch, relishing the after orgasm bliss. He cleans and goes to bed early. Only to wank again, his body thrumming with anticipation for the next day.
He spits out a bit of blood and grins that challenging smile again. ‘Is that all you’ve got, auror? And you dare call mé a ponce?’
‘I don’t want you to come just yet, gorgeous. You’ll enjoy us pounding you until you can’t take it anymore before you can come. Safe word out if it gets too much, okay?’, he whispers in Draco’s ear. Draco trembles with want as he nods. Returning to character, Harry tells him: ‘You’re doing great, precious thing. Look at you, wanking them off like you’ve never done anything else in your life.’
‘That’s no way to talk to your mother, Drapunzel. You will thank me for combing your hair. Or I will throttle that lovely throat of yours until you’re turning blue.’
Just Harry immediately grasps what he needs. ‘Oh love, this won’t hurt a bit, will it boys?’ All Harries shake their heads. ‘We will be ever so gentle.’
‘We can do it now or later, you decide. I understand if you’re too exhausted now.’ Harry pulls Draco on his lap, giving him a tight hug. Draco hugs back, smelling Harry’s hair. It smells ridiculously good. Harry pushes him back a bit, enlarging the distance between their heads. Harry cups his cheeks. His eyes wander to Draco’s lips. ‘Can I kiss you?’
‘You don’t have to leave yet. Want some chocolates?’
She snorts and leans in to whisper in my ear: ‘Straight, my arse, swinging both ways is indefinitely more accurate’. I smile in her hair.
‘They...’ Draco can’t get himself to form the words, so he gets up instead and unbuttons his shirt. After a moment of hesitation, he lets it glide off his shoulders. He sees Harry watching him, following the trail of scars.
‘Fuck, Harry. You’ve got no idea how hot that is.’
‘I’m not ill, you sod. I’ll eat, don’t worry.’
‘Come to gloat, have you?’
Draco captures my lips in a searing kiss. We stand there, deepening the kiss and stroking each other where we can reach. He helps me pull my sweater over my head, while I unbutton his shirt, both kicking of our shoes at the same time. Not wanting to break kisscontact, I reach down to open his trousers and push them down. He unbuttons my jeans and yanks them off, together with my boxers. I try to step out of them, but of course I stumble. His strong hands catch me.
Draco turns deliberately, eyes darkened with lust. He starts undoing his lace ribbon, taking his time. ‘Wait till you see what’s underneath.’
I walk in on quite the sight. A very naked Harry is pounding into an equally naked Ginny, who rests one leg on his shoulder. I didn’t know she was that athletic. Harry quickly pulls out, his cock still hard and shiny from Ginny’s fluids.
The pounding intensifies. Harry’s close, he can tell. He feels Harry’s thrusts become slower, uneven, before he hears him groaning in his ear. ‘Bloody hell. So good.’ He almost stops moving, the thrusts slow and deep. Harry grunts as he pushes in one last time. Draco feels him shudder and pant. Harry removes his cock and lets go of Draco’s hair.
‘Why? You’re going to kill me anyway. What use is it?’
‘You have no bloody right’, Suddenly I’m yelling too, as pent-up anger surfaces, ‘No fucking bloody right to read my stuff. I’m not one of your criminals. You didn’t bring a search warrant. Last time I looked I wasn’t in an interrogation room. You have no right to go all ‘oh-I’m-the-high-and-almighty-auror’ on me. You understand? If you want to know something about it? YOU COULD HAVE BLOODY WELL ASKED LIKE A NORMAL WIZARD BEING.’ I stomp upstairs like a petulant Hogwarts first year, iWiz clutched to my chest with one hand, the other flipping him off. Hmm, I’m more upset than I thought.
He sighs. Shoulders slumping. ‘Why? So I can see you laughing in my face? I deserve this, I know. I’ve treated you so bad. Please leave, Draco. Please. Don’t torture me anymore. Leave.’ His voice is barely a whisper.
‘Good morning laddie’. His kind eyes watch Harry.
‘Shush.’ Draco holds up his hands to silence me. ‘If you ever feel this happening, I expect you to talk to me about it. Not to Ginny or someone else. Not about me, but with me. Okay?’
Harry nods. Malfoy thrusts his cock back in, making Harry gag again. It feels so good. Harry relaxes his throat, tilting his head backwards, so Malfoy can fuck his mouth better. He hears Malfoy’s groans, his breathing becoming heavy. Suddenly, he retreats. ‘I always knew you had a mouth on you, Potter. I didn’t know it could suck cock like this. If only I had known earlier.’ He smirks a lopsided grin. ‘The war might have ended a lot sooner, ‘cause I would’ve been too busy fucking you to repair the fucking closet.’ Harry feels the corner of his mouth tug up.
Harry narrows his eyes at him. ‘What makes you think I’m into that, Count Flagler?’
Just after the war, Harry spoke at my trials. I got off with no sentence because of that. We met afterwards, and the tension between us resulted in a quick snog and suck off session in the loo. Both of us were broken by the war, the need for physical contact to just feel something, anything was overwhelming. So we continued. But recently I can tell his heart isn’t with me anymore.
Hungry for more, Draco follows the trail of small brown hairs down to Harry’s prick. He carefully licks the base of Harry’s cock, tasting eggs and Harry. Harry’s cock swells even further, the tip glistening in precome. Draco teases Harry’s cock, circling around the base, tongue lapping up and down his girth.
Harry feels himself blush. The Count moves Harry’s own hands over his naked torso. ‘Feel how gorgeous your body is. How toned and yet soft.’ He trails a scar. ‘Marked by your courage and loyalty. There is nothing to be ashamed of. Look at the people around.’ Harry sees people watching them intently. ‘See how envious they are. How they wish they were me, so they could touch you.’ Harry feels his blush turning a dark crimson. He feels weirdly aroused, even if he’s uncomfortable under all this attention. He’s never liked crowds admiring him. And what if they recognize him by his scars? The Count looks at him intensely. ‘You don’t like them watching, do you?’
Draco increases the pace, his breathing already becoming irregular. He knows he isn’t going to last. He shudders as his orgasm ripples through him, making him come in his pants like a 17-year old. Trying to catch his breath, he leans into Harry, foreheads against each other. They are wheezing together.
Harry sighed and dropped Draco’s hand, walking away.
Just one damn year.
“Yes.”
TRIGGER WARNING:
He didn’t count on Ron being told to check that he was in fact asleep, so he sighed when Ron pulled on his curtain, “Yes.”
They were walking up the stairs to get to the minister’s box when Hermione grabbed Harry’s arm, holding him back from the group by a few steps. When Harry looked at her he noticed Hermione had Ron held back on her other side. She wasn’t looking at either of them, just glaring straight ahead.
“I don’t care Hermione.”
“So why are we making orange juice right here, in the courtyard?”
I'm doing a thesis and this is distracting me... Or I'm procrastinating. Don't let me.
And now he’s asking Draco to be vulnerable for him, to him. Harry’s not sure if he would be able to do that if the tables were reversed.
“You should be more careful with that hand of yours.”
Draco paused and then shrugged, “I don’t know, out of all the books I’ve read, the bible wasn’t one of them.”
And the second one, which none of the trio even considered the possibility of it leaking; Harry’s date is a boy, and Ginny got dumped. It took a bit of snooping to get that one, but eventually Ginny got to them at their end of the table and told them it was due to Ron teaching him how to dance and noticing that Harry was not learning how to lead.
Another intake of air, a longer silence, “... Fine. I’m sorry for encouraging the whole dementor fiasco.” He sounded indignant.
Harry sighed and nodded, “Your aunt, your father, the minister’s son and Peter Petigrew were all the people who knew about the hunt for my parents-”
‘I do-‘
‘I...’ Harry is speechless. His eyes widen.
Malfoy nods. ‘Do it.’
Cautious I take a small step into the greenery. Harry looks up. His beautiful face is swollen from tears, his breathing comes in small, ragged gasps. Wait, do I still think him beautiful? I’d do, don’t I? I’m so fucked. I close half the distance between me and him. Suddenly a bitter expression flickers over Harry’s face as he recognizes me.
Harry looks around, but he can’t seem to find him. Nearby a wizard in a beaked mask is leaning against the wall. He brazenly checks out Harry, lips to crotch. He pushes himself off the wall and crowds in on Harry, with catlike steps. The crowd around them is encouraging him, laughing and whooping. The wizard walks Harry into a pillar.
‘Back here. Right now.’
Loving you is a losing game
‘You’re welcome. Eat up, you need the calories for what I’ve got in store for you. You can make it up to me this evening. Love, H.’
‘I know. Why didn’t you?’
‘You wouldn’t!’ Draco suddenly doesn’t feel as self assured anymore. He starts shivering from the cold, wet spots on his trousers, come dripping from the tablecloth. He feels embarrassed and wants to flee. Or die. Whichever comes first. Harry senses his shift in emotions, and quickly casts a wandless, wordless cleaning spell. He feels Harry’s magic wash over him. His trousers dry instantly, he feels a rush of warmth in his limbs. Gratefully, he looks at Harry.
‘Yes, for fucks sake, stop teasing and start blowing!.’ Draco’s voice comes out a hoarse, wanton drawl. Draco thinks he’ll burst if Harry doesn’t suck him right now.
‘Yet’, I hear Ginny mutter. What is she implying? That I fuck Harry? Or... her?
‘But I’ve only gotten two hands. What else could I use?’ Draco flutters his lashes virtuously.
‘Malfoy, why have your eyes suddenly gotten gold?’
‘Where are you, Draco dear?’ Harry’s voice sounds borderline insane. He knows it’s not real, but it’s frightening as fuck anyways. Draco feels his legs cramp up and his ankle is throbbing, both are burning from the effort running takes. He has to take a break.
Harry tells me how nice it’s been up to now, and how it’s still not over yet. How considerate Draco is and how he saved him from eating beef tongue. A few weeks ago, I would’ve thought you’d gone bonkers if you told me that Draco Malfoy was a friendly human being, but seeing him through the eyes of Harry, I realize he must be a better man than I know.
The forest looks enchanting in the soft morning sun. Whiffs of mist float over the paths, creating a mystical atmosphere. The sun filters through the dense trees, shining in mesmerizing rays of light. Harry gasps. It looks as if he has apparated into a fairy tale. The air is crisp and cold, his breath leaving little puffs of mist. Shivering, he puts on his hood. Harry revels in the warmth the soft fabric brings.
Harry eyes him approvingly. ‘You did so well, love. I’m proud of you.’ He inclines his head and kisses Draco. The kiss is soft and tender. Harry strokes his hair. ‘Such a good pet.’ He murmurs in Draco’s mouth, deepening the kiss. Draco opens up, snogging back lazily. Reluctantly breaking apart, Harry reaches for the forks. ‘Dessert?’
‘Well, I don’t like it, so fucking stop ogling my arse!’
‘No.’
‘Okay. I’d like that. I think Umbridge is good. I’ll use it too.’
Draco feels his cock stirring. Surely, he can’t want this? A fuck on a dinner table at one of London’s most popular restaurants? He looks around and sees most of the dinner guests have left. A few couples remain, most of them not in direct vision of their table. Is he seriously considering this? He can say no. Harry would respect his boundaries, he’s sure. But he already knows he won’t. He wants this, badly.
‘Yes. Oh gods, Dray, please fuck me.’
His eyes focus on me, provocation clearly visible there. He smiles a little crooked smile and shakes his head slowly. The challenge it holds goes straight to my cock.
Are you just as excited to know what Harry will wear? I know I am (:
“Don’t say that.”
“What are you implying my father thinks about you? With me?”
The Champions are announced.
Molly paused, probably having a vague idea of how horrible the Dursleys had been to him due to the story of the bars on his windows and little slips here and there from him to Ron, and sometimes in front of the Weasleys.
Draco sighed, and as if to spite them both, very slowly opened the letter and then made sure neither of the Gryffindors could see the contents as he slowly read. And then re-read it a few times over.
Harry waited before taking a step forward, “Draco-”
But it was only for now.
“Ninety percent of the time he wasn’t even talking to you! He was trying to get Harry’s attention the only way he knows how.” Hermione yelled back at Ron, turning to look at the campsite, “I don’t think his parents are a great influence, and when the book you’re reading to learn how to live has all the wrong instructions, what else can you do but fail…”
Draco nodded, looking like he was far away in that moment.
Harry glared, “... Do you want to know, or not?”
Ron nodded, “Do you want a glass of water?”
He needed answers. And for the first time ever, he wanted them now. He was done waiting.
Draco smiled and nodded, “I’ve done what I’ve done trying to prove to someone I was worth their attention not realizing that they’ve never cared enough to begin with… What is your sin, Potter?”
Another vision... or is it a dream?
“Did you sleep there?”
And in a matter of seconds Draco’s eyes found his again and Harry desperately mouthed
And Harry’s not anything but bold and reckless.
“What were you thinking about?” Harry whispered, his voice as smooth as the howling wind, his eyes as bright as the lighting in the sky, never leaving the departing boy in front of him. Draco ignored him, walking past him to the stairs, and Harry, disgruntled, grabbed his wrist, for the first time noticing… the sleeve is not long enough to cover them.
By the time everyone began to wake up most of those words stopped sounding like words, but the meaning was engraved in his brain, so when he finished dressing he ran downstairs, not caring that neither Ron nor Hermione were ready to bodyguard him, actually appreciating that he got up and got ready earlier than them.
Fuck. Harry really wanted to tell Hermione and ask her about all the school rules and how many rules Lucius was breaking by coming to school to not just beat a student but his own child. But he needed Draco’s trust. And a plan was forming in his head.
“Yule Ball.”
Voldemort, back or not, has and will always be a constant threat on his life. Deatheaters are back. Lucius might be one of them. Which could spill over to Draco. Who was assigned to be his soulmate. But he didn’t know if he was Draco’s soulmate, so this could all be for naught. And Draco currently has a strong distaste for them, so it’s hard to talk to him. And! Now there’s so dumb tournament going on in the school that’s only permitted for the seniors so Harry couldn’t use that as a distraction, and he reaLLY WANTED A DISTRACTION!
Harry’s glare was now directed at the crowd, no one in particular, as Ron nodded and abashedly whispered, “I’ll be more quiet.”
And don’t get him wrong, he’s been trying. But apparently the damage he did was strong.
He knew of the Ravenclaw Seeker, Cho Chang, becoming close and friendly with the Hufflepuff Seeker, Cedric Diggory, and how his classmates made fun of him for a while because she was younger than him, but backed off as they saw they had each other on their wrists. No one question if they were made for each other when on their opposing wrist they both had Voldemort.
Suddenly she froze, “Wait, we are still going though, right?”
“Was it one of the slytherins?” The bruise appeared to cover half his face, clearly it had been a black eye and a bruised lip at one point, and Harry finally understood why Draco had missed three days of class. Harry tried to look back and remember if Draco had been unpleasant with anyone recently.
“Who hurt you?”
“How many nights of sleep had you lost up to that point?” Ron was genuinely curious and Harry knew why, Ron had idea up to the knock-out that Harry had a problem and he felt guilty for not picking up on it.
It was an hour later before he was let go, emotionally and psychologically tired as he walked towards his house. He heard the murmured insults and digs at him from the few students who were still hanging around, waiting for curfew, and ignored them. He was waiting outside of his dorm, waiting for The Fat Lady to finish her rant about safety and what it really meant to be brave and that the tournament was not the place to prove it when he noticed a shine of silver a few staircases down. He blatantly turned to try and find the source but it was gone. Harry sighed, thinking back on Malfoy’s emotional shift when Harry’s name was called out. Was he worried? Did he care?
Harry smiled and grabbed Hermione’s hand from his shoulder, staring at it as he rubbed her hand that laid on his right, menacing hand, looking for the bold confidence he had when he ripped his bandage off for Ron. Finally he sighed as he slowly undid the messy wrap he had done earlier, letting Draco’s elegant signature shine off his wrist.
