The death eaters emotionlessly looked at him and raised his wand, when suddenly, a smooth voice called, "Oh ! How are you, Mr. Macnair ? It's been a long time, isn't it?"
When Harry finally came to a stop, he was exhausted and heaving heavily. His muscles burned and calves wobbled but that did nothing to garner his attention, even temporarily. He stood there, as still as a statue, bathing in moonlight spilling out of the huge windows, drowning his body with it. He did not understand what he was feeling, did not understand his own emotions. Was that even possible?
"Theo, Do you feel fine now ?" Draco asked, somewhat worried.
"I know  because I am one as well."
Harry sat down on the hard ground, head leaning on the evenly checkered glass of the window beside him. He remembered how broken and helpless Draco looked minutes ago. Body burnt, heart shattered and soul torn, just laying there. Harry did not want to sympathize with him. He did not want to feel guilty. After all, it was Draco who attacked first. He was the one standing on the wrong side. He was the one who made all the wrong choices. It was him who bore the mark.  Harry was just defending himself. But what he thought and what he saw did not match. Was what he saw true or just another farce? Regardless of all these speculations, one emotion was still prominent. He wanted to fight Draco in such a way. He didn't want Draco to cry. He wanted Draco to scowl at him with disgust, to mock him mercilessly. Just like all those months back, not crying and  helpless. He was not the Draco Harry knew . His Draco did not cry alone in the bathroom. He might hate people and bully them but would never try to kill them. No. This was not Draco. With this revelation in his heart, Harry drew up his knees and silently thought about the silver haired bastard whom he liked to call 'Malfoy'. He thought about the moments when all that was between them were a petty rivalry and not war like it was now. Suddenly, those fights seemed like a privilege to him. They had the power to draw his every thought to them. Maybe it wasn't the fight itself that drew his attention but the person with whom he fought.
" Yes . I will not back up from something I have promised ."
Just then a whispered voice in his head said,
At this point, Pansy knew that this wasn't just nothing but she also knew that she cannot stop here in the middle of the forest. Who knows what would happen if she did?
Ron ignored all their questions and angrily asked, "What are you doing here ?! You are not supposed to be here !"
Harry let his magic surround Draco trapping him there , unable to move . It crackled in the air around as it let Draco feel it's power . Draco was stunned at this .
From behind him, Harry was curiously reading as a look of realisation flashed in his face. Seeing the recognition, Draco asked, " You're aware about papa, aren't you?"
The afternoon sky faded to the evening orange. Harry and Draco discussed the ways to destroy the horcrux for a long time. Concluding that right now, the only option left was for them is to carry it with them before finding a way to finish it for once and for all.
" I have already given him an antidote but it's effects are temporary because of the condition of his hand . Unfortunately, The complete antidote needs herbs which I did not have"
Maybe he was talking to himself. Maybe to his disobedient heart.
Ron looked at the picturesque scene of a natural homely beauty playing a soft tune as a smile graced her lips. He was entranced before even noticing it.
"I already told you, Parkinson, shhh~", Harry said, clearly mocking.
" You know , little one , I always wanted a son but as you can see , I was never able to fulfill this dream of mine .So can you call me father ?" The man said with soft eyes and words .
" Give it back !"
The laboured breathing of two extremely appalled boys echoed in the chamber.
With steely eyes, she uttered, "Obliviate"
The house elf answered honestly , accounting everything he knew , " Master Draco has been fine but very busy. Everyday , Master Draco will wake up exactly an hour after the break of dawn. After cleaning up and breakfast , he visits Mr. Dumbledore to check his condition before practicing new potions and spells with lunch and dinner in the middle .Master Draco has been working very hard, often skipping dinner and sleeping late. This servant wants to ask master Draco to retire early but does not dare to disturb him lest his spells and potions go wrong. Forgive this elf for not taking good care of Master Draco, Master Harry. This elf will take any punishment for his disability  "
His gloomy eyes swept across the room. As they landed in Neville, a look of sick eagerness and enjoyment on his face.
Ron's face scrunched in confusion, " Downstairs ?"
" What is it , Harry ?"
Ron silently lowered his head, he was clear about his mistake and it's consequences on all of them. In the wizarding world, the name “ Voldemort ” was a taboo. A well known and justified taboo. He had no excuses for his stupidity.
The two tiger teeth in Harry's mouth gleamed in the silver moonlight as his lips parted. His throat bobbed in eager anticipation.
After the treatment, Blaise was assured that Neville was fine and took the boy in his arms back to the Slytherin dormitory.
Hearing this, Draco's lips pursed and he was about to speak but Harry's firm voice stopped his words short.
" Well… who said there were no bodies ?" Harry said , his eyes flashing mischievously because he knew Draco would understand his implications.
For a second, no one spoke. Two pairs of eyes blankly stared at each other. It looked oddly romantic and stupid at the same time.
Harry stood there , searching Malfoy's eyes . He could see the helplessness , the tiredness and risk swirling in those silver eyes , like the dark blemishes on the face of fair moon . He kept his lips pursed tightly , his head bowed down.
" And will you keep all the information about the dark lord known from him hidden , never to disclose it without his assertion?"
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
Reining the beast in , Harry soothed the violent fluctuations in his heart . Patience , He will have his chance . And when that time comes, it will be Harry reflected in those eyes. It will be him showered with care and love and gentleness . Him , before anyone else .
She didn't want to do this. Even if it was the best option she had, even if it was the right thing to do. She still didn't want to do this. She didn't want to erase every memory, every proof of her happiest moments to be erased. She didn't want that love, those hugs to only exist in her memories. The thought of her parents forgetting her and living as if she never existed pained her. She feared that if one day she came across them on a busy road and they didn't recognise her , what would she do ? She feared that one day even she would forget these memories or mistake them for a wild dream. She didn't want that. She never wanted that.
Draco kept walking and Harry kept following . Why was Potter following him ? Was interrogating him not enough , that now he needed to escort him as well ? He was too busy in his gloating that he did not notice Harry lifting his head and looking around with wary eyes .
" It's fine , sir . It would be unsightly to bother Professor at such a late time"  ,Draco reasoned.
Neville felt responsible to answer this question , afterall the person was so nice to him . Thus, said incoherently , " Mmmm, very tired, want ….to…sleeeep~~ "
Other death eaters rudely paraded inside the train, moving from one compartment to another, scanning all the faces of children and teenagers.
Switching off the lights , Harry slipped inside the covers and sighed with delight when a warm body stuck to him . Even if the ache in his pants was painful and a torture in itself but with Draco beside him , it's fine . Wrapping his arms around the peacefully slumbering Draco , Harry closed his eyes as well.
The rage in silver eyes rose steadily, "You didn't let me finish ! I am not your fucking partner ! So how can I-"
Stepping aside , Harry moved to stand in front of him to see his eyes wide and face pale . He looked Malfoy in the eyes and smiled a very gentle smile looking especially innocent in glasses as big as half of his face and unkept hair splayed across his forehead.
" You are good people , aren't you ?
" Please . I cannot live anymore .
"Why Malfoy? Trying to escape, are we?"
Fat drops of sweat dropped down his forehead. What to do? What to do ? Listen to Master Harry or Master Draco ? If obeyed Master Draco then Master Harry will surely know . But if obeyed Master Harry then Master Draco might not find out…..
Now she was wheezing but still unwilling to leave her sentence incomplete . Her hand clutched Draco as she pleaded them .
He nodded but said sternly, " I won't let the others go that way so don't wander too far. If you aren't back in 20 minutes, I am coming to find you. And be careful of unknown presences, wizards or magical creatures. Okay ?"
Walking side by side , they soon reached the astronomy tower . Alit by moonlight , the space was empty and without the signs of anyone coming or going. Confused , Ron said, " Where are they ? How come anyone isn't here yet ?"
" Such an eager response. I am right, huh? Well, since you are a good child, would you like a , let's say, …... tiny midnight snack ?"
Heeding his advice, Draco stopped. The egg actively rolled onto his lap and settled against his stomach. It was swaying side to side while sitting there. The swings were so vigorous that Draco knew that anymore and it might throw itself off the bed. Which was exactly what happened within the next moments.
" What does Molly hate the most ?" Harry asked tersely, ready to injure them seriously if the reply was even slightly different than the answer.
Neville's eyes snapped to face him and with a strange but seething tone, said, "Well, I would hate it if your precious attention was spent on a toy like me rather than your several paramours."
-and someone special but uninvited coming to pick her up ( the start of another side ship )
The loud shout completely awoke Draco as he instantly sat up. And the first sight he saw was of a small baby sitting in a huge egg covered with disgusting transparent liquid.
Draco looked at the eager and experienced elf waiting for instruction and then at the gryffindors working lazily. In a minute, he made his decision and said, "Kreacher, You have to look at those two there and make sure they do their work properly."
" Well, do tell me if such happens. I will be very honoured to prepare a dowry for the coming family"
Feeling the gentle caress on his cheek, Draco's forehead wrinkled and head tilted.
"Humph ! Overly smug scarhead !", Draco muttered under his breath to relieve some of his anger at the teasing. If Harry had heard what Draco said, he would definitely curse him back. But right now, Harry's entire focus was on the hunched old witch.
Behind him, Harry watched the tender look in Draco's eyes and his own eyes took the colour of a jealous emerald. On one hand, he wanted to imprint this rare image in his mind. But on the other hand, he wanted to tear it apart because he knew that the love in those eyes isn't for him.
" I must ask you to accompany me to find and destroy them."
Harry lifted his neck to gaze at the dark sky as snow danced in the air, melancholy clear in his voice, "Yeah"
A tongue eagerly dipped in the palm of Harry's hand and instantaneously drew  back.
Draco nodded and hesitantly said, "E-eggie?"
" Pansy !" Hermione said , looking at her in reproach.
A gasp was heard from Draco . Draco looked at the sight in wonder . Putting his magic in the egg he tried to examine what it was . But as soon as his magic entered the egg it was rapidly absorbed by it .
Hahhhh ! The relief ! No hairy oldman buttocks !
Feigning negligence , Draco replied ," Do what , Potter? And would you mind letting my arm go ? This is highly inappropriate . "
Harry was going to trap Draco to his side like a honey-bee trapped inside a greenhouse filled with blooming flowers.
Draco turned his head to Theo and his face grew softer along with his voice, "Theo, why don't you come sit with me? Let these two weasels do the work. You don't have to dirty your hands."
And this sight of obvious sparks flying at once made the unprecedented ability of imagination in Hogwarts students awaken and take up the task. And knowing the grand ability of these students, the results are sure going to be top notch.
" When decorated with red and purple bruises and layered with pleasure and humiliation ?"
Harry Potter
After the reassurance from Hermione, Pansy's body had finally given up and collapsed from exhaustion.
A slender and fair hand touched Harry's shoulder and he , like a balloon blowing out air , breathed out all the burning anger suffocating his chest.
Ron disappeared and a hoarse and desperate cry rang out from George. He's gone. Their little brother's gone. Only leaving the two words that curdled his blood with dread :
Draco followed ," Harry and I have decided that mutually working together will benefit us more than working apart. Since all of us have essentially the same destination. "
" Fine. If it can help me gain an upper hand on Voldemort, then I am willing. But ! Before that, you have to make an unbreakable vow that whatever you said is true."
CRUNCH !
Hearing Neville's astonished voice, Blaise slowly opened his eyes and the scenery around slowly returned to the green and silver furnishing.
" Go on ,Draco . Do it . NOW !" The lure now turned into a threat and the pale shivering hand of a helpless boy tightened around his wand.
When it was finally the day, Draco woke up with a grim appearance. Every thought in his head was about the impending task. The morning passed and he did not see Harry at all as he finally felt his own nativity at trusting him at such a level . All of his snakes were hyper aware and alert, doing their ordered job flawlessly. The palpitations in his heart were fluttering as every second passed.
The voice of an old elf sounded. Harry turned around and was surprised to see Kreacher standing there.
Tearing his gaze away from Draco , wordlessly and wandlessly casted a cleaning spell in him. The egg which had been silent for a long time , unwilling to disturb their discussion now actively rolled to Draco , nudging him here and there.
- the attack on Draco as he escapes the black manor with theo.
After some time , he said in a worried and shivering voice , " Oh my god ! My wife's all alone downstairs ! What do I do ?"
(Your mother's eggs*- just a stupid slang i made myself .)
An enchanting and beautiful woman was laying on the hard ground  , curled up against a huge egg . She was cleary wounded greatly by the blood polling around her . The sight was gruesome but beautiful in a sick and bloody way . A blood-bathed beauty .
And Hermione also vividly remembered how she forgot this within just 10 minutes of it happening.
With that Harry got up, took off his shoes and shamelessly climbed the beauty's bed.
Up or down ?
" Could you not do that ?" The look in Ron's eyes was of anger as he stood up and grabbed his luggage and turned to leave without a word to either of them .
Hermione immediately followed, " He's still go it "
Harry was serious.
In the inner room, a huge egg was rolling around, wrecking things left and right. When it noticed Draco's presence it stilled for a second and then started to excitedly swinging in the same place.
Harry's lids halfway dropped as he lazily swirled the liquid in his cup and leisurely sipped it. He wanted to remember this taste, he might never have it again. The green in his eyes swirled like the orange liquid swirling in his cup, just like a tornado pulling everything in it.
"You healed me ?"
" No. Listen to me. I'll meet you there. Go "
Looking up  Draco softly asked out of curiosity, " How did you do it ?"
Harry kept looking at Draco as he stared at him in a daze. At some point a slight, almost unnoticeable, pink bloomed on his neck and up to his cheeks and ears and at the same time a pair of pale red lips shaped into a full blown scowl directed at Harry with such intensity as if plotting his murder, which Draco was.
" Could be anything . Mont common of object for example a diary or a ring "
- did Draco actually die ??? We will find out .
And the most important one, why did you think about Neville suffering through slut-shaming ?
A stick inside the pants….
In the room of requirements , Draco and Harry silently dressed up for the upcoming day . They unknowingly spent the entire weekend in this chaos . Now that Monday was here ,  reality struck them like a brick on the head . They hastily readied themself.
Without delay, Draco got the dried herbs and animal ingredients he had out of his ring. Gathering the ingredients together, Draco willed his magic to lift up the materials in air and finely crush them together. The plant and animal parts slowly mushed together forming a dough. Satisfied with the mixture, Draco then willed his magic to identify the useless particles and impurities in the mixture to seperate them. With a flick of Draco's wand, some red and black substances gradually started evaporating and coming out before dispersing in the air. These were the impurities. Now that the small mixture was clean and clear of side-effects, it was ready for consumption.
" Hmm" replied Harry , sparing the hardworking elf an approving glance . He had initially told the elf to not call him master but he insisted that it was a very important custom. Overthat, this elf was a very diligent one , even learning to correct the grammatical mistake in his speech. Harry didn't want to make him upset and so after that Harry never corrected him when he called him master.
"Potter ! What are you doing ?!" Draco asked furiously. Now, he had to redo the entire ritual again. But then he saw Harry's next action and a horror rose in his heart.
Harry and Draco shared a silent tacit look as Draco said , " We need to find the horcruxes as soon as possible and that is what we will be doing . "
Hermione clearly knew that Pansy didn't have any obligation to shield her from that curse at the ministry, just like she didn't have any obligation to pick her up from her house. But she still did. And it wasn't because of anything other than her own heart.
Harry's deep voice uttered softly, " I am sorry "
Sleep came easily to him after that. Pulling him into the dream about a small waterfall amidst a flowering herb valley. It smelled so pleasant , so addictive.
At this point , Harry had terrified the whole gryffindor table and some students in his proximity even had cold sweat dripping down their back . Sitting beside him , Ron had a HD+ and ultra definition view of the horror scene . It was a miracle he did not start crying like Neville four seats ahead .
Warm tears dropped on the bony and pale fingers. He raised his head up to the sky hidden by the marble ceiling. His eyes were red and wet. The glassy layer over those orbs gleaming desperation.
Pouncing on Harry with an angry sneer, Draco grabbed his collar to say ," What are you sighing at ?! You think you are better than me ?! You hypocrite ! Bastard ! Idiot! Smelly Pig !"
" Did he ?" , Harry expected no less . It did not surprise him in the least .
with a
The continuous footsteps were drawing closer and closer and soon the black and grey dress adorning a woman with jet black curls was seen . The lady was a sight of wonder , of dread, of grief . The maddened gleam in her eyes made her look dead even if she was alive. In the dim light of dark clouds, she seemed like the beloved mistress of death and pain herself.
[T/N :- Tell honestly, guys - all of us have had this moment with that hot doctor or nurse, haven't we? Don't lie! Come on! Out with it! I want to know that it wasn't just me drooling like a pervert when the hot dentist put her fingers in my mouth !!! ]
" Indirect apartion "
A graceful smile rose on Pansy's face, "Of course it is.  This is the place where I sit, it has to be the best. Obviously, it will be noticed and used by others"
With a chuckle , Draco nodded and Harry continued, "So first , Voldemort is planning an attack on the school . We need your full cooperation . A week from today, Death eaters will enter the school "
Theo shortly continued, " If shortened , then it says-
Harry's wand silently rose but before he could do anything, the front door opened by itself.
somehow
Draco slowly stood up, saying, "The wound is healed but he needs at least a day to collect the lost strength"
A beat of silence was soon ended as the the lift tinged , " Ground level "
Harry calmly said , " You're lying, Dolores. And one mustn't tell lies "
The eye-contact was shortly cut off by the voices above drawing their attention. " This is your moment, Draco . Do it " Bellatrix encouraged as if a demon luring it's wished sacrifice closer.
- Harry's care for Draco
Ron : ( ಠ_ಠ )
Drawing the cloak to completely cover them , he looked down to see a very stiff Malfoy holding the egg in an awkward way so as to not touch Harry .
Now that we are soon going to start the main arc and adventure , how are your reviews on the fic till now ?
Harry snapped out of his dark thoughts when the door creaked again and this time it were certain gryffindors who entered. Hermione and Ron were quick in action while Neville was shocked into a statue.
He was finally done. His life was complete. He could go now, he could rest.
Noticing Harry's expression changing from thoughtful to extremely cautious, he asked, "What's the matter ?"
-  And ... ( Drumroll )..... SMUT !!!  with actual touching this time but still not all the way . And I'll be truthful it has *whispers* somnophilia.
Before anyone could say anymore, Harry spoke up, "Hermione, I need to see Malfoy."
His face twisted with the thought. No ….not likely then what ? Ron couldn't think of anything else. Without even him realising his chance came to enter the ….toilet ….
Harry was having quite a fun . It was vividly amusing to watch the perfect proud pureblood being so twitchy .
No one answered. Their never nerves freezing from the cold anger directed towards them. With a scowl , Harry stood up.
" My wand ! Give it back !" Neville said , pointing towards the wand in his hand.
The frown on Blaise's brows eased and he teasingly said, "Is my precious toy jealousy?"
Looking down , Harry smirked," Well , I am not just anyone, am I ? After all we took a-"
Again in the room of requirements, Harry sat on the sofa beside Draco's , patiently waiting for certain people. They had sent urgent letters to their respective mates , asking them for an audience.
In came the figure of a fat and clearly disgusting man from the look on his face and deceit in his eyes. Kreacher sitting on his head , clutching his nose through the finger in his nostrils and Dobby holding on to his leg made it difficult to walk making his limp instead.
" Then why don't you come along, sir. This is urgent you see." ; Harry said, slightly lifting Draco higher and closer into his embrace .
Before Draco could say anymore , a peculiar sound like the clanking of utensils was heard from the kitchen beside the living room they were in .
"What is what-",. Harry turned towards where Draco pointed.
If Draco was playing tricks or if Harry was going bonkers was unclear. But what was sure was that Voldemort was stupid. Why kill people to make horcrux when there was Draco ? One soft glare and a soul tears in two. One small smile and a soul tears into a hundred. Draco would be a hot commodity for future dark lords. If he ever wanted to open a shop in diagon alley the name would go something like -
Harry looked on with confusion as Draco moved around, "What are you doing?"
A serious look overtook Draco , as he said," Papa , we have to perform the ritual today . "
" The same way you came in . You will be transported through one of my arrays . But I advise you not to do so . The reasons the array harmed you so much that you fainted was because of the instability of your body which further aided the instability of the array and ultimately got distorted ."
The sweet scent of maple syrup and warm scent of pancakes made his tummy grumble like a small beast with a witty conscience.
Heading out, Harry lifted his head to see the purple tint painting the sky . It was already nightfall. They needed to get out of here. The forest wasn't safe after dark. He was quickly making his way towards Hagrid's hut when he came across the sight of Professor Slughorn collecting the sap of a Bluethorn tree. Bluethorn sap was a precious potions ingredient and very expensive. The knowledge that Hogwarts had a Bluethorn tree was known to few.
, Hermione thought, as her eyes darkened with a coveting daze.
Harry : ( - _ - )
Everything was fine and merry but it didn't last that way.
The sound slowly echoed in the silent space.
All the while, her eyes were trained on the Headmaster who uttered with mock cheer, " Good evening , Bellatrix. I think introductions are in order don't you ? "
The threat did not even faze Harry as his eyes remained the same , hard , cold and resolut . He looked right in Draco's eyes as he grabbed his forearm and pulled him . Draco's back collided with a hard chest . Harry had his right hand holding Draco's left wrist trapping his waist and his left hand on Draco's mouth . This position had entirely trapped Draco .
He did not need to say which pact . It was clearly obvious as to which pact Draco referred to when he made the request to Harry.
Cold grey eyes meet mirth filled green ones , " Shut up , Potter. We purebloods are schooled in castration as well "
Entering the first tent to see Ron and Hermione sleeping on the hard ground, Draco quickly went to work. His magic very slowly grazed through Ron's body for several minutes before the soft blue glow dimmed.
"I-i" but before he could say anything , Harry interrupted.
He sat there as Draco checked his body from front to back and from left to right. Honestly, he was enjoying this too much to be considered normal and not crazy or perverted.
A cold shiver ran down her back.
Looking at Draco's face again, Harry realised that it wasn't the pout that did the magic but this entire person. So, don't dare to underestimate his words, when he says-
Draco slowly scanned her face , searching for something , before asking, " Did you recognise either of them ? "
Trying to get his mind straight to them , Harry said," Do you have any useful solution?"
Hermione knew that Pansy lied. Harry might have told Pansy about her plan to Obliviate her parents but her friend will never ask her to accompany Hermoine. He knew full well that she wasn't that weak and spineless. Thus, it ultimately means that Pansy came here out of her own obligation.
She smiled wryly as Draco again washed her with his soothing magic .
" We wouldn't even be able to reach here  if you knew how to take care of yourself and not to get so severely hurt !"
The intel he got from Ron about what was happening in the Weasley household was far more useful than Harry initially thought. As written in the letter , Mr. Weasley and the order of pheonix were actively planning something. While Ron had no idea about what it might be, Harry did. As a result, Urgent letters were immediately sent to six awaiting recipients.
Draco looked at the child with all the dirt and slime on her and frowned saying, "Potter, why don't you bring some warm water and a swaddle cloth. Let's bathe her first."
Draco was terrified , the gloomy emerald of Harry's eyes scared him. They were atrocious. He was scared stiff. And he remained so even after Harry pulled him up and silently dressed him in his uniform robes again.
The death eaters turned around, one of them saying, " Heir Zabini. I didn't expect you to come forward and make such pleasant greetings with us"
Alas, he should not think of this now. It's never wise to worry about a problem that might not even come true. It's better to focus on the present and keep an eye on the future.
He waited for them to suggest something as they usually did but none of them spoke for the next couple of minutes as Harry realised that they were hesitant .
" What does Young master request of Kreacher ? "
' Alas, I owe all of them too much. I don't even know if I will ever be able to even repay it all ' Draco thought while looking at Harry.
Draco noticed more of the purple hue but now on the ground as it made a trail ending inside a dark cave nearby .
Draco had spent the day gathering and sorting out the items he needed and his plan after doing this.
A twig crunched behind him . Draco turned back and found a very confused potter there standing there . Stunned , Draco stood there , staring at Potter as he stared back . His mind in a panick as he wondered if Potter saw what him perform wandless magic but then decided against it and struggled to squash his anxiety .A small moment from potter brought him back as he quickly analysed his situation and decided on getting out of here as fast as possible .
Be healthy and be safe , but most importantly -
" what should we do with the egg?" ; Harry asked.
Draco's face immediately became glum. He understood Harry's implication. Now that they have assassinated Dumbledore , the only threat to the dark lord is Harry.
Draco's eyes lit in irritation and he asked coldly, "Why do you care?"
With Love ,
Swiftly changing his clothes into his nightwear , Harry unhesitatingly slipped inside the covers . Willing his magic to draw the curtains tight , Harry scooped the lithe body in his arms as darkness fell on both of them.
Harry looked at his side to Draco. This person , as cold and as biting as snow , inexplicably cooled his boiling anger from just a touch. He easily caught the wordless implication in Draco's eyes and slowly retreated to sit back down.
Harry stoned his face as he stared at Draco with cold and unmoving eyes. Trying to unveil what he actually was .
Harry stilled and stared at Dumbledore as he stared back before they started both laughing so loud that Harry had tears in his eyes.
{ Being an antique piece* -  having a different or peculiar personality compared to others . Like an rare antique art piece between hundreds of commonly found art pieces .}
The shrill cries of Dementors , who had broken through the layer , was heard and dread set into their blood. The lift at the end of the hallway looked like a boon to them now.
The sight of Harry's face had Draco utterly broken. It was as if a cool touch of ice was spreading through his veins , mixing with the tense muscles in his body. But then why did it feel like he had a piece of burning coal stuck in his chest ? It was burning , blazing , flaming right there at the center of his chest. It hurt …. It hurt but it felt good as well. It was so confusing, so utterly unlike Draco . It overwhelmed him like a dark cloud filled with grief , with dread , with despair that he had felt standing at the brink of murdering someone.
In this chapter -
Taking the egg with him , he silently slipped out . Once out of the room , he put the egg in his ring storage and made a run for the dormitories . Reaching his bed he slipped inside the drapes to pull them down and cast spells to keep them so .
. It's worn like a bowtie ."
some minutes ago ?"
Seeing that Harry stopped, Draco looked at the ruins and quickly understood. He silently stood beside Harry, waiting for him to notice.
"Hey, Oldman, can you tell what he put in here?" Harry asked Eloise.
The witch's eyes gleamed with an inscrutable approval, "Oh ! Truly a gentleman with sharp eyes as I had expected. A truly good item you have chosen."
" I know what the situation demands of me , Potter . But what I do not know is your credibility . How do I trust you ?" ; Malfoy's voice was a mere whisper , filled with an empty void . The words brushing his ears like a frigid wind .
The voice saw this sight with his invisible eyes and huffed but compromised and continued in a wronged childlike tone, giving people an unshakable urge to coax, if not for the voice indicating that the person was at the age of one's grandpa.
Theo, a rich young master, readily agreed and happily skipped to sit besides Draco. George and Fred looked at each other with ugly faces. Not only were they made personal servants of a notorious young master but the cutie beside them was also called away.
" Hurry! Kill it! Enter his body, you idiot! ", Eloise screamed in the background.
And the realisation struck Draco like lightning. He looked at the bloody wound on Harry's neck and quickly took out a vial of dittany from his small bag.
The rotten man , still said with a breed filled voice , " Why ? Was it valuable ?"
How is it going till now ? I expect all of you to be well and healthy and thankyou for reading my fanfiction .
Hermione vividly remembered the heavy blue of Pansy's eyes as they shone with reassurance that she was safe but soon dimmed with the pain.
Then why ??
The anxiousness gnawing at Draco's heart was increasing steadily.
Draco looked at the blankness in Harry's eyes and the same ache again ignited in his chest. His palm rose to press on his warm chest. '
He rushed forward, hugging Draco together with eggie.
Eloise's silvery swords cut the connection between the silver threads and black skull.
"Be a little more careful. You are still supposed to be dead, you know.", Harry said teasingly.
- the reveal of Dumbledore's will.
A dread rose in Draco's heart as he looked at Harry's face and lowered eyes. Eyes wide in horror , Draco ran out of the room tripping and falling . Like this Draco entirely forgot what he was going to say and ran in a flustered manner.
" You will stay here ?"
Option D : Run !!!
Draco bowed his head to look at the elf and said with a barely there smile, " This locket belonged to your master Regulus and so it rightfully belongs to you now"
On the other end, Draco was going through books at the speed of light. Books piled beside him but he found nothing. Finishing another book, he got up to pull the next book from the shelf when he noticed the scribble on the shelf beneath the book. It looked old and almost faded and  hand written. The language was unknown, he noticed.  Just as he touched it, an array lit up right beneath his feet. Draco's eyes blew wide in fear.
Draco's eyes widened as he uselessly tried to shield his body, "What are you doing, Potter?!"
" He fainted in the corridor so I bought him here "
A bruise was forming on his face. Even so, he did not protest and did not cry. There weren't many people able to make him react and she wasn't one of them. She was too lowly in his eyes for his words.
Blaise looked cautiously at the professor as the man said maliciously, "I noticed that in all the students, you particularly liked last class, didn't you?"
It was moving towards the dark mark on his arm, Draco realised. The wisp entered the dark mark surrounding it entirely and Draco convulsed in pain. He felt as if his whole body was shredding to pieces. He could hear Luar telling him to keep steady, that it was almost done but Draco knew that there was no going back now. If they did not remove the dark mark, he would die. That was what the wisp was doing . Because they wanted to remove it , it chose to end Draco rather than let him go.
The doors of the lift closed and Ron stood their stunned .
- Eggie and his father/protector( basically Harry)
Harry wound his arm around the slim waist and pulled the pliant body on his lap. He quickly adjusted Draco to have him leaning on Harry's front while hands wound around Draco's waist.
Draco knows that they care and worry and he also wants to tell them but this might unknowingly pull someone totally away from it into the mess, if it spreads. So he keeps his mouth shut as his friends keep giving him glances and stares but do not utter a word.
Fred followed, "Doe it hurt? What happened to you?"
Harry sat in the midst of the close knit circle as his companions anxiously held their breaths.
The rage and anger in Harry's eyes was overflowing, threatening to break out. How? How can he be so stupid ?! Calling that cursed name out loud even after knowing what it does !
Blood and human carcass was across the floor.
Entering the astronomy tower, Draco saw the sight of an old hunching man with their back facing him. Probably hearing his footsteps, the old figure turned around and revealed a bespectacled saintly face.
Eyes gentle but words as harsh as knives. This is how Pansy was. Hermione understood this and didn't mind. Instead, she took the plate in Pansy's hands and carefully helped her take out all the fish bones before giving it back.
He never wished for more, only for an acknowledgement. An acknowledgement from him which he never got and never will get.
Harry's eyes gleamed brilliance as his lips arched more and more . " I know. So relax. We will figure it out. "
Seeing Draco stop and hesitate to touch him, Harry felt a twinge of disappointment and aggreivation. He said somewhat urgently, "Why did you stop ?!"
They instantly let Ron go, squatting down, George guilty asked, " Sorry, were we too hard ?"
With his ready wand pointing at the elder, Draco asked with suspicion, " Who else is here ? I have heard you talking. "
At the same time Ron entered as well . Now , what to do ? Shitting is not an option. So what ?
In front , a tall skinny man with half bald head stood and with him came none other than their primary target - Dolores Umbridge.
" Y-yes, Master Harry !!" The house elf's voice was jubilant and cheerful. He was clearly very happy and walked with a slight skip and bounce in his steps.
, shall we?", The professor said eagerly.
Even if he hoped for it , he still wasn't sure if that was the case. He needed a last conformation before he could let go of this dread in his heart.
Harry had seen people die and seen people kill. Fear wasn't something that came easily to him. Such a sight wasn't as dreadful to him as it was for Ron. Somewhere along the years Harry's heart had cooled down and frozen to pain and dread on himself and others.
After saying this , Luar  took Draco to one of the glass shelves kept against the pillars . Inside the shelf were many small and medium men's jewellery and other accessories . All of them were elegant , refined and suited for aristocratic gentlemen like Luar and Draco . It was just then that Draco's gaze drifted over and stopped on a green-coloured , diamond and gold immured ribbon with a silver and emerald brooch on it  .
Draco slowly opened the headmaster's mouth to look at what he consumed to affect his health. Dipping the tip of his index finger inside, he collected the residue of a black-tinted transparent liquid.
" Mary ?"
Draco carefully leaned forward and sunk his teeth in the exact same spot that Nagini had bitten off. The bite was deep as Harry's blood gushed out.
With hurried steps, Blaise took Neville to the medical wind, eager to know that Neville was alright.
Silence fell on them like winter mist, enveloping and encompassing. As they walked, Draco spotted a brightly lit storefront. On this particular holiday, it was an odd sight for any business to be open.
A gryffindor girl ,sitting somewhere near the middle, forcefully tried to hide her shivering hands out of fear. She was scared that she might be next.
Harry looked at Draco and nervously said, "Call her again."
Pansy's gaze begged her, "Is there truly no way?"
Draco thought sitting in a cloud in the expanse of blue skies, happily floating. Looking down he saw that there was nothing here. So he again lay down to look at the sky above.
Blaise's eyes softened at the confession, "But here you are, crying miserably."
In the elder's eyes only pride and assurance shone as he smiled more happily and merrily than ever.
Last summer, while reading at the Malfoy manor, he found some useful spells. One of them taught how to entirely conceal your magic and presence. This method called
Harry did not stop even after that, he kept going, kept chasing his own release. He felt his manhood pulse and soon he was biting a pink bud on Draco's chest and cumming in him. The sweet taste of blood was swimming on his tongue.
Harry was pliant when Draco quietly grabbed his hand and - BITE!
His eyes flashed a hint of worry and grief for his mother before it disappeared as quickly as it came, "Narcissa. Narcissa Malfoy neé Black "
" Okay , okay "
As soon as the young house elf caught the sight of Harry , he exclaimed , " Harry Potter ! So long it's been !"
"Was it you in my head ?"
- Draco's gentle control and Harry's hard control dynamics . So , basically Draco is the softer , gentler leader whereas Harry's the harder and tougher leader. They balance each other out. Like a king and queen , you can say.
Draco: "AHH!"
With a face scowling with disgust and anger, he stood up and loudly shouted so that each and every ear in the vicinity heard him, "Hey ! He isn't here,  losers!"
Student 1 : "OHhhhhhh~"
In this chapter ,
Sitting on the couch to make themselves comfortable , Draco started to wrap the egg up with a blanket , thinking
Hermione promptly stopped asking, smartly giving Harry some space. Around them, complex emotions flashed in the six pairs of eyes. All of them were curious as to what Harry saw and who was this Gregorwitch ? Even with the questions in their heads, the silence outside prevailed. They all clearly knew that if it was something worth knowing they would naturally be informed sooner or later.
Hermione's eyebrows shot up in surprise, " And you agreed ?"
Dumbledore anxiously followed , questioning, " Draco , my child. Are you fine ? Such an extreme reaction is uncommon. Is your body in good health ?"
Harry looked on as wrinkled and shaky hands tried to light a simple matchstick but failed again and again. Finally exceeding his patience, Harry slowly grabbed the matches and successfully lit a candle.
As soon as Harry had stepped inside the house, he had already checked the perimeter with his magic. Finding that there was no other presence in the house other than the three of them, Harry let down a bit of his guard. Afterall, what could be the worst thing an old hag with one foot already in the grave could do ?
" You can't wake up a man who was never asleep and you can't keep alive a man who already wants to die "
Ron truly looked pitiful , his eyes were lowered and lips set in a downward arc. He looked like he was about to cry any second. Ahh ! He was truly adorable ! Like an overgrown puppy !
Harry looked at the sleepy and content child in Draco's arms and said in amazement, "How did you do that?"
" A natural talent cannot be identified just by looking at the face , Draco . It is something that will be known when you finally master it - if you master it . And by that time , even if you are , it's of no use . Talent can be cultivated but determination cannot . That's what you need Draco ."
Blaise knew that this wasn't much of a protection, but this was the only thing he could do to protect a reckless and ridiculous gryffindor desperately hated by the dark side. This was the only way which allowed him to keep Neville by his side and subsequently not alert the death eaters in Hogward's.
Fuck !!! Your father's eggs* !!!! He even knew how to use it !!! With this Draco felt his legs trembling slightly .
" Mate , you can't be serious ! These slimy snakes cannot be trusted. Mate , you know that they are absolutely rotten bastards ! " , Ron followed.
Harry and Draco stood in front of the broken shell pieces with a stunned expression. They looked at the broken shells and then to the child in Draco's arms.
The balance which already wasn't steady soon disappeared making the man collapse face on to the floor.
Afterall, talent and usefulness does not see age. A young student can be much more useful than a trained auror while an experienced minister can have a son with a brain worth thousands of his father's.
Harry couldn't let these 'i-know-everything you-know-nothing' fools ruin his plans. Even if his team was made of few and young , but they were smart and skilled with thorough vigilance and quick solutions. Most importantly, they are trustworthy. And right now, what Harry needs the most are trustworthy subordinates who will never betray and nor fool him. They will do his bidding perfectly and skillfully, without a glitch and without a mistake.
The sun went down and so did Draco's anger. Hermione slowly supported a haggard Pansy to sit beside the fire. Her face was wrought with exhaustion and tiredness of the sick. Draco and Theo were immediately beside her to attentively cater her needs.
" Yes ! I just asked you one thing ! To protect them and not to come pouncing here !"
Draco's magic slided along their bodies as if a jet of cool water flowing along their skin.
2. A more funny Draco from outside pov .
Draco stared at the baby and the baby stared at Draco.
Kreacher, who saw that these two lazy boys were idling again, shouted, "Why did you stop?! Keep working, we still have a heap of fishes to clean ! Master Draco needs these within an hour ! Work fast you lazy boys!"
He wanted to say.
Mundungus slowly walked around the dining table in the middle of the dining room , " What are you trying to do ? Sending these wretched house elves to kidnap me , are you ? "
This trick absolutely did not work on Draco but made him narrow his imaginary eyes instead. Draco was still wary but powerless as well. His body was still unable to move and his magic still locked inside. He had no way to defend himself if the voice attacked him. He was defenseless and vulnerable. Now, he could only wait and watch. This could  as well be the day of his death . Thousands of scenarios flashed by in Draco's head as he grew restless. Hopefully he will he able to celebrate his next birthday.
He answered with a single word ," Horcruxes " and Draco's eyes blew impossibly wide as he jerked his head towards their Headmaster. That explained the terror in the elder's face.
" Looks like you are back . I did not expect you to take so long . And it's master or teacher to you , brat . "
" My plan is to let people think and scheme and watch as they fall in their own schemes "
Pansy doubtfully looked at the old and withered house elf , saying, " Maybe he knows where the real locket is "
They instinctively turned around.
Seating himself in one of the chairs , he waited for the main topic to reveal itself. Which came soon as Dumbledore continued," Harry, Do you remember what I asked of you? Have you gotten anything from professor Slughorn ?"
Looking at the man in front of him , Draco thought
The surrounding fell silent and Harry could feel the subtle pressure in the air rising.
, She thought as she kept on hungrily taking lungful of the scent.
According to the book,  Pansy should have died by now. But she didn't. Hermione was sure that the curse had hit Pansy and that she should be affected. But it seemed as if something blocked and held off the curse. Something that was inside Pansy.
Harry's eyes narrowed, " Who was she ? The witch ? Do you know her ?"
" No , not that . Malfoy rings are enchanted. Going in there is not hiding but imprisoning yourself "
" It was you, wasn't it !! When he said that he had what he needed he meant you, didn't he ?"
The calm felt as if the silence before a storm.
And for once in his life , Ron used his brain! Note this time and date people ! We need to make this the International intellectuals day ! What was today's date anyway ? Ahh ... nevermind.
were the words in Harry's mind . It was such a wonderful picture . Draco , in his house , waiting for him to come back home, Beautiful and soft only for him . This fantasy was immensely pleasurable even in just imagination.
Harry could feel Malfoy's magic , cool and calm .  If comparing Harry's magic to Draco's then Harry's was like the magma swirling and boiling in the depth of earth , tightly controlled while Draco's magic was like a single pearl at the bottom of a deep dark sea , silent and cold . One inexorably dangerous and the other cryptically mysterious .
It was done. Suddenly all of them felt a very familiar and intimate feeling in their hearts. It felt like meeting a long lost friend or one's family after a long time. The familiarity between them not only amazed them but also assured them. Maybe it was because of the contract . Or maybe it was because of the surety that they can unhesitatingly trust eachother. A leisure and happy aura filled their small bubble as conversations and apologies were made.
- Harry and the rest successfully escspe the ministry but Ron was injured.
Looking at the sight in front of him ,
These words seemed comical and superficial and only for saying and not actual action. But when Harry said them, he meant to follow them through.
Deciding to draw his attention , Harry gruffly said ," Malfoy "
Hand running down to Draco's throat , gently rubbing the small protrusion . It was a wonder that the tiny ball wasn't running up and down but slightly trembling .
But this realisation didn't diminish the guilt and regret.  Just like she was a little cruel to those who didn't matter to her, she also wasn't ungrateful to those who did help her.
Draco admits that he feels guilty but not to an extent to make him cry or mourn because he had always known that Dumbledore was never as simple as he made himself look. Dumbledore had knowingly let people suffer but did nothing to stop them even when he could and sometimes even send them right in the beast's belly. He was as disgusting as the death eaters. Never to be trusted. Draco could help and trust but what guarantee did he have that he would not be made into a virgin offering to the devil in the name of being a righteous sacrifice. What guarantee did he have that another Dumbledore would not come around. No, he could not put their life on line.
They both knew that there was no way to hide things now . Both of them had revealed their ace cards . The only option they now had was a co-operation to attain their respective goals . Over that , they were handed this mysterious egg of unknown origin .
Another detail is that here Harry and Ginny were never together. They are ambiguous but have never done anything remotely like a couple.
After reading it, a confused expression settled on Draco's face as he wondered. Where did Liar go? What did he mean by latching on to the powerhouse beside him?
Undesirable No. 1
As the night progressed, this heat only grew, not subsiding an inch. Harry gritted his teeth. He was at his limit now. Anymore and he'll do something really bad.
Harry suppressed the laugh bubbling out of him as he struggled to keep a cold face. He was successful in doing so but Dumbledore still saw the humour in his eyes even though his face was unexpressive. Stopping, Dumbledore sighed with a fond look in his gaze as he looked at Harry ," My boy, you have grown so much. You were the height of my waist when you first came to Hogward's. It's been such a long time already. You are almost as tall as me now. And soon the chick will leave the nest and fly away high. So high that I won't be able to even look at you"
Harry continued, now cool and calm by Draco's deliberate grace, catching everyone's gaze one by one , slowly letting them understand his words and actions.
Harry's eyes took on an annoyed gleam but his face remained impressively impassive .
As their words came to an end, the sky completely darkened as well. Hermione came out of the tent, to call out , "Malfoy ! Harry ! Come and have something to eat!"
" How did you deal with them ?"
Harry who was standing on the top of the astronomy tower looked down the last time to make sure that what he wanted was actually done.
Sitting beside Umbridge were Hermoine and Pansy , flanking both the sides. Hermione looked at him worriedly , fearing for the next outcome and somewhere for the woman's life.
Hello Readers,
Draco's eyes opened as he said, "He's  fine. No fever, infections or weakness. He will be fit to travel by tomorrow morning"
" I am fine , Headmaster. Just some mishap during positions " Draco lied and Harry did not object. It depends on Draco what he wants others to know about him.Harry did not need and wish to say otherwise.
The chapter updated are at a faster frequency nowadays . Inspiration just comes in loads .
" I will be going there tomorrow morning.", Harry said and with this firmly closed the chattering mouths.
The foil covering the plates lifted to reveal a stack of pancakes topped with butter and maple syrup on top. Harry handed Draco one of the plates and took the other for himself.
Harry raised a sword-like eyebrow as he looked at her. Silently questioning her.
Sweat dripped down Ron's forehead as he said,
Slughorn released a tired breath before continuing.
Draco had already known that staying in a place for too long wasn't possible. Two teenage boys barely legal , travelling around with huge bags. They had already been suspicious enough.
Draco could sense the sadness and melancholy in Harry's voice when he mentioned his parents. Without saying anything further, he silently walked beside Harry.
" You know I wanted to visit you but Harry found out and did not let me. I missed you so much, Draco." She said while sitting beside the chained and cuffed Draco.
Pansy : "...."
- Harry has started to feel more intensely towards Draco .
" I will ", Draco whispered while staring right back at Harry, not trying to hide even an inch of his heart .
Harry , in response to Draco's disbelief, shrugged nonchalantly. By his behaviour, it was evident that it didn't hold any importance in his eyes. Draco decided to just behave like he never knew. Afterall who would like to admit that someone else was stronger than themselves ?
"You are going to stay here ?"
Headmaster was situated in the guest room as soon as they came here. A group of house elves were stationed here as well, tasked with looking after the house and the headmaster.
CRACK !
So another question, I asked you guys if you wanted siblings for eggie's . If yes then how ? Mpreg ? Magical? Same as eggie ? Adopted?
(°–°)
Harry was absent from this universe for the majority of the day, swimming in his own head. Ron and Hermione were quite worried as they looked at him. And Ginny was even more astonished at the sudden decrease of attention given to her and continued to linger around Harry for the rest of the day, vying for his attention but getting none. At the end of the day there was an ugly sneer on her face, totally different from the usual sweet smile.
- Harry gets another vision from Voldemort due to his scar.
From behind Harry, Draco's gentle but forceful voice uttered, "Leave it for later. Rest for now and don't think too much"
, Harry thought.
" Ah. I had a brief meet with Master Luar that day in the cave. Actually, when I saved you, it was with the help of my master. If I were to be honest, Master Luar seemed to be uncomfortable around master. He seemed to be wary but still expectant. And soon after your condition stabilized, he left saying that he will be back and Master stealthily followed him. I felt that they must have a shared past but I am not completely sure"
Harry's eyes scanned around but he wasn't affected by the stares and kept his calm , saying , " Honestly , I don't know and I don't want to know as well "
Soon, Draco and Harry were standing in an abandoned mansion in the middle of nowhere. This mansion was originally a part of the Potter Cynn*. But was later forgotten due to its isolated location. Fortunately, this is the place they urgently needed in this situation.
Harry ran towards them, " What happened?"
Draco still stood facing Harry, pretending to be talking with him to let Harry unobstructively observe the opponent. It was just that he didn't know that Harry had already blown the cover long ago.
He looked up to Harry's eyes, " No, let's just check. It's never too much to just make sure"
Still he could not bear to leave just like that . So he cupped her face in his hands and said ," You know I love you , right . I was happy here . But now I have to go . This isn't where I belong and you aren't real , are you ?"
" And what if that doesn't work ?" He asked , but the lift had already left with no one in sight.
His hands frantically reached for his pockets for his wand but returned empty. His eyes wildly looked around and finally landed on the seductive smirk sporting an equally seductive face of an ever seductive person. And coincidentally the same person had his wand .
[ eethu* - the noise made when spitting ]
Such thoughts ran amoke in his brain, feeling it up with wet pink lips and a withering warm body. Physically brushing these images aside, he diverted his attention to the worn out and totally spent boy unconscious in his embrace.
Harry's eyes were stuck on Draco, not wanting to miss even the tiniest trembling of his lashes and the quietest huff of his breath.
save him . Please save my child " She wheezed with tears running down her bloody cheeks . Her breath grew laboured as she tried to force her words out . It was then that her neck rapidly started turning purple and she clutched it in a frenzy , her arms and legs thrashing around , withering from agony .
- the understanding between Draco and Harry.
Draco coldly looked at the elf and calmly said , " Do you know what is happening to the house elves still at the Malfoy manor ?"
Looking at the half filled lamp, Harry suddenly asked, "Will it work if another wizard also put their blood in it ?"
Harry gazed as silver eyes took the soft tone of gratefulness and a clear voice sounded, "Thank you"
When Harry heard Draco's sultry whisper, it was as if a spell on his hands, commanding them to move lower, pull closer, explore wider and touch more. Over that, the light blush in his eyes did nothing to convince his body to stop.
Her hand slowly stroked the black and silky strands of hair. The smooth touch was very pleasant as the curls intertwined around her fingers.
Jarvis was in an eternal paradox. Actually every room in the mansion was clean and tidy, ready to use. But Master Harry clearly wanted to sleep with Master Draco, so Jarvis never bothered to ask. He had a cliff on one side and a valley on the other. He cannot lie to Master Draco but if he told the truth that Master Harry will be furious .
-Harry and Draco encounter a mysterious old witch and decide to follow her.
" Where did the egg go ?"
Now calm, Harry's voice returned to the strong, emotionless tone it usually had, "What happened exactly?"
Pansy ,who was with Draco packing the things up, spotted marks of red and purple on his neck. Her hand worriedly came to touch them as she asked, "What happened?"
"My moon's too precious to lose, too fragile to hurt and too beloved to live without, only cherishing and pampering can do him right."
Draco quickly stuffed his purse into his pocket and ran towards the room Theo told him he had gone too. Kreacher and Dobby on his tail as well. Halfway up the stairs, he saw Theo coming down as well.
The huge egg laying in the corner of the bed slowly moved and more and more whispered noises echoed for some time before stopping completely.
" Oh ?! Go on ! Why did you stop ?" The amused but sinister gleam in Blaise's eyes as he came nearer was immediately seen. Neville took scared steps back.
Soon the door opened and Pansy Parkinson , Blaise Zambini and Theodore Nott entered . As soon as they caught the sight of Harry , their wands were out while complete shielding Draco behind them.
Behind him, Luar silently disappeared into the brooch on Draco's necktie and Eloise slowly faded.
In his thinking, Draco did not even realize that he was already at the library. Stopping in front of the restricted section, Draco remembered what he read in the book. He followed his instinctual memory and slowly relaxed his mind as he let his magic spread in the air around him. He then closed his eyes and felt everything his magic touched as he surveyed the surrounding. It felt as if he did not have two eyes but ten, so that he could look all around him and even feel the sound of slight flutter of wing from outside the window. It was a novel experience, Draco admitted. Then, inch by inch, he retracted his magic within his body, precisely at the center of his chest. Gradually, No magic was left out and all of it was tightly looked in that small space. Draco could feel his magic forming a small, marble sized, pale turquoise ball in his chest. His magic swirling as a silent tornado in it.
The elf swiftly raised his head looking at Draco with eyes wide with terror. Draco didn't meet his eyes , " How do you think you were able to spy on my father and me that night without getting caught ? Did you ever think that with you being in Hogward's and with Harry Potter would go unnoticed by me ? Why do you think you are still alive after betraying the Malfoy family despite being a Malfoy elf ? Why do you think that I never protested even after you were accidentally set free ? "
Her numb legs collapsed as she plopped on the floor. Drawing her knees up, she gazed at the beautiful body on the bed,
Neville had never looked away from the beautiful face and still firmly stared at Blaise, "You- you really did that? Why? I had always thought….."
"Little one, you sure are restless. By doing this, I only meant to heal you a little faster. I mean no ill intention. After all, it were my inscribes which harmed you.  And no, you did not get caught.",  It said as it chuckled gently at the last bit. A somewhat foolish amusement lingering in the sound.
Finally, Hermione said, " Ron , this is you "
Far from where they were, a train was traversing through the vast land filled with marshes. Inside a compartment of the train, sat a youth. His childish face, still having baby fat , was oddly serious. The look didn't suit the boy's adorable visage.
Harry let out an exaggerated sigh.
People ran here and there, some falling down to be stepped on while others pushing and pulling to step on others as they made their way to safety. This scene struck a realisation in Ron and he understood that the world is never entirely black and white and no one is completely innocent.
In his internal crisis , Draco totally forgot Harry but was drawn back to him by the pained whimper heard from the bedside floor.
George said, "Harry is going to need a miracle to solve this"
She took out her wand and kept it at hand. But what could she do when she didn't even know what was happening to her ? So she decisively keeps going in the hope that her brothers and allies will help her.
"A memory ? Of whom ?"
was taught for the purpose of spying, assassinations and other such tasks. It was a kind of wandless magic. In the turning wheel of time, it was slowly forgotten as it can be only used by low wizards which, more or less, mean immature or apprentice wizards with weak magic and presence. If a wizard with strong magic performed this method, it will result in death from magic suppression and his body will literally burst as the suppressed magic explodes. It was similar to a container that cannot hold water more than its volume and if forced, it will burst apart, spilling the water out.  Luckily, he is still a student and his magic is very subtle and gentle making it easy to perform this.
" Understood ?" Emphasized Harry as he frowned .
" You are supposed to flush yourself in , mate . What did you think you had to do ?"
" Harry! Liquid Luck !", Hermoine exclaimed suddenly . A bright smile adoring her face .
But at the same time, the feeling of familiarity the baby gave him was undeniable.
His eyes scanned again and soon caught the sight of two ghouls working soullessly under the relentless words of a house elf. On more clear observation, he saw that these ghouls were-
Handing him the trunk, Harry faintly asked, " Where is Malfoy ?"
Days passed and Harry grew more and more indulged , slowly forgetting his real world . His parents broke the news that his mom was pregnant with a baby girl and the whole family was in a mood for celebration and happiness . He always wanted a younger sibling . Right now , they were sitting on the couch discussing who will name the baby . They excitedly suggested names and bickered about whose choice was better . The door still silently stood there , waiting . Still only visible to Harry .
