Not that Draco had much to worry about. Harry hated that he couldn’t tell him anything, but the form he had signed for each trial had been spelled so he couldn’t talk about it until after the trial.
that floated just above the floor, glowing warmly. The ceiling was a stunningly clear view of the whole night sky. Harry had modified the spell to show the sky above the clouds, that would wear off by the morning.
“Damn, Draco.” Pansy said, surveying the room that was entirely empty of any form of personalization. Unless one were to count the unmarked, standard cardboard boxes. “You’ve really just been sitting here, haven’t you?” Draco nodded, slightly embarrassed. He could have been being productive, exploring campus, unpacking his things. But instead he had sat around admiring the view and waiting for someone he had never met- or spoken to- to arrive. Pansy pulled open one of the boxes and began sifting through it. “No, I wouldn’t join a sorority. I like the idea of them, but they get such a bad reputation that I feel like being in one would negatively affect my public image. And with everything with my parents… I could do without anymore negative branding.”
“I’ve been thinking that I’m going to keep the teaching position after the two year mark. I know Hermione wants to get out as soon as she can, and very well could be gone for next year, but I really like what I’m doing. The more I’ve thought about it the more I think being an auror isn’t right. Teaching about those damn case reports when most of us have more field experience before graduating than those aurors ever dreamed of has reminded me that I don’t actually need to spend my life fighting evil. I mean, yeah it’s the Defense job, so there will be a bit of that, but it’s more about students, taking the preventative steps and such.” Harry looked up to find Draco staring intently at him while Teddy played with the button on his cloak, “What?”
The auror said, “I have orders to take Mr. Malfoy directly back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”
“Okay, so I know we’re all feeling pretty shitty after yesterday and likely all should be seeing mind healers, so I thought it’d be nice to do a more uplifting lesson. But fair warning we are starting the real review for NEWTs tomorrow.”
“It’s not like that, we both decided we wanted other things. She wanted to try girls for a while, I decided I would stick with guys for the rest of time.”
“Welcome to Hogwarts. I am Professor Potter, and I will teach Defense Against the Dark Arts this year. You will be sorted into one of four houses before the opening feast. Your house will be like your family while you are here. The houses are as follows, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Slytherin.”
Harry felt his heartbeat pick up a bit, he had forgotten to tell Draco when to show up. Idiot. “Oh, uh, eight? I’m not quite sure when Hermione is going out, but she’ll probably be gone by then.”
“I love y-” Draco started but his phone beeped, signaling that the call had ended. Draco pulled it away from his ear and muttered, “Traitor.”
“Yes, well father and I had a lot of catching up to do.” Draco said, sitting down at one of the set plates. “You’ve set the table for three.”
Soon enough into the game Harry heard the familiar tune of ‘Weasley is our King’ coming from where he knew the remaining eight eighth years sat. They must have sonorused their voices, or maybe were joined by one of the other houses rooting for the eighth years because they were loud enough to be heard over the crowd of students.
The train arrived in time for dinner, as usual. Harry went and found Ron amongst the crowd of students, they hadn’t had a good chance to talk since Ron and Hermione had broken up. All Harry knew was that he would stop talking to them if they made him pick sides, well as much as he could stop talking to his quidditch teammates, coworker, and student.
McGonagall swiftly moved around the room, placing the hat onto each student’s head, until it seemed satisfied. Then she moved to strand in front of us, once more.
Everything was all set up and ready to go when Pansy said, “Listen guys, I know we have the very strict rule of no allowing new people into this, but that’s such a high school rule. And we’re in college now… so I think we should branch out a bit and let new people join the tradition.”
“At least your parents want you back.” Ron said from his desk, startling Draco. “My father has already turned my room into another storage space for all of his dreadful inventions. He dismantled my bed for some scrap parts and he sold the rest of my things on eBay so he could buy this thing he’s been wanting for a while to help with his ‘creative process.’ He sent me pictures and everything. Even gave me the eBay link and said I could bid on anything I wanted. As if he doesn’t know I’m a broke college student.”
All of the Death Eaters that had been rounded up last June were placed under a tracking spell, or house arrest until their trial. House arrest wasn’t exactly feasible with the Malfoys since their home was being picked apart by the aurors. The tracker wasn’t to be removed, if it was and the person was found they would be placed in Ministry custody. There were certain boundaries that if breached would warrant a house arrest apparently, but Harry had no idea what they were.
“Find that damn snitch.” Harry nodded, “It’s time to end this.” And with that, Harry flew back into the air, swiveling on the spot in search of the snitch. Draco turned to face the rest of his team and said, “Pansy, Hermione, keep up what you’re doing, you too Ron, Blaise, Hannah, we’ve got to get a margin over 150 in case Ginny gets the snitch.” The pair of them nodded and Madam Hooch sent us off again.
His mind trailed to Longbottom and Granger- no, if he was going to date Harry, then he ought to get used to calling them Neville and Hermione. And Ron and Ginny. He thought that Neville and Hermione would make a good couple, if they did end up going that route with one another.
“Thanks!” He called back and then she was gone, the door clicking softly shut behind her. Draco turned his attention to Blaise and asked, “And how has your mom been about all this?”
“Yes! Of course I had reason for calling. My reason was to tell you to get your ass home before we disown you! There was no reason for you to choose a college so far away and especially one of such low social standing. Do you have no regard for your family and your reputation? You are tainting our family line with this- this- childishness. It’s disgraceful and embarrassing! Not to mention how badly your mother misses you.” Draco’s father shouted into the phone with rising hysteria.
“I’m not going to Azkaban,” Draco muttered, refusing to meet anyone’s eyes. The common room erupted into whoops and hollers. People were patting him on the back and congratulating him and he didn’t know who the limbs belonged to, but everyone was touching him. It reminded him of the reaction Harry- Potter, had gotten when he’d killed He Who Must Not Be Named.
Their hayride tickets weren’t for another half an hour so they went around looking at the craft booths and games lining the side streets. There was a local band playing music over at a gazebo in the nearby park.
“Yep.” He said, watching as Harry tipped the coffee pot over the small cup, letting the steamy coffee spill gently into it. Draco left himself moving another half step closer and forced himself to stop. It was a bad habit of his, always trying to draw nearer to Harry. It was like they were oppositely chargers ends of two magnets, whenever they were close, they couldn’t help but make contact with one another. The pot ran down to the dregs before his cup was filled and Draco stopped pouring. He turned away from Draco in order to start brewing more. Without Harry’s eyes on him, Draco had a little rush of courage and blurted out the words he had come here to say, “Also you never told me what time for tonight.”
As Draco returned to the center of the pitch, he glanced up to see Harry grinning at him. He couldn’t help but grin right back.
While the man made the coffee and put the sandwiches together, he made conversation with Harry and Hermione. “So are you two here for the new semester?”
Draco was silent for a moment “Well go on then.” Harry needed to get back to his grading, he wanted to finish this one before he went to bed, “Anytime now.”
“Hello Draco, Mr. Potter. Mr. Potter, I’d like to thank you for what you said today. I don’t like to think what would have happened today if not for you.”
In his head, Draco ran through the other possibilities. He could be with either of the Ravenclaw boys, Corner and Goldstein. He couldn’t remember any interactions with either of them, but he had seen them hanging around Potter in the past, and they likely knew all about what he had done. There were the Hufflepuffs, Macmillan and Finch-Fletchley. Both of whom were also friends of Potter’s. And Finch-Fletchley was a muggleborn, so he had even more reason to hate Draco.
“It did go well, great actually.” Draco said, a little gentler and a little less jokingly. “But perhaps next time we won’t go putting the champagne in the fridge. Especially not when the fridge in question gets so much traffic. The constant opening and closing of the fridge caused temperature fluctuations that resulted in the bubbles being disturbed.”
“Quite right. Today we’re taking a bit of a break from the darker side of this class and performing the actual charm. Now, I doubt that any of us will ever encounter a dementor ever again, but it could be on the practical exam, it’s quite an uplifting charm, and we all need some of that right now. If you do encounter a dementor in the future, you’ll need this charm. I know many of you already can do it, or just need a bit more practice so hopefully this will be a pretty easy lesson. If you don’t get it today, first don’t feel bad it’s a pretty hard charm, and if you want more tips come see me or Hermione outside of class. And with that everyone over to the mats, let’s get started.”
Just before they took off into the air, Draco thought he saw one of the beaters offer Harry a nervous wave. He turned his head back to see if Harry would return it, but then the whistle blew and they were off.
The eighth years trudged to the common room, specially made for them. Draco was surprised to find it, pretty. A bright purple was balanced out with gray to fill the room. Plush armchairs and sofas were strew about and a fire danced in the hearth. Portraits and tapestries, befitting all four houses, adorned the walls. The only thing that threw Draco, was the fact that, the room was circular. Sure, he knew it made sense, they were inside of a circular tower, but even so, it made him uneasy. There were no corners to lurk in, hide in the shadows of. He would not be able to survive this year, if he couldn’t go unnoticed.
“It’s okay Draco. Eat with your friends.” His mom responded. She paused for a moment before she said, “Look, I know what your father has been saying, don’t listen to him, don’t come back here, okay? Stay in college, live your life.”
“Please.” Harry said, “You should see my uncles. They’re a real old married couple and their cutesy-ness is sickening to be around most of the time.”
Harry smiled and passed the snitch off to Malfoy, quidditch practice would be interesting this year.
He opened it up, concern pooling in the pit of his stomach. His father never left voicemail messages… never.
Harry followed Draco’s gaze and confused etched itself into his features, “What? Hermione and Neville? They’re just friends.”
McGonagall went after Narcissa. She strode over to the chair Narcissa had just vacated and sat down. “You have been Mr. Malfoy’s teacher for the past eight years?” The Ministry witch prompted.
Anxiety filled Draco when the bus arrived on campus to take them south into the large city half an hour away. Harry took the week off from classes to go down with Draco and the team. As they walked towards the bus, hand in hand, it felt like the whole school was there to wave them off. Harry squeezed Draco’s hand as they settled into the seats beside one another. “You okay?”
In fact he was so absorbed in the taste of it and the little pink flowers lining the massive fountain that he almost missed the booth an old woman was running. Her voice was what caught his notice, serene and gentle. He turned towards the sound and found her sitting under a brightly colored tent, a small wooden table before her topped with a large clay lump she was shaping. A white poster was pinned to the beam of her tent. In red letters it read ‘Free pottery class, first come first serve.’
“The question is, will they teach us?” Pansy asked, gesturing around to the three of them. “They certainly don’t like us. I reckon they might try and have us killed during the class.”
The last two weeks of January were a bit of a blur. Harry and Draco hadn’t really been on any dates since the first one, but they were almost always together between having many classes together and sharing a room. It was nice, Harry thought, no one had seemed to pick up on anything, meaning they had some peace for once. It was nice, being happy like this, he had a job he enjoyed, Ron and Hermione were speaking again (though it was still mostly in monosyllables), no one was trying to kill him, the press was leaving him alone for the moment, and he had a boyfriend. He had even gotten all of the glitter from Luna out of his hair, life was most certainly good.
Satisfied, Draco sealed the letter and passed it off to the auror. She examined it and muttered a few spells before deeming it safe to be sent away.
He didn’t want to do a movie, they’d already done that with the horror movie. They couldn’t go and get coffee since that was too cliche and doubtable that Harry would enjoy that with half of his waking hours spent in Rise and Grind. It was too cold to go swimming or on a picnic, but too hot for any of the fun wintery date activities.
His dad nodded slowly, digesting this. The silence stretched for several minutes before he said, “Good, that’s all that matters to me now.”
When Harry and Draco got back to the dorms to say their goodnights they found Pansy and Hermione watching the news on the couch on the first floor.
Harry smiled and ran a hand through Draco’s hair. “Should we talk about what we said. Before your mother interrupted us?”
He was shaken awake the next morning. It was Malfoy. Malfoy’s mouth was moving, but no sound was coming out of it, Harry remembered the sound barrier and took it down. Harry looked out the window and noticed it was still dark out.
Draco, Pansy and Blaise paid no attention to the sorting. Instead they took to whispering with one another throughout the whole thing.
An hour and a half later, the six of them were laughing, hands covered in pumpkin seeds and guts as they proclaimed Neville the victor of the ninth annual pumpkin carving competition.
“Nope. I am invoking my Professor powers, and being a listening ear for your problems until lunch is over. I need to forget some of my own for now anyway.”
“Thanks.” She looked around and found a dish of thumbtacks on her bedside table and proceeded to hang it above her bed.
She had gone there tonight to visit his father, and Draco had been meant to go along too but he hadn’t been able to manage. He couldn’t face his father, not yet. If he was being honest with himself, he blamed his father for much of what had happened in these past years. His father had been the one so eager to join up after all. And his father had been the one to fail in the hall of mysteries, pushing the Dark Lord’s wrath onto Draco.
“Well, then, the aurors are likely getting antsy waiting for me, so I should get home. I will see you over the Easter holidays, Draco. Do take care of him, Mr. Potter.”
They made it down to the ground floor and Pansy pulled him into a large room where a bunch of people were already gathered, red solo cups in hand and flushed smiles lighting up their faces. Some of them had certainly already had a lot to drink. “So, who organized this?” Draco asked, surveying the growing crowd. In the few seconds he stood in the doorway, more people had pushed past him to get inside.
“I saw Granger, Longbottom, Weasley and Potter. Finch-Fletchley too.” Pansy replied, contemplating, then she added, “Oh and Abbott.”
“We’ll never be back here,” He found himself whispering, as he looked out upon the grounds. “I didn’t realize how much I’d miss this place.”
Sharing a room with Malfoy wasn’t really all that interesting, Malfoy tended to ignore him, so Harry responded the same way. He did notice though that Malfoy had taken to studying under the staircase, apparently so had Hermione. Harry himself would never be caught dead anywhere near that area, it reminded him of the Dursley’s too much. He enjoyed doing his work over on the couch or in the library, grading was exclusive to his desk.
“I’ve picked up a few things in solitude, experimented. By the time you come back, who knows, maybe I’ll be able to bake too.” She joked. And there she was, Draco’s old mother. The one he had known when he was little. The one who joked, and laughed and read him stories before tucking him into bed. The one who didn’t have a thousand regrets lying behind her eyes.
“Perfect, no need to dress super formally, and don’t worry I’m usually the only one that works the early riser shift.”
Potter laughed, “No, I’ve got enough to do already, I’ll tryout, of course, but I am far to busy to be in charge of something else.”
Harry woke up the next morning and went for a run, deciding to do his weight set the next day, his coach had him on a schedule that involved weight training a few times a week. After that he hit the showers and went back to his dorm.
Nymphadora’s friend, who turned out to be named Jess, offered him a reassuring smile when she’d met up to collect him, but it did little to calm his nerves.
OoOoOo Draco made some breakthroughs this week with his feelings towards Harry!!!!! What do you think Harry’s response will be?
“No, I can manage it.” Draco said, “And in any case, I don’t want my things just shoved into my trunk with no care for them, I’d like everything to be orderly.”
“As his one of his teachers and peers how would you feel about him returning to Hogwarts?” The witch seemed irritated by his supportive testimony.
“Can anyone tell us what charm we were studying way back in March before Easter hols?” Asked Hermione, “Hannah?”
“And finally, those who say Draco Malfoy is guilty of being a Death Eater.” Quite a lot of people stood up. Harry realized that there was no way Malfoy could get away without this charge. “And those who believe he is innocent.” A handful of people stood up. “Let the record show that Draco Malfoy is guilty of being a Death Eater.”
Suddenly, just as Draco was about to take a shot, a Bludger came out of nowhere and crashed into his shoulder. He groaned, but somehow managed to keep hold of the Quaffle. He launched it towards the right hoop, but Gryffindor’s new keeper caught it and passed it off to one of their chasers.
Malfoy is found guilty of. For the crime of the use of the Unforgivable curses, those who say guilty please stand.”
Once the place quieted down enough Harry would put on some music and Draco would usually complain about his bad taste. After a while Harry would concede and let Draco choose the music.
He retreated to his room, he just needed to be alone. It’s not that the eighth years were insensitive, quite the opposite compared to the other years, at least they had actually fought and had been around for every other crazy Voldemort thing that had happened. They just didn’t seem to see that it affected him so much, talking about his death like it didn’t matter. Harry supposed that from an outsiders perspective it didn’t. He was dead for a few minutes, the curse didn’t stick, within the next hour he had jumped from Hagrid’s arms and killed Voldemort.
Eventually Harry started reading over Draco’s shoulders to find it was a book of Muggle fairy tales. They fell asleep like that sometime around sunset, cuddled close and letting some of the day’s emotions wash away.
“They’re just so perfect.” Draco said, getting more and more worked up with each word. Then he muttered something that Potter almost missed, but not quite. “Makes it so hard to not kiss you.”
“Nothing, I think you’re just not feeling enough. You have a tendency to over analyze, when it’s your turn just feel, point your wand, and say the words. The rest will work itself out.” Harry smiled, and gently lowered Draco’s wrist.
Harry wandered as Hermione explored. The bookshop was a small business as well, most of the places near campus were. There were rows and rows of books on shelves sorted by genre and there was a whole section in the fantasy and sci fi area devoted to movie adaptations of the various books. Harry took out his phone and added a few books he saw to his ‘to read’ list in his notes app. He wouldn’t buy them today, they would probably sit in the dorm until the end of the semester anyway. He’d buy them then.
One day Harry noticed Draco staring, rather overtly, at him during the eighth year DADA class. Hermione seemed to notice too because she promptly called on Draco. It was funny, really, had Harry been the one talking Draco probably would know what was going on, but since it was Hermione he was utterly sidetracked.
“You need to sleep. I have it on good authority that this paper you’re ‘almost done’ with is due in two days. You can finish it after you have some sleep.”
“And I you,” Harry answered. Part of him wished to take Draco’s hands in his own, but he didn’t. Instead, he kept his hands clasped behind his back. His muscles were straining when Draco’s hands explored lower and lower, and Harry almost felt ashamed when his prick reacted to the touch. And to the sight of Draco. His shirt started to soak where the water ran up his arm. His bare feet. And his skinny jeans, dark, saturated with water.
My beliefs were vindicated when James actually went down on his knees to rub his face over the bulge in my pants and tugged the fabric off to watch my prick spring free on eye-level.
Draco was about to reply and come up with some excuse when he noticed Ginny’s blue eyes slide away from his face. The witch waved, her face lighting up in recognition.
What they really do when Harry comes back from a plundered hotel suite, where the cocaine tray was gently set aside by the cleaner and where his phone had a billion missed calls, is laugh about some Muggle photos that Harry has found in one of the cupboards, and which he’s so eager to show to Draco that he sprints down the stairs and knocks into the other man on the threshold to the atelier. Most of them show Tarquin, Nick, and Judith. On one of them is Aanya, and Harry tells Draco how he’s been a vegetarian for a year or so because of a revelational talk he’s had with her on ecstasy. But when he thinks back at that time, his diet mostly involved whiskey and fast food anyway.
“Yes, true. But we mend the whole thing while we’re at it, okay? Always mend the whole thing. That means something to people.”
Harry catches the ice-cold bottle out of the air and opens it with a small push of wandless magic, smiling when he watches fine, silvery condensate escape the bottle. But then it effervesces with foam, and Harry quickly seals the bottle with his mouth, amusedly listening to Draco’s sneer while trying to suck the overflowing foam from the bottle. “Thanks,” Harry says, savouring the hoppy taste on his lips. They start devouring their food, and Harry makes fun of Draco for eating his finger food with a fork. They agree that it was a good decision to get something to eat, hungry or not, because the chips are deliciously salty and exactly what they needed without knowing it.
Harry flew a good hundred metres to have some room to pick up speed, and I felt myself grin rather idiotically while watching him soar through the air and then taking a sharp turn right above the garden. Teddy and I applauded him when he came back and swung from his broom, and I really should not think about how good he looks while flying or jumping from the broom or swiping sweat from his forehead and curly hair.
It’s a tabloid invention. Truthfully, I’m just an average bloke. An average bloke with a humdrum job. Once upon a time I did something special but that was back when I was a teenager. Nowadays I’m twenty-five. I smoke too much, and I don’t get up on my broom half as often as I should. My personal life involves pints in the Leaky listening to Ron moaning about the Ministry. I’m not the Boy Who Lived. I’m the man whose life passed me by, and if it wasn’t for the scar and the glasses then I doubt I’d ever get a second glance.
“No more than ten minutes,” Draco answered. “My back was killing me, and I was having all sorts of odd dreams, so I got up and went for a pee. The moment I stood up I had a contraction… I dived in here to catch my breath, and work out if it was real - and
It was the first time anyone had said it. Fitzgerald hadn’t listened. He’d heard Draco’s words, but he’d taken exactly what he wanted. Pansy hadn’t listened either. Nobody had wanted to hear Draco’s wretched little tale. His friends weren’t bothered, not now he wasn’t ever amusing or popular.
“Perhaps we should go out,” Harry suggests because he misses Draco’s smile. “The night is clear—cold though it is. But I happen to know a certain someone who’s very adept with Warming Charms.”
Draco is likely sitting beside you on the settee, a cup of tea in his hand, or perhaps he is in the kitchen, putting the finishing touches on some very extravagant birthday cake. No doubt Teddy is there, drawing one of his masterpieces, and likely Andromeda and Narcissa too. They’ll be Flooing in, arms laden with birthday presents because today – the twenty-fourth of June – is your daughter’s birthday.
The warmer months are the worst. Around the time that the sun grows warmer, and the chipper of birds wake him before sunup, a darkness seizes Harry from deep within, one that worsens with every memorial, every birthday, every deathday along the line.
Draco retrieves the phial from his robes, showing it to Harry again. Harry doesn’t say anything. The trapped magic floats through it’s narrow confines, looking sombre on first sight but glittering with all the colours if Draco concentrates long enough on it, saves it from intrusive light that marrs the intrinsic shine. “It’s yours,” Draco points out stubbornly. “A dissociated singularity of your magic. How did that happen?”
I was taking my afternoon break from Phoenix – it’s our quiet season right now, no one wants racing brooms while the kids are all at school – and I went to visit George in the Wheezes to pass ten minutes. George’s face blossomed into a smirk a mile wide the moment he saw me.
his jacket. Entirely confounded by Draco’s sudden awkwardness, Pansy stood as well and kissed Draco farewell. “Bring Harry over for Sunday lunch,” she said, as she led him towards the fireplace. “Best make it one 'o'clock. I have a fearsome need to see my best-friend’s new beau, and I shan’t take no for an answer.”
. To the men’s. To the food buffet and a conversation about buying celebs’ addresses off of managers. To throwing his plate at the bitch, perhaps, accidentally, followed by a wandless hex. A shock of white hair. To appalled gasps and the sounds of chairs scraping over polished hardwood floorboards. Back to the men’s, hands on porcelain, panting. To grey eyes in the mirror.
The world spun for a second. Draco felt his stomach lurch. He watched, heart in his mouth, as Cormac waved the article in Ginny’s direction, chuckling as he did so.
Gentlemanly as I always try to be, I let my hands rest on Draco’s hips. “Only if you’re comfortable,” I said, leaning in to brush a chaste kiss on Draco’s shoulder. “You don’t have to reciprocate. Pleasure for you is good enough for me.”
I’ve been doing some calculating and the plum should arrive by the end of June, sometime between the 24th and the 30th if I’m not mistaken. There’s a new moon on the 24th, that would be a promising birth date I suppose. They will be born under the Cancer star sign, like Astoria. Let’s see whether they will be such an adorable sap as well. I wouldn’t mind that at all.
But one thing that cheers me up is stupid Potter. He’s always cheery when his broom shop starts decorating the shop windows. I’ll never forget the one time he told me how different his Christmases as an adult are, compared to the ones he used to have with his foster family as a child. I wish I could’ve had the courage to inquire after his childhood, but back then, I was still to dumb-struck that Harry was being friendly with me.
“Please,” Harry asked. “I’ll not ask again, not if you don't want me to, but just this once, please could I touch you?”
With a swish of black, formal robes, Draco was gone. Harry looked at the empty space where his boyfriend had been and made a decision. Draco’s fierce enthusiasm was contagious. He knew there was only one celebrity that the Chimaera’s Den wouldn’t be able to resist.
Right at that moment, I wondered what his life might possibly be like. Whether he was lonely and doesn’t have a single soul holding his hand from time to time. Rather disconcerting thoughts, when I consider how my usual hook-ups go. Usually it's a little chat about what they like, what I won’t do, and two orgasms later they are gone. Salazar, I’ve even mentally made a shopping list several times while letting a bloke have at me.
Harry didn’t reply. Instead, he raised the Mojito to his lips and took a sip. He winced, and put it back down onto the wood with the tiniest click.
“I tend to . . . shove all these thoughts in the back of my mind. And there they stay for a while until, one day, always when I expect it the least, they come back with ten times the force. I’ll need to let go of Tarquin. It’s been two years and I still don’t quite . . . I need to stop talking about him as though we were still hanging out all the time. I don’t want to think about what happened, I just can’t. I think what I need to do is to move on.”
“What the fuck,” Harry stammers, annoyed that his brain is working so agonisingly slowly, like his thoughts were buried deep inside his mind, sticky and threading whenever scrutinised.
“You kept saying ex! It’s not my fault that you didn’t explain this little detail about your ex’s prick.”
Harry shouts over the noise how good the DJ is and how perfect it feels that it’s so crowded tonight, not hearing his own voice and fully convinced that Tarquin won’t hear his words but will understand him anyways.
Before they leave, Harry makes sure the little bag with the three remaining pills is in his jeans pocket. He tells himself that he’ll only tell Tarquin about it if the night turns out to be really, really good and needs some enhancement to properly enjoy it. Or if the show is complete shit and they end up wandering the empty streets which would be so much more fun with the increased urge to talk, laugh, run. Harry doesn’t argue with the voice inside his head that tells him that they will take the pills tonight, no matter what.
Draco was leaning on the doorframe, and I found that I could scarcely pull my gaze away. He was more handsome than I’d ever seen him. His hair was thicker, more lustrous and longer than ever. Draco had pulled it back into a loose bun, but a couple of soft strands had escaped. I had to clasp the wood of my workbench to stop myself from tucking them behind Draco’s ears. Despite the chilly London day, Draco’s skin looked soft. I swallowed and averted my eyes, worried that I’d be caught staring. The last thing in the world that I wanted was for Draco to leave again.
“Promise that you won’t leave,” Harry whispers. Then, almost inaudible, “All good things always leave.”
"I didn't know. I thought it happened along the way for you, after you moved in with me,” he said. “After that kiss, remember? That kiss in the Bonfire Night at the Burrow? I thought you'd regretted that. That it might have happened by accident because you felt lonely or just a tad too tipsy. Thought you'd find me so repulsive that you Disapparated."
Harry stands up and goes over to Draco, swallowing down the guilt that bolts through his body. He hugs Draco, standing next to his chair and stroking his hand through his silky, blonde hair.
I made sure that he wouldn’t accidentally tip over the edge before we could get to the part where I would finally have the Golden Boy’s prick buried inside of me. Salazar, I sound like a fanboy even in my own ears. But that’s not it. I’ve been
And while Harry was perfect at providing a sense of rationality and safety, and he was great at being considerate with Draco, at all times, Draco was just as great at finding excuses to indulge them a little. When Daisy was playing, he’d settle in behind Harry and massage his shoulders. When Daisy was taking her afternoon nap, Draco would lead Harry into the bedroom where he’d straddle Harry’s lap and kiss him for at least ten minutes straight. And sometimes in the morning, Draco would ask, “May I?” and he would shove his hand down Harry’s boxer shorts to rub his morning wood into a blissful orgasm.
His heart dropping past his stomach, Draco waved goodbye to Pansy. He’d really blown the Bludger on this one, and no mistake. As he disappeared through the door and Apparated to Diagon Alley, Draco cursed the loyalty of snakes. What was it that the sodding Sorting Hat had sung, once upon a time?
It’s my one consolation that Potter will do everything for his child. Not for me, but for the life our combined magic created. If he planned that from the start or whether it was one of his lucky stars that arranged that the sex he craved led to the one big thing he wanted from life – I’ll possibly never know.
“Come on, are you taking the piss? You must know him!” Also, Carol knows all the wannabe celebs that make up their usual company and who Harry often has no first clue about.
While the Granger-Weasleys put Rose to bed at some point and Harry and I were left to ourselves in the drawing room with coke light, tortilla chips and a fruit salad that looked like a very meagre attempt of adding something healthy to the little buffet, I vaguely announced that I wanted to talk with him about something. Alone. Harry just nodded for them.
Harry puts purpose into the kiss that seals their promise, Draco can feel that. Like most things about Harry, it tastes like a strange mixture of dread and dedication.
Harry tries talking to the officers. Then he tries to contact Tarquin’s parents, already regretting the choice to involve them as he  types the number into his phone. But it turns out to be a brilliant idea because, much in contrast to Harry, they know how to find not just help, but, according to Tarquin’s dad—a self-righteous man with a flawless three-piece suit and nothing but a disgusted glare for Harry—
Diary, it’s no exaggeration to say that my heart skipped a beat. It was obvious that my friend has a real medical problem, but for some reason couldn’t attend St Mungo’s.
Indeed, Draco had already prepped the potion. Each time he’d had any contact with Fitzgerald, he’d grown a little bolder, a little more shameless. Draco made sure to stay beside him in The Leaky Cauldron and make sure his beer was always topped up. Draco let his fingers brush against Fitzgerald’s when the other wizard tried to pay. “My treat,” Draco had said, flirty and brazen. “Can’t bear to see a wizard go dry. Not when it’s so straightforward to sate your thirst.”
James made a weird movement with his hands, touching the ridge of his nose, then laughed and shook his head. Perhaps he usually wears spectacles? He’d certainly look smarter with thick frames on his nose, would even be more befitting because he’s not an idiot at all.
Draco huffs a breath, hoping to sound annoyed, not overwhelmed as he tries to tune out the deafening silence of a person’s mind, clenching their fists and just staring, staring, staring at their angrily crying toddler. “It’s Unspeakable business, an occurrence like that. I don’t know why
He feels Draco nod and tighten his grip around him. Harry thinks that, perhaps, Draco might be right. The night they left Britain for good, it felt like falling in love for the first time. It felt both like running into the great unknown and coming home to something that could’ve started years ago. They were naïve to think that just being together—
The curious thing is that the conversation with James, after that somewhat rocky start, was quite natural. Funny, even. I can’t even recall what exactly we talked about, but we chatted and laughed a lot.
“Everything looks absolutely superb,” Bartsch said, looking over at the three of us. “Draco, you’ll need an hour or so before you’re able to walk around, but I’m confident that your healing won’t take long at all. I believe that you’ll barely have too much of a scar.”
It is only the plum and their wellbeing that keeps Draco from leaving me, and never seeing me again.
As we chatted, I felt some of the worries that had plagued me begin to uncoil. Draco told me about visiting Narcissa in Dartmore and how well she seems to be fairing. I was pleased to hear it.
, spending the whole night running from Unforgivables. That’s not what I think about when I hear the world
“I bet Hermione would have had a thing or two to say. She might have liked that better than listening to pregnancy anecdotes. She’s a very patient and polite witch.”
“Well, so we’re going to be headbanging all night?” Harry guesses. “I can never hear a difference between black and death.” Harry honestly has no idea most of the time.  He wouldn't complain, but he’s in the mood for some brutal, fast-paced stuff.
It is absurd to think that someone else is occupying the suite now; that someone else listens to pop songs and laughs along and most certainly cuts a few lines right now. And it is odd to think that he just saw Ron and Hermione. It was nothing like a reunion one would see in the movies. It was a mixture of familiar warmth and halting conversations. Of dancing around safe subjects and repressed feelings. How peculiar that things change and at the same time they don’t.
and not one single mention in the Prophet gossip columns, Draco! I’m shocked beyond belief. I’ll admit I did make a little wager with Daph. The witch is convinced you've been holed up in St Swithins Crescent bonking some gorgeous new chap you’d got the hots for and I wholeheartedly concur.” Pansy placed her teacup back in its saucer with a neat little click before picking up a Cauldron Cake with dainty fingers. “He must be
Draco remembered how he’d believed her, and how he’d taken her words to heart. It didn’t sound like Harry was particularly pleased to see Pansy either. His voice was muttered, and furious, and Draco could only make out snippets.
From the settee to the minibar. To a conversation about tasteless advertising posters tainting the view from the panorama front in the hotel restaurant. To plans of celebrating a cigar-smoking, self-important bloke’s divorce tonight to an offer of having a line before going out—
“Well, it should be about what Teddy wants, not about what’s good for the DMLE,” Harry interjects. Hermione looks at Harry warily; he feels like he shouldn’t have said anything.
When they are in bed that night, Harry is wide-awake with his lips on Draco’s and his hand in his own pants. He’s more than a little aroused, but his penis doesn’t feel like catching up on that, which is not only frustrating but also humiliating under Draco’s darkened eyes and parted, sensual lips.
Fitzgerald pushed a finger inside, thick and prying, and he felt his whole body tense up. Draco hadn’t been given a warning, and it didn’t feel pleasant. It felt like a violation, and then Draco knew. He knew that there wasn’t some deep dark secret behind Fitzgerald’s actions. There weren’t any excuses. It was as simple as a first-year charm.
Every movement about Draco told Harry that he was an experienced lover. He knew how to angle their hips, how to shove his hands between them to rub Harry’s prick while Draco was buried inside of Harry, and how to kiss him through the overwhelming feeling of being completely full of his boyfriend. For Harry, it was a blur of pleasure and trying to get his panting under control while he couldn’t get enough of the sight of Draco above him with a lovely flush to his chest. He was perfect and so full of want and action, meant only for himself and for Harry. For both of them, equally.
“May I?” Harry asked, coming just an inch closer, his eyes on Draco’s lips. Draco nodded his consent, his eyes, too, dipping lower on Harry’s face. When their lips met, the kiss was slow and familiar, a needed reconnection, because the talk had begun to get just a little bit too abstract for the sensual matter at hand.
As soon as Christmas dinner was over, Andromeda insisted that we accompany her on a walk through the village. I didn’t want to be the one to let her down; this was the one Christmas tradition that she’d shared with Ted over twenty long years of marriage.
, and he passed the false knowledge on to Father. Grandfather’s Latin wasn’t the best, you see.” An amused smile plays around Draco’s lips. “So, yes, as you can see- Aunt Andromeda here had been cast out of the Sacred Twenty-Eight when she married her husband. But let me show you your great-great-great-“ Draco huffs a laugh; Harry smiles, “
“Magic,” Draco says. “He’s magical. Enchanting even if you prefer to stick to the metaphorical sense of the word. And you two-“ Draco looks between them, finding fear. Fear of being judged, fear of being hurt by him and the boy. He feels childishly petulant, frustrated. He turns to the uncle. “Yes, he’s bent. And
could still swing it with a bit of luck,” Draco muttered pointedly, pouring himself another shot, “but,
My afternoon’s work was conducted without engaging my brain. That was elsewhere, busily making plans. If I were to buy sex, it’d have to be outside the confines of the magical world. The risk of being seen – or being caught – on Diagon were too high. The person that I’d engage to fuck would have to be Muggle. I knew there were websites that helped to find men. I’ve seen them advertised in telephone boxes and in the back of newspapers when I’ve visited gay sex shops in Soho.
“I wasn’t sure that I wanted to be a dad,” Draco admitted, placing his hand on his small bump, “or that they’d fit in with my lifestyle, but seeing them, and hearing them… I know that I want this.”
He doesn’t understand why he’s feeling so low. In contrast to Draco who despises the summer for its heat that he doesn’t deal well with, and loves it for the long hours of daylight, Harry enjoys the warmth on his skin, hopeful that it will permeate through to bones that feel so dead-cold at times, heavier than Harry thinks people ought to feel in their late twenties.
In between the songs, heavy rain is pattering down against the darkened windows of Draco’s living room, and every time the soft sound fills the room, Draco keeps coming back to the subject of how this year’s autumn rains are long due, seeing that the Equinox was two weeks past, and how the fungi in his garden needed a change in humidity and the trees a change of colour. He speaks about it as though he’s sharing his complete train of thought with Harry, and Harry listens, fascinated just by how much stuff Draco has to do in contrast to himself, a homeowner with a little magical herb garden as well as a business owner.
Molly will make her famous cinder toffee, and Ron will have his hip-flash in his pocket, filled to the brim with Firewhiskey. Oliver will be there, Gins on his arm, and Hermione will fuss about going home, and having an early night. We’ll convince her otherwise. We always do. By the time that Arthur arrives with plates of sausages and baked potatoes, we’re always a little half-cut, telling silly jokes and singing Hoggy Warty Hogwarts in loud, ridiculous voices.
He felt like a spectre, roaming the treeless grounds, the deserted streets of Hogsmeade. It was only the train station—
“Make me cum,” I said, and Harry laughed at the sudden prompt. But I only smiled at him and repeated my words at his amused grin. “Use your hands or mouth – whatever you like. But do it.”
We walked into the waiting room, hand in hand, and I checked the pair of us in while Draco found us a pair of seats that were beside each other. It was the oddest feeling, diary, to be surrounded by all those other expectant parents. I felt a few inquisitive eyes rake over the pair of us, but nobody spoke. Whispers will start though, and they’ll grow into rumours. I don’t care though. I’m not ashamed of Draco and if he lets me be part of the plum's life then I’ll be honoured.
It takes Harry a moment to register that he means it. A sudden lump lodges in his throat while he deliberately avoids looking at Malfoy.
And Kayden that coward just left me there! He would’ve left me to die if Harry hadn’t given me that coin. Okay, according to St Mungo’s I probably would not have gone beyond the veil, but what an arsehole. Would not have expected him to get so angry only because I wasn’t able to take care of his erection. Mind me, I was only about to fucking faint on him.
Wizarding England was a small, tight-knit place, but somehow the story of Draco’s visit to the DMLE, and Fitzgerald’s subsequent interview with them didn’t make it into the newspapers. Draco supposed that was because there was nothing to tell. There hadn’t been an arrest, and the only time he saw Fitzgerald’s name, it was in the Quidditch columns.
“You’ve said it on occasion,” Draco responded, amusement in his voice. I picked up the shampoo bottle and squirted a Gallon sized dollop into my palm. I worked it through Draco’s hair, massaging his scalp and working the soap into a fine lather.
Drab, dull Potter who’d never pressured him, or had expectations that Draco couldn’t fulfil. In Harry’s embrace, Draco felt precious, and he felt valued. Harry tethered him to the earth.
Cold water, breathing. He can’t go out there like this; no one can know. The cold water is pleasant on his eyes. Another breath. A waft of magic.
When two such individuals have sex, their magical signatures combine and – as was the case with Draco and I – a little bit of combined magic can break off. That’s the magic that enabled our little plum to exist.
Firstly, I had a one-off hook-up only yesterday. Charged the bloke 150 pounds, more than my usual 100, because I had a feeling that he wouldn't become a regular. He was way too twitchy and kept looking over my shoulder, as if he  were expecting to be caught by whoever might see us.
All Harry can think about is to get into a horizontal position as he stands up, feeling shaky on his knees. Still, he’s well enough to find his way to the couch on his own, and he tells Draco so.
Malfoy has the audacity to frown at him until he seems to remember that fateful night at the Manor over a decade before. “My silence was hardly any . . . heroic.”
A few months ago, he might have laughed at that little exchange. A few months ago, he might have agreed with Cormac.
Malfoy’s nose crumples while he laughs, not every time, only when it's bright and genuine, and Harry can’t stop looking for it to happen.
But Hermione’s eyes gleam at Teddy. “I think that’s an excellent choice. A wizard with your abilities would have a shining career at the DMLE.”
And now that the idea settles in that the plum will be safe because we do have the other father’s magic – what are my biggest regrets and worries now? I feel indignant that Potter’s lie takes him away from me. That his lie takes away waking up next to someone I love and respect, have someone to hug close in my sleep, bloody amazing sex, … I’m so pathetic. I can’t believe that I’m lovesick for that git, or the person that I thought I might know. Everything we had is gone and for once, it’s not even my fault.
The tale of how I came to be the sort of wizard who buys sex begins yesterday, on a very inauspicious October afternoon.
As soon Draco saw me, his eyes widened. “Harry!” he said, his voice only slightly blurred, “I missed you! Weasel here is quite the
Who would have thought that I’d call the Black town residence my home one day? Certainly, I wouldn’t even have thought that when I moved in at the beginning of the month. But Harry is absolutely right: I can’t afford the money and don't need the stress of finding a flat of my own right now. And it’s better for me to have someone around to help me out in case something’s amiss.
Neville only laughed at me. “Is that the case?” he asked, smirking, “because it sounds to me like you’ve fallen for the
Tarquin loves hearing arguments he hadn’t thought of before, Harry thinks. And Aanya—Jesus, Harry hopes the discussion isn't only interesting because he's on his second pill—but she has quite a lot of these interesting viewpoints on speciesism and the arrogant self-importance of the human race. He’ll find Tarquin and buy them another round. He should also get some water—he always forgets about water—and then they’d be all set for the entirety of this wonderfully mild night.
, of all people, get that. I suppose it was hard after the war, being Harry Potter. And before the war as well, for that matter. I mean- I don’t want to be presumptuous. I probably don’t know half of it,” he catches Harry’s gaze, tone contemplative and his hands gesturing along like he’s holding a lecture. It reminds Harry of one of the lectures he attended with Tarquin and John at their Muggle uni. Part of it also reminds him of one of the huge seminars for the DMLE at the Academy, back in Auror training. “But it hasn’t been . . . It’s not easy
They both laugh while rearranging their positions on the settee, and possibly Draco feels just as clumsy as Harry. When they face each other, arms meeting on the backrest, their hands squeezing each other’s forearms, Harry leans forward to put his lips on Draco’s, chaste, testing.
. Draco will have to tell people soon – he’s wearing his loosest robes to hide his bump – but that won’t work forever. I appreciate Draco’s perspective. He wants to tell his mother before anyone else, and he can’t bear the idea of writing it in an owl letter. Secretly though, I think he is just dreading the obvious question of who the other father is.
Harry blinks. “Yes,” he says, thinking that it should be obvious. But then again, with Draco, he has never bragged about his sexual promiscuity; about waking up to a stranger every other day of the week or about the one time he blew cocaine up his lover’s arse.
Harry shook his head vehemently. “You were a child during the war,” he said, and he wanted to add something, but I interrupted him.
They shifted closer and their lips found each other. Harry took off his spectacles and angled both their faces, his hands questioningly raised to Draco’s shoulders until he held him and kissed him, just the way he loved to do. Draco’s hands were below Harry’s shirt, ghosting up his sides and feeling up his back.
“I like the long hair on you,” Draco whispers. He cards a hand through it, denied halfway by the strands trapped in Harry’s bun. When he pulls off the hairband, the knot untangling into a mess of shoulder-length black strands, Draco starts massaging his head with both hands and,
“It’s okay,” Harry says, taking both of Draco’s hands in his own hands and turning him to face each other. The house-elves sheepishly avert their gazes when they kiss. “Nothing can happen to you,” Harry promises him. “And I’m here with you.”
The footsteps pound a heavy rhythm onto the floorboards,dictating Harry’s heartbeat in a fast pace, the door opening, and then closing. Then Malfoy is beside him, clearing the table of their cold tea with a waft of what must be house magic, and putting a copper basin on the table instead, slow, almost reverent, with a slight but unmistakable tremor. It’s big enough that he needs to use both hands. The metal looks time-honoured but polished. A stick is rising from the middle of the bowl, and another horizontal one comes off the peak.
, by a floor-to-ceiling window that looks out into the garden. Another wall full of built-in cabinets. A door to what Draco calls an
“I won’t be the Diagon freak,” Draco hissed, after I’d asked him whether he’d considered my offer to accompany him to hospital. “It’s oh-so easy for you, Harry! You’re not the one whose body gets rounder and wider with every day that passes! You do realise that the very moment this pregnancy becomes common knowledge, my whole life will be up for public debate. My mother doesn’t know I’m gay – well, I’m very sure that she does, but it wasn’t ever a subject for the Manor dinner table! – and now everybody in England will know it!” I tried to put my arms around Draco, but he shoved them off me, his eyes flashing angrily. “And you know what the very best part is? Once news about the plum gets out into the public, James will realise that the baby is his, whomever he might be. No doubt he’ll be jolly pleased that he disguised himself to fuck me. Who in their right mind would want to be joined at the hip to a skint, homeless ex-Death Eater for the rest of their lives?”
“Yes,” Draco croaks next to him, then he clears his throat. “Yes, your grandfather Fleamont. And his dad, Henry, he’s the one who had the Potters being cast out of the Sacred Twenty-Eight.”
per se. Anyway. Here is also Adelia’s niece, Dorea Potter. Born into the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black.” More lines unfurl, and they connect all the way over to Sirius and to Narcissa, and also over to the Potter family. He tries to picture that this was one of his direct ancestor’s aunts—Adelia’s niece!—and his head starts spinning.
the bottle and only stopped himself at the last moment. He snatches the glass bottle from the middle of the table and pours himself some fizzy water. He drinks. Breathes. Wonders whether he’s forgotten his morphine. Then he thinks about Draco and remembers to his great embarrassment that he told Draco about the morphine and about
to be would have offered him the five grand without wanting anything in return. Such an action would have been judgmental and hypocritical though. If I was willing to buy sex, then I can’t judge Draco on his choice to sell it. Offering him the money would have invalidated his life choices.
They were. The plum – our baby – was tiny, but they were perfectly formed, their coalesced image clearly floating above Draco’s bump. I could make out a head, a torso, some little legs and even an arm. Diary, it was the most mind-blowing thing that I’ve ever seen. This was our son or daughter.
doesn’t reach a pair amidst the friends. One of them, a tall woman, has her lips at a man’s ear, whispering untenable promises while his hands squeeze her thighs with an unmistakable urgency. Her hand is more daring when she leans out of the kiss, heavy-lidded and open-mouthed as she reaches for his crotch, her posture pandering to his gaze and touch.
“Mother would love it here,” Draco said, taking a bite of his Crispy Seared Silken Tofu starter. He unfolded his cotton serviette and laid it on his lap.
I’m always astounded to watch Potter with Teddy. While Potter and Weasley are in for quite some good (dirty) jokes when we’re at the pub, with Teddy his whole “bad” habits just vanish. He doesn't even smoke where Teddy can see. Where I’m cold and have no idea how to answer, Potter squats down on his hunches and finds kid-friendly explanations for everything. I, in contrast, can’t ever seem to drop all my smug modes of expression. Good thing my cousin will get the best of both worlds, I suppose.
Sunday soon came, and Pansy was every bit as vivacious and vibrant as always. She chided Draco on his appearance the minute he stepped through the fireplace. “Circe,” she cackled, taking in the sight of Draco’s loose, black wizard robes, his unstylish hair and the bags beneath his eyes, “who are you, exactly, and what have you done with my best-friend?”
Too stunned even to breathe, Draco opened his mouth automatically. Gracious, but the kiss was everything that Draco had fantasised about and yet more besides. Harry’s lips were supple and terribly slippery and warm. Draco thought he must be feverish or perhaps in the midst of some particularly detailed daydream, but in lieu of a better plan, Draco squeezed his eyes shut and moved his lips in response. Harry was a majestic kisser, and Draco might have melted into the moment had he not been hyper-aware of Pansy’s eagle eyes boring into his back.
The heat rose in Draco's cheeks as his and Harry’s tongues touched, darting and curious, and anticipation made his skin tingle. Losing himself to the kiss entirely, Draco marvelled at his brilliant luck. What had begun as lies and make-believe had transformed into something beautiful.
What I dread is the option that James knew all along. He must be a pureblood or at least close enough to one to be able to impregnate me. If there’s anything I know about wizard pregnancies, it’s that they are only possible if both wizards are rather powerful and also share “potent bond” whatever that’s supposed to mean. It certainly sounds like it shouldn’t even have been possible for him to get me pregnant on try number 1 or 2.5. Okay, it was on try 2.5. I
“So what happened then?” Malfoy asks, engaged in Harry's anecdote with these lines on his nose and around the corners of his mouth, eyes gleaming with amusement.
A man in a turtleneck and a blue suit jacket seems to be their host. He laughs amiably and is very charming with the ladies, kissing hands and handing out drinks. A few blokes are getting ridiculously high in the corner of the room, laughing and making all kinds of weird noises, bawling songs, completely off-tune and off-tempo. Harry would have a bloody brilliant time if he was on the same stuff, he reckons.
Another hour came and went, Draco had managed to score three times, with Blaise and Hannah each scoring twice, but Gryffindor had scored too. Last Draco had heard, the announcer had said the score was 320-240, giving them an 80 point lead. Draco was still uneasy though, they could still lose. It all came down to Ginny and Harry.
Draco was surviving his house arrest, not only surviving it, but actually living it. It didn’t even really feel like a punishment at all. He was closer with his mum than ever before and Harry had visited him at least once every week for a date. Best of all, he only had one more month to go before he’d be able to leave the Manor and begin the rest of his life. Nymphadora’s friend, Jess, was often the auror tasked with watching over him and his mother. She turned out to be a good friend to him.
“That makes it even worse! You’re so perfect at everything without even trying! With your hair and your eyes and your Quidditch!”
“Yeah, she told me she started dating someone named Jules but she didn’t specify pronouns... and she’s pansexual, so I have no idea.” Daphne explained.
But if he was being honest with himself, his life had always been rather difficult, despite his luxurious family estate.
Many of the others were very close, the mist almost taking shape for many of them. Eventually the circle kind of deformed due to people turning to look at whoever had just gotten their patronus.
The same ministry witch began the questioning once more, “Mr. Dolohov, you were a death eater during the time in which Mr. Malfoy was a death eater, is that correct?”
Things started to feel like a rhythm by the fourth week of the semester. The oddest part of that rhythm being Draco Malfoy. He tended to study in the cafe. He would spend time in the study nook when it was busy and once foot traffic slowed for the night he would order a hot tea beverage and move to the sofa and spread out his work there.
“Speaking of that day, the reason I even encountered Draco, was that my friends and I were captured by the snatchers. Draco was asked to identify us, I had been hit with a stinging hex that made me less recognizable. I was terrified that we had just been made, that I would have to fight Voldemort then and there. But then, he looked me in the eyes and said ‘It’s not him.’ I knew we were saved, at least long enough to make a plan.” Now that was a little exaggerated, Draco thought. Draco had neither confirmed nor denied that it was Potter. Was Potter lying for him, or did he genuinely remember it wrong?
That wouldn’t be too much of a problem if there wasn’t that part of him that wanted to impress Draco and woo him.
He didn’t know why he had expected something else. Nor did he know what he had expected and the brief jolt of fear he had felt, now seemed foolish and cowardly.
Hermione looked at him and Ron, sighed and went over to the staff table, taking Neville with her. She sat down in her normal seat and Neville wound up taking Harry’s spot next to her. Harry didn’t mind, per say, but Neville wasn’t a staff member so it was a bit unconventional.
“Thanks, but I don’t actually want it, nor does anyone else want me to have the job.” Draco mumbled, picking at his fingernails. “You can have it.”
And then Harry went and said the cheesiest thing possible, almost ruining the whole thing as it nearly made Draco burst out laughing. “Don’t worry, I’ll protect you.”
Before Harry knew it Draco had wrapped Harry into a hug. For the thousandth time that day Harry felt like crying. They stood there for who knows how long.
Someone’s wand alarm went off the next morning, likely Draco’s. Harry reached across Draco and slapped it onto the floor making it shut off.
And there was no denying that Ha- Potter was attractive... very attractive. Draco forced his thoughts out of the gutter and refocused his attention to the world around him. Potter was looking at him, his expression unreadable. Draco met his eyes for a moment before looking away. If he held eye contact for too long, he might have given away his feelings with the telltale tinting of his cheeks.
He collapsed onto his bed and dropped the coffee onto his bedside table along with the bag containing his muffin.
Then there was that last bit. That bit that made Draco’s heart want to leap straight from his chest. Harry had asked him to go on a date! A date! As in the two of them! Together!
Of course, there was a party in the eighth year common room waiting for the team when they got back. But Draco wasn’t really in the mood to party, he just wanted to celebrate with his boyfriend... in their room. But Draco was the captain and he had to stay, at least for a little while. Many of the seventh years from the various houses had found their way up to the common room and joined in the festivities, even Ginny, despite her loss had decided to join in.
After taking a run around campus Harry went and did a cool down lap in the pool in the free lane next to the swimmers. He was very much not a swimmer but he had found it was one of his favorite ways to cool down after a run.
“It’s a book, I worked on it over the summer. People are gonna want a biography for me at some point. I thought I’d rather write it before someone like Skeeter screws it up. It’s got a bit more in it than the draft I’m working on now, that one’s not gonna be ready for the public until the summer. This one’s more personal, you don’t have to read it, I just thought I’d share it with you.”
So that is why Harry hadn’t told Draco, it wasn’t because he didn’t want to, it was because he physically couldn’t. Maybe there was hope after all!
“Shit. I’ve got hallway duty. I put up a sound barrier to block the thunder. Thanks for waking me, I gotta go.”
“I’m not entirely sure, I know he tried to get his wand back from Harry Potter, but I don’t think he fought for either side. After Potter faked his death, the three of us didn’t fight at all. We stayed in the castle after the battle was over, no one seemed to care that we were there.”
“Remember that this is about the defensive magic, not the war heroes.” Harry added as the bell started to ring, “Class dismissed.”
“Since you’re all in one piece, I take it the visit went well?” Harry asked, as he strode into the room.
“Hard is a relative term for this lesson, but I’m pretty sure everyone will feel better by the end of it.” No, he didn’t need to shower, he smelled like Harry- like a mix of treacle tart, broomsticks and something else, something that was entirely his own.
“Damnit, so it’s really not Granger then? But Potter, I can see it. It still makes more sense than Weasley,” Pansy said with a grin.
Ron had started auror training and Hermione was busy spending time with Neville before his apprenticeship started, leaving Harry more time to himself. That meant Harry spent most of his time either with Draco at the manor or taking Teddy to the park. Though Harry was finally close to finishing his cleanup and redecoration of Grimmuald. That had been slowed for a few weeks when he decided to reconfigure some of the layout on the third floor. He had started seeing his mind healer again. He supposed that was the best way to spend an afternoon a week.
“Trace loves it, she’s happier than I’ve ever seen her, and she spent the whole time trying to convince me to go back with her and just ditch school for the second semester.” Daphne said, “I really considered it.”
They sat together for over an hour, basking in each other’s warmth before Harry began to really eat, rather than picking at it. Fearing Harry would stop if Draco acknowledged the change in any way, he leaned over and swiped a book from the nightstand, idly flipping through the pages and pretending to read it, while secretly sneaking period glances in Harry’s direction.
“Draco was given the Dark Mark when my husband, Lucius, failed to acquire the prophecy regarding the Dark Lord and Harry Potter. The Dark Lord set Draco with a task he knew Draco would be unable to do, as punishment, he hoped Draco would die in his attempt to kill Dumbledore.” Draco’s mother explained.
That was enough for Sirius to turn around and follow Draco’s line of thought. He studied Draco for another few seconds.
“Thanks. Right now it’s not to hard, since I’m at school Andie has custody and I just visit. We’ve planned for me to have weekend custody or something along those lines after I graduate. That’s what I’m a bit scared of. Especially because he’ll probably be spending most of those weekends at Hogwarts.”
They did a quick demonstration then they set everyone up in a big circle facing outwards, so as not to distract each other. Harry and Hermione roamed the inside of the circle making little corrections. Ron produced it right away, as did Macmillan, though both had been able to do it before class.
Harry snorted and stood up, stretching his limbs and offering Draco a hand. Draco took it and Harry pulled him into a standing position. “I’m not enough of a benefit then?”
The game continued. Harry dared Hermione to down a glass of the alcoholic drink of questionable contents that was being served on the other side of the room. Hermione asked Draco about his first crush, a male celebrity Harry had never heard of. Pansy returned and did her dramatic reading, Neville got dared to let Pansy write on his back in sharpie. The game got interesting when it got back to Blaise.
“Right. I’ve gotta put things back first.” He vanished the pillows and blankets, and put the picnic back into its basket, the candles were extinguished and they floated back to their resting place.
“You spend hours each night studying. I know, I serve you the coffee that keeps you awake. You really deserve a break sometimes.” Harry carefully measured a portion of popcorn as he talked.
“Well I’m about to get quite busy with classes starting up again, but I enjoy teaching.” Remus said, he worked as a professor at the university.
He went out to the pitch and ran a lap around the field before running some drills on his broom. He went in for dinner, then decided it would be smart to go take a shower.
“Well go on then,” Harry prompted expectantly. He crossed his arms, but it wasn’t in an imposing way nor threatening at all. Everything about Harry’s stance demonstrated openness, to Draco, who knew Harry’s body language better than he should have. Better than any roommate should have. “Anytime now.” Harry said, smiling slightly.
Draco cast his eyes around the room, searching for anything to indicate what she had asked. “Er- sorry, what?”
So you might have noticed this chapter has a name. Well, Tay got a bit bored and decided to go through and name our chapters. So you will most certainly be seeing more of those as we continue!
Quite a few stood, enough that Harry couldn’t tell whether or not they were declaring her innocent or guilty.
Once everyone was seated, Harry began the lesson, “Okay, so I know we’re all feeling pretty shitty after yesterday and likely all should be seeing mind healers, so I thought it’d be nice to do a more uplifting lesson. But fair warning we are starting the real review for NEWTs tomorrow.”
“I got some of your favorites. If you wanna talk I’m here.” Draco said, wrapping his arm around Harry and putting a piece of fruit in his mouth.
“You can hold my hand if you need to.” The thought just spilled out of his mouth. Harry was trying not to be mortified when Draco simply brushed it off.
Hey everyone! Hope you're having a great summer thus far. Though Appie and I are writing fan fiction for JKR’s books, this does not mean we condone her recent comments or actions. The things she has said as of late are absolutely appalling and go against the things we believe in. With that said, we do still love the world and characters she created during her prime. We will not let her bigotry destroy the Harry Potter books. With that said, please enjoy!
The team cheered and started to make their way to the pitch. Harry gave his new purple and gray uniform a last once over before stepping onto the field. Madam Hooch stood in the middle as a referee, and Ginny and Draco shook hands. The flying Professor whistled and fourteen brooms took to the sky, Draco quickly jogged off the pitch to the sidelines where he would direct the team from.
He rolled his eyes at the phone and dropped it back to the desk. Draco considered inviting Ron in an attempt to mend their relationship, but he quickly dismissed the idea. It felt rather pointless as he really had no interest in being friends with the sullen redheaded boy.
