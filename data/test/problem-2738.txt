Pat flinched once more as she realised that she had revealed more than she had intended to. She finally had the courage, or perhaps more accurately, the desperation to turn around and grab Ngo-Kwang’s arms, looking pleadingly into her eyes. Her own gaze was desperate, frightened and indeed pleading. “Please don’t do anything about it… Please, they would know it was me who told you. Somebody would figure it out. Please!”
Luna sighed happily as she rested her head on her knees, hugging herself slightly. “You look divine.”
“Now I kind of want to hear about the times that good little Harry Lupin broke the rules.” Colin teased Harry as he squeezed his hand one last time for comfort before letting it go.
“Nobody wants to do that.” Harry muttered under his breath.
At the very least, the older people in his life had been fooled by the idea that the twins could be the same person, even if Percy, Ron and Ginny hadn’t. “Does all of Ron’s friends know about my… mole?” George absently began touching his neck, searching for the minimalistic tell which was so small that he had never once noticed it himself.
“You alright?” George yelled over the noise of the battle.
“If you’re in control of that beast then at least I know for sure that I am safe. Did you name it Secrets?” Colin added with a more teasing tone.
After what felt like an eternity, but was probably something closer to a few seconds, Andromeda spoke up. “I… I see… Yes, I…” she sniffed before she managed to gather herself once more. “I have to say that I’m somewhat disgusted with how easy it was to simply believe the worst of her. I’ve… Had to live with the realisation that my family, my sisters, turned against me for who I was. I’ve lived with that for so long… The idea that she could possibly do it for, well, not explicitly for me… but… for…” Her voice broke as another sob interrupted her words.
“Ah, yes… Of course I was aware of that…” Remus knew that he was blushing. He was very, very aware of the fact.
“I guess you only have eyes for older elves?” Harry teased his friend back, referring to Kreacher.
“I have been considering visiting Secrets recently, as I haven’t seen her since the year started. I don’t think she would mind destroying it.” Harry didn’t hesitate in accepting the small package from the old wizard, offering him a smile in return.
“Why naturally, I don’t mind in the least,” Albus smiled, appearing to relax somewhat as he was no longer asked to focus on his past.
“I have received a letter from a trusted albeit non-magical friend who is keeping an eye on the orphaned children in search of possible mages to bring to Hogwarts in the future. One such potential mage has appeared and I need someone to speak to the boy urgently. Apparently, he has been using his powers in a reckless manner which risks exposing him, and us, to the world of Muggles. We hardly need to add that paranoia to the world for the moment. Not after their Great War has been concluded at last. Thus, someone has to explain to this boy the way of mages, and ensure that his evident talents do not go to waste through means of the petty bullying of a childish mind.” The Headmaster rambles at me more than he speaks to me.
“The Hero of the American Mage War, Albus Dumbledore!”
Draco appeared to have channeled the sun as he beamed at Harry with a smile which was not nearly as big as Neville’s, but equally honest and happy. Harry beamed back, happy to see his boyfriend being equally happy about the engagement as he was, as well as everyone else.
Hidden underneath his invisibility cloak, Harry ascended within the castle until he could reach neither higher nor more East. All which was waiting for him was a pale marble statue in the shape of a satyr which had been absolutely covered in colorful writing, spelling out phrases as ‘F loves A’, ‘Filch’s cat is an animagus in disguise’ and ‘Achilles and Patroclus were lovers, Stuart!’ As Harry pulled his invisibility cloak off to breathe, since he had not only lost his breath but become somewhat sweaty from his tense but altogether uneventful tour through the castle, Harry wondered if F and A were Fred Weasley and Angelina Johnson.
The entire compartment made an array of confused responses in the negative in regards to her question.
Pay felt her cheeks heat with anger and embarrassment, because he was not wrong. “We’re different from them. Besides, how can you claim to not be violent when you are literally carrying corpses over your shoulder?”
I cannot believe my eyes.
“I… I appreciate the offer-” Bill began, but before he could continue explaining that he was about to go on a date with someone and didn’t want that person to be pushed aside just because he found someone whose legs were really nice, another voice interrupted him.
Peter avoided thinking of Sirius, and the fact that he grieved for the death of such a psychopathically unstable and cruel person despite everything making it so that he shouldn’t. Peter wanted nothing more than to feel safe without Sirius, yet all he felt was pain, guilt and sadness.
The turn came to Remus, who carefully stood up as he spoke, as was expected of the person giving their report. He noticed a few mages looking at him with worry and uncertainty, as they failed to look past the werewolf and see the man himself. Remus pretended not to notice, as he was almost getting used to the looks by this point. It was not that they didn’t hurt, but he could choose to make it hurt less by not acknowledging that their fear hurt.
He was just working up his courage to try and talk to them when he was called to his family home, and informed of the fact that the Dark Lord had returned from the dead. Everyone in his family had been there, excluding Percy, who appeared to be actively avoiding the rest of his family with the excuse that his job was very demanding. Bill liked Percy well enough, but he really didn’t know him. He only really knew his brother Charlie, and the two of them had slowly become less and less close as time passed, and were now almost strangers. Friendly strangers but strangers nonetheless.
Harry shook his head, “no, but I think I might have dreamt about being her when I was sharing my thoughts with Tom.”
“I always liked the stars.” I ignore the memory of his voice as I focus on my son rather than the past. “That sounds fun.”
Reluctantly, they parted from one another, and Harry was breathing, almost softly panting, through parted lips due to the adrenaline rushing through his body.
“As many of you know, I, Dolores Umbridge, will be the Headmistress of Hogwarts from this day forth, and I look forward to each and every task and challenge which is awaiting me upon the path of this exciting personal journey. Yet a Headmistress is not a journey alone, it is one completed for the sake of you, my dear students.” She paused to allow her words to settle, smiling patiently with her hands fully visible in front of her, signalling to the audience that she was hiding nothing from them.
From under his and Draco’s bed, Harry pulled out his bag and rummaged through it until he found his bag of chocolate. After peeking inside it, Harry concluded that he had some restocking of his supplies to arrange the next time that he visited Hogsmeade. He selected a full bar of chocolate which he stuffed into his pocket, before he remembered that he was supposed to switch clothes. Luckily, the chocolate bar fit into his other pocket as well. Luna appeared to need some chocolate as well, and Harry intended to share some with her.
“Are you really? You could pretend to be for the sake of hiding who you really are…” Arthur shrugged, hoping that the other wouldn’t realise what he was doing.
Harry couldn’t help but grin slightly as Ron noticed what Harry had attempted to not draw attention to. “It was Severus’ name on his mother’s side. He was really embarrassed about that.” He covered his grin with his hand, attempting to not chuckle. It was all the harder when recalling the fact that the Potions Master had indeed been embarrassed and bothered enough to actually blush upon first handing Harry the book. Apparently, Severus had mostly taken to use another name to avoid the Marauders finding his things and actively hiding or destroying them in his teenage. The teenager had probably felt excited about the pun of the name, making him feel at least a little special in a world regarding him an absolute nobody, but the adult was more than a little embarrassed about the title.
In front of Harry stood a desk, which had a pink cushion on the chair, and an empty cup upon it. Harry saw down upon the cushion, wondering why it was there as his eyes followed the woman who was bringing her teapot over to his desk.
“It’s great to see you back and awake,” Neville smiled, patting Ron’s undamaged leg.
Greyback leaned back, giving the animagus enough space to transform into a rat. He leapt from the sofa and ran to the other end of the room, a normal, brown rat in every sense except for the right paw being a silver one. Pettigrew transformed back into a human when he was standing on the other end of the room, and became very busy with drying his neck and then attempting to close his shirt and jacket properly. Greyback clicked his tongue disapprovingly as his prey fled, yet the Dark Lord offered Pettigrew the dignity of not focusing on him.
“I do believe that Professor Binns should be removed from his teaching position, I do agree that the subject of Divination should not be taught in this day and age. I believe that Hagrid has been incompetent in the past, and that Filch is disproportionately unacceptable in his behavior towards the students. Lastly, I very much agree that a former Death Eater in the faculty should be and deserves some manner of investigation.” Severus licked his lips before he continued to speak. “Yet the way that these inspections are taking place, and the focus on Muggle-born students' academic achievements has gone past what I find acceptable. Further, I do not enjoy having my body of published works ignored for the convenient and supposed excuse that I am the partner of a werewolf, if you pardon me using that word.”
Rabastan almost stumbled as he managed to somehow deflect the spell with great effort. He looked rather pathetic to have needed that much magic to deflect such a lame spell. “Don’t call me that!” Rabastan barked.
“No, as most extremists, it was not long until he began to turn his eyes upon the community he tried to save, beginning to remove mages who stood in his path, as his and his followers' methods became increasingly more aggressive. He was ultimately arrested for the murderer of an ambassador. He later escaped from prison, but after his capture, his methods became increasingly centered around violence, as he was then a criminal on the run, not a free man and mere political leader.”
We just now realised that we forgot to state to the audiences that Teddy changed Harry's birthday to July 12, when fitting the birthday with the full moon in 1992 and the second installment. Since this series will not have any forms of real prophecies, especially not those holding up the major conflict and narrative of the Harry Potter canon, it truly didn't matter when Harry's birthday is in those aspects. This subsequently changes Neville's birthday slightly as well.
Remus was stopped in the doorway by Harry’s voice. He turned back.
This should have been it, the moment of triumph for Pansy Parkinson, where Hermione Granger was all alone and crying, and she, Pat, was standing amidst her crowd, with her boyfriend, pointing and laughing at the self absorbed study pig which was Granger.
“I thought that I had lost you… forever… and I never dared telling you that… that I…” I sniff as I lean into the hand, feeling embarrassed and ugly as my face burns and my nose and tears compete for what can bring me the most disgrace the quickest.
Lucius appeared quite so amused by the increased redness of Arthur’s face and his exclaimed embarrassment, perhaps it had been a needed distraction. The man stood up and swept more stacks off the tables as he moved, which he yet again returned with magic. Lucius began leaving with his cane in hand and his folders following behind him like a loyal, albeit floating, dog. Yet before he left, he turned to Arthur with his gloved hand on the doorknob.
“I very much would.” Harry jumped to his feet and strode to the middle of the floor, where he stood upon the carpet with the silvery snake, which was about to have a companion rather soon. “Just give me some time, and I will show you. I’m still not entirely used to it…” Harry took a few breaths, gathering himself before he slowly began to wield his internal magic.
Mum wasn’t just a baby making machine.
A few more people wanted to speak to Harry Potter, and while Colin didn’t find the conversations very engaging, he was happy that Harry wanted him there. It appeared to Colin that his presence by his friend’s side was enough to make Harry feel less lonely and pressured. By the end of the evening, Colin’s head was spinning slightly from all the names he had heard, and some of the food which had probably not been entirely alcohol free, adding to the slight dizziness which overcame him as the evening drew to a close.
Remus was nowhere to be found in the room either. With a horrible, sinking feeling in his chest, Harry turned back to his friends. “He isn’t… here?” He asked the gathering of teenagers, all of which appeared highly stressed and uncomfortable.
Colin smiled, having relaxed once more. He appeared ever so slightly flustered over how honestly Harry had spoken up about him specifically when it would have been easy for Harry to say ‘anyone’ rather than ‘Colin.’
Tom turns from me and leaves me standing alone in the kitchen, my hand reaching out for a person who is no longer there. I don’t know exactly what family he is speaking about, but I know that he just rejected me as his parent, as well as a possible, albeit older, friend.
The young woman smiled at her friend but then quickly glanced to the side as if she had some reason to not look at his face. Only Harry appeared to notice.
Somehow, Harry knew that he would always treasure the memories of how Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald came to love one another, and came to connect and make one another better, despite how life cruelly had brought them apart. Despite how their own mistakes, fears and choices had caused them to lose one another. To not reach out to one another until it was far too late. Because El didn’t listen or rely on Al when he should have. Because Al hadn’t been there, and thus could not have done anything. Because subtly changing things from afar wasn’t enough.
"You are not safe either way, but one choice would have you remembered as a hero, while the other would see you hated as a coward in history.” His expression turned humble and slightly pleading. “We’re not asking this because we want to place you in danger, we’re asking because we don’t want there to be children who grow up as we did in the future. I was lucky that a loving dad found me, but others were not.”
Harry’s hands were shaking as he committed to being as brutally honest as he possibly could in favor of telling the man what he needed to hear. This wasn’t Luna being bullied or Ron struggling to understand what he needed to do. This wasn’t Remus being worried that he wasn’t enough, or Draco needing reminders that his mistakes didn’t define him. Albus had a lifetime of regrets, all of which accumulated into a pain which a sixteen year old teenager was not really equipped to handle. Yet despite that, Harry continued on speaking, knowing that leaving the old wizard to his emotions would have been the same as rejecting Remus when he needed and asked for help. Harry simply couldn’t do that.
Arthur gently shook his head, “I don’t mind. You’re dear to me as well. I know this isn’t how it was supposed to be, and I suppose we shouldn’t have made quite so many, but I don’t regret having children with you. I say that knowing well that you had to do all the work… Maybe that was rude of me? Uhm…” He bit his lower lip as he looked to the side, his face began to turn red again.
“I’m sure she will still allow the Prefects to rent out bathing clothes in summer.” Lovegood’s distant, dreamy voice gently asserted itself into the conversation.
“From what I have gathered, collecting the goblet would pose the question of breaking into the Lestrange vault,” Severus began. “Naturally, this is impossible without the key. The general English and Scottish groups of followers in hiding are divided into one of two places, either Malfoy Manor, where the Dark Lord resides, and the Lestrange estate. Recently, a divide has begun to shape where those interested in violence and warring have begun to migrate to Malfoy Manor, while the more peaceful ones, the victims and the refugees are staying at the Lestrange estate, located somewhere in Scotland. The estate is almost impossible to find as it resides within the woods, and few people know the directions there. For a while, they were connected to the Floo Powder Network, but that has long since been destroyed by the followers at the Ministry of Magic. I regret to state that I do not know its location as of presently, but I have the credentials to be shown there, should I ask under the guise of helping the wounded. Which I of course will, should I venture there. My true intent, however, would be to seek the key to the Lestrange vault.”
“By far,” Remus rose to his feet as well. “Though I believe you could ask for something to eat in the kitchen if you are hungry, which you should be by all means. Did you eat yesterday?”
“I was wondering, sir, is there a difference between mage blood and Muggle blood? You have already disclosed that there is a difference between supposedly healthy blood, and the blood of a person infected with a blood condition, but can you tell apart other types of blood?” Harry carefully managed his way through the sentence.
It was odd how good it felt to see his brother make an expression of unfiltered awe and jealousy. Further, it felt odd because George knew that it was alright, because they were not the same person and they wouldn’t always have the same thing or experiences. Just as Fred spoke about his time with Angelina, so could George speak about Padfoot and Hex-mas.
Arthur Weasley rose from the rows of people and walked to the front, having gathered a collection of parchment in front of him in preparation to speak. “May I have your attention, please? Thank you,” he nodded approvingly when the members quieted down and turned towards him. “For those of you who don’t know me, I am Arthur Weasley, the secretary of the Department of Criminal Rights and Evaluation. If you are confused, it is a new department created to protect the people accused of crimes in connection to being a Death Eater, follower or sympathiser of the Dark Lord. Our department was created after outcry towards the number of baseless accusations aimed towards certain members of our mage community.”
To Harry's relief, the unwilling Death Eater shook his head. “They have managed to connect the chimney to the network over at the Ministry, but the real problem is the Floo Powder itself. I don’t know if you know this, but the powder has been forbidden at Hogwarts since many years back, I think. Just another rule which Umbridge was ignoring. No student can bring Floo Powder in here, and Filch and the Aurors are searching specifically for it since Umbridge’s connection allowed a collection of teenagers to enter directly into the Ministry of Magic itself.”
“Do you want to start right away?” Sirius leaned his head to the side, studying Harry like he was measuring him.
All in all, the events and coincidences came together in that Kreacher often mistook Harry for his dead Master. Harry had initially found that somewhat distressing, but when he realised that he could improve the elf’s situation by simply being a decent person, and with continuous reminding of who he was, Harry found that he didn’t mind Kreacher’s company. Thus, he stayed with Kreacher, talked to him, kept him away from his angry dogfather, and before he knew it, the two of them had built a shaky relationship.
“Not the tapestry of magical deeds…” Fudge had found the damage on the mosaic wall which Harry could not care about less for the moment, but which aimed to depicture historically significant moments in the establishment of the British mage community and the Ministry of Magic. Admittedly, like most recordings of deeds, it only displayed beautified renditions of important events, rather than a more accurate version of the true happenings.
Draco laced their fingers together and hugged Harry tighter to himself. “I won’t leave again,” he whispered, revealing to them both that he was crying. “I’m not.”
Colin nodded along to Harry’s words as he focused on the path before them. He had almost fallen once that day, he wasn’t about to risk another meeting with the ground. “Thanks for asking me,” he began, “I’ve been thinking about it too and I feel like I would actually want to try being your official boyfriend, if you will have me? If it doesn’t work, we can always go back to being not-boyfriends, right? We don’t actually have to tell anyone about it, right?” He thought for a moment. “Or rather, we should tell Draco, but other than that, can’t it just be like… our secret?”
“Could you tell him thank you from me,” Harry began, “for his statement last summer in the newspaper? I never had the chance to thank him for speaking up about Diggory.” His expression had turned somewhat tense as he was speaking, and his smile appeared less genuine than it normally was.
Slughorn blinked, looked at Harry once more and then quickly shook himself to shake away the unpleasantness of the alarm which had momentarily overtaken him. “No, no. I was simply lost down a trail of thought. Do not mind me. You have convinced me at last, Albus… I shall return to Hogwarts as the new Head of the Slytherin House, as well as the current Potions Professor.”
Neville’s insecurities turned to self loathing and it was only because of his best friend that he managed to slowly accept that it was not his fault that he couldn’t defeat a mad follower of the Dark Lord. Hermione was a voice of reason which he could focus on, and her words and company made Neville able to relax once more as he began forgiving himself for what had happened at the Ministry and the Department of Mysteries.
My husband to be laughs again, and this time I laugh with him.
The Aurors, mages, reporters and every other onlooker turns towards us, gasping, mumbling, pointing. I have been dirtied by sitting and speaking, as well as being touched, by El. It appears to them as if we have been fighting, and there is likely some blood upon my clothes as well, even though I am not hurt. We have both lost our wands, and I can hear them whisper of a legendary mage duel which likely took place within that cave.
“Oh thanks a bunch!” Goyle was already running down the path once more, followed by the heavy and old Fang.
A shadow of sadness passed over the man’s expression before he shook his head, and thus his silvery beard and braided hair. “Just a brother, I’m afraid.”
Firenze appeared quite different as he was completely dressed, not only upon his upper body, but his horse body wore some manner of clothes as well. Harry thought of them as clothes, as a ‘horse blanket’ felt far too rude of a word to describe what the centaur was wearing. He appeared handsome in his clothes, but it did not quite appear natural, especially since Harry had first known the centaur in his natural state. Harry could only hope that Firenze had chosen to wear clothes on his own accord, rather than been forced to by Umbridge, the Board of Governors and the faculty.
“See, if you really haven’t done anything wrong, legally speaking, and if you were really forced into all that you did, you should be perfectly safe, shouldn’t you?”
Harry recovered in time to the Halloween feast, and after taking a long shower, he felt ready and clean enough to be social. His sickness appeared to have been caused by emotionally overworking himself, and when it had passed, Harry chose to not think of the things which had drained him, namely his conversation with Chang.
Umbridge’s words didn’t appear to be registering to the man, as he too began petting Fang, continuously cooing over how handsome he was as Professor Dumbledore slowly slid behind his desk, leaving the Minister alone with the dog.
While Draco was officially still working on completing his mission, hidden somewhere in the castle, he was actually spending all the time he could together with Harry in his room. They couldn’t speak or even really look at one another outside of that small room, but within it, they were allowed to be boyfriends again, which they had both missed immensely. While it wasn’t quite the same as before, it was nonetheless wonderful to be allowed that comfort. Every night felt like the final night as the two of them worried about whether they'd be forced to part, but they didn't let it stop them from trying to remain together.
After a few minutes of simply walking, Pat spoke up again in a very quiet voice. “Say, Goyle… Do you think that Vince has changed?”
Sometimes, you simply had to make your own little golden moments; at least that was what Harry reasoned as he brought the horrendously ugly unicorn tea cup out of the cupboard, to later serve tea in to no other than Draco Malfoy.
It was cold and he was using his internal magic to stay warm for the first time. It was easier than he had thought since he had good control over his magic courtesy of becoming an Animagus, but he was mostly going along and figuring it out as he went.
“I didn’t love you like I should have, but I truly did love you as my son,” Albus softly spoke to the reflection of his teenage son. The hand which rested upon the glass bore many rings, but none of them upon his ring finger, since he could not wear the ring he truly wanted to wear.
“At once, sir!” Dedalus Diggle agreed and simply apparated from Arthur’s office, leaving a collection of papers and documents flying around them as Arthur and the other mage exited his office.
There was a clatter by Lucius Malfoy’s table as the man had knocked his inkhorn over with a careless movement, as he had stood up and turned towards Bellatrix. Malfoy would not normally have chosen to spend time with them, especially not when he had work to complete. Death Eaters might not automatically make for unpleasant company to a Pureblood mage, but a collection of half-starved and half mad prison fugitives were not ideal for a good work environment.
Only Harry was no God, and he was no priest. He was but a human, one fully capable of setting the hanging stock ablaze if he had to. He squeezed Draco’s hands harder.
“Do you really think he’ll come?” The werewolf within Bill made the question a whimper.
At first, Arthur had mostly joked about how stupid he was in the face of liking Muggles for the sake of mocking the people who really through he was like that. His favorite line was to ask people about their supposed ideas for the usage of a rubber duck, mostly so that he could flaunt his own knowledge that rubber ducks existed, while also watching the mages sweat over having no idea what a rubber duck was, even if he knew perfectly well that it didn’t really have a significant function.
Harry had spent a number of summers and quite some time at Malfoy Manor, yet he had not seen even close to all of the rooms and places on the premise. He absentmindedly wondered if Draco had. The green parlour was a room which he had seen before, yet it was not a room which he had spent a lot of time within. Nonetheless, the room was pleasant and warm, and it enhanced a lot of things which Harry enjoyed about Draco, while also being flattering to Fleur. Unbeknownst to Harry, at least one of the Weasley brothers was noticing that that room suited Harry just as much as it complemented the two blonde mages.
“Sounds like a plan,” Colin agreed.
Sirius hid his face against the man’s arm, nodding carefully so as to not smear snot upon his dad’s shirt. “Thank you for… well… everything… Then and now.”
Draco let out a weak sight as Harry’s hand reached his hip, prompting Harry to dare leaning in and kiss over his skin, carefully exploring his best friend with his lips. Draco appeared to be relaxing into the care, but he would stroke over Harry’s head from time to time, whispering weak encouragements.
The Professor blinked before he collected himself. “I see, then a scholarship isn’t necessary for you to pursue for the sake of education.”
--- Announcement ---
Draco would later inform Harry that his mother had broken all conventions of tradition by allowing the Muggle-born woman to proceed all of the Pureblood children, of which there were plenty. Then again, she was likely overjoyed to be allowed to let Sirius do whatever he wanted, rather than the prospect of having to engage in conversation with him throughout breakfast.
On the evening of the 24th of December, Arthur Weasley returned to an empty home. He had every intention of leaving his home and relocating himself at Malfoy Manor, yet he did not.
“Do you think Ron is…” Hermione didn’t know what she wanted to say, but she needed an answer to the question, even if she couldn’t actually shape it.
Sirius blinked at Harry before snorting through his nose as a smile spread over his lips. “What is that supposed to mean? All blood? For an entire circle? How are you supposed to be able to get the little details right when you paint with your clumsy finger while using blood coming from that finger?” Sirius turned his head back and forth like a confused animal. “Not to mention the high risk for blood poisoning, among other things, if you are pushing an open wound against some unclean surface.” Sirius shook his head, “really, Harry, you sound like a Medieval Muggle imagining what blood magic would be like in an attempt to scare children.”
Harry’s face was lit up by hope but Draco grabbed his face between his hands, gently but firmly holding him stuck.
“I am,” Severus did not attempt to lie. “I would refrain from it, but I do not have the option of ceasing. It is not an ability which can be suppressed, no matter my own preferences.”
Although, by the end of everything he had said, he wasn’t smiling anymore, even if he felt somehow relieved to have said all those things to someone who was technically more on Snape’s side than not. He felt like he should be embarrassed about most of what he said, but he really didn’t have the energy for that.
It felt strange to have experienced so much time in such a comparatively short amount of time. The seasons and the years had evidently changed, and El and Al had evidently become closer over that time passing. Harry wasn’t sure how old they had been in the last memory, but they had been by far older than when they had first met. For each memory he had experienced Harry felt as if there were a hundred others which he couldn’t recall that had crowded in the corners of his mind, but since they were not his own, he couldn’t know them. He could only know that they were there, and he knew they had an effect on him, but nothing else.
Draco more or less waved the compliment away. “Simply being reasonable, Headmaster.” Harry thought he sounded a little like Professor Snape when he formulated himself in that manner.
“He did open it,” Harry confirmed as he thought back to the apparition which had spoken to him. He had always thought that to be the real Tom Riddle, but upon looking at the Tom in Albus’ memories, Harry began to wonder if the Tom in the diary had actually been the way Tom wanted to be, rather than the person he actually was. Maybe even just aspects of Tom, rather than his whole personality. It was odd to think that anyone wanted to be like that, which meant that diary Tom might have been what he was really like, and he simply fooled Albus into thinking that he was better. The questions clustered inside his mind, so he decided to stop thinking about them. After all, theorising would not get him anywhere.
The diversion worked, as Remus greatly enjoyed talking about books, but while he spoke, Harry was formulating his plan. The more the plan took shape, the more reasonable and accomplishable it appeared to be. He only needed to ask Sirius for help, which was the biggest drawback of his plan, but other than that, the plan would definitely work. Probably. Likely. Harry would make it work.
Yet to Harry’s relief, a friend of his arrived shortly after the train started moving, adding unfamiliar but familiar company into the circle of friends. Colin Creevy presented a distraction from the normal, and from how things ‘should’ be. He arrived and was allowed space with them, creating a scenario which was not monotonous and therefore not reminiscent of Draco.
Harry chuckled and hid his face against his boyfriend’s neck. “You’re one to talk. Also, what do you mean that sleepwalking changes of clothes isn’t the most thrilling of scenarios?” He tapped Draco’s arm with his finger, trying hard not to chuckle again.
“It’s nothing, really, or it shouldn’t be, but I rather had a fight with Ginny after Quidditch practice. Draco says hi, by the way, he’ll be here in an hour, when the Slytherin team has finished practicing.” Ron added the final information while looking in Harry’s direction.
“Oh,” Harry nodded slowly, trying to remember what he had learned in Muggle studies. “Muggles who couldn’t marry one another needed to be able to allow a ‘friend’ to inherit, while mages had the ability to include pretty much anyone into the family, making them eligible to inherit?” He summarised as he looked between the two men.
With a sound like a weak pop, the air in front of Harry shook and Kreacher appeared, as if he had simply been in the other room. The old, wrinkled and bitter House Elf appeared to be Mr. Filch’s cousin from another species, but as Harry knew the elf to be kinder than his old age made him appear, he was not bothered by his friend.
The abandonment had not surprised anyone, not even Bella. It had nothing to do with the fact that Rodolphus had taken another husband so soon after her, and it had nothing to do with him not loving his wife, of that Narcissa was certain. Many Purebloods lived in large families, and both she and her two sisters were the result of three consequential and successful marriages. The failure of Bella’s marriage had nothing to do with Rabastan being better than her, which he probably was, but with the fact that Bella had finally stepped beyond what Rodolphus was willing or capable to handle.
Neville laughed, “and you are very beautiful.”
He was right.
“Mr. Weasley!”
He would have chosen no other course of action if he had the opportunity to relive the moment again.
“Hello, pleased to meet you.” The green eyed boy smiled at her in return.
“It’s alright, Harry,” his dad smiled at him, this time, the smile reached his eyes.
As she did, the young woman whispered into his ear, hidden by both their rather significant messes of hair, “they had to escape to not be arrested. Mr. Weasley’s office. Your dad is not hurt.”
“Sorry,” Harry finally pulled back. “It’s been a harsh year.”
This is the El who only I am allowed to see.
Professor Slughorn frowned at his words, “but… you have the exact same merits.”
“I should come with you…” Al hesitated as he did not stand up from his desk. “I truly should, this isn’t something which young mages such as yourself should be involved with when an adult can do it.”
I always imagined myself walking towards him, and instead he is removed from me.
Harry noticed how she thought that she had finally caught him or something to that end, but her security was shattered as Harry continued speaking.
Nobody, not Vince, not his mothers, not Draco and not Pat thought that Goyle would ever want any other path. It had never hit them that he could even want that.
Fred clicked his tongue as he leaned closer to George’s face, studying him with an unimpressed frown. Being close to Fred should be the most normal thing in the world, after all, the two of them were always together and always next to the other, yet the approach was suddenly uncomfortable to George, who leaned back from the other’s intruding presence.
Narcissa attempted to smile, which she failed miserably with. “Most of the guests are currently in the dining hall. Rather than confine you to a table, which I am certain that none of you would prefer, a sort of... buffet has been prepared. You may eat and drink at your leisure. The manor is big, I would suggest for you to not wander off on your lonesome. Do not touch any of the historical artifacts, painting or general art pieces or décor.”
“But that is far beyond the point, we were discussing the termination of Sybill Trelawney, not dogs.”
Narcissa decidedly pushed her sister away from her, much to Bella’s disapproval, and focused on Severus once more. “I do not care about your loyalty, I care about my son’s life. If he is left to perform the task alone then… I cannot fathom what will become of him, should he either fail or succeed. Severus, you must help us. You must help Draco.”
“I share the sentiment,” Remus agreed, as he also wished that he could do more for Narcissa than reunite her with her disowned cousin.
Remus considered telling her that it could wait, but she appeared so sincere that he surrendered and came with her a little further away from the hole in the wall.
“Yeah,” he answered shortly, glancing towards the door to the kitchen. “Kreacher, come here.” Sirius didn’t know if the House Elf had been listening in or not. He recalled that it, no, he, had a habit of listening to all manner of conversations, and reporting to Sirius’ mother or gossip to Reg.
“Me neither,” Tom admits with a childish pout. “But it always sounded rather fancy. I imagine there are raisins in it, but I hope not.”
Hermione was crying against Neville’s chest, clinging to him like he was her only support in the world. They sat on the sofa to the right, with her more or less in his lap as he carefully and gently stroked over her head and back, letting her cry until there were no more tears. Her sobs appeared to fill the room completely, as the rest of the inhabitants spoke in quiet voices so as to not interrupt her grief. They had gathered in the other end of the room, attempting to give Hermione and Neville as much space as they needed.
He announced loudly and clearly before he sent a spell towards one of the Death Eaters by the far right. His spell hit her and she was sent to the floor, crashing into the cold stone as her still body didn’t allow her to move. The Death Eaters spun towards him as the members of the Order gathered behind him, both sides aiming their wands against one another.
“Black and gold sounds classy,” Colin agreed. “Are you wearing your hair out? I like it when you wear it freely.” He added in a polite, yet slightly longing tone of voice.
Harry couldn’t stop his reaction to smile as a reaction to merely hearing his boyfriend’s name. “He surely would.”
Percy had steeled himself since the meeting was to be held by Arthur Weasley on behalf of the Department of Criminal Rights and Evaluation, and had been called in order to discuss the privately funded Albus Ward at St. Mungo’s Hospital, and whether or not it should be allowed to remain. The meeting also intended to discuss the possibility that the Ministry would choose to donate money to the cause of restoring the minds of those who had been unjustly kissed by a dementor.
The fear of rejection was something completely alien to Draco Malfoy.
The amulet was a gift from Luna’s mum, which had been given to her as a young child. The necklace itself was comparatively simple, and was a comparatively plain and cheap crystal shaped out of moonstone, then tied in thin leather straps into an intricate web of knots and braids by the deceased Pandora Lovegood. When Luna closed her hand around it, she felt as if she was holding her mother’s hand whenever she did, offering her comfort from the other side of the moon.
Bill had once believed that he himself could get sunburnt, but he quickly learned that he was the type of person who only turned red. This kid with his round glasses and dark features appeared fully capable of tanning to colors which Bill could only dream about. That was to say, if it was even a tan in the first place, the kid didn't seem the type to spend too many hours out in the sun.
She then accepted questions for the remainder of the lesson, allowing the students to properly ease their fears and worries by talking about them to her and voicing them to the class without becoming too personal.
Harry smiled at his boyfriend, feeling his own emotions overcome him in return. He wasn’t quite sure what it was that he felt, but he could identify appreciation, happiness and pride, along with some other emotions which made his chest feel tight. It simply meant that much to Harry to see his boyfriend appreciate the form of the werewolf as much as he did.
A warm hand, well probably cold but warmer than him, and thus he was brought out of his thoughts. He looked up at Draco who looked sort of shaken, but was smiling at him.
Professor McGonagall had prepared a presentation about the OWL exams, which she held for all fifth year students, rather than the usual dual House classes. Throughout the presentation she explained what the exams were and how they were conducted. She also explained that certain adjusted exams would be held to accommodate for people with both special needs and those who cast magic using internal magic.
I am silent as I let Tom finish his notes. “Do you think that only inanimate objects can become horcruxes? That is to say, could a pet become a horcrux?”
Ron shrugged, “my second oldest brother is a dragon keeper, you know that already, but his interest didn’t just start and end with dragons. He has a lot of books about snakes, which I read out of pure boredom every now and then. A lot of snakes and venomous draconic creatures function the same or similar, so Charlie had one book on the subject as well. I read it during that summer when I was recovering from having a crazy dog almost bite my leg off.”
“Positive.” Harry confirmed. “Afterwards, it was gone. Those buckets with blood were rejected out of the circle as the ritual was happening. I didn’t see it on his finger, but I’m not too certain since I was rather out of it by that time.”
“We are not without options,” Al had evidently forgotten that he wasn’t alone as he turned his focus to the young man before him. “If Tom seeks to kill me, then…” he trailed off.
“Do you feel like your own emotions are similar to any of your siblings?” Neville continued to lead the discussion. “Out of the ones you do know, that is.” He appeared slightly uncomfortable with the leadership role, but he was nonetheless attempting to act in a manner which would at least improve the current situation for the better.
“I’ve missed you so much. So much that I feel crippled,” Harry confessed. “I feel as lonely as if dad had never adopted me, I feel as without focus as if I had never come to Hogwarts. It feels ridiculous, I want to be able to move on, or something, but I don’t know how to. You’re such an important part of my life, I don’t feel complete if I’m not by your side… It’s so stupid, I’m only sixteen… We are only sixteen, and yet I feel as if… as if…” He bit his own lower lip, stifling a sob. “I love you so much. I hate being apart from you. I feel like I’ve been unable to breathe for the entire term, and every time I do see you, you steal more of my breath away as I am pulled back under when you aren’t there anymore.”
Harry thought for a second, but then nodded. “It feels oddly natural. I have spoken to snakes for most of my life, and I am friends with a gigantic old basilisk. Now that I know about the snake shape, I almost feel a little stupid for thinking that I would become a dog or canine.”
A few voices mumbled around the table.
When he is my son, he will never have to hide again.
“No.”
Lucius did not look well.
Teddy blinked at him with his large, brown eyes, carefully staring at him as if he was an animal which was trying to seize a human up to determine if the person was dangerous or not. Teddy licked his lips before opening them, revealing a truth which George wasn’t ready to hear.
“Dad would be so happy to hear you call him that.” Harry couldn’t help but smile at Ron’s words.
Bill paid for their drinks since he had a job, which was equally great to George. They arrived in time and both of them had a couple of drinks through the evening, a few sweeter and some more traditionally alcoholic. They ordered a beer for their lost friend, and allowed it to stand by an empty chair as they listened to the bands play throughout the evening.
“No…” I plead with him, taking another step forward. “We can’t… There is a war happening in the Muggle world, we cannot simply create another one overseas to add to that unrest. They have guns, El, our magic is nothing compared to their guns and their numbers. We would die!”
Harry told himself that if he had been sitting by the Slytherin table, he would have continuously looked for or at Draco during the entire evening. He didn’t want that, so he made an effort to turn his back to the table of his House, and pretended that it didn’t hurt to do so.
“So it doesn’t feel good anymore?” Ngo-Kwang continued to ask in a quiet voice which somehow flawlessly filled the slightly steamy room so fully that Pat flinched as if she had shouted.
Hermione appeared to blush as she waved the compliment aside. “Oh, thank you.”
“Dad, I’m fifteen, I’m not a child anymore.” Harry objected to his dad’s comment as he put his hands on his hips and huffed.
George had been supported through his grief primarily by Fred and his brother’s friends. Bill had been primarily supported by Fleur Delacour, his current partner. It had taken the two some time to reach out to one another, but once they did, they found that the other was a comfort. It was rather impossible for the other to think of their brother as family, since they had been apart for so long that they felt more like the other was a long since lost childhood friend. George would sometimes catch himself thinking that Percy was actually the oldest Weasley sibling, and forget all about the elusive William Weasley, and the even more elusive Charlie Weasley. Sometimes, when it was late and his mind was confused, George would think that he might have actually dreamt Charlie up. He knew it wasn’t true, but it felt like it from time to time.
“You’re not a priest, are you?” Tom whispers. He is leaning forward now, his gaze focused on me as if I suddenly materialised in front of him. “You’re really a Professor from a school who wants to take me away from here?”
Calmly, she extended a gloved hand, and accepted the letter, which she opened and began reading. Draco caught the former Gryffindor’s eye, and while the latter was grinning like a madman, a certain shine to his eye, the former was clearly trying not to panic.
Fred chuckled as he threw the pillow back, “well, I didn’t! But I thought that you’d be happy to know that I do love you to the point of having considered doing that to make you happy.”
“She is just grieving, that notebook didn’t even hit anyone!” The other teenager objected loudly. “She didn’t harm anyone!”
“Can you do something about the detention, sir?” Draco interrupted before the man could answer. “It hardly appears fair that he should receive such a harsh sentence when she provoked him.”
“You will get your new home in a little bit, just don’t leave the bed, and you can go where you want.” Harry felt a little bad as he heard the animal state her preference, and allowed her the freedom of roaming the bed.
“Oh! You startled me!”
“Fine,” Sirius made a face and clicked his tongue. He had wanted to get drunk on an empty stomach, but it appeared that he wasn’t allowed to. Sirius honestly didn’t know why he had expected anything else.
“Then I won’t.” George felt childish as he responded.
The fact that a Marauder considered George someone who he could be friendly with meant a lot to the depressed teenager. The contact felt good, not necessarily physically, but mentally. George hadn’t really been physically close to anyone but Fred, and to have a friend who wasn’t scared to touch him out of fear that George was planning a mean joke on them, was a huge relief to him. One which George hadn’t known that he needed.
I nod to myself as I rest my head in my hand, gathering the information I have on the topic within my head. “That is quite the rare, obscure magic. If you don’t mind me asking, how did you come across it?” I do not feel alarmed by his inquiry, but slightly confused. There should be no information about the topic within the Hogwarts library, as it is considered too diffuse of a subject to be listed in an academic establishment.
He continued to wait as she tried to speak once more.
The young boy raises his hands towards my creation, and I have it land within his open palms. He is smiling and the expression of joy fills his green eyes with tears. He turns towards me as he cradles the harmless spell within his cupped hands, holding it as if it is his most treasured item.
From hereon out it may be wise to not expect to know anything within the narrative, as the close readings on the seventh book concluded in a lot of things which are not fit for this narrative as it has progressed.
“I think that Professor Slughorn needs to meet you, not Harry Potter. Would you mind if I remove your hairpin?” Neville reached for it, but he did not touch it before Harry gave his consent.
“You shouldn’t have.” Harry agreed. He was already feeling his anger melt away and be replaced with happiness. “That’s great though! I’m really happy that you will teach me!” He couldn’t hold back the joy from his voice, it seeped through and made him feel light and happy.
The three arrived and were welcomed in by a happy Hagrid, who had spotted them approaching by chance and had already begun heating up water. As the three of them began to carefully shake the soft yet cold morning rain off their coats and clothes, an unfamiliar guest approached them alongside Fang. Draco knelt down to pet the dog without even noticing the other animal, but Harry and Colin were busy observing the feline who was making her way towards them with slow, swaying steps and far too human eyes.
“There is no legal evidence that the Malfoys have ever done anything illegal,” Arthur Weasley objected. “Your hostility towards them is based on ideas which have not been proved, and your willingness to condemn even the wife and the child when you are upset with the husband is frankly disgraceful.”
“It seems that my primary option lies in the Department of Magical Law if I want to become the Minister of Magic.” Hermione chuckled, evidently not being serious when she referred to herself as the future Minister of Magic, but not joking altogether. “That being said, it offers some more options than simply Minister of Magic, of course. Being a judge doesn’t sound entirely bad either. I feel like I could actually do something there which I would feel proud of through such a career.”
“I… That… the wyvern…” Draco mumbled under his breath as he simply stared in horror. “It’s… tacky…” he whimpered.
The idea was to cause Harry Potter to break into the Ministry of Magic, which was already highly paranoid due to the incapable man who was known as the Minister of Magic. The effect of an icon of freedom turning against the symbol of stability and law in their community would be tremendous, and cause Potter to be ruined as a political tool by the Ministry for the purpose of keeping stability. Cracks would form, people would feel doubt, and at the end of that doubt was an ideology which would rise and fill those cracks.
“I was helping mother clean out some of her jewellery, and we found this rather old thing, which made me think of you.” Draco sat back down upon the bed, having collected a small jewellery box from his bag. “ I know you generally do not wear a lot of these, but I thought you might appreciate this one.”
Almost everyone in the room responded with an affirmative noise or word.
Harry, Colin, Hermione, Neville and Teddy all wanted to stay at Hogwarts, as none of them wanted to go back home and simply leave everyone around them for a period of time which might never end. Especially Teddy refused to go home out of fear of who might be waiting for him there. Hermione had no desire to return to her Muggle parents who respected neither her identity as a witch nor that of a woman. Neville didn’t want to leave his friends or his plants, and both Harry and Colin felt like they had too much to lose in simply hiding to save themselves. When they met Ron the next day, he informed them that he also had every intention of staying at the school, rather than go home to a household which was mostly engaged with the Order of the Phoenix.
Harry hugged her tightly in response as he felt tears form in his eyes, “thank you.” He responded loudly as he allowed himself to hide against her shoulder. He wasn’t sure how much he had cried that night, yet it appeared that he still had more tears to shed.
Goyle continued to look at her with a complex expression which was too intelligent for such a round, harmless face. She turned her gaze away.
“May I see that book?” Ron held out his hand for the item.
Harry stood up and took the tray from Fred, then stood aside as everyone else exited the room to allow him and Draco to be changed and then get changed in peace. Molly Weasley had given them some of her clothes suitable for the bigger redheaded woman, and Draco had collected some clothing which he thought would fit the blonde witch to be from the Black wardrobes. Everyone exited with the women walking upwards so that Ginny and Luna could help Hermione with the back lacing of her new dress, also courtesy of Walpurga Black who really didn’t need any of her clothing anymore. Augusta Longbottom appeared to have known Mrs. Black personally, and seemed to find great satisfaction in handing the dead woman's clothes to the young Muggle-born witch in need of them.
El stops and he pulls his hands and body away from me. He doesn’t want to touch me. Why doesn’t he want to touch me? I step towards him in return, feeling panic rise in my chest.
“It’s more complicated than that…” Lucius whimpered.
Harry recalled the blonde man seemingly crying over Sirius’s death, and the sight of the bleeding boy in front of his father’s kneeling body did not help the man calm down in the least. Harry watched him sway before the starved man simply folded over and fell towards the ground as he passed out. However, he was caught by his husband before he could hurt himself on the white marble floor.
“I don’t even know what Holy Water is,” I chuckle gently as I shake my head.
Professor Snape didn’t bother pretending that he hadn’t noticed the question forming in Draco’s mind. “You wonder why I do have the Death Eater mark if I was never involved with them to that extent.” He clarified, mostly to Harry, as Draco nodded.
“Yup, my Ted is right there, talking to those people,” Andromeda pointed towards her husband. “He’s the one with the black rimmed glasses and bowtie.”
“...They did what?” The Dark Lord’s voice carried no emotions but a passive, barely noticeable hint of disbelief.
Nyhm whistled quietly, “that’s a patronus. Wicked.”
“That sounds fine with me, it will be nice to not be surrounded by people. I still find that a little tiring since the silence of Azkaban.” Sirius reached out and grabbed George’s arm, locking their limbs together in a manner which George translated into familiarity.
“I’m coming back up… This might take a while.” Harry took a deep breath and then cast a levitation spell upon himself and then slowly ascended upwards in the pipe like a drunk pelican. Somehow, this magic always made other people appear dignified, but with Harry, he didn’t quite manage to make it look quite so effortless.
“So you haven’t done t-”
Tom has the body language and confidence of El as he strides towards me from across the room, appearing collected, pleasant and distinctly gathered. In general, this means nothing more to me than the fact that he is harder to argue with since he knows how to argue with facts and logic, rather than emotions. For how much I want to be logical, I never feel like I am when it comes to disputes, but El was and so is Tom by now. For six years now, he has lived in the Slytherin dormitories rather than with me in my small accommodations. We have not so much grown apart as we are preoccupied with different engagements. Or so I like to think.
“Yes, Master?” Kreached heeded his summons and appeared behind the Master, taking whatever pleasure he could in scaring the man who had treated him badly for so many years.
The former friend of the son of a werewolf avoided looking at Harry completely. He was staring into the misty woods, refusing to even look at Harry and Colin. There was a careless air about him, as if he could not even be bothered to pay attention to his previous partner and former friend.
Time stops. The world fades. There is nothing but the two of us, so deeply in love and so drunk with happiness that we weave a secret magic spun by both Muggles and mages throughout all the ages since the beginning of humanity.
“kiss me.”
The Hufflepuff table was objecting as well, seeing as many of them liked to have friends and to be with their friends without truly caring for the boundaries of their House.
However, it is not that nobody has ever managed making horcruxes before; some objects are infused with parts of a person's magic essence. This could be related back to Bill's Curse Breaking and work to deal with certain artifacts having become horcruxes, among other magic.
Harry found himself squeezing Draco’s hand, very careful not to touch his fingers, as his vision suddenly swam with tears. He turned back to his friends, who were crowding behind him, but whom all had stopped when they saw how much worse off Draco was compared to Ron. None truly wanted to enter the space, and they all looked towards Harry for confirmation of what to do.
“Why did your tribe exile you?” Draco’s question could have been phrased in a more careful manner, but as the situation was somewhat abnormal, he failed to adhere to the conventions of mannerisms.
“Can we go watch the stars together too? I want to be prepared for classes when I do take them.” Tom looked up at me with hopeful eyes which do not remind me of El, but of myself.
“I’m doing all the work on our stupid book! We have a deadline, and you haven’t kept any of them! You’re wasting our future in having a girlfriend!” George continued to scream, his eyes beginning to fill with tears as his anger continued to rise.
Peter Pettigrew was a small man with a thin body which had not lost weight in a healthy manner. His face was thin, his hair was thin and a lot of his body had been mutated by being a rat for too many years. His mouth, teeth, hand and feet were the primary noticeable mutated parts, yet his ears were slightly fluffy from the long time he had spent in his animagus form. However, the ears could be somewhat hidden behind his shoulder length, grey hair, the animalistic teeth and the yellow, sharp nails were harder to hide. His right hand had been lost in an attack by Bellatrix Lestrange, and had been replaced by a silvery hand created by the Dark Lord. Peter quickly hid that hand behind his back as he recognised Snape.
“But what if I… If I do that… what if he doesn’t…”
Remus did the same, before he leaned back in the chair and stared up at the ceiling. He had been called a friend. The wonderful warmth remained in his chest as he hid his face in his hands, chuckling quietly to himself.
It had been a long time since Harry had appeared so relieved. He stared at Neville with deep gratitude in his eyes, smiling as if he was only doing it to keep from crying. Neville reached out and gave his hand a squeeze, feeling Harry’s favorite ring dig slightly into the palm of his hand as Harry squeezed his hand back.
“I don’t think we will ever understand it on our own. Then again I was rather... occupied with Remus at that time, and probably didn’t notice what actually went on between them.” Snape drank some more of the wine in his glass before he continued. “There were many things I could never quite agree with about Lily. We were good friends, I spent almost every day together with her and her Muggle sister Petunia when we were younger. I was very close to them.” Snape stopped to study Sirius, waiting for him to interrupt or question.
--- Facts & Headcanons ---
Harry chuckled softly, “oh Colin, you messed up the buttons.”
Cornelius Fudge resigned as the Minister of Magic after the return of the Dark Lord.
The phone was wonderful, as it allowed Remus to keep in contact with his partner and friends, but also allowed Harry to speak to his friends. Remus and Molly spoke to each other a lot, as the two of them were rather lonely people. Remus liked her company, as he could often simply sit quiet and listen to her speak for what appeared like hours. He didn’t quite believe everything that the woman said, especially when it came to her children or husband, but he liked to hear her speak nonetheless.
For some reason, or maybe no reason at all, George learned to blame himself a little less for Sirius' death after that night at the bar, where he had fun listening to music with his brother.
Harry felt his cheeks heat up as he willingly stepped into Colin’s embrace and hugged him around the neck. “Not-boyfriend,” he agreed. It felt wonderful to be in Colin's arms, and to be able to relax into them with full security that he was safe.
Sirius snorted through his nose. “Great one. So a dog, like me.” He appeared proud of this idea, which Harry took as a relief as he had been worried that his dogfather might be upset if Harry wasn’t like James Potter. Which he wasn’t in the first place, but seeing how much Sirius had struggled with that fact, Harry hadn’t dared to hope.
Ron, being one of the Prefects of Gryffindor quickly became busy with his duties as well. After Umbridge’s reign and general chaos left behind by her Disciplinary Committee, there were a lot of things which needed to be done, and certain records which needed to be looked over. New clubs were forming all around the school in the simple response that they were allowed to exist again. Ron began working closely with Lavender Brown, another Gryffindor Prefect from his class, as it was simply convenient for them to get a hold of one another when they needed.
I simply hold his hand and beg anyone who might be listening that Gellert will not leave.
Every now and then, the two of them would exchange words or tell the other about something remarkable or noteworthy within the narrative of their novel. Sometimes, either of them simply wanted to complain about a character’s actions or motivations. It was overall a pleasant activity with pleasant company, and a somewhat needed break from the noise which was caused by the group of teenagers being together all at once.
she is not any form of shapeshifter or animagus.
“Indeed,” Mrs. Malfoy agreed, “I do wonder where my cousin might have gone. Nonetheless, he should be around the manor somewhere.”
“Language is indeed the most challenging problem. El was, as I believe that you have understood, quite the genius both academically and magically. He had Russian relatives and therefore dabbled in the language from an early age, and then began studying English when he learned that he might become an exchange student at Hogwarts one day. He was very dedicated.” Albus played with his braid as he spoke, smiling in a nostalgic manner. “He truly made everyone else appear lazy, but he never cared to. He was simply doing what he wanted, and worked to pursue the goals he desired. He was also frighteningly good with people, as I am sure that you have also realised.”
“And Slyherin’s locket,” Tom agrees, eagerly leaning forward. “That would make four very valuable horcruxes which nobody would want to destroy, even without the implementation of charms. That love you spoke of would already be there.”
Firstly, Molly had come to realise that she had never once met the man in question, yet he had a significant impact on her life.
He was paler than Harry had ever really seen him, making the scar less visible, but nonetheless present upon his face. He had begun to wear gloves to meals and to class, and the whites of his eyes appeared more red than they should be. As November turned into December, and the Holidays were approaching, Draco’s state of being appeared to continuously change for the worse. His grades were slipping, but at the very least he was still answering questions correctly when they were expressed to him. He would sometimes react to loud noises by flinching and gripping his cane tightly enough for his gloves to squeak with the movement.
Neville returned with the finished tea, which he placed on the table before her. He then turned to locate an empty planter box, which became a good enough seat once turned upside down. He looked up at her, but Hermione knew that her hair and hands were doing an adequate job of keeping her hidden from view. “So… what happened?”
“We were sent here by Hagrid,” Draco spoke up first, then proceeded to summarise the events of that day, concluding on the fact that Hagrid was currently caring for a wounded centaur in his hut with the help of Goyle. Which was why Fang was currently accompanying them through the castle.
Sirius laughed loudly in return, “fellow disappointment! To think the house didn’t fall with the both of us under the same noble roof.”
“Of course, stay right there.” Harry grabbed two cushions from the sofa and brought them with him. He gave one to Luna as he sat down upon the other. She hugged hers rather than sit down upon it, which was her choice, not his. “I’m here,” Harry gently reminded her.
“Since the breakout, they have managed to capture two of the escapees,” Hermione’s gaze rested upon Neville as she carefully spoke up. “Another person was found drowned, which makes it so that there are currently seven Death Eaters on the run.”
“I fear that what Umbridge is doing has been removed from the idea of an Education Inspector, and has devolved into a hunt for the teachers who do not suit her general idea of what a teaching body should be, rather than what deserves evaluation and improvement.” The tired Professor sighed deeply yet again, as a conflicted scent rose from him.
The three people were the young Albus, and the Tom Riddle who had been adopted by him, who was older than a child, but not yet an adult. The two of them lived together in peace and joy with Gellert Grindelwald, who wore his engagement ring upon his finger with pride. The Albus in the reflection possessed one ring just like it. The family were doing mundane things, cooking together, eating by the table, curling together on the sofa to watch Muggle movies while Tom sat to the side, in an armchair. In his wish, El and Tom spoke a lot, and Albus himself laughed plenty as he was allowed to live happily with his partner and his son.
After Harry got over his initial shock and pain of being broken up with, he began to suspect that something was odd about the letter.
On different ends of the room stood Fred and George Weasley, both of them being in the middle of a verbal shouting game. It was only possible to tell that George was the right one based on his burned, gloved hands, which he kept balled by his sides as he continued to yell.
“Oh please, Aberforth has been hinting on you having a relationship with a ‘very bad man,’” he mimics my brother’s voice as he speaks. Tom has placed his hands on his hips now, something he only ever does when he is honestly upset about something. “Don’t I deserve to know anything about you, dad?”
“Just turning around is fine,” Harry promised his date as his heart raced away within his chest. He hoped that he looked calmer than he felt.
If she hadn’t had Vince, that could have been her.
Sirius looked towards Harry, his tired gaze requesting help, silently pleading for it. Harry, as the elf whisperer he apparently was, decided to help his dogfather communicate.
Arthur accepted the note and looked down upon it. He felt as if he had been punched in the chest as he quickly glanced over the short list of confirmed escapees. Amongst the names was his. Lucius Malfoy.
Hermione was carrying her monster cat, Crookshanks, in her arms. Harry had almost forgotten that he existed, but when he saw the familiar, almost flat face and the more than intelligent gaze of the fluffy animal in her arms, Harry recalled him well. It appeared that the cat helped her calm down, and he appeared by no means opposed to being carried around. He had become a little rounder since the son of a werewolf last saw him. Unbeknownst to Harry, Crookshanks had actually lived with Molly Weasley and the Weasleys for a while, he simply hadn’t actually noticed. He thought that the orange cat which he had sometimes spotted to be a different cat who lived there, when it had in fact been the very same. Harry concluded that Crookshanks had likely been on the train too. He must have been sleeping up on the luggage rack, mostly out of sight from Harry.
Thus, they had no choice but to ask for help, which they got without question when the members of the Order learned that children might be in direct danger of being hurt or even killed by the runaway Death Eaters. Luckily Professor Dumbledore had explained Sirius' situation to the Order previously, so at the very least they didn't have to bother with that. For the past months, it was just that Sirius was to widely recognised as a mass murderer and they did not have the means as to prove to the world that he was innocent, so while the Aurors of the Order wouldn't hound him, he had still been a prisoner in his own home.
If Harry had been uncomfortable before Draco got into the air, it was nothing compared to how uncomfortable he was once his best friend was flying. Draco was nothing like the confident flier who has impressed Harry year after year with his abilities. In fact, he was flying with such lack of direction and such insecurity that Harry almost thought himself to have done a better job, should he be forced upon a broom.
“He says that you are welcome!”
“Abe, you don’t talk like that!” Dad speaks up sternly as he crosses the room to separate the two of us, as we likely appear to be about to fight with one another.
'Draco might not be there, but Harry, and all his friends, were together. They all wanted to save their friend.
In Harry’s confusion, he could only focus on one thing which Crabbe had told him. “Potter?” He echoed, feeling as if Crabbe had just ripped a part of him out of his chest and carelessly crushed it in front of his eyes.
The Muggle-born witch snorted and tried not to laugh again, “so I’m an irritant that worked my way into a particular species of oyster, mussel, or clam, and was covered in fluid as a defense mechanism upon which I became shiny?”
“To being wrong.” Snape raised the glass to his lips and drank.
Filch’s silhouette appeared in front of them, accompanied by his beloved feline. A light flashed towards them, causing both of them to close their eyes while George instinctively hid his hands to make identification harder for the unpleasant janitor.
“Ah, yes, of course. Pardon me.” Draco’s amusement shone through his casual tone of voice, revealing that he did in fact find the joke funny as well, despite normally acting like he was above such silly gestures.
“It’s fine,” she quickly responded.
(See the end of the chapter for
It felt somewhat strange to have an adult be his friend, but George was desperate enough that Sirius’ age didn’t really matter to him. Marauder to Marauder, their age didn’t matter, since they were not really doing anything but sharing stories and jokes with one another. Thus, the two Marauders walked off together, arm in arm, joking and laughing as they were followed by two long dogs who had nothing better to do.
Bill’s imagination immediately went to some rather interesting places with that power, and he felt himself turn red. Even if Potter was nothing like the person Bill had a date with that weekend, he was well within Bill’s spectrum of attraction.
“Are you sure you want to meet Tom, Professor?”
“Good,” Harry agreed.
“It was none of your business!” Rabastan yelled back as he deflected the second spell as well, then quickly tried to throw another back at Sirius.
“I can imagine,” Neville chuckled alongside him, prompting both Harry and Hermione to smile. They recalled how much their friend had enjoyed Ron’s hair and appearance, and wanted nothing more than to keep on touching it.
Percy glanced between Draco and Harry, likely realising that if they were there, then at least his brother Ron should be somewhere close as well. Unbeknownst to Harry, Percy only knew Umbridge’s version of the story, which was that the Ministry of Magic was under attack by a group of mad teenage Dumbledore supporters who had stormed the Ministry to try and make a point about anarchy.
“Dumbledore,” his voice is quiet and gentle, like soft moonlight through an attic window in winter. He calls me back to the present by using my name before repeating his question. “What type of magic do you primarily use?”
Harry would not envy whatever person would choose to take up the role of their future Magic History teacher. Their first year would be stressful. Or, half of their first year.
“That would be…” Harry’s words were interrupted by a hiccup. “That would be nice.”
“It… it was,” Quirrell concluded. “I was seventeen… At the time. Seventeen at the time. Being targeted by… by first years… It was hu… hum… humi…”
“I also think that it’s too easy to claim Al to only be bad, or only be good. He has lived too long to only be one thing.” Harry agreed as he wrapped his cloak tighter around him.
Narcissa had no choice but to allow them to stay and use her home as if it was their own, but she did not consider it the honor which her past self would have found it.
As the Tonks family followed Narcissa into the dining hall, Nyhm leaned in to whisper to her dad.
Colin blinked at him, evidently surprised by the sudden spin-and-apologise-by-screaming strategy which Harry had just developed. He then smiled, covering up a chuckle with his hand. “You don’t have to sound so desperate. I’m not mad at all.”
Four out of four.
“Oh, you know…” Ron dismissively waved his hand. “Somewhere. Did I use it wrong?”
Harry began placing his gathered clothes upon the bed next to Colin, who gingerly picked through them to feel the material. “Trousers it is.”
“Ron wouldn’t forget you, Teddy,” Harry reminded him with absolute certainty. Ron had lost too much, and taken too much for granted to simply throw his friends away due to having a relationship. Of that Harry was certain.
When Harry woke up in a cold sweat, he could still feel huge teeth pressing down upon his skin as the lingering phantom scent of roses remained within Harry’s nose. It took many hugs and calming kisses from Draco before Harry could fall asleep once more.
It felt good to laugh, even if he wasn’t quite certain that his laughter was even close to genuine. Nonetheless, he did find her sudden carefulness hilarious in a way which likely spoke more of Harry’s own exhaustion that it did Chang’s ability to prioritise.
“Politely rejecting me?” Potter laughed. He didn’t appear the least bothered by the fact that he was being rejected, and he seemingly had no intentions of trying to push Bill into taking the rejection back.
“Me?” Harry blinked. “Weren’t you among the first who managed producing a corporeal one?”
“Or go ask Professor Snape, I hear he defeated the troll the last time one got inside.” Luna added in a quiet, yet ever so slightly mocking voice.
“It is. He shouldn’t have done that to me,” Lavender agreed.
The camera and the bag were both two things Colin greatly treasured from his birth dad, but he had long since stopped treasuring them because they were from him. These days, the camera was treasured by Colin because it was his, and because it was fun to take pictures.
Hermione nodded approvingly, “I hope he is well taken care of.”
Mr. Malfoy was sentenced to Azkaban for the rest of his life, as one of Minister Scrimgeour’s first changes to the Ministry was to assure that those given to the dementors of Azkaban were never granted a release ever again. He claimed it to be for the sake of the future, and while some people were opposed to the idea, the vast majority was too frightened by the risk of another mage war to accept the risk of Death Eaters being released once more, simply because they had served their time. The followers of that ideology needed to be kept as far away from the public as possible, few other things mattered more.
Yet here he is, and I cannot believe it.
“Harry, I can’t… I can’t let you… That would be… If you’re… I lost Sirius, I lost James, I lost Lily, I lost Peter… I can’t… If you were to be…” As he spoke, the tears began to flow from his eyes, as unstoppable as they always were when the werewolf cried. He always held too much back to be able to not fall together when he did reach the breaking point.
Luna asked Harry if he believed in squonks, which he regrettably did not, but he stated that he was open to change his opinion if it turned out that they did exist. He said so despite not knowing what a squonk was. Luna appeared satisfied nonetheless with his willingness to entertain the possibility of their existence.
No wonder Horace Slughorn had been so scared and protective, for the memory was far more useful and detailed than anything which either Harry or Al had hoped. Al had been right in that Tom learnt of the type of magic from Professor Slughorn, but this was far more detailed than what they had expected.
“Stan, we have to go, now.”
“We have to tell someone,” Harry’s voice left no room for discussion or doubt. “Either Al or Severus. This is too big for us.”
The Mage War and his time in Azkaban had stolen many things from Sirius, among those his desire to seek out partners to mend the presence of his mental pain. He was not welcome in Remus’ bed, Snape had never been and would never be an option. Thus, Sirius had accidentally left the days of wild loving behind himself. Bill had truly been his first opportunity to obtain a lover since almost fifteen years, and Bill was currently not an option by his own choice. Not that Andromeda really was aware of any of those things.
“There are children up here, Sirius!” Remus leaned over the railing, calling after his friend.
“Very much so,” the Headmaster hummed as he nodded. “Ten points to Slytherin for your thoughtfulness. Very good, Mr. Malfoy.”
“The one with the black hair?” Andromeda nodded, assuming that the one who shared at least one feature of the young man was his father.
“Which one would you think I meant?” the Headmaster mused with a smile on his lips as he offered Harry his arm.
Harry nodded, “I am.”
The two mages looked at one another from across the room. They waved as one, laughed at the synchronised gesture, and Harry left for his room. His head was full of thoughts packed so tightly that he almost felt numb. He was in desperate need of a long, dreamless sleep in which nothing mattered.
Colin handed the candy box to Harry and soon enough, the group were sitting silent in the room, eating chocolate. Colin had found a space on top of Harry’s desk, and Harry was thus able to lean against him, even if it wasn’t all that comfortable.
Professor Snape moved behind his desk and began searching for something. Harry took it upon himself to pull a chair out while the man searched for what proved to be a collection of Harry’s previous grades and summaries from other teachers, with the Defense against the Dark Arts note being absent due to the fact that Mr. Moody, that is to say Crouch Junior, never had the opportunity to fill it in.
The ministry official who was to wed the two of them called for everyone’s attention. Bill and Fleur then turned towards the person in question, a rather squarish, past middle aged witch with a collection of white hair, dark skin and piercing hazel eyes. “We shall now begin the wedding ceremony,” the witch said. “We have all gathered here today to partake in the joy of this young couple, who are to be united beneath the sun, moon and stars, as is tradition. Your hands, please?”
The young man next to Draco Malfoy blinked as he was included in the conversation. He turned towards them, allowing Andromeda to spot the pale lines of his lightning bolt scar upon his dark skin, which marked him as the illusive icon of the mage community, Harry Potter. She blinked, re-aligning herself to the reality of what her nephew had introduced the young man as. Lupin, not Potter. Lupin. Lu-pi-n.
Another Monday came and during breakfast, a letter landed in front of Harry, almost splashing his tea all over his scrambled eggs. Harry fished the letter up from his cup and used magic to dry it off while Teddy shrugged and poured him a new cup.
“Hello, what happened? Did Crabbe and those Slytherin students attack you?”
Molly blinked, to her great surprise, she felt tears form and fall down her cheeks. “You… You think that I have been good to you?”
I love El, and I do not think I can ever stop.
“In the mass immigration, mages travelled to America as well, hoping for better lives where they were not bound by ideals about blood, as enforced by the aristocratic upper class. In other words, they were supposed to be free in America, free from the societally enforced blood ideals of Britain, but the problem came in the form of organising themselves into an actual community. What ended up happening was that no magic organisation could protect the newly immigrated mages, and none of the groups that managed to establish themselves were capable of reaching across all the states.”
“I don’t know…” Pat whispered into her knees. “I don’t know. He has done so much for me, and we’ve been dating for years by now. I think I love him still, but whenever we are together, I don’t feel like he is seeing me. I just feel like some doll for him to squeeze and it’s never about me, or even us, just him. I know that he is doing something impossibly dangerous, and the least I should do is support him. He’s even denying other people a relationship with him for my sake, but I’m still not satisfied with just being physical. He used to do so much for my mind, and now I feel like just a body for him.”
Someone in the group rambled on about how the entrance to the Department of Mysteries was actually a magical portal which led to the real department, which was located somewhere far away from London and deep underground. It was evidently designed so that the mysterious vortex within the ancient arch would not destroy London should it malfunction in any manner. The magic was apparently utterly unknown, and the purpose of it had been studied before too many losses had rendered the arch vortex too costly to experiment with. Thus, it simply remained, guarded by the Department of Mysteries which later came to host more than just the ancient arch and the inconceivable vortex of magic.
Lastly, Sirius stepped forward once more, yet again adding his blood to the door to lock it to him as well. The ritual was complete, and the magic circle shone brighter before slowly dimming until there was nothing left of the chalk marks upon the door.
“That was around the time when Remus approached me, much akin to a frightened mutt. He wanted to plead with me to not report him and assure him of being thrown out of Hogwarts. I had considered it, but it was Black I… I mean Potter, who I wanted my revenge upon, should I pursue vengeance. Yet the price for that vengeance would have come at the cost of an innocent minority. Thus, I used my knowledge as leverage, and extorted your father to tell me all about his condition. I do not think I ever intended to tell anyone about him, but I cannot quite remember.”
I feel guilty as I hug him, despite it being him who initiated the hug. It has nothing to do with the madness which the Muggle world had taught him, and nothing to do with the accusations. I feel guilty, and I know it, because I am broken, and I was broken before I chose to adopt a child. I haven't stopped being broken because I adopted a child.
“Greyback,” the Dark Lord spoke. “Where are my Death Eaters?”
When he had returned home to the little Muggle apartment which he had bought for cheap money, he was surprised to get a phone call. Bill didn’t use the phone which had been included in the apartment since the previous resident’s departure. Unfortunately, there was only one person who knew this number. Bill picked up with a heavy heart.
“I understand now… I really feel like I’ve gotten all the answers to what I have been pondering unsuccessfully on my own,” Harry attempted to formulate himself once more. “I know what I have to do, I have to speak to Draco. I can’t just watch him leave like this, I have to reach out to him.”
Pat let out a weak, shaking breath as she settled against the other student’s chest, closing her eyes as she attempted to breathe steadily once more. It was not as easy as it usually was, but it was all the more pleasant to have her nose filled with a scent which she didn’t connect to anxiety of physical closeness.
“Oh, that girl isn’t going to stay long if she won’t let Ron have friends,” Ginny snorted and crossed her arms over her chest. “That is just plain unhealthy.”
Harry simply nodded to show that he had understood and appreciated the information. “What were you and Ginny fighting about?”
Louis and Lestat ran around the group hug, attempting to find their way inside the sacred circle, and possibly lick some faces as a bonus. They attempted this by means of barking and every now and then attempting to push their long snouts into the mix of limbs.
A nudge and a grin told the blonde that the other man wanted his attention, so he looked towards the picture which Harry was trying to show him. With a strained expression, Draco looked, finding a picture of Arthur Weasley. It took him a little while to realize what Weasley he was looking at, but upon realizing who was smiling back at him from inside the picture, the former Slytherin groaned. He looked over at the other, before reaching out to pinch his nose. When Harry opened his mouth to object, Draco pushed the remains of the cookie into his lover’s mouth.
“...You are… hiding your… left arm?” She mumbled then.
Classes resumed the next day, with an additional class added for the sixth year students, namely Apparition. The classes were announced the very same day, and were never held the same weekday or even at the same time of day, since the apparition protection spells had to be temporarily removed from parts of the school to allow the students to practice. With the political climate as it was, the school could not take the risk of anyone having the chance to tell anyone outside of Hogwarts about the protection spells being lifted. Thus, everyone was inconvenienced for the sake of keeping the students, as well as the rest of the school, safe. Harry didn’t like not being able to plan his days and schedule, but he understood why the Hogwarts Board of Governors had chosen to adapt this strategy, rather than make the class a reliably recurring one.
“Why not? They did to me when I was a brat.” Greyback sat up, quick as the beast he was, and captured Pettigrew around the waist, yanking him down into the sofa and holding him stuck. He evidently enjoyed frightening the man and had made it a personal game of how far he could frighten the other before the animagus turned into a rat and ran away. “I like it when you squirm.” He more or less growled into the frightened servant's ear as Pettigrew became very still within his grip.
“Will I have a mum?” he asks, looking at my fingers to search for a ring.
“Nah,” Colin shifted. “I’m actually a little flattered. You know I like you, and kissing you was really, really nice. If you hadn’t been, pardon my honesty, replacing somebody else with me, that kiss would have been kind of perfect.”
“Oh, so that meat hasn’t been killed? It just died on its own for your convenience?” Goyle scoffed.
“I’m not going to be able to get out of here for a while, but I’ll do that as soon as I get the chance.” Filch shrugged. “I know sidepaths, I can get there without letting Umbridge or that real troll which is definitely there, know.” The janitor hadn’t believed them in the least with their troll ruse, that much was evident.
Unknowingly, she chose the same answer as her son, to speak rather than remain silent.
“I shall have to refrain, as I believe them to be safer if they remain unnamed, and without mention. Neither of the two of them are Muggle-born or involved in all this,” Severus insisted.
Only when they exited the shop, both carrying their bouquets, did Draco come to notice that people were looking at them. He was a little nervous that his scarf had slipped, but nothing was out of order. After some confusion, he settled on it probably just being Harry Potter whom they were looking at.
“It wasn’t important,” she waved her hand to try and get the other to drop the subject.
“If you would be willing to host some people, we could all celebrate together at your manor, meaning that you would not have to be alone this winter. With Lucius absent, I believe that it is the least I could offer you as a friend. The reason I ask you to serve as the host is because you have the ability to based on the size of your estate, and because I do not believe that the Burrow would suit you.” Remus held his breath as the line went very silent in his hand. He could hear his own heart beat inside his ears while he waited for any manner of response from Narcissa.
“It’s not enchanted,” Harry turned towards his friends with a smile, showing them the object. “We should go and destroy it right away, could someone open the door for me?”
“In summary: any group found engaging in extra curricular activity similar to those of a club, whose membership number passes five people, will be given immediate detention for every student. Repeat offenders risk being expelled from Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry.” She ended her summary with a smile as she lowered her wand from her throat as the room was once again buzzing, but not overpowering her.
What Hermione minded was the fact that Lavender Brown would sometimes look at her like she had won something while Hermione had lost. Harry had seen her grin in a smug manner before she pulled Ron into a kiss, or sometimes even called him cutesy names very loudly in front of Hermione specifically, as if she was attempting to make her jealous. She was seemingly behaving like it in front of other women too, or even couples, but Hermione appeared to be the one she truly wanted to keep jealous of her.
Arthur Weasley loved Muggles and all things and inventions belonging to Muggles. Everyone knew that. It was almost an obsession, or rather, quite the obsession. Everyone knew that.
Bill smiled at the older man. The notorious mass murdered Sirius Black appeared to actually be a rather nice guy, all things considered. “Sure, I would like that. Will you put on some trousers?” He added, making sure to let the other know that he was not bothered, but would like the other to maybe cover up a little bit so as to not be distracting.
The thought of being stuck with Umbridge until she had forced him to write what she wanted to hear was terrifying to Harry, and he struggled to even see the paper properly through his pounding anxiety. It had been a lot less scary last term where he had been saved from her detention after one time, but now that she was the Headmistress, it was entirely different.
Not too early before the winter holiday break, Draco received a letter from his mother, which informed him of the fact that Malfoy Manor would be hosting an array of people during the holidays that year.
,” she finally concluded.
“Yes, that would be my dad, sir,” Harry straightened up as a small, prideful smile spread over his lips. For the first time in a really long time, Harry felt like himself, even if he enforced the body language of the aristocrats he generally modelled Harry Potter after. “Is there something you’d like to know about my dad’s condition? I could tell you all there is to know.”
“You’re still a human.” Draco commented, chuckling as Harry’s hair now tickled his sides, through his shirt.
The backside of his head was rumored to be scarred to look suspiciously like a face, with two eyes, a nose and some manner of grotesque, wide mouth underneath them, shaped entirely out of loose skin. However, Quirrell always wore a red beanie hat which he had found abandoned somewhere to keep anyone from knowing what was actually hiding upon the back of his head. Due to his various injuries, Quirrell was prone to seizures and attacks which rendered him completely immobile and sometimes frothing.
“Yeah?” Harry’s face appeared above them, as he had heard the call and misunderstood who was being called for.
“So in summary, we kind of both want to date the other, but now isn't the best of times?” Colin looked at Harry’s face as he asked.
“The last thing I want is more duties to attend to after what happened last year.” Harry sighed, trying very hard to not think about the events which had tired him out so very thoroughly. “I just want to keep my head down and focus on the OWL exams. Dad was a Prefect back in his days though, but of course that doesn’t mean that I am destined to become one.” He chuckled to himself, imagining his dad with the Prefect badge, tall, insecure and unfocused. He knew that his dad had definitely been good for the position, but Harry himself really didn’t want to have those responsibilities on top of his own unstable mental health.
She must hate Death Eaters and the Dark Lord’s followers immensely. Enough to want all of them to die to fulfill her desire for vengeance.
“And you should be the current Gryffindor Quidditch captain, Ginevra?” He looked at her in the same manner a grandfather looks to his granddaughter, using her name as if he had known it all his life.
Draco had to sit down and rest after the burial, and his mother accompanied him back to the church as Harry was called by his father to greet the unfamiliar man and his wife.
The girlfriend of the Death Eater scoffed, “Malfoy is considered as much of a blood traitor as the Weasleys at this point.” She realised too late what she had confessed to and quickly sat up, her expression twisting into one which was mixed with fear, alarm and anger. She only dared glancing towards Ngo-Kwang before she almost bolted for the door.
Lucius shifted inside of the dark and slowly scooted over to the edge of the darkness, where a little bit of light fell upon him from the torches in the hallway. Arthur could not make out all of his features, but he recognised the general clothing which Malfoy favored, as well as his silvery hair and his nose. Some jewellery glittered in the flickering flames, further emphasising that the other truly was Lucius Malfoy. He was seated upon the cold floor, leaning his upper body and head against one of the walls while panting softly from pain. Both his arms were laced around his middle, which he held as if he was in great discomfort.
Missy commented.
The two of them reached Professor Slughorn’s office, upon which Neville knocked on the door and spoke up. They were quickly let inside by the voice of the Potions Master, who had indeed expected Neville to return. However, he had not expected Harry, judging by the expression on his face.
Yet his hand is not only warm, as it fills me with warmth. I feel the fingers close around mine, and I see the night sky and the day sky settle upon my red, slightly swollen face. I can feel things for him which I have never felt before as they settle in my stomach and heats me up more effectively than any fire possibly could. I am aware that I am thinking this because he did not react as most around me have, and is even willing to touch me after finding out the truth about my useless self. His hand warms something within me that I did not know was ever frozen.
“May I accompany you to your office?” Harry asked, but inside his head, he asked a different question.
Harry generally didn’t like it when people took liberties with other’s names and titles. He especially didn’t enjoy it when people did it with his name, but it was within his best interest to please the man, while Ginny had signed up for nothing of the sort.
“How- I mean, hello.” Andromeda almost responded with the word ‘howdy’, which would likely have finished her sister off there and then out of unfiltered shock.
Remus glanced towards his partner, silently asking if Sirius’ claim aligned with what he had done yesterday. To his surprise, Severus appeared somewhat bewildered. Whatever it was that Sirius had needed to do, it had evidently been something important or at the very least unexpected, or Severus would not have lost control over his usually well maintained expressions.
“Good morning, my dear students. As this is my first day, I will introduce myself once more: I am Professor Umbridge, former Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic, and current Education Inspector here at Hogwarts. Some of you already know me through your work with the Disciplinary Committee. I have been tasked with your education by the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge himself, and I very much intend to deliver. Yet before I begin your education for the day, I need to take attendance.” She raised her clipboard and smiled at them, like a picture perfect photograph which didn’t look real or comfortable outside of that picture.
“Thank you for lending me the book about ancient Persian potion brewing as well, it will be an interesting read. I would thank Potter for it, but he doesn’t appear too keen to speak with me at the moment.” Severus glanced upwards as well.
There came a loud noise from the forest ahead of her, as something broke through the bushes, panting heavily. Pat hid behind a tree but she didn’t need to bother, as the beast proved to be a wrinkly old dog and a Slytherin student whom she knew well.
Luna clapped her hands together, mimicking Harry. “That is better than capturing a Squonk,” she agreed.
“Aren’t you sweet?” Draco approached Harry where he stood and gently grabbed his hips, pulling him closer to himself.
The sound of the door interrupted the conversation, as it somewhat flew open before the person who opened the door managed to catch it. “Ah d…-hmn. Sorry about that, these doors are rather flimsier than I’m used to…” Sirius Potter excused himself to Draco, his expression akin to a shamed dog’s.
Draco assumed it to be related to his mother, but he didn’t enjoy speculating without any evidence to support said speculations. He had learned that that was not a generally working strategy when he was eleven and had never reverted back to assuming that it was.
As a secondary result, Remus had found himself rather heavily injured by the moon crazed beast, and he had been forced to use one of the emergency healing potions which Severus had brewed for him when they realised that circumstances in life were yet again stealing them apart from the other. Further assistance from Molly Weasley had saved him from gaining a new collection of scars, as she had come to the grim old place right away when Remus had called her on the phone and asked for help. He was endlessly thankful for the woman’s assistance as she cleaned and bandaged what could be cleaned and bandaged up, and cared for him during the days leading up to the meeting.
A troubled look blooms upon my future child’s face and his grip becomes harder upon my hands. “Wait… wait, how do I know you will come back? You might be lying to me… and you might never come back. You could leave me like my parents did and… and then… Then I…” The boy is having another breakdown as happiness is replaced by fear.
“Mr. Weasley!”
Sirius Potter was dressed in clothes which suited the environment they were in, but which also appeared ruffled and styled enough to reflect his personality, rather than a style of fashion. The wine red dress shirt was open far enough to reveal a set of tattoos down his chest, and the sleeves had been tidily rolled up to reveal a set of tattoos in the form of alchemical symbols and runes which George recognised but couldn’t place a meaning too. He also noticed that the man appeared to be rather scarred, as he could see them upon his arms and a little on the chest. The contrast between his expensive clothes and the way Potter made them appear more casual with his tattoos and scars made the man comparatively but passively physically appealing to George, which made it somewhat easier to not be frightened by him.
, which he gave to me as a very late birthday present.
It is funny, being a Hufflepuff supposedly means that one is expected to be open and friendly towards everyone. Such a description has never really applied to me. It is not that I am rejecting everyone around me, but I do not strive for, or even feel the need of their company, or their attention for that matter, to feel accomplished.
Bill wasn’t just absent.
Harry hadn’t exactly gotten over Cedric Diggory’s death, as guilt and nightmares, as well as
Remus hoped that the removal of the portrait would help Sirius feel more comfortable in his current home. He appeared to have improved significantly just by the appearance of another person, which made Remus all the more hopeful that his old friend’s anxieties could be soothed.
Yet Arthur did not get up from the couch.
Something that he hadn’t quite expected was how much he hadn’t liked being back in his family home, surrounded by people who all very much resembled one another. Bill was reminded of the terror he had once felt in losing his own individuality amongst a sea of the beings which were ‘Weasley,’ and he recalled why he had fled to Egypt to be allowed some manner of self. He could only imagine how much worse his younger brothers must feel in regards to that. At least Bill had been the first. They would always be ‘the younger Weasley.’
A soft stroking all but jolted Harry awake as he sat up so quickly that he almost fell off his chair. His butt ached from the pain of having fallen asleep upon a wooden chair, and his back and arms were not quite fine after his uncomfortable sleeping position against the hospital bed, but all of that was forgotten as he spotted Draco’s pale face as he was sitting up in his bed.
“How about you try one?” Colin huffed back as he nonetheless approached the blue door and gave the handle a careful thug. It was locked as well.
Filch noticed that Harry was looking at him, causing him to snort and pull his clothes tighter around himself, as a displeased expression deepened the lines in his face. “What are you looking at, brat?” Filch muttered.
“Were you speaking about Weasley earlier?” Blaise said.
In hindsight, it would become easy to connect Umbridge’s paranoia to that once incident, but as it was happening, not even she might have realised the true source for her exceedingly and rising stress.
Meanwhile, Dobby had pulled a glove off his hand and was absently snapping his fingers as a frown had formed on his face. He appeared to be thinking about something. With each snap of his fingers, silvery sparks softly appeared and fell towards the path, disappearing before they reached the earth. Then, Dobby raised his hand and snapped his fingers in a loud snap which caused some bird to stir in the trees.
Thus, the two boyfriends found themselves back at Sirius’ teenage room, with Draco going through the closet once more. He pulled out everything which he felt was even remotely acceptable, gathering them upon the red covers of the bed. He quickly gathered a rather impressive pile of clothes while Harry sat back upon the drawer which had previously hosted the terrarium. Harry did his best to look at his boyfriend and not the pictures surrounding them.
“This is… so much text…” Colin groaned as he sat back, allowing himself to lean back on the chair, and stare up at the ceiling.
Thus, Pat sneaked into the side corridor and walked soundlessly up the stairs, glancing behind her with a throbbing heartbeat in her ears to assure herself that nobody had noticed. She felt uncomfortable with everything, but at the very least, she could breathe a little easier as she exited Vince’s shadow. Not to mention that she needed to confirm her suspicions about the owner of the curiously familiar noise.
Professor Snape turned towards him, and read the teenager’s mind in an instant. “Draco, you are in fact the one who is not being reasonable. I have shared many things with you two over the years, but as I knew that nothing would come out of their investigation of me, I had no reason to cause additional worry for the two of you. Whatever you feel on the subject does not give you immediate access to the events which are unfolding in my life.” He was not scolding his godson, but his words nonetheless made Draco’s cheeks heat slightly with embarrassment.
I do not have the heart to reject his recommendation. “Certainly, what do you suggest?”
The two men exchanged glances, Harry got the impression that his dad had asked the mind reader a question inside his own head, which he was correct about. The Potions Professor gestured for the Defense against the Dark Arts Professor to speak, as this was his teaching subject, not Professor Snape’s.
“I think I… I really needed this. A lot. Thanks.” George sighed, admitting to himself that he had needed the distraction.
Umbridge glared at Draco, falling for his provocation as if it had actually been handled with a higher, far more honed amount of manipulation. “You believe me incapable of handling a stupid old troll? I am more than just a simple academic witch, you foolish children.”
Andromeda Tonk moved her head, throwing her long, brown hair away from her face and shoulder, freeing her vision from any obstruction. She closed her eyes and breathed in the scent of snow and fresh air before she allowed herself to be swallowed up by the building.
Umbridge appeared ready to tear her own hair out. “Stop lying and tell me the truth!”
“No. He gave me this scar, as everyone knows, but his pureblood ideology is as ignorant and foolish as your Muggle-born discrimination ideas. I would never follow him. May I leave now?” Harry stood up without her permission and walked towards the door before she recovered enough to stop him.
“I brought the bedding and her food bowls, but the rest of the things do seem to be here. Look at this here.” Draco knelt before the terrarium and pointed at a thermometer.
“Do you wanna drink with me?” Sirius didn’t care about speaking properly. He was a little too tired to truly put in the effort.
Remus had warned him. His dad had told him all of this already when Harry was at the age of eleven.
The former Death Eater chuckled weakly and allowed himself to walk closer to his partner, holding on tightly to his hand in response. “How reassuring.” Severus smiled as he met Remus’ gaze.
“I’ll stay inside then, it appears rather cold outside.” Harry declined once he had managed to recover from his almost laughing fit.
Only Lucius refused to consider the action as good, or even acceptable. The next time the two of them met, Lucius acted as if he had never seen Arthur, much less spoken to him. He used the very same insults as he had before, and it hurt far more than Arthur was willing to accept for many years to come. He blamed his anger and upset towards Lucius with the idea that the other had insulted him when he had been kind, although Arthur himself knew that he was only upset because he had hoped that the other would extend the courtesy of a thank you to him for his efforts.
Kreacher’s upper lip twitched slightly at Harry’s open, honest excitement. “Kreacher has been fine. What do you need hi-, me... for?”
“Yet, sir… Kreacher has begun to realise that, maybe, a lot of what the child is lays in the success or failure of their parents. Master Regulus was the boy he was because his parents failed him, as is Master Sirius. Mistress Narcissa is accomplished because she was beloved by her parents, while you, sir, succeeded despite not being beloved. The Master whom Kreacher loved, the child who came into his life like the memory of a ghost… They are not the same. It is… hard for Kreacher to think of them as different, but one was raised with love. Real love. Not what the Madam showed her children.” Kreacher stopped to take a shaking breath as he carefully laced his long fingers around the teacup, staring deep into the reflection within it as if it could allow him to face his own memories.
Harry turned towards the other young man, his hand raised to knock on the door and his expression confused but not angry. Slowly, a smile spread over Harry’s lips and he nodded at the teenager who was nothing like the person who Crabbe had become.
the basilisk appeared to sigh, but she was not entirely displeased.
Arthur snorted with laughter, “we’re not very good at this, are we?”
Harry and Draco gazed at one another before Draco turned back to Colin with a patient and somewhat excited look in his eyes. “Have you ever heard of magic circuits?”
Upon Hermione’s suggestion, Ron realised that he could in fact give points to people, rather than remove them. Whenever he heard someone unjustly remove points from another House or person, Ron would simply add them back. The Prefects and the Disciplinary Committee couldn’t remove more than a total of ten points at any given time, so Ron could not grant the Houses a hundred points each and be done with it, but he valiantly continued to add points whenever he could. He had to balance giving points so that nobody would expressively notice that Gryffindor was receiving points and not simply losing them.
If there was any teacher who deserved to be replaced by someone who knew what they were teaching about, it was definitely Professor Binns, although Hermione didn’t dare saying that out loud to her friends. Maybe one day, but not as of currently.
As Ron realised that Draco was somewhere above him, he appeared distracted, and thus didn’t notice when another of the Slytherin players came rushing towards him soon after with the Quaffle in her hand. One of the Gryffindor Beaters noticed where Ron failed to, and he swung his club to send one of the Bludgers towards her. She spun in the air, avoiding the actual dangerous call but she had to chance her goal on a rather careless yet strong trust of the ball. Her movement caused it to spin and it hit the goal ring on the side, going over it, and straight towards Draco who had not yet thought to remove himself from the immediate danger which he was in close to a goal post.
“Nope, that’s my dad’s partner,” Lupin didn’t appear bothered in the least to have been mistaken for the black haired man’s child. In fact, it seemed to highly amuse him.
“With the stars as the symbol of all mages upon this earth, we wish you happiness.” A black ribbon appeared and gently secured itself with the other two, creating a total of three different ribbons which tied Bill and Fleur together.
I’m so very selfish to choose myself and El before my own son.
“To make dad less scared.” Harry crossed his arms over his chest, trying to push his anger somewhere where it couldn’t do any harm. “You’ve said it yourself, a werewolf is only dangerous to humans and people. If I was able to transform into an animagus, that would be a huge relief to my dad. Not to mention, I could even be with him during the full moon if I wanted to, and I’ve been wanting that since I was a child.”
“I do believe that most rituals of this nature require equal blood to the body which is being created, sometimes more as some may be damaged or go lost in the process. The entirety of your blood would not have been enough for a fully grown man, and based on the fact that we do not currently know what kind of spell Lily Potter used to save your life when you were but a baby, it could be that your blood itself would have rejected him. The ritual likely used the blood of animals, rather than humans, as the first Killing Curse which hit Mr. Diggory was not lethal. This suggests that the caster did not have the ability to kill another human being. Ergo, the ritual must have employed mostly animal blood rather than human blood.”
Colin was speaking a lot about what he had done that summer, and he was especially talking about his younger brother Dennis Creevy. Dennis suffered from rheumatism and had since he was rather young. After the previous winter break, Dennis had elected to study at a Muggle school close to home, rather than at the distance of Hogwarts. Colin was particularly excited because his brother had discovered swimming during the summer. More than that, he was good at it. Yet Colin was more excited about the service dog which his brother had gotten, and he was telling his mostly Pureblooded mage friends all about how amazing the dog was.
“You don’t have to worry, I’m not suicidal, that really has passed. Yet I have been thinking about the fact that we are only here today because Regulus was thoughtful enough to include me in his will, against mother's expressed desires and opinions too. I might be Harry’s godfather, but unless I write that into my will, it is more likely that the Black family fortune will be confiscated by the Ministry of Magic, and that is the last thing I want. Maybe if they paid people like Arthur better, but they don’t, so I don’t trust them.” Sirius finished his derailing with a huff which sounded distinctly dog-like.
He felt slightly uncomfortable to be so very focused on Draco. Maybe even obsessed. Harry was slightly scared that he was becoming as captivatingly consumed with Draco as Albus was with El. He was frightened that he was making the same mistakes but if… If he knew the dangers and risks of committing those mistakes, then maybe he could avoid them. Perhaps Albus could help Harry become better than that, and assist him in rebuilding a good, healthy relationship with his best friend, rather than attempt to repair a relationship as boyfriends, since Draco might not even want that.
Colin leaned his head to the side and grinned in a manner which Harry found immensely relieving and comforting. Harry allowed himself to breathe a few times, using the technique he had learned from Luna. It helped him calm down at last.
“Yes?” the blonde wizard hadn’t turned away from the wall, he was remaining there, studying the shadows.
Severus Snape was recognisable, even if the boy wasn’t quite like the man whom Harry knew in his later years. However, Harry recognised the dark hair and the black eyes, as well as the crooked nose and the mouth which simply would not be able to smile unless someone tricked it to. It was almost bizarre to know that Severus had once been the same age as Harry, yet it was of course obvious that he had. Harry realised with great joy that he was looking at the young man who his dad had fallen in love with when they were still in school. This was the Severus whom Remus had dated, and the person who he had never quite been able to forget hurting, even after so many years. Even if Harry wasn’t attracted to the young Severus in the photograph, he noticed with some slight satisfaction that he could see some of what his dad had likely appreciated about the young wizard.
“Revolution!” Agreed both Ron and Dobby, raising their hands in return.
That day,
Ron avoided their gazes as he stared upon his own hands, looking at the scars upon his fingertips. “Lately… I’ve been feeling really weird about it all. I somehow started to compare her to Tom, which is weird, I know!” he added hastily. “Since he’s not, I mean, since he was the Dark Lord and everything like that, but I… I realised that I felt like Tom was more respectful of my boundaries than she is. And he was trying to make me kill all the innocent Muggle-borns in the bloody castle!” Ron realised that he had raised his voice and quickly placed a hand over his mouth, still avoiding their gazes.
The woman yelled something before she kicked her sister’s husband and then rushed to try and grab some Floo Powder so that she too, could leave the same way her husband and his husband had disappeared.
When the immediate material demand having been dealt with, Harry turned towards the person in the chair. He had already hugged the man once, so he did it again, sternly reminding himself that Severus was almost his step-dad and being unable to hug him was probably more curious than not daring to. Thus, in quite the werewolf-like fashion, Severus was hugged by the far smaller, and not so much werewolf, son of a werewolf. He blinked at the action before he gave in and allowed himself to hug Harry back, exchanging a familiar embrace with one another. A real one, which Severus evidently desperately needed.
Percy was always telling them what to do, yet he had always been the one to patch them up when they were hurt, the one to read them bedtime stories, and when Percy had gone to Hogwarts, he brought back the most wonderful stories, just for them. Not for Ron or Ginny, but for them. Percy’s obsession with looking good, as the twins called it, had made him distant, especially since he had become a Prefect and decided to hound his little brothers with things like ‘order’ and ‘rules.’ Nonetheless, he was still good old Percy, and his enforced rules didn’t actually apply to the twins. Maybe to everyone else, but not them.
Both of them were very aware that Harry was not Kreacher’s Master, and that he was not very likely to ever be, but they both elected to overlook that to allow Kreacher the comfort of not feeling like he was pushing and ignoring his own boundaries as a servant.
Harry was handed an overall black garment. Walpurga Black might have taken her name to be a literal instruction for how she was expected to dress, as her wardrobe had consisted of nothing but ‘mourning garb,’ as Draco had called her clothes with some distaste. He did so completely forgetting that he and Lucius Malfoy almost only dressed in black as well. Or perhaps he was referring to something else. Harry had not actually asked. It hadn’t seemed important at the time.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. After some silence, he spoke up once more. “Is it odd that it doesn’t feel strange to me that we will be family?” Harry smiled to himself as he studied the ground between him and his to be stepdad. “It almost feels like we already are, since you’ve been with dad for so long, as well as here for me in school.” He dared to aim a quick glance at the other man’s face but then abandoned the act by averting his gaze once more. “I might just be sentimental…” he added in a mumble.
Albus smiled weakly as he placed the necklace around his own neck. The smile appeared both joyous and miserable at once as he looked down upon his and El’s mixed blood.
Teddy did something similar to Hermione and busied himself by his workbench. He had realised that without Ron and without George, he was somewhat lonely as he and Hermione didn’t have much to talk about, and Harry was busy with pushing himself academically to not have to think about the lack of Draco in his surroundings.
Teddy excitedly told his group of friends that they were currently working on a pill for growing beards, which he himself wanted to use for aesthetic reasons rather than jokes.
“While it pains me to say, few things have proven as certain and as recurring as the fact that you have not been as safe as you should be at Hogwarts, Harry.” The old wizard sighed as he spoke, that almost ancient sadness appearing upon his face yet again, causing the lines of wrinkles to appear deeper and less friendlier. “As the situation currently is, you might not be safe in your dormitory. You might not be safe in any dormitory.”
Perhaps… Perhaps a child could save me.
Pat was struck with how much Lavender was trying to convince herself rather than she was insulting Pat or complaining about her. It was rather surprising to the Slytherin student that she really didn’t care about the defamation of her character as much as she was displeased with the fact that Lavender was pretending that Pat’s relationship was perfect. It was especially annoying since Pat had just forced herself to run away from her boyfriend because she was too scared of what Vince might do or say if he was actually upset with her. Lavender had no idea about Pat’s anxiety, fear and slow descent into dehumanisation for the sake of remaining with someone she feared too much to break up with. Lavender called it all ‘love’, and pretended that everything was fine and good. That made Pat rather angry.
“Sir,” Percy said, “there has been a break out of Azkaban prison.” He was surprised with how breathless he sounded as he delivered his report. “The crisis council had summoned us, well, everyone who is still here and of note.”
Harry smiled before shaking his head, “you saved me too. Thank you for that. It was awfully kind of you.”
Yet the two new teachers could not distract Harry’s mind from his fear of Umbridge and what she might do to him without Albus there to protect his rights as a student and human being. It was not that he was expecting her to curse or hurt him, yet Harry knew through experience that Umbridge was not the type of woman to adhere to someone else’s logic when she could enforce her own.
“I envy most people,” Harry sighed, only half joking.
“Everything I’ve said since I had your tea has been the truth.” Harry once more continued to tell the truth, like she demanded of him.
Harry was suffering from nightmares. In the beginning, they had been about Cedric Diggory, and then about the resurrection ritual which he had witnessed. However, after a month, it was becoming clear that there might be something more to Harry’s nightmares. He would wake up in a cold sweat, speaking about how he had felt like every muscle was on fire, as if he had never used them before. Yet most alarmingly, Harry said that he dreamt about being resurrected with painful clarity, as if it really had happened to him.
“I… I never… I never saw him as my father,” Severus appeared to be rambling slightly, which was entirely unusual for him. “I know how he saw me, but I never… I never wanted to… because I knew that he would leave. One day, he would leave. Well, he is leaving now and I don’t feel any better for having stayed away. In fact, I regret not having known him better. Why is that? How can that be? I… I tried so hard, why does it still hurt?”
“I really don’t get it…” Rom mumbled out the confession to Teddy as he rubbed his neck again, biting his lower lip as he sheepishly tried to comprehend the advice which Teddy gave him.
“I think I would like that. Will you show me like you did today?” He gestured towards the Pensieve with his hand.
His expression lights up as he sees his book, and he walks over to collect it. “Thank you, I thought library had taken it by accident.”
Andromeda finally breathed out when her tears began to yield to reason. She took a few deep breaths as her mind returned to the realisation that Narcissa appeared to have changed in more significant ways than simply losing track of her words. She could not believe it, yet a Muggle-born woman was wearing Narcissa’s first dress. It was irrefutable proof no matter how many times she looked.
“Different historians will tell you different versions of the same period of time,” the Professor continued, “some will claim he never killed anyone, while other records will state that he murdered all his supposed victims with his own hands. I do not personally know which one comes the closest to the truth, but I do know that he was ultimately recaptured by the efforts of Professor Dumbledore. I have seen this recapture referred to as many things, among those, a legendary wizard duel, or a fierce, brutal battle. Yet the Headmaster tells me that none of these are true claims.”
Unbeknownst to the Mistress of the house, Sirius Potter had left the premises to attend to a final matter which he might never have the chance to address unless he did it that day.
“It’s all my fault…” George heard himself whimper. He had no control over his voice, and the words could no longer be stopped by his will or his teeth. “It shouldn’t be like this. Me and Fred shouldn’t need you, we should be able to create an empire on our own, we should leave Hogwarts with explosions and fireworks, going out in a mad fight against the system or… something. I shouldn’t be here with you, he shouldn’t be with Angelina, it should just be us against the world, against everyone…” He sobbed once more, feeling how the tears began to run down his cheeks yet again.
“I understand, Madam.” Harry nodded along to her words, sympathetic to the changes which the portrait must have seen throughout its life.
“You do seem to have found yourself a pleasant not-secret boyfriend.” Draco settled back against Harry’s pillows, sighing weakly as he allowed himself to stretch out.
“What?” Umbridge blinked at Harry, raising both her eyebrows so high that she resembled an owl. “Your werewolf father is hurt? Where did you get that nonsense from? A letter?”
Luna nodded, or rather bobbed her head. “She is very keen on telling everyone, and doesn’t stand for anyone badmouthing you.”
“Oh bollox,” Ron muttered under his breath.
“Of course,” four voices spoke up as one, confirming without the shadow of a doubt that she was more than deserving of being noticed for her work. Harry was relieved that he didn’t have to speak up all on his own after having to fight with the realisation that he was searching for Draco in a place where he was not.
In hindsight, it would become easy to connect Umbridge’s paranoia to that once incident, but as it was happening, not even she might have realised the true source for her exceedingly and rising stress.
Draco couldn’t be there because the world didn’t allow him to be.
“Narcissa sent me a new tea blend which she wanted me to try, I could make some of that for us to try.” Remus nodded as he thought about his tea. “It has pieces of orange in it.”
--- Facts & Headcanons ---
Harry thought about it. It was evident that the memories were having an effect on him, bleeding into what was Harry and confusing his mind with that of Al… Albus. He related to the love and the longing for El through his own love and longing for Draco. Further, he also understood the complex relationship to feeling as if one’s partner had shaped him to the person he was currently. The relationship with Draco had been one which had been there for the last five and a half years, and the two of them had been in mortal danger more than once. Without it, and without Draco, Harry’s life was less. Less comfortable, less fun, and less than it had been with his best friend.
“Do you support Dumbledore over the Ministry of Magic?” She was becoming more and more agitated.
“Muggle,” Sirius corrected as his dad looked to him with a silent request for assistance.
“Professor, I’m not sure that your comments have anything to do with what we are worried about any longer.” Remus carefully steered the old wizard back to the actual topic at hand.
“Unlike Professor Dumbledore’s many mistakes, you were a teacher with the credentials to do what you were hired to do. The Headmaster did not only make mistakes in who he saved.” Severus smiled at him again, a small and reassuring smile.
“Indeed, I believe he is a perfect candidate for the school I represent,” I’ve done this many times. The people at the orphanages usually have the same reactions to magical children. ‘They are strange,’ ‘the other children are scared of them,’ ‘you have to mind, sir, curious things are happening with that child!’ By now, I know what to say and how to express myself to make the Muggle caretakers find me less frightening. Seeing as this is a nun and a religious orphanage, it is likely that young Tom Riddle is seen as some manner of monster, devil, or satanic offspring to the well meaning but ultimately ignorant nuns.
Harry nodded, “yes. I’ll be the communicator between you, and my friends will assist Draco in whatever way we can in the meantime so that the Death Eaters don’t hurt Draco or his family.”
The handsome young man halted himself and turned back towards Harry, raising a polite but not displeased eyebrow to question what he wanted.
Harry and Colin said goodbye to one another in the entrance hall after they had dinner together with Hermione and Neville. The two headed in different directions, yet both thought the same thing, namely that leaving the other felt odd to them both after being together all day.
Next to the Dark Lord stood Bellatrix Lestrange, who was looking down at the people, following her sister with her cruel gaze as Narcissa Malfoy pushed through the crowd to reach her husband, whom she had spotted from up on the balcony.
He knocked on the door and entered, finding a somewhat sleepy and unfocused Minister of Magic coming out from his impromptu bedroom while smoothing his hair back. Percy walked straight up to him and handed him the list of names and the scarlet colored summoning to the crisis council.
Remus shut his mouth as he was stopped from asking his question in the first place. He sighed and scratched his scalp with a disgruntled noise. “I feel… so powerless. I couldn’t do anything about his feelings for Sirius but reprimand him for them, and now he’s stuck in the arms of a monster instead? It’s… I don’t… I know Sirius wants me, I mean, wanted me to hate him but I…”
Thus it came to be that the two of them moved Quirrell’s rather few possessions into Peter’s room, and then returned to the kitchen to find the untouched pies. They would have to share beds but to have a bed for oneself was a rare thing among the refugees, and sharing one was preferable to the many mattresses which made up most people’s living accommodations. Seeing as Peter was risking himself and his safety every day out in the woods to guide refugees or remove Aurors, he had been given a small servant room with a bed of his own. It would be a bit of a tight squeeze since Quirrell was by no means short, but Peter didn’t hate the thought of hugging or being hugged in his sleep. At least not by somebody harmless. As for the Professor, he had shared his very body with the Dark Lord, and Azkaban had left him longing for any kind of human contact.
Arthur flinched before he turned redder than Molly had ever seen him before. “I don’t… I don’t love him! There is no… This wasn’t about being in love with him! I wasn’t… I couldn’t be, he’s been nothing but cruel to me.”
The reassurance helped Harry to dare wrapping his arms around his boyfriend in return, hugging him closely. “A-are you sure?” His words faltered slightly as he made himself speak.
Pat recognised the look of a person who wanted to flee from something that they found uncomfortable. Goyle’s gaze was fleeting, and he was most definitely not as busy as he attempted to make it seem. It appeared to Pat that he stayed with Hagrid because he didn’t want to return to the Slytherin common room and his dormitory. It appeared to her that he wanted to avoid them. Wanted to avoid the Dark Lord’s followers.
The door would not open.
“I’m skipping it,” Harry explained, “I’m trying to cut down in dairy products, it makes my stomach feel calmer.”
“Fine,” Vince grunted as he took a step back from the almost crying form of Harry Lupin. Potter Lupin-Potter. “Dry your face. You really are pathetic.” He more or less flung the words at Lupin, Potter, as he stepped away from the divider and joined Pat, Goyle and Montague. Following his lead, they all began to leave the hospital wing, none of them even glancing towards the collection of blood traitors and mudbloods who crowded Weasley’s bed like a den of insects. Or rather, like frightened people who bond together in safety from the cruel hunters that would separate them from one another because of political ideologies.
“Really?” Harry blinked, “how?”
Narcissa attempted to ignore her sister, but the man turned his attention towards her, focusing on her face as he spoke, without any particular emotion reflected within either his expression or his voice. “I am indeed not loyal to the Dark Lord, nor have I ever been, despite being sympathetic to his cause. The Lord himself is highly aware of this fact, and has not demanded my loyalty.”
It was immensely satisfying to hear Lucius stutter. Arthur grinned as he leaned his head in his hand, studying the other calmly with a smug smirk upon his lips. He was waiting for Lucius to recover, which was quite the sight.
Like some people, Vince used fancy language and supposedly calm reasoning to make himself appear more worthy of being listened to compared to someone who argued with emotions or was upset by the conversation. Only emotion was not a sign of weakness, but a sign that the person truly cared about the subject.
“...I will speak to the Headmaster right away,” I breathe deeply once more as I turn towards the door. If Hagrid really is who Tom claims that he is, then he must be stopped without delay. I cannot afford to doubt as I hurry away from the classroom, drawing my wand as I run down the halls of Hogwarts.
I cannot share it with Gellert, it is too painful since I know that I will wake up tomorrow and have to say goodbye.
“I am,” I assure the boy.
“I think Antonin Dolohov was a friend of my old man’s,” Teddy spoke up next. “I can easily imagine him taking Dolohov into protection, but I’m not sure grandma and grandpa would allow that. It still makes me want to report him as a possible hiding place, but the Ministry likely wouldn’t listen to me.”
George showed for Fred to lean in as he whispered in plan into his sibling’s ear.
Harry and Ron joined the group at last, and Teddy turned the book so that they too could compare the two pictures of the snake. Harry felt somewhat doubtful, just like his boyfriend, yet Ron approved of the conclusion.
She was upset with him for allowing those feelings for Lucius to turn two entire families against one another, but she blamed Lucius Malfoy equally for perpetuating it. The two men had done something which she couldn’t quite forgive, at least not at this moment.
Harry shrugged as he smiled at the now sitting Draco, “I didn’t in the beginning, but then I did and they felt comforting.”
It appeared that Umbridge was making a positive change for the school in terms of valuable education but also for the students of the Slytherin House. Her Disciplinary Committee was mostly consistent out of Slytherin students, which was unusual, as Ravenclaw students were often favored in anything related to academic or moral efforts. It appeared that Umbridge was taking a stance against the reputations of Slytherin students as outsiders, and placed them in a position of power which was unlike that most of them would have dreamt. Further, Umbridge made an effort to reward Slytherin students in an attempt to encourage good behavior. She quickly became very popular amongst the House as a person who understood them, and who wanted to help them achieve their goals in both life and academia. She was open and outspoken against the unfairness directed towards the House, an unfairness which was indeed there and probably had marked and damaged many children through the ages. Harry and his friends had personally experienced how much others could desire to hurt and isolate them based on their House alone, and it definitely wasn’t a bad thing for a teacher to actually make an outspoken effort against it, rather than let it pass without reacting to it.
After they finished speaking, they were rather timely asked by Remus if they could help him out in the kitchen, but it was but a polite request, not a demand. Afterwards followed a fun dinner, where all the emotional drain of the world was forgotten over a moment of kinship, friendship and fun.
“So a lot of players are struggling with some things in the ‘getting used to this’ department.” Ron continued.
“I don’t think that is any of your business, Mrs. Umbridge.” Once again, Harry ended up being somewhat more blunt than he would normally be.
It was a selfish wish, but seeing as Dobby was willing to visit, Draco hoped that the wish wasn’t actually one which would harm the elf.
“Sir, am I allowed to move your leg, I don’t think it should be in this direction.” Draco had walked around the large body and found that the earlier shift was causing the wounded leg to be pushed into the ground.
“It’s an order.” Harry didn’t hesitate to shut the other down. “I can’t accept that you live like this. I will help you clean a small room, if you find it uncomfortable to do it on your own. Isn’t there a servant’s room on this floor? We can prepare that for you. Sirius won’t be allowed in there. I will make you a sign if I have to.”
“Yes, or course I mean Granger!” Lavender huffed. “Even you with your boyfriend have probably seen the way that creepy girl drools after him.”
“Uh… I…” I give up as I simply point to the table next to me, showing him that the book is there.
Then Draco Malfoy, the loathed son of unpunished Death Eaters, risked himself to save Ron.
“Thanks,” Harry smiled back. “It’s fun to talk to you again. I feel like you’ve been very distant this year.”
“The new teacher is from the Ministry of Magic, her name is Dolores Umbridge, and she will very likely not diverge from the curriculum.” Hermione spoke up. “There has been plenty of discussion between the Board of Governors and the Department of Magical Education of how to improve Hogwarts and allow a more stable education for the students. Thus, Mrs. Umbridge has not only been hired as the Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, but she will also act as Educational Inspector, which means that she will evaluate the teachers and their practices so that they can improve, or in absolute worst case, be replaced.”
If a person like Sirius Black, the escaped convict, not Harry’s Dogfather, had been trying to kill a student, all that person would need to do was find some Floo Powder, and then walk straight into one of the common rooms and simply disappear the same way when their deeds were done. A Floo Powder connected chimney which bypassed all of the security of the common rooms, not to mention all of Hogwarts, allowed anyone to simply enter anywhere within the castle. It was far too large a security risk to logically allow, even without supposed murderers afoot. Thus, no chimney at Hogwarts was connected to the Network. If that had not been the case, then Harry imagined that most people wouldn’t take the Hogwarts Express, but simply arrive on their own accord.
“You’re not allowed to ask me why,” Molly attempted to sound stern. “I need you to answer, I don’t need you to question me.” She sounded so very cruel to her own ears, but she held fast. She had to do this, she had to ask and she had to demand. Her happiness was on the line. Her future was too.
The Lupin household had slowly come to terms with their situation as they hid from the world in their safe house. They had spoken to the Weasleys, and they were aware that the Order of the Phoenix was being re-established, but they didn’t really have anything to do with it. Remus wasn’t willing to return to the Order since he had Harry, who he of course didn’t have all those years ago. Neither was Severus especially involved, since he had not returned to his duties as a spy. Sirius wanted to join, but he was practically useless to the Order in his current state, as his human face was that of a mass murderer to the public, and his animal shape was known by the Death Eaters through Peter Pettigrew’s testimony. There was nothing he could do, and he was rather locked to his old family home.
Harry laughed as he played with his hair, trying to not feel ashamed for letting himself dream about the almost stereotypical idealised future in that whoever one fell for first would be one’s true dream partner who would remain there for the rest of one’s life. It was not that such a scenario couldn’t happen, with his dad and Severus being living evidence of such, it was simply that it was highly unlikely. People truly did change that much over the years, and the likelihood of two people changing together into people who still loved each other despite their differences was highly unlikely. It was nice to think that a relationship like Remus’ and Severus’ was not the exception, but the norm. However, being nice did not make it true. Harry liked to think that he was more reasonable than to believe the exception to be the rule.
