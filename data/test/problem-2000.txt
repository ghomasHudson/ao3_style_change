“S’pose I should’ve known you wouldn’t be a cheap date.”
This was what he needed to clear his head, a tiny reprieve of peace and quiet.
“‘Oh’?” Draco mocked. “You’ve had your little outburst over nothing, now you can’t even apologise?”
Not only was it all over his plate but the whole kitchen smelled of it too, which was only adding to the excellence, in Harry’s opinion. But Draco only shrugged dismissively before his shoulders set back into the perfect posture he always maintained at mealtimes.
He caught hold under each of Draco’s thighs, holding him steady for Harry to fuck him harder, fighting on a razor’s edge of control as he sped his thrusts. Draco slipped his hand between them to tug at his cock as Harry drove into him faster.
Returning to the dreary streets of London, they discovered that it had begun to rain whilst they were engaged in their meeting.
“Thanks,” he muttered.
When they reached the tree, Draco had looked as if he might say something as well, but instead, backed Harry firmly against its rough trunk, dampening the back of his shirt. The warmth of his breath puffed at Harry’s lips just before he was kissed quite lingeringly, laced with hints of wine, but overwhelmingly the spiced apple tart thing they’d been sharing a few minutes ago.
“I just think it’s time we…catch up on some things.”
every time the lift gate opened down the end of the room. It was a touch frustrating.
“Can I watch you come?” Harry breathed heavy and lust-thick. “You look so fucking hard.”
“Sorry. S’nothing important,” he lied in a mutter.
Harry wasn’t able to follow his exchange with their waiter in the slightest, but for some maddening reason it was quite attractive to hear. In such a way that he thought he might better understand why Draco liked it so much when he spoke Parseltongue.
Checking that they were even open, Harry pushed at the door and caught an older woman wiping down tables with a damp cloth just inside. She looked quite tired, and Harry sympathised.
Satisfied, he went on chasing honey trails, mouthing into the firm muscled warmth of his thigh, biting at a soft place he was growing particularly fond of before he was moving on to more sensitive bits. Draco’s bollocks obviously needed his attention badly, and Draco moaned heavily under an exceedingly determined tongue and the enthusiastic suction of Harry’s flushed lips.
“Will you be heading home now, then?”
Unfortunately, just as before, the extensive queue had drawn Dementors—six at least, floating ominous along the edges of a snaking line of people, sampling the misery on offer. The sight of them alone stopped Harry in his tracks, but it only took one wraith to sense their presence for all six to turn in their direction, bearing a biting edge of iciness as they approached.
Harry blushed.
Amused, Harry nudged up behind him to walk them in the direction of their own reflection. “I thought the hissing was your weakness, you’ve got a thing for mirrors too?”
His Charms lesson forgotten, Harry lowered his wand, gripping it tightly at his side—but his tension eased some in the wake of Draco’s palm sliding down his arm.
“I won’t forget,” he promised, and knew that he wouldn’t.
“You taste of firewhisky,” Draco remarked when they paused to breathe.
“I’m fine!” Harry sucked in a pained breath. “Stubbled my toe!”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Draco punctuated his question with a taunting writhe of hips and then he was pressing Harry’s cock into his prostate again with his own tight groan.
“Yes, please—only, I’d like to go up for a quick bath first, if that’s alright?”
He left it implied the consequences might apply to her, though in reality it was himself and Draco who would surely be paying that price. She didn’t need to know that now.
He also spotted Teddy Lupin in an enchanted pram, rolling just ahead of his grandmother on the road heading back toward the castle. Seeing him brought on a painful mix of emotions as well, and Harry knew he probably should’ve stopped to say hello to them but—
Malfoy laughed humourlessly. “Good luck with that job, Potter. You won’t find me skulking about on Muggle backstreets anytime soon. I must draw the line somewhere.”
He hadn’t seen Luna at all that day, and though he certainly didn’t blame her for not wanting to be there, Harry made a mental note to owl her to be sure she was alright.
His disdainful superiority and sharp iciness was back, contrasting several months spent watching him falling apart in a hot sort of ecstasy, it was only feeding into Harry’s temper. Glaring searchingly at an impassive grey stare, Harry wanted to see him feel something, as he was feeling—and beneath his escalating anger he was hurt, and very jealous.
Draco sighed in an overly-dramatic sort of way. “I’m trusting my future freedom to a Muggle social worker.”
After Ginny left that Tuesday, Harry’s guilt became slowly overtaken by a nervous-excited sort of anticipation that was hard to settle. The next morning, he would be meeting Draco in Muggle London, and together they would go and speak with Cassie. After months of work, the fate of the entire project might hang on the outcome of this one meeting. Given that, Harry thought his nerves were entirely justified.
me leave?”
“We’ll be headed to the surface through the visitor’s entrance today; our business is in Whitehall and Westminster, and that’ll drop us right where we need to be.”
“Or that,” Harry agreed a little too quickly. “Let’s go with that.”
“—no, I completely understand, it’s alright! I’m busy too, and I don’t expect you both to help me with everything I ever work on for the rest of our lives. Malfoy says he has the time to spare; I guess I’ll just need you both to trust me on this… and keep the whole bit about breaking the Secrecy Statutes to yourselves, you know. I’ve got good reasons, I promise.”
Harry swallowed a bit hard. Could he pretend he didn’t know what Malfoy was talking about when the very real evidence was racing through his nerves at that very moment? Was he yet willing to admit, even to himself, that he knew exactly what Malfoy was talking about? He wasn’t sure when his eyes had closed, but he could feel the ghost of those words just at the nape of his neck, their meaning washed over him, and it was all very distracting—most especially when Malfoy only continued with a knowing sort of smugness.
Draco was already undoing the belt on the suit he insisted on wearing. Harry couldn’t wait any longer either.
He was hard, had been for uncomfortably long, and it was starting to get under his skin. He was finding it very difficult to concentrate on his reading. By seven thirty-five it was too much, and he set aside his book and touched his wand to the board again.
“How are we doing this?” he shouted over the wind and several meters of air between them.
“Far as I know,” Harry shrugged.
Harry saw the dark dilation of arousal in his eyes just before he did. He lifted his hips up, but Harry caught at them and pushed him back down flat into the mattress before he was shifting over him to work the head of his cock between pale cheeks. It took him a breathless beat to find the right way to press in, and then Draco was moaning again.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Probably he should’ve told someone else where he was going—but Harry knew if he didn’t catch up to Malfoy soon, he would likely lose him, so he kept on.
“Yes, I know it’s very impressive. Part-library, part-study… Only try not to touch anything.”
“You cared,” Harry said and did his best to avoid grinning smugly. “You either cared or you pretended to care.”
They walked in careful silence a little longer, but as they passed through a narrow torchlit corridor Harry’s curiosity, and his stomach, overruled his nervousness.
Amusingly, Harry realised Draco had asked him that very same question when he’d first raised the matter. He could really only blame the peachy-cinnamon drinks, but he wasn’t going to admit that now.
“I’m not taking unnecessary risks—”
For simplicity’s sake, it was all one floor, the kitchen and sitting room interconnecting at the entrance to the tent, and further in was a bathroom, and two bedrooms.
He first owled Hermione, who (after checking with Ron) promised they could meet for dinner on Friday of that week.
Before he left that night Harry promised to stay in touch more, and to update Hermione on some of what he had been up to in London—though he knew he would need to be selective about revealing exactly how many Secrecy Statues they were planning on breaking.
“Er—shit. Run,” Harry blurted.
As he spoke, he worked out a neat outline on the lined page. “Here we are, then. There are three main areas we’ll need to discuss. Security, comfort, and the secrecy.”
When Harry pushed in deeper Draco’s smug attitude melted into a low, carnal sort of moan that shot through Harry like a hot arrow.
“I’m tired too,” Harry admitted.
“The less-than-good news is that we’ll probably need several days for the duration of casting time it’s going to take to get everything charmed and extended properly, protected and hidden, with the right illusion enchantments, the Taboo, and all the rest of it.”
He sent her back a large box of her favorite long-lasting sugar quills from Honeydukes for her trouble.
Harry faceplanted into a pillow, and immediately went back to sleep. He missed Draco watching him with an exhausted sort of disbelief before rolling out of bed to make a cinnamon hot chocolate.
When Harry made no move to leave, Malfoy breathed a put-upon sort of sigh.
They rocked together in a few blissful minutes of intensity, all it took for Harry's hardness to stir again inside encouraging tightness. The moment he could he started a shallow pace of thrusts, drawing out every sound he could from the man under him. It took much longer to get close, nearly an hour, but Harry obviously didn’t mind the devilishly pleasurable process of getting there—and when he was very close he pulled out.
And then Harry fucked him harder, taking his own pleasure from the tightening heat, and the tense shudder of the lithe body pressed beneath his own.
“He means to say, we could use your help with a strategy we’re working on for the, er, case. I know you offered to help last time but... well we would still need to require absolute secrecy. It’s very important, there could be some very serious legal ramifications if anyone finds out the nature of what we’re working on. But if you’re alright with that...”
“You could stay. I wouldn’t mind.”
“I’ll be careful. I promise.”
When Draco first stepped into Harry’s sitting room, he looked as if he expected a hoard of Weasley’s to descend upon him in righteous fury at any moment.
“D’you think if we’d had to work together on something like this in school, we might’ve been…less like we were?”
“Yours, probably.”
He made the time to meet with Neville in Diagon Alley one afternoon to consider some of the plants at Noltie's Botanicals, and discuss Harry’s garden.
“Nothing in particular you might like to attempt then? Aside from what you’ve already promised, of course.”
Finally, he eased off teasing.
“You know you might consider—before you go on insulting me in my own home, which you’ve come to uninvited—you are fucking
Harry had his doubts about ‘grey’ magic. That said, he couldn’t very well rule out their best option on account of a bad reputation. He frowned thoughtfully. “Go on.”
“Yes, I intend to.”
On Friday Harry was forced to heal what remained of Draco’s bitemarks still visible on his neck. He left only a pair of them behind, just above his collarbone where his shirt kept them well hidden. What would be the point in wasting time on unnecessary spells?
“Tomorrow morning I’ll start with the window illusions first thing, then we’ll do the curtains together. I doubt we’ll get them all done before we’re meant to be meeting with Cassie, but then we
one of our newest cards. …We had also hoped you might be willing to put us in touch with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.”
As it turned out, he needn’t have bothered with clothes at all. Draco hadn’t. He was lying naked on the library settee, flat on his front, his hair looking still a bit damp at the ends. He was reading a book.
“I want you, right here,” Harry professed to his lips.
“Come inside me, Harry
Draco dropped his book onto the table too hard in the quiet library, and Harry jumped.
“So if it
“Er, hello—perhaps you could help me—I’m looking for someone who might be able to answer some questions about the people that you service here, what they might need—that sort of thing.”
The following Monday was Harry’s first day back to the office, and also just happened to be the 5
“…And I wanted to fuck you.”
“Hn,” was Harry’s eloquent response. “S’pose it’s good you did then.”
Harry thrust in hard, put his weight into it, and Draco pressed back, forcing his arse flush to Harry’s hips, rocking on his cock as they both held firm, until Draco whined a beautifully broken sound—and Harry did it all over again, drawing out to fuck back in.
“Couldn’t we do it a bit later then? You know I hate dancing at things like this.”
“You could make me stop talking.”
“What sort of something?” Harry was trying to discern if this was related to sex or not.
While not exclusively, there were naturally an abundance of Slytherins and Ravenclaws present for the festivities. Despite the significant easing of tensions between the houses after the war, Harry still felt a bit… outnumbered. Even if these days he supposed the worst that might happen was a stretch of awkward silence. Gone were the days when the mere presence of Gryffindors and Slytherins in the same room together would come to blows, hexes, or worse.
And liking blokes really wasn’t the heart of the problem, it was much more the fact he was still engaged, and currently fancying the pants off fucking
Draco’s cock stiffened before very long, but Harry kept at it intently—until Draco tightened around his tongue with a rather desperate groan.
Malfoy drained his glass, rather abruptly standing up from the table.
As February changed over into March and Harry plodded along into spring, he spent any spare time he could find perusing the books Malfoy had lent him. He spent so much time flipping through them in the evenings, he supposed it wasn’t a terrible shock that Ginny eventually noticed them, being spread over the sitting room table they were all but impossible to miss.
Though he supposed, that wasn’t entirely fair. The Muggles did appear to be trying to do something about it—but given the slow progress of the ever-lengthening queue before them, and also the sheer number of people very clearly in need of help, it was difficult to argue they were doing any of it particularly
They tried the door to the room full of brains as well—which Harry shut immediately—before finding the correct door to exit the Department of Mysteries. They argued about who was the least lucky of them the entire way back to the lifts, but Harry was just grateful that he hadn’t had to face the Veil.
“Alright,” he agreed tiredly, pushing his glasses up to rub at his eyes. “Think I’ll just have a cup before bed.”
. Draco sounded like he meant that.
“Is that difficult to understand?” Draco taunted.
“Consider what you might like someone to do to you… only watch your teeth. Not everyone likes quite so much as you.”
Hurrying to tug the neat tuck of Draco’s shirt from his trousers, he slid the flat of his palm beneath it, warmly tracing a pale blond path. At the impatient shift of Draco’s hips, Harry pressed against the lovely curve of his arse while his fingers ventured on to unbuttoning his trousers.
“This is nice.”
Harry had just summoned his jeans and Draco’s question caught him so off-guard he forgot to catch them, and they hit him in the face.
“Dementors?” he asked warily, fears only confirmed when Savage nodded gravely.
Harry thought he had finished his rant, but then he went on.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
His lips stole Harry’s, kissing him deep and rather hard before he whispered the spell to unravel the ties coiled around Harry’s wrists.
After assessing his take on the other two styles they’d decided on, Draco deemed them satisfactory and they got to work. Their meeting with Cassie wasn’t until noon, giving them a few uninterrupted hours before they were meant to be in London.
Backing up cautiously, Harry prepared to run again as his Patronus circled back around to catch the last three from behind. The nearer they all got the louder his mother grew, as usual, and it was rarely only her anymore. Lately there were a lot more voices screaming in the mix, and it could get a little overwhelming—but then a grip tightened hard on the wrist of his wand-arm, a flood of warm magic and an abrupt throb of light out of his stag’s glow ran the last of the wraiths off into a grim ashen sky.
Draco’s eyes shifted away unreadably, sipping slowly from their glass before he replied.
Watching him with half-lidded lusty grey, Draco’s eyes narrowed a bit. “Put it in, Potter.”
“Sorry,” he apologised, not entirely able to hide his amusement. “Go on.”
When their lips pulled apart Harry was breathless, his lips throbbed sorely what with all their hard kissing earlier, his eyes gone darkly hazy with lust.
Harry wouldn’t argue. There was a lot more work to do before the night was over, and he would be worthless if he were too knackered to keep up—not to mention he doubted he’d make it to any sort of celebrating either.
As always, thanks for reading, the kudos and the feedback, and enjoy!! Summer's been kicking my arse and I wish I had more time to work on this lately, it's the most fun I've had writing in ages. But I'll keep poking at it until it's finished!
Harry jolted at the sudden sound in silence, before he remembered where he was.
“Alright, Harry?” Ginny appeared to have finally extricated herself from where Percy had been updating her on his latest clerical accomplishments.
“Maybe I want to be boring.”
He wasn’t retaining any of what he was meant to be learning.
“Potter when you whisper like that I can’t—”
“Er. Haven’t you only ever heard me and a homicidal bastard speaking it?”
Harry’s panting grew heavy and tight with the effort of his control, the heat built between them flushing him all over, but he didn’t stop.
Hello, so this is massively later than I'd hoped. Work got unpredictable and this chapter was a bit more involved so it took longer to get right, then I ended up splitting it in half like the last one, but here's the first bit! The next few chapters might also be late, depending on how things shake out, because there's a lot going into them, but I'm really hoping not.
More importantly, he was excited to get into the practical aspects of their solutions—and finding the right place to start with was a very big step in that direction.
“Good,” he encouraged in a low hush. “Go on then.”
“Malfoy? You alright?”
Harry wasn’t actually aware what was happening, only that when he urged Draco to come, he shuddered very hard and came almost instantly, and Harry had come only several harder thrusts after.
“Later, then,” Harry said, flushing a bit. “…Happy birthday.”
Harry stopped himself short of expressing his thanks again. Given how much it seemed to annoy him, he reconsidered, and settled on:
“I’ll get it all, don’t worry,” Harry promised ambitiously.
After the pandemonium of the last few months, Harry was ready for some time off, and decided on the last week of May.
,” he cursed.
your job to save the world from everything bad, you massive prat.”
“You’ll tell me if this hurts too much?”
Harry drew in a very tight breath. “I guess I should go.”
Ultimately though, there was one argument that tended to sway him in the direction of going forward with the whole endeavour. When his father was not so much younger than Harry was now, he and all the Marauders had gone out of their way to break Wizarding law in becoming unregistered Animagi, and why? To help their friend, and because it had been the right thing to do.
Harry could hear the smirk in Draco’s voice, even before he looked.
On Tuesday night after work Harry’s curiosity and impatience combined to get the better of him. He laid the Protean blackboard on the sitting room table and touched his wand tip to its surface, sending through a message.
They’d said they would be quick, only they were into such an agonisingly good rhythm, Harry didn’t want to stop now—Draco didn’t appear to be in a rush anymore either.
“Not at all, I’m happy to help. And by the way Harry, you look very nice today. It’s different!”
At around eleven-thirty on Saturday Harry gathered up his notes, with a few of Draco’s books he wanted to return, and took the Floo to Malfoy Manor as planned.
Draco, who was now nuzzling sleepily into his neck and languidly rolling taunting hips atop Harry’s. Their lower-halves being all wrapped up in silky sheets, with a least one layer between them, did nothing to hide the stiffness of their cocks when Draco squirmed to more closely align them, spanning Harry’s thighs lazily with his own.
She went quiet a moment, gathering her thoughts before she shared them.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Ginny kissed him more squarely then, and Harry felt his cheeks flush—and a sort of sinking in his stomach that he’d only just recently started experiencing when he kissed her. It all felt so wrong. In a heartbeat he felt a wave of guilt and fear and a painful awareness that her lips were not doing to him what Draco’s lips always seemed to do.
“I think you’ll find you’re the one being a stubborn prat this time. Just accept the fucking blow job.”
Harry nudged his wand in delicately harder and watched Draco’s cock twitch for him as he did—
“Alright what the
“Fuck
A tug pulled him down to sit, and Harry slouched to drape an arm along the back, raising his eyebrows expectantly.
“As far as I know it’s been years since they last met, well before the war started up again…obviously she wasn’t meant to be doing it in the first place. Father would’ve disapproved.”
“Maybe I just want to talk about feeling you.”
"I only—I want to help people, you know? I want things to be fairer, for everyone."
Finally it was their turn at the hearth.
“Wait—really?” Harry checked uncertainly.
“Today is my birthday, Potter. I’ve come to demand a gift.”
“I have no idea. We might need to try them all—but we’re looking for the one with all the clocks, and… trying to avoid the big stone room with the great murderous arch in.”
However, when the rain finally started in earnest, Draco spent a good several minutes opening and closing the umbrella in curious fascination before he allowed Harry to actually use it. By the time he seemed satisfied in his understanding of how it worked, they were both a bit wet already.
Harry sucked a love-bite dark red beneath his ear, speeding his thrusts as much as he could handle. Their pace interchanged, drawn-out then faster, faltering every time he got too close, but Harry fucked him with all the force he had to give so early on a Sunday morning.
Harry chewed his lip, not entirely sure how to even begin to explain. He felt quite silly, but ultimately settled on the truth—for the good of the spell.
Harry has a bit of explaining to do, and adjusts to some new information about himself, his goals, and Draco Malfoy.
They had left their robes behind in the library.
“That’s not what you were saying a half hour ago,” he taunted, lifting his hips only enough to pull his trousers back up.
“You obviously can’t be trusted to do it yourself.”
Dropping his bags in front of the fireplace, Harry hurried to close the short distance between them to kiss him. Dropping the book he was levitating, Draco let him, kissing back for several blissful seconds, with an almost imperceptible sigh. His lips were softly warm, and he smelled as wonderful as he always did.
“Draco—”
“That’s fairly straightforward, only—are you expecting to be in touch very often then?”
They collapsed together in a tangle of legs, eager hips, and hurried attempts to strip as quickly as possible—with the aid of hands and magic alike.
“What do you think, Cornelius? Is Potter quite mad?” Draco drawled wryly.
“As if you want me to make you feel something.”
When his break hour arrived, he waved off Savage’s offer to buy him lunch at his new favorite chip shop—claiming he was popping over to the Leaky for a nap in one of their rooms. But Harry didn’t go to the Leaky Cauldron, he went to see Cassie.
“Hold on, you drugged me? Er—drugged us?”
Harry had mentioned then he had been thinking of taking a little time off, and Hermione had asked him to let her know as soon as he knew when.
“On the contrary. It’s intriguing—although I’m not entirely sure you understand what you’re asking for when you look at me that way.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
to yourself. I don’t recall saying anything about your cock,” Draco drawled smugly, as Harry swelled to hardness under his friction. “Or your mouth…”
Harry hoped he sounded authoritative enough they wouldn’t argue with him. Hermione did not appear to fully believe him, but she also seemed satisfied enough in his judgement that she wasn’t going to press.
“I could try healing it for you.”
“Just doing some extra research for work.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Alright then, we’ll go with the other place.”
Harry shrugged. “He’s still Malfoy.”
Every word Malfoy spoke was steeped in superiority, but Harry also thought perhaps Malfoy was more ‘intellectually invested’ than he was letting on. Or, Harry was succumbing to wishful thinking again—which he had been mentally begging himself to
Scoffing, Draco flicked at his scar, but not very hard.
Harry drank his drink and tried not to think about what all he would be recovering from. In the morning, he was meant to be out with Savage looking into some reports of a few more-dangerous-than-usual Dark Magic artifacts being trafficked out of Borgin and Burkes.
“Morning Malfoy. I made tea.”
“Stop stalling and get up, there’s lots to do.”
For perhaps too long, Harry stood in the empty lift as his mind raced. He would need to find Ginny, assuming she had returned. He would also need to somehow not behave like a complete prat, despite the guilt and uncertainty currently raging in his mind. He could already tell it would not be an easy task.
“Perhaps a very short one, if you can manage to keep your hands to yourself.”
Knelt on the floor just between his knees, Harry only licked his lips and caught his breath, until Draco slid off the cushions and into his lap to kiss him. They moaned together as he took his time tasting himself on Harry’s tongue, his free hand sneaking between them to rub at Harry’s cock through his trousers.
Harry’s grin was quite playful. “I thought you liked it the hard way.”
On one of the bottle’s sides was a silver label, and ‘pain potion’ written in Malfoy’s careful script. As much as he ached then Harry didn’t hesitate to down it, and the resulting relief was worth the risk. It was still a bit painful to walk, but traversing the distance to clear Hogwarts’ Apparation barriers was an excruciating experience for an entirely different reason—it was giving him too much time to think.
Malfoy
“Your name’s pretty memorable,” Harry mused, nipping at his pulse point. “This could take a while.”
The hall was pitch black, and for whatever reason the blue flames that lined the hall did not flare to life as they exited the lift. Harry waited a moment to see if they would before whispering a quiet
“Couldn’t I lick you a bit first?”
“Will you be finished combining the spells by then?”
“And if you need to send any messages to me, it works just the same. If there’s a day you’re available to meet, you can write it on the light—and I can confirm with a checkmark or star or something.”
“Fucking tease,” he panted, a touch delirious in the heat between them.
“I’ll be just down the hall then. If you need me for… anything.”
Smirking, Draco mirrored the sip, and Harry had a hard time looking away from him. He was a bit grateful for the interruption when a pair of posh salads arrived.
“There’s no time for snogging.”
Harry shifted closer yet, until their shoulders touched through every breath.
Harry hummed something of an agreement, bumping their lips together playfully—but Draco resisted taking his bait.
“D’you have any pumpkin juice?” he queried abruptly with a lazy stretch.
“I wouldn’t’ve spent all these months researching if I intended to drop out on you now, Potter. It would be a waste. You couldn’t possibly do this without me, you’re hopeless.”
Draco moaned again incoherently, but was finally relaxing enough Harry could push himself in completely—a touch mind-blowing on a level it had never been before, even on the potion. This felt more intimate, somehow. Harry could see every flash of pleasure and abandon on Draco’s face, teasing his cock with slippery fingers as he got lost in the incredibly tight hold Draco’s arse had on him.
Ron’s throwing force had grown more powerful in recent years, but then Harry’s had as well, both of them filling out some from the awkward teenagers they had been.
A darkly unpleasant feeling wrenched sinkingly through him—he couldn’t see Draco anymore; only Malfoy—but he had questions that needed answering, and he was determined to ask them now.
there was nothing dodgy about this one.
“We need it.”
Shuddering against him, Draco sighed a soft curse over his lips.
That tense tone was back, and it gave Harry pause. Suddenly it didn’t actually sound like nothing important, but he would let the subject drop. The middle of a swanky Muggle restaurant was probably not the best place to be discussing strange magical phenomena anyway.
It had not fully occurred to Harry that without elves Draco would surely do his own laundry, until he watched him levitate a swirling bundle of it out to the sitting room.
“I can’t go anywhere until you move off,” Harry pointed out a touch smugly. “Should we try one of yours tonight?”
Harry held up immediately. Given the squeeze of intense pressure around his cock he was a little shaky, but he quirked an exasperated eyebrow at Draco anyway.
Sitting on either end of the settee Draco had been napping on earlier, Harry yawned, and Draco mirrored him only seconds later, and glared immediately afterward, as if it were all Harry’s fault—because it was.
“Apparently about as badly as you wanted to fuck me.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
It was only after they had returned home that night, past midnight, and well after Ginny had gone tiredly off to bed, that Harry began to get a bit… restless.
“Alright,” Harry muttered, resisting the urge to reach up and touch the sticky balm. “Thanks.”
It was past one by then, and Harry had mumbled something unintelligible and made right for the shower.
Purring a lusty vibration, Draco started squeezing with practised pressure all around his balls, and Harry quickly fell into an aggressively pleasurable apex, arching off the wall to throb generous spurts into his waiting mouth.
Then he was crushing their lips together, and Harry was so relieved, he felt as if all the air had been knocked out of him.
Exhaling some of his nerves, Harry curved his fingers in searchingly to lightly tease at Draco’s prostate, watching the arch of him as he pressed into Harry’s touch. His head tipped down and Draco braced his palms on the mattress, rocking forward over the end of the bed and back ever harder.
Harry hurried to sit up, to get his fly undone, pull his cock free from its confinement and find the breathtaking tightness of Draco’s arse to sink himself into.
“I’m sure they’ve been wondering since you walked out of the lifts.”
After prodding cautiously at an elaborate serving bowl full of something yellow, and tar-like in consistency, Harry settled instead on wandering occasionally by the tables to steal an olive or two. They were at least something he recognised as a type of food.
“All of that goes into the spell?”
Draco whispered a spell, and hooked a knee up over Harry’s shoulder—one, then the other—and he was suddenly incredibly exposed.
Harry had encountered a fair deal of depravity in his life, yet the thought of Dementors ‘tasting’ anything gave him the creeps.
Not that Draco allowed them to roam for long, catching hold at his wrists to press them into the mattress on either side of his head, muffling panted groans with domineeringly deeper kisses. Harry shifted restlessly under him, pushing up into the writhe of the pale hips sheathing him repeatedly in breathtaking tightness.
The painting was happening around them, but the paintbrushes were doing all of the work. Occasionally, drops of white paint would escape from the brushes painting the ceiling to land on one or both of them, but they were both far too distracted to notice.
“More than once?”
Harry set the music box down on the table a touch tentatively, pulling open its lid before taking a step back. “You know Hermione used one of these on a handbag when we were on the run…sorta saved our arses more than once.”
It was good. Draco felt
“I’m making an exception. Once. For you. Now shut up, Potter—and get over here.”
“I really like it though, your skin,” Harry admitted with the honesty of a person having several firewhiskys in him. “How is it you’re such a sexy ponce, Draco?”
Draco nipped lightly at his balls, keeping him pinned to the chair with an intense silver gaze all the while. “Because I said so.”
Harry gave him a proper blow job in the tent’s comfy little sitting room, teasing his fingers dry over the tight swirl of his arse and the sensitive taint just behind his balls—until Harry felt them tensing against his forearm and the firm length of Draco’s cock twitched against the hold of Harry’s lips.
“That’s fair,” Harry agreed. “I could speak with her, plan something in a couple weeks? It’s going to be busy here for a bit—”
“You’re sure?”
He waved vaguely in that direction as Harry pulled out to push himself up to sitting.
Ginny handed him a tumbler.
In the long stretch of minutes that it took for either of them to breathe normally again, Harry had drifted off to sleep.
“This is a bit excessive I think.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Dismissive as he sounded, there was an underlying tension in his tone, obvious enough for Harry to notice it. Maybe Draco didn’t want to discuss this, only he had one more question to ask.
He broke off, and instead reached up to attempt flattening a bit of Harry’s hair, though it was a lost cause. Draco frowned at it.
Harry should’ve been down in the library already, Flooing home, or already there. But he was still standing in Draco’s bedroom doorway.
“…Yes well, they’re not the enforcement arm. It’s really Improper Use you’ll need to worry about. Their detection abilities are top-notch.”
But Harry couldn’t really bring himself to argue with his partner either, who seemed to be the sort not to want to rock the boat when it came to the complicated office politics always hanging over every Ministry job. He also knew it was rather silly of him to expect Savage to have the answers to all of his questions. They had only really been given enough information to carry out the task the Ministry was asking of them.
Draco quirked a curious eyebrow, but he did as Harry asked.
“Pompous fucking prick,” Harry murmured, working his pants further down past his arse, and immediately surrounding a sensitively exposed tip in the swirl of his tongue.
“No caffeine,” he promised, and hoped in the low light of the sitting room hearth she could not see him flushing.
“You know, it is ridiculously lucky you’ve run into someone who just
“What else, then?”
When he shrugged them on, he discovered an unexpected weight in his pocket, and found tucked within it a small potions bottle. It was not the wicked blue potion of earlier, but a smaller green bottle with squared sides.
Harry caught Hermione and Ginny exchanging looks he could not read at all, only adding to his general unease. They had clearly covered for him with everyone else—both Neville and George asked after Hagrid when Harry joined them at the bar.
Turning his tactics against him, Harry hummed a very low affirmation, fully determined to keep him sliding into a wet sucking friction.
thing to say.
“What’ve I done now?”
“You absolute bastard.”
“You’re looking a bit warm, Potter.”
When they switched places, Harry bent over the chair’s back, bracing himself on the mirror as Draco had done, close enough to see the depths of his arousal edged in green.
Draco surprised Harry by standing to offer his hand, which Cassie took, looking terribly flattered. She wished them both well as they headed back out the way they’d come.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Are we having naked breakfast?” he asked, hopefully reaching for the waistband of Draco’s silky pyjamas.
“The fire here is connected to the Floo network,” Draco nodded across the library to the large hearth inset into the dark shelves as he fastened the buttons at his wrists. “We can leave whenever you’re ready.”
Harry needed the help—his knees were decidedly wobbly again.
“Have a good evening, Potter.”
“Go on, dear—she’s expecting you!”
He clearly needed to get the talking to himself business under control.
a tease. The sound of him moaning, his voice raw with arousal as he took Harry in harder and for longer every time was possibly one of the hottest things that Harry had ever heard. Though lately there was a lot of competition.
He caught Draco tight around the middle instead, turning them both so he could sink down into the seat properly, and pull Draco into his lap as best he could in the small space between the chair’s overstuffed arms. He really didn’t care that the back was all sticky.
“They’ll ride up with wear,” Draco dismissed airily. “I suppose you’re decent enough. At the very least, now it shouldn’t be an embarrassment being seen with you in public.”
“I dunno what it is, but I’ve done something wrong,” he murmured.
All Aurors in training were required to have a more experienced field partner, and Harry had recently been assigned Rutley Savage, a gangly older fellow with dusty brown hair and a perpetually cheerful disposition.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Your house answers things?”
“Yeah, maybe a little. But I also think it’s going to be alright.”
“Fine. What’s this then?”
“Seems a shame to cancel this one, it came out so well.”
Harry groaned tiredly.
“My family's reputation is completely disgraced. My father is in denial. Most everyone I thought to be a friend is long gone or dead, and I promise you, I feel very far from
“Nope,” he proclaimed around its burn.
“Shit,” he laughed as Draco pushed him back again.
“Fuck, yes.” Harry laughed relief following him. “If tomorrow’s anything like today’s been, I’ll need to sleep for a week afterward.”
“Oh, lucky me,” Draco drawled.
When he had finished, it swung slowly open to grant them entrance.
“It’s not even clever.”
Silver eyes assessed him critically.
Harry had smiled at her then, but there was a churning anxiety running through him at the realisation he wasn’t sure he really wanted her home more often. He liked having the house to himself.
Harry spun quickly to find himself face to flustered-face with the groom himself.
Harry was only trying to be encouraging. Unfortunately, something about his optimism seemed to set Malfoy off.
“What are you—?”
Frowning at his uncertainties, Harry took a moment to dither and decided the least he could do was return the favor for the hot chocolate last Sunday.
They appeared not too far from the shelter, popping one after the other into an alley hopefully tucked away enough to escape notice of any curious Muggles, or anyone else. Harry did a quick survey of the area, determining that was really the case before he started leading them toward a slightly busier street. He immediately missed his trainers, the pebbly pavement crunching too loud under the dress shoes Draco’d insisted he wear.
Not having the words to express what he wanted, Harry rolled them over in the silky sheets covering Draco’s bed. There was a lot of room to roll, they could’ve done at least twice more without reaching the edge.
If Draco was right about how much work was left—and if Harry wasn’t so completely dead-on-his-feet tired that he could find the coordination to cast the required spells—then they were very close
“In my case I think it may well be a lost cause. Anyway, it doesn’t really matter most of the time, it’s just a bit annoying.”
“Remember how you fucked me on the ladder?”
“What’s the matter with the owl then?”
“I’m still in training—and I’m meant to be here for these speeches,” he excused.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Draco looked at him sceptically. “You may want to think of something. Also, your—”
“That’s wildly inaccurate.”
He took another sip, and Harry unthinkingly watched him swallow. It was a surreal moment, recalling that barely a year ago he had watched Malfoy testify before the Wizengamot in this very building. And now—
The solstice has arrived, and Harry has no real idea what the night has in store for him.
“That’s a no, isn’t it?”
It felt so strange to him being there—not in the bathroom specifically, but the whole manor. Harry still had his reservations that coming back was a good idea, but the library had been so comfortable, and somehow untainted enough he could almost forget they had all very nearly died in this place.
“That can’t be right,” Malfoy disagreed dryly, only managing to confuse him further. “But as we’re unlikely to be interrupted all the way in here...I’ll need you to be honest with me.”
“Excellent. Lead the way.”
“Fabrics.”
But despite its problems, in Harry’s opinion it was a decent starter home. Purchased not very long after the start of the new year, it was a part of his evolving grand plan to become the adult he assumed everyone thought he should be. The second part of that plan had involved a somewhat hastily-devised proposal to Ginny on Valentine’s night, just a month or so after he’d got the house.
Harry was pretty sure Draco could ask him to do anything in that tone and he would do whatever it was, however Draco wanted him to do it.
Exchanging mint and honey in the sliding swirls of their tongues, it was the taste that sparked Harry’s brilliant idea—and once it popped into his head, he thought he might’ve dreamed it once. Either way, Harry pushed him backward flat onto the bed with a mischievously eager smile.
They ended up working for nearly two hours, and by the time they were wrapping up, Harry felt he had a much better handle on what all Draco was working toward with his cocktail of spells. He had his doubts he had the skill to cast them—but Draco seemed to have a fairly high opinion of Harry’s abilities, and Harry hated to disappoint.
Harry huffed speechlessly into the lightly sweaty blond hair he was nosing into. Draco’s breathing was heavy and humid between rather claiming bites to Harry’s neck, and he sighed deeply, but also did not entirely cease the soft rolling of his hips.
Draco spread his legs a little wider and Harry thrust a lot harder, fucking him against the desk as Draco’s moans grew ever tauter and more urgent—until his cock twitched hot in Harry’s grip and Draco came only seconds ahead of Harry, who shoved himself in deep in time for Draco’s everything to clench tight around him.
When they were both as clean as they were going to get and the water started going fully cold on them, Harry stopped running his hands all over the slick wetness of Draco’s body long enough to shut it off. They went on snogging in the not-running shower for several more minutes before either of them had the presence of mind to use a drying charm and go back to the bedroom.
Harry wasn’t sure when Savage became such a philosopher.
They were taking a break from casting, recovering some after the slight drain of expelling all that magic in such a short period of time. Draco drifted closer and leant tiredly against his back, the point of his chin resting on Harry’s shoulder rather familiarly.
“You want me to suck you off, Draco?”
Harry kissed him hard and a touch claiming. Draco’s low groan was lost to it before he broke their lips apart to start tracing his own over the light stubble accrued on Harry’s jaw overnight.
Harry chewed his lip anxiously. “Right, sorry, I know it’s a lot to ask. And if you can’t of course I would completely understand—only I can’t afford all this blowing up before I’ve, er—sorted the case, you know. It’s a sensitive legal issue.”
“Right…only the problem with that is I honestly need his help. I couldn’t do it without him.”
“Trousers off, Potter. Everything off.”
While he was at it, he finally got around to owling Luna as well, asking after her, and catching her up on what everyone else had been up to.
When he wasn’t working or struggling to sleep, Harry was practising the modified Extension spell as much as he could.
Speechless beyond the steady stream of swearing speeding through his head, he was fighting not to voice any of it aloud.
The last time they had talked was Draco’s birthday, nearly a month ago. Harry didn’t even have a good reason to owl him now that they were both working independently on familiarising themselves with some of the enchantments.
Three of the Dementors cleared off immediately under the assault, as three others skirted around the chaos to continue their deathly hovering procession.
“You took the potion, Potter. What’s wrong with you?” Malfoy was infuriatingly smug. “I had originally planned on finding someone to enjoy it with after I left this perfectly morbid occasion… It was only just my luck the Savior of all Wizardom decided to follow me into the forest.”
When he rolled his hips, shifting the thrust of his cock much more directly and speeding up, Draco came on the stairs—and Harry hadn’t even needed to touch his cock to make him do it. Draco’s body tensing against his own was too hot then, and too tight, giving Harry a final needed push into a surging thrum of bliss.
Harry sorted the bill, and finished his tea. He was already late meeting Savage at the park—but he needed a moment to prepare himself for another long afternoon chasing his worst nightmares down the streets of London.
,” Draco ordered impatiently.
Draco watched him with sceptical amusement. “What are you up to, Potter?”
“The real question is whether or not I intend to give it to you.”
“Is that all of them?”
He couldn’t do anything to hide the twitch of his cock, and Draco’s smirk was infuriating, but he relaxed his thighs, and let him push them open even more.
He couldn’t focus on her imminent return now, not and still see through what he and Draco had started, so he simply didn’t acknowledge it.
Draco moaned his name again, tighter and closer, and Harry teased through fine darker-blond curls to press Draco’s prick flat to his front, working the heel of his palm over it hard and rubbing. Draco writhed, shuddering between the pressure of Harry’s hand and the penetration of his cock, spurting up his own stomach until Harry pulled his hand away to let him come over the freshly changed sheets.
Harry tried to sit up and realised he was still attached to the banister rungs of the attic stairs.

family there was a tent per person.”
He groaned a little.
“You feel so fucking good
Of course he knew it
“I know. We’ll stay here until we feel up to starting again.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
On Monday morning he found a scroll of parchment on his desk from the department heads, giving him official approval to be off the last half of the week. He hadn’t imagined they would deny him, but it was stretching courtesy to be asking on such short notice. Someone else would need to take his place Dementor hunting with Savage on Thursday, but Harry was very grateful to have a week away from hunting the increasing swarms of menacing nightmare-agitators.
Harry still waited several beats before he cancelled all the spells on the door, and Draco quirked a questioning eyebrow before he opened it.
“Are you walking down to The Hog’s Head with us, Harry? The D.A. really would like to see you,” Hermione pressed as she and Ron joined them.
Neither of them would’ve had time to cast before the Dementors would be on them, so they took off down the alley. When they had put in enough distance and moved far enough away from the main roads, they each fired off a bright Patronus charm—bright enough to send the Dementors screeching off into the sky, likely to recover their dignity elsewhere.
“When you’re being a prick and you know it.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
On Thursday night he used the blackboard to inquire about the progress of the enchantments, unfortunately Draco reported back that he was hitting an unforeseen snag on the calculation of intent fluctuations. Until he could sort out the error, it was holding up his ability to start refining all the protection charms together.
“Watch yourself with that one, Potter.”
Draco chuckled low, lifting his hips enough that Harry could release his own cock from his pants, already eagerly stiff. He helped work down Draco’s too, enough to reveal his bare arse to Harry.
She accepted a small treat from him, but didn’t wait around for his reply, swooping back out of the bedroom and off into the morning sky.
Chewing his lip, Harry waited for Draco’s messages to vanish, and vanished his own before sliding the small rectangular slate back into his bedside table for the night.
He was igniting a completely new sensation—a push of magic through his wand, and in his trousers. Harry’s cock stiffened uncomfortably hard, and several silvery sparks surged from the tip of his wand.
“Yes, quite. The much more interesting part is you remembering that particular rumour,” Draco drawled
“I was, wasn’t I?”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Halfway up the creaky wooden stairs, her footsteps paused.  “I love you.”
“I thought we’d best have something to keep up our energy, these spells will take a lot of power to cast—we’ll need it.”
“Let go, come,” he enticed hoarsely.
“Are you implying you want to fuck me again, Potter?”
Harry has the week off. Harry and Draco have a meeting with Cassie, Harry pays a visit to Malfoy Manor, and Harry's attic gets painted, all in one busy Wednesday.
“What sort of—?”
They could easily have gone on with their whispered argument, but they had reached the door to their destination. Harry was very careful to both open and close it behind them as cautiously as possible.
“Alright, I think? Not sure how well I’m fitting in…”
The Dementors were quite quick lately, not so sluggish as they had been over most of the summer. Even in daylight they advanced on them with startling speed. It was now or never.
“Shit,” Harry cursed.
, I fucking like it, you—”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
More than once, he’d sat down with a scroll of parchment and his quill, with every intention of sending Malfoy a strongly worded owl to rid himself of the conflict. His first attempt turned into a long diatribe reaffirming his commitment to Ginny, which he’d immediately binned and started again. Another devolved into a lecture on the importance of the rule of law, and Harry had binned that as well, as it might be hypocritical to lecture Malfoy about following the law whilst also playing with the idea of breaking it. The last had gone so embarrassingly soppy and nostalgic that Harry had disposed of it with a rather overenthusiastic
At some point that morning, while Harry still slept, Draco had gathered several large piles of sheets from elsewhere in the manor—though these were not the impractically extravagant sort he used on his bed, but a much more traditional linen, piled high in neat stacks on the ballroom floor.
“I thought we had already established you’ve been mad from the start.”
One Saturday afternoon in late March, Harry made enough time to go on a fact gathering mission. He spent well into the afternoon popping around to several of the organisations and charities that he recalled seeing regularly-busy over the last few months. He spoke to whoever he could find, but in particular he wanted to talk to anyone who had a feel for the pulse of the city, and what it needed.
By the time they wandered down to the kitchen for tea, Harry was pretty exhausted.
He had brought his Muggle notebook along, and he flipped it open to a blank page and handed it over, with a ballpoint pen that Draco made a face at, but also didn’t struggle to write with in the slightest.
Harry nodded. “We’d be starting quite early, but you could stop by later, or whenever you’d like honestly, we’ll probably be at it most of the day.”
—why are we here?”
“You may want to start by buttoning your trousers,” Malfoy drawled with obvious amusement, rising to his feet. He cast a short but effective cleansing spell over them both, and yet another had his buttons do up themselves.
“That’s rather enlightened of you.”
appreciate my wit?”
A devious slant to Malfoy’s smirk only caused the simmering heat swirling through him to intensify as he abruptly stepped much closer, brushing his fingers against Harry’s skin again—the barest of touches trailing across his throat. The resulting heat danced its slow way down into Harry’s body, and only left him wanting more.
“You too,” he said sincerely, making his way back across the rather massive lawn to head inside.
“When we get back I’m returning the favour. You don’t need to repay me in sex—or anything else actually.”
Harry was very confused, and now also blushing.
“Go find a drink, it’ll cheer you up.”
“Not bad,” Draco drawled, leant back against his desk watching Harry go through the movements one more time. “You might actually be able to cast soon—with a bit more practice.”
Harry was undoing his jeans again, and hurrying to catch up as he dragged his shirt up over his head.
Cassie was nodding but she looked a bit worried. Which might’ve had something to do with the way Draco’s eyes narrowed dangerously as he emphasised the precarious nature of the situation.
“What if I asked you to try it again? On purpose this time.” Draco’s voice was low, and unusually resolute.
"Magic can't fix money problems, Potter, or the Weasley's wouldn’t’ve been paupers for generations."
Harry shrugged, not terribly fussed about the day’s schedule when the option of fucking was on the table.
“Alright, up then. I’ll walk you through the wandwork.”
Again, Harry fought off the draw to go back to him. “Night.”
“You’ve got an exquisite cock, Potter,” Draco taunted low beneath his ear, teeth catching at Harry’s skin until said cock was twitching dangerously between them. Then he traced his lips along the shell of Harry’s ear. “Put it inside.”
Despite his saying they were invisible, Draco looked about a bit anyway. Harry only barely managed not laughing.
He worked his hips quite slowly at first.
“Not like we’ve never done it before,” Harry pointed out, chewing at his lip. “Only I guess normally we’re naked at the time.”
Draco quirked an eyebrow. “You want me to nap with you?”
“I’ll meet you there.”
To distract himself, Harry was trying to map out the route from the ballroom to the kitchen in his head, but it was very twisty. He could get from the ballroom to the library—that was fairly straightforward—but then he couldn't remember how to get from the library to the kitchen either, so that wasn’t terribly helpful. Thankfully, he had Draco there to guide him.
Draco quirked an expectant eyebrow. “Alright, Potter. Lesson one, don’t slouch. Take your elbow off the table and sit up straight.”
“What are they all here for?”
Draco’s shoulders stiffened visibly again.
But he remembered about where he needed to thrust to start Draco coming apart too.
“I’d really rather not hang around for another round of mind-numbing bureaucratic babble; any chance you’d be interested in giving me an official Ministry tour?”
Reaching back for him, Draco gripped at his arse, urging on the force of his thrusts with a breathier moan. “
Thankfully today, finally, he could move on from purely theorising and start doing something that actually made a difference in the world again. Hermione had been out there for almost a year now, already pushing boundaries in her new Ministry role. In some respects, he felt he’d fallen quite far behind.
, it is highly advanced potions craft,” he equivocated. “Furthermore, I resent the implication my home is unclean."
Still panting, he nudged his nose against Draco’s cheek, and Draco turned to kiss him…even if it was quick and a bit sideways. Harry huffed a dazed sort of laugh, at least he hadn’t brushed his teeth for no reason.
“It’ll be ready by then.”
“Oh fuck, it’ll be so fucking
“I suppose I meant—perhaps improving some of the conditions around here might actually run most of the Dementors off for good,” Harry reasoned as politely as he could manage. He was slowly maturing into diplomacy, yet still it had a tendency to escape him.
Something compressed tight and strange in Harry’s chest, uncertainty in his quick inhale—and he thrust up once, hard, drawing out Draco’s sharp moan and effectively distracting them both.
Draco’s shirt dropped onto the desk behind him, and slid off onto the floor.
“Oh! Oh my…that’s not really an easy ask you know; we tell each other absolutely everything and you’re—well, you’re
“Same reason we’ve used it before, communication. I’ve got something of an ally on the Muggle side of things, I needed a way to keep in touch.” Harry tried to be cautious about how much he divulged, without seeming like he was outright hiding anything. It was trickier than he expected.
“Oh dear. What a tragedy that would be.”
“Of course,” he admitted. “I’d forgotten all about it over Christmas—but, well basically when we spoke at the ball in December he’d offered to help with some research, that’s all.”
He led Harry out into the corridor, and down into a narrower side hall, which curved around into another larger corridor.
At a minimum of four lamps per tent it was a lot of Transfigurations, but as with the curtains they got into a pretty good rhythm and made fast work of them.
Rather than apologise, Harry caught at his chin and tried to kiss him, but Draco pushed him away.
Some of their clothes were quite worn, and many were heavily layered with jumpers and jackets. A number of people in the queue carried with them a range of carts, sleeping bags, rolled-up tarps, and any number of other possessions.
Next, he had gone to see Cassie, stopping in one day between Dementor sweeps.
“Who’s taking spunk?” Harry questioned with entirely false innocence, reflexively reaching back to slide his palm over Draco’s hip, but he was swatted away.
“Oi,” Harry complained, following after him. “What was that for?”
Inevitably he tried looking again, and Malfoy only redirected him again.
He threw himself into his work instead. A stack of Auror reports, waiting for him in his Ministry cubicle, would hopefully be distraction enough to stop Harry thinking on all of the many ways he was literally fucking his life sideways.
“Fuck,” he cursed. “
Draco did. One to unzip Harry’s jeans, and another to slick his hand before he was working into Harry’s pants to stroke his cock in slow, tight jerks.
Draco flashed a smirk, but of course his answer was to take off for the open gate, leaving Harry behind to belatedly register what’d just happened.
“Alright, Harry—you’re off the hook, for now.”
“What are you—?”
Then Draco murmured a low spell, a Disillusionment Charm, veiling them both under the same cool trickle of magic.
It served to improve Harry’s evening a fair deal, not to mention his opinion of the party.
Harry and Draco's Saturday spells practice runs late, conversations are had, new discoveries are made, and Harry is very bad at pattern mixing.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“There are spells to monitor intent. They’re popular with pubs and clubs and the like, you know. But it’s a hard thing to pin down, intent is malleable—it changes. If you don’t key the spell to respond to the fluctuations, it could cause problems… or simply not work at all.”
He sent instead:
“No, I—sorry. Sorry, it’s stupid.”
“Better head back the way we came, make sure we’ve got them all.”
Harry had not been back in the three years since he had lost Sirius, though he had seen the Veil so many times in his dreams, whispering to him. Would it call to him again if he went to it?
“The extra room’s a nice touch,” Harry noted. “I wouldn’t’ve thought of that.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Throw the Quaffle or don’t then.”
,” he cursed again.
“That would be very impractical,” Draco agreed dryly.
,” Harry begged tightly, arching up and pressing in hard just as Draco rocked down—
“You must be fully pissed if you think you have any hope of convincing me to care about the plights of destitute muggle masses. As I’ve already told you, it is not my problem…. or yours, for that matter. Just banish the Dementors like a good Auror boy, and walk away.
Standing at the bottom of them, Harry caught Draco at the hips as he went to take them, and pulled him back down, forcing the very eager stiffness in his jeans against Draco’s arse. Draco rocked roughly back against the rise of his cock with another low moan, and Harry groaned, thrusting forward even harder.
“Not at all.” Draco had that curious look in his eye that Harry found so fascinating.
Harry had never realised before how much he was capable of going on. He was almost as bad as Hermione.
After a moment’s thought however, he pushed up enough to lightly brush their lips together, almost questioningly.
The mossy scent of the forest hung heavy in the early-May air, and clustered puffs of mist floated amidst the trees.
He remained rather cross with himself for having such terrible self-control, but Ginny had not been around much in the last several weeks, and when she was gone Harry felt less the sense of crushing guilt over what he had done—and what he was clearly still thinking of doing far too often.
“I’ve just got back—Renna says hello, by the way—I’m sorry I’m so late but I hadn’t seen her since the wedding and we had so much catching up to do! We had some lovely wine, and she was telling me all about their honeymoon. Paris, Harry! Can you imagine?”
“By the way, sorry about all the commotion earlier,” he offered from nowhere. “I probably should’ve mentioned Dementors might happen.”
Harry considered asking if he minded, but Malfoy spoke up first.
.” Ron gestured a bit wildly, for emphasis.
A few of his plants had come out looking less than viable, and he’d taken the time to send out an owl to Neville about his lovage being so brown and leafless.
“He’s lucky he’s not in Azkaban,” she answered in a more hushed tone, given they remained surrounded by people, several of them former Slytherins.
“’Afraid so. Starting to become a problem, too. They’ve been… accumulating. ‘Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures are completely overwhelmed, they just can’t keep up, no matter how many times we’ve come in and cleared them away.”
Harry was struggling a bit not to stare, but Draco’s gaze swept over him too.
When they reached the great front door, Draco performed a similar ritual and the door opened for them just as the gate had. As they stepped into the long front hall, Draco charmed the door shut again behind them and Harry caught the edge of an enchantment glimmering over the closed door.
” he hissed, stroking faster.
“Congratulations, Lawrence,” Harry greeted with relief when he finally recalled. He hoped it was the right one, the groom didn’t look offended in any case.
He also extracted a thickly rolled scroll—Hermione’s notes for him on the Protean Charm.
“Hmm?” Harry hummed, still chewing.
“I know that. I’m fine,” he snapped shortly, matching Harry’s concerned frown with a stubborn scowl. “It was only a dream.”
He kept the Portkey in his pockets the rest of the week, and as the meeting drew closer, it became a weighted reminder of his plans—a reminder that often sent his thoughts spiralling off into a debate over whether or not any of it was really a good idea. Wouldn’t he only be causing more trouble than all their efforts were worth? As an Auror, how could he justify breaking the laws this way?
Hovering partway between the kitchen and the sitting room, Draco watched the exchange curiously. “Who is it?”
It took just over an hour to implement, splitting the lamps into small batches between them. Thankfully the glow charms required very little magic and took almost no time to cast, which helped in speeding the process along somewhat.
As the lust abated, Draco rested his head back on Harry’s shoulder a while longer.
“If you think anything I’ve gone through has been lucky, you haven’t been paying attention.”
“Ginny’s date; she and Renna were close at school.”
“Oh fine. But only because I’m also hungry.”
“Oh god,” Harry gasped shuddering.
Fuck—Harry I can’t—”
Draco swatted the side of his head, ungently, then tangled long fingers in messy hair and pulled him down for another hard kiss. Harry moaned, muffled yet still embarrassingly loud.
Draco looked at him sceptically. “You actually want to?”
Harry was significantly more sober now than he had been when he first arrived, and he sat now on the edge of Draco’s ridiculously soft bed and summoned his trousers off the floor.
He was taking his sweet time with it too. The fact he found it necessary to lock eyes with Harry while he did it only sent the heat currently flushing through him climbing steadily higher.
His lips were now well past the point of reasonable pain. He probably should’ve taken the time to heal them, but instead Harry only licked at them and shifted up to kiss Draco, slow and sparked with rising heat—though he paused to pose a low question. “Can I fuck you?”
“Er. The intent clauses.”
“Yes, obviously except you.”
“Dra-
with him?
“Turn around.”
He wasn’t ready to return to the festivities, and he reasoned the chaise looked more comfortable than standing, even despite the added presence of a bothersome prat like Malfoy.
“Right. I spent all night biting my own neck raw.”
“…You added the mint?”
At the end of the corridor was a set of very tall double doors, and Harry felt an odd sweeping in his stomach when Draco charmed them to swing slowly inward, revealing a very reflective ballroom with a high, vaulted mirror ceiling.
He struggled a bit to swallow when Draco was as deep into his throat as he was, but Harry got the hang of it after a moment, and it was worth the trouble for the way Draco groaned at him, rocking his cock into Harry’s mouth, and pulling out almost reluctantly—though his fingers remained tangled deep in a dark mess of hair.
Lately, the Fates were in the habit of throwing wildly inappropriate situations at Harry when he least expected them, and it was all starting to shake his foundations a bit.
“I promise. Fuck, I promise. Gods fucking—hurry.”
When Harry looked up at him, Draco’s eyes were fully smouldering at him.
“Thanks,” he mumbled, making a vain attempt to straighten his robes.
In the end, they had dispersed nearly a dozen small nests of Dementors from the city. Harry had discovered quite quickly that each was located within obvious proximity to some sort of centre of human sadness. The majority of them had been found in pockets of three or more, nested within small congregations of rough sleepers like some sort of great floating parasites. There had also been one unemployment office which had been somewhat overrun with them, until they’d managed to draw them all away.
“It’s only a bed, Potter.”
“We should probably eat something as well,” Draco acknowledged.
Well, now Harry was blushing again.
"By all means then, spend the rest of your life attempting to solve Muggle poverty, instead of hunting down Dark Magic as your job supposedly entails. I'm hardly going to stop you.”
Then he was speeding his stroking significantly.
It still made Harry a bit nervous. He’d had enough of out-of-control fires in his life.
Somehow, he managed not to, but Harry moaned low and his hips snapped his cock up into Draco’s prostate, and Draco let out a sharp cry that Harry found incredibly satisfying.
Harry smirked at him a bit proudly for a few oblivious moments. He only snapped out of it when Draco shot him a look, and he recalled he had one more thing he needed to ask.
Ginny grinned back at him. “Isn’t it? I think she’s going to do big things for us this year, and we bloody need some wins.”
“Erm. Thanks?”
Fair warning, this chapter is almost twenty pages and a good half of them are sex. You have been warned.
Huffing into the silence that followed his absence, Harry slowly pulled himself to his feet.
“Sorry,” Harry added. “Suppose I might’ve owled first.”
“This isn’t bitter at all. It’s very sweet.”
However once he and Ginny had decided to see each other again, and as the sum of couples around them began to grow, he had noticed more and more the looks of longing in her warm brown eyes. Caring for her as he did, consequently it became more and more difficult to continue denying her a proper happy ending, when everyone else around them seemed to be finding one.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“He’s done nothing but help,” Harry said immediately, realising then how true it was. “I have no reason not to trust him with this.”
Harry looked incredulous. Making any sort of deal with Malfoy sounded… risky.
When they eventually managed to stop kissing, Harry slouched back in his chair as Draco shifted down to kneel between his legs, and slowly trace his lips along Harry’s cock through his jeans. He moaned softly every now and then, his fingers aching to brush through Draco’s hair, but he was resisting the temptation.
Harry wished the panicky feeling suddenly slamming in his chest would abate enough he could respond like a normal person who had just been asked to tea. Why was he so
,” Draco gasped, rocking back on his cock in the residual heat as Harry came in hard throbs.
He also wasn’t sure at what point he had become Draco, and not Malfoy. He was only really sure that when the constant throb of pleasure through his nerves finally began to release its hold he was very sore, stickier than he thought he had ever been and surprisingly rather unwilling to pull his cock out of the man beneath him. So he didn’t, and quite enjoyed the way Draco moaned any time either of them shifted even a tiny bit.
“Don’t have to do much, do I?” Malfoy’s taunting drawl was punctuated by the rougher pulling open of a couple more trouser-buttons, making the eager outline of Harry’s interest all the more obvious, once there was room to grow.
“What?”
Harry shook his head. "I’m sorry Malfoy, I can’t agree with that. People are meant to help each other—it’s how we survive.”
“There now. That ought to do—in a day or two. Try not to rub it off in the meantime. Baths only, no showers.”
“Yes well. If you’re allowed to break them, why can’t I?” Draco argued dryly.
Harry didn’t know why that was making him blush so unreasonably pink but it was very annoying. Well, perhaps he knew why a little bit.
Falling back on the cushions, Draco looked at him with frustrated exasperation.
“Nice job,” Harry said spontaneously, and caught Malfoy smirking proudly as he pulled the shoebox off the table to examine it more closely.
“Luna, I think. It’s her owl. Yes, alright—hello Gordon. Sorry, I haven’t got any treats on me.” Harry scritched at his head to stop him nipping at his fingers.
Harry tried thrusting in that way, to no avail, and Draco rocked his hips impatiently.
Harry shook his head. "You're a parody of a rich bastard sometimes."
When Harry opened his eyes to the Sunday morning sun streaming in through his bedroom window it took a few yawned seconds for him to register the warm body he was spooned up behind was naked and, more importantly, Draco. The hint of spiced coconut was his first clue, and the brilliant white-blond gleaming in the sunlight was another.
The night of the Ministry’s Winter Solstice Ball was, naturally, the night of the winter solstice.
Moments later he was gasping a shocked sort of pleasure as Draco nosed gently under his bollocks to touch the tip of his tongue to Harry’s taint. The soft of his lips pressed to Harry’s balls with an open mouth, humming low as he started up rubbing all over them with the wet heat of it.
’). In the end, both of them gave in to the familiar comfort of her doting on them.
What with all the distraction it took Harry a moment to find the words dancing at the tip of his tongue. “Thought you said—”
can accomplish all that—the framework of the spell should suit rather well.”
It was rather instinctively that Harry popped his finger up to his mouth after to suck it clean. He didn’t think much of it at all, until Draco leant back to eye him at the sound.
But he couldn’t think of it now. They had so much work to do before then—Draco was making real progress. They were so close. He couldn’t fall apart now.
Harry followed his gaze to see a small cluster of the Ministry’s top officials huddled around together. As he watched, Kingsley joined them with what looked to be plenty of good holiday cheer. The speeches would be starting again soon.
Lost in his thoughts, when Malfoy broke their train Harry finally looked up from his glass.
“Nothing’s the matter. Just—” Cutting himself off with a scoff, Draco caught the front of his shirt in a firm grip and dragged him brusquely into a much narrower break between two buildings.
“You haven’t told me what I’m—”
When Harry returned to the ball it was to discover that someone had enchanted some sort of mint-flavoured snow to fall continuously down on the solstice celebrators below. He didn’t have to guess too hard who might be responsible for it either.
A posh lunch date and a long evening of preparation leave Harry and Draco on the eve of a very big day.
Harry was not awake at all when the soft nudge of a nose against his throat foretold the firm and sleep-warm weight of Draco sliding over to lay on top of him.
Draco’s eyebrow quirked with an aroused sort of amusement, but as Harry’s gaze travelled naturally down between them, Draco’s cock twitched hard as he very slowly spread his legs for Harry.
“C’mon. We’re going in here a moment.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“One night only, Potter. Take it, or leave it.”
It was the look of fear in their eyes that was so familiar to him, and Harry thought what concerned him most were the significant number of children present in the winding line. No child deserved to be a Dementor’s prey.
“Alright, I suppose; not terribly exciting. Haven’t been here very long.”
“Er,” Harry said abashedly. “I could try it again?”
“Is there a downside?”
They both cursed simultaneously when opening the door did not reveal the petrol-black hall, but instead what was clearly a solar system suspended in actual space. There did not appear to be a floor or ceiling to this room.
He didn’t need to search for his friends very long. He found the lot of them—everyone left at so late an hour—packed into The Hog’s Head Inn.
Harry felt a twinge of protectiveness override his better judgement.
Filling a small bag with a few things he’d been meaning to work on, Harry took the Floo to Draco’s library after work on Wednesday as if he’d been invited, though he hadn’t actually been. If Draco didn’t want him popping by unexpectedly, he could’ve easily closed his Floo after Harry’s surprise birthday visit—but he hadn’t.
Caught up in a wave of uncertainty, he felt an anxious twinge that he had been incredibly foolish—but mostly he was being inundated with a visceral sort of rage that he had not rightly experienced since the end of the War.
“But you’re not.”
“What’s over there, then?”
think of it?”
Harry fought off a yawn, ultimately surrendering to it, and Draco’s drawl continued, a faint amusement bordering his tone.
“Only the ones with very fit arses and exquisite cocks,” Draco taunted, skirting around Harry to the ballroom doors, leading their way down to the manor’s kitchen.
Draco sighed again. “I’m very tired.”
Harry brushed his lips over the soft curve of Malfoy’s neck where his shirt collar pulled back enough to expose it. Malfoy answered him in quietly resonant moans, a sharp catch of his breath, and the insistent thrust of narrow hips.

“And yet you seem to enjoy my company. What does that say about
By the time he returned home that evening his feet ached. It had been an embarrassingly long time since he’d done so much walking, having been bogged down in paperwork, law classes and his projects at the house. It was a good sort of sore at least, and despite his earlier concerns, Harry did feel a bit like he was accomplishing something.
He felt an immediate pang of guilt for the jab, but then Malfoy was speaking before he could apologise.
Ginny accepted his glass, and then did not seem inclined to return it. Her silence was unnerving him a bit.
Catching his gaze with that same hint of uncertainty, Draco stepped close enough to nip softly at his lips. Harry leaned in, his tongue sliding warmly between Draco’s for a quietly moaned kiss before Draco pulled hurriedly away, stepping back toward the sitting room hearth.
Harry flushed a bit. He didn’t always get spells on the first try, but he really wanted to get this one working.
But that night, he simply went home and went to bed.
As they picked up a smoother rhythm, Harry braced him, gripping at pale hips with rough fingers, helping to pull Draco more firmly down onto swelling hardness. Harry may have started moaning first, but soon they were both caught up in a heated kiss, half-muffled dual moans echoing off the library’s high-ceiling.
He let Draco focus on his getting into his pants. Harry focused on locking their lips together, his fingers catching in the soft hair at the nape of Draco’s neck.
“Probably not,” he agreed shrugging. “Thanks for letting me stay over. No—I know, don’t mention it—but I am mentioning it. Thank you. Shut up and accept it.”
“I don’t have any reason to lie,” he pointed out. “What’s this about?”
“Oh fuck
Harry huffed a breathless laugh. “It’s
He groaned tightly, pushing his lips into Draco’s even harder, and trying to shut out the betrayal of his thoughts.
There was a nervous intake to Draco’s breathing then—which Harry imagined probably had something to do with the fact he was gently nosing and kissing his way down a scar which was very obviously his own handiwork.
“That’s not really my problem, is it? It’s entirely none of your concern who I decide to fuck. Now take your ridiculous fucking tantrum elsewhere.”
“Not that one. Way over your head.” Draco took it from his hands and replaced it with another. “Here.”
“Suppose I might mention it next time he visits, but I haven’t got much use for Seeker moves anymore. I’m always playing you and Ginny, and neither of you ever wants to go Snitch catching.”
“Oh, right—" Harry immediately started rummaging through the tent bag. “Er—a few things. I brought a paper bag, there’s an old teacup, shoebox…but I thought we might try this first.”
Locking their eyes in heated tension, Draco’s voice cut off as he came, hard and hot and mostly all on Harry.
They parted for him, a spark of amusement dancing in Harry’s eyes, Draco pushed in abruptly and Harry moaned around him, taking him receptively deeper.
“Dress me?”
When Harry got close enough to bump his lips up the length of Draco’s cock, Draco tangled long fingers in dark hair to pull him back, smirking down at Harry smugly.
Harry glanced down just in time to watch shots of white seed throb from the tip of Malfoy’s cock to coat his fingers in sticky heat. Malfoy was still shuddering faintly with residual tension, and it was only very gently that he released his grip. Hearing him whimper that way was almost worth the whole ordeal.
“Don’t mention it.”
Harry did not. Instead, he plodded on with the subject, as he was becoming more and more convinced it might actually work—even despite the bit where Malfoy was telling him how incredibly illegal it all was.
Without looking away from him, Harry adjusted his wand, and pushed in and up, gently searching with its wooden tip as Draco’s cock stiffened taller.
But Harry couldn’t help but notice his stag appeared somewhat more subdued than usual. He watched it joining Savage’s goose (moving at a significantly slower speed) in a lap around the area, seeming to ensure their safety before dissipating as well.
“Are you sure? I did say you could fuck me twice... the offer stands.”
“I could have.”
“Say it,” Harry panted with a touch of desperation. “Please, ask for it.”
In that time Harry considered that perhaps their awkwardness had something to do with the fact they never really kissed when they weren’t shagging, or about to shag.
“For the famous Harry Potter, on his very special birthday?” Draco drawled, sarcasm much tempered by the sleepy roughness of his voice. He nipped at Harry’s lightly-stubbled chin. “You can fuck me twice.”
Harry drew in a deep breath, steeling himself for the harsh reality of it all. It was a secret now, and one he would have to keep for everyone’s sake, but also for his own. The consequences—
Harry made Draco come all over the shower curtain, twice, stroking and squeezing the stiff length of him through each, before he gave over to his own orgasm—
“They require more maintenance—haven’t got the sticking power of heating or cooling. We’d need to patch them up regularly, on a bi-monthly basis at the very least.”
“You know it will be. Worse even. I’d also like to point out that you were the one who wanted to do this all in one go.”
“Are you
Harry quickly dropped his to join them on the bathroom floor, and they were both magnificently naked now, and rather hard.
.” Harry shuddered hard, and very nearly came.
Their trousers and pants together made a pile at the end of Draco’s bed, and they rolled tangled in silky comfortable ecstasy, apparently in some sort of battle over which of them could make the other moan loudest. Harry was pretty sure he was winning either way.
Harry couldn’t stop, and didn’t want to—he had no idea how long he spent in that clearing, steadily fucking him against the grass as they both repeatedly came to the sparks of the potion raging through them. It must have been hours. At some point he found Draco’s prostate, and he didn’t really know what he'd found, beyond when he hit just the right place inside him Draco came again.
It was so much harder than the last time. Far more often lingering flashes of intense ecstasy would frequent his thoughts and dreams in new and interesting ways. Harry was not doing so well blocking it out this time—there was too much more to remember now.
Harry offered a sympathetic shoulder pat as he took an open chair at the table.
to notice him. He was also entirely out of sunny sides to look at, and rapidly growing too tired to form a coherent argument of any kind.
Draco hummed a quietly contented noise at him, a sort of charming rightness to the sound, stirring a slight smile to tug at Harry’s lips, even as he drifted unknowingly into darker dreams.
In the space of about half an hour, Harry got better at not needing to look at the snake at all to start hissing sexy things in Parseltongue. For the most part he was going on about how good Draco’s arse felt on his cock, but Draco had no idea what he was saying. Harry might’ve been reading from the International Secrecy Statutes and it still likely would have tented Draco’s sheets where his cock was displaying enthusiastic interest.
“Yes, ah—yes. Thank you.”
—Potter, stop. We can’t.”
“Was I being too subtle,” Harry shot back wryly.
It was fairly easy to spot Ginny again amongst the other attendees, given how she stood out. Harry also couldn’t help but notice she was looking particularly lovely that evening. Her copper curls were drawn up in a high bun, though a few fly-away strands still escaped to brush against the shoulders of a rose-coloured gown.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
They passed a small market on their way to the next place, none of its stands very busy given the increasing deluge of rain, and Harry stopped to get a coffee. Draco refused one, but proceeded then to drink a good half of Harry’s as they walked.
“All I have to say on the matter,” he said, examining his nails. “Is that Slytherin House had a number of interesting parties.”
“If it is what you want that’s all well and good. Only it seems rather…predictable. Boring, even.”
“Prat,” Draco muttered, but Harry caught the twitch of a smirk as he hastened out to wait for their drinks in the ballroom.
“I am insisting.” Draco caught him by the shoulder before he stepped out into the light, casting a quick cleaning charm over the back of his shirt—which Harry wouldn’t’ve even thought to do—and finally cancelling his Disillusionment.
“Indeed, Potter.”
“Alright, I think I’ve sorted them. If I’m right, then it should be fairly simple to frame them out and tie them all into a single illusion, wherein the illusion is really just a reflection of whatever’s actually on the other side. You understand?”
The clouds were unleashing even more uninhibitedly in this part of the city, and the tree could only do so much to protect them from the deluge.
“Then stop staring at it,” Malfoy drawled at him. “Look up instead. You can see most of the constellations out here, perhaps you’ll learn something useful for once.”
“Valliant effort, but try again. What have I said about your
Moreover, he should know better than to let Draco bloody Malfoy shape his moral compass over whether or not he should be worried about being a duplicitous prat. Obviously he should be worried—and the more he thought about the potential consequences, what people might think of him, the more panic set in that he really needed to get it all under control before it exploded in his face.
Now that he was thinking on his job however, Harry couldn't stop himself thinking back on the last several months of perpetually clearing corners, alleys, and bridges of Dementor nests, drawn endlessly to the streets of London.
Draco rocked back on his cock with a low, shouted cry, and came all over the back of the chair. Harry nearly tipped it over, he was thrusting so hard then, surrendering to a long accumulation of ecstasy as he came into the perfect tight of Draco’s arse.
“I’m still not sure what I’ve done wrong though,” he pointed out.
Malfoy might’ve been pissed off about the hair pulling, but he caught on quite quickly, letting Harry fall from his lips only long enough to nip his teeth up the underside of his cock before he was taking him in again, with quite a bit more edge.
Hello! First off thank you for reading if you're still reading! I'm mostly entertaining myself so it's good to know I'm not the only one enjoying it, and thanks for the comments and the kudos!
Harry had been waiting for a reason all day, and caught him by the cheek, hastily crushing their lips together.
Draco had said please. Harry thrust as hard as he could, but he was already coming from the sinful noises out of Draco’s mouth. The pleasure was a touch excruciating, and Draco locked their lips roughly, muffling their cries as his climax followed only seconds later, both of them exacerbating the already sticky mess of fabric trapped between them.
Which was fine, except they were meant to be paying attention to important details like the levelness of the ground and what the surrounding environment was like, but Harry kept getting distracted watching tiny drops of water catching on the ends of platinum hair. The droplets trailing down Draco’s neck and disappearing under the collar of his suit’s fancy shirt were also very nice.
And if it had been Ron, Hermione, any of the Weasleys at risk, Harry was not sure what all terrible things he might’ve done to keep them safe, had his hand ever been forced to do so. He hadn’t hesitated to reach for an Unforgivable in Minerva’s defence.
Sliding sublimely in, he tugged Draco upright, pulling out slowly to thrust in harder.
Draco scoffed at him. “It might be a touch ostentatious, but it has its charms.”
“Fuck’s sake. Get in the fucking shower.”
“Yes,” Harry affirmed.
It was eleven-thirty before he and Ginny managed to escape the revelry. A few of his friends even stayed behind to celebrate Harry’s birthday without him.
Harry shifted his gaze to another of the inlaid silver serpents writhing in the room’s low light.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Sorry, I should’ve brought you a drink as well.”
“Er, yeah. Right behind you.”
“Right. Well I’ve managed to muss it once or twice—but I’ve either had to curse you or fuck you for hours to do it. Now could we go, please?”
That night found Harry seated at a small round dining table over takeaway curry from the Muggle place down the block. Ron had taken quite a liking to it—Harry was fairly sure they’d had it every second time he’d been there.
He felt a faint tremble in Draco’s thighs when he stroked over them, and Draco rocked forward over the back of the chair with his own tense moan when Harry pressed in with his mouth—teasing his tongue all through the mess he’d made, only flicking lightly over the quivering place he’d just fucked so thoroughly, before delving his tongue deeper into rather salty heat.
“Er—right. Was that… everything then?”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“You’re getting much better with your mouth, you know,” Draco noted, with no small amount of cheekiness as they made their way out of the tent, and then out of the library.
“Your propositions need work,” he advised, and kissed him very deeply.
“Potter.”
“I think so, yes. This is our chance to sort out what’s not working and fix it before we go any farther—and we’ll need to get our interiors as close to similar as we can.”
“How d’you know what I’m nervous about?” Harry was too tipsy to pretend he wasn’t nervous.
“Wise choice. Unexpected...” Malfoy trailed off and stepped back.
“Not as if we’re not overdue anyway.”
Harry frowned. “Cordially? After your tongue’s been all over my—”
Harry might’ve been judging them just a bit. He tried reminding himself that he was also there on a Friday afternoon for expensive French cuisine. It never would’ve been his first choice, but he had agreed to this, just as he’d agreed to that ridiculous firewhisky Draco’d very successfully tempted him with the night before.
After appearing reluctant to touch it, Malfoy spelled his chair back into place with a hand wave, before catching Harry with a rather dangerously piercing smirk.
section. Honestly, it’s almost a perfect fit, like it was meant to be there. We’ve got very specific clauses on what can and cannot be talked about, it should keep any secrecy complications to a minimum.”
Draco wandered over to the shelves in search of another book, but when he came back to the table Harry frowned at him.
Huffing, Harry signed the end of his letter to Luna, rolled it up, and charmed it tied before handing it off to Gordon. Coaxing him to his arm, he exited the tent, carrying the owl to the flung open doors of the ballroom.
“There’s nothing wrong with standing out,” was her opinion on the matter.
people first, and that should matter—” She flushed. “Oh, sorry—this job is just very important to me, I do go on. And actually, I’ve got to speak to someone just now—if you don’t mind waiting here…”
“They’re really Father’s peacocks…they’ve been quite despondent since he’s gone to France, but I’ve been trying to cheer them up.”
“Not that sort of something. Your Protean lights gave me an idea.”
He moaned rocking between the pleasure and the overwhelm of Harry’s determined touch.
Prodding at a small pile of herbs with the tip of his wand, Draco paused to smirk. “No, I didn’t think you would.”
“If you can stand to wait that long.”
He was drifting from important details of the interior transfiguration—the furniture, the way the kitchen and the bathroom would need to pull magically from a nearby water source, weather-proofing, and wallpaper.
He did not remember it being quite this blinding the last time, but Harry had also been in something of a panic then. As it was, when the door to the Time Room swung open before them, on the first try no less, he had to shield his eyes, and Malfoy was not far behind him in doing so.
“Hm,” Draco hummed, pushing his hair back from his face with a deep sort of sigh that Harry had never heard from him before. “Fucking fantastic actually thanks for asking.”
….and you like that, don’t you?” Draco taunted more. “I can tell.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry’s palms immediately found purchase on Draco’s arse and pulled him down flush, all soft skin and hard lines, and they both moaned quietly into a swirl of tongues. He knew his stamina was not up to anything at all just then, but that didn’t seem to make him want Draco any less.
It was nearly half-past Draco’s meeting time before Harry finally watched him step into the sitting room fire and call out the name of a pub Harry had never been to before.
It was an odd moment, a backwards mirror to a life not so far behind them, just for a moment, before Harry accepted the help.
“I want all of you, Harry,” Draco drawled hoarsely between quiet moans. “Come inside. I want to feel it.”
In fact, on the night of his birthday, Harry Potter had undeniably had a few too many drinks.
He obviously did, but Harry wanted to hear him say it. He put a rougher twist into his strokes and Draco groaned again.
“Leave it, I like the soreness.”
“Oh!” she exclaimed far more excitedly. “Oh, that’s very clever.”
Malfoy panted something that sounded vaguely like
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry thought it was clear something was very wrong with this process, he just didn’t understand why no one seemed to be doing anything about it.
“I take it I’ll need to wait for that demonstration of gratitude you’ve promised me?”
“Oh, then you
In a flash, he felt back to their school days, when she could always see right through his less than well-thought plans.
Savage seemed to brighten even as he spoke, as if this logic could put the whole of the matter behind them.
He had a fleeting hope Malfoy was not about to tie him to a headstone and try to resurrect Voldemort or anything of the sort, before the Portkey pulled him out of his sitting room and into the middle of a grassy meadow in Wiltshire.
“And you understand why that sounds completely mad to me?”
Unless the rooms moved location completely arbitrarily, Harry thought he knew the right door, but there was only one way to find out for sure. He paused, however, before making any attempt to open it.
Draco was obviously attempting to be the voice of reason, but Harry was looking at him with imploring green eyes, as he appeared to be having a very difficult time denying him.
“Yes, I think you had better. We’ll never manage to furnish all this.”
“Potter…”
Something interesting happened to them that night in Draco’s bedroom.
“Would you like to come to bed with me, Potter?”
“Don’t forget to sleep, Potter. You look awful. You won’t be very effective casting anything if you’re running yourself into the ground.”
“I do hope you’re ready for this, Potter.”
Harry coughed a quiet laugh. “I’ll see what I can do.”
“Er… didn’t really find anything interesting, honestly.”
fuck,” Harry whispered.
“Move off then, tosser.”
Fighting his uncertainty, Harry shifted closer—only to have Malfoy immediately take his hand, and pull it to where he could feel a long length of hardness pressing against the front of Malfoy’s trousers. There was a fascinated hitch to Harry’s breathing as he gave into the urge to press down with his palm, and rub.
He shrugged awkwardly. “Not like I had anywhere better to be.”
“What could possibly be wrong with your hair? It’s almost always perfect.”
“Ah, well then. Congratulations to you too!” Lawrence muddled out, bestowing another firm shoulder pat, that only years of Quidditch practice kept Harry standing solid under.
“I’ll prepare an outline for the composition of the spells and the wards. I think we should go over everything from the start again before we set in to casting them all.”
Despite his lazing about, Harry scrambled to his feet with a ridiculous amount of readiness at the invitation.
“Not always,” Harry protested.
Harry spends a Thursday morning and a bit of the afternoon with Draco at Malfoy Manor, properly delving into casting extensions, and wearing down at Draco's resolve to be all work and no play.
Harry could hear annoyance in the dry witticism of course, but there was something else glinting in gray eyes, some wicked sort of question Harry was not entirely sure he had an answer for.
Draco shot him an exasperated look. “Do I really have to tell you not to talk with your mouth full, Potter?”
As the Saturday he was meant to meet with Draco again approached—Harry felt somewhat more prepared than he had for their meeting the week before. He’d actually practiced this time, and was getting the base Extension spell almost perfect—he thought. He wanted Draco’s input first, as he had a much more critical eye for detail than Harry.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Guess I’ll head home then; I have to be up early tomorrow.” Harry stretched.
“Or by all means, stay. Ruin the evening for everyone.”
Harry fucked him into the mattress chasing his own. The bed shook precariously under them and Draco whimpered, the still-rosy cheeks of his arse taking the brunt of the impact as he pushed up into the deep unrelenting force of Harry’s cock. With a few final rolling thrusts, Harry was groaning and spilling inside under a haze of intense bliss.
“Mind if I give it a go next?” Harry was still very tired, but seeing Draco’s success was invigorating.
“D’you want to go first?”
Without thinking much about it, he sniffed at the bubbles, which smelled distinctly sweet—just before they went directly up his nose. He choked, nearly panicking further when Malfoy began pointing a wand at him, but he only charmed Harry’s nose clear with a wordless flick.
“Hard again, Potter?”
“Are you bringing the lavender soap or not!”
There were two pairs of push lights, four all together, and two packs of markers, with six to each pack. Harry had bought extra in case the spell went horribly wrong, as it was very complex, but he was really hoping he could get it working properly soon.
But he would do it anyway, because people he cared about had asked him to—and because Kingsley could be very persuasive.
“I’m still looking into the specifics, but the real key is to sort out what’s actually needed. No point putting in unnecessary effort on bits and bobs that aren’t essential. Obviously, you need more information. You’re flying blind—you don’t understand the problem enough to solve it.”
Not that either was in any way idyllic
Draco led him past several worktables, mostly neat and clean, but a few had small clusters of bottles and ingredients surrounding full or half-full cauldrons. A couple of the cauldrons were currently simmering under a low heat, and one was expelling a dark blue smoke.
Draco left his trousers and his pants on the sitting room floor and trapped Harry’s hips between his knees on the chair as Harry whispered charms to smooth the press his cock in as quickly as possible.
Harry hesitated in uncertainty again.
Hermione looked at him expectantly, and Ron had taken on a somewhat more somber frown.
The morning they were to meet with Cassie, Draco wore the same sort of well-tailored suit as before, different than the last, as this one was shades of grey instead of black, with a waistcoat and a proper tie this time.
There was not a chance in hell that no one had noticed his absence for all of that time. He should’ve been panicking by now—but the overwhelming shots of bliss and oxytocin still pinging through his system were making it rather difficult for him to be bothered.
They had only managed to get lightly tipsy, hardly a roaring celebration, but now there were more pressing priorities than drinking stupidly expensive firewhisky. For the time being, they left it all behind on the kitchen table.
“Draco—”
“You did ask me to punish you,” he pointed out. “Also your cock seems to like it.”
“For a very good cause.” Harry beamed a bright half-smile at him.
Harry was as reluctant to disentangle from the play of their mouths as he was to disrupt the lust-charged quiet simmering between them, diluted only by slick sounds, heavy gasps and the increasing intensity of Draco’s low moans as he sped to lightly ride Harry’s fingers.
Draco scoffed at his hopelessness. “Straight on past the atrium, three lefts and one right curve, you’ll be in the library wing.”
“Aren’t I here to look at the books?” Harry asked bemusedly.
Harry has to attend the Memorial whether he wants to or not, but his day takes an unexpected turn and a strange potion may just change his life.
He only realised after the fact he’d said ‘yet’ like it was something he planned on doing. Not that he was in any particular hurry to take it back either.
? Harry—you’ve bloody lost it. No reason not to trust him? How about
” Draco protested despondently.
Harry broke first, gasping as his lips parted under the strength of heat, shuddering faintly as it overtook him, pulsing several thick bursts of come over Draco’s hand.
A minty cloud of steam trailed behind as he levitated the tray up the stairwell, and it took a few more minutes to prepare them each a cup. Draco slept the entire time, and eventually Harry had to climb up the bed and lie down beside him, pushing his fingers cautiously through Draco’s hair before he finally stirred.
Kissing him again hard, but without any tongue this time, Draco shifted smoothly to his feet.
“Are you ready to work now?”
The tickling scent of cinnamon drifted Harry’s way, and he found himself watching Malfoy take in a long swallow of the potion. It left a faintly blue stain on his lips, and Harry unconsciously followed the path of Malfoy’s tongue to clear them.
Harry dropped a quiet laugh, biting indulgently at one hard peak before he went on following the trail of honey wherever it led. It
“Er, yes—that is, I think we’ve settled on a good spot, and we have plans for it, but we’re still working out some of the magical logistics. It’ll be much easier to show you than trying to explain it all, but—if you’re still interested, when we’re ready, I’ll be in touch with the push light to plan a time to meet. Hopefully no more than a few weeks or so, roughly.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
They each attempted the spell a few more times. Harry tried expanding the shoebox even more than Malfoy already had, and succeeded, though he also significantly bowed the outside of the box. Momentarily it looked like it might burst as well, but at least it hadn’t got quite as large as the tent. He cancelled his own charm on the tent and let Malfoy have a go—who managed to expand it to the size of a large room, but not quite to the size of a proper house big enough to live in. They’d cancelled it again, and on Harry’s next try he managed to expand it to about the size of a large circus tent.
“You really think we’re likely to come again, after all that?”
“The Repelling Charms should save us that. Ideally, even if they sent someone out to check they’d only forget what they were doing there in the first place.”
Harry groaned tense, his thrusts faltering.
Harry nodded, and took in the scenery whilst he waited for him to finish with the warding. It was quite a pretty locale, though admittedly he was just pleased it looked exactly as described, and wasn’t a creepy graveyard. He appreciated the nature all around them, but there was only so much he could appreciate a mostly empty meadow—and thus he found himself watching Malfoy pace a relatively wide area, murmuring spells and protections, most of them very familiar, though it felt strange to see him doing them.
He couldn’t deny his cock’s desire to be where his fingers were, but Draco looked too much on display for Harry not to take advantage. This was Draco Malfoy, naked and hard and spread out in the middle of what had surely once been his father’s desk, for Harry, apparently.
She watched him a moment longer, reaching across the table to brush a few messy strands back where they obscured his glasses, exposing his scar in the process. “Will you come to bed soon?”
“If you’d like.” Draco’s smirk was small but wicked—just before Harry wiped it away with a penetrating kiss.
Draco sighed. “You can use the shower if you like. It’s the door between the mirrors.”
Harry kept catching the nape of Draco’s neck to kiss at his lips, or bite down his throat, and Draco was momentarily lost in feeling up Harry’s arsecheeks while his pants were still caught around his thighs—but eventually, all pants were removed.
“Quite.”
Draco hummed throatily back. “Let’s shower. If we’re very quick, you can fuck me before we get back to work and I’ll do it again.”
Draco’s books were on the sitting room table again, piled up beside his Muggle tablet full of Harry’s scribbled notes—and a few of Draco’s now too. Harry had taken to keeping all of it in his trunk in the attic, with everything else related to Draco and their plans, but he’d brought them down for today.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
They were on their way back up to the ballroom to finish what remained of the drapes when Draco stopped him in the curvy stone stairway leading up to its corridor.
Harry slipped his back on as well, and shrugged. “I dunno.”
There was an exchanged look of guilt between them that had Harry hurrying to correct himself.
“No, we’re not. Showers first. Separately. I’ll be using the one next-door, there’s far less chance of any distractions that way.”
The Quaffle under Ron’s arm came flying at him and Harry righted his angle to catch it, the impact of its momentum nudging him back in the air a smidge.
“You really fancy ordering me about, don’t you?” he accused wryly.
Draco smirked. “I already have. Twice, actually.”
He shrugged awkwardly while Draco stared at him with narrowed silver eyes, suspicious despite their bleariness.
That drew a real glare from Harry, not only for the jab at his second family, but also for the fact that Malfoy was deliberately missing his point.
“Yes alright, I get it. You hate the venue. You can decide where we’re meeting next, if you’re determined to be so bloody particular about it.”
“I doubt that very much,” Harry teased.
“Tragic,” Draco lamented.
“Saturday, then,” Draco said tartly. “Alright?”
“You’re at a wedding, you must have
It was only as he backed them into the darkened room that it occurred to him, they had never fucked in a bed before.
He wanted to drive Draco closer to the edge with him, but as they were Harry couldn’t get a good angle on the needy cock rubbing against his stomach.
“Let’s say, favours. I satisfy you, you satisfy me. We get on with our lives... satisfied. Does that sound
They were a few ticks late for their meeting, and by the time they returned to the now Dementor-free road the queue had shortened down to nearly naught.
Harry did not end up getting fucked that morning, though Draco did again—against the cold porcelain of his fancy bathtub, and for a rather long time.
He broke off with a quiet gasp when Draco placed a few emphatic bites up his cock through his jeans.
“What are your plans for this evening, Potter?”
Perhaps he hadn't entirely known what he was asking for, but Malfoy had promised satisfaction. Harry needed to know if he meant it.
After they’d eaten it was getting quite late, and Molly retired to bed with hugs all around—including Arthur, who laughed patiently.
He felt somewhat better after he returned home that night as well. Ginny wouldn’t be home until Sunday, and Harry had a couple of days uninterrupted to work on the house and practice some of the spells Draco had assigned him. If he was lucky, he could hold off some of his more betraying thoughts for a little while.
Harry went pink. “Erm.”
“I’m not… only I’m not a heartless bastard, and not everyone’s handed a massive vault of gold when they’re eleven.”
For most of the evening his guilt had been hitting far more intensely than before, in sudden stomach-churning waves whenever he recalled how thoroughly he was lying to them all.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
But then Draco was standing upright, and doing up his trousers.
“Harry,” he laughed. “I hadn’t given you my last name.”
“Am I
“Sleep alright?” he mumbled into his tea.
He’d always been particularly competitive in matters involving Harry, and suddenly the sharpness of his annoyance made a lot more sense. Only now Harry had to think of something to say that wasn’t going to make matters worse.
They sat in the armchair longer than they maybe should’ve kissing and mostly naked, but eventually Draco let him up. They cast a couple charms, cancelled another, and dressed in surprisingly comfortable silence, seeming to have mostly recovered their dignity from all the passion and emotion of the day.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Draco pushed himself upright even as Harry continued fucking him, arching back on him rather gracefully as their hips worked to keep Harry’s cock moving steadily in and out.
Harry’s impatience sparked then, pushing into an unmoving grip—but Draco released him, and shifted up to find his lips instead, hovering just over them with his own. So close, that Harry got a bit lost in the lust darkening silver staring back at him, but he didn’t close the distance between them either—he let Draco draw out his tease.
He'd told Ginny he was going out shopping, and planned a time to meet with Draco when he knew Ginny had plans to be at the Burrow for tea—so that she wouldn’t be around to hear his destination.
When he rolled his hips, shifting the impact of his cock a bit, Draco let out something like a sob of pleasure and Harry only fucked him harder, and more relentlessly.
“Not a chance. I imagine the both of us would be long dead by now, with a slim chance there would even be enough of polite society left to put on a wedding at all.”
Harry eased in just the tip. Draco moaned, and Harry’s cock throbbed watching the first inch of his wand slip in. He waited for the encouraging rock of Draco’s hips before he went in any deeper.
defending Draco to his friends, when Harry was still struggling to justify any sort of forgiveness himself. It wasn’t easy for him to parse, even before adding in the very compelling arguments his hormones were making.
“What sort of bloody project could
Harry understood how that might be confusing for her—given he hadn’t actually told her anything about his conversation with Malfoy the night of the solstice. She hadn’t asked, and he hadn’t been particularly inclined to volunteer any of what went on that night.
Harry was trying to speak as slowly and clearly as he could, still adjusting to consciously speaking the language in the first place. It was nice he didn’t have to keep staring at Draco’s headboard now—that he could look right into the lusty darkness of his eyes and watch Draco writhe as Harry stroked the full length of his cock in tight, purposeful pumps.
In addition to small journal, in which he’d apparently jotted several pages of notes, he’d also brought several large and yellowed looking tomes, of varying sizes and thicknesses. All together the stack stood a bit taller than Harry’s pint glass on the bar top.
Even just waiting there with his arms crossed he was oddly attractive. A multitude of well-familiar idiosyncrasies, from the stiffly impatient tilt of his head to the over-poised set of his shoulders, little things Harry had once found quite profoundly irritating, now he could only think of how thoroughly he’d traced every bare inch with his tongue in the late hours of the night.
In truth, just then, Harry realised Malfoy looked like the most extraordinary thing he had ever seen, and only grew more so with every subtle shudder and arch of him, and every needy spasm of the long cock in his grip.
Draco got on with the whole brushing process very perfunctorily, and kept on a minute more after Harry finished, though he did pause to arch an eyebrow through the mirror—alerting Harry to the fact he’d completely failed at not staring, again.
Sighing as if Harry were spoiling all his fun, Draco gave in. “It’s a sort of fish soup. Halibut, with lemon and herbs and such. I’m sure it’s exquisite, everything here is.”
“—and of course, I’ll owl you with anything relevant that isn’t inherently incriminating. Then perhaps we might meet to compare notes another time.”
What with the privacy charms, the worst that might happen was someone would hear them—so long as Malfoy didn’t start shouting his name it would probably be fine...
“…you want me to?”
Harry snorted. “Not that I believe you really care, but he’s fine. What, no more witty insulting nicknames?”
“That explains a lot,” Draco drawled.
“That does make sense. Would you want to cancel one of the Expansions and start over again or—?”
“You’ve been helping me practise a lot lately.”
“Yes, the wonderfully twisted lines of pureblood ancestry. Thrilling.”
“M’might not have managed to kill him at all, f’it weren’t for you.” He knew Malfoy didn’t know the whole story, few did, but Harry could admit that much to him.
“I’ll be up soon. Promise.”
Draco was riding him backward, the long line of his back arched and sheened with sweat in the late May warmth. Harry couldn’t touch him at all, or anything else, he could only arch up with sweltering need as Draco’s hips worked an irresistibly iniquitous sort of magic on his cock.
“Fuck the neighbours,” Harry whispered.
Harry considered how to phrase his next thought.
his mind supplied unhelpfully.
“Draco…what are you doing?” he asked suspiciously.
As salad went, it wasn’t very good, wilted and notably flavourless. He’d definitely had better, he’d even made better, but he ate it anyway, with the right fork even, and it wasn’t very long before the rest of their meal arrived.
“I—well obviously I don’t want to interfere with your work Mr. Potter. I’m sorry—of course, if it’s that serious, I can keep this to myself. I won’t tell my sister or anyone else that I’ve seen you, er—not that I know anyone else who would
Ron thanked Harry for going flying with him, and Harry thanked him in return for inviting him along. Then Ron said goodnight to his dad and swirled off into the Floo back to his and Hermione’s flat, clutching several covered plates of food.
Draco had put on another pair of silky pyjama bottoms, black ones this time, and he was again sitting in one of his chairs by the fire.
Regrettably, when they finally got to their destination, it was far too small and oddly shaped.
“Well I haven’t turned green or anything yet.”
Harry leant over him enough to trace the tip of his tongue up the length of Draco’s cock and when Draco gasped pleasurably and arched toward his mouth, he did it again only longer, and using more of his tongue.
“Sounds like a regular Death Eater tea party,” Draco interjected.
“Oh god,” he gasped, slowly coming to an awareness of exactly how hard he was—and how good it felt to be caught under a perfectly wicked friction.
It was only the place where he’d once briefly died, after all.
trading cards! We were hoping you would agree to speak with us about them.”
“Why do you ask, Potter? Would you get some sort of sick revenge kick if I told you that it was?”
They went over again some of what they had covered in their last meeting, and Draco caught him up on what might be relevant in the books he had already leant him.
Between the two of them they had nearly emptied a full tray of peachy-cinnamon glasses, which might’ve been a clue to avoid serious discussions, yet Harry felt the protests stubbornly rising in him. He also quite enjoyed the mildly horrified look he received when he made a point to prod the very tip of Malfoy’s nose in the middle of a party full of Ministry workers.
“You mentioned layers of spells but—what sort of spells do you mean?”
Probably he should’ve walked away then. He didn’t, though he did give voice to a small spike of annoyance.
Harry was doing what he did most Mondays—paperwork of the most mind-dulling sort, a whole week’s worth backed up in piles on his desk—when something very unexpected happened.
Draco gasped relief when Harry carefully pulled the wand free of him, still humming and slightly slick.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry raced back down several minutes later, having also changed out of his work clothes into jeans and a tighter than his usual shirt. Draco seemed to like him in Muggle clothes, even if he complained about them.
When he stopped to wait, leaning at the doorway to the bedroom and still delightfully naked, he was already a touch hard. Harry was too when he joined him, capturing saucily smirking lips to kiss them as he pressed Draco briefly to the wooden edge. Draco’s moan was beguilingly stunning when their cocks bumped together in the teasing shift of their hips—as such, it took them a few more minutes before they even made it into the bathroom.
Someone had been kind enough to transfigure a blanket for him. He could feel the telltale tingle of another person’s residual magic around him as he sat upright, a new skill he had been picking up from one of his Auror classes. When he cancelled the spell, a small leaf floated down into his lap in its place.
Ginny was looking at him with familiar exasperation.
Despite his slight dishevelment, the arching of his eyebrow was composed.
"I couldn't tell you. It all sounds very ambitious, which I can appreciate, but also very charitable, which I cannot. Saving the Elves not enough for your lot? Now you've got to save all the Muggles as well?"
” Draco gasped shock when Harry pressed his tongue in deeper.
He went for his glasses first, and the mug second.
Harry's having some strange dreams, and with so much on his plate, it's all becoming a bit much to take.
Malfoy went quiet, seeming to gather his thoughts.
“Will your skin be alright without all that fancy silk?” Harry teased hoarsely.
“The Weasel bitch doesn’t know?”
Harry lined himself up. As he pressed in past the tip, he braced his palms on the desk, giving him the leverage needed to try driving in deeper.
He also apparently really needed to go shopping, but he had what he needed to make up a couple of cheese and pickle sandwiches. Draco looked at his with extreme suspicion, but he ate it anyway.
“I can see
“Sounds alright,” Harry agreed easily, the quirk of his lips a little knowing, before he was heading for the hearth. “I’ll see you then.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“I hope you aren’t expecting me to politely refuse.” Good or not, Harry rarely turned down the offer of firewhisky these days.
He had no idea if Draco cared at all about the end result of their efforts, but Harry still very much did, and wasn’t going to give up on the idea now.
Draco hummed a sort of agreement, staring emotionlessly at his water glass before he seemed to snap himself out of it with a faint sneer. “Far less sadistic. …Anyway, beyond the occasional public event I haven’t seen her in ages—the last time we were here was just before third year. I distinctly remember them discussing Black’s escape.”
Straightening up with a victorious half-grin, he shrugged surrender. “Fuck it then. Do your worst.”
“You’re not as subtle without your bloody cloak,” Malfoy drawled.
He felt awful for lying at all, but he also knew there was no better option. Telling the truth was obviously completely off the table.
, fucking god.”
Unfortunately, it became clear after only a few minutes that both Weasleys were very immersed in sorting out whatever it was that needed sorting. Rather than torture himself any longer, Harry made his excuses, deciding he had been at the ball long enough now that it was time to examine the beverages on offer.
Harry blew out a slow breath and tried to find the brain to reply when he was
“The biggest alteration would be in what triggers the jinx, and the ensuing consequences—then we would need to limit it significantly, so that it applied only to those who’ve passed through the enchantments of...wherever we’re doing this. Ideally then, it would require a more reasonable amount of power to cast. If we, or—really, if
Harry usually did his own, and had since he was very small, excepting the time he’d spent at Hogwarts and the Burrow. At least he now had magic to help—though he was pretty shit at folding charms, only slightly better at them than he was folding by hand. He often left it all unfolded, but it was still one of the few chores he kept up with in the house, much more diligently than he did the dusting in any case.
“Alright. Place it here, I’ll give it a shot.”
Instead, Harry reached out to pull him closer, palming one sharp cheek to kiss him with a quietly muffled moan. Draco pressed in and kissed him back, fitting warmly to his front, and as thin as the silk was he might as well have been naked.
They kissed minty and lingering, both moaning their impatience when Harry rubbed forward a little more firmly.
“…Thanks.”
“I’ve spoken with some people in London,” he cut right to the heart of the matter.
Ron was attempting to keep up, so Hermione broke it down for him in a hushed voice while Harry hid in his wine glass.
“Haven’t you? You’re doing it now.”
Expelling Harry’s name among a sea of curses, Draco broke off groaning as Harry pushed his cock over the swell of his pleasure centre, thrusting a smoothly continuous pressure.
Draco had left him perched on the arch of a spindle-backed chair in the tent’s kitchen, and he hopped about, hooting brightly as Harry approached to get on with unfastening the letter.
Harry pressed up for another kiss and they moaned working their hips together forcefully—but then Harry broke the rules, teasing his fingers beneath the back hem of Draco’s bottoms, tracing between his cheeks and on to touch and press at the hidden pucker of his arse.
“Mmm,” Draco harmonised, thrusting eagerly into his grip.
“It’s a potions lab. Mine, in fact,” Draco drawled dryly.
“Eyes on the parchment, Potter. Stop me if I’ve missed anything.”
He dangled the spoon over Draco’s cock, drizzling lazily and watching it stiffen at his pronouncement. He made sure to get his bollocks and a bit of his thighs—but the spoon was nearly out of honey now.
After he finished up, Harry’d had enough waiting, and became rather preoccupied rubbing against the tempting rise of his arse.
. I’m going to be late.”
Harry let Draco enchant the sheets to change themselves, and only stopped kissing him when all was fitted crisply into place and the bed was fresh and clean for them. His lips throbbed exquisitely in the aftermath, yet contrarily they missed the hard press of Draco’s.
“Cocky git,” Harry muttered, but he also made it through the rest of breakfast without staining his shirt again.
“I’ve got it,” Harry countered. “I asked you out, didn’t I?”
Draco shoved him back hard against a grimy brick wall, and kissed him with rather brutal force.
“A whole twenty years, Potter. You’re an old man.”
“You’re utterly shameless sometimes, you do know that?”
“You are not.” He plopped down on Draco’s posh modern settee, which was much more comfortable than it appeared to be. “Come here.”
Harry decided to walk back to town, and said his goodbyes to Arthur as well before he carried on down the road with his broom and his own plate of leftovers.
“Not terribly fluently, but Mother and I also fancy shopping in Paris occasionally, and I've spent a few summers there. I’ve picked up enough to read a menu.”
“Four or five, at least.”
Harry watched him agilely slip over the arm of the chair, falling into the dark indigo of its cushioned seat. Without breaking the lock of green and silver, Draco rested his heels flat to the chair’s cushion, and shifted his arse much closer to the edge.
, apparently not,” he purred in twisted tease.
“Bed,” Draco murmured, briefly catching his lower lip in a less-than-gentle bite.
“Try not to let the house get filthy again,” she warned. “Dusting spells are your friend.”
“Draco.”
” Draco’s voice went a pitch higher, Harry’s relentlessness forcing him past a breaking point.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Draco huffed a soundless laugh, and Harry watched the flush blooming high at his cheekbones—but it was quite hard to look away when their eyes locked again, a profound sort of desire brewing between them, like a thread pulled taut.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry got a bit lost reexploring the taste of his tongue. Finding he couldn’t pull out very far without losing the tension keeping them so close, he worked his cock in a quickening shallow rhythm, all his force in his impact. Draco pushed back into everything Harry gave, his moans reverberating into Harry’s mouth at each rough shock of their meeting hips.
Cassie looked fairly incredulous, and her smile when it came around was tentative at best. “I hope so too, Mr. Potter. We’ll take all the help we can get here, and I’ll do whatever I can to help your case.”
“…I believe earlier you mentioned something about returning a favour.”
fuck, Potter that’s enough—” he hissed.
Harry resisted the urge to groan. “Probably a good idea,” he conceded reluctantly.
“Not since the other night—”
He reaffirmed Harry was comfortable with the first layers, before he added on all the spell modifications he had perfected since the last time. It took them several hours to work through it before they could move on to discussing the particulars—such as how many tents they would need to enchant, how many they could fit at the site, if it was too risky to use magic to squeeze in more, and what the best illusions were to make them all appear to be proper houses inside and out.
Propping himself on one forearm left his hand free to pin Draco’s hips firm to the mattress to thrust into him. Which turned out to be necessary, because every time he slid deep Draco writhed against the mattress, trying to push back on his cock—but he soon discovered if he fucked down hard and quickly enough, Draco didn’t have the time or space to push back.
“We’ll also need your discretion regarding everything we’re about to tell you. Part of our strategy will involve using magic to help, and it’s a delicate process,” Draco added.
Unfortunately, Ginny looked a bit frustrated. Harry chewed his lip anxiously.
“Are you sure you really want to? I get the impression you like messing it up even more.”
“Oh yes. Stephen.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Honestly, he might’ve been a Hufflepuff he was so perpetually cheerful, but he was very fit. I’m shocked you remember him when I barely do.”
As always, he wanted him quite badly, but as always they grew so preoccupied snogging he lost time in the sultry squirm of Draco’s arse in his lap, working a skillfully taunting friction on his cock. Harry only wanted to pull him closer, it was Draco who finally broke the heated wet tangle of their mouths.
Harry bit him until his teeth left marks behind, and proceeded then to fuck him, right there in the kitchen.
“Er, also, I had hoped you might have an idea what sorts of things we might need to get started. I know for sure some sort of first aid, other emergency type things, er, towels, extra supplies and that sort of thing. I can get whatever it is, I’ll just need a little guidance on what I’m getting.”
