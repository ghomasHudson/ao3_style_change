Severus stared in shock at what had happened. He stared at the colorful wings before him for a moment before checking on Harry to see if he was alright. Harry was again unconscious, probably from the pain.
After a minute of just breathing, Hayden went to grab the soap to wash his hair but was stopped when he heard a knock come from the closed door.
Hayden started to do more things for his father and the cause they served. It wasn't long before Hayden was as feared by the followers as the Dark Lord himself.
Lazily looking at the room he wasn't in, he realized that he was in his bedroom in Riddle Manor. Thankfully, whoever put him there (most likely his father) had the good sense to light a fire in the fireplace by his work desk.
"Let me explain. Sometimes when a person, mainly only wizards, is in a life or death situation they can communicate with others. It's a study that has yet to be explained, but I had heard you calling out for help. I only regret it took me so long. I came to see what was wrong and saw you had been beaten, almost to death, so I took you here so you can heal" Snape explained.
As quietly as he could he shut the door and turned on the water, hoping that he wouldn't wake Draco.
Hayden breathed in relief as he felt the warmth surround him again. Smiling, he looked over to his father who was still looking forward as if he had never done a thing.
He laid down the length of the seat, his back up against the wall of the coach, and fell into a light doze. Unfortunately his peace seemed to only last for a couple minutes as he could soon hear voices outside of his compartment.
"Alright, thank you! I really appreciate you taking the time to explain this all to me. I'd be completely lost without it!" the younger said with a small smile, reaching forwards to hug his mother.
"What a lucky person this is then. Please, allow me to escort you there so you are not alone in your journey" Viktor said in his thick accent.
Hayden watched the two Gryffindors go, some of the tension weighing him down lifted from his shoulders.
Once she walked out of the kitchen, Harry hobbled over to the list on the floor and slowly picked it up. Once he had the list in his hands he stuffed it into his pocket and headed out into the dinning room.
For most of the reception nobody bothered him. Everyone was too worried about themselves and making sure they didn't mess up in front of the higher powered Death Eaters.
Hayden finished the letter, smiling at how sweet Draco is. He folded the letter back up and set it next to him on the bed before standing and heading over to the bathroom for a shower.
“I wasn’t hurt if that’s what you're asking. Calm down Draco, you sound like you plan on murdering someone!” Hayden said with a chuckle before realizing Draco was completely serious.
Hayden woke feeling warm and safe. He opened his eyes slowly, thankful for the dim light. The first thing he saw when waking up was the color green. He looked around and soon deducted that he was in his room in Slytherin.
Once everyone had arrived and it was time for the lesson to start, she announced that the class was going to be doing partner work and that she was going to pick who worked with who.
Hayden moaned into the kiss, making Draco smile into the kiss. Not a moment later though, Hayden decided to be bold and licked at Draco's lips, asking for entrance.
Hayden looked for a possible way to escape while the two argued but found that the aisle was too narrow and that he wouldn’t be able to get past either men without bumping into one of them. Hayden sighed, he didn’t want to be dealing with all this so soon to bed time.
Not even fighting the urge, Draco lifted his hand and gently ran his fingers over the soft feathers protruding from the raveonettes back.
Looking around, he wasn't impressed. It was cramped and everything looked rundown and old and rather messy.
When he opened the door, he was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a cozy little bedroom with its own fireplace and a mountain of blankets on a circular bed.
"Here's an idea, how about you all leave and I can finally go to sleep" Hayden sassed, wanting some peace and quiet before he has to deal with school.
Hayden thought. He doesn't wear jewelry too often (mainly because he doesn't really have any), so Draco couldn't be talking about a jewelry store.
"T-thanks" Hayden muttered as he blushed slightly from embarrassment. "I guess I was a more tired than I thought"
"Sure, if he's your 'best friend' then where is he? Are you two suddenly too good for him?" Draco joked with an irritable undertone.
Many miles away, a certain black haired man was getting ready to leave a cauldron to set over night when he heard a faint voice call for help.
What was he supposed to do now? He didn’t even know where Hayden was in the first place and now he had to wait a whole week and half just to be able to set things straight?
Once in the kitchen, he leaned up against one of the counters, trying to steady himself as he attempted to stand. After a few seconds of catching his breath, he grabbed a dish rag and hurried back out to where the mess was so he could clean it up.
When Draco finally entered the common room, he was met with the glares of the few Slytherins who were in the room and not in their dorms. One of them being Blaise, who walked right up to him.
"Of course I'm worried! Now send him in before I have second thoughts and tell you both to leave!" Tom said impatiently.
Once he had calmed down, Severus had continued to keep a hold of the man in his arms, and Tom was grateful for it.
“I'm just trying to be friendly. I might be able to help you out with the class too!” Cedric insisted with a smile that showed no ounce of happiness in it.
Hayden confidently walked up to the stool and sat down. A second later, he felt the hat being placed on his head. The hat began to talk to Hayden.
Giving the ravenette one more kiss on his head, he walked back to his own side of the room, willing his wings away at the same time.
His uncle hit him again, this time Harry fell to the floor. Vernon kicked him hard in the side over and over again until Harry was sure that he could feel a crack forming in one of his ribs.
By the time Hayden was finally walking out of the library, he was taking his hand back and saying a quick thank you to Viktor before turning to walk to Slytherin.
I really should be working on my exegesis but I wanted to get something out to you all. The next chapter will be longer, I promise!
“Wait” the Bulgarian called out after him, “it would be rude of me to leave you here by yourself. Please, the least I can do is escort you back to your common room”
"There is no need for you to call me sir, you may call me Sev" Severus replied, knowing he might not be comfortable with any parental terms yet. "Are you alright Harry?"
He started to fill the bathtub with warm water before stripping out of his clothes and stepped in, letting himself finally completely relax after the stressful last couple days.
"I am telling the truth, and he is staying with me," Severus replied. Tom was so happy that he started to tear up, without even thinking, he scooped the black haired man in a tight hug.
She led him to a small room in the back of the store where a desk and chair sat with various jewels strewn about the table and a mirror in front. Pansy sat him down in front of the mirror and stood behind him.
Hayden looked at him not knowing what to expect. His father reached a hand toward him, ignoring the boys flinch and roughly grabbing him by the neck.
Turning on the lights, Draco frantically looked everywhere, in the closet, in the bathroom, even under the beds.
He took a deep breath to try and calm himself before opening the door, hoping that the other boy was in the common room, but the raven had no such luck.
"I am sure you are all wondering why I called you all here today" Voldemort began, "Many years ago I had a child who was taken from me. A-"
Draco had never felt such panic as he did in this moment. He was frantically looking over all the castle and still no luck.
[ Sorry guys, time skip. I can't figure out what to write for this part. Basically, Hayden finds Severus and he gets permission to leave Hogwarts for a week and a half, you can imagine what they tell the school, and goes to Riddle Manor.]
"Lets wake him up," Hayden said, a dangerous glint shining in his eyes as his plan was finally coming together.
"Now," Pansy started again after a minute or two. "We obviously can't have you walking around Hogsmeade with a crown. We don't want you to get mugged or anything do we! So instead, we have a compromise" She said as she took off the crown and placed it in a black velvet box before shrinking it and handing it to Hayden.
Hayden woke up the next morning feeling, strangely, well rested and relaxed. He had a faint memory of the nightmare he had last night, from what he remembered, it wasn't pleasant. So, why does he feel so safe?
So this specific story is coming to end soon! There's probably only going to be a couple chapters left although I don't know the exact number. I have been toying with the idea of making this a series but I don't know what the next storyline would be yet. Anyway, let me know your thoughts!
"I know you're awake. Come on out, I promise I won't hurt you. You'll be alright." Harry heard the oddly familiar voice say. He could've sworn it was Professor Snape, but that was impossible, he hated him! Harry felt the bed dip down as the person sat beside him. "It's alright, I won't hurt you" the person reiterated as they began to pull back blankets so Harry could see him. Harry was so confused at that moment, it was Professor Snape! But, why?
He was sad that Harry had to go this, at such a young age and all alone no doubt. Severus had made a decision, he was going to try and help the small boy before him by first healing him of his wounds. Severus gently picked him up and apperated  back at Spinner's End.
Hayden spent most of the morning in the library. He had found a secluded little spot that looked comfortable enough, so he took one of his course books and started to read through the material. Better get a head start on his classes.
“We were all beginning to wonder if you were ever going to come back” the man joked, continuing to walk further down the aisle of books to be closer to Hayden.
you have done to that poor boy?" Severus asked, honestly rather astounded that his godson could be oblivious.
“Hayden has been given permission to leave the school for a while and won't be back until the end of next week” Severus said shortly.
"Because this is something Hayden has to do whether you like it or not! Now calm yourself down or I'll hex you!" Blaise threatened.
As the goblin began the incantation, Harry started to feel a bit dizzy and unsteady on his feet. Suddenly a bolt of pain wracked through his body again and again until he finally passed out from the pain.
Draco looked away from Hayden, trying to reassure himself that Hayden was right and he was just being overly protective. He couldn't help his Veela instincts though! He constantly wanted to protect Hayden and make sure he was safe from everything that could pose as harmful!
He sat on the edge of the bed and admired the sleeping raven laying beside him. He brought his hand up to his face and brushed his bangs out of the way of his closed eyes and laid a small kiss on his forehead.
His pale skin seemed to have grown even paler, almost ashen gray. His once vibrant jewel toned eyes were dull and faded. There was just nothing there. It almost scared Draco just how emotionless Hayden looked.
"Yes, I believe it is. I do have one question though before you go. Have you found the clue the egg hides yet?"
"You bastard" Draco snarled, he had no idea why he hadn't ripped out the red-heads throat yet. Little did he know that the answer was standing behind him.
As Griphook watched he couldn't help but feel a little emotional that a family had been brought back together again.
"How do you think you came around?" Sev simply said. Hayden blushed in embarrassment. He didn't really want to have this talk but he guessed it was better to get it over with now rather than when it's too late.
He hadn't told his parents what had happened at the Malfoy Manor. He hadn't told anyone in fact, he only told Hedwig, who had blessedly followed him from the Durselys.
Hayden watched him go, muttering a quiet good night that he wasn’t sure was heard or not. The only thing he could seem to do was stand there in shock.
"Why should I tell you?" Hayden asked back, not wanting to give them too much information about his new life.
With that he walked straight through the portrait and into their dorm, locking it so Draco couldn't get in.
In the end, Draco had to help Hayden into his pajamas before burying him underneath the blankets on the bed.
"The Durmstrang Champion is, Viktor Krum!" The rest of the hall applauded, Draco seemed pleased at this.
For most of the meeting Lucius Malfoy couldn't seem to stop glancing over at the new addition to the Deatheater ranks and his Lord's son.
"Are you okay?" a voice asked, shaking Draco from his thoughts. He hadn't realized he had been starting.
Draco glared at them, trying to hide the emotion, but Hayden could tell that the blonde obviously didn't want the all girl school there. He wondered why.
Harry was brought out of his thoughts by the sound of heavy footsteps climbing the stairs. He braced himself as the door to his room was slammed open and then immediately slammed shut again.
When Draco turned back around to unpack more from his truck, Hayden noticed that his shirt was unbuttoned, showing off his pale, but toned upper body.
When Harry looked in the mirror he was surprised to see that the wings were not the only things that changed about him!
Harry held out his hand as Hedwig dropped something in his palm. Taking his hand back, Harry saw that Hedwig had brought him a pretty little green hued rock.
He was grateful though. He was glad that he is able to experience these normal family moments that he never knew of until his inheritance.
"You prick! You know that Harry's been missing since the beginning of the year!" Weasley yelled, his face turning as red as his head.
"Wow, that's amazing! Can I ask, what type are you?" Draco asked boldly. Hayden blushed before answering.
"Oh, of course you didn't!" She smirked, winking at the boy like she knows something. "Everyone loves a rebel Hay!" She laughed while Hayden scowled.
“Hey, stop that” Hayden admonished, “It's not your fault that the Gryffindor's are overly nosey and push themselves into everyone's business. You are not to blame, so stop blaming yourself!”
He opened his eyes once more, turning his head to look at the intricate cuffs that Pansy had placed on both his ears.
The pain stopped and his mare walked up to him, crouching down in order to meet his eyes. "I can't believe that i'm tied to a worthless little mess up like you. Your a pawn, a fool, and that's all you'll ever be. You should've known that nobody can ever love you, much less stand to be in your presence"
"Oh, h-hi Luna" Hayden greeted nervously. Honestly, he felt a little bad. He had seen Luna around the halls and in a few of his classes, but he hadn't made the attempt to talk to her at all yet this year.
"Come in," he called. He looked at the door as it opened and saw his father walk through. "You look beautiful," Tom compliant. Hayden looked down at himself and blushed.
"Draco, I love you too! There's nothing I would love more than to say yes you, but I... I have something to tell you that will most definitely change the way you look at me" Hayden admitted, tears welling in his eyes.
A couple hours later found Hayden sitting in bed while holding the egg in his lap, just thinking and staring at it, trying to figure it out.
Hayden couldn't believe the audacity of the man. He was actually trying to take advantage of him. Talk about giving Hufflepuff's a bad name. Thankfully he knew most of them before and knew they were some of the sweetest kids in the school.
Draco smiled, cupping his face. "I should be the one thanking you" he said, wiping away the tears Hayden didn't know were even there.
Again the cup turned red, ready to give the last name. By this point Hayden was successfully distracted from his nerves.
Once the butter was melted and distributed around the pan, he started to make the eggs and bacon that he would serve for breakfast.
Hayden nodded at the information. He figured it made sense though, he was also pretty sure that some of this was already happening with how Draco reacted to him being in the Tournament. He stayed silent as he listened to Sev continue.
Draco had really messed up, hadn't he? The thing was, he had no idea what he was supposed to do to fix it.
"Wait, do you know who they are?" Hayden asked quickly, eyes wide in anticipation. The more he thought of having a mate who would love and care for him, the more appealing the idea was to him. He was excited.
I don't even know if there is a plot anymore, I'm just writing whatever fits next it the story! I sincerely hope this story makes sense!
Once he had finished packing all his clothes and school supplies, he strapped his trunk and made his way down to the dining hall for dinner.
Severus quickly jumped awake at the noise, thinking someone else was in the house besides himself and Harry, but calmed down when he saw that Harry had just fallen when trying to stand. He went over to the boy and helped up while asking what he was doing up at this hour.
Once again, he did. He felt her hands gently move his shoulder length hair behind his ears and cold metal being slipped on around them.
While Harry was watching the words form on the paper, Severus didn't dare look at the document for fear of disappointment in what he might see.
When the two were done, Hayden went to make his way outside to try and figure out where Draco wanted him to go.
Draco groaned at the feeling, but kept his mouth closed, smiling when he heard Hayden whine in disappointment. Draco finally gave in though when he felt one of Hayden's hands comb through his hair.
"I'm here" Severus assured. After Hayden had calmed down they released the hug and looked at each other.
Tomorrow would be his birthday, but he didn't think much of it, other than the fact that he would be turning 14. He looked at his alarm clock by his bed and saw that it was already 11:58 pm.
"I kinda did forget, though" the raven muttered as the blonde sat him down on his bed. "Anyway, in response to your question earlier, yeah, I do have creature blood"
"Your attention, please!" Dumbledore called, effectively quieting the excited chatter of the Great Hall. "I'd like to say a few words"
“I was wondering if, um- maybe if you had the time, could you possibly teach me how to dance?” Hayden mumbled, face flushing red with embarrassment that he had to ask.
Draco smiled, happy that Hayden had seemed to have forgiven him. He's going to have to work hard though to make sure he doesn't say the wrong thing in the future and this doesn't happen again.
At first he wanted to ignore the call, but the black haired man felt a sudden need to go and see what was wrong with the boy calling out to him.
Hayden had always liked Hogsmede, Honeydukes included. The entire place just seemed to always have such an inviting and friendly atmosphere that he could enjoy being in.
He followed the Slytherin, hopeful that they might know what he was supposed to do or maybe just help him find the place he has to go to!
Hayden studied Viktor for a moment before hesitantly agreeing with the thought that the only peaceful way out of this situation would be to take his hand.
"It's you we don't know! Heh, you're the juicy news. What quarks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks? What mysteries do those muscles mask? Does courage lie beneath those curls? In short what makes a Champion tick?" She asked as she walked around to Cedric and Hayden.
They mainly walked in silence. Every once in a while one would say something, but it was never anything important, just words to fill the space. Surprisingly enough, the walk wasn't all entirely awkward, it was strangely pleasant. The only thing that might have been awkward was the soft looks Victor would give him when the taller thought he wasn't looking.
"I'm sorry, did I give you permission to speak?" Hayden said, a hard glare freezing his three classmates in their spots.
Harry thought. Just as he was distributing the breakfast onto three separate plates, the Dursleys came down for breakfast.
"She may not look it, but she is. She's ruthless, just like most others from the school" Draco told him.
Finally, Draco seemed to break out of his anger induced haze and looked at Hayden. The shy and sobbing boy in front of him was a sad sight indeed. He almost confesses his love to this boy too.
After showing the Goblet of Fire and telling the students that the Tournament had begun, we had all been excused. Some stayed to finish their food, but most left to go back to their dorms, including Hayden and Draco.
He slowly sat up, letting himself wake back up before he started the strenuous task of trying to stand up.
Of course Hayden would love to leave this situation and get back to Draco, but he didn’t necessarily want to accept  Viktor’s hand.
"I met my mate and he finally confessed to me," Hayden said blankly. Severus paused at the lack of emotion that Severus might've expected from his son just meeting his forever partner.
Hayden had a couple tears streaming down his cheeks. He smiled up at his father. He had never heard anything so heartfelt before, and it was for him. He hugged his father one more time before letting go. "I love you dad!"
His eyes widened in surprise when he saw two big gold feathered wings connected to his back. He stared in shock.
Reaching out, he put his hands on Hayden's arms, rubbing them up and down, as you would a child. Hayden laughed as he did so causing Draco to laugh as well.
"Because I trust you and I would like to prepare you to take my place someday. Of course only if you want it, I would never force this on you" Tom added quickly at the end.
“Fine I guess, why?” Hayden asked back with an air of caution, ever so slightly curious as to why she would care.
Hayden felt his father's hand come to rest on his shoulder as Voldemort continued on with any other important business that needed to be attended to.
Hayden was weary of meeting these people. Not only had he already met these people, he had fought with them.
Hayden walked back down to his fathers about 15 minutes later, his new mask secured to the hip of his pants by magic in case he needed it.
"You are a disgrace! No wonder no cares for you, you freak! You're a burden!" Vernon yelled, as he undid his belt.
An hour and a half later, Hayden finished and had tuckered himself out. It was only midday but he had already exhausted himself.
"Um, I kinda like Hayden" the boy mumbled, his voice still thick with tears. Sev smiled and squeezed him tighter.
Harry ate a little bit of the food that was brought to him, but couldn't eat much. When he was full he set the tray on the nightstand and laid back down onto the bed. He was sure that Professor Snape wouldn't mind if he took another nap.
Hayden just started crying again as he felt his mother's tight embrace around him, keeping him safe. He couldn't be more grateful.
Hayden was a bit shocked he hadn't recognized Pansy and even more so when she practically dragged him away from the small crowd in the store.
"Alright, thank you Draco" Hayden said as he walked out. He's never felt happier than he did in that moment!
Draco gasped in surprise as he unceremoniously hit the mattress, but his surprise quickly turned to amusement once Hayden curled into him.
Hayden took it and placed it in his pocket. "Now close your eyes again" the Slytherin girl once again demanded.
"Draco, i'm not,... We've k-known each f-for a couple years n-now" Hayden stuttered, hoping that this all turns out well.
“What do you think we should do about your little discipline problem, hmm?” Cedric whispered into his ear before starting to lean down even farther, all while Hayden reached further into his sleeve where his wand was hidden. Just before Cedric could get to his neck, though, they were thankfully interrupted.
Severus led Hayden over to his bedroom so that they could have a more private setting to talk in, just in case someone were to walk through the portrait.
Towards the end of the reception, Hayden wandered towards the edge of the hall and slipped into a side room to get away from the crowd for a minute.
It took him a couple minutes to take the wards down but was soon done and was able to open the door.
He set the plates down in front of them. "Go fetch us something to drink, freak!" Petunia screeched.
Hayden peeked out from behind the bush to try and find the other people. After a moment, he found the three people whispering in the other side of the room, slightly behind one of the two bookcases. Hayden briefly wondered how the three didn't notice him enter the room.
“Oh” was all he said, signaling he was done talking before turning back to the teacher who was handing out different objects to each pair of partners.
Hayden stayed quiet, not wanting the others in the room to be able to recognize any part of him, even his voice. He was glad that Tom hadn't revealed that he was a boy. He had a suspicion that everyone probably thought he was a girl by the way he was dressed, and he'd rather keep that illusion than tell them who he was. He'd rather not trust them with that type of information, yet anyway.
After a moment, Severus gave the crying boy next to him a hug, not exactly sure what else to do. Harry leaned back into the hug, melting into the man's arms.
As Draco and Hayden were walking back to their dorm that night, Draco was thinking of possible ways of getting Hayden out of the tournament.
Soon enough classes were done for the day and the students were all back in the dorm after dinner. Not too long after, Severus came to talk with all the Slytherins about the dance.
"Now, I'm sure you know you're here for a reason. Close your eyes" Pansy demanded, a hint of excitement in her voice.
Draco smiled, wishing he could just hug the other before squashing that desire and heading towards the dungeons.
Harry looked at his wings again, this time with eyes filled of wonder. "Do they stay out all the time? How am I going to hide them when school starts?" Harry asked.
Most of the students milled about the common room before heading to their respective dorms. Hayden walked down the stairs that led to the fourth year dorms which were located below the common space.
He was angry towards the muggles Harry had to live with and angry at Dumbledore for subjecting the boy to this year after year! Surely he must've known that this was happening!
“You know, you could’ve asked me to get on the bed instead of pushing me down” Draco smirked as he positioned himself so he was leaning up on his forearm.
Please don't hesitate to tell me if you want to see something specific or I've unknowingly forgotten something you want to finished! I love having feedback!
"Get started with breakfast and then get your chores done" Petunia said, looking down at the boy in front of her as she put her hands on her hips. "I expect you to be done by lunch."
Looking around the room for the source of the noise, he spotted a window over by the far wall. An owl stood there patiently knocking its beak against the glass as it tried not to crush the letter attached to its leg.
Hayden sat next to Draco, he began to feel nervous, like something was about to happen, but he had no idea what!
Out of pure instinct, Draco gently sat down beside the sleeping boy on the bed. While running his fingers carefully through the soft, gold feathers, the blonde leaned down to kiss the top of Hayden's head and gently nuzzled the side of his face.
Hayden reluctantly scooted himself to the edge of the nest/bed, one of the blankets wrapped snugly around him. He went to stand on his legs, but as soon as he shifted his weight forward, his legs buckled and collapsed underneath him sending him toppling down to the cold floor.
"What!?" Draco exclaimed, yanking his arm away from the fifth year and sprinting all the way back to the Slytherin dorms.
Harry woke up to a quiet knocking sound at his window. He jolted a little at the noise, not realizing at first what it was, but after facing the window, he saw his snowy white owl patiently waiting to be let into the room.
A couple days before, Hayden was going over his strategy and making sure it was solidified as well as many other side plans in case something went wrong. He wasn't too worried though. At the moment, his main problem was trying to figure out what he was going to wear.
"What do you plan to do?" Hayden responded quietly, following Draco's lead by leaning forward a bit.
"Oh what do you know, absolutely nothing?" Granger said, her bushy shaking as she vibrated with poorly hidden rage.
"Has everything you've told me then been a lie?" Draco asked, a pained sort of anger lacing his venomous tone. "Have you been glamouring yourself all this time? I bet you're not even a creature, you've just been playing me for a fool, well I hope you've had fun manipulating my emotions like this"
Viktor followed Hayden down to the dungeons and to the portrait leading to his common room. The ravenette briefly entertained the idea of confronting the other about him seeing his wings, but eventually decided against. He was exhausted and just didn't want to deal with it at the moment. He would have to talk with him later.
Hayden's favorite part of the outfit was the sleeves, he thought it looked regal. He was also really happy that the dress had a back to it. He didn't feel quite comfortable in an outfit that was backless.
"Come with me" She led him to where all the other first years were waiting patiently to be sorted. Not many paid too much attention to him when he joined them, other the occasional stare from those he knew would most likely be sorted into Slytherin.
When he walked into his dorm last night, he was completely entranced by watching his roommate. He had no idea why, but he just could take his eyes off him.
"I have learned, though, that there is much more to your life than I ever knew about, and as much as I am curious about it, I won't push you. But I do hope that one you can confide in me. I may not have always been the nicest person to be around-" Hayden scoffed "-alright, I was almost never nice, but I am trying to make up for it now. Hayden, call me crazy, but I feel a connection to you and that is why it would absolutely kill me to see you get hurt. Will you please accept my apology and understand that I will always do my best to make sure that nothing bad ever happens to you?"
“Because we’ve been listening to you whining for the past month. I think we’ve figured out exactly what you’re looking for.” Blaise said with a smile. There was something knowing in that smile, but Harry wasn’t sure if he was just imagining it.
“And you know what, I’ve caught him burning the letters he received yesterday and today. He didn’t even read them. In Transfiguration class today, he was so busy looking daggers at the back of Potter’s head that he didn’t even notice that Millicent had accidentally transfigured her fingers into slugs beside him. And bloody hell, I even heard Potter calling out to him after class. Calling him by his first name, even. Do you think —”  Before she could finish her sentence, Draco came out from his room.
Harry smiled back in return and gestured at the chair opposite him, indicating Draco to have a seat. There was a moment of awkward silence, broken only by a waiter coming to their table with the menus. Harry eagerly jumped at the chance to hide behind his menu, his heart still beating quite fast because it was Draco Malfoy sitting in front of him. Draco. His Draco.
The fourth date was with a girl, definitely not too polite like the one before, was the right height and had perfectly straight long hair. She was almost perfect. Almost.
Harry hugged Hermione back, and slowly the memories of the past few weeks flooded back to him. He remembered Voldemort was dead... and Harry had nearly died as well. Or had he actually died... and then come back?
Six months went by before Harry had built up the courage to climb back up to the Astronomy Tower. As he lay down on the cold, hard floor, he thought about how this was the first time in a long time that he had been up here without Draco by his side.
“No! Oh no, Harry! It’s just that Malfoy, Parkinson, Zabini… almost half of the Slytherin students… they just… left. After Voldemort’s death, they left Hogwarts and disappeared. It seems to have been a coordinated plan. No one has heard from or seen any of them since.”
Draco, eyes bright after having too many butterbeer and pies, told Harry stories of his visits to several places, namely in Europe, where he had travelled extensively with his family.
It was the principal of the matter. Harry was capable of finding love on his own, end of story. But then again, Ginny and Blaise weren’t wrong. There was no harm in going on a few dates.
“So,” Draco started once the waiter had taken their orders and left them alone. “How have you been?”
“So, you’d rather it was Filch then?” Harry retorted, not looking at Malfoy but instead looking down at the Great Lake, which was shimmering underneath the moonlight.
“Yes, because after a horrible war what I needed was to hear the man I loved telling me he had found someone else!” Harry snapped.
“I-“ Harry didn’t know what to say to that. True, he had assumed that Draco wouldn’t like him as the post war zombie that he was. And he genuinely thought Draco had most definitely moved on and the last thing Harry wanted was to barge back into his life and mess everything up. He genuinely believed he was doing the right thing. But now, looking at Draco, eyes filled with something akin to betrayal, Harry didn’t know if he actually did the right thing.
“You don’t have to feel ashamed to admit that you’re struggling to find someone.” Milicent said from her chair.
“Looking blindingly delicious tonight, Draco. Your room afterwards? Maybe we can revisit those long nights we had in France. ”
Harry had to do something. Even if they had fought for most of the meal, this was still the happiest Harry had been in a while. He was always the happiest when he was with Draco and that still hadn’t changed. Wouldn’t Harry be the biggest idiot on Earth if he let Draco slip away again? He once made the mistake of assuming he knew what Draco wanted. Was he really going to make the same mistake again by telling himself that Draco didn’t want anything to do with him anymore?
"I just can't bear the thought of you getting seriously injured and the fact that there might be something I could do to prevent that!" Draco tried.
Something good that happened is that I just recently declared my major, but because I'm declaring it late into my college career, I'm having to deal with how I need to arrange my schedule for the next semester so that I can hopefully graduate on time. On top of that, I work as a teacher as a dance studio, also the subject of my minor, and there is a lot of tension between myself and the studio owner. So my life is split between drama and stress. Thankfully the end of this semester is a couple weeks so I will either be getting busier or things will start to slow down.
Overall, Hayden enjoyed the meeting. It had felt like a weight off his shoulders that he didn't even know he was carrying.
"Hayden, I apologize for the way I sounded in the hall. I only want to make sure that you are safe. I know just how capable you are, and believe it or not, I admire you for that. In fact, I was probably a little jealous of that. I didn't mean to sound like I was belittling you in any way. I only wanted to offer you support. I still do, and I just wanted to say that if you ever need anything, I will do my very best to help" Draco apologized sincerely.
I'm so sorry for not getting a chapter out recently, unfortunately its going to be a little while longer before I can update again. Just to clarify, this book is
"Now, how about we deal with this little problem that plagues my ranks?" Tom said, a murderous glint in his eyes.
He wondered. He tried to get up again, being more careful now that he apparently had wings on his back. Once he was successfully able to sit up, he quickly looked around and saw Severus Snape sitting in a chair by the bed in the darkly lit room.
Hayden guessed that might be another reason as to why the Hall was as quiet as it was, seeing as how Professor Snape had rarely ever shown any expression the last years he was at the school.
Skeeter just tried to laugh it off like every journalist does this, so it should be expected, but frankly, Hayden had had enough.
He continued to walk further into the rocky terrain, stumbling on the loose bits of uneven rock below his feet.
"Agh" the blonde grunted as he stumbled forward, listening as a door slammed closed, presumably right behind Hayden.
In the next room over, Severus heard Harry's scream of pain and came running into the room Harry was in. He saw the boy thrashing around in the bed and was almost thrown into a panic. He didn't know what to do, he didn't even know what was happening.
Harry had several broken ribs, a dislocated shoulder, his leg was cracked in two different places, he had been malnourished and had cuts and bruises all over his skin.
“No need to get upset, I was just trying to be thoughtful. What class is it for?” the older boy insisted with determination.
Without any explanation, Severus quickly got up and exited the room and came back with a tray of food for Harry, knowing the boy must be hungry. Harry looked at the food, grateful yet unsure at the same time. Severus set the tray down in front Harry, who slowly began to eat. For a few moments, Severus watched.
Unfortunately, a lot of them were backless and he just wasn't comfortable with that style yet. It made him feel exposed. He didn't want to wear anything fancy or too casual. Why did this have to be so hard?
"Well, I think it's finally time I deal with Dumbledore and what happened to Harry Potter" Severus said in a bored tone.
Of course when that was said, pretty much the entirety of the Gryffindor table and a few Ravenclaws started to protest the new rule.
"No need to be rude about it, mate. It was a simple question" Weasly said, obviously put off with Hayden's answer.
Suddenly, the goblet started to act up, shooting flames everywhere. It glowed red again! Weren't there only supposed to be three Champions?
Hayden was a little taken aback with all that Blaise just told him. He felt warm inside, that his house seemed to really like him, and not just for who his family is or for what some dumb prophecy says about him.
His hair had grown an inch or two, hanging just above his shoulders and seemed to be even blacker than it was before, the shade a sharp contrast to the glow of his wings. His eyes had changed as well, instead of being an emerald green, they now shown gold. The only green left was the flecks that spotted his now gold irises.
"Um, I-I should get re-ready for classes" Hayden stuttered as he rushed around the room to gather his clothes and went to change in the bathroom before continuing his rush out of the room and to the Great Hall.
“Thank you again, for the whole library thing. I appreciate your help with Cedric” Hayden thanked, feeling it appropriate to do so as they neared the entrance to Slytherin.
"Shouldn't you sound happy to finally meet him?" Severus asked, not wanting to accidentally trigger another crying fest.
Severus expected to apperate outside the front door of the house but was a bit surprised to find himself in someone's room.
"You know, Veela are more than just soft and loving. We're passionate too" the blonde whispered, the distance between the two become less and less.
Hayden opened his eyes again to see that the other Champions had left and only a select few teachers had barged in to disturb the peace: Mr. Crouch, McGonagall, Dumbledore, and of course Severus (albeit much quieter than the other three).
He guessed that some of them were okay, like the twins, Luna and Neville. They're cool, but everyone else can just mind their own business.
Then he remembered the last three years. He had been all but kind to the child who was faced with more danger than a child should ever have to deal with.
Not a moment later and he was being greeted by Lucius Malfoy and guided into the study where the meeting was to take place.
"Now, this will be painful for you, are you sure you want to proceed?" the shorter person asked. Harry just nodded and readied himself.
“We’re going to have to get back up soon for dinner,” Draco mentioned after a couple more minutes of cuddling.
He leaned against the wall, waiting for the doors to be opened, he briefly wondered what would happen if he was sorted into Gryffindor again.
“I heard that you got hurt during the last task. How are you doing?” Hermione questioned right off the bat. Hayden just looked at her, not knowing what to make of the suddenness of the inquiry.
"Would you like to have the block and whatnot removed?" the goblin asked. A teary eyed Harry looked at Severus once before turning back toward the goblin, (that they had forgotten he was there) and nodded.
"Come on, we should be getting to bed" Hayden continued, getting comfortable under his dark green and black covers.
“I bet that Granger was trying to get into your good graces. By bringing up something personal like that. I bet she thought you would confide in her then she would promise to keep your secret” Draco speculated.
Hayden shot up from his spot laying on the coach, wide eyes staring at his mother. He was not going to look forward to this.
He had to find his father, he still had to discuss his plan on how he was going to deal with Dumbledore.
His facial features had softened slightly as well, his bone structure no longer as angular and sharp. His waist had slimmed and his bone structure looks smaller than it was when yesterday giving him a more fragile and slightly feminine stature. He actually kinda liked how he looked. He thought it fit him more and felt more comfortable with the look.
“We have tonight. I do not know what tomorrow will bring, but there is tonight. What do you want right now?”
“I think not. Let us acclimate him first before we surround him with snakes.” Draco only saw his fellow Slytherins at formal events these days. Most who escaped Azkaban had, like them, also tried to escape the pall of the Dark Lord’s shadow. He saw Zabini and Miss Parkinson the most, and that was still very little. Still, if he invited them, they would descend on Potter for their own personal gains.
They lay in bed for hours, their bodies entwined, fingers trailing over skin as the candles melted down to their wicks. They spoke of professors and quidditch and friends and birthdays past. They finally spoke of the war, too, and Potter hovered over him, pressing kisses to his scars in apology.
“Oh?” Draco responded. He had been so worried about his mother’s reaction that he had forgotten that Potter would be reading it as well.
As expected, they received a formal dinner invitation from the Greengrasses for the following Friday. Draco felt slightly more at ease about accepting it since his run-in with Miss Astoria; she had seemed to provide stimulating conversation and had been at least thrice as agreeable as her sister had been in school. Still, he knew that both his mother and Mrs. Greengrass would be vying for a match with one of the sisters. In theory, Draco could see that it would be an advantageous betrothal: while the Greengrasses were purebloods, they had taken no sides during the war, saving their family from Azkaban and asset seizure. Their wealth still did not compare to the Malfoys’ post-war, but half of the families in the Sacred Eight and Twenty were now tarnished, and the Greengrasses had managed to escape that. In addition, Mr. Greengrass’s elevated position in the Ministry could prove useful for the Malfoys’ future.
Draco returned the smile and followed Potter into the meeting room past the desk which was still piled with leaning towers of correspondence. “I was not aware that you were a godfather,” he said. “Have Mr. Weasley and Mrs. Granger-Weasley had a child?” The thought of even more Weasleys running around was enough to make his head hurt.
“Yes, I am pleased,” Draco said. His cream waistcoat was made of fine silk and his shirt was freshly starched, with frills escaping the waistcoat’s opening. Fitzy finished the intricate knot at his throat before climbing down, then back up again with his black robes. As evening wear, they were more form-fitting at the waist, and they fit narrowly against Draco’s frame.
“Oh, don’t be such a toad!” Ginny whined. “Just go there and try it out. What’s the worst that could happen? At least you’ll get to go on some dates!”
“I haven’t really let myself think ahead that far, Malfoy. Right now, I just want to survive… and hopefully not be a giant disappointment.”
Harry felt himself go cold. He never intended to say that. That was the last thing Harry wanted. For Draco to think he was some pathetic loser still hung up on him. Harry didn’t want to admit that perhaps it was true. Perhaps he never really got over Draco.
It was his final year at Hogwarts, and Harry was celebrated as the Hero of the Wizarding World, admired everywhere he went. But he would have traded all of that for a chance to be with Draco again. He missed the blond boy more than he realized was possible.
He still remembered the Slytherin password from that one night when Draco had sneaked Harry into his room. They had spent that entire night listening to music, playing wizarding board games, and chatting until they both passed out on the floor of his room.
“I told her, but she said she’d already figured it out, anyway. She confronted me the day after your accident because I wasn’t around when they celebrated the win.”
Harry never had a proper relationship after Malfoy. Not that he didn’t try. He had friends and co-workers who would set up blind dates for him, hoping that he would finally find someone who clicked with him and made him happy. The last was with Terry Boot, which had only lasted for three weeks after Harry had run off, when Terry became a little bit too invested in him. Terry was introduced to him by Michael Corner, his Auror teammate, who is now giving Harry the cold-shoulder after ghosting his best friend. After that bit with Terry, Harry no longer accepts matchmaking requests by people he knew.
And worst of all, Harry wanted to be wrong. Harry desperately wanted to be wrong. He hadn’t realized it himself until now. How much he had missed Draco and how he was perhaps still a little bit in love with the other man. But surely he was too late now? He had to be. There was no way-
When Harry broke down with a heaving chest and gut-wrenching cries of agony, Malfoy just sat quietly beside him, radiating comfort, and not saying a word.
“But you are the Boy Who Lived, the Saviour of the Wizarding World... how could you ever possibly be a disappointment?”
Not wanting to be hit by a curse, Harry immediately took off his invisibility cloak to reveal himself.
Harry laughed and punched Ron in the arm. He stole a glance at the table at the end of the hall and his eyes met cool grey ones. Those grey eyes quickly averted his and turned their attention to Theodore Nott, who was talking, rather animatedly, to Pansy Parkinson, who had her head on Draco’s shoulder.
“Maybe one day, I will bring you to Norway to meet Erik and his pet Norwegian Ridgeback. His father owns the Karasjok Kites. We can watch them play there. There’s also a wizarding theme park in Oslo. I had such fun there. We should definitely go.”
He had never felt this way before. Part of it could be because of his raging teenage hormones, he knew, but there was another part of him that knew it was more than just that.
Harry opened his mouth and then closed it; no words came out as his mouth was too dry to even make a sound.
Harry opened the door and came in just as Draco was in the midst of undressing. Seeing the door of his room opening, but not seeing anybody enter, had prompted Draco to draw his wand, which he was now levelling at the doorway.
Malfoy closed his book and sat up straighter against the wall. The place was silent for a few minutes, but then Malfoy started to tell Harry about the story of distant planets and warring noble houses.
“Yes. I think Draco would like that place. The club is upscale enough to meet his standards, yet it is still seedy enough for us to find our hookups. Plus, the owner has a type, and his type is Draco Malfoy. Maybe we can get free drinks in return,” Pansy said with a laugh. Blaise smirked in return.
Tonight, Harry felt like asking a question that had been nagging on his mind. Malfoy was a prefect, which meant he had his own room... so why did he need to go all the way up here for privacy?
Harry was startled from his thoughts and saw Ginny smiling softly at him. She took the seat next to him in the Quidditch stands, offering him a chicken sandwich. He took it.
The longest relationship Harry had had was with Malfoy, and that was six years ago when he was still studying in Hogwarts. Their nine-month relationship was shrouded in secret and few people knew of it, except for Hermione, Ron and Pansy (who had accidentally stumbled upon them making out on Draco’s bed).
“Well, well, well.” A man lounging on one of the couches said. Harry recognized him as Theo Nott. “Look who the cat dragged in.” He said, a smirk on his face. “Saint Potter himself. The saviour of the Wizarding World.”
He saw the Snitch at the same time Draco did. They each shot towards it from different angles, but were eventually lined up side-by-side, closing in on the tiny golden ball together. As they both reached for it, their hands touched, and Harry felt an electrical jolt that made him lose his focus. He then felt a painful slam at the side of his body, causing him to lose his balance.
Draco’s eyes widened. But Harry didn’t miss the way he bit down on his lip to hide a pleased smile. “Sure, I’d like that.”
“So?” Harry squirmed, something uncomfortable settling in his gut at the mention of Draco Malfoy. “That doesn’t mean I can’t be in a proper relationship now.”
Harry almost rolled his eyes. He was tired of hearing that. Harry looked around, taking all the familiar faces in. Behind one of the desks sat Blaise Zabini. Near a cupboard in the corner, going through some files was Daphne Greengrass. Milicent Bulstrode was sitting behind another desk.
Harry realized one evening that he had grown used to the blond’s presence at the tower. Being that Malfoy was no longer the Malfoy that he had known and detested when he was younger, he seemed to be
Harry felt a wave of exhaustion crashing over him. Despite the relief he had felt hearing that Draco was alive, another part of him felt a hollow emptiness, like a black hole had suddenly appeared to draw his soul away from his body. A single tear slid down his left cheek.
“Ready to go now?” Draco drawled, smiling so brightly it lit up the whole dungeon. He was standing so close to Blaise that Harry wished he could curse the ground where he stood so it would swallow Blaise up.
Daphne looked ready to punch Harry. Blaise stepped in just in time to pacify Harry and reign Daphne in. “We’ll be more mindful about the height. You’ll have the perfect date next time.” He gritted out.
Hearing the dreadful news magically cured Harry from his sleepiness. He jumped from his bed to pack his things, but stopped when he saw his dress robes hanging from his wardrobe. The Senior Ball was tonight. He knew he had to send a message to Draco to let him know he couldn’t make it.
“I don’t want rude.” Harry said rolling his eyes. “But someone a bit snarky and prickly. She just wasn’t snarky enough.”
“Oh, right.” Harry nodded. “Do you write fiction as well? You always liked to make up stories.” Harry teased, remembering all the rumours Draco used to spread about him back in school.
Harry glowered with anger, half-wishing his eyes were knifes so he could tear the both of them into pieces.
He now mostly stuck to casual relationships and one-night stands, not because that was the only thing he was after, but because that was the only thing he got. He was getting tired of trying to find his perfect match as well, so more often than not, when he would say yes to a random person he met at a club, Harry would simply think why not have fun if he can’t have happiness? Even Molly Weasley had given up asking about his love life, still thoroughly disappointed about Harry and Ginny not working out. But Harry didn’t regret that. They were good friends now and Harry thought of Ginny as the sister he never had. Without the added pressure of romantic expectations put on them, Harry found that he and Ginny got along really well.
After he had bid her a good night, Harry went straight to Blaze. If they were taking his money, they should at least put some effort.
Harry woke up, wincing in pain. He reached for his glasses at the table beside his bed. There was a only sliver of light illuminating the dark so that it took a while for his eyes to adjust to the sight, and when they did, he could see the many cards, flower bouquets, gifts and balloons levitating all over the room, and also… He rubbed his eyes, thinking he was perhaps seeing things. That couldn’t possibly be Draco Malfoy sleeping on that chair, could it? Maybe the hit had really messed his head up.
Every free chance he has gotten has been spent trying to find his mate, but he’s had no such luck. He couldn’t believe how ashamed he felt when he finally went back to Professor Snape's office a couple days later.
His wings were out? He didn't even realize, but he guessed it did make sense considering when he woke up a couple hours ago they were hanging off the bed.
"Not really, there's not really anything for me to look forward to anymore" Hayden replied rather dully.
Hayden was surprised at how comfortable the mask on his face was. Once he walked into the study, he saw all of Voldemort's inner circle of Deatheaters, and strangely, he didn't feel like he should be fighting for his life. He felt powerful.
"Excuse me, who do you think you are? What gives you the right to say that? Just because you are a journalist doesn't give you the privilege to cross lines like that! Like I told you, I did not enter, I do not who put my name in or why it was spit out! Also, shouldn't your quill only be writing down words verbally and not making up senseless drabble?" Hayden spoke up, getting annoyed.
Hayden took a step forward, the students around him parting a path for him. Draco watched as he continued his walk, wishing desperately that he could follow.
That evening at dinner, Hayden sat at the Slytherin table, coincidentally next to Draco, making polite conversation with the blonde. After a couple minutes, Dumbledore stood up and quieted the Great Hall.
Grabbing her throat, she looked to Weasley with panic racing through her eyes. Weasley didn't look any better with the horrified expression on his face.
Every once in a while someone would acknowledge him, say hello and maybe ask if he was a new recruit, to which he would always say yes but never really gave more information than that.
"I can honestly say I don't remember." Tom began, "I myself haven't been down here in almost 3 years, but I know that many of my followers have been. There should be someone, I can't contest to how alive they would be though"
As soon as Hayden reached the seventh floor, he heard someone call out his name. Snapping his head around, he could just see blonde hair dashing around the corner before he heard him call out again.
Hayden, again, looked over to the blonde, noticing how tense the other was. Without thinking, Hayden gently ran his hand down the blondes and slipped his hand into the others, who relaxed almost immediately at the warm touch.
Hayden stared at the two for a second, wondering if he should be civil or if he should just ignore the two. What harm is there in introducing himself.
Once dinner was done and dessert had been served, all the students were sent to their respective house dorms, the first years being led by the prefects of each house.
About a half an hour later, Tom heard a knocking on one of the windows of the study they were in. Looking over he saw an owl sitting on the ledge with an expectant look in its eye and a waiting letter in its beak.
"What if they decide they don't like me?" He said, just about ready to give up. Severus walked into the room and sat down on Hayden's bed, gesturing for Hayden to sit next to him.
"W-what! H-how..." Hayden stuttered, completely baffled at how Luna could've known he was once Harry Potter. How could she have known, he hadn't even told Draco yet! No one else knew, right?
Hayden missed getting letters, he can't remember the last time he got one that was actually pleasant. That reminds him, he can't forget about the meeting he set up with Dumbledore in about a week.
Hayden didn't quite realize just how much he had to do until it hit him all at once. He had to prepare for the next task (in which he was in no way ready), he had to make a plan on what to do with Dumbledore and Harry Potter (although he had a good idea already), and now he was dealing with Draco's rejection. It was all just so emotionally draining, maybe that's why he had such a hard time getting out of bed.
"Alright" Hayden sighed, his exhaustion finally starting to creep up on him. "Could you hand me a towel, please?"
As he straightened back up, he could tell that most everyone in the room felt at least a bit intimidated by his seemingly silent demeanor.
"Hayden, please! Wait!" Draco called again as Hayden booked it in the opposite direction, heading further down the corridor.
"Well, I suggest that you hurry and make friends with him again, half the room right now I'm sure is willing to do anything to have him smiling again" Blaise said, glaring at Draco as he left.
"Come here, Draco! Thank you!" Hayden said before hugging Draco as hard as he could with only one arm.
Like instinct, Hayden brought up a hand lightly running his knuckles across the impossibly soft feathers. Draco's inner Veela purred at the attention of his mate. Hayden smiled.
"What do you mean?" Draco asked, taking a wary step back from the other, so he could watch the bi-colored eyes.
just like he was. But they were a rare creature, and not many of them tended to be in this part of the world.
"You need a new wardrobe, what you have on now barely fits you, and I am sure that you have yet to get your school supplies for the upcoming year. Am I correct?" Hayden sheepishly nodded. Severus smiled and led them into a clothing store.
When the meeting was done, Hayden was the first to leave, heading straight up to his room so he could change into something more comfortable. He hung his dress in the wardrobe and got out a pair or grey lounge pants and a black t-shirt.
Without noticing the raven, Draco walked over to the wardrobe and started to put his clothes away in a very organized fashion.
He was looking forward to learning again, something not many people would agree with. Maybe Hermione, but he didn't really care. And that was what he wasn't looking forward to. Seeing people, especially the idiots in Gryffindor and Slytherin.
It was definitely a nice little study. He bet that if he asked his father he could have it, that would have to wait though.
"Can I ask a question now?" Hayden asked when he calmed down, subtly scooting closer to the blonde. Draco nodded.
Hayden laid asleep on his bed curled around the green blankets in what looked like a makeshift nest.
"Thank you, Hayden. You did a good job tonight and have proved to me that you are more than capable of the tasks I give you" Hayden beamed under his father's praise.
"Your name must tell a story behind it. Let me guess, your family was lost to you at a young age but have recently found them due to the good will of others, and to prove your worth to them, you were set on entering such a dangerous tournament?"
Hayden was currently curled up on the couch, shivering ever so slightly. Tom was worried. He had a feeling that this reaction had something to do with the mate that his boy refused to name, but he didn't know what situation could warrant such a response.
"It's about time! I've been looking for you everywhere!" Pansy said as she turned to face Hayden. "Here, come with me" she grabbed his arm and led him to a private back room.
He still had his more feminine features, but now he looked a bit more defined than before, high cheekbones and the like. He had to admit, he really liked how he looked now more than ever!
At first Harry didn't respond. He wasn't used to that name so he had forgotten that that was him. "Harry", this time he looked up.
“W-who?” Hermione stuttered quietly in confusion, fear starting to dance in her chocolate brown eyes.
Soon enough, it was time for Hayden to go out to the arena. As soon as he walked through the curtains he could hear the crowd of students chanting his name.
Rolling his eyes at Draco, Hayden begrudgingly picked up his stuff and made his way to the Gryffindor side of the room where Hermione sat. Thankfully he wasn’t too far away from where his mate sat.
In the cell laid a man with scraggly, dirty brown hair and scrawny, thin arms holding his head up off the ground as he shivered in his sleep.
Hayden thought for a moment before responding, "I think I remember reading something about that in a book somewhere, I don't remember too much though. Why?" the boy asked.
Usually he gets at least one letter from his friends during the summer, but he guesses they were just too busy for him this summer.
Harry couldn't have rushed down the stairs fast enough. As soon as he reached Petunia, he stood quietly in front her, eyes steadily trained on the floor beneath him as he waited.
They watched the professor as she started to call out partners, only really listening for their names.
He suddenly felt his stomach drop at the sound of another whine from Hayden. He had completely forgotten that his mate was a nightmare, a bad enough one that he felt he needed the extra safety his wings would have provided.
The little room got crowded fast as more and more people showed, the only light in the room was blue from the magical cup.
Once Vernon was done, he left, slamming the door behind him. Harry was left bleeding and broken, on the verge of slipping unconscious. The last thing he thought to himself was
Soon enough, Hayden was breathing normally. Looking down, Sev saw that he had cried himself to sleep. Sighing, Severus leaned down in order to pick up his son and bring him to the couch, he would just have to wait until Hayden woke back up so he could figure out what happened.
"Oh, so what, now you're too good for me? Now that you've made sure I've completely fallen for you you're suddenly superior? Well guess what, you're even worse than me. No wonder you got into Slytherin you son of a-" Draco seethed, shutting himself off so he could take a moment to breathe. That moment didn't last very long.
He asked himself. Soon he was crying again, but this time it was from sadness and guilt, not happiness.
Hayden could hear the fireplace come to life and could only guess that his mother walked in the room. He felt the other end of the sofa dip and the other sat down.
Vernon came at him, dragging him up to Harry's room. Once there, Vernon threw Harry up against the wall and started to repeatedly hit and kick him, all while yelling at him, calling him names like, freak, worthless, mistake, and many more things to bring down Harry's self worth.
Apparently he was a big name, but Hayden had no idea who he was, and honestly, he didn't care all that much.
"Hey girl," Harry greeted as he opened the window and started petting her feathers. "What's that you got in your mouth?"
A couple days later, Harry finally had woken up. He reached over to the nightstand for his glasses out of habit. Once he had put them on he looked around the unfamiliar room. He noticed that this was not his room almost immediately, it looks far too nice to be anything close to his. The walls are done in deep forest green with a desk in the far corner of the room and a couple book cases holding an array of different books. The bed he was in was a soft one, the most comfortable one he had ever been in (he thought it might even give the Hogwarts beds a run for their money!) The sheets and pillow cases were black but the comforter on top matched the walls quite nicely with deep green.
Hesitantly, Harry did so. When the blood had seeped into the parchment, words had started to form. It looked like some weird sort of birth certificate with all your information on it.
Oh, well. He didn’t much care at the moment as he was currently plotting the deaths of those he called his peers.
"Of course you can" Tom answered as he gestured for Hayden to come in and sit, "I'm glad to see you awake again. Did you need something?"
As Draco was trying to think of what to do next, Hayden gave a loud whine of pain, startling the blonde out of his thoughts. Not even a second later, a light emulated from the boy lying on the bed, enough for Draco to have to look away.
Hayden was sure he could find a suitable outfit in his wardrobe, so that wasn’t too big of a problem for him and he was safely able to assume that, since he and Draco were dating, that they would be going together.
He could get the image of Hayden out of his mind, face covered in tears, eyes red and broken. Soon enough the heart broken image turned into one where Hayden almost seemed to be a lifeless cold-hearted ghost.
"Of course" the blonde replied as he stood to take one of the fluffy white towels off the shelf they resided on. Unfolding it, Draco held it out open for Hayden, looking away when the raven stood out of the water filled bathtub.
He had accidentally burned the vegetables and didn't have time to try and remake them. At that moment, he swore life was out to get him!
"No, no! I refuse to let Hayden continue with this!" The blonde declared as he started away from where he was sitting.
After the Beauxbatons finished their entrance with a flourish, the students clapping died down as Dumbledore spoke again.
"I'm only here to deliver the letter and to make sure that you eat breakfast since you undoubtedly did not eat before leaving Hogwarts" the Italian said right before their breakfast was brought to them to eat.
"Well, Dumbledore had tried to pick you up so he could take you to the infirmary, but when he went to touch you you almost burned his hand off. The only person who you would allow to touch you was Draco, so he carried you back here and I tended to you instead of Madame Pomfrey" Severus explained.
"Harry I will be right back, I need to check on something for a moment" Snape said as he walked out of the room and into his potions lab where he tended to a potion that was in the process of being made.
"Hey, please don't start crying" He tried in the most gentle voice he could. He tugged Hayden towards him and gave him a light hug, just in case Hayden wanted to back out of it.
Harry watched Petunia walk away with her nose in the air before rushing to the kitchen to get started on breakfast.
Tom could help but feel like somehow, his son's pain was somehow because of him. He just wished he knew how to help him. Wandlessly, he sent a warming charm onto the blanket Hayden was wrapped in.
“The Weasel. Who Did He Tell?” The raven enunciated, his annoyance starting to shine through in the form of anger.
Tom was confused. "Do you not have friends you are looking forward to seeing again?" He asked skeptically.
It was a simple red dress, but he thought it looked great on him. He popped his head out of the curtain of the dressing room.
“I was at the library, you knew that. Unfortunately, I ran into a bit of trouble. Nothing that wasn’t easily taken care of though” Hayden answered as he hugged Draco back just as tightly.
"Clean up the dining room table! After that here is your list of chores for today." Petunia ordered him, dropping the list before she even finished her sentence.
"Did you just say,...that Hayden is your son? I thought he was your nephew?" Draco asked, trying to process the information he just learned.
At seeing the pure sign of happiness on his mates face, Draco was struck with an idea. He gently reached up to wrap a hand around the raven wrist, carefully pulling him forward.
"The rules are absolute. The Goblet of Fire constitutes a binding magical contract. Mr. Snape has no choice, he is, as of tonight, a Triwizard Champion"
Hayden smiled proudly out at the audience watching as he stood up. As he walked to the table, Hayden looked over to where the professors were all sitting and saw his mother smiling proudly at him.
Once the sorting was done, Dumbledore went up to the podium to give his beginning of the year speech and school rules and whatnot. Many of the Slytherins including Hayden did not pay attention.
"Hayden, I love you, now and forever. I realise that this might be a little early to say, but it's true. You may or may not know this, I kinda hope you do, but, we're mates. I can't tell you how ecstatic I am that you belong to me and I belong to you" Draco reached into his pocket and took out a box. "I am giving this ring to you because I honestly can't imagine my life without you! Not only do I want to be your mate, but also your boyfriend, and someday, maybe even your husband! So, what do you say? Would you be willing to spend the rest of your life with me?"
, he probably didn’t have to worry about Luna at all, although it might be a good idea to at least talk with her. Viktor might be more of a problem though, one that would have to be felt with. Ron on the other hand, was definitely a problem. The man couldn’t learn to keep his trap shut if his life depended on it, which -coincidentally- it did.
"Harry, would it be alright if I call you Hayden, or would you prefer to still be called Harry?" Severus questioned.
“Now is that any way to talk in front of your senior?” Cedric said, his eyes narrowing as he cornered Hayden against the bookshelves, trapping him there between his arms.
Severus was having trouble processing all this very sudden information. The unconscious boy before him was the same one he had bullied for practically no reason at all for three years? Severus was a mix of emotions that he admittedly didn't like feeling.
"Hey, I know you two are awake in there. I can hear you shuffling around. Come on, you're gonna be late for breakfast if you dilly dally anymore than you already are" an amused voice called from the other side of their dorm room door.
Hayden looked around for a moment, trying to find something he could potentially cover up with. After a minute and he still couldn't think of anything, he relented and admitted the blonde entrance, but only if he would look at anything he shouldn't.
He had never made one before and he didn't quite know where the idea to make one came from, but it made him safe every time he laid down in it and when he lit the fire, it was like his own personal heaven. It was warm and safe and his, and he never knew just how much he needed it until he had it.
As soon as Tom left his son's mind, he was displeased. He knew the three that were apparently conspiring against him.
Draco looked a bit embarrassed at the answer. Now that he thought about, that did make a bunch of sense.
"Are you sure? Where is he?" Tom said, jumping up from where he was seated and running to the other man.
"Actually, yeah. I was wondering if you would be able to help me out with my plan for Harry Potter and Dumbledore"
Keeping his arms around Draco, Hayden immediately slotted their lips together, kissing him passionately and full of love.
Draco walked back into the common room, not bothering to go to his next class, especially since it was charms and he was the best in the class.
"Wasn't he the one you've been crushing on and the reason you were having a 'crisis' on my couch?" Sev asked as he smirked. A blush covered the poor boy's face as he stared down at the floor in embarrassment and nodded.
Thankfully classes that day were relatively easy, he didn't really think he was up for any complicated thinking. He already had enough of that when it came to what happened last night (this morning?) with Draco and of course he still had yet to figure out the next task.
"I'm not sure, Sir. I just woke up and decided that I should stand up for a minute or two. I'm not sure why" Harry said quietly.
He fell asleep that night to the gentle sound of the wind blowing outside and thoughts of silver eyes and platinum hair.
"Malfoy is a Veela, correct? Well, Phoenix's and Veela have different courting methods and in this situation there are two ways this can go" Sev started to explain.
The dragon didn't seem like it was about to move anytime soon, so Hayden took a chance and ran to where the golden egg was, almost tripping once or twice.
He wondered where Hayden was sleeping during the nights. It was getting deeper and deeper into fall so of course the nights were becoming colder. He hoped that Hayden was staying warm wherever he was.
"Do you remember us? I guess you were maybe a little young to remember" Narcissa smiled, trying to form a connection with the boy. "I remember holding you just a few days after you were born"
Tom was upset, of course this wasn't directed to Hayden, but to the school. What was going on that they would neglect one of their precious students, even if he was a Slytherin.
"Now why is someone as beautiful as you walking all alone?" Viktor said looking down at him with a smile.
Draco pulled away after only a few seconds. Of course, Hayden didn't like this and tried to follow but Draco had made sure that the raven stayed in place, gently pushing him back so they could breathe for a second.
When Draco was inches away from the other did he stop. The blonde took a moment to look into Hayden jewel toned eyes and was ever so slightly relieved that he didn't see any hesitation or rejection in them.
"We'll take the day off. It's not like we'll miss out on some important lesson. Besides how hard can sneaking off campus be?" Draco said confidently.
It was nearing the end of July so that left Hayden with plenty of time to come up with a plan on how to proceed. Hayden wasn't too worried though, he suspected the whole thing to be rather easy.
Once he was done in the bathroom he walked back down the stairs and into the kitchen. He got out a pan and put a pad of butter in it, while turning on the burner the pan was on.
Now that he thought of it, that was the first time he had really seen Hayden for a week. He never returned to their dorm room and during classes and meals, Hayden sits as far away from him as possible.
A couple feet away from Hayden now stood was a small dragon nest where the golden egg lay. Hayden took a step forward before the dragon suddenly flew in front of him blowing fire towards him.
The next morning, a knock startled Severus out of his musings while nursing a cup of coffee. Out of all the things Muggles had created, both he and Tom had agreed that coffee was something to value.
Pretty much all of the students in Slytherin knew how to dance, mainly because of their high standing families, but Hayden had been raised by Muggles practically his whole life, and coupled with the fact that he was previously in Gryffindor, he never had the opportunity to try and figure it out.
Then it clicked, Severus had thought that he recognized Harry's smell for a moment, from a distant memory of a long time ago. '
Tom had never been prouder of anyone in his life.The man stood up from the chair and made his way to where his son was seated on the bed and pulled him in for a hug.
The music began, and Draco’s eyes found Harry’s. So many uncertainties still hung overhead: how the Wizarding World would react to their betrothal and his professor’s publication, how Draco would be able to live with Ron Weasley, how Harry and Draco would navigate their caustic history and love one another until their last breaths. But somehow, looking at Harry and seeing the strength in his eyes, seeing the
“Miss Lovegood,” he said, his eyes meeting hers, “this is an unexpected surprise! May I introduce you to my professor and mentor, Mr. Henri Bernard. Professor, this is Miss Luna Lovegood.” They nodded to each other and exchanged pleasantries. “And this is Mr. Harry Potter.”
’s most terrible owl swooped in and dropped the paper right on top of his buttered toast. “You know, I am not going to let even you ruin this day for me.” He put a plate of sausages in front of him. “Take as much as you want, you insufferable vagrant.” The owl hooted and grabbed a piece in his beak, several more in his claws, then flew out the window.
“Roast, I believe,” Draco replied, questioning how he knew that and feeling his cheeks flush as he realized the answer. He had spent too many hours watching Potter’s every move at Hogwarts. Though Potter was not an appalling eater like his red-headed compatriot, he remembered Potter often eating as though the food may disappear from his plate at any moment. He had seen the same behaviour from starving beggars on the street, though the idea of someone starving
“Well—” he began, and at the same time a voice called, “There you are! I have been looking for you!” He looked up and saw Potter walking toward them. His suit was the colour of a cloudless, sunny day, and a matching top hat sat on his head. A flurry of pixies danced in Draco’s stomach at just the sight of him. Oh, how he wished he could reach out and touch him.
Draco swallowed down a small ping of guilt, knowing very well that his relationship with Potter, whatever that might have been, was advantageous to his end goals. He instead tried to focus on the very good, very real feelings that being with Potter brought him, how his chest had constricted every time Potter had given him that bright, gorgeous grin. It felt too raw, too vulnerable to share any of that with Hermione Granger-Weasley, so he gave her the sincerest smile he could.
Draco’s heart began to beat at a dangerous pace, and it felt as if Potter’s clear, green eyes were looking straight into his soul. Surely he was not a Legilimens? “I think… I think,” he looked down and cleared his throat. “It does not matter what I think.” He reached for the milk as if pouring it into his tea were the most important task in the world.
“They are cursed, Harry. They would need more than dittany and a school healer to get rid of them.” Harry’s fingers were so light against his skin that it made him shiver. “If times had been different, my parents would’ve taken me to a very skilled healer who specializes in that sort of thing. But…” But the Dark Lord had already been in their home by that time, and the Malfoys had had more to worry about than a few scars.
Draco had been right about Potter’s favorite dish, and an unfamiliar warmth spread through his chest when Potter’s face brightened at the dish’s arrival. He then questioned when he began to care about Potter’s thoughts and feelings.
“Mother,” he said, placing the paper before her. “I think we have found our first project for Item Number One.”
She did not shush him. She did not tell him it would be alright. She simply held him, and for that, he was so very grateful.
handsome. And amiable. If a bit odd.” She laughed. “There is a dream-like quality to her, and I would be lying if I said I was not intrigued. My mother would hate it and would never forgive me for not ensnaring you as a husband and for pursuing a woman as poor as we are, but bothering her has merit all on its own.” He joined her in laughter, amused at the idea of Mrs. Greengrass in a fuss (which he would never have to deal with again). “Mr. Shafiq is nice too. He is interesting and wealthy, though I do not care about that as much as my mother does.”
“Not in a million years, Mr. Potter,” he responded with an insincere frown, and suddenly wondered which house Potter would choose. “Now, in an effort to raise as many funds as possible, guests will be competing for house points. Each galleon equals one point for their house of the night.”
“Nevertheless... I’ve never felt so dreadful winning a game before. Except for that one time when I was five, and I hexed someone to win a prize for Mother, but I found out, rather late, that I could have actually won that prize on my own, no hexing involved.”
They were both kissing hard, teeth gnashing, hands exploring each other bodies. Draco pulled away, breathing hard, lips glistening with Harry’s saliva. He changed his position and pushed Harry downwards to the bed.
Having finished their food and settling the bill, both Harry and Draco stood up, walking side by side until they were outside of the restaurant, ready to say goodbye.
“Well, we mean it this time.” Theo cut in. “If this doesn’t work, I suppose you are simply destined to die alone.”
This was too much for Harry. He felt as if he could barely take a breath with the intense way Draco was looking at him. He let out a chuckle that sounded fake even to his own ears. “Well, anyway. As long as you’re enjoying your job, I’m glad.” Harry said hoping they could change the subject.
It was the Easter holidays, and the students had a two-week-long break where they were allowed to go back home. Harry had decided to no longer go back to the Dursleys, so he went back with Ron to the Weasleys for the holiday, but he returned to Hogwarts alone a few days early before classes began. It took him several attempts to persuade the Weasleys that he needed time on his own to think before they finally acquiesced to his request. Molly insisted he bring back with him a trunkful of home-cooked food (as she felt
The request was so sudden that Harry, who was in the midst of running his fingers through Draco’s soft hair, halted his action and looked down at him.
“Oh, Draco,” Harry sighed. He had never wanted to kiss someone so badly. It felt like old times and Harry missed this so much he felt that his heart might liquefy from the intensity of it.
“So do you still plan to keep me even after our Hogwarts days are long over?” Draco asked with a smirk.
Pansy chastised me for turning into a Hufflepuff and wearing my heart on my sleeve,” Draco said with a small smile. “Or rather, in her words, ‘an imbecilic, lovesick Hufflepuff’.
Ginny groaned. “Stop being so difficult and just go to the bloody thing!” She said. “You know I won’t stop annoying you until you do, right?”
Harry often thought about the progression of his relationship with the Slytherin. He did not dwell on being attracted to a
A look of disappointment marred Draco’s face. Harry braced for the anger to lash out from him. Draco would often react in anger whenever he was disappointed.
Harry slowly chewed his chicken sandwich and worked to not let his face give anything away. He caught sight of Draco in the air and tried to change the subject.
Harry was sure that he saw a tint of pink on Draco’s cheeks. He didn’t comment on it and instead dug into his own dessert. Harry’s thoughts were still racing inside his head. The more they came closer to finishing their desserts and in turn ending their date, the more Harry felt himself panic. Draco had been what Harry was after all this time. All those dates where he found something wrong to complain about was because none of them were Draco.
Later that night in the Room of Requirement, Harry was rough with Draco, pinning the blond to the bed and delivering painful, bruising kisses. At one point, he bit his skin so hard that he could taste copper. Draco, saying nothing, just gripped Harry harder, readily submitting to the manner in which Harry was treating him.
Draco crossed his arms across his chest. He didn’t say anything for a long time. “I always knew you were an idiot.”
. He felt hollow without Draco. He missed sleeping beside him, feeling the heat of his body all over him, and hearing the slow, comforting sound of his breathing.
He sighed defeatedly. “Fine.” He conceded. “Only because I know Ginny won’t let me hear the end of it.”
It had been two days since the Quidditch practice and several days since he had talked, touched or kissed Draco.
Pansy suddenly lowered her voice. “What is up with Draco, anyway? He’s been acting so weird. He hasn’t been free one night for the past few months and now suddenly he wants to go out with us?”
“Sorry Harry, but sometimes I like to be on top,” he murmured, giving several fervent kisses all over his face and trailing down towards his neck.
“That was the worst one yet.” Harry groaned settling on a couch at Blaze. “He was too polite! Way too nice! I like someone with a bit of backbone, not someone who would just agree with whatever I say.”
Blaise inhaled deeply and let it out slowly. He pressed his lips together in a tight smile. “Right. Noted. Next time, we’ll make sure it’s platinum blonde.”
A month of (horrible) dates later, Blaise sat him down. He looked up at Harry with tired eyes. There were dark circles under them. “Okay, Potter. I have one more blind date for you.” Blaise started. “This is your perfect match, I’m sure.”
“I don’t need an agency to find me a partner. I’m capable of doing that myself.” Harry said, tipping back the last of his Firewhiskey.
Earlier this morning on the way to Hogsmeade with Ron, Harry had caught sight of the Slytherin trio comprising Draco, Pansy and Theodore hanging out at the Courtyard, and he saw red when he noticed Theodore’s arm wrapped around Draco’s shoulders. Swirls of possessiveness had enveloped Harry as he envisioned several acts of violence that he wished he could do to Theodore Nott just then. The only thing that stopped him from doing so was the thought of Draco’s reaction at Harry attacking his friend, no matter his motivation.
Harry was sure that everybody at Blaze hated him at that point. But it wasn’t his fault that they couldn’t find him a decent date. He made sure to tell Ginny too, that her love experts were just a bunch of scammers. Harry wasn’t being unreasonable. If Blaze promises to find anyone their perfect match, then Harry wasn’t going to settle for any less.
; he had never believed in labels when it came to attraction towards someone, but rather it was the magnitude of the feelings he felt for Draco that had him contemplating his emotions.
Seeing Draco in his room on the Marauder’s Map, Harry thought maybe they could talk and sort things over tonight. He donned his Invisibility Cloak and headed into the castle, determined to fix things tonight.
Tonight, there was a raging storm outside, so they decided to meet up at an abandoned classroom near the Astronomy Tower instead.
Harry pursed his lips as Milicent let out a snort. He threw her a dirty look before turning back to Blaise. “Okay, who is it this time?”
“Of course, I do, Draco. I’d want to keep you until the end of time. For eternity, if I could,” Harry replied earnestly, emerald eyes glowing.
Mercifully, the waiter appeared then with their food and Harry almost jumped up his seat and hugged the man. The food proved to be an enough of a distraction. Some kind of a chicken dish was placed before Harry and he was glad he didn’t accidentally order a garden salad at least.
“Hey, you know what we could do tonight? Let’s sneak out to London. Blaise told me there’s a new pub that serves their drinks in goblets made from dragon glass. We could use Polyjuice so no one would know that the Golden Boy is in their midst.” Draco brought out two bottles from the pocket of his robe.
Draco was evading all of Harry’s attempts to see him. He was ignoring Harry’s glances in the hall, ignoring his letters, ignoring his calls for him in the hallway (resulting in weird looks from Ron, Hermione and his classmates), and Harry was already sick to his stomach.
Draco nodded. “We almost didn’t, but Snape fought hard for a Slytherin victory. McGonagall was adamant that a rematch was needed because of your accident, but Snape wouldn’t take no for an answer, thus Dumbledore finally accepted our win.
“You are not just a phase for me, Draco.” he murmured. “You can’t be. What I feel for you is too strong to just be a phase.” He pulled back and he could see the blond boy smiling brilliantly at him.
“Um,” Harry hummed, dropping onto one of the couches. “Did you guys even read through all the forms I filled?”
“I thought you had moved on, Draco.” Harry said lowly. “You never reached out to me. You never came to see me. You must’ve known I was alive. The whole Wizarding World knew. So when you never contacted me, what was I supposed to think?”
Draco scoffed. “That was for me to decide, wasn’t it, Potter? Perhaps you should stop deciding for other people.”
“Yeah, Harry, do you have a girlfriend we don’t know about? You seem different these past few weeks. Brighter. Happier. Whoever she is, Harry, I’m so glad for you.” Hermione reached across the table and covered his hand with hers.
“I’ve missed you, Potter.” Draco was looking at him with a tender look. If Harry didn’t know any better, he’d think that Draco’s expression was almost close to longing.
“We’re all fine — Ron just left for the canteen. You’ve been out for three days, Harry. Professor Dumbledore was just here a couple of hours ago with Professor McGonagall. They both told me to contact them once you woke. I’ll send an owl in a minute,” she said, finally releasing her arms from around him, but she still had her head on Harry’s chest.
It was another sleepless night for Harry Potter. The hunt for Horcruxes had been taking a mental toll on Harry — never during any actual execution of the plans he, Hermione, Ron, and Dumbledore had been formulating, but afterwards, on quiet nights such as tonight. He wanted to be able to stop replaying their missteps, their successes, their future goals in his mind, but found that the only way to do so always involved late night wanderings through the castle and grounds. Seeing that tonight was a beautiful, clear night with plenty of stars, he decided to visit the Astronomy Tower to lie down and look at the sky. During nights like this, the Astronomy Tower would turn itself into an open top area, perfect for star gazing.
As gravity pulled him down towards the ground, the last thing he saw before the world went black was the snitch glittering in Draco’s hand.
Harry whipped his head around, never in a million years expecting to hear that voice again. He pinched himself, just to check he wasn’t dreaming. Harry was vaguely aware that his mouth may be open in shock, but there was nothing he could do as he watched Draco Malfoy walking towards him, the usual strut in his step, looking extremely fit in an expensive light grey turtleneck jumper and tailored black pants.
There was a flash of something in Draco’s eyes that Harry couldn’t quite put his finger on. “I see.” He said. “I guess your evening is wasted now?”
“She was more like yellow.” Harry pointed out. “When I said blonde, I meant more like a platinum blonde.”
These late-night Astronomy Tower meetings continued for another month. The pair of them would now discuss almost everything: books, quidditch, music, even food. Harry was astonished to find that he and Malfoy actually had several things in common.
“Will we be going to the same club we went to last week?” Blaise asked Pansy, who was lounging on the sofa, her sequined top glittering under the greenish lights.
“Really?” Ginny deadpanned. “As far as I remember, you haven’t had much luck, have you? The longest relationship you probably had was with Malfoy and that was what, six years ago?”
She looked pointedly at the Slytherins going about with their Quidditch practice. “Trying to catch their strategy for next week’s match? They’re Slytherins, Harry, they don’t have strategies. They just use brute force and lots of cheating.”
After the incident, Harry spent the whole evening trying to clear his head by taking his Nimbus for a spin around the training ground. After a shower and several attempts at eating his dinner, Harry donned his Invisibility Cloak and left Gryffindor Tower, heading towards the Slytherin common room in the dungeons.
“Dumbledore told us You-Know-Who is planning to infiltrate Hogwarts, so we need to hasten the search for the rest of the Horcruxes. Harry, we don’t have much time!” Hermione whispered to Harry, being careful not to wake up Seamus and Neville who were sleeping in the same dorm as Harry, but tugging at him insistently.
“It was the wrong blonde.” Harry rolled his eyes. That much should be obvious to these so-called experts.
They both sat in silence after the waiter had left. Harry couldn’t believe that Draco would think such a thing. Did he really not know that Harry only ever thought about him? Even during the war, Harry couldn’t not think about Draco, wonder if he was doing okay and if he was safe. Yet, the other man really had the audacity to accuse Harry of abandoning him, when it was the other way around as far as Harry knew.
Draco turned, saw Harry, and gave a surprised but blindingly bright smile. His smile turned several shades brighter when he saw Harry’s outfit.
“I…” Draco said suddenly, eyes looking everywhere except at him. “I don’t want to be just a phase for you, Harry. You know, like an experiment, where you would tire of me after you’ve had enough?” Draco’s discomfort at the notion was evident, despite his attempt to hide it.
“Father... he expected so much out of me. Sometimes I…” He sighed, running his fingers through his hair. “I fear being a disappointment as well. I was brought up to do what was expected of me, and haven’t really ever had a chance to think about what made
Draco’s lips were soft, and his mouth tasted like peppermint and cherries. He gently licked Harry’s lips, asking permission to open them. Harry opened his mouth and Draco’s tongue went in, colliding urgently with his.
“Me neither.” Draco said. “Blaise set me up on a blind date. I didn’t think it would be with Harry Potter.”
Even though the nine months they were together were the happiest Harry had ever been and the last thing he wanted was to break up with Draco, he still had to do it. He didn’t think he could be in a relationship while there was a war he had to fight in, especially if there was a high chance of Harry not making it out alive. He cared too much about Draco to let him go through something as horrible as that. So, he called it off and went on to war with a heavy heart.
A couple of minutes passed by, during which the tower was again silent except for the soft sounds of the wind. Harry was just about to close his eyes when he heard Malfoy speak.
Harry turned to see Cho Chang beaming affectionally at him. She stood on her tiptoes to give Harry a kiss on the cheek.
And that was how Harry found himself outside of Blaze a couple days later. The building looked clean and normal enough. It looked rather simple, with some fairy lights hanging around the nameboard. It wasn’t that Harry thought he won’t be able to find love or anything, but Ginny was right. Even though he hated to admit it.
They were deep in conversation when the both of them jumped at hearing something loudly hit the empty seat beside Harry. It was a Bludger.
Harry turned to look at him, surprised to have Malfoy suddenly opening up to him. Harry understood what Malfoy was saying, though; after spending so long being cooped up in a small area during his childhood, being in the open-air calmed him down.
Hermione looked at him, her eyes full of compassion. She put her head on Harry and hugged him again.
It was on an early Saturday night when Harry and Draco crept to the Great Lake to have a late supper. They brought with them a crate filled with butterbeer, pumpkin and treacle pies that Harry had bought during his trip to Hogsmeade earlier in the day.
“Miss Granger! Please behave yourself. Mister Potter is on the verge of recovery. You don’t want him to have broken ribs now, do you? After what he has been through…” the nurse who was checking the patient in the bed next to Harry chastised Hermione.
“No.” Blaise said through a tight smile. “This is the last blind date we’ll send you on. We’re all sure this is the one, so if even this doesn’t work, then we don’t know what else to do. You’ll get a full refund.”
It was Christmas, and Harry was spending the week with the Weasleys. Everybody was back. The house was fantastically chaotic with Ron chasing the twins around the house, trying to experiment on him with their latest trick. Almost every one of them were lazing around in the house after having such a merry time opening their presents and having too much eggnog and plum cakes for brunch.
Harry had just noticed both Hermione and Ron were looking at him with a similar expression of amusement.
Harry tried to sit up in his bed. It took him a long while to do so because every single part of his body was screaming in pain. Draco stood and walked closer; concern written all over his face.
The match between Gryffindor and Slytherin was almost 30 minutes in. The score was even, Ginny scoring one goal for Gryffindor with Urquhart scoring for Slytherin.
Harry glanced at Terry Boot, who was looking at them with interest. However, it wasn’t Terry who had caught Harry’s attention; it was the person sitting at the table at the back that did. For there sat Draco Malfoy, books strewn all over the table, too engrossed in his study to notice Harry staring at him.
“Oh.” Harry was taken aback by the question. He was getting used to the fact that they were not going to be talking about their former relationship, but maybe not. “I don’t know.” Harry replied. “You never reached out either.”
It was Sunday night when Harry saw the flyer for Blaze. He was finishing his glass of firewhiskey and was just about to turn in for the night when Ginny sat down beside him and did all but pushed the flyer in Harry’s face.
Their conversation was somewhat stilted after that, both of them skirting around topics that weren’t ones they were used to. Their conversations were never mundane, but now, Harry felt as if they were both trying so hard to ignore the elephant in the room that they ended up talking only about weather and politics.
Ginny stood up and fumed. “Those Slytherins deserve all the arse kicking that we are going to give them next week. They could have really hurt you, Harry! Come on, we’d better go. It’s getting dangerous sitting here.”
Hearing his name being called, Harry woke up with a start. He saw the stars had already been replaced with a sliver of light showing that dawn would arrive soon. He quickly stood up and brushed his robes. His Arithmancy class would begin in a couple of hours.
The second date was a tall guy. The date itself went okay. He was the correct blonde this time, but Harry didn’t know how the others didn’t realize he definitely wasn’t the one Harry was looking for.
When Harry arrived at the top of the tower, however, he found none other than Draco Malfoy already there, sitting cross-legged on the floor with a book opened on his lap and a bottled water at his side. The tip of his wand was glowing, giving Malfoy just enough light to read his book.
“It’s a girlfriend, isn’t it? It looked like a special present,” Ginny said, looking at him while leaning against the doorway.
Blaise rolled his eyes and let out a sigh. “No, it’s not.” He said. “Come and take a seat.” He gestured to the chair across from his desk.
Harry reached up and gently touched his face. Draco turned to look at him, and Harry pulled him in for another kiss.
“Ugh Potter, you’re such a sap.” Draco said, rolling his eyes and feigning disgust. But Harry could see that he was trying hard to hide his pleasure.
Harry peeked over the menu to glance at Draco. The other man still looked breathtakingly beautiful. His hair parted neatly to a side and the fringe of his hair falling over one eye, nose scrunched up adorably as he read from the menu. Harry had missed that. The little nose scrunch Draco always did. The thought was somewhat unsettling because Harry didn’t know that he missed any part of Draco at all.
They ordered drinks and an assortment of sandwiches, and then Harry leaned forward. “Professor Bernard, Mr. Malfoy has told me about your research and your endeavor to have it published. While I do not have any friends in scientific publishing, Mr. Malfoy and I are both friends with Miss Lovegood, whose family owns their own printing press. Their monthly magazine,
Potter smiled in thanks, then walked over to Draco and extended his hand. Draco took it in his own and wished that neither of them were wearing gloves so he could feel Potter’s skin against his own. “Happy birthday, Mr. Potter.”
Potter was stirring sugar into his tea before he stopped to look at him. He was silent for a moment before he spoke. “And what do you think of me?”
“Actually no, have Vinxy bring us coffee. And firewhiskey.” She handed the gloves to Quelter, and began to make her way to the drawing room.
“I see.” He wondered who could be the object of Luna’s affection, but was unsure how to ask. They split apart to circle the couple behind them and came back together.
He huffed a laugh. “We are often too smart for our own good, are we not?” She nodded with a grin, but then her face turned serious. Expectant. “Our families
Miss Lovegood nodded, and then Draco’s brandy-addled mind somehow remembered her comments about pining at Harry’s birthday party, and he wished that he knew who held Miss Lovegood’s affection.
Potter smiled and tucked into the package, his lip caught temptingly between his teeth as he did so. The parchment fell to the floor and in his hands was a book, bound in mahogany-coloured leather, the gold-tipped pages shimmering in the candlelight.
He smiled and moved on. “Forgive me if this is too forward, but in addition to a large donation to your charity and aid to help distribute the study on lineage magic, I do believe I could be of assistance with, what did you call it? Inter-house unity.” He looked at Potter. “Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, putting aside our history and coming together for the greater good. We could host a ball in the name of unity to raise more funds for the Patronus Charity.”
“I understand that,” he said, leaning forward. “But that is the thing. The reason why I do not want to worry about having my own child is because I want to marry Harry Potter.”
The owl eyed it, but made no move to take it. “Well, go on. Take it and be gone with you.” The bird made an undignified squawk before taking the treat and darting out the window.
He tried to return it, but he was fatigued from moving back to England the day before, and he had also felt uneasy since returning. He cleared his throat, unsure of how to inquire about the subject pressing on his mind.
“Oh?” Draco did not realize this, though, when he thought back, he had only seen Potter in the office and in their homes. And the office was unmarked.
Harry nodded. “Even with Voldemort’s best efforts, we are still here.” He huffed. “Alive despite it all.”
“Please tell my mother that I am not well. I will receive breakfast here.” He sat at his bureau in his nightshirt and pulled out a quill and a fresh sheet of parchment.
“Good day, Mr. Malfoy,” he said, his hands full with two more parcels of mail. He placed them next to the desk before turning to him.
“Delightful,” she exclaimed with a smile and headed, no doubt, toward her bureau to write a letter. “I will reach out to Mrs. Greengrass to make arrangements.”
“Give me a minute.” Draco ran upstairs to his room and returned moments later. “These are notes from my work with a professor who specializes in lineage magic. The blood of families is a powerful thing, but your love for me is no more powerful than… than Lily Potter’s love for her son. Do you know why Mr. Potter was forced to stay with his muggle family when we were not in school?”
“Oh, um, yes?” Harry said, as though he were suddenly self-conscious about his ability. Of course he could feel it; Draco should’ve known that would be the case when he brought one powerful wizard in front of another. A small, green part of him rendered its head to be upset at this revelation, but he pushed it down with a deep breath, and then another. This was Harry.
He could not allow himself to think of the future, a future with a wife and an heir, where he could no longer have this. But tonight—
“Please wait a moment, Mr. Draco. Kreacher will fetch Mr. Potter’s valet for you.” He Disapparated with a crack, and was back seconds later with another elf.
He was ashamed to admit that he had never considered the extent of the terrible loss his aunt had endured, and almost all of it by his own family. For the first time in his entire life, continuing the legacy of his family seemed incredibly misguided. What good had the Blacks and Malfoys brought to the Wizarding World? Even if his aunt did not agree to their plan, he was unsure if he would even want to have his own child.
Mrs. Granger-Weasley looked as though she might object but was interrupted by Potter. “Of course. The unity ball was his idea and your family is its benefactor.”
By the end of the evening, he had not spent a single moment alone with Miss Astoria and was on edge from her mother’s constant meddling. When he and Mrs. Malfoy finally said goodbye and Apparated home, he let out a cry of frustration.
Draco’s plan was to be as charming as possible when meeting Mrs. Skeeter and to paint the picture of a morose and repentant Malfoy family when discussing their past. It certainly was not a lie on his part, but he would be sure to lay it on thickly.
When she closed the door, he heard Mrs. Potter shout, “handsome, no?” to Mrs. Granger-Weasley, and he grinned despite himself.
“You want all of us to forgive you and your family for your mistakes, and yet you are unable to do so for a man who, no, was not perfect, but who died to protect all of us.”
“No,” Draco said with a sigh. “I will need to give you a new address.” Draco was about to tell Mr. Stone their townhome address when he had an idea. “Actually, I will be doing most of my flying elsewhere and would like it to be delivered there. Please send it to me, care of Mr. Harry Potter, Godric’s Hollow. And include a snitch, as well. If you will allow me some parchment and a quill, I will include a note.”
Potter looked down. “I see,” he said, more to himself than to Draco. Then he crossed the room, reached out to pull Draco against him, and crushed their lips together.
Harry laughed, and then he leaned in and kissed Draco so fiercely that he conveniently forgot all about Mr. Weasley for the rest of the evening.
Draco looked at his mother, who nodded at him, and he reached forward and opened the gate for the first time in four years. It swung open with a moaning creak. The path stood before him, though it did not seem very welcoming. Still, he offered his arm to Mrs. Malfoy, which she took, and they walked side-by-side up the path until they reached the manor.
When morning came, he knew his mother would be anxious to discuss the events of the night before, but he did not have the heart to do so. He called for Fitzy.
“Excellent,” said Potter once he saw that Draco had changed, moving forward to hand Draco a broom. “Here you are. I actually only have one broom at the moment. I thought I may borrow Ron’s and you could borrow mine.”
How much of Draco’s plan was to clear his family’s name and how much was to bring about the greater good? He pushed away those uncomfortable questions for another time.
“Congratulations, Mrs. Granger-Weasley,” he said with a nod of his head. “On the marriage, not the niffler.”
The nights were the most difficult. Was the floo connection still open, he wondered. Could he step through and arrive at 12 Grimmauld Place? Would Harry be waiting for him if he did?
“Right,” he said, reaching for his wand to undo the wards. They stepped inside and closed the door behind them. He did his best to bow but he was still slumped against her. “Thank you, Miss Lovegood. You have dutifully returned me home and now you are free to return to yours.”
Draco understood. Even if Potter did not have the obligations that Draco did, surely it would be difficult for his friends to understand him falling for Draco Malfoy of all people. He nodded. “Yes, I would like that very much.”
“You need a wife, darling. With good social standing. Someone who will lift up our family name by association.”
Potter fully entered the office and he looked… well, he looked quite fine, if Draco were honest with himself. He was without robes, a habit he seemed to still carry from his muggle upbringing, and his hair was still a righteous mess. But his dark green tailcoat, matching waistcoat, and cream cravat were a lovely contrast to his brown skin and made his green eyes gleam even brighter.
“Oh, I added your home to the floo here. If you do the same, you should be able to floo directly to your bedroom.”
Draco gave a rather undignified groan and pulled away. He dressed himself as best as he could while Harry watched from the bed, beautiful and unashamed in his nakedness, a siren tempting him toward the rocky shores.
Draco rose then knelt in front of Mrs. Tonks, taking her hand in his. “Thank you, Aunt Andromeda. Truly, I am forever indebted to you.”
“Little ones have a tendency to fall into that sort of trouble,” Mrs. Malfoy said. “Or even bigger children who are reckless on the quidditch pitch.” Her eyes fell to Draco.
He led her to the drawing room and closed the door. “Let us move Mr. Travers and put Miss Lovegood beside Miss Astoria at dinner.”
“Thank you, Miss Granger. I hope I’m not... interrupting anything.” He prided himself in his ability to not snigger as he said it, though she did appear to be alone. The office was small, with a large oak desk in its center, overflowing with unopened mail. Two armchairs sat to the right of the door and a tea cart stood behind the desk. There was a fireplace to the left with a jar of floo powder on the mantle.
“Oh? Is that your usual sentiment, Mr. Malfoy, or do you only feel that way after receiving an ominous reading?”
“It has been in my family for quite some time. I did not know about it as a child, and I was still required to live with my aunt and uncle during the summers until I reached adulthood. I have spent the last few years restoring it, as it was essentially abandoned all those years.”
“Ah, it is nicer out here,” a voice called behind him. He looked and saw Miss Astoria was walking toward him.
Potter returned his smile and gestured down the hallway. “Would you like to join me in the salon? We can open it there.” Draco nodded in agreement and followed him into the room. He had been in here before, of course. He remembered gliding his hands along the branches of the Black Family Tapestry, the woven fibers scratching his fingertips as he had traced the image of his own face and his mother’s too. He was therefore surprised to see that the tapestry had been removed, now replaced with navy walls and landscapes and portraits.
And Mr. Draco Malfoy, besotted wizard whose heart had certainly been broken (perhaps even by his own actions), had a plan. It read as follows:
The following Friday turned out to be a very busy day. Draco had an interview with Rita Skeeter at noon, necessitating the practice of talking points with his mother that morning, and they had their dinner with the Greengrasses that evening.
Mrs. Tonks replied with a tight smile and grabbed Teddy’s hand to meander to another part of the garden.
“Indeed,” he said with disdain. “Though I can assure you, my life is not as exciting as you might imagine it to be.” He looked up to see that she was watching him very closely, making his skin itch with the intensity of her stare. He knew Mrs. Skeeter was not a powerful enough witch to cast
“Well, I cannot say it brings me joy, but—” he sighed, “the past isn’t going anywhere, as much as we would like it to.”
We're over the hump now! Thanks again to 221brosiewilde for the beta and Inkpen4877 for the sensitivity reading.
“And your family?” Potter asked. “May I ask where you are living now?” Of course Potter was familiar with their trials and knew that they had lost the manor. He gave testimony on their behalf, after all.
Mrs. Granger-Weasley interrupted them with a squeal of delight. It sounded as if the other table was having much more fun than he was.
He was already in his nightshirt and reading in bed when Quelter knocked on the door. “A letter just arrived for you, sir. Quelter brought it straight away.”
“I am sorry that things did not work out between us,” Draco said, grabbing her gloved hand with his own. “You are a truly wonderful witch, and anyone would be lucky to have you.”
“Do not say you are at odds, Mr. Potter,” Mrs. Malfoy said. “Would that not defeat the purpose of this event?”
“There was immense pressure from my father,” he said one night, his head pillowed in the crook of Harry’s arm. “To be perfect, to uphold pureblood ideology, to be a
“Oh.” Draco knew that his cousin, Nymphadora, had died at the Battle of Hogwarts, but he had only met his Aunt Andromeda once and never had a relationship with Nymphadora. He had forgotten that she had had a son with Remus Lupin before their death. “I see.”
Draco had not flown much in France. He had been quite busy with his studies and had not attempted to join the university’s Quidditch team. He hoped his lack of practice and the sensitive broom would not lead to disaster.
Wednesday morning brought him to the sprawling estate of Godric’s Hollow. Potter was already in the air when he arrived and, after a quick change into flying robes, Draco mounted his new broom to join him. They spent several hours in the air, chasing each other and the snitch and practicing old Quidditch maneuvers from their Hogwarts days.
“In the forest with Nimue. It looked to be some sort of bonding ritual. She never would have given her blessing if you were promised to someone else.” She took another sip of tea. “If your heart had belonged to someone else.”
“And neither would Draco Malfoy,” she responded, glancing upward until their eyes met. They stayed like that for a moment, and then the smallest, almost imperceptible smile tugged at the corner of her mouth, and he found himself returning it.
I see,” Potter said with a small frown. “Mr. Malfoy, we do appreciate your willingness to help. However, we are confused about the sudden vivacity of said help.”
“Good morning, Professor,” Draco said before sitting and spooning food onto his plate. “How are you feeling?”
The two Malfoys Apparated together to Godric’s Hollow after breakfast. Kreacher’s eyes widened to the size of saucers when he saw ‘Miss Cissy’ and practically bounced while escorting them to the estate’s ballroom. It was significantly larger than the manor’s, with walls painted a delicate powder blue and candelabras lining each wall. Three glittering chandeliers hung from the high ceilings, sunlight catching on the crystals and casting dancing lights all around them.
impressive,” said Mrs. Granger-Weasley, and Draco wondered if the pair of them would bond over unnecessarily complicated planning. His mother’s responding smile seemed to say
After dessert, the group moved to the parlour for games. The elves had prepared two card tables in the center of the room, however Weasley’s eyes fell on a wizard chess board tucked into the corner. Mrs. Malfoy noticed and gave Draco a suggestive look.
The address for the office of The Patronus Charity for Restoration and Unity was a mere five blocks from Mrs. Malfoy’s home, and Draco felt a walk would be most welcome. He looked at the mirror one last time, turning his face back and forth to ensure the evenness of his sideburns, a habit he formed after a disastrous barber incident two years past. His valet, Fitzy, then helped him into his robes, and he headed downstairs to say goodbye to his mother.
wanted it. However, as a pureblood gentleman in society, I have a duty. To produce an heir.” Harry clenched his jaw, and his eyes turned stormy with anger. Draco’s voice shook as he continued. “There have been discussions with another family about marriage.”
“I personally like the truth better.” Potter gave him a playful grin that made Draco’s insides flutter in a most embarrassing way.
“Like this?” Harry asked after slicking himself up, one hand gripping behind Draco’s knee while the other guided his length to his entrance.
“He is meeting with publishers in France and has asked me to attend,” Draco said. He was currently dining at Godric’s Hollow with Harry and his two faithful companions. It was his first time being in Harry’s presence around others since they had started seeing each other every evening, and it was admittedly difficult to keep his distance and his hands to himself. Harry kept looking at him with soft, mooning eyes, and he worried that his friends would figure things out at any moment. “He hopes that having a pureblood wizard with him may help his chances for publication. He has been turned down by so many thus far.”
He knew it would be a shock to their guests: two gentlemen of means, one of whom was a pureblood, who had chosen each other over family duty. Yet he thought of Harry and Miss Lovegood and felt more kinship with them than he had with most of his family outside of his mother. He thought of Teddy, too, who was now promised a good life and even more family to support him, and he felt completely at peace with the decisions he had made.
and other things.” She took a deep breath. “We help each other. It can be… sometimes there are difficult moments. Since the war.”
“Are there any developments on the personal front?” She asked, her beady eyes peering over her thin spectacles.
“Yes, that is what happens when you befriend a Slytherin, Miss Lovegood,” he responded. “We have much the same cleverness of Ravenclaws, but we actually put it to good use.”
It was a cloudless, sunny day, and the manor’s dark facade looked out of place against the bright, blue sky. Draco’s eyes roamed over its stones, noticing that it did not seem to be in any sort of disrepair. Perhaps the Ministry had kept the anti-decay charms intact.
“Ah, no,” Mrs. Granger-Weasley chimed in. Draco could see the sudden wariness in Potter’s face. “Mr. Potter tries to stay away from the press as much as possible.”
Draco hastily covered up Potter’s unopened letter with the others and looked at her. “Of course not.” She looked at him pointedly and he knew very well that he did not have her fooled. “I ran into Astoria Greengrass today,” he rushed in a desperate attempt to change the subject. “She mentioned dinner with her family.”
“I am fine, Mr. Malfoy, I am — well, I feel much more optimistic than I have all week. Though, truth be told,” he said with an anxious chuckle, “I am rather nervous to meet Harry Potter.” Professor Bernard was a large man with dark skin, broad shoulders, and a softening belly. He wore a pair of spectacles, which were always perched low upon the bridge of his nose, as if he were perpetually more interested in reading whatever manuscript might fall before him than looking at the room around him.
“I am happy that this brings you amusement,” he said with a sneer and stood to brush the dirt from his knees.
He went downstairs to join Mrs. Malfoy for breakfast. “You look very handsome this morning, darling.”
Potter reached down and untucked his shirt, slipping it off to reveal lithe muscles, his body taut and firm from years of broom-riding. Draco allowed himself to take in the sight before pressing his palms to Potter’s chest, his fingertips brushing against his clavicle.
Today, Potter’s spectacles were slightly askew, and Draco wanted to reach out and straighten them, linger his fingertips on his jawline, brush his thumb along his soft lips.
“Oh yes!” Miss Lovegood exclaimed at the same time. “Mr. Malfoy, Madam Joylove is a skilled seer. You will not find a better tea reading.” She took a final sip of her tea and turned her cup over, nodding at Draco for him to follow.
“What did you study at school, Mr. Malfoy?” Miss Astoria asked. She looked truly interested and he welcomed her sincerity.
“Malfoy,” Potter breathed, his hands stopping Draco’s as they moved to the buttons of his waistcoat. “You should know that I — I haven’t done this before.”
to go away,” Draco said with a smirk, his eyes glancing pointedly to Potter’s groin. “Or if it returns when your mind wanders back to this little moment, it will be easier to hide.”
“Not tonight, you are not. And do not think I have forgotten our bet. Five galleons to the house who wins the charity cup.” He chuckled. “It does amuse me greatly to know how hard you will be working to ensure that Gryffindor snatches it.”
Harry reached up and touched his face gently. “And I told you I would tease you as long as you would have me.”
Her face creased with either sympathy or pity, and he was not inclined to receive either, nor was he sure he was in the mood for Luna Lovegood’s omniscient observations and life advice. He was about to make that sentiment known when she suddenly stood and offered her hand.
Potter laughed and came over so that they were standing side-by-side, facing the windows. “Madam Joylove’s?” He asked. Draco nodded. “Do not try the Witch’s Brew if you care anything about your tastebuds.” He laughed again. “Oh, the image of the two of you sitting at tea is a most amusing one.”
Her face softened the smallest fraction; not enough for most people to notice, but Draco could see it very clearly. “What has happened?”
This chapter includes an epistolary interlude, which I’d planned to do from the very beginning. What’s Regency without some letters thrown in, hmm? The interlude was very much inspired by the letters between Alex and Henry in
She cleared her throat. “Mr. Malfoy, we appreciate you calling today, but Mr. Potter is not accepting visitors right now.”
Her eyes darted to Draco, but then she gave a small nod. “Yes, thank you. Happy birthday, dear boy.”
It was then that Vinxy arrived with coffee and Firewhiskey, and Mrs. Malfoy poured a hearty mix of both into the coffee cups. “Drink up,” she said, before taking a sip of her own. Then she walked across the room to the bureau where she retrieved parchment and paper, and she handed them to him.
When he entered the ballroom, he saw his mother, also in navy robes with a sapphire eagle pendant at her neck, and he saw that she was talking to Harry.
His mother was at her vanity table while Lokey finished curling her hair. Aunt Andromeda would be calling within the hour, and Draco had just finished getting ready himself. She looked at him through the mirror. “Conflicted. Anxious. I was not the one who disowned her, but I still agreed with the decision at the time. I still refused to see her and call her my sister.” She wrung her hands in her lap. “I hate that I know that this should have happened years ago, and the truth is that...” she trailed off.
“Mother?” Draco asked once inside the drawing room. He still felt shaken from the manor and so he sat quickly upon the chaise. “What is happening?”
“Thank you again. I will try to find him.” Draco left to get a cup of butterbeer, his eyes searching for Potter or anyone else who would not look at him like they would be perfectly happy to murder him on sight. He luckily spotted Miss Lovegood’s golden curls, and began to walk toward her until he felt a pull on his robes. He turned and a boy with green hair looked up at him curiously.
“Yes, I left a few minutes early since using the floo can be a bit unpredictable. They should be here any moment.”
“Mr. Potter said that Mrs. Granger-Weasley was the most accomplished student during your years at school. It is remarkable that she is muggle-born.” They sat in the drawing room while his mother embroidered a muslin handkerchief.
Potter’s eyes widened, and his face slowly brightened with hope. He gently grabbed Draco’s arms, fingers curling around his biceps, and Draco reached forward to brush his thumb against his cheek. Potter melted into his caress, and it was no wonder as to why. If Potter had been starved of physical affection as a child, then of course he would react so strongly whenever Draco touched him. What would it be like to hold him close? To
, and saw light emit from Miss Lovegood’s wand. He had forgotten that she had even been there.  “I feel that you two may need a moment,” she said. “I will return to the path. Please cast a light to the sky when you are ready for me to find you again.” Then she curtsied and left them alone.
“It was certainly better than the last escapade,” Draco responded with exasperation and sat across from him.
Draco was certainly not a revolutionary by any means, but a very small part of him, no doubt unearthed by his newfound proximity to members of Dumbledore’s Army, wondered if the Wizarding World could use a bit of shaking.
“Maybe because you always frighten him,” a voice called from behind causing Draco to turn. Though he had only seen her once before, he would still be able to recognize her from just her eyes and nose, which were so similar to his mother’s. “What did I tell you about going into Mrs. Weasley’s garden?”
Her eyes suddenly widened to the size of saucers and her quill drooped and wilted to the floor. “Yes, I, I believe we have been introduced.”
“No, of course not. I have only ridden it once before, but it was fine.” Potter stood up and walked over to where Draco had thrown the broom to pick it up. “Oh.”
Draco cleared his throat and bowed in return. “Yes, thank you for joining us. Are we still expecting Mr. Weasley and Mrs. Granger-Weasley?”
“Of course,” he said, trying to smile. Draco had often thought most divination to be frivolous and even dangerous. The Weird Sisters’ prophecy had ruined the life of that Muggle king, and the Dark Lord himself had been unhealthily obsessed with his own prophecy. Indeed, Potter’s parents would still be alive without Professor Trelawney’s fateful words. Despite his hesitation, he turned over his teacup.
While it was no wonder why a young boy would be so tired after a long day, Draco would not have expected to be in this position. He sat there for several moments, wondering what he should do. Teddy’s body slackened, and out of fear that his head might fall and hit the bench, Draco brought his arms around him to hold him in place.
Harry rolled his eyes and then reached forward to trace the collar of Draco’s robes. “So what happens next?”
“When she asked if there was someone special in your life, and you said…” He bit his lip as he trailed off. “Did you mean—”
“She wants to see you in shirtsleeves as much as you want to see her in a shift,” Harry replied matter-of-factly.
“He’s a tip-top chess player!” Potter interjected. “He was undefeated in the Gryffindor common room.”
“Thank you,” he said, palming the shrunken gift in the pocket of his robes. It was private and required an explanation, and he did not want to do that in front of a gaggle of Weasleys if he could help it.
“Um,” he faltered, immediately picturing Potter begging to kiss him just two days ago. He felt the tips of his ears turn pink. Though he had not answered, Mrs. Skeeter’s quill worked furiously on the page.
“Just wait until you touch the stones themselves,” Draco said, pulling himself out of his thoughts. He took Harry’s hand and walked toward the tomb, motioning for Miss Lovegood to follow. He suddenly felt swirls of magic as he and Harry moved forward, brushing against his skin, urging him to move closer. His brows furrowed; the magic had not felt this way in any of his previous visits. “It feels different.”
“Excellent work,” she replied with a doting smile. Mrs. Malfoy had a thick portfolio in her arms. She laid it upon the table, and spelled its contents to spill forth in neat piles. When each stack was finished, their names appeared and a silver ribbon tied them into a package. She then took a turn around the room, her eyes measuring its capability. He could see her vision formulating as she completed her turn.
“I am glad for you both,” he responded, hopeful that his two friends would find happiness in each other.
“We would love to publish this,” Miss Lovegood said. “If your schedule has time within the next couple of weeks, we could schedule a meeting to discuss the contract. You could come and see the printing press for yourself, as well.”
“Goodbye, Mother!” Draco said, practically fleeing to the front door and apparating to the first place that entered his mind.
She gave him a big smile. “I am truly so appreciative that you brought us here here to check on the state of the home. It does seem to be in good shape, does it not?”
She laughed. “I believe our mothers have been conversing about dinner. Perhaps you will visit us soon?” Draco had not only forgotten about that dinner, but he had also lost track of the hour.
