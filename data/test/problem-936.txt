Draco executed a plié, then danced down the runway.
?!” Steve asked incredulously.
She probably should have warned Harry about it first, however. It was too late when the other wizard entered the room and gasped in shock. His face went white and he absently rubbed the back of his hand.
“This is insane,” Lorena Gucci lamented. “Normally, I take four or six hours to beat my face. How can I do it on someone else in just thirty minutes?!”
!” She held up her card.
Draco considered this for a moment. “All right,” she said. “May I give it a try?”
“Merlin help us,” Al sighed. Draco ignored him.
In the end, Ivana Mann sashayed away. She gave a slightly tearful goodbye after Kali Sister, equally tearfully, joined the rest of the queens at the back. Draco tried not to scowl, but the camera managed to pick up on a faint look of displeasure.
Harry reached out and grabbed his hand again, and Draco smiled at him gently.
“Kali Sister, that was magic. Chanté, you stay. You may join the other girls.”

“My girl Acacia is giving this lip sync everything she’s got — she’s doing death drops, cartwheels, armography, you name it,” Paris said. “But I don’t know if she gets that that isn’t what this song is about.”
Draco felt a sharp pang of loss. Being gone so long from his boyfriend had been harder than he would have anticipated. What he wouldn’t have given to be able to wrap his arms around him, or even just hear that voice for a little bit longer.
“For today’s mini challenge,” RuPaul began, “I want to know which of you are the best dancers at RuPaul’s Drag Race. It is time to bust out some of your best moves in a good old-fashioned dance-off...country style!” He told them excitedly. “Now, you have fifteen minutes to get into your best quick-drag country realness. And, GO!”
spoiled rich bitch? Do you think that’s in your wheelhouse?”
!” Draco was baffled. “They can’t just fix your wrists now? How in Ru’s name are you supposed to compete in the next challenge?”
Steve laughed. “What? No I didn’t! It was just me and Ivana and Draco. I would have remembered if we saw an owl!”
“Well,
Draco dreamed that Astoria was sitting on a swing in the attic, looking just as beautiful as she ever had in her prime.
“Charity told me,” she said, gesturing to her spectral partner in crime. Draco turned to the professor in confusion.
“When I look at Draco, I don’t see a star,” Venus said. Draco scoffed.
Draco shut the book and pursed her lips.
“All right, just between us girls, let’s caucus. What did you think about Draco?” RuPaul asked.
Lady Cakes pursed her lips and tilted her head up to look at the ceiling.
“I think I remember hearing about something like that,” Draco told Millicent. “RuPaul used to have a programme where they brought in
Unfortunately, that didn’t stop anyone else from laughing. Letting Lady Cakes look at her notebook now ranked at the top of Draco’s long list of regrets in life.
“Draco, Draco…” she tapped a finger against her bottom lip. “Where have I heard that name before?”
“Ah! Now I remember,” she nodded. “Last I heard, I think someone was arguing that it’s a women’s health manual.”
“Cake fight,” Draco answered nonchalantly.
“Creepy…” RuPaul purred.
All too soon, it was time for their performance on the main stage in front of the judges. Team Venus began their group choreography, dancing around each other in a circle and lip syncing to a song that made no sense to Draco. She only remembered her own lines and other queens’ lines when they served as her cues.

with everything they had.
Basil and Paprikah nodded, then wandered off to help some of the other queens into their mics.
“Let me get this straight,” Draco responded. “You’re asking me to cheat in the competition by fixing your costume for you, and do magic in plain sight of the cameras and everyone else, which means breaking the law and risking a prison sentence. All so I can have someone to

As the closing music played, Draco danced with the others, grateful to once again have been spared from elimination. She still had no idea how far she could go in this competition, but she started to feel like she might have a future in drag — regardless of what the other queens thought.
“Hello, hello, hello!” RuPaul appeared in the doorway and entered the werkroom in a teal and purple suit. The queens cheered in greeting.
” Ru commented.

Malfoy jerked his face back towards Harry and schooled his features. “Let’s meet again tomorrow morning after you’ve collected the forms.”
“What makes you think being around me will be fun?” Okay, maybe that wasn’t the best tactic. He didn’t need to make himself out to be any more pathetic than he already was, thank you.
“Who wore it better?” Carson wondered.

“Hmm. All I know is that I’ve really gotta serve the best damn Elsa I can on that runway,” Steve said nervously.
“Well, long story short, I was halfway over the Pacific Ocean when my aeroplane got a bad case of the gremlins and everything went all whimsy-whamsy in the gubbins.” RuPaul laughed. “I had just enough time to grab Mae West and jump out with a parachute made from a stick of Beech-Nut chewing gum.”
“Yeah, we’re sisters in
Potter appeared thoughtful. “He wasn’t my favorite person, but if you want, I’m in. Who knows, it could be fun, right? Hermione, Ron, what do you think?”
Kali-as-Jameela held up her card. “I put down my good friend,
” Kali innocently affixed a long, black wig onto her head and parted the thick fringe in the middle.
“When I call your name, please step forward,” RuPaul instructed. “Intoxia Madison,” Intoxia stepped forward. “Paris Davenport,” Paris stepped forward. One by one, the others followed: Ivana Mann, Acacia Davenport, Kali Sister, Steve Donovan, Cindy Sanchez, Lorena Gucci.
The audience erupted in loud gasps, laughter, and wolf whistles. Pansy Parkinson and the Greengrass sisters squealed in delight.
“Michelle, I disagree!” Ross argued. “Draco, you’re looking the most confident I’ve ever seen you on the runway.”
” Draco repeated. “All those other henges are utter rubbish.”

. I might actually miss you next week.” Draco rebutted with stinkface.

Lorena and Goldie gave her a pitying look. Draco and the others looked away. They had all seen the contents of Steve’s rack and hadn’t been impressed.
“Your runway look tonight is almost too glamorous to be a witch,” Michelle declared.

“Article? What article?” A girl asked.
“Do you want her to come back, then?” Acacia Davenport asked.
woman?” She cackled maniacally, and the screen faded to black.
“For your first look, you’ll be serving up Beach Blanket Realness. And by that, I mean you should wear a swimsuit, not a blanket,” RuPaul looked pointedly at Draco. The queens chuckled while Draco served her best sweet, innocent look.
“All that bollocks about Bob Marley’s ghost having to wear chains because of his crimes was utter shite. Do you see
“It didn’t help that
Draco’s mask designs had been his crowning artistic achievement as a teenager. Not only were they each individual masterpieces of design, but for a brief moment they had helped him win the very rarely bestowed respect of his father and the Dark Lord.
“I’m from Central Illinois! That’s the corn capital of the world!” Kali cheerfully answered.
Lorena raised her hands toward the ceiling. “Ay, dios mio! That was too close for comfort!”
Potter grinned. “Hey, Hermione!” he yelled across the hall like an utter barbarian, waving his arm high over his head.
That night, Draco was wide awake in bed, his mind flipping through his time on

“This may look a bit
“Carmelita,” she responded coolly. “Obviously, she’s been cast on the show to be a villain rather than show any sort of improvement or character arc. She’d do better to go home and learn her manners. And constellations,” she added.
“Excellent. Now that’s settled, I have a very weirded-out boyfriend who needs to be convinced why this is a good idea.”
with that one. Even if those plans hadn’t been canceled for him, he had no interest in pursuing them anyway. Drag was much more fun and colourful.
Draco’s eyes then searched the room. A few pub patrons shot her dirty looks, but more people kept their focus on the screen or away from her. She looked to see if the hooded figure from the previous week had come back. There they were, sitting in an otherwise empty corner, looking down.
“Yeah hon, everybody smokes in the show circuit,” Steve added.
“Is that so?” Millicent grinned at him, sneaking a smirk in Draco’s direction.
“Sarcastically strewn, of course.”
“This song isn’t about shablams,” Draco explained. “It’s about being so crazy, stupidly in love that you see everything through rose-coloured glasses. It’s about finding a love that gives you so much hope after you’ve lived through a really dark time, and you don’t care if it makes you look like a fool.”
“Draco, you’re getting the choreography, but you look a little stiff,” Todric told him. “Just be sure to put some stank on it.”
“Hello to you too,” he raised an eyebrow at them as he set down his contouring brush and picked up the paper to examine it. Teddy peered excitedly over his shoulder. “‘King of Clubs at Royal Vauxhall Tavern,’” he read.
“I’m afraid that’s not a match. Nicole Byer, those sexy Kardashian sisters are starring in a new sci-fi epic, called Star
, several wizards and witches had written letters to the editor expressing their disapproval. Draco’s slight reveal about Hogwarts and Slytherin’s view into the Great Lake (and implied Melvin the Pervy Merman) had rankled an older generation that saw any description of magical life — however veiled — as a violation of the Statute of Secrecy.
“Okay...all right
Venus and Draco smiled in relief and exited to the back of the stage to join Lady Cakes, Paris, Goldie, and Steve. Only Lorena, Kali, and Intoxia remained at the front, awaiting sentencing.
“I get it now!” Draco told the camera. “I thought
“Yeah, about
“I confess I’ve never really spent time around smokers before,” Draco admitted. “Though I’ve heard all about how it’s supposed to be bad for one’s health. If I’m not too bold, may I ask, why start in the first place?”
“What was that?” Malfoy looked at him sharply.
“Well! I dare say
“Okay, Draco,” RuPaul turned to her. “Who do you think should be sent home, and why?”
“I won my second challenge!” Draco gushed. “This is madness!”
“I can look into it,” Draco sighed.
All right, Draco hadn’t expected that.
“AMEN!” they all shouted.
“Very well,” he sighed. “Show me what you’ve got.”
The latter three were in a decidedly testy mood; apparently, their commercial had managed to make RuPaul’s makeup look ugly, and they were each judged harshly. Draco was privately grateful to have escaped the criticism with only Michelle’s complaints about padding.

“C’mere, boo,” Lady Cakes said, and pulled her over. Draco smiled in relief. Lorena joined their team as well.

“Okay, let’s move on to Jameela Jamil. Jameela, what did you say?”
“Well, I can see you have a lot of work to do, so I’ll leave you to it.” RuPaul moved on to Lorena’s work table and proceeded to ask him about Ariana Grande.
“Sign this tax form which will go to the Ministry,” Malfoy instructed, pointing at a line at the bottom of a roll of parchment as Harry dipped his quill into the inkpot. The desk was covered in various sheets of parchment awaiting Harry’s signatures.
—ooo—
Draco nodded.
American problems! We have enough on our plate just dealing with Brisket!”
” Paris said, her eyes practically the size of saucers.
Indeed, Cindy had written a very long message — so long, in fact, that she had had to change to a second shade of lipstick two thirds of the way through.
Draco nodded.
Draco banished the dust from the bed.
Draco was reading on the sofa at Number Twelve Grimmauld Place when a silver panther patronus burst through the wall and sat down on the coffee table in front of him. It rolled its eyes before speaking in Dean Thomas’ voice.
Draco smirked at Lady Cakes, who smirked back in challenge. “Lady Cakes, you may talk about how you wear your cakes on your chest, but
Draco shook his head. “I don’t know! I just learned how to post and check my number of followers!” He wrung his hands. Then a thought occurred to him. “Wait, Thomas said to check the direct messages.”
“I see you finally found a use for your lucky stick and broom,” Kali winked at Draco. Draco peered around the corner and saw the aurors watching them.
Draco smiled. “Thanks,” he said. “Now cut it out, I’m trying to apply eye makeup.” The other queens laughed.
As a woman, Millicent Bulstrode was tall and had a very sturdy-looking build. As a drag king, he resembled an eighteen-year-old boy. He unclasped his cloak to reveal a flattened chest covered by a white button-down shirt with a red and gold tie. He added a pair of round glasses, then turned back to the mirror and transfigured a lighting-bolt scar on his forehead.
Venus shook his head in resignation. “Just when I thought it couldn’t get worse,” he said, “we go and get
“Aww!”
. They referenced everything. It was at times overwhelming for Draco to stay afloat in conversation and the challenges without knowing the tiniest fraction of what they were talking about. If nothing else, he kept adding to his notebook of movies, television programmes, and songs to acquaint himself with after he returned home — and improved his skills in pretending to follow along.
“All right, that’s one song. What are the other two?”
The man — whom Draco now identified as “Dave” according to a little identification card with his face on it by the front window — frowned at him. “Don’t they have seatbelts in the UK?”
moist,” Mary Berry added.
The room supplied them with a giant tube of lipstick.
Draco’s been able to stay on just the right side of the Statute of Secrecy so far, though his performance has rankled a lot of wixen, including one who threatened to retaliate if he slips in a future episode. Harry and Ron have started monitoring the viewing parties for signs of trouble. Harry is also training for an audition for The Great British Bakeoff with help from Draco and Millicent. Heather Villareal, the LA auror assigned to watch him on the set, has mysteriously left the auror force and was replaced by Herb Kong.
“We can hope, right? I certainly don’t think I proved anything to anyone about the existence of magic. I think I’ve only confused them regarding my...
The seven queens gathered around the nearest work table.
“I promise, and I know,” Draco grinned, “That’s part of what makes this project so exciting.”
“I suppose you were too much of a hero for her?” Draco had tried for snide, but as soon as the words were out of his mouth he wanted to bang his head against the wall.
“How bad is it?” Hermione asked sympathetically.
“Whaaaaat?!” Draco cried. He gave the magician a baffled look, his eyes popped and jaw dropped. The queens cheered and applauded.
Crabbe’s ghost looked much as he had during Seventh Year. Thankfully, he didn’t bear any scorch marks or other indications that he’d died in fiendfyre; instead, he was the same tall, muscular-yet-slightly-doughy teen Draco remembered. His worst misfortune appeared to be that he was still stuck in the same Hogwarts uniform. Well, aside from being dead and doomed to haunt the earth for all eternity.
Kali looked to RuPaul, though he was remaining uncharacteristically stoic throughout the debate. Michelle, on the other hand, pursed her lips to hide a smile.
Steve whined in frustration. “No, you
Draco sighed. So much for his revenge.
to have a reason to use my skills on a hateful little tosser like you. Just give me a reason.” He flashed his teeth in a sharklike smile.
“And how are you feeling, Miss Thing? It was almost you in the bottom, too.”
He wanted to warn her that Kali knew that he was a wizard and needed to be obliviated. He wanted to find out if there was an update on his case before the Wizengamot. His mind continued to churn, overthinking and wondering what was happening back home.
“Hmm,” she said, “You have a page labeled ‘US Culture’ and underneath it you’ve written ‘Taco Tuesday,’ ‘Dad Bod,’ ‘Red Carpet Event,’ and ‘Hash Fag: ask Intoxia?’” Lady Cakes looked over to Intoxia. “What’s a hash fag?”
PSA: Bubblegum snow corn snakes are pretty. http://www.allaboutcornsnakes.com/cs_bubblegum_snow.html
“Very well,” Draco said, taking out the supply list to plan his strategy for the quickest possible gathering of books. “Meet me at the register in five minutes.”
Eventually, he had to apparate back to the hotel and get ready for the day’s shooting.
Paris beamed in delight as the other queens clapped.
Draco raised a delicately painted eyebrow. “You can take it off of me later,” she purred. Harry gave her a feral grin.
By this point, Draco found the script page that showed a photo of the character in question. Draco was ready to be a team player. Draco was up for any challenge.
“Well, if you want to get
“Kali’s dancing so hard, the stage looks like someone blew up a Hot Topic in the middle of Buttfuck, Iowa,” Venus narrated.
“It was Harry’s 54th birthday,” Draco began the story for his grandchildren, “and I thought I’d treat him to some Gryffindor-style sex for a change.”

“You know you don’t need a last name, right?” Lady Cakes asked. “How many other Dracos are there?”

“She’s going to have a hell of a time finding someone on such short notice, isn’t she?” Scorpius added.
“Girl, I don’t even know what's going on anymore,” Goldie laughed. “One minute they were talking about laying their edges, and now…?”
Draco blinked in surprise. “There’s a
Then there was his understanding of muggle culture, which had undergone a similar metamorphosis. He was realizing now that he had entered the competition without any real awareness, diving headfirst into a deep ocean of drag culture that was incredibly referential. Queens didn’t just make passing references to queens and goings-on from previous seasons of

“I think this was a breakthrough night for Draco,” Ross said. “I really feel like she stepped up to the plate this week, and she knocked it out of the park.”
“Like Paris’ tuck!” Goldie interjected, and waved jazz hands at Paris’ crotch as Paris posed appropriately.
“I don’t know. I’m trying to choose between Awkwafina and George Takei.”
“Ah, Draco!” He smiled. “I have mail for you.”
Instead, RuPaul declared that both Acacia and Cindy were up for elimination. The two lip synced to
Paris began with “Draco, come here, sweetie,” and gestured for him to come closer.
More of the queens looked over at him now.
queens, and they taught women how to be queens themselves. Does that help?”
Draco wasn’t sure how many of those critics had been attending the viewing parties and seeing exactly how much (or how little) Draco was revealing about the existence of magic to a muggle audience. Rita Skeeter was still writing a weekly column with a synopsis of each episode, and as a result, more people came into the pub to watch the next show on the Bent Unicorn’s enchanted screen. Beyond that benefit, Draco frankly hadn’t given the criticism much thought. If he hadn’t been caught by the MACUSA Aurors for his behavior in LA, he had nothing to fear from a few old grumps with nothing better to do than shout into the void. And he certainly didn't lose sleep over Dolores Umbridge's offence at Draco's impersonation of her.
“Courtney Act was in the Top Three of Season Six,” Draco exclaimed. “I can’t believe I get to meet her in person! Though I hadn’t realized how much time has passed since Season Six. She looked much older than I’d expected.”
Draco wondered what sort of lawyer Harry had found to defend him. Could they stand up against Clearwater? Who would the Wizengamot feel more sympathetic towards? The Malfoy name in general wasn’t as popular as it once was before the war. Draco had made out with the lesser sentence, but still, it had been quite a feat of legal wrangling to talk the Wizengamot down from the lifetime sentence in Azkaban that they had initially planned for Lucius.
“Of course.”
Draco frowned thoughtfully. Dismembering an animal wasn’t anything he had in mind when he wanted to be on
A moment later, Harry showed up. “Are you all right?” he asked.
“You don’t think I know about pop culture?” Draco sneered. “I was Cher, bitch!”
RuPaul laughed. “How does that last one go?”
, and a few nature documentaries. That’s all I can remember.”
“Attitude. Got it,” Draco nodded.
Sneak Peek for Episode 8:

“Birthday cake,” Harry answered, laughing.
Draco vaguely registered the gasps and cries from the judges in front of her — as well as a few queens behind her — as several people raised their hands and shouted, “WERK!” RuPaul herself had dropped her jaw and bugged out her eyes in shock. Draco herself was in something of a state of shock, and stayed in the splits with her arms out on either side for a few beats, catching her breath, before remembering that she still had more song to lip sync.
Draco turned back to the — still unfairly handsome — Chosen One. “I haven’t made up my mind,” he said.
“Naw, not the real one. That’s what I call my flotation device. But she kept me company on the open waters, and I protected her from the sharks with my handy-dandy Swiss army knife.” She held up a tiny pocket knife, eliciting another laugh from RuPaul.
“Venus Flygirl, I’m sorry, but you are up for elimination.” Venus had a look of pained resignation on her face.
“Is this gonna be a Babraham Lincoln challenge?” Goldie asked.
on my friends list,” Crabbe sighed.
Draco shrugged nonchalantly and immediately found himself enveloped in a big bear hug.
Stays are what most people think of when they think of historical corsets. Aunt Aura’s been around since the late 1500s...though please don’t ask about the logistics of a ghost feeling like her corset’s too tight. Um...maybe ghosts have phantom feelings? That’s a lot more world-building than I planned for this fic, but I’m curious to know what you think. Let me know in the comments!
“Good for them.” Draco turned a page and dipped his quill in the inkwell to take another note.
“Let’s get the rest of your books,” Draco said to his son. “Nice chat, Potter.” He nodded briefly in acknowledgment and dashed out of the Charms aisle.
“I must have been watching all the wrong movies.” Actually, the only movie Draco had ever seen was something Harry had taken him to. It had been loud with a lot of fast-moving vehicles and explosions.
Steve-as-Taylor-Swift twirled her hands in the air delicately. “It’s great to be here! Whoo!” she exclaimed at a low, demure volume.
“So, who do you think will be in the bottom two?” Draco asked once they were seated in the Untucked lounge. She took a genteel sip of her drink.
“—So who am I to judge what’s
“Get your shit together, Draco. We’re going out,” Lady Cakes said.
Hermione Granger and Millicent Bulstrode strode purposefully into Draco’s drag room at Number Twelve Grimmauld Place, both of them smiling broadly as Millicent slammed a small flyer onto Draco’s vanity.
“Draco, Draco, Draco,” Michelle shook her head. “Are you going to give us the same silhouette every week?”
“Come on, Girl! We’re doing male street glam. Just a little bit of eye makeup and highlighter,” Goldie said, smearing hot pink eyeshadow above and below her eyes.
“I look up and I see Draco wandering around the room and playing with a feather,” Paris explained. “And I think, ‘What the hell is this bitch doing?’ We’re supposed to be writing jokes for our stand-up routines!”
“Why are you bringing reality into this?” Lady Cakes laughed. “Girl, keep it funny.”
Harry guffawed. “You know you liked it,” he told his husband. “Needless to say, we
“That’s right, this is my
“And,” RuPaul continued, “you’ve won an all-expenses-paid trip to Washington, DC, to be featured in the 20__ Washington Pride Parade.”
“Amen!”
Kali continued on the blond theme. “Draco, with your hair, when you wear green, you look like the world’s largest ear of corn with daddy issues.” RuPaul bent over in laughter. Draco spun in a circle to model his green-and-gold suit and flipped Kali a two-fingered salute as he finished.
“Aww, I’m so sorry to see her go!” Carmelita Corazon whined. She picked up a spray bottle and rag and handed them to Draco. “It’s all your fault she’s gone, so you clean it up,” she said, gesturing toward the message.
Draco shrugged and looked at the other two. “Maybe he has more confidence in his ability to make Lorena disappear at the end of the challenge.”
“We have a winner!” RuPaul announced. The queens cheered. Draco beamed and curtseyed, slightly out of breath.

Draco nodded. That would explain why so many politicians looked positively ancient.
“I’m Harry Po— oh, you know, don’t worry about it,” he said, seeming to change his mind. Maybe he hadn’t completely forgotten how badly Draco had embarrassed himself in her bathroom earlier.
“I was
Lorena narrowed her eyes and opened her mouth as if she were about to say something, but she was cut off.
“Ooh!” Teddy squealed. He grabbed Draco’s elbow. “Please say yes! Please say yes!!” His hair changed to match Millicent’s short, dark locks.
“Literature,” Goyle glared. “For the record, I’m now
“Rude,” he sniffed, “But possible. Anyway, you have my word that I will be more careful in the future.”
The queens formed a line as RuPaul addressed them.
“Am I disappointed that I was picked last?” Draco shrugged. “It’s not about what I know, but

(And please vote in the local elections too, because not voting is how we get so many fuckwits on city councils and in judges’ seats, let alone the White House.)
“Do you need more performers?” Millicent asked. “If you’re arranging a longer drag show, it seems like you might be able to use some backup, right?”
RuPaul just laughed. “Well, we’ll leave you to it. Just find a way to be funny,” he advised, and walked away with Bianca to turn the spotlight onto Goldie.
Suddenly, a door above the werkroom opened.
“But only one if you’re Draco!” Michelle added.
—Confessional—
“Mother!” Draco exclaimed, astonished.
as much as he’d want to see
“I’m not saying you don’t deserve to be here,” Lorena told Steve as she waved her hand with a bored look on her face, gaslighting over what she had said just a few seconds previously.
This was apparently not the answer the judges expected, because a moment of silence filled the set before RuPaul spoke up. “How many TV shows would you say you’ve seen?”
“Whatever we do, we gotta make it funny,” Goldie added. “Maybe one of us could do something like Hair of the Dog for a hangover or something…?”
“Gigs? Do you mean more performances?”
“But you know who else made no sense?” RuPaul asked. “Tammie Brown. And people
Kali-as-Jameela-Jamil waved at the camera. “So Jameela, are you in the Good Place right now?”
“Tell me, what’s the secret to really nailing a cake?”
“Hi,” Draco replied just as eloquently. It was uncomfortably warm for a bookshop, Draco thought as he felt his face heat up. It must have had to do with the large number of customers in the bookstore in early August.
Harry let out a sharp breath and nodded for her to continue.
“Draco’s not so bad,” Harry protested.
“I’m going to do some research.”
“Thank you for coming,” said Draco as he slid into his seat.
“I’m sorry,” he said.
Ron snorted.
sideboards) and chose a bottle of whisky. She refilled both their teacups with it, topping them off with fresh tea.
“Ah well,” said Luna mildly. “I’ve always been partial to love, but I suppose happiness isn’t for everybody.”
“Arthur went back to headquarters. Lump is over there.” With a fond smile, Sirius pointed at the settee, where Lump was sprawled over a sleeping Draco. They looked cute together, the sloppy cat and the elegant man, who was so handsome in his sleep, almost delicate…
“Well?” said Draco irritably, “What happened?”
“Me too,” said Harry. “I just wish I could talk to whoever’s responsible.”
He had barely been furrowing his brow at the computer for two minutes when his mobile rang. It was Hermione, of course.
“I’m fairly certain most corporations use some form of cloud storage,” said Draco drily. “Even I have noticed that trend.”
“Aren’t they?”
“It’s good to be home,” he told his father, who smiled.
“Well, we’d best be off. Al, Lily.”
HP: dont worry i wont
Harry felt weak at those words, but managed to say, “Make me,” because, after all, this was Malfoy.
“That’s it, this is humiliating,” said Harry. “I’m leaving.” And he drained the rest of his wine glass and stood, turning to walk out of the restaurant. He thought he could hear Draco saying something as he walked away, but he tuned out his surroundings--until he bumped squarely into someone.

In fact, everyone in the room was so concerned with their own business that no one even noticed the face that had appeared in the fire not a minute since.
“I’m glad you liked it,” said Sirius softly.
“Get out of my sight,” he said.
Friday, they went the the Malfoy family’s favorite jeweler, where they selected their desired stones and settings. Draco’s garnet was a deep red, and Harry’s emerald was, predictably, green.
“I’ve married Sherlock Holmes!” Ginny crowed. “Look at his face! It’s true, isn’t it?”
“Yeah,” said Ron, “and he said you skived off yesterday, too.”
“Look, I know you’re not going to—abandon me or anything.” Harry furrowed his brow. That had come out sounding like an accusation. “Really, I do, I mean, that wasn’t a jab at you or anything—”
“I was the Weasley boy’s pet rat,” said Pettigrew, sounding almost proud.
He stumbled to the toilet, then took a painkiller and went back into his room. Finding his phone was dead, he set it to charge before pulling on a shirt and heading downstairs.
Draco responded with a sharp glance. “The locket is Tom’s.”
“Right,” said Harry, in shock. “Right. Did he leave his name?”
“Oh!” Understanding dawned on Harry’s face, followed by a wide grin. “That’s great, Al. He’s a great kid. And I’m so
“Then you know what to do.”
Harry laughed. Molly nodded again. Then she told Harry he was too thin, called Victoire back into the room, and sat them both down to be fed.
“In all my life,” he finally said, “I’ve never had one thing that’s mine. I mean, just mine.”
“I thought you wanted to get to know me,” said Draco. “I thought you’d want to know how it cut me every time Tom texted me about the beautiful green-eyed boy whom he’d like to--”
“Harry--” Hermione began apologetically, but Ginny held up her hand for silence.
There was a pause, during which Amy examined the artfully stacked skulls and bones with horrified fascination. Then there was a patter of feet as she caught up with the other two.
“How you ended up married to him I’ll never understand,” Harry observed to Hermione.
HP: yeah
Harry let out a breath he’d been holding all year.
Ron swallowed his food, then grinned. “You love me.”
“Thank you,” said Harry.
His hereditary peerage in the House of Lords, Draco figured, was subject to a vote amongst the other peers, so if he disgraced himself enough by the time his father passed it on, he could conceivably be voted out. That, along with excessive martini consumption and the occasional
“Nope,” said Harry firmly, turning away so Sirius couldn’t see his lying face. “That cat is the devil.”
“Excellent,” said Lucius drily. “Tomorrow at nine?”
Then he had it. He groaned. “Father, tell me you’re not seeing Mrs. Potter.”
“You mean--my mum and dad could do magic?”
“Ah.” Theo furrowed his brow and let the doors open. He led Draco into a brightly lit, sterile hallway that heavily featured concrete in its design concept. “A lot of work we’re doing with D.E.P. is happening in their labs, or in the field. I can show you around a bit, but ultimately I think the records room will be the most help in bringing you up to speed.”
Don’t drink it, idiot.
“Exactly. And your life up till now has been people using you. Everyone you meet. You saved them, all of them. Now that it’s over, it’s not your job to soothe their consciences about it. It’s your job to be as happy as you can manage in this shithole of a world.”
“You need an ally with sufficient wealth and power to hold sway against D.E.P.,” Draco said. “You need the Malfoy Corp. You need my father.”
Draco shuddered. “Perhaps
“Hermione,” Ron muttered.
“Well, a Cambridge man has work to do. I trust an Oxford toff can see himself out?”
“Why do I doubt that?” Draco lit his cigarette and inhaled. He tried to focus on the sweet relief of it, but Harry’s voice insisted on cutting in.
“From clothes,” Amy clarified.
faggot,” spat Vernon. “Just when I think you couldn’t sink any lower, Potter…”
“I was in my office, doing paperwork, when in comes Tom. Holding a cup of coffee. Which he hands over to me. Claims he just wanted to say hello.”
“And your kink for insufferable snobs,” Ginny interrupted.
“I’ve got us each a chocolate croissant,” Pansy announced, thrusting a paper bag at him. “I thought, if the situation is really as dire as you claimed, we might as well both get fat.”
They let Ron think that their affair had been torrid and passionate, because it was funny to watch his face when they described it that way, but it wasn’t the truth. Toward the end, “old times” had mostly involved living like kids at a sleepover, complete with pranks, late-night movies watched while bingeing on crisps, and actual hair-braiding. It had been fun, but not particularly healthy. As Hermione had pointed out when she visited one night and walked in on Ginny painting Harry’s nails as they gossiped about which of Ginny’s fellow footballers had the best arse. So, they had broken up.
“A collaboration with Death Eater Pharmaceuticals.”
Harry nodded thoughtfully. Vernon and Dudley
For one thing, they were spectacularly in love. To the exclusion, it would become clear, of all else. The passion had been there since they first met. The affection was new, and it was delicious.
“Can you,” said Harry, relishing the heavy sarcasm on his tongue. (The Dursleys hadn’t approved of sarcasm).
“Disgusting,” said Pansy, “Were you raised in a barn?”
“That’s why
“Yes--well--” Draco cleared his throat. “Thank you. Right then, your parents, Harry.”
Harry climbed the stairs to find his younger son facedown on his bed in a right snit.
When they put their books down, Harry was fixing Draco with a determined look.
“Potter’s definitely queer.”
“Harry Potter speaking.”
to me,” Harry objected.
Draco frowned. His father might talk a big game about the Gentleman’s Life of Leisure, but it was never, he had long since realized, the pursuit of ease that motivated Lucius. Rather, it was the pursuit of power. It never made much sense to Draco. Enough power to ensure one’s safety and comfort--that was a desirable thing, if one didn’t have it to start out with. But when one was born a multi-millionaire, the pursuit of further clout quickly became a laborious game of diminishing returns. But Draco’s father seemed incapable of staying on the sidelines. It seemed that Theo Nott Jr. was much the same way.
..to the noble cause.”
“Right,” Sirius muttered, looking around the room. “Right.
“Really,” said Ron.
“Right then,” said Harry. “I’d say it was nice chatting with you, but, well, you know.” And with that, he disappeared down the fire escape. Seconds later, Tom stepped onto the balcony, godlike in his black satin pajama pants, hair mussed, bare chest gleaming in the porchlight. He pinched Draco’s arse in greeting and then stole his cigarette, taking a deep drag.
“Charming,” said Draco. “Just when I thought my girlish figure was all I had going for me.” He reached in and took out his croissant, immediately stuffing it into his mouth.
Harry stared. He’d figured about Dumbledore and Grindelwald, but it was surreal to have it confirmed.
Draco smirked slightly. “Give me the bottle.”
“You’re pretty used to this, aren’t you?” Harry asked quietly. “Being on the run?”
“Oh, Harry,” said Dumbledore, sounding disappointed. “Is that truly
Draco brought his hand to his brow in frustration. “Perhaps you could explain to me how you came to that conclusion,” he said.
“Great,” Harry muttered, sinking back down into his seat. “Er, I mean, thanks, Dennis. Who is it?”
“Good point.”
He was going to work.
“It was
“Damn right I do,” Aberforth grumbled.
Harry was suddenly awash with fury of an intensity he hadn’t felt since he’d left the Dursleys’. He practically snarled, “Fuck you.”
“Believe it,” said Draco, wiggling into the space he’d commandeered on the Gryffindor bench between Seamus and Dean.
“Right. Best not, then.”
“Don’t tell Hermione about the rats,” said Harry. “She’ll have you in an animal rights suit faster than you can say ‘
“Maitre’d,” Amy murmured.
The young woman winced. “Greengrass, actually. Lucius is ready for you any time, so you can go on through. Just knock first.”
Welcome back. Hope everyone is getting by all right.
“Rugged.”
“We don’t mind sharing,” said Amy, arranging Lump in the space between their pillows.
Draco knocked on the door, and Harry opened it. There was a moment of awkwardness as the two tried to decide how to greet each other, which ended with Harry going in for a hug and Draco fumbling it into a side-hug.
“I don’t like that,” said Sirius. “I may have a way to get in touch with...the right people to investigate that.”
Possibly more than once. Yes, he thought he’d break his rule for Harry.
“Perhaps not. But the example demonstrates the principle.”
“Are those
“That’s not tequila,” Harry said, because he was at a loss for anything
To: Harry Potter
Kingsley was nearly back to his office before Harry realized he wanted to talk to him, so he ran after him.
“I didn’t want to assume,” said Draco. “You know Death Eaters. She could’ve been describing anybody.”
Draco answered her with a nonverbal curse, and the duel began.
“Harry Potter,” said Draco. “You’re the Boy Martyr.”
Mr. Chatwal raised his eyebrows, but he only said, “All right,” and waved Harry out of his office.
For his not-a-date that night, he’d put on his nicest shirt, a faded purple button-down that showed him to some advantage, despite being a little big on him. As Draco worked his
“Scorpius,” said his father warningly.
“I do not trust you,” said Lucius.
Draco stepped forward, beckoning to Harry. Harry grabbed Amy’s hand and led her to the archway.
“Congratulations, ‘Arry, Draco,” said Fleur. Draco responded to her in French, which made her smile, and they began chattering.
Harry looked at Albus attentively.
been eating at my desk
“Ah!” Draco exclaimed. “Well, that explains things. Harry Potter, this is my cousin, Sirius Black.”
“Yeah, pipe down,” said Ron. “We’re about to talk about Harry Potter’s feelings. D’you lot know how rare that is?”
“I dunno,” said Harry. “Luna said that Draco’s, um. A part of me.”
“I can fill in the blanks,” said Draco eagerly. “There’s rather a lot I’d like to know, as well.”
Al laughed and bumped noses with Scorpius. “It’s going to be fine, Scorpy.”
“Your plan,” said Voldemort thoughtfully, “seems to rely rather heavily on your charms and Potter’s predilections.”
“What part of ‘I have to work to survive’ doesn’t compute for you?”
“I’m, er.” Draco sipped his drink. “Not opposed.”
, voted Labour.
“Ignore him,” she said firmly.
“Yes,” said Harry, because he had long since lost the knack of lying to Luna.
“I did tell you,” Draco sniffed.
“What? Haven’t you got it now? Just give it here and we’ll have done with it, yeah?” said Harry, a bit desperately. God, he was tired of sounding desperate. When would he be able to put this whole mess with Tom behind him?
If possible, the waiter’s eyes widened even more.
If Arthur Weasley had just a bit more common sense, he would have withdrawn himself from the Floo as soon as he realized Sirius had company. But curiosity had a tendency to override his self-preservation, a flaw that he had, regrettably, passed on to most of his children.
Silvertooth’s eyes lit up. “They’ll have me sitting at Ripjaw’s right hand for our next Counting Day feast if you are proposing what I think you are.”
“I don’t like children, either,” said Draco. “Doesn’t mean they don’t deserve to run about and play, or whatever it is they do.”
“So who is it? Obviously it’s not Weasley, and not even you would be daft enough to try and split up Thomas and Finnegan.”
Amy put her hand on Harry’s knee, squeezing.
Breakfast was sufficient, but lacked of good company.
“Of course I do!” said Sirius. “What other kind is there?”
“Well, you can’t always help it,” Harry observed.
“Er, I have my rent?” said Harry, confused.
The man, almost as short as Harry and with black hair to his shoulders, said something exuberant that began with “
Hedwig meowed. He put the food down on the floor and petted her as she ate.
Angrily, almost in spite of himself, Harry grabbed his wine glass. As he drank, he rationalized to himself that it would be unwise for his now unemployed arse to turn down free alcohol. And the wine was nice--he wasn’t the sort to appreciate what made it different from other wines, but it was a bit fruity and obviously better than the swill he usually bought for himself. He gulped it down.
“You look presentable,” Draco sniffed. “You should be thanking me.”
Harry kissed him. “It’s perfect.”
“Harry.” George put a hand on his shoulder. “You need to talk to Mum.”
“Dad?” Albus asked.
“The working theory,” said Draco, “is that whatever accident that led to the Dark Lord’s--er--sabbatical, attacked Harry’s magic, taking it but sparing his life.”
As their sight came back and their ribs expanded again, they looked around. They appeared to be underground, in some sort of system of dark tunnels.
“Do you
eat it? Amy’s the vegetarian here.”
“You’re right, but, look--this isn’t a conversation we can have in the loo. Just come with me, all right?”
“Harry!” she said in a scolding voice, “You’ve gone and got engaged!”
“I know the word, Scorpius. It’s just that you mumbled it the first time. You
. Jesus fucking Christ.
Harry wanted his drink, but that hardly mattered now. He wanted to say something cruel to Tom, but he couldn’t speak.
“Wait,” said Ginny, “we’re talking about
Harry snorted. “Some boyfriend you are.”
“Fuck off.” Harry looked up, caught Draco’s gaze, held it. “I’m really frightened.”
“One day,” Hagrid continued, “‘e reached a little too far. Scared Fang.”
“Amy Hopkins. Harry, Amy, this is Silvertooth, my account manager. She can be trusted to see to our needs with efficiency and discretion.” Harry thought that was an odd remark, but the goblin smiled a pointy, dangerous smile.
Harry came up running on fumes. He came up spitting grave dirt. His every step was a maddening clatter, hollow bones dragging at his feet. Every drink was bitter in the back of his throat. Every bite of food was gritty with ash. He’d let death touch him, and now he was tainted.
“Family Dinner,” Draco echoed.
“I meant, said Harry tightly, “that he didn’t give it to me, not really. It was a loan, not a gift. He made that plain.”
The two Malfoys grinned at each other. Divided they may be from time to time, as is the way with any father and son, but they were united in the love of an awkward Potter.
“Hermione,” said Harry, “D’you think I’ll ever fall in love?”
learned my name.” The sound of a throat clearing had him looking up into the face of a sleep-mussed Draco.
“I never
“It’s all right,” he said.
Sirius smiled wanly. “I said your hair was the most color I’d seen in twelve years. How did we celebrate when Fred and George came of age?”
“I should go,” said Harry. He shouldn’t have been there in the first place, he realized all at once, though he couldn’t just leave the pub at the time. He had needed--
Harry was silent for a long moment, wondering how to respond.
“He asked some weird questions. He knew some weird things. Amy, he knew about my parents. And then he said--” Harry broke off and shook his head. It was too strange, too ridiculous, too upsetting to repeat.
“Oh.”
Ron sat down, wearing the smug expression he always did when he saw an opportunity to offer romantic advice ‘from the perspective of a married man.’ Luna was nodding serenely, Ginny’s eyes alight with the intent to mock him mercilessly. Hermione, though, had caught on.
“Malfoy,” said Harry. “I really hate him.”
Thanks for stopping in. This is just my casual reminder that our boys are -not- behaving like adults, and that, even though they are being fairly responsible with matters of consent, they are -not- displaying appropriate kink negotiation. Emotional constipation makes for good drama, but don't try it at home, kids!
“I’m not staying,” Harry pointed out.
“Hnng,” was about as verbal as Harry seemed able to manage.
“Eurgh,” said Harry, “I can’t decide if it’s creeping me out or getting me hard, but either way, this isn’t the best time?”
Amy looked over to Harry, who shook his head frantically. She turned back to the intercom.
They clung to each other and laughed and cried. They were a mess.
“Why do you care?” Draco returned.
Molly gave another of her decisive nods. “If he’s good for you, Harry dear, then he’ll be welcome here.” She paused, pressed her lips together, and added, “no matter who I have to drag to the table by the ear to make it so.”
“You’re making me sound like some kind of teenager with a crush,” Harry grumbled.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I was referring to the stature of your brutishness.”
“Two years now,” Draco responded, just as quietly.
“What do you mean, two of the three of us?” Harry asked apprehensively.
“Nothing to it, you great tosser.” She got on her tiptoes to kiss his forehead--they were the same height, so it was easy enough--and went out the door.
“Mcgonagall was nice,” said Harry, but there was a touch of uncertainty in his voice.

“How come I can’t see when
Harry laughed.
“You must resent us terribly,” she’d observed out of a quarter hour’s silence as she patted soft peat over the head of a baby mandrake.

where so much in life was and always had been wrong.
Draco leapt out of his seat, springing up and sliding on his belly across the Headmaster’s desk to wrap the old man in his arms.
request the presence of the muscle, but I suppose it can’t be helped.”
“Why were you up all night?” Harry asked at last.
“Did too!”
“How horrifying.”
The blond raised his eyebrows, but stepped aside and waved the next person on. Harry quickly lost himself in taking orders, giving pleasant smiles, letting his fingers fly over keys they knew by heart. This was the part he didn’t mind so much about his job--when he could go on autopilot and just forget. It wasn’t a happy feeling, exactly, but it was much better than most of the feelings he had experienced in his life.
“Their funeral,” said Theo with a shrug. “Not a risk we’re willing to take.”

with me,” said Harry, caught between hilarity and despair.
Harry cleared his throat again. “Erm, well, I know it was hard for you both when your mum and I split up. But it’s been a while and I hope you won’t—I mean I hope it’ll be okay for you to hear that—I’m seeing someone.”
Draco Malfoy's crash course in Wizarding history; includes alimentary adventure and the introduction of an important character.
“I wasn’t aware you had interests in common with the office,” said Harry sharply. “You
“Sorry,” he said, “thoughtless of me. You wanted jam and Devonshire cream with that?” The irate woman nodded. Harry slapped processed packages of jam and cream onto the plate with the greasy scone and said, “There you are. Your latte will be right out.”
“C’mon, Harry. Just for an hour.” Ron swallowed. “Mum misses you.”
Harry was minding his business, walking down the hall, when suddenly he was pulled into an alcove by an inexplicable magnetic force. He crashed right into Draco Malfoy.
“Yeah,” said Harry, but he wasn’t sure he said it loud enough for Ron to hear.
Molly was waiting. She looked him up and down.
Bill had said, “Now, Ginny, there’s no need for nasty insinuations like that. Harry is family. Let’s try to be civil.”
They walked into the living room to find the entire Weasley family assembled. There was a chorus of dutiful greetings from the adults, and of enthusiastic ones from the children, though they all refrained from embracing their Uncle Harry until the presence of the strange man was accounted for.
“I texted you last night,” said Harry weakly.
Before Tom could respond, Draco jumped in. He looked right at Harry. “Don’t be ridiculous, love. You have a date to keep with me tonight. Tom can always find another time for a chat with you, can’t you, Tom?”
Harry swallowed. He, himself, was curious about the same thing. “I need a drink.”
Voldemort hissed. He knew where his best interests lay. “This is most unfortunate.”
“I’ve pondered that,” said Draco, “and I found a solution in what I must admit was one of my secondary motives for proposing this plan.”
And then Sirius was on him, arms around him and shaking with seismic sobs. Harry froze at first, but then he thought,
They were partway up a dim servants’ staircase when Sirius made a harassed noise and stopped dead. He drew out his wand--fuck, was Harry
Finally, Harry found his voice.
charm, ascertaining that they still had over an hour before they had to leave for the train station. He smirked.
“Of course you do,” said Draco, patting his bicep soothingly.
Arthur look flummoxed. “I--I couldn’t say. Rather beyond me to keep track of that sort of thing, what with seven of them running around.”
“I’m sorry, darling, but I simply couldn’t get to you till this morning.”
“Well,” said Ron when he was ready, “because I’m
After his shower, and a quick Google search to find out what the fuck 'apertifs' were supposed to be, Harry found himself able to arrange the dinner with astonishing speed. Hermione demanded to see the notes that very evening, and Draco agreed that he probably wouldn’t sleep again till they’d talked. Harry dressed himself, went shopping, and set to.
“You’ll have to be more specific,” Albus deadpanned.
“That you should have drowned Potter in the lake when you had the chance. I said that when we were thirteen, didn’t I?”
—Confessional—
“And that means…?”
One by one, Mesmer Jones taught each queen a “magic trick.” Draco stifled a giggle when the magician showed Paris how to make flowers appear out of a plastic wand. He pursed his lips together and hugged himself, struggling against more giggles as Lady Cakes learned how to make a coin appear and disappear. When Goldie worked on magically hiding a salami, the giggles could no longer be contained. Draco covered his mouth, his shoulders shaking, his face turning bright pink. The other queens shot him quizzical looks.
ME?!” he cried, rising from his chair.
“Who cares?!” Ross cried. “It was stunning.”
“MULTIPASS!” Venus lip synced, wide-eyed, holding up a badge. The relief on her face was palpable as her solo ended.
The queens clapped politely as the camera flashed to a still image of Lorena posing on the same set as Draco, but standing in front of the back wall, back-to-back with Season One queen Nina Flowers. In the workroom, Lorena put her hands up to her face and gave a joyful little curtsy.
“What. The
He flew around for a few more minutes before he saw a witch flying directly towards him.
Draco and Harry had been sharing a table at the Bent Unicorn with the unlikely combination of Hermione Granger, Pansy Parkinson, Millicent Bulstrode, Blaise Zabini, and Ron Weasley. The girls all cracked up into uncontrollable giggles. Harry’s jaw had hit the floor and he looked at Draco with surprise.

“Well. If he
“Wait a minute!” RuPaul interrupted. “Why, this tea table is set for two! We need another queen to join the party!”
“Aww, Carmelita,” Venus Flygirl sighed as she saw the other queen’s farewell message in lipstick on the mirror, which simply read “
Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), The Terminator - Lorena
“Okay, okay, we’re going to go now,” the bystanding friend interjected, looking between Draco and the nine other queens in their party and apparently deciding the fight wasn’t worth it. He grabbed his friend by the shoulders and swiveling him around. “Sorry, folks. He’s drunk and gonna sleep this off. Enjoy the rest of your evening!” And with that, the two men turned and walked away, leaving the queens alone.
At the end of the runway, she turned her back to the judges.
“Oh, right!” Blaise held up the newspaper he had brought with him. “I thought you might want to see this.
to even go to his own hearing. He’d probably have to accept defeat and sashay away in the next challenge.
this is part of the NMCS package!” she simpered with saccharine delight. “Don’t you want the no-mags to be convinced that you have flown the friendly skies? It’s only appropriate that you arrive looking just as tired and annoyed as if you got off a long flight and went through the regular US Customs.”
“I love you.” Harry whispered, broken and jagged.
“Yes.”
“Lumos,” the medics said almost in unison, casting bright lights garishly over the alley. They descended in swift motions, pulling back the cloak and noting the blood splatters across the wall. One man, older than the other two, waved the younger medics closer to the body. His gloved hand reached down to check the body. Henry, Harry reminded himself, they bent to check Henry.
“Indeed I have.” Cormac replied, “Care to tell me how you were the first to the scene this time, Auror Potter?”
Liquid the color of grape jelly was poured into a martini glass and handed to Harry. He took it carefully, and inspected the sugar that was along the rim. Harry lifted it to his lips. It was sweeter than grape jelly and tasted more like gummy bears. It was good and it took a few seconds for the burn of the alcohol to set in.
Harry choked on his take-away roast beef and potatoes that he had gotten from the pub a few nights ago. He set down his plate thoughtfully. “You know I can’t say much, but honestly we don’t know anything.” Harry repeated for the fourth time this lunch. His mind came back to the pictures of the victims on the wall of the task force office, neatly pinned and labeled. Each victim had one of them alive, smiling or winking at the viewer, and one of them dead, motionless. As of yet there didn’t seem to be a connection between them. Despite the prophet’s wild claims about Henry’s death, not all of the victims were muggle born.
Her creamy skin, spiced like cider, was warm where her arm touched Harry’s. The sunlight was hot on the rocks, the summer day burning off as the night tried to fall. Fireflies danced in the heavy air surrounding the burrow.
“Alrigh’ Harry?” Ron asked as he sat backwards in an office chair across his childhood friend. His paper bag lunch was crumpled in his hands.
“It’s a nice change of pace.” The bushy haired girl replied and pulled an apple from her bag and took a large bite.
“It’s his own fault.” Hermione chimed in as she appeared at their side suddenly. She pulled a chair closer to them and sat in it. “If you would only do it when you are supposed to, you wouldn’t get so far behind.”
Duncan shuffled, pulling his auror robes around him like a barrier from the world. “What do we know?”
West sighed, “I am aware of who you are, Potter. I mean to suggest that you will use a spell to disguise yourself and then you will ask some questions around Linsbury Ave.”
On one end of the room was a bar, a long glass topped furniture that ran the whole length of the room. Harry made his way to it out of habit, avoiding the middle of the room. He leaned over and shouted to the bartender that he needed a drink. After a pause he ordered the special.
Draco’s eyebrow rose towards his hairline, “Are you having a seizure?” Before Harry could answer Draco continued, “or is that meant to be dancing?”
Ron’s eyes bulged, “Mate.” His words spoke of the sympathy that only another auror can have at the red tape that must be endured by every department in the ministry of magic.
Ron brightened, “Well then, ‘monie has something that she has been meaning to ask you. She has this friend from records-”
After some nit picking I decided to go ahead and post the second chapter as well. Hope you enjoy!
“Cormac has been riding me to get some of this paperwork filed by the end of this week,” he explained with a gesture at the towers of parchment.
“What I wouldn’t give to get my feet wet on a real case.” Harry commented with a sigh as he took a bite of his own sandwich.
Harry’s flat was dark and empty when he got home. A quick wave of his wand and the lights flickered into life. In the half-light ghosts and shadows lingered in every corner. Harry put the kettle on to try and sober himself. His eyes darted to a napkin stained with ink and a coffee ring. On the clean side two words had been scrawled there. ‘Thank you.’
“Brilliant deduction.” Malfoy replied, with a dramatic roll of his black lined eyes. “What are you doing here?”
“Relax,” cautioned Harry’s mentor, as he put his arms up in the air and began swaying with the music too.
Duncan nodded. As soon as they spoke, the wizards appeared. Their green robes swirling as the three cracks split the night. Aurors quickly moved to close the wards around them again. The sight of the crime was carefully protected from civilians.
Months later there was still space in his bed where Ginny had been, but her stuff was gone. Her clothes no longer hung in his closet. Harry’s bathroom suddenly had more room in the medicine cabinet. Ginny was gone, and Harry was...alright.
When Harry returned to the ministry Cormac was waiting for him, office door ajar. The light from his desk lamp shone on his aging face. Cormac was a very detailed man. His robes were in perfect folds and his eyebrows and beard were kept neat. He had brown eyes that were unusually sharp as they landed on Harry as he came to the doorway.
“You’re gay?!” Harry finally managed, voice cracking like a teen once again.
Hours of paperwork later, Harry penned a note to Ron that he wouldn’t be able to make it to dinner with him and Hermione that night. He didn’t bother to mention the girl he was meant to meet as well. He did write sorry and say it was for work. The brown owl left another feather on the floor of the ministry owlery as it took off. Harry hadn’t managed to get another owl since the war. It just didn't seem right.
Harry hoped he would leave then, but instead Malfoy made himself comfortable and started to dance on the spot. Draco turned away and Harry watched his shoulder blades.
“Moine!” Ron greeted his girlfriend with a quick peck to her cheek, “can they spare you in records?”
Ginny straightened up and shifted the apple between her hands. “I...don’t know.” her smile was gone, weak as under steeped tea. “I just...need someone to talk to.”
No one else approached Harry that night and when he stopped by the diner to ask some questions he was sure that the charm was still working. Somehow Draco had simply seen through the spell. Harry resigned to talk to West about it the next day. He was too tired to go on any farther, and it was well after midnight.
“Your comebacks are as scathing as ever I see” Draco drawled, “Well as much as I missed this little game we play, I’ve got better things to do with my night than fight with my schoolboy rival.” He started to saunter away, but turned at the last moment, “See you later, Potter.” After managing to get the last word, he was gone; disappeared into the crowd.
That done, Harry set about doing his assignment. With a complicated swirl of his wand he was hidden in the crowd; unremarkable once again. There was a certain sense of calm that overcame him. Knowing that at least for tonight he wouldn’t be famous Harry Potter.
“It’s alrigh’ mate.” Ron said, opening the bag into his lap. He pulled out a sandwich and took a bite. “Been busy?” He asked and the question was loaded.
Harry looked up at the ceiling, trying to picture the inside of his vault. “I think there are about thirteen or fourteen piles,” he answered.
Draco peeled off the other glove to find another wrist brace. “
“Yes you did!” Goldie insisted. “We were riding in this van after filming and you said you saw an owl attack Draco!”
Ivana rushed to his side. “You can sew it. Just put some tape on the bottom of the foot so it can slide through the machine.”
“How charitable of you,” he replied.
“Oh, you know, I’m going to keep writing songs, but instead of writing about ex-boyfriends, all of my songs will be about my cats.” She giggled.
Draco walked in and looked around. Aside from a few scorch marks on a far window, there was nothing to see at all.
Lady Cakes stared at Draco for a moment, then scoffed. “Okay, first, how in the hell did you fit those down your top? They’re bigger than your tits.” Draco shrugged. Lady Cakes shook her head. “Second,
“I wouldn’t put it like that—”
After what felt like an eternity, the not-Knight-Bus finally stopped in front of a hotel and Dave got out, opening Draco’s door and going to the back to remove his luggage. Draco closed his eyes and breathed slowly, never more grateful to have stopped moving. It took him a minute to figure out how to release himself from his chair strap before he could be free of the muggle vehicle of almost-death and escape its terrifying maw.
“I don’t understand what I could bring to an
After both teams performed, the queens changed into their runway looks. The theme was “Red Carpet Realness.” Draco proudly stepped down the runway in a peplum jacket and pencil skirt. She was confident that she understood the challenge better than the other queens, who were oddly dressed in sequined and beaded gowns that had nothing to do with carpet.
“At this rate, you won’t have any problem getting cast on
After Steve screwed up the same cue for the tenth time, he sat down heavily on a stool and whined pitifully. “I just feel so stupid,” he confessed, starting to cry. “I’ll never get this choreography!” Suddenly, he was enveloped by five queens, each wrapping an arm around him.
“Welcome back to Smells Like Fish!” Acacia said. “I’m here with Draco, who’s going to show us how to get rid of a pesky hangover.” Draco smiled at the camera and waved. “Now, what have you got for us?”
“You’re not,” Venus said gleefully. “You’re Benedict Cumberbatch now!” she laughed.
Draco chuckled. “You don’t know my mother.” She frowned. “Come to think of it, maybe
“Hmm,” she uttered by way of reply, looking at the ocean instead of him.
“What are you doing here, anyway? I would have thought you’d be in the Great Hall chumming it up with your fan club.”
“Lorena Gucci, tonight on the runway, you served us a bombshell. But during the debate, you...
“Everybody has to pay taxes, mate,” Ron said, knocking out one of Harry’s pawns with his rook. Harry sighed.
Lady Cakes looked surprised, but then winked and pantomimed pulling a zipper across his lips. He didn’t ask about the owl, either, for which Draco was grateful.
Millicent beamed. She went up to the vanity and pulled out her wand. Over the course of a minute, she transfigured the shape of her face, turned her eyes green, and added a faint five o’clock shadow.
The choreographer pointed at Draco. “Ballroom, ballet, and English Set,” he responded. Venus said she knew ballet and hip-hop, which lit up Todric’s eyes.
Draco tossed and turned in bed that night. His mind kept reminding him of the countless times Lucius had disapproved of him.
As the instrumental of the song’s opening bars played through, Draco pulled a folded-up piece of parchment from her bra. She unfolded it and raised it to her lips, kissing it near the bottom, before lowering it and gazing reverently at it. She sighed. She looked up to the judges in time to lip sync the first few words.
“From the beaches of Afghanistan,” RuPaul drawled.
He finally located the section with seventh-year Charms books and grabbed one off the shelf only to see the face of Harry Potter looking back at him.
Malfoy always did have the most elegant fingers, which were now sliding along the sheet of parchment as he read and analyzed the numbers it contained. Harry couldn’t help silently appreciating them.
The book burst into flames, distracting Crabbe and Goyle from their argument. They all watched as it burned, then disappeared into a pile of ashes.
“Hmm,” Emma answered, “I’m going to say it’s called
—At the Viewing Party—
He took it back. Muggle culture was every bit as horrifying as he’d been taught. As Dave helped him take his luggage up to the hotel doors, Draco reminded himself that he had made a commitment to this adventure. Harry had warned him it wouldn’t be easy. But Draco was determined. He could
“For this week’s mini challenge, you’re all going to be models!” RuPaul told them. The queens cheered. “Produce section models, that is.” A few queens shot him saucy looks.
After the episode ended, Draco introduced Harry Gryffindor for his first performance. The crowd roared. Knuts, sickles, and even a few galleons soared onto the stage. To Draco’s utter dismay, Harry Gryffindor was a hit, that bitch.
“I wrote down
“I had to think about this for a while to figure out what that could be, and then I remembered how much Harry likes flying. And apparently there’s this thing that muggles came up with called the ‘Mile-High Club’ for when they get in their airplanes and have a bit of fun up in the air,” he explained.
“Draco!” Blaise Zabini walked up to the pair of them and shook Draco’s hand. Zabini was one of the few members of their class who had managed to dodge wrinkles and graying hair, though Draco strongly suspected that liberal applications of hair-dying and wrinkle-blasting potions were at play, judging by the waxy appearance of Zabini’s skin. His robes were in the style popular with Scorpius’ age group — which would have been perfectly acceptable on someone twenty years younger, but looked just a bit ridiculous at their age. Even Lucius had never been so vain.
“Prepare to be amazed…”
—Confessional—
“I’m Goldie Hanako,” she added, holding out her hand before Draco could answer. Draco took it and they shook hands so gently it felt more like a limp hand-holding.
did you go there?”
“Welcome, ladies!” RuPaul addressed the queens as they lined up at the front of the stage. “Based on your three ball looks, I’ve made some decisions. When I call your name, please step forward,” she instructed.
Millicent cried as Harry started to leave, “Oi, Potter, let’s have another of your cheese puffs before you give them all away to the masses!”
“Whaaaaat?!” Draco cried. He gave the magician a baffled look, his eyes popped and jaw dropped. The queens cheered and applauded.
“You’ll have to decide how and where you pose,” RuPaul explained. “Let’s do it! Choose your first position.”
“Well, look who’s back,” Ivana said loudly, cutting off Cindy, who looked ready to fire back at Acacia. “How did rehearsal go, girls?”
“Come on,” Steve tugged on his hand and smiled. “We need to get your makeup finished so you can tell us all how to cure a hangover.”

“Goyle, do
“And....GO!” RuPaul finished, and the queens rushed to their stations.
Courtney raised her eyebrows. “Really, that long!” Draco frowned. “This must be quite a grand adventure for you,” Courtney continued. “Well, if you need help, I suppose I could offer a few suggestions for how we might approach this photo shoot.”
Afterward, the queens reentered the stage for judging.
With that, Scorpius was off. Draco snuck into the Charms section and pushed past a woman who was trying to look at first-year books while managing three squirrelly toddlers.
“I don’t want to go home!” Intoxia cried. “I’ve just got to turn. This. Out.” He snapped his fingers.
Sneak Peek for Episode 9:
Kali laughed as she wiped away the message. “Girl, don’t say that! We don’t need any more bitches coming back this season!”
“Yes, he mentioned he’s visited you and your brother.” Draco didn’t feel any jealousy or resentment there. None at all.
“Steve Donovan, Intoxia Madison, you’re both safe. You may join the other girls.” They both thanked RuPaul and went to the back.
“I imagine there’s a lot about me that might surprise you, then.”
“We gotta get some sightseeing in while we’re here, don’t you think?” Paris said. “We’ve got our native guide — Miss Venus here —” Venus curtsied. “And we’re gonna see the Chinese Theater, and the Walk of Fame, and most importantly—”
“Ms. Hanako,” Rachel Maddow asked, “if you won the wig party nomination, which one of these queens would you choose as your running mate, and why?”

“In ten years.”
“Can you believe this? I never thought I’d live to see the Hogwarts elves serve cocktail weenies.” Potter chuckled. “Could you imagine any of our professors eating something like this?” He winked. Honest to Merlin, the man actually
She sank to her knees and lifted her face and hands heavenward as the Pit Crew stopped throwing balls. “WHYYYYY???!!” she cried.
“That’s not what the prophecy was about, and you know it,” Draco retorted. “Listen, Goyle, thanks for the talk, but I really should be going. I’ve been spending too much time in the Floo and it’s getting awfully warm now.”
“You really think so?” Draco asked, lips quirked in a smirk.
“My, my, Potter. Not paying your taxes?

Harry beamed. “You’re hired,” he said, and pulled Draco in for another kiss.
“What is home for you?” RuPaul asked.
, but he sometimes felt like she didn’t hate him as much after the war. That was something, right?
“Doesn’t seem too sad about being a ghost now,” Potter commented, shoving another sausage in his mouth. Draco wished he would stop eating those because it was uncouth and bloody unnerving.
“I’m afraid you’ve caught me at an inconvenient time,” Draco rolled one set of eyes.
Well. If it was fine with the LA Aurors Department, then it was fine with Draco. These were muggles, after all, and it wasn’t like Draco was performing
“Are you both ready to meet our fabulous celebrity panel?”
“Cindy Sanchez, Paris Davenport, and Acacia Davenport, you will advertise RuPowder, my new brand of finishing powder fit for a queen.” The trio contemplated the jar of powder on the tray.
“Well,

” Blaise explained. “Apparently, you’ve made quite the impression. They’re rather baffled.”
The Quartet of Sorceresses, as they called themselves, made for passable entertainment. Lady Cakes and Venus stood out, working the crowd and getting as many laughs as they could with their shtick in between tricks. Lorena and Kali struggled somewhat, their nerves showing. There were a few awkward pauses as they fumbled to get Lorena to appear from behind a large curtain.
“Wait,” Harry said, clinging to a faint memory. He did remember getting more than the usual number of letters on lavender-colored paper in February, but--- “Were they also lavender-scented?”
Draco said nothing and shot her a dirty look.
Carmelita almost sobbed with relief before bowing and walking back to join the other queens. Queenie Q looked like she might be sick.
“Ha! That’s high praise coming from you. Shall we go join the others? Maybe we can catch up over a firewhiskey. Or have you been going for those pretentious niffler drinks Blaise Zabini has been pushing on everybody at the bar?” Potter laughed again. “I hear he’s working for Highbridge’s these days, so we’re all getting a sales pitch tonight.”
“Oh, you know me, same old, same old,” Draco said. “Except for that little matter of getting haunted by Crabbe and finding out that you’ve known he was a ghost all this time?”
“Wait, I remember that, too,” Venus said. “Kali, you said you saw one in the hotel, didn’t you?”
Goyle only laughed. “Are you kidding me? You know I was never that good at magic. Besides, that sounds more like something

Bruce Vilanch looked confused. “You know I’m not Carson, right?”

There is a fixed number of chapters, but it’s a surprise for now lest it give away Draco’s placement in the competition.
The old man brought Malfoy up to speed on the issue over another round of tea. Harry tried to concentrate more on his cuppa than on the familiar blond nemesis, who was trying to hide a smirk behind his own cuppa.
I welcome any comments and/or kudos!

, and I know that’s where you want to be,” she lip synced. “There must be a glitch in the matrix!”
Draco looked around to see what had set him off. Sitting on the desk chair next to the window was a large barn owl.
Goldie and Lorena were both safe, leaving Steve, Kali, and Ivana as the bottom three. They each faced RuPaul nervously.
“What– what the fuck?!” Steve yelled.
“I hear things,” Professor Burbage answered cryptically. She grinned. “You don’t remember that it happened right outside my office, do you?”
“All right,” RuPaul continued. Let’s move on to the next question. This one is for Jason: The big bad wolf is a drag queen. Instead of huffing and puffing, she
“Right. And just one drag queen,” Kali said.
RuPaul chuckled. “Let’s talk about your stand-up routine. How are you coming along?”
“Yay! Is it time for cake?”
In this episode: It’s time for the reading challenge! Next, the queens will have to try their hands at stand-up comedy. Draco reconnects with his Slytherin heritage and learns about the muggle magic of microphones.
“Carmelita,” Venus chose.
Goyle snorted. Draco shot him a quelling look. Well. Maybe if Potter could pretend that Draco hasn’t just made an arse of himself, Draco could pretend, too.
“I’m not really out to my family,” Goldie confessed. A few queens murmured their concern. “I mean, they know I’m gay, but they don’t know I do drag. I guess I’m gonna have to tell them before they see it on TV.” She sighed.

“Thank you, Salmon Buffet!” Venus loudly exclaimed as she painted her face with bright purple glitter.
“Hello Ru!”
Paris and Goldie took the lead in brainstorming ideas for their magic act.
“Okay, don’t take this personally,” Venus began diplomatically, “But just based on the critiques, I think it’s gonna be Kali, and either Intoxia or Lorena.”

“Hello, hello, hello!” RuPaul chimed, stepping into the workroom dressed in a blue leather motorcycle jacket with silver stars and matching cap and pants, and a red-and-white striped T-shirt.
“Well, just keep in mind that we’re expecting to see something couture,” he replied. “You wouldn’t be here if you weren’t a fierce queen. I’ll leave you to it.” And with that, RuPaul walked over to Venus Flygirl and began asking him questions about the fabric on his dress form.

“I don’t know.” Paris fidgeted with the wig in his hands.
Intoxia Madison peered over his shoulder. “Draco, what did you get?” Draco showed him the practically empty box. “That’s it??
The years since Hogwarts had left their mark on Goyle: his body had lost most of its muscular definition and gained more roundness from long hours of sitting, and his face had gained some wrinkles, but his overall demeanour radiated a comfortability with himself that he had never had in his youth.

Lady Cakes, Goldie, Steve, Venus, Kali, Paris, Acacia, Lorena, and Intoxia all stood in the hallway, grinning.

comics. Karen had always fascinated him because she worked in something called “Finance” and kept a tiny dog in a purse. But he knew he couldn’t explain that away on muggle television.
Kali shook his head. “I can entertain a crowd for maybe a minute at a time between sets at a drag show, but this is a whole ‘nother thing. I’ve never just talked and talked on stage like that before. How about you?”
Draco extended both arms in front and clasped hands, then gracefully stepped forward down the runway in a makeshift tango. With his face split down the middle between male on the left and drag makeup on the right, it looked almost like two people dancing together whose bodies had merged halfway.
Meanwhile, in the Untucked lounge, Draco glumly sipped her cocktail and mulled over her limited options. It seemed clear that she would be lip syncing that week, based on the judges’ critiques. The others seemed to agree as they debated who would be in the bottom two, undecided between Steve and Acacia.
—Confessional—
Draco was given a bunch of grapes. “Ooh, pucker those lips!” RuPaul told her. “Those must be some sour grapes! Werrrrrk!”
Draco made a choked sound in the back of his throat.
“I’m afraid I can’t tell you how to file the taxes,” he continued with an apologetic smile. “I usually send that information off to my accountant.”
“On your back,” Draco purred. “Just relax, love.”
“Best scarper,” said Draco to Harry. “I was planning on having a nice fag and slinking home, not refereeing a duel to the death, tonight.”
“Please,” said Draco, “do serve me firewhisky and continue to expound on how you are wrong and I am right. You’ve begun the journey back into my good graces.”
“I mean that affectionately,” Ginny carried on as if Harry hadn’t spoken, “but when it comes to this sort of thing, you and Draco are both morons. I was witness to six of your seven years of inept pigtail-pulling, so I know a thing or two about this. Collectively, you have the emotional intelligence of a rhinoceros with sunstroke. I’m not saying this to discourage you, of course. I just...you two can’t do things the normal way. So don’t try.”
A little smirk surfaced. “Yes, Draco, I’m sure. I’m just having a really good time with you. Promise.”
(See the end of the chapter for
As it happened, Harry was enormously rich. It took several times going through his account statements and having Wizarding money explained to him for this fact to sink in, but eventually it
“I’m right here,” Molly pointed out with an exasperated huff.
“It’s a favorite of Molly’s,” said Arthur. “Who are your guests?”
“Amy,” he said in amazement, looking up from the parchment in his hands, “this money could get us both through uni. Easily.”
“They’ve frozen our accounts, Draco, do keep up.”
“I can’t,” said Harry. “I’ve got work. I already said.”
“Cousin,” Draco interjected sharply, “Perhaps we ought to catch up before we begin scheduling play-dates.”
“I never wanted to stand out,” said Harry. The conversation was making him increasingly uncomfortable. He took a gulp of martini, trying to focus on the burn of it in his throat. But Draco’s poncy vodka was so smooth it wasn’t much distraction. Bastard.
“I’ll pay it,” said the blond with a shrug. “Money is no object for me. You shouldn’t have to suffer when your time could be spent so pleasantly.”
Hermione coughed to hide a snigger.
Sirius and the other young man were still on the other side of the room, fighting the Facadio charm. Arthur raised his voice and recited the rhyme that was required to end it.
“Oh!” Draco grinned. “Well, that’s the particularly clever bit. The failsafe, should the Dark Lord turn on us, is that we really can run into the arms of the Order of the Phoenix and no one will be the wiser as to our duplicity. And in the reverse, should the old bat grow suspicious, we can high-tail it back to Voldy’s side. So either way, there’s a failsafe. Two failsafes, yes?”
Harry put a hand on the small of her back, a gesture of comfort. He knew that comments like that were just Amy’s way of coping with stress.
“In front of all the

Conversation over dinner was stilted, but a few glasses of wine and Harry’s excellent cooking eventually relaxed them all enough for a proper conversation. Once the plates were cleared and the kettle was on, Hermione addressed the elephant in the room.
The items of clutter on the various surfaces levitated and began to orbit each other like in
“The Dark Lord, as his--as some called him, wanted only certain wizards to be in charge, the elite if you will. People like my family, whose families have been all wizards for generations. See, some wizards and witches are born to Muggle parents--but I needn’t get into all that now. Suffice it to say that the Dark Lord was prejudiced and cruel, sort of like your Hitler.”
Ron, and with him innumerable Weasleys.
“You know,” said Draco consideringly, swirling his half-empty glass, “I don’t think I’ve ever met anybody else who actively
“Dad.”
Ginny never needed it explained. As much as he wallowed in earth, she spat fire. Soon, all that was left of them was smoke.
“Pettigrew,” Draco greeted him. “What a surprise.”
“Don’t be absurd, Scorpius,” said his father, “such a relation would be no impediment. Purebloods, after all, are no strangers to incest.”
“James?” he whispered.
“But how did she find you?” Sirius wondered. “You were hiding in the Muggle world, yeah? I can’t imagine she’d blend in much there.”
“This is some trip,” Amy muttered, and, clutching tighter to her cat, she squeezed her eyes shut and stepped through. When she opened her eyes, she gasped just as Harry had.

“Draco’s...kind of like that too.”
Harry was halfway back to his apartment when he realized that Draco

“I simply wanted to chat,” he said, “so I Summoned you.”
“And Draco was actually pretty good about it, I mean he didn’t know Vernon but he read the room and he tried to stand between us. It was decent of him. And then the restaurant guy, what’s it called, like the host but for a posh fucking restaurant--”
“Apparently not,” said Draco.
“Ah,” said Draco. “And the hobby-horse he had with him?”
“Sorry?”
“I already made the appointment,” Harry said stubbornly.
“She sounds great.” But Harry wasn’t sure what he meant by that, when actually he was horrified at the idea of conjuring a cupboard that shouted at you to do your chores. He didn’t particularly like the sound of his paternal grandmother, in fact. But judging by the soft look Sirius gave him, Harry’s instinct toward politeness had been a good one.
“I wasn’t aware--”
“The two of you can’t marry, you realize,” said Scorpius, taking his drink in hand. “I’ll not take the fall for marrying my step-brother.”
“Oy,” barked Ginny in his ear, “do I look like a table to you?”
As soon as he was there, he buzzed and buzzed, muttering to himself, “Please be home, you smarmy bint, be home, please…” So immersed was he in his muttering that he nearly fell over from surprise when the building’s door opened.
“And I’m a Slytherin, my boy. I know when someone is burying the lead. Who is it?”
“Sorry?”
“I’m a loose cannon,” he muttered, earning a disapproving look from the dignified elderly waiter who was at that moment bringing his food. He merely nodded to his empty glass and dug in.
“I can’t believe this,” said Seamus.

“He was in hiding in his animagus form,” the Dark Lord explained.

“Do try sipping,” said Draco as he poured. “It’s the latest thing.”
, and he’s incredible. But I’m still his godfather. Do I need to tell you how many ways I have to transfigure a dead body?”
“Let that be a lesson,” said Harry weakly.
“I dunno,” Harry sighed. “I just...I don’t know if I’ll live through the end of the year, I’m never sure, and I’ve been thinking about what I’ve done, and what I still want to do.”
“Ew,” said Ginny, “you really like him.”
“Yes, Potter, do try to keep up. Against my better judgment, I have agreed to your preposterous proposal.”
The kiss, though rushed, was not clumsy. They knew each other too well for that. Instead, it was warm, soft-but-firm, and it was sweet and safe-but-hot, and it was all the things they were to each other. It was
“Sorry,” said Draco, stepping into the room, “but it’s bloody

, and honestly just relieved to have someone to talk to. The conversation had been stilted, but there was a new undercurrent of understanding between them. Being a gay wizard was awful even without fame or postwar trauma. Neither of them knew anyone else in circumstances as close to his own.
RGW: shit
“No I wouldn’t,” Harry agreed. “But then--then he started asking me these questions--” Harry was cut off by the sound of the buzzer.
“Oh no, I--” cutting himself off, Sirius stared at Harry for a moment. “They didn’t tell you
. And until the war ended, that was how I lived. You bloody well don’t know how that feels.”
Harry turned to Amy to share the moment, but she only looked puzzled.
“May I speak with you?”
“There’s your answer, then.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Albus grumbled.
“You solicited me for prostitution!”
“Look,” said Harry, “I get it. I don’t expect anyone to just forgive him overnight. Some days I’m not really sure even I have. I just...I hoped...I dunno. I sound pathetic.”
“Why don’t you start at the beginning?”
The two shared an awful grin.
So Draco took a step toward Potter, leaning down just enough to telegraph his intent without invading Potter’s personal space.
“Sorry?”
“Beatrice is well,” said Arthur softly, with understanding.
“My what?” said Harry sharply. He remembered the first broom Petunia had given him. He’d been six years old, and hadn’t eaten until he’d learned to use it. He’d told this to Amy one grim vodka night, so she understood enough to look at him sympathetically.
“This is a business matter, I’m afraid to say, not a social call. I was not perhaps very straightforward on that matter.”
Draco looked askance at Harry. If he himself were in Harry’s position, he knew he’d have clung to any excuse to be near Tom, even if it were just to lurk on his balcony. Not that Draco would ever lurk. He was far too well bred for that.

“Don’t say queer,” Harry quipped.
Malfoy.”
Harry rolled his eyes but slumped back in his chair a bit. After taking a sip, he asked, “Well, what are we having then?”
“Go then,” said Draco. He was nearly snarling. Harry put on his coat and stormed out of the pub.
“I noticed,” she said dryly. “I thought it would be faster to come down here and let you in than to wait for you to stop buzzing so I could reply. You coming in?”
“We were thirteen, and he was trying to have a

, so it’s visible to us, but for a Muggle to see a Patronus, the spell would probably have to be altered at the level of intention, if not deeper.”
Sirius smirking behind his back.
Remembering all of that now, Harry cried out, then opened his eyes in surprise. He hadn’t even realized he’d been touching his cock, but now he was so close to coming. And he was getting closer, barely touching himself as he remembered Draco’s nails digging into his thighs as he sucked him, Draco grabbing the base of his cock when he got too close, Draco fucking him into the mattress and eating him out after, waking up to Draco’s mouth on his neck…
“You don’t know me,” Draco pointed out.
HGW: What have you done now, Harry?
“James’ mum taught it to us,” said Sirius with a weak smile. “She said it was the fastest way to clean up a room. We were thrilled, till the cupboard showed up again in the middle of the night and shouted at us to put everything away properly.”
“Harry,” Hermione groaned. “You
“However,” Lucius continued, “trustworthiness has never been a trait particularly valued in this family. I am willing to give you the benefit of the doubt and believe you competent, as long as we enact a failsafe for your plan.”
“Look, mate--” Ron began threateningly, but Harry quietened him with a wave of his hand.
A nasty gleam appeared in Vernon’s eye.
Draco raised his eyebrows. “You’re here, aren’t you?”
“Of course not,” said Pansy, going to the kitchen counter where she had set down their takeout breakfast, “But
“No.” Harry caught Draco’s shoulder as he turned away. “No, I’ll come.”
Draco scowled. “Right, then. Everybody out!”
“It’s been twenty-four years,” he told her. “You used to keep me company in the bathroom?”
“I’m not going to lie; I didn’t think you had it in you,” Acacia Davenport commented. Draco raised an eyebrow.

“I suppose I should consider taking on some muggle gigs, maybe. Mariah and Dean have been pushing me to create my own video show for muggles. Have you heard of something called The Tube?”
For the purpose of this fic, we’re just going to pretend that Drag Race UK doesn’t exist and the timeline of the Harry Potter series is more recent than the ‘90s.
There was a lot that Draco still didn’t know about what Potter and his friends did during the war. He had only a vague knowledge that the Dark Lord had protected a series of artefacts. Were those actually

“Are you up for the task?” RuPaul asked. Draco nodded. “Excellent. Now, pose the house down!”
“I haven’t had a chance to properly introduce myself on set,” she said, “I’m Heather Villareal. I’m with the Los Angeles Auror Department,” she explained, giving him a warm smile. Draco noticed that she was wearing muggle jeans and a dark blue polo shirt with “LAAD” embroidered in gold above an image of two wands crossed under two palm trees.
“I suppose that will have to do,” Draco sniffed in mock disappointment.
The rest of the trip back to the hotel was uneventful. Draco crashed hard for a painfully limited amount of time before having to get up again for Elimination Day. He had never felt more grateful to have doses of hangover potion and pepper-up potion on hand as he did that morning.
“You can do what you want,” Draco told him. He threw away the towel and crossed his arms. “I don’t need you to cover for me. You’ve had your memory modified once before, and it could happen again if you tell other people about it.”
“Listen,” RuPaul said, “It has to be something that speaks to every American. It has to be really direct. I’m gonna let you get back to work, okay? Thanks, Draco.”
Both Draco and Narcissa snorted at that. Narcissa raised her eyebrows and looked as if about to speak, but Draco shook his head minutely.
“You found out about magic tonight?” Sirius clarified.
“Oh.” Harry swallowed, suddenly feeling queasy. “I don’t think I want to know about this.”
“Should I tell him to slag off?”
Punctuation!
“I’m a bit worried,” said Ron, “but we’ll let you talk.” Hermione sighed, but left with Ron. Luna kissed Ginny on the forehead before following them.
“Oh.” Draco straightened, revealing that his arms had been wrapped around the cat in question. “Appropriate name. He’s deuced heavy.”
“Out of the way, boy!” Vernon spat.
“Harry...Potter. Son of Lily Evans Potter and James Potter.”
Harry and Amy watched in astonishment from their spot behind the couch. Draco was exchanging rapidfire beams of light--spells, they supposed--with the crazy woman--his aunt?--and blasting holes in the walls all the while. It was difficult to follow a fight so different from anything they’d ever seen, but Harry had an inkling that the woman was the superior fighter. As if to prove him right, Draco sent a last, attention-grabbing spell (it caused a miniature dust storm around the woman’s face) and retreated behind the couch. Before they knew it, Harry and Amy each felt a grip on their arms, then a horrible squeezing sensation as the world went black.
“Yes,” said Mr. Chatwal, fixing him with a suspicious look. “Seems you have a good friend.”
“You’re right,” said Amy to Harry, “He’s absolutely fucking bonkers. Shouldn’t have doubted you, love.”
Harry frowned. “Difficult,” he admitted. “There’s this girl, I think she needs to be removed from her home, but her aunt--”
Venus took a moment to consider the queens lined up in a row. “I’m going to go with...Kali Sister!” Kali preened to polite applause from the others and bounced over to stand next to Venus.

“Thank you, Ms. Gucci,” RuPaul said.

“He’s still talking to Albus. He has purple hair now.”
This is why he was utterly surprised when he received a howler from the Ministry of Magic’s Department of Overdue and Unpaid Revenue (DOUR).
blonds such as yourself,” he clapped back.
“Sorry, not a match. Taylor Swift, how did you answer?” Steve-as-Taylor-Swift opened her mouth.
Draco frowned. He vaguely remembered seeing a letter from Hogwarts on the mail tray the day before, but assumed it was the list of materials Scorpius would need for school shopping. He groaned internally.
Draco blinked. “That’s really...well.” His face, ears, everything felt hot now.
The Bent Unicorn was filled with a cacophony of hisses, boos, and cries of outrage from former Slytherins. Members of the audience from all other houses — but especially Gryffindors —  laughed loudly.
Draco waved her off. Inwardly, she was relieved that these three aurors had let her off the hook so easily. And compared to Heather Villareal’s manners, they were almost downright pleasant.

“You wanna know what?” Lady Cakes asked the camera with a devious grin.
“Old age. Or maybe it was the boating accident. Bit of both, probably. There comes a time when old wizards aren’t meant to magic their way through the Bermuda Triangle in a rowboat during hurricane season, if you ask me. But he had a young fellow as an apprentice. I can’t remember his name, but he’s taken over the business since Dunlap passed away. Let me see,” Pendleton began rifling through a large stack of papers on a desk in the corner. “Ah! Here we are!”
Kali laughed. “That’s so cool! I think I know what happened.” He winked at Draco.
She nudged Harry and pointed toward the other person just as the commercial break ended. Harry looked over and nodded. Draco could always trust Harry’s Auror senses to pick up on any potential threat. There was definitely an advantage to having the Saviour of the Wizarding World as a boyfriend.
He headed back up to his bedroom, levitating the tray behind him. Inside, Harry Potter groggily opened his eyes. He fumbled to put on his glasses and grinned at the tea.

The queens’ jaws all dropped.
As they marched back to the workroom, he had an idea. Maybe it was mad, but...maybe it would work.
“Now, it’s time for the judges’ critiques. Draco, tell us about your cosplay look on the runway,” RuPaul asked.
Myrtle narrowed her eyes. “I don’t remember you,” she said.

“What did I miss?” Draco asked Goldie.
“Queenie Q, I’m sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination. Carmelita Corazon, you are safe.”
RuPaul laughed. “Courtney Act must be so proud.”
The reads aimed at Draco turned out to be a mixed bag of false kindness and shots aimed at his looks.
to schlock her own merch? This show is like one hour-long ad for her products.”
“Girl, nobody else came back looking like that!” Venus retorted.
Draco shrugged and wrote it down, though she kept in in quotes. Muggles, thinking they were magical! Draco imagined Batty Auntie Bella rolling over in her grave at the notion. Her smirk widened into a broad grin.
RuPaul approached their group as they sat on the sofa of the workroom.
“Yes, of course, thank you,” he told her. “Now, how do I find this Instant Graham?”
“Bugger,” he sighed, and rubbed at his eyes. The ceiling looked down at him unforgivingly. After a quick
“Ooh, bitch!” Goldie squealed. “Don’t look at me!”
“Draco, you’re safe.” Draco curtseyed and went to the back.
“You can no longer use Malfoy as your name in any context, in or out of drag,” she clarified.
Draco nodded and placed her hands on her hips, arching her back to the side for the beginning of

Draco thought. But that wasn’t a motive to share with the muggles.

Venus huffed in irritation. “Well, then how about playing a
“Tell me, have you made any decisions regarding the lineup?” RuPaul asked.
Kali looked up to the ceiling in resignation, a sour expression on her face.
—Confessional—
“Father!” Scorpius whined.
“I haven’t won any challenges since Week One!” Goldie lamented. “I feel like I’m giving the judges everything I can, and yet it’s still not enough, you know?”
“Well, this isn’t exactly the first time we’ve had a red carpet runway challenge on this show,” RuPaul countered.
“Well, if you can’t be relatable, you can always embrace the weirdness,” Bianca advised. “People love a weirdo. That’s how Tammie Brown still gets work.”
“Let the magic show begin!” RuPaul announced.
Draco blinked.
The queens laughed nervously.
Potter picked up the giant tube in curiosity. “That’s...unexpected.”
“Oh my goodness, the stars are telling me that y’all are gifted with the second sight!” RuPaul announced after each queen had had her turn at the phone hotline. “I just hope our mystery caller kept the receipts. Do you wanna know who she is?”
“I won the reading challenge!” Draco said excitedly. “Honestly, did you expect anything less? I was
“How would you define a cooking show?” Draco asked.
When it was her turn, Draco was directed to a corner of the workroom where a small table had been laid out with a crystal ball, a deck of tarot cards, a few decorative odds and ends, and what Draco assumed had to be the phone. She had seen phones before; they were slender rectangles. This was nothing like it at all, a lumpy pink sculpture with a tightly wound cord attached at two points. She could barely make out the profile of someone sitting behind a partition screen.
“I said I ‘
“Now,” RuPaul continued, “Each group will have ten minutes for your screen test, and because Acacia won the mini challenge, your group will have fifteen minutes. Gentlemen, start your engines – and may the best woman win!”
Draco had entered
“He sure did! Would you like a slice?”
Harry looked baffled. “Sweetie, you know I work tomorrow. How about this weekend? We’ll make a day of it.” He gave Draco a gentle kiss on his lips by way of apology.
“Good God, I’m glad that’s over,” Lady Cakes sighed and mopped his brow. “This challenge just about killed me.”
“Ms. Gucci, same question,” RuPaul said.
A few people in the audience murmured notes that sounded vaguely sympathetic. The whole story had been very public in wizarding Britain, so most people knew at least some of the details already. Rita Skeeter’s quick-quotes quill hurriedly jotted down notes for the next
“Fascinating. I tip my hat to you for keeping up with all their muggle names and brands. I know I can’t remember them all half as well as you.”
Draco Malfoy was no stranger to ghosts. Long before he had ever set foot in Hogwarts and sat next to the Bloody Baron at his first welcoming feast, he was already well familiar with his great-great-great-great-great-something Aunt Aura floating around the manor.
Other queens’ looks were a little more varied. Lorena had constructed a dress that looked like the Eiffel Tower. Venus took a risk on the Christ the Redeemer statue, genderbending the otherwise masculine look with over-the-top makeup, hair, nails, and a sequined white robe. Ivana had attempted to portray a wonder of the natural world by creating a dress inspired by the Aurora Borealis, but the execution left something to be desired. The result was a dark blue tube-shaped dress upon which she had painted swirls of green and purple, paired with an emerald green wig.
“I’m gonna be old. Like, really old.”
Harry chuckled. “Look out, Bulstrode. Hermione’s got her research face on.”
“All of you are safe,” RuPaul told them, “None of you are the worst — but none of you are the best, either. Try harder next time. Now, leave the stage.” Each of the safe queens exited in single file to the Untucked lounge.
Eventually, the unsafe queens stumbled back into the Untucked lounge and sank into the sofa with their cocktails.

“It was a total snooze,” Michelle complained. “Girl, you were flatlining out there.”
“Yes, silly!” Mariah laughed again. “Anyway, I can help you get those set up, but it will be best if you can learn to manage your own presence online. And a royalty check came in for you this morning. Dean converted it to galleons before leaving for his lunch break. He was going to send an owl this afternoon, but as long as you’re here—” She opened a drawer and pulled out two pieces of muggle paper and a bag of coins.
“All right, ladies,” Todric got their attention after another run-through. Lady Cakes was sitting on the stage, breathing hard and fanning herself with her hand. Steve looked on the verge of tears. Venus was the sole queen who still looked confident and unfettered by the practice, the others displaying a spectrum of frustration, annoyance, and exhaustion.
Blaise laughed. “Well. If he can get used to your charming personality, then the BBC should post no problems for him.”
Paris gave him the side eye.
“Intoxia Madison, Venus Flygirl, Lady Cakes McMansion, Draco, Acacia Davenport: you are all safe. You may leave the stage.”

“Here we go,” Lady Cakes sighed, and downed her cocktail.

“Why, Dr. Howser, I’m cancelling my Thursday appointment,” RuPaul replied. The judges laughed again.
“All right, and who is your second choice?”
“No idea,” he answered. He looked at Goldie thoughtfully. “If it were you, what would you do?”
“The lack of a backside?” RuPaul suggested helpfully.
“It’s great to be here, Ru.” Jason greeted.
Draco collapsed in her dressing room chair and removed her Umbridge hat and wig with a sigh. Emceeing the party in that costume had been exhausting. She was startled by a knock at the door.
Paris panicked. “Oh shit, what the hell am I gonna do? I’m just hoping to be safe this challenge!”

“So, Draco!”
“You wanna kai-kai?”
“You said it,” Kali Sister nodded. “I hope I never get that close to the bottom again!”
“Maybe we should tell them,” Paris said, then turned to the audience. “Do y’all want to know what happened?”

“Time!” RuPaul interjected. Venus dropped her jaw in surprise.
The audience at the viewing party had been laughing and making snide commentary about Kali’s attempt at a British accent. Harry and a few others with a bit more exposure to the muggle world laughed at Draco’s Mary Berry impression.

Behind the camera, Ross and Michelle dissolved into giggles.
With that, the other wizard disapparated, leaving Draco alone in the loo.
“I’m just saying that your look tonight maybe isn’t as

“Hmm, that’s not what I would have expected,” Weasley said, peering over his shoulder.

“Hey Draco,” Crabbe said, lounging halfway through the library table while Draco was trying to read the horcrux book.
“And your other daughter?”
Crabbe winked. He actually
“Thank you all,” she concluded, “You have been a superb audience. Do enjoy the rest of your evening!” With that, she sheathed the mic back into its stand and walked offstage, feeling confident about her performance.
“For you? Always.” Draco smiled as Harry leaned over, kissing the blonde gently so as not to smudge anything. “Care for some champagne before you go?”
“Maybe Neville would know an accountant who could help you?” Ron rubbed his sore arm. “He’s taken over managing things at home for his gran. You should try asking him.”
RuPaul looked around thoughtfully. “Courtney Act is a queen who can turn even a tiny bit of fabric into an outfit,” he commented. “You’re both fishy queens. Are you planning to serve us some body-oddy-oddy?”
Other queens seemed to recognize Ivana’s experience in this department, and started asking her more questions.
—Confessional—
He thought about the other queens’ strengths as comedy performers. Lady Cakes was a shoo-in, of course. Venus and Goldie had also proven themselves to be funny in the Snatch Game challenge, so they were also strong contenders for this challenge. Steve, Paris, and Lorena, on the other hand, were fishy, fashion-forward queens who had struggled to be funny. As for Kali — well, Kali hadn’t done well in either the costume challenges
“For today’s mini challenge, I’m taking you to a concert!” The queens cheered. “More specifically, the concert just ended.” The queens booed. “I want you to try to get into the special backstage VIP lounge of the hottest girl group of 1990, Seduction — featuring Michelle Visage. I wonder whatever happened to her!” The queens laughed.
With the blink of an eye, Draco was no longer Draco the Drag Queen, but Former Death Eater Draco. And regardless of losing the right to legally call himself a Malfoy, he had twenty-five years of pure Malfoy attitude packed behind his icy glare.
“But you
“Er—”
He didn’t have time to process what was happening before a highly polished pair of black shoes and pressed wool trousers stepped out of the floo. Harry looked up and wished he could go back in time and never let this scenario ever happen.
“I waited to send this until I was sure you would be alone. I’ve found a lawyer, and she and I are going to work together to fight this stupid lawsuit. Don’t come back to London — you’ve worked too hard just to give up now. Stay in the race. I love you.”
“Paris Davenport, you are safe.” Paris thanked RuPaul and went to the back of the stage.
Lorena looked like she had bit into a particularly bitter lemon, pursing her lips in resignation. That only left Draco and Goldie.
“Maybe? I don’t know,” Michelle responded. “I mean, she put herself in this position because she didn’t get along with another queen. I’m worried that that’s indicative of a bigger problem with her ability to get along well with others, and she’s going to need that ability if she wants to get very far in this competition.”
“Oh. Okay,” RuPaul blinked. “Thank you...Next, we have Jameela Jamil, from the hit TV show
“Bitch, if you gonna serve us some ballet on the runway, you need more than just flats,” Leslie admonished. “Either put on some toe shoes or wear heels! The way you standing right now, you ain’t got no ass.”
By this point, Draco’s eyes had shut tightly and she silently screamed the lyrics as the muggle singer belted them out. She hit a tightly clenched fist to her heart, her entire body trembling.
Sure, Draco was no slouch when it came to strategy, but how well did he understand how each queen would influence each other’s performances in a comedy challenge? If Draco wanted to make the most out of this opportunity, he would need to channel Shangela’s ability to play the other queens’ abilities against each other. What would Shangela do?
“Not tonight. Ron and I are on duty. We’ll be scoping the pub on the lookout for any potential sign of trouble,” he explained. “We’re taking any threat against you seriously.”
“I couldn’t find a pen, so I made myself a quill,” Draco explained.

Malfoy’s left eye twitched. He stared at Harry for several long, pointed seconds, while Harry tried not to squirm. Why was Malfoy making him feel this nervous?
This was not destined to last long, unfortunately. A production assistant came a few minutes later to take the spider off set.
“Can’t say I’m disappointed,” Myrtle spoke up. “I wouldn’t mind having a little more time to get to know you better.” She smiled coyly at Crabbe.
“Lorena Gucci, your look tonight on the runway had us going bananas, but your stand-up routine didn’t leave us gagging.” Lorena nodded solemnly.
” Lady Cakes insisted.
“Girl, for real, you slayed that lip sync,” Paris Davenport told her.
Carmelita giggled. “Do you think she’s trying to set that bear on fire with her mind?” They weren’t speaking loudly, but it was loud enough for Draco to look up and glance in their direction. Carmelita and Lorena quickly looked back down at Lorena’s sewing.
“Goldie Hanako, I’m sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.”
—Confessional—
The ride to the studio and the werkroom chatter that day was uneventful as the rest of the queens quietly recovered from the previous night’s adventures.
“Backup? Why would you need backup?”
“Tonight on the runway, I am serving a high-society witch,” Draco explained. “She was caught on her way to the annual Halloween gala at the Ministry of Magic, but there will be no burning at the stake this time! I feel strong, sexy, and powerful in this look. This is pure Draco.”
The white plastic tip of the wand lit up. Draco jumped up and down excitedly. “I did magic! I did magic!” She spun in a circle as the audience applauded.
’s prestigious list of 20 Under 20 Most Successful Wizards and Witches of Britain. And with that went all ambitions for a career in the Ministry, let alone Prime Minister.
Special guest judge Kumail Nanjiani quipped, “The English really will colonize anything, won’t they?”
“Name three Seduction songs, and maybe I can squeeze you in.”
“Everyone else has already been picked up and taken to the hotel already, so you’re our last pickup,” he explained as he opened a side door and motioned for Draco to go in and sit on one of the oddly shaped chairs.
“Who is Cedric Diggory?” The production assistant asked from behind the camera.
Draco sighed in relief. Four weeks into the show, and she was finally safe! She filed backstage to the Untucked Lounge with the other safe queens.
—At the Viewing Party—
Draco cautiously approached him and Paris hugged him gently. “Honey, I love you, but this is an intervention. I’m afraid you have an eating disorder.” Draco gave him a confused look.
she exclaimed, and pulled out her deck of cards. “Now, I’ll make these cards fly!” She held the deck between two fingers and squeezed until all but one card flew out and landed on the stage. The audience laughed.
On the ride back to the hotel, Draco reflected on the pained look on Lady Cakes’ face. It wasn’t like he’d never sprained anything before, like the other queen had thought. But every time, it only took a simple potion to heal it in a matter of minutes. He couldn’t imagine being stuck with an injury like that for days on end, let alone during a competition like
love, anyway? He hadn’t felt much attraction for anyone since he came home from Hogwarts one day and found a megalomaniacal murderer in his home. For that matter, he wasn’t sure he was going to live that much longer himself, so maybe he was destined to become Myrtle’s ghostly toilet lover in the afterlife.
Later that morning, the queens reentered the werkroom, ready for the next challenge. Draco had chosen to wear a blousy black poet’s shirt tucked into black skinny jeans and black riding boots. Intoxia said he was serving “The Dread Pirate Roberts” on the ride to the studio, though Draco hadn’t understood the reference. He walked over to his station and taped up Teddy’s picture.
—At the Viewing Party—
Draco shook her head in confusion, then walked onto the stage, careful to avoid the banana peel.
“Did that owl really just bring you
“All right, just between us squirrel friends, what do you think of Draco’s performance?" RuPaul asked the other judges.
The stage had been set up with seven podiums. Each queen took her place and nervously made last-minute adjustments before the debate began.
“Hmm,” Granger-Weasley said, poking at the tube. “Maybe the room isn’t
“Maybe,” Lady Cakes said. He looked speculatively at Draco.
He sighed again. Finally, he had seen Astoria in his dreams, and it was wasted on something as banal as groceries. Unless pumpkin juice had some kind of symbolic meaning? Maybe he should look it up in a dream interpretation manual.
Draco nodded. If the entire contraption wasn’t the microphone, then he must have meant the short, fat, wandlike stick on top. Draco pulled it out of its holder and held it like a wand, pressing the thinner end to his throat.
The next morning, the queens skipped into the workroom, singing “Top Eight, bitches!”
Harry looked at the labels at the top of each form and squinted. “Are you sure you don’t have those numbers backwards?”
Paris covered her face with her hands and squealed as the others applauded.
Then again, maybe Draco hadn’t made it to the top three for the week after all.
Goldie laughed. “Sorority sister hookers!”
“Say, are you going to the reunion next Saturday? Because I’m thinking about it.” Goyle asked.
Back in the werkroom, Draco pondered how he should assign the lineup of queens in the stand-up show. He hadn’t been fully kidding when he asked about Shangela. He remembered how she had had a strategic approach to a similar challenge on her season, combined with a cunning analysis of her competitors’ strengths and weaknesses as performers. If any queen on
“Well, thanks anyway,” he said, turning to the others. “I know you tried, Draco. But maybe this is for the best.” He flashed another grin at Myrtle. “Goyle, I know you were just trying to help me find some way to pass the time, but you can keep your muggle books.”
This was followed my more laughter and catcalls.
“I’ve been pretty lucky," Ivana replied. “My dad and sisters know I do drag, and they’ve been okay with it. They’d still rather I did something more lucrative with my life, but they don’t, like, throw Bibles at me every time I see them. I’m taking that as a win.”
—Confessional—
They finished walking along the Walk of Fame, which failed to impress Draco (why would anyone feel honored to have people put their dirty feet all over one’s name?). But he’d had enough tequila by that point that the idea only made him laugh.
A chuckle echoed across the tiles from behind him. Draco swiftly spun around and caught Potter smiling at him. Memories of their last encounter in this bathroom unnervingly flitted through his head. He couldn’t reconcile the angry sixteen-year-old Potter with the one standing in front of him at this moment. This one was a handsome silver fox and radiating ten times the confidence that he ever had in school.
—Confessional—
“I’m afraid you’ll have to settle for the chance to win drag-related gifts or cash prizes instead,” RuPaul replied dryly.
Cindy had been one of half a dozen Leos on the runway. Too many Leos in a showboating competition was destined to cause irritation and bitterness for everyone involved.
“Oh! You’re Harry Potter!” the woman exclaimed.
Draco looked up, confused, until she saw a blonde, slender queen appear from around a door at the back of the set.
Draco frowned. Goyle hadn’t mentioned anything about being haunted by their late friend. Not that they had really spoken with each other in a while, though. How long had it been?
“Oh.”
Harry’s ears felt hot in embarrassment.
—Confessional—
“Indeed! So he didn’t have time for us, but he was practically
Malfoy continued to glare.
“That was terrible,” Lady Cakes sighed. “Can we just erase that performance from the tapes and pretend I went home sick with the flu or something?”
“Spice is nice, America! Vote for Kali Sister, and let’s go from bland to grand!” She beamed.
Draco held the slashed-looking, lower half of her face with her right hand while her left arm dangled limply. She limped down the runway, her left leg dragging behind her. The overall look resembled a possessed and broken antique doll.
“I have to confess, there is still so much I have yet to understand about American fashion trends,” Draco told the camera, “So I was a bit surprised at the idea of this red carpet challenge. I could possibly be the least judgmental person you’ll ever meet—”
“So, I’m gonna teach you a card trick,” Jones told him. “I’ll be honest with you, this is actually kind of a hard trick.”
Draco furrowed her brows. Muggles cooked all the time. Did they not use that word? Was it a British versus American term situation?
Basil pulled out a new mic and helped Paprikah tape it onto Draco. “It helps that you technically didn’t do any actual magic,” he added. “At least we don’t have to obliviate anyone and destroy the tapes.”
“Ru’s pants!” Draco huffed. “I didn’t spend twelve hours in a flying metal tube just to go home on the first episode! I am determined to survive this lip sync.”
“Sure, I will turn it out.” Lady Cakes snapped for emphasis.
“I know a place,” said Sirius. “Soon as it’s safe.”
“He’s like that,” Draco said.
“Tell me you didn’t arrange a betrothal for me,” Scorpius attempted to joke.
“Marathi,” Sirius told him, “the language of the Indian province your family comes from, Maharashtra. That was generations ago. Your grandparents mostly spoke English at home, but they also spoke some Marathi and some Hindi, as did your dad. I picked up a few phrases at their house. Stuff like, ‘behave yourself,’ and, ‘you should eat more,’ and--” he cleared his throat-- “‘welcome home.’ I can teach you what I know.”
Sadly, he was wrong.
They were at Lavender Brown’s graduation party. It was technically for all of them, but since more than half of their year had never returned to school, it wasn’t really about graduation.
He looked up at Kingsley, considered arguing. But then he sighed and said, “All right.”
“Well met, Silvertooth. These are my friends, Harry Potter and Amy…”
“Well, it wasn’t a normal murder. There are other families who died by the Dark Lord’s hand, though it was rare enough as he usually sent one of his Death Eaters to do his dirty work.”
“That explains a lot,” said Harry.
“And where is Lump?”

“Forgive me my ignorance of the folk rituals of the middle classes,” said Draco, “but the matter is urgent.”
“France,” said Draco, who was hunched over, arms wrapped around himself.
Albus huffed out a sigh of deep suffering, but he buried his face in his dad’s shoulder and hugged him.
make him feel better.
The problem was, to do so, he’d have to be in the same room with him again.
Harry sipped again, then slumped against the wall and sighed. “Fuck, Draco. I probably shouldn’t...I mean, it shouldn’t be you I tell this to, but, fuck it, you’re here. I mean I’m here.”
obsessing over right now?”
Draco was still. “Evans?”
Draco cringed, because he had a firm notion that he was supposed to do so. It wasn’t because of any genuine reaction--far from it. Just a reflex born of years spent hiding the fact that he didn’t vote.
“Nonsense. I’m still an Englishman.” Draco tapped his cigarette over the ashtray, and Tom shook his head.
“I didn’t know you two were back!” Harry said, muffled by the intensity of the hug. Ginny was a professional footballer and Luna an itinerant cryptozoologist, so they hardly ever saw each other, let alone their London friends.
Death Eater Pharmaceuticals, after all. When one pursued a project in that industry, science was bound to happen at some point.
“We Malfoys seek our own highest good, My Lord, and serving you is, as we see it, the highest good of all.” Draco just barely kept a straight face, seeing how pleased Voldemort looked. Merlin, this was too easy. “The Malfoy family has, I am sorry to say, recently run into a little snag that may affect the cause as well.” This with a sombre tone and sad face.
Harry, however. He was coming up on his second Christmas without the Weasleys, and it just didn’t seem like a good idea any more. There was only so much a bloke could give up. He’d thought he’d drawn the line at his life. Apparently there was more to lose. Either way, there was so much to lose.
