Oh, Merlin, he was going to have to have heirs! Draco shuddered, curling up on his bed as Ivy patted his hand and Quinn popped away to help wake Mother up. She was already stirring. The end of her marriage bond would've burned off most of the sleeping potion she'd been given. By the time she talked to the aurors, it should be fully out of her system.
Amal might be all right. He did have some of Dumbledore's magic on his soul but not like either Remus or Professor McGonagall. Actually, they all had some. Draco frowned, rubbing his chest as the wards tried to warn him of the magic deep inside of them.
Harry peeled one eye open, looking at his arms with so much squinting that Draco resolved to get him to an eye Healer to see if he could have his eyes fixed. Later. Much later. After they were sure that Dumbledore was properly dead.
"Down in the wardroom attempting to give you some level of privacy, Mother," Draco said. He blushed when she raised an eyebrow at him. "I really don't need to know all of that. The wards were… intrusive. Extremely intrusive. I apologize for that."
Draco stared silently. The thoughts ticking by in his head felt like a big, complicated old grandfather clock, the sort with the open face that let you see all the workings inside and a pendulum that moved with inexorable regularity.
It took a second but both Amal and Silverclaw laughed at that. It seemed to help, thankfully, because Silverclaw stopped setting sparks off as he tapped his desk. And Amal relaxed in his chair, ruffling Harry's hair fondly.
They stumbled around the corner to the straight shot towards the altar, both of them gasping for air as the weight and exhaustion dropped into ice-cold determination that felt nothing at all like Harry or like Draco.
"Then take the cloak and all of you go hide in the Come and Go room," Harry said. "You should be safe there. It'll keep you all away from him and the cloak will hide you. This should be over in like five, ten minutes. Come out after fifteen minutes or run away if we don't win. But we're not going to lose!"
"There's nothing torrid about our affair," Professor McGonagall immediately declared while tossing her head the way Lavender did when she was being especially determined and flirtatious with Ron. "That man wouldn't know romance if it bit him on the ass."
"Very brightly," Draco agreed. "You might want to stop that. The wards at Black Manor might have issues with you blowing up the library."
Six books flew across the room to hover in front of Harry. All six of them were slender little books. Harry grabbed them and started flipping through them. Draco looked at the titles and then frowned as he realized that they weren't six separate books. They were six copies of the same book, bound in different colors of leather.
"Me either," Draco whispered. "I feel her. She's sending the message to the other teams to attack the wards. I… believe she's got Remus going through the Shrieking Shack tunnel now."
He watched Grandpa Arcturus take his place at one end of the room, directly opposite Draco who stood like they were back in the Great Hall at Hogwarts, sizing each other up before a meal. The bond between then was almost visible if Harry squinted just right and turned his head to the side. He didn't need to see it to feel it, though.
"Quietly," Harry said, heart stopping with the fear of what Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall and all the others would say if they knew. "They'd send me back here if they could. It has to be done very carefully."
"It's the proper term," Draco insisted even though now laughter bubbled inside of him like champagne shaken until the cork trembled.
She popped them out of Father's bedroom and down to the ward stone in the dungeons under Malfoy Manor. The ward stone wasn't much to look at, a simple chunk of granite that had been inscribed with runes generations ago, but the magic swirling around it made up for it. The wards surged and tested Draco, probing at him for an instant before shimmering and stilling.
Truthfully, Draco should be in the master suite. He was the patriarch. He was Lord of the Manor. It was only appropriate.
"It'll be okay," Harry promised. "Draco's just worrying about everyone. He wants us all safe. You can cuddle him when we get there. He'll want that."
"Dobby sees, Master," Dobby whispered. "Dobby understands. But if Dobby must have a good uniform, a warm uniform, then Master must have good clothes and good food. A safe place to live."
"Dobby was about to, Master Harry," Dobby said as he grabbed Harry's arm, draped it over his shoulder and then proceeded to drag Harry right out of the ward room. "Master Draco is waiting. He is very worried about you, but it had not been an hour yet. Master Harry should not have gone so deep, though. First time should be much less deep communion."
"Um, maybe?" Harry said, biting his lip as he fumbled with his magic and his link to the Black Manor wards. "Grandpa Arcturus did introduce me to them as his heir, or, you know, his heir's heir. They might let me do whatever I want."
"Go to Professor McGonagall," Draco agreed. "She's Deputy Headmistress. She's got more right to give you orders than anyone else. And I know she'll find lots of things for you to do to help."
"Um." Harry bit his lip and then sighed. "All right. Let me lay this out. Dumbledore placed me with my mother's sister, Petunia Dursley and her family. They hate magic. They hate me. They've treated me worse than a house elf my entire life. I've been beaten, shouted at, starved, and worked until I passed out since I was four or so. Dumbledore knows that. I asked him to be placed somewhere else and he refused. None of the professors at Hogwarts seem to care. They certainly didn't help. Voldemort is trying to kill me. He's not dead. He's kind of a ghost? Sort of? And he possessed Professor Quirrell last year until I sort of killed him at the end of year. I need help. I need a safe place to live. I need protection against Dumbledore and his agenda. Dobby thinks that you can help. Will you?"
"Can you pop us into the ward room?" Harry asked. "Or pop us past the door. Through the wall? Is there a secret passageway? We just need a way to get in there, fast, because we've got to be in position to destroy Dumbledore before noon. There's not much time."
"Right," Draco said once they'd all settled. "Explain to me why Professor McGonagall and Mr. Lupin are free? I thought we'd agreed that they needed to stay in the cells."
"That," Harry said. He looked at Ginny who blushed and hid behind Bill fully. "Sorry, Ginny, but we're never, ever going to get married. I'm totally gay and I have a soulbond with Draco. I'm sure you'll find someone perfectly suited to you, though. You know, now that the whole world isn't all messed by Dumbledore's nonsense."
It was horrible. All Harry wanted to do was curl up in a ball and sleep until he felt better. Draco, sitting at Harry's side outside of Remus' cell, looked like he was about to fall asleep despite the rough stone wall, the hard wooden bench and Professor McGonagall cursing up a storm inside Remus' cell.
"The good news is that Silverclaw has locked down your vaults, recalled everything that was ever taken from them, ensured that Potter Keep is completely intact and ready to move in with newly updated wards that would keep a full army out," Amal said while bouncing on the bench with as much excitement as Dobby who was clapping his hands, "and he managed to keep it all secret as we went. We're pretty sure no one knows that you're not at Privet Drive."
Harry grinned and tugged Draco back down into his arms. "It's all about not giving up for both of us. So we'll sleep and in the morning, I'll be stubborn, and you'll be brilliant, and we'll ask all sorts of stupid questions because wow, we haven't learned a single useful thing at Hogwarts so we don't even know what we don't know. And the grownups will be flummoxed and argue a lot and then the two of us will try something and set everyone on their ears."
What was there to say to that? Draco nodded and let himself relax. The tiredness he felt was far more normal now than it had been before. Hopefully, their bond would sort itself out as they slept. If not, well, that was a problem for tomorrow.
"Different library, too." Harry hummed, arms tightening around Draco's waist. "Remus, let's go downstairs. I'll talk you through what I did. You can try it, see if it works, and then we'll go to Malfoy Manor."
"Who said anything about submitting?" Harry asked. "Or giving up? I said accept. You are a werewolf. You're also a wizard. Your wolf needs to accept the wizard side of you. The wizard side needs to accept the wolf. There's no giving in there. Accept and agree to work together is not at all the same thing as submit to. Besides, both sides of you will get something out of it if you do it. You'll be free from Dumbledore's control. You'll have family again. Heck, Grandpa Arcturus is pretty sure he can get Sirius free. You'll get Sirius back, too, but only if you can get rid of that blessing messing you up."
"Okay," Harry finally said after he'd walked the perimeter of the room twice clockwise, fingers trailing against the dark stone walls and then once counter-clockwise because he was still too nervous to approach the stone.
"It was centered in your forehead," Draco said. "I think in your scar. It felt… It felt exactly like the soul anchor my Father had in his library, just quiet instead of alive and vicious and attacking. It felt like the Dark Lord. There's something very wrong with that scar, Potter."
"Ivy does not know, Master," Ivy said. She climbed up on the bed and sighed. "None of us is knowing. Not even Dobby."
"Already sent Mistress Kitty through," Professor McGonagall's elf Lilac said as she popped in. "Yous is all to hurry! Bad Dumbles is very mad. Very, very mad. He is using Fawkes even though Fawkes does not wishes to attack this place."
Draco pursed his lips, staring at Ivy who nodded like she wasn't cheating to get Draco to lie down. Sneaky damn Elf. She always did this. Even Mother wasn't as good at making Draco behave. Probably because Mother had been so badly hurt and controlled by Father, but still.
Draco chuckled as he plopped onto the armchair closest to Harry. "They are pewter and no, you won't get lead poisoning from them. They're charmed. That's part of what the carving does. See the little circles around the snakes? Those are rune circles. My great-grandmother had them made back when she wanted to insult some pushy guests who wouldn't go home after a three-month visit. The sheer insult of them sent them home in the middle of a winter storm."
"Well, supposedly I'm destined to destroy Voldemort or something," Harry said. He grimaced at the horrified looks Amal and Grandpa Arcturus gave him. "I don't know if I believe that. Dumbledore wouldn't say much. It was…" he waved his hands while making a face, "all implication and my dear boy this and enjoy your childhood that, even though he was sending me right back to Privet Drive."
Not in a way that said he controlled it, no, but definitely in a way that suggested he might yet be able to wrest control from Father.
"That's not true at all," Harry said. He rolled his eyes when Remus shook his head again. "Seriously, Dumbledore is lying to you. Voldemort's shade has been captured by the Department of Mysteries. The Goblins are working with them to find all his soul anchors. I've been purged of all the dark magic left behind, by Dumbledore mind you, when Voldemort tried to kill me. It's fine."
"Hopefully," Draco murmured. "I still don't believe that Dumbledore's unaware of this thing. We'll use the cloak, as we planned."
The way she stared at Harry, all stary-eyed worship, made Draco bristle. And then Hermione and Ron bristled, which got the twin's glowering before Harry threw his hands up and slapped the wards around everyone. Including Draco.
A simple Alohamora wasn't going to do it. Draco tried it, of course. No reason not to but he had no expectation that it would work, and he wasn't disappointed when it didn't. Harry bit his bottom lip, all but vibrating next to Draco. Thank Merlin for the cloak. It was probably the only thing keeping the two of them alive.
"Always," Harry agreed. "I… don't know enough here. If it's not a charm or curse or a standard spell or a potion, what other sorts of spells are there out there?"
"Master?" Ivy popped over to pat Draco's shoulder. "Is Master Draco all right? You looks like you sees something."
"Shut it, Malfoy," Harry huffed at him, amused despite the stern tone. He'd been thinking the exact same thing.
"Potter, if you decide to go haring off to save the world again, I'm going to be very annoyed with you," Draco snapped at him. "We've more than done our part. Let someone else, an adult this time, save the world. We're going to go to school, figure out how to make babies together, and do nothing whatsoever dangerous ever again besides Quidditch matches. At which, I will absolutely slaughter you, thank you very much."
Harry started and stared at the window. Another shudder, more violent this time. Draco woke with a gasp, clutching his chest. Through the bond, Harry could feel the wards screaming that they were under attack.
Once, when Draco was very small and not yet out of a child's dresses, Mother had done an old magical prayer with him. She'd lit a candle and helped Draco pray to Lady Magic, holding his chubby little hands together as he sat in her lap, both their skirts spread around them. The candle flame, ordinary yellow, had changed to a rainbow flame.
He did look better than before. Less hesitant and afraid. Hopefully, the ritual had freed Neville, even if it hadn't done a thing for Hermione, Ron and Ginny. Draco settled into one of the chairs to listen as Harry did his best, along with Amal and Grandfather Arcturus, to answer the twins many questions.
Draco contented himself with two steps at a time, but he didn't go much slower than Harry did. Once on the battlements, it was easier to see that there were a host of redheads in the Ford Anglia. It must have expansion spells on the inside because Draco thought he saw seven redheads and a bush of brown hair that had to be Hermione.
Harry settled into the magic of the wards, of the stone, of the entire Potter family, really. Draco had made it very, very clear that wards built on the family magic as much as they did on the runes. His dad and grandparents and great-grands and all kinds of relatives that he'd never even learned the names of had fed magic into this stone. For generations and generations and generations.
Harry laughed and waved for Grandpa Arcturus to do the scanning. He certainly knew way more than Harry did. At least they'd freed one more person. They were getting kind of good at this. Food, safety and then, hopefully, he and Draco could figure out a way to save everyone else because one by one was going to take way too long.
Which was good because Lord Black had collapsed, pale as the ghost he was about to become, as soon as he came through the floo.
Fangtooth snorted. "Go sit down, Heir Potter-Black. He is alive and that, in itself, is a miracle. The man is too stubborn to die, or he would've been dead before Yule last year."
Right down to his tiny combat booted toes, Dobby trusted Harry. If his beloved Master Harry Potter, best and greatest master ever known, did not wish to tell Dobby something, well then, Dobby didn't need to know it. Harry got the feeling that Dobby was going to do his level best to not even look at their bond tonight so if anything went wrong Harry was going to have to really haul on it to get Dobby's attention.
Moody nodded as he waved about five or six of the aurors waiting outside of the grey parlor to follow him. He supported Draco all the way up the stairs and to Father's office. Even with the wards fully active and the door shut, Draco could feel the evil black magic seeping out. As soon as they got close, Moody cursed under his breath, flicking his wand out of a hidden wand holster on his wrist.
Ivy sighed as she put the books away and then charmed the credenza so that neither of them could open it. Without effort. Draco could open it if he really wanted to. And Harry was creative and stubborn enough that he'd probably find a way to open if he were inspired to. But the thought definitely counted with something like that.
"I, ah, never got one," Harry said, blinking at him. He turned to Dobby who slowly shook his head. "You didn't steal any bank correspondence, did you?"
"Of course not," Professor McGonagall said. She rolled her eyes which Harry stared at. Seriously, he was not used to the idea of Professor McGonagall acting like Lavender Brown. "Croaker. Not a drop of romance in that man's soul. Damn good thing, too, or I wouldn't have put up with him all these years."
The truly amazing thing about Harry bloody Potter was that he flatly would not stop trying. He would not give up. He would not, under any circumstances, consider that something might be impossible.
Remus winced and rubbed the back of his neck. "Ah, well, my Wolf thinks that they need to have their throats torn out."
"No, you next," Draco snapped at him. "You're not part of the matrix as belonging here. Go! Harry, go with him."
He wasn't alone now. He had an ally. Better than an ally. He had Dobby on his side and that, hopefully, should make all the difference as the summer and the next year went on.
"Books written by people loyal to Dumbledore don't necessarily give an objective view, Potter," Draco drawled. "Something I would have hoped that you understood."
"Yes," Draco murmured, putting all his hope and acceptance and resignation to that into the bond between them. "If that's what has to happen to save Potter, then I'm fine with it."
Professor McGonagall grinned at Lilac. "I promise. Now off with you. The night's fleeing as we stand here jabbering."
He almost thought that she could do it. Ginny was ferocious, rather like Charlie who looked as though he wanted to join in the battle. Thankfully, Charlie and Bill had been caught in the same ward circle, while the twins were with Percy who'd firmly collared both of them to keep them from doing anything stupid.
"Yeah, that's what I thought," Harry said. He grimaced and pouted down at the loch. "I mean, I like Ron. He was nagging his mother to come and save me when Amal and I went to the bank the first time. She wasn't listening, really, but then she doesn't seem to listen to anyone any more than Hermione does."
"Is Headmaster," Tippy said sadly. "We is not liking him, not trusting him, but we is not able to hurt him."
"And a place where we can talk to Narcissa while keeping Lucius away," Harry continued, thinking about it. "The Goblins were going to work on Black Manor, right? That's where Narcissa expects you to be. If the Goblins fix it up, repair the wards, you can keep control of Lucius, right?"
Instead Harry focused and Dobby laughed and the bond between them grew strand by strand. There was fear and pain and loss. Both of them felt it. Both of them had endured it.
"It's not hard," Harry said. "Seriously, you just kind of… focus inwards on the way your magic moves through you. Like when you're learning a new spell and you need to feel the way the magic flows through you? That sort of thing. But instead of aiming at learning something you're just feeling the way the magic moves in you. For me, it's kind of like a river that flows."
There was a bond. He and Harry were already bound together, soul to soul. Draco licked his lips as he rolled onto his back.
"Healer Smethwyck wasn't wrong about adjusting the wards a bit," Draco murmured as he touched the stone and watched the many, many spell circles embossed on the wall, ceiling, and floor of the chamber light up.
He offered Dobby a fist that Dobby enthusiastically bumped before popping back out. To Draco's surprise, Mother and Grandfather Arcturus both looked as if they thought it was a stupid idea. Even Amal looked horribly discouraged.
Harry nodded. "Sounds about right to me. Though I'd love to see them thrown in jail. And Dudley to be raised by someone completely different. I mean, he got smacked around, too, though not as much as I did."
Arcturus shook his head slightly and then looked more closely at Harry. "How in the world did you get one of the Malfoy elves, young man?"
Flying in a tunnel was the exact opposite of flying normally. The walls felt horrifyingly close. Harry's heart pounded in terror of twitching the broom the wrong way and smashing himself into the walls. The ceiling loomed. The floor threatened.
Silverclaw stiffened, the corners of his mouth turning down as he frowned at both Harry and Dobby. When he turned to Amal, Amal sighed and rubbed the back of his neck. He offered the file full of notes to Silverclaw who took it with the very tips of his claws as if he didn't want to sully his fingertips with ordinary magi paperwork.
Grandpa Arcturus' eyebrows went up as he considered the question, hands draped over his knees as he leaned forward to study Draco and Harry.
From the way Silverclaw wiggled and then settled back against the mass of cut field stone that made the fireplace, it was more than acceptable. Draco stared at him for a moment and then shrugged infinitesimally. If he was happy, so be it. Harry could be more forceful about it if he chose. Mother settled in the burgundy velvet armchair closest to Draco. Amal flung himself onto the brown couch and waved for Remus to sit next to him. Grandfather Arcturus and Professor McGonagall took the remaining armchairs, though amusingly, Professor McGonagall glowered until Grandfather Arcturus gave up the black leather covered one, switching to the aged gold velvet armchair.
He tossed a book back onto the closest stack. It teetered dramatically. Both Harry and Draco grabbed for it, keeping it from toppling over and setting off a book pile domino effect that would get them in trouble.
"It looks like you've got objects here that are trying to break down the wards so that people could get in," Draco said. "That's what needs to be removed. The goblins can find and remove them easily enough. Or, once you're secure, you can get the Department of Mysteries to do it. Expensive either way."
Their bond throbbed with pain for that. Harry's remembered pain. Draco's heartache that Harry had gone through it. And then Harry's heartache for everything that Draco had experienced. Draco snorted.
There were no runes at all on the stone though they were carved all over the floor, walls and ceiling of the room. Weird that the stone had no runes at all. He could feel Silverclaw's magic on the ward stone. Draco had said that his ward stone was granite, a big chunk that'd been inscribed with runes. Potter Keep had a whacking huge chunk of obsidian that had been carefully knapped until it was shaped like an oversized stone knife. It stood as tall as Harry.
Across the ballroom that'd been turned into an impromptu library, Mrs. Malfoy was deep into three books at once, studying them and taking notes with a quill that wrote without her having to hold it. Amal was next to her, scribbling away on his notes while tugging at his hair as if whatever he'd chosen was completely confusing. Grandpa Arcturus had settled onto a couch that Cooper brought in. He looked utterly content to lounge there and read forever but he wasn't exactly turning pages. Harry thought he was asleep with his eyes open.
He wrote something on a piece of paper, setting it in a box on his counter. The paper flashed away, and the goblin nodded for them to move off to the side. Amal led Harry and Dobby off to the left where a long hardwood bench stained black like it'd been coated with soot stood. He didn't sit and shook his head that Harry and Dobby shouldn't either.
The ward stone's magic released Harry entirely, letting his awareness bloom back out into the rest of his body. His stomach rumbled loudly. His knees and feet ached from standing still for too long. And wow, his head abruptly swam with exhaustion so bad that Harry would've fallen down if Dobby hadn't grabbed him and held him up.
Draco shook his head and turned to Ivy who pointed to the tallest pine tree out beyond the war wards. It was a quarter mile away but even so Draco could see the blue flame of the phoenix. She was huge, easily as tall as Draco. Her tail was a grand long one that would have made any of the peacocks back home jealous. Her flames were shades of blue mixed with icy white, but he thought he could make out a hint of purple at the tip of her extravagant tail and about her head.
Given how Father had ranted about Lord Black's refusal to recognize Draco as his heir after Sirius Black was thrown in Azkaban, Draco was astonished that Mother had managed to save anything from Lord Black. Father was always… had always been quite violent when confronted with things that he didn't like.
He rubbed his cheek against the pillowcase and bit his lip. Ivy wasn't wrong, no matter how manipulative she'd been in saying it. If Draco didn't sleep, they really would end up in a horrible row over nothing.
The wards, the normal wards sang with the wild magic Harry had raised. Draco could almost see Harry as he walked up the final straight away into the heart of the labyrinth. It was time.
Nasty, magic twisting inside of it like a slime eel caught in the base of a bucket, the Dark Mark was aware.
"Nope," Harry agreed. "I know pretty much nothing about magic. Dumbledore did his best to make sure I didn't learn anything last year and my relatives would beat me if anything "freakish" happened before that. We couldn't even read fairy tales when we were kids."
Well, Father would do that. Anything that took away from what he thought Draco should be had to be eliminated. Honestly, Dumbledore probably did something, too.
Despite his eyes being closed, light sparkled all around him. He was suspended on a sea of stars that shimmered and popped around him. Harry smiled as a plume of stars drifted away from his lips as he breathed out. It was like his breath had become the smoke and rising embers from a bonfire.
Oh wow. It was a blessing, but one put with a snarl and hate and nothing but meanness behind it. Harry frowned and cupped the warped blessing inside of him. How sad. It wanted to do the right thing, but it couldn't. It wasn't allowed to.
Harry sat on the floor in the middle of Dudley's second bedroom, because it always had been and always would be Dudley's bedroom as far as everyone else was concerned. He crossed his arms over his chest.
He stopped talking abruptly, shutting his eyes, and tilting his head back as he struggled to breathe. Even from yards away, Harry could see the pulse pounding at Remus' throat. Which, wow, meant that he was having one heck of a panic attack about all of this.
Mr. Swashlin hummed, nodding thoughtfully while taking a refill of his tea from Dobby who brought their plates to the table. Dobby popped away with the plates for everyone else. Draco would have to check that Mother ate properly later. After all her healing, she definitely needed to eat well.
Harry blushed. When he peeked at Grandpa Arcturus, his cheeks above his silver-streaked beard were red, too. That set Harry to giggling. After a moment, Grandpa Arcturus shook his head and laughed as well.
Dobby nodded. His eyes were still dark, dark green with lemon and celadon lightning bolts through them. Odd that the colors were that instead of the red of the magic that bound them together. Harry reached out and touched Dobby's chest. The bond throbbed between them, especially after Dobby put his hands over Harry's.
Harry pushed the latest stack of books away, thumping on hand on the oak tabletop as Grandfather Arcturus rested a hand on Harry's shoulder.
Not always though. Like with stealing Dobby, sometimes his temper flared up in weird ways. The longer he was away from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, the more obvious it was that his "inexplicable temper tantrums" were actually responses to the abuse he'd gotten.
Thus Draco had the Green suite and Harry the Blue, both of them connected by a door between the sitting rooms. Father used to put guests he didn't like in these suites. They were smaller, stuffed with armchairs and heavy antique furniture that made the rooms feel oppressively crowded. The carpets, while still lovely, weren't as pristine as if they'd never been touched.
Harry plopped down on the floor right there by the floo's green flames. Not in front of it. He didn't want Draco and Mrs. Malfoy to trip over him when they came through. That'd be painful. Off to the right where Silverclaw had sat when they'd sent messages back and forth to Gringotts was good enough.
He flicked his wand out of his wrist holster, grinning when Draco eyed his arm to try and see what sort of holster it was. Moody helped Draco off to the side and then made sure that he stayed vertical as the Unspeakables moved in to trap the Dark Lord's shade and box up the artifacts.
"Well, unless you count the twins," Harry said. "They're kind of… a lot. I mean, even more than what you see in public. In Gryffindor Tower they're, um. Yeah. Not so good. Especially to Ron and Percy."
"Dobby was told," Dobby whispered. He bit his lip. "He was told to keep the Great Harry Potter safe. Master laughed when he ordered Dobby, laughed and laughed, but still. Dobby was told to keep the Great Harry Potter safe."
"Only here," Draco said. He shrugged when Harry stared at him, aghast. "Unless you lower the war wards entirely, which would be idiotic, they'll have to hover here and carefully get out onto the balcony. I don't know what to do about the car, though."
"You bet," Harry said. "It fit me, Ron and Hermione under here last year. The two of us should be just fine."
"The secrecy of making the attempt is important," Harry said as he ran on wobbly legs and got the thin little prayer books. "We can take these with us. Dobby, can you pack up everything we'll need? And are you sure he'll follow us, Draco? I mean, we could summon the Goblins, couldn't we?"
Harry heard Amal and Grandpa Arcturus arguing tiredly. Professor McGonagall called for more tea. At least it looked like they were all in there. If they were prowling around the Manor, sneaking out would be much, much harder.
"Oh, Lily was perfectly polite most of the time," Amal said with a sad smile that faded into a worried frown. "Not when she was furious. She'd go up like a grenade and then she'd go cold. You had to watch out once she went cold. And, well, Dumbledore made them swear an oath not to share that prophecy with anyone before he gave it to them. From what they were able to tell me, you or Neville Longbottom were destined to destroy You-Know-Who. That's why they had to hide, so that You-Know-Who couldn't get at them."
Harry spent the whole time being ritually purified with spells and special water and mist and things giggling over Draco's gobsmacked expression. Off on the other side of the room, Draco kept spluttering about it more, from what Harry could feel through the bond, because it was making Harry laugh than anything else.
The sheer idea of accepting seemed to be impossible to Remus, at least until Harry started in on what Remus and his wolf would gain. That made Remus' breath catch, and his eyes go wide. As soon as Harry mentioned Sirius, Remus' eyes flared bright gold.
"I just…" Remus sighed and shook his head. "I don't want to risk anything while loose. I'll try it down in one of the cells. It's… too dangerous. It might affect my lycanthropy."
The goblins directed the billowing miasma of the anchor away from Harry down into a chunk of crystal that sucked it in as it went from clear to smoky-black. The crystal rocked in place as the goblins' chant shifted to a single note held longer than human lungs could sustain.
"Right, that's another thing we'll need to investigate," Harry said. "Not the most important thing, but it does need to be investigated. Maybe with the aurors? Anyway. No, the other thing I need is to somehow contact Arcturus Black. He's, what? Close to two hundred or something? If magi live that long, and he's dying, he must be, right?"
He dimly heard Dobby grumbling all the way up to the Great Hall, but most of his attention was on the throbbing in his hands and how utterly exhausted he was. The world narrowed down to a long, echoing tunnel along which Dobby's voice carried.
Harry blinked a dozen times, very fast, as Ivy stood back up and giggled at the two of them. "Phoenixes can be blue?"
He ended up getting kisses from Mother, a gentle hug from Grandfather Arcturus that set Draco's cheeks to flaming, and another order to go straight to Potter Keep before they would go through the floo. Draco nodded for Blue and Cooper to pop over with the books. Then he took a deep breath and touched the wards around him.
"No one can really see us?" Harry asked. A twelve-year-old boy shouldn't be here. Dobby definitely shouldn't.
Harry kept going, kept praying to the magic that had saved him from the Dursleys, that had saved Grandpa Arcturus and Amal, that had given him a home in Potter Keep.
"I will never give up that bond," Draco said. "He's mine and I'm his and that's all there is to that!"
They took a breath in unison, put their right feet out in unison, and then stepped down onto the line as one.
"The curses are more encompassing than expected," Grandfather Arcturus said, sighing. He looked as though he'd not gotten a single bit of sleep overnight or all day. "They can't stay there, or their hearts start skipping beats."
They headed down into the dungeons, and yes, Malfoy Manor had dungeons, not a basement. Draco snickered all the way, swinging their joined hands while joy sang through their bond.
He had to hold on just a little longer and then he could sleep for a week and eat twice his weight in food, and call their favorite Healer from Saint Mungo's to take care of Mother's curse damage. It scratched away at Draco's awareness like a sliver under your fingernail that you couldn't quite pull out.
"Nah, it's not a suicide mission," Harry said, waving off Mrs. Malfoy's abortive reach for a hug. "It's a warning. He knows that I'm not where he wants me to be and he's decided to make it too scary for me to stay here by sending the big bad werewolf to bring me home again. Like that would work. I'm never going back to Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon's place ever, ever again."
"Oh, I want one of those," Draco said, staring at Moody's wrist and blinking so that his eyes stopped blurring and crossing on him. "That's brilliant."
Across from Harry, Mrs. Malfoy was desperately patting Draco's cheeks while two girl elves with pretty little blue dresses and kerchiefs on their heads tugged at his hands.
Remus stalked through the ballroom with Professor McGonagall, cataloging the books and generating a magical card catalog that Harry desperately wanted to read over once it was done.
"Um, well, got really nervous, then sort of talked to the stone," Harry explained slowly as he tried to sort it out in his head. "Except Dobby said that there was a lot of wild magic in the room? So maybe I talked to that. Either way, the magic kind of grabbed my mind and pulled it in to the blessing. I… I guess I encouraged the blessing to let go because I was safe, and it'd done enough, and it didn't need to keep trying to make things right despite the hate and anger and bad feelings behind it being laid."
Sorrow, fear, anger, rejection. Harry had been through so much! So much pain and misery. There was joy, certainly, especially as the goblins' chant rose and rose until it rattled the dust in the corners of the room. Smoke rose from Harry's forehead, boiling upwards as the soul anchor separated from Harry's body.
Draco made his way to the floo room, completely unsurprised when Ivy appeared with his best semi-formal robe, the open front dove-grey one with the silver-thread dragon embroidery around the collar. When Mother apparated into the floo room, she was wild-eyed but very respectably dressed in a gorgeous silver and green gown, an emerald robe and her hair pinned up with some beautiful old combs decorated with narcissus that Draco had never seen before.
Draco winced and then started when Grandfather Arcturus gently patted his shoulder. "Ah. Well, they're likely still under the control spells. We can explain how to break free. Harry and I both managed it without the ritual. It's largely a matter of allowing your magic to break the spells while in a deep magical communion."
The person who'd arrived was beyond the ward's ability to detect. Draco could feel that they were tall, probably masculine though whoever it was could also be an exceptionally tall and muscular woman. Their voice was a harsh distortion of a mid-range tenor.
The instant the door opened, Draco was there, grabbing Harry's other arm. Ivy was there, too, vibrating with nerves as she wrung her hands and stared at Harry with worry. Harry let them lead him to the bench opposite the door, so very grateful that it was there.
Dobby levitated Harry. "Is Aurors who came and fought. They is hurt, too. But only a few dead here. Maybe others elsewhere. We is leaving now? Dobby is not looking too close at that potion. Dobby is really not looking at the table."
"A lot too hard," Harry agreed. He shrugged. "They're not listening, really. And I'm not at all sure about this do it for someone else thing they're all stuck on. I did it for myself."
Harry grinned and offered a fist to Dobby who cackled before bumping it back. "I told Dobby he was to make himself uniforms. He chose my Aunt Petunia's very best guest sheets for his uniforms."
Together, they raised their heads once more and smiled into the wild, beautiful sea of stars that was Lady Magic herself.
Still, that circled back around to the blessing and how to break it on everyone else without having to go coach them one by one by one by one.
"What?" Draco squeaked just as badly as Harry had, staring at the books in horror. "Who brought those into the house?"
"No, you can't, kid," Moody said. He grinned at Draco's glare. "Open the damned doors. Croaker needs to see what's in there."
Draco frowned. "Perhaps we should go to Malfoy Manor. The wards there are set to violently reject anyone who's touched by Dumbledore's magic. Remus couldn't go, at least not until he frees himself from the blessing, but the rest of us could. It might be safer."
"Your point of view is substantially influenced by Dumbledore," Draco explained with a little shrug and a small noncommittal smile. "Your Wolf was not influenced by Dumbledore, so it probably saw things that you weren't allowed to."
Hopefully, he'd be as good at holding wards up under attack as Draco had been, though he really didn't know what they were going to do to stop Dumbledore for good now that they didn't have access to the labyrinth on Malfoy Manor's grounds.
Harry completely ignored the looks the adults exchanged as he called Dobby to transfer Remus to one of the holding cells in the basement. Dungeon? Eh, he was calling it a basement. There was racks and racks of wine, so it was a basement, unescapable cells notwithstanding.
"I didn't realize phoenix flame separated like that," Harry commented while staring at the rising blue flames.
She stilled when Draco met her eyes. And then went very red when he kept right on staring into her eyes. Eventually she sighed and let him stand on his own two feet though only for a few seconds. Draco's knees went right out from under him.
"Um, my name is Harry Potter," Harry said. "This is my Elf, Dobby. We need to talk to my parent's seneschal, Mr. Swashlin. Is he available? Did you set up an appointment, Dobby?"
The ward stone pulsed as Draco approached it. He ran his fingers gently over the surface of the stone. It felt cool, a bit distant. Perhaps that was why one only had the wards repaired by outsiders once or twice a generation. It made the wards a bit standoffish.
"Do rituals leave behind traces that people can find?" Harry asked. The sausages felt like lumps of iron in his belly.
"Master Draco is alive!" Ivy wailed, flinging herself on his stomach and clinging to him. "Ivy wasn't sure that Master Draco would live!"
Not like it wasn't there. Harry sucked in a breath as he stared into Draco's eyes, watching Draco's pupils expand out and out and out until the black of the pupil nearly consumed the blue of his irises. He could hear someone, very far away, saying something. No idea who because all Harry could see and feel and hear and taste and smell was Draco.
"I dunno," Harry said, shrugging. "I don't know how you do that fit it all together logically and strategically thing.  I guess it just means we work well together."
Harry's heart pounded as he stared at Dobby. The little creature stared right back, a mixture of sly determination and fear twisting his ugly face into a mask. It was the trembling ears that gave away the fear. Not the smirk or the narrowed eyes or even the way that Dobby held himself as if ready to leap away with the letters he'd stolen from Harry all summer long.
No, Draco's blues. It was his magic now, his legacy. His duty to purify it the way Harry was purifying himself. Harry smiled and nodded once more.
He could feel the magic rising from the Twins. It was the perfect counterpoint to the dark magic rising off the altar at the center of the room. Draco's eyes had started to glow as Harry opened the door. This had to be the heart of darkness, the center of Dumbledore's prayer circle.
Draco grinned across the top of his mug. "Well, Dobby did always have a ton of energy. Burning it all off working for Harry is probably good for both of them."
That woke Draco up. It also pulled Mrs. Malfoy and Grandpa Arcturus from the other end of the hallway, all of them frowning at Harry as he jumped up and pointed at Remus. It startled Remus enough that he held his hands up as if to ward Harry off.
"I wanted to know how many of these books were in Dumbledore's office until the Goblins called them back," Harry said.
"No," Draco said. "The problem with your so-called plan is that you're going in this like you can win a fight against Dumbledore. But you can't. He's Grindelwald, one of the deadliest wizards the world has ever known. He's in his place of power, raising a web of defenses that no one can counter. Not if you go straight at them. You'll be caught and not realize it. If you manage to resist the traps, he'll just use Hogwarts' wards to incinerate you."
Everyone at school was hurt. Hurt or doing the hurting. It kind of made a lot more sense out of Draco's behavior last year. If he'd spent his whole life being beaten up and yelled at by his dad, then his dad would be the ultimate threat. Except that no one else saw the same things so Draco had ended up sounding kind of childish.
Harry's head snapped up. He flipped pages and read that prayer with even more attention than he had been the one on making babies. Draco bit his lip as Harry read it once, then twice, and then so slowly on the third time that Draco wasn't sure if he was memorizing it or falling asleep as he read.
Draco opened his eyes to find that the two of them were glowing. Not much, not yet, but the twin's prayer was growing in power. They had so little time left, less than fifteen minutes. Damn it all, they needed to get at Dumbledore somehow!
That plus a lunch of sandwiches and crisps had all the adults calmer, if still not thinking especially clearly as far as Harry was concerned. They were all up in arms about what Dumbledore had done. In the past. You know, before now. None of them seemed able to focus on what to do to fix the mess they'd had dropped in their laps.
"You want to be free so much," Harry whispered or maybe that was Dobby. It was hard to tell with their magic mingling and surging between them.
"Most would say that he fights for the Light," Grandpa Arcturus said thoughtfully, "but I've never seen much evidence of that. Mostly, Dumbledore gathers power and control over people. People and institutions. No one since Merlin has held as much power over magi society as he has."
"That's right, we will," Harry said. "I won't let this fail. You'll do your part in the ward room and you'll be awesome at it because you're just that good at this stuff. And, you know, you saw Lady Magic already. I'll creep through the labyrinth without being seen because man, I'm really good at that."
"…You're on," Ron said after considering for a long moment. "I mean, you're an evil Malfoy git, but you're Harry's evil Malfoy git so I'll take it."
Decorated in deep blue and silver with hints of red and green, the parlor had matched sofas and chairs with thick plush velvet, a carpet that covered most of the floor in those colors that was nearly as soft as Draco's bed, and curtains that kept the majority of the light reflecting up off the loch from entering the room. Dark, comfortable, relaxing, the parlor should have been the perfect place to do it.
Odd to discover that no other house did the rituals, not even the Candle Against the Darkness one that let you pray to grow up wise and magically powerful. Draco would have thought that Professor McGonagall would teach that to her lions for sure. Possibly with an added twist to make them good students and excellent Quidditch payers.
Harry gulped and promptly started studying it intently. "We're gonna study the heck out of that one."
Harry bit his lip as he eased down the stairs with Draco at his side. The sense of dancing through Hogwarts halls was gone as utterly as mist in a strong wind. His skin prickled with nervous sweat and his mouth was as sour as one of Dumbledore's favorite lemon drops. Worse even.
"But what exactly did you do?" Draco asked. He sat next to Harry, frowning at him with nothing but worry in his eyes.
Draco frowned at Harry, astounded that he'd realized that Dumbledore wasn't trustworthy. All last year, Harry seemed to be in Dumbledore's back pocket. Whatever Dumbledore said, Harry and his idiot friends sucked up willingly.
Harry sighed and leaned on one of the battlements, putting his chin on his hands while staring glumly off towards the distant sliver of sea that they could see.
Every jaw, Draco's included, fell open. Even Dobby's. Harry seemed utterly serious though and as Draco traced the thoughts and emotions in the bond that hid behind his blandly curious face, Draco could see his point.
"Apparently so," Draco said. "I would assume that it's a message from either Gringotts or the Department of Mysteries. Phoenixes can't go through war wards without permission, but they can get in and out without disrupting them once they have it."
Harry turned back to Draco. "I need to know if I can trust Ron and Hermione. I really need to know if I can trust Mrs. and Mr. Weasley."
The other professors were equally blasé about abuse. Draco had cataloged all the students at Hogwarts who showed signs of abuse. It was over half the half-bloods and close to three quarters of the purebloods. The muggle-born, damn them for their luck, generally weren't abused. Bullied? Oh, yes, certainly that. But not by their parents. Not by the people who should love and protect them.
"Good to see you, Aquila," Professor McGonagall said. She was much more open about petting the blue phoenix. "You tell himself that I'm doing much better, you hear me? Lord Potter and Lord Malfoy have done a lovely job."
"This is such a bad idea," Harry murmured to Draco while stuffing his invisibility cloak into his pocket. "Do we even know where it comes out on the other end?"
"That was your Wolf expressing its opinion." Harry wagged a finger at Remus. "So what's he think of that? Of me and my temper and my relatives? I do actually want to know."
Cooper, Lord Black's personal elf, stood waiting for them. He was rather pale, a bit too pale, really, but he looked much better than the last time Draco had been to visit. His ears weren't sagging right down to his shoulders. His uniform was clean and properly pressed, the black tea towel fabric no longer wrinkled and worn looking.
Maybe? Maybe not. It sort of depended on how deep he was in that ritual he was creating. Which, frankly, Harry hoped he wasn't too deep into because that would mean that they were too late. And he didn't want to be too late.
Then Amal ruffled both of their hair before following Mother out of the library. Draco flopped back on the couch, heart pounding. How odd to have that sort of approval out of adults. Mother was expected. Amal and Grandfather Arcturus?
Potter Keep shimmered with magic. Quite literally. They'd summoned Silverclaw, who amusingly enough was the Potter and Black account manager as well as the Malfoy's, to check on Harry. The fussy Goblin hadn't been terribly pleased to be dragged out of his safe little vault-office, but he'd only curled a lip once and that was when Mother had tried to explain that Draco had noticed something about Harry's scar.
She glared towards the door that connected Mother's bedroom to Father's. By the time Draco had claimed all the elves from Father, it was two o'clock in the morning. It had taken half of forever to calm their magic and his down. But he hadn't fractured his core and the Malfoy magic had swirled around Draco constantly now.
The wards pooled around Draco. They truly felt aware. The link to them was so much like his link to Ivy, to the other Malfoy elves. It wasn't as deep as the one to Harry. That went right down to Draco's core. He was fairly certain that their bond had started before they were born and would extend long after they were dead.
"I'll write up the oath," Grandfather Arcturus said with a frustrated growl. "But you boys need to understand that even this might not work."
"Ah, we're twins," George said, craning his neck to look at Hermione's copy of the book until Ivy laughed and popped the purple copy in for the twins. "We can use twin-magic pretty well. Oh. Yeah, that's…"
Draco nodded once. His eyes abruptly focused, shimmering with his magic. It made Harry stand straighter and Grandpa Arcturus set his book aside so that he could focus on Draco properly.
"You're sure that you want to do this?" Grandfather Arcturus asked far too grimly. "It's two more people who know where you are. They will both learn of you, Draco, and Narcissa. They'll learn that I'm not ill and dying anymore. Every person who learns of this before we're ready to act is a risk. I know you don't want to consider it, Harry, but sometimes you have to make necessary sacrifices to ensure your safety and survival."
Weird. Maybe Silverclaw was good looking to goblins? Or maybe that one goblin was being inappropriate. Harry would have to ask Amal later if he knew what was going on with that.
Silverclaw sat up very straight, staring at Draco as if he was seeing straight through to his soul. Perhaps he was. Draco had no idea what gifts Goblins had. Father had considered them annoying vermin and Dumbledore was nearly as bad. It was the only explanation for why Dumbledore let a racist old ghost teach History of Magic.
Mr. Swashlin leaned back in his chair, eyes wide and cheeks going ashy-pale. When Dobby offered a cup of tea, Mr. Swashlin took it so absently that Harry wasn't sure that even knew that he had tea at all.
Draco recognized it. As soon as he saw that one, another appeared like a blotch of ink in the glowing night sky surrounding him. Then more, dozens, then hundreds, then thousands more.
"Grant us aid that we might save our friends, allies and even our enemy's forces from the warped blessing at their cores," Harry recited as he walked up the towering black corridor. "Grant us aid that we might save our friends, allies and even our enemy's forces from the warped blessing at their cores."
Harry answered it with a smirk and a shrug. It was such a Slytherin response that Draco shook his head, laughing into his sandwich. They ate together in silence, watching the afternoon light slide slowly across the spines of the books opposite them.
It was as if the air had been sucked out of the sitting room. Lord Black went absolutely still. Even his hands, too thin for a man in his prime, went still on the folio he'd been holding. Then his eyes opened all the way and Draco jerked Mother back a step as he realized that no, those weren't Lord Black's eyes.
Silverclaw tucked the letter away into his jacket's inside pocket. It had to be a magically enlarged pocket because the letter was easily three times the size of the pocket's opening. He sighed and pursed his lips, tapping his claws together thoughtfully.
"Polyjuice?" Draco asked. He clung to Harry, desperately afraid but not willing to show it any more than he already was.
Only one fireplace downstairs on the main floor off in one corner of the Keep, away from the living quarters and kitchen, was connected to the floo.
Draco nodded as he pulled himself back to his feet and brushed himself off. "We'll ask him once we get back to Potter Keep. Let's see if we can catch Mother and Grandfather Arcturus. They should know about this. It might be a clue to what we need to do."
Dumbledore, fake Dumbledore, Grindelwald sitting in Hogwarts where the confluence of ley lines supported the magic of the castle, roared his fury at having his blessings destroyed. Released. Completed.
They materialized in a room full of junk. Utterly and completely packed with junk that looked like it might come from every era of Hogwarts' history. It might, once, have been a grand and beautiful space. The columns supporting the huge room arched up into an arched ceiling, each rib of the fluted columns becoming a ridge of the roof. Draco stared up and up, heart in his mouth because he'd rarely seen such beautifully precise and mathematically perfect construction before.
Especially in the heart of his wards, the one thing keeping him safe from Dumbledore swooping in and carrying him off right back to the Dursleys.
"No," Bill said. He shut his eyes. "No, they haven't. Neither has Ginny and Dumble… Grindelwald had a lot of access to her. Mum let him spend whatever time he wanted with Ron and Ginny when he visited, even when they were babies."
Besides, elves saw things so differently that he might see or hear or know something that Harry didn't.
The ring stopped buzzing and flashing and poking at Harry now that it had his attention. The name wasn't Dumbledore. It wasn't even Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. Harry frowned as he turned to Draco who looked absolutely baffled.
The magic around the ward stone shimmered and then shifted as it gently wrapped around Draco. He let it happen, let the wards merge with him and his magic. Communion was a simple act, really. One opened up to magic, to Lady Magic herself, and allowed it to flow through one.
"Neither did I," Draco agreed. They didn't last long, fading away before they got more than ten feet from the phoenix, but it was very different from Fawkes.
"Help us," Draco pleaded though he wouldn't be surprised or even particularly upset if Lady Magic withdrew. "Help us do more."
As they left the lobby, Molly Weasley marched in with Percy, Ron and Ginny. She didn't seem to see Harry off by the dark corridor leading further into the bank. Ron certainly didn't. He was too busy tugging Mrs. Weasley's sleeve.
"Dobby sees!" Dobby exclaimed. "He will explain to Master Harry. Master Draco should expect Master Harry to be lecturing him for a long, long time about taking care of himself and sleeping. He is very concerned that peoples get enough sleep and eat well and are not hurting."
"Oh, leave off, Ron," Mrs. Weasley huffed as she pulled her sleeve free. "I've told you and I've told you; Headmaster Dumbledore is certain Harry's quite safe. He can't take any mail right now. It's fine. Now, if we don't hear in a couple of weeks, yes, more forceful methods will be used. But it will not be something you're involved with, young man. You leave this to the adults, you hear me?"
Grandpa Arcturus sighed. "Remus, why exactly did you come here? Especially with the intent you displayed?"
Who could he call? If he had floo powder, the floo would connect him to anyone in the Wizarding world. The Aurors? No, they'd let Father go when he should have been in prison since Draco was a baby. Professor Snape was no help. He was as much of a Death Eater as Father. Perhaps more so given that Professor Snape had taken the Mark willingly and Father, so he claimed, had not.
"The two of you are having a bi-level conversation," Mr. Swashlin said. He came in and took a cup of the special tea from Dobby with a nod of thanks. "There's the things you say and then there's the things you're communicating without saying anything."
Dobby popped in, his ridiculous uniform looking less ridiculous in the darkness of Draco's bedroom. It was actually perfect camouflage against the shadows and dim light coming from the window. If Draco hadn't watched Dobby pop in, Draco wouldn't have spotted him at a glance. Maybe not even with a longer, closer, look.
"Master Draco needs Ivy?" Ivy asked. She smiled at him, patted Harry's knee and gave Hermione a little curtsey. "What does Master Draco need?"
The place was warded as tightly as Gringotts. Maybe more tightly. The Potter ancestors who had built the place had put in some amazing wards. They glimmered in the corners of Draco's eyes.
"Eh, other than him setting off my scar and being unable to teach us anything useful, yeah," Harry said.
"You probably enjoyed being around Professor Quirrell last year," Draco complained even though he ate his hash quickly and eagerly.
It was like the moment when Draco realized that Father was going to beat him, that Mother couldn't stop it. The moment where he'd begged Dumbledore for sanctuary and realized, during Dumbledore's twinkly-eyed reptilian smile, that he would never ever get it.
"Oh," Harry said. He shook his head to try and get rid of the exhaustion-cobwebs making thinking hard. "Right. So, this thing of coming to help is out of character for her."
Draco's smile was blindingly beautiful as he blushed and then leaned into Harry's side in a cautious little invitation to a hug. Which Harry gladly gave him. They snuggled on the best couch, watching as the grown ups tossed ideas back and forth, researched from all the books in the library, and compared old songs, old prayers, old ideas that they'd learned when they were young.
That had to be a good thing. Though what they really needed was to figure out what the prayer-blessing was and how to keep Dumbledore from using it.
"Nope, we know," Harry said just as they found all the adults in the parlor looking at books. "Hey, the Wesley kids are here with Neville and Hermione. They don't know about the ritual we did."
Draco, he needed Draco. They belonged together. The wards couldn't keep Draco, not when Harry needed him. Harry wasn't going to let go of Draco.
Mother hugged Draco and then Harry, even though Harry flailed in surprise at first. She had tears in her eyes as she took her post next to Amal. Blue popped in and held Mother's hand. Just like Amal, the sheer determination and seriousness of Blue's face was a surprise.
"As you wish," Grandpa Arcturus said. "Cooper! Prepare a cell for Professor McGonagall. She'll be staying the night."
"You go to bed very early," Draco said as he let Harry drag him to his feet. "Your bed. I'm going to put on my pajamas. I'll be right there."
"Silverclaw needed a little of my blood to fix the wards here," Harry murmured while resting his index finger on the edge. He could feel the sharpness of it. A tiny push and his skin would part, blood would flow. "I need blood for this?"
"I think Dumbledore is sacrificing Remus," Harry explained with such fury and disgust that Draco found himself offended, too. "He threw Remus at the wards with every expectation that Remus would be driven to go straight through the wards. I can't help but think that Dumbledore was testing to see if the wards would kill Remus right out. He's a pawn being sacrificed like in a game of chess. I hate that. I won't let Dumbledore sacrifice him. He was my parents' friend."
Breathing slowly and deliberately didn't slow the worries rampaging through Draco's mind. There were so many things that could go wrong. Harry could be horribly hurt. He could die. The Goblins might betray him. Dumbledore might attack Potter Keep. Worse, the Dark Lord could escape the Ministry and come after them both.
"But I'm just checking the wards," Harry protested as he tapped the violently buzzing ring that really, really wanted his attention. "I'm not doing anything. I mean, personally. Am I?"
Harry wagged a finger at Draco, nodding. "Yeah, she could. She really could even though I don't trust her all the way. I don't want to get her in trouble, but she is the perfect choice. Can we trust her? I mean, we'd have to let her come here. The wards on Black Manor aren't secure enough yet and I don't think we could transport Remus anywhere without him breaking free and grabbing me."
"I think we should let him in," Amal said. He held up his hands when both Grandpa Arcturus and Mrs. Malfoy glared at him. "Look, seriously now, he's Lily's best friend. He's not gonna hurt Harry. The wards are incredible. We can keep him out more or less forever or we can let him in and learn what's going on. I think it's worth the risk."
"Oh, I was," Draco said. He grinned as Harry ran in and did a double-take to find Draco already there before him. "I was, but then Ivy brought word that there's a blue phoenix waiting to talk to Harry."
He gathered up the six little books and then looked around for a place to hide them. Draco snorted, reaching for them to give them to one of the elves to hide. Then he froze when Harry frowned.
The goblins had put up special wards that prevented anyone from forcing their way into the floo. They'd updated all the wards so that they were one hundred and eighty percent secure in every way possible. They'd called them war wards, which sounded just about right to Harry given that Voldemort's shade was still skulking about somewhere causing problems.
"We won't let him win," Harry said, voice grim. Their bond carried his absolute determination to see this through.
Bill and Charlie pulled Hermione, Ron, and Ginny away, leaving the twins and Neville there. No surprise at all, the twins immediately started asking a million rapid-fire questions, too quick to actually get answers. Neville sighed and perched on a chair as if he were hoping everyone would ignore him for a while.
They ended up tucked into blankets together on the biggest couch in the Potter Library. Between Dobby and Ivy, they had a mountain of food, plenty of tea in a specially charmed pot that would keep the tea properly hot without it ever going bitter, and a platter of biscuits that Harry started steadily eating his way through.
He couldn't blame her for it, though. The wards were very, very clear about the sheer amount of damage Father had inflicted on Mother. A junior Medi-wizard with only a limited spells at his disposal wasn't going to be able to do more than ease Mother's pain temporarily.
They were both so very tired. It'd been such a long couple of days and so long before that with Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia treating him so poorly. Harry could've fallen asleep right there and not regretted it at all, other than the numb butt he was sure to get.
Amal nodded once before shutting his eyes, lacing his fingers together over his belly and dropping into magical communion.
Harry laughed as he rubbed his free hand over his hip, trying to get rid of the sweat pooling on his palm. "Okay. Right. This is fine. It's all fine. Okay. Well, lead me to him. Do we have an appointment or anything? I mean, you need appointments, right?"
In the cell, Remus paced. Endlessly. Back and forth and back and forth, wringing his hands while muttering under his breath. Harry couldn't hear was Remus was saying to himself but wow, it really didn't look kind at all. If anything, it looked like Remus was yelling at himself.
Draco caught Harry's hands, pulling them away from his face and hair so that Harry wouldn't try to tear chunks of hair out of his head.  When Draco sucked in a breath, it was with the clear expectation that Harry would do it too. They held the breath, let it out slowly, pulled in a second breath and then let that out slow too.
The excitement shifted from delight in the grounds to a sort of speculation that made Draco narrow his eyes at Harry. Which only made Harry grin at him as he pulled Draco right back into the ballroom. To Draco's surprise, Harry pulled his wand out of his pants pocket and bit his lip for a second.
"Mother, I'd like you to do the same with Blue," Draco said. He waved for Mother to stay and Professor McGonagall to join them instead. "You're my regent. You hold the power of the Malfoys right now. I can't use it. You're the key person right now so you have to stay safe."
Harry could feel it thrumming through his magic, the strangely augmented magic that had spun a bond between him and Arcturus. When had that happened? During the healing?
The wards told Draco why. The only thing that had kept Father alive was the weak support he got from the family magic. Once that left him, Father's entire body, all his organs, collapsed and his core fractured under the Dark Lord's punishment.
Draco bit his lip. Then he had to act. But carefully. It wouldn't do to give Father an excuse to torture and kill him. Then again…
Draco shut his eyes and let himself drift off into sleep, the music of their soulbond humming around him with Harry's contentment.
Looking at his face was painful because of how bright his eyes were. That his roiling magic only showed there was stunning. It said a lot for just how much control Grandfather Arcturus had over his magic, despite having been weakened so dramatically.
"It won't?" Harry asked, approval and amusement at Draco being sneaky coming through the bond even though his face was a study in beetle-browed confusion.
Dobby and Ivy popped away, probably to get a mountain of food for Harry to eat. That was good. Fine really. Draco helped Harry up and then supported him on the walk up the hallway to the stairs out of the dungeon. How Harry was supposed to stay awake to explain all this, he didn't know, but he'd try. Harry wasn't about to let Dumbledore win and if he'd found a real way to make the blessing go away, well, they needed to figure out how to extend it to everyone else, too.
"No, none of that," Harry said, wagging a finger in Draco's face. "It will work. We'll do it. We'll free at least some people. Then we'll do it again and again and again until we free everyone."
"Did not betray Master Harry!" Dobby huffed. "Dobby can tell. Is still Master Harry's godfather so did not do it. Is a lie!"
"Harry!" Draco gasped. He scrambled on hands and knees, catching Harry's face. "Let go! The wards are locked. We're here. Focus on me, not them."
"Well, Lord Black and Mrs. Malfoy both agreed that we can't send Remus or Minerva to the bank," Mr. Swashlin said. "I've contacted Silverclaw and they're sending a team to look at them. Apparently, Dumbledore's been all up in their business over the last six or so hours, though, so they're not sure if they can safely send someone here until afternoon."
His scars stood out starkly against his skin. Harry counted six heartbeats and then magic ripped through the cell, startling Grandpa Arcturus into shoving Mrs. Malfoy backwards and away from the cell door.
Then pulled Harry to his feet. They headed across the ballroom, hand in hand, though Harry was following just because Draco seemed intent on whatever it was he was thinking. It was formless and dark in the bond, no details, or images to help Harry figure out Draco's issue.
Malfoy Manor had seemed immeasurably colder after coming back from Potter Keep despite his earlier work communing with the wards. That was fine. They'd welcomed everyone without a single bobble. It wasn't the magic that was the problem. It was the Manor itself.
The bond that he'd glimpsed last night fluoresced into visibility. It was still so beautiful, shimmering and pulsing in time with their hearts which hammered away. Draco jerked as he realized that there was another presence in that bond, a grey, nasty horrible one that felt just like the monster that had tortured Father to death.
Mrs. Malfoy hummed and tapped her fingernail against her bottom lip in a gesture that felt remarkably similar to Silverclaw's claw-tapping. Her eyes gleamed silver as she turned to Grandpa Arcturus who was grinning like a wolf. Next to him, Professor McGonagall shook her head, chuckling under her breath.
She grinned. "Late morning sounds perfect, Mr. Malfoy. Off to bed with both of you before I'm tempted to take preemptive points from the both of you."
"No," Harry said slowly, frowning almost as hard as Remus was. "I lived with them. Dumbledore placed me with them when my parents died."
"It would probably help Mother, anyway," Draco said. "When Father died, he'd just finished torturing her until she passed out."
"I can't believe this happened," Amal finally complained as Dobby refilled their tea and pushed the remaining three chocolate biscuits at Amal. "You've the worst luck I've ever seen, Harry."
The spell spun, deep green and celadon and lime yellow, in front of Harry for a moment. Then it spiraled out into a set of five interlocking rune circles. Harry blinked and then beamed as he realized that each of them represented one of the towers, plus a bigger one that covered the yard and the cliff that the Keep sat on.
He didn't snatch the letter away from Professor McGonagall, but Harry thought the only reason why was that Professor McGonagall looked like she'd stab Grandpa Arcturus with her quill if he tried it. Fifteen minutes later, after Grandpa Arcturus redrafted his letter, grumbling the whole time about bitter old biddies who'd been teaching for far too long, Harry carried both letters up to the battlements.
"Harry, you can't know that," Hermione said as if she knew more about everything that had happened than they did. "The Event's just confused you."
"It could be," Draco murmured, blushing that he'd either not hidden his thoughts deep enough that they would stay in his head instead of radiating through the bond or he'd spoken out loud, which was worse.
Harry shrugged. "Well, sure. I mean, we can't get back into Malfoy Manor to do it again anytime soon and it's sort of their job, isn't it?"
Harry hugged him even closer, snuggling up with Draco in his arms and him in Draco's arms and their bond humming with surprise and worry and slowly growing contentment.
Emily, the lady from outside, came in with that lovely silver tea set and a plate piled high with chocolate biscuits. She chuckled when Dobby huffed at her, letting Dobby take over serving. Thankfully, she shut the door behind her when she left because Mr. Swashlin spluttered and made outraged gestures as if he wanted to shout but couldn't quite get the words out.
"Accurate," Professor McGonagall agreed while swirling brandy in her glass. "Your point, Mr. Potter?"
"Black magic of the worst kind," Moody said. He nodded to Draco. "Keep your grip on the wards, kid. Then open the doors for us."
"Guys!" Neville shouted. He flung open the tent flap and ran inside. "Harry, Draco, your family wants you inside. We gotta hurry—Hogwarts has been sealed and there some huge spell brewing inside of it that has the elves in a tizzy."
"Potter Keep is intact, has new wards and you can recuperate there where you'll be safe," Harry said. He blushed as he realized that it was kind of sudden. "I mean, if you want to. But it would be safer than Black Manor."
"I've seen a great many," Remus said in a very professorial tone while rubbing the knuckles of his hands as if they ached just enough to bother him but not enough for him to notice. "This has… it's familiar, vaguely. But not enough for me to tell what it is. There's a sort of… gleam to it that I'm not sure of. I can't remember encountering it before."
For a moment, Draco felt the twins, too. The twins and Dobby and Ivy and Grandfather Arcturus who was up on one knee, shielding Remus and Professor McGonagall who were casting some sort of spell that he didn't recognize.
"He's my soulbond," Harry said. He shrugged completely calmly, even though Draco's stomach was in knots of nerves that were reflected through the bond to and from Harry. "Sorry, but that's just the way it is. Magic herself bonded us before we were born."
Then he'd popped away. Draco had drunk his hot chocolate while sitting on the floor exactly as a Malfoy never, ever did, and the three adults had had a little toast to the entire ordeal being over.
Harry stared up the long straight away that led to the heart of the labyrinth. The walls seemed twenty feet high now, still obsidian instead of hedge. Far, far ahead, miles it seemed, a warm golden light pulsed as if it was waiting for Harry.
The stacks of junk? Draco really wasn't sure what was up with that. Off to the left was a stack of chairs that reached twelve, fourteen feet high. A lovely harp of gold stood near it, all but a handful of the strings broken. Someone had stacked books between cracked teacups and saucers to the right and a mountain of shoes of every era lurked next to neatly stacked lanterns on top of a battered old chest that was the proper size for Hagrid.
They looped around the altar at the center of the amphitheater, so close that Harry could have reached out to touch it if he dared. The magic crackling around it, black and red and evil, made that altar as far away as the moon despite its physical proximity. Where he'd gone around the outside of the Malfoy labyrinth and worked his way inwards, Dumbledore's labyrinth was the exact opposite. They started at the center and looped their way outwards through four turns before they took the last straight approach to the heart.
"Good," Harry said. "Mr. Swashlin said that you were my mom's friend and my dad's friend, too. The wards told me that you're a werewolf. That's why you're locked in. Well, that plus all the grown-ups are overprotective, but I kind of like that. It's nice after Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon."
Draco raised his chin and nodded firmly at Harry like he had absolute confidence that Harry could handle this. He even smiled a little bit, a proud smile that sent a shiver up Harry's spine. So, maybe? Maybe Harry could handle it. He kind of had to. No way was he going to leave a bit of Voldemort in his scar, even if Dumbledore seemed to think it was no big deal.
"Don't I know it," Harry agreed with a roll of his eyes. "Though I think she'd have a lot to say about the quaint old religious practices and how pointless they are."
The moment where Harry stared at his hand on the train and looked back into Draco's face with nothing but scorn.
Harry cocked his head to the side as everyone nodded sadly. Even Dobby nodded though from the expression on his face, Dobby didn't agree with them. He was just nodding because all the humans were nodding.
Harry turned to Bill and Charlie, both of whom had gone white as sheets, their freckles standing out vividly blood red against their cheeks. Bill stood taller, more like a soldier looking at his general than a young man looking at a twelve-year-old kid. Charlie got a firmer grip on Hermione's arm because she was shaking her head no and making little horrified noises while tears poured down her cheeks.
"Dobby has not heard of ward stones doing that before," Dobby said, head cocked so far to the side that he looked like Hedwig when Harry did something silly. "Is probably not ward stone. Is probably Lady Magic. Dobby can feel wild magic in ward room, wrapping about Master Harry and ward stone but he cannot feel what Master Harry is feeling."
Father's elf Quinn popped in first, staggering over to Draco with tears running down his cheeks. Then the cook Yule popped in right at Ivy's side. She held Ivy's shoulder with one hand and Draco's wrist with another. Then Blue and Vern popped in, Blue from Mother's side and Vern from the gardens. They both grabbed for Draco, desperation writ large on their faces.
Draco wanted so badly for her to be awake, to be able to ask before he did this. Not that he could. Father would have known. Their marriage bond ensured that Mother was all but a slave to Father's desires in every single way.
Grandpa Arcturus' eyebrows went up as the considered it. "That would work. I've no interest in staying there at the moment, but it makes a good base to work from. We'll have to link the floos securely, perhaps set up special portkeys that would take us to and from that no one would be able to stop or steal. But it could work."
Harry rolled his eyes. "Anything is easier than that mess. I really hope we can figure it out because wow, I do not want to spend the rest of my life talking people through communing with their magic and being nice to that blessing on their cores. That'd take forever."
"No, just trying to shift my awareness of Mother's curse damage so that it stops… distracting me," Draco said as he waved one hand towards the door. He didn't open his eyes. "She's in a great deal of pain."
"Next door," Moody said. "Malfoy senior is dead. Tortured to death by You-Know-Who. The kid's taken over the family magic, activated the wards and… caught something you lot need to handle."
"I was Mistress Pretty when I was your age," Mother said. "Andromeda was Mistress Starry and Bellatrix was Mistress Scatter."
Draco pursed his lips and sniffed disapprovingly before drawling at him. "I am so terribly sorry that you weren't notified first. Goodness, how inappropriate of me. I certainly should have gone through Father's papers before notifying Gringotts or the Ministry or having gotten a healer in to take care of my mother's injuries after Father tortured her. Whatever was I thinking?"
Remus wiped the sweat from his forehead with his handkerchief. He didn't look like he understood that at all. Professor McGonagall frowned at them as if they weren't making sense. Thankfully, both Mother and Grandfather Arcturus seemed to be considering it.
"Cut my hand," Draco said, holding his wand hand out to Ivy. She stared, horrified. "Hurry! I don't have a knife, Ivy. We don't have long before... He'll come looking for me. For Mother!"
He got no farther before Mrs. Malfoy flung open the door and ran in to check on them both. She was fully dressed, hair wild and loose, but she'd obviously been awake all night.  The bags under her eyes were almost purple and her eyes were really badly bloodshot.
When Draco lay back down and stared it was the same. But staring towards the window in his bedroom, a narrow arrow slit that had been glazed with blue and cream stained glass in a simple diamond pattern, the not-wards shimmered in the corner of his eye.
"Yeah, he got bit when he was like six or so," Amal said. "He's spent his whole life trying to deal with it."
"I'm fine," Harry protested. He finally managed to make Mrs. Malfoy let go of him and darted behind Draco who snorted a laugh. "Really. I'm fine. Seriously. I'm free of them. I've got Potter Keep. I'm safe. I don't ever, ever, ever have to see them again."
"…Dobby and Ivy would need help," Dobby said thoughtfully while pacing in front of them. His boots thumped on the old oak floor like he was Hagrid's size. "If bring Quinn and Vern and Blue, will be enough elf-magic. Need to make sure that Wolfy-man is family first, though. So make family, transfigure, we removes curse, transfigure back, then we is doing things to help Wolfy-man with shifty-shifting."
"Well, sure," Harry said even though Remus started growling and Mrs. Malfoy looked horrified. "I mean, Amal's got reams of notes on all the stuff I went through. It's pretty darn obvious that Dumbledore doesn't care if I live or die long term. I think I'm supposed to survive just long enough to be a useful tool for him. I just don't know what I'm supposed to be useful for."
Draco/Harry/Fred/George saw Dumbledore's head whip around, heard him yell "no!" They dismissed that as the bright/white/hot/wild magic rose in them. Around them. Through them. Draco's bones flashed as bright as the sun. Harry's teeth were searchlights as he grimaced and snarled and fought to stay right… there…
Harry groaned. "Sorry. It's like I've got too much energy. I can't settle down even though I'm tired."
She shook her head before taking Draco's hand. He let Mother lead him away from the floo. The entire reason they were there was first, to go to check the Malfoy Library and second, to pick up a few things that would make life more comfortable in Potter Keep. Draco really didn't see the point. Ivy could bring him whatever he needed. Mother, however, had been quite firm that there a few things that she wanted to get personally.
Which was quite valid. Draco considered it for a moment, shrugged and turned to Harry who perked up.
Harry didn't suggest that Croaker go find another place to do the prayer ritual, not outright, but he did make sure to give Croaker everything that he could to replicate it. It might work. It might not. One way or the other, more people doing it would keep Dumbledore from stopping them and it might just save more people.
"You're helping fight the war," Harry protested. "How could it be a bad thing? I mean, if you have something, we need to use it. And quick, before this gets any worse."
"Oh, what have they done to you?" Mother whispered as she held Draco up and then guided him to one of the stiff-backed sofas that Father had decreed to be "appropriate" for the grand history of the Malfoy family.
He followed Dobby into Blackwell House, doing his best not to ogle the late Victorian elevator with its gold-painted open metal grill work or the beautiful ironwork on the stair railing leading up to the next level. They took the elevator, which had big round buttons set high on the side of the elevator and a sliding grate for a door, all the way up to the fifth floor.
"Oh, Harry didn't do anything," Draco said. He sighed and shut his eyes again. "Goodness, that's just exhausting. How odd. I didn't take that long, did I?"
"Thank you," Harry said, smiling at Dobby. "If you need me, let me know. I'll… find a way to help somehow."
"Huh, good idea," Harry said. "Okay, can I slip into the bathroom without messing up what you did? I'd like to get cleaned up. And, you know, change into clean clothes."
Not a big one. It was pretty simple, actually, with broad lines to walk down and only a few right-angle turns before you got to the center where everything waited. Dumbledore must not have wanted to go through a big process before he got to work.
They ran to the floo room, arriving before everyone else. Grandpa Arcturus arrived a moment later, holding Cooper's hand and wild-eyed with fury. Remus ran in, skidding on the slick marble floor. Amal ran into him a moment later and nearly knocked the two of them down.
Harry blinked and then did take a deep breath the way Draco wanted. He let it out slowly. Only then did Draco continue, biting his lip and gripping Mrs. Malfoy's hand.
The blessing wasn't really aware. Or alive. It was more like the newly-hatched baby snake he'd encountered early one spring while weeding Aunt Petunia's garden. Instinct and impulses with not much behind it.
Draco prayed and focused and tried to direct the waves of wild magic that flowed like stars in a river going out to sea, like waves in a pond that had a rock thrown into them. His breath slowed. Deepened.
Draco's breath caught all over again, this time because his heart pounded so hard that the world went grey and Ivy's face was a distant blob viewed through a long, echoing tunnel. He wheezed, sucking air into his lungs as he held Ivy's hands. She clung to him as desperately as he clung to her.
Harry really didn't want to believe that there were very small fingers scattered on that butcher's table, but it sure looked like it.
Dobby had to push Harry again to get his feet moving. Mr. Swashlin's office was just what Harry would expect from such a place. It had cream walls and big bookcases full of books and Mr. Swashlin's computer had three monitors that were all flat as a painting, unlike the big bulky one that Dudley had on his computer.
He stopped when Harry frowned at him. His wide eyes, dark irises shot through with lightning bolts of lemon and celadon, shimmered with magic. And then with tears that welled up as their bond shared what Harry meant before he said the words out loud.
"No, Dobby is doing great, Master," Ivy said with a giggle. "He is very, very, very happy being an only Elf. Dobby did not like sharing duties. He brags about how he does all the things for Master Harry. Ivy would not want that. Ivy likes doing clothing and personal things for Master Draco. She does not want to be doing shopping and cleaning and gardening and library and everything else, too."
He pulled, pulled as hard as he could with his broken hands and his magic and his soul, dragging Harry back out of the wild magic that was the heart of the ritual. At the same time, Draco felt Dobby pulling on his bond to Harry and Mrs. Weasley shouting as she tried to rouse Fred and George.
Headmaster Dumbledore had smiled benignly when Draco delicately questioned him before the end of term about sanctuary. Draco's wrists and back and shoulders still ached from the beating Father had given him once he got home.
"Croaker said that he believed that the Dark Lord may have created as many as six," Mother said. "The Unspeakables are working to discover and capture them all."
"That jerk!" Harry shouted. "Every time I talked to him, he stared into my eyes like he was trying to see straight through my soul. You mean he really was?"
"He wants power," Draco murmured. He turned to Mrs. Malfoy who was very alert as she stared at Draco. "Mother, which is more powerful, a blessing or a prayer to the Old Gods?"
"Oh,wow. Not good," Harry said as the wards helpfully provided a stored signature of Dumbledore's magic on the curses designed to drive Remus to kill everyone other than Harry, who he was supposed to kidnap and return to Dumbledore. "Yep. The curses, plural, were cast by Dumbledore."
Her grip on his hands was so tight that it made his bones ache. Draco nodded and reached for her bond. At the same time, Ivy shoved her bond at him so hard that it fluoresced into visibility.
Moody's whirling eye disappeared down a grey, echoing tunnel. He dove in and caught Draco's shoulders, shaking Draco until Draco wheezed and glared at him. There was sweat on Moody's forehead and his magical eye didn't whirl at all as he stared at Draco.
The parchment bloomed with a map of Hogwarts that showed every single room, every floor, every inch of the castle including tunnels and secret passages that Harry'd had no idea existed. Fred shrugged one shoulder and waved at the map.
"What are you doing here?" Draco demanded in the most hostile tone imaginable even though he really wasn't angry. Stunned, yes. Not angry. "What did you do to Lord Black?"
Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair, fingers catching on a million different knots that he should try to comb out. But wouldn't. Not until morning. Or, more accurately, not until he woke up since it was already morning.
"Can you… choose… who to serve?" Harry asked as his stomach clenched in knots around the horrible cheese sandwich dinner he'd been given. Or was that nerves?
Magic like stars filled everything. His hair, his eyes, his body, the world, everything was magic. Draco shuddered and bit his lip. Stars erupted from the pain and drifted upwards towards the sapphire and forest green sky with its millions upon millions of dancing stars.
"Can we give Tippy the cloak?" Harry asked Draco because Draco was way better at tactics. "He could take it, go hit Dumbledore from behind or something and stay hidden. Or maybe use it to hide the elves. They'd all fit underneath it."
"Potter, your random ideas tend to be the most powerful and dangerous ones," Draco said with a tired sigh that seemed to come from the very bottoms of his feet. He tilted his head back and shut his eyes as if he were as exhausted as he'd been last night.
Grandfather Arcturus' eyebrows went up as he studied the display. "That's… unexpected. Perhaps the ritual that freed me from the curse killing me wiped away anything else Dumbledore did to me."
"Yes," Draco breathed as a grin bloomed on his face. "Yes, of course! We don't tell her that she'd coming to help you."
"I'm sorry that notice hasn't gotten here yet," Draco said. "I'm afraid that Father died yesterday morning due to… health issues related to the last war. The family magic chose me as Lord, though of course, Mother is my regent until I reach my majority."
"Neither do we," Harry said. "But we have to get into the center of his labyrinth, Tippy. Where is he?"
"Heh, wind flowing through my hair," Amal said with a huge grin. "It's different for everyone. You just… meditate on your magic, let it well up in and around you. The magic finds the blocks and breaks them."
They took the next step, both glowing and gritting their teeth at the anger and pain and misery throbbing through Dumbledore's labyrinth. Harry made himself breath slowly, forcing the air through his teeth. Every breath was a grimace, a punch to the gut. Every step was hauling himself forward after a Harry Hunting.
Both Mother and Grandfather Arcturus looked confused. Cooper sucked in a startled breath while Blue squeaked and stared at Ivy who nodded proudly. That seemed to startle Grandfather Arcturus even more because he hummed as he came over to kneel in front of Draco.
"Um, no," Harry said and then grinned as Dobby perched in the other chair and wiggled proudly as he straightened his uniform. "I haven't gotten any letters from you. I don't think my aunt and uncle have, either."
Blue had been very gentle putting Mother to bed. She'd spelled what few and weak healing potions they had into Mother's stomach and made sure that she was comfortable, well-hydrated and warm. Quinn had been far less careful with Father. Where Mother was in her nightgown, hair brushed and braided, Father was still in his clothes from yesterday. Even his shoes were still on his feet.
Grandpa Arcturus started and blinked several times when Draco cleared his throat. "What? Did I miss something?"
He'd never been comfortable going deeper into the bank. The carts were a terror and the caverns with their many vault doors hiding who knew what were worse. Doing it now, after claiming the Malfoy family magic?
Just as Harry caught his breath and nodded once to Draco that he was fine, the magic of the ritual surged inwards at Harry.
"Yes, Master Draco," Blue said. "Vern and Yule is ready, too. We be here, protecting Mistress while you does what you needs to."
Draco violently did not want the master suite. Certainly, it was two suites connected to each other in a way that would be perfect for him and Harry, but the sheer thought of sleeping in the bed where Father died, where he raped Mother night after night after night, made Draco's stomach turn.
"Can I come peek in the ward room?" Harry asked. He grinned at the little huff Draco made. "I'm just curious. The Potter ward stone sounds so different from yours. It'd be neat to, you know, crane my neck and look in the room to see what's different."
Draco huffed and shook his head. "Well, I wish them both much joy together then. Dobby was always a handful. A very loud, very energetic, very slippery handful."
"Nope," Harry said. "I mean, if I can get some money from the bank, I know Dobby and I could go stay in a hotel in Muggle London, but I'd really rather have a place that's warded and secure and, even better, unplottable. Hermione found out about unplottable locations last year and spent a whole week studying how they're made unplottable. I… kind of listened? I mean, I don't want to make them. I just want to have one."
"I don't know," Harry said in the same tone of voice because it was better than admitting how nervous he was. "I'm not sure you're smart enough for my books, Malfoy."
"Bad Dumbles is dead," Ivy said. She let Draco go and levitated Draco's stretcher. "Tippy died, too. He was saving Master Wolfy. Master Wolfy is very sick from Bad Dumbles' blood and very upset about full change, but is alive. Professor Kitty is alive. Her elf Lilac isn't. Lilac was taking a curse for her Mistress."
The instant Harry stepped off the first stone onto the white gravel path between the hedges, the gravel began to glow. Harry nearly skittered backwards in shock. Part of him hadn't expected it to work. That it did was stunning, especially after a lifetime with Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon's profound distrust of all things religious.
But then, Father had been an idiot who'd willingly bound himself to a monster and then died at the monster's disembodied hand.
"I doubt it," Grandpa Arcturus said. "Lucius is paranoid and quite vicious to her and Draco both. I certainly wouldn't invite them here."
"I'm the first Malfoy in three generations to touch the Malfoy wards," Draco said with a tired sigh. "And the first in three generations not to be enslaved by a dark lord. Who we were before Grindelwald and Voldemort is… very different from who my grandfather and father were. I'd agree that Father and Grandfather were actually evil though."
"That will be Harry and I," Draco said, rolling his eyes when everyone, especially Mother and Professor McGonagall opened their mouths to protest. "There's no one else who can do it. No one else has the bonds necessary. Between Harry, me, Fred, and George, we should be able to take the spell straight to Dumbledore himself. We'll just need the rest of you to distract him until the moment we can strike. As soon as we can, we'll need to message Gringotts and the Department of Mysteries so that they can muster troops to keep Dumbledore fully distracted. It's the best chance Harry, Fred, George and I have to break his power for good."
Harry flopped down into the purple velvet covered armchair in the Black Library. It wasn't as comfy as the chairs in Potter Keep but it was nice and warm. Draco perched on the forest green armchair across from Harry, as much of a prat as he always was at school.
Draco brushed his fingertips across Mother's cheek. Her magic fluttered under the touch, then stilled when it realized that it was Draco.
"Harry?" Hermione stuck her head out from one of the other rooms which had been curtained off with a white sheet. "Harry!"
He popped back out, the quietest pop that Harry had heard out of Dobby yet. Then a moment later Draco and Ivy popped in with Dobby by their sides. Draco immediately grabbed Harry's hands, clinging to him and shuddering.
"I'm outright forbidden from working any level of magic beyond the most minor," Grandfather Acturus said with a scowl as he threw himself into one of the armchairs. "Neither of you have the training or the energy to do it."
The wards warned Draco that Mother was running down the hallway towards the ward room. Grandfather was on her heels, as was Professor McGonagall. Remus and Amal turned and headed for the back door out to the grounds.
Dumbledore's dark labyrinth had lines just wide enough for one grown man to stride through it. Two twelve-year-old boys couldn't quite walk side by side, not as they were. But when Harry looped one arm around Draco's waist, that gave them just enough room to step down onto the stained black line together.
The bond was a house elf's very lifeblood. For Ivy to have been surviving on those bare little scraps of magic was horrifying. Draco poured his magic towards Ivy, feeding it into the bond and pulling the loose ends his way.
Draco paused and then leaned forward to take Ivy's shaking hands. "Is Harry Potter stronger than Father?"
Draco laughed and shook his head fondly at Harry. "Yes, we are, though you don't need to say it that way."
"Pretty much has to be," Draco agreed. He pointed at the ring that was flashing and rotating. "Touch that one and order it to identify who's attacking."
Grandfather Arcturus hugged Harry, put a proud hand on Draco's shoulder that took his breath away, and then strode out of the library while calling for his elf Cooper to bring him parchment, ink and a new quill.
"Yes, well, that's not possible right now, is it?" Draco snarled at him. "And no, I'm not "giving" them to you. I'm expecting you to do your job and properly seize and destroy the horrible things. Or the Department of Mysteries. I don't know who does these things. Father never taught me that and they certainly don't mention it in your first year at Hogwarts. We barely learned a thing in DADA last year."
"Yes!" George said. "See here? This one goes from Hogsmeade back to Hogwarts. This one might work, too, but it's not underground most of the way. It goes from the Shrieking Shack to the Whomping Willow. You have to be careful, press just the right knot on the Willow or it'll brain you."
"Worship of the Old Gods does still exist, Mr. Potter," Professor McGonagall said primly enough that Harry suspected that sometime soon, or as soon as she could leave Potter Keep, she was going to go and curse Aunt Petunia into oblivion. "There are songs, dances and celebrations that go back thousands of years. It's a whole branch of magic that…"
"I kind of stole him," Harry said, rolling his eyes Fangtooth and Arcturus stared at him. "He wanted to be stolen! It's a long story. Either way, he's happier with me now and that let me get to Amal and he got me to the bank and that's what led to you being saved so it's good. Which is not my good news."
"What is that thing?" Draco gasped as he carefully approached the window to stare as the blue automobile flew by well outside the wards.
Draco nodded. "Just us, then. We'll run them up to the Green suite, hide them in with the pornography."
"You fell asleep," Draco said, patting Harry's side and relaxing under his grip, "Grandfather sent messages to Gringotts and the Department of Mysteries, and a blue phoenix is waiting to talk to you."
Hermione's warm brown cheeks went pale enough that Harry pushed her over to one of the squashy sofas. She collapsed onto it, clinging to Harry's hands. Her teeth were chattering, dramatically chattering, and her hands were like ice.
"Ivy, will you be my elf?" Draco whispered. The words came out a bare sliver of sound. Even with this plan, mad as it was, he was too afraid to speak loudly.
"Dobby does not know how," Dobby said. "If Wolfy-man was something else, elves could be removing curses. He is not. Is wolfy-man."
Mother brushed a hand over the combs and smiled as if it might break her face. "They were a wedding gift from Lord Black. Lucius… never liked them."
Hedwig was gone, out the window or something. One of Dobby's pants pockets bulged a little, so he must have shrunk the cage and Harry's trunk. Dobby took Harry's hand and they snuck down the stairs together since Dobby had already checked the wards, last night, and seen that he couldn't pop Harry in or out without letting Dumbledore know exactly what had happened.
"Can we get the soul anchor out of Harry?" Draco asked. She poked his elbow and gestured towards the milk. "Fine. But I do want to know."
"Yes," Draco agreed as they started down the stairs as one, hidden under Harry's father's invisibility cloak. "We will win. Together."
Ginny stood half behind Bill who smiled sadly at Hermione as Draco served tea and pushed it into her hands. Ron had flopped onto one of the other sofas. He already had a sandwich in his hands. The twins leaned against each other over near the entrance to the room with the big windows, firmly distancing themselves from their siblings as if they didn't want to be caught in the blast radius when Harry, or maybe Draco, went off.
"Oh," Dobby said, nodding so hard that his ears flapped. "Sure, is simple. Wolfy-man has never full-shifted. Is not full werewolf yet. Only if full-shifts and kills will werewolf curse be fully stuck in core. Then curses have full grip on him and poof, he dies unless he gets Master Harry back to bad Dumbles. Curses want to grab, can't because not all werewolf yet. Can't take curses off because is part werewolf so have some grab."
Either way, it was after midnight when the Unspeakables finally gathered up the last handful of less dangerous dark artifacts from Father's office. They'd expected, obviously from their blank-faced stares, Draco to protest. Instead, Draco had gladly given them permission to take the lot away with no demands for compensation, return of the artifacts or any questions.
This was horrible. He was so tired! Draco stumbled back through his bedroom, through the Green sitting room, the Blue sitting room and into Harry's bedroom where Harry was pacing and swinging his arms and generally looking so manic that Draco wanted to whine about how much energy Harry had. Or the Gryffindor red and gold pajamas. Those were hideous, so very bright and far too large for Harry since they puddled around his body.
"Darling, didn't I say you and Harry shouldn't do anything?" Mother said in a rather too sharp and too frightened tone as she stepped to their couch and knelt to scan Draco.
Draco rubbed his hands over his face as he carefully eased onto the bed next to Harry. The bedrooms at Potter Keep were so much smaller and warmer than Malfoy Manor. He huffed and shook his head. He really did need to set Mother and Blue to updating the Manor. It didn't need to be so formal and cold.
Harry offered Dobby a fist to bump and laughed when Dobby enthusiastically did just that. That simplified all the plotting the grownups were doing. Apparently, they'd all decided that they had to find a way to keep Aquila from getting into the wards too far, even though there was a special spot just for letting him in. And other flying people, too, not that Harry really thought anyone was going to ride their brooms all the way out here.
"Nod for yes," Draco whispered. Her hands clenched in her dress at the same time Draco's clenched on his knees. "Dobby will never answer me or Father again."
The ward room at the very base of Hogwarts was sealed. Draco knew he should have expected that. The door was a heavy stone slab that more than likely took special spells and knowledge to open. Or at least the proper bloodlines.
He shut his eyes as all the elves bowed their heads, even Ivy. Draco took a deep breath and then let it out slowly. First the Elves. Then Father. He would figure this out.
Remus was tall and thin like Grandpa Arcturus, with that same sort of been sick for a long time feel to him. Despite that, he moved like he was dangerous and very, very strong. His wand was out. The snarl revealed elongated canine teeth. And his eyes glowed gold as he paced.
Blue bit her lip as Draco carefully sat on the edge of his mother's bed. "Mistress is not waking, Master Draco. Is not waking for hours and hours and hours yet. Blue made very, very sure."
Draco uncurled, feet going back to the polished marble floor when Dobby didn't appear before him instantly. Seconds ticked by with only the sound of the fire crackling away in the fireplace. Draco's heart began to beat wildly.
Who, not surprisingly, had ducked down so that only her eyes and ears peeked above the edge of the bed.
"I've already sealed the Malfoy wards so that he can't get in," Draco said. "That was, oh, Merlin, the fourth thing I did? Maybe fifth. I had the Goblins make sure it would hold against him no matter what that abusive old man tried."
"What we really need," Amal said as they went back down the stairs, all three of them side by side because the staircase was wide enough for four to climb it together, "is more information. Is there anyway you can get Narcissa alone?"
Ivy bit her lip and then drew one finger along the base of Draco's thumb. There was no pain, but blood still welled up. Draco slapped his bloody palm against the ward stone.
"Pockets are important," Harry agreed and then sat on the floor to laugh and hug Dobby who giggled and hugged him right back. "Oh, and you have a little badge, too."
Draco couldn't ever remember thinking that anything was possible if you just kept trying. What with Father setting strict limits on what Draco and Mother could think or say or do or wear or eat, his life had been defined by the word "no".
Dobby popped back in and nodded vigorously.  "Dobby will do so. He will get Blue and Cooper and Lilac to help. We will all makes sure that they eat."
Harry laughed at last, opening his hands and lifting up his chin as he walked out of the labyrinth and into the heart of magic that lay at its core.
Just a little longer. Draco gritted his teeth and kept his grip on the wards as tight as possible. He only had to hold on a little longer and then he could finally relax.
"House elves is not allowed clothes, Master," Dobby said, blushing as he smoothed on hand over his grubby pillowcase. "That is for Masters."
"This is amazing," Draco whispered. He wrapped an arm around Harry's shoulders, taking part of the weight and fall of the cloak from Harry. "I've never seen one so well-made before. I'd think it was Death's cloak like from the stories."
The Dark Mark surged, exploding outwards to drive Draco away. Ivy's magic caught Draco before he could be flung into the wall. Barely. The surge still nearly knocked Draco out. He panted and struggled back to his feet, determined to try again if that was what it took to start another round of the Dark Lord's torture.
"There has to be!" Harry exclaimed. "I can't let Dumbledore get away with just… throwing Remus' life away. He as good as killed Remus himself but left it to us to stop his heart. No. I won't accept that. I can't accept that."
"But he couldn't be behind it!" Hermione protested with tears blooming in her eyes. "He's a great man!"
"Yes," Draco whispered far too quietly for anyone to hear it over the chanting and the rising scream of the Dark Lord's soul anchor.
As his eyes slid shut, Draco leaned his head against Mother's shoulder. He was safe. Truly safe. Fake Dumbledore couldn't get at him. Lady Magic had wiped the majority of the warped blessings away. His family was here. His friends, the elves, too.
"Wow," Harry breathed once the door to the floo room shut. "Does that mean that the real Dumbledore is dead or was he tortured and imprisoned all this time?"
Ron didn't get to say another word because Harry was suddenly in front of Draco, his arm finishing a swing. No, a punch. That knocked Ron on his arse and left him spluttering and staring up at Harry as he pressed a hand to the bright red fist print on his cheek.
Tears welled up in Draco's eyes as the family magic settled into his core. His knees gave way despite Quinn and Ivy supporting him. He ended up with his forehead pressed against the bloody ward stone, crying for the father he had never gotten the chance to know.
"I can," Silverclaw declared. "It would be a more profitable use of my time, as well. Escort me back to the floo, Mr. Potter. There's money to be made. It profits no one to leave it sitting."
"You like the idea of having someone who knows you," Harry said. He poked Draco's shoulder. "Don't try to lie to me."
"And Mr. Swashlin," Draco agreed. "Plus Silverclaw. We… might be able to get out of it. I think we still have a couple of hours left before it's too late. Maybe. If the contract isn't cancelled within seventy-two hours of my father's death, it's considered to be ratified unchanged. Then the penalty clauses would be… quite horrific."
Harry huffed and shook his head before letting go of Harry's hand. He started pacing just like Dobby had though Harry's trainers made no noise at all on the oak floors. As he paced, Harry gestured and scowled and huffed.
His favorite was picturing the colors of the rainbow one by one while soothing his magic and then his body and his mind by picturing the color seeping into him, filling him up and then washing away. It always left him peaceful, calm, and contented.
"We're alive," Draco said, laughing. "Could you possibly let my hands go, please? We broke each other's hands."
"Master is going to stops watching over Mistress?" Ivy asked. She didn't even need to frown to make it clear she thought that was a bad idea.
"Eh, probably Dumbledore," Harry said. He rolled his eyes as Percy huffed and muttered 'Grindelwald' into his teacup. "Come on, he's lived as Dumbledore way longer than he has as Grindelwald. I'm not going to try and convince people to call him anything else. It's a waste of time."
He tucked the athame away, cupped the blood in the palm of his hand, and as Harry took the final few steps, turned his hand over to let the blood drop down onto the first of the ancient rune circles.
Draco barely even paused when Ivy popped in and swapped Draco's emerald green silk pajamas for a dreadfully stylish set of greenish-grey trousers, a silver-grey shirt and an open robe in a faintly yellowish green that was the exact same style as Harry's.
"I would be too if someone locked me in a room and didn't let me out," Harry said. Seemed quite reasonable to him to be angry.
The library was cold. Both in temperature and in the magical feel of it. Draco snorted as Mother headed straight to the section of the library holding their ancient religious texts. When Grandfather Arcturus raised an eyebrow, Draco shook his head.
"No, of course not," Draco replied. He swallowed and Harry realized that the stomach-churning nerves were at least three quarters Draco's nerves getting to him.
"You do not need sanctuary!" Father had bellowed as he beat Draco bloody, healing each stripe between blows so that Draco would hurt and scream and beg but never succumb to shock or unconsciousness. "You are my heir, and you will behave like it!"
"There's a soul shard wrapped up in a spelled diary," Draco said as he rubbed his temples. "That is the worst of them. Three glory hands that need to be destroyed immediately. And two grimoires that steal your soul as you work with them. Several others, too, but those are the worst."
Dobby plopped down next to Harry, waving one hand, making all the rubble go away. In its place were two stretchers that lifted Harry and Draco off the floor smoothly. Only a few inches but it was definitely better than the rubble had been.
"He's…" Draco tipped his head sharply to one side, then shook his head. "I was about to say that I'm astonished that Madame Pomfrey and Professor McGonagall didn't catch that he has a learning disability, but then I remembered who we're talking about. They probably didn't even check. Why would a son of a pureblood line have any problems with learning?"
Draco strode up the long, dark hallway leading to the grand parlor where the biggest fireplace was; the only one linked to the Floo system in all of Malfoy Manor. Father had locked the floo powder away. Draco couldn't escape through the floo, but it was better than anywhere else in the manor right now. At least here, Draco could imagine that he might be free someday.
"If he wants them," Quinn said with a little sniff of disdain, "he can puts them on himself, Master Draco. You is sure this is wise?"
Huh. Kind of like how Harry and Dobby had saved each other by pure desperation and the refusal to give up.
He wasn't. He most definitely wasn't fine. He wasn't even the sort of fine that he claimed back at Privet Driven when Aunt Petunia starved him, and Uncle Vernon bellowed at him, and Dudley beat him. But he hadn't crashed into the wall and his broom was still flying.
Dobby sighed and curled around his belly like he was starving. Or maybe like he felt sick to his stomach. Harry patted Dobby's shoulder again, giving him a little squeeze.
An hour and a half later, after lots of cursing, lots of spells and tests and Silverclaw gouging furrows in the stone of the fireplace surround and then fixing it with his fingers alone, Harry had Dobby bring them all treats. Hot chocolate for him and Draco. Drinks of a bunch of different varieties for everyone else. Silverclaw's drink was on fire.
"Masters can ask Come and Go room for a way down into ward room. Bad Master Dumbles cannot stop that. Cannot block it. Hid the Come and Go room long and long ago but we elves remember. We tells those who needs Come and Go Room. Good Masters goes and kills him. Wish for what Masters need, wish very, very hard. Come and Go room will make it be."
Mother huffed as she settled onto the sofa with Harry and Draco. She shut her eyes and then her magic welled up, silver and green, just as Amal's had and Draco's had. It took her a bare three minutes before the purple and puce magic blasted away from her. When she opened her eyes, she huffed before shielding a huge yawn behind one upraised hand.
Effective madness but then that was what Harry excelled at. He was so very in tune with Lady Magic at her wildest that he did things that no one in their right mind would ever consider and made them work. He'd stolen Dobby, found his seneschal, saved Grandfather Arcturus, forged an alliance with Draco out of nowhere, saved most of the magical world and now all of this.
"Oh, thank goodness," Harry said, sagging a little as he took his broom. "Okay, Ivy, Dobby, you're to stay here and listen for us. Once we cross the line under the wards, one of you goes back to the twins. The other stays here."
"Oh, stop it," Harry huffed as he pulled himself free. "We've taken precautions and frankly, I don't think she'd have waited if she was a threat."
Harry turned to Draco, wagging one finger at him. "Did it stop sometime around when Dumbledore got to be the Supreme Mugwump? Or when he took over the school? High Warlock maybe?"
"Is here," Ivy said, popping in with a scroll of parchment that she passed to Draco with a frown of distaste. "Master must not marry little Parkinson. She is not good for him. Master Harry is good."
"It was your idea," Harry huffed right back at him. "So that you had a clear feeling for what the twins magic felt like and strong link to them while I got us in position to start."
"Give us your aid. Help us purify Magic. Let us bring the Light of Hope into the Heart of Darkness."
George was the one to pull a piece of parchment from his pocket. He opened it up and spread it out on the table, ignoring Remus who sat up very straight with a delighted grin and Professor McGonagall who groaned and rolled her eyes while muttering under her breath.
Draco sat up and stared across the room. Nothing. No shimmering green and blue light. He didn't see a thing.
Draco snorted. "Mother, they couldn't interact with the wards. No one has changed or updated or even listened to the ward notices since Grandfather was marked. The Dark Mark blocked their ability to interact with or control the wards."
There were a whole class of questions that Harry wanted to ask about how long wizards actually lived on average, whether or not there were ways to extend lifespans that didn't involve Philosopher's Stones and how old Arcturus Black actually was. Harry didn't ask. His brain was too busy running in circles because, apparently, he had a castle.
Hopefully. Though Harry wasn't at all sure about the whole visitation by a potential deity thing. After Remus and Professor McGonagall lecturing about the Old Gods for half the morning, Harry was a bit nervous about the concept of inviting one to show up.
Mother put a hand over her mouth though it did nothing whatsoever to hide her laughter. It did shield her teeth so that she wouldn't offend Silverclaw by displaying fangs at him. Silverclaw's lips curled in a tight but wide smile.
Aquila trilled again, nodding. She nodded towards the note in Harry's hand and then flamed away off the battlements and back to the pine tree. Professor McGonagall shook her head before gesturing to Harry to open the message.
"Grant us your aid," Harry continued. He could hear the twins saying it, too, could feel Dobby and Ivy with their hands clasped tightly as they prayed along with them.
"A powerful wizard or witch will live on average two hundred and twenty years, Mr. Potter," Silverclaw said. "There are methods to extend one's lifespan much farther than that, but they have consequences."
They'd wanted so badly to help but the Dark Lord's Mark prevented them from properly serving Father. The way the blessing had been laid prevented it from doing what it needed to do, too. Draco hummed.
Aunt Petunia was humming. Humming and smiling as she dusted the living room. There was no sign of Dudley or Uncle Vernon which would explain why Aunt Petunia looked so happy. She always seemed happiest when there was no one around to mess up her house or expect things out of her.
He put one hand on the top of the stack, one hand underneath, cupping Harry's hands. This wasn't going to be easy. It wasn't going to be safe, really. Draco would have to be in the ward room because that was the only place that he could work with wards. They didn't have the training to set up proper wards around the labyrinth so it would have to be the Malfoy Manor wards.
She stared at the spell, mouth working even though no noise came out. After a moment, Professor McGonagall thrust herself away from the doorframe and snapped her wand out, handle first. She passed it over to Grandpa Arcturus who took it as if she'd just given him a knife and commended him to stab her with it.
He let Draco out of the hug and then promptly claimed one of his hands. It might be the bond, or it might not, but Harry just felt better when he was touching Draco. Which was going to make Hogwarts really darn uncomfortable given that they were in different houses.
Just like Mrs. Malfoy had said, Professor McGonagall had come to help Remus. Harry was trying really, really hard not to resent the fact that she would come for Remus, but she'd never even tried to listen to him or help him last year. The whole thing with the Philosopher's Stone was the cherry on top of the awful sundae, but there were a dozen other things that had happened that made fighting his resentment super-hard.
The two of them went in. No one was in the first chamber of the tent. Harry stared around, delighted by the contrast between the inside and the outside. It was a proper home, really, full of squashy furniture and warm curtains that all but shouted that it belonged to the Weasley family. Off to the right there were windows that let in beautiful shafts of golden light. A chandelier hung from the peak of the tent. Better still, there was a wonderful old pot-bellied cast iron stove in the middle of the tent and steps that led up into other rooms in the tent.
"Back at the Burrow. He ran away after the Event," Percy said, glowering at the map and not noticing at all how everyone had edged away from Remus. Even Hermione was backing off, though Draco wondered whether it was because she understood that gold eyes like that meant werewolf or not.
Dobby popped in with clothes for Harry. Instead of waiting for Harry to strip down and change, Dobby snapped his fingers and swapped Harry's pajamas for the jeans, T-shirt, and casual open robe in sapphire blue that he'd chosen for Harry to wear.
He didn't struggle. Moody was right. This trip up to Father's office took a quarter the time it had before. Croaker strode at their side like a living shadow. He didn't say a single word until they reached the doors. Father had spelled them to close automatically. The protections on them were ferocious, lethal.
When Harry pulled Dobby into a laughing hug, Dobby giggled and hugged Harry right back. He was a lot stronger than he seemed, picking Harry up off his feet for a second before setting him down and then wiggling his ears happily.
You know, except for the office's location. It couldn't be cheap to have an office here of all places.
The floo didn't want to let them through. It wanted to keep them there, locked inside Malfoy Manor. Harry snarled and pulled hard.
"Very," Draco agreed. "But if this works, it should save Remus. That gives us one more ally. Maybe two, if you can calm down."
Just that one word. Inside of it, inside their bond, a huge swell of determination, refusal to accept anything related to the Dark Lord, and a sort of need that brought tears to Draco's eyes.
Dobby nodded much more seriously. "Is Master Harry's crest. Potter on top. Gryffindor on left and Peverell on right. Slytherin bottom since Master Harry's mother defeated last heir to Slytherin."
He strode out of the room before Harry could ask any further questions. Harry kind of wanted to follow him, to pester him with questions about why it had to be Grindelwald instead of anyone else, but there probably wasn't a point to that. Especially not when Remus strode after him, calling something about watching for curses in the back as the ballroom door shut behind him.
Even after a year at Hogwarts, magic was a wonder. Maybe especially after a year at Hogwarts. It wasn't like Harry had done all that much studying. Or like he'd been taught anything truly complicated.
It felt like a shade, a soul, an angry ghost haunting Father through the Dark Mark. Who knew? Maybe that was how the Dark Lord tortured Father for all of Mother's attempts to save him.
"Master Harry needs to sleeps," Dobby declared. He glared up at Harry with his fists thrust against his hips, tapping one foot impatiently.
"You're not wrong," Grandpa Arcturus said. "I was poisoned not long after a… disagreement I had with Dumbledore. I'd intended to go find out just what testimony Sirius had given. Then in the middle of the night I was struck ill and could only struggle to survive. Narcissa Malfoy visited often. I suspect that she's the only reason I'm still alive. She brought me so many potions and purging draughts."
Predictably, Draco gasped and stared at Harry in horror. Grandpa Arcturus clapped a hand over his mouth so that his curses were muffled. A little bit. Not a lot. Harry could still make out exactly what he was saying. It wasn't half as bad as some of the things Uncle Vernon used to say to him. Harry squawked as Mrs. Malfoy turned and enveloped him in a hug.
Dobby popped away, leaving Remus with his jaw dropped open and Mrs. Malfoy with her hands over her mouth.
"Dobby will make lots of good food," Dobby promised as Harry helped Arcturus stand. "He goes now and does it, Master Harry. Will start the fires and make Potter Keep ready for you."
"Neither do I," Draco admitted. He sighed and dismissed the ward spell. "All right. I suppose you should use it. Do you think both of us could fit under it? It would be much easier to get downstairs to the ward room if you could bring me to the stairs under it. Once there, there's not much chance of anyone seeing me going down."
Draco licked his lips as he studied the invitation from Lord Arcturus Black. The owl had already departed, winging off the instant the invitation was in Draco's hands.
Ivy nodded and snapped her fingers. The little blue book appeared in her hands. When Draco set her on the table, Ivy swung her feet and cocked her head to the side as Draco flipped through the rituals.
Harry crossed his arms over his chest, glaring into the ritual room. "If it's that many, then that's the point. One or two? That's chance. A few, that's just statistical variation. We learned about that in primary last year during the election. With that many? He's doing it on purpose though I've no idea why."
"…You're surprisingly good at this sort of political maneuvering," Grandpa Arcturus commented while nodding his agreement that Silverclaw should take the letter.
He reached across the altar to Harry, linking their hands together. Not just palms pressed together this time. No, they laced their fingers together, braced their feet and pushed hard against each other, determined not to be dislodged this time.
Words spluttered out, leaving Harry red-faced and furious and flailing his hands like Uncle Vernon when his face went purple with rage at something Harry had done. Hopefully, his face wasn't purple like that. It would be so embarrassing.
"All pictures," Harry said, still bright red. "Moving pictures. I mean, paintings, not picture-pictures. You know what I mean."
Draco snorted and nodded, slowly, cautiously, sliding his arms around Harry's waist. He squeaked when Harry hugged him tightly. Being really hugged, good firm bearhug-hugged, felt so very strange through the bond.
"All right, point taken," Draco said with a sigh that came right from his toes. "Our bond was behaving differently after the charms and control spells were removed. Its not much of a stretch to think that removing the blessing caused things to get unbalanced, too."
"I think he's functionally illiterate," Harry said. He winced when Draco opened both eyes and sat up again. "I mean, he can read. Kind of? It's hard for him. I get the impression that he had to sound everything out and he traces every line as he reads it as if the words are going to escape off the edge of the page."
"Control me?" Remus asked. He cocked his head to the side, blinking rapidly. "He could certainly rifle through my memories but only if he's staring straight in my eyes. I rarely allow him to do that."
"Knock it off, Ron," Harry said. The Keep rumbled around them all. "This is my home. These are my wards that respond to me. You'll shut up about Draco, Slytherin and everything else like that or I'll eject you from the Keep and forbid you from ever returning. That goes for you, too, Hermione! Knock it off!"
He turned to Professor McGonagall who looked up from the letter from Grandpa Arcturus that she was proofreading and extensively editing, much to Grandpa Arcturus' outrage. Apparently, he didn't like the way Professor McGonagall all but graded his efforts.
Thought he asked. Maybe he asked? He couldn't tell. He didn't even know who he was asking because there wasn't really anyone there. Just him and the warm, wonderful sea of magic stars that held and supported and flowed right through him.
