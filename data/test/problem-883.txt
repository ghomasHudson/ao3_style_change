Tears started filling his eyes as he used one finger to trace a scare that crossed right over Draco’s frantically beating heart.
He closed the door softly and leaned back on it while Potter turned around to look at him.
Trying to keep his hands where Harry left them once the man resumed kissing and sucking Draco’s body was so difficult Draco considered for a few seconds to just let Harry restrain him, after all it’s not something they haven't done before.
A sudden pop was heard behind him in the room and startled him out of his thoughts, he instinctively drew out his wand to defend himself as he turned to the intruder.
Harry took the bottle in his hands and looked straight at Draco, “Malfoy truth or dare?” he said in a steady voice.
“Touch me” he whispered against Draco’s lips.
Harry moved forward until he was just a few inches away from Draco, He moved his hands to the front of the man's shirt, all the while looking straight into his eyes. When Draco didn’t object, or made any move to push Harry away He started unbuttoning his shirt, slowelly, one at a time, until the shirt was open and Harry slid it off the pale shoulders it was resting on.
Draco thought he was going to pass out if Harry didn’t put his cock inside him soon. His own cock was throbbing, the head purple and a study stream of pre-cum coming out of it. The command he received from Harry to not touch himself led to him clenching his hands so tightly to the sheets he was surprised they hadn't torn up yet.
Harry took a few moments before replaying. “everyone keeps looking at me like I’m already dead. They don’t mean to, and they keep telling me how they believe in me and that I’m gonna be okay, but I can see it in their eyes. They’re scared, and as selfish as that is, I just can’t deal with it. Not tonight. Tonight I need to think about something else” Harry’s eyes traveled from Draco’s eyes to his lips and then back again “Or better yet, not to think at all”
Harry licked Draco’s button lip, as if asking for entrance which Draco gladly gave.
“I dare you to take off your shirt”
Draco kept quiet and waited for Harry to continue talking.
Harry heard Draco’s pleading and figured he had tortured his lover long enough and that it was time to move along, after all he was behaving so well. He moved up and kissed Draco softly, not letting the kiss become more intense.
“when you came into the tower I was sure that we were just going to snipe at each other like we always do.”
Harry came closer to the man in front of him until he was close enough to touch and whispered “I might”.
Draco felt Harry waking up, nuzzling his throat like a cat and then kissing it before lifting his head up to meet Draco’s eyes.
Draco leaned forward and softly pressed his lips to Harry’s.
After a few moments of lying still Draco signaled Harry that he was okay and he can keep going by moving his hip and making Harry slide in deeper. Harry pulled back a few inches before thrusting back in, building a slow and steady pace.
Draco looked at Pansy with a look that clearly stated that she was going to pay for this one later. “No” He said, reaching for his shot of whisky thanking Merlin and Granger for deciding that anyone can decline his dare or refuse to answer a truth in exchange for two shots.
“Don’t say anything. Anything you still have left to say you can tell me the next time you see me. Hopefully it wouldn't take another three months” Draco said with a tender smile before he stopped talking for a few seconds and lifted his gaze from the fingers that were placed on Harry’s lips to his eyes, “maybe it would even be as soon as the day after tomorrow?” he asked with a voice as steady as he could and eyes filled with longing to the man who has not even left his side yet.
“Don't be scared love, I’m right here, and I’m never going to be anywhere else”
“Dare”
Harry held tightly to Draco and vowed to himself at that moment that he would find a way to make it up to Draco. Whatever it takes, he will find a way to atone for what he did.
If he dies tomorrow then he wants to forever live in Draco’s mind.
Harry pushed slowly in and swallowed Draco’s moans with his lips.
Harry buried his face in Draco's neck while kept pulling in and out him slowly gaining speed. He buried himself bells deep every time he pushed in and made sure to brush Draco’s prostate with each thrust.
“But then you came over and sat in front of me. You had that look on your face like you weren't quite sure what you were doing or why”.
“Why won’t you take it off?”
Harry stood there for a few moments. Not moving any closer but just looking at the gorgeous man lying on the bed in front of him, just waiting to be taken. He felt honored and unworthy of the trust and want that he saw reflecting in the grey eyes that were watching him.
“You mean the night before your dragon task, back at 4th year.” Draco paused for a few seconds before continuing, “Of course I remember.”
“Potter I know you’re not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed but I assumed you at the very least knew how to play spin the bottle” Draco said with a smirk to his lips,trying to hide the feelings that were storming inside of him.
“Whatever Happens tomorrow, I want you to always remember that when it seemed like the world might be ending, you were the one I came to” Harry stopped and saw that Draco’s eyes were filled with unshed tears. “If this is to be my last night, never forget that you’re the one person I wanted to spend it with.”
Draco felt so good inside. He was hot and so tight and Harry wanted those moments to last forever.
Something in Potter's face that night made him want to protect him instead of fighting with him.
He squeezed Draco’s hip, “Please Draco, I need you.” he gazed deep into Draco’s eyes and saw the exact moment he once again gave himself over to Harry.
Harry lifted his gaze up and met Draco’s eyes “are you going to be good and keep your hands there or do i need to restrain you?”
“I love you too babe. So much it scares me sometimes” Draco whispered back.
“Oh come on Malfoy, is this about your dark mark? I mean we all know you have it and have seen it plenty of times. There's nothing to be ashamed of” Thomes said out loud, clearly very drunk.
He could feel Draco was close and wanted to see his face when he inevitably fell over the edge. He lifted his gaze up and murmured “open up your eyes for me love”.
“Don’t” Draco stopped him and placed his fingers gently on Harry's lips.
Draco seemed completely lost when he opened his eyes. He looked at Harry with so much lust and unspoken feelings it took Harry’s breath away.
Something big was coming. He could feel it in his bones, and it made him feel unsettled. He didn’t know where that feeling was coming from but he just couldn't seem to shake it off. Maybe he was finally losing his mind he thought sardonically while staring into the flames.
“Yeah.
“What the hell are you doing here?” Draco asked once he saw who the intruder was.
It took Harry a few more seconds before he mustered up the courage to actually look down and face what he had no doubt will be there. He took a shaky breath when he saw the thin scares covering the lean body in front of his.
Harry put on his clothes and then his shoes and then there was nothing left to do but leave.
He didn’t know what the future would bring, hell he didn’t even know if he was going to live past the next 12 hours or so, so Harry needed to make sure that whatever happens next, this night will be something Draco will never forget.
The rushing attempts had ended with Harry grabbing Draco’s wrists and pushing them to the mattress on either side of Draco’s head.
“Well, if you're going to fight the dark lord tomorrow than that means there's a good chance tonight is your last night” Draco said while staring at the man standing in front of him, the one that was talking about taking down of of the most powerful wizards in the world as if he was talking about something as simple as the weather. “You might die tomorrow.” He continued in a much softer voice.
Draco hated thinking about the many times in which he almost lost Harry, of course in the past he couldn't be so upfront about it.
“I love you so much my prince” Harry whispered close to Draco’s lips,
Harry placed his right hand on Draco’s hip, “I know what we agreed on, but I haven't seen you in three months. I… I’ve missed you'' Harry whispered against his lips, not quite touching them. He never did until the moment He sees the surrender in Draco's eyes.
Draco started lowering his wand, of course he knew Potter wasn't going to hurt him, he never even got over the bathroom incident last year. “That's not an answer,” he said angrily. “We agreed you wouldn't come here again. It's too dangerous. For you as well as for me” he said in a quieter, gentler voice.
Draco pulled the dark haired boy closer to him and let him bury his tears covered face in his neck, “I know you are, Harry. I know, it’s okay” he tried to soothe him.
Draco watched him get up and dressed and a cold shiver went through his body now that he didn’t have Harry’s warmth in bed with him.
He knew he had to hurry up or he wouldn't make it so Harry pushed the first finger inside moving it slowly in and out of Draco’s body.
“I don't know,” He whispered. “The weather probably.”
Draco took advantage of Harry being distracted and made himself busy moving his lips to kiss Harry's jaw, then down his neck and from there to the tender spot behind Harry’s ear. The one that Draco knew made Harry weak in the knees.
“Everything is going to end tomorrow. The final battle. I have done everything i could do in order to prepare, and now all that's left to do is kill him”
Harry on the other hand thought that that one small touch was enough for now and continued on his journey down Draco’s buddy. He knew That Draco's inner thighs were extra sensitive and used that knowledge to his advantage by sucking love bites to the area.
“My god, you’re stunning,” Harry said as he caressed Draco’s body before moving down, spreading Draco’s legs and settling between them. He leaned forward, pressed a kiss between Draco’s shoulder blades and then licked his way down, not stopping until he reached the bottom of Draco’s spine.
“Harry-”
They both knew that Draco wouldn't deny Harry. He never did.
He climbed up the bed and positioned himself above the blond man, resting his legs between Draco’s and his right hand at the side of Draco’s head. Harry took his other hand and placed it softly at Draco's face with his thumb below Draco’s chin.
He turned around to look at the man he wanted nothing more than to stay here with and felt an ache in his chest. Draco was so beautiful it was almost blinding to watch, and if Harry dies tomorrow then at least he would die knowing what true beauty was.
“Ha ha, you’re hilarious” Draco tried saying in a dry voice but couldn't seem to help the smile that was trying to break through. ”What made you think about that night all of a sudden? Draco asked while resting his head back where it belonged above Harry’s heart beat and resumed his earlier task of caressing Harry's chest.
A soft moan escaped Harry’s lips when he felt Draco’s kiss.
Harry placed a kiss to Draco’s back and turned him over while moving back up his body. He positioned himself between Draco’s bent knees, said the lubing spell he could do wandless by now, lined up his cock and rested his forehead to Deaco’s.
It was a cold and stormy night and Harry and Draco were lying on Harry’s bed in Harry’s private dorm room.
“Right then. I think I’m done for tonight” Harry said in a small hurried voice before dashing out of the room.
Harry loved this part. Opening Draco using his tongue and feeling how the tight ring of mussels loosens little by little ‘till he can push inside and lick from within. Harry was so turned up by this point he knew he could come from doing this alone. But this wasn't what he wanted. Not tonight. Tonight he wanted to finish while buried deep inside the man he had spent the last three months thinking about.
“All that’s left? You say it like it’s nothing, like it’s going to be easy” Draco said while looking baffled by Potter’s casualness to the whole thing. how could he say that he's going to kill the dark lord tomorrow and be so cool about it? Potter truly never ceases to amaze him.
He let go of the panting man that was below him and moved a little to the side so as to give Draco room to get in the position they were both so familiar with by now.
“You mean when we met at Madam Malkin’s and I was being the world’s biggest prat? how could i ever forget” Draco replied in a quiet and amused voice.
Draco downed the first one and immediately refilled to take the second one.
Eventually they both confessed their feelings for one another and became a proper couple. The letter only happened a couple of months ago.
He got out of bed and put on his silk rube. He couldn't stand it laying there all casual and naked in front of Harry like everything was just fine and normal while the man was about to go to war.
Harry’s words were Draco’s undoing. He came so hard his entire body arched and his toes curled painfully. He grabbed Harry’s face in his hand and pulled him down for a bruising kiss. He could feel Harry coming inside of him which only prolonged his orgazam and Draco thought he might pass out from the over sensation.
Harry gave Draco something he desperately needed, Someone he could willingly submit to so that he could have the strength to keep up the pretence of submitting to the dark lord. And in turn, Draco gave Harry something he also desperately needed. An escape. A person he could come to. Whether it was to confess his fears and hopes or to lose himself in Draco’s body so as not to think of anything at all, Draco was there.
Of course the reason they were given private rooms in the first place was that so few of them decided to even come back.
Harry started running his fingers through Draco’s silky hair and after several moments opened his mouth again “i wasn't even supposed to be there that night but i just couldn't fall asleep so i started wandering off. I somehow ended up up in the astronomy tower” Harry murmured.
“Shut up” Harry said while pulling lightly on Draco’s hair and making him shiver,
Draco lifted his head once more and looked at Harry’s handsome face once more, “I'm really glad you didn’t die that day. Or any other day for that matter, Merlin knows you had more than a few close calls.”
“I don’t want to say so i guess i’ll just take a couple more shots. Thank you so very much for that Potter” he replied in a sarcastic voice.
The feeling of Draco’s hand filled him with emotions he knew he couldn't afford to deal with at the moment.
‘What on earth are you talking about?’, sighed Harry. ‘We’ve got the muggles high on cold medicine, we’ve got you, and we’ve got your stash that we found on you while you were selling a bottle to an undercover auror. We do have proof, what else do you want me to say?’
‘Now, I didn’t know if you’d ever go away with me. I wasn’t sure at all, actually. But every time we find ourselves in this predicament, you grow a little more tired of your job and a little less distant with me. I am not going to pretend to be a bodice-ripping heroine, I know you won’t sweep me off my feet and make it all better. Still I think there’s no one in this world that can understand our shit better than me yours and you mine. And you called me Draco. So, I like my odds.’
‘What is this all about, Draco?’
‘You have no proof’, cut Malfoy casually. Harry looked at him for a while in silence.
Nobody in the DMLE wanted to have to deal with Draco Lucius Malfoy.
‘Not getting much sleep, trainee auror Potter?’, asked Malfoy with the same annoying faux naive tone of voice. Harry simply grunted. After a while, he felt a finger poking his head. He looked up to find Malfoy mirroring his pose, stretched across the table to be at Harry’s eye level. Harry didn’t bother to straighten up.
So he had told him.
‘Uhm… Somewhere that looks nothing like Scotland, London of Whiltshire’
‘You have no proof’, declared Malfoy to the empty room for the umptenth time. He looked like he was having a ball.
From the bullpen, watching the scene through a charm, Harry had his face covered, concealing both his sleepiness and his second hand embarrassment. Malfoy was wearing expensive muggle clothes and he looked like he had been at a party or two. He was charged with selling pepper-ups to non-magical individuals, under the guise of recreational drugs. Just like his previous offences, enough for a reprimand but not for a sentence. Huffing and puffing, Harry headed to the interrogation room.
- Harry Potter on his knees, figuring out how to properly suck him off - and Draco was embarrassingly close to the edge.
And he could be. For Harry fucking Potter, he could be brave.
Draco snorted. It almost hurt his pride, in that ridiculously blind loyalty one has to their House, that, after so much talk of safety and discretion, the Slytherin dungeon had been broken into by a couple of kids.
‘You know, Potter, I-’
Harry laughed. His eyes flickered up to meet Draco's, his tone soft.
It was ordinary Wizard’s brew and it sunk warmly in his throat. He watched Ron out the corner of his eye, half expecting to see some miniature lion or some kind of ethereal mane around him. There was nothing.
Draco kissed her cheek, primly ignored the smirk she gave him, and walked to the other table. They were all quite drunk, speaking too loudly, too incoherently, but he still felt unsure as she approached the group. They could look at him, after all, and remember all he’d been. All he still was, that they’d always hated.
‘Were you under the impression we
. And loving Harry had always been so painful. The most pressing, inescapable reminder that something was irremediably wrong with him. And he could try to forget that now, now that Harry smiled back at him and there was some unbelievable glint of tenderness in his future, but Ron remembered.
‘Don’t ever call me that in public again, you git.’
'Don't you know where it is? You have been here, after all,' Draco drawled, all feigned lightheartedness, like he felt no urgency, no
- to wear as little clothes as possible. He hadn’t expected Harry to make him wait in the freezing fucking halls.
‘I didn’t think I
‘Did you
thing. Harry was a fucking idiot - he would have killed himself, and Draco had
Draco pulled away, drool dribbling down his chin. Some of the lipstick he’d gotten from kissing Harry was now smeared around Harry’s rim, colouring it even redder, the most obscene fucking sight Draco had ever seen. He kissed Harry’s arse right over one of the fresh bruises, a debauched kiss slick with saliva.
'Prove it,' Harry said, eyes lit with heated dare.
‘No.’
The man inside the loo went tumbling out. Both him and Potter stared at the open door for a moment.
He went in.
‘You have fans. Not much different from minions.’
Aaaaand the posting schedule has hereby changed to Wednesday and Sunday, because quarantine is a thing and we're all here looking for a distraction.
‘Well, you didn’t quite manage that. Showed me you’re daft, though.’
the vodka was much more intense.’
Honestly, love was incredibly inconvenient. It made him want to
He wouldn’t change a thing about them, in all truth - not their first kiss, not their first date, not the years he’d spent pining. No, he wouldn’t change one detail in their middle, not the cruelty nor the yearning, because in this moment, with Harry’s smile so intimate and genuine for him, he knew at once that he’d gotten the perfect ending.
Harry didn’t even look at him; his gaze was very intent on some spot below them. It gave Draco the familiar itch to get his attention. He insisted, ‘Surely you’re tired. I’m tired.’
Harry - never had there been a more exhausting person to love.
'Oh, you're a fucking arsehole, Malfoy,' Harry said, but the angry tone was undercut by a laugh, then a downright sinful sound as Draco took his dick further in his mouth.
Because he did, and Draco
‘What is it with the questions, Weasley? Why on earth would I be with Potter?’ he asked, a bit sharp in the implicit dare for Ron to put it into words.
It made him feel twistedly proud, that she and her perfectly decent but unremarkable mouth hadn't been the first to give Harry a blowjob.
‘We came outside just two minutes ago.’
‘Your mind wanders to the strangest places,’ Draco snorted, impatient, searching Harry’s lips again.
‘Did he tell you that?’
'Yes, I'm aware.'
‘I did say I wanted to focus.’
He took a deep breath, clenched his teeth until it hurt, a nicely grounding pain, and set out on quickly doing Harry's underwear and jeans up. He wouldn't beg Harry to stay only to see him leave. He'd take care of him, tuck him back in, straighten his clothes - because the Harry inside that stall was still his at least - and then let him go out and forget him.
"Like the fact that I love you."
That was Harry's best Christmas, used to having no one but Ron and Hermione. Blaise's home was very beautiful: the entrance was spacious and bright and opened onto a large living room, with elegant colours, enhanced by Christmas decorations. On the right there was a black marble staircase leading to the rooms. Single or double, each one had a dominant color and all overlooked the magnificent garden, the fountain and the many colored flower beds. They spent the days that separated them from Christmas, staying at home, enjoying the beautiful house, or going out, to drink a Butterbeer or, for girls, go shopping. On Christmas Eve, they had lunch early and soon after the girls went to get ready, which caused the shock of the boys, that followed them only 3 hours later.
"It's pretty obvious, isn't it?" She said, with her dreamy voice.
"And you with the ferret?" ask Ron asked him, with the expectation of a great story.
They started working and after a few seconds Malfoy shot "Don't! Sorry, the potion doesn’t need a broken dragon claw, I thought that at your old age you knew how to read. Give me this knife."
They went in the kitchen and saw that it was set for nine people, one more than those present. With a smile, disfigured by the melancholy, thay looked at the plate and the field flowers next to him, probably Ginny's work. They sat and, as always, were filled by Mrs Weasley's food
Ron and Hermione were still asleep, hugged, Harry saw. It had been months since he had seen Voldemort’s body lying dead on the ground, as that of Lupin and Tonks and Fred. Mrs Weasley was still having nightmares, especially since the time she found the boggart in Ginny’s closet. However, they were all confident that they could heal those wounds, that they could return to normal life, maybe. Anyway, the ones that were worse were the three of them. They had wounds that couldn't be healed: an abduction, a torture and, well... Harry was just Harry. Ron, every night, woke up to look for his girlfriend next to him, Hermione often had panic attacks and Harry had always this orrible nightmare. He woke up scared, hurted by his own past memories. When he closed his eyes they were there, the bodies of his loved ones, dead. He lost so much in his life, he often wondered how he could wake up every morning. He kept telling himself that he had to be strong, because Ron had Hermione, but he had no one, or at least, no one like that. He and Ginny had broken up at the end of June, agreeing that there was only friendship between them, in fact they were like brother and sister.
"No, I’m going to throw him a Stunning Spell just after lunch" Answered casually Draco.
"Can we talk?" He asked them one night. "In private?"
While they were talking Draco came downstairs "Hi, sorry, I have to go to Theo and Pansy's house, she need my help with the baby, she is so tired"
"What do you know?" Draco snapped out.
"Relax, Ron had already wake me. Sometimes he snor so much..." said Hermione, almost in a wishper
"Guys, I think you have to give me my twenty galleons" Luna said to the Gryffondors.
"Walcome back, to those already familiar to Hogwarts, welcome to the others. As you all know well, this has been a place of great suffering, so I ask you to be respectful, but nevertheless I hope it will be for you a place of great goy and redemption. A lot of people fought for Hogwarts, so I expect wizards with potentialities to make them proud. That said, I warn the eighth year students that I want to spend with you two words, after the banquet."
"I knew it! I am so proud of you." He smiled, it made him happy to see Draco, only a part of him was enough.
The next afternoon, trying to predict his death for Trelawney, Harry told his friends about the previous night.  They look at him, almost in shock.
Harry looked at him eloquently and commented "Really? Do I have to remember you that, when Albus arrived, you were so tired that you gave him your coffee instead of the milk?"
Pansy simply hugged him" I missed my Draco"
The next morning, they all went to the Great Hall for breakfast angry, for one reason or another. Walking through the halls the students splitted to let them pass, as if they were a bunch of superheroes, driven by a particularly angry Neville.
After a few moment they burst out laughing. It was the best time he had shared with his friends, finally free.
"I love it. I love you. But I have one condition"
"Thank goodness you noticed it too, he didn't want to believe me". Now they were laughing together. It was nice to laugh, it made Harry feel free.
"Truce?"
Harry saw Nott and Finnigan discussing "It isn't my fault!" Shot Seamus.
Last ones, he saw Dean and Morag arguing about the existence of the football.
"Asshole" He was so angry, he had a lot of things to say.
"No, but I will say at Hermione that you find her smart"
Draco was already in the room when Harry arrived. He saw that he was expecting him.
"So, Weasley, I take the bed on the left" said Zabini, without even look at him.
They all burst out laughing.
Nobody moved.
One night, before go to bed, Harry said "But, Malfoy, we can't be friends"
And again.
"It doesn't matter, really." He smiled at him and Harry seemed to have seen some... Pain? They tightened the box for a few moments, then Draco left it, said "Merry Christmas" and left, leaving once again a void in Harry's chest.
"Guess what? Looks like Draco missed his first practice, but he still joined the team. Who knows how much he paid." Ron huffed. He felt guilty, it was him who spoke at Nott, the captain of the team. He had to tell them that too. Harry didn’t want to make Draco look like he was taking advantage of it again. Did he want to protect him? Once in the room, Harry told them before about the tryouts.
"A little? Mate, sometimes you scare me". They continued to talking (not about Ron, fortunately for him) until Molly called them for breakfast.
That night Harry was wearing an elegant dark green velvet suit, that highlighted his eyes. When he was ready, he left the room, but instead of going downstairs, he knocked on Draco’s door, because, since that night at Hogwarts, he was avoiding him. That silence was killing him. Hermione gave them suspicious looks, like the rest of the girls, even Luna, the most discreet. He didn't understand why he was so attracted to him. Hermione had suggested that it was the proximity to Draco and that, however, he had to solve these thins alone, because there was no book that could help him. She kept telling him that they wouldn’t care, but Harry’s problem was figuring out what she was talking about (even Ron didn’t seem to understand it, judging by the fact that he looked at her like she was an alien). Was it possible that he liked Draco? 'It must have been the moment', he repeated himself... but there was something...
"For one thing that I said the first night... She bring every night a different guy" Hermione was near hysteria. She couldn't read in peace... Because of the noise. She couldn't bring Ron, she couldn't stay alone in her room because of the the mess that Pansy made. "Such a messy girl" she hissed.
Anyway, Ron was the most shocked, even more than Blaise. Slughorn entered in the class and consigned the ingredients' list. Arrived at Hermione and Ron's table asked "Where's Harry?" Ron pointed, still puzzled, the table where Harry and Draco sat. "Oh" To Harry’s astonishment, the professor was even more surprised than the others.
Harry really don't understand. He tried to help him anyway: he had even offered him help with the DADA's tasks, with which Draco was in clear difficulty, but there was nothing to do.
"It's none of your business" She was tired of being derided.
"Guys! Want to sit with us?" proposed Neville.
"What an idiot. I wonder how I ended up being your friend"
"What a naughty girl" Huffed Hermione.
They laughed and then they went to sleep. 'Yeah', thought Harry, 'How we ended up being friend just now?'.
"I owe it to you. Thank you so much"
"I am so sorry, really. I didn't mean to hurt you in that way. I didn't know the spell, it said 'against the enemies' and so I thought that maybe... But you weren't a true enemy and I knew it... And I am very sorry" Harry didn't know what else to say... He had a lot of questions...
"Luna. She even told me where to find you."
"Potter! Open your eyes! I'm here, I'm Draco. Please, Potter, breathe with me, it was just a dream!" Harry woke up, but he still was in his nightmare... He still couldn't breathe...
"Well, I would say" commented Harry.
"You bet on my love life?" Harry was incredulous.
The evening passed quietly: they had fun, ate, drank (Pansy maybe a little too much). At midnight they made a toast and exchanged the gifts, which they would open the next morning. Completely unexpected, Draco handed his gift to Harry. It was a tiny box, covered in green paper, his favorite color.
"Well, of course." debuted Hermione, raising his head from the book "Don't you read the Prophet? His father went to Azkaban, then they fell into disgrace. He can only study and get a proper job. This year he will be there."
"We would Pansy with another boy" Ron pointed out.
"Come here, who is Daddy's love? No no, don't lick the photo" He whispered to a one-year-old Lily, who was licking the photo of Harry and Draco’s marriage.
"Do you mind if I brake your rules?" Harry asked ironically.
By the time, he saw Hannah and Luna: the Ravenclaw girl was about to say something when Hannah preceded her "Let me, Narvles?"
"Liar" He said, kissing Harry. "Goodmorning"
"N-No.." He was confused by what was happening.
"Potter" He called.
"Rules"
Now they were again in silence. They all know that Pansy was right. They just had to admit to themselves.
They entered in the room, looking at them, waiting for a reaction.
It was Ron.
"Yes?"
Now they were laughing. It was an idiot sometimes, but Harry had to admit that he was really funny. Anyway, they started study and between them reigned the silence for a while. When Harry conclused his Potions' essay, he gave it to Draco, who, after a few minutes, looked at him and said "What can I say, Potter?"
"Did you pack your bags?" Arthur asked them. They all nodded, so he, looking at the clock, sent them to dress up, because on September 1 there was always a big fuss at the Burrow.
Let the chaos begin.
"What a grace" wishpered Draco, smiling. Harry had never noticed the beauty of that smile. It was bright, genuine. It highlighted Draco’s elegant eyes. Draco was... God, with this hair, sprained and more naturale he was... Perfect. They might had looked at each other for too long, because Neville need to call them "Guys, is everything ok?"
"They’ll find out sooner or later." Draco answered, smiling.
Harry nodded frantically, and they rushed to the stall Draco had been in just a few minutes ago, when the world had seemed to be crashing down upon him. As soon as the flimsy lock clicked shut, Draco pushed Harry against the tiles, pressing their bodies together, drawing a long breath as he took in the situation.
Draco suppressed a smile. ‘By all means then, help me with my books.’
Draco let out a ragged breath.
He wondered if it'd be snowing the next time he went to Hogsmeade. If Pansy would still make him go if it was. If she'd actually force him to
He was watching the teams warm up, and trying to understand how was it that the Gryffindors, almost all of them hungover, were
‘We didn’t,’ Harry intervened. No, what they'd done at the Shrieking Shack couldn't be considered fucking. Draco reckoned it'd be more accurate to call it a cosmic test of his self-control.
‘Draco.’
'What the bloody hell, Potter?' he asked. How pitiful that his voice was so ragged after one kiss.
about the whole thing, like he was learning a new Quidditch technique or a strange hex, eyes twinkling in a mix of focus and excitement.
‘A present,’ he answered tersely, trying to squander his embarrassment.
Harry did his best to glare, though his eyes were glazed.
‘You hardly get like
'Merlin, Malfoy,' Harry moaned, his head hitting the wall, his throat convulsing so prettily from the angle Draco was seeing him.
It was worse in Charms class, as Draco could currently testify. In Charms, the tables were all close. Harry's back pressed against the edge of his table, and sometimes Draco would catch bits of what he told Weasley: some were ridiculously stupid, others actually funny, and it invariably made Draco wish he could tap Potter's shoulder and get his attention; answer him himself, maybe even be the recipient of Potter's little whispers.
The slight tone of complaint there - and that despicable word, so diminishing in its casualness, ‘mate’, sounding in Draco’s ears like a taunt - made Draco inch away. He hovered over Harry, taking a good look at him, searching for any sign of reluctance in his wild eyes.
‘Of course I do, I’m not a savage.’
Harry’s laugh was a gentle, ticklish thing against his chest. ‘Yeah, alright. Sob quietly, would you?’
hip and gripped a little tighter, inched a little closer. Harry, on his part, was looking around with wild eyes, a hand unsure on Draco’s upper arm.
‘Oh, Merlin, you did something to me, didn’t you? Did you hex me, Potter?’ he asked, because there was something shameful in Harry’s eyes, something that told him there was
‘You’re not serious, then. Not about all of it, at least - you’re not paying for the whole thing.’
Harry withdrew with an obscene, wet sound. He seemed to be holding in the urge to laugh, a smile teasing his lips.
It couldn’t have been that much. They’d arrived at Hogsmeade at the same time, after all.Then again, Draco had seen, on the nights where he’d spied the drunk, stumbling group around Hogsmeade, that Potter had the habit of getting too enthusiastic with shots - he’d make a point of drinking one with every friend, a brief special moment with each one, the two leaning close over the bar and whispering and smiling soft smiles before returning to the crowd, and because Potter knew
have, I got it from watching you play heroes all the bloody time.’
‘What is this, then?’ said Nearly Headless Nick. ‘What is this? Harry, you’re here with them? I didn’t know you were friends!’ the ghost twirled to the center of them, hovering just above the ground, his head bobbing perilously. ‘Marvelous to have you, regardless! I do apologize I never told you, but the Equinox Ball is quite the private thing between us… undead. Already strange enough to have these here every year,’ he tapped Draco’s shoulder cheerfully, his hand swiping right through the skin and disappearing inside him. It felt dreadfully cold, but Draco wouldn’t complain - the distraction had been welcome.
‘No, we didn’t hex you,’ Harry snorted, ‘Why the fuck would we do that?’
Draco hummed, smoothing his hands down Harry’s sides and pretending he wasn’t incredibly embarrassed.
‘After. I asked first.’
how he felt. Instead, with every step he took forward, his hesitante ebbed, and a sudden fury grew, a crushing wave of tension and rage, like she now incarnated Harry’s stubbornness on the field.
Potions before, but it was quickly sorted, and shortly they were putting the brew on a low simmer to help dissolve the powdered castor teeth.
him to lead the way, and he had half a mind to lace an arm around Potter’s waist instead, just to keep him upright - maybe to see how their bodies would mold together -, but he didn’t have the
Potter straightened at once, shook his head a little as if the position didn’t suit him, and then promptly toppled towards Draco, head hitting his shoulder, their sides impossibly squeezed together in the narrow stairwell. It almost felt indecent; Draco could feel the beginnings of a blush prickling his skin, all because Potter was leaning against him, linking arms with him,
There was one brief moment when Hermione’s expression cleared into something soft - Draco figured she must be seeing him as one sees a small animal crossing a busy street, all raw vulnerability and pitiful naivety, charming only in its potential for tragedy.
'You know, you really do lose your charm when you drink,' he said dryly, eyeing her with one arched brow; but Pansy simply smiled, the dark shimmer on her face glowing emerald green, and glanced towards the corner of the pub again.
‘What on earth was that about?’ asked Dean, at the same time as Finnigan said ‘That was a lot more than one question.’
‘I- Yes, as a matter of fact.’
exactly?'
Hermione, meanwhile, neared them, licking her lips in distaste. ‘Ready to go?’
Draco sighed, tempted to persist on his lie, no matter how flimsy, simply because it was habit. Then again, that same fact, the idea that he'd never been open about it, prompted him some unruly honesty:
in the middle of something the other night, weren’t we?’
‘Thanks,’ Harry’s smile was crooked; he dropped a hand to squeeze Ron’s shoulder warmly while the other took the glass. It made for a heady sight, seeing Harry’s Adam’s apple bob while fully knowing what that throat had been doing just a moment ago. ‘D’you think there’s any other chairs we can steal?’
Pain thrummed inside Draco; a clench of muscle, a high-pitched agony. He stared at the stone walls, the reckless tower of bottles behind the bar, the round Adam's apple of some stranger quivering as he finished his drink in a succession of inelegant gulps - everywhere except Pansy's eyes, who seemed now, with the dim, red lighting of the pub, bottomless black.
'I remember you came quite fast last time. I'd certainly consider that flattering,' he whispered, a hint of mischief in his tone, and then, just to tease
Harry eyed him darkly, not faltering in the slightest.
this time, hungry pressure and a seeking tongue, a wicked bite that made Harry wince away.
‘I’m sorry?’
He looked around, but saw no one from Harry’s group.
him then, and he was so close to confessing it again, whispering it warm and desperate in his ear, so in its place he said, ‘Then again, perhaps it was best Dean was the one to invite me. Because he told me all about your little
And it felt like a confession, weighed in the air like one, scarred his conscience like one, and he suddenly thought that he’d said too much - because he’d never said
‘I love you, Harry. Now try to sleep, and don’t look up at me.’
around his eyes, red, yellow, orange, golden - thick on his eyelids, quirking towards his temples, Phoenix wings like fire on his pale skin, neon bright and hypnotizing and
Harry stepped in front of Draco. His slight fidgeting had ebbed; instead, his figure had filled with a sort of humoured confidence. It rather suited him. Then again, what didn’t?
Instinctively, he would have answered Harry; if he thought about it objectively, he would have gone with Hermione. But he didn’t want to mention her, didn’t want to be reminded of their conversation, so he just shrugged.
‘Terribly so.’
‘I didn’t.’
Perhaps it wouldn’t be such a bad thing to go back to Hogwarts: he could make some tea and lay down in the refreshing coolness of the dungeons. Besides, Hermione and Neville were hardly bad company. They were actually two of the most bearable of the group. It’d be much more pleasant than hanging around the Three Broomsticks with a head made of lead and that fucking ungodly absinthe swirling in his bloodstream. But then came Pansy’s words, all sharp and firm, waking the same hissing voice inside him that had controlled him in that Quidditch game so many days ago - he couldn’t quite leave Harry there alone, could he? He’d drink so much, most likely stay with his friends until dawn, and with Hermione gone there wouldn’t be many responsible people there to guide the group. What if they got into some drunken fight? Drank too much and went into some sort of fit? Went back to the Shrieking Shack and fell down those decrepit stairs? Really, Draco could be feeling a little - incredibly - sick, but he still had a sense of restraint the Gryffindors lacked. He could help if he stayed - certainly help more than if he didn’t.
They dissolved into laughter again. Draco stared absently at the restless way Harry's fingers thrummed over Ron's shoulder. He wondered if they'd slept at all. If they ever slept, or if they just ran along the castle, hyped on coffee and alcohol and Honeydukes candy, doing all the childish things they hadn't had the chance to do before the end of the war.
fucking boyfriend.’
‘Does he? Ron and I thought he’d been getting better. Do you know Leanne? Harry was talking of asking her out.’
Draco nodded. He wanted to laugh, something high and hysterical, something insane, because he knew it was: his sight still swayed from time to time, his head still pulsed, he was freezing in the thin shirt of his uniform, and he’d had the hardest time going up the Great Staircase without feeling nauseous. He couldn’t fly, he knew that - but he also knew Harry was feeling as poorly as he was. It was obvious in the way his head rested unstable on his neck, and his gaze flickered wildly from side to side, and his steps were slow and measured. He was faking it with smiles, but if anyone really looked, it was just under the surface. He’d hurt himself. He’d fall. If Draco played, if he was there, he could help.
'Well, hurry up, doll, I've been looking everywhere for you.'
It wasn’t the incontestable truth, nor obvious dishonesty.
This feeling of inadequacy only lasted so long. Hermione, not making any mention of his sudden appearance, handed him a bottle of Wizard’s Brew to place over his bruising cheek. Sue complimented Finnigan’s technique, someone else asked her what she was on about, the story spread. Spinnet asked him if it hurt, Draco answered ‘Of course it bloody hurts,’ and his voice echoed so clearly that it was impossible for anyone to have missed it. They knew he was there. He faded back into silence, but their words weren’t blurry any longer. He was no passerby.
‘You have a scar, Neville?’
'Flitwick will ask. He asks about fucking
‘And you’re the only one allowed to try and fix mine,’ he whispered, soft words lost in Draco’s mouth, welling in his heart. That, more than anything else, as they swept across the hall in each other’s arms, felt like a promise.
‘I’m being
lighter fluid spreading wildfires to his stomach, and Draco could hardly believe that Harry drank it that often, that he seemed downright
‘You’re a bloody fool, you know that?’ he said, stretching his hand to present him his umbrella.
‘Does Harry?’ he asked at last, just to hear it, just to know more. The name - ‘Harry’, not ‘Potter’ - sounded too soft and too vulnerable coming from his mouth.
happiness. The type of joy he got for foolish things that meant nothing at all, little tokens he’d keep in self-indulgence, signs that Harry might not be truly his but at least he wasn’t someone else’s yet. He didn’t know anyone’s touch, wasn’t hiding some affair with someone, couldn’t picture anyone in vivid detail. It wasn’t much - it wasn’t anything, really - but it felt
'Fuck,' Harry moaned.
Harry's blink was sticky slow.
'The secret ghost ball was more than enough as a distraction, really. Besides,' he closed the distance with a slow smile, arms looping around Draco's neck. 'You more than make up for it.'
Ron’s eyes were stale and unfriendly when they found him. At least
When Harry’s laughter subsided, Draco asked, a knot in his throat, ‘Are you mad?’
‘Good first time?’
‘It’s bloody not,’ he pressed a small black bag against Draco’s chest. ‘Get me the- the gold shit, you’ll know it when you find it.’
'What would you have had me do, then?' he asked absently, his eyes flittering around the Great Hall. The institutionalized habit of house-designated tables had mostly crumbled since the beginning of the year - friends sat with friends, independently of house, which meant Potter was much more difficult to pin these days: Draco had seen him sitting in every corner of the Hall by now - all except Draco's table, which remained still nearly exclusively Slytherin.
Everyone’s eyes flickered up to him. He pointedly ignored Hermione’s - he had yet to apologize to her - and stepped even closer to the scratched-up table. There was a gathering of cups at the center of it already.
‘Good of you to say.’
, he couldn’t discern what he wanted to hear. What he should say.
‘Don’t be absurd,' Blaise huffed. ‘The corners here are nasty.’
; he wanted to talk about what the actual hell the other night had meant.
'A game,'  Harry said simply, but his smile was lopsided, secretive. In any sense, a game involving veritaserum sounded dangerous - Draco had always cherished his ability to lie.
‘Well, the game’s all about telling the truth.’
Finnigan was waiting for him by the door. They exited together.
‘Wonderful.’
And Draco, who’d been nurturing those words under his tongue for years, felt, as he spoke them properly for the first time, as if he was taking his first full breath in that school.
'I'm sure you can feel the answer to that.'
sake, will you stop caring about other people for once?’ he shouted. His sight swung, and in a blur he saw Ginny’s and Ron’s unimpressed expressions, and Harry, still uncaring, still regarding everyone else’s life as more
‘How on earth do you remember that?’
‘I don’t think I can,’ he sighed.
‘Fancy a beer, mate?’
Harry just nodded against his shoulder, more focused on following Draco's touch. At this point, Draco had to keep a vice like grip on his hip with his free hand to make sure he didn't topple off the sink.

Harry's words, as well as the little smirk that came with them, pulled Draco away from his thoughts.
No. Discomfort brought by pessimism. Draco had pined for years, and he was used to the frustration of unrequited love. But he was
'Yes.'
, which was now taking on obscenely graphic contours and sounds in Draco’s mind.
‘Do I look it?’
The group had decided to find a comfortable spot at the Three Broomsticks. When they were halfway there, however, Harry halted, yanking at Draco’s arm, and spoke loud enough most of them could hear:
From the armchair came the low rumble of Goyle’s laugh. He was bouncing his knee up and down, foot skidding on the floorboards with a persistent, infuriating squeak; all pent up energy, like he always was before Quidditch practices. Were Draco capable of it, he would have thrown him one of the silver laced pillows.
‘For Merlin’s sake,' Draco sighed, trying to balance out the flush he felt on his skin, ‘I said I wanted to make you smile - that
Draco huffed, an eyebrow raised in impatience.
‘Are you tired?’
Idly, in the logic side of his mind, he was sure Harry was doing this because he was drunk, and that he should stop this. As it was, he'd never felt happier in his life, so he just clamped his hand down harder on the back of Harry's neck - and
And then he had Draco's cock in his hand, twitchy fingers stroking it firmly, fingertips grazing his balls - and he angled it just right, gripping the base and taking the head into his mouth to suckle on it for a couple of seconds before he was venturing further, opening wider, welcoming half of Draco's cock inside.
‘No, I’m just fucking with you,’ Harry snorted. ‘Of course I mean it.’
for me?'
He was unsure of the etiquette, which was foolish. Draco knew Harry genuinely needed that lesson - it wasn’t a cover for anything obscene. Then again, the simple notion of helping Harry, innocent and brief as it was, brought him just as much anxiety.
‘You were.’
Blaise simply rolled his eyes.
it that your dates get here?’ urged Blaise. It was the third time he repeated the question - his tone grew more and more petulant by the second.
fucked it up.’
'Draco,' Harry hissed, and now he was just pulling at Draco's hair, the vicious twat, trying to get his attention.
‘What sweets do you like, then?’
‘I could tell you the same thing,’ Draco scoffed. ‘Don’t do anything stupid. For Merlin’s sake, keep yourself alive.
‘I’ve the faintest as to why you’re so beaten up about this. Better he fell low than high.’
Meanwhile, in the game a new round of firewhiskey had been ordered, and an awfully embarrassing question must have been asked, since half of the table was either blushing or choking on hurried sips of their drink, but Draco really didn’t care what it had been. He turned his attention to Sue, whose bronze-charmed hair and electric blue lipstick easily branded her a Ravenclaw.
It was ridiculous. It was the kind of thing that didn’t actually happen. He was flush with Harry’s arse, he was inside Harry, it felt bloody perfect, he wanted to
; for one sudden, heady moment, Harry reciprocating that blowjob.  They swirled almost simultaneously, and culminated in this very vague, overwhelming wish to see him, so he withstood her piercing gaze with one nonplussed eyebrow raised, and it was her, in the end, that broke the impasse.
, so he tried to strike a conversation again:
‘I think so, yeah.’
‘Fuck yeah,’ Sue nodded, ‘Drink up, Malfoy.’
'Thanks,' Harry said, quick though genuine. His mind was clearly elsewhere. Draco's was as well: already tangling in his sheets.
'It's alright, I don't like some of your friends either,' Draco replied with a smirk. 'Did you like your date?'
Pansy’s smile grew wide and feline:
‘Pansy,’ Draco sighed, staring morosely at his brew, I might have actually hurt him.’
But Harry didn’t seem to be listening. His gaze was raking over Draco worriedly. Just under his eyebrows there was still the slightest hint of unwashed glitter, sticking to the tender skin, and Draco had a disturbing flash of the bathroom stall, and jutted hips shaking, and Harry’s breathy tone as he’d whispered Draco’s name.
As it was, Draco simply hummed around the abused nipple, catching it very gently between his teeth and flicking it with his tongue. The noise Harry made was wrecked, his hips trying to move under Draco's weight. Really, it ought to be quite frustrating - at least Draco got to grind his hard dick against the mattress. Draco didn't let up, however; the point of this, after all, was to make Harry
‘Trauma hardly works that way.’
'I had that man fired in third grade.'
Draco sent him a half-hearted glare, still fussing with his clothes.
Draco glared. ‘You’re a bloody tosser, Potter,’ he said, prying the bottle off Harry’s fingers and forcing himself to take a big gulp. By this point, he was hoping he wouldn’t remember this night at all when he woke up the next morning.
Draco could feel his face heat - inexplicably, really - and he looked down at last, picking up his books.
‘How long has this been going on for, then?’
‘You three are bloody wretched friends, you know that?’ he snapped, and stood up. His head pounded; the field in front of him swayed from side to the side.
‘I didn’t!’
Contrary to how it might look, this is not going to unleash 20.000 words of angst or some shit, so no one worry, fluff is imminent!
his name, loud and unashamed like he didn't care who heard.
of Harry's words: "of course", like he had no objection to calling out Malfoy's name, like he wasn't ashamed or repulsed, that made Draco melt. He never thought he'd get to
In the end, the opportunity to find out about the test came to him under the form of one blind mess of limbs.
He stepped back gingerly so Finnigan couldn’t see him. Outside, there was laughter.

- bloody hell, would you fucking… these buttons are fucking sewn on…’ Harry complained. Draco snorted and took his shirt off over his head. The cold air prickled at his bare skin; Harry’s hands were impossibly hot. ‘Anyways- here, yeah?’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Finally, mate, we thought you two had run off. D’you want a drink? It’s the american stuff you like.’
‘I don’t give a shit about Weasley,’ Draco snapped, ‘He’s
Ron stared at him for a long while. The smile he drew at least was tired, but thankfully genuine.
‘Yes. Yes,’ Draco nodded somewhat morosely, ‘It’s lovely, Lovegood. Luna.’
knew, and he could only last five seconds in that tense,
‘Well, I can’t very well go get it, can I? Hand it over.’
Draco very decidedly stared at the bartop. ‘I’m observant.’
And the smile grew, faltered just shy of friendly, and then he was turning back to the greenhouse.
'I do sometimes,' he sucked a patch of skin below Harry's collar, 'when there's better things to do.'
'Where does he go, Draco?'
‘Not if the bar is full. Oy, hey, yeah, it’s ten - fuck, twelve, is it? Twelve firewhiskeys, like, in glasses. Drinks, I mean, not shots.’
to Potter, all in the name of her preposterous misconception that Draco wanted to date him - as if that could ever be possible.
‘And miss our dear Draco drooling over-’
He turned back to the mirror, bending over the sink so he could better check the colourful shimmer. It was a good image; Draco could live with it, fold it neatly in his archive - Harry in that dim bathroom, turning away from him, phoenix glitter on his eyes. The last memory of their strange, brief friendship. It was the perfect time to leave.
‘Oh, I will,’ Draco hummed, catching Harry’s chin to angle it up. ‘You’re going to look bloody
‘He’s giving us
‘It’s basically alcohol.’
Ron took a step closer, suffocatingly close. He seemed quite capable of throwing Draco out the platform in that moment. Or perhaps Draco would fall on his own. His head hurt, he was reeling, balance was lost.
‘Sod off, Malfoy.’
‘To show you that I wasn’t uptight.’
But he simply couldn't go. He wouldn't be able to stand it. All those people stumbling in the snow, cheeks flushed and robes ruffled; all that aimless happiness that had no place for him.
‘You don’t. And I don’t belong in the ladies’ bathroom, but I can still make friends with them,’ Harry mused. ‘Look, Hermione and Neville helped you back to the dungeons last night. Ron let you in here, no matter how much shit he gave you for it.
, verging on the side of him that loved the thrill of a dare, the unpredictability of it. Oh, and he had to say yes, he had to, for Draco would never be able to shake off the picture of him with red stained lips regardless, and it’d be much better for his day to day focus if he could actually
The bartender poured a transparent fluid into the little glasses. Draco eyed it skeptically.
- where had Potter unearthed it from? -, an innocent question, Granger’s reliable passion for monologues, and all his friends knew just enough to make it through. Passive help. Ridiculously obvious; ridiculously devoid of proof. Just enough to look into Draco’s eyes and very proudly say he hadn’t told a soul.
‘I think they might have,’ he smirked. ‘Let’s hope so, at least.’
‘Is this Muggle, then?’
‘Yes, but I hardly expected you to take me up on it,’ Draco replied in a disbelieving tone.
Draco’s laugh was fond. ‘You really need that door, don’t you?’
There was a pause as Harry mulled over it. He had a little smile, like it was a lighthearted, drunken joke. It could be. Draco wouldn't say a word against it. But it didn't have to be - Draco had a comfortable sum of money, the bright side of the Malfoy name. If Harry wanted it - wanted
: namely, Sue, Alicia, Thomas and
They’d left the bottle on the vanity, however. Draco bit his lip, released it with a hiss as he caught the swollen flesh, and maintained his gaze resolutely on the rotten ceiling as he spoke:
But it wasn’t like Draco could just lean over the rest of the way and kiss him. The Charms classroom, with its walls stacked with forgotten library books, its desks harbouring perpetual mounts of lost quills and professor Flitwik forever hurrying in and out, wasn’t exactly the discreetest of places.
‘You can quit worrying.’
‘Amazing first time,’ Harry hummed. He sounded all soft and liquid - Draco wished he could be like that forever, never worried, never tense. ‘I’m glad I waited around for you.’
Dean Thomas went impossibly joyful in his eerily wide smile.
, and Draco was sure he’d tease him for it - surely call him ‘mate’ again, or mention goddamn Finnigan, or some other casual imposition of friendship that’d bring Draco’s ego properly down -, but he said nothing of the sort. Instead, he asked, officially dispeling the gentle intimacy:
Draco didn’t actually know if that was true. He’d watched, in fourth year - spent the entirety of the Yule Ball ogling Harry while Pansy’s hand dangled from his shoulder, cataloguing his steps, his laughs, the hesitant way in which he’d held onto Parvati’s waist. He’d noticed the shy awkwardness of it: the delicate movements confined Harry, he urged to move wider, surer, he ended up missing steps and grinding teeth. Because he was young - and mostly because he was in love -, Draco had been terribly self-involved, and assumed Harry simply needed a better dance partner. Someone who’d lead until Harry got the hang of it, someone who’d hold him tight lest he go astray, someone who’d perhaps tease, yes, but only to distract themselves from how
, an utterly unremarkable casualness - that meant Dean thought of him just the same as always. Nothing had changed. Harry hadn’t told him. Draco reckoned he hadn’t told anyone.
'I was meant to.'
‘You're not using my lube to go jerk off. You can ask me and I’ll take care of you myself,’ Draco retorted, and he really did like that picture - Harry
'Bloody hell, Potter, how long have you been thinking of snogging me senseless?'
Ginny turned to see Ron throwing the Quaffle back into play, looking dispirited, and sprinted back into action without another word.
To his surprise, Harry squirmed away sharply.
, which was incredibly rich seeing as Draco had wanted to do it since first year, but Draco was surely not going to complain.
And he felt so small saying it, so pathetic, like that absent fact, one he'd gathered from the nights he'd spent spying on Potter, presented any hope in his favour.
Draco laughed. ‘Yes, there is. What’d you want, Potter?’
‘Potter, your team’s composed of hungover nitwicks.  That’s including you.’
‘Candy, Finnigan?’ Pansy droned.
He looked back at Harry. There was a shifting conflict in his eyes - frustration, the still prominent shine of arousal and a dispiriting hint of shame.
Pansy laughed, dragging him through the crowd and out the establishment. 'I'd like you to be at least somewhat coherent when you talk to The Boy Who Lived.'
Hermione was leaning against the doorframe. She looked angry again. Perhaps she wasn’t, and Draco was simply poor at reading her.
Still, because this voice ached for confirmation, and he had still hurt Harry, no matter his intentions, and he could only handle so many side eyes from Finnigan and Longbottom whenever he went to fetch more aconite, he ended up turning towards Pansy halfway through the class.
Draco walked nearer to them, sighing when he saw them tense. He’d thought at least
‘Well? You can say it from there, Potter, I’m not bloody deaf.’
‘Not to compliment myself, but going from nothing to
There was very little to complain about in that turn of events. Draco pressed him against the desk, slid his other hand down so he could grip both of Harry’s hips, keeping him primly tucked between the edge of the desk and his own body, and kissed him harshly, drunk on his own sincerity, the reckless feel of it, the fact that it hadn’t pushed Harry away - it’d brought him closer, and they were kissing in broad daylight, even if in the privacy of the vacant classroom, and this
(See the end of the chapter for
had hurt him.
The question is: who do you think showed their House best?
‘They taste like pure sugar whatever form they’re in, Harry.’
Pansy want, anyway?’
‘You’re fucking daft is what you are. You can’t even walk in a straight line, how do you plan to fly?’
'But mostly kiss me,' Harry hummed with a playful smile - and if only he
Both Luna and Pansy looked over their shoulders at them. Luna’s blood red lips split into a radiant smile.
‘Well? Get off,’ he said, impatient. Draco moved tersely, untangling their robes while Harry tried to push his erection down and button up his jeans. He gathered Ron’s voice had freed Harry of whatever spell he’d been under, that he’d go down now and pretend none of it had happened like he had before, that he’d proceed to spend the rest of the night giggling with Neville instead of talking to
Harry shivered when Draco sucked more harshly at his earlobe, then pressed hands into his chest, trying to push him further into the bathroom.
Neville let out a self-conscious laughter, curls of hair falling over one of his eerie red eyes, and Ginny and Fletchley were urging him on while he fiddled with the little shot glass, and it wasn’t that Neville seemed uncomfortable but he didn’t seem unquestionably up for it either, so Draco sighed and spoke over the chatter:
But Harry didn’t leave. Though his fists were clenched, and he was glancing out the greenhouse door every so often, and he was surely so uncomfortable in his wet clothes - and Draco, in a surge of weakness, wanted to take them
‘You haven’t properly met my friends.’
A moment later, more faces - Neville, Ron, Finnigan, Pansy - were peering curiously through the door. And Harry simply looked
‘What on earth is this?’ he managed to ask, though his voice was rough, scratching painfully at the back of his throat.
‘Any objections?’ Harry raised an eyebrow, and Draco found himself with nothing to say, which was just as well, because Ron was piping up for his own turn.
He could hear, if he tried enough, the shrill voice of Ron Weasley clashing awkwardly through the pub. Then again, if he
‘Just answer the bloody question, Malfoy,’ Harry snorted. He was taking apart the pile of books now, lean fingers treading over their spines, and Draco was assaulted by the thought that he had
He placed a soft hand on his nape, coaxing his head up so their eyes could meet.
, the unbidden confession that had seemed so
Harry looked at him quizzically. Draco, though he was doing a little run to try and catch up with him, feet loud as he crossed the puddle on the floor, tried to look somewhat composed.
But dark roots don’t smother themselves. They fester. Draco could never turn back. No, he wasn’t that selfless - he’d cling tooth and nail until Harry cut him off himself.
Come Friday, the eighth years were a fit of nerves over Slughorn’s test. It was the Slytherin’s custom to play a modicum of stressed for appearance’s sake - in general, all students sat studying in the cold dungeon halls, a frantic, solidary mess of Gryffindors, Slytherins, Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws between manuals, notebooks and loose, scribbled pages, until the hour finally came and Slughorn ushered them in.
'At least let me finish my-'
'Are you fucking with us?' asked Ron.
‘It hardly matters. I’m more worried you’ll hate
‘Say, would you like to join us? You do look awfully pathetic over there.’
‘Are you going to any bars?’
'If I did not make his life miserable, and yet I still ogled him as much as I did, how long do you think it would take before the entire school realized what I felt?'
bed with that suit, with that lipstick, all heated and wanton? Draco owed it to his past self to commit the scene to memory; just a moment to reminisce on all the fantasies he'd had, from pitifully innocent things like dozing off in each other's arms after a long day to filthy flashes of hot and tight that kept him hopelessly distracted during Transfiguration. He had to
'I think I'll join you, then.'
'He hasn't tried me yet either, darling, if it serves you any comfort.'
‘You said you hated rum,’ Sue called out. Draco didn’t bother answering; he left the living room through an archway from which dangled a series of spiderwebs. In the kitchen he procured a half empty bottle. He took the stairs up.
Harry's laugh was cut off by a moan when Draco unbuttoned and unzipped his jeans, cupping him now through the flimsy - and fucking
when you looked at-'
Blaise seconded her, looking terribly disappointed.
He headed to the Astronomy tower. There was a nook there, almost on the top floor, under an arched window, bathed in a soft, pale light that was perfect for reading. It had become a favoured spot of his - no one else ever went there, and when the pages began to bore him he could turn to gaze out the glass panel, at the frosted school grounds, the front of trees guarding the Forbidden Forest, the edges of the Quidditch court, over which he could occasionally catch the quickly-shifting dots of players, and let his mind distort every little glimmer into the gold stripes on a scarf or the reflection off round-lensed glasses.
‘Yeah, Potter?’ Draco could feel his smile spread against Harry’s lips. ‘Somewhere with a door?’
Harry's laugh shook his entire body; their cocks rubbed against each other through their clothes, and they both bit off a moan.
and not topple over the side.
Is that so?’ Draco mused, cynical. After all, the girl was an amalgamate of Harry’s qualities tied up haphazardly: the challenge without the humour, the bravery without the charm, the threat without the vulnerability. Much too rough, all the brute strength of Gryffindors, the violence of the red without the finesse of the golden. A feral cat, not a lion. ‘I don’t see the appeal.’
‘Really, Potter?’ he said, aiming for amused. Harry actually had the nerve of pretending he hadn’t heard him. It made something panicked and fearful twist inside Draco.
'Nonsense. Let's have a drink first.'
‘It’s Slytherin practice, isn’t it, Goyle?’
‘I’d noticed,’ Harry snorted. For a moment, he stood by the door, his grin lopsided; then, he seemed to catch himself and walked closer. ‘Are those the ingredients?’
Harry’s response wouldn’t be immediate - and in that lingering silence his cheeks would heat up so lovely and pink, and everyone would know just how much Harry liked sucking cock, how he craved to have his lips slick and spread, his throat convulsing so obediently around
‘Is that the Gryffindor argument for fucking everything? You’ll die next time, you absolute tosser!’
‘Merlin, Malfoy, I was just asking,’ Harry turned his back on the mirror so he could properly look at Draco. ‘D’you apologize to Hermione then?’
‘You’re both in wretched moods, aren’t you?’ Blaise mused, Rowena suppressing a little smile besides him. ‘I was under the impression this would be
Harry hummed. ‘Maybe you’re right,’ he mused, replacing Draco’s hand with his own and giving him one firm stroke. ‘This is definitely more fun than Alchemy,’ he smirked, and then he was swallowing him down again.
‘I’m aware.’
there was a queue, and he was usually respectful of them, and if he said no now, he was sure Harry would obey - oh, because he was so obedient when he chose to be, so good for Draco, choosing to comply when all his instincts - all his life - urged him to defy. But Harry's words were irresistible, Harry's eyes and Harry's tone were even more so, and he very simply couldn't say no.
, 'Do you resent me for it?'
Draco told her, hushed and evasive, what had happened on the grounds. He didn’t mention his little episode with Harry in the bathroom: that, for some reason, seemed still too surreal to put out into the world - were he to speak it aloud, he feared someone would hear the unlikeliness of it and snatch it right out from under his sight. When he was finished, Pansy’s potion had simmered into a rich purple, while Draco's was sticking viscous and burnt to the bottom of the cauldron.
. But I believe they started in 1800.’
‘No possible way to win, then?’
Pike chuckled, tucked into Blaise’s lean figure. ‘I don’t mind. I find her a bit tiresome as well, to be honest. Figure she’ll make quite the pair with Zabini.’
told him once, when the Alihotsy had made everything so hedonistic pink, and he wouldn’t tell him again, not for a while, certainly not there.
Draco glared at him from the corner of his eye. His cheek still hurt; he could feel blood crusting in his chin.
Harry looked back at the store, but Draco could see the smile teasing his lips.
good memory here,’ he said between open-mouthed kisses. ‘Come friday I’m going to fail Potions.’
He forced a curt shrug. Pansy had agreed with him, hadn’t he? She’d barely batted an eye.
stayed - dancing and drinking in Hogsmeade? They ought to have had a merry night without him. Honestly, it was just indecent that they could drink so much, that they could drink that vile
‘You’re leaving?’ Draco managed to ask, leaning heavily on the bar.
Pansy let out a delighted laugh.
‘Potter, though. He could barely stand last night. From what I recall.’
-’ Draco stuttered, bucking mindlessly against Harry, who took it in stride, moving with him and humming even lower from his throat, a needy sound that reverberated through the whole of Draco’s length. It was those vibrations that tipped him over: he spilled down Harry’s throat, twitching against hot muscle, a hand on the back of Harry’s head to keep him in place. Harry’s gaze was unfocused, his grip weak on Draco’s hips, his breaths ragged through his nose. Spit and come bubbled down his bottom lip, glistening in his chin and forming a steadily dripping stream by the time Draco’s orgasm subsided.
, trying to head towards the exit again.
'Malfoy! We were just-' Hermione said, eyes wide with surprise, just like when they'd crossed at Hog's Head.
Neville shifted in his seat. ‘Do you really think they’ll fall?’
‘We didn’t. We ran away from unfortunate acquaintances. And your meddling House Ghost.’
, aren’t they? Like the sun during one of those heat waves - I was dying for a cloud to come.’
Ron cut Ginny off. ‘So being committed to the game means trying to kill your opponents?’
Come yell at me on discord, at autumn#2451
‘I do as well. Hand it over.’
Harry huffed, arms crossed like he was annoyed, which really just clashed with how vulnerable his lower half was, all bare and flushed and
‘Alright. What’s the base then?’
At that Harry huffed a laugh, though his brow was still furrowed. Pensive. Unsure. His eyes flittered around, only meeting Draco’s fleetingly.
One of Harry's hands left his chest - a millisecond later a gentle fuzz of light was hovering above them, allowing Draco to see his little smile perfectly. Figures Harry could do wordless magic. Figures Harry could do wordless magic while looking like Sin incarnate.
In Potions, neither Harry, Hermione nor Ron showed up. Their empty seats weighed dark and grim on Draco’s conscience. Every Gryffindor in attendance was distracted and fidgety; Neville and Finnigan in particular were sending him pointed looks whenever he ventured to the supply storage.
tell me?’ Draco urged, his gaze snapping back to Pansy. She didn’t even have the decency to look contrite - simply smiled, eyes twinkling under a dark purple shimmer.
Pansy swatted his arm. ‘You, my dear, are awfully dramatic. We’ve survived the Dark Lord, one would think we’ll survive Harry Potter as well. Come now, before breakfast ends. You’ve been out here too long.’
. It was just fucking selfish to go out into the field, really. Harry was a selfish fucking person, and Draco was tired, hungover and cold, and he’d gone there to focus on the
The words eased a dull, regretful weight inside of Draco - with Harry’s forgiveness his guilt dissolved, leaving nothing but a spotty soreness and the occasional fit of panic when wind wisped too close to his ear. With tentative steps, Draco took a seat beside him. Harry lifted an appraising eyebrow, then promptly laid down with a sigh.
before -, and there was a bubbling of panic and fear just an inch from the surface, and he couldn’t bear Harry’s expression as his eyes widened in surprise, so he broke the spell at last, stepped back towards the door and gestured vaguely at the vials with his gaze stubborn on the floor.
‘How mature,’ Draco drawled.
something now?'
'They haven't looked,' she noted, glancing at the group before taking a sip of her drink, 'Shall we go and greet them?'
'It's going to feel stranger,' he warned, back between Harry's legs.
Just for good measure - and he was really just wasting both his time and Harry’s, because the decision had been made as soon as Harry had asked - he pretended to consider it.
‘Move.’
, when he heard a set of footsteps approach. He turned - to his left, walking towards him, were Hermione, Finnigan and Longbottom.
Draco snapped his hips flush with Harry’s arse again. There’d be marks on Harry’s hips, five pretty dots on each. Draco hoped he’d be able to see them in the morning.
Draco didn’t really, instead starting on the stubborn buttons of Harry’s shirt.
Draco sighed, staring at the grey fabric bunched against his chest. It was still warm.
Harry groaned  'I think you made up that rule.'
'I-' Harry's smile was a bit crooked, a bit unsure as he rolled to his stomach. He looked at Draco over his shoulder. 'I don't think I've mentioned that I'm bloody nervous.'
Back in the Astronomy tower, tucked into his favoured alcove, Draco mulled over the short exchange. He was glad he’d go to Hogsmeade with the group again. Then again, there’d been something in Dean’s demeanour - or, better said, a strict lack of
The windows of the candy shop were neon bright, swirling in fluorescent pinks and greens. A sickeningly sweet fragrance hung in the chilly air outside. Finnigan was the first to get in, a bell chirping high-pitched as he opened the door. The others filtered in after, more than a few tripping on the small step, and Pansy and Draco entered last.
, that managed to destroy all his careful logic.
‘Oh, yeah? Nice and private, Potter?’ he drawled, punctuating the words with a teasing bite at Harry’s lip.
In front of the wide mirror, Harry was inspecting the glitter on his eyes.
His tone was soft, that usual stubborn edge dulled. It occurred to Draco that he’d never quite seen his work - the way his words, that wisk of his wand, had cut forever through Draco’s skin.
His eyes glistened so enticingly, and his tongue was flicking out to lick his lips in nervous excitement, and it seemed, the idea of the game, in the complicit privacy of the dim storage room, unexplainably
Draco snorted. ‘There’s an order to this, is there?’
‘Spring.’
Harry took the umbrella, spun the handle in his palm, then smiled that crooked, mischievous smile of his. ‘Thanks, Malfoy. Oh, I forgot - the party, if you go - it’s a House party. You have to bring something to show what House you’re in. Not your tie or something, though, that’s no fun.’
‘I think I’ll go check.’
‘You know what they say, Draco - there’s no better cure for a hangover than some fresh air,’ drawled Blaise, pushing Draco’s legs off his lap and hoisting him up by his arm. Draco wavered a bit, head unstable, too heavy, slipping off his neck. Once he recovered his sight, he glared.
‘Why did you help pay for the treacle tarts, the other night?’
we fucked?’
‘Potter, bloody hell,’ Draco groaned, trying to keep his tone hushed. He gripped the edge of the cold desk for support as Harry swallowed around him and his tongue, as Harry shifted it in his mouth, flicked over his slit. It felt
And Harry laughed - what else could he do? - with his lips against Draco’s skin.
