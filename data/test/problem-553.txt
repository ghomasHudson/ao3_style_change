It was horrible, easily described as soul destroying, as he felt himself growing more and more lonely with every day that passed with Ron still refusing to so much as look at him.
“My dears, it is time for us to consider the stars,” she announced grandly, sweeping her hands up towards the ceiling which was decorated with images of the constellations. Lavender let out a sharp gasp of excitement. “The movements of the planets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who understand the steps of the celestial dance. Human destiny may be deciphered by the planetary rays, which intermingle…”
Draco felt the bottom drop out of his stomach as he, along with everyone else in the room, turned to stare at Professor Moody in shock following the sour faced man’s statement.
It wasn't the first time he'd woken up with an erection, he was a teenage boy going through puberty after all, and he knew that it was perfectly normal thanks to the extremely awkward “talk” Mrs Weasley had given both him and Ron during his stay at the Burrow before the Quidditch World Cup. He also knew, thanks to the same awkward “talk” that at they'd had, that waking up from a so called “wet dream” or feeling the need to “touch himself” were also perfectly normal things to experience whilst going through puberty. All of this had been highly amusing to him and Ron after the “talk” was over and done with, to the point where they'd compared what had happened to them, but this latest development wasn't so funny.
“Thank you, Severus,” Dumbledore cut him off, his voice sharper than Harry had ever heard him before, before he turned to face Harry himself. His expression softened, pure worry filling his eyes as he asked calmly, “Did you put your name in the
“I suppose it'll probably come down to who he considers to be the lesser of two evils; Javier and Claude or JJ and Fabian,” Draco surmised thoughtfully, placing the most recent family photograph on the corner of his little desk nearest the delicate looking lampshade. It had been taken during their most recent ‘
Thankfully the muggle in question had taken her in and they’d been married in a small muggle ceremony a couple of months before they’d been blessed with a daughter.
“No, no, Vi,” the Fat Lady reassured her friend as the portrait began to swing open slowly. “It’s the password. I’ve asked Professor McGonagall to change it but she won’t, you see…”
,” Claude hurriedly murmured, leaning his head against Javier’s shoulder. When the Spaniard only grunted in response he nuzzled into his neck, pressing a series of kisses to the lightly tanned skin. “
He spoke politely, his eagerness bubbling just below the surface, but even then Professor Snape was visibly angered by the request the young student had just passed on to him.
Throughout their school lives pupils at Beauxbatons Academy of Magic slept not in crowded dormitories like most boarding schools but in reasonably large rooms with no more than three pupils per room. Each year the Head Boy and Head Girl were the only students given a private room of their own, complete with en suite bathroom, in their relevant house building. House Prefects, such as his friends, received no special treatment regarding their bedrooms although there was a Prefects bathroom in each of the three grand buildings.
“A heinous crime, of course,” Javier muttered fondly before taking a bite of his sandwich and gagging, his face twisting into an expression of utter disgust. “What
“Oh, right,” Ron grumbled, picking at a loose thread in the blanket which covered his entire bed and even draped off of both sides. “I thought you might’ve told me if it was the
It wasn’t a deliberate move, he quickly figured out even in his sleep-befuddled state, just a case of Claude moving in his sleep as he was known to do. Thankfully his elbow had missed Draco’s nose, striking his cheekbone instead, and the creams he used in his morning routine would soothe the worst of the bruising before it could even begin to appear on his pale skin.
Harry tried not to take her “predictions” too seriously as most of them had been proven to be complete and utter codswallop but there had been a couple of times when she’d been right, or at least
They’d stood by him through everything that his crazy life had thrown at them, had believed him when he’d told them about seeing the Grimm, had listened to him when he’d opened up about his visions and had never questioned the things he’d shared about the Dursley’s.
“I wasn’t going to forget him!” Draco protested. “I just didn’t want to pack him away in the dark suitcase.
“I know but trust me the description of Fleur’s family is significantly worse,” Hermione explained. “I can show you that later, if you’re interested. And the Black and Lestrange families which they’re also both linked to. Their histories are even darker than the Malfoy’s.  Now, in terms of recent history for the Malfoy’s this is all that the book has to say.
Unlike her sister Fleur didn’t look even the slightest bit innocent, not with her cold grey eyes and her pursed lips which were painted a rather vivid red colour. She was alternating between making goo-goo eyes at Viktor Krum and glaring at one of the boys sat at one of the middle two tables, a boy who was blatantly ignoring her as he laughed with his friends.
At that Ramona let out an unladylike snort, catching up with him, while Javier and Claude shared a blatantly amused look before sizing up Fleur’s goons who looked ready to attack.
As soon as he’d opened the simple window his eagle owl was gone, the back draft caused by his powerful wings ruffling Draco’s hair even more than the breeze from outside had done.
, Harry thought to himself as she moved away to take her seat with her favourite students gathered close around her, Lavender and Parvati taking the pouffes on either side of her chair. Padma, Parvati’s twin sister who had been sorted into Ravenclaw, sat as far away as she could get as did Harry and Ron. Throughout his
“Potter hasn’t even begun to complete his work for my class so I’m afraid that he shall not be going anywhere until my lesson has concluded,” Professor Snape informed the young messenger, his cold words drawing snickers from the Slytherin students in the room. A confused frown appeared on Colin’s face. “Well? Is there something else you wish to say?”
All four house tables had filled up by the time the magical sky above them began to light up with beautiful streaks of lightening, mirroring the sky outside, and get there was still no sign of the first years. This was unusual but given the weather also completely understandable.
Jordan,” Madame Maxime called out as she rose from her seat, brushing her enormous hands across her robes in order to remove any wrinkles from the expanse of fabric. As ever her elaborate robes included a high collar, this one made of fur, which framed her head like she was an Elizabethan Queen. “If you would lower ze steps for us…”
before they'd left. This time she was putting the fairy lights up in a large spiral pattern on the ceiling which appeared to be almost hypnotic.
no matter what had happened. Thankfully, however, her son was far too young to catch her on her blatantly obvious lie.
Reaching backwards, careful not to remove his lips from those of his boyfriend, the young Frenchman delivered a sharp smack to the curve of Draco's hip in response to the slight.
The words died in his throat before he could even open his mouth, almost choking him, and he was almost grateful when Ludo Bagman all but tumbled down the stairs in his haste to reach him, taking him by the arm and physically drawing him over to stand with the others.
hot if you go for that sort of thing, which I don't. I go for blondes myself…” Harry blurted out before he could stop himself. Ron and Hermione turned to look at him as one and then it was his turn to flush. “I…uh…this was not how I intended to tell you guys…”
During the rise of the Dark Lord both she and her then fiancé had been pressured into joining his cause by their families, Lucius taking the Dark Mark alongside his father whilst she had escaped being branded due to the fact that both of her parents as well as two of her older sisters had leapt at the chance to become fully fledged members of the evil cause. Thus she had been allowed to slip into the shadows, spouting his rhetoric when it was required of her but never once taking any sort of vow to remain faithful to the Dark Lord.
Even the confrontation with DeLacour had been somewhat predictable in that it had happened although some of her comments were just as vague as Mrs Weasley's and Ron’s older brothers had been back on the station, meaning that she knew something they didn't.
Yanking his pillow out from underneath his head Draco twisted and brought it down on his friends head, causing him to cry out in alarm as the assault continued with blows of the soft pillow landing all over his squirming body. Ramona’s laughter reached an almost hysterical level, tears flooding down her cheeks as her brother finally stirred, letting out a tired groan,
“I suppose that means I have to change into my robes,” she huffed, her face scrunching up in annoyance as she thought of the delicate concoction of the finest silk money could buy. Because of her more ample figure she had always hated wearing the light fabric which clung to every curve she possessed but Draco, an impartial observer given his sexuality, had always thought she looked truly stunning in them. “I hope Skye hasn't moved my things…”
“Well, take a good look at it now. Tomorrow you two are going to sign this contract, and vow to keep all of the terms listed on it—lest you face the consequences for defying...”
The girl now however seemed much older and more mature—her hair cut short into a sleek bob, accented with a single stripe of purple tucked behind her ear. She finally opened her mouth after staring at Harry for a few moments.
in a good way. Looking upward he couldn’t see the ceiling which he knew must be located high above them, the flaming torches adorning the walls failing to illuminate the distant reaches, but he could clearly see that every available wall space had been filled with a magical painting of some kind. There also appeared to be a rather alarming number of suits of armour, some carved out of stone, some made of metal.
Severus had attempted to keep his love of Lily Evans a secret at first but Narcissa had seen straight through it with the help of Lucius who, despite protesting the contrary, was a terrible gossip who loved to report everything and anything he’d seen or heard during the day. The day Lily Evans had married James Potter Severus had been forced to spend the night in their spare room after indulging in a significant (and worrying) amount of alcohol.
Continuing to chuckle to himself Draco hung his towel up on the hook provided, kicked off his awful footwear and turned on the shower to get the water heating up. Whilst he waited for it to reach the temperature he personally preferred he unpacked his wash bag, placing everything with easy reach of the stream of steaming water; shampoo, conditioner, body wash, natural sea sponge and a body moisturiser designed to be applied in the shower.
they responded together, their voices perfectly synchronised down to the littlest inflection as they strode past him, alighting the steps to enter the carriage. His nose scrunched up as he caught a whiff of their strong perfume, leaving him with the horrible sensation that he wanted to sneeze but physically couldn’t as he followed them inside. They had already dropped down onto a chez-lounge each when he stepped into the common room, carefully closing the door behind him. Odette smiled up at him, flicking her long auburn curls over her shoulder as she spoke, “Are you excited for tonight?”
“Papillonlisse, Ombre Lune and Bellefeuille?” Harry repeated, butchering the pronunciation so badly that both Claude and Javier winced ever so slightly. “Are there only three houses?”

“I fell down some stairs, my little dragon,” she reassured him softly, twisting the truth into a lie which wouldn’t upset him. “Mummy wasn’t looking where she was going and fell out of one of her shoes. That’ll teach me to wear impractical shoes whilst out walking, won’t it?”
, wore a lilac coloured pin shaped like a butterfly in flight with the detail marked out in a beautiful rose gold while Javier had always been proud of his midnight blue pin, perfectly circular in shape and decorated with delicate silvers stars and a crescent shaped moon to symbolise his house,
At long last the tables were cleared, causing an excited murmur to spread through the younger students, and the three Headteachers took their places around the Goblet of Fire.
Harry had no choice but to swing his bag over his shoulder and, after shooting Hermione a wince, follow Colin out of the classroom and into the deserted corridor. Once the door had shut behind them, separating them from the sea of
That would have been bad enough but the four friends had then retired to his room for their own celebration, a celebration which had eventually become a planning meeting about how his friends were going to help him throughout the

“It’s really not that difficult, Harry,” Hermione attempted to reassure him after Harry failed to master a simple Summoning Charm in Professor Flitwick’s class, the public humiliation of being one of the only students not to achieve the desired result only marginally worse than the additional homework he’d received as a result. “You just weren’t concentrating prop…”
“Bloody hell…” Ron breathed out deeply in shock as the ceiling calmed down above them, the caster of the powerful spell slowly limping his way across to Professor Dumbledore. He was unlike anyone Harry had ever seen before; every inch of exposed skin seemed to be covered with a horrific patchwork of scars and one of his eyes seemed to be artificial, held into the socket by an old collection of leather straps and buckles. “It's Made-Eye Moody.”
“…Father actually considered sending me to Durmstrang rather than Hogwarts, you know. He knows the Headmaster, you see,” Fleur DeLacour announced as pompously as ever, her clipped voice breaking through the frightened whimpers of the students hurrying away from them like a knife. Harry could easily picture her standing with one hand on her hip, nails filed into the deadly talons she usually favoured, the other flipping her long hair over her shoulders as she pulled back her shoulders to show of her breasts. “Well, you know his opinions of Dumbledore, Mothers too – the man’s such a Mudblood-lover – and Durmstrang doesn't admit that sort of riff-raff. But Mother didn't like the idea of me going to school so far away. Father says Durmstrang takes a far more sensible line than Hogwarts about the Dark Arts. Durmstrang students actually
It was relatively easy to avoid everyone for the rest of the day, it being a Sunday so only a few voluntary clubs were running, none of which he belonged to, but come the following morning he could no longer avoid the hordes of people who wanted nothing more than to stare at him. Those who believed that he’d been entered against his will, such as Hermione, were clearly in the minority as almost everyone stopped him to ask him how he’d done it.
Now, Harry could put up with a lot from Fleur DeLacour but one thing he would not stand for was listening to the selfish girl insult such a wonderfully kind woman as Molly Weasley.
Shortly thereafter the clapping and chatting died down, everyone’s attention returning to Goblet of Fire as its flames once again turned red. Draco felt his breath seize in his chest as a slightly charred circular piece of blue parchment was thrown up into the air by the flames.
Thus he was well aware of the reputation the various branches of his family tree had back in England where the majority of the trouble had taken place. He knew what people said about the Malfoy family, that people assumed they'd fled so as not to face prosecution when in reality it was to escape the deadly clutches of both of their families and start a new life in peace. And, most importantly just then, he knew that his cousins who had no doubt been indoctrinated to follow in their parent’s footsteps were currently attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Fleur, the eldest, was fourteen and Gabrielle, her sister, eleven.
They were right, of course – it was indeed the famous Bulgarian Seeker looking every bit as handsome as he had in the numerous newspaper articles which had been written about him since the final of the
Leaning down to kiss her mother’s cheek as was expected of her Narcissa offered her father a small smile before squaring her shoulders and taking a step back, removing herself from immediate striking distance whilst her hand curled around the jewelled handle of her wand.

“Fancy not even getting his name right, Weasley,” she crowed, smirking over her shoulders at her loyal followers and cronies. “It’s almost as though he’s a complete nonentity, isn’t it?”
“It’s disgusting,” Javier announced passionately, all but throwing the rest of his sandwich back onto his plate before grabbing a glass of water and taking three large gulps. “What could possibly possess anyone to willingly eat such a foul thing? Ugh! I can still taste it…”
that she held but snatching it back before he could take hold of it. Fleur laughed coldly. “Listen to this!”
Blowing on the ink to dry it he carefully folded the sheet in half and then in half again so that it would fit into one of the envelopes he’s brought with him. Sealing it shut with a droplet of wax, pressing his signet ring into it as his father had taught him to, he quickly scribbled his home address on the front of the envelope and moved across to the cage hanging from a delicate chain in the corner of his room. Auctus, his owl, hopped obediently onto his left arm when he opened the cage, taking the letter carefully with his sharp beak.
, teaching them all how to properly behave on such an occasion as this, and so it only took a couple of seconds for them to get themselves ready. Nina and Thierry were at the front, the Frenchman stood on the right with his arm offered so that she could rest her hand atop his. Then came Skye, Jan, Josephine and Fabian, all paired up in the same manner. Next came the three pairs of Senior Prefects; Adelaide and Javier, Yvette and Claude, Ramona and JJ.
party round be chosen to compete. Some, however, wore expressions of idle curiosity and he guessed that these were the students that weren't going to enter.
Now that he had been gone for almost a year, supposedly vanquished by an infant whose parents had sacrificed their lives in a desperate attempt to save his, she and her husband had come to an agreement. It was time for them to begin anew, without the pressures and expectations put on them not only by their family but by the Wizarding Community at large.
Champion had just passed after their eyes had met for a moment, his subtle expression surprising Harry. There had been no sign of suspicion or judgement in those piercing grey eyes, only a healthy dose of both concern and confusion.
“Hey!” Javier protested as he pulled away from his boyfriend, pushing himself up onto his elbow so that he could glare good-naturedly at his friend. “We didn't agree to any
“Half of my friends are too in awe of me to sit with me,” Harry responded bitterly, nodding towards the ones who were gazing at him as though he were Merlin himself. “Whilst the other half hate me for cheating or for finding out a way to enter myself and not sharing it.”
He had stayed loyal to the Dark Lord until the end, had even gone to trial although as he’d never actively participated in the slaughter of innocents he received a reduced sentence.
Claude responded, his voice as smooth as silk. Draco couldn’t contain his smirk as he and Ramona watched the couple bickering with each other as they so often did, particularly when their grasp of each other’s language was concerned. Javier’s French was better than Claude’s Spanish buy he was by no means fluent. Not yet, anyway, but Draco knew they would be one day. “
“Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the Goblet” Dumbledore announced, gesturing to the flames within the cup. An excited murmur spread throughout the room. “Aspiring champions have twenty-four hours in which to put their names forward.”
, and, as if to make matters worse, it turned out that the cute fourteen-year-old student who had been semi-stalking Draco and who had begun to feature in his fantasies whether he planned it or not was none other than
Gabrielle DeLacour had been graced with the same delicate looks that Draco himself had inherited from his mother; milky white skin, big blue eyes in her case and waist length platinum blonde hair which was gathered into a long braid and draped over one shoulder.
Mercifully he only had the conclusion of his essay to finish and he completed it in no time at all, ending the piece of work with his usual signature, a somewhat dramatic version of his name which he’d perfected over the last few months after signing forms had become more commonplace once he’d turned seventeen. Whereas before he’d come of age he’d had to get his parents signatures on everything he was now allowed to sign them himself which was both exciting and terrifying all at once. Finished with his homework he put everything away properly, securing the three rolls of parchment with different coloured ribbons for each class to make identifying them easier, and brought out a smaller piece of parchment.
“My dear Madame Maxime,” Professor Dumbledore called out with a seemingly genuine smile, descending from the raised platform upon which the staff table sat in order to press a kiss to the back of Madame Maxime’s hand. “Welcome to Hogwarts.”
“…uh huh…” Draco muttered, blowing on the last of the four slips of parchment in an effort to dry the ink. He was proud of his penmanship, something his friends knew all too well, and he was perfectly aware that the easiest way to convince him to do something he either didn't want to or didn't technically have to was to flatter him in some way given that his pride was his greatest weakness. However… “It sounds more like the three of you couldn't be bothered so I suppose you all owe me a favour now for doing your work for you…”
“Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object! It would have needed an exceptionally strong
Madame Maxime’s voice echoed throughout the interior of the carriage, interrupting many a contented doze or pleasant conversation. It had already been explained that they were to speak English as much as possible for the duration of their stay and so it was no surprise to hear her heavily accented voice using the language of their hosts and Draco's native tongue.
“I’ll send for Severus,” her husband announced, releasing his hold of her chin in favourite of running his fingers gently through her hair. “Or perhaps Penelope would be better.”
Draco looked up from the essay he had been working on in the library at Ramona’s teasing announcement, following her gaze across to the desk opposite there’s where he caught sight a familiar messy haired boy who glanced away as soon as grey eyes met green.
Neville’s reaction had been pushed to the back of his mind as the class had continued with a demonstration of the killing curse; the curse which had robbed him of his parents. It had only been afterwards, when Professor Moody had sought out the still affected Neville, that he had realised why his friend had been so upset; the
“That just sounds wrong…” Claude muttered dryly, reaching forward to shake Harry’s hand once the other boy released it, his expression turning serious. “Try not to worry about what everyone thinks. If they do not believe you then they are not worth knowing. You should be worrying only about your education, your health and the Tournament. No more than that.”
” experiences in his short life not to understand exactly what the former Auror was implying; someone had orchestrated his participation in the infamous
He couldn't say what possessed him to do it, it was like there was something drawing his attention back in the room, but as he was crossing the threshold Draco tilted his head to glance back over his shoulder. His eyes met a pair of startlingly green bespectacled eyes.
“If I agree to go will you stop behaving like toddlers?” Draco enquired, unable to fight the smile blossoming on his face. If there was one thing his friends could always do it was make him smile, more often than not at the most inappropriate moments. “You've convinced me, I'll go. Now would you please stop elbowing my in the ribs and rubbing your breasts against me? They're very lovely breasts, don't get me wrong, but I am pretty comfortable with my homosexuality and as such would rather not have them rubbed all over my upper body…”
- Please be aware that in some places I will be utilising some of the original material, although it has all been adapted and altered to fit with my changes to the overall storyline. None of it is literally copy/pasted as I consider that to be cheating (and borderline plagiarism which is not acceptable in my book.) As the story progresses this will happen less and less but in this first chapter, particularly in the very first section where the “scene is being set”, I struggled not to include some aspects. Just wanted to warn you.
and who sadly had no children to inherit the shop when the time came. Lucius had quickly proven his worth, Draco having inherited his natural talent in Potions from his father, and had taken over the business when Marcel had retired when Draco was thirteen.
He'd spent the summer following their break-up, if it could be called that, grieving for his lost love and his lost pride and then had spent the next year of school with a wall around his heart. He didn't date. He didn't flirt. Claude, Javier and Ramona were the only ones allowed to get close to him and that was only because they wouldn't leave him alone. This past summer he'd finally begun to heal, flirting with a couple of boys he'd met when her and his parents had gone on holiday to New Zealand but he'd never let it go any further than that.

Hermione opened her mouth to respond, but Pansy beat her to it. “He’s responsible for making potions that make people fall asleep— so they can be operated on, as well as to help make and create new potions that can be used to cure people when they get sick or hurt.” The girl supplied with a minor eye roll.
Just as Knightly was about to raise his voice at the lack of "waking up", there was a groan that emitted from one of the beds.
A quill appeared, hovering over the paper. Harry took it and glanced down to where Kingsley pointed, taking a deep breath and signing his name.
“It’s...been going well.” Hermione offered with a slightly strained smile, glancing at Ron for comment.
"Figured I'd start cooking and you can wake them up....it'll probably be better if I'm not there immediately." He explained with a shrug, turning back to the stove and stirring whatever it was that was in the pan—Harry couldn't see.
Kingsley watched as Davies carefully removed the fabric—letting out a gasp as the skin underneath was revealed.
“Yes, yes, the Telly, that’s right,” He replied dismissively, finally glancing over to the couch where his best friend sat. “You rearranged the furniture?” Blaise cocked his head in question at the blonde.
“Wow, that actually sounds...fascinating.” Hermione marveled with a glimmer of curiosity in her eyes.
“I wonder how well you can protect yourself, though....,” The man paused, and again his eyes drifted towards Harry’s form. “...while you’re trying to protect him...?”
“Erk...Oh fine...” Harry closed his eyes and steeled himself before starting. “So I guess the story starts a few months after I had started working at the Ministry. I became an Auror shortly after the war was over, and things were going well...Then one day after a case I was on, I got a call from Kingsley and was told to report to his office...”
Harry swallowed nervously and twiddled his thumbs. “I...think that everything has been going pretty well...Mr. Knightly is very knowledgeable and has been very patient and kind while teaching me...” He paused and Kingsley nodded, gesturing for him to continue. “A lot of the cases have been hard, but...they’ve been very interesting and fun to work on...I’ve throughly enjoyed all that I’ve done so far, and hope that I can continue to work alongside Mr. Knightly to help make the Wizarding World a better place...”
“As Minister of Magic, I now call this session into order,” Kinglsey’s deep voice boomed through the open room, followed by the rap of a gavel hitting the stand. “To all who are gathered here today, I have asked you to bear witness to the initiation ceremony for two of our newly entered Auror trainees. Directly following the initiation, we will continue on with the ritual for Auror partnership.”
." He retorted instead, balking at the hideous maroon jumper that the other male had just grabbed off of a hanger.
A million thoughts raced through Harry’s head as Florence nodded, patting him reassuringly on the back as he exited the office and the doors swung closed behind him with a solid
Kingsley and Knightly immediately jumped up when Harry began to scream. Knightly had already dashed over to Harry's side, but then a second voice joined the screams and caused everyone, even Davies, to freeze.
“Oh come now—you didn’t expect me to recognize the savior of the Wizarding World? You may have grown, but I’m afraid you’re still a child....”
Draco frowned at the serious-sounding words and glanced across Florence to Harry. Apparently the boy-wonder was thinking similarly—his face was pale and his brows drawn towards his eyes.
Here’s the latest installment of the YDW! Series. Things are starting to get more interesting as more characters are being introduced~
“Bloody hell, I think I’m gonna be sick...” Ron muttered queasily, watching Harry with no small amount of mortification on his face.
The older Auror did so, begrudgingly, and resumed his perch a short distance away on the bed next to Draco's.
Draco screwed his face up in disgust. “Do you three have nothing better to do than to make bets on my love life?!”
“Well, I never did care for this furniture arrangement anyways!” Draco replied immediately—snatching his wand out of his back pocket with sudden motivation.
"Ah, yes." Davies coughed slightly and glanced down at his stack of parchment. "I mean to say that most of the wounds that Mr. Potter received have been healed and are no longer a cause for concern."
"Urg...too many clothes...." Draco grumbled in complaint—reaching over to the coffee table and grabbing his wand. With a mumbled spell and a swish of his wrist, the two of them were rid from their clothing, besides their boxers, and Draco happily resumed work- tossing his wand carelessly behind him.
The lack of the word Mudblood didn't go unnoticed by Hermione, who looked at the Slytherin with slightly more accepting eyes.
The quill levitating in front of him scratched noisily against the floating piece of parchment, leaving a trail of inked words as it went.
Harry barely suppressed a groan. “Sir, I don’t understand—how in the world is Malfoy qualified to be my partner? Or an Auror for that matter?! He’s obviously never been trained in, he’s never even worked here for the Ministry, and, further more, how am I supposed to work with someone that’s hated me ever since we met?!”
Harry stirred in his bed slightly, emitting a groan as his eyelids fluttered open. Kingsley and Knightly were at his bedside in an instant—peering over the young man with concern.
Harry furrowed his brow suspiciously. “How? Not even the Ministry knows that we’re living together....Well, except for Kingsley—but that’s because he’s the one that assigned us as Auror partners...”
Draco shifted on the couch and shrugged his shoulders somewhat uncomfortably. “Something different?” He offered with another shrug, reaching the remote up and turning the Television on.
“Ah, please sir. I’m nowhere near ready,” Harry refuted humbly, his face flushing in color at the high praise from his mentor.
“Well, you haven’t in so many words,” Blaise returned with a mild shrug. “It just seems that way from what I hear about him and how you guys live together.”
Florence paled as he watched his two young protégées being levitated through the hallway—both boys lain on crisp, white linen stretchers. Their bodies were completely still—a stark contrast to the many people bustling frantically around them. The staff entered through a set of wide doors, and Florence knew he wasn’t allowed to follow them. He watched the two stretchers until the doors swung closed behind them, and he could see them no more. Florence sunk down onto one of the benches lining either wall of the dim, sterile hallway—cradling his head in his hand with guilt.
?” Harry prompted, again glancing around at their surroundings. “If it doesn’t have anything to do with where to go or how to track these snatchers, then you’re wasting our time, Malfoy.”
” The blonde panted shortly after his lover had retracted his lips to regain some air. The Slytherin began impatiently rocking his hips against Harry’s before pushing the dark haired male backwards and hovering over him.
Draco reached forwards and grabbed the hem of Harry's boxers, pulling them down and leaning forwards to capture his prize in his mouth.
Draco pursed his lips and heaved an annoyed sigh—swiping the remote control for the television off of the coffee table and turning the Telly off. “Blaise mate, I’m serious. I need you to clear out.”
The blonde shrugged his shoulders with a slight roll of his eyes. “Yeah, I guess. He wanted a change, so....”
Harry exchanged slightly worried glances with Draco, wondering if he should ask just what it was that they were talking about—but Pansy suddenly cut in before he could get a word out.
Harry sighed and bit back the retort on his tongue. “First we should figure out where we’re even at.” He glanced around yet again and found nothing but trees—tall and looming.
“Ah, here we are at the apparating point Potter! Grab hold, I’ll take us back to the Ministry!” Florence exclaimed brightly and held out his arm, waiting for Harry to grab on.
Blaise snickered slightly and cast an apologetic glance over to Ron and Hermione. “Ah. So I see my presence wasn’t made known to you before you arrived.”
“Whenever two Aurors are decided as partners, the first thing that they need to do is to form a contract with each other,” Kingsley explained slowly, conjuring a piece of parchment and quill from thin air. “This contract are the basic ‘ground rules’ for the two Aurors—meaning that neither are allowed to break them, lest they violate their partnership with the other.”
“It’s a newer department that Kingsley had established when he became Minister of Magic after the war. Our job is basically to evaluate the current laws around the Wizarding World— some that have to do with the safety and protection of magic from Muggles, some are just the laws of magic themselves. We then decide if the laws are working, and if they’re not what we need to do to change them and make them effective...” She trailed off and her cheeks tinged pink when she realized that she had started rambling, and quickly looked away to avoid eye contact with the Slytherin.
Dressed in a pair faded jeans and slightly oversized sweatshirt, Harry strolled quietly into the living room and leaned back against the dining table with a cross of his arms. He was now completely behind the couch, so Blaise took no notice of the new figure in the room—however Draco was having a hard time taking his eyes off of him. There may not‘ve been anything fancy or stylish with the outfit that Harry had chosen to display himself in— but Draco though he looked absolutely shaggable.
“I think there are a lot of people that are taking life seriously after surviving through the war...if another experience like that ever comes up...Well, I think people are done taking their loved ones for granted...” Harry offered wisely, and the blonde’s expression softened in understanding.
"I have," Harry replied confidently. "They're my friends, and I know them well. Even if they don't.......accept us....right away, I know that they will eventually.”
Harry didn't know if he wanted to sigh with relief or groan in pain at the sudden appearance of his lover—but for the moment, he decided that he would feel a bit more relieved.
The last part came out a bit more sarcastic than Harry had meant for it to, but it was too late to start taking back words now.
"Seriously. For good now. I just want to be me—a normal wizard, who works as an Auror for the Ministry, hates it when things aren't tidy, and loves my boyfriend—who just happens to be the savior of the Wizarding World." Draco finished his mini-speech with a firm nod of resignation, and Harry grabbed his hand underneath the table and gave it a squeeze of support.
Knightly was the first to break the silence. "What," he whispered in horror, "in the name of bloody hell...was that."
The dark haired male shifted uncomfortably and tried to resist the temptation to flit his eyes back to the kitchen where he knew Draco was cooking away. Thankfully the blonde had enough sense to throw up a sound Charm around the kitchen to keep his noises from being heard by those in the living room.
Harry didn’t have time to ask what that meant before the older man began scratching away furiously at the parchment, only stopping after he had filled a good two-thirds of the page with writing. “Alright, here’s the basis for your contract...”
Apparently the glare that he received worked—Ron immediately grew quiet and slumped back into his seat with pink-tinged ears.
Ron scowled and took the momentary lapse in silence to butt in. “So you don’t have any problem whatsoever that your supposed best mate is dating our best mate?”
He only got as far as the fourth floor before everyone began to emerge from lessons, and Harry reflected that he really had timed this appallingly badly. He was right next to the charms classroom, and he could hear chattering voices inside, and he dived into the nearest empty room and locked the door tight.
Dean and Seamus both raised their eyebrows at each other. Harry hadn't even thought to take it like that —
Ginny spelled the dining room into an impromptu gym for them, and worked him through drills until he was in danger of throwing up. Ginny let him stop, flopped beside him on the transfigured mat.
A small crowd of customers mingled on the verge in the twilight, some standing about and staring at the van, others chatting amongst themselves in the patchy grass. Harry scanned them, looking for the distinctive white-blond head.
"I guess so," said Harry. It never would have occurred to him to ask any of them for help. "Yeah. I think… I should do that."
"Thank you," he said, feeling suddenly attached to her, this perfect stranger who'd marked him for life.
"Yeah," said Dean, wiping his face. He pulled Seamus back down onto the sofa. "That was a weird experience. He's actually
"I think it took him maybe three weeks before I complained to him about Fish and Jenny and he asked me to move in with him." Malfoy looked away again, shivering in his see-through shirt. "He told me they were leeches, that they were taking the piss having me tend the bar and clean the house and giving me so little for it. And then he told me I was the first person he'd ever met that made him feel the way he did. He told me… "
They slipped down the stairs in silence, skirting past the bassline thumping through the dining room door and down the back stairs to the kitchen. Malfoy slumped on one worn wood chair, watching Harry as he filled the kettle and Summoned teacups. The faint sounds of partying filtered down from above, washing over Harry as he settled down opposite and sipped at his drink. Malfoy was avoiding his eye. Harry was unable to stop looking at him.
"Um," said Harry, once they were all seated at the kitchen table and staring at him expectantly. "So. I've called you here to consult you on the possibility of inviting a new person to stay here."
Just at that moment Draco came thudding back down the stairs, sprinting into the room with his favourite stuffed animal clutched in his arms. Due to his name most of Draco’s toys were dragons but none of these had ranked as his all-time favourite. No, the toy that was dragged around by him almost constantly was a fluffy light brown rabbit with long ears.
“…do you suppose all the stories about him are true?” Ramona wondered after a while. “I mean, a baby surviving the Killing Curse when no one else has? Doesn’t that seem a bit...”
“Congratulations, Draco,” Lara murmured, following Jan’s example and crossing to give the platinum blond a tight hug whilst pressing a light kiss to his cheek. “You shall be wonderful.”
The Headmaster, Professor Dumbledore, was stood in front of his thrown like chair to greet them and Draco was amused to notice that he looked like the muggle version of a wizard; long white beard which was gathered together by a little ribbon or chain, wire-rimmed spectacles, billowing robes with delicate embroidery on the sleeves and a small round hat.
Draco’s attention was drawn to the double doors when they once again opened, this time smoothly and silently, to admit an old man struggling to carry a large casket, obviously many years old and made of  a combination of metal and wood. The fact that he wasn’t using magic to move the obviously heavy casket suggested that the man was probably a squib.
It was the boys who led the way, armed with staff’s which sparked upon impact with the ground as they performed a manly display of testosterone which left quite a few people, Draco included, a little bit hot under the colour. They finished by blowing magical flames up into the air, shaped like dragons and snakes, just as their female counterparts entered the room, striding calmly through the flames looking both mysterious, glamourous and aloof.

“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the European schools of wizardry – Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. A champion was selected to represent each school and the three champions competed in three magical tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the Tournament once every five years and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent was of establishing ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities – until, that is, the death toll mounted so high that the Tournament was discontinued.”
It was at this point that Ron gave up, pushing his textbook away and joined his fellow students in folding his arms on his desk and going to sleep, his movements almost perfectly synchronised with those of Justin Finch-Fletchley who had also decided to give up on the lesson. Hermione shot him a predictable glare, her hand moving quickly as she took notes despite the fact that Binns was literally just reading from the textbook just as he always did.
“Draco?” Ramona called out softly, drawing him out of his thoughts. “Are you going to put your name down? Only I don't like the idea of us three going off and leaving you behind…”
Professor Snape’s arrival could not have been any timelier, Harry realised, as Fleur was forced to abandon her plan to curse or hex him for daring to humiliate her like he had.
It wasn’t all that surprising that the applause lasted for almost a full five minutes before Professor Dumbledore was finally able to restore order to the excited Hufflepuff students.
“Tomorrow night, on Halloween, the Goblet will return the names of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools,” Dumbledore continued with his rather lengthy explanation. “The Goblet will be placed in the Entrance Hall tonight, where it will be freely accessible to those wishing to compete. To ensure that no underage student yields to temptation I will be drawing an Age Line around the Goblet of Fire once it has been placed in the Entrance Hall. Nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross the line.”
A titter of giggles spread through the crowd as Gregory removed his hand, blushing furiously, moments before the ferret emerged from the bottom of Vincent’s trouser leg.

I was actually going to continue this chapter on a little bit longer but then I noticed a) how long it already was and b) how long it had been since I posted the ‘Prologue’ so here we go. I’ve actually been taking part in a writing challenge for the last month which is why I’m playing catch-up now with all my stories. Hope you enjoyed it. Comments welcome. X
Finally, after what felt like significantly longer than the two hours that the lesson had actually lasted, they were finally released and stumbled to their next lessons; the Hufflepuff's heading down to ‘

was a reasonably large goblet made of heavy hewn wood and appeared to contain flickering blue-white flames rather than a liquid.
“A joke?” Bagman repeated, obviously bewildered, before he forced out a high laugh as he smiled at the group. “No, no, not at all! Harry’s name just came out of the
Harry wasn't the only one to twist around in his seat, getting himself into a more comfortable position as he prepared to listen to what would undoubtedly be an unfortunately long winded explanation of the tournament. Long winded but necessary.
Harry winced as Professor Snape’s expression turned positively thunderous as he looked over the parchment, reading the words scratched onto it before checking the signature.
A cheer rang out, startling every single person in the room, and Draco turned along with everyone else to watch as two identical red haired boys, all gangly limbs and broad smiles, sped towards the crowd. Both of them had one hand raised almost triumphantly and after a moment Draco realised that they were holding identical potion vials filled with a blue liquid.
Whether or not they believed him seemed to have no bearing on how each of the four houses treated him, however; his fellow Gryffindor’s were overjoyed to have their own champion, particularly one with his unusual reputation, and kept on congratulating him.
“I think so,” Dumbledore confirmed, shooting a frown of concern towards the Minister of Magic. “Are you sure you wouldn’t like to stay at Hogwarts tonight, Barty? It’s no trouble.”
Between one breath and the next Ron’s expression became completely closed off, all traces of his faked smile disappearing as he pushed himself almost violently up onto his knees so that he could jerk his heavy bed-curtains with a passing comment, his voice flat and cold,
“If we would rather not be excluded from the end-of-year exams are we permitted to sit them? I’d rather not let the
Javier and Fabian had been a “thing” before Javier and Claude has become a “thing” and so tensions continued to be a little bit strained between the hot-heated Frenchman and the handsome Dutchman despite the fact that said Dutchman was now dating Jacques Jordan.
It would appear, Draco thought to himself as he obediently followed Madame Maxime out of the room, that his friend would be out of luck if she was at all serious about the interest she had expressed regarding Viktor Krum as his eyes had already been drawn elsewhere.
Testing the cascade of water with his left hand he smiled, finding it just shy of unbearably hot as he liked it, and moved so that his entire body was underneath the powerful spray. For a moment he simply stood there, face tilted up into the cascading water, and allowed the heat to relax his muscles and joints until his fingers actually began to tingle with numbness.
As much as she would have liked to reassure the two most important people in her life that she was alright she couldn’t, instead she found herself falling unexpectedly into the arms of her husband who quickly scooped her up into a bridal hold and carried her through to one of the pieces of furniture which had yet to be shrunken for transport to their new house.
The ex-Auror didn’t seem all that worried to be faced with the irate Head of Gryffindor who Harry genuinely suspected even Death Eaters would be afraid of as he responded calmly,
They’d agonised about where to go for their new start and had eventually decided to purchase a comfortable house in the magical village of
he greeted them politely, reaching out to open the door of the carriage before stepping out of the way so that they could enter first. “After you.”
“Couldn’t you have, you know, simplified this for us?” Ron enquired, sounding somewhat pained as he loaded his plate up for a second time. “Seriously, this is worse than Binns…”
A moment of silence passed between them before they began to giggle uncontrollably, their bodies shaking more and more as their giggling rapidly transformed into full blown laughter.
“Today we shall be returning to a subject we covered briefly at the end of last year; the treatment of Magic, so termed ‘
Gulping down the potion, identical grimaces flashing briefly on their faces, the twins wasted no time in jumping down from the bench, landing on the floor inside the glowing blue circle.
Some students had already given up, folding their arms on their desks and resting their heads upon them, and Harry was sorely tempted to join them. He was so very tired. His sleep had been disturbed for a number of reasons recently; visions sent by Voldemort, nightmares of his Godfather being captured and, most frequently, dreams of a significantly more erotic nature focused solely on the striking blonde haired student from Beauxbatons.
Draco watched, as fascinated as the rest of them, as Dumbledore drew his wand from within his robes, twirling it around his fingers for a long moment before tapping three times of the top of the casket. Nothing happened for a long moment and then the wood and metal just seemed to melt away, dissolving into thin air to reveal the item hidden inside.
Jan Boerefijn was very, very straight and something of a slut. He'd dated almost every girl in their year, Ramona included, and had slept with over half of them. Really, they should all hate him but he wasn't a horrible person, he didn't cheat on his girlfriends, his attentions never wandered from the person he was dating he just happened to date a lot. A lot a lot.
If he’d been getting attention before it was nothing compared to the way people were staring now that he had been joined by the foreign students given that in the short time they’d been there they’d already become notorious for keeping themselves to themselves.
Offering their friend’s one final wave the family apparated to the international apparation point, Severus apparating back to Hogsmeade village at the same moment. It was understandably busy at the international apparation point with people arriving and departing for both business and pleasure, sometimes families like the Malfoys, sometimes individual men and women dressed in their smartest robes. They checked in at the registration desk, Lucius handing over the parchment granting them their departure slot, and then made their way to the queue for the

Without a single ounce of conscious thought his hand, slick with moisturiser, moved down to stroke at the hardness growing rapidly between his legs. A soft gasp escaped him when a jolt of pleasure alerted him to what he had done, drawing his attention down to his waist.
“I'm going to apologise in advance, Harry,” Seamus muttered, picking up his wand when the class were instructed to do so. “Last time I did this I nearly set Dean on fire by accident so…”
, for crying out loud, and he had been looking forwards to someone else being the centre of attention for once.
,” she simpered loudly, imitating some of the younger Gryffindor’s who had spent breakfast fawning over him for all the world to see. “Got your autograph books? Better get a signature now because I highly doubt he’ll be around for much longer given that half of the Triwizard champions have died during the competition.”
, his eyes twinkling with merriment, and after a long moment the twins separated and helped each other to their feet, standing side by side before him. “I suggest you both go up to Madame Pomfrey. She is already tending to Miss Fawcett, of
“Yes,” Draco muttered, offering the gathered students a tight smile. He noticed out of the corner of his eye that the bushy haired girl was shooting the redhead a rather smug looking leading him to assume that he wasn't the first to point this out. “That's what I thought.”
“I think I've heard of it,” Ron mumbled from where he had already opened up his sandwiches and stuffed half of one in his mouth. “Ugh. Plum. Where is it? What country?”
“Yeah, Draco and Fleur are definitely cousins,” Ron explained around his mouthful of food. Hermione grimaced. “Their mums are sisters, I think, and the Malfoy’s were linked to the Dark Lord and his followers during the war, just like the DeLacour’s were…are. Although the Malfoy’s fled the country in the immediate aftermath, supposedly to escape prosecution.”
A sigh of relief escaped a large portion of the Great Halls occupants when the doors swing open to reveal Professor McGonagall leading a bedraggled gaggle of eleven year olds inside.
Exiting his bedroom Draco paused to pull the door shut before offering his arm to Ramona so that they could join the flow of students making their way towards the common room.
“Well, well, well,” the voice of the Fat Lady startled him out of his thoughts, taking him by surprise as he hadn’t realised how close he’d gotten to the
It was only then that Harry noticed that the other boy’s nails were painted the same purple as his house colour, the perfect layers of gloss catching in the light from the magical ceiling.
“Yeah,” Harry murmured, reminded of his manners by his muggleborn friend as he held Ginny steady in front of him as the girl wobbled. “Thanks for everything, Mrs Weasley.”
Penelope, or Madame Pomfrey as she should be known, arrived first and quickly set about healing the deep scratches to Narcissa’s face. It was a painful procedure, the spells she had to use causing her entire face to sting, but she grit her teeth and smiled through it for the sake of her son who watched everything closely. Severus arrived a moment later and began brewing a couple of potions, one to help with the pain and one to heal her broken ribs.
and, were he to actually be consulted, he would happily drop out of the dangerous tournament and leave it up to the older students.
swung open once more, this time admitting the unmistakable figure of Viktor Krum. He was followed closely by his own Headmaster, the notoriously Dark Wizard Igor Karkaroff, and one of his fellow Durmstrang students, a serious young man called Ivan Poliakoff who had the unfortunate “claim to fame” of being Karkaroff’s favourite nephew. This had, sadly, resulted in him being sent to live with the Dark Wizard after the sudden death of his mother when he was only a young child. His father had died
One by one the Slytherin’s tapped their badges, shifting them to the second message even as their cruel laughter echoed off of the stone walls surrounding them. Harry growled, his hands clenching into fists at his sides as the rest of his fellow Gryffindor’s arrived and took in the scene. Most of them shifted angrily but a couple, Ron included, merely smirked at him.
“I felt like an absolute fraud when it called my name out, knowing how much everyone else wants this opportunity compared to how little I really care about it,” he admitted softly, a smile blossoming on his face for theft time his name had been read out. “Will you help me?”
Unless they were like Draco who, unfortunately, was rapidly realising that perhaps he should have stayed back set
Chest heaving as his body trembled through the aftershocks of pleasure Draco moved back under the hot spray of the water, rinsing away the evidence of his pleasure as he frowned.
Draco's last task of settling in was to unpack his large collection of novels and short stories, filling every possible space with his books. He loved to lose himself in the wonderful worlds created in the various works of fiction, most of them surprisingly muggle in origin although he had collected all thirty-eight works by a witch called Ingrid Crawford. It had been his mother who had introduced him to his favourite author, however; the muggle Jane Austen, and as always her much read works were given pride of place on top of his bedside cabinet.
Draco, albeit rather reluctantly, obeyed. Plucking his jacket from where he had hung it over the back of his chair he slipped his arms into the sleeves before rolling his shoulders to get the garment properly situated, his hands tugging at the hem for a moment before moving to secure the buttons. Javier was less precise in his movements but the overall effect was the same, his uniform fitting him rather perfectly. Claude, on the other hand, spread his arms and legs out over the now empty bed like a starfish, rubbing his head against the pillows.
“Imagining things, am I? Seeing things, eh?” Moody growled, shifting his stance so that his artificial leg thudded loudly on the stone slab beneath their feet, the noise causing most of them to flinch. “It was a skilled witch or wizard who put the boy’s name in that
’ pin to his robes, making sure to use the existing hole in the fabric rather than create new ones witch would make it look unkempt.
Currently his one female friend, Ramona, was busy covering the walls and ceiling of his room with a mixture of brightly coloured drapes, magical posters and enchanted fairy lights. She hadn't asked permission to do so just as she wouldn't have asked permission to “sort out” her brother, Javier's, room or the room of the final member of their quartet, Claude.
“Draco,” Madame Maxime called out, drawing his attention away from the excited official. “It is time for us to return to the carriage. Your classmates will wish to congratulate you.”
“Like them, Potter?” Fleur sneered triumphantly as Harry slowed to a halt beside Hermione whose cheeks were flushed with anger. “And this isn’t all they do, you know? Here! Look!”
“Huh…” Harry mumbled softly, returning his gaze to the wizard he now knew significantly more about. “That’s…good to know…and somewhat concerning…do you think he’s…dark?”
the same and don’t let me get started on the rules they have regarding their hair. And nail polish is completely forbidden.”
and now it was simply a matter of waiting to see whose name would eventually be selected. Madame Maxime seemed to be exceptionally pleased with their performance, offering Igor Karkaroff a smug smile. The Headmaster of
Harry was still struggling to process the fact that there were apparently other magical schools no one had ever bothered to tell him about whilst Hermione and Ron argued about the practicalities of “hiding” and entire school. This argument, of course, led to an entirely too factual explanation from Hermione about the various techniques they could have used.
“Bloody hell…” Ron grumbled, shaking the water off of his hands after Professor McGonagall had arrived at the scene of the crime, her threat to fetch the Headmaster enough to send the poltergeist on his way but not before bed dropped the last of his water bombs on a group of second years who had just hurried in through the doors. “I hope he got Fleur…”
Add to that the fact that they shared the lesson with Fleur DeLacour and the rest of her Slytherin cronies and Double Potions had taken on something akin to a session of torture.
Both of his companions laughed, loading up their plates from the variety of foods laid out on the table in front of them. They were from Beauxbatons, judging by their blue uniforms, and he recognised them as being friends of the Draco Malfoy, their schools champion; thankfully there was no sign of the handsome blond who’d featured far too often in his dreams lately.
Personally Harry thought that anyone who was under the age of seventeen and still wanted to put their name in for such a notoriously dangerous competition was clinically insane.
“The first task is designed to test your daring,” the Minister of Magic announced after a couple of false starts. He looked, well, ill if Draco were being bluntly honest; his skin was ashen and wrinkled, his hair was limp and there were large black bags underneath his dull eyes. “So we aren’t going to be telling you what it is. Courage in the face of the unknown quality in any wizard…very important…” He trailed off for a moment, his eyes glistening strangely as he looked at each of the champions in turn. “The first task will take place on November the twenty-fourth, in front of the other students and the panel of judges. The champions are not permitted to ask for or accept help of any kind from their teachers to complete the tasks in the
And didn’t that cause all of their hearts to clench, that Draco was old enough for one of his fears to be of people wearing masks. This no doubt stemmed from the times he’d accidently witness his father returning from performing tasks for the Dark Lord wearing his distractive and purposefully frightening Death Eater mask. It had scared Narcissa the first time she’d seen it so no doubt it had scared their son, the metallic skull lingering in his young mind.
rather than just skim the various bits they’d needed to review during their History of Magic classes during their First Year as Harry himself had done had known that there were at least eleven schools of Witchcraft and Wizardry before the arrival of the foreign students. Some of the schools weren’t listed by name in ‘
They blinked at each other for a long moment before Draco finally offered the younger Wizard a subtle nod of acknowledgement just before he finally exited the crowded room.
following the evening meal. Anyone who had entered their name was on tenterhooks as to whether or not the honour and pressure would fall upon them and Draco was certainly no exception. Bidding the girls farewell he exited to common room and headed straight for his bedroom, nodding to JJ as he passed the other boy in the corridor, and then once he was alone in the privacy of his room he dropped his bag down onto his desk, shrugged off his uniform jacket which went over the back of his chair, loosened his tie, popped open the top few buttons of his shirt.
He looked positively delighted about this fact so it was no surprise when a short while later the tiny boy was sorted into Gryffindor, sprinting to join his brother with an infectious laugh.
“Mr Bagman and Mr Crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months on the arrangements for the
Draco had never been more relieved to learn that Madame Maxine would be personally overseeing their lessons for the duration of the
Harry wasn’t the only one fighting to hide a burst of uncontrollable laughter as Professor McGonagall returned Fleur DeLacour to her rightful state with a flick of her wand and a muttered incantation, the dishevelled girl appearing in an ungainly heap on the floor with her skirt up around her waist revealing her inappropriately skimpy knickers for all to see.
Once Draco Malfoy had followed Krum into the side chamber silence was called for once more only this time when it fell it was different, the level of tension and anticipation rising with each passing second as the gathered students waited for the final draw to happen.
“It’s no one’s fault but Potter’s, Karkaroff,” Snape positively delighted in placing the blame exactly where he thought it should go. Typical. “Don’t go blaming Dumbledore for Potter’s determination to break rules. He has been crossing lines ever since he arrived here –”
Her sister’s trial was all the newspapers seemed to care about these days and quite rightly so, the things that she and her three accomplices had done were utterly despicable. It horrified her to think that someone with whom she shared so much more than merely blood could be capable of such a thing, of torturing a young couple who had welcomed a child into the world only the year before to the point where their minds had broken. Frank and Alice Longbottom would spend the rest of their lives in a secure ward inside St Mungo’s leaving their infant son as much of an orphan as Harry Potter, the ‘Boy-Who-Lived.’
This, combined with the ever rising level of stress he was experiencing, left him even more distracted than usual, particularly during lessons which he found a challenge at the best of times. As time went on, however, he began to struggle in the lessons he usually did well in.
It was a bit of a mad scramble after that, everyone hurrying into the classroom to take their seats as they’d been ordered to, and in the end it was poor Neville who lost the five points.
Lara muttered something in her native Luxembourgish before calling out, “That’s disgusting, Thierry. For future reference please, please keep the movements of your bowel to yourself.”
Helping himself to a healthy portion of scrambled eggs on toast Harry settled down on the long wooden bench beside Ron and opposite Hermione. The first year Gryffindor on his other side gave a little “eep” of excitement before leaning in to whisper in his friend’s ear.
Her mother’s face had turned almost purple with barely controlled rage, her top lip curled into a vicious snarl while if anything her father’s complexion had turned completely ashen.
“Wonder why that was?” Harry muttered, cutting her off as the pair of them sidestepped to allow Cedric Diggory and his ever present gaggle of supporters to pass unchallenged. Most of the group were girls who until the moment they’d spotted Harry had been simpering and sighing over Cedric; once they’d noticed the younger student who threatened their chosen champion’s position they diverted their attention to him in the form of glares and sneers. A bitter sigh escaped him once they’d passed them by. “Honestly, why do people still think that I want all of this? News flash; I don’t. Ah, well, never mind that now; Double Potions to look forward to this afternoon and we both know that that’s going to be an
?!” Ron muttered incredulously, glaring at the transparent figure floating in front of the vast chalkboard at the front of the classroom. “We spent most of last year learning about the flaming ‘
“Snape?” Harry wondered, thinking through those he knew to be affiliated with the Dark Lord. “Karkaroff? But he seemed genuinely angry…course, he could have been acting…”
Stepping into the main entrance hall of the unfamiliar school Draco felt as though he’d been transported back in time and
Harry smiled to himself as he slipped into one the seats left available in the tiered seating along the wall nearest the door, finding himself next to Seamus. He'd been so worried about his friends would react, had put off telling them so many times, and now he could help but wonder why? Why had he been so afraid to tell them when they had reacted precisely the way he had both hope and expected them to; Ron, blustering but understanding, Hermione, relying on her knowledge but also understanding. Why had he been so worried?
Draco frowned as a sudden realisation hit him and then he couldn't help but burst out laughing, an action which only seemed to annoy the already irate Slytherin even further.
“I’d rather like to know that myself, Dumbledore,” said Professor Karkaroff, moving to stand by Viktor Krum. Harry did not like the way his blue eyes had all but frozen over, a feeling of lead polling in his stomach. “
“Auror?” Dean Thomas, one of the few students in Harry's year and house who had been raised in an entirely muggle household like he had enquired, obviously as clueless about the title as Harry himself was. There was some debate about whether or not Dean’s father, who had died when he was young, had been a wizard but nothing had ever been confirmed. The boy in question was more than happy to consider himself a muggleborn like Hermione, supporting his favourite football team vigorously and regularly becoming completely obsessed with muggle television shows and movies when he went home for the holidays.
“Oh, it was my pleasure, dears,” said Mrs Weasley. “I'd invite you for Christmas, but…well, I expect you're all going to want to stay at Hogwarts, what with…one thing and another.”
“I might be seeing you all sooner than you think,” Charlie, Ron’s second oldest brother, chuckled brightly when they returned from storing their trunks in the guards van. Still grinning he reached out to give Ginny, Ron’s younger sister and the first female born into the Weasley family for generations, a hug so tight he accidentally lifted her off of her feet.
“I am over twat-face,” Draco sighed deeply. “But that doesn't mean you can set me up with whoever you think would be good for me. If I find someone I want to date
“We’ll be expecting you around for Sunday lunch next week, Severus,” she informed him firmly, stepping forwards in order to press a kiss to his cheek. “12 o’clock. Don’t be late.”
As he was making his way across the freshly cut grass between the stone courtyard and the carriage he was joined by two of his fellow
“How this situation arose, we do not know,” Dumbledore continued, his voice back to its usual calm level as he surveyed the people gathered in two distinct groups in the room; teachers and students. “It seems to me, however, that we have no choice but to accept it.”
“Yeah, the taste will linger for a while,” Harry explained apologetically, watching as Claude reached across to pick up the offending sandwich so that he could take a bite himself. He chewed, humming before swallowing and going in for a second bite, smiling over at Javier who let out an indignant cry. Harry chuckled, “Marmite; you either love it or you hate it.”
“We give detentions, Moody! Or speak to the offender’s Head of House! We don’t transform them into…into an animal and torture them in front the student population!”
Hannah let out a murmur of sympathy even as Harry flinched, his mind supplying him with an image of the events which had taken place in their ‘
“My mother wasn’t best pleased with our decision,” she mumbled in response, reaching down to scoop her now weeping son up onto her lap. She couldn’t hide the wince of pain. “I wasn’t expecting quite this sort of a reaction but I knew it wasn’t going to be pleasant…”
Claude mumbled something unintelligible in response, already more asleep than awake, and within a couple of minutes the couple were sound asleep as though nothing had happened.
“I wish I could,” he admitted softly, a look of genuine regret on his less than handsome yet still pleasantly striking features. “Not only have I entered into a teaching contract at Hogwarts I cannot abandon her child any sooner than you could abandon yours.”
