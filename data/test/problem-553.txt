doing here?” Harry gestured toward Stan’s forearm.
“Thanks,” he said. She looked to be holding up OK, and Harry admired her strength. “You’re too good, Mrs. Weasley.”
“It wasn’t fair for any of us to expect it from you either,” Neville admitted. Harry appreciated the sentiment. It was something he had raged against when he learnt of the prophesy, but he had mostly come to accept it. He wouldn’t have made the horcrux if he hadn’t. It had not been fair for the wizarding world to place such a task on the shoulders of a child, but Harry had long ago learned and accepted that the world was unfair. Still, he wanted something better for Neville. The other man was too kind-hearted to be burdened with the responsibility of someone’s death.
Once Harry finished his shower, he hovered in case he was needed. He also didn’t want to risk running into Burke without backup. It was not the Gryffindor behaviour he was known for, but Albert’s injuries were a stark reminder of what Burke would happily enjoy doing to them all.
Harry agreed with Malfoy’s assessment of the food being bland. The texture of the mystery meat bothered Harry just as much as its look did. However, Harry once again compared it to staying with the Dursleys. He was at least getting a full meal and he didn’t have to do the cooking.
“Bloody hell, Gin!” Ron groaned.
Andromeda reached out and clasped his hand. She watched him watch his teacup while she considered how to respond.
“Look,” Harry cut her off. He was growing impatient, but more embarrassed. Despite being muffled by his sleeve, Harry was certain Lucius and Albert were hearing the whole conversation. “Go get Theo. He’ll vouch for me.”
“-fine,” Harry heard the tail-end of whatever Theo had just said.
“You think I fear Dumbledore?” asked Jugson. “What can he do to me while I’m in here?”
It was harder than he imagined convincing Hermione to allow him to meet Ginny. She knew the risk, and thought Harry was stupid for even considering it. She also understood the desire behind it. Not the horcrux part, but the desire to be with the people you loved. Ultimately, she conceded and helped him arrange their meeting.
Hours later, they comfortably snuggled with Draco’s head resting on Harry’s chest. Harry considered opening the champagne Draco had left beside the bed, but didn’t want to move. Draco was equally disinclined as it would mean letting go of Harry’s hand, and he wasn’t finished admiring the ring it now displayed.
“Not attack. Not exactly. But James, he’s me. He’s my horcrux,” Harry said.
“And not as love-blind as Rodo here,” added Mulciber. “It’s refreshing to hear that you see the bad with the good. I’ve met Draco and he can be a prick.”
“What are you talking about?” Harry looked between the two. “Please,” he added when he sensed their reluctance to explain.
could hurt me so. I know we were estranged, but I spent years
There was comfort in knowing someone could see Harry’s darker side, at least a portion of it, and not be disgusted by him. As far as Draco knew, he didn’t think it was so bad that he had to fix Harry. Everyone else seemed to be waiting for Harry to snap out of his funk, but Draco thought who Harry was at the moment was good enough.
“It’s no more of a risk than creating pictures, and hairbrushes and whatnot,” Harry said. He levitated the letter towards him before Lucius could add any more token protests. Harry used a mild sticking charm to ensure the rolled-up letter wouldn’t unravel. He added another sticking charm to keep the letter on the inside of his shirt. He didn’t know when Hale would be back, so he had to keep the letter on his person. At Albert’s suggestion, he also added a notice-me-not charm.
“Which one is the raunchy one?” asked Goyle. Harry suspected he’d read that one, despite Harry’s warning, if Draco gave him the chance to.
“Remarkable,” he praised.
Draco carefully watched Harry dig in to the carefully marked slice. The minute it took Harry to find the ring would go down on his top five most stressful moments. He had just enough time to rethink his plan, suddenly worried Harry would swallow it whole without realizing it was there. He relaxed minutely when he saw Harry furrow his brows and spit the ring into his napkin in a more graceful manner than he would have before he dated Draco. Harry’s breath hitched as it registered what he was looking at, and Draco prepared to propose.
Harry let out a disgusted noised and turned his head away from the man. It gave Scrimgeour just the right angle to see the edge of Harry’s new tattoo peaking over the collar of his shirt. The minister let out a shocked gasp. Although suddenly embarrassed and ashamed, Harry took it as a sign that Burke’s actions were not ministry approved. He hoped it was enough to get Burke fired, but considering Umbridge still had her job, Harry wasn’t going to hold his breath.
“You’ll find that many of the guards like to play mind games. They eagerly exercise whatever small amount of power they have,” Malfoy explained.
“I already mailed hers,” Harry reassured him. “There are only yours left. And Bellatrix’s,” Harry said, unable to mask his displeasure at her name. “I trust you can find a way to get them to your aunt,” he said to Draco.
Harry focused on the parts of that night that were the most likely to fit with Hale’s plan.
Harry let out a relieved breath and several tears flowed. The guards that noticed assumed he was reliving the memory. In truth, Harry was touched that Lucius was trying to protect him despite what he’d just done.
“No, the dementors are definitely the worst,” another voice responded. “At least for anyone who isn’t an animagus. I’d take a beating any day over reliving
“It’s better not to,” hedged Harry.
Harry was glad that Mr. Weasley got his job back. Without his salary the family would have been financially crippled. If Ron and Ginny had been arrested, the Weasleys likely would not have been able to afford a judicial-wizard.
“Fuck,” he said into her hair, “you smell good.”
While Lucius wrote, Albert had Harry explain the spell work behind his gifts. Half an hour later, Lucius set aside the quill and rolled up his parchment.
“You should create illusions for your own injuries,” suggested Lucius. Maintaining that many illusions on both of them would normally strain a wizard’s magic. For once, Harry though that might be a good thing if it helped lessen the negative feelings that having Burke’s soul in him caused.
None of the men knew if that specific variation of spell existed.
Slowly the common room emptied out as students retired for the night. Hermione was the last to leave him. Harry told her he wanted to finish at least one more assignment before going to bed. Knowing exactly how many Harry had, she didn’t argue but asked that he go to sleep soon with a worried look on her face.
“Shut it, Potter, I’ll deal with you next,” Burke promised. He spelled Albert’s cell door open and stepped over to the prisoner. Burke pushed Albert into the wall before spelling the man’s hands to lock behind his back.
“Potter, you might be – a teeny tiny bit – alright after all,” she said.
“We already knew I was damaged,” Harry said.
“Right, I suppose Draco should go first,” Theo said. Harry was surprised Theo was willing to wait since he was the only one who knew what was about to happen.
he was. He was about to destroy that. He wouldn’t be able to hide anymore.
“Certainly not,” Parkinson said and protectively stepped in front of Draco. Harry blinked at her in surprise.
“Yeah,” Harry said softly and regretted bringing it up. Just because they wanted to help Harry with the horcrux in him, didn’t mean that they would be happy to hear about how he had already destroyed one of their dark lord’s horcruxes. Unfortunately, they were all now curious about it. Harry hesitantly added, “the diary”.
“Deserved or not, she would fight back,” warned Lestrange. Harry realized that the man was genuinely trying to warn Harry off. Harry wasn’t sure if he should feel flattered or horrified that that the man thought he was going to go out and start using dark curses.
Sorry for making you wait so long for this chapter. I haven’t abandoned this story, but I can’t make any promises about when I’ll update it. I wanted to thank everyone who has been leaving encouragement. To make up for the delay, this chapter is longer and features naked Harry... though sadly there isn’t a matching naked Draco (is Lucius close enough?).
Inspired by Lestrange choosing one of his wife’s favourite spell, Lucius decided to review a spell that had amused Draco as a child, long before he had attended Hogwarts.
Harry was taken aback, not expecting that, especially from his dour professor. The other professors gave Harry time to mull over the suggestion.
“We do not see colours like humans do,” answered Asherath, “I believe the term you use is colourblind.”
“Hale will be happy to represent you,” he informed Harry. “He wanted me to inform you that he was heading straight to the ministry to start the process.”
“What’s interesting?” ventured Harry. He figured as terrible as the notion was, he already had their attention. He reckoned he had nothing to lose by trying to get them to answer his questions.
For the next several months, Draco updated Harry on interesting soul magic spells and rituals he’d discovered. Nothing directly helped solve the horcrux concern. Harry was a little disappointed but understood Draco’s analogy of being at a first-year level of knowledge on this branch of magic, while horcruxes were advanced seventh year stuff. He knew it could take years to have any solid answers... assuming it was even possible at all.
“This is getting us nowhere,” said a witch. “Potter, were you and Burke the only ones in the cell aside from the dementor?”
“Lucius? How does Lucius have a mirror in his cell. No, don’t answer that,” Nott said with wide eyes. Harry was glad he didn’t have to elaborate.
Hagalaz: transformation, egg of life, hail, wrath of nature, uncontrolled forces. I skewed it because the other char's tats are. Also, I find it fits with my plans for the story, but perhaps not in the intended way... I know I'm being vague but don't want to spoil anything.
“Draco might not be as opposed to it as you think,” Lucius was picking his words carefully as he considered how much to reveal about his son’s feelings. When Mulciber laughed, Lucius felt he had to add on “in a relationship, not just a…”
, Draco. I hurt Ginny. And maybe James too – no, James is OK. He’s the only one OK because he doesn’t know. I don’t know what the side-effects are, but I’m OK. Well, I’m not crazy like
His friends temporarily distracted Harry from his fantasies, but they returned full force once everyone retired for the night. Harry found that he didn’t mind his insomnia so much when he had pleasant thoughts to occupy his mind. Harry’s thoughts especially lingered on that brief hug.
For all the months of planning, the day itself went by quickly. Harry stood where he was told to, spoke when he been prompted, and spent the day in awe that it was actually happening. He said as much in his vows. He also reiterated that he feared he’s not worthy of Draco but will spend the rest of his life trying to be. Draco’s vows centered on acceptance and growing into better versions of themselves through mutual support. He finished off with “I’d gladly merge our souls into one, as you already complete me in every other sense.” It probably sounded like sentimental drivel to everyone else, but Harry saw the promise for what it was. Draco’s research in soul magic revealed ways to connect two souls. He would happily join Harry in a very different kind of marriage ceremony if asked. Should Harry ever get tired to feeling incomplete without his soul after the horcrux, Draco would share his to fill in all the empty spaces in Harry. Harry would never ask him to give such an important piece of himself, but it meant everything to know that Draco would.
“It was a difficult birth, correct?” asked Draco.
“He could have fallen down the stairs. Accidents happen,” said Runecraft.
“Are we sure they were the only ones there?” asked Ito.
“No… he, well, he told Bellatrix not to curse us,” Harry said. He knew it was more to preserve the orb than any concern for their wellbeing, but he saw how Hale would reframe what had happened. With Bellatrix as the villainous leader, the others were helpless not to follow orders, however reluctantly, though they tried to stop any harm from occurring to the hapless children. Harry tried to answer Hale’s question with this idea in mind. He knew his friends wouldn’t be happy if they found out Harry was willingly going along with it, but perhaps he could pretend his words had been twisted if it became an issue.
“I told you the other prisoners taught me these subjects. Lucius covered charms,” Harry said. For a moment Harry was tempted to tell them he’d been able to cover more than just the theory. He held back because doing so would mean explaining the whole soul eating part and he feared their reactions. It wasn’t a mostly failed crucio casting that his target had laughed off. He took Burke’s soul and would never be able to give it back. Worse, he was damaging the soul each time he used magic. He feared what they would say if they knew.
recount his interactions with Draco over and over in his head. And Draco just kept taking up more and more space as Harry tried to figure out what he was up to this year. Worry slowly overtook anger as the primary emotion attached to his rival. As of late, Draco had looked more and more tired and stressed. He even stopped putting effort into his looks, which was a warning bell to anyone that knew him. Of course, coming to that realization had made Harry confront the fact that he’d always thought of Draco as attractive. He still was, even with bags under his eyes. Draco looked like he could use a good night’s sleep, but that particular line of thinking was probably best to follow when Harry wasn’t sitting in front of Draco’s father.
“Potter, don’t be absurd. Cufflinks should be heirloom.” The cold tone was back. Dammit, not how the plan was supposed to be working. He put his glasses back on to see Malfoy’s face—which was absolutely expressionless.
Draco fixed her with a stare. “I am eminently faultable. Especially to Potter.”
“Wait, you think that’s how I’d—”
“They said this was, you know, in the mug—non-magical world, you know, alright, that is, but, here, Sirius, a Black—”
Draco’s eyes lit up. “Right, the sex ed things!”
Eye contact, lick lips, drop squat, run hands through hair, point at Malfoy, keep the eye contact going, wink. And, scene.
“Actually,” Ron said, his eyes lighting up, “Mione mentioned that she was craving salad caprese. So I’ve been thinking—” and here he made a kind of rainbow gesture with his hands, “Caprese with green mango.”
Seven hours later the Great Hall rebounded with noise as the students caught up with friends after a long summer away. Harry rested his chin in his hand and pretended to not notice the stares directed his way at the head table. He had made an attempt with his hair and was buttoned into his navy-blue robes.
But it wasn’t nevermind, really, Susan realized, because she was entwining her long fingers through Susan’s unruly hair and dropping her chin down onto Susan’s shoulder and reading the letter.
It meant not drunk, not when it could be written off as an accident or a mistake. It meant Draco wanted him with his body and soul, to love and be loved in return.
“Oh, no, please,” he said, and shifted to awkwardly wrap one arm around her. She turned her face against his chest and sobbed. “Don’t cry.”
The rest of the evening passed unremarkably. Harry acted surprised when Ron pulled out his portable wizard chess set and tried to keep his mind on the game.
“Your mum, though?”
♚ Sirius
◼Tell Skeeter to fuck off with the vampire angle
“A lion, really?”
“It’s an expression,” Harry said sharply. “I taught it to my sixth-years last week. Important Muggle slang.”
◻ ron’s birthday → ☑ text h re: tacos?! ↔ ☑ text florian re: tacos if h yes // people to invite: ginny, luna, florian, seamus, dean, nev (+ blaise?), george, percy (???) set up floo for fred (time zones??) party games ???
She saw a flash of the old Draco in how he poured their tea, raising the pot higher and higher until Pansy was sure he would spill. But it wasn’t the same as when he’d levitate the Malfoy silver until she snorted into her petit-four.
Elspeth folded her hands and pressed them together. “Sir, we did it with Professor Malfoy last week.”
It wasn’t half-bad.
Harry turned their attention to the biscuit tin.
“Gay, Potter, very fucking gay. I’ve known since I was eleven.”
The impression of her lips remained on Susan’s forehead, the skin disturbed—like the blood had risen or puckered or—Astoria pressed her hands to her mouth.
They were centimeters away from each other.
She got up, grabbed Harry’s elbow, and steered them out of the kitchen, babbling about how lovely the sun was in the morning and wasn’t it rare to have a sunny morning and so lucky on the day of the fête, too.
“What is that?”
Harry snorted.
“Giving up already, how tedious,” Malfoy said in a drawl. “Oh, how one’s ickle altruism can go awry, that even the bravest Gryffindor—”
URGENT HELP IMMEDIATE RESPONSE NEEDED
“Not like this,” Draco had said.
He stalked to his bedside table and opened the drawer.
That explained nothing about their relationship. Cool. It’s good and totally chill. Parvati didn’t owe her shit, like, truly, and Lavender was going to be super happy about the fact that she had some kind of boyfriend—she hadn’t seen a ring, but she also couldn’t double-check right now because Parvati’s hands were anchored in the pockets of her maroon pants—but right now she wanted to get plastered. That was the chill, fun explanation.
Wait, were they the same animal?
The following weeks compressed into a repetitive pattern: wake up, eat, teach, spar with Draco at lunch, teach, WAWFAN  meetings where he and Draco would argue more, maybe a nightcap with Draco (he needed to buy more scotch), bathe, sleep, repeat.
Hermione waited until he emerged from the sweater. She’d sat down on the arm of the sofa.
“Having a lovely birthday?” Val asked, pushing a glass of water across the bar to Harry.
I NEED YOU TO TEACH ME NON-MAGICAL DANCE STEPS IN THE NEXT TWO DAYS SO I CAN PERFORM THEM PERFECTLY BY SATURDAY !!!!!!!!! ALSO WHAT DOES XX MEAN
Lavender adjusted her miniskirt. She stopped by the iron gate and pressed one hand against the pilaster. Out of the mumbling of the thousands who’d passed through these gates, a clarion voice rose up, repeating that this was the Greengrass estate, that visitors were welcome and would enjoy hospitality without limits.
Shooting him another two-fingered salute, Harry leapt up the stairs. His heart was racing by the time he reached his own door. His hands were shaking as he turned the knob. This was mental, absolutely mental. He ran a bath and examined his undressed body in the mirror. What the fuck did that tosser mean by lanky. He was fit. He’d pulled before. Even after Ginny, he could get blokes in Muggle clubs. Loads of blokes. Whenever he wanted. They didn’t know he was famous. He narrowed his eyes and flexed. Fuck Malfoy.
Astoria looked blank.
“Professor Malfoy,” Harry said finally, and held out his hand to Draco.
Draco shrugged. “Won’t be the first time.”
So. He didn’t want to be bothered. Well, Harry would respect that.
He shook out his own napkin and tucked two pieces of treacle tart inside.
“What, what happened?”
“But—Parkinson?”
“I hardly know what that woman is thinking at any given time. She’s just about as loony as Lovegood.”
But this article isn’t about dragon behavior—it’s about humans. Weasley, who turned 35 on the day of this interview, has identified as asexual since he learned about it at age 25.
The front door opened.
The gesture scattered a trail of rainbow colored crumbs across his robe.
“Ms. Black, yes, lovely, so, we’ve been working on ways to release Draco and Astoria from the blood marriage contract,” she said, gesturing towards a levitating blackboard covered with runes and alchemical symbols.
Malfoy was blushing and shaking his head.
Draco was observing his coat with distaste. “You can see my trousers.”
Harry exited the Great Hall without looking back. Malfoy was still shorter than him. He could run to catch up. Put his wee legs to good use. He wouldn’t speak first, he decided. Let Malfoy beg for his friendship.
Andy turned away from the still flaming pot, and Sirius, taking his chance, extinguished it with a quick
“But if you see Claude, take at least twenty points! He’s trouble, that one. Just like his dad. Absolutely no regard for the rules.” Giggling to herself, she wandered away, gathering Filius in her wake of trailing yellow robes. Once again, Harry wondered how someone who was more on the Lovegood end of the dreamy-to-sensible spectrum could teach DADA.
Malfoy cracked his neck obnoxiously. “The equipment tends to help.”
He looked old, shifting from foot to foot beside Neville, his hands almost vibrating with the suppressed urge to fiddle. He’d been a bit of a tit, but, what kid brought up to pureblood nonsense would turn out with an ounce of sense? And they’d all been complicit in that, letting the wounds of unchallenged hatred fester. She ground her teeth.
He’d promised Padma. Chance number three, here we go. Be the bigger man. No, don’t think about that. Nope. Eyes forward, Potter.
Tightening his fingers around the snitch, Harry urged his broom downwards. Malfoy was almost jerked off his broom, but he clung to Harry with one hand and his broom with the other.
“When you die,” Remus said tartly.
◼Commit to a signature scent
“Harry,” he’d whispered, “this man can let the other autos know what he’s thinking.”
The weeks leading up to the Winter Ball had loosed a frenzied storm of dating among the fourth-years and up—no one wanted to go to the Ball alone, even though Harry had started sprinkling his lessons with the joys of singledom and how it was much better to go with friends than to latch onto the nearest warm body—and Harry was getting rather frantic himself about the rising misery of his kids. He started wishing they didn’t even have a damn winter dance and began hinting to Minerva that it was causing them too much anxiety. He wilted under her glare and her acerbic reminiscence that he’d already booked the DJ and unless he was personally willing to refund two hundred Galleons to MC Hippogriff, and inform all the students that he, Harry James Potter, was the driving force behind its cancellation (he didn’t even dare to imagine the painful revenge Britney would wreak), the Winter Ball was going ahead as planned.
Harry could have been blown over by a stiff breeze – he could count the number of times Malfoy had apologised to him on the fingers of one hand, and none had been said as passionately as this. And on top of that, what he’d said, or at least suggested, about his feelings for Harry…it was a lot to take in.
If he was braver he’d go and confront Malfoy, but he didn’t think he could bear the thought of Malfoy saying he believed everything he’d read, that he thought Harry was a coward and a cheat. And if he was braver even still, he’d go and apologise, try to make up, tell Malfoy they could work it out.
As always, Pansy talked a mile a minute, barely letting Harry get a word in edgeways; she reminded him of Hermione in this respect. There had been a strange day soon after the war, after both girls had joined the ministry, where they’d had to work together, along with the Aurors. Both Ron and Harry had been gobsmacked to see them getting on well, until it had suddenly clicked – both girls valued information and knowledge (although Hermione preferred facts and Pansy favoured gossip) and both girls would do anything to get what they wanted. Hermione and Pansy were highly intelligent, determined and fierce. It was no wonder Hermione and Pansy were so close.
“What about you?”
“So, Malfoy, dating anyone at the moment?” Ron asked, still sat beside Hermione on the sofa opposite.
“Haven’t they got anything better to write about?” Harry, relieved the article wasn’t anything worse, as it had been in the past, smiled at Malfoy. He didn’t smile back.
“Look at us, look at us…who’d have thunk we’d end up here?” Neville slurred. “I’m a ladies’ man! I’m popular with the ladies! And Ron, wow, you’re a married man! And you’re about to be a dad!”
“Well, that sounds like your cousin Cressida, doesn’t it? Trying to write a book again, I suppose.”
It was only after a long day of research with Malfoy that Harry stepped back into his flat and immediately tensed at sounds of movement come from further in his flat. Thinking of the box hidden under his bed and the wand stuffed unceremoniously into his pocket, he took a deep breath and stormed into the kitchen, hands glowing red, ready with a curse, only to come face to face with Neville Longbottom.
Luna’s dress and Ginny’s dress were made in the exact same style – long and flowing, lace and silk, with a flowing train behind. Luna’s was pale blue (“the sky in winter” Luna called it) and Ginny’s was startling silver. Harry had never been so proud and full of love for his friends.
Harry sat back down at the end of the bed when he was done getting changed – it had been years since he’d stayed the night with someone (since Ginny, and that relationship had never felt so new and raw) and he didn’t know what to do.
“Isn’t she going to explain where she’s going?” Malfoy, baffled, asked a proud but confused Ron, steadfastly ignoring Harry.
Again, Harry was at a loss for words. It didn’t matter whether he wanted it to be a date (which was a conversation he didn’t really fancy having, with himself or anybody else) because it wasn’t a date.
“Well, there must be a way to find him! What about looking through old Ministry records to find children of Ministry officials?”
“Cressida Boone believed you were being murdered, and nobody was noticing. But last week she went missing.”
“Potter. Look.” Malfoy gestured to the other side of the large double bed Susan had died in. Harry looked dumbly for a moment, before he realised.
Harry hit the ground with a thump, rolling onto his stomach with a groan just in time for Malfoy to land on top of him. Both men threw themselves apart with grunts of embarrassment as Hermione fell to the floor, stomach shielded by Ron. They all picked themselves up, brushing dirt and dust as they took in their surroundings.
“We’re here now, aren’t we?”
“That’d be no help, it’d take too long and we might not even find him. We might as well try asking McGonagall, she’s been around so long!” Harry joked, and he and Ron snorted at the idea of the Headmistress as a crime fighter, but Hermione shot up out of her seat.
“It is right. Thank you, Luna.” Harry hugged her, tightly, feeling calm for the first time since his nightmare.
“No, of course not.” Hermione replied, not offended, smiling across at him as he stood and, clutching his pile of papers, headed to the door.
“Yeah, I can’t believe I didn’t see it until then. I’ve probably liked you for months, though.”
“It was?”
It was going to be a magical day. The day of Ginny and Luna’s wedding had finally arrived, and nobody knew quite what to expect – both women had been very tight-lipped about the details. Ron was Ginny’s Best Man, and Harry was Luna’s. Hermione was Maid of Honour for both, and so she had recruited Malfoy as a helping hand or, as Luna put it, Secondary Maid duties.
“So then what was it?”
“Hello, Harry.”
“You’re always getting yourself into trouble. I don’t know how you do it, Potter.”
“Of course. Now, go. I don’t want Granger hexing me because she thinks I’ve kidnapped you.” He was mostly joking, but it was true that many Ministry officials had a healthy mix of fear and respect for Hermione Granger.
Malfoy coughed but didn’t reply, instead holding out his arm for Harry to clutch as they spun away, landing in a dark alley. Malfoy led Harry out of the alley towards an old-looking pub named The King’s Head.
“Malfoy. You’re in love with Malfoy.” And suddenly everything made sense. A bolt of electricity shot through him.
Malfoy frowned for a moment, staring over Harry’s shoulder, sipping his beer.
“Then don’t talk about me that way!”
Knowing what he did about Malfoy’s bad history with Greyback, Harry couldn’t help watching him carefully through lowered eyelashes, searching for glimpses of the vulnerability he’d seen last week. He wasn’t disappointed – Malfoy’s pale skin was more snow than marble, and his fingers, wrapped tightly around his wand, were trembling.
“Why?”
“Hey, Hermione.” Harry greeted cheerfully, closing her office door behind her. He rarely came to her office on Level Four nowadays (she mostly came down to Level Two to see both Harry and Ron in one fell swoop) and he’d almost forgotten how overwhelming it was. Obsessively tidy and neat, every single inch of wall was bookshelves, with hundreds of books in alphabetical order. Her desk was littered with countless labelled folders and there were boxes, stacked waist height, of case files in organised lines.
“She seemed off. I don’t know how to describe it. Something about the way she looked at me. Like there was something else going on inside her head that I couldn’t get at.”
“Hermione is great, isn’t she?” Harry noticed that Ron had detached himself from the group and was watching Harry talk to Francoise.
“Even so, that is incredibly lame.” Malfoy, still snorting, replied. He pulled a stiff white piece of card from his pocket and showed it to Harry. Engraved on it, in black spidery font, were the names of Pansy and Blaise, along with their address and a time.
“I guess not…not at the moment, anyway. So, it’s Dark magic.”
A few minutes later they found themselves standing in a small, dark alley cordoned off by muggle police tape. The murder had happened only a few days ago, and although the muggles didn’t realise what it was, the connection to the other cases had been made. They’d pretended to be muggle cops from London, Malfoy’s idea, actually, which had worked surprisingly well. It surprised Harry to realise Malfoy must pay more attention to the muggle world than Harry had ever understood.
As he showered and brushed his teeth, still thinking of Malfoy and their ever complicated case, Harry felt something stirring deep inside him. He felt as though he was walking, step by step, into something he couldn't see – like he was getting involved with something, or things, beyond his understanding.
“You too, Malfoy.”
“How’s Potter managed it, then?” Malfoy snapped, rudely, angrily. Harry thought that perhaps his anger was at Harry’s lies and secrets, not that Harry hadn’t used the Stone for their cases. There was a faint pink-ish hue to Malfoy’s pale cheeks. Harry didn’t know if it was anger, or excitement, or something else entirely.
“No, let me finish. I know the Prophet is shit, of course it is! I mean, all the times they’ve called you a coward or a cheat or a cuckold, they’re idiots. I just read it because it reminds me of before He came back, when my father was just my father and not a Death Eater.”
“I didn’t realise you were so popular, Potter.” Malfoy’s voice was quiet as he shifted the paper, revealing the other photos – Harry laughing with Connor, Harry smiling up at Francoise, both photos from last night.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Harry! Nothing’s a good event until there’s been some drama. Besides, it’ll be a relief not to hear Malfoy moon about you anymore.”
“You died and came back to life? Jesus Christ!”
“You alright, mate?” Dean asked, noting the faint sheen of sweat on Harry’s upper lip, which he hastily wiped away.
“Well, you looked cold.” Harry said simply, passing Malfoy the salt and pepper. Harry then automatically dropped a sugar cube in Malfoy’s tea before pushing it towards him. Harry often made Malfoy’s tea and coffee at work, and he knew how he took it.
Freezing in horror, he completely forgot his manners as he grabbed Malfoy’s arm and pulled him off towards a quiet corner. Interrupting Malfoy’s frustrated complaint, Harry leant in.
Luna and Ginny were now twirling around the dancefloor, narrowly missing the other dancing couples – Ron and Hermione were wisely sticking in one corner, swaying. His large hands were placed protectively on her belly, and both were smiling widely.
“Well that depends on the favour, doesn’t it, Potter?” Malfoy replied, but he was still smiling, so Harry was hopeful.
“I reckon it’s safe to light a Lumos or two, don’t you?” Ron lit his wand up. Malfoy and Hermione quickly followed suit as Harry patted his back pocket, reassured that his wand was still there after his tumble. The Elder Wand was tucked up his sleeve, as always.
“We humbly ask for safe passage through your territory and beg an audience with your pack leader.”
Perhaps for Malfoy it had been a result of too many glasses of champagne, or the strange intimacy of mending Harry’s wound, or a slip in judgment. Perhaps Malfoy kissed people at every party, and it had just happened to be Harry this time. But for Harry it hadn’t been a mistake. It had been the culmination of what felt like years of repressed emotion.
Harry hurriedly agreed and Suzanne left the table, collecting her breakfast from Sue and winking once more at Harry as the door closed behind her. It didn’t take long for Harry and Malfoy to finish eating and return to the cottage, having promised to pass on Sue’s well wishing to Cressida, who Harry had decided wasn’t feeling well and was taking a few days to rest up.
“I didn’t say anything, actually. You interpreted my silence yourself.” Harry regretted it as he said it – it was sarcastic and rude – totally not appropriate, but Malfoy ignored it, face changing in a blink of an eye as he realised. His eyes lit up.
“Coming, Harry?” Hermione asked, pausing at the door. Harry nodded, pushing back his chair, but Malfoy stopped him, arm held out in front of his chest, close, but not touching.
Harry woke up with a raging headache and a dry mouth, and immediately vomited onto the pillow next to him.
Hope you're enjoying the story! One more chapter to go :) Leave a comment and let me know what you liked. And feel free to ask for one-shot ideas, I'd love to give them a go
“I don’t know – only sometimes, I guess.”
When Harry was finished with the shower he found that Malfoy had woken up. Remembering Malfoy’s fondness for early rising, Harry joined him in the kitchen. He was a little nervous for the conversation he wanted to start, but he thought it would be best to get it over with.
“Harry, mate, are you nuts? That guy was all over you!” Ron gestured to the tall handsome man walking away, incredulous that Harry hadn’t even spared five minutes to talk to him. “Why didn’t you go for it?”
Harry replied in kind, and they turned to see Draco carefully disentangling Pansy from around his neck. She was dressed in a slinky black and gold dress, and her black hair was cut short, to her chin, as always. She looked, for all intents and purposes, like she was calm and relaxed, but Harry could see her wand strapped to her right thigh, within easy reach. He felt relieved to know someone else was always prepared for danger.
“What do you have for us, Ministry men?”
Harry usually hated any art of him – they felt so fake, like paintings of an idol, but this whole scene had been painted with familiarity and love and pain – it had been painted by someone who had been there that night, he was sure.
“What? Oh. No, Potter, don’t be daft. I never put out on the first date.”
Malfoy and Harry stood at the doorway of the fourth and final house, belonging to Jeremiah Umbridge. Both men were quiet and uneasy – this house visit was a painful and unpleasant reminder of their school days, even before the war had truly started, when they’d hated each other on principle and out of pride.
“Shit!” He swore, snatching back his hand and cradling it against his chest, burning tears springing up in his eyes.
Having come dressed in muggle clothes this time, he set off towards the village, bracing himself against the chilled spring winds. He thought about casting a warming charm, but was unwilling to use magic when he wasn’t sure it wouldn’t be noticed.
“Well, it’s your lucky day, pet, she’s due in for breakfast in about ten minutes, if you can wait that long.”
“It’s just that with your familial connection to Dolores Umbridge, we have to check. You understand, sir.” Malfoy’s voice had gotten cooler. Harry remained silent.
Harry started to open the front door of the cottage, and then paused, looking down at himself.
“Should you be carrying it around with you, though?” He sounded slightly worried now, as though he had suddenly been made aware he had a target stuck to his back. Harry knew the feeling.
“Of course I own jeans, Potter. What did you think I wear outside of work?” Starting to feel embarrassed at Harry’s continued surprise, he added “They are designer, and I doubt the same could be said of yours.”
This was the first time they’d gotten drunk together in a more private setting, Harry realised, which he thought explained Malfoy’s relaxed behaviour and willingness to drink more than usual.
Reluctantly, Harry held out his left fist (his right still ached from the night before despite all the healing spells) and unfurled his fingers, revealing a small black stone sitting neatly in the palm of his hand. Ron turned away suddenly, and Hermione gripped his hand tighter.
“I don’t think I could ever forget a single moment of that night. Which bit do you mean?”
“You’re going to be brilliant parents.” He said sincerely, and Ginny and Luna were quick to agree.
Once the words were finished moving, both wizards could clearly see she’d been writing about werewolves.
“Yes.” Malfoy snapped back, not looking away from the pages. “You told me you didn’t do the whole sleeping around thing.”
“Ah, shit.” Harry swore, bumping into Malfoy in his haste to step backwards. Malfoy edged around him and swore too as he saw what had distressed Harry – the motionless body of junior Auror Alison slumped at the foot of the stairs. Part of her blonde hair was stained a dark cherry red and her face was bloody and bruised.
“It’s the Imperius, Malfoy!”
“I’ve never heard of it.”
There was a pause as Malfoy absorbed this information about his former mentor, and then he gasped.
Malfoy’s face was carefully schooled to show no emotion.
“You’re late.” Malfoy’s voice was sharp and Harry winced as he closed the door of their shared office behind him.
“Ah, yes, Claudia. God, she was a bitch.”
“In the meantime, I did some research and I think I found a locator spell that should help us find Cressida Boone.” Ron produced a large, dusty book from his bag and Hermione beamed up at him, delighted, as he handed it over to Harry and Malfoy to peruse.
“You were right – I was being childish. I read that article and I got all jealous and petty. You mean a lot to me, Potter, and not just because I fancy you. You’re a good man, and you’ve saved my life and trusted me with yours. I don’t know how you feel, and that scares me.” Malfoy sat down, heavily, in the seat that Harry had vacated only minutes before. He was looking down, and one of his hands was rubbing against the part of his arm that Harry knew was Fenrir’s bite.
“Start at the beginning,” he said seriously. “And don’t attempt the ones in chapter five until you start Hogwarts with Professor Patil.”
“Fuck that,” Pansy broke in. Draco rubbed the bridge of his nose.
Ron turned his attention back to the cake.
“She won’t have to,” a rough voice said.
In the same low voice, he continued, “And it was like, so, so, good? I didn’t know that—well, anyway. And then he ended up getting lunch with me during a break in the conference the next day, and then when I said I had to get back to Northumberland, he was like, ‘I could visit you, unless that’s too much,’ and he seemed kind of shy? Which, Luna—he’s stunning and so—well, it was unexpected.”
“Right, right. Yeah, Charlie’s said the two of them write a lot. About being ace, and other things. Dragons and plants, probably.”
“No one’s ever ready for this shit, mate,” Sirius said, doing his usual skate across the darker feelings with mateyness, but his voice had a warmth and gravity Harry seemed to appreciate.

ended the stream). Harry was a bit abashed and brought him two lemon biscuits at the next faculty meeting.
“It’s called a sticky note,” Harry said and leaned forwards to show the block to him. “See, it’s like little notes that you can, well, stick onto things. The inventor was trying to come up with a super-strength glue, but he ended up making an adhesive that doesn’t leave marks on things. So, he put it on paper, and ta-da!”
“I, er, don’t really have the energy for charades,” Harry rambled, “I think the smoke went to my brain, maybe I’ll just go sit in the library for a minute.” Draco nodded several times, and then Harry dragged him down the hallway.
Yes, that was it. Friends.
We read your application with great interest. Your letter of recommendation from Dr. Longbottom was one of the most glowing we have ever received. We look forward to working with and getting to know you in the coming months.
“Knock knock,” Lavender said and barged into the room, dragging Harry behind her, as agreed.
“Va te faire enculer,” Narcissa spat and struggled to right herself. The ropes binding her legs suddenly released and she glanced around.
“But it turns out I’m not that bad with my hands.”
Sirius snorted.
Draco shrugged. “It’s nothing, really.”
He couldn’t see or hear Malfoy. The fog dampened all his senses.
There was a gentle knock on the door.
As the Head of The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, you are legally responsible for Draco Malfoy, who on 5th September 1987 was bound by blood in a magical marriage contract to my client, Astoria Elodie Greengrass.
They rubbed one eye. “Astoria used to say some stuff and the rest of us were like, you’ve got to be joking, but Draco has like, backed her up on some weird shit.”
And then he ended up paying somehow. Draco glanced down and smiled.

Harry felt a bit like a broken record, but he was just really confused. He knew his dad’s family was rich, but like, they were also immigrants, and desi, and wizarding high class was like, posh white people who would have gone to Eton if they’d been Muggle.
Andromeda sighed. “He’s always had a nervous stomach, according to his mother.”

Harry looked up to find the table empty and Minerva striding out of the Great Hall. To preserve his dignity he chose not to run after her.
By the time the four of them sat down to breakfast, Elen had already slipped Harry two jam tarts and a chocolate éclair. Malfoy had received a cappuccino dusted with cinnamon. Harry still didn’t understand how elves seemed to be able to bend time and space in kitchens.
He rolled his eyes and said, “Auror mission in Hogsmeade. Just a B&E, but it’s a bit of a twist, so they sent me. And Blaise. Guess he’s probably—upstairs? downstairs?—visiting Malfoy. Where’ve you been? The elves brought me tea, proper scones and all that, so I’ve been happy, but where were you?”
“Firewhiskey?”
. Of course.
Malfoy swished away with a flutter of glitter.
Astoria sighed, scrolled to The Postal Service, lifted the earbud from Draco’s ear, and let

“Let you out from where?” Malfoy laid his sandwich back on the napkin and leaned towards him.
“What? No,” Harry said, rubbing his sweating palms across his knees.
“We’re not going to Camden.”
Harry shook his head. “They’re not called that, though. If you ask for that, the shop person won’t know what you’re talking about. You won’t pass.”
“No.”
“My father is a terrible person,” Draco agreed. “I don’t know if your parents are as much to blame as they were victims of You-Know-Who and my father, the supreme asshole.”
Malfoy shrugged and meandered towards the poster boards. Tracing one finger over a line of glitter glue (somehow a complete disaster and an inspired godsend for his first years; it kept them entertained for hours) surrounding a handwritten biography of the Queen, he said, “It’s complete madness now that they’re all wound up about the Ball. And it’s all your fault, given that the fever pitch of sexual repression doesn’t even have the dampening effects of a Celestina Warbeck or a string quartet playing waltzes.”
Harry blinked. “You’ve got a half yellow scarf on.”

Harry had guessed correctly that this would only infuriate Draco further, as the blond man drew himself up and then began hissing sibilant French words, rather like an angry little goose.
“Oh, you all were,” Remus said. “I see.” He waved his wand and dispersed the purple smoke. “And what kind of a charm was it?”
He kissed like he was trying to devour your face.
Malfoy snorted and continued writing the date in his elegant longhand.
“Right, anyway, just make him a cup of tea at the next faculty meeting. I’m sure you know how he takes it.”
“Mate, the earth is flat.”
“I am the last person you should accuse of homophobia.”
Padma Patil, who had taught potions for the past five years after graduating from Oxford with a first in magical chemistry, laughed and shook her head. “Hagrid, he’s worrying about Draco already.”
Time to grade.
“Present,” Luna said and twirled. “I wanted to write Fuck the Gender Binary, but I didn’t get very far. There’s not that much space on the button, but, you know, I tried.” She turned and pouted at Ginny. “I tried.”
PRESENTS
“Oh, come off it, Malfoy, you don’t speak French.”
Cries of celebration erupted across the terrace. Lavender closed her eyes for a moment. The energy from past celebrations rippling through the flagstone echoed through her chest. Translucent figures in periwigs, panniers, tasseled drop waist dresses, tails and tophats, fatigues, all swimming across the inside of her eyes. They were there, just out of reach.
“You know, Slytherins aren’t all bad. Look at Addie and Bastian.”
Harry raised his eyebrows. “Just pick something out, alright? Whatever you want.” They had to buy something. And he wasn’t about to demonstrate his proclivities in front of a colleague.
God, he was hot.

He steeled his heart.
“Val, it looks amazing,” Harry screamed, folding them into a hug.
Just like Molly had said.
(Yes. Yes, it was.)
“There is the possibility that he might become ill, if he also attempts to pursue someone who is not Astoria,” Hermione said, looking uncomfortable. Sirius made a noise of disgust. “I can’t lie to her!”
Draco laughed. “Thankfully.”
They were looking skinnier than usual, Remus noted with narrowed eyes, and pushed a cup of coffee into their hands.
Malfoy quirked an eyebrow and shook his head at Harry.
“Think the house—er, fuck, sorry, just elves—would do up some more scones for me?” Harry nodded, and gestured to the bellpull by the fire. Ten minutes later, Ron had another plateful of scones and a cup of tea, Harry had a piece of treacle tart with cream, and they had settled in for a plotting session.

“I’m going to call for a pizza.”
“Oh, are we going somewhere?” Blaise yawned and stretched his arms overhead. Neville’s jumper was gigantic and cozy, so he really had to arch his back until it rode up enough to—
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Pansy is a very close friend who I would never, ever sleep with for a variety of reasons, including that her family has absolutely no money, she lives in London throughout the entire year, even summers, and she thinks hot yoga cures everything.” He paused and shuddered. “It’s disgusting. All that sweating.”
“Really?” Talbott said. “You broke into our home without even adequately researching my wife?” Harry noticed that he didn’t even mention himself as a threat. Somehow this flower-bedecked, blue-lipstick-wearing, chubby middle-aged woman in a pink and lavender muumuu was more of a threat than the Head Auror?

“Hey,” Neville said. “No.”
Oh, how pleasing. Yes. That would be a nice conversation. Yes.
“Oh,” Andre said. “Right, you’re friends with the family.”
“And I’m assuming that they put music on it for you?”
whatever floats your boat.
Anyway, clearly Malfoy had been working out. But whatever.
Luna held up a finger and said, “He’s right! The stars have important effects on our lives, though we humans don’t really understand them—Harry, did you consider having a centaur on this panel?”
Harry’s jaw worked for a moment. “I don’t think you should speak like that about my colleagues,” he said finally, because it seemed like the Thing He Was Supposed To Say. Even though the information made him want to shout triumphantly. He hadn’t been imagining things. Things
Before Draco could respond, the student piped up again with, “What about you, Professor Malfoy? Have you ever been in love?”

“You’ve an editor?”

The shop had dark windows and a lurid pink flourescent sign of a lipstick print. It was in a bit grimier neighborhood, and Harry checked the perimeter as he tucked his wallet away. Draco was oblivious and smiled at a rough sleeper, who looked confused and hurried away.
Neville does have an e-mail address. :D
Yes, it’s that bad.
“Gregory?”

Draco shrugged. He sipped his tea. Andromeda sipped hers.
“Get your brain out of the gutter, you slimy little git!” Draco yelped.
The next morning, Blaise propped his chin on his hands and stared Neville down over the toast.
Luckily, before she had to try to explain non-magical particle physics (gravity had almost led to a familial schism two years ago), they heard the front door open and cheerful shouts filtered through the house. Hermione, snow melting in her hair, Ron, his freckled cheeks red with the cold, and Harry, cheerful red and green glitter splashed across their eyelids, entered the living room laden with presents.
“Right,” Draco said with a nod. “I’m sure.”
She shot him a grateful look over Harry’s head.
20⟞ day off work
So Hermione got up and, wrapping her arms around their shoulders, snuggled her head down into their neck. “You did what you could, kid.”
“What—”
“It’s a provisional title,” Draco said with a huff.
─────── ⎎ ───────
“Harry,” Ron said with a sigh, “please take a breath. It’s going to be ok. It’s just a B&E—it’s got nothing to do with Hogwarts or Voldemort or anything. This is like, low-level shit.”
She nodded. “Obviously, you’re Harry Potter. I’ve read the book about you.”
And then they were at Harry’s door. Which meant that Draco had missed his door. And then Harry had a moment of clarity and he’d reached out and grabbed Draco’s arm. His bicep was firm and warm in his hand, beneath Draco’s woolen robes.
But that was a pipe dream. Bill yelled up the stairwell something about the car seat, which didn’t really make sense because they were taking an international portkey, but she settled Gabrielle into the sling.
Harry looked down at the metallic embroidery, which seemed to have dented Malfoy’s face. “Oh, yeah, well, Indians don’t mess about, like, so it’s real gold. Thought you’d appreciate that, Malfoy.”
There wasn’t anything to it.

He hadn’t felt Malfoy’s magic at all. Maybe he was just used to it now?
“Er,” Parvati said and blushed. “It’s not really a, you know. Anyway.”
“So are we just irresponsible members of society?” She snapped her fingers to summon a bottle of Bollinger. Thank Hecate for rich friends. “Aren’t we supposed to care about retirement packages by now? Or at least think they’re interesting?”
A hand dropped onto her arm.

The invisibility cloak hardly fit two grown men, and Harry had to stoop over to ensure that their feet didn’t just appear where there shouldn’t be feet. It was impossible to walk in synchronization with Draco, who seemed to alternately be pushing closer to him and then trying to inch as far away from him as possible, and Harry was just about to lose his temper when they arrived at Audrey’s house.
Harry nodded. “Thanks, but I doubt it’s going to throw me off that much.”
“I came from a podcast interview,” Sirius said, affronted.
He was looking good. He’d always been a cute boy, but over the years, he’d grown into himself. Physically, sure, but it was the confidence that had filled him out over the years. That and the improvement to his posture. He moved with a kind of studied grace.
“They could bring it here! Curse one of the students!”
He’d heard you were supposed to compliment people back. But then suddenly all he could think of were ridiculous things like,
Didn’t hurt to ask.
Malfoy’s presents—which should have caused Harry to feel a bit jealous, but seeing how Malfoy’s smile changed from a bit worried to gentle and open set off a cascade of warmth—and zoomed around the ballroom on his tiny broomstick while his new stuffed dragon flapping its shiny wings and flew along beside him.
“Well, yeah,” Neville said, “I love him. But I’d want to get married first.”
“Padma, we’re the same age.”
“Darling, what are you reading? You seem stressed.”

“Wait, what?”
“I was thinking.”
Harry shrugged. Let Draco have his moment. They’d come back to him eventually.

It was the Oliver-Winger’s fault, Harry thought, that’s why he was so filled with these moist thoughts. Entirely their fault. Probably some residual enchantment from that Priapus necklace. Nothing to do with the blonde head bobbing at his side and needling him about his terrible puns and lies.
“Yeah, and that one, which is totally stupid; they’re such idiots. Just like, ask her if she has some magical drug or something before you stab yourself, Romeo. Or just give it like five. Jesus.” Britney rolled her eyes and tapped her ballpoint on her desk.
Neville gasped. “No!”
“First to catch it wins?”
Wait, since when had he wanted to know that?
“Ah, no,” Harry said. “No need. Please. Keep it. Don’t give it back. It’s a gift.”
“Ah.”
“Fine,” Harry said, and pulled out a pad of sticky notes from his drawer. He scrawled a name, phone number, and address down and handed the note to Draco. “That’s my wizarding therapist. Her name’s Eileen. She’s from an old West Country wizarding family, so she probably knows all about your … uh, traditions.”
“Yeah.”
The last time he’d worn this sherwani was Ron and Hermione’s wedding. He’d thought black was a bit severe and an unlucky color for a wedding, but Ron had told him it would go with his tux (black tie, obviously, even if it was at the Burrow), and the gold would pick up their gold wedding rings when the three of them stood at the altar. He’d been best man and maid of honor, though those were outdated, sexist, and gender-normative terms. And he’d cried the whole ceremony. Ginny had snuck out of her seat in the front row to trade Hermione’s bouquet for a packet of tissues. For Harry. Who tried to be silent. But that just meant he couldn’t blow his nose and snot was running freely down his chin. Harry shook his head at the memory, a smile creeping up on his face. George had whispered some spell at him, and he found his eyes were dry. Dry-heaving it was. Molly was also sobbing, so he wasn’t completely alone. And Hermione didn’t cry (she couldn’t stop smiling), but Harry saw a tear run down Ron’s freckled cheek. They were his people. And they were in love. And they were going to be together forever.
Harry became his friend.
Luckily Harry was there when the most persistent ones didn't leave him alone.  Somehow those people seemed to be hypnotized to leave him alone. Overall Draco was just tired of being reminded of what happened to him. He wished that the nightmares, the people and the stupid man who caused all this would just disappear.
Harry smiled widely at him, “Seriously, it’s no problem.  I know how stressful that class is, and the last thing I want is you collapsing in exhaustion.”
times.
He sees it every day and every night. Whenever he closes his eyes, Harry sees death. He could still hear the sobs of agony, it dripping like hot wax into his ears. The taste of fresh blood always lingering in his mouth. The hate was still fresh, too and he yearned for vengeance. No matter what he did, the feeling was always there.
So, like the loser that he was, he started cleaning the kitchen of a total stranger on a Thursday night. Sai d stranger just kept on snoring and whispering to nobody. Draco rolled his eyes and focused on the tasks. Three hours later, the plates were clean, the trash was taken out during a break in the rain, and the smell was gone.
Draco learned that the man’s name was Harry Potter. Harry Potter liked sweet desserts. Harry Potter liked coffee when it was hot, tea when it was warm, and hot chocolate when it rained. Harry Potter would buy cookies for small kids, smiling wide when they beamed a toothless smile back at him.
So, Harry uploaded every one of the sickening man’s pictures into an email to the police precinct and posted weak, premature rebuttals to Jeffery’s Facebook page.
Entering the cafe, he noticed that it was quiet. Which was unusual since a crowd of people was waiting outside. But it was understandable. Nobody wanted anything to do with it since Jeffery was one of the owners.  From what he heard, people had quit, harassed the rest of the owners, and vendors refused to make deliveries.
“Really? REALLY?!” He screamed at nobody. The stupid man just snored and buried his head further to the sofa. Taking a deep breath, Draco looked around the home. He noticed the kitchen was very disgusting. There were fucking flies surrounding the clutter of dirty dishes, the trash was overflowing, and a weird stench hung around it all.
Harry gave generous tips.
He just wanted a break, a break from that life. He wanted a break from the pity glances, the pressure, and the anger. He resented being pushed into a wedding that he didn't even want in the first place. He loved Ginny, but he could live without her constant praise. The girl seemed to be just as attached to the legacy he hated as everyone else. He hated it with all his might.
“Uh, what do you mean?” That was the wrong answer because the man became even angrier.
On his way to work, the feeling seemed to stalk his every move. The feeling of nausea kept appearing. He tried to calm his nerves on the walk to the small cafe. He had to stifle a disappointed moan when he noticed that one of the cafe’s creepy owners was working behind the counter that morning. As the man looked up and noticed Draco, his smile turned perverted and his eyes were predatory. Draco shuttered, but he knew that he had to deal with the unwanted advances. The pay was decent and creepy Jeffery would always give him the most tips. Forcing a smile on his face, he put on his “blonde barbie” persona. Apparently, the pervert has a thing for bimbos who giggle at everything.
I was just being friendly! And don’t call Harry that, he’s a nice person!” Once again, that was an upsetting answer, as his boss lunged at him.
He remained quiet as they drove, this sweet naive dove making sure a stranger returned safely to the comfort of his home. The dove carefully lays him on his couch. Little dove, so warm, and kind. His skin screaming to be marked up.
The man smiled before looking at the menu above him. “I’ll take a medium-dark roast with a blueberry muffin.” Draco nodded and rushed to get the treat. Anything to make the man leave.
He felt bad that he kept waking his friend up with his screams, so to make up for it, the blonde cooked, cleaned, and did all the chores so a tired Harry wouldn’t have to.
It was weird.  He didn’t know how to explain it, but he always felt strange.  Ever since he left that drunk into his home, the pressure seemed to always be there. So far, he’d felt the same sensation for two weeks. His dreams weren't any better, but at least he couldn’t remember them, no matter how much he tried. Nevertheless, the dreams left him satisfied in a way. Made him crave something. Made him crave
“Draco? Are you okay?” His concern made Draco’s heart flutter.
Maybe it was his head or maybe Harry was close to his university, but ten minutes later, the man was scanning the room, and their eyes met. Sighing in relief, Draco grabbed a hold of his friend’s home.
Harry said nothing when
If people knew what happened in his past, they would ask why he still wants to make his father proud. But Draco didn't care for those thoughts. He might have destroyed his family status nevertheless he could still be a great ass lawyer like the rest of his male relatives.
Police told him that once they caught Jeffery, the man would have new charges against him. Draco felt a huge weight just drop from his shoulders, especially when people came pouring in with support and love. He honestly thought he would have negative reactions, but there was none of that.
A loud crash made the two men’s eyes widen. As they left the room, he saw a pissed-off-looking Jeffery. The crazed man locked his eyes on Draco before charging at him at full speed. Luckily, before he reached him, Harry stepped between them.
He keeps his promise.
Draco slowly moved to the shower, the cold water calming the heat of his body.
He was done talking. Going up to the defeated man, he flicked his wand and broke his leg clean off above the knee. Once again, sobs turned to screams. Blood was glistening over exposed bone, causing the man to throw up behind the gag. The smell of urine made its way up to Harry’s nose. He waited for a moment as Jeffery went unconscious. Taking off the gag, a splash of saliva, blood, and puke instantly went down the naked chest. Harry wanted the man to suffer. Wanted to take him apart piece by piece.
Draco smiled to himself, despite him having to work late at the cafe. Today was a good day; no rude customers, many tips, and then Harry. He had no idea why the cafe was open until 11 pm since no one ever came. Plus, if people ever did come, they were usually drunk or high and ended up sleeping, puking, or attempting to steal stuff. It was very annoying.
He doesn’t stop looking for a way to get even to those who see him only as a story.
It left him breathless, and he didn't even know
He continued, “If anything, me killing you would be a blessing. I mean, no one will ever hire you again now that your dirty little secret is exposed. It cost you everything, but I don’t think prison will teach you.”
Laying on his bed, his mind kept on flashing to the drunken, handsome man. Draco didn't know why but he had a strange urge to go to the man. The urge was weird and intense, the man’s face consuming his mind. Even though it was still early, sleep overtook his body. The man’s image in his mind and the strange sensation in his body kept getting stronger and stronger.
“Draco? What are you doing here? Are you okay?!” His darling shook his head before leaning in to hug Harry.
Connor was a nice guy even though he was a bit off. The guy had weird expressions whenever the blonde came near him. Connor’s face would turn red and would leave in a hurry.
“I’m not one-hundred percent sure, but I can see if I can get a practice test for you?”
The blond tried his best to ignore the mess but of course, his years of being a dishwasher boy meant he couldn’t ignore it.
Not when he reads another story that casts Remus and Sirius as nothing more than a werewolf and a prisoner.
The aftermath, and the beginning of a plan...
“Don’t,” Ron would say, at his side. “Just stay normal for two hours.”
He waited for two weeks. 14 Days. 336 Hours. 1,209,600 seconds. During that time, he devised a plan. A plan that would hopefully make Draco Malfoy
Jeffery was now declared as a wanted man, police were in every block and considering how small the town was, it wouldn’t be long until they found him.  He wouldn’t be surprised if the man was found dead.
“Uh-” Draco stuttered before clearing his throat. “You’d be correct. What can I help you with?”
Harry was shaking. In anger. In excitement. In happiness. Mostly because now he had an extra reason to kill Jeffery. A reason to slaughter him. A reason to show no mercy.
The man let out a groan of pain, opening his eyes for a moment before going back to sleep. While Draco debated between calling for help or taking the man to his apartment, he checked to see if there was anything on the guy that could help him. He let out a small cheer when he found a wallet and keys. As he stood closer, he had to jump back in disgust as the strong smell of alcohol hit his nose.
“I love that you’re being protective, but I’m fine. If anything, him coming to my apartment will make things worse for him. Police already said that he’ll have an even worse punishment if something were to happen to me. In this town, people tend to punish creeps like him very intensively.”  Harry protested a lot so he made a compromise. Draco gave him an extra key, and that cheered the man right up.
His stupid alarm interrupted the dream that he had been having. Draco tried to ignore the blaring alarm of death until he remembered that he needed to start looking for a second job. A second job had to have because his landlord apparently just loved to see people suffer.
“Draco? Are you okay?” He feigned concern since it was clear that the interaction and the exposure had shocked his poor sweetheart. Harry gave him a comforting squeeze. His dove looked around the cafe, his voice still shaky. Draco gave him a small smile before whispering silently, “I guess I was lucky that asshole just said creepy shit to me. And that I managed to get away before he hurt me.”
Waiting was a bitch. But people were right when they say slow and steady wins the race. After going to the cafe for the first time, he managed to catch Draco’s attention. Then he went in every evening, as his dove took his college classes in the mornings. When he heard the blond complaining about his philosophy class, he found the teacher and took what he wanted. The next day, he gave Draco the information he needed for the class. The conversation was boring, and his dove wouldn’t need this in the future, but the squeal and hug of happiness ere worth stalking an innocent stranger and getting into her office. His plan was going on perfectly.
ob. A job that he would probably hate. Shaking the negative thoughts from his head, Draco focused on the man next to him.
Draco’s head sprang up so quickly, he was pretty sure he gave himself whiplash. “Harry, If you get this I will love you forever.”
“Here you go. A medium-dark roast coffee and a blueberry muffin. Is there anything else?” The man nodded in thanks and got up to leave.
But, apparently, luck was not on his side, because the man chose to sit in one of the chairs. One that was right in front of him.
It wasn’t.
With a shaky exhale, he took a deep breath and checked the unconscious man’s pulse. To his relief, it was steady and strong.
