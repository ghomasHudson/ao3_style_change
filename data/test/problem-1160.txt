Draco picked up one of his shoes and chucked it at Harry, who didn't stop laughing even when it hit him in the cheek.
"Nah, it's no big deal." He stretched his arms over his head and rolled his sore shoulders. "I didn't want you to wake up and I was gone."
“I didn’t
“Well —” Draco splutters, fighting futilely for autonomy of his wrists again. “You know, you’re hard too, idiot!”
who kills
Draco rolled his eyes. He pulled the quilt over them and nuzzled beneath Harry's chin, delighting in the arm that was dropped over his waist.
As soon as the door was closed, Potter tore off the Cloak and dragged Draco back into a devastating kiss that encompassed every overwhelming emotion Draco had felt over the past four weeks. There was as much teeth as there was tongue; in no time at all his lips felt raw and sensitive, and still he didn’t stop. In a flurry of movement they pulled off one another’s cloaks and scarves, toed off their shoes, and Draco even managed to grab Potter’s jumper and yank it off over his head before Potter was pushing him back towards the bed.
flirting with Potter, I hardly think it’s within your jurisdiction to get upset about it, so you can shove your indignant little tirade
?” he said finally.
Harry gave him a dull look. "Are you really about to try and convince me this has been casual sex, Draco?"
Malfoy, apparently still in possession of just enough sanity to manage the task, pulled his own shirt over his head and then did Harry's. Beneath him suddenly was a tantalising expanse of pale skin and sharp angles, jutting ribs, criss-crossing scars over a narrow abdomen. Malfoy's hands went back to his face and he pulled Harry down again into a frantic kiss, hips lifting and dragging their cocks together through their clothes. Harry stroked his hands up the sides of Malfoy's naked torso, over the pleasantly tactile ridge of his ribs, feeling the texture of the scars beneath the pads of his fingers, and finally back down to his waist, around which Harry's hands curled almost too easily.
“Some loony in the village claims they saw a ‘suspicious figure’ heading up towards the school last night,” Harry said offhandedly, leaning back against one of the workstations and grinning at Draco. “You know, you have dirt on your face.”
“No, actually, I don’t,” Draco said airily, smirking when Harry frowned. “Young? Handsome?”
“I dunno, do I?” he said irritably, standing up from the sofa and dragging a hand through his wildly messy hair. This was a lie, though — he did sort of know why, he just wasn’t keen on discussing his aversion to engaging in any sort of serious conversations lately ... it being a rather serious conversation in and of itself. “I didn’t want to deal with it, I s'pose. I’d bet you a hundred Galleons she’d have done the same thing if I’d broken up with her anyway, she’s barking. At least this way it saves me a row.”
one, I can’t …”
"My god," Hermione said disgustedly upon seeing what they were both looking at — as well as a growing number of people around the hall. "It's pathetic, really, can't they leave him
“Yeah, well, you know what?” said Harry tightly, standing up from the table. “I’m only
Hermione reached across her books and covered Harry’s hands with one of her own. He became aware of his picking and stopped. She had been trying to break him of this painful habit since they’d returned to school.
Some time last night while he had been out having a pint with Ron and Dean Thomas, somebody had come into his London apartment and trashed the place.
They didn't have much time for Draco to go into anymore details because they had to start getting ready for the ceremony, taking place outside by the lake. It was going to be double the usual size, it being for both seventh- and eighth-year students this year.
"I could tell," Harry teased. Draco might usually have retaliated with something sarcastic and coquettish, but right now he merely smiled. "I'm sorry it's been so bad."
"My parents put me on one of these," he said after a minute of looking at it. Hermione had already told Draco this when he'd brought up the idea, but he let Harry tell him anyway. "There's this picture. I'll have to show you."
There was a great swell of noise from the graduates, all shouting together and throwing their pointed hats in the air. With a chest full of emotion, Harry fought through the crowd towards Ron like there was a magnet between them and threw his arms around his very first friend, wondering with sudden laughter if he was truly about to start crying. Ron squeezed him tight, said "well, we made it, eh?" and then released Harry to hug Hermione, who had come bounding over to them. Harry clutched at her next, laughing again when he felt her positively sobbing into his robes. Many people were clapping his back and wishing him well and finally, feeling his heart swell further, he found Draco's white head of hair and didn't bother with a hug, pulling him forwards and kissing him right on the mouth. It was short and sweet and Draco broke it to put his face in Harry's neck. Harry held him close and rubbed his back, knowing how emotional this probably was for Draco without any family here.
"I see your smoke," she says, suddenly right behind the sofa. He watches her come around the side and then sit down in the armchair next to it. "Hermione fire-called me."
Defence Against the Dark Arts would have been by far the best class this year had it not been for the new professor’s penchant for using Harry as an aid in all his demonstrations. Even worse, he sometimes deferred to Harry’s judgment, at which point Harry would politely and somewhat awkwardly remind him that he was hardly an expert.
"I'm gonna let you get away with that only because I do feel sort of bad for beating you to the Snitch
It didn’t matter how many years passed since Harry got rid of the Dark Lord, or how long it had been since any
Draco’s stomach plummeted. The things coming out of Potter’s mouth were so surreal they might have been the stuff of dreams.
"If I may, Professor McGonagall." Harry's heart leapt and he looked up to find that Dumbledore's portrait was awake and looking down his long, crooked nose at them. McGonagall peered at him with a mixture of respect and ambivalence.
"Collapsing in on myself in a vortex of self-pity, you mean?" he says facetiously.
deserve not to have to hear her complaining about it all through the holiday."
eleven. Won't that be something? I bet you two have a Hufflepuff."
"What d'you mean, you couldn't get him?" Draco drawled.
A few days before commencement he sent his mum an owl letting her know he needed to speak with her about something important, and on the day of the ceremony, when she was allowed to come to Hogwarts with an Auror escort, he and Harry prepared themselves to break the news. He held Harry's hand when they went to Slughorn's office early that morning, and keeping himself from dwelling on a thousand different horrible imaginary situations was as fruitless as trying to keep water cupped in his hands. Harry's presence made it easier, but ultimately it came down to himself and his mother and his (still only minorly) distended belly.
. I don’t give a shit if you die here alone, Malfoy. So think carefully about what you say next.”
The wax seal was that of St. Mungo’s.
"You didn't answer her question," says Pansy. "
?” Draco asked, a note of irritation having edged into his tone. His heart was beating rapidly, and it wasn’t because of Potter’s closeness. They seemed to be suddenly teetering precariously on the edge of dangerous territory. A sense of foreboding and irascibility that Draco associated with Potter but had not felt for many months in his company now filled Draco’s head with its ominous presence, making his muscles tight and his teeth clench.

“Even though it’s ... it's my

saying it. “And I love the tattoo.”
“Stay under here,” Harry whispered, and then he stepped out from beneath the Cloak. Granger and Weasley ran over.
Malfoy never showed up next night.
Twenty minutes, the guard had said.
It was himself he saw in the reflection, the same one he'd gotten used to seeing for eighteen years before Conway had taken it away from him. He lifted the gown and looked at himself, dazed over it, and he ran a finger along a healing scar along the bottom of his abdomen, the one from the c-section. That, apparently, would stay, just as his
Draco's heart feels lighter than air suddenly, only that feeling deflates a little when he remembers something.
“Right,” she said, eyes a bit wide, and she’d averted her gaze, looking too embarrassed to meet Harry’s eye.
“God,” Draco muttered, and now he reached down and pressed his palm against Harry’s cock, pleased to feel how hard he was in spite of his ruthless teasing. “You’re so annoying.”
“You have to make peace with that, Malfoy,” says Potter harshly. “You can’t ask some made-up Muggle god for forgiveness and skip the part where you face your guilt. Your choices. That’s not how it works. You
Now all this does is make his cock twitch and start filling with blood.
. Not that quickly, at least.
“I know what you said.” He kept his voice calm, not in the least surprised that even under these unbelievable circumstances — even after he’d
He went to the window and sat down beside him. It was cushioned with green velvet that matched the curtains around the beds and looked exactly the same as the ones in his own dorm aside from the colour. Outside was an unimpeded view of the Hogwarts grounds, covered in a thick layer of snow and sparkling as prettily as if it had been enchanted to do so. The sight of it made Harry's chest ache with a potent combination of love and sadness.
“Where does it live when you’re at school?” Draco asked, getting up off the bed as well.
Draco made a clicking sound of disgust with his tongue but didn’t try to move away, even when Harry pressed a kiss to the back of his neck.
Draco scowls. Harry has a knack for putting him on the spot, probably because he’s figured out it’s the only way to get Draco to talk. What he doesn’t know is that those preposterously green eyes usually have a lot to do with loosening Draco’s tongue.
His hands shook as he stood outside the Great Hall as dinner was starting, letting the stares of the student body roll off of him like nothing more than water, feverishly searching for that black shock of hair.
“I, er … no, yeah, I agree,” Harry said, trying to fight back his surprise at the broaching of the subject of Draco from such an unexpected source. Beside him, peripherally, he could see Hermione struggling to remain straight-faced. “I wouldn’t wish that on anybody.”
"Maybe I will."
“Holy
Draco furiously continues fighting back any telltale sighs of emotion on his face, and he knows Harry sees this, because he rolls his eyes and bends to kiss Draco again, this time on the mouth.
together, looking for a flat, and still for the last two and a half months he'd caught himself wondering what was going to happen when he got his body back, especially now that it was getting so close.
Harry grunted, hips speeding up, his breath hot and fast in Draco’s face. His desperation was potent, his need for closeness, for reassurance, and Draco let him have it. He let Harry squeeze his thigh until it hurt and fuck him so hard he knew he wouldn’t sit tomorrow, until Harry was burying his face in Draco’s neck with a deep groan and coming hard. He felt Harry shake with the force of it and Draco barely even needed the hand he wrapped around himself to follow, splattering his own chest and Harry’s Auror robes with come.
He meant it now. There had been nothing but sincerity in Harry’s eyes when he said it. The issue was whether or not he would still find his way into meaning it once it actually happened.
, Potter,” Malfoy said tetchily. “And I’m
“You saw Theo,” Draco gasped suddenly, crying out when he felt Harry’s fingers slipping over his pussy, his thumb and forefinger finding and squeezing his swollen clit even as he sped up the pace of his hips.
Another grin, although this one was accompanied by an eye roll. “Deal,” Harry repeated.
“Yes,” he said without looking at her.
,” Ron said stiffly, standing up as well and dropping a protective arm across Hermione’s shoulders. “Slow down, mate.”
Sitting on a bench out behind greenhouse two, kept warm by a bluebell flame, Draco thought about how he now had a brand-new association with the holiday. Perhaps he’d given Potter one, too.
have to pry?
Had he felt sick before?
"Maybe not, but you're certainly putting a lot more weight on the bad things than the good ones. I understand that it frightens you." He drops his hand and takes off his glasses again, wiping them on his shirt instead of spelling them clean. "You have a rough history together. And if you truly did fight as often as you say then perhaps it

in Potions today. What the hell is that about?”
“Are you shagging him?”
“Yeah, of course. Let’s go back up to my room, it’ll be empty right now.”
"Oh my god," says Pansy, the disbelief back in her voice. "You do, you fancy him!"
A pulse of dizzy arousal made Draco’s head throb; he could hear his heartbeat in his ears, and he could feel his pulse in his fingers. Potter’s breath was unbearably hot on his neck, making it difficult to think, but then, maybe it was okay, just for a moment, just for right now, to let someone else do the thinking — maybe, inside this little bubble, where it was just him and Potter and
"Only sort of?"
Ron and Hermione stayed back when they went to visit the manor afterwards. Draco knew why, and they didn't discuss it. He'd felt Harry tense when they approached the door, but he'd been adamant about coming. Maybe one day they'd be able to talk about it, but it wasn't now.
“It’s disgusting,” he said quietly, almost reluctantly, and Harry could hear the unspoken,
“You missed dinner,” she said, walking past him into the room and holding out a heavy parchment envelope that was sealed with the Malfoy crest. Draco hated looking at it; the Ministry had seized most of his family’s assets shortly after the war, leaving them with a manor that was nothing more than an enormous, empty corpse. A skeleton of what it had once been. The insignia seemed to mock their predicament. He could imagine his mother sitting in the bare bones of his father’s once-grand office, writing to him with a Ministry official standing nearby. It made him sick to his stomach.
“What exactly are you doing here, Potter?” he says again, ignoring Harry’s last statement.
Draco's heart swells. He rolls his eyes because he doesn't want Potter to see the emotion on his face, but he's pretty sure he sees it anyway.
“So,” said Ron, taking a large gulp of his firewhisky and, after grimacing and shaking his head like a dog, set it down on the table. “Er — Malfoy, then.”
He forgot about all of this, however, when suddenly, with the abruptness of a flash of lightning, Draco became aware that something felt …
“Your power trips aren’t cute, you know.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He let out a wet chuckle of disbelief. “And you’re not upset?”
. I’m proud of him. Aren’t you?”
“What are you
He picked the pace up minimally when he added a second finger, just enough to make Draco start feeling like he'd lose his bloody
Draco kicked at him again, but this time Harry bent his knee and blocked it, laughing. Soon, however, they found themselves kissing again, only this time it eventually tapered out as Draco began drifting off. They didn't speak: Harry watched him fall asleep, wrapped up in a Gryffindor-themed Weasley jumper, and his last thought before going under himself was that he couldn't remember the last time he'd been so comfortable.
“I don’t like that bloke,” Ron said with a shake of his head. “Reminds me of McLaggen.”
“I asked if you needed
more familiar. The long hair had been fun in its way, the odd weight of it, trying different styles ... but it had never felt like a permanent thing. Mrs Weasley Vanished the hair and as soon as he stood up, before Draco even knew it was coming, she'd hugged him. He was stiff at first and then relaxed into it, overwhelmed with gratitude he didn't know how to articulate.
"Wow, I knocked out," said Harry, taking his glasses off and yawning. There was a painful spot just beside his eye where the frames had dug into his skin.
"What?" He looked at her blankly. "To who?"
“That’s right, Ron!” Hermione said, beaming at him. This was a face reserved almost exclusively for the very rare moments when Ron managed to spot something both Harry and Hermione had somehow missed, and the sight of it never failed to tickle Harry. “He’s absolutely right, Harry, can you imagine what Malfoy’s thinking right now? And it’s only because of
On the day of the match, there wasn’t much time to see one another. Malfoy was up to his ears with work to do and Harry was busy talking his team through their repertoire of plays one last time. However, just ten minutes before the crowds were due to be let into the stadium, Malfoy pulled him away under the guise of needing to speak with him; they went up to the top box, empty for now, and Harry wasted no time at all shoving his tongue inside that sweet-tasting mouth.
Sucking in a deep breath and letting it out slowly through his mouth, Draco closed his eyes and forced his shoulders to relax from where they’d bunched up nearly to his ears. Finally, when he was sure he had better control over himself, he said, “I’m not discussing this with you. I haven’t discussed it with

“It means a great deal to

On the other hand, the idea that Harry was eating him out under a desk in the library was so blindingly fucking
Malfoy merely stared at him, and after a few moments of this it was Harry who finally flew over and landed beside him in the stands, windblown and confused and more curious than he’d ever been in his whole life.

“I was only going to say it would look nice with a skirt.” This was breathed into Draco’s ear, sending a chill down his spine. He swallowed hard and deliberately let his breath out slowly, trying to hide its unsteady quality, and knew he failed. Harry’s fingers toyed with the waistband of his pyjamas.
“What about you?” he asks, indicating the hard bulge in Harry’s jeans.
Harry blinked owlishly, dazed by the juxtaposition of words that were so utterly Malfoy coming out of a
Theo shrugged, looking perfectly comfortable despite Draco’s obvious wariness and dislike for the question. There was a gleam of something in his eyes that could have been suspicion, but Draco liked to believe that was simply his Slytherin cunning shining through. It was very easy, after all, to make somebody talk when they thought you already knew.

with her, then?”
"Potter."
Everyone was on their feet, for one thing. Hermione and Daphne were back a few yards from Draco, who stood motionless behind Goyle. Goyle had his wand on someone, who had their wand on him in return. Harry dropped the bottles and immediately reached for his own; peripherally, he saw Ron do the same.
Malfoy nodded.
“Fucking

“Yes,” Malfoy said tightly. “Well … sort of … it’s slowed down at the moment. I’m, er — not wearing one of those awful cotton things right now… Pomfrey says it’ll be irregular for a while. I don’t want you to

"Just good?"
so powerful it blasted the boy backwards, throwing him against the opposite wall. Harry didn't bother catching his wand — he went straight for Malfoy, kneeling down beside him and putting a hand on his chin, making Malfoy face him. His head lolled on the ground, eyes fluttering uselessly, still trembling.
In front of the entire entrance hall, Harry cupped Draco’s cheeks and pulled him into a kiss that felt earth-shattering in its significance.
“No,” he said quietly, voice wet and miserable. The admission made his heart twist painfully. “And I’ll never be able to find out for sure … by the time they let us visit him, he wouldn’t even recognise me in my

He thought of talking to Hermione about it but decided not to, at least not yet, until he'd spoken to Malfoy first. After another day and then two passed in the same fashion, Harry realised he was going to need to pull some kind of sketchy manoeuvre and quite literally corner him.

“Why do you say that?” Harry laughed.

to alienate Malfoy for good.
to understand, and more than anything I want to be able to support you, I just …” She tapered off, the look on her face one of deepest disquiet. “I don’t see how you can forgive someone the things Malfoy’s done.”
“Brilliant.” A grin lit up his face, washing away any evidence of that intangible something. “I s’pose we should get a move on, then. Lessons are bound to be finished soon and I’ve got Transfiguration next.”
“I’m sorry to hear that,” he said stiffly.
“Only when I’m serious about something,” Harry hummed, and for good measure slid his hands down to Malfoy’s arse and squeezed. He leaned forwards again and brushed their lips together, loving the way he could feel Malfoy shiver in his arms. “C’mon … say yes. I’d

any sympathy, though.”
“That’s because he’s good with his hands,” Draco says, bringing his lips to Harry’s cheek again where Harry can feel him grinning.
Draco fought for wakefulness, aware first of how blissfully warm he was, then of Harry’s continued presence in his bed (which was unfounded — he always left before Draco woke up).
Harry rolled his eyes, but it wasn’t without a pleased grin. It was the first time he’d heard Malfoy make any sort of joke about the situation that wasn’t dark or scathing — self-deprecating, yes, but it wasn’t as angry as it might have been even a few days ago.
With tear tracks drying on his cheeks, Harry tipped his head back and laughed, chasing away any lingering shadows of doubt.
much time to think about it. You’re a bit prone to overanalysing.” He slid a thumb beneath Draco’s eye, brushing away a tear. “So … what d’you say? I have to owl Kingsley back by noon to let him know if you’re going.”
Draco scowled and looked away, another salty tear spilling over onto his cheek. It stung, to hear Harry’s promise from the night before relayed back to him once again by his best mate. The promise that it was

It was five o’clock when they were let into one of Azkaban’s visitation rooms by a guard. The Minister himself had greeted them at the entrance — probably, Draco noted, because nobody else looked too happy about the arrangement. He and Harry were not only on a first-name basis, but seemed to know one another well. He had even shaken Draco’s hand and given a respectful little nod. Afterwards, Draco had obsessively tugged at the left sleeve of his cloak, and he was grateful Shacklebolt hadn’t stayed.
“Not properly,” he said. “It’s still a new body, I don’t think he’s ready yet for —”
The weird thing was that Malfoy kept letting it happen. Harry had thought for sure after the second time intervening that Malfoy would have told him to bugger off, but he didn't. It was quite a good solution for the time being, the only hitch being the fact that Harry could feel himself beginning to obsess. Not over the situation, but over Malfoy himself. He'd done his fair share of that before, of course, but unlike two years ago, there was no mystery to solve this time. He just ... liked watching him.
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” says Harry.
“How I’m doing?” Draco repeated, sneering. Indignation flared to life in his chest. Theo, at least, had the decency to look ashamed. His cheeks coloured and he looked away, but he showed no other sign of discomfort. His pure-blood upbringing would have quashed any desire to fidget under scrutiny long ago. “You’ll forgive me if I don’t dignify such utter tosh with an answer.”
"Oh," she said, blinking at him. "Hi, Greg. I — that one." And she pointed above her head. "
Draco complied, slipping it on over his head and covering up his come-tacky chest along with all of his scars. He still seemed a little off, blinking owlishly even as his breathing was returning to normal.
like a woman …” She trailed off, shrugging. “I’m no expert on the subject, of course. I suppose it could account for some of the animosity you always felt towards him. Frustration over a discord between your mind and your body. On the one hand you have your head completely focused on Malfoy, all these confusing emotions swimming around that are centered on him, and on the other hand you have no way of expressing it because you’re not aware of any sexual attraction. And he was horrible to you, beyond that. And you were a kid, what could you have done?”
he was projecting some of his own fears onto Potter?
“Oh, and this was
from Kettleburn and a monumental amount of reading from Slughorn. Thursday afternoon, Hermione had scuttled away to the library to start on her essay as soon as they’d finished their last lesson of the day.
“Ron,” he deadpanned, but Ron was still chuckling, and it was very hard for Harry to feel angry with him when he’d missed this banter so much the past week. “You asked me what I liked about him, that’s my answer. Not that his tits
“Oh, please, Ron,” said Hermione, but Harry could see a smile twitching at the corners of her lips. “Cormac was harmless.”
“Ron is

“Thank you,” he said tightly, and giving a curt nod after a moment he turned away when nothing else seemed forthcoming. He’d only gotten a few steps when Theo called out again.
Then he picks up the pot, turns towards Harry, and finally notices him.
He looked about as nervous as Draco was feeling himself, hands shoved into the pockets of his denims once he’d taken off his Invisibility Cloak and — of course — ruffled out his hair in what appeared to be a completely unconscious gesture.
Potter grabbed his bag and Draco lifted his own over his shoulder, annoyed with himself for wondering already the next time they’d see each other, and if he’d have to wait until Wednesday.

Potter chuckles and kisses his cheek, which makes Draco feel slightly less bad. He's truly never minded Daphne but if her feelings must be sacrificed in order for Draco to have a monopoly on Potter's attention, well, that's life.

“Why not?” Harry pushed. His eyes never left Malfoy’s face. “Why won’t you let this thing between us go, Malfoy?”
"Let's stay here tonight," Draco said suddenly, without lifting his head. "Just this once, it's already late anyhow. Theo and Blaise'll just think I went down to breakfast early when they wake up."
“I was in the middle of a conversation, Malfoy,” Harry snapped. “You’ve got no fucking manners, do you?”
Finally he pulled out (smiling at Malfoy's small whimper) and stuck two fingers in his mouth to wet them, then returned them to Malfoy's arse. He pushed in with both of them, a little less careful than he'd been before, and Malfoy seemed to like it because he closed his eyes again and whined low in his throat. Harry couldn't help himself — he leaned forwards and pressed his lips to Malfoy's neck, tasting its sweetness mixed with the tang of sweat and arousal.
"Actually, he uses a lot of mnemonics," said Daphne. She was leaning against Goyle's beefy arm, an open book in her lap she wasn't paying much attention to. "So really he
The punch outside the Defence classroom spread around the school like wildfire, and the fact it had involved Harry Potter only added to the story’s rampant popularity. Nobody seemed to know
“No, it’s not right, Harry!” Granger shouted. She was pink in the cheeks, and Draco suddenly remembered a time, five years ago, when she had looked similarly before slapping him in the face.
Finally, too sensitive, Draco pushes Harry’s hand away and throws an arm across his face, burning a hectic, vital red.
Sufficiently abashed, Draco changed course by nuzzling beneath Harry’s chin, eyes falling closed, and he was relieved to feel Harry drape an arm across his waist and pull him closer. The candles were put out and neither spoke again in the darkness.

, you know?” To his amazement — and endless encouragement — he saw a nascent smile begin to form on Hermione’s face. “Does that sound crazy?”
He steps closer again, and Draco thinks he really might die of humiliation when Potter's hand goes up to his neck, curling around the side and thumbing delicately over his throat, the bump of his Adam's apple. Pulling in shallow breaths, flushed all the way down to his chest, Draco stares into Potter's eyes and wonders if he's just torturing him a bit more before he snaps his neck.

of such a thing, a hex that can change someone’s sex. It’s possible, of course, that it’s only Malfoy’s bone structure that’s changed, you know, I mean, I can’t possibly imagine there’s a spell in the
“He means Wonderwall, Harry,” said Granger, grinning. Harry finally smiled too, and although their little Muggle joke was lost on Weasley and himself he was glad to see that it had apparently been the prodding Harry needed to give in. He set his beer back down and went to get the guitar; something about the way he threw the thin and fraying strap over his head, the way his hands went effortlessly to their places, was unexpectedly attractive. The left one curled easily around the neck of the instrument, heavily-roughened fingers finding their odd positions on the strings, something Draco had always thought looked very painful.
“Because I
try to behave yourselves next time, won’t you?”
“It’s a bit exhausting, isn’t it?” Malfoy said. He was breathing heavily, and some of his platinum-blond hairs had fallen in front of his eyes. The short pixie cut he’d been sporting two months ago had begun to grow out a bit, and frankly, Harry adored it.
"He knows his mum," Harry said, smiling stupidly. Draco laughed and kicked his shin.
Finally, on Wednesday evening, while Harry, Ron, and Hermione were doing homework, the door to the boys' staircase opened loudly and Goyle came stomping out in a fury. He stopped in front of them, looked directly at Harry, but apparently he decided against whatever he'd been about to say because he stormed out through the portrait hole to perilous cries from Sir Cadogan. Looking around, Harry saw that Theodore Nott and Blaise Zabini were both watching, which meant the Slytherin dormitory was empty now save for Draco. He thought briefly about sneaking up there for only a moment before deciding it would be stupid.
Malfoy made an impatient noise and wrinkled his nose distastefully. “That man …”
Harry laughed and it sent a chill up Draco’s spine.
"She's really done it," said Ron, voice filled with awe. "Looks like he's about to bolt, doesn't he?"
if you make us look bad in front of the Israelis. It’s unprecedented for the Cup to be held in the same country twice within such a short time span, and since the last one here was in —”
“I only wanted to say I’m proud of you for listening to her. It seems like you two worked some things out.”
“Me too,” said Harry. “I make all those plans I have to cancel because I want it so badly, and
“If you want to talk to somebody about it,” Harry began carefully, unsure of what Malfoy's reception might be to the idea of Mind Healing, “I could ask Hermione to help find —”
“I …” Harry’s voice sounded strangled, he had lost colour, and his eyes were wild behind his glasses. “You … mine?” he stuttered. Teeth chattering now, Draco nodded. He wanted to stand up but didn’t think his legs would support him. They felt no more substantial that warm jelly. “You’re … you’re pregnant with ... with
“No, go on, Potter,” Draco bit out, standing up from the bed with his head suddenly filled with an angry, miserable buzzing. It was as though Potter had rooted around in his deepest, darkest fears — the ones he wouldn’t acknowledge even to himself when he could help it — and pulled them into the light. “You’re talking about my father, right? You’re saying my
"All right," Harry nodded. He dropped a kiss on Malfoy's cheek before leaving and heading back to Ron out on the pitch.
Draco draws back and pushes some of his hair out of his face, considering Harry from his place straddling his hips.
The second time it’s to make up for the first failed attempt, and Draco puts more thought into it. Not a
A hearty congrats to those of you who guessed correctly, and a hearty congrats to myself for somehow keeping my mouth shut until the big reveal. I hope as many people as possible are pleased with the direction I've decided to go, and I hope even more you'll enjoy the last few chapters, which are going to be a series of vignettes following our boys through the pregnancy.
It could have been comical the way Harry followed his movement as he slid down the door to the ground, except it wasn’t. It was infuriating, actually, and felt at once like more than he could possibly handle and exactly what he needed. His forehead and his hands went back to the wood, bracing himself as Harry, kneeling behind him, continued fucking his beautiful, merciless fingers and stimulating Draco’s overworked prostate.

“Can I take your shirt off?” he mumbled against Malfoy’s lips, his hand squeezing gently and eliciting another breathy whimper.
Taking all of this in was a feat on its own and he couldn't organise his thoughts enough to come up with anything to ask. Instead he merely shook his head.
"Dinner," Harry said with a grin. Draco gaped at him.
again, throwing the headboard against the wall with every slap of skin. Draco utterly loses himself in it, his whole being, every sensation, every nerve-ending centreing in on what it feels like to be well and truly fucked by Harry Potter, who seems to have finally begun losing himself to the moment as well. At some point all that tension reaches an impossible peak, Draco's whole body goes rigid and then everything flies apart. His neck arches beneath the hand curled around it, back bowing, head pressing into a pillow that smells like Potter, and Potter himself keeps fucking into him while Draco shivers and jerks through his second orgasm, like nothing he's ever experienced before now. He has no earthly concept of how long it lasts, just that his body is still being pounded into, and the continuous, random spikes of pleasure haven't even started subsiding yet when Potter pulls out and starts jerking himself. Come spurts out in ropes not a second later, covering Draco's chest and belly. He watches, wide-eyed, heart racing, as Potter's hand squeezes and pulls at his pulsing cock, until it finally drops away and he lowers himself to latch onto Draco's mouth in a breathless kiss.
“You’re so fucking annoying when you’re high,” says Draco, trying for scolding except that his eyes are bright and he can’t quite keep a smile off his face. “Give me that.” He snatches the joint from Harry and brings it to his lips, letting the smoke drift out through his nose and looking like the world’s loveliest and smallest dragon. He must see the way Harry’s looking at him because after he takes his second hit he leans down with a coy grin and Harry meets him halfway in a kiss so Draco can breathe the smoke into his mouth. His tongue follows shortly after and Harry loves the way he can taste the weed on it, earthy and bittersweet.
, and he was hoping desperately that being back here would make him feel closer to them again.
"By the time we actually fucked, yeah, course I did," says Potter.
. Because you’re right … what’s the point? But every time he looks at me, I don’t need a point.
“What about Dumbledore?” Potter asks. “Have you prayed to him?”
Tucking himself clumsily back into his pants but not bothering to zip back up, he reached down and grabbed Draco’s hand, pulling him to his feet and standing as well. His mouth was on Draco’s in a matter of seconds, and Draco moaned into it, imagining Potter tasting himself on his tongue.
“I know. I’m sorry. You freaked me out, springing it on me like that.”
go away? His face was getting hotter every second, and to make matters worse, the smell of Harry was making him unbearably randy. “Just an observation, that’s all.”
“An understanding?” Harry echoes blankly.
“Whoa, wait, are you letting her in?” Harry straightened up in his chair, looking suddenly panicked. “Let me put a fucking shirt on, Merlin’s tits, Draco.”
“What did I just say?” Harry bit out. It sounded much less steady than he’d have liked.
“You do remember this film was
do. I know for sure."
Potter.
"Ron," he says, "come on. Leave it. This wasn't cool."
“Malfoy,” he agreed. He couldn’t help a sudden, exasperated grin, thinking of the times they’d sat in this pub
“Thank you, Professor,” Harry said, shifting a little awkwardly in his seat. He glanced up at the portrait of Dumbledore behind McGonagall’s desk, and although he appeared to be sleeping, Harry thought he could see a smile twitch at the corner of his painted mouth. “Er — would it be too late to do now, d'you s'pose?”
"I just don't understand why you two can't talk," Weasley persists. Hermione heaves a small sigh.
“Pansy,” Draco said, knowing in his gut it was true. “She’s been avoiding me since term started. I’ll bet she let it slip to her mother over the holidays.”
"Right," he said, thrilled. "Well I'll see you out in the stands then." He ran his thumb over the bruise on Draco's neck. "And you should cover this up if you don't want them to know."
“I was thinking for Ron’s birthday,” said Harry, looking at once moronic and attractive holding his cigarette with his thumb and index finger like it was a joint, “he’s always threatening to eat his body weight in things. I wanna get him, like … I dunno, his body weight in Chocolate Frogs or something. How would we calculate, like, how much his body weight would be in Chocolate Frogs?”
Taking his Cloak with him and using the Map as an extra precaution to avoid running into anybody, Harry only shed it once he’d stepped inside the humid air of the mammoth bathroom, seeing that the tub was filled with steaming water, yet remained empty.
“Sprout retired end of last year,” says Malfoy. He’s finally recovered from the shock and is pulling his gloves off now, setting them down next to where Harry had put the pot after snatching it out of the air. He gives Harry a searching look that’s difficult to read.
Ron blinked again, several times. Whatever the thoughts going through his head, they seemed to be causing him pain, for he was still grimacing, the muscles in his jaw clenching rhythmically. “Malfoy,” he said, as if for confirmation.
"Good," he said, tucking himself back into his jeans. Draco watched him do it. It was starting to dawn on him now: he'd just taken Draco Malfoy's virginity. Brave new world, indeed. "I need you to say it for me, though, 'cause you're acting really weird."
“You do that.”

“No, I don’t think so. I think it’s really lovely. And at the very least, he’ll know you’re thinking about him, won’t he?”
“Maybe.
"I would never do that," Harry said firmly.
no good at sharing,” Harry fired back, an eyebrow raised as he went over to the tub and sat down at the edge, dangling his feet in the water. Malfoy made a breathy sound of irritation that did more than just tickle Harry’s funny bone — a tightening in his lower belly startled him, but he managed not to let
It was now down to one week, and the anxiety was starting to feel like a persistent weight on his chest.
,” Potter half-laughed, drawing the word out mockingly. “So I imagined you reaching for the bloodroot on the top shelf, then?”
“I promise not to let him,” Harry grinned. “Please, Draco. You said you wanted to do this properly, right?”
Harry laughs and kisses him again, thumbing over Draco's cheekbone. "Yeah. Wasn't all that satisfying though."
“First cousin, once removed,” Draco corrected him quietly. For a long minute there was silence, and Draco took the opportunity to gather up all of his courage and ignore every warning his brain was throwing at him. His heart was full, being near Potter again, and for once in his life he was going to listen to that instead. “Look … Potter …” He broke off, and Potter looked at him with a mixture of curiosity and expectation. “I … I shouldn’t have tried to hex you. I shouldn’t have kicked you out of my room. I just …” But Potter was shaking his head and there was a comforting little grin on his face now.
… his own
“Umbridge,” he said, shrugging. “She made me use that Black Quill for my detentions with her. Carved this neat little message into my hand every night for a few weeks. Really excellent times. Still stings a bit, you know, when I talk about her. That’s where pride gets you, eh?”
“He’s an idiot! He’s
"No," Draco shook his head. He smiled a little. "I probably would have kicked you out, to be honest."
Draco thought back to the panic attack a flash of green light had induced in Potter during that Defence class and suspected that yes, Potter had indeed done the impossible a second time.
He shrugged and grabbed for one of the beers on the table, wandlessly magicking the cap off. “I dunno. When it came up, I guess.”
“Is she really called the Fat Lady?” he said quietly as they approached. Harry snorted.
Harry drags on his cigarette and Draco makes a show of rolling his eyes. It occurs to him in a morbid, existential sort of way that he could address the elephant in the room right now. He could just say it, easy as that. And then they’d have to talk about it. He
And to Harry’s delight, even his worries over Malfoy couldn’t dampen the wonderful feeling of being at the Weasleys’ house, most especially during the holidays. Bill and George came and went regularly, and even Kingsley found time to stop by for dinner now and then. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny spent long hours playing two-on-two Quidditch and then huddling up beneath blankets in the sitting room in front of the fire, large mugs of hot cocoa cupped in their cold hands while Crookshanks wound between their legs, purring loudly.
Ron was back as Keeper and Ginny as a Chaser. Peakes and Coote were once again his Beaters. Demelza hadn’t come back, but Dean did and he beat out his competition beautifully, so Harry had wound up needing only one new Chaser. This came in the form of Izabella Scrivner, a fifth-year with a penchant for dodging Bludgers and scoring long-range goals. He especially appreciated what seemed to be an utter lack of interest in whom Harry was, but rather in proving her talent. She was nearly as good as Ginny, and Harry suspected she might one day make a career out of it.
“Are you daft, Pansy?” Blaise asked, his calm tone of voice making it sound as though the question was genuine. Pansy scowled. “Half the scholars who have written about Potter are foreign witches and wizards. The Dark Lord may not have been a threat outside of Britain yet, but Potter’s survival of the Killing Curse did not go unnoticed by people in other countries. Beyond that, since you seem not to have grasped what
not a big deal. Muggles have got some really nasty shit they do; this stuff is harmless.”
“Draco,” said Theo, standing up from the chair in which he’d been lounging with an unreadable gleam in his eyes. “I was wondering where you were.”
Potter grins, eyes lighting up.
Narcissa napped after her shower and he and Draco, with Teddy's limited but enthusiastic help, put together a sprawling dinner. Narcissa didn't eat much of it, but that was partly because she wouldn't stop holding Draco's hand with both of her own. Draco seemed unwilling to let go of hers either.
Potter's hand moves away and when it comes back it's slick with spit, finally dipping between Draco's arse cheeks to rub over his hole. Draco shudders and presses back against him, prompting Potter to drop his other hand to Draco's waist in order to steady him. Potter drags his finger maddeningly back and forth over his entrance, playing with his sensitive rim until Draco's ready to snap at him, before finally pushing it inside. Draco chokes out a gasp, cock twitching, mouth hanging open as Potter starts fucking him with it. After a minute he pulls it out, wets his fingers again, and then pushes back in with three this time, drawing out of Draco another broken noise.
“You are such an

“Do you know, Potter,” he said softly, smiling at the eye-roll he received for the use of Harry’s last name, “I think you might be the best thing that could have happened to me in all of this.”
He pulled back, stomach rolling anxiously. Over his shoulder, he saw that the Auror, Dawlish, was tucked in a corner across the room where he couldn’t overhear them, looking politely away.
And when he comes out — with wet hair, so that theory is definitely accurate — Draco aims his wand and doesn’t bother casting the jinx non-verbally, because he wants it to be powerful.
like that. But he must have seen something in Draco’s eyes — desperation, Draco was willing to bet — because he didn’t say anything at all. He merely held Draco’s gaze a few moments, asking the question silently, and then his hand was slipping beneath Draco’s robes … and froze, his eyes shooting back up, wide once again.
Not for the first time, right in the middle of their game, Crookshanks leapt onto the table and scattered the stones, causing Harry to laugh and Ron to let out a heavily dramatic groan of frustration.
“Shut up. No.”
"Well what if I
“Keep on struggling, Malfoy, I love watching a Death Eater squirm like a little
“Pansy, he defeated the Dark Lord,” Blaise drawled. “He is quite literally the most famous wizard alive.”
“It wasn’t a fling,” he said. He moved a little closer and Harry watched him carefully, eyes flickering once down to Draco’s mouth. “I didn’t even sleep with anyone else the whole time.”
"Fair enough," said Harry, gesturing for Draco to lead the way. "Away with me, then."
?” He clicks his teeth shut, glowing with embarrassment. “
“Things keep cropping up.” Malfoy sighed and pushed a bit of his fringe out of his eyes. “I asked the Healers and McGonagall not to tell my mum, and since I’m of age, they legally couldn’t, so she still doesn’t know. I suppose I’ll have to tell her eventually, though, if this doesn’t go away by the holidays.
“Does it draw up powerful emotions?”

He noticed these things with a sort of clinical detachment, not proud of himself for the size of his arms but rather noting it as a fact: he’d always been a little bit scrawny, and now puberty was changing that. An interesting observation and not much more.

As Ron had so eloquently stuttered the other day, Malfoy's bits and pieces

“I — er —”
it with this Potter obsession everyone seems to have developed?” Pansy complained, banging the textbook onto the table and sliding it towards Draco. “I am utterly sick of hearing about him everywhere. Can’t even read the news anymore without running across some new rumour …”
"Will this cure the sadness too, then?"
"I was too," he admitted. Yet neither of them had said a thing about it out loud. It would, he'd come to understand, take a long time for him and Harry to learn to communicate effectively. They had time, though — they had so much time. "But he did, yeah. He knew it was me."
“That’s true,” Draco allowed, “you might be in luck, then.”
“What d’you like about him? I mean, I could give you a dozen and a half reasons I like Hermione right off the top of my head, y’know? Do you … I mean, do you
his muscles tightening, building up to some impossible crescendo.
“Well … it was bound to happen eventually, right?” Ron tried, apparently of the mindset that this was a comforting thing to say. Hermione squawked at him indignantly and smacked his arm. Harry, to his own immense surprise, managed a small smile.
He sees none of that. Potter merely shrugs.
"Get away from him!" Goyle yelled. His voice echoed menacingly around the room. He started towards the Slytherin table, shoving people aside like rag dolls as he went, and Harry saw that both Slughorn and McGonagall were sweeping down from the head table in their direction. Goyle had already reached them, though, and he grabbed the Slytherin boy by the front of his robes, shaking him so hard his glasses fell off his nose.
"She really apologised?" Hermione asked.
"Harry," he gasped, "I —"
It was becoming increasingly difficult to think of him as a boy, and this was the part that was causing Harry the most confusion. He wondered whether everyone else felt as dazed and intrigued by the whole thing as he did but got the impression it wasn’t so. In fact, everyone else seemed to have taken it as a go-ahead to double the harassment.
"And the other part?" he asks.
“So, er — Draco, can I ask you something?”
Maturity be damned. He wanted to see Malfoy again.
"H-Harry," he gasps, the tightening in his belly creeping again towards an even more terrifying precipice. The hand on his thigh transfers between his legs and there's suddenly stimulation on his clit, rubbing ceaseless circles into that tiny bundle of nerves while Potter picks up the pace again and batters Draco's insides with his cock, pumping into him over and over and
“Me too,” said Harry. His throat felt suddenly tight. “I know that they’d love you, though.”
“Jesus, Potter!” he sniped, but when he tried to squirm away, Harry stopped him with strong hands around his waist. “Has anyone ever told you how
, it had been a small comment Malfoy had made on Friday, in that empty classroom, that had finally brought Harry around to a rather startling realisation: he
“Whose?”
“Malfoy,” she said.
Only half his attention is on his potion the rest of the lesson, but it doesn’t matter either way: he could have created the Elixir of Life and Slughorn would still have been more interested in whatever sub-par version of their assignment Potter cooks up.
me?!” he repeated loudly.
“Not as far as you know, at least,” Potter said, and it took a moment for the rest of the class to digest this very dry, almost facetious-sounding joke. There was laughter after a minute, and Draco wondered whether any of them had caught onto the irritation in Potter’s words.
In no mood to start an argument, he merely sent her a scowl.
"It's just how we are," he says quietly, and then, with a sick feeling, corrects himself: "How we
“An absurd notion, of course.”
"Well I said I was
“What the fuck!” Malfoy sobbed, pressing his forehead into the sofa as his body shook. Harry could feel his heart slamming into his ribs and took several deep breaths, sweat dripping down his back.
Harry watched him for a moment, stalling, building himself up to the task of floating a suggestion he'd been contemplating for a few weeks now.
“What?” Harry said stupidly, shaking his head like he was trying to clear it. His heart was no longer frozen but racing now, racing like it had been
. Dealing with this hex, it’s brought out a more vulnerable side of him. I understand if it’s difficult for you to accept, and I certainly don’t expect you to —”
he needed to produce anything corporeal, and although Potter was very encouraging, a sneaking sense of doubt had begun to cloud Draco’s mind.
“Yeah,” Harry cut her off, releasing a deep sigh. “As long as they don’t expect me to give a speech or anything then I s'pose it’s not a big deal.”
Mulling this information over, Draco grabbed his wand from his bedside table and a cast a Geminio Charm on the chair, instantly doubling it. He preened under the shocked look that appeared on Harry’s face.
“The band who does the song.”
“I don’t owe you an explanation,” said Potter. “Look, Nott … there’s nothing I can do about your dad. I’m sorry for what you’re going through, but I —”
, too tight to open him up much more than that. Malfoy made a high keening noise that brought a satisfied smirk to Harry’s face.
left?” He squeezed her hands, dipping his head to catch her eyes again when she’d dropped them to her lap. “D'you think I’ll ever forget the number of times you’ve pulled me out of the fire?” He shook his head, realising suddenly that this was long overdue. “You’re not just my best friend, Hermione — you’re my sister. While I’m busy saving everyone else’s arses, you’re busy saving mine. And I guess I’ve never really said thank you, but I
The fingers of the hand tangled in Harry’s thick black hair tightened. Eyes still squeezed shut, Draco’s sensual awareness shrank until the sounds of the library were nothing more than background noise and the only thing in the world that was real was the feeling of Harry’s mouth on his throbbing clit. And he was relentless — the pressure never stopped, not even to tease with the tip of his tongue; it was constant stimulation, the hot, wet suction of Harry’s mouth, and the orgasm that followed came fast and hard. Draco’s jaw fell open and his whole body shuddered as it washed over him, hips twitching against Harry’s mouth helplessly under the desk. Harry kept at it through the whole thing, as the exquisite pleasure climbed and finally peaked, and still he didn’t stop. One arm clamped down harder on Draco’s leg, holding him in place while the other migrated between his legs to slip two fingers deep into his pussy. Draco heard a gasping noise come out of his own mouth and had to slap a hand over it just in time for a second climax to bulldoze into him, little spurts of fluid squirting out of his cunt around Harry’s fingers.
! You just want a fucking
"Draco," Harry said after a few moments of silence, looking at him. Other students outside were gathering, shameless in their eavesdropping. "Did you call her that?"
“I definitely, definitely want to.”
He bows his head and closes his eyes against the soft glow of the stained glass, smelling the old wood and the scent of the incense, and when he hears the door open behind him and feels the presence of powerful magic make his hair stand up, it’s hard not to let those two things become meaningfully related.
~2,500
“Typical,” Malfoy drawled.
There's a knock on the door, and Draco had been so lost in Harry that the sharp sound makes him jump, heart kicking into overdrive.
For a moment Harry was stunned, but then a crazy idea occurred to him: what if she just wanted to be around Goyle? This seemed to be Hermione's thinking as well, because suddenly she was very enthusiastic.
“Do you really think Hermione would go in on a joke like that?”
"What?" he said again. "What is it?"
It was tidy in a way that Harry’s dorm had never been — wouldn’t have been even if he’d been living alone, he supposed. Even the contents of Malfoy's open trunk were tidy. With the door shut behind them, he pulled off the Cloak and set it aside on an armchair near the bed, the cushions of which were the same shade of green as the bed’s velvet curtains.
is that supposed to mean?”
Harry looked at Malfoy again, but Malfoy only lowered his gaze back to his book.
A high keening noise started in his throat and turned into a helpless whimper when Harry tightened his hold and shoved a knee between Draco’s legs.
The sole occupant stood in front of one of the mirrors, shirtless and wearing what looked like a very expensive, silky green brassiere. Harry, turning immediately red at the sight of so much exposed pale skin and undeniably appealing curves, managed to shield his eyes with a hand and turn away just as Malfoy spun around and spotted him with a gasp.
A muscle clenched in Malfoy's jaw. "Potter —"
"It's actually astonishing you two made it to your seventh year."
than okay, because as you seem to have guessed, Draco did come find me, and I just spent the night with him.”
"I don't believe it," Draco said quietly. "I just don't believe it."
“Harry —”
him. His lips folded over the sensitive head, sucking lightly, and then he was opening wider and Harry groaned as he was taken into that wet warmth. It was like nothing he’d ever felt, the slight suction, the velvety inside of a mouth as it hallowed around him, the feeling of a hot tongue pressing up against his swollen flesh. And of course that it was
Draco had stopped paying attention to what they were saying, though. Either because the music itself had something haunting about its melody or because it was Harry playing it, or perhaps a combination of both, Draco felt a pit of emotion form in his chest to round off the edges of his growing arousal.
Apparently this had not been what McGonagall was expecting, because any trace of humourous scepticism left her face immediately. She looked suddenly stern, although Harry had an inkling that was a product of confusion.
“Is it really enough to forgive him, Harry? Does that deep-down something-else make up for the things he did? For
He bottomed out and brought their mouths back together. It was everything he could do not to pull out and slam back into that tight channel of heat.
“I’m gonna go find Ron and Hermione,” said Harry. He wanted to say something else to the tune of
"At least you were having sex."
“I don’t know,” he says. He holds his stomach and bends forward, letting the rain pound his back, heavier still. There’s a flash of light and he counts to three and an earth-shattering crack of thunder makes the ground beneath them shudder. All he can smell, all he can hear or feel is the rain, and then a sudden warmth on the back of his neck where Potter’s hand is. His face is suddenly close, too.
"Everything good?" he mumbled sleepily. Draco hummed into the kiss he planted on Harry's mouth.
"Found it," Harry said smugly. Draco could only moan out his agreement, grip tightening on Harry's arms when he began rubbing incessantly against his prostate, but it was when Harry leaned down and licked a stripe up the underside of Draco's cock that he really thought he might lose it before they got any farther.
"I like ... being around you," Harry said, shrugging modestly. "I like how you're always blushing around me lately —"
“Your clothes came,” she explained, taking a seat beside the parcel and crossing one leg over the other primly. She eyed his exposed torso, breasts hidden beneath a silky brassiere, expression unreadable. “There’s a dress in there I’ll need to take home during the holidays. Mother says she wants to see me in it. I think she was glad for an excuse to do some shopping — she didn’t ask any questions even though I practically requested a new wardrobe.”
"What's Grimmauld Place?"
Malfoy gaped and Harry threw back his head and laughed. There was really nothing in the world as exhilarating as taking the piss out of Draco Malfoy.
they knew how much it would irk him. But it hadn’t just been the Gryffindors; even the Slytherins had been clapping, save for a small few closest to the door, which Harry immediately identified as Malfoy, Zabini, Parkinson, Bulstrode, Goyle, and Nott. It didn’t bother him the way the applause did, but it did make him curious. After all, he’d vouched for them himself when the question of whether or not to let them return arose, and as for Malfoy … well, he would have been behind bars along with his father had Harry not personally attended the trial and spoken on that ungrateful prat’s behalf.
Draco looked up and met his eye, and Harry saw that yes, that was exactly what he meant.
"No, we were waiting for you," said Hermione. "Shall we wait for him too?"
“Easy,” Harry whispered soothingly, just as though he had peered directly into Draco’s mind and read his frantic thoughts. He pressed several wet, lingering kisses just beneath the line of Draco’s jaw, adding, “I’ll do anything you want. I’ve got you. Just relax.”
“Draco,” Harry said, his voice hardly above a whisper. He put a hand on Draco’s cheek and Draco saw his eyes flitting restlessly across his face, like he was trying to read his thoughts. “I’ll come with you. Do you want me to come with?”
Harry started moving his fingers again and kissed Draco's warm, flushed cheek. Only when Draco began squirming did he pull them out and, releasing Draco's wrists to hold his hips steady, slide his cock back into him. Draco arched and squeezed around him, arms falling to his sides so his hands could ball in the sheets.
"Yes, the Friar said," McGonagall said gravely. "Where is he, Potter?"
The other, incredibly, was studying with Granger. Harry had proved completely useless when it came to focusing on homework for more than forty-five minutes at a time, but when he and Weasley fucked off to throw a Quaffle around or play chess in the Gryffindor common room, Draco learned that Granger was capable of studying for hours at a time, sometimes late into the night, until Madam Pince was shooing them out of the library.
“Potter!” he exclaims, trying and failing horrifically to dislodge him. “You barbarian, let me go!”
"Just c'mere," Harry said again, grinning. There was a part of him that wished everyone else could see this, an utterly docile Draco Malfoy with stars in his pretty grey eyes and a throughly submissive willingness to be manhandled by Harry Potter. But of course there was a much larger part of himself that thought he would simply die if Draco showed this side of him to anybody else.
Seeing that the house-elves had already sorted the presents according to person, Harry took a seat next to his pile. Looking a bit closer he was really surprised by the amount of presents but most definitely by the amount of letters that made up his pile. Going through his friends in his head he actually wondered from whom some letters and presents were.
“Well, that would be all, for now, mister Potter. We will be sending your previous bank statements to your guardian as soon as possible and after that, they will be sent out monthly.” Ripclaw said. Looking towards Severus Snape he asked, “would you also want us to send the heir copies to misted Potter?” Nodding his head Severus Snape replied, “that would be preferable, yes.” After nodding his head and writing something down Ripclaw turned towards Harry. “Would you want us to charge all fees of today to the Potter vault?” After looking at Severus Snape, Harry nodded his head replying, “Yes good idea”.
if you wanna chat! ❤️
Potter crawled on top of him, between Draco’s legs. He could instantly feel the hardness of Potter’s cock when their hips slotted together, making him pull in a shuddering breath as he pulled Potter down to crash their mouths together again. But Potter only indulged him a few moments before he was breaking away, hands tugging Draco’s shirt off and then removing his own. They came back together messily, and broke apart once more with panting breaths to remove the rest. It didn’t even seem to occur to them to hesitate, and it was only a feeble voice inside his head that made Draco wonder whether he was comfortable being completely naked in front of Potter in this new body — or at

“We’ll just be going to the hospital wing,” he said, and shot warning glances at both of his friends. With one last cautious look at Harry, he scarpered, disappearing around the nearest corner.
“What on earth are you on about, Potter?” she said sharply, eyes flashing. “
week?” he said, mock-surprise colouring his voice with sarcasm. Malfoy’s pouty lips thinned with irritation and Harry could see a muscle working in his jaw. “I dunno, Malfoy, I really can’t promise something like that. You know me, bullheaded and reckless is all I know. Besides, how else do you expect me to relax? It’s like me telling you not to take it up the arse anymore — would you

part of him, would have loved nothing more than to turn away the help. To yell at Potter later, because Granger was the last person Draco wanted privy to all this.
"You should fuck me," he said softly. Harry smiled against his lips.
There was no response, though. He had just started to think Harry had seriously
"But he's been doing better, Goyle," said Harry. "These last few weeks of holiday, he was
Draco had heard stories. Mostly snippets of conversation illicitly overheard, hiding out behind closed doors with his ear pressed to the wall. That had been when he was younger, mostly. When he’d been curious for curiosity’s sake. Before his childhood had been blasted to smithereens and suddenly bullying Potter was the last thing on his mind.
This, Draco now saw, was not the case.
"Just a few hours," said Draco. Finally appearing to come to some decision, he reached out and pushed some of Harry's fringe off his forehead. It was so gentle, so full of unspoken emotion, that Harry had to swallow past a growing lump in his throat. "How do you feel?"

“You’re sure about that, are you?” Draco teased. One of his slim legs tangled between Harry’s, and his perpetually cold feet slid along Harry’s calf. “In spite of everything?”
This thought reminded him forcibly that Harry didn’t have that luxury.
One of Harry’s hands found its way back to Malfoy’s breast, but this time — lips moving over the hollow of Malfoy’s throat — he pulled the cup down and let his fingers brush across soft skin, groaning against Malfoy’s neck when he felt his nipple. Malfoy wasn’t stopping him, so Harry lifted his head and looked down, swallowing hard at the sight. The juxtaposition of this Malfoy — so utterly debauched — against the prim and proper Malfoy he’d known for so long was enough to make Harry laugh with delight.
Malfoy looked at him, and when their eyes met, Harry felt his gut wrench.
“That would be the best place to study, yes,” Draco said, thinking of Potter’s note and suppressing a grin.
Of course, he had to keep this to himself for the next hour, until he was able to get Granger and Weasley out of the flat. And once he
Harry nodded. “He talked me down from a panic attack,” he said softly. Ron looked uncomfortable about this knowledge and stared down at his glass of whisky. “That wasn’t the first time I’d been, you know, attracted to him, though … it was just, er, the first time I kissed him.”
A cold, calculating smile twisted his father’s mouth. “Ah … I see. You’ve come for my approval before Azkaban has turned me into a husk. My, my, Draco … we
“How is
Voldemort with your wand,” he said slowly. The name made Draco flinch. It would never cease to amaze him, the way Potter bandied that word about.

to do. Been sort of a weird night, hasn’t it? I don't think it can get much weirder."
"No," he says without moving.
Their make-up seventh year has been like that so far: boring. Most of the time Draco has the sense to appreciate boredom over — you know, perpetual terror. Other times he feels so understimulated he starts resorting to things like stealing from Slughorn’s locked ingredients cupboard to make complicated, illicit potions, or writing long-winded theses on the mutable properties of moonstone, or … bugging Potter. That last is the most fun, obviously. Or it would be if it ever worked.
"Kitty," Leo said around his thumb, pointing with his free hand to Crookshanks who was slinking by. As if he'd heard this Crookshanks came near and flicked his tail at Leo's foot, making him giggle, before running away.
? It both sounded and felt absurd, yet Draco was inclined to believe Granger knew what she was talking about.
“Yeah, he’s really good,” said Weasley. He nodded towards the acoustic guitar hanging on the wall; Draco had taken notice of it the first time he’d seen Harry’s flat but never paid it much mind after that, taking it for decoration, or perhaps an unused gift. “He’ll play if you ask him. He doesn’t like showing off.”
“I’ve never done anything like that before!”
“Well … Ron pulled someone off him, Harry.” Harry gaped at her. “Remember when Boothby asked you to stay after our lesson yesterday morning? I had Arithmancy after Defence, I went to class, but you and Ron have that free hour. In fact, I have that class

A myriad of things passed across Potter’s face, but before he answered, he looked down at the old, battered-looking watch he’d been wearing since the start of term.
"I see," Pratchett says with a hum.
It was what made Draco sure his father would not last very long in there.
"No," Malfoy said finally. "Just ... there's nothing to talk about. I have nothing to say."
god, anybody who’s listening.
“That isn’t an answer, Potter,” Draco bit out. “And you’re the one who did it first, so you’re the one who owes an explanation. I wouldn’t have even
just trying to —"
"Get off me," Draco says, pushing weakly at Harry, fighting back his own smile with everything in him. It's not all that successful.
Harry heaved a deep, frustrated-sounding breath. He looked up into Draco’s eyes, and although Draco could practically
But he didn’t have time right now to start going down that path, not when he needed to be one hundred percent focused if they wanted to win this match. Kenny Helstrom may have had his arrogant opinions, but with or without Cedric Diggory on their team Hufflepuff was strong this year. Peakes and Coote had dropped in on their training sessions at Harry’s request, and the information they had brought back was nothing to be taken lightly.
“Harry …” she began, a note of hysterical and defiant disbelief coloring her tone. “Oh, Harry, you haven’t …”
Malfoy blinks at him. “What?” he says blankly
His chest clenched at the sight of a necklace suspended inside a glass case, the pendant of which was a miniature Snitch.
Draco, pressing his lips together to stifle every sound that was trying to wrench itself right out of his gut every time Potter’s fingers pressed up a little harder, merely shook his head.
Draco took a step forward, his anger utterly forgotten, and placed a cold hand on Harry’s cheek. Something very deep within him had shifted, and he felt quite as though he was facing one of those moments in life you usually only saw clearly in retrospect. It was the proverbial fork in the road, the final chance either to close his eyes and jump, or to back away for good.
need you to lay off me for a bit. It’s a bloody pain in the arse being hounded by reporters and having my life splashed across the news for everybody to judge at their own fucking leisure. It's worse than ever with the Cup around the corner.” He paused, saw Hermione’s lower lip wobbling precariously, and sighed again. “I’m sorry, ‘Mione. Really. It’s not your fault I’m on edge.”
“I suppose, if I was in your position, I would want somebody to help me.”
Draco looks over Potter's face, his earnest green eyes, the scar not quite hidden beneath his messy hair, and he can't imagine why
He took in a deep breath and let it out through his nose. “I’d … I’d like my old wand back.”
“Even if Theo isn’t there?”
“Funny, I don’t remember asking your honest opinion,” he sniped, but Hermione, apparently, had had enough.
All of this was enough to make Draco’s breathing feel a bit shallower.
"I don't care," said Goyle flatly. It felt a little like arguing with a troll, except some part of Harry couldn't help but admire how much unconditional loyalty Goyle had towards Draco. "You'll only make it worse."
“That’s not really news, though, is it?”
thing, it’s just …” He looked up again, thick brows knitted. “So, after you spoke to your mum last week, you told me your dad’s not doing well in Azkaban. And you’d mentioned, y’know, how you’re afraid by the time you get to visit him, he might not be … lucid anymore.” Draco nodded silently; an intuition was creeping up on him, but it seemed so absurd he pushed it firmly out of his mind, refocusing on Harry’s words. “And then if you’re still in this body by that time … So, anyway, I decided to try something. I didn’t wanna tell you until Kingsley got back to me and I knew for sure, and yesterday I got an owl from him.”
Malfoy looked over his shoulder with a raised brow.
"Well good, because now it's coming when you least expect it," he says, and with a last kiss pressed to the corner of Draco's mouth Harry lets go of him and returns to the table, where he starts eating without glancing at the

And was that what he was doing? Making Potter
The tattoo helps.
It was just past three o'clock in the morning when the baby was born via c-section. Harry was the first to hold him, and it was, he decided, the single most incredible moment of his life.
"Okay," he said. Draco let out a breath he hadn't realised he was holding. "Let's talk about it."
"Correct," says Draco, going to sit beside him. Potter shoots him a smirk as he picks up his Quidditch robes and lays them haphazardly over his trunk. "She really doesn't deserve it."
Harry shook his head. "No, it's okay. I don't think he'll come down for a little while and I'm starving, let's go."
"Are you half-troll or something, Weasley?" Draco snaps, trying to keep his voice low but he knows he hasn't fully succeeded. He feels like taking his wand out and hexing him right here in his own sitting room, damn the consequences. "Your inexhaustible supply of stupidity consistently leaves me in awe of you."
“Why are
Malfoy, right in his arrogant face — he quickly overcame that urge and balled his fists at his sides instead, knowing there wasn’t a chance in hell he was about to hit a girl, real or hexed. Malfoy must have figured out why Harry wasn’t fighting back and this seemed to push him over some invisible edge, one that Harry guessed he’d probably been toeing the line of since the day he’d been trapped inside this female body.
friend, actually. I was hoping we could try and talk this out.”
"Mum," he said. She looked up and her eyes widened a little. "I have to tell you something."
Draco makes a game of kissing his neck while he’s trying to roll the joints, causing him to fumble several times to the general chagrin of the room at large.
Draco looks at him, chewing on his lip. He looks so vulnerable, so soft in his night clothes, one side drooping off a pale shoulder, his hair in slight disarray. In this moment Harry thinks that love is such a strange and chaotic emotion, an abstract, totally intangible thing that makes you show up on someone’s doorstep in the middle of the night begging for —
It wasn’t that Harry had expected the date to go
"Andromeda, you mean?" Harry asked, surprised. He'd seen her plenty of times over the summer when he'd gone to visit Teddy but she'd neglected to mention her nephew would be staying with her the final week of August, or that he'd be going back to her after Hogwarts.
“Professor, I … have to ask for a favour again,” he said, taking the chair across from the desk and thinking — as he supposed he always would — of the days when it had been Dumbledore on the other side. At this request she looked up sharply, peering at him over the rim of her square spectacles.
this way, but I don’t see how anybody could get past the fact it’s Malfoy, d’you know what I mean?”

He comes with a weak, tormented cry, squeezing over the head of his cock as it starts pulsing, and Harry picks up the speed of his thrusts, slamming into him while Draco shivers and convulses through an orgasm that leaves him unable to hold himself up. It's only Harry that keeps him steady, and before he's even come down from it fully Harry's manoeuvring him onto his back, spreading his legs, and sinking back inside him. He isn't gentle anymore, pounding his cock into Draco like he's lost his mind, skin slapping wetly, and finally Draco feels him start coming, releasing a broken noise as he does. He drops his forehead against Draco's collarbone and keeps thrusting into his body relentlessly, working himself through it, only stuttering to a stop after what feels like a full minute.
Her shapely eyebrows come together. She looks unimpressed.

Any second now, you’re going to start laughing. Are Seamus and Dean hiding somewhere? In on the joke? I s'pose Hermione’s waiting downstairs to join in?”
Looking vaguely curious but with a knowing expression beneath it, she nodded and followed Harry out of the common room through the portrait hole, down the corridor, around a corner, and into a deserted stairwell.
“I’m not moving,” Potter responded mildly, and he even had the audacity to lift his hands up beside his head in a gesture that was supposed to be suppliant, but on Potter it only managed to look chivalrous. “Malfoy, I swear I wasn't taking the piss when I ..." He broke off, looking tense. "I had no

“Have fun,” said Hermione. “Bring me back a couple sugar quills, would you?”
"How did you know it was me and not someone else?" he manages to find his voice to ask. Potter only grins maddeningly. "Did you already know when you ... before?"
“You should probably be getting to the library if that’s what you’re here for,” he says finally.
“And what?”
Theo raised his eyebrows. “You’re not telling me that’s it, then?”
That seemed to do it. A fire ignited in Harry’s eyes which hadn’t been there before.
"Yeah," Harry laughed softly. "God, so much."
Malfoy looked thoughtful, pulling his knees up to his chest and wrapping his arms around them, like he was cold.

“How was that an
No Voldemort, he liked to remind himself sometimes.
"Would you really be upset if he's a Gryffindor?"
Which was all well and good, except that seeing Goyle doing homework and studying and hanging around Hermione in the library seemed to have shaken the foundation of fear he'd spent so long instilling in the students of Hogwarts, who were becoming less and less wary of harassing Draco even when he was around. It was nothing physical (not since the Cruciatus incident), but Harry could see it in Draco's eyes and body language that the constant reminder of Azkaban, of his parents, of the Dark Mark and Voldemort and the war — it was still getting to him.
Nine minutes, the door opens. Harry turns around and sees Draco in his pyjamas, peering sleepily down at him in the dim light of a lantern next to the door. In spite of everything, Harry smiles.
Malfoy glared at him and Harry smiled. "And you're very

Throwing his robes off and letting them fall to the floor in a fit of anger and humiliation, Draco went inside one of the stalls and looked down to see that blood had stained the apex of his slacks, expensive ones from Pansy’s mother.

Last night, after sending Pansy away, Draco had sobbed into his pillows until his eyes were raw. Yet it seemed he hadn’t run out of tears; as he burst through the oak front doors and into the chilly autumn morning, Draco felt hot rivulets streaming down his cheeks. With only his school robes to keep him warm in this unfamiliar body — so much smaller now than it had been less than a month ago — Draco began shivering after only a few minutes out in the cold. He stopped beneath a beech tree beside the lake and conjured a bluebell flame that staved off the worst of the physical cold, at least. It didn’t seem to cure his shivering, though.
“I hadn’t even thought of that,” Harry admitted. “That’s a right pain in the arse, it sounds like.”
over them?”
After another few seconds of panting breaths and heaving chests and the rain beating the window, Harry starts laughing.
you want to do right now, then?”
In spite of himself, this statement wrenched a noise out of Draco that was half-sob and half-laugh. He planted both hands on either side of Harry’s face and pulled him into another kiss; then, with his eyebrows drawn and his heart somewhere near his throat, he pushed back Harry’s fringe and drank in the sight of a face that had been famous since he’d re-entered the Wizarding world at eleven years old, but which Draco was only recently beginning to see clearly for the first time.
"Are you close?" Potter says, just a few inches from Draco's mouth. He squeezes, not
When he’s finished, Dean removes the tray and all the scattered, ground-up weed on its surface and takes the joints, lighting them both and handing one off to Seamus so the rounds can begin again. Harry wonders vaguely how long it would take for the whole room to fill with smoke and eventually suffocate them.
dreaming, but he decided he didn’t care anymore, not even that it was Malfoy. He’d never been touched like this, not even by Ginny; in fact, he couldn’t even remember the last time he’d gotten himself off. Not since they’d left Grimmauld place, that was all he knew.
are you still talking, Weasley? Why did you bother pulling that Neanderthal off of me —?”
Despite the fact that, no, Draco did
“Fancy running into you back here,” Potter said into his ear. Draco shivered. The hands on his waist disappeared and a moment later Potter had lifted the Cloak and pulled Draco underneath as well. Their ankles were surely showing, but hidden as they were behind the shelves, it seemed safe enough. “Hello,” he grinned brightly, and pulled Draco by the neck into a heart-stopping kiss that he melted into. "You smell wonderful."
“God, you’re so dumb,” Draco muttered, and started fumbling with his trousers.
Yet he was disappointed, too. The truth of the matter which Harry had come to realise was that he’d really enjoyed talking to Malfoy. This was an absurd notion, something that would have been laughable even just a week ago, but it remained a fact Harry couldn’t hide from himself. And while initially he’d done it purely (or what had
The fingers are gone from his arse and Potter backs him up to the nearest bed, which is decidedly
"You have to relax," he whispered. Malfoy took in an unsteady breath and let it back out, eyes fixed on Harry's. He felt his muscles loosen, and Harry pressed the very tip of his middle finger inside. Malfoy's eyes closed and his head fell back against the wall. His cheek was so close to the window that Harry could see the heat of it fog up the glass, along with his quietly panting breaths. He gently eased it the rest of the way in, watching Malfoy's face, and stopping only when his knuckles were pressed against his arse. He slid his other hand under Malfoy's leg and lifted it onto his shoulder, giving him a better angle and making Malfoy blush.
"I mean, it
“Harry,” Draco said, stubbing out his cigarette. “D’you know how much Ron weighs?”
One of England’s Chasers, Nerissa Murray, hosted a celebration at the enormous flat she shared with her girlfriend, and it was here that Harry was finally able to get Malfoy alone.

“You’re behind the times then, Weasley,” Draco sneered. “Whatever may have been ‘
“Well,” said Draco, lowering his gaze to his glass of wine and watching it flirt dangerously with the lip as he swirled it. His cheeks felt warm, but he wasn’t embarrassed. “We snuck around.”
"It doesn't matter," he says at last. "He's got a girlfriend now."
“Yeah, well … I figure, you know, you’ve never got to touch one before, have you? Seeing as I always beat you to it in school.”
And that wasn’t even the worst of it. No, the part that left Draco feeling chilled right down to his bones was what he’d said just before Potter had done it. The reason he’d been trying to leave in the first place.
, then? You told him you were pregnant and he just … he
he looked, not far off from the way Harry had seen him after he'd been hit by the Cruciatus Curse. As if right now he wasn't even bothering to put up any sort of façade of normalcy. It hurt Harry's heart to see it, but at the same time it made him feel impossibly happy to know that Malfoy was beginning to trust him enough to let his guard down a little bit.
“Is it true, what my father said?” Draco asked hesitantly. “The Dark Lord … did you see him down here?”
Harry sleeps now. Deeply. His body has finally learned it doesn’t need to be on high alert anymore, and his mind is healing, little by little, letting him find peace for perhaps the first time in his life. On one or two occasions, Draco swears he’s heard Harry laughing in his sleep.
“Do you want my fingers?” Harry asked against the skin of his neck.
And frankly, he was still far from ready to take a closer look at the things he was feeling for and about Harry Potter these days.
did I just say, Potter?” Malfoy cut him off, arms crossing over his chest like he was trying to fold in on himself, and it was so uncharacteristic that Harry felt a pang of deep pity make his chest feel momentarily hollow. And, somehow, coexisting with this pity was a frustration that made him clench his teeth.
Now, seeing Potter up in the air, completely unaware he was being watched, Draco realized something was happening again. Potter had always looked at home on a broomstick, yet there was something enticing about the way his new muscles looked as they shifted beneath the skin every time he moved. Something about the way his stupid, messy hair looked when it was blown back by the wind.
“An honour it is finally to speak to young Master Malfoy!” said Kreacher earnestly, creeping closer to the bed with a distinctly servile look in its round eyes. “Master is looking much healthier than last time Kreacher is seeing him!”
“Deal.”
Without preamble, Draco stood up from the Slytherin table, overcome with a single-minded intent to send the nastiest hex he could think of in Potter’s direction. Potter must have seen the look in his eyes, because he stood from the Gryffindor table as Draco started towards him. Before he could get halfway, however, a commotion had started, a few professors coming down from the head table as though anything that had to do with Potter and Malfoy was automatically deemed an immediate threat to the students’ safety. Draco stared at him another moment, jaw clenching, wanting nothing more than to go over there and beat Potter’s face to a bloody pulp, before turning and leaving the Great Hall.
Most of him, however, didn’t think he could bear it.
“Harry!”
to himself.
Earlier, after winning the final match which would take England to the Cup, he’d rowed with Janae. Not rowed, really — Janae isn’t a fighter. Her emotional intelligence is on par with Hermione, so much so that Harry suspects the two of them will stay friends after all this. He’d told her with aching sincerity that his heart wasn’t in it, and she’d said “I know” and “You need to talk to him,” and then she’d told him her heart was broken and she hoped he’d figure his shit out before he did it to someone else, and she’d made it worse by hugging him before she left.
In Potions class, during the initial chaos when Slughorn gives them their assignment and everyone bustles about getting ingredients and setting up their stations, Draco tampers with Potter’s materials. Just a small, completely harmless jinx on his pestle, something that’ll make his hand swell up when he touches it.
"It helps, though, doesn't it?" Harry asked softly. "I still don't know what I'm doing."
"What do you want?"
“You think that’s funny, do you, Malfoy?” And then Potter was standing up, and Draco felt panic begin clawing at his brain. Without giving himself time to overthink it, he got up from the bench as well and grabbed the sleeve of Potter’s jumper. Potter turned, but where Draco had gotten so used to seeing an annoyingly charming grin was now a cold, unamused line.

Draco looked from the scars on Potter’s hand to the scar on his forehead, and then thought about the faint ones leftover on his own abdomen, courtesy of Golden Boy.
“Well, that’s why I wanna take you on a date, isn’t it?” Harry pointed out, eyebrows raised. “To get to know you better?”

“You can’t be serious,” he said when Potter pulled off the Cloak and walked inside, Draco following behind, baffled. “The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is in

Malfoy continued looking at him, a slight frown-line appearing on his forehead as his eyebrows dipped.
here still. Is Potter in there? He’s needed; Adrian said he saw him here last.”
“I deserve that,” Harry allows, grinning suddenly, but when he tries to go back in for another kiss Draco stops him with another hand on his chest.
“Aye, m’lady,” he nodded loosely, toothy grin the very essence of everything Harry had ever come to enjoy about his Irish roommate. “Just a wee bit. Only way to celebrate, ain’t it? What d’you say, Potter?”
“I saw you with your shirt off before,” he said, brows dipping. “That last time we were in here. I didn’t see anything.”
"Maybe next year all of you can dress up as students and hop on the Hogwarts Express," Blaise suggested, which made Draco laugh. "Potter, you're playing your first professional Quidditch match next weekend and you'd really prefer to be at
“Harry,” he said weakly, knees buckling. “Please …”
“It felt nice,” Harry says, and doesn’t have to clarify, because Draco knows he’s talking about his scar. His face has gone soft, like he’s already figured out what Draco’s thinking. Perhaps he has, at that. “I don’t usually like when people touch it.”
A few more tests were performed before Draco was allowed to change into his clothes, old ones he'd gotten from the manor when they'd visited last week. The trouser legs were a little too long and the sleeves as well, but he rolled those up and was too delighted by the way they fit otherwise to be bummed about the height difference. Truthfully he found he didn't much mind that part.

It was eleven o’clock, and as planned, Hermione had a book open in front of her. What

"Will you shut up?" says Harry. He's grinning, over-bright.
Harry pumped into him slowly, letting him feel every inch, bottoming out and pulling back and pressing in deeply again. He kept this pace as long as he could, jerking Draco's body with each thrust, until the need to come began to consume him.
And Harry did, but even when he returned to Gryffindor Tower to find Ron and Ginny still awake and sitting around the fire — even when he joined them, reveling in the comfort and familiarity the company and the atmosphere afforded — he never
“I’ll take that as a compliment, shall I?” Potter said cheekily; Draco took great relish in wiping that smirk off his face when he reached forward to cup that tantalisingly obvious bulge in one hand, earning a groan for his efforts. Potter didn’t stop him when he unzipped the denims and pulled his cock out, wasting very little time gathering up enough pre-come to make his hand glide smoothly along the shaft, another prickle of heat stirring in Draco’s belly when he felt the way it was throbbing. “
His blood feels cold. And his hands.
"I'm staying with my aunt," he said finally. "That's where I was that week between leaving Azkaban and coming here. She's letting me come back until I figure something out or until my mum gets out."
They’d been out here at least half an hour, since they’d finished their last NEWT, saying nothing and enjoying the feeling of being free — no more exams, no more homework, no more classes. Not just for the year, but forever. At Hogwarts, at least.

Draco tamped down on a smile, because that would have been more emotion than he cared to show at the moment. To Pansy
“It’s a good one,” Harry agreed. His hot breath caressed the back of Draco’s neck, fingers pumping, his other hand back at Draco’s waist. “I have a million more I’d love to show you.”
"Fuck you," he says. His voice is wobbly. "You're just as bad, doing it when you knew it was me."
“Well that’s only part of it,” says Draco. He lets go of Harry’s cock, curved up against his stomach, thick and heavy with blood, and crawls up his body to press a series of kitten-soft kisses onto his neck. Harry closes his eyes again and breathes through his nose. There’s an instinct to resist that’s kicking in which he’s desperately fighting. He wants to know what the fuck is going on first before he decides to shut this down. Draco’s lips drag maddeningly up to his ear. “The other part is reminding you what you’re gonna spend the rest of your life missing if I ever catch you fucking around on me, Potter.”
“By being completely brilliant and completely mental,” Harry said around a mouthful of food.
“Passion,” Harry echoed, eyes finally leaving Hermione’s face as he contemplated everything she had said. “You think — er — that’s all it is, then? You don’t think it’s … I mean, what you’re saying is that whatever it is I’m feeling, it’ll blow over eventually. Heat of the moment type of thing.”
Draco licked his lips, staying silent. Potter turned his head on the pillow and their eyes met.
Harry hates how bitter he sounds when he says, “He’s an idiot.”
Harry laughed against his mouth. “It’s terrible manners to cuss at somebody who’s just given you an orgasm.”
Leaving the bra off but putting his shirt back on, Draco slipped into the steaming tub fully clothed and let himself cry until his eyes were red, puffy, and sore, and he could sneak back into his dorm room in the dead of night without being accosted by any of the friends he'd insisted to Potter he'd have rather spoken to than him.
, he promises the moon, the sky, the stars, himself, nobody at all. Some god,
"You realise," said Draco slowly, "that living together is hugely different than sharing a common room."
Harry looked back at him with a surge of irritation that died again immediately when he saw that Malfoy was grinning. He hadn't seen him do
Draco shook his head. “No,” he said firmly, although this was not the simple truth. The truth was that he would need nine months just to consider all the angles. “I couldn’t take care of a kid. I’m …”
Heaving a deep sigh, Harry turned to face Goyle, whom he'd been expecting to show up any moment.
“Darling, let me tell you something very, very important.” She stood up from her chair and lowered herself in front of his, something that brought him immediately back to his childhood. Whenever he’d been in trouble with his father, done something seemingly harmless which had earned him a spanking or a smack across the face, his mother had always come to find him much later, when his father was locked away in his study with his mind a million miles away. Draco had almost always been sitting at his desk and scribbling away in a diary, and his mother would kneel beside his chair, and take his hands, and implore him to remember how much Mummy and Daddy loved him, even when he got in trouble.
This was very much not the case anymore.
"Are you calling me stupid?" Harry said loudly, drowning him out. The boy looked suddenly horrified. "Well? Do you think I'm an idiot?"
“Yeah. Soon, I hope.”
to be upset. But unless you're harbouring a secret crush on him, there's no reason for you to have utterly ostracised me other than hating something you don't understand."
The tiny owl hooted excitably as he removed its burden, and then it took flight once again.
Narcissa," Harry corrected him with a roll of his eyes. "I said she seems to have changed just the same as Draco has and it's made me really hopeful."
"He's fine, Hermione," said Ron, rolling his eyes. There were smudges of ink on his face still where he hadn't managed to wipe all of it off. "Not like he didn't go around bullying people for six years. Besides, nobody tries anything when Harry's around, Goyle or no Goyle. You've noticed it too."
something to me! And if you were a halfway decent friend, you’d give me a chance to explain —!”
"He's a reserve Seeker, Harry."
Draco had no idea what that was supposed to mean, but a moment later he was distracted anyhow when he noticed its ethereal wings shimmering with the barest shadow of colour when the sun hit it perfectly. Green and blue and purple.
“But what?” she cut him off sharply. “Draco,
“Finding it isn’t the problem,” Potter snapped, and his hands finally fell from Draco’s waist. Draco thrilled to know that he could still manipulate him so easily. “The problem is that I’m not sure it’s a good idea. And I don’t even know if I can speak Parseltongue anymore, anyhow.”
Penbroke studied his face carefully before she spoke: “It’s good news, Draco. But there’s been an unexpected complication we’ve discovered that … changes the situation.”
"You're sleeping with him then?" asked Ron.
"Me too," Harry sighed. "We'll figure out something better than a bathroom, anyway. Nice as this one is."
The cemetery was much prettier now than it had been the first time Harry had seen it with Hermione. He thought this, too, had something to do with the much-more-relaxed atmosphere, although he was also fairly certain it had something to do with Draco’s presence.
“I dunno, honestly.” Weasley shrugged and scratched absent-mindedly at a long scar on his arm. “What I do know is that Harry’s never had parents, or a real family. I mean, he’s part of
So he stopped trying and decided to wander the castle until his mind gave in and let him rest.

“We should go.” Draco bent and picked up the broom from the stone floor, feeling the weight of it, the texture of it, before handing it to Potter. “I … thank you for bringing me down here. It's ... my house's history."
"Why wouldn’t I want to come?" he asks tonelessly, not looking at her. He lifts his drink to his lips and sighs when he realises it’s empty.
, or something?”
, something that silently calls him a moron but affectionately, and after the door closes and Harry leaps down the stairs like a teenager with too much energy, he glances at his wrist and grins curiously at the watch face that tells him it’s 1:24am.
“I know who he is," he said tightly. "And I wouldn’t have abandoned you."
Draco sighed. He rested his head on Harry's shoulder and Harry put an arm around him.
Draco let out a weak, shaky laugh. His prick throbbed, hovering just above the desk.
“You have the self-preservation instincts of an enraged Erumpent, Potter. You’re not cunning, you’re powerful. There’s a significant difference. You’re able to blunder your way
the war, Hermione.”
"Yeah, but Greg is ..." But Draco didn't finish his thought, frowning a little. "Well ... if she can help him pass his NEWTs it'll be a bloody miracle."
“How did it go?” he asked breathlessly, green eyes wide with concern. Draco had tried to plan out what he would say a hundred different times in a thousand different ways, but in the end, he wound up flinging all that preparation aside and throwing himself at Harry, arms winding tightly around his neck. Harry stumbled backwards but caught him with a huffed-out laugh, lifting Draco right off his feet for a moment. “I’ll take that to mean it went well, then, did it?”

He didn't move out when he had the money — it never even came up.
“That’s the plan,” he said, lifting a hand to rub at the back of his neck. “Is it … you know, is it too much?”
"You were losing
"Malfoy," he said, stopping him just as he was leaving the classroom. Malfoy turned and eyed Harry with only the faintest dimple of confusion (or perhaps that was suspicion) marring his brow. He was otherwise impassive. Ron and Hermione paused a few feet away. "I'd really like to talk to you."
"Fuck off, Potter!" Goyle repeated sharply. Harry closed his mouth reluctantly, more stunned than anything. "He doesn't wanna talk to you! Get it through your head!" And, when Harry still didn't move, "
Tentatively, he tried cupping one of his breasts with a trembling hand, but as soon as he felt the softness of it, the
She pulled him to his feet and wiped away his tears, and it relieved him to see a small but warm smile on her ruby-red lips.
When they walked into the Great Hall at just past seven, the ball was already in full swing. Tables littered the perimeter while the very middle was being used as a dance floor. At the far end, a large, marble half-wall had been erected, and on it were hundreds of names — everyone, apparently, who had given their lives in the fight against the Dark Lord. Floating above it, surrounded by hovering candles, was a picture of a red-headed woman and a man beside her who looked startlingly like Potter. They were dancing in their little frame, taking part in the festivities in their own way, Draco supposed. He had grown up knowing James and Lily Potter’s names, yet he realized now he’d never actually seen a decent picture of them.
“Including yourself?” Harry cut him off loudly. Still holding Draco’s hand tightly within his much larger one, he stepped forward and lifted his wand so it was pointing directly at Theo’s chest. “What did you think was gonna happen, Nott?” he said contemptuously. “You thought you’d blackmail me into saving your father? Thought you might get a fuck out of it as well if you played your cards right with Draco? You’re pathetic. Get out of my fucking sight before I decide to let McGonagall know what you’ve been up to and get you expelled. And for the record, I’d have expected a Slytherin to be better at blackmail. This was just embarrassing.”
"Happy?" he says.
, ‘Mione. That Slytherin the other day, he really turned him into a

say first.”
"A break wouldn't be the worst thing in the world," Draco admitted, lifting his arms above his head and yawning on cue. "He's bloody exhausting."
He was up and out of his chair before she’d finished the last word, absurdly,
"When I was fucking her, you mean?" he says after a moment. Draco's pulse leaps and he's sure Harry can hear him breathing a little harder. It always takes him by surprise when Harry says things like that, and he imagines it always will. He nods, mostly because he can't find his voice suddenly. "Yeah, I did."
“I … I don’t know how long it’ll take … you can’t miss a lesson just because —”
The cigarette finds his lips again, gaze never moving. It sizzles loudly in the dark when he takes a deep drag.
For her part, Ginny seemed to sense something was off. She curled into him tentatively afterwards with a leg twisted in between his own, and although he felt none of the old passion, none of that raw emotion, he didn’t refuse her the intimacy. She propped herself up with an elbow in order to meet his eyes, despondence having replaced the radiant glow from Quidditch tryouts earlier.
"I mean ... aren't we?"
“I think you’re too charming to be the real Harry Potter.”
“I had to,” Potter shrugged. “Voldemort had possessed Ginny and taken her down there. I wasn’t going to let her die.”
He knew why he’d come here. It was just that, now that he
“You called me ‘the Chosen Captain’,” Harry said, laughter bubbling beneath the words. “And ‘the Boy Who Scored’. I was furious at the time because I was desperate to know what you were up to, but later on I kept laughing when I thought about it. That wasn’t the only time that happened, either. I
“So … what? You’re telling me your father and his mates
Harry’s stomach drops.
“No,” he said sharply. “Stay.” He turned to Pansy finally. “
“This— er — has to do with what you said last week. Doesn’t it?”
“I kissed him,” he nodded, and although he felt his cheeks blooming with heat, he didn’t let himself look away. He might have been nervous about Hermione’s reaction to this, but he was
~1100
Draco pursed his lips around a grin. “My god, Potter … you eat like you’ve been
"Oi, where the hell's my party?" Harry called, descending into the kitchen with a grin planted on his face and an enormous sweat stain on the front of his shirt. He'd just come from practice, where they'd clearly worked him hard. According to him, Hogwarts had not quite prepared him for professional Quidditch conditioning.
"Good luck with the gift-shopping."
“Get off me!” he shouted, and even he could hear the way his voice had risen to a hysterical pitch, the fear impossible to miss. This seemed to please the boy, and his hands only tightened on Draco’s wrists further, wrenching out of him another sob of stinging agony. “You’re hurting me, let go!”
Granger showed up first.
, he thought —
She looked like it was the last thing she’d been expecting.
"Greg," said Draco, blinking at him. "Is everything all right?"
Harry did not smile. “Draco, you don’t have to do this. You’re of age, you
with his lips stretched around Harry’s cock,
“I think so,” Malfoy said, eyes slowly opening, and Harry didn’t miss the blush on his cheeks. He wanted more than anything to know what he’d chosen, but decided now wasn’t the time to ask. “It’s not as much happy as it is … intense. In a good way, though. Will that work, do you think?”
“Why don’t you wanna fly?” he asked finally, bluntly. Draco felt his cheeks burn and hated that it was a clear giveaway.
“Draco, you’re building up a very distorted image of me right now,” Harry said softly, and there was even what seemed to be a note of sardonic humour underneath the words. One hand had begun rubbing soothing circles into Draco’s back. “I’m not the only one who bad stuff has ever happened to … I’m just the only one who’s had it all thrust into the spotlight for public scrutiny.”
“Is that why you’ve been blushing around me all day?” Harry smirked.
Malfoy glared at him. “
“You’re a fucking deviant,” Draco informs him. Harry laughs against his neck and tightens his grip, wandlessly adding lube to the equation and making his strokes longer, teasing him and drawing him helplessly towards the edge. He mouths wetly along the skin above and below the velvet, then noses it out of the way and presses his tongue to the warm skin. He tugs at the back again, more tightly this time, and that finally does it. Draco whimpers and then gasps and then comes all over Harry’s hand. Harry works him through it, moving his lips lazily along Draco’s flushed throat, ignoring his own aching arousal.
“No.” Draco shook his head, and after a moment’s hesitation he leaned forward to press their lips together, allowing himself the comfort it afforded him. Harry seemed to understand this, because he opened his mouth and deepened the kiss, letting his hands fall to Draco’s waist and gripping tightly.
the worst thing in the world happened, if she couldn't handle this and she left," he said, looking intently into Draco's eyes, "I would still love you and I would still love this baby and you will always,
“What
“Does he?” Malfoy sounded surprised. “Why?”
In the body of a woman or not, Draco Malfoy was not
“He got the color of his eyes from his mum,” Draco noted, nodding towards the picture, and when Granger gave him a knowing grin, he rolled his eyes. “Everyone knows Potter’s eyes are green, Granger. Don’t look too far into it.”
you do, Malfoy,” he said goadingly, leaning forward once more to place a very deliberate kiss to the corner of Draco’s mouth. As usual, Draco had to hide the way his insides melted. “Maybe if you beg me a little bit I’ll talk to you some more —”
“Tell you what,” Harry grinned mischievously, ducking his head to pepper kisses along Malfoy’s jaw right up to his ear. “I’ll find a time to pull you aside tomorrow between lessons.”
Potter shrugged. “Haven’t the foggiest. Fred and George nicked it from Filch’s office their first year. Gave it to me our third year so I could sneak into Hogsmeade since my uncle never signed my permission slip. See?” Potter pointed out several different places on the Map which appeared to denote passageways in and out of Hogwarts that Draco had never even heard of before. Many of which Potter had surely used in order to do most of his rule-breaking. “Anyway, it tells you where everyone is, too. That’s how I’ve been finding you.”
Ron choked on his firewhiskey and Goyle sprayed some of his all over Crookshanks, who was in his lap. The latter leapt down, looking highly affronted.
Knowing it would have something to do with Malfoy but not
So Draco let his eyes slip closed and took in a deep, steadying breath as Harry started mouthing his way down Draco’s torso. His mouth was hot and wet and his teeth were sharp where he nipped and licked teasingly around sensitive nipples, leaving them feeling tight and hard when he moved on, lips skimming across quivering muscle down to the line of Draco’s knickers, where without hesitation Harry boldly pressed his searing-hot tongue against Draco’s cunt through the fabric. Draco keened and arched and fisted the sheets beneath him, and all the while Harry mouthed at him shamelessly, dampening the material further and driving Draco to the very brink of madness in his need for more.
“I’ve moved on, Ron,” Harry said, his voice a strained calm as he tried very hard to reign his emotions back in. “The war is over. I don’t have the energy to hate
“I appreciate the help,” he indicated the pads and the vial of potion. “If you don’t mind my asking, Granger … why are you okay with this?”
“I’m just curious, is all.
“Potter!” he sobbed out when Harry squeezed in a third finger and only sped his pace up further. “I’m serious, if you don’t stop I’m gonna —”
His teeth clenched and he had to make a conscious effort to stop picking at his nails. "Whatever, it’s a useless analogy anyway considering
He shrugged and finally looked up.
"Come now, Draco, you sound like a child when you say that," Pratchett laughs. Draco tenses, knowing it's proving the point to feel irritated but he can't help it.
Below the chair are Draco’s oxfords where he’d slipped them off before lifting his legs. They’re brand new and spotlessly clean, and maybe they’re just shoes but they’re a testament to Draco’s personality and for that Harry likes them.
He turns, blinking, to see Hermione holding the joint towards him and shaking it. The ash falls off and lands on the carpet.
"Don't you think maybe you've been brooding long enough?" she asks. "I mean,
clothes off too," Draco bit out, Harry's hand wrapped around him now, moving slowly and using his pre-come to ease the slide.
“You think sharing
"It really and truly is," Harry said, dropping a hand to Draco's knee and squeezing. "I know a lot of things between us feel really confusing sometimes but there's nothing at all complicated about how much I like you."
for the best, but I have a feeling you've exaggerated it a bit in your head, hm?"
“Don’t go spreading it around, though, Potter. It’s very confidential.”
“Are you going to regret it tomorrow morning?”
, and the fact of the matter was that Harry’s reaction would affect him a great deal.
Potter sighed through his nose. “It isn’t, Malfoy. But clearly I can’t make you believe me, and that’s fine. I just wanted you to know that I do forgive you, and I
“Let’s go behind a shelf —” he started to say, only for his voice to abandon him when two thumbs pulled his pussy open and that wet muscle pushed slickly inside his quivering hole. One of Draco’s hands clenched in the piece of parchment on which he’d been writing his essay, ruining it, the other darting beneath the table to grab Harry’s hair on a reflex. “Please!” he whispered frantically, tugging, trying only half-heartedly to pull Harry away from his cunt, now dripping fluid. “Harry, s-
between his thighs, it wasn’t scary or uncomfortable. For one thing, he knew with a gut-deep certainty that Potter, whatever his faults, was about as likely to touch Draco against his will as he was to announce himself the new Dark Lord. For another, despite the intimidating newness of the situation that was still utterly present, he was very much aware of the part of himself which was painfully aroused by Potter’s drunken forwardness, the way he seemed to completely disregard any semblance of propriety or decorum in his palpable lust for contact. The kiss was short but left him panting like they’d been snogging for hours, something which Potter seemed to pick up on, and it put a smug grin on his stupid, handsome face.
to watch Potter get what’s been coming to him.
The grass is wet from a week of constant rain; it soaks through Draco’s trousers to his knees, into his skin, cool and damp. The air is warm but a chilly breeze is blowing, bringing with it the dark, dank, earthy smell of the forest. It rustles his hair and reminds him of his mother and father, and he allows himself to cry. Not harsh sobs anymore but silent tears that roll down his cold cheeks and drip off his chin.
Draco turned over and pulled the covers further up his body, burrowing his face into them and heaving a deep, world-weary sigh. As if things hadn’t been complicated enough before. Leave it to Potter to take an impossible situation and turn it completely on its head.
prickled at his eyes and Draco didn’t bother wiping them away.
pleased," Draco said, grinning. "I get it from her."
Potter stares at him for a few moments, considering. Finally he says, "I have no idea." There's a pause. "It's never been like that with Daphne. Or anyone."
"Don't stop!" he gasped, fucking himself back on Harry's cock, "don't stop, don't stop!"
by stopping the Dementor's Kiss, but you know as well as I do he'll have lost his mind in six months' time anyway! That's the only reason you did it! But you don’t
"It'll be Ron or Hermione, I bet," says Harry, jumping lightly down from the sill. "They'll have figured out where I fucked off to by now."
It was seven o’clock, the sun only beginning to set in the west, when Harry joined him.
Draco frowned deeply, despising absolutely everything about that sentence. He felt colour blooming tellingly on his cheeks, and Weasley looked far too smug to have missed it.
After all,
the game, y’know?” he said, looking over at Draco with eyes that shined with an inebriated enthusiasm. Draco tried very hard not to pay attention to the way his heart seemed to expand right there in his chest at the sight, but found it difficult to ignore. Almost as difficult as it was to ignore his burgeoning awareness of the depth of his feelings for the Gryffindor prat. “But it’s got nothing on catching the Snitch, does it?” His smile became even brighter, as though Draco was the only person in the entire world who might be able to understand his love of Seeking.
He kept moving sluggishly even when Draco had dropped down onto the desk, stomach muscles twitching feebly. The movements slowed gradually and finally stopped, buried halfway. His face and neck gleamed with sweat. Draco glanced at the door, cheeks heating when he thought about how anyone could have walked in during that. How anyone could
“Potter!” McGonagall exclaimed. She seemed to have been poring over a roll of parchment which trailed at least ten feet onto the floor and away from the desk. “Have a seat. How can I help you?”
“No, I suppose you wouldn’t,” Theo said. When he met Draco’s eyes again, he saw that some of the conflict had gone from Theo’s face. “D’you think we could we talk?”
He'd paused only long enough to tear off both their robes before sinking to the floor on his knees and fumbling with Harry's trousers.
"Erm ... in some ways it was, yeah." He frowned, caught off guard by the question. And not only by the question but the person asking it. He glanced out the window again where he could see the edge of the Forbidden Forest — where he had died last year — and his stomach contracted. "But it's been my home since I was eleven. Nothing could change that." Malfoy was staring down at his hands in his lap. "What about you?"
Find me at
"Yes," he said softly. "And that's not all. They've found a cure, but I can't take it while I'm pregnant."
“Why were you crying?” he whispered. In all honesty, he wasn’t sure he expected Potter to answer, but a moment later he was holding out a wrinkled photograph of whom Draco knew to be Potter’s parents, as well as a very young Remus Lupin and Sirius Black, all smiling and waving up at him.
, specifically, Harry nodded tentatively.
“All right. Just keep in mind, Draco, that while he’s still himself, he
say that would help — these people, the ones who cornered him, who looked at him with that manic, ferocious glee, they didn’t
With tears drying on his cheeks, Draco marveled at the situation he was currently in. Pansy, probably feeling vindicated right now, had chosen to let him deal with this on his own as a retaliation for the way he’d spoken to her. Meanwhile, Draco had spelled away the blood, but it would certainly come back, and a handful of toilet paper wasn’t going to do much. And now here was Granger, Hermione bloody Granger, whom Draco had called any number of insulting names in the past, offering help.
When he walked into the Great Hall, the owls were just pouring in through the windows. His mother’s owl dropped an envelope identical to the one he’d gotten a few days ago beside his tea as soon as he’d poured it, and Draco stared at it with trepidation.
“I’m going to tell you why I left.” Harry’s voice was saturated with candor, the look on his face so open, so vulnerable, Draco nearly had to turn away. He had the air of a man baring his soul.
“Yeah.”
“I’m gonna fuck you about a million times later tonight, don’t worry about me.”
“I came to apologise,” said Draco.
With that, his grey eyes disappeared behind his lids, and Harry felt his heart must surely burst right out of his chest when Malfoy tucked his head under Harry’s chin, let out a deep, satisfied-sounding breath, and went to sleep.
Harry and Ron groaned simultaneously, and at least for the moment the subject of Malfoy and his new body stayed on the back-burner of Harry’s mind.
"Yeah, that's right. Well ... probably one of the mouldy beds at Grimmauld Place, actually, I doubt we'll find a good place by tomorrow night. But yeah." He turned his head and kissed Draco soundly. "Definitely together, wherever we end up being."
“Then you know how much he weighs in Chocolate Frogs,” he said, taking Harry’s cigarette and putting that out too. Harry looked at him, confused, as Draco took his hand, feeling very resigned, and began leading Harry towards the bathrooms.
Malfoy laughed. “Feel good, Potter?”
And though he intended to sleep in his dormitory with his Gryffindor dorm mates that night for the last time, he still pulled Draco away to the Room of Requirement for an hour, where the fucking felt more like lovemaking and every kiss reverberated in his soul.
He lost his temper anyway.
"What if we lived together?" he finally forced out, cheeks burning. "I was already planning on getting a flat in London after we graduate and ... and I dunno, I just think it would be really good if we could see how that works, y'know?"
And besides, didn’t it mean something that Malfoy had caught himself mid-sentence and broken off? Didn’t it count that he’d looked embarrassed, like he’d known what it sounded like?
So Harry stopped trying to talk to him, and hardly more than a minute or two later he saw the group of Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors finally leave, a few of them with sour looks on their faces.
“Tell me what you want, Draco,” Harry said into his ear. His voice was pitched low and tweaked a chord of deep arousal within Draco. “What do you need?”
, knowing that’s exactly what he would have done in the same situation.
“Your ostentatious displays of wandless magic are wholly unnecessary, Potter,” he grumbled, not entirely sure whether it annoyed him more that Potter was capable of such astounding magical feats, or that he, Draco, was so unbearably turned on by them.
, Potter," Malfoy said stiffly. His Adam's apple bobbed. "So I just ... I —"

"Weird."
"What? No, I just said he should quit threatening people. Is that ... were you alone because of
you?” She looked flabbergasted. Draco didn’t blame her. “What in Merlin’s name could he have done?”
"Yes."
Potter lifted an eyebrow and he felt the heat creep down his neck.
"W-where did you learn that?" Draco stuttered out, nails digging into Harry's shoulder as he felt one finger probing gently at him but never actually breaching. Harry's eyes were as bright as he'd ever seen them, and they kept moving back and forth between Draco's face and his arse.
“Draco,” came Harry’s soft voice from behind him, but Draco only had eyes for his father, who was now being handed over to the Dementors outside the room. His eyes were dark, and whatever fight seemed to have been left drained promptly away as soon as the Dementors converged on him.
“And according to Trelawney in that lesson you missed, you’re also a Leo, which means you're rubbish at communication.”
Malfoy himself was pressed closely to the wall, but other than that he showed no sign of having noticed what had happened. Harry wondered vaguely if he was simply becoming used to it by now.
Harry didn’t answer the question. Instead, he said: “Where?” Malfoy’s pupils grew. The flush on his cheeks darkened. Harry was visited by a desire to feel whether it made Malfoy’s cold, marble-like skin warm. As Malfoy looked behind them, Harry pulled his boxers back up over his erection.
A fond look came over Hermione’s face. She reached over again, setting her hand on top of his.
– and with a crooked grin grabbed whatever the hell he had come in here for in the first place and left.
Harry merely laughed and tore the gift-wrapping off, then opened the lid. His eyebrows drew together for a moment and when he lifted the tiny red shirt out and saw the word
, he thought but didn’t say. “I don’t know how.”
He was a floor down when a deep voice shouting his name stopped him in his tracks and turned his blood cold. One look showed him a boy only a little bit smaller than Kenny Helstrom, wearing Hufflepuff colors. Everything Draco had ever thought about what he felt to be Hogwarts's most notoriously
"You did the best you could, Harry, I'm really proud of you," Hermione assured him. "That's all anybody can do if neither of them will listen."
"I think you're perfect," Harry said. Draco had to close his eyes a second and allow that to sink in. "I think you're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen."
“Wow,” she breathed. “What’s it like?”
At some point, anyway. For now this was still fine.
, I don’t really have time for your endlessly wandering hands at the moment.”
He goes to the supply shelf and takes down a vial of murtlap essence, dabbing his burnt hand with it.
Potter. It was an instinctively disturbing thought, until he reminded himself, over and over again, where this surge of lust was coming from. Namely, the fact that the one orgasm Draco had experienced within the last three months had been Potter’s doing, and that had been close to three weeks ago. Furthermore, Potter was always
“On?”
“Did you just do
"How was that?" he asks softly, a little teasing. Draco kisses him one last time and pulls away, forcing his sluggish brain to remember who he's supposed to be.
guy isn’t, though.” He nodded down the table where Kenny Helstrom had taken a seat among his friends and begun to wolf down food. “Not surprised it looks like someone hit him in the face. That bruise was brutal earlier in the week, did you notice? Love to know who did it, I’d send them a gift.”
"Yeah." After a second's hesitation Draco leans down to kiss him one last time, unable to help himself. His stomach is already twisting into knots as reality begins setting in: he can never do this again. Once was risky enough, and there are about a million complications that could still arise. Potter kisses him back and he's grinning when Draco pulls away.
Goyle glared at him one more time before storming off.
“You don’t need to apologise,” Potter said. His eyes were a bit red-rimmed, he looked utterly exhausted, but that vitality that Draco associated with Potter’s presence was warm and strong and making his blood sing in his veins.
"He's sort of sweet like this, isn't he?" said Daphne, grinning at the way Draco had his face buried in Harry's neck at the moment.
"Oh! Potter," his mum said when they went into the office, blinking at him even as some colour appeared on her face. Something esoteric passed between them and Draco thought it looked like she was about to say something to Harry, but then her gaze shifted and her face softened when it landed on him. "My darling boy," she said, "come give Mummy a hug."
“I’m sorry too,” Draco says, pulling back a little and putting a hand on Harry’s chest. “You’re allowed to not feel like talking sometimes. It’s like you said, I just go a little mental in here, especially knowing I have another four months to go. And I do worry about you, not because I think you can’t handle any of it, I know you can, just because … I don’t know, shit happens, and I really …” Draco drops his eyes and his hand curls into Harry’s jumper. “I really couldn’t bear to lose you.”
Draco was quiet for a moment, digesting this information. Finally, he said, “They sound made-up.”
," he insisted.
see was any sign of physical bullying, but from experience knew that the emotional torment was usually much worse.
There was a feast in the Great Hall afterwards and then, much later on, a party in the eighth-year common room. An enormous amount of alcohol was involved, which meant that for the first time Harry got to see Draco completely sloshed. Nobody was being rude to him either; the Slytherins weren't necessarily
“What are you doing up here?” Harry asked, stuffing his clothes from the day into a little hamper that the house-elves would empty overnight. “Going to bed early, too?”
He hops down himself and grabs his pack of cigarettes, something that's becoming dangerously habitual. He can hear their voices as he heads to his bedroom and stops to listen, hidden by a wall.

"I couldn't get him," said Ron, dropping into a chair next to Harry and Draco in the Weasleys' kitchen.
“You look so good when you come,” Harry said, warm hands sliding obsessively up and down Draco’s sides. On his right hand, Draco could feel the wetness of his pussy on Harry’s fingers. It was shockingly arousing. “Not that you don’t always look good, but that was so fucking hot.”
“I hate you just fine,” Draco said, smiling when Potter chuckled. “I guess I just don’t understand it entirely. I think most people would enjoy the spotlight.”
“Difficult to accept!” Ron shouted, looking for all the world like he was descending slowly into lunacy. “Harry, you’re … you’ve lost your mind! You
In fact, a greater majority of people were sitting at the Gryffindor table. Seamus, Dean, and Stephen were there, along with Parvati, Lavender, and Tracey. Other people were spread out haphazard at the other tables regardless of house, as if on this the day of their graduation they had matured suddenly past the divisiveness of houses even in the Great Hall where those lines had always remained hard.
What really sent Draco into a tailspin, however, was the firm press of what was undeniably the hard outline of Potter’s cock against his leg.
“Go to hell, Zabini,” Theo bit back. He flashed Blaise two fingers and headed back to his station with Tracey. While Theo had been gone, it seemed Tracey had managed to irreversibly damage their potion, because it was now belching out thick, noxious clouds of evil-looking orange smoke.
“It was very gracious of him,” she said. “And I think I’m even beginning to understand … you two.” Harry looked completely nonplussed, but Draco merely rolled his eyes. Harry’s hair was damp and curly and beautiful and his eyes burned into Draco.
"Excuse me!" Hermione chided him, going pink. "Ron and I are going there. Just because
But before Harry could finish what he was saying, a fist flew into the side of his face, sending him reeling sideways and back onto his bed. He could taste blood in his mouth. But by the time he’d recovered from the blow, jaw singing with pain, and stood up again, the dormitory door was already closing behind Ron with a resounding slam.
“He knows that’s why you keep missing class,” Weasley said. Draco glowered, but Weasley’s face finally sobered up a bit. He shoved his hands into his jeans pockets beneath his gaping robes. “I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to
Draco knew right away this was the wrong thing to say. He hadn’t
"I'm not
And Draco
Draco stepped out from beneath the Cloak when they reached the entrance to the common room, and they had only just stepped inside when their path to his private quarters was impeded by the only person who seemed not to be at dinner.
“You weren’t what?” Harry said over him. His voice wasn’t harsh or angry but rather mocking, as if he found Draco’s pathetic attempts to explain himself amusing. He slipped a second finger inside and Draco whimpered into his desk, fingers again trying to curl pointlessly against the wood. “You weren’t gonna fuck him?”
“How’s it going tonight?” Potter asks. Draco doesn’t answer; he tries to block it out even though he already has goosebumps that aren’t from the chill in the breeze. He interlocks his fingers and prays harder.
Of course, he hadn’t
“Yeah, it is,” says Draco heatedly. “So I’m not sure why you’re choosing to be a complete prick about it suddenly.”
“I can’t fucking stand you,” Malfoy breathed when he pulled away for air, and even as he said it his fingers were twisting around the black mess of hair at the back of Harry’s head, tugging lightly. Harry chuckled and nipped at his jaw, moving his hips, dragging their pricks together wetly.
"And I also told you a million times that night, I was unhappy when we were together. I hated the fighting, I hated that ..." He trails off before he says anything too honest, something Harry can latch onto like a metaphorical foot in the door and use it to pry the rest out of him. His resolve is only strengthened when he remembers that Harry's already seeing someone new. Even if some part of him had been tempted to give in, there's no point. One thing he knows for sure is that he can't be
“That’s right. And mine.”
"Well that didn't last long," said Ron.
"D'you mind if I go have a smoke?"
One afternoon, Harry found himself for the second time with his cock down Draco's throat instead of in a lesson. He still didn't know what had happened, just that Draco had caught up to him in the corridor before he went into the Transfiguration classroom and, in a whisper, asked him to meet. So Harry had turned right back around and gone to the Room of Requirement, waiting only five minutes for Draco to show up as well.
Draco was also getting along with Ron and Hermione rather fantastically. This was very good, seeing as none of the other Slytherins would talk to Draco still. In fact, their resolution seemed to have doubled since he'd begun hanging around with Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Pansy was to be seen constantly with Padma Patil and Mandy Brocklehurst; Blaise Zabini and Theodore Nott spent a significant amount of time with Terry Boot and Wayne Hopkins of Hufflepuff; even Millicent Bulstrode had made a few friends and gave Draco a wide berth.
“How often do you talk?” she went on, squeezing his hands once before pulling hers back. “You must meet up at night, when everyone else is asleep?”
But Potter only shrugged. After everything that had happened in the last month, Draco’s emotions had reached a straining point. He felt a surge of it overwhelm him, make his blood feel like hot acid in his veins, and when he stepped towards Potter, Potter didn’t move. He looked like he didn’t quite know what to expect, but he still braced himself in time to keep from falling backwards when Draco shoved his chest. And then again, harder this time. There were tears of exhaustion leaking down Draco’s face and he pushed Potter a third time, shouting as he did so.
"Fine," Draco said, climbing off the bed and beginning to pull his clothes back on. His snippy movements told Harry he was fully back to himself. "I look forward to saying I told you so." He buttoned his flies and swept a hand through his hair, which fell quite naturally into a more-or-less respectable position. It was the absolute antithesis of Harry's. "You
"Should I?"
do that, and nor will Draco, obviously. Cowardly fucking twink.
“Finished?” Draco asked. Blaise nodded.
Granger eyed him another moment and then went back inside, shutting the door behind her. Draco only had to wait a minute before it was opening again, and this time Harry came out. The sight of him made Draco’s heart feel tender and sore.
that. Needless to say, she hadn’t appreciated his lashing out, and it had evolved into a full-blown row right in the middle of the Slytherin common room. Blaise, meanwhile, remained civil when Draco spoke to him, but showed no inclination towards spending any time together outside of necessity.
“This isn’t one of those things,” Draco said quietly. Acutely aware of how much bigger Potter’s hands now were than his own, he pulled one away from his neck and the other from where it had landed on his hip, and Potter let them fall without a fight. “And if it is, then I need more time to think about it. Not everyone is you, Potter. We can’t all jump into the deep end with both feet.”
“Right,” said Harry. He wasn’t wrong, which made him wonder why he wanted to do it so much. But then Malfoy — maybe seeing something on Harry’s face he didn’t like — tightened his hand again and started stroking, long, slow movements from base to tip, as if to distract him. “Then I wonder why you’re bothering with all this foreplay? Maybe we should just get to the fucking.”
Thankfully, the Thursday of the week before Halloween Professor Boothby had the class divided up into groups practising nonverbal magic. The spell had been chosen in the spirit of the holiday,
, hm?” Draco repeated, grinning as well. “I don’t suppose you could leave him that way as a reminder not to get in pub fights?”
Something terrible and threatening materialised in his father’s eyes, turning Draco’s blood cold.
He Apparated them directly into his living room, and they weren’t there for more than a few seconds before Malfoy pounced on him.
“We did.” Draco forced himself not to fidget. His eyes darted to the door and back. “We were going to my room when we ran into Theo.” Blood rose to the surface of his cheeks; he tried to will it away and couldn’t. “Potter was under the Cloak,” he held it up limply in his hand, “Theo stopped me in the common room and asked whether Potter and I have been sleeping together.” He glared at the both of them, waiting for a comment, but none came. “Then he said something about your sister.” This he directed at Weasley, whose expression darkened. “And, well … you know Potter.”
“Let me know if you want my help, Malfoy.”
During dinner one night, Harry looked up from his food at a gentle prodding from Ron and saw that across the hall, between the Slytherin and Ravenclaw tables, Malfoy had been stopped by a couple of his own housemates, a boy and a girl. He was clearly not making eye contact, head bowed, the meek antithesis of the Draco Malfoy Harry had known and hated for seven years. He could hear voices but not what they were saying. Goyle was nowhere in sight.
Malfoy spluttered, and the flush deepened prettily.

“Too busy to have sex? Surely the Weaslette —”
"I —" starts Draco, and then he breaks off. It's much harder to filter his words when Potter's this close. "Both ... I suppose."
"Mum ..." Draco said slowly.

That was apparently when Goyle had taken it upon himself to start overtly body-guarding Malfoy wherever he went. It was just as well, Harry sometimes thought — Malfoy had come back to Hogwarts looking exactly as would be expected of a seventeen-year-old who'd spent two months in Azkaban being guarded by Dementors: frightfully thin, with hollow cheeks and dark rings around his eyes, and within them not a discernible trace of the old malicious fire Harry remembered so well.
Kreacher was gone with a snap of his fingers and Draco shoved Harry in the shoulder hard.
For just a second, so quickly Harry almost missed it, he saw Malfoy's eyes flicker down to his mouth. For as small a gesture as it was, it certainly made Harry's stomach explode with want. He glanced down at Malfoy's lips and swallowed, confused and aroused and too aware of Malfoy looking at him, of the tension between them thicker and more poignant than ever, of his hand, which was

“Do you want me to stay and wait for you here?” he asked again.
Cho, Harry,” Hermione said flatly, and to his astonishment, there was an underlying tone of amusement in her voice. “I don’t think I have to tell you that, for one thing, I have nothing but bad feelings towards Malfoy. I'm extraordinarily sympathetic to his situation, of course, but that doesn’t change how I feel. I couldn’t
"Thanks for staying, Potter," Malfoy said softly. Harry wanted to respond, but Pomfrey was bustling out of her office now and coming towards Malfoy's bed.

“Well, whatever the reason, I’m glad you’re friends again.”
, did he just say?”
The mention of her current project sets a fire alight in Granger’s eyes. Draco is coming round to the realisation that he’s rather fond of that look. She’s a remarkable person, actually.
Not even two full months into the current school year there had been reports of some dodgy goings-on in Hogsmeade. All this meant to Draco was that students could talk of little else as the investigation proceeded, and that when he Apparated home at the end of the day Harry was usually still working.

“Fine,” Draco said again. “Midnight it is, then.”
“Relax, Malfoy,” he said. He plucked the dragon’s blood from Draco’s hand, his ungodly green eyes stuck on Draco’s as he set it back on its shelf. In spite of his scowling, Draco was entirely prepared to take the bloodroot from Potter, which made it ten steps beyond mortifying when he actually

she rob you of yet more attention."
Clad only in a lacy white bra and his pyjama bottoms, crisp white blouse dangling from his fingers, Draco turned when he heard the bathroom door open and instantly regretted it. Harry had a towel wrapped around his waist, hanging low on his hips and showcasing the thick trail of dark hair that led down from his navel. There were little rivulets of water making their slow, torturous way down his chest, adjusting their course according to the hard lines of muscle they inevitably encountered. Just as bad were his stupid damp curls, tamed for the moment by the weight of the water and nearly touching his shoulders. Thankfully he wasn’t wearing his glasses, and by the time he swiped them from the bedside table, Draco had reigned himself in and returned his focus to getting dressed.
Because he can't think of anything to say, he pulls Potter into a kiss again. Potter kisses like he does everything else: intensely, with emotion. He has an eerie way of staying in control of it, leading Draco in every movement, and he's glad to stop thinking and be led. It's slow and sensual and deep, stealing Draco's breath from right out of his lungs. At some point Potter's fingers delve beneath the sodden material of his knickers and he sinks two all the way inside, tearing a gasping moan from Draco that's halfway between pain and pleasure. It does hurt — this isn't

, Potter?”
It was afternoon, and the early autumn sunlight that beamed down through the ceiling of leaves helped to keep Harry in the present, from becoming fully engulfed in the nightmare once he’d stepped inside.
Malfoy nodded, clearly trying to suppress his grin. “You know, Potter, those Muggle drugs are useless.”
