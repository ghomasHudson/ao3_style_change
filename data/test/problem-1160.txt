Harry asked for a black, green, red, and grey, themed wardrobe, while Carter asked for a purple, orange, charcoal grey, and black themed wardrobe. Both asked for the majority of their clothing to be black. They preferred darker clothing. It made it easier for them to blend into the background. Flashy clothing was asking for trouble.
Harry cast a strong blasting curse at Carter’s shield spell. The wall of crystal shattered the second Harry’s spell struck it.
He found out that Dumbledore had alchemy, transfiguration, charms, wandless magic, arithmancy, strategy, dueling, and healing emblems.
"Could you help us get into Diagon Alley?" Harry asked sweetly. "We are supposed to meet our mother at the bookstore."
Carter was technically his cousin, but Carter and Harry always agreed they should have been twins instead of Carter and Dudley.
“I know,” Harry smiled. It didn’t feel real. They were free of the Dursleys, and they would never have to see them again if Harry had his way. They could study magic freely and learn new spells, they could practice dueling, and eat whatever they wanted. The Potter flat felt like paradise.
They were both wearing their red and black Ballycastle Bats jerseys, while Neville was wearing a grey and black Falcons jersey.
A few days later, Carter and Harry were locked inside of their bedroom after finishing their chores. Harry removed his trunk from under the floorboard, and pointed his wand towards the lock. "Elevating," he whispered the password for the basic storage compartment. The trunk clicked, and he lifted the lid to find a compartment full of fruits, bottles of water, granola bars, and canned soups.
Neville blushed, “No. My gran said I have to wait until I’m 11 to get my wand from Ollivanders like all of the light witches and wizards.”
Lola and another wizard used (what Harry now realized were) wands, to make the alterations to their trunks.
“Good evening students and welcome to Slytherin House,” He began slowly. “My name is Severus Snape, though you will call me Professor Snape. I am the Hogwarts potions professor and the head of Slytherin House. As new members of Slytherin house, there are several rules you must follow. The first rule states you must protect one another, especially in public. Slytherins are regularly targeted and the other professors are biased against dark witches and wizards. They will not help you. Rule number two, you will always present a united front in public, even if you do not get along in private. There is strength in numbers, do not display any weaknesses for the other houses to exploit.”
"Banning all dark magical objects and books probably," Blaise stuffed the paper in his backpack angrily. "Did you bring anything with you to Hogwarts?"
Anger filled him as he considered this. He just left the muggle world, filled with hate and fear behind, just to enter another world filled with hate and fear. How was that fair?
"Good evening children, and welcome to Hogwarts. My name is Professor McGonagall. I am the deputy headmistress of Hogwarts, and I will be teaching your transfiguration classes. In a moment the welcoming feast will begin, but before you take a seat you will be sorted into your houses. Your names will be called in alphabetical order."
Carter and Harry climbed out of bed and pulled out their trunks. Harry changed into a pair of black trousers, a white dress shirt, and a black pea coat. Carter pulled on blue jeans with a purple jumper and a black scarf.
"Carter you're my brother. You have always taken care of me, so I'm always going to take care of you. Did you honestly think I was going to let you rot forever as the Dursley's poor, troublemaking son? We are wizards. Our path is different, and we are better than them."
They spent the next half an hour studying the theory together. Neville spent another 10 minutes practicing the wand movements while Harry and Carter practiced other spells.
"They left you with us because you were dark," Petunia spoke quietly. "You won't stand a chance out there."
The boy flinched and stepped back. "Um hi," he said quietly. He narrowed his eyes as he looked at Harry, "Wow I've never seen an Amber your age before. You must be really powerful."
"What?" Harry stood and walked to the bedroom window. He could see his reflection, and he realized Carter was telling the truth. The irises of his eyes were no longer brown and gold. Now, they were bright yellow.
They cleaned their room within a few hours. The incident was forgotten and never spoken about again.
“Oh,” Neville shifted in his seat. “It’s an underwater prison somewhere in the Atlantic ocean. No one knows where it is. It’s meant to hold the upper power levels. The lower power levels are held in Azkaban, an island prison off the British coast.”
A rather gaunt looking man in ragged clothing leaned casually against the side of the bus. "Welcome to the Knight bus," he said, "emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. My name is Stan Shunpike and I will be your conductor for this morning."
Harry had so many questions after reading the parchment. What did magic classification mean? What were emblems? Who was Sirius Black? And how were his parents so wealthy?
They followed him forward, walking quickly across the black and red stone floor. Harry noticed many witches and wizards wearing Balleycastle and Falcon scarves and jerseys along with their usual unusual clothing. Many of them were buying food from the various food stalls, and Neville stopped at one to buy them all butterbeers.
Harry felt a pull in his chest as he took it all in. He knew in that moment it didn't matter how many years he spent attending Hogwarts, he would never get used to its magnificence.
Carter turned to face Malfoy's frozen form and shouted, "You little coward, attacking someone when their back is turned!" Harry grabbed Carter's shoulder and pulled him back.
After about a half an hour, Madam Malkin finished tailoring their clothing. She led them into a back room where their new wardrobes were hanging on display. Harry gently caressed one of his wool jumpers. It was soft, and new, and his. It wasn't one of Dudley's hand-me-downs.
"Knockturn Alley is perfectly safe, though your mother wouldn't have known that," he said. "Either way, why didn't you write me a letter like she asked?"
Neville seemed to like that idea a lot. He was silent for a moment, but then he nodded slowly. “Okay, but we can’t stay there for too long. My gran is supposed to come and pick me up…”
He put his book inside of the library compartment of his trunk and shrunk it down. He had activated all of the passwords and security features the night they returned from Diagon using Lola's written instructions. He slept soundly at night knowing his belongings were completely safe.
“It made me feel like I was drowning in sadness and cold,” she admitted. “Like it was pulling me under…”
This prompted a passionate discussion about the Inter-House Quidditch and whether they would be allowed to play unofficially throughout the year.
Sarah cringed slightly. Winky’s words didn’t really help the discussion. “Hermione, I know it doesn’t sound fair,” Sarah said as Hermione opened her mouth, “but this is centuries worth of agreements that we’re talking about. It’s a mindset and a lifestyle now that can’t be easily changed. We just need to make sure we’re polite to the elves – they
“Right into Hogsmeade,” said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger. “There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four” – he pointed them out – “but we’re sure we’re the only ones who know about
“I didn’t put it in!” said Harry, grinning broadly. He slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle of potion. It was full of golden liquid and the cork was still tightly sealed with wax. Sarah felt her stomach drop. “I wanted Ron to think I’d done it, so I faked it when I knew you were looking.” He looked at Ron. “You saved everything because you felt lucky. You did it all yourself.”
“I’ve already checked everywhere I could think of,” Lyra huffed. “I even checked the bloody Room of Requirement but it wouldn’t open.”
“We’ve got Order stuff to work on,” Sirius replied. “It’ll just be you guys working on the house today.”
“Relax, mate, the twins aren’t here so you don’t need to worry about anything attacking you,” Weasley said around a mouthful of biscuit. Where he had even gotten one remained unknown.
“Here’s another one you’ve convinced, Sarah!” Draco said excitedly. “Having read your sides of the story I am forced to the conclusion that the
“And that’s it?” Pansy said in disbelief. “No fighting? No insults? Jabs? Please tell me that the rumours of him being fit are accurate. I couldn’t bear the idea of the saviour being
“Who’re you after?” she asked it, languidly removing her orange juice from underneath its beak and leaning forward to see the recipient’s name and address. With a startled blink she realised it was addressed to her. Frowning, she made to take the letter from the owl, but before she could do so, three, four, five more owls had fluttered down beside it and were jockeying for position, treading in the butter, knocking over the salt, and each attempting to give her their letters first.
“Why?” asked Sarah, and her voice rang out sharp and clear in the candlelit room; the old lady shook her head a little at the loud noise.
“But it’s okay if some don’t,” Hermione told her. “It’s okay if you’re not fine. Sarah, you were nearly – “
“Well, that’s wonderful,” Harry said spitefully. ”I would really hate it if my best friend were disgusted by me. But no, he just seems to secretly hate my boyfriend.”
A loud snap made them all jump. Professor Lupin was breaking an enormous slab of chocolate into pieces.
“You do that,” Sarah said distractedly, as someone tapped on her shoulder. Draco was standing behind her, a small, tired smile on his face.
“Getting my robes,” Draco said wryly. “She kicked me out when I wouldn’t stop fidgeting and trying to look through the windows.”
Lupin looked between her and Harry’s determined faces, hesitated, then said, “Well…all right. I’ll try and help. But it’ll have to wait until next term, I’m afraid. I have a lot to do before the holidays. I chose a very inconvenient time to fall ill.”
Harry and Sarah shared a glance, one that was pretty obvious in Sarah’s opinion. It practically screamed that they were hiding something. But there was no way Sarah was going to admit that Harry was hearing voices. Voices only he could hear….
“Sirius…” She muttered weakly, resting a hand briefly on the dog’s head before her vision blurred, knees buckling until everything dissolved into darkness.
“Positive,” said Hermione, shifting Scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of Ron’s four-poster. Sarah had never understood why Ron kept that rat as a pet but by now she had gotten used to seeing the creature trotting around the dormitory or common room. “If we’re going to do it, I say it should be tonight.” Hermione continued, forcing Sarah’s attention back to her.
“No,” said Harry. He looked directly at Sarah and she felt her stomach drop at the expression on his face. She stepped out from under Blaise’s arm and grabbed Hermione and Ron closer.
Fred was looking down at his girlfriend with sharp, brown eyes. Despite how long the two had been dating, Draco was still somewhat wary of the older boy. He wanted the best for Sarah and would not hesitate to destroy the Weasley if he hurt her. So far, however, he had shown to be an excellent boyfriend. Draco would never admit it, but part of him was slightly disappointed he didn’t have a reason to hex someone into oblivion.
A hand grabbed Sarah’s hair and yanked her head back. She screamed as tears of pain came to her eyes. Malicious grey eyes stared back at her as Lucius Malfoy hissed, “You little
“I like you, Draco,” Harry repeated slowly. “Fancy you – whatever you want to call it. I, well, I want to take you out on dates and kiss you –
Nobody spoke. Greyback got up and moved in front of Harry again, crouching down to stare closely at his altered features.
“Harry didn’t do any magic until they were already here,” he reminded them. “It has to be something else.”
“You wouldn’t be saying that if you had to live with it,” Harry smirked. He leant against the doorframe as Draco stood on the porch.
“Harry Potter, sir…Dobby has come to warn you…she…she…” squeaked the elf, shaking violently. He tried to hit himself in the nose and Harry grabbed his tiny arm.
Sarah and Fred joined the crowd surging through the doors and Sarah winked at Draco, Harry, Hermione and Viktor as they passed. She caught sight of Ron walking past with a sour expression on his face, Padma Patil standing next to him in stunning pink robes.
“It’s completely understandable,” Sarah reassured. “It’s a new dynamic for both of us. But you won’t be alone, you’ll have Harry.”
The other three laughed brightly and Sarah watched them all, their figures illuminated by the setting sun. She knew in that moment that no matter what, they would always have each other, and glancing over at Hermione and Ron’s approaching figures, Sarah couldn’t have been happier.
Ron glanced toward the door into the hall to check that Mrs Weasley was not returning yet, then leaned in closer to Harry and Sarah.
“You guys can hang out with us this year, if you’d like?” Draco offered. “It might help keep some of the more enthusiastic students away. We’d understand if you wouldn’t, though – we are a few years younger.”
Sarah waved at Madam Pomfrey quickly before leaving the ward in between Fred and George. Fred wrapped an arm around her waist.
Andromeda intercepted them at one point, Narcissa with her and offered Sarah and Fred her congratulations.
Harry smiled brightly at her. “No,” he confirmed. “I actually thought most people knew, considering that I blurted it out in front of George.”
“We told you to destroy them!” said Mrs Weasley furiously, holding up what were unmistakably more Ton-Tongue Toffees. “We told you to get rid of the lot! Empty your pockets, go on, both of you!”
“Remus said there would be magic we’d never imagine,” Harry continued, ignoring Sarah, quite rudely in her opinion. “She didn’t want to talk in front of you, because it was Parseltongue, all Parseltongue and I didn’t realise, but of course I could understand her. Once we were up in the room, the snake sent a message to You-Know-Who, I heard it happen inside my head, I felt him get excited, he said to keep me there…and then…”
“I’m afraid the poor fellow is ill again,” said Dumbledore. “Most unfortunate that it should happen on Christmas Day.”
“Am I interrupting you gentlemen?” Professor Flitwick called in his squeaky voice. Both Draco and Harry straightened and winced as the professor stared at them. “Pay attention, please.”
“You’re just saying that because you got laid last night,” Pansy drawled, sliding down the bench from where she had been talking to a fifth year.
“Leprechauns!” said Mr Weasley over the tumultuous applause of the crowd, many of whom where still fighting and rummaging under their chairs to retrieve the gold.
They spent the next two hours detailing their exact plans and progress throughout the year. Once they had finished, Professor Dumbledore sent Professors Snape and McGonagall to examine the Vanishing Cabinets in the Room of Requirement.
Black made a startled movement that almost dislodged Crookshanks; Sarah gripped her wand tighter and turned toward the door to see if burst open in a shower of red sparks. Professor Lupin came hurtling into the room, his face bloodless and Sarah nearly sobbed in relief.
“I was researching a theory about the Chamber,” she admitted quietly, looking around to make sure no one was paying them any attention. She noticed a few students watching her warily and she glared back at them.
“You are not in a position to bargain, Potter,” said Antonius Deaumont, his pale face flushed with pleasure. “You see, there are ten of us and only one of you…or hasn’t Dumbledore ever taught you how to count?”
For the first time in weeks and weeks, Sarah was laughing: she could feel the weight of tension leaving her.
“Erm…I don’t know – flying?” Harry said. “Yeah, flying always makes me feel better,” he said again with more confidence. “And nights where we’re relaxing in front of the fire in the common room, like now. Draco usually plays with my hair and I feel so peaceful – like I could just fall asleep then and there.”
Hermione screamed, and Sarah, turning, did not need to ask why. A monstrous spider the size of a small car was trying to climb through the huge hole in the wall: one of Aragog’s descendants had joined the fight.
“Yes, but you were slightly preoccupied,” Pansy said, flapping a hand around. “This is girls only. The boys aren’t invited.”
“Thank you, Nott,” Snape said quietly, his lips curling in an approximation of a smile. Sarah noticed that Draco refused to meet his eye, leaving the professor looking slightly dejected.
“They’re quite useful considering that muggles can’t Floo,” Harry counted, continuing to smile widely at their disbelieving head shakes.
At the far end of the table, Percy and his father were talking about a missing Ministry witch and an important event the Ministry needed to organise.
“You said there have been loads of wands – the Deathstick and whatever they were called – “ Harry noted.
“When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, set upon, by three Muggle boys. They’d seen her doing magic, spying through the back garden hedge: she was a kid, she couldn’t control it, no witch or wizard at that age can. What they saw scared them, I expect. They forced their way through the hedge, and when she couldn’t them the trick, they got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it.”
“Georgie would be proud,” Fred said, once they had all calmed down a bit. “He probably would have been pissed if we all just sat around crying and moping at his funeral.”
He stowed the Cloak under his jacket and they made their way forward unhampered, the icy air stinging their faces as they passed more cottages: Any of them might have been the one in which James and Lily Potter had once lived or where Bathilda lived now. Sarah gazed at the front doors, their snow-burdened roofs, and their front porches, wondering how bizarre it was to be a stranger within their quiet familiarity. Then the little lane along which they were walking curved to the left and the heart of the village, a small square, was revealed to them.
Harry and Ron thought for a moment before Harry nodded. “That is odd, actually. I would have thought he’d have taken the first opportunity to make
Sarah saw Draco grab Harry’s hand tightly and drag him away and she couldn’t help but smile to herself.
“How much has Rosie had to drink?” Draco asked on a laugh as the other woman danced around Naomi, batting her dark eyelashes at the brunette.
Hermione shook her head fondly at him. “Talk to him, Harry,” she repeated. “I think you’re going to be pleasantly surprised.”
“I grew up in England, even though my parents grew up in Bulgaria,” he said, winking. “We moved back to the continent when I was old enough to start school. That’s where I met this unfortunate lump.”
“I appreciate the thought but no thanks,” she said thickly. “If I have to listen to one more word about the Cannons I may just go and sue them until they can never play another match again.”
“I should have taken him home when I had the chance,” Draco said miserably, still stroking Simon’s fur.
The story of Fred and George’s flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that Sarah could tell it would soon become the stuff of Hogwarts legend. They had made sure that nobody was likely to forget them very soon. For one thing, they had not left instructions on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing. Umbridge and Filch had been observed trying different means of removing it but without success. Eventually, the area was roped off and Filch, gnashing his teeth furiously, was given the task of punting students across it to their classrooms. Sarah was certain that McGonagall or Flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant, but just as in the case of the fireworks, they seemed to prefer to watch Umbridge struggle. It was also hilarious to Sarah, considering that she was the one person who knew how to remove it completely and she wasn’t planning on sharing the details any time soon.
Sarah stared at the crowd in annoyance, sticking her tongue out at Blaise when he shot her finger guns and smiled cheekily.
Draco nodded. “Oh, she definitely did. Not ten minutes later, they were snogging in one of the booths and my escape was ruined.”
Mila and Aleksander looked at each other quickly. “No,” Mila said hesitantly, “but ve heard that Fleur’s younger sister vas missing as vell. She got quite upset about it earlier. And the girl Cedric went to the ball vith as vell – I heard your small professor talking about her.”
“Pretty shit but at least it’s over,” shrugged Sarah. “Why the party? I mean, I didn’t expect you guys to celebrate so much when someone – OUCH!”
“You know what these remind me of,” she said to Harry, Hermione and Draco quietly. Ron was helping hand out coins.
Black shapes were emerging out of thin air all around them, blocking their way left and right; eyes glinted through slits in hoods, a dozen lit wand tips were pointing directly at their hearts. Ginny gave a gasp of horror.
“That should be in my vault!” Bellatrix cried. “Where did you get it?” She whirled toward Granger and stalked forward. “What else did you take?
“Exactly,” she stated firmly. “So you will not be taking Greg with you. He’ll be staying at my Manor until further notice.” She turned to Greg. “Unless you’d prefer to say someone else?”
“I have indeed seen it,” Draco said, smiling at Teddy. “It’s truly spectacular.” His eyes cut across to Harry’s and he couldn’t stop the blush that warmed the back of his throat.
“We’re in trouble, they suspect,” said Harry, as the door slammed behind them and he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak. Griphook jumped down from his shoulders; neither Travers nor Bogrod showed the slighted surprise at the sudden appearance of Harry Potter in their midst. “They’re Imperiused,” he added at the other’s confused glances. Sarah nodded in appreciation.
“If you really want to, it’s no problem,” Draco told him. Harry looked at him in surprise and the blond man blushed slightly. “I sometimes take children whose pets are going through an intense surgery to pet the puppies and kittens there. It helps distract them while giving their parents the opportunity to have a break. There has been the occasional adoption after someone’s pet has had to be put down.”
“I am so disgusted right now,” muttered Sarah just as Harry and Draco managed to break through the crowd to them.
Harry and Draco tended to avoid each other whenever possible. They worked together in class, and never spoke when they were both in their dorm room. Clearly Harry's rant during the welcoming feast offended Draco greatly.
Harry pet Amon gently as the bird snapped at a piece of bacon. Amon was much more trusting of Harry after so many visits. The owl clearly loved Hogwarts. There was a lot of open space for hunting.
Harry was just unpacking a couple of the books from his trunk when a small, strange looking creature with big ears appeared suddenly beside him. Harry swore and fell back. He pointed his wand at the creature, “Carter!”
They finished their jobs for the evening and Petunia rewarded them with a slice of bread. Harry ate his quickly before they retreated to their room.
Carter prepared the ingredients as Harry stirred the potion, and added the ingredients at the correct times. Soon enough, the hour had passed and they were handing in their completed potions to Snape.
Amon tipped his head to the side, as if saying 'we will see'. Harry laughed and tossed him another treat.
Harry gently took the bone white wand from Rowan. The handle was curved slightly, which made it comfortable to hold. There were black runes carved into the side, and Harry could feel the strong magic thrumming through the wand.
Harry nodded and smiled, he could read between the lines. He needed to start practicing as soon as possible. Otherwise, he would have no way to protect himself. They would have to go to Rowan's before they returned to the Dursleys tonight.
It took them about 10 minutes of walking, but eventually they came across a shop with the words ‘Rowan’s Wand Shop’ written in silver.
More than anything else though, he was elated. He didn't have to live off of scraps anymore. He could buy food any time he wanted. Good food. He could buy his own clothes and books. He didn't have to wear hand-me-downs anymore.
Carter hung his head, looking defeated. “I don’t get it. It's like my magic just isn’t cooperating.”
Carter and Harry looked at each other, then looked back to Neville. “We are going to Rowan’s in Knockturn. Do you want to come with us? Your gran doesn’t have to know.”
“I guess we have a lot in common then,” Harry smiled grimly. “Hey, what did you mean when you said I was an ‘Amber’ earlier?”
Harry forced himself to stay awake as Vernon and Petunia barged into their room. Vernon's face was purple from yelling, but Petunia turned white as a ghost when she saw him.
“Aww, no brooms,” Carter sighed. “I was really looking forward to trying out my Nimbus 2000. Do you think they will search our trunks?”
He liked Blaise, Theo and Pansy. Blaise was sarcastic and intelligent, Theo was quiet, but witty when he felt like talking, and Pansy knew everyone. She always knew the latest gossip, and was always introducing them to new people from different houses and years.
Professor Snape took a moment to glance over the first year students. Harry thought his maroon eyes lingered on him a moment longer than the rest of the students, but he couldn’t be sure.
It was a Saturday night after dinner and Harry was quietly reading one of the books he had stolen from Dudley. Dudley hated reading, so Harry didn't feel particularly guilty about it.
Neville rubbed the back of his neck, "She's very… intense. She would have questioned both of you for hours and I didn't want you to have to go through that."
Neville nodded, “Yeah, light witches and wizards dislike us for the most part. They don’t trust us because of the Crimson War. Do you know about the war?”
“So your parents were light too?” Harry leaned forward in his seat. “Do… do you know how my parents died?”
“It was Albus Dumbledore, the light lord’s plan to capture the Dark Lord Voldemort. Dumbledore and Voldemort were the leaders of the opposing sides. There was an accident though and the mission went wrong. Many people died, though they did catch Voldemort in the end,” Neville explained. “Who were your parents Harry?”
Harry didn't mind potions. It was rather easy, as long as you knew the properties of each ingredient. Besides, potions were dead useful. There were potions for healing, and sleep, as well as potions for tracking and memory. The previous week Harry made a long list of potions he wanted to learn how to brew before he graduated.
Harry and Carter followed Pansy and Blaise towards the Black Lake, where a tall bearded man was encouraging them all to sit inside of the many boats lining the shore.
The shopkeeper shushed them from the front of the shop, and the boy sighed heavily. "He hates dark magic users. He always gives me a hard time whenever I'm here."
Harry nodded and started to leave. He stopped and removed his backpack to pull his parent's letter from between the pages of one of his books.
"Yes it's true, it hasn't happened in almost four centuries." Daphne leaned forward and whispered, "I even heard a rumor that there is a dark Weasley in our year."
He decided to only ask questions about the vaults for now. He could research his other questions later.
He read through the nights, barely sleeping over the two weeks. There was just so much to learn. He read about Hogwarts houses, and wizarding forms of communication and transportation. He read about wards, ancient runes, goblins, potions, charms, and transfiguration.
"No, when you join the order." Harry smirked. "We are all obviously going to win whatever competitions they throw at us."
Harry just grabbed his shoulder and dragged him over to the book shop while hiding his smile. "I try my best."
Carter then stuffed the extra water bottle, the two-pound coin, and the can of peas underneath a loose floorboard they had found a year ago under Harry's bed.
Harry nodded in agreement. Besides the strange speech, it was unnerving to see a man with entirely white eyes smile. It was hard to tell if the smile was genuine or fake. He assumed it was fake.
Harry and Carter were opposites in terms of appearance. Harry was shorter, with black hair while Carter was tall and blond. The only similarity between them was their eyes. They both had brown eyes with bright flecks of gold.
"You should always be ready for a potential enemy," Snape cut him off. "In a different setting, it may not be a simple
At first he felt overwhelmed by the constant companionship, but now he enjoyed it. It was nice to have other people to discuss books and spells with.
Carter grinned widely. The name change was only symbolic, but Harry knew Carter appreciated it. Carter didn’t want to be associated with the Dursleys anymore.
He slowly tiptoed over to it with Carter close on his heels. His eyes widened when he noticed the letters
They all handed their cores to Rowan. He took them and nodded, “Very good. You may go and sit in the front while I make your wands. It won’t take long.”
“What was that, if you don’t mind me asking? I think my parents died in the war, but I’m not exactly sure.” Harry shrugged sadly.
Petunia seemed shocked by this outburst, as if she expected Carter to show her one ounce of loyalty.
He shrugged, "My mother told me we sit on a stool in front of the other students and put on an ancient looking hat. The hat then decides which house we belong to."
“No it’s okay,” Harry shrugged a little too casually. “I know. My parents fought for the other side. But I know for a fact my parents wouldn’t have wanted me to be a second class citizen. They would have wanted me to stand up for myself.”
Harry sat there with his wand pointed at the creature, waiting for Carter to come back. It was unnerving. The creature was staring at him as if it… loved him? He wasn’t sure what that meant.
“Owling is like delivering letters using an owl," he explained. "You guys probably don’t have an owl yet?”
Harry looked down at his own baggy clothing and nodded. "Yeah they might just kick us out if we go in there like this."
They didn’t have to search long for the cafe, it was just across from the entrance to Knockturn Alley. “Well that was easy,” Carter said.
Carter nodded as if he had already guessed this. Harry tipped his head, "Where do you think you will go?"
“My father said there is no way I won’t be the Slytherin seeker next year. It’s basically guaranteed…”
Carter nudged him to get his attention and Harry refocused his attention. They needed to get into Diagon Alley, and his parents wrote they needed to ask the bartender for help.
Basic wards: Prevents the trunk and it's contents from being damaged by both violent intent, misuse and time. (5 galleons)
By the end of the meal they were both grinning and laughing. "That was so good," Carter smiled as he finished his last bite. "I don't think I have ever had food this good."
He was still tired, but he also felt strangely energized. He felt strong. He could feel it running through his veins like electricity.
Harry nodded, "Yes." He pointed out everything he wanted. He asked for all of the compartments to large compartments except for the weapons and quidditch compartments. Those he wanted to be medium sized.
Together, the three of them made their way to the back of Diagon Alley where they found a very dark, narrow walkway. Neville looked nervous, but Carter confidently led the way through. They eventually came to a solid wall of black stone. They looked around for the entrance, but couldn’t seem to find one.
Neville noticed her too, and grabbed Harry and Carter's hands before pulling them away from her and out the door.
A shorter girl with dark hair approached their group, "Actually my father said there are more dark witches and wizards in our year than light witches and wizards. I'm Daphne Greengrass by the way."
Next to the sitting area on the back wall of the dorm room was medium sized window. The window was identical to the ones in the common room, just on a smaller scale. It displayed the Black Lake, in all of its green, eerie glory.
"What happened to me?" He asked in a panic as he tried to get a better look. "And what happened to our room?"
"Let's just pay them," Carter said. "We could threaten them, but that would only work temporarily. But we both know Vernon and Petunia are greedy. Let's just pay them to leave us alone."
“Yeah,” Neville nodded. “The Light Lord Dumbledore is a Moonstone, and the Dark Lord Voldemort is an Obsidian.”
The other was a dark skinned girl with black, wavy hair. Wearing white robes with royal blue and silver adornments, she was sitting at the end of the Gryffindor table in another high backed chair. While the boy was sitting far away from the professors, she sat at the end of the table closest to them. Harry could see she was wearing a silver pendant as well, but he couldn't tell what was on it. The students around her were wearing plain white robes and had dark blue pendants hanging from their necks.
The falcons appeared next, followed by white fireworks taking the shape of a grand falcon. Neville cheered and clapped.
Harry thought to himself. He wanted to be the best in his year, and he wasn't about to let anyone get in his way.
Harry smirked and reread his letter. "We should probably pick up our books as soon as possible. That way we can start studying immediately."
Malfoy's face turned an even darker shade of red. He was quiet for a long moment before he finally gave a quiet, "Yes."
He pulled out a book and began flipping through it. Eventually he found his page and set it on the table in front of Harry and Carter. He pointed to a table and explained,
"I don't know," Harry shrugged. "You might be. We will have to go to Diagon Alley tomorrow to find out."
He continued inside the bank with Carter following closely behind him. He had to hide his expression of awe as he admired the interior of the bank. There was gold everywhere. In the floor, in the pillars, on the ceiling. He quickly realized the goblins must be incredibly wealthy.
Harry raised his hand next. Alexander called on him, looking annoyed. “How old do you have to be to become king?”
Carter nodded, "We will go look tonight. Just make sure to grab the flashlight while you are cleaning the garage."
When Harry entered his dorm room, he was surprised to see a piece of folded black parchment on his pillow. He looked over to Draco’s bed and noticed there was an identical one on his pillow too.
"No," Carter whispered. "But I will go wherever the hat wants me to go. I just have a feeling it will be Gryffindor."
They wandered around for the next 15 minutes until they came across a grand white building with tall, ancient looking pillars. The words 'Gringotts Bank' were inscribed above large wooden doors in gold. Harry took a deep breath and climbed the steps.
"And you are aware that children who elevate at a young age are almost guaranteed to peak in one of the upper power levels?"
Carter just blinked slowly before reaching for the letter. Harry gave it to him as he thought everything over.
"Nope, let's go. If it bothers you so much, consider it a 'thank you' gift for always putting up with me." Carter laughed and Harry pushed him into the store.
Carter's robes turned from white and black to red and black. He smiled as some students from the Gryffindor table clapped. Most however, just pointed and whispered.
Carter smiled. "Yes it is, and we are going to see the magical world. That sounds more fun than the zoo."
It all started one day while scrubbing the floor. He started feeling dizzy, so he sat back on his heels. He closed his eyes for a moment, and the feeling gradually faded.
The store was very busy, there were kids everywhere pointing various items out to their parents. Carter was immediately drawn to the broom in the window. Harry read the handle, “The Nimbus 2000.”
Harry took a deep breath and grabbed a pinch of the green powder. He tossed it into the orange flames and watched them flare green. “Ballycastle Stadium!” He stepped inside the flames and gasped as his body spun and compressed. He fell hard to his knees when he finally stopped spinning.
They eventually found themselves standing in front of a shop with large, glittering windows. Neville led them inside, and Harry quickly found himself overwhelmed by the sheer number of trunks stacked all over the store.
Whispers broke out across the room. “What’s that?” Carter asked Neville, but Neville just shook his head in confusion.
Carter huffed. "Yeah good luck with that. Neville said they hate us. Why would they teach us to defeat them? We are the enemy."
Harry looked over the tables and soaked up the information. So he was an Amber? He pointed to the table, “I’m not supposed to be an amber until I turn 14? Then how…?”
Carter threw his arms around both Harry and Neville's shoulders, "We're just the best, what can we say?"
There were red trunks, black trunks, blue trunks, and green trunks. Trunks that looked to be made of pure gold, and some that were almost translucent. Harry had no idea why anyone would want a translucent trunk, but it wasn't his business.
Carter's eyes were wide as Harry used the force of his mind to slowly lower the ladder to the floor.
"Really?" Neville asked with wide eyes. In that moment Harry realized Neville probably didn't have many friends.
They went downstairs and walked into the kitchen. Petunia was already there making tea for herself. She nearly dropped the kettle when she saw them.
Draco ignored this and instead asked, "Did your parents mix you guys up with different babies or something? There has never been a dark Potter or Longbottom."
Harry, Neville, Luna and Sarah were now the only ones left fighting the Death Eaters, two of whom sent streams of silver light like arrows past them that left craters in the wall behind them. Luna was thrown off her feet and hit her head against the wall, crumpling to the ground, groaning.
“That’s revolting, Potter,” Draco sneered, but his lips twitched upward slightly, giving away his amusement.
Sarah turned to Draco, who was sitting beside her and practically inhaling his food. She stared in shock, momentarily forgetting her original question. “Are you quite alright, Draco? Did Narcissa not feed you this holiday?”
“Nope, not jesting,” said Sarah, her eyes flicking from Death Eater to Death Eater, looking for a weak link. “How come Voldemort wants it?”
met her ears as she finally managed to extricate the locket. She shoved it into her handbag and drew her wand.
“So,” she said, swirling her glass slowly and watching as the wine flowed up and down, “how was your day, darling?”
“Especially when you consider that he finally settled on Belgium chocolate,” Sarah added, rolling her eyes.
Hermione snatched the newspaper and read it aloud angrily, Ron’s face getting gradually redder and redder. Draco’s face was blank; it wasn’t surprising considering his current rocky relationship with his godfather.
Draco frowned slightly at the writing. “This seems familiar for some reason but I can’t place why.” He turned back to Harry. “You should be careful using these instructions. Who knows what someone could add into the notes.”
“Odd,” said George lightly. “I used Jelly-Legs. Looks as though those two shouldn’t be mixed. He seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face. Well, let’s not leave them here, they don’t add much to the décor.”
“Actually, Pomfrey kicked me out about four hours ago,” Fred smirked. “But I promised Draco I’d keep an eye on you, so here I am.”
Harry blushed before quickly explaining how he had noticed that the diary was unaffected by the ink spill yesterday afternoon and that he had decided to test it out last night.
After a long pause, Harry said, “Hermione, we don’t need another Godric’s Hollow. We talked ourselves into going there, and – “
Draco had to admit that Granger’s personality was growing on him, although the thought made him internally scowl each time it made itself known.
Draco laughed and stood up as well, taking her hand to lead her downstairs. “I’m sure we can figure something out,” he promised.
“For such a graceful person you’re horrible at landings,” he snickered, slipping his hand into hers.
Harry frowned. “We’re just going to have to figure out a way to contact them through unofficial channels.”
They spent a few hours taming Hermione’s hair with Sleakeazy’s potion. The eventually managed to get the curls to fall in a silky wave down her back and Draco spent an exorbitant time carefully transforming it into a stunning updo with some curls strategically left down to frame Hermione’s face.
Ron had spent the entire afternoon and evening telling anyone who would listen about Hermione’s promotion to the primary Secretary to the Minister of Magic. Harry was unsurprised and proud, but if Ron told him
Sarah felt slightly sick looking at the multiple deep lacerations painting Draco’s chest. Blood flowed freely from a few of the wounds while others looked half-healed.
Harry gasped and his eyes flew open. Sarah brushed his hair out of his eyes as she waited for him to catch his breath.
Slughorn looked slightly put-out for a moment before he cleared his throat and said uncomfortably, “Well, yes, very good, Mr Malfoy…Now, it’s time for us to start work.”
A flash of red in her peripheral made Sarah turn around. Ginny was standing behind her, looking worried but relieved.
They all stared at Harry in silence for a few heartbeats, none of them knowing what to say. Finally, Sarah shook her head and asked, “You think Gregorovitch had the Wand?”
His brown eyes sparkled with so many emotions but now Sarah could clearly see the love that shone through. She had never felt this way about someone. Yes, she loved Draco and Harry and all her friends but it wasn’t that same way she loved Fred. She felt as if she couldn’t contain a smile when he was nearby; like he could make any bad situation better. She could trust him to push her when she needed it but also know when she wanted to be left alone.
“Because he was friends with my mother, so I wanted to know why he had never told me about Sirius Black and her friendship,” Sarah explained. “I also might have shouted at him that he should have at least talked to you,” she finished sheepishly.
Neville was in total disgrace. Professor McGonagall was so furious with him she had banned him from all future Hogsmeade visits, given him detention, and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the tower. Poor Neville was forced to wait outside the common room every night for somebody to let him in, while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him. Sarah had gotten Harry to swear that he would make sure Neville always got into the common room in the evenings.
Sarah had been keeping an eye on the younger girl and had noticed that she was getting paler as the weeks went by. Her red hair hung limp around her face and she had large dark circles under her eyes. More than once, Sarah had tried to ask Ginny if she was okay but Ginny always managed to hurry away before Sarah could hear more than a weak, “I’m fine.”
“Well, I couldn’t leave you all to fend for yourselves,” she stated tiredly. “Poor Hermione would have had her work cut out for her.”
Harry’s scar kept prickling. He said that it usually happened when he was wearing the Horcrux, but sometimes he could not stop himself from reacting to the pain.
“Thank you, Draco,” Sarah said gratefully, kissing his cheek. “You guys didn’t have to wait up for us.”
There were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of fish against flesh. Somebody grunted appreciatively. Sarah pressed the Extendable Ear deeper into her own. Over the murmur of the river she could make our more voices, but they were not speaking English or any human language she had ever heard. It was a rough and unmelodious tongue, a string of rattling, guttural noises, and there seemed to be two speakers, one with a slightly lower, slower voice than the other.
“Greyback, you like them young, don’t you?” crooned Bellatrix, beckoning the large, werewolf over to them. “I’m done with her for now. Have your fun.”
“I just wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the Duelling Club,” said Harry earnestly.
“Have they?” Sarah said while Pansy shot Blaise and incredulous look. “I’m afraid I don’t know too much about Wrackspurts, would you be interested in telling me about them sometime?”
“Oh what a fine way to spend six months!” Mrs Weasley shrieked. “No wonder you didn’t more O.W.L.s!”
“Antonius. Why don’t you do the honours this evening?” Voldemort’s eyes shone brightly in the firelight – cruel amusement glimmering in the slit pupils.
Remus smiled slightly. “Fudge heard Sirius was at the Ministry and Dumbledore hinted that it might be beneficial for Fudge to reconsider – er –
Lyra glanced up helplessly at her brother and couldn’t stop the sob that wracked through her body. Draco pulled her against him as the strength left her muscles. Their shuddering breaths echoed throughout the surrounding silence, a cacophony of sorrow etching deeper into their hearts.
Fred pulled something from the inside of his cloak with a flourish and laid it on one of the desks. It was a large, square, very worn piece of parchment with nothing written on it. Sarah raised an eyebrow at it, unimpressed.
Fudge still had a strange smile on his face. A creeping sensation built up in Sarah for the cause of his hesitance to believe Dumbledore’s words. Fudge glanced once more at Harry before answering.
There was a knock on the clinic’s front door and both Draco and Rosie looked towards the double doors hiding the front from view.
Mrs Weasley was still bustling around the room, handing out food and drinks to everyone despite the fact that most of them could barely manage to move. Andromeda and Narcissa Malfoy watched the proceedings from their strategic position next to the hard-to-reach Christmas tree with matching soft smiles.
“I think he’s left the school to do something with the Order,” said Hermione in a low voice. “I mean…it’s all looking serious, isn’t it?”
“Whatever you say, Sev,” smirked Sarah. Severus rolled his eyes at her and tapped the pamphlet with his wand, causing it to unfold and highlight certain pieces of information.
It was so packed inside the store that no one looked twice as she emerged from under the cloak. She could feel Harry following closely at her back.
“Very – very well,” said Madam Pomfrey, looking startled. She quickly went to a nearby cabinet and brought out two small vials which she placed on Sarah and Harry’s bedside tables. “These are pain-relieving potions for until I come back.” She too left.
As the walls trembled again, Harry led Sarah and the others back through the concealed entrance and down the staircase into the Room of Requirement. It was empty except for three women: Ginny, Tonks and an elderly with wearing a moth-eaten hat, whom Sarah recognised immediately as Neville’s grandmother.
The air through which they needed to move seemed to have become solid: Sarah was right, they could not Disapparate; the Death Eaters had cast their charms well. The cold was biting deeper and deeper into Sarah’s flesh. The five of them retreated down the side street, groping their way along the wall, trying not to make a sound. Then, round the corner, gliding noiselessly, came Dementors, ten or more of them, visible because they were of a denser darkness than their surroundings, with their black cloaks and their scabbed and rotting hands. Could they sense fear in the vicinity? Sarah was sure of it: they seemed to be coming more quickly now, taking those dragging, rattling breaths she detested, tasting despair on the air, closing in –
“And its Slytherin in possession. Sarah Deaumont of Slytherin with the Quaffle, heading straight for the Gryffindor goalposts – Quaffle intercepted by Alicia Spinnet – WHAM! – Bludger to the back from Warrington, Spinnet drops the Quaffle, it’s caught by – Pucey, who passes to Deaumont, who swerves around George Weasley trying to shoot a Bludger her way – impressive flying, that one – she passes to Flint who drops it from a Bludger from Fred – Johnson catches it and turns around but’s cut off by a Bludger from Bole – Deaumont grabs the Quaffle and is off – SHE SCORES! TEN-ZERO TO SLYTHERIN!”
“Follow me,” said Narcissa, leading the way across the hall. “Unfortunately, my husband and sister are not here at the moment but they will be back momentarily.”
“Neither do I,” Harry said. “I had no idea she was going to do that. We were just talking about Cedric and she suddenly came onto me.”
They moved together fluidly until Sarah began to stutter in her movements. Fred began to push harder up into her as she rushed towards the edge.
“For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated. But then disagreements sprang up between them. A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin wished to be more
There was a silence as they digested this. Sarah wasn’t really surprised that Voldemort made such a mistake. Hermione obviously thought the same.
“No worries, I was on my way down for dinner anyway,” Sarah said. “I’ll get Amanda to send us up some food.”
There was a moment’s silence, during which Kreacher straightened up to look Draco full in the face. Then he said, “Yes.”
“Holy shit, Draco!” she shouted, observing the intricately designed book and quill. The book was light but had a beautiful snow-covered forest scene depicted on its leather cover and the quill was covered in delicate, handwritten runes. The notes attached to it said that Draco had charmed it so that anything written in it would appear in a corresponding book, and vice versa.
Draco stiffened as his father walked into the library. Lyra was sitting beside him, a book open in her lap, yet she had been on the same page for nearly five minutes already. They were both aware that a group of people had arrived at the outskirts of the wards minutes before.
“Kreacher will stay here until his head sits on the wall alongside his ancestors,” Kreacher said solemnly.
Hermione pulled out her wand. Sarah laughed in delight as Crabbed hurriedly stepped backwards, then ran away, Goyle following in confusion.
“I thought this belonged to that bloke Perkins at the Ministry?” Harry asked, starting to disentangle the tent pegs.
“Master called?” he said in his low, bullfrog voice. He rose his head and caught sight of Narcissa, Lyra and Draco. “Mistress Cissy? Master Draco? Mistress Lyra?” His bulbous eyes teared up and he dropped into a low bow, his long nose brushing the floor. “How can Kreacher be serving you?”
“Believe me, I was just as surprised,” Draco told him. “But I think it’s because of how they helped each other heal after the war. Did you know that George saved Lyra from falling when she was looking for me during the battle?”
Lyra and Draco followed cautiously and Lyra stifled a cry of shock when she saw Dumbledore leaning heavily against the metal railing, two broomsticks beside him.
Sarah closed her eyes as Draco’s grip on her intensified. Mrs Longbottom shot a look over her shoulder before glancing at Neville again.
“We’ve only been here for two weeks!” Sarah complained in a low voice. “How is it possible to already have this much work?”
“I’d thought you’d be used to that, Sarah – it’s the Slytherin common room covered in it?” Dean asked, his lip twitching.
“Of course I care, Sarah,” Fred said. “You’re not just my girlfriend, you’re my friend, my fellow partner-in-crime when George is busy.” At that, Sarah let out a slight laugh. “You’re important, to a lot of people, and you deserve to be happy,” he continued.
Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands. After a long pause, he said, “How can you be sure, Potter, that my brother wasn’t more interested in the greater good than in you? How can you be sure you aren’t dispensable, just like my little sister?”
Sarah thought for a moment and answered truthfully, “I feel numb.” Fred tensed slightly but then resuming stroking, pressing a soft kiss to the side of her head. Sarah continued, feeling the need to out what she was feeling into words, “I was terrified that night and it hurt – it hurt so much to be under that curse. But now – now I just feel nothing. Sometimes I’ll feel angry or immensely sad but other than that…I just feel empty and tired.”
Almost as though Harry had spoken allowed, a warm body pressed against his ass, hands caressing the back of his legs.
, inside her, driving in. Her inner walls tried to keep her lover’s cock inside. Hermione was babbling, most of her words unintelligible amongst the desperate cries falling from her lips.
Malfoy came around, leaning up against the door beside Potter. “Like that Potter? How does it compare to mine?”
Luna released Hermione's breast to look at her straight on. "I was going to tell you, only it didn't seem like the right time yet, after just a few weeks. I'm trans. I was born a girl in a boy's body. My mother, she was a brilliant witch. The potions experiments she was working on were to help me transition permanently from a male body to a female one. She got
A slap to his face caught Harry by surprise. "Hands off," Ginny hissed. "Fucking slut." She pushed his hands to the ground as she bent over him to brace for leverage. "You just can't help it, can you? How do you do it, make people want to fuck you?"
She wrapped her hand around the base of Luna's cock. She liked the feel of it in her hand, the heaviness of it. It was rather pretty for a cock, matching Luna perfectly despite not really matching her at all. Hermione felt sure that, cock or pussy, she would still be very interested in pleasing Luna.
turn for a taste." He yanked Harry against his very well-toned body, capturing Harry's lips in a heated kiss.
She fell to her knees. Once she was on level with it, she was unsure of what to do. She'd never done this before. Glancing up, she tried to convey her feelings without speaking and, miraculously, Luna seemed to understand what she needed.
Potter's whimpering changed as the boy started to come, thin strands of cum painting his filthy chest, the orgasm forced out and prolonged by Horace's tight grip on his cock, which Horace kept up, stroking the boy back to full mast and desperate again.
Desperate now, she helped Luna strip out of her robes, not stopping until Luna was completely nude. She stopped to admire the sight of her lover, pale and faintly trembling with need. Her eyes traced the small breasts adorned with tiny pink buds, swept her gaze down past the trim waist to the proud cock jutting from a neat blonde thatch of pubic hair, narrow with a delicate curve.
, people had been trying to fuck him since before he could remember. They just hadn't been successful before now.
want..."  One of Luna's fingers curled and pressed in a little, the faintest of penetrations where Hermione was soaking her panties.
"Argh!" Cormac reared back, lip bleeding freely, letting Harry go. Harry didn't get to take more than a few steps back before Cormac came at him, rage in his eyes. "Ungrateful bitch!" Cormac snarled, slapping Harry so hard across the face that his glasses went askew, another slap sent them flying off his face altogether and Harry tumbled to the floor.
Malfoy slumped in the chair, eyeing the streaks of cum drying on Potter’s skin. He wanted to rub it in, make the Golden Boy reek of sex for days.
Tears spilled from Hermione's eyes at the tenderness in Luna's voice. "Love me then," she whispered, her own voice cracking on the surge of love for this woman.
Severus spared a moment to caress the stretch marks covering Potter's belly. He'd help make them, in a way, even if it had been the werewolf's seed the boy had borne. It had been
"Malfoy raped me" Harry choked out, shuddering as  Zambini's thick cock slid in and out, nice and slow, as though he had all the time in the world to fuck Harry. Fuck, it felt good..."I didn't ask the slimy git for anything."
Luna's smug grin distracted Hermione from the nerves that hit. Luna crawled over Hermione and pressed in, her cock stretching Hermione’s pussy better than fingers alone could do. In and in and in until Luna's hips pressed to her own. They stayed that way, locked together, breathing, adjusting.
Tugging at the bra forced Hermione's breast to spill out, baring it to the world until Luna enveloped the nub again, suckling gently at it.
It really shouldn’t have made his cock twitch, Ginny bringing up Voldemort, only Harry was reminded of a much younger Voldemort, a more
Madame Pince glided past them, staring pointedly at Hermione, who ducked behind her book again, her face beet-red.
"Sorry Cormac, but I need find someone." Harry made to turn, to get away, only Cormac grabbed his wrist and wouldn't let him go. "Fuck off, Cormac," Harry growled.
Severus held still, staring into Lily's eyes. His cock twitched inside Potter and the boy's eyes fluttered shut as he moaned.
“I- I think so-?” Corny watched Harry apprehensively. She turned back to her husband. “You wanted to go—?”
Still, he tried to thrust up, needing release, knowing it wouldn't come, that she wouldn’t let him come.
Harry’s head swam. He rubbed his belly absently as he took long pulls of whatever was in the glass. He ran his tongue over his lips, his teeth, chasing the sweet, cloying taste. His head swam a little more, then a lot more.
Severus sank into thought, vaguely aware of Horace bending said boy in half and doubling his efforts. He thought of the stretch marks marring Potter's belly, clear evidence of a pregnancy despite Potter's lack of memory of it. Headmaster Dumbledore had almost certainly Obliviated the boy, perhaps was
After nearly an hour of this, Harry saw an opportunity to escape when a devastatingly beautiful witch approached the professor for a hug.
put up a struggle, useless as it was — angled Harry just right to plunge into Ginny's wet cunt as Cormac took pace inside Harry again, forcing Harry to fuck her.
Reeling, Harry tried to crawl away. Cormac kicked at his arm, knocking Harry onto his face. His nose hurt, but at least it wasn’t bleeding. He tried crawling away again. Cormac kicked his legs apart, was between them an instant later and driving his cock in to the hilt, his hands tight around Harry's hips to keep him in place while Cormac took his pleasure.
Potter cried out, rearing back up to his hands and knees. His body shook for a different reason now.
He pressed his cock to Harry's lips, letting that lithe little tongue lap at his crown, cleaning it off.
For a long moment, Ginny didn't move, apparently stunned, but soon she was scrambling to lay on her back under Harry, legs spread wide to either side of Harry's. Cormac forced Harry down over her and, wrapping a hand around Harry's cock — here Harry
But she wasn't stopping Cormac at all. Maybe if Harry could think beyond trying to catch his breath, it would make sense to him, but he could only take Cormac's thick cock and stare up at the blob that was Ginny, his own cock drooling precum onto the floor.
But fucking the boy again had yielded the same feeling, the same surge of magic when it should have been impossible.
.  He should be feeling the tightness and faint squirming from the inside too, shouldn’t he, not just under his hand?
"If you’re asking," Hermione panted, "whether I have a problem with you fucking me with that beautiful cock, the answer is no, Luna. I have absolutely
“Oh! There you are, Arnie, wonderful to see you again. Arnie Hespot. Puts his Potions NEWTS to good use with his skin care inventions,
He hadn’t meant to open his eyes, but a part of him wanted to know who was taking him this time, wanted to maybe find this person again, when the party ended.
"Horace. Horace!" Snape practice bellowed to get his colleague's attention. Said colleague had his cock buried inside Potter's ass, fucking the well-used slut yet again. Sloppy wet sounds filled the air as Slughorn moved through countless loads of cum.
“Meet Benjamin Raste. Benny here works in the Ministry’s International Department as a Liaison, constantly flying to America the
Finally, Potter stirred to consciousness when Horace came, adding yet another load of cum to seep to the floor. Severus's stomach turned a little when Horace kissed Potter, tongue-fucking his mouth thoroughly. The boy — dutiful slut that he was — sucked on his professor's tongue eagerly, rolling his hips to better take Horace's fat cock, which eagerly renewed its thrusting inside Potter. He watched as Horace all but suffocated the boy under his immense bulk, all in the name of coming yet again inside the little whore.
Someone, a witch maybe, came on his cock. Some other witch nearby congratulated her. His legs were pushed to his chest and held there as a cock thrust in deep, only inside long enough to come, the length pulsing inside of Harry before withdrawing, cum seeping from a hole that gaped wide open. Another took its place. And another. Harry swallowed the cum in his mouth, barely getting it down, then another cock was pressed to his lips.
Was it something in the punch? Everyone had been pressed to at least try it (such a good idea, tasted fucking amazing).
The problem was it was Harry's pleasure too. He was well prepared to take Cormac and the angle he was rutting away at did lovely things to Harry's prostate.
When Snape came, he bent over Harry, folding his body in half to seize Harry’s lips in a rough, biting kiss that Harry returned, clutching desperately at the professor’s robes. A strange sensation swept through Harry, like magic only different to what he usually experienced.
Cormac did his best to follow Ginny's advice. If Harry had been less stretched, had less cum inside him, he might have been torn apart by Cormac's animal fucking, but Harry loved it.
“Corny?” A wizard squeezed his way out of the crowd, his hair fell in artful red waves to his shoulders. He was as beautiful as Cornwaella was. “Time to go, I think—” He caught sight Harry, hand still pressed to Cornwaella’s baby bump. “What—?”
Without warning, Potter levered himself up high enough to kiss Severus, coaxing his clever tongue inside when Severus parted his lips.
“Ahh!” Zambini drove deep and went still, eyes squeezed closed, panting against the slick curve of Potter’s back. When he pulled out, his seed followed, dripping from Potter’s used hole to the closet floor.
Hermione wrapped her arms around Luna's neck, her legs around Luna's hips. Never before had she felt so close, so connected to another person.
The buffet table was more entertaining than most of Slughorn’s guests, in Harry’s opinion. Plates of food had been charmed to wander about the table on spindly legs, the dishes clinking softly against each other as they gathered close to the edge, trying to tempt passersby. Some of the dishes had started to fight each other as Harry looked from one to another, unsure if it was safe to reach for that yummy looking pastry or if he’d lose his hand in the process.
A puddle of seed grew under Harry's ass, his pubic hair was a fairly disgusting mix of dried and drying cum. Harry just lay prone on the stone floor, unknowing and uncaring about who used his body.
potions that had sped up Potter's pregnancy, making him go through nine months of growth in a matter of weeks, at Lupin's behest. He hadn't done it for Lupin as any favor (though the Wolf certainly owed him now that he'd abandoned the war, fleeing with the progeny Potter had carried for him). No, Severus had done it to see the boy brought low, nothing more than a slut and a vessel for his master's seed.
"Party stays here, lads," said some wizard getting his knob blown at a table nearby. "Best to ride it out here."
her dad and the whole blackmailing thing she’d responded with (doing her level-best to make Harry die from sexual frustration), but even she didn’t seem to want to look a gift horse in the mouth.
And right behind him was Ginny, sullen and glaring at him, tits jiggling as she marched after Cormac.
The man’s body was thick and soft, pressed against Harry’s legs and ass. Labored panting came from above Harry. It strongly reminded him of Dudley or Vernon when their larger bulks would move atop him.
"What do I have to do teach you a lesson? I've tried to warm you off the Gryffindors. Should I have done the opposite? Should I have tied you up in the common room with a sign painted on your ass? —'Public Use’? — Just let anyone have at you? Or maybe I should truss you up in the dungeons and let the
Severus knelt between the boy's legs, stroked them, held them further apart so that little arsehole was tight once again as he sank, inch by inch, into Potter's warm wet heat. He ignored Potter's whimpers, the bucks the boy made trying to get Severus to fuck him.
In his defense, lying about having a ‘boyfriend’ was easier because — “hey I’m just going to the Hog’s Head to let random skeevy wizards fuck me blind while wearing a hood so that the barkeep doesn’t release his incriminating photos of me screwing the twins (and countless other wizards now), don’t wait up!” — didn’t exactly roll off the tongue.
Potter whimpered. Still shaking, he braced himself on all fours, bent forward and—laved his tongue across the cum-splattered floor.
"Um—" Cormac tried to interject, jacking his cock with a speed that made Harry dizzy to look at, but Ginny wasn't having it, cutting him off with a fierce glare as she worked herself frantically on Harry's cock.
Cormac gripped Harry by the face and got rough, slamming as hard as he could into Harry's throat, expecting to feel gagging, surprised when Harry kept sucking and moaning, unaffected by the rough treatment.
Absently, Harry brought his other hand to rest on his own belly, rubbing, feeling the upraised ribbons of the deeper scars that trailed from his sides. He could feel them even through his clothes, faint, but he knew where each one of them was, had spent hours with his shirt off, running his hands over them.
“I can’t believe you don’t want to take your boyfriend to Slughorn’s Christmas party.” Hermione needled at him in a half-whisper, glancing over her shoulder.
One of Luna's hands left Hermione's face to slide down, cupping her breast, gently thumbing at her hardening nipple.
Her pussy was starting to ache. Hermione rubbed her legs together, but the teasing pressure only made it worse.
Fred and George? I could have castrated you. I tried to, I tried to give you the biggest blue balls, just like you did me." Ginny groaned, wrapped her legs around Harry's waist, awkwardly overlapping Cormac's grip. "I can see why they wanted you though. Fucking
Harry woke late the next morning, feeling more sore than he ever remembered being. He lay flat on his back in his four-poster bed, having no memory of how he'd gotten there.
Cormac looked dubious but he knelt over Harry's face. He slapped at Harry's lips with the wet tip, pulling it out of the way when Harry's tongue tried to chase him. He slapped all over Harry's face, teasing him, smearing precum as he went, making a mess.
Apparently, Ginny had been watching them, because she looked from Cormac to Harry with a raised eyebrow.
Keeping eye contact, Severus fucked the boy hard, allowing himself to steal into the boy's thoughts, driving him wild with need as he thrust in at just the right angle to make Potter's legs shake, his breathing to pant and wheeze, his cock to drool a continuous line of precum to his scarred belly.
His head swam, vision blurring. He looked around. A lot of people were either naked or getting there. Bodies undulated against each other, moans began to echo against the stone walls, the air thickening with the musky scent of sex.
you?” The witch drawled, swooped down on Slughorn. She engulfed him in a big hug. Her delicate arms looked ridiculous around his stout frame.
"Hmmm perhaps in a minute." Luna cast a cushioning charm beneath herself before settling down on her front between Hermione's legs, half draped over her hips. Her eyes didn’t leave her lover's for a moment as she lapped at Hermione's swollen clit in slow, gentle flicks.
“I think I overwhelmed him, poor dear.” Corny gave the man — clearly her husband — a sheepish look. Gently, Corny removed Harry’s hand from her body.
"Yeah, here—" Cormac dragged Harry onto his knees, his back pressed to Cormac's chest. "Come on, Gin. We can
" Severus came deep inside the boy. There was no surge of magic this time, Potter already pregnant with his seed, but Severus caressed the boy's belly all the same, thrusting minutely as if pushing his cum in a little deeper would do anything more than make Potter groan low in his throat.
The pair squeezed into the crowd, leaving Harry standing by the table of impatiently dancing hors d'oeuvres, alone and feeling it quite keenly.
Something niggled at the back of his mind, like something forgotten trying to resurface, accompanied by a sense of loss and horror and
Harry whined, burying his head in Ginny's neck. This wasn't fair at all. He could only let himself be used.
His eyes opened and when they locked onto the hate-filled black eyes of Professor Snape, fully clothed but for the cock he pounded into Harry with, Harry came, untouched, never taking his eyes off of Snape.
"Cornwaella McGinty." She smiled warmly. "But everyone calls me Corny. Terrible name for a witch, I'll thank my mother for that. I'm hoping to do better by my daughter, when she comes finally along." She patted her tummy, which Harry only now realized was protruding rather far away from her person.
With a smoldering grin, Ginny closed the scant distance between herself and Cormac, sliding a hand down his chest, down down—
to know), Harry’s attention began to wander, wishing he was in his bed in Gryffindor Tower alone with his toys.
Hermione pulled away from Luna's heated kiss, her breathing shaky as she dropped her head back against the wall they were snogging against.
take their frustrations out on you. Prolly stop the war, it would. Harry Potter, seducing You Know Who’s followers away with his tight little ass. The Chosen Slut saves the world."
Potter had been a guileless slut, trying to seduce his professor (he'd succeeded, much to their shared pleasure). Fucking Potter first with his own butt plug, then with his cock when Potter had passed out had been a treat Severus had more than earned. The surge of magic he'd felt at the moment he'd impregnated the boy was unmistakable (he'd also verified it with research in the Restricted Section).
"You can't say you don't want another go at him. I lost count at how many people had him and here he is, arsehole tight as a virgin again! Fucking born for this, he was. You don't find
"You feel good this way too," Ginny whispered in his ear. "I've wanted to ride your cock since I was ten, you know, after I saw you on the train. You were the first person I touched myself to. Did you know how
He scanned the crowd until he saw Malfoy, hiding behind the door of a nearby half-open closet. Potter barely struggled as Zambini tugged him to it, Malfoy closing the door behind them, cutting off most of the lewd din filling the main room.
Potter turned to face Malfoy, gaze drawn immediately to the hard cock standing proudly from Malfoy’s well-tailored robes.
Hermione moaned and took that as a sign she wasn't doing too bad. She glanced over Luna to the witch group on the floor, watched the blonde between the redhead's legs working fingers into her lover's pussy.
A wolfish grin stretch across Cormac’s face as he eyed Ginny. “You know, Potter,” he turned back to Harry and clapped him on the shoulder, “you’re alright. Don’t wait up.” He gave Harry a saucy wink and a last, hearty whack on the shoulder then sauntered off in Ginny’s direction, slouching against the wall beside her.
ok?" It felt a little strange to touch someone else like this, to feel breasts filling your hands and not feel it on your own chest, to thumb hard at nipples and not quake because you couldn't feel it, could only hope you were doing it right.
Every time Ginny dropped down, her ass would half-squish Harry's balls. Harry's eyes rolled back. He twitched on the floor. He couldn't take much more of this, needed to come,
Lily's eyes stared back at him, desperate and wanting for him in a way Lily never had, not even when Severus had dosed her with a potion that made her so horny that she let him fuck her for
Smiling, tears in her own eyes, Luna rocked back and forth, building a slow, steady pace. She kissed Hermione then, lips tracing her lover's in a pace to match.
"Is this ok?" Very slowly, Luna's tongue slid over the hard nub, then circled it, lapping at it hard, then circling, circling, getting the material of her bra soaked with spit.
He didn’t open his eyes even as large hands manhandled him to lie on his back across a table, legs urged up. Harry, helpful to the last, held himself open, thighs spread wide to show off his slick hole, red with much use already.
"Uh-uh, Potter. You don't get to come just yet." Cormac reached around with his wand (where Cormac had kept it, Harry didn't know) and cast a spell Harry didn't recognize but soon understood from the effects.
coming out with a new miracle cream or hair tonic. He’s kind enough to send me samples of his latest concoctions. Wish I knew how he came up with half his ideas, I personally struggle to come up with one new idea a decade!”—
Bits and pieces of strange, sultry things came to Harry at that, of a night of lust and deprivation with anyone who would have him. Including his professors.
Drawing a hand through Hermione's bushy hair, Luna grasped a handful of it, using it to guide her forward. "Please open your mouth, love."
Another finger slid in, working her apart, wider, and another joined it, all while Luna attended to Hermione's fat clit, keeping her wet and half-crazed with want. Luna's fingers slid in and out of Hermione's cunt with wet sounds that would have made Hermione blush with embarrassment had she been in her right mind.
"Y-yes." She'd tried playing with them before, when she touched herself, but having Luna do it was a thousand times better. She arched into that hand, moaning faintly when Luna pinched at her, twisting the hard nub a little.
Luna did lick at her, again and again, suckled her until Hermione thought she would lose her mind. Hermione threaded her fingers through Luna's silky blonde hair, keeping Luna exactly where she wanted her.
Harry bucked back against Zambini, wanting it, him, and every filthy thing the boy had said. "Please!"
"Almost there," Horace puffed. Sweat ran down his face and beaded all over his large nude body from the effort it took to work his cock in and out of Potter at such a quick pace. "The boy had an Orgasm Deprivation charm cast him, poor thing. All that fucking without being able to come, can you imagine?" Horace groaned at the thought, smiling, perhaps filing that idea away for use on a student or two. "Once I lifted the charm, he came like an uncorked champagne bottle! I just thought—" he stroked Potter's cock, precum dripping all over his first, — I thought the boy deserved to have another chance at a more—" Horace's thrusts got rougher, jarring Potter's body where he lay on the floor, "—
"I think you're going to try it anyway so why bother asking me?" Severus pulled out his own erection, stroking it absently as he watched the whale of a man rape their unconscious student.
Luna pressed feather soft kisses to Hermione's jaw, nibbling here and there as she made her way lower, lower...
Cormac thrust deep and came, pulling out to paint Harry's face in sticky cum that pretty much landed everywhere Harry couldn’t reach with his tongue.
A satisfied smirk lit Snape’s face. He withdrew from Harry, tucking himself away as he stepped back. Without a word, he left, abandoning Harry in search of some other prey.
Hermione had a different opinion on the matter. Harry suspected that part of her still wished it was
Sighing to himself, he abandoned their goblets on a nearby table and went in search of the buffet table.
was in that punch, but someone needs to nick the recipe from Slughorn.” Malfoy eyed Potter’s naked body, his dripping cock.
Harry arched awkwardly into the pain. It edged him closer to nowhere, any orgasm cut off by the spell Cormac had hobbled him with.
"Trust me. If all that cum doesn't end up in his mouth or his ass, it'll make him sad. I know how he is."

in Zambini. He needed to have that ass again. Gone was the teasing pace Zambini had used before. Now, he fucked Potter in powerful thrusts, burying himself to the hilt, in and out again as fast as he could manage. His bruising grip wasn’t enough to keep Potter in place. The frantic claiming drove Potter forward, practically into Malfoy’s lap.
She pulled her hands away from Luna, suddenly very unsure despite the throb in her own loins that begged for
that's hot," Luna panted, watching Hermione pleasure them both. She carded a hand through Hermione's hair, subtly urging her to a faster pace. Luna pinched at one of her own nipples, twisting
Covered in sweat and cum, Potter watched Severus fora long moment before lifting and spreading his legs in invitation, holding them wide with his hands. The boy's pretty green eyes — Lily's eyes — were glazed, a side effect from the potion driving his arousal up exponentially. His arsehole was red and puffy from overuse and cum slowly oozed from it, sliding down those pert ass cheeks.
“Oh I fucked him alright.” Malfoy skimmed his hand across the stretch marks on Harry’s belly, feeling the insistent prodding of Zambini’s cock battering at Potter’s insides. “Had him on the train after I caught him listening in on us. Sneaky little spy.” He fisted a hand in Potter’s unruly mop of hair, yanking the Gryffindor’s head back to further expose Potter’s throat. “Isn’t that right, Potter?” Malfoy lunged, biting at that pristine, fragile skin, marking it up with purple hickeys that stood out on Potter’s pale skin.
Ginny dragged him into a possessive kiss, slowing her pace down to a frustrating rock of her hips, barely moving at all. "Why fuck Harry when you have me?"
Sliding down a little further in the chair brought Malfoy’s cock well enough in reach. Potter engulfed him, wet heat and sloppy tongue swipes, his technique completely gone as Zambini fucked him silly, Potter’s eyes rolling up and back as he came again without a hand on his cock, spit-roasted by the Slytherin pair.
“Um, Mr. Potter?” Corny cocked her head, trying to catch his eye. “Are you alright? You look a bit faint.”
Whether it was the punch or just a kink Potter had, the Gryffindor took Malfoy all the way down to the root and groaned, throat working Malfoy in ways that Pansy had yet to achieve.
"He has no gag reflex, Gin. Look!" Cormac stilled, deep at can be. Harry laved what he could reach with his tongue, clearly not in any distress at all. "
“There you are, Harry, m’ boy!” Slughorn boomed in his ear, slurring just a bit. “Come along now, I’ve so many fine people simply dying to meet you.”
"You'll do no such thing of you want to keep that prick," Ginny snarled at him. "You fucked him once when you shouldn't have fucked him at all!"
that the whole escapade was making Harry’s head swim. Faces and names blurred, almost instantly forgotten, as were their little claims to fame.
Potter nodded frantically, eyes rolling back into his skull. Severus was unsurprised when, moments later, the boy came on his cock, untouched.
Luna's lips grazed Hermione's nipple through her bra, drawing her attention away from the women with a jolt.
"That's good," Luna whispered. "A little more? You can always stroke what you can't reach with your hand. A little tighter— that's it..." She groaned as Hermione took her advice, getting eager as she pleasured Luna. "That's it..."
Hermione gasped as the flimsy material was drawn away from her hot center, leaving her exposed, wanting, and so very wet. Instinct made her spread her legs, knees drawn up so that her feet were flat on the stone floor. It wasn't comfortable, but Hermione was past caring about anything that didn't involve Luna inside of her.
Harry turned to see Cormac McLaggen bearing down on him through the throngs of writhing bodies. The man had a beautiful cock, thick and hard and bouncing with every step he made towards Harry.
Emboldened, Hermione's hands moved from their place at Luna's waist up to Luna's small breasts. "Is- is
It was lucky Luna was half on top of her, holding her down because Hermione bucked at that first touch and kept trying to follow that tongue. "Fuck, Luna, please do that again!" That was better than fingers any day.
"I wanna fuck his mouth." Cormac stared at Harry, licking his lips at the thought of being buried in that throat, feeling Potter gag around his massive cock.
dedicated efforts to make the entire room acquainted with him) stood at his shoulder. She was dark skinned and very pretty, her hair charmed to levitate in elaborate curls that moved when she did but as if they were in water.
A large hand wrapped around his waist, holding him fast, leaving him little choice but to be frog-marched all around the room, hardly walking more than a few feet before being introduced to this accomplished witch or that interesting wizard. Lucky him, they all were “simply
The room was stifling. Dazed, Hermione glanced passed Luna's blonde hair to the orgy around her. Most people had stripped of their clothes entirely.
A goblet was pushed into his hand and Harry drank without question, happy to lose himself to whatever aphrodisiac it contained.
Ever since the Gryffindor victory party, Ron had been literally hip-deep in Lavender Brown as often as he could manage, it seemed. The number of times Harry had walked in on Ron driving his cock as deep as humanly possible into Lavender’s cunt was unreal.
Hermione could do little more than clutch desperately at Luna, overwhelmed by the pain-pleasure at her breast, by the feel of something, some
“However,” Harry said, a plan taking shape in his mind. “I do believe Ginny just became available.” -though when wasn’t she?- “A strapping guy like you might just be the thing to cheer her up.” He nodded over Cormac’s shoulder.
"Oh!" Ginny's cunt squeezed around Harry as she came, rocking his cock deep inside her, soaking his pubic hair with her cum. Panting, she leaned down to press the softest kiss to his lips. "Thanks for the ride," she grinned. "But if you think you've earned the right to come, you're mistaken." With that, she pulled off his turgid length and dismounted.
because Ginny had him between a rock and a hard place, threatening to tell her mother about Harry's exploits with Arthur, Fred, and George unless Harry left every Gryffindor cock to her.
He palmed Ginny's tits, loving how they felt in his hand, so soft and heavy, jiggling every time he fucked into Ginny's cunt. As good as Cormac felt, he was also wound up, like a coiled spring, and yet oddly...high, almost outside himself, like he was experiencing everything from two different views. It was strange.
"I do if you want to keep your knob." Ginny glared, her hips slamming down almost violently, taking him hard.
, but Harry wasn’t really calling the shots here. Between the punch and being pinned in place by Cormac, Harry’s reticence in fucking his almost-sister was overridden, stimulation doing the rest of the work. Harry rocked forward and back as best he could, trying to fuck himself on Ginny and Cormac, but Cormac had a steel grip on his hips, controlling where Harry was to the point Harry nearly went mad with it.
Watching Potter come undone just from sucking cock and then licking cum off the floor had brought out a

Perhaps, if the boy was good, Severus would show him the pictures he’d taken during those blissful hours, compare the boy's flexibility with his mother's, see how many of those same positions they could match.
“This is Tilda Basherton, the Prophet’s lead reporter, always on the hunt for a good scoop, am I righ’, Tilda? This one is taken, I’m afraid!” Slughorn gave Harry a rough shake that made his glasses go a bit askew. Slughorn chortled at his own (terrible) joke, sloshing his goblet full of ‘punch’. “Though I

A pair of shapely feet stopped in front of Harry. He looked up, unsurprised to find Ginny standing there, arms crossed, watching Cormac rape him.
A touch at her entrance startled Hermione, but she soon settled, relaxing into the finger carefully sliding in and out, delving farther every time. The finger curled, rubbed hard at the sensitive tissue behind her pelvic bone and Hermione groaned low, hips rocking up into the touch.

amount of time, Harry slid off the table. He couldn't think clearly past the need for sex. He needed to be filled. Needed something to fill this gnawing emptiness inside him.
Cormac slid deeper, tip against the back of Harry's throat. Harry swallowed around him coaxing him deeper, deeper...
Luna’s “Hello Hermione” was the only warning Harry got before arms wrapped around his neck and shoulders from behind, nearly throttling him. “He is driving me
Harry squirmed at the thought, wincing slightly at the stiffness in his lower back, noticing how sore his cock and arsehole felt.
Harry staggered out of the closet, nude and shaking. His body was streaked with cum. It ran down his legs, matted tellingly in his dark hair, smudged up his glasses, and had dried in itchy patches on his face.
Hermione took a swig from her own goblet and promptly choked on it. “Oh no,” she groaned, staring over Harry’s shoulder. “He’s coming this way. Come with me, love. Here—” she carefully took Luna’s goblet away from her lips, absently brushing at a stray drop rolling down Luna’s chin. “Harry, I’m sorry, but could you deal with Cormac? Please?”
having you touch me. I've thought about it..." She hummed faintly, eyes fluttering. "I just wonder..." Luna took one of Hermione's hands, pressing it to her erect cock, urging her to rub it through Luna's robes. "I just wonder..." she panted faintly as she pressed her other hand to Hermione's groin, palming her clothed sex, forcing a whimper from Hermione's lips, "if it's something that
, re-claimed tonight with his seed — and however many more times it took before the slut carried it to term, forever bound to Severus Snape. A thought occurred to him (not for the first time) that perhaps Lily bore Severus's seed instead of Potter's. Who was to say if she aborted what Severus spent hours (and various positions) putting inside her?
Potter pulled off of Malfoy’s cock with a gasp, back arching, coming completely untouched all over himself and the floor.
Finally, Horace crawled away from between the boy's skinny legs to collapse on his back, body heaving as he struggled for breath. "You have a go, Severus," he graciously offered, clearly in no position to do so himself, raging erection aside.
He had no idea how much time passed after Ginny and Cormac took their leave. He was vaguely aware of his surroundings.
Feeling more confident, Hermione took the tip into her mouth, suckling it, lapping at the tip like she would a lollipop.
Then Hermione flushed. She was a terrible person. Luna didn't want to have a penis. It was just something she was stuck with. And here Hermione was, happy that her lover
Together they manhandled Harry off Ginny and onto his back, uncaring that Harry was more or less limp and crying. Ginny straddled him, forcing his cock back inside her. She rocked and bounced, her head thrown back.
He lolled his head back, relaxing in the huge armchair he and Ginny had claimed, watching students and graduates having a good time. He blinked a few times when his eyes landed on Potter. Zambini had him pressed against a wall, the tall black boy whispering something into Potter's ear that had him flushed and squirming against the cage of the Slytherin's body, pushing back onto that big black cock.
Harry knew he was getting loud, begging for it, begging for the man to make him cum, to never stop fucking him. His own cock slapped against his belly, leaking, needing to be touched (Harry didn’t dare to).
Harry seized as orgasm took him, blinded by wave after wave of the pleasure that had been denied him, cum streaking his chest and belly.
Time lost meaning. There was only unfulfilled need and the freedom that came with servicing others with his body.
“I actually have a bone to pick with you about that,” Sarah said suddenly, turning to face the twins. “You need to stop selling those love potions. One of them was the cause of this entire thing.”
When Harry still didn’t make any comment, Draco waved a hand and said, “Well, if that’s what you want, I’ll be in the library.”
Sarah smiled back. “I am of the personal opinion that werewolves are still humans and should be treated as such,” she said nonchalantly. “There was no reason for Snape to assign us an essay on how to
Draco swallowed and murmured the spell, turning his head away as the headmaster’s wand flew over the edge of the tower, tumbling away into the night. Before either of them could demand an explanation, footsteps thundered up the stairs and Lyra’s heart stopped as a group of Death Eaters appeared, all leering at Dumbledore.
“Well…I guess we should put our things away,” suggested Hermione. “Let’s meet in the dining room to discuss what we know.”
Their group each grabbed one of the purple sleeping bags that Dumbledore had conjured before leaving, and hurried to a far corner, away from listening ears.
Lyra nodded absently again and Draco frowned. It wasn’t like her to not have an opinion on things like this, especially when it was her boyfriend they were talking about.
“He’s ‘the Boy Who Lived’ again now, though, isn’t he?” said Ron darkly. “Not such a show-off maniac anymore, eh?”
“ – and Sarah passes to the Gryffindor chaser!” Lee shouted. “And shoots her own House quite a rude gesture – I always knew I liked that girl. It looks like even the Slytherin players aren’t liking the song that much – Deaumont and Malfoy don’t look too impressed.” Lee was trying to drown out the sound of the singing. “Come on now, Angelina – looks like she’s got the Keeper to beat! – SHE SHOOTS – SHE – aaaah…”
“Don’t worry, Dad,” said Fred gleefully, “we’ve got big plans for this money. We don’t want it confiscated.”
“Thank you for trying to drop a chandelier on Bellatrix,” Sarah said softly. “Even though it was one of my personal favourites.”
“I just told you,” Sarah said evenly. “I was feeling ill. I suddenly felt nauseous and asked if we could stop quickly at a bathroom. That was when we stumbled upon Mrs Norris and the writing.”
“That old man is getting more and more annoying each year,” Sarah stated dryly. Both boys nodded in agreement. “Well, I’m glad you’re back Harry but I’m going to bed,” Sarah said, pressing kisses to both their cheeks. “Don’t stay up too late.” She disappeared up the stairs.
Sarah couldn’t help but be disgusted by the actions of the Minister. The man who was meant to be in charge of the entire Ministry was stupid enough to actually believe bringing a dementor to an interrogation of an Azkaban escapee was a bright idea? She thought that maybe the bowler hat he always wore was maybe one or two sizes too small for his head and constricted the blood flow to logical thinking.
“We’ll dake her wid us,” said Neville firmly. “I’ll carry her – you’re bedder at fighding dem dan I ab – “
They put up the tent and retreated inside it, where Ron made them tea. After their narrow escape, the chill, musty old place felt like home, safe, familiar and friendly.
“Yes,” agreed Harry, curling himself against Draco’s side after they had pulled on their pyjama bottoms. “But you still keep me around.”
Sarah looked around. For one bewildering moment, she thought Ron had left the tent, then realised that Ron was lying in the shadow of a lower bunk, looking stony.
Sirius looked as if he were tempting to join in the wrestling match but Remus looked at him sharply. Sarah tutted and dragged Draco up by his collar, pulling him bodily off Harry.
His voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest chair. Hermione’s face was wet with tears and Ron was almost as pale as Aberforth. Draco had Sarah’s hand in a death grip as she looked at Harry’s ill expression.
“But don’t you think that if it was, Dumbledore would have told me about it before he died?” countered Harry.
“What’s the Slytherin common room like? Is it true you went into the Forbidden Forest? Are you really friends with Harry Potter? What’s he like?” Ginny barely drew breath before Ron finally shouted at her to shut up.
Harry looked at him in trepidation. Ron wasn’t one to have heart-to-heart conversations unless it was really serious. Unfortunately, his freckled face wasn’t giving anything away.
“Honestly, Harry, you used to be interesting,” the twin said – for Draco was sure he was the surviving twin.
“Oooh yum!” Sarah said in delight, choosing to dismiss Draco’s odd behaviour. “Amanda gave me these at the Leaky Cauldron.” She eagerly grabbed one while Draco passed one to Harry.
“So,” she started, sitting down next to Harry and looking at him pointedly. “Want to tell me what’s going?”
“What up, fuckers,” she announced as she fell into the seat beside Draco. She reached forward for a jug of orange juice. “Why do you all look like the Paris-made chocolates you love were discontinued?”
When she finally stumbled through the fireplace, she raced upstairs, ignoring the worried looks she got and threw herself into the room she shared with Draco. She collapsed on her bed and released all the tears and fear she had kept contained since her interaction with her father.
“You just don’t want to hex your boyfriend,” she said with a smile, raising her wand. “At least let me hex you first.”
Snape stood there, seething, staring from Fudge, who looked thoroughly shocked at his behaviour, to Dumbledore, whose eyes were twinkling behind his glasses. Snape whirled about, robes swishing behind him, and stormed out of the ward.
Now, Sarah sat on a bench holding tightly to Fred’s hand, watching as they moved Voldemort’s boy and laid it in a chamber off the Hall, away from the bodies of George, Tonks, Colin Creevey and fifty others who had died fighting for them. McGonagall had replaced the house tables, but nobody was sitting according to houses any more: all were jumbled together, teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and house-elves, and Firenze lay recovering in a corner, and Grawp peered in through a smashed window, and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth.
