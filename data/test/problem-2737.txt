“It’s alright. I’m not usually this emotional.” Harkin whispered. “It’s understandable that you would all be a little shocked at my outburst.”
“Well, did you know that Draco does? He’s always been able to absorb information, and I think you might have somehow gained it from this bond. It would explain how you just explained that to me like you were an expert.”
Draco brought the piece of parchment over and said, “Alright, I want to know which of these spells,” Draco pointed to the ones that the St. Mungos employees cast on Harry. “Will conflict with these spells,” Draco pointed to the spells that needed to be cast, “And replacement spells that would work in the same capacity as these spells that would work with these spells.” Draco said as he pointed back to the ones used at St. Mungos.
Draco started the shower, and he stepped inside then closed the door and set Harry down. Harry switched on the hot water, and she started getting her hair wet. Draco did the same as he stepped behind her, and she chuckled.
“Draco, they will find him, and you will be safe again.” Melody tried.
“Alright.” Harry whispered a little shyly, and Draco brushed his fingers through her hair.
“Yeah, I’m fine just a little surprised that he actually blew my door off the hinges.”
“Harry, yes,” Draco hissed. Harry thrusted his fingers into Draco causing Draco to moan into Harry’s lips, and Harry moaned as a cause to Draco’s moan vibrating through Harry’s mouth. Draco pulled away and looked Harry in the eyes. “Harry, please. I need you to get inside of me. Now!” Draco moved his hand behind him and pulled Harry’s hand out of him and then he wrapped his legs around Harry’s hips as Harry guided himself into Draco’s entrance. As Harry pushed himself into Draco’s entrance Draco let out a silent scream.
Nott had her back in his arms and on the bed before she could even react. “That’s it. Punishment time.” Nott had his wand pointed at her, and he shouted, “Crucio.” Harry felt the pain immediately and couldn’t hold back the scream as her back arched, and the pain raked her body. As soon as it was there it was gone, and she fell back into a heap on the bed.
Harry picked up the little boy and crawled into bed and slowly falling asleep. The next morning when he woke up, Harry was having his hair pulled on by Teddy. “Hey, little man. What time is it?” Harry looked at the clock on his bedside table, and saw that it was 10 o’clock. Harry climbed out of bed pulling Teddy with him. Harry put Teddy in his crib and walked over to his wardrobe pulling out one of the few outfits that he had left in his wardrobe, after the war Harry went out and bought a brand new wardrobe since he didn’t have that many clothes left after the war.
“Severus?” Lucius questioned his friend.
The group stepped off the train and towards the carriages, when they bumped into the Weasley’s. “Hey, watch it…” Ron said as Draco ran into him, because he was paying attention to Harkin and not to where he was going. Oh, it’s you. Stealing all of my friends now?” he accused.
“Bloody Hell!” Harry shouted as his back arched off the bed.
“I just need to check something, because there is no way that you should know about Grimmauld Place, because Dumbledore is secret keeper, and as far as I know, no one has taken the Fidelius Charm off the place. Do you see the problem with you knowing where I was, exactly where I was?” Harkin stated.
“What? Do I have something on my face?” Harry asked as he started wiping his face.
“I don’t need any information from you, Draco to help you, and I don’t need you to put your mother’s and your own life in danger if you do so. I will help you and your mother but I don’t need the information you want to give, because I already have more information than you could give me.” Draco’s mind was spinning, and he didn’t know how he could have any of the information that Draco could have to offer.
“Draco, where we are going your father isn’t going to find us I promise. He won’t think to look for us where we are going. He is never going to see you or Harry again. He can ruin his life, but he will not bring my boys down with him. Your father made me a promise 15 almost 16 years ago and he broke that promise to me, and for that he never gets to see his son again.” Narcissa said as she sat down on the bed in the boys’ room. “I just want you two to have a better holiday than what has played out so far and Lucius can’t ruin it. He can’t ruin it, because your father isn’t going to be in our lives anymore, and I am not allowing him to ruin something that he isn’t a part of. Draco, your father told me about the thing that he wanted you to do, and I can’t allow him to see or talk to you ever again. He got himself into something, and he wanted to drag you down with him, Draco, and I couldn’t allow him to drag you into this, Draco. You’re my son and you aren’t getting involved in this. Ever!” Narcissa stated. She was almost in tears, and Draco walked over and wrapped his arms around his mother.
“I am courting Harry, Granger. Small words work better for you.” Draco said which got him an elbow in the ribs from Harry. “Sorry.”
“It’s a special one. You can’t leave my side until I let you leave. Now, you do look magnificent.”
“You aren't eating, love.” Draco whispered into her ear, and she turned and glared at him.
“I understand, Harry. Do you mind taking Teddy quick, the little man is getting rather heavy?” Harry took the sleeping Teddy from her arms, and he settled him on his hip. “If you want my opinion, Harry. I think you should go. If not for you, do it for Teddy. He is going to need you and me now more than ever and I won’t be able to get a job. You need to raise him right, for Dora and Remus.” Andromeda stepped inside and shut the door behind her. “I will send you pictures of any moment that you might miss. I would want you here to see them, but I think your schooling is more important right now, Harry. But that’s just my opinion. If you could take him up to his room, I’m going to go and have a lie down myself. The little tike is getting more and more mobile for a nine month old.”
“I may have eaten enough for both of us, but you are feeding two more people, so eat.” Draco retorted, and the table went dead silent. “What you will laugh at her jab but not mine?” Draco questioned the table.
“So, you stopped with the concealment charm?” Theo asked.
“His hand that was what happened to his hand.” Harry whispered and everyone looked over to Harry.
“I just punched my best friend in the face for you Slytherin’s. I wouldn’t judge me too harshly, Parkinson.” Harkin stated with a sideways glance at Pansy.
“You left the sword didn’t you? We had Phineas Nigellus Black in Hermione’s bag.”
“I know, but you got to think how hard it is for me to be back. I’ve had the worst past two years here and now I’m back after all that I’ve done and everyone is looking at me differently. I just want what I did to be forgotten, because I just did it to save myself and the people I care about.” Draco said and then buried his face in Harry’s shoulder. Harry smiled, and he brought his one hand up and laced his fingers in Draco’s hair and leaned his forehead against the side of Draco’s head.
“How did you get in here? No one even knows this place exists with the Fidelius Charm placed on the house.”
“Miss Potter, it is good to see you. I see you are adjusting well after your accident. How have you been?”
“Shit.” Draco muttered under his breath.
“Unfortunately. Thank you, Mel for everything.” Harkin stated.
“Bloody Hell!” Pansy exclaimed as she snagged Harkin’s hand to get a better look at the ring. “I’m kind of upset about breaking that marriage contract with you, but I couldn’t handle making babies with my best friend.”
“Hermione, that maybe how it is in the muggle world, but in the wizarding world, we’re still a little old school with our laws. For Draco to be able to claim the children as his heir Draco and Harkin have to be married before they are born. It would be different if he were making a will and didn’t have an heir. Say Sirius died, he could leave everything to Harkin because she’s his goddaughter, though he would probably have to change it now that Harry changed her name legally.” Remus explained.
“D-Dray…ah…I-I’m c-close.” Draco slid his hands up her back and pulled her arms to pin them on either side of her head where he intertwined their fingers. He captured her lips as he came and she came soon after. They were panting in each other’s ears, and Draco slowly pulled out and slid to the side pulling Harry with him. Harry was now curled against his chest with his arms wrapped around her with their legs entwined together. Draco reached down and pulled the sheets over them, and Harry moaned into his side.
“Hey, Kiddo. Do you want something for breakfast?” the little boy wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and buried his face in Harry’s shoulder. “What’s the matter, kiddo?” Harry asked as he picked up his wand and slipped it into his pajama pocket. He walked out of the room and across the hall to Andromeda’s room. “Hey, Annie. I’m going to make breakfast, are you up yet?” Harry asked as he knocked on the door, but there was no answer. “Annie?” Harry tried again, but there was still no answer. She was never up before Teddy and Harry, so Harry opened the door to find the room empty.
“What Draco has or hasn’t done isn’t your concern, though what the Malfoy’s do to you when they find out you have me is.” Harkin stated.
“I don’t know, because you couldn’t get into the common room but an elf would be able to.” Ron said, and Draco had to admit it was pretty sound logic, especially for Ron. That was when McGonagall and Dumbledore walked up.
“Understood.” Draco said and Harry nodded.
“I’m sorry”? Draco questioned.
“Have you heard the rumors about your house? Merlin, to a scared little kid who just wanted to disappear and blend in you think they wouldn’t be scared of turning evil.” Harkin said with a chuckle. “There are a few reasons Slytherin’s consist of mostly purebloods and a few half-bloods.”
“What just happened?” Ron asked.
“Draco won’t say anything, my dear…”
“I really don’t start the fight, I’m usually the one yelling. Once I get whatever it is out of my system I’m usually better. It’s usually better for everyone if they just let me vent, because once I get it out of my system I’ll most likely apologize because I realized whatever it was, was in fact my fault. But not always, just remember that.”
“A cupboard, dragon? They had her in a cupboard. That is unacceptable, I don’t care what a child did that is unacceptable.”
“You need to help her, and you can help her.”
“Draco, I am sorry. I can’t guarantee that nothing will happen to him. That’s just part of life. You should know that right away, Draco.”
“Shhh…everything is going to be alright.” Draco whispered as he held her against his chest. Narcissa and Lucius walked in to find them, and Lucius vanished the vomit as Narcissa walked over to Draco and Harry.
“Mr. Malfoy, what about your Blaise Zabini theory?”
“But what about Lucius or Draco, especially since I’m carrying the next generation of the Malfoy line.” Harkin stated.
“I do as well. Thank you.” Narcissa said as the floo sounded notifying Remus of the Aurors departure. “How much did you hear?”
“I think I might have heard about Thaddeus Nott escaping custody a few weeks ago, I thought yours mother would have told you, because your father escaped as well." Melody stated and Draco looked furious.
After class Harkin slowly put her things in her bag and waited for Hermione to approach them, and she did once the classroom was cleared out. Hermione hurried up to them, and she pulled Harkin from the room, with Draco trailing behind them. Hermione pulled Harkin into an abandoned classroom down the hall and waited for Draco to enter, before casting a locking and silencing spell. “What is going on? I can’t tell if you are scared or excited.” Harkin stated.
“What happened?” she asked.
“My father is in the hospital and you want to trust Harry on a hunch. What if someone else gets hurt or worse, killed.”
“Not as long as he apologizes for his involvement in Harry’s kidnapping. Theo has been a great friend, it’s his father I have a problem with.” Draco stated as they heard a crash, and Draco was running towards the nook where the noise came from.
“Shall I get back to the explanation?” Narcissa asked, and Sirius pulled a chair around to sit in and then pulled Harkin into his lap.
“Let me help. Weasley, did you see the elf at all?”
“I wish to discuss something that some of us may know about while others do not, and I want to bring it to everyone’s attention especially as we talk about the future placement of Harry Potter.”
She looked in the mirror and stood in astonishment. She looked like someone out of a magazine or royal family or not her. She’d gotten used to the skinny jeans and blouses but this dress actually made her realize she’s a girl now. Then the bathroom door opened and there stood Narcissa Malfoy, and she stopped and closed the door before Nagini could slither in.
“I had somehow accidentally made Potter a Horcrux. It would be damaging to myself if anything happened to her. I am moving her soon. I will convene a meeting when we are settled. You may leave.” Lucius and Severus bowed before leaving the room, and Voldemort escorted Harry back up to her room where he placed the charm back on Harry and Nagini so Harry couldn’t be out of a 15 feet radius of the snake. “
“Give it to Granger she has the means to destroy it.”
“Putting me under a sleeping spell to snuggle with my naked body. You know, I sleep like a rock right? You would probably be able to crawl in my bed while I was sleeping and I wouldn’t notice. You make a noise though and I’ll be awake in a heat beat.” Harry stated as he leaned in closer to Draco.
“Mum, where is this going?” Draco interrupted.
“Yes, I think I’ll survive; I’m not so sure about Draco, though.” Harry joked, and Narcissa started laughing this musical laugh.
“Rowena’s daughter?”
You killed Voldemort?” Granger asked with disbelief. “How do we even know you are telling the truth? For all we know he’s not even here.”
“Sorry, love.” Draco whispered as he held her against his chest, and he kissed the top of her head.
“No, I don’t. Where’d you get it from, Rodolphus?”
“Nothing. It’s not that hard to calm someone when they feel safe. No one can get to him here unless I say so. Not past the wards or even around the manor. He is safe, and he knows I won’t let anyone past me, unless I am absolutely certain he is safe.”
"I am no better."
The blond cocked an eyebrow. "You?"
The Weasleys, their respective spouses, and the 'honorary' Weasleys had gathered there for a Christmas feast, as they did annually. In years prior, Harry Potter had enjoyed these meals. To gorge oneself within the company of one's best friends, illegitimate family, and ex-girlfriend? It was more than Harry would ever have dared dream of as a child. The moments spent in said company had been unimaginable to his nine-year-old self, who had spent most of his holidays in his 'room' under the stairs and most of the 'family' gatherings upstairs in the attic, pretending not to exist. The food left out for him had been meagre portions of leftover bread.
"Yo-you saw that...? But you weren't even home!" Harry nearly knocked his food onto the floor. Luckily, he didn't. Hermione would have taken his head for such an offense as she'd chosen the carpet herself.
Reflexively, Harry turned to comfort her, but Ginny was already angrily brushing her tears away.
"Oi! I said I was fine with it. Don't push it, mate," Ron interrupted, having shoved half of a chicken in his mouth by this point.
*a few months after the war*
Harry nodded without hesitation or doubt. "Yes, Mr. Weasley. Draco Malfoy. But trust me, he is nothing like his father. He got the mark because he had no other option," Harry explained. He continued earnestly, "I really like him. And you and Mrs. Weasley's opinions are the ones that matter most to me. Please, Mr. Weasley, he really has changed. I swear by the name of Merlin."
And, finally, no copyright violations were intended. Nothing belongs to me.
Once they'd pushed their petty school rivalry aside, the two had even grown friendly with one another. It was practically impossible to separate them–not that anyone in the Auror Department wanted to. Their record was pristine, so much so that it had already been decided that they'd remain partners after graduating training. An office with "Auror H. Potter" and "Auror D. Malfoy" emblazoned across the door had been made a certainty for them.
"That's easy for you to say. You're the Golden Boy of the war. Everybody loves you," Draco said darkly, borderline disgustedly. "I'm an abomination. Everybody hates my guts. Nobody ever believes me." He was bitter.
"Is there something more you need to say, Harry?" Hermione asked, simultaneously swatting Ron's hand away from her own meal. Ron hissed at her and stole a few scraps of food from Harry's plate.
*a day before Draco meets Harry's Family.*
They returned to the Ministry of Magic victorious. It had been their most successful capture to date. Harry had gone to their office/record room to take care of the extensive paperwork which generally came along as a tedious part of any on-field mission. It was a room he shared with Draco and another pair of Auror trainees, but at the time, it was empty. Empty, that is, save for the desks, file cabinets, and all the Merlin-damned parchment.
Ron, the capital fellow that he was, tried feebly for a distraction..."The weirdest customer came in yesterday asking for..."
"But what's wrong with me? Did I do something?" Ginny muttered to him, her fists clenched on either side of her plate. Her food was untouched. Harry wanted to throw up or run away. Or both. Harry forced his gaze onto her face, and he saw that her eyes were damp. Ginny stared back, her nose scrunched up, her face flushed with the effort to keep quiet. Harry noticed how beautiful the freckles on her nose looked against her milky skin. And in that moment, he wished that things were different and everything was normal again. "Where did we go wrong? Harry, you need to tell me… I still love you." Harry did not reply. He could not.
Ron gave a small scoff. "I'm Ron Weasley, and I'm chummy with him. Trust me: my family's a lot more lenient than you seem to believe. Bill doesn't really care who you end up with, so long as you're happy. Dad, Charlie, and George would be thrilled," he said, gesturing a bit with his bottle as he spoke. "Mum will probably need some time, but she'll come around. Ginny will too."
Arthur's face regained the mirthful glow Harry had grown accustomed to over the years. "I just want my sons to be happy. If he makes you happy, then, Harry, you have my blessings," said Arthur with finality.
"Yeah, Harry, is something bothering you?" Hermione added in her most motherly tone.
The words really did spill of Malfoys actual mouth Harry realises and he feels his jaws drop open. What! It's lucky that Malfoy's back is turned and he seems to think whatever he said was just the common,  casual and aisinne thing you say to you magical muscle injury healer, because Harry is sure his face had been honestly, uncharacteristically  embarrassed. And open.  And like what just happened?
The Weasleys attempted to make normal conversation. So they ignored the telltale signs of a relationship falling apart and talked about Bathilda Bagshot's granddaughter who had recently joined the Department of Muggle and Magical Cooperation. Harry looked at Hermione and found her staring back with her big, brown eyes filled with concern. Of all that the magical world had given him, he realized that he appreciated Hermione the most.
Then, for the second time in under twenty-four hours, Draco received another slap to the face. He barely had time to bulge his eyes in shock before Harry had him hoisted into the air by his collar.
Harry blinked, mouth dry, heart in his throat. "Ah, what? Wait, you knew? Oh." It felt anticlimactic. Harry almost felt cheated in a way. He'd heard plenty of heartfelt and dramatic coming-out stories. They'd involved tears, shouting, hugs, and understanding. Not just "tell us something new" and chicken.
That is, until Harry just couldn't wait any longer–as was his nature–and decided to tell Ron and Hermione all about it. What's bound to happen will happen anyway, he reassured himself.
By the way, if you are wondering, as to what exactly happened to Draco, and his "acceptance", well, it went in the most clichéd way possible. If you ask anybody who remembers the whole evening on excruciating details, it was probably stiff and awkward and pretty much a success. Hey! In their defence, it was six years back.
Draco climbed without complaint into Harry's arms before muttering a quick charm to dim the lights. Harry looked down at him and marvelled at the situation. It had him awestruck every time. For the millionth time, he wondered: was he living or dreaming?
And he sounded tired. Draco had reached the end of his spiel, and it had left him empty and exhausted. Harry chewed his lower lip, wondering what he could possibly say to console his partner.
George gave a wee snort. "Why, he's the one who first pointed out the palpable sexual tension that you and that Malfoy spawn shared in your fifth year..." At this, Bill punched him in the arm, and George fell on the floor and began accusing Bill of attempted homicide in dramatic detail. This was the background noise for the rest of the afternoon.
Draco came around and sat beside Harry without speaking. They ate in silence, and Draco stood up, looking a bit unsure. He dropped a small note on the table and left without saying goodbye. Harry watched him, discreetly but intensely. When he was out of sight, Harry scooped up the note and unfolded it.
Harry sighed and then turned his face to Ginny's. He carefully studied her pale face and bright eyes, and finally said, "I don't think I can do that yet. You know, Gin, they need me." Ginny frowned at this, and Harry quickly elaborated, "I mean, those people died because I wasn't fast enough. I think the least I can do is honour the reason they died. Or even testifying... Those bastards need to be in Azkaban as soon as possible, right? Don't you think?"
Harry got to class and heaved a physical sigh of relief when he saw that Draco was there, jaw set and attention focused fully–almost forcefully–on what the professor was saying. Harry situated himself in the back of the hall and tried to focus as intently upon the Observations professor as Draco.
The smile slipped off of Draco's face when he saw Harry's unimpressed expression. "I see what you're trying to do," Harry began, "but it's not helping. I'm positively pissed." He couldn't help but admire the irony of the situation: his distraught, suicidal partner was the one trying to lighten the mood.
Author's note: A huge thanks to all of you! And, once more to my betas and WG; you know how much you have contributed to this story. Thanks.
"Rr-ight. Why didn't you tell me, and… and you're all okay with it?" Harry demanded, still befuddled. He supposed it wasn't fair of him to assume his friends would naturally be vastly more immature than him,especially considering Hermione's history of open-mindedness. But, still.
Why? Why, why, why didn't he save this for after the meal? Harry gulped. Although Ginny was very obviously trying to keep her voice down, to keep herself from causing a scene, her family had caught onto the tension between her and Harry. They watched on concernedly, awkwardly. Only Ron and Hermione–the only ones who were privy to Harry's "little secret"-looked on with sympathy.
“No, Minerva, I don’t believe it has.” Madam Pomfrey answered, and they both turned to look at Harry.
“I’m glad you’re all safe.” Draco whispered.
“Definitely…” Harry wrapped her legs around Draco, and Draco’s lips found their way down to her collarbone and then to her breasts where they started sucking on the skin there. One of Draco’s hands found its way to her other breast and started playing with her nipple and she moaned out loud. “Dray…that’s…amazing.” She panted, and Draco switched, and his free hand slide down between her legs and one finger played with her clitoris before sliding inside her. Her legs fell open away from Draco’s body giving him better access and he pushed another finger inside her. Harry released this gasped moan, and she could feel Draco smirk against her skin. “Dray, please.” She pleaded, and he slipped another finger inside her. “No. No more fingers.” Harry whispered, “I want you inside me…please.” Draco pulled his fingers out of her and placed the slicked up fingers on her hips while he pushed himself inside her, and Harry whimpered as he did it nice and slow for her.
“He blew up his aunt with wandless magic.”
“So we have to stop Ron and Hermione.”
Harry’s lips parted at the contact, and Draco slipped his tongue inside her mouth. Harry moaned into Draco’s mouth, and he slipped his hands up so they were resting just below Harry’s breasts. Draco brushed his thumbs underneath her bra and stroked the underside of her breasts, and Harry moaned. “Draco,” Harry panted as Draco pulled away slightly to breath.
“Harry, dear, if you are finished, would you mind coming with me.” Narcissa asked a few minutes later as she stood and held her hand out to Harry. Draco squeezed her thigh before he pulled away, and Harry pushed her chair away from the table and took Narcissa’s hand. Narcissa gave her hand a light squeeze as she pulled her from the dining room.
“Well, I am aware of the snake bit she received last week, and the flying accident. I also know about you bring worried she was pregnant, and Severus Snape has been sharing information about a potion he created specifically for Miss Potter.”
“Harkin Jamelynn Potter. It isn’t that much different than what my name is but this is more feminine.” Harry said, and Sirius relaxed a little bit.
“And more good will come, cub, but first Sirius needs to be exonerated, and to do that he needs to go away for a little while.” Remus stated as he brushed his fingers through her hair to calm her. Draco held her in his arms as Remus brushed his fingers through her long, wavy raven hair, and Harkin just cried. She eventually cried herself to sleep, and Draco stood up with her cradled in his arms.
“I’m sorry, it is just that is unacceptable to treat a child that way. I will let it go until she is ready to talk about it, but until then let’s play chess.” Narcissa said and the board appeared in front of them, and they started playing their game. Harry stayed curled up in Draco’s lap as they played, and Harry couldn’t tell who was winning. She hadn’t played since her second year when Ron realized she wasn’t that much of a competition, and she really fell out of practice.
“Malfoy, what in bloody hell is going on here?” Weasley tried to keep his voice level but it wasn’t working.
“You should try them some time. They are quieted affective.”
“I will do anything to help Harry.” Luna said.
“We’re still losing altitude. I don’t understand.” Draco whispered as he tried to pull up and brace their landing. They were inches off the ground, and Draco rolled the broom so he took most of the impact as they skidded across the ground. Draco felt his eyes flutter closed as he felt the pain erupt through him. He looked at Harry quickly, who was unconscious sprawled across his chest before the darkness took him.
“Oh, I'm sorry I woke you.” He whispered.
“But we both survived.” Harkin pointed out.
“Then he had one of his friends do it for him.” Draco chuckled again, and this time, Umbridge turned directly towards Draco and walked up to him. “Is something amusing, Mr. Malfoy?”
“Let’s just say that Severus Snape is a unique creature, Ms. Granger.” Narcissa stated. “Now, don’t leave this compartment until you reach Hogwarts. Understand?”
“What about, sir?” Harkin asked, and Severus pulled up another stool, and Harkin gave him a funny look.
“Really? Oh, love. Never mind then. I’ll just finish what I was doing before we get up and head downstairs.” Draco responded as his hands slipped between her legs, and his fingers inside her, and Harry gasped in surprise.
Harry screams as he twists his legs just right snapping Rodolphus’ neck. Harry released him, and he sagged to the floor. Harry dangled from the chains as the pain in his chest coursed through him, and Harry glanced down to see the sword piercing out of his chest, and Harry could start to taste blood in his mouth. Harry tried to break the chains, but all of his energy was draining from him, so he stopped struggling and just decided to hang there and wait for the Aurors to find him, hoping it didn’t take them forever.
“I am a Prefect, professor. I was just doing my rounds, sir.” Ron defended.
“I did some research, Miss Potter, and I found a solution to your problem. It was an easy potion to brew, and I didn’t see a problem occurring with Draco brewing it. My guess is that when the Dark Lord walked into the room in the middle of the magic it created an anomaly for the potion and magic, so it stripped him of his magic and flung him from the room leaving the two of you with more magic than expected. So this is not my fault Miss Potter, this is the Dark Lord’s fault, and since you and Draco have already stripped him of his magic. I don’t see why you need to punish him more. For everything else, I will be taking him to the Ministry later today. Meanwhile you two need to practice how to keep your magic in check. If it goes haywire at school we could have a problem. Especially, since it appears the temperature is affected by your magic.”
Lunch was an affair that Harry usually enjoyed with Draco and two other teams, but today he was alone. Unlike himself and Draco, the two pairs of trainees they usually ate with hadn't taken down their minor-league Death Eater as dexterously as they had. The four of them were presently lying in metal-frame beds at St Mungo's, one in particular being fed medication and nutrition paste through a tube in his anus while his oesophagus was magically reconstructed.
"Potter-" Draco began to object shrilly, but that was all he got out before Harry interrupted him.
But he pressed on. "Everyone else thinks I'm a hypocrite, and most of them want me dead. And all the whispers that follow me–all the calculated, evaluating looks... Merlin, I'm so tired of that," he rambled fervently. "What I can't tell them is that I wasn't given another option. I could have become the most cruel and absolute worst example of a wizard to save my mother. I would do anything for her. You don't know how difficult it was to shield my feelings." Draco paced and spoke with his hands as if he wasn't sure what to do with his body. "Occlumency of the most advanced kind was useless before the Dark Lord. You don't know how hard it was, Potter. You have no idea. The nightmares, the life that I live now, it just makes me so tired."
"So this is it?" Ginny asked her voice barely audible.
"Hey, come on. It'll all be just fine. They're good people," Harry whined in a vain attempt to reassure Draco, who had been pacing restlessly around the room for a solid six minutes. He was mentally preparing himself for their visit to the Burrow next day. A simple meal oughtn't to be a stressful affair for anyone, but Draco seemed quite adamant about not only making himself worry but making Harry feel jittery about it as well.
"Mate, I have eyes," said Ron, rolling said eyes. "I can actually see when he comes home to drop you off or when you disappear for those night assignments and return with hickeys instead of scars. I don't always need 'Mione to put two and two together for me. Although, technically, it was her who discovered you kissing Malfoy all over the patio."
Harry hummed a bit, then explained, "Well, George and I, we saw you at Fred's funeral."
Draco turned away abruptly, plunging his fists into his pockets and hunching over, dejected, pouting almost. It would have come off as childish if Harry hadn't known how important this was to Draco. And its importance to Draco made it important to Harry.
"So, 'Mione said you wanted to say something? Wassup, mate?" Ron asked, sipping his butterbeer and eyeing his chicken quite possessively. As their home was, as mentioned earlier, modest, the three of them couldn't always be bothered to eat in the kitchen. They'd taken their food into the considerably less-cramped sitting room, as was their custom.
Chapter Six
*two years after the war (Christmas) continued*
Soon they were walking the streets of Muggle London, the back alleys and winding streets that were rarely used for anything other than drug deals and pissing on the wall. The gloom sympathized with their moods. After a while, Harry felt inclined to ask, "How's your arm?"
"Harry,mate, you gotta see this. He killed Nagini without flinching, and look at him, reduced to that eleven-year-old just by the prospect of impending fatherhood," Ron said, all the while indicating Neville, who was pacing the halls of the maternity ward with an utterly confounded expression.
"Not here," pleaded Draco, forehead creasing. "I am really not in the mood to do this."
Hermione had thanked Draco for "finally making him see the importance of knocking" by giving him the largest serving of the aforementioned peace offering.
"Thanks," Draco said quietly, with a little sigh. They meandered on in silence, feeling strangely comforted by one another's company. Harry found himself repeatedly glancing at Draco. He wasn't sure why–no explanation he came up with in his head made sense. Harry sort of just... wanted to make sure Draco was still there.
"It shouldn't always be about you," Ginny said, darkly and defeated, intermittent sobs making appearances. She finally lay her head, against Harry's shoulders "I can't allow those nightmares to get to me–I need happy memories, Harry, don't you see? I want to cope by doing something that will make me happy. And you broke up with me because you thought I couldn't face a war. Guess what, Harry, didn't work. We were all pawns, and you have no idea, how bad it was. I don't want to feel that way anymore, and you have to help me Harry."
Arthur cleared his voice at the other end of the table, and Harry turned his attention to Arthur. He seemed a bit less forthcoming than his sons, with his hands folded businesslike on the tabletop. "Draco Malfoy? Are you sure about this, Harry?" inquired Arthur, concern in his voice. "Malfoy as in your arch-nemesis Malfoy? Lucius Malfoy's son?"
Maybe he would have liked to see Draco, but Harry told himself sternly that the blond was a grown-ass man. Also, he longed for the comfort of his own flat, so he began making his way to the loo. Harry's commute home was hardly the longest in the history of mankind, but he'd learned the hard way that it was a very foolish thing to try apparating with a full bladder.
"Oi! That was not necessary," Ron said indignantly, rubbing his noggin. He sighed. "Sorry. You were saying?"
Harry gave Draco a shit-eating grin and said, "Well, see, Drake, I can think of about seventeen different ways–off the top of my head–to spend the night in a better way..."
Harry choked on his butterbeer. A few pats on the back later, he replied, "H-how in the name of Merlin's pants did you know that?" His voice cracked unexpectedly on the last few syllables, and he flushed.
"Fun?" scoffed Harry, straightening up and turning away from his girlfriend. "Bollocks, are you? We just had a war, Gin. People died, our loved ones being a few of them. Hogwarts, the only place that was ever mine, is in shambles. The war changed all of us, Gin. And this entire thing has been the only part of my life which had been constant, however twisted that sounds. I don't even know what to do next or who I am or even what people expect me to do... And as far as I have figured things out, I need to be here, beside them." Harry finished, deflated.
Based on Harry and Draco's record, it wouldn't be. And if anyone had bothered to ask the Auror in charge of monitoring the trainees back at the Ministry, he would have vehemently denied wholly ignoring their trace. That particular Auror was known for a long and petty history of fibs.
Draco looked away and seemed to flinch as if the very sound of Harry's voice was harmful. Maybe he was just afraid he was going to get slapped in the face again. Whatever it was, he seemed to ignore it. "Potter," he responded. Awkwardly, he gestured down the road. "Would you like to walk?"
The look and the name earned Harry a half-glare-half-smile, which–though appreciated–clearly spelled a hell of a lot of trouble for Harry if the nickname ever went public.
As Harry trudged towards the Burrow, Ron gave a reassuring smile from his seat on the porch. He had two bottles of butterbeer on hand and handed one to Harry as the Boy-Who-Lived sat down beside him. "Hey, mate. That went better than I expected," said Ron in a lighthearted tone. He took a sip of butterbeer and continued, "At least both of ya are alive and whole."
"Yes, I said I love you, Draco Malfoy," Harry started, "and I have for quite a few months now. You may be the first one to say it, but I just knocked the ball out of the park with my sense of timing. Ah, stop gaping, and kiss me al-ngmph!"
Draco now even has a place of honour beside Harry on the Family tapestry that Harry had made and gifted Molly on one particular Christmas.
But nothing was perfect.
It was deathly quiet for all of six seconds.
"Harry, I am so happy for you," came a small, strangled voice, and Harry found himself with a facefull of bushy hair. Hermione was surprisingly strong for such a petite young woman. She lovingly choked the air straight out of Harry's lungs.
Harry's second reaction kicked in: battle instincts. He grabbed Draco by the arm, the one which had sustained fewer cuts, and wasted no time disapparating to his flat–may his bladder be damned.
Harry expected an outburst or at least a painstakingly long silence. What he got instead was a prompt and somewhat exasperated response from the resident ginger. "Um, mate, I think I asked you to tell us something new?"
Ron gave him a light slap over the back of the head. "Hello, did you meet Dorin? Capital fellow, happens to be my brother's boyfriend. And Ginny just needs time, relax," Ron insisted.
"Expelliarmus!" he cast, and Harry caught their adversary's wand mid-air.
The resounding laugh made Harry both hurt and bewildered. Laugh? How could Ginny laugh at this?
"Yeah. Okay. 'Mione and I will pitch in the good stories about our little get-togethers," Ron said a bit distractedly. He clapped Harry on the back. "Don't worry, it'll be fine," he finished with a little wink.
Chapter Three
Harry's grin widened and got wider still when he saw how it infuriated Draco. "You're sure, are you? I've been told that I'm very good. And if I'm not wrong, I quote," here he pitched his voice upwards a few octaves, "'dammit, that stuff that we just did will be the death of me. Oh fuck. That was the most phenomenal sex I have ev-pffhmp'!" Harry was abruptly cut off when a pillow came down on his face, accompanied by a shrill objection on Draco's behalf.
Then the front door slammed shut, and suddenly, there was a spell flying at them.
Harry turned his attention to Percy, but he didn't have much to say. Percy just muttered a halfhearted "Congratulations," and fled to the upstairs to write a letter.
Harry blushed furiously. "What? No—Merlin, no. It's just that, well... I'mkindagay." The words tumbled out of Harry's mouth with the grace of an angry rhinoceros with malformed limbs.
So Harry was eating alone at the typicallyshared table. He would have felt awkward if he hadn't spent the first ten years of his life in a cupboard without a friend in a world, but as it was, he was completely comfortable.
Harry appeared in his flat, and instantly began ushering Draco to the sofa. Simultaneously, he accio'd a vial of dittany. He caught it without looking and crouched by Draco, who now was slumped over, still bleeding, on the sofa.
"Nope. Potter. Don't say another word that can potentially make the rest of the few sessions, you know... Worse that they already are."
Harry cleared his throat. "So, we're in a relationship, but it's still casual and-"
Ginny began to pick at her food, hands trembling, as tears started welling up in her eyes. Harry forced himself to eat. He observed a little frown on his ex-fiance's mouth and wondered helplessly if she planned to make that expression for the rest of the meal. Most likely. Ginny wasn't the sort of person to do things halfway.
"Well, he is the Greek god of retribution. This really feels like divine retribution to me, it does. Punishment, if you will. Years of hatred and jealousy and obsession and 'ughhh I can't tolerate the very sight of you' , 'here, watch me as I dance my way over to the dark side etc' has put me in this position, I'd wager.
Teddy has already started to showcase his inherited metamorphmagus skills and holds both his godfather and cousin in the highest regards. Moreover, when he stays over with them, his bedtime is forgotten as is his limit for chocolate intake, and that works greatly in favour of Harry and Draco.
Harry couldn't help but smile as he recalled their Friday dinners, the ones that Draco often attended. Of course Ron had been skeptical at first, but after the first dinner, he'd grudgingly accepted that Draco had really changed since the days of their adolescence at Hogwarts. Ron had then concluded that he "would not mind" having him over more often.
*a few months after the war*
"I believe so," was Harry's simple reply.
Did Draco really say that? He's gonna what now!
By anyone's standards, the Burrow was as homely a place as it had ever been. The scent of Molly Weasley's cooking–roast beef and vegetables, warm cider, all flavoured by motherly love–wafted through the air and wrapped the world in warmth. Like a big, woolly blanket made out of food and affection.
Harry still looked unconvinced. Ginny scooted closer. "Just imagine, Harry–just the two of us, away from all these godforsaken funerals and trials... A whole week to ourselves without worrying about who else needs a testimony or who succumbed to their injuries..." She was unable to keep the wistfulness out of her voice.
"We weren't supposed to be, but we canceled," Hermione said with a wide smile. Her eyes glinted deviously.
"No, Harry, I don't. Forgive me, but sometimes I like to think about my own self as well," Ginny said, a resentful tone making a guest appearance. "Don't you ever just want to have fun? Can't we at least try to have fun and make the best out of it?" She sounded as if she was trying to cajole a brick wall.
(A few weeks before Christmas)
"Did you say-?"
A strange sort of whimper escapes Malfoy, and he shudders just the tiniest bit.  Harry smirks. Two can play this game. Only this was Draco Malfoy he was playing 'this game' with. Draco Malfoy, who is his patient,  and from the looks of it, will be for at least the next few weeks. Draco Malfoy, who is in quite some pain, and mostly vulnerable on that table, wandless, and his magic dimmed, but still manages to smile sometimes, who is his arch nemesis, but nowadays it doesn't seem that way any more, who doesn't really have a brain to mouth filter sometimes, who weirdly enough it's not difficult having almost enjoyable conversation with, who talks a lot some times and goes very quite for a while every now and then.
“Thank you, Remi. You’re my family, too, and I know he’s coming back, I just wish he didn’t have to leave right before Christmas.” Harkin whispered into Remus’ ear. “I should probably go home. I think Draco has been brooding for long enough.” Harkin said as she pulled away from him, and she smiled up at him.
“I’m not going anywhere love. Malfoy’s mate for life.” Draco said as he pulled her back in for a kiss and he rolled them to the side so he was now lying on top of Harry. Harry’s fingers made their way into Draco’s hair, and her legs spread so Draco could slid between them. Draco pulled away from the kiss to look her in the eyes. “My mother is going to want to give you Malfoy lessons. How to act and dress like a Malfoy. We take our appearances outside the Manor very seriously.” Harry cut him off with a kiss.
“Well, I would have been better this year if everyone wouldn’t have been against me, thinking that I’m a lying freak. I get that enough at home, thank you. Now, if you excuse me, I need to leave before I lose my temper and do something I will regret.” Harry batted Draco’s hand away and walked out of the room, slamming the door behind her.
“Mipsy, you may go, I’m no harm to Miss Potter.” Mipsy disappeared with a crack, and Narcissa walked up to Harry and pulled her over to a chair as far away from the door as possible. “Harry, dear. Lucius and I are trying our hardest to get you out of here. We both fear what the Dark Lord’s plans are for you, and how some of the Death Eaters will react. We don’t have much time before the Dark Lord will move, so just try and bade your time with the least amount of sass, sarcasm, and attitude as possible. We’ll try and get you back to Draco in the best condition possible.” At the mention of Draco, Harry’s face fell.
“You can braid my hair?”
“Yes, I am aware, but Lucius very much doesn’t like it when plans do not go his way, and the fact that Bella could get a hold of Remus on her own gave away that Lucius was involved. I could not let him get away with harming our family.” Narcissa stated.
“I can and I will, for you I will do anything. For our children, I will do anything I can. This is our family, Har, and I will protect it.” Draco said as he placed his hand on her extended stomach and smiled down at her.
Harry curled into Draco on the couch, and Draco wrapped his arms around him pulling him closer and eventually into his lap. Harry ended up straddling Draco’s lap and Harry leaned his forehead against Draco’s. Draco chuckled as he closed the rest of the distance between them.
i am sorry for this chapter, when i first started writing this fic i didn't intend for it to go this way, but then i started writing and i figured Voldemort might treat Harry different if he became a girl, and i'm guessing there would be some spell to tell if something is a Horcrux, and of course he had to figure it out. i hope you liked my interpretation of the events comments on how you like this chapter are very much appreciated i'm hoping to get Harry out of Voldemort's grasp in the next few chapters, but i kind of like the way this is heading.
“Father, I can explain. I was going to tell you; I just didn’t know how to tell you. I-I’m sorry, Father, but until I figured out everything I didn’t want to tell you anything. I love Harry and we want to be together, and there is nothing you can do about it. Only Harry and I can dictate what happens in our relationship, and you are just going to have to deal with it,” Draco released and as he went on Lucius’ eyes got wider and wider. Lucius was staring at Draco like he either didn’t know what Draco was talking about or was extremely confused by it.
“Harry!” Draco screamed. “Mum!” Draco yelled and Narcissa started lowering Harry onto the floor. “What’s happening?”
Draco cast another warming charm on the blankets to help quicken the process. “Come on, Love. You’re stronger than this, Harry.” That’s when the door burst open again.
“Yes, you do. I’m sorry as well. It’s just I hate it when people act different around me. I’m no different than I was two weeks ago or four weeks ago. I’ve learned to cope with everything that happens to me. Oh, which reminds me. Does the library have a book of names in it? I’d like to look at names. Since I’m stuck as a female now, I figured I should have a female name. One that fits me.”
“Are you saying you’ve always felt this way about me, Draco?” Harry said, and she emphasized Draco as she said it. Draco moaned, and he rested his forehead against Harry’s shoulder. “Draco?” Harry questioned, and Draco moaned again.
“Why didn’t you tell anyone?”
“I figured you would want a little alone time, and what better way to do that than with gardening.”
“He has been like this since that morning you disappeared, and he hasn’t let go of your wand since then either.” Teddy bounced into Harry’s arms and wrapped his arms around Harry, poking his wand into the side of his head.
“Eventually, your father came around, obviously. He apologized for his actions after finding out what I had done, and he told me I had done the right thing if it was what I absolutely wanted. I wasn’t his decision, it was mine, and he understood that. I accepted his apology, but I was still afraid of him. Every time he went to touch me, I flinched, and we realized that we would have to start our relationship over from scratch. Your father slowly got me to trust him again, and finally three years after I graduated, we finally got married and soon after that we had you. Two years we waited and tried to get pregnant again, and I was starting to think I gave up my only hope to have children. Your father never gave up hope though, and when I finally got pregnant with you, your father wanted to be there every step of the way. Your father and I fell in love twice, and fell out of love twice. After I had you, there were complications, I almost died, and your father couldn’t see me it was so critical. All he had was this little baby boy that he didn’t know how to raise on his own, and when I finally stabilized, we were informed that I wouldn’t and shouldn’t try to have another child. If I were to somehow end up pregnant, the pregnancy would be terminated for my safety. This decision was made by your father before I woke, and when I found this out I lost trust in your father. Mind you we still loved each other, but not the same as we did before my last year at Hogwarts. All the betrayal pulled us apart.” Narcissa finished.
Innumerable walks, fourteen assignments, four months, three proposals, and a lot of indecision later, they were finally in a relationship.
Chapter One
"Took you long enough to figure that one out, Blondie," Harry said, laughter in his voice and exuberance evident, even in the dark.
There, sitting against the sinks with his sleeves rolled up and red staining his clothes and arms, was Draco Malfoy. Dark, ugly marks marred his forearms, from whence blood oozed profusely. Crisscrossed cuts bit into his pale skin, not deep enough to kill him quickly but certainly deep enough to kill him eventually. His eyes were vacant, focused on something far away–oblivion, maybe–and his lips twitched as he mumbled incoherently at nothing and no one.
They walked in silence until they reached the door to the dueling grounds. The arched doorway was wide and open, and sunlight spilled in, sharply contrasting the mood. The two stood wordlessly for a moment before Draco finally took a deep breath and said, "You can't help me. Nobody can. I should have died."
Harry had other things on his mind. "Ron, what if the rest of your family doesn't accept me either?"
"Yeah. Right. Er, I was saying that I'm, uh, kind of...dating, you know?" Harry said. He put his words together as carefully as he could. Admittedly, Harry found the idea of a tearful confession to his friends oddly fanciful. It had the potential to really add to their friendship when all was said and done. At the same time, Harry wasn't sure if he was emotionally prepared to deal with one of Ron's moods again.
Yet Draco didn't seem to mind the comment, and they kept on walking down the gloomy alleys of London in a comfortable silence, each aware of the fact that this was going to last.
Harry raised one eyebrow at Draco as they rounded a corner out of an alley and onto a street that was dimly illuminated by streetlights. The orange light seemed to fend off the gloom, if only a little. "Did you want to?" asked Harry.
Harry smiled a little smile, noticing the self-loathing ease out of Draco's features, if only a bit. "Yes. It's a wonder how any of us catch any sleep at all. Ron has woken me up from nightmares countless times, and me him," Harry ventured on. "And then there's the guilt and the regret. So many people died. So many souls, most of whom I didn't even know. So many people who didn't deserve to die. And the guilt of laughing, of enjoying myself every once in a while..." Harry shook his head. "Half the people I've ever cared about are dead because we couldn't be faster. They call me the saviour, and look at the death toll. It mocks me, taunts me, and wrecks me with regret."
Sometimes that got tiring…
"Don't you dare say that ever again; you are nothing like them," spat Harry, throwing his words forcefully at Draco. His eyes burned bright. He spoke not with the sternness and confidence he had the night before but as if the very notion that Draco was anything less than the definition of morality offended him.
"What if it's not okay?" Draco whispered, panic gripping his voice and causing him to tense in Harry's embrace. He was blatantly terrified of not being accepted. It was a whisper of a man, broken by life, insecure about the only thing that mattered to him anymore.
Draco, darn-near hysterics, paused in the middle of the bedroom rug and barked out bitter laughter. "Huh! Easy for you to say," said Draco. "Last time I checked, they still worshiped the ground you walked on..."
"That was easy, I suppose," Draco said at length, wand still aimed at their target.
When Harry awoke the next morning, Draco was gone without so much as a note. The only signs he'd ever been there were the neatly-folded duvet on the arm of the sofa and the small, splotchy stains of rusty-red on a throw pillow that onlookers would likely attribute to a nosebleed.
The small Irish shack was in a dire state of disrepair, even for a structure that could be described as a "shack." That day, Harry and Draco were taking care of some field training. The shack was the current residence of a known Death Eater, and their task for the day was to capture them and return them alive and in one piece to the headquarters for further questioning and punishment. A trace had been placed on them to track their progress, and surrounding them, hidden from view or knowledge, were several rookie–but well-trained–Aurors, prepared to assist if necessary.
“How did you know that was a blood replenishing potion?”
Then something else that Harry didn’t expect happened, Narcissa stepped forwards and said, “I wish to extend an invitation to the Malfoy Christmas party on Christmas Eve. The entire Weasley family is invited, along with Miss Granger and her parents if they wish. Plus ones are also invited.” Narcissa then turned and walked out of the room saying, “Come Draco, Harry. Visiting hours are almost over and I don’t want to cause any other troubles today.” Draco turned to follow his mother out of the room and Harry went as well, until she was grabbed from behind and pulled into a hug.
“Yeah I got it, mate.” Ron whispered as he turned a little more so Harry was completely out of his eye sight. Hermione walked up to Harry and rested her hand on Harry’s shoulder.
mild, your mild and gentle way. E
Harry seized movement of his hips and lowered his lips down to Draco’s ear and whispered, “Do you like that Draco? Do you want me to continue?” Harry’s breathe tickled Draco’s ear as Harry spoke and breathed into his ear. Draco started breathing heavily as he tried to respond to Harry’s questions.
“Because I know it was him it’s always him in some way.”
“Hello, can we help you?” Draco tried to say politely.
“Save it, Lucius. I am aware of your plans to over throw me for your son’s sake and I understand, but I want to make this clear, if you try it again I won’t be happy. Now, Draco’s still at the school, yes?”
“For what?”
“Well, it looks like tiara, and it reads ‘Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure,’ and it has an oval shaped blue sapphire on it.”
“Now that is the tricky part, Harry, because there is a record of the prophecy in the Hall of Prophecies in the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry of Magic. Your job is to break into the Ministry and steal the prophecy from its shelf.”
“I wasn’t sure if the schedule had changed due to complications with the meal preparation.” Draco stated.
“Potter, I need to talk to you, and I’ve been trying to do it all year so far, and this just gives me the perfect opportunity, because most of the people outside this room probably think I’m trying to kiss you right now or something. I want you to know that I know he’s back. I’ve seen him, and I need to get my mother away from this. My father will follow the Dark Lord to his death, and I can’t follow him to my death. I’m a Slytherin for a reason: self-preservation.” Malfoy said as he backed Harry up against the teacher’s desk that was left in the room, and he lifted her up onto it and stepped between her legs.
Harry reacted quickly, casting a Protego wandlessly to deflect the oncoming stunner from the Death Eater. The spell rebounded and collided into a cabinet, successfully shattering all the glass in it and knocking everything else over. Draco's wand was out within a heartbeat, his cold gray eyes locked onto the Death Eater.
Harry chuckled and knew that everything would eventually be fine. And his ex-girlfriend and ex-to-be-mother-and-law would eventually be persuaded that there was, indeed, someone better than him for Ginny.
Harry beamed. "Thanks, Mr. Weasley. That means a lot."
Dorin shuddered at the memory of the much-dreaded lunch, and Charlie struggled physically to stifle his laughter.
Draco looked up sharply. "Wait, why do George and Charlie like me?" he demanded.
Thanks.
He dropped Draco on the floor, and the blond watched with his mouth gaping as Harry Potter stormed off. Angry heels walked away without another word.
"Thanks. I promise. Friends?"
"Well, who is it?" Ron said, feigning impatience.
Ginny scooted towards Harry and gripped his shoulders. With tears threatening to fall, she said, "So, we just sit here and wallow in self pity? That's how we get better? You don't think I know what we lost? What we had to do to survive? But can we not try and make the best out of this hell of a situation? I need you too, Harry, I want you to be there for me as well. Can't you do that?" The desperate lilt in her voice made Harry want to turn around a hug her, but something kept him frozen.
Draco looked up as Harry approached, silhouetted against the setting sun.
There was a sharp intake of breath. Ginny made fists, set her jaw, apparently steeling herself for the answer to her next question. She asked very deliberately, "Who is she, Harry?"
The Death Eater turned to run, but he couldn't get more than two steps in such a small space. Poor planning on his part, Harry thought. Draco cast an Incarcerous, and the next thing they knew, the Death Eater was bound in ropes. He lost his balance and fell to the floor. Harry couldn't help but grin. It was almost comical, watching the Death Eater squirm on the floor. Like a fish out of water.
"Who is she, Harry?" reiterated Ginny, her words now sounding much stronger. And much more pissed. Her eyes were suddenly ablaze. You didn't have to be a Legilimens to see that she had to know.
"Umm, yeah," Harry began, wondering how exactly to phrase this. "So, there's, err, this thing that I wanted to confess. Err, so see here, the thing is, I mean, what I wanted to say is, that..."
Draco's eyes widened, and he propped himself up a bit on his elbows. "Wha-what? No. No. Really?" Draco said, his expression alone begging for elaboration.
Harry watched her go with a funny feeling in his stomach. A nearby chicken tilted its head to one side, and Harry scowled at it. "The hell are you looking at?" he muttered to it.
Harry nodded. "Yeah. Contributed a lot to our relationship, that did. And Charlie likes you, or rather, Charlie likes us mostly because we're gay," Harry explained halfheartedly. "Anyway, the rest of them, they don't particularly like you, per se. Your task tomorrow is to make them see the person I do everyday. Just be you, and it will be fine. I swear on Merlin. Come on, Draco, let's go to sleep… Tomorrow's a big day. Come on, Blondie."
Flashback
Harry gave a humourless chortle and continued, "I'm no hero. I would be nothing without the help that I got from my friends. Nothing. And that's the hardest part: pretending to be someone I'm not." At Draco's curious expression, Harry added, "Putting up a facade every day, so that those who died could at least die for a more noble cause, instead of a nobody. There were so many that I couldn't save."
"Draco," came a hardly audible reply.
He decided to go with the truth. "I have nightmares, too," admitted Harry, unsure of whether it would actually help Draco in any way. Even if it didn't, it would help Harry certainly.
It's just easier to write this than own up to it aloud. I need help. I need help really badly. And I know this is hard to believe, but I am sorry. Thank you for yesterday. Meet me in front of the Ministry after work, if you want to. I'll talk.
Harry patted the bed beside him, willing Draco to lay there. His expression could have been seen as odd, but the blond had seen it enough to identify it as what it truly was–sensual.
Harry gulped, blood rushing to his face and surely turning him scarlet. "About that, Gin, look–I mean, listen..."
Molly, after an extremely emotional evening of tears and tea, adopted Draco into her ever expanding family, and "Oh, Harry, how could I not see this?", "Oh, Harry dearest, I am so happy for you.", "Draco, dear, you are far too thin to be well nourished. Come here, and eat the crepe this instant," were heard often.
In due course, the father, with an earful of Hermione's and Molly's words of courage and comfort, was called into the delivery room, as the Weasley clan (honorary ones included) awaited the arrival of yet another offspring.
Although, Ron did once get scarred for life when he barged into Harry's room unannounced late one evening, looking to borrow a quill. Despite swearing vehemently never to permit Draco within the premises again, his resolve crumbled after a few awkward apologies and a peace offering of Firewhiskey the following week.
Harry smiled at the memory, mentally slapped himself for getting all sappy, and finally cursed himself for getting even more late.
That's pretty much it, but fret not. An owl will be dispatched the moment they announce their marriage or babies.
Harry watched from the corner of his eye, not liking the way Draco tensed at those words. For a split second, he was afraid Draco was going to stomp on their adversary. But the blond controlled himself, so Harry deemed it safe to devote his full attention to dismantling the Death Eater's wards.
"Anytime, Harry," Arthur said, smiling and giving a little wink. It reminded Harry a lot of Ron. He quickly added, "But do remember that he still has to have that much-dreaded lunch with me. He can ask Dorin for pointers."
Harry heard the barely audible premonition and felt an odd sort of pang in the vicinity of his chest. He closed his eyes for a moment, reflexively assessing the feeling, and said in the softest and most un-Potterish voice that he could manage, "Hey. Hey. Listen to me. I'm not saying that they will forget everything that has happened. I'm not saying that they will accept you with open arms. They very well may, they very well may not." Draco looked up, eyes glistening.
Loudly.
"Huh."  Malfoy says after a while.  "Well? From larger scheme of things right now, it seems that I'll  either come out of this ordeal with a backache, that's, ideally gone, realistically just a little lesser," his right hand, the one with the two rings shooting out to do emphasise  his point, "or with me actually coming in my goddamn pants. It's a win win situation for me really. Hmmm."
Harry poked his head into the fire, as he dialed for their office's fireplace, in the hope of catching Draco buried under a truckload of paperwork, which quite uncharacteristically he had been putting off. But, to his utter dismay, as he surveyed their office through the fire, the truckload of paperwork was there on the magically enhanced filing cabinet (a gift from Hermione on their promotion) and on their tables, but Draco Malfoy was nowhere to be seen. Harry, sighing, withdrew from the fire and resigned himself to dispatch the message through the dramatic means of a patronus. He retrieved his wand from the wand-holster, cast the incantation, and the elegant stag erupted from the tip of his wand, in all his silver glory. Still quite fascinated by the beauty of his stag, he also remembered how breathtaking Draco's Arctic fox is, and how elegant their pair is. The first time Draco had cast it was in the later parts of training, the fox erupting at first in wisps of silver smoke, and then, slowly evolving into a true corporeal one. "Harry, I had a happy memory, I recalled that moment when I was selected for the Auror Corps and the moment we were assigned as partners..." Draco had excitedly spilled, after the completion of that day's training. "So, long time crush, eh Drake?" Harry had countered, immediately, with a mad grin on his face, only to be smacked right on the shoulders, along with a "Oh shut up, you prat!"
"Yeah, well," said Harry, remembering the other thing. "There's one other thing. I mean, I know this is most upsetting to you, positively disgusting, but I need to get this out." Maybe this would get him his dramatic coming-out story.
Hermione, her enthusiasm for SPEW undaunted, had gone on to work for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement as an intern. She was steadily climbing the ranks, leaving the five other witches and wizards whom had joined with her in the dust.
"I do. I believe you, Malfoy. It's those guts of yours that make you different."
He grinned when he said this, and Harry smirked back accordingly. Draco walked over and used his foot to push the Death Eater onto his back. The Death Eater's eyes were wide and blue and mad and bore holes into Draco.
The duo entered the shack quietly, silent as shadows. It was dark, giving Harry the impression that no one was home. But they'd been stalking the Death Eater's movements for hours, so he knew that the shack was well-inhabited. Harry's spine shuddered as he felt himself pass over a ward. He could tell by the way Draco's neck twitched that he felt it too.
"Let me help you Harry. I... you don't have to do this alone. I'm here.
I'll be here. Please. You know what, let's go somewhere for vacation," she said at length, and at Harry's semi-perplexed expression, she went on, "Come on, it'll be fun, won't it? Just the two of us... I saw this poster on my way home the other day. Romantic Getaway to Bali, it said. Muggle thing, but that won't be a problem. We can work this out, I know we can."
"Erm, no." He replies. It comes out a little more hoarse than he had expected.
Harry figured the only answer was the truthful answer. It had to be said. "They're not a she–they're a he. I'm gay, and I'm in l-love with, err, dammit..." Harry was unexpectedly stumbling over his own tongue. The awkwardness of this confession bit deeper than the cold of the snow on the ground, but he forced himself to keep going. Ginny had to know, and he had to say it. "I'm in love with Draco Malfoy."
Draco gave shaky sigh. "How in Merlin can you–wait," the blond cut himself off. He locked eyes with Harry and asked, "What did you just say?"
"Ginny, please. Please don't do this. I am here," Harry said, putting his arms around her, tightly. "Right here. But, I can't handle a relationship now."
Ronald Weasley had gauged his family's reactions to the tooth.
"Harry?"
In the meantime, Ron and Hermione got married; quite obviously, Harry was the best man, and yes, there were a few fun hiccups, courtesy of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.
Draco very obviously rolled his eyes and stopped walking so he could face Harry properly. The words flew from his mouth as if he'd been sitting on them for years. "We've been hating each other with a vengeance for the last seven years, and you believe me? That itself is a bit hard to believe. But even if I give you the benefit of the doubt, you're just a single person. Everyone else hates me." Here, Draco's voice cracked a bit, and he was nearly overcome with emotion.
Ron, who was silently shaking with laughter over his mate's discomfort, composed himself and said, "Of course we knew, but we didn't say anything because we wanted you to tell us when you were comfortable with it." He continued grudgingly, "Yeah, it's true that I would rather you stick your tongue down someone else's throat, but if it has to be that ferret, then it has to be that ferret. It is evident that he's changed, or either of you would have resigned by now. And besides, it's time you did something because you just wanted to. If you think we put our lives at risk and fought a war with you only to disown you for being gay, then, blimey, you're just a git. A daft one."
Harry's first reaction was panic. "What the-?" started Harry, but he suddenly regained the use of his legs. Before he knew it, he was at Draco's side. Close as he was, he could finally make out Draco's words:
“In trouble.” Hermione said as the door swung open, and they stepped into the common room to find the room full of people all staring at them.
“Can’t the Dark Lord just undue it when he wakes?”
“Who? Harry? He’s definitely here. I can tell you that for sure, he’s upstairs being stubborn about lying in bed to get better even if he can’t stand on his own. It rather annoying really. I can also tell you that if you try and find him you won’t be able to unless I tell…” Draco paused as he heard a bang and something move down his bond he has with Harry. “Damn it, Potter. Stay in bloody bed.” Draco turned to move but Granger advanced on him as Lupin reached for her arm to stop her. Draco spun around to face her, and he bared his teeth and released a growl from deep in his throat. Granger stumbled backwards, and into Remus’ out stretched arms.
Harry sighed. "I just said that, well, I -" He paused to take a deep breath. "Um, am-" Oh Merlin! "-gay."
"Oh don't ptetend to be more daft than you are potter..." Draco drawls, moving his head a little, hesitating whether to turn back and look at Harry, and  then finally deciding against it.
They had gone quite a distance when Harry finally broke the silence. "I meant what I said earlier," began Harry, causing Draco to look him in the face. "You really are nothing like him, Malfoy. Nothing like him at all."
A bitter laugh sounded, and Draco tried to stifle it with his hand. "Yes, most certainly. When I found myself on your couch this morning–Merlin!" He gave Harry a shit-eating grin, but it was devoid of humour. "The cushions were insufferable."
The trio shared a modest home, where they would meet up and maintain the familiarity of their relationships on a near-nightly basis. Usually, dinner conversation consisted of Hermione going to extraordinary lengths to tell Ron all about how much better he would look if he wore less ill-fitting pants. That night, Harry had fixed things to be slightly more eventful.
"Gin, I am so sorry. But, you have got to understand me. I need to fix myself first. It's like, I don't have a direction anymore, I have to pull myself up, and I need to do that myself."
He sounds almost petulant. And a little nervous? If he hadn't been waxing poetic about how much he's hated Harry for years, Harry might have even found it adorable. Adorable? Adorable? Huh?
Percy and Audrey celebrated an anniversary just last week, and Percy is far less of a prat now, though he still has the strange habit of boasting about his badges while at Hogwarts.
He gratefully bit into a cracker as Teddy pulled Victoire's blonde locks, evoking another bout of wails. He would not have traded anything for these days. He steeled his resolve and tried, quite unsuccessfully, to convince himself that everything would be perfect.
*Epilogue*
"I mean Draco and me. Specifically," grumbled Harry before taking a swig of butterbeer. He wondered idly if Molly still hid the Firewhiskey in the cupboard under the clock.
Fleur and Bill couldn't have been happier, and it is really quite a task to describe their baby daughter, Victoire, 'cause, c'mon, look at those genes. Fleur now can speak English fluently, and is very proud of that fact, though.
The Death Eater spat, then laughed bitterly. He spoke next with unbridled vehemence. "You are no better."
Harry offered a silent thanks to whomever had legalized disapparation of registered Ministry officials from within their departments.
Draco rolled his eyes as if it were the stupidest question in the world. "Potter, you applied dittany. It's exactly how you left it last night. Don't worry–I didn't cut it again."
After hours of leafing through the file cabinets, Harry's "people skills" finally manifested, and he noticed how conspicuous Draco's continued absence was. Normally, his partner at least hung around long enough to gloat about it being Harry's turn with paperwork. Harry shook his head and ran his fingers through his hair, mussing it up far more than usual. He was done with his obligations here, and he didn't feel like waiting around for Draco when he could be procrastinating in the comfort of his own flat.
The resounding glare could have been felt miles away. "I'm serious, Potter," said Draco through gritted teeth.
Harry whispered to Ginny, feeling as if he were under a spotlight. "Not here, Gin," he said quietly. "Please, can't we talk about this in, y'know, private?" he almost-pleased, nearly begging by this point.
"Ronald!" Hermione resorted to another swat, this time at his head.
"Like hell you don't want to." Harry said this a tad louder than he meant to, but no one else in the hall spared them a glance. They could recognize the duo from halfway to Morocco by their banter alone, and their fellow trainees were well used to them being, well, combative.
