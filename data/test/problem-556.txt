“Oh, shush.” Sirius laughed “Well we went back to yours after the wedding and we were both a bit drunk and then you got down on one knee-“
Hermione inched along the thin stone walkway, ducking her head under a low outcrop. Her hair was a slick, thin blonde now, pulled back away from her face. Neville imagined her own hair would have caught on the rocks. But her natural hair was piled under a wig gap, safely out of the way.
. Though of course Hermione had been taught by her father never to judge a book by its cover, she figured it was probably acceptable to judge when the book seemed to spew a constant stream of absolute nonsense and grinned at the world as if it was viewing a rather charming absurdist play.
“Hello Mrs. Weasley” Luna said, squinting to look at her directly. She pushed her long blonde hair out of her face, where it had fallen as she drew.
Ron had never seen a room go so quiet before. Well. Ron had never seen the boys in a room go so quiet before. They all gaped at Fleur who was, undeniably, the most perfect woman Ron had ever seen.
“Well” Vance said, whipping her long black braid over her shoulder and beginning to walk towards Pansy Parkinson who was hitting her wand in frustration against the desk “I’m always here if you want to hear a story about her”
“They wouldn’t mind” Harry soothed “They love having a full house. I’ll bet we’ll go home, and they’ll have accidentally adopted two more stray cats”
Harry shook his head, “Draco asked her. We did it together so that they could both come. Neville’s going with Parvati and Dean has asked Lavender but I don’t think she’s said yes yet.”
She rubbed her face in annoyance, still half asleep. The fire finally died down fully and she was just about to get up and head to her actual bed when the portrait hole began to creak open. Ginny peered over the high back of the sofa.
His voice tilted up in pitch at the end, as if he wasn’t entirely sure of his own accuracy. This was the sort of thing he’d been doing all train journey, so Hermione wasn’t really surprised. The Malfoy kid looked vaguely confused for a moment, before his expression switched to that of someone who was used to everything always being right in the world when it came to him.
Draco went back to aggressive pouting while Luna found herself enchanted by the bright orange leaves falling from an oak tree beside the Hospital wing windows. She wondered if you could somehow preserve freshly fallen leaves and make jewellery and clothes out of them. Muggles probably had a way. She’d figured out that muggles usually had solutions to things that wizards simply ignored, or only theorised about in a magical sense instead of doing anything practical.
Well, at least that was what people speculated. In fact, no one really knew what had happened to Minister Bones. Only that she had floo’d into work, as usual, and that the building had been taken already by Voldemort and his men.
Harry had warned Neville that he wasn’t to meet Dumbledore’s eyes, or Snape’s. “Legillimens,” He’d said darkly. Neville had noticed that Dumbledore sought his eyes out more in the Great Hall. In potions Snape had only tried once, in an awkward conversation where Neville refused to look up from the table even once. Snape had eventually huffed his annoyance and walked away, but not until he’d thoroughly insulted Neville’s potion.
“I thought maybe we could start having muggle movie nights or gatherings where we played muggle music?” Harry said, shifting awkwardly in front of the room of fifty or so students. Harry didn’t generally take a leading role at these meetings, though it was widely acknowledged that the club belonged to him. His public speaking could certainly be improved. Mainly because he always seemed as if he would prefer to be anywhere else when he had to talk in front of large crowds.
“What? Why?” Ron exclaimed. He had spent lots of time with Harry over every Christmas break. First because they had both stayed at Hermione’s in first year, then because of his almost daily visits to Grimmauld place in second and third year. But he couldn’t imagine not going away for Christmas at all.
She turned around immediately and left before Harry Potter could drive her clinically insane at the tender age of twelve.
Neville had expected something modern, “This is from when our parents were kids.” He pointed out sceptically.
“Why do you even want to come so much?” Hermione finally asks, turning to look at her with confused eyes.
“Sirius said he had a good birthday.” Harry said, looking up from the letter which Hedwig had just delivered to the window of Gryffindor tower. It was a Thursday and the three of them were crowded into a comfortable corner of the common room, legs up on each other’s laps, hastily doing their homework due in on Friday. Well. Hermione was simply there to make sure they did their homework, and then correct it when they inevitably fucked up.
Harry informed them all that the Minister was paying a lot closer attention to the school’s actions this year, that they’d almost had Fleur kicked out in favour of a ministry puppet.
“Oh, mon deus, you must owl me to Hermione.” Her voice lilted when she said Hermione’s voice, as if she was purposefully trying to pronounce it the English way. It was a terribly thoughtful thing for her to do. “All you marvellous women. I will be here next year, if Dumbledore agrees.”
not sure how pleased i am with this chapter and i'm forever sorry for any inconsistencies i miss. i wrote this over such a long time i worry it's too disjointed. hope you enjoy regardless.
of august, the day after Percy’s birthday- it rained. It had not rained all summer and Ginny was certain that this was an omen. This visit was going to be the death of her.
“Love you.” Harry said, giving short embraces to each of his guardians before heading towards the train. Neville noticed he held Sirius particularly tight. Looking at him oddly as he pulled away. “See you at Christmas.” He muttered.
people she wanted to see her in her PJ’s. Especially not these PJ’s which she’d gotten at age 7 and only kept because they were worn out to perfection. She should have just made a dash for the stairs, but the door knob was already turning and she thought, oh no, not th
It was ten to eleven by the time they arrived on the platform. Sirius and Remus, still with bedhead and- yes Neville was almost certain- with their pyjamas under their robes, said goodbye with tight hugs and desperate pleas to ‘be good’.
It had been decided at their first meeting that the paper would be a monthly publication. Current events, Hogwarts news and think pieces and educational articles would make up most of the paper. They were also accepting any submitted short stories or poems. Colin’s photos were prominently featured, taken around the castle throughout the month. Special student achievements were listed in the back by teachers. Dumbledore, surprisingly animated about the idea, submitted a crossword and promised to do it for each publication to come.
Hermione winced slightly at the name, but let it pass, “Oh.” She said softly. Despite her many skills, comforting other people wasn’t one of them. She liked cold, hard facts and often didn’t know what to do or how to react when those cold, hard facts revealed sad, uncomfortable truths.
But when the first dance ended their whole friendship group descended on the dance floor. Draco and Ginny danced elegantly. While Harry and Luna showed them up by dancing like absolute lunatics- waving their arms about and jumping around even to the slow songs. Ron led Hermione happily about the dance floor, listening to her natter on about history and inter-school camaraderie and never mentioning when she stepped on his feet. Ron hadn’t thought he would like dancing much, but he didn’t mind when it was Hermione.
“Harry” Ginny said, slow and clear and deliberate “If you don’t let me come with you, I’ll just follow you anyway. You know I will”
Ron huffed one final time to emphasise that he had not entirely stopped having a paddy-fit. Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry had hidden the velvet package in the back of the rarely-used garden shed, under the plant pots. Hermione had taken a secret trip out there one night to look at it, but she’d gotten such a terrible feeling just being in the presence of the package that she hadn’t worked up the courage to pick it up and look inside it. Harry hadn’t yet revealed anything as he’d said he would, and Ron had seemed to push the incident from his mind almost entirely.
Have the time I can’t understand whatever conversation we’re having because there’s always two layers; the bit that you and me are privy too and Harry and Hermione’s special brand of Chinese whispers.”
“I had your parents send your presents over to us. Thought it would be nicer for you to open them on actual Christmas” Sirius said simply.
Hermione and Ron had been known to jump apart when someone walked into the room, but that was for an entirely different reason. Merlin, young love could be nauseating when you’ve walked in on it by accident.
Hermione threw her hands into the air. She sort of wished she believed in god just so she could renounce him right then and there. “You left dangerous magical objects in a girls lavatory?”
“Now there better be no funny business between you and my sister.” Ron said, knocking Draco’s shoulder with his own and lazily trying to sound stern.
“I have absolutely no idea what you mean, Neville Longbottom.” She said with practiced ease. They didn’t say anything more about it.
Ginny had heard another story, this time first hand from a drunk Weasley auntie, that the reason her mum had had so many children was to fill the gap left by her dead brothers, her dead mother, her dead father. Ginny had met lots of her mother’s cousins, second cousins, removed cousins. Great aunts and even great grandparents, but by the time she was born every member of her mother’s immediate family had been buried in the ground. Ginny herself was named after her grandmother, Ginevra Prewett, who had been killed in the early days of the war. Her first name was her grandmothers, her middle name was her mothers, her last name was her fathers. Ginny didn’t have any names left for her own.
Draco was involved in both of these activities, though definitely more passionate when it came to revision- Hermione and he could be
“What?” Ron said, and he could tell he’d let too many emotions bleed into his voice because Harry and Hermione shared an alarmed look of panic.
Now, Ginny was not one to police other peoples gender expression, but she could smell ‘suspicious behaviour’ a mile off. Harry Potter was being Suspicious. Ginny speed walked her way after him.
Eventually, Neville dug into his bag to find a pack of cards. Harry taught him a muggle game called 'bullshit'.
There was a comfortable moment where they all smiled at Harry, because none of them except Luna could imagine the pain of losing a parent, thankful that he was happy.
Sirius frowned at him, “What? No. Everyone’s fine. Extended Weasley bunch, Arthur and Molly are at mine too.” He sighed and muttered under his breath, “And another dozen people on top of that.”
It had all been so stupid. A group of Gryffindor’s including her brothers had decided to put together a friendly game of quidditch. Ginny had asked to play. They’d laughed. And not only had they laughed, but George had told her that they didn’t want her on their team because she was a ‘little girl’ (Angelina had punched him but he still hadn’t taken it back). Ron had nodded and said she was too weak. Percy had stuck his nose out of his book and said that she was too young, anyway, to play with the others.
“We’re on a mission for Dumbledore. It’s to do with Voldemort” Harry said calmly, and because she was still staring at the house Ginny missed the surprised look Hermione shot him.
“Yeah but the more conservative powers-that-be are making sure it doesn’t spread much. They don’t want people to take it seriously. It doesn’t benefit them,” Draco said, thoughtful, “And there are a lot of people with power who don’t like Minister Bones.”
It took her days to realise what had struck her as odd about that, apart from the whole of it of course. She’d never told him her last name.
Oak trees sprouted and were felled. Mammoths experienced a brief resurgence before once again going extinct. The human race finally figured out how to manipulate natural occurrences of biological immortality.
She didn’t often fully understand what Harry was talking about. He didn’t seem to expect her too, and in return he never laughed at anything she said or gave her odd looks. She’d even heard him telling off Ronald for calling her Loony. Harry always seemed vaguely fuzzy to Luna, as if he was somehow out of place. She didn’t mind too much. Apart from Ginny and Colin, he was her only other friend in the world.
Neville jerked unexpectedly, even though he logically knew that Harry must know about it. It was just that he’d never talked about it to any of his classmates, many of them entirely unaware why it was that Neville lived with his Grandma in the first place. “Did Sirius tell you?”
“Harry, you aren’t Peter Pan. Pick up the cards and sit down.” Hermione said as she tried to fish a lost ace out from under her armchair.
Luna had heard Sirius and Professor Lupin use these names for each other. She wondered what Sirius was asking forgiveness for or even when he’d asked.
“Hermione!” He cried, and they hugged each other like they hadn’t seen each other in ten years instead of, at a stretch, two months. Fred and George made kissy faces at each other and Ginny mimed vomiting.
“Harry.” He called, catching up to him in the courtyard. Long legs came in useful sometimes. They were paused under a large tree. Harry stared at it thoughtfully.
When she’d finished eating, Harry spoke. As if Luna was a fairy creature that needed to be presented with gifts so she wouldn’t bite his head off.
The Rabbit dissolved and they all stared at where it had been for a single moment. Then Sirius let out a string of expletives and kicked the first stone step.
There was a general buzz of energy going around the room. The new DADA professor had not been at the welcome feast last night. Plus, the whole class timetable had apparently had to be hastily rearranged.
Ginny smiled at her, sad but real. She reached over and gripped Luna’s hand in hers “I’ll always be your friend, Luna”
She couldn’t explain such a selfish idea, but it still plagued her. The anxiety of the unprovable notion sometimes kept her up at night.
“Give me a moment, Gin” Harry said, not cruelly but clearly focused. Ginny stopped talking and instead just watched over his shoulder.
The second time he had brought Hermione with him, and the time spent in the actual vault had been much shorter. He’d simply replaced what he’d taken out the first time (an ugly ring) and waltzed back out. It wasn’t about the lower falls anymore. No, this time they had been staking out the walls.
sign and her name in red letters- was open slightly even though she knew she always closed it fully because she didn’t want her brothers to snoop.
I see the world and it is nothing special. It is a brick wall that you can not run through. It is stone stacked shoddily on mortar and nothing else.
Luna nodded at Mrs. Weasley in agreement, though she couldn’t honestly say she was worried. She’s heard something about a murderer who’d escaped, she could remember it vaguely now. Harry had been very concerned about it during their last days at school.
Right after they’d breached the water, as his stomach flipped over and over at the rapid decline, Neville had craned his neck fiercely to see a row of steep steps leading down to the floor of vaults.
Neville placed that one on the floor, too. The next thing was a muggle photograph, still and unmoving. It was of the East End of Diagon alley, Gringotts in centre. Heart racing, Neville picked up the last smaller piece of parchment.
“He’ll be fine.” Harry dismissed, though Ron could detect the worry still evident beneath Harry’s bluff.
“Neither of them.” Harry said with a shudder. “Hermione is like a sister to me. That’s like you saying you were dating Ginny.”
“Yeah. I was godfather,” Harry looked off into the distance thoughtfully, as if viewing his own life through one of those muggle cinema thingies, “I wonder what happened to him. Poor Teddy.”
She expected that Harry would want to spend the day somewhere private and not at the feast, and so wasn’t too surprised when he begged off. She wasn’t even that surprised when he asked her and Ron to stay back and keep him company. Ron had agreed slightly wistfully (He’d joyfully waxed poetic on the food he’d been told got served at the feast for an hour at lunch time the day before) but ready and happy to help out their friend. Draco would have been forced to sit with his friends at Ravenclaw table anyway during the feast, so it wasn’t like they were leaving him stranded and alone.
“I’m not a bad person” Draco implored, sounding desperate. Luna wondered who he was trying to convince.
When she’d tentatively offered him a hello, he’d made a strangled, dying cat sound in the back of his throat, and landed heavily on the opposite bench of seats, head in hands.
“What is this?” Ginny whispered, wondering why Harry’s big secret had anything to do with this dying house in the middle of nowhere.
Harry shook his head, lips pursed. He was staring intently at the door, wand held high but no sound coming from his mouth. Finally, the door glowed a soft purple, then sunk into the stone as if it had never been there. Neville gaped.
Sirius let out a weak laugh “Don’t worry kid. I used to work for the ministry. I know how bad they are at paperwork.”
Harry took his hand, pulling him along somewhere. Neville was suddenly aware that although he trusted Harry deeply, he didn’t fully trust Harry to be sane and make good choices.
“Did you finish it?” Ginny asked, and Neville looked away from Harry. Ginny was directing her question at an ethereal Luna, who was backlit by the pink sunset. Both Luna and Hermione’s hair had frizzed up in the heat. Ginny’s was piled atop her head.
“What house do you think you’ll be in?” Luna asked suddenly, after a slight lull in the conversation. Ginny looked at her in surprise. Luna didn’t tend to follow normal small talk patterns, or any pattern of conversation at all, and would instead drift around topics and bounce from thought to thought. If Ginny wanted to glean any pertinent information, she was forced to decipher it like a riddle.
It was the second day of classes, but due to having arrived on a Friday they’d been settled days ago. They’d had only a handful of classes on Monday.
Ron made an angry noise. He hadn’t been happy to learn his eleven-year-old sister had been taken on a dangerous adventure. Then again, he knew it had probably somehow been her fault. Ginny’s ability to blackmail her way into situations was positively diabolical.
Harry visibly gulped. Then he sighed and reluctantly dragged a chair so that he was situated a few feet from Hermione.
“What the hell did you do?” Neville yelled, rounding on a soot covered harry. Neville’s voice was cracked from the smoke. His throat and eyes ached. “You’re absolutely fucking crazy, you know that?”
Plus, it was notoriously unreliable. More often than not you committed heinous sins to only achieve a shade of your lost loved one, or a miserable and unstable ghost.
The only proof that any of it had ever happened at all came when the Prophet arrived the next morning, and each of them held their breaths until it was unfurled to reveal a front page about the recent wizarding attacks. No mention of a Gringotts break in at all.
Sirius and Remus smiled at him kindly. “Don’t mention it. It was a pleasure. We’ll see you at Christmas.”
“Why does everyone care so much?” Ginny huffed, plopping herself down in between the roots of a gnarled tree.
“You think you’ll teach again next year?” Ginny asked her happily, still half laughing from Tonks changing her nose into a pig.
Charlie he only heard about in fantastical tails of Dragon keeping from the rest of the family around the dinner table. Percy was a quieter figure than his preceding reputation suggested. Neville had been to busy hiding from his authority to know him very well, and he gained little from his stay except to learn that Percy was still as diligent and obsessive about work as he had always seemed before.
“Fleur’s a girl.” Harry pointed out and Ginny wrinkled up her nose. “Fleur seems cool.” Harry insisted at her face.
“Bonjour, class.” She said. Neville noticed that her accent was less thick and wondered if she had spent the whole summer in England. Her English had always been excellent, however. “My name is Professor Delacour. I am sure you remember me from last year.”
“You’ll have to apologise to Hagrid. And Buckbeak” Harry said sternly, but his mouth was twitching up at the sides “And don’t go about making a drama about this”
“It’s like I lived out everything the first time, okay” Harry said, getting animated in his attempt to have Hermione understand “I had the first eleven years with my aunt and uncle, then I went to Hogwarts. I did all seven years at Hogwarts. With you. And with Ron and Draco and everyone else that’s here “ He frowned “Though we weren’t friends with Draco last time. I’m, er, pretty surprised that happened actually” He rubbed his temple sheepishly “And then I—” Harry stopped. He turned to stare out of the window. It faced out onto the front lawns. The forbidden forest loomed large on the horizon “Then I died”
“We need a herbology expert.” George explained, tugging goggles onto his face. In the corner of the seemingly ordinary bedroom sheets of metal had been stuck to the walls and a cauldron was giving off tendrils of yellow smoke.
Ginny looked around. They’d landed on a grass verge which parallel a winding country lane. Overgrown hedges bordered it, so tall that Ginny couldn’t see over the top of them to what lay beyond. A few meters away a little wooden sign pointed back along the lane proclaiming ‘Great Hangleton, 5 miles’. The sign in the opposite direction read ‘Little Hangleton, 1 mile’.
“Come on.” Harry said, as if they hadn’t been the ones waiting for ten minutes for him to emerge from the dorms, “We should get a good seat. This one’s fun.”
Something flashed in Harry’s eyes and he smiled sadly. “You know I had a friend who told me something very similar” He looked back out at the grounds, as if looking back through years “Long time ago” He looked back at her, smiling “But you never forget a friend”
He met Bill, a curse-breaker who worked for Gringotts, only once. They didn’t interact much beyond initial introductions, but Neville did notice that Harry, Ron and Hermione kept shooting him unreadable looks and would skirt away from him if he got to close. He wondered what that was about.
“Hey! Professor McGonagall!” Harry had yelled from one end of the Transfiguration classroom. McGonagall had exasperatedly turned around and watched as Harry gleefully clasped the hand of a calmly passing by Professor Quirrell. Professor Quirrell Screamed in agony and fell to his knees clutching his hand. Suffice to say the hallway was cleared very quickly and both Harry and Quirrell were dragged to Dumbledore’s office.
“Oh, is it,” She said through gritted teeth, “And will it also shower on Easter and be chilly on Halloween? Oh, how
” Harrys voice cracked. Rising in volume, “Neville there’s no other way. I have to burn this shit- it’s a fucking cancer on our lives and I’m the only one,” His entire face winced, as if in pain, “I’m all alone in trying to stop it from choking our whole world.”
It was Harry and Hermione. Hermione’s hair was even bigger than it usually was, it flew out form her head like a mad scientist. Harry’s hair was sticking straight up in the air, and his glasses where black with smoke.
“Oh, all right. Bu you’re not the only one who gets to be dramatic around here Harry” Hermione said, putting the shovel back regretfully and pulling out her wand.
The door gave a click. He twisted the doorknob, pushing the wood door in. It swung open and behind it was—
“You…believe you are a Seer.” He said, though Hermione didn’t think it was actually a question as he didn’t wait for Harry’s answer, “And that in that box is Peter Pettigrew, who’s the actual traitor and
“Poor Muggles.” Hermione bemoaned, chewing her lip. “Mum and dad said the whole of London is frantic over a new serial killer.”
Neville watched with curiosity as Harry tapped the parchment with his wand and ink unfurled across the paper in shifting patterns. He unfolded it, revealing a much larger piece of parchment.
They began to make their way back to Snape’s office, both grim in the face of the day’s events. Watching the entire student body from elf-sized first years to pre-caffeine frazzled seventh year’s desperately chase after Harry had had an absurd comedy to it, but it hadn’t been anything close to funny. Not with the dazed emptiness in their eyes as they followed them mindlessly.
“It isn’t that I don’t trust him.” Harry said unconvincingly, “It’s just…. You can’t understand. We were enemies for seven years. You hated him too. He was a brat.”
Luna shrugged “Not this year” Usually she and her father would spend the Christmas hols in various locations, searching for crumple-horned Snorcacks. Last year they’d spent a lovely if unfruitful fortnight in Iceland “Dad’s taken some freelance work in Afghanistan for Magical Creatures Monthly, so I’m staying at Hogwarts”
Hermione just kept watching Harry’s face. A blooming joy began to dawn across his face. The sun coming out, finally, after months of rain.
There were two men currently chatting to her mother in the kitchen. Her mother was doing some sort of household task, as she always was, and they were all drinking tea. There had been a big ceremony around the brewing and drinking of the tea. Ginny had noticed that there usually was when it came to adults.
I throw the book against an iron shelf and a dozen more tumble to the ground. A dozen pointless tortures. His life scattered like bread crumbs for me to follow.
Hermione had almost entirely filled up her second spare notebook at this point so it was lucky that her dad had gotten her more for Christmas. She’d tried to get another look at Harry’s own notebook, but he’d become much better at keeping a close eye on it ever since he’d found Hermione holding it. It was probably just full of Harry waxing poetical about Cedric Diggory’s eyes. Hermione was going to be a good friend about that and not push it until Harry wanted to talk to her about it himself.
“Luna.” Harry said simply, “Asked her at breakfast. She says she has an absolutely ravishing pair of fruit earrings.”
It was only another reminder of the war closing in on them, nipping at their heels more and more every day.
The goblin had glared at them, judgement written plain across his face, but he had moved his hand to a different lever anyway and the cart had flown off at a slightly slower pace then usual.
Neville gaped, he felt glued to the floor. “Neville,” Harry screamed, but he was still metres away. Neville watched a purple parrot of flame fly screeching into the air. A green snake of fire, so much smaller than the basilisk but just as deadly slithered faster and faster across the floor. It was nipping at Harry’s heels.
But she knows she’s going to do everything she can to make sure she never looses a single one of her friends.
This wasn’t actually why she found herself following a suspiciously acting Harry from the common room on the second Friday into term, however. She’d fallen asleep in front of the common room fire, an open book about rare potion ingredients open on her chest. At around eleven, well after Percy Weasley had shooed everyone up to there dorms, she’d been awakened by the sound of the portrait hole opening.
Dumbeldore was silent a long while after that, simply staring at Harry. Then he turned away, as if to talk to Professor McGonagall next to him. She was staring between the student and headmaster in astonishment. “Sirius, Remus. Please take the children upstairs and come back so we can continue the meeting.”
“You died?” Ron exclaimed, staring at his best friend in horror. The idea f not having Harry around, as odd and nonsensical as he could be, was incomprehensible. Harry was like Hogwarts itself. Unable to not exist. “You
Neville flushed, looking down awkwardly at his black dress shoes. He didn’t say anything. Sirius just patted him again, warmly.
“But she’s proud of me. I know that. It’s the only thing in the whole world I’m not uncomfortable to be certain about” Luna continued, tears finally slipping from her eyes “She always told me-“ Luna’s voice cuts off with a choke.
The exit for the chamber came out at almost the very bottom of the cliff Hogwarts rested upon. The trek back up to the castle took two hours, and the path was faded with age. Ginny panted and puffed and complained the whole way back.
Hermione thought this was a bit rich coming from a teacher that hardly ever heard Harry talk, but the professor seemed to hold a grudge against Harry. Hermione tried to catch Harry’s eye to check if he was alright. Not, as she suspected was the case, possessed.
“We did take something” Harry said slowly, and Ginny’s stomach flipped with vindication “But it wasn’t yours” She frowned, and Harry hurried on “Lucius Malfoy slipped a book into your cauldron that day in the bookshop. Hermione noticed, and then we took it and had Dumbledore check it out. It was cursed”
“It’s a good thing there’s no Quidditch this year.” Ron had remarked, plonking another dusty tome on the ‘done’ pile. From the whole book he’d only managed to find a page and a half of slightly relevant information. Plus, he’d stretched pretty far for a lot of it. He labelled the parchment now, placing it onto the notes stack. Hermione was pretty into stacks when it came to research. “Merlin I hardly have time to eat.”
things.” Ginny went on, ignoring Hermione completely. “And after it happens, we’ll all just go on acting as if it’s not weird even though it
“Harry!” She cried, stumbling slightly over her untied shoe laces and simultaneously attempting to re-tie her mane of hair into its ponytail. “Wait!”
I feel the pain twist my guts up and burn out my arteries. I feel a million fucking paper cuts across my skin.
At the start of the year shop all of the boys had bought dress robes, unbeknownst to why, and Harry had convinced Ron to put some of his World Cup winnings towards some handsome navy-blue robes. Ron had been happy to do so when a hysterically laughing Ginny had described the dress robes Molly had intended for him, later backed up by an equally diabolically laughing Harry.
The ball was everything promised by the professors- beautiful icicle decorations, a dazzling dance floor, grand and towering Christmas trees. The hall looked positively transformed.
“Just casting some charms so no one sees us. Notice-me-not, muffliato, concealment charm…” Harry listed off distractedly, focused on his spell work.
Ron had been pretty upset about his rat though. Harry had promised that that summer they could go to the pet shop at Diagon alley and see if they could get something else, but Ron had only mumbled something about money which had led harry to blush profusely and be extra nice to Ron for days after.
Harry’s jaw went slack and Hermione let out a yelp of fear and shock. Draco looked at Ron sharply. “Who else?”
Harry started towards one of the sinks and began to hiss under his breathe. Neville reflected that living boys could be pretty damn weird too.
“Wotcher.” Tonks said, in an odd choked voice. Her cheeks and hair were bright red. Ron noticed that she had transfigured her usual plain features into more—well. Striking ones.
“He is. Nothing’s wrong” Even Luna could hear the lie in the man’s voice “We just needed to know where you are”
Ron was disproportionally happy when he watched them separate off to bed without anything close to a loving embrace. Maybe that shouldn’t be what Ron focused on, but it was what made his chest feel funny all the same.
Hermione had sworn that on their way past the forbidden third floor corridor she’d heard growling, but Harry had dismissed it as Hermione just imagining things because of the ghost stories. Hermione had thought that if even Harry Potter was telling you that you were being ridiculous, you were probably being ridiculous.
“I didn’t think they would be that sensitive” Draco snapped, attempting to give a full body flounce of dismay before wincing and gingerly cradling his arm.
Fleur’s eyes lit up, seemingly oblivious to the dozen saucer-eyes trained directly on her, “You speak French?”
He would sneak out, of course. To see the boys and to see Hermione. He was clutching a teary Hermione’s hand right then, hands squished between them. Ron wouldn’t leave his friends alone in their fear and their grief.
Ron frowned. This didn’t seem to be how you’d act of you were about to announce a relationship. “This is serious, isn’t it?” He said quietly.
“Please,” Hermione had asked kindly when they’d entered the cart, holding a hand over her stomach, “I’m in a delicate disposition. Any way we could go a little slower?”
Back in September when she’d turned twelve, they hadn’t even known each other that well but Ron had still presented her with a candle lit cupcake at breakfast and that had been the first day Draco had sat at Gryffindor table with them. He’d spent the whole time looking over his shoulder waiting for someone to tell him off. Harry had presented her with a badly wrapped package which had turned out to be a very pretty blue parrot feather quill.
He frowned, placing his wand on the desk so that it would illuminate the pages. He picked up one of the pieces of scrap paper. In Hermione’s, and it must have been Hermione’s, handwriting it was scrawled
Neville wasn’t sure he believed Harry. How could he know how to control Fiendfyre? What experience could Harry possible have with Fiendfyre?
On the train ride back to Hogwarts, Luna and Ginny sat with Ron and his friends. Colin had stayed at Hogwarts over the holidays because he said he wanted to get photos of everything while there wasn’t anyone ruining his ‘shots’.
In fifth lesson that same day a slightly singed Professor McGonagall had stormed into DADA just as everyone was considering calling time of death on that lesson. A very singed Harry Potter had trailed behind her. McGonagall had irately and succinctly explained to the class that Professor Quirrell wouldn’t be teaching here any more because actually it turned out he was slightly too evil to be working with children and also
“Would you like a jelly-bean?” Luna said, holding her nearly empty paper bag of them out to him. He blinks at them and then a slow grin forms.
Harry fumbled quickly for his pocket and pulled out a compact mirror which was blaring with a red light. His eyes went wide, and he flipped the mirror open. A voice came frantically out of it.
Thankfully they had DADA with the Ravenclaws that year and so when class came about, he hurriedly slid into a desk with Draco and Harry and Hermione took the spot behind them.
“But it would have been the both of us if you’re parents had had their way” Sirius said, giving Remus a weighted glance.
Ron grinned ferally, dusting his robes off with haphazard sweeps and drabbing the shoes off of Nev. “Cheers mate.”
“Not really” Luna shrugged, closing her book. Obviously, Harry needed to have a Conversation about something “They got distracted by NEWTs. I thought it was an intriguing idea, though”
Ron had scribbled a short cartoon entitled, 'The adventures of Padfoot and Professor Puppy' featuring a puppy sized werewolf Remus to send Sirius for his birthday.
Just this life, and my eyes left to treasure it. I turn to the closest shelf, and feel cold leather beneath my fingers.
The slithering stopped, and Ginny could feel a presence close to her. Not a heat, but almost like an absence of cold in the air. Like the basilisk was taking up all of the space around them. She shivered involuntarily.
Instead of speaking, he stepped forward, engulfing his best friend in a choking embrace. Harry collapsed against him, knees going weak. He sobbed into Ron’s school robe, chest shaking silently.
“Father wanted me to go there.” Draco said, the same blue tone entering his voice whenever he talked about his father.
Harry paused on only the second step up and said “Well if they ignore me, they ignore me. But if they don’t? Hermione I might make things so much better”
Behind her mother in the hallway were two men, obviously wizards even in their muggle dress. One was tall, sandy haired and worn looking. He smiled kindly up at the three of him. The man in front of him was thin, with chopped black scraggly hair to his chin and an attire consisting of all black. He was looking at Harry like he was the son.
Luna looked down at her drawing, not yet fully finished, but she was aware that Molly had her no-nonsense voice firmly fixed. “Yes Mrs. Weasley”
“It’s sort of like being an Animagus,” Neville said, frowning as he read, “Except not as permanent.”
What was before them wasn’t impressive in the wondrous way that suddenly appearing magical doors were, but in the way that landfills were sometimes impressive due to their very size. There were stacks and stacks of- stuff. Every type of -stuff- that you could ever imagine. Furniture and books and clothing. Reams of paper and stacks of tea cups and ornate gilded mirrors. Feather boas and stuffed parrots and even a discarded diamond chandelier.
She patted him on the shoulder “I’m pretty certain that both times I was just being dragged along out of obligation.”
That was where they were now, at the top of a small hillock under a strangely sturdy tree. Harry pacing back and forth, tearing his hair out.
“I am worried,” She said quietly. Neville was suddenly reminded that their fearless DADA teacher was hardly four years older than them. That she’d only been a student the year before.
“Who’s in the box, my dear boy?" The wizard asked, his voice clearly denoting that he believed he was conversing with someone who was a few marbles short of a gobstone set. He looked over Harry’s head at Hermione, clearly wanting her to be the one who would explain what was going on. She stared back blankly at him. She didn’t have a clue either, despite Harry’s obviously insane explanation.
Perhaps, she thought, it was like the feeling she got every time she saw sparks fly from a wand or an incantation muttered, and she was reminded starkly of dirty blonde hair and purple smoke.
It had turned out that there was a room on the seventh floor that was perfect for a meeting like this. It was suspiciously perfect, actually. There were study tables clustered in one corner, cushions and dummies for spell practice, and big blackboard that took over one wall. Harry and Hermione stood in front of this blackboard at first, with everyone else sat on the floor.
They were silent for a few minutes before Harry despairingly said, “If I promise that one day soon I’ll explain everything, will you guys just let this one go?”
“I only meant to ask, you see, in Beuaxbatons we do not do this spell? Er, I think it is the Surgito spell?”
“Si.” Remus, dear had said in the same exasperated voice her mum had just for her dad “Well, yes I suppose it has all been a big mess. Thank you for having tea with us”
They walked for a little way with no change to the scenery. Ginny repeatedly bounced up on her toes to try and see over the hedges, while Harry and Hermione walked a meter or so ahead of her, holding a muttered conversation under their breaths. They rounded to the left and a valley opened up below them, a small but sprawling tucked between two hills. Ginny could see a graveyard and a manor house clearly even from where she stood.
He was certainly looking at her like she’d been a fool. “I’m Harry.” He said, voice coming out scratchy.
"Okay" Neville drawled doubtfully, but everyone was obviously too exhausted to push the issue further than that.
Hermione insisted, looking about frantically as if someone might hear even though they hadn’t said a thing.
“He can’t get Hagrid fired, can he?” Hermione worried, flipping fervently through a book on Wizarding Law.
By the time mid-October rolled around the weather at Hogwarts had turned from mild and grey to miserable and ready to storm the Bastille. Hermione had woken up every morning that past week to the soothing sound of rain slamming against the girls dormitory window.
The surprise of this all was how willing Fred and George were to allow Ron to hang around them. Of course, there was a caveat. Ron became guinea pig numero uno.
The goblin blinked at him, and then spoke through a barely contained snarl. “We try to only bring one vault-owner down here at a time,
Hypnos weed was another option. Another powder that could be blown into a persons face which would cause them to fall asleep. But only for up to ten minutes, at most.
The second trial dawned at the end of February with a vengeance. The vengeance mostly consisting of it being bloody freezing.
“So, what?” Ginny said, apprehensive. She became even more apprehensive when Hermione unceremoniously pulled out a shovel from her bag.
Neville pushed the tapestry aside, revealing a staircase going up a few metres. He twisted his head slightly, looking up at the slightly curved stairway. There, about halfway up, was a doorway.
Neville had stepped backwards unconsciously; he could only barely feel the heat of the flames where he stood. But Harry was only a metre or so away, his face bathed in dancing light.
She started to feel a lot more sympathetic towards him, however, when Draco quietly told her that Halloween was the day Harry’s parents had died.
She looked at him with interest, pushing her mane of hair away from her face to give him her full attention. “Yes?”
Ron had a stomach of lead that could probably withstand a nuclear accident but even his digestive system winced in sympathy. There was only so long you could go as an Englishman, he hypothesised, before good ol’ bangers and mash became a necessary tool of survival.
“Why are we sneaking about again?” Ron muttered, following harry down the stairs. Ron noticed that his pyjamas were several inches too short, ankles on full display.
“I need to finish something. Something I started a long, long bloody time ago.” Harry looked exhausted, suddenly. As if he hadn’t slept.
Apart from when he remembered that based on the current situation his best friend might just be going to jail. It
Harry seemed equally happy to sit with her and talk about anything and everything, however. Instead of intensifying her crush, however, it cooled it slightly. Not because Harry had done anything wrong, but because it reminded her that Harry was still just a twelve-year-old boy, like her brother, even if he did seem older than that sometimes. He joked and talked and could get huffy sometimes, just like she could. And he loved quidditch almost as much as she did. It was hard to idolise someone when you’d spent three hours dissecting a Magpies v. Harpy game down to tiny details such as what socks Gwenogs was wearing and whether they were aero-dynamic. She started to think of him as just Harry, not Harry Potter-The-Saviour-of-The-Wizarding-World and her future husband.
“Yeah, about that” Harry said, returning to sheepish “We’re going to do something after this that’s…not adult approved if you catch my drift, Gin. It’s a personal mission.”
“Why is there a number 13 but not a number 12?” Hermione wondered in confusion. She’d seen streets that missed out on numbering a house 13, but not 12. What was wrong with the number 12?
“Logic,” Harry drawled back. A vein jumped in Snape’s forehead. Neville winced, shrinking back into the wall.
Draco groaned dramatically. Ron thought that most of his friends were pretty dramatic. It could be exhausting being the only one out of them that didn’t react to minor obstacles as if they were life-changing events. It was also slightly worrying that the only friend he found serenity with was Luna. That kind of fact could shake a boys sanity.
“What are you doing?” Ginny asked, curious. She supposed she should be more worried about the grave-robbing comment, but she knew despite their suspicious natures that Harry and Hermione weren’t bad people. If they were robbing a grave, there was probably a good reason.
Neville sighed, leaving forward to pluck a box off of the coffee table, “Remember when we said a relaxing Friday night with no war talk?” He held the box up, “Cluedo, anyone?”
Harry and Hermione shared a look. Ron felt his blood begin to simmer. “It’s Nothing.” Harry dismissed, glancing down at his potions essay shiftily.
Ginny frowned at the odd interaction, but was distracted by a short, balding man with a smoking camera shoving past her and Luna, pulling apart their joined hands. Ginny scowled at him and yelled ‘hey!’ but he ignored her.
Ginny blushed. Wasn’t that just the million-galleon question? At first it had been because it was easy to transfigure her crush on Harry into an obsession. Then it had continued simply because she was stubborn, or because it was sort of fun to go on stake outs with Colin and Luna. But why had she kept it up so long?
“It must be for the maintenance casters who keep the charm running,” Hermione had supposed, referring to the waterfall.
Scrooge was moaning as Harry began to pout. Hermione sighed. She was honestly far too much of a pushover.
“Yeah, yeah.” He leaned over to grab more food from Harry’s side of the table, mumbling as he did so. “I guess I missed you too, weirdo.”
“What’s going to happen in two days?” Ron snorted “’sides, I’d just go with you and ‘Mione if I couldn’t go home”
When she went to wash her hands Harry was hurriedly shutting his bag and standing awkwardly in front of the sinks.
Neville was silent for a long moment. He wondered how Harry knew. Had he read about it in one of the books about the war? The incident was often referred to as the last event of the Wizarding War. Or had he looked it up in the Newspaper archives contained in the Library? It did seem like something Harry would do. Unable as he was to let anything go.
A sudden laugh echoed around her head. One that she was almost certain hadn’t come from her own mind. A small, amused voice sounded suddenly in her ears.
“Ron” Her dads voice called, and she realised that her parents and other siblings had already left the shop “It’s mad in here. Come outside”
But the boy didn’t look like he wanted to run away from the redheads. In fact, his face screamed with the exact same expression her old cat had adopted anytime the fridge was opened. Pure, desperate wanting. Hermione watched, fingers itching to grab her notebook out of her rucksack so she could write down her observations and come to a correct conclusion about the mystery, when the boy turned his head-
Neville noticed that she looked rough. Her eyes were red-rimmed, smudges of eye-make up crowned her cheek bones. She had clearly been crying.
Luna didn’t like to go into Gringotts because she got motion sick, so they people watched instead. They made up ridiculous stories for the people passing by and anytime a person would enter the bank they would make wild guesses about what they were going to spend the money on.
In this life the defeat of evil is slow but succinct. No great loss of life, minimal collateral damage. With his intelligence comes what he has never had before; Coldness. Clarity. But it takes so many years. This boy keeps his blood cold when fighting flames and it leaves him frozen. This boy does not love, or cherish or mourn. This boy was smart, but so alone. What does he have? If not a flame, what is he?
“I have not heard a thing,” Fleur said bitterly, looking at her fireplace with a deep frown, “I have floo’d and sent letters- Nothing. I cannot get through to, to a
“Fine. I’ll come with you,” Harry shook his head, as if he hadn’t expected Neville to accept his earlier offer. “I’m coming with you, Harry,” Neville’s voice brooked no argument, he squeezed Harry’s wrist lightly, “I’m a little bit worried you’re about to off yourself.”
The cold light momentarily illuminated Harry’s head. For a single second Luna could swear she saw him older then he was- a young man instead of a young teenager. A bright white light lit him up from the inside out, his black curls and green eyes somehow luminescent, his chocolate skin golden. Then she blinked. The sun sunk further into the sky, shrugging off the day. Harry became the same worried by again.
Harry and Hermione both burst in to giggles, while Ron made a face. Ginny couldn’t help smiling a little too.
And you couldn’t be the little sibling of five brilliant brothers without thinking a lot about what must have gone so wrong with you.
That part of the night had been surprisingly quite educational. Hermione had begun to have doubts about the calibre of many Wizarding civil services ever since she had learned of the entire community’s existence.
“Don’t worry” Harry said comfortingly “She’s actually quite nice. I don’t think she wants to hurt anyone. She’s just been alone for so long”
Which was how Fleur Delacour became a more-often-than-not fixture in their defence classes, studying counter-curses as they did and often derailing the lesson by getting into lengthy debates with Hermione.
“Don’t worry” Luna said “Government corruption and inherent political bias towards the rich can’t be too hard to defeat”
“Well there isn’t a guide book exactly, is there?” Harry said, volume rising in frustration. “I just know that it was in the transfiguration book, last time. Then he put it in the cauldron”
A bucktoothed girl is born timid and the story changes again. Two boys die in a tricksters maze. Two candles streaming smoke into the sky in the name of protection. A bad ending.
Ron did react slightly to this. His face flushed a shade of orange to make the Chudley Cannons proud.
“Wotcher.” Tonks said, bubble gum hair vibrant in the otherwise drab classroom, “Sorry for being late. Wasn’t really planning on being here.”
Neville peered into it and spotted the little yellow cup they’d liberated from Bellatrix Lestrange’s vault resting on a pile of other objects.
“How important can it be?” Ron exclaimed with disbelief. He gestured at the mostly deserted room, “There’s no one here.”
Not out of cruelty, or vindictiveness. Not out of some fault, or chip on the soul. Human beings couldn't be all good all the time, or they wouldn't really be human at all. You had to be selfish too. Selfishness was healthy. Selfishness was animal.
Ginny shifted it awkwardly in her arms, and Harry’s gaze broke. He blinked, then looked up at her and gave her an abashed smile.
When Harry had paced three times he stopped and turned to the wall opposite the tapestry triumphantly. Ron and Hermione turned too and-
“Harry’s right. Mate” Ron said, and Luna got the quiet thrill she always did at being one of the few Ron called ‘mate’ “No one should be on their own at Christmas”
Also can you tell i love Fleur Delacour with my whole heart? please ask me about my little head canons discussing hp makes me so happy.
Luna shrugged, watching a murder of crows lift off suddenly from Hagrids’ pumpkin patch. “It has its pros and cons. All ethical theories do really. It’s meant to be helpful”
Ron felt someone trying to usher him away, heard words like ‘Aurors’ and ‘minister’, but he didn’t process it and he didn’t move. He just stared down at Pettigrew, who’s dish-water blonde hair was stained a dark drown with dried blood.
But the dragon doesn't know what I do. I have never found a world where Draco Malfoy doesn't fall in love with Harry Potter.
Despite its outside appearance, the inside of the townhouse wasn’t gothic at all inside. In fact, whoever had decorated it seemed to have only one goal in mind; to cram as many colours into as small a space as magically possible. The general appearance of the hallway was thus similar to a psychedelic trip circa the seventies.
“Don’t worry, don’t worry. I’m going to blind her. We found a spell before Christmas that would do it without too much pain. I was going to let her go at the end of the term. But I need her to leave now.”
They were outside by the lake, tightly wrapped in scarves and hats due to the icy weather- because Ginny had insisted that she had a surprise for them all. But she’d led Luna down a whole half-an-hour earler than she’d told the others to gather.
A short trip on the underground and a walk later (during which Hermione clutched her tote bag very tightly and kept close to an equally overwhelmed Ron) they found themselves standing in front of a crescent shaped cul-de-sac of posh three-story town houses. They were the types of houses that Russian oligarchs bought and never lived in but that no one else could ever actually afford.
falling out with Harry and Hermione was difficult because Draco was too practical to tread the line.
Luna blinked her eyes open, squinting against the sun. She’d been dozing in the garden, lying next to her mother’s tree. She sat up slowly, still half in her world of sun and dreams. Her dress snagged lightly on a tree root as she stood up. It had been her mothers, too, and fell almost all the way to the floor on Luna’s smaller frame. Sunset shades and handkerchief-hemmed, pixie-like as all her mother’s clothes had been.
Fred and George seemed to think Harry was brilliant, and Harry let them chat constantly about ideas they had for inventions and cool secret parts of the castle. Ginny had caught him staring oddly at Fred on numerus occasions, however, and she was beginning to consider if maybe she was barking up the wrong tree.
Colin had stopped with Luna, too. He was holding his camera up to take a picture of Luna. “Colin! Why are you taking a picture of
If it had been any other occasion Ron would have been split between insisting that Hermione was not is other half or teasing Draco for referring to Harry as such. Currently however he was split between those two options and a third, far more pressing mode of operation: continuing his sulk.
Ginny sped up, her feet slapping wetly against the floor. She wanted to catch up to Harry as soon as possible so that she could leave this place immediately. She followed the winding pipe, which bent this way and that seemingly on a whim. Finally, she turned a bend and caught sight of Harry, standing in front of a snake-decorated door. He was hissing at it.
“I—yes. It’s horrible.” Neville said, but his voice remained steady with the shock of Harry’s passion. “But my parents are still here. I love them, I know they love me. And I can see them. I wouldn’t trade that for anything.”
Because Neville knew one thing that wasn't very Gryffindor in spirit. You couldn't be good all the time. It just wasn't possible.
At many points in this chapter Ginny becomes the living embodiment of the Pepe Silvia scene from Its Always Sunny
They stood like that for a long while, Ron repeating his words and Harry crying. They would stay as long as needed, Ron thought. They were facing away from their friends where they stood, the view directly in front of them the gates of Hogwarts.
“Ronald. We talked about this” Ginny snapped. Ron rolled his eyes. Ginny had started a campaign to make Ron a feminist a few months back.
“No” She said, still watching him closely in case the sudden vision would reappear. She suspected it was just the usual influx of Christmas nargles “But I think some fifth years had the same idea last year”
The news had been broken by a lower ministry worker, who had been allowed to leave with the intention that he would spread the gospel. Voldemort had walked into the ministry and his only obstacle had been an underpaid man with a mop who had died easily. Voldemort had control of the ministry, and by default he had control of magical Britain.
He dies in a graveyard at fourteen. It is a mercy. The lovers saved from fighting on opposite sides of the war.
Harry had the look on his face of a man who desperately wanted to dispute something he knew was true.
“I don’t get it at all.” Harry said sharply, and Neville looked up at him with surprise.  “What your family went through- what you went through- Neville it was horrific. I say sorry,” Harry scoffed, “Like that means anything. My parents died senselessly, but at least—” He stops again, mouth pursed with unsaid words, “I’m so sorry. I can’t imagine the pain.”
Draco looked uneasy. He was British and exceedingly posh and also an only child and that was a combination that led to an iron inclination to never acknowledge difficult situations ever,
With a last sorrowful look around the hallway and up the stairs, Harry turned on his heels and walked through Hermione and Ron and back out the door.
Snape’s eyes crew closer together in suspicion. “What research would require an eleven-year-old boy to inquire in to the cost and distribution of a rare, advanced,
“Oh! Yes, that makes sense.” Tonks beckoned Fleur forward into the room. “Is this for your exploratory essay?”
Ron had never spent Christmas at Hogwarts before. When he’d mentioned this to Harry the chaotic boy had blinked slowly for a long moment, as if blinking away a film from his eyes, and then grinned widely.
“Will you try out for the team, this year?” She asked him over a morning cup of tea. Both Harry and she were early risers, whereas Ron could sleep a whole day away if no one woke him up. In the morning over a pot of tea and some of her mums’ scones was when they usually had their quidditch talks.
“Yep.” Harry said, popping the p and being altogether far to happy with himself. “Like if you really needed the bathroom it would become a toilet. Or a place to hide from Filch.”
dragon’ and—” Ron was saying loudly, hands flying in gesticulation. He paused when he noticed Harry had stopped. Harry had stopped abruptly when he saw Neville standing there.
Fleur Delacour had come out on top of the first task. Ron thought that this probably had something to do with her being close pals with a trained Auror and DADA teacher. Tonks had certainly cheered loudly every time Fleur had made a clever swerve or defence against the dragon. Harry had confided after his confession to Ron that he’d warned all the champions separately and ‘confidentially’ of what the first task would be.
“Like what?” Ginny, who couldn’t think of anything she cared about more than quidditch, almost yelled.
“When I was seventeen” Harry clarified “May of our seventh year” He frowned again “Not that we spent much time at school that year”
Neville nodded, touched by the thought and as always deeply uncomfortable at the idea of anyone going out of their way for him. He didn’t comment, though, not wanting to open up the opportunity for Ginny to ask how he was.
“Are you certifiably insane Harry Potter?” Hermione said. She perhaps got too heated over museums. It was a trigger spot for her.
“You. Are. Fucking. With. Me.” Ron says, holding four glittering galleons up to the hanging camping lantern.
Ginny paused in her reading, she had tears brimming in her eyes. The rest of them were deadly silent to, a mirage of stillness in the sudden heat.
Harry stared back at her, green eyes boring back into hers. They flicker, staring into her left eye, her right. Searching for the resolve she has hidden there. He blinks.
“Harry Potter does” Colin said, voice a little dreamy like it always was when he talked about Harry. Ginny had warned him of the boy multiple times to no avail.
terrifying, so they didn’t often have time to discuss their third project. Harry Potter’s crazy life.
The first edition of “The Hogwarts Oracle” was distributed outside the great hall in mid-February. Iphigenia Watts, a fifth-year half-blood Ravenclaw who Luna was secretly quite intimidated by, stood proudly on a soapbox advertising it. She was the editor-in-chief of the Oracle and never a more organised captain had there been. She kept a tight schedule, and an even tighter ship.
Draco sat next to Harry and Neville watched emerald eyes trail across Draco’s blazing hair. Neville could guess that Harry wasn’t just thinking about the sun.
She pulled him along the whole way to their destinations, hands swinging languidly in-between them. He seemed excessively uptight compared to her dreamy countenance and it made Luna laugh. She hoped she could inspire in Draco the ability to let go a little more. If he kept so wound-up at all times, he would develop muscle aches. No one ever remembered that emotions lived in the body as well as the mind.
Hermione waited patiently for a response. Harry only gaped at her. Then, in a cracking voice he said, “Yeah, s’pose. Magical accident.” and then it was as if an invisible mask had slipped over him, and he straightened up, looking surer than he had before. “Magical accident! And this…whole thing…is just a magical accident, right. And if it’s a magical accident, which you’re right absolutely do happen I can tell you for sure Hermione, then- then this is like-.“  He stopped trying to convince himself of whatever it was and looked startled. The next thing he said under his breathe, clearly meant only for him, but Hermione still caught it.
Harry looked at him, eyes wide. Harry had a habit of accidentally looking like a mad philosopher- his constantly messy crown of dark curls means that any time he looks slightly surprised he also looks intensely mad.
“Oh, god yeah.” Tonks laughed. “Look at me. Consummate professional, I am. I’m Tonks.” She flicked her wand at the blackboard and her name appeared there in chalk. “You can just go ahead and call me Tonks.”
“Luna” Ginny said, exasperatedly when Luna remained still despite her tugging “What are you looking at?”
“She’s just taking care of some stuff for me” Harry said, as if this wasn’t a shady thing to say “I was just making sure it was okay”
“Hogwarts is a weird bloody place,” Harrys aid, slapping Neville jovially on the back, “We have to go down there.”
Luna was sitting with Hermione and Draco in the Ravenclaw common room. Luna had been playing chess (and losing) against Draco when the letter had arrived from his father. The Gryffindor’s had promptly been summoned. According to Hermione Ron was unavailable due to having a detention. Apparently he had managed to annoy Snape in lesson. Harry had come with Hermione but had vanished mid research to gather food and as he put it ‘resources’.
He just shook his head, dismissing it. “Why won’t Dumbledore just cooperate with the ministry? Then Bones wouldn’t have to get underhanded.”
“So what I’m really asking right now…” Draco finished cautiously, “Is what’s got your knickers in a twist and what has it got to do with our misfit other halves?”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “So It’s probably actually safer for you to tell me. No offence, Harry, but you aren’t exactly a master chess player”
Neville laughed genuinely, “No, you don’t. But you do probably need to ask yourself who it is you do like. I’m sensing its not something you’ve thought very deeply about.”
Maybe she had just wanted something to do. Something that Bill or Charlie, or all her other brothers, had not done first. And she’d wanted to subvert herself. Wanted to prove that she wasn’t just a stupid girl with a crush on Harry Potter. If she uncovered some plot, or even if she just found out a mundane truth for herself, then it felt a little bit like she wasn’t wasting her existence. Or like she was finally living up to her family.
Hermione Granger had been sitting in her compartment, people watching, for only ten minutes when the thin boy with dark hair and skin a few shades lighter than hers appeared out of thin air. This, she was sure, was the sort of surprised reaction that would be worn out of her after even only a few days at Magic School. It was certainly a common occurrence, she was sure, for young boys to appear out of nowhere, looking stunned and horrified at their surroundings. Nothing to worry about.
He laughed suddenly, “It’s worked! It didn’t hurt her. Here, look.” Before Neville could do a thing Harry had ripped Neville’s blindfold down under his nose.
“You should. It isn’t a weapon. All it says is that the one to defeat the dark lord could have been any baby born in July with ballsy parents, and Voldemort picked me.”
Luna herself wrote articles about Magical creatures, as well as smaller sections about the undiscovered creatures she and her father searched for. She also helped with the current events team and helped Colin any time he needed a photography assistant. Her first article was a think peace about the gender-based morality of Unicorns and how it was uncomfortably binary.
Lucius Malfoy began his hardened campaign against Buckbeak and Hagrid in general in late November. Draco had been particularly annoyed because he couldn’t figure out who had informed his father about the incident. It wasn’t as if Hogwarts had a very strong policy of being transparent with parents.
Hermione had often hit the same wall during her twelve year and ongoing career as A Nosy Person. At one point or another, you would run into a situation that wouldn’t reveal the truth to you no matter how much you snooped or researched or made lists. In these situations, she found you had two options; 1. Let it go; 2. Trap the annoying truth with-holder in a room and bombard them with questions until they crack under pressure and tell you what she want to know.
“No idea.” Harry had yelled, grabbing Neville’s hand when they reached the end of the stairs and pulling him down the hallway they had entered. At one end of the hall-way shouts could be heard, and the ominous warning of running footsteps.
Hermione nodded and cut in “Yes. We’ve structured it as half a study group, half a lesson. We have a few people who’ve volunteered to do demonstrations for the first half hour, then for the hour after that it can be practice and study groups”
She caught a fleeting and incriminating glance of Harry Potter leaving the common room with a shoe box in his hands. A
“Just come on, Hermione. I’ll explain in a minute.” He said. She’d assumed he’d stop when they reached Ron, but instead he just grabbed a confused Ron’s elbow and started tugging at him too. He led the both, protesting of course, into the next exhibit before finally stopping and spinning around to face them.
She’d told him one of Ginny’s best jokes (though she thinks she may have gotten the punchline wrong) and made him a flower crown out of daisies to coax a smile from him.
“Ah!” Harry said, wiggling his finger like he was Sherlock Holmes explaining the case to a befuddled John Watson. “That’s what he
“Come on,” Harry said, stuffing his essay into his bag without delicacy. “Let’s go somewhere quieter.”
“Everyone knows that Fudge will just get re-elected. He’s been minster for two terms, and no one seems to hate him that much”
Ron had spent his entire life fighting for attention. Molly and Arthur spent his entire life battling to have enough money to feed seven, let alone enough attention to split equally seven ways. His mum loved them all equally, but time and energy was something she was poor in too. She had to put limited resources where it was needed; the careers of her eldest, Percy’s ego, the constant battle to keep Fred and George’s damage count low. Ron and Ginny had largely been left to fend for themselves. The babies. Ron and Ginny had been perpetually relegated into the ‘pick up and carry on hip from pace to place’ portion of Molly’s brain.
“You did call it a ‘great big beast’” Harry said loftily, sharply flicking a glossy magazine page over.
It must have been the final stage of a ritual. The first nine muggles, bodies twisted and blood drained, then the seven in Amsterdam with their eyes carved out, the French five who’s tongues had been severed, the three Wizards dead in their homes. Then Pettigrew. Were those the ingredients to make a man? And what kind of man would that make?
“A healthy activity for any teenager,” A drawling voice called to them. They both looked over their shoulders. There friends were walking towards them, Draco at the helm. The dying sun lit up his white blonde hair, giving his smirk a devilish nature, “How morbid, Potter.”
“And Nev if it comes to it.” Ron said, and Neville rolled his eyes and gave him a friendly whack on the back of his head.
“It’s my father” Draco said dismally “He has half the Wizengamot in his pocket not to mention the sway he has over the school board”
In the next silence black holes were formed and died. The longest living killer whale was born and died peacefully in his sleep, finally becoming one with the earth and the sea floor as he’d always dreamed he would as a baby killer whale.
But there was another reason you couldn't be good all the time. Solutions weren't always about doing the good thing. They were about doing the better one. Sometimes you had to do something bad. And you had to do bad things even when they kept you awake at night. Even when you'd really rather not, and the good thing would have weighed much lighter on your soul. You had to trust people to have good reasons for bad actions.
Harry shuddered and made an odd face, “I think we should all be very glad we got the Hogwarts champion we did.”
The problem she had was that she couldn’t just simply stop being friends with Harry or start disliking him for what he might cause. Harry was her best friend. Someone who seemed to fully accept her, warts and all, for the first time in her life. They’d only known each other for three months but she already knew that losing Harry Potter as a friend would make her life just a little bit worse all round.
Sirius gave him a puzzled look, his eyes searching. “Course I worry, Nev. You’re one of my lot now, crazy little pack that we are.”
“It’s Pettigrew, isn’t it?” Hermione asked, but it didn’t sound like a question. She sounded resigned to the fact.
Neville looked out at the lake, the sun half visible at its edge, and he felt that tender thing curl around his burning heart. The hope Luna had written about. And although he was afraid of the future, so desperately afraid, he was something else to. Something stronger.
“Wish I could enter,” Ron said wistfully, because one thousand galleons was a lot of Brand New Things and getting things new was a rare occurrence in Ron’s life. “It doesn’t seem hard.”
And it’s not like she meant to eavesdrop. She’d just been doing her regular mid-morning sweep of the kitchen for food, still dressed in her pink pygmy puff pyjama’s and with her hair sticking up everywhere from sleep. She’d picked up the jam jar intending to slather it on some toast and eat in front of the wireless. Then she’d heard voices right outside the door, her mother’s and some men who were definitely
“That’s what you came for?” Ginny said, surprised. Hermione was rummaging around in her back pack. Finally, she pulled out a metal box with a heavy hinge and a pair of tongs. “What are those for?”
Harry glanced up, catching the blonde boys’ eyes, who smirked at him. Harry chuckled “Yeah, weirdly, it is”
The worst, most terrible, no-good, awful, bad thing about Harry Potter was that Hermione couldn’t help but like him. However many times a day she found herself questioning the boys sanity, truthfulness or general real-ness as a person she just couldn’t seem to stop letting him hang around her. This was probably since Harry seemed to genuinely want to hang around her. Something that had never happened to her before. Harry happily asked her questions about the books she read, her family, and her theories on magical history and its relation to the muggle counterpart.
Ginny knew that her mother’s family, the Prewetts, had a history of squibs. She’d heard a story once from Charlie, who had supposedly heard it from a drunk Prewett uncle at one of the many Prewett weddings, about a hag that had cursed the family over a stolen piece of jewellery. Ginny knew her mother was intensely proud that all seven of her children were magical.
Instead, he could hear the haughty, practically RP, accent floating out of the mirror and he connected that particular lazy smile of Harry's to the only person it was ever directed at.
Harry looked conflicted for a few moments, but finally his expression relaxed. “Thank you, Professor. I wish I’d known her”
Hermione hissed something back at Harry, but she couldn’t catch it. They continued their whispered conversation for a while, only stopping when a house elf came over to give them some biscuits. Hermione thanked him profusely and then turned back to Harry frowning.
“That would be terrible,” Luna murmured. Worry always looked out of place on Luna’s face. She never seemed to worry about anything at all.
Harry looked back at her with a cheeky grin and tapped his nose. “Ixnay on the uestion-qay, Hermione.”
“You would think that would make her hate muggles more.” Neville said, who had been frankly baffled by that movie.
The backyard of the grooms’ London townhouse had been magically enlarged and transformed by an ardent team of magical wedding planners. On the morning of the big day they could be found running around the place like headless chickens, casting rain repellent charms and creating makeshift golden awnings over everything they could.
“And where does a curious thing like you belong, eh? Don’t worry youngling, you’ve got the right of it. You
“Merci, ma petite fleurs.” Fleur said, smiling beatifically. She reminded Ron of a fairy queen greeting her subjects.
Harry winced, “You aren’t going to listen to me if I tell you it’s just a really big spider I caught, right?” He sighed at her continued look of disbelief. “No, I didn’t think that one would work on you, Hermione."
It wasn’t as though the two girls had suddenly realised that they were incredibly similar- they weren’t- or that they had changed at all, but as the days went on they began to put more effort into getting along. They didn’t have a natural friendship, but they had both learned that it was a friendship they were willing to try and work at.
Ron Weasley, who had dirt on his nose and a fat brown rat on his lap, seemed equally as baffled by Harry as Hermione was. Despite the boy’s insistence that Hermione had people she needed to meet, and the suspicious way he’d headed straight for this compartment, the two boys didn’t actually seem to know each other.
The door materialises, and it’s different to the door that appears when they practice for DA. It’s light, sunshine yellow pine. She pushes it gently and it swings wide open.
Oliver Wood had been recruited to do Quidditch, with Ginny set to take it up after he left at the end of that year.
When Harry came to the end of his magazine, he closed it wearily and finally gave Draco his full attention. Draco soaked it up greedily while trying to pretend he wasn’t.
Draco was still as ashen as he’d been when Flitwick had held court in the common room. He tentatively placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder and whispered “It isn’t your fault”
“What’s that about” George said, as their mother rummaged busily through her seemingly endless handbag.
“Bet mum wasn’t happy.” Ron said, purposefully avoiding the tight feeling Harry’s words had caused in his chest.
This boy is placed in the House of badgers. He makes good friends, he is kind and he is diligent and for just a few short months this boy is shown a world where kindness isn't rationed. He is happy. But kindness won't do as bravery will in the face of danger; It will save as many souls as possible even if it means sacrificing it's own. Harry Potter walks into that maze of traps alone. He doesn't get to the stone, or the enemy waiting at the end. His life is snuffed out somewhere along the way. Something innocuous, a plant or a chess piece or a potion. An extinguisher on a flame. It isn't a painless death, but he is spared much that would have broken this boy. It is not painless, but it is kind.
Nev blushed fiercely, as he did any time Ginny so much as looked at him “J-Just going to my Grans, as usual”
Neville couldn’t help noticing the curl of Harry’s hair, even though his whole face was scrunched in discomfort.
to get them or something bad will happen in the future.” He glanced at Ron and winced. “Erm. I’m guessing. Anyway. The diadem is one, but there’s another one in an abandoned house about 20 minutes from here. If we dash and get it, then come back, that’ll be two I’ve got.”
Draco grinned at Harry. Ginny had noticed that Draco hardly ever took his eyes of Harry. She would sometimes spot him watching Harry at dinner or staring at him across the hall when he was forced to sit at Ravenclaw. He had that same look in his eyes now; it was greed. Or perhaps more rightly, it was wanting. Ginny filed that little piece of information away in case she needed it later.
“Never work with kids or beasts.” Draco said sagely, and Tonks nodded emphatically. Tonks and Draco had an odd relationship. They were first cousins but had never met before the year’s start. They had tea together fortnightly. Draco said it was only now becoming less awkward.
Sometimes it was the right thing to do. And good and right, bad and wrong weren't two sides of a dividing line. They were jumbled. The unquantifiable fading moment between dark and dawn. Odd socks mixed up in a washing basket, never to match correctly again because one of the pair was inevitably lost down the back of something.
So no one could blame her for eavesdropping. After all it was her mum who kept insisting that Ginny’s self-consciousness was a natural part of puberty. She also kept insisting that Ginny’s penchant for mid-morning, mid-afternoon and late evening snacks was due to her being a ‘growing girl’ but Ginny was pretty sure it was just because she really liked food.
Dumbledore assessed Harry languidly, his whole body relaxed apart from his intense blue eyes. “Love is the most powerful thing in the world.”
Draco seemed poised to say something at first but held his tongue. As the first side of the record played out he relaxed too, and closed his eyes, a soft smile swimming about his lips. She watched the sky of his face clear and become just as blue as the album they were listening to.
Harry nodded. “You’ve done really well, Kreacher. But I’m going to destroy it. I need you to give it to me so that I can do what Regulus wanted.”
“Ah, my boy. I find that usually when we say something isn’t personal, it tends to be incredibly so.”
Her surprise must have shown on her face because Harry gave her a sympathetic look “If it makes you feel better, I literally learned about the existence of fairies like three months ago”
Luna watched Hermione and Harry exchange one of their patented Shared Looks and she laughed to herself, prepared for whatever crazy answer they were going to give.
Ron Weasley is the sixth son of a second son. The storybooks will tell you that there is nothing special about this. They’d be right. There is nothing special about Ronald Weasley’s birth.
“Come on” Ginny said, tugging Luna’s hand. Luna had gotten distracted by something out on the grounds and Ginny hadn’t noticed she was walking alone until she reached the end of the corridor and looked back. It was pretty embarrassing. She’d continued talking to herself that whole time.
She also tended to accidentally go off on tangents about something completely unrelated to the lesson plan. It was obvious that she adored Defence and even more obvious that she adored it in a practical and theoretical sense and academically. Tonks wanted to talk about the far-reaching implications of one tiny piece of defensive magical theory and then spend the lesson experimenting. She did not seem as happy to spend the lesson teaching them basics that she already knew back to front, even if they didn’t.
“No.” Harry breathed out. His fingers were white knuckled on the paper, crumpling the pages under his grip. “No, this didn’t happen last time.”
Hermione and Ron stared at him. It wasn’t that she didn’t believe him. She did believe him. But she could also tell when she was being condescended too and when someone was omitting parts of the truth.
“Yes. Nymphadora suggested it and I thought, perfect! I applied to Dumbledore and now that I have won, he cannot refuse I’m sure.”
There was another laden silence, then Hermione sighed, pulling her bag towards her. From its depth she pulled a spiral bound notebook. Ron recognised it as one of her ‘Harry’ notebooks.
“Doesn’t it bother you?” Ron prompted, “What is it that they won’t tell us? I thought they were going to finally come clean at the world cup but, well—”
Neville had been impressed, and he and Ron had tried to ask Hermione to explain how it all worked but gave up soon on understanding. Neville wished Creevey was here with his camera.
“Wotcher,” Tonks said, seemingly on reflex, “What’s up?” She paused, scrunching her nose up. Her hair shifted into a black French bob. “Puis-je aider?” she said in a tragically midlands accent.
Ginny zoned out, shifting her head to look around the shop. There was a second landing where she knew they kept all the fiction books and even some muggle books too. Leaning over the gallery balcony was a boy with white blonde hair, smiling down at Harry with amused and exasperated softness. It took a moment for Ginny to place him before it finally came to her- The fourth person in Ron’s photograph. The boy who made Harry laugh. What had Ron said his other friend was called? Drake?
To be truly honest it wasn’t the voice which made her get up. She had been pretty comfortable after all. It was the wafted scent of pumpkin pasties carried on the wind. This meant one person- Harry- and meant one thing- Harry
Hermione gave Harry a tight smile when he grinned at her with megawatts. He didn’t seem to notice that she wasn’t returning it equally as brightly.
But in her mother’s laboratory a purple cloud had filled the whole room, engulfing Luna in its horrifying permanence. Changing her life with a single bad spell.
Not to mention, he was getting really sick of walking into rooms and having everyone go silent. One day he would figure out what the hell Hermione, Ron and Harry found it so pertinent to shut up about as quickly as they always did.
At least, that’s what she’d observed from being around these particular boys. Ron and Draco had spent their first week of acquaintance on a path to mutually assured destruction. In fact Hermione had found herself considering the intelligence of becoming close to either of them, when it was clear that they would never be able to remain cordial around each other. It was only ever going to end in disaster. Then came the chess match. Ah, that first tense chess match. Half of Gryffindor tower had gathered to watch the youngest Weasley just marginally triumph over the first Malfoy in a century not to be sorted into Slytherin at a game of Wizard’s chess. Hermione had truly believed that Draco would up and leave the Gryffindor tower never to be seen again. Instead, the boy had grinned a rare real grin and held out his hand for Ron to shake.
“Have you ever heard of a student newspaper being run at Hogwarts?” Harry asked, voice laced with obviously forced nonchalance.
Now Luna, the only one still sitting down apart from Neville, was interested. She walked over and picked up the map from the floor. It was a detailed map of Hogwarts and its grounds with labelled footsteps trailing all across it. The grounds were sparse with names, so she quickly spotted the name that had made Harry react like this.
The Professor had driven them from King’s cross station in a yellow mini that both he and Harry had reffered to as ‘Sharon’. Professor Lupin had explained that Sirius had named it Sharon back when Remus had acquired it in 1979, and it had unfortunately stuck..
Which left his family. He supposed there was one upside to having multiple members of your family at school with you. It’s just there were so many, many downsides it was hard to remember anything else.
But her favourite place was always resting beneath her mothers tree. On her own. After her mothers death three years earlier her body had been buried in the garden and a sapling had been planted as a marker. Now a blackthorn tree stood tall, taller than it should have been, as if it had grown by magic. Luna had been allowed to choose the tree type; she’d spent a whole day pouring delicately through her mother’s books on trees until eventually she picked the blackthorn. For witches and for winter-- her mothers birth season and favourite time of year.
They were in the Room of Requirement, which currently had changed to a perfect blend of the Ravenclaw and Gryffindor common rooms, with cosy chairs and a fireplace but shelves of books lining the walls. The blue and red was slightly clashing, however.
“What happened?” Hermione asked the Weasley siblings softly, Harry and Draco similarly next to them to give Nev and Luna some small privacy.
He spun Harry around in his embrace, Harry laughing loudly and smacking the older man’s back. When he put Harry down, he ruffled his hair, before kissing Professor Lupin soundly on the lips.
Harry did so, tongue caught between his teeth in concentration. He carefully moved the innocuous ring box from it’s hiding place into the box Hermione was holding. Then Hermione latched the box quickly, as if she thought the ring might somehow try and escape and cast a colloportus spell on it.
It wasn’t that she looked dramatically different. It was just that she looked so absolutely Hermione that it- and here was anther overused phrase- took his breath away.
“Yes. But remember; You don’t know how things will go this time. Anyway, what on earth do you know about politics?”
No one asked why a muggle-born girl knew about the tortured Dragon in the lower basements of an ancient Wizarding institution. She knew Harry Potter after all. She could be trusted.
Then he realised what he was doing and dropped his smile abruptly. He turned back to the front, mood dampened again.
“See ya.” He mumbled, turning an about face to head out of the library. He absently noticed that Victor Krum was glaring at him, but he was hardly focused on that.
“True, cos.” She said, fluffing up his hair, “Plus I miss the field. Nah, I’m going back to badger poor Mad-eye. He says he hasn’t missed me, but I can see the sorrow in his eyes.”
“You have to. Go back. I will follow you; I promise. I won’t even be a moment behind.” Harry wasn’t looking at him anymore. He was raising his wand, closing his eyes as if to begin a complex chant.
“And that’s only the longest recorder, not the usual. I’d say we would have seven minutes.” Neville shrugged.
Remus laughed, rapping his knuckles against the doorjamb. “Bye, Draco. And you two, be downstairs in twenty.”
“Well, well, well- Arthur Weasley” A cool voice interrupted. Ginny watched all the blood drain from Draco’s face.
He knew Harry didn’t believe it, but Ron would say it until he did and that was what mattered. That one-day Harry might believe he was worthy of a forgiveness he already had.
But there are things you teach intentionally, and things you teach by your own unconscious action. It went the other way too. There were things you knew you knew, and there were truths that stayed hidden just under your thoughts for the whole of your life. A layer beneath your own skin that even you don’t know is there. Truths you learned before you were even old enough to remember the occasion, but which you always carried with you.
Since mid-February Neville had learned far too much about muggle disguise and make-up FX. Neville had a frankly terrible prosthetic nose and thick, bush eyebrows. He was wearing his own green contacts.
“They’re a strain of fruit bat specially bred by the Russian Wizarding Government who listen in on conversations and then report back to their leaders. They used them extensively during the Wizarding Cold war. Everyone knows that” Luna said absentmindedly, her focus on a fluffy white cat that was rolling about in front of the Owl Emporium.
“Why did you have to kick her out?” Neville asked softly, when Harry came back to him. The thought had also been bugging him.
But Hermione, Harry, Draco and Ron had formed an easy, if often jovially combative, quartet. Harry seemed to be already attuned to all of Hermione and Ron’s quirks and demeanours, and well versed in how to handle them. He often seem baffled by Draco’s very presence though, despite being the one who had initially introduced them all. Any time that the Ravenclaw boy would make a joke that made Harry laugh, or go an extended period without making a snide comment about Hermione’s heritage or Ron’s family, Harry seemed to have an internal crisis. Hermione had noticed that Harry tended to periodically find the closest rain-soaked window to stare dramatically and stoically out of and this always increased anytime he seemed befuddled by something. She attributed this to him being a boy, and therefore inept at handling his own emotions.
“Do you have it here?” Ginny asked, pulling Luna’s crocheted bag towards her. She pulled out a roll of fresh parchment. “This it?”
Harry shrugged “I heard she got a job at some prestigious university” A murmur of disgruntlement went through the crowd “Anyway with this group we’ll hopefully be able to pool our knowledge and resources and keep on track. Older students can help the younger students, classmates that understand the material can help those who don’t”
Ron looked up into the worried faces of Luna and Ginny. They had crowded around him. Pansy was clutching her hands together, tightly, her usually dark skin pale and clammy.
before she closed the portrait hole with a soft click and backed away. She had a lot to think about.
Draco sat down in the other chair and stared in trepidation at the turntable. “How do you get it to play music?”
Harry’s eyebrows shot up “Hermione made a list abut me being an eldritch being” He laughed “Well. I can’t say I’m entirely surprised”
Ron suggested the sleepover a few weeks before exams and they decided to hold it on Friday. The Gryffindor bunch trekked over to pick up Draco and Luna from Ravenclaw, and they filed in a line of two’s towards the room of requirement- ducklings trailing behind Harry.
The first lick of flame crested over the edge of the cauldron. Neville could swear that dancing eyes watched him for within the flame. It was almost anticlimactic- that sweet orange dance of fire.
She had accepted rather early on what her future would look like. Birthday teas with just her parents. Sitting alone on the buses to school trips.
Ron surged forward, flinging himself off the desk. He snatched the letter out of David’s hands, eyes scanning passed the useless information from David’s aunt until he reached the crucial information.
Ginny had been in this bathroom a few times, mainly when she had charms and desperately needed the bathroom, so she knew that the sink didn’t usually have a hole in it like that. She rushed forward, and peered down into—
It didn’t matter that the sun was only now coming up, they all diligently followed mum into the house and off up to bed. Ron’s last thought before his head hit the pillow and he drifted off into sleep was of his interrupted talk with Harry and Hermione.
He frowned at the stopped cart. Neville took a deep breath, but the snob back into place, “Why have we stopped?” He barked shrilly. Harry gave him an impressed look.
Hermione and Ron met eyes over Harry’s head. Sometimes it seemed like all they did was look at each other in confusion or frustration over Harry’s behaviour. Now they both shared matching looks of concern.
“What? Why? You’re a great flyer” She said, frowning. They’d played a lot of three-a-side quidditch in the back garden, roping in Percy or Luna to play. Usually Harry’s team won, though this was possibly because Luna was an awful seeker. She oftentimes got distracted by cool clouds.
“Harry.” Ron said, shaking his best friend slightly. Harry pried himself away, eyes red and puffy, he turned to look.
It was strange. There was nothing extraordinary about Ronald Weasley. There should never have been anything special or extraordinary about him or his life at all. And yet—
Neville Happily worked with Professor Sprout to create a “Fun Herbology Facts!” two-page spread which proved surprisingly popular.
Then he sat down rather ungracefully next to Hermione and proceeded to begin a two-hour conversation about the book, magical theory as a whole, and Hogwarts. This surprisingly interesting conversation was interspersed by Harry’s strangely effective attempts to interrupt Ron and Malfoy’s, who it turned out was called Draco, barbs at each other’s families.
Ron had almost expected Percy to throttle Harry for ruining the sparkly clean image of his boss, before he’d realised that was stupid. Percy believed in rules above all else. He was upset because his idol had broken them,
“No,” Harry said harshly. Neville looked at him in surprise. He looked oddly determined, but also slightly green. “She’s dead.”
On it had been drawn a diagram of a cart. Just like the goblin-driven carts you had to get into every time you went a Gringotts vault. In the corner Hermione had scribbled an appreciative
Harry would put his hand up to ask her questions such as “What’s a death eater’s favourite colour?” and “are you or are you not a secret death eater in disguise?”
Hermione shrugged, giving up a half smile “You can go tell Ron if you want. But I’m the one who has you currently trapped in a classroom.” He laughed “Harry. I want to help you”
“Yes she’s an excellent teacher,” Hermione said, looking far off, “But I suppose this begs the question; what are they doing instead to track us?”
“Actually,” Hermione said, looking at Ron with imploring doe-eyes, “We’ve been meaning to talk to you for while.”
“Where-?” Hermione said, staring at the tea with wonder. Her hair was frizzed chaotically about her head.
Then they were back at the cart. They all heaved it back onto the track, this time facing the other way, and dropping the goblin into the driver’s seat. They climbed in after, Ron muttering, “twenty minutes, twenty minutes,” Under his breathe like a crazed person.
The next occurrence in the Great Saga of Harry Potter came after potions on the Friday before Halloween. Harry was usually the first one out of the doors of the potion’s dungeon when the bell for the end of the period went. They’d had it first today, so everyone else had taken their time packing up and talking to their friends before walking to wherever it was they would usually spend their breaktimes. Hermione had expected to pack up her equipment before walking out into the hallway with Ron and Draco to find an uncomfortable Harry waiting for them, as always. This day went differently.
“Well we didn’t want to—” Ginny said, looking awkward, “Harry thought it would be better if you could, you know, grieve quietly.”
Tonks was such a mess it was almost reassuring. She knocked over books, scattered parchment, spilt ink. Neville wondered how you could be an Auror when you couldn’t traverse a classroom without tripping at least three times. But he had seen her brutal efficiency, the strength in her casting.
” He whimpers from the floor. His hands are bound with a silver chain (“Anti-Animagus charms” Auror Tonks had explained.) “I’m your friend”
The room was split between wary apprehension and wary interest. “But muggle stuff doesn’t work around Hogwarts” George pointed out “Though I really want to see more of that Star Wars stuff”
Ginny Weasley maybe didn’t know it consciously, and her brothers certainly didn’t teach it consciously, but she knew it either way.
Ron just observed it, laughing and smiling at the family banter. It was nice to see Harry when he relaxed like this, like he was a kid instead of the odd old-soul behind a scrawny fourteen-year-old façade he usually was.
“Oh, god,” Hermione said now, as they hurried behind Harry to where he apparently was sure the Lestrange Vault was.
His eyes glazed over. Like he was staring at something Hermione couldn’t see. Suddenly, he turned to her, a full-body grin overcoming him.
Harry was quiet for a while, watching the sky. “If you had to do something really bad but you knew that doing it would bring a lot of good in the long run, would you do it?”
Then Neville had brought out his best snob. He did an excellent snob. You couldn’t be raised by someone like his Grandmother without being able to pull snob out of your back pocket any time you needed.
Hermione looks like maybe she does though, and gives Ginny a half smile “Did you never just think of locking him in a room and interrogating him till he told you?”
Draco had followed them to their tent in the after-game commotion, but he’d been gone for a few hours now. Knowing Lucius Malfoy he already had gold leaf adorned missing posters hung up.
“Yeah you weren’t all big fans of her last time.” Harry had said with a laugh. “It’s weird to see Hermione and Gin get on with her so well.”
“No,” Neville huffed, “Where are you going?” His voice was harsher than he felt he had ever been in his whole life. He was shocked by his own vehemence.
Harry and Hermione looked at her as if they’d just been caught mutilating a dead body, instead of standing over her school cauldron. Hermione had a hand behind her back and Ginny frowned at it intently.
Luna stayed silent, really thinking about what Harry was suggesting. Luna knew that freedom of information was as important a human right as any other, and that in politically tense situations it became paramount to a society’s progression. Without an honest and unbiased source of information, anything and everything could be twisted and corrupted to suit a party of power’s motivations. Luna wasn’t stupid. She knew about the rumours of brewing war that had plagued her entire childhood.
“It’s brilliant to have you girls here” Sirius said brightly “Your mum called this morning and said they got to France at 4am today, Hermione. She seemed happy”
Harry stared blankly at the mirror for a second, and then he was up and running over to their bag of stuff. He threw out bags of popcorn and snacks, scattered a pack of snap cards across the floor, and then finally he pulled out an old piece of parchment. He clutched it with relief.
The tunnel finally began to level out, and Neville dropped out gently into a small ante-chamber. “You’re lucky we’ve cleaned this place up.” Harry said, looking at the floor as if reminiscing about something. He gave a light shudder, “That did not use to be such a pleasant landing. Here, take one of these,” Harry handed him a small drawstring cloth bag. Neville took it with curiosity, “We started keeping that down here because of Hermione. She put a cushioning charm on the landing as well.”
“Excusez-moi? Professeur Tonks?” Fleur inquired politely, flicking her sheet of perfect silver hair over her shoulder, “Are you free?”
They had recruited of a substantial group people to the paper before Christmas, and in January they had their first meeting. Kassandra had decked out a newly-dusted abandoned classroom with two neat rows of desks, an oversized blackboard and an army of magical type-writers. The classroom next door had been turned into a printing room/dark room which had left Colin close to tears. On the doors to the rooms Iphegenia had proudly spelled a sign reading
Ten years of being the younger and only sibling of six brothers had taught Ginevra Weasley (who had been only 5 years old when she realised the full extent of her hatred towards her full name) several important lessons that she would carry through her entire life.
“Especially those in power with active death eater sympathies.” Hermione said, looking at Draco cautiously. “Sorry, Draco.”
Hermione blinked. “I could have just told you all that,” She whispered, even though she knew she hadn’t.
“Let’s take that as a failure,” George said, stifling a laugh. Fred came trudging up the stairs ten minutes later, looking appropriately beaten down.
“I bet you two galleons that Ireland catches the snitch before Krum.” Harry said, baring his teeth as he bit into a red liquorice wand.
Later that night Ron and Harry waited until the rest of the boys had headed to bed and no sound could be heard, before the snuck down to the common room.
For Ron’s birthday back in March they’d held a little party back there in the middle of the night. Harry had ferried them all around with his cloak (a gift he’d received anonymously on his return after Christmas) and Hermione had supplied a silencing charm. They’d had chocolate cake supplied by the house elves, told alternating muggle and wizarding ghost stories and then rounded it out with a round of happy birthday and Oh, he’s a jolly good fella. They’d all, giggling, stuffed themselves under the cloak and ran when Ron had insisted that he’d heard Filch coming, even though they never actually saw him as they ran back to Ravenclaw to drop Draco off.
“I’m Patrick. This is my wife Jean” Said the overwhelmed man. Patrick shook his fist lightly “And yes, we were going to try and change this lot over”
To which Neville happily changed back to his own polite persona, thanking the goblin for his excellent service. Then he’d grabbed a random object from the piles of old things and hurried his way back up to the surface, meeting the trio in Fortescues.
He broke off, eyes drifting over to look at the wall of collected Ravenclaw paraphernalia. Or perhaps it was propaganda. Or just the impedimenta of a hundred or more lonely intellects trying to share a thought with a non receptive world. Luna didn’t turn to see what he was looking at but just watched his face instead. How every emotion danced across the delicate bones built below translucent skin. Draco always gave off the initial impression of chill—it was why people like Ginny, who was all fire, took immediate dislike to him. He seemed insular and arctic. But it was an illusion—a trick of the light which danced off his sharp angles. Draco wasn’t cold- and he wasn’t fire like Ginny or sunshine like Harry or rainstorms like her mother had been- he was the sky. Ever changing and ever moving. Grey to blue to pink to apocalyptic red. Changing with moods and feelings and winds. Hidden by flimsy clouds.
I want to cry for this universe. I want to shed hot tears onto the scribbled tale of this life and watch the paper warp itself into waves. I want to watch them crash against their bindings and break free.
Ginny’s first month at Hogwarts- where of course she was sorted into Gryffindor- was eventful in all the common ways. She found herself lost more often than she found her way to her intended destination; she caught flack from teachers that held grudges against her siblings (in Fred and George’s case that read; all of them) and hopeful praise from those that wanted her to be just as talented as Bill, or as passionate as Charlie, or as helpfully sincere as Percy; she ate the marvellous food and yet still found it lacking compared to her mums’; she danced the awkward first-weeks-together dance with her roommates and then whenever she could she fled to Ravenclaw tower to talk to Luna.
Harry Potter never seemed to cease in his endless crusade to frustrate her. She was becoming used to his almost constant look of panic after he did or said something, like he felt he shouldn’t have. He seemed absolutely thrilled to personally greet and chat with everyone they crossed paths with, as if he was reuniting with lost friends. Sure, whatever, Hermione was all for socialisation but there
They left Draco with Blaise and Pansy- who he caught up with every so often to hear the pureblood gossip- and snuck off to their now familiar classroom on the seventh floor.
But in this story a bespectacled boy with threadbare jeans was shown the value of kindness by well meaning strangers. An old man opening the door, a young women offers him a sweet. This Harry Potter hoards kindness the way his cousin hoards broken toys and he replicates it.
She’s just coming up to the weeping willow when she spots them. They appear out of mid air next to the tree and Harry stuffs something silky into his pocket. An invisibility cloak, she thinks in surprise. Hermione, who’s tied her mane of hair back into two neat buns and who’s wearing an outfit reminiscent of a muggle spy, is laden with a ginormous back pack. Harry picks up something from the ground and throws it at the tree. The tree freezes.
Hermione had absolutely no clue what she was looking at. But Harry’s reaction was enough for her to know that it was another of his clearly dastardly schemes.
Alas, Ron’s rat didn’t show up. Ron seemed rather more bothered about his older brother Percy’s reaction to the missing pet, however, than its actual wellbeing. Hermione, a consummate only child, was not one to judge. Siblings could be very stressful as her mother told her every time her dad came home from Aunty Helen’s in a huff.
Harry shot another blasting charm at the tree. It came away only lightly scorched. Either Harry wasn’t putting his full power behind the curse, which in his rage didn’t seem likely, or Dumbledore had had the foresight to charm all the trees for this very reason. Teenage angst could be environmentally damaging.
They’d simply been taking a couple hours to relax with her dads trusty Christmas songs mixtape on in the back ground. Hermione was reading, Ron was eating and Harry, apparently, was
“Are you…okay?” She said, and then it all came out of her in an unstoppable Hermione-style Ramble. “It’s just, I saw you appear on the platform. And I’m sure that’s normal, for magically imbued folk or whatever, its just you looked shocked, and so I thought maybe it was an accidental appearing, or that you’d appeared somewhere wrong. But you do look like someone heading to Hogwarts, I thought with your clothes you must have muggle parents but then you said merlin so I thought, of course, magical accident. Because wizards must have accidents too, right? Like high speed broom collisions and accidental tax avoidance and magicking yourself into tight corners. That must be it, right? A magical accident.”
“Not that long, quite.” A voice said from the doorway. Remus stood leaning inside the door frame, smiling mildly.
Ron and Harry caught up to them now, both in their own disguises, and they all began to edge their ways along the stone walls, walking as fast as they could.
Hermione, and he had known it was her even before Harry had said her name, sighed, “Yeah, sorry. I know you’ve been stuck on that.”
They went on a few rounds, everyone having a go. Only Harry and Ginny choosing dare which led Harry licking Hermione’s shoe and the funny and teetering sight of Ginny trying to balance on the tallest stack of pillows she could make. The truths were simple and often funny- just targeted questions to make fun of embarrassing things they’d done in front of each other.
Luna didn’t know how Harry knew the date, but she appreciated it. It was never nice to be alone in ones wn grief. It was even worse to have to speak grief out loud into the world. Re’live it with every explanation.
He didn’t split his time between a sulking Ron and a worried Harry and Hermione. He rolled his eyes and told Ron to get over it and stop messing up the ‘dynamic’ and then he left to talk about some muggle band with Luna. The Buzzdicks or something.
Ron groaned. Percy had been practically unbearable all summer. When Draco had joined them earlier, they’d spent a good half-an-hour reenacting some of his greatest moments of prattish superiority. Fred and George had delighted in helping out. Ron thought that if they weren’t so bloody good at inventing, the twins might have a promising career in the theatre.
“My godfather.” Harry said distractedly, and before either of them could parse this he was striding towards the door. “Come on.”
“Malfoy!” He said, surprise evident in his face. Then it seemed to drain suddenly of all colour. “Er…nice to see you… since we last saw each other… at …. Madam Malkin’s?”
“Cheer up, mate” Harry said, smearing jam on Ron’s nose. Ron batted uselessly at his hand “We’re seeing Hermione, today”
Harry nodded, then dived in to an explanation and demonstration of the spell. He was a good teacher.
“Maybe you should get Dean to do some stuff with you.” Hermone suggested. “You know he’s always scribbling.”
“No” Harry agreed “But we are the things we think will hurt the people we love least” He shrugs “And for me that means I’m alright”
By the time she drifted off to sleep she had come up with two answers. The first was an easy one; she had never let anything go in her life. The second was harder.
Luna and Colin exchanged an obviously exasperated look. They agreed anyway, but all they found in the trees were exploded pinecones and a smoking log. Ginny was disappointed but she made Colin take pictures anyway.
When Hermione, Ron and Draco pressed him further for information he simply pressed the flimsy excuse that it was for ‘research’.
Fleur smiled at them beatifically. She was wearing professor robes like any other, her hair pulled back in a neat bun. She had glasses perched on her nose. Neville wondered if she wore them for effect or out of genuinely impaired vision.
Neville stares at Harry, speechless. The two were friends, of course, but never before had Harry been so honest or emotional with him. Neville imagined that when Harry got emotional like this, he went to Draco or Ron. Hermione maybe.
Malfoy stared at her, slightly alarmed, while Harry let out a baffled laugh and Ron a strangled sound of surprise.
What they had discovered was that many necromantic rituals required an exchange. Life for life, blood for blood. The more complex the ritual, the more death you needed. Necromancy was an even sum game. You couldn’t take anything out which you hadn’t already given tenfold. Hermione referred to it as the mark of cane for subsections of magic.
Harry laughed softy at her shock and shifted awkwardly “Like… school? and some other stuff. Private stuff”
Harry had explained to Hermione privately that she shouldn’t get too close to Draco because his family were what was known as blood purists and he couldn’t be trusted not to discriminate against her for being a muggleborn. It was true that at first Draco had seemed vaguely suspicious of her, and obviously alarmed that he’d carried out a lengthy debate on magic with someone with muggle parents. But as the weeks went by, nothing had happened and the two had only grown closer. Whenever Draco made an uninformed or distasteful comment about muggles one of the other three would just correct him. Ron’s attempts often lead to hilariously inaccurate explanations, but the thought was there.
“I don’t know where it is!” A voice that was definitely Harry’s hissed back, sounding annoyed. If that was Harry, then the other voice must be Hermione. The other girl had come back from Diagon Alley to spend a night with them, and she guessed that Hermione must be sharing her room.
“It’s safer not to be flooing back and forth,” Molly said, stroking Ginny’s hair lovingly. “I have old Mr. Tremel looking in on the chickens for us.”
Harry laughed like Ron had made a purposeful joke and then waved his hands in a shushing motion. “Give me a sec and you’ll see, alright?”
Ginny reached over and gently took Luna’s hand in hers and Luna wondered if it was a deliberate search for comfort or a force of habit. Either way Luna clutched back fiercely.
Two weeks after the Halloween Fiasco (which rest assured Hermione had made many, many lists about. Harry had mysteriously absconded with the diadem after they’d found it and he’d taken them for a celebratory meal in the kitchens. Ron had been happy. Hermione had been suspicious.) Hermione wandered into the second-floor girls’ bathroom to find Harry chatting happily to moaning myrtle, leaning against one of the ornate bathroom sinks.
“Yes, daddy” Luna called through the kitchen back door which was swung open to the world. The Lovegood house always maintained an open-door and open-window policy throughout the summer. Luna would wander in and out of the house and gardens barefoot, as if one was simply an extension of the other. In the summer it felt as if the whole of the Devon countryside was one big greenhouse, sun-baked with the same quiet still air. Luna would wander for hours, alone or with Ginny, and then pause in nooks and crannies of the world- tree roots, the shade of crumbled stone walls, with her feet dipped into rocky streams. She’d read or draw or Ginny would tell her her marvellous made up stories.
Ron nodded contemplatively. It was definitely odd to find out bits and pieces of the ‘other world’ as Harry called it. The past few days had been exhaustive on Ron’s cognitive processing.
Their group had therefore taken it upon themselves to spend breaks and frees in a dusty back corner of the library. This was opposed to huddling around Hermione’s charmed jam jar of blue flames outside. It had only taken a few weeks for their group to coalesce into its now constant state. At first, Neville and Parvati, as well as some of Draco’s childhood Slytherin friends, had dipped in and out before finding their places with others. In Neville’s case, Harry had introduced him to some Hufflepuffs- Ernie, Justin and Hannah- and by the weeks end they hardly saw him apart from the trio. Harry still made it a habit to seek him out at least once a week and Hermione would partner with the round-faced boy in lessons they shared with the Slytherins, where neither Draco nor Neville’s friends were present.
Luna knew she was lucky to have the friends she did- and she knew that she wouldn’t have them at all if just a few small things were different. If the Weasleys weren’t the closest Wizarding family to her house. If Harry wasn’t so persistent. If Draco wasn’t in her house.
“Fleur. Are you alright? What have you heard?” Harry asked, voice verging on desperation. Fleur walked into her office, leaving the door open for them to follow. Neville closed the door behind him softly after entering, feeling awkward.
But Harry hadn’t done a single not weird thing since Hermione had met him and so she thought that was neither here nor there.
Neville heard the footsteps too late. By the time he heard the turn of the doorknob and the muttered voice he had only managed to pick up his neat pile and stuff it back into the blueprint. When he turned around, he was still holding them.
“Not much use against dragons, though.” Harry muttered under his breath, eyes flicking to the great lake. Ron was the only one close enough to hear.
Harry looked up at the woman with badly hidden curiosity “And was that before or after you were an agent of you-know-who?” He snarked, but it was weak at best.
Ginny glanced at Harry to see what he thought but found that he didn’t seem to be paying attention to the conversation at all. He was staring at Ginny’s cauldron of books intensely, brow furrowed in thought.
And down below the heating flagstones Neville Longbottom kissed Harry Potter next to a raging fire of dark magic, only separated from it by a single stone wall.
For a second she could swear she saw the sink moving, before she blinked and everything was normal again. Huh.
“A summer wedding.” Sirius said, coming to stand next to Neville where the lanky boy (he’d shot up four inches in the past few months. He wondered, morbidly and with great guilt, if it was due to a sudden lack of crushing parental pressure. Then he went back to missing his Grandmother a lot.) was staring out of the window at the usually skinny yard. Now it was big enough to fit over one hundred guests. And it would do just that in less than an hour. “Never thought I’d see the day.”
Harry looked at her, seemed to remember she was there, and winced. “Erm.” The greatest seer of all time said “It’s going to snow this Christmas.”
Hermione only had a moment to consider what it was that these two men had seemingly betrayed before Dumbledore’s mood suddenly shifted. “Well," He exclaimed, a blazing twinkle in his eye, “There’s only one way to find out the truth.”
“How long's left?” Harry asked, crowding unnecessarily, Ron thought, into Draco’s space to see his watch.
Halloween finally came and with it a black cloud hanging over Harry’s head. If Hermione had thought a normal Harry was impossible to deal with, she’d obviously just jinxed herself.
Ginny sighed, then held her hand out loftily as if waiting for a kiss. Harry took it, winked at her—and then all three of them were being squeezed through a tunnel. Ginny was vividly reminded of her mother explaining how babies were made and the muggle video they’d been shown in the year of primary school she attended. Fallopian tube of time and space.
“Ginny you can’t come” Harry said, in a voice that brokered no argument. Well. Ginny Weasley could argue with a brick wall and come out victorious.
She shoved him. He laughed. She unlocked the door just to have something that meant she could turn around and hide her smile.
“Sorry, Harry. What are you planning now?” She said, resigned. Ron snorted from the other side of the room.
“God, you’re so insufferable. Merlin knows why I love you so much” Sirius said, scrubbing a hand over his wet eyes and took a fortifying breath “Do you remember after James and Lily got married? We were in our shitty Mile’s End flat, god it didn’t even have running water-”
“Shut up will you, you great mutt.” There was a jostle in the flames, as if Remus had shouldered Sirius, who broke into laughter and stopped singing T-Rex.
“Harry” Mrs. Granger called up the stairs, sounding confused “Ron, Hermione. Come downstairs a minute”
Thereis never as much depth to these relationships, but then again that means that there is so much less devastation when he is once again torn away.
“Ron—” Harry began, and Ron had a terrible premonition that Harry was about to talk about feelings. “I’ve been meaning to talk to you.”
Dear Merlin, Ron prayed resignedly as the clearing burst into shouts, let this not be another year of absolute chaos.
Neville wasn’t a part of the wedding Party. In fact, the only people Sirius and Remus had standing up with them was Harry, on Remus’ left, and Tonks who was stood next to Sirius. Andromeda Tonks, nee Black, was officiating for them.
Well Ron would rather that Harry and Hermione were plotting the assassination of Merlin himself without thinking it prudent to tell him than that they might—
Neither of them seemed to notice that she hadn’t actually agreed to the deal any more. Just because she wasn’t planning on bugging Harry about it didn’t mean she was going to let it go.
Neville could feel an uncertain chill settling over their world, turning bright things insular and colourless.
Remus and Arthur also pushed their way over, hugging their respective kids, et al. Remus hugged Neville tightly.
They went for tea with Hagrid in the afternoon, while Hermione and many of the other girls disappeared into the fourth-year dormitory to, as they put it, ‘get ready’. Ron couldn’t imagine why this would take six hours, but he generally adopted the attitude that girls were a mystery and one that he was far to primitive and uneducated to solve.
They were sitting on the deep sill of a large window, feet tangled together. Luna lay her head gently on the cool damp glass. Rain spattered the panes of glass gently. The grey sky stretched out dismally, thick and heavy with water. April showers, she supposed.
He came to a stop in front of the door, which was plain in every single way. His hand rested on the doorknob. A quick turn and he would—
“Just enjoy the day, if you can.” He said kindly. “And go check Harry hasn’t been lost entirely to his tux, yeah?”
Morality was infinitely complex, Neville thought. Mostly he felt an overwhelming desire to go back to bed.
Harry spent the whole time grinning madly, looking like it was the only place he wanted to be in the whole world. That was the first time Ginny thought there might be something weird about Harry Potter.
“Yeah,” Ginny said with a shrug. “But, something happens in this place, it eventually tracks back to you, you know?”
Harry pouted, then let out a long sigh, “It’s been hard. I’ve changed a lot. But- the big things. People I lost. People I might lose—I can’t have it happen again. I’m trying to save people.”
Ron suppressed his natural wince at the name, instead shaking his head thoughtfully “Maybe you’re right. We can look into dark rituals and see what fits the pattern. But, Harry,” He came to stand in front of his best friend, placing his hands-on Harry’s shoulders and staring the shorter boy in his eyes, “You cannot blame yourself. You don’t know everything. You
In potions in April Ron couldn’t help himself from laughing at Harry. Harry had recently filled him in on his history with Snape and now every interaction the pair had caused Ron to break out into a fit of giggles.
Ginny seemed unusually nervous. “I think it’s fantastic” Luna said, grinning warmly and reaching over to take Ginny’s mitten-ed hand in hers.
Harry groaned loudly, putting his head in his hands “I think Remus allows it because the cats seem to like them. Sirius just thinks it’ll annoy Kreacher”
Harry shrugged, turning around and tugging a hand through his hair, “I do a lot of extra studying.” He said. Neville, who had hardly ever seen Harry with a book in his hand that Hermione hadn’t forced there, frowned.
Bellatrix Lestrange was dead. Dead. She had tortured Neville’s parents and haunted his dreams his whole life and yet—and yet she had died in her cell, locked away. All alone.
“Harry you’re upset. But this is rash. This is fucking—this isn’t one of your whimsical ideas. This is mental."
“‘let’ is too strong a word” Professor Lupin said with clear pain. He sighed and walked to the bottom of the stairs “Padfoot! We’re home!” He hollered.
“Yes, I could!” Harry yelled, eyes wild and wide, “That’s the whole point. I know. I know what’s trying to happen here, every day. And every day I’m trying to push it down. Stop Voldemort coming back. Keep everyone alive.” His voice croaked n that last word. “And what for? I keep one person safe and another one dies. It’s cosmic fucking whack-a-mole, Ron. How do I do this? How the hell do I keep doing this?”
Then they were back off, winding their way along the vault pathway, climbing up the stairs and edging their way along the cavern edge, ducking around the waterfall as they went.
Actually, Hermione wasn’t entirely sure wizards believed in gravity. They probably just believed Merlin had cast some exhaustive sticking spell on the world to stop everything floating off.
“It’s nice, in a way, that you two are friends” He said, though he sounded doubtful “Let’s hope he’s nothing like his father”
Draco but his head on the desk with a groan. “Where’s Harry with cream cakes when you need them?” He said to the wood grain. Hermione patted him distractedly on the head, eyes scanning the page in front of her.
he walked into the atrium of the Ministry of Magic at four in the morning, when only the maintenance crew were in, and took hold of the ministry of Magic without any kind of fight. When Minister Bones floo’d into her office, she was killed with a lazy flick of You-Know-Who’s finger.
She didn’t say this with arrogance, but with a small, sure smile. “This year I hope to follow on from the excellent example of your last two Professor’s, who I have been in contact with to assure your education follows an upward trajectory. We have a saying in France ‘Qui n’avance pas, recule’. Who does not move forward, recedes. And in these times, we cannot go backward.” Her face was stoic now “We must all be ready for what may come, whatever that is. No recession.”
Ginny gave him a grateful smile and saw out of the corner of her eye that her mum looked slightly relieved by this turn of events too. One less set to buy. Ginny pointed up to the second floor, directing Harry’s eyes there.
“Draco is terrible.” He huffed, pushing his long blonde hair back harshly. “I can’t make up an excuse to get there. Mother wants to floo to York, today of all days, and get tea together.”
She mulled over her entire ‘investigation’, lacklustre and often dead-end as it had often been. Why had she been so unable to let it go? Why had she let her whole first year at Hogwarts become so wrapped up in one occurrence?
—It’s a massive fuck-off chamber under the castle built by Salazar Slytherin. It’s in Hogwarts: A History?”
“That bastard.” He’d muttered, quiet enough that only Neville and perhaps Ginny could have heard. Then he slammed the letter on the kitchen table and stormed out of the room.
Ron glanced sideways at Harry and Hermione. They were sharing a Look. Harry and Hermione often shared Looks that Ron wasn’t privy too. Ron placed the anxiety this caused him where he placed all uncomfortable things: Deep,
Ginny wrote down what she had heard, then drew lines coming off things and added her thoughts. By the end of this she had a web of confusion and suspicion. She frowned down at the messy page, then put it with her other pieces of evidence.
They walked out to the black lake, taking small boats out to the scaffold-esque stands. “Is this structurally safe?” Hermione said, staring up at the stands with worry.
The only other times she felt unburdened like that was when she was with Luna. With Luna, she didn’t have to be anything except there.
She wondered, suddenly tired, what it would be like not to grow up in the shadow of a war. In the shadow of those long dead. She watched Harry, who’s bottom lip was scabbed over from chewing it in worry and who looked as if he blamed himself entirely despite Hermione’s assurances. She thought about Harrys parents who Harry must surely think of every day, killed in large part by the man that had come searching for him today. What must that feel like?
“He’s been back for a few days” The man behind Sirius said. He held out his hand to Hermione’s mother and smiled at the kids “I’m Remus Lupin, by the way. We were very good friends of Harry’s parents”
Neville wondered if the enchanted student body was intended to kill Harry. Then he thought how surreal it must be to be Harry Potter, with people caring about your existence enough to try and end it. “This is crazy,” Neville muttered.
But then Ginny was coming down the stairs, dressed in shades of blue and grey. Draco smiled at her charmingly. “Terrifying as always, Ginevra.”
When she came out of the bathroom in fresh pyjamas and a towel-turban, she headed one floor up to her room. She and Percy had rooms next to each other on this floor, with Charlie’s old room opposite them. Her mother still kept Charlie’s room set up for the irregular times he would come back from Romania to stay for a few days at a time. Ginny sometimes sat in her brothers’ room when she missed him or when she wanted to be alone. It was covered in pictures of dragons, and of snapshots of Charlie and his best friend Tonks with her ever changing hair. It constantly smelled slightly of smoke and the smell always had the instant effect of calming her down.
