“As a matter of fact, I am. Not all of us spend our days bent over steaming cauldrons and reading books in our armchairs like a twenty-seven-year-old pensioner.”
Draco’s lips pull into a self-deprecating smile, quite without his permission. “Yes, well, not all of us could be the youngest seeker in a hundred years. I needed something to do on the weekends.”
He knows the second Potter comes back to himself, because it no longer feels like he’s sat in a rowing boat on the middle of a stormy sea. The scene is still, and he can see everything. The unmitigated shitbag still has his fingers inside Potter, and his mouth is on one of his tight brown nipples. Fuck. Fuck. That must be why-
“So what about Terran?” Hermione wonders. “Are you ready to move past him?”
Harry plucks at a pill in the fabric. “I don’t know why I reacted like that. I didn’t act like that when it happened. It wasn’t even a big deal.”
He washes up on a beach. The sand is so yellow it hurts. Two identical children with glowing eyes play together in the sand. Harry begins to sink, the sand swallowing him, and a one of the children screams. It is impossibly hot, and dark, and a deafening sound surrounds him. The vibration of it echoes through his bones. Purring. Harry clamps his hands over his ears, and screws his eyes shut. Lights begin to fill the room, reflecting again from Draco’s hair. Harry reaches out to touch it, but Draco grabs his hand, and uses it to pull him closer. Their foreheads rest together, and Draco’s skin feels cool on Harry’s temple.
They laugh, and Harry manages to drop the conversation. He’s gotten the bulk of it off his chest, and Hermione’s given him something to think about. If he does manage to get Terran back, does he even still want him? He’s been so wrapped up in Draco that he’s barely thought about him. Harry feels a little guilty again. He thinks he loves him, but what if he doesn’t? What if he was just so desperate for a normal relationship that he pinned all his hopes on one man and refused to consider anything else, even when it wasn’t working?
She nips his ear affectionately before carrying the letter off.
When Angus gets up, Simi quickly replaces him. “Harry, I’ve been meaning to ask. Have you got any embarrassing stories about Draco from school?”
“And you’re a knob,” she sniffs.
Doesn’t he still want to? “Do you think I should?”
“Go on, I won’t bite,” he says generously.
Weasley’s face would be comical, under different circumstances. Eyes bulging, mouth opening and closing wordlessly, he looks like Longbottom’s pet toad. Trevor, he thinks his name was.
Draco laughs. “True enough. I suppose it’s only fair, after I asked you not to call me Malfoy. In bed, anyway.”
“Have you told Granger and Weasley about this?” he asks.
the expert, after all those years of practice.”
Harry’s mouth opens involuntarily. “How? Who?”
Draco cocks his head thoughtfully. “Everyone looked to you to save them. You had to make the kind of decisions no one should ever have to make, let alone a child. That kind of responsibility is a lot to bear. It would make sense, if you needed to let go, let somebody else take charge.”
Draco tilts his head. “You know, I thought I’d hallucinated that.”
Pansy shakes her head. “If he hurts you, I’ll kill him. I don’t care that he’s Harry Potter, I’ll do it anyway. I can go on the run to Greece after, I’ve always wanted to go.”
Malfoy laughs half-heartedly. “I’m reformed, not a saint.” His teeth are oddly perfect; it’s off-putting.
He takes another deep breath, and pushes back inside with a contented sigh. Finally, he lengthens his thrusts. He keeps them slow, and avoids abusing Potter’s prostrate. He lifts Potter’s hips a little more, for a better angle, and stares down at his cock. It’s not completely soft anymore, twitching as Draco glides in and out, but nowhere near hard. It amazes him that Potter could be so obviously enjoying himself, and yet not have an erection.
Harry rushes to comply, holding tightly to his own wrists. He can’t believe he’s managed to do something wrong already.
“So you do want to kiss me?” asks Harry, still slightly breathless.
Draco’s tempted to shake the insufferable, beautiful idiot until he develops a sense of self-worth, but he manages to stop himself. Restraint is something of a speciality of his, these days. Not that you’d know it, considering he keeps coming back to Potter like a needy Crup. But then, he’s not a saint, and Potter’s always been something of a blind spot.
Harry nods, too tired to deny himself something he wants so badly. Draco takes his hand again, and apparates them straight into Harry’s kitchen. Without saying anything he goes over to Harry’s kettle, and with slow and unsure hands, starts to make tea.
When the Prophet arrives that Monday, all hell breaks loose. A picture of him and Terran at a party takes up the whole of the front page, except for the blaring headline: ‘The Chosen One Chooses Chastity’. Snappy. Alliterative. Absolutely fucking horrifying.  He looks closer at the picture. It was taken at a private party- no press would have been allowed in. His heart squeezes. Terran wouldn’t go to the papers; he doesn’t need the money. Harry should trust him more than that.
“Do you want anything more than that?” he says, voice on the edge of breaking. “Because this isn’t just physical for me.”
Malfoy starts to pace. “I was just getting up to go and- ah. I have a theory.”
“What?” splutters Draco. “You can’t be serious.”
Malfoy rolls his eyes and takes Harry’s coat almost without him noticing, the movement is so smooth. “Roberta would never allow it. She’s very serious about privacy, you know.”
Harry tenses. “Actually, I have to get go-”
“No,” says Harry, shaking his head emphatically. “Don’t say sorry for that.”
He closes the door behind him and turns to face Weasley. “So?”
“Stay,” whispers Harry. “Stay.”
“Kinky?” squeaks Ron. “No one said anything about
“Sit down, Ron. You’re not going anywhere,” says Hermione.
“There doesn’t have to be a clear-cut answer, and not everyone’s reasons are the same. My dad was a man’s man, and a raging bigot. Growing up, it was all ‘boys don’t cry’ and ‘don’t be such a pussy’’. I tried to be the person he wanted, and when I realised I was gay it made me so fucking scared. But I wasn’t allowed to be scared of anything, yeah? The only thing I was allowed to feel was anger.”
Harry misses part of the conversation as he wrestles with himself, trying to stay under control. He wants to be good, and that means not moving or making noise. If he wants Draco to praise him, to fuck him, to be pleased with him, he has to play by the rules.
Harry rolls his eyes, and tries not show how eager he is. “What about you? You said
The older Healer casts her eye over the scene, and gives a satisfied nod. “Good, no one’s dying. Now why didn’t you just come to St Mungo’s rather than dragging us out here.”
“What is it you’re worried about? If you like men and women, that’s great. If you just like men, that’s good too. Your family won’t care, they just want you to be happy.”
Draco raises his eyes to the ceiling in exasperation. “I told you, it’s the house wards. I’ve been fixing them.”
“Yes, yeah, I want you now.”
Sorry for the wait, but at least this is a chapter I know some of you have been wanting for a while. I'm not entirely happy with it, but if I waited for it to be perfect it would never get published.
Draco lifts Harry’s chin with a crooked finger, a treacherous smile on his face. “You don’t mind if I take this do you, darling?”
He apparates outside the shop, and nearly knocks over a member of the crowd that’s gathered there. The jostled woman swings round, ready to tell him off, when her face lights up. “It’s him!”
He rushes into the space between Harry’s thighs and kisses him with an almost naïve enthusiasm. Harry feels worn out, and still shivery with praise. Draco pushing back in batters against some wall in his head, one that somehow hadn’t been knocked down when Draco was fucking him before, and he is inexplicably euphoric. He’s soft, his dick can’t even twitch, but it still feels so good. Facing him, he can finally see how dishevelled Draco looks, the flush on his cheeks. Making Draco this undone feels like a bigger achievement than anything else he’s done in years.
He walks away but he still catches Potter laughing, the beginnings of a hissed conversation.
“Have you ever hurt Harry?”
Draco laughs. “Look at you, you’re literally gagging for it.”
Harry sips his beer. “I just like the pictures.”
“Go on then, Malfoy. If we have to talk, we might as well be eating.”
Harry smiles softly. “Well then, I think we’ve solved our problem.”
Harry stares at him, bewildered. “I knew you’d changed, but I didn’t realise that much.”
He doesn’t mention the moments where Malfoy didn’t seem like the same person at all, or how they came to happen. He’s pretty sure Ron would have a heart attack, and Hermione’s voice would reach new levels of panicked squeakiness.
“Yeah. I’ve got a pensieve we can use.” He waves his hand at the cabinet his desk is set into, and two double-fronted doors open. A stone bowl moves out, coming to hover over the desk.
“I’m not sure I should risk it,” he says. “She’s surprisingly strong.”
“Wine, Potter?”
I probably should have called this fic 'Let's Talk About Sex', because that's what about a third of this fic is. However, I'm committed to at least of semblance of realism, so there we are.
Despite his wandering thoughts he makes good progress, and is just about to head home and run himself a bath before an owl flies through one of the windows (still without any glass, he needs to remember to contact his supplier) and lands on his arm. He recognises her as Roberta, Draco’s owl. The note is brief, but thankfully nowhere near as filthy as his last missive.
Draco traces a snaking pattern into the condensation on his beer glass. “What do you mean?”
“She likes you,” he says.
Harry reaches out to touch the scars.
They say their goodbyes and head back to Grimmauld Place. Harry’s not ready to tell them everything, but he doesn’t like keeping secrets from them, and he does need to talk. Sometimes he doesn’t know what he really thinks about something until he telling them. Sitting in the kitchen, holding his warm mug of tea like a shield or a talisman, he starts to talk.
“The day after she died,” he says.
to remove the coffee stains, and fills it. “Here, sit up a bit.”
Andromeda nods. “He cries if I so much as dip his toe in the water.”
Draco fists Potter’s terrible, wonderful hair. If he can’t have Potter’s love, he’ll take everything else he can get. He starts to move his hips a little. Potter can’t take him in that far yet, so he’s not really fucking his face, but just the thought of it makes him burn. On his knees, eyes closed and lashes casting shadows on his cheeks, he looks like a painting. He’s art. Draco wants to defile him.
“Harry, darling? Can you hear me?”
“Then if you’re ready, we’ll begin. Are you ready for me?” asks Draco, cocking his head.
Malfoy clenches his jaw. “Potter, if you’re fucking with me-”
Harry turns his head, waiting to hear it.
“Not with all that running around,” says Andromeda. “I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s steam coming out of his ears when he comes in for dinner.”
Tap. Tap. Tap tap tap.
Harry laughs, and Hermione’s anxious gaze is directed at him instead. “How are you, Harry? We’ve not really talked since last week and you’ve been a bit… quiet.”
As he whisks the eggs, he realises he never even made Draco a drink. A few rushed flicks of his wand later and he sends a mug, a pot of tea, a small milk jug, and a sugar bowl that wiggles its way out of the back of the cupboard, floating up to Draco. Harry’s not exactly sure what he’s doing up there, but he seems happy, and that’s enough for him.
Harry shakes himself. This Leonard Cohen makes beautiful but depressing music, and it might be starting to rub off on him. He is alive. The world is saved. That should be enough. Harry thinks to himself:
“He hasn’t done that either,” hisses Harry.
Draco tightens his arms, and pushes his dick between Harry’s thighs. It feels hot, and it looks red where it emerges under his balls, like all the blood in Draco’s body is in one place. Harry didn’t even know this is something people did, but he likes it. The body warm against his back reminds him of his fantasy, the one he thought of when Draco asked him what he imagined when he touched himself. This is better- it’s real.
Potter takes off his shirt, and Terran divests him of the rest of his clothes, and Draco can’t help but be distracted a little. Merlin, but he’s beautiful. Draco wants to bite those thighs. The boyfriend starts to suck Potter off again, and then something weird happens. The memory becomes blurry, distorted, and Draco has to squint to make anything out. He can just about see Potter lying on his bed, staring at the ceiling, completely unmoving. Shit. It’s happened, hasn’t it?
Harry and Draco once again return to Grimmauld Place together. Instead of heading to the kitchen like they normally would, he leads Draco into the loving room. Going over to the stack of records, he pulls out one with a cover spelled blank. Originally it had been a Kate Bush track, but her wailing had unsettled him. He hands it to Draco.
you’re about to go into histrionics but I can never be sure with you.”
“The more the merrier.” He grimaced at the unfortunate expression. “I just mean that there likely won’t be many people there, and she deserves better than that. I know you might not agree, but-”
He sighs, and looks down at the dog sniffing his trainers. “Hard luck Earl, it looks like they cropped you out.” Harry chucks the paper onto the waiting room table next to the magazines. “I’m not going to read that drivel, you’ll have to sum it up for me.”
“Draco?” Ron says again, voice strangled. “How long has this been going on?”
Harry shakes his head. “I’m sorry that happened to you. It’s not the same, but I know what it’s like to have your only family treat you like you don’t matter.”
They laugh. “Well, I wanted to meet whoever had Draco so-”
“I’m not going to be sick,” Harry mumbles. “But I am.”
Harry does as he says, shuffling his feet together and flexing the muscles in his thighs.
Draco continues, seemingly unaffected. “Did you imagine leaving the curtains open, so that if anyone happened to walk by, they’d see us? Did you imagine having to stay quiet, because the house is full of people preparing for tonight? Or maybe it’s the opposite. Maybe you want to be loud, maybe you want everyone to know.”
“First things first,” starts Draco. “You need a safeword. Are you aware of the purpose of a safeword?”
When Draco runs his fingers over Harry’s scalp he can’t stop a moan sounding, guttural, from the back of his throat. Still loose from his first orgasm, his muscles relaxed under the hot water, he might have fallen asleep if he wasn’t so turned on. Draco shields Harry’s eyes with his palm and tips his head back under the water, rinsing out the suds.
Harry takes off his glasses and wipes them on the edge of his t-shirt, flashing a glimpse of smooth skin and a hint of dark hair. The urge to touch becomes irresistible. Draco gets up from the table to hook his chin over Harry’s shoulder, wrapping his arms around him and sliding a hand under his shirt to feel the skin teasing him so cruelly. He’s so warm, but still the feel of Harry in his arms is like a cool palm on a fevered brow. Halting the figure of eight movement of his wooden spoon, Harry leans back into him.
Harry’s mouth hung agape, before pulling into a grin. It was almost worth being sent to the cupboard that night.
the ones he keeps in his coat pocket. Potter starts to snore, the lucky bastard. The owls surround Draco menacingly, and visions of Buckbeak flash before his eyes as he tries to distribute the Mouse-O’s without being ripped to shreds by talons. Lord, but owls can smell weakness.
“I’m not saying I want to be best mates,” continues Harry. “But if Arthur wants to give him a chance then that’s up to him.”
“They really get along? He doesn’t make any snide remarks?” she asks.
“You can’t just say that stuff in a letter. What if someone saw it?”
You could probably use this fic to psychoanalyze me, if I'm honest. Having said that, I really hope someone other than just me find this sexy. I'm very new to writing explicit scenes, let alone BDSM, so let me know what you think!
He feels a stiff gust of wind, and Bunny swoops down to land on the fence. Earl gallops towards her, barking like mad, and tries to jump up at Bunny.
“Submission, most likely.”
“I would open the window myself, Mr Potter, but I cannot in this state.”
“It’s your funeral today,” says Harry.
“How is
“Draco!” effuses Molly, sweeping him into a hug that he’ll ever get used to. “I was so happy when Harry told us you were coming.”
Harry’s voice is a little wobbly as he says: “Is it Simi?”
Harry stands up, steps fully into the fireplace, and gives it Luna’s address. Long moments later, he stumbles out of the fireplace coughing, and covered in soot. “All?”
Harry climbs through the attic, hearing the low murmur of conversation between Draco and the portrait. The circular door is only open a crack, pale light spilling through. Opening the door, he sees Draco bent over a piece of machinery he’s opened, a magnifying glass giving him one enormous eye. Isla’s portrait says something Harry doesn’t catch through the roaring in his ears, and Draco’s face cracks into a smile.
He surges upwards and climbs onto Malfoy’s lap, the need to finish momentarily eclipsed by the need to kiss him. It conveniently puts him in reach of Malfoy’s hands, and that hasn’t gone without notice. One wraps around to the small of his back, pushing them closer together. The other moves to his flies. Dozens of times, this has been the moment Harry backs away, when someone tries to touch him. Right now, he so busy sucking a bruise into Malfoy’s neck that he forgets he’s supposed to panic.
“I said I was raised in a cult, which is true, I suppose. Most of the unusual things I said could be explained away like that.”
In Harry’s mind, ‘
“Training? What for?”
“Normally I’d say a book, but it needs to be something you’d have to spend time on. What kind of present would you need help with?”
Harry’s mouth twitches into something like a smile, but his mind is busy tracing over the three symbols. “A snitch makes me think of catching something.”
Harry obeys, taking the digits into his mouth and suckling. The shape of them in his mouth, pressing down on his tongue, provokes something in him. He can’t bounce up and down so vigorously with Draco’s fingers in his mouth, so he changes to a rocking, rolling motion. The change has Draco’s dick hitting his prostrate every time, and he can only suck harder at the fingers in his mouth.
Draco doesn’t let this sentiment show on his face. “Feeling better?”
They drink red wine with dinner, Harry drinking faster than he normally might. He’d never really appreciated the taste, he might as well be drinking vinegar half the time, but that isn’t the point of it now. His thumb rubs away the condensation on his glass as Terran complains about his new Quidditch coach who ‘just doesn’t understand the power dynamics of the team’. With the aid of Harry’s half-hearted responses, the conversation dies out quickly. Terran reaches across the table to trace over the scar on Harry’s left hand, the letters still as clear as they were ten years ago. He shivers.
By this time Harry was shaking. The Dursley’s rarely attended church, and so such gory tales were largely unfamiliar to him.
“Gryffindors,” sighs Millie. “Such prudes.”
Trigger Warnings:
Once the strong, but not entirely unpleasant, tea was finished Granny pushed her own cup in front of him. “Swirl the dregs and tip them into the saucer then tell me what you think.”
“No?” he asks, furrowing his brow. “Do you still want it?”
“Of course. Can I use it with you?”
Draco gives him a pointed look.
They all laugh, Tabby’s high giggle filling the room.
This time, Draco wakes first. They get ready for the day in easy silence, broken over by mutterings over toast, and tea, and toothbrushes. They don’t ask each other about yesterday’s events- they know they’re not the ones with the answers.
“Who knew you were such a slut, Potter?”
“Or we could just take our clothes off next time.”
He’s not sure if a ghost can blush, but her cheeks seem to turn a darker shade of grey.
“Sorry about this,” says Harry, gesturing to the bath. “I’ve spent all day wrestling with your bloody house and I’m knackered.”
The girl grins, and the crowd once again explodes into questions.
Harry is trailed by a pair of ghosts holding hands as he walks Earl, following him like ducklings. They look like a mother and daughter, the child only about ten years old and wearing an oversized rucksack. They don’t speak to him, so he doesn’t speak to them, but his footsteps feel heavier. He wonders if they died at the same time, of if they were reunited when they became unstuck.
“That’s a shame.”
“It’s nothing bad, I just don’t think Hermione will understand.”
Draco looks into his eyes for a long moment, before shaking his head in wonder and disbelief. “You’re insane, Potter. Even I don’t want to be me.”
“I’m sorry about your mum,” says Harry.
Harry folds his arms over his chest. “I’m not doing that!”
At twenty-four he gave in and told Ron and Hermione about his problem. Hermione wondered if it was the loss of control that bothered him, after having so little control over his life growing up. That was close, but still didn’t seem quite right. Harry thought that trust might have more to do with it. He decided not to try and have sex again until he was in a serious relationship with someone he trusted.
Now that he’s closer, he can see Arthur is holding a VHS tape. The bold writing on the front reads ‘Dances with Wolves’. Now that Arthur’s distracted them, he needs to get out of this mess. He needs a minute alone to compose himself.
Luna walks into the room, barefoot but fully dressed in orange and yellow polka dot dungarees. “Oh hello, Harry. I thought you might be Rufus, we’re planning an expedition you see, and there’s still so much to do.”
Harry nods. “Mandrake, okay. I’ll use… Felix.”
She glides through the wall, and leaves him to get dressed.
“Don’t you dare,” they say, tone light but serious. Clearly this thing about the boiler is some mixture of an in-joke and a genuine bone of contention. “You should bring your boy to the party, by the way. I want to meet whoever’s got you so smitten.”
Dying must have changed him, like it changed everything else. The horcrux is gone, but he still doesn’t feel entirely himself.
Harry sighs. Draco’s given him an unpleasant reminder. He’s supposed to be doing this as a way to make things work with Terran, and yet if he could wave his wand and have him be the one holding him instead of Draco, he doesn’t think he’d do it. Guilt pools hot and sour in his gut. He tries to picture Terran washing his hair, drying him, minutes after whispering filth into his ear. He can do it, but the picture doesn’t look right. His face blurs, hair turns paler. Terran turns back into Draco whenever he tries. But. But he doesn’t have relationship with Draco. Right now, he doesn’t have one with Terran either, but he could. Harry loved him- loves him. Why can’t he remember that?
Potter’s face is blank as he stares down at the photo of his ex and this other man. The new boyfriend is attractive, to be sure, but nothing compared to Potter. His hair is far too well behaved, for a start.
After a walk made tiring not by physical exertion, but by the relentless questions of the curious public, Harry returns to the shop. It had been shorter than usual, as he was in a hurry to escape the throng. Low voices still carry from the other room, but the noise of his admirers drowns out the bell. He means to announce himself, but a low murmur cuts him short.
“No,” she sniffs, “I am not.”
Thursday night is date night. They’re both working adults with busy schedules, so they have a night at least once a week where they focus on each other. That’s how adult relationships and communication works, apparently. Harry doesn’t have much practice with those, but Terran does, so he’ll take his word for it. Tonight’s date is a simple home-cooked dinner at Grimmauld Place, to try and take some of the pressure off what’s coming later. Harry breathes a tight sigh, and licks some basil and tomato sauce off the back of his wooden spoon. He reaches for the garlic, then reconsiders. Maybe not tonight. Adding some more oregano to compensate, he gives the pot a last stir and sets the hob to simmer on low.
Weasley’s jaw is set firm. “So. How many times have you, a cowardly ferret of a Death Eater, fucked my best friend?”
“Okay,” he says, holding his warm mug to his chest.
“It’s nothing to worry about,” he says. “Since Mrs Malfoy died, Draco’s on his own, and she asked me to look out for him.”
What Zabini calls ‘jeans’ turn out to be washed-out charcoal denims, tight enough to make Harry blush.
Draco’s eyes are wide as he whispers “We can’t.”
a little better now. Because Draco, the man he loves, understood him first.
The Manor is imposing, but inconspicuously grand. The grounds are verdant, white peacocks parade across the lawn in the distance, and the stonework shines a cool grey. It looks nothing like the scene of countless murders he knows it to be. Seeing no bell or knocker on the intricate iron gates, he sends his Patronus cantering inside to find Draco.
“Fuck off,” says Draco, still gripping Harry’s hair.
Harry lifts up, thighs straining, and holds Draco’s cock in place as he lowers himself back down. His renewed clarity of vision means he can see every flinty shard in Draco’s irises before they are swallowed by black. He feels so full. The charm prepared him well, but he didn’t have the chance to get used to the sensation of something inside him the way he did when Draco used his fingers. His fingers are pressing bruises onto Harry’s hips, and the expression on his face is almost feral. Harry starts to move.
And then she fades away.
“Hello, Mr Potter. Miss Granger, Mr Weasley.” She says, nodding at each of them in turn.
Andromeda laughs, and changes the subject. “Do you remember Draco from school?”
“No. Hermione’s been saying the same thing, and Ron’s been trying to give me space but I know he’s worried. I just…needed some time,” sighs Harry.
“So, Potter. I hear you’re a virgin.”
“I didn’t think I could have sex with anyone, but apparently I can with him,” Harry points out.
When Harry was twenty-three Ginny asked him if he was asexual. He didn’t think he was, but he did some research into it anyway. No, he decided. He definitely felt sexual attraction, he just panicked when he had to follow through.
I've made some edits now I've got the hang of things, which will hopefully make the spacing and a few other details more readable!
Light scratches as his eyes as Narcissa pulls back the curtains. Harry had overslept. He was late. Narcissa stays facing the window as he grabs clean pants, she snipes at him half-heartedly as he hops around pulling his jeans on, before he runs into the adjoining bathroom to throw water on his face and armpits. Harry looks in the mirror, tugging at his hair, but it’s no better or worse than when he actually tries to tame it.
“But a memory can’t be a ghost, can it?”
Harry laughs. “It’s Molly, there’s always enough food.”
Ron and Hermione turn to face him with identical looks of panic and confusion.
He hears Draco open the bathroom door, but he doesn’t open his eyes. “Hey.”
“Maybe I will,” says Ron, darkly. “Maybe I will.”
“Oh darling, it’s alright, don’t be embarrassed,” coos Draco. “I like how greedy you are for me.”
some kind of meltdown, you act like you don’t even want me here.”
“Not anymore, anyway,” concedes Draco. “I had no control over my life for a long time, or I felt like I didn’t. Someone trusting me, someone giving me control willingly, is a rush.”
“You said this was at a bar,” says Hermione urgently. “Were you drunk? Are you sure he didn’t take advantage of you?”
Draco knows this, but he’s not sure why Harry’s telling him.
“Again?” asks Ginny, raising an eyebrow.
“Don’t apologise, Potter. It makes for a lovely view.”
“Yes,” he chants, over and over.
Harry splutters into his drink. “That sounds like something Ron would say, though he’d probably mispronounce ‘euphemism’.”
Draco looks down and twirls his wand between his fingers. “When I was very small, and my mother would sing me to sleep.”
He was about to tear the thick paper around the intricate wax seal, when Dudley’s voice rang out through the library.
“Yes,” whispers Harry.
“So what brings you to my humble abode, O Chosen One?” he says, casually blasting cobwebs from frames and corners as he walks.
Potter shifts again, making a face. “I am a bit sore though.”
Last time he’d had plenty of milk and sugar, and he tries his best to match the shade as exactly as he can to what he remembers. Making someone’s tea right is important, and though he’d left it up to Draco before, he needs an excuse not to turn around for just a few moments longer. When Harry finally brings the mugs to the table, Draco moves to sit across from him, and his little smile grows and takes root in his lips, his nose, his eyes. A small, almost invisible, dimple appears in his cheek. Harry wants to die, just a little bit. Just once more.
If Harry’s learned anything from the nearly two weeks he’s known her, it’s that Granny has her ways. He sighs with relief, and puts his wand away. Through the tall window, he sees a pale blond head weave its way to the front. Draco emerges looking harried, and walks into the shop.
“Pansy,” he announces, as she opens the front door to let him stride into the living room. “I’ve been a fool of the worst kind.”
“Well I love you too,” says Harry firmly, crossing his arms. “So there.”
The wanker scoffs and hauls himself off the bed, already stepping back into his trousers. Potter looks devastated, tears blurring his green eyes.
“Well that’s a cheery thought,” he mutters.
Harry unrolls the newspaper he’s still clutching, and a picture of himself looks back. It’s from yesterday, and shows him leaving the shop, the sign carefully framed in the background. The headline reads: ‘
“You know,” says Harry, looking down to avoid knowing grey eyes, “My cousin used to cry all the time when we were kids. I could never understand it. He had everything he could ever want, he was spoiled rotten and my aunt babied him like anything, and he’d still cry.”
Yes, and Potter’s a night owl, but he already knew that. He watched Granger badger him over breakfast from across the great hall for six years, and he never once looked fully awake.
“Of course, Mr Potter. I will see you soon.”
He doubts that’s the real reason, as they’re in the attic, and not that dusty bedroom. Still, there’s plenty of dust here to remind him of it. “Whatever you say,” he sighs.
“How can you tell?” asks Harry, sitting down at the table and indicating for Draco to do the same.
Draco moves his hand from Harry’s hip to touch him between his legs, feeling the beginnings of his erection. “Really, darling? What a good little slut you are, ready for another go. Don’t worry, I’ll fuck you again. I’ll fuck you over and over until-”
“How pure and innocent.” Draco hums his approval. “I like it.”
“It’s near the Manor,” says Malfoy, as they stand outside and look up at the hand-painted sign swinging in the wind. “So I come here now and again.”
“Don’t stop,” whispers Potter.
Harry cuts off his raspy babble with a desperate kiss. Their teeth clack together, and there’s no finesse in the way Harry’s tongue is licking into his mouth, but it’s still the best kiss of Draco’s life. There’s one hand pulling at his hair (just on the wrong side of too hard and just the way he likes it) and another hand pinning him back to the arm of the sofa. Harry’s never taken control like this before- Draco’s never wanted to just sit back and let someone ravish him like this before, either.
Granger gasps, and points at Draco. “It’s you!”
“Switch what off?”
“Right,” says Draco, standing abruptly. “It’s been a pleasure. I’ll see you all soon, though some sooner than others.” He’s rambling now, but he can’t seem to stop. “Au revoir, à bientôt and all that.”
He smooths the damp hair from Potter’s forehead. “Is this what you needed, darling?”
Harry’s toes curl at that word.
As he comes back down the stairs, he hears Molly using her persuasive powers in full force.
“So your idea of helping my son is to buy him an owl? I assure you he can afford one himself.”
Draco laughs, wrapping his arms more firmly around him and squeezing. “Do remember the safewords?”
“I’m surprised you know where the kitchen is, Draco.”
He lets his head fall on top of Harry’s. “Because I want to.”
Ron turns to Hermione. “He could have though, couldn’t he? He poisoned me once, he
Harry takes a swig of his drink. “I mean, we’re sleeping together, if that’s what you’re asking.”
Hermione tilts her head. “He did spend three years living as a Muggle. Maybe it worked.”
“Now we’ve got you here, I’ve been meaning to have a chat with you,” she says, stroking the dog in her lap.
He supposes he would look pale, after that. “I’ll be eating a roast dinner soon, Molly, I’ll be fine.”
,” his voice soft but clear, movement comes from inside the cloud. A hint of wings, soaring motion, before the spell falters. Draco grins. “It’s some sort of bird.”
“I’m sorry to interrupt,” she says, “But we all have promises to keep, now don’t we?”
“I still don’t like it,” says Ron. “I mean he looks so much like Malfoy- it’s weird.”
He goes back to his food, and the kettle finishes boiling. The mugs and tea bags sort themselves out, the milk jug hopping about impatiently.
Mr Filch spat when he spoke, flecks of spittle flying into the air between them.
He rubs at the seal of his lips where they’re wrapped around Draco’s prick. “I want everyone to see what a whore you are for me.”
“Come on Potter, how was I supposed to resist?”
“That’s it,” Malfoy croons.
“Whenever you want,” says Draco. Whatever he’s doing, he can cancel it.
Sinking into the warm water, Harry lets out a deep sigh. There’s a faint tingling from the salts, and he can feel them working already, aches he didn’t even know he had disappearing. He submerges himself more deeply, letting the water lap over his chest. His eyes close without his permission, surrounding him in comforting heat and darkness. There’s a creak on the stairs that lets him know Draco got his message, and took him up on his offer. Inviting Draco to Grimmauld, giving him the address, telling him to let himself in. It shows a little more of Harry’s feelings than is probably wise.
“And you always have to make everything into an argument,” counters Harry.
“No dress robes?” she asks.
“Guilty as charged,” he admits.
“Better,” says Draco, his voice low. “I’ve insulted that crows-nest many times, but you don’t look right without it.”
Their noses brush as Harry nods, telling him to keep going.
Harry nods.
“When?”
Malfoy fucks him with precision. Each movement is calculated to be as destructive to Harry’s sanity as physically possible. Every now and then, he pushes in with a force that leaves his feet scrabbling at the tiled floor for purchase. However, it’s Malfoy’s
Jake shrugs. “Probably.”
“Mr Potter,” repeats the voice.
Draco folds his arms. “Oh, so it’s Malfoy again?”
Harry shakes his head, looking down at the sticky pub table. “I can’t do that, Ron.”
“Well now you have lots of them. How many Weasleys are there again?”
“I’m Samuel,” he says. “A pleasure to meet you.”
, darling. It either hurts you or it doesn’t.”
“Harry dear, you look pale. Let me get you something to eat.”
“My apologies,” she says. “You seem better now, does anyone still need medical attention?”
Harry nods. “So are the Tarot decks sentient, like portraits?”
Malfoy nods and grabs two stout little glasses. He snags a bottle and sits down, gesturing to the chair opposite. Harry sits.
Earl runs round the edge of the lake barking at the geese and chasing them into the water. His hatred of getting wet is the only thing stopping him from following them in. Harry throws bits of stale bread for the mallards and swans, while Teddy claps his chubby hands together in delight. From the bushes, he hears a quiet click. He turns towards the noise, and a camera flashes in his face.
Millicent rolls her eyes. “Snakes don’t ride, we slither.”
“So it’s true,” he says, frowning at Harry. “What the Prophet is saying.”
“Boy,” said Aunt Petunia. “This is Mr Filch, headmaster of Saint Brutus’ Institute for Orphan Boys. Say good-day to him.”
Malfoy nods, his sharp face a bland mask of politeness. He doesn’t look at Harry. “There’s some damage to the gables in the East Wing, but other than that we should stay dry.”
Harry blushes again just thinking about what he’d read, Ron and Hermione just feet away.
After walking Earl, doing the food shop, and buying an eclectic set of vinyl records, Harry returns home to find Narcissa and Bunny in the kitchen. He’d left the kitchen window open on for the owl on purpose, but there is very little he can do about Narcissa- she doesn’t exactly need a cat flap. Smiling at the mental image he’d created, he greets her with a wave.
“Yes?” he says, idly twisting strands of Potter’s hair through his fingers.
Harry closes the door behind him and follows Draco into the kitchen, handing him the rest of the bottles. True to their word, Simi joins them promptly.
“What more can he want?” wonders Ron, around a mouthful of burger.
Harry goes practically boneless, still nursing the fingers in his mouth. Draco takes them out, ignoring Harry’s small noise of protest, and taps them against his hole. He jolts at the sudden sensation, dick rubbing against Draco’s clothed stomach. A wet index finger rubs at his rim, before dipping ever so slightly inside. Draco scrapes Harry’s neck with his teeth as he pushes in to the first knuckle.
“I gave this to my brother on his seventeenth birthday,” she says. “There was nothing he loved more than having his cat on his lap, purring away. She’d died a few weeks before, and he said he could never replace her, so I asked a friend of mine to enchant the watch to purr like she did. I gave her a memory of the cat sitting on his lap, rumbling away, so it would sound exactly the same.” She handed it to him, so he could get a closer look. “He never took it off; he was wearing it when he died. I would have buried him in it, but it was the only piece of him I had left.”
. The shop window is filled with notices, spelling out cryptic messages. One warns that if your name is Sally and you have a pet lizard, you need to call your mother. Another advises that if you have green hair and a birthmark on your left buttock, it would be wise to check your food for poison.
Draco clucks his tongue and says “You’re clearly not,” but instead of interrogating him further he just walks Harry back into the adjoining bedroom and sits him down on the bed.
“Do you think-” starts Draco, before apparently deciding against asking whatever question he has, and taking a bite of bacon instead.
Harry decides to take her original advice, and goes for a walk. He takes precautions, pulling a Molly-knitted hat over his distinctive hair and scar. The muggle park is close to Grimmauld Place, with a large pond lined with bulrushes, and he always used to like feeding the ducks.
who wanted to fuck
and hands one to Harry. Harry shuffles upright so he can drink, rucking up the very top of the sheets with his heels. They’d been kicked off almost entirely during their vigorous…activities. Draco cleans them up while Harry drinks deeply, slowly coming back down to earth.
up,” he says, before tapping two fingers at Harry’s lips. “Suck.”
“You know,” says Harry. “We never really talk about the muggle education centre.”
“Maybe she thinks it would just upset you,” he speculates.
Draco shrugs. True, there’s no
“I think so, duckie. My father died, and my mother remarried. She had another daughter. I’ve seen bits and pieces in the paper, obituaries, wedding announcements, new babies. I never met her, but she has a whole family now. They probably don’t even know I exist.”
“You’re always making me drink water,” he slurs.
he’ll be gentle. He’ll be ever so gentle as he breaks Draco’s heart.
“Assuming you didn’t come here
Harry continues. “Sometimes I wonder if I’m like that. I’ve got nothing to cry about, and yet-”
“You love him?” says Draco flatly. “I’ve yet to see you act like it.”
The girls look at him in surprise.
Harry untenses his shoulders, but his stomach still feels uneasy. “We probably don’t need to worry. Most of the dream was nonsense anyway.”
“Batteries?” asks Malfoy, immediately looking like he wished he hasn’t spoken.
Harry lies still, stunned by the fall and the herbal scent that the tea leaves had reminded him so much of. A bead of sweat drips from Draco’s nose onto Harry’s neck. “Eugh, get off.” He shoves Draco away and sits up. “And you didn’t win, you cheated.”
A blonde woman runs out of the back room, knocking into his shoulder in her hurry to leave. Barely noticing, Harry walks into the room she’d just left, and freezes in the doorway. Granny lies in front of her chair, her head pillowed on her arm, grey hair spilling over her face. Earl sniffs around her, whining softly. Harry throws himself to his knees beside her, and sees the hair over her mouth moving gently with her breath. She’s alive.
“I know, ‘Mione.”
Draco tightens his jaw, and squeezes Harry’s arm. “And I’ve noticed you and your friends aren’t all that touchy-feely. A quick hug and a slap on the back here or there, a kiss on the cheek, but that’s about it. Am I right?”
“Lord, what a spoilsport.” they drawl, rolling their eyes. “Let’s have a drink and put some music on- create an atmosphere, and all that jazz.”
Draco’s glad he didn’t murder Dumbledore. He’s glad he didn’t identify Potter and his friends at the Manor. He’s glad he didn’t kill anyone at all, in the end. He has plenty of regrets as it is, he doesn’t need to add more by worrying over what he could have done. Still, he wasn’t lying about pushing Potter against a shelf. When he was at Hogwarts, studying in the library, his eyes would drift over to the rows of shelves near the back, where couples would slink away to kiss. He’d tried to imagine kissing imaginary, faceless boys, but they all turned into Potter.
“Fair enough,” he shrugs. “Now let’s give it another go.”
After they finish their tea, an inch of cold liquid still left in Draco’s mug, they both get to work. Harry tries to memorise the different types of Tarot cards, and their meanings.
The queue for the bar is crowded, the pub is getting noisier and he’s pressed in by bodies. Draco gets the drinks, and the night continues in much the same way. A rotating cast of classmates and drinks, Potter a regular presence by his side. Once he overhears a drunken Weasley loudly questioning his presence, but Granger hushes him quickly. Longbottom is definitely avoiding him, but he can’t blame him for that, he truly was horrible to him at school. Still, no one hexes him or even glares at him, so he counts that as a win. Time truly is a marvellous thing, when it comes to old wounds.
Harry hums in the back of his throat.
They make their way out of the pub, feeling Granger’s keen eyes on him. He looks back, and Potter’s head is still on the table. He’s going to have a beast of a hangover tomorrow, and it’s mostly Draco’s fault. Also, Potter’s friends have found out he’s fucking a Death Eater, and that’s his fault, too. Merlin, but Draco’s a bastard. He can never do anything right. He could never be what Potter needs. What was he thinking, coming here? He was thinking of himself, as usual.
The water hails down like a sheet of ice, making Harry yelp and jump back. “You fucker!”
Harry grins. “Does this ‘chair’ cook lunch, by any chance?”
“What are ghosts if not a memory? What is a person?” asks Granny. “We are the product of our experiences, each moment deciding the next.”
“Shouldn’t you be at training this morning?”
At Arthur’s end of the table, the conversation circles back to the muggle studies centre.
Potter hums in agreement, and this time Draco coats two of his fingers with salve. When he slips them in, Potter gasps. Pushing the salve in deeper, it displaces some of the come that his perfunctory charms didn’t clean away. Merlin, Draco came less than twenty minutes ago and he’s already itching to slide right back in. It would be so easy. He imagines this is what a well-fucked pussy would feel like. So wet and ready for him, still leaking his come. He crooks his fingers, just glancing over the prostrate.
When Potter’s had half the bottle, he drinks the rest himself. Draco’s sweaty and overheated in his clothes, and starting to feel a little disgusting.
Draco shushes him like a child or a frightened animal. “Oh, my darling. My precious boy.”
“I care about you too,” whispers Harry.
“Malfoy,” huffs Potter in exasperation, craning his neck round to look at Draco. “Was that really necessary?”
The problem is, the complications between him and Harry can’t really be explained in muggle terms. He tried, but there’s no number of vague allusions that can replace an entire war.
“Wait!” starts Hermione. “You do have muggle money, don’t you?”
Harry pushes at his shoulder, separating their upper halves. “Don’t ‘
The Healer goes over to the young woman where she’s sat in the purple chair, and presses her wand to her chest. The sound of her breathing is amplified, and he hears an unsettling rattle.
“I may have changed my ways, but it would take a miracle to stop me from arguing with you.”
“I’m not paying you to stand here looking pretty, you’re supposed to be putting out chairs.”
Harry thinks of curses cast in a flooded bathroom, and grits his jaw. Draco has scars from a spells Harry cast in panic, so he can’t exactly condemn Aisling for the same. If Draco can forgive, then so can he.
Draco grins, pleased with himself, and pulls Harry out of bed. “Don’t bother getting dressed on my account.”
“No I’m not,” protests Harry. “I’m sexy, and manly and… sexy.”
“No.” The answer is swift, and definite.
You were made to feel this good. I want to make you feel like this all the time.” Draco’s voice is sweet and bitter, like strawberry gin. “You should be this full all the time. Stay inside you all day, all night. I’d just sit there for hours with you on my cock, not moving, just keeping you exactly where you should be.”
Draco chuckles under his breath. “We’ll explore that kink later.” The warm water slicks the space between his thighs, runs over his sensitive dick. Draco moves faster, holds him tighter. “Lord, you feel so good. You’re being so good, staying so still and so tight, so patient.”
Molly seems genuinely pleased by his flattery, and sits him next to her when they move to the table. Harry’s all the way at the other end of the table with Arthur, and he sends a beseeching look his way. He’s the one who made him come, and now he’s abandoned him to a suspicious looking Percy on his left, and an amused looking George across from him. At least he’s not sat with Ronald. Relieved as he is that he’s kept Draco’s secret, he can still feel the ghost of that punch.
“Mr Potter.”
Ron’s face turns from white to a blotchy red. “Harry, what the bloody hell is going on? Why is there a dead Malfoy in your kitchen?”
He palms Harry’s crotch where he’s already half hard, and pulls his trousers and boxers down together. Holding Harry in the circle of his fist, he begins to move up and down, until he’s finally ready. Pushing Harry gently to lie flat on his back, he takes him in his mouth without hesitation. Harry’s breath hitches, half reaching for Terran’s hair before changing his mind and twisting his hands into the bed sheets.
“What’s wrong, mate? Are you going to be sick? ‘Cause if you are do me a favour and throw up in that horrible vase Mum got us for Christmas.”
“Did you think I would fly off the handle just because Malfoy wrote you a letter?” asks Ron, incredulous.
“Yes,” says Harry, huffing in exasperation. “And calling us hooligans makes you sound about a hundred years old, by the way.”
He slides it across the table to Draco. “Maybe this will help.”
“Oh, because you’ve been so respectful to me, calling me an idiot every five seconds.”
“Tell me something new,” she says.
He gestures around him. “The wards, of course. They recognise me.”
“Nothing happened, that’s the problem.”
Harry nods again, and then he’s naked. He’s naked in the middle of Malfoy’s kitchen, and somehow the bastard is still fully dressed. Instead of feeling uncomfortable, it only makes him harder. Whereas yesterday he could feel the silk of Malfoy’s waistcoat against his dick, now he can feel the gentle scratch of his trousers, and it’s driving him fucking mad. The rub of the fabric is quickly replaced with Malfoy’s hand, giving him a beautifully brutal squeeze.
“Do you believe that Harry wants to have sex with you of his own free will?” he asks.
Weasley jumps to his feet. “I think I’d better go.”
“I’m not cooking you breakfast,” mumbles Harry, eyelids already drooping shut again.
“That’s right,” Draco nods. “Well, I noticed there’s a certain… dynamic we seem to fall into, when we have sex, and I wondered if you wanted to explore that further.”
“Stop.”
“Thank you,” says Andromeda. “This will be very helpful.” She puts the duck down, and claps her hands together. “I’d better get started on dinner. You’ll both stay, won’t you?
Up close, he can see the flecks of blue and gold in Potter’s green eyes. It’s like looking up through a canopy of trees in summer. Draco starts to worry his lovesickness is showing on his face, so he says something glib as a distraction.
He clears his throat. “Sorry about that. I think I rather killed the mood.”
They set off into the treetops, Draco using his shirt to collect ammunition, and Harry choosing to stay mobile and pick apples from trees as he flies. The first sails past Harry’s ear, and while he laughs, a second hits him in the shoulder. Soon unripe fruit flies through the air and is met with grunts of pain and squawks of laughter. It’s all the fun of a snowball fight without the wet gloves and cold hands; the elation of Quidditch without the pressure of an audience. He’d be covered in bruises, but what’s magic for if not smoothing over the inconvenient edges of life?
Before Harry knows what’s happening, there’s a hand pulling his own out to the side and another at his waist. Instinctively, he rests his spare hand on Draco’s shoulder at the same time he starts to protest.
Harry bites his lip. “You can keep fucking me,” he says.
Harry looks at it in shock, but recovers quickly. He puts his hand on Malfoys elbow, and they disapparate. They arrive in an alley, separating themselves immediately.
“Why do you do this?” he asks. “Why do you, you know. Look after me.”
“Yes, Draco.”
“My mother? When?”
It should feel condescending, coming from Draco, but instead it just makes Harry feel treasured. Safe. Not something he’d ever ask for from Malfoy of all people, but he finds himself drunk on it all the same.
“Why anyone would drink Firewhisky when the muggle stuff’s on offer, I don’t know,” he says.
They drink in silence for a moment.
Harry shrugs.
- I panicked.” She looks up at Draco again. “I truly am sorry. Granny’s told me about you, about how you’ve changed.”
“I thought it might upset you,” she explains. “Besides, I thought it would upset Harry even more, and I didn’t want to ask you to keep a secret from him.”
Arthur smiles haplessly. “Draco Malfoy.”
Draco stands, and lifts him into his arms like a child before placing him carefully back on the bed. He snags the covers from their pile at the foot of the bed and pulls them over Harry, before climbing in next to him.
“Ron, the Weasley’s. I’d never had it until I came to Hogwarts, the Dursley’s were more full English types.” He tucks into the food, and hums in appreciation.
He holds out his wand, and turns it so the hilt is facing Draco. Looking between Harry and the wand, Draco shakes his head. Without warning, he takes it from Harry’s loose grip. Draco twirls it between his long fingers, and blue sparks shoot out, fizzling and crackling. He looks down in surprise.
UPDATE: unfortunately there’s going to be a short break in posting. Ironically it’s partyly because I can’t stop dissociating, but also because I have uni deadlines. Don’t fear, it is not abandoned, and I’ll be back before you know it!
“What?” says Jones, a stupid look on his face. “No, no way. You need to listen to me. You can’t let that
Draco smiles. “Then we’ll do it.”
A small man in a dark green fedora reveals himself, and scurries closer. “Would you mind answering a few questions Mr Potter? It won’t take too long. Now, would you say Teddy Lupin is like a son to you? Have you been dating since the split from Miss Weasley? How would you describe your emotional state since-”
“No we didn’t,” retorts Harry. “I think I’d know if I’d had something.”
Potter picks at the duvet cover, pulling at invisible snags. “The next one’s tomorrow. Do you want to come?”
invite Draco?”
Weasley looks guiltily at his feet, and Draco sighs to himself. Like it or not, this ginger idiot is Harry’s friend. If he wants to keep him in his life, he needs to play nice.
“Fuck,” hisses Draco between hurried kisses. “You were amazing. You were perfect.”
“I stand corrected,” he says. “Unless you feel like sharing, Draco?”
Draco follows soon answer, hips losing their rhythm, fingernails carving white crescent moons into his hips. Draco collapses on top of him.
Additional warning in the end notes.
And he is enjoying himself. Potter’s taking the dildo deeper than he ever dared to take Draco, though he has the advantage of not needing to watch his teeth. He’s sucking on it shamelessly, spit dribbling from the corners of his mouth. He’s moving his chin up and down a little, but the angle isn’t right.
“I think it’ll be more moral support, the splinters are all yours.”
He rolls his eyes. “There’s no house elves anymore, and I live on my own. How did you think I fed myself?”
“Why?” he says obstinately. “Draco doesn’t own him, much as he wants to.”
“Are you sure?” he asks, voice less teasing and more serious. “I’ll have to tell them what’s happening. If we’re involving them in a scene, they need to consent.”
“In my defence,” says Harry. “At the time two people were unconscious, one couldn’t breathe, and then I collapsed as well.”
“You’re a glutton for punishment,” he says wryly.
Biting his lip to stop a moan escaping, Harry sinks down until he can feel woven fabric against his arse, the back of his thighs. It’s just as strange as the last time they did this. This way, it all feels so sudden and shocking, even though there’s no pain. But, Draco’s probably right. If he’d fingered him, he would get too wound up, he wouldn’t be able to last.
“Yes, and I’ve got to be up at four in the morning to get a portkey to Hawaii.”
Ron gestures to Harry’s scar with his fork. “So, is it… like that? Is it hurting again?”
He shifts uncomfortably in his seat. “It’s not that simple. There were things you did yesterday that would normally set me off, but it didn’t that time. And then, sometimes I think I’m fine with something and suddenly I can’t do it.”
“I’m sorry, Potter.” Draco scoops up the letters, hopefully they contain words of comfort from people better equipped to deal with this than he, and drops them with the paper onto Potter’s lap. “I know you were hoping to work things out.”
Harry relaxes. Usually, he’s not one for following rules, but right now the idea is comforting. If Draco tells him what to do, he can do it. He wants to be good for him.
Harry looks him over again, a little surprised. He looks so powerful compared to Harry, magic notwithstanding. It also makes him wonder what Draco sees in him. Would he prefer if Harry was bigger, if he had more muscles? Then again, he did seem to like how Harry fit in his lap, how he could cover him with his body.
Harry’s alarm goes off. It’s the first time he’d set it in weeks.
“Harry,” says Draco. “This is Angus. Angus, this is Harry.”
? He contacted Arthur because he knew he never read it, and Molly only really bothered with
Draco takes the vial from Weasley and holds it up to him, as if making a toast. “To trust,” he says, smiling bitterly.
Harry reminds himself to pull back, and breaths heavily. “Is this what you want?” He is wound so tightly he isn’t sure if his mouth wants to produce kisses or curses. “Are you sure you want to do this?”
Draco smiles, and presses a kiss to the fabric under his lips. The memory of his stag patronus cantering around his old bedroom in that poky flat drifts to the forefront of his mind. Suddenly, it feels a little less like a death sentence. A little more like hope.
Harry chokes on his own spit. Fuck. Why did he not think Draco would see the
Merlin, Draco hadn’t realised how much he’d missed these two.
Harry’s blood curdles.
And isn’t that just hilarious? Isn’t that just the icing on the cake of his life? Because Harry Potter is in love with Draco Malfoy, and he has no idea what to do about it. He isn’t exactly sure what Draco feels for him, aside from this vague ‘caring’, but love is too much to hope for. It’s too soon. He can’t expect him to fall as fast as Harry has.
“Alright, darling,” says Draco, wrapping around him, as if trying to replace those metaphorical koala trousers.
“Careful, baby,” says Terran, pulling his mouth away from his chest and leaving his fingers inside. “You nearly head butted me.”
Draco speaks slowly, enunciating every syllable. “It’s lunch time. I have bagels. Do you want one?”
Potter thumps his head down onto the sticky table and leaves it there.
or some such rubbish. They hurry into the back room.
“No one but the Aurors and the Curse Breakers,” answers Malfoy. “Nothing here is dangerous anymore, except for some unstable walls, but it’s still not what it used to be. Even if it was, it would need extensive renovation to be used for our purposes.”
“You did so perfectly, you deserve a reward. You can move now, darling. You can move, and you don’t have to be quiet.”
“You,” says Simi, pointing at Draco accusingly. “Bathroom. Now.”
“Yeah,” says Draco, sitting on the bed. “I’ll just-” Expression glazed over, he doesn’t finish his sentence. Instead he touches himself, moving his hand up and down his cock as he moves his eyes over Harry’s body.
Harry keeps quiet, waiting for Draco to continue.
Harry chews his bottom lip. “But what about Death? It can mean endings; what if it means he won’t want to be friends anymore?”
He even kept his job at first- a cashier at Tesco’s. It paid the bills okay, and it was easy enough once everything was explained to him. Sometimes the customers got snotty, but after living with Old Snakeface, a middle-aged woman with an invalid coupon was nothing. But then he’d be stacking shelves, and all he could think about was flicking his wand until they were all in order, labels facing outwards. The final straw was his manager, Tony. He’d always made fun of him for being posh, and he could take that on the chin. He’d speculate about whether Draco was bent, and he was used enough to that. The final straw was when Draco wanted a few days off to help Simi after they’d come out of surgery, and Tony refused, so he just left instead. So, in the end, quitting his job had nothing to do with magic.
“From about fifth year, but sixth year it really got out of hand.” Draco grins, and his teeth look sharp, dangerous. “I still hated you, you understand, but I’d wank to the thought of our fights ending a little differently.”
Draco kisses him quickly, there and gone again, like he can’t help himself. “There’s a spell I can use, to prepare you; I don’t like to use it often, but I don’t know how long I can wait. Can I use it?”
Harry shrugs. “I just cooked it. I usually got some baked beans, because my uncle didn’t like them, and Dudley would never eat the tomatoes or the mushrooms.”
People start arriving. First Ginny, who lets out a small giggle of hysteria when she sees Draco before clapping a hand over her mouth. Then George, who laughs and claps him a little too hard on the shoulder. Then Percy, who just blinks, before ignoring him completely. Then Bill and Fleur. Bill says greets him with “Malfoy” and shakes hands with him politely, if coolly. Fleur gives him the customary kiss on both cheeks. Granted, it’s in the middle of greeting everyone this way, and Draco’s sort of just gotten lost in the mix, but she does do it.  Finally, Ron and Hermione arrive.
Three of Cups: Celebration, Friendship, Creativity.
Draco crooks his fingers, stroking inside him. “You’ll probably come if I get you ready for my cock like this. We can’t have that, can we?”
Not to be outdone, Harry tugs Draco’s shirt the rest of the way off, and pulls him back on top of him. They let their bodies take the lead from there, pushing and pulling in time, until they can only gasp into each other’s mouths. Noise keeps escaping on his every outward breath, and suddenly his fingernails are digging into Draco’s shoulders as Harry comes. Draco’s eyes are half-lidded as he mumbles sweet nonsense into Harry’s neck. He runs his fingers through Draco’s hair until he finally stills as well.
Narcissa nods once again to Ron and Hermione, and walks back through the wall. Harry puts a lid on the pot and stands in front of the two people who know him better than anyone else. Hermione lifts the glass to her mouth again, studying Harry’s face too closely to notice her repeated mistake. Before it can reach her mouth Ron switches it back to wine, in one of the small gestures of love that convince Harry they are perfect for each other.
The words settle like treacle on his brain- heavy and sticky and too, too sweet. Harry makes another little noise, smaller and more helpless than he can ever remember making before.
Draco turns his nose up slightly. “What you don’t understand Harry, is that if you’re important enough, people will wait for you.”
“Well then, if you’re not going to listen, I’ll just have to show you.”
Harry’s heart turns a hundred and eighty degrees in his chest. He sits up, grabs his wand from the bedside table, and casts his Patronus. The heron is not identical to the one Draco cast. Draco’s crest of feathers was neat, like a crown. Harry’s looks ruffled, like it’s just been in a fight and it might get in another one. It lands on the bedpost.
“She’s just a year old. Healthy as can be, and a worthy companion for the hero of the Wizarding world, if I do say so myself.”
“I’m sorry,” repeats Ginny, wincing.
Potter whines and buries his fingers in Draco’s hair, pulling tight enough that he can feel the sting of it.
The owl knocked with his beak again, and it was then that Harry saw the letter tied to its leg. Overcome with curiosity, Harry undid the latch and let him in, putting fear of his aunt aside and resolving to cross that bridge when he came to it. The bird hopped onto the seat next to him and stuck out his leg, clearly meaning for Harry to take the letter. He did as he was bid, and nearly dropped the envelope in shock when he saw his own name written there in green ink.
“Yes,” he whispers.
Standing in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place where they’d drunk cups of tea in the dark, Harry knows that he can’t stop loving Terran, not any time soon. But he also can’t be with him unless he can give him everything he needs. He’s barely been gone for five minutes, ignoring the concerned creaks of the cabinets, when he disapparates again.
Draco nods, looking surprised he remembered the name of his muggle friend. But if they’re calling on a mobile, it probably isn’t a wizard. The idea of a muggle who knows nothing about ‘The Boy Who Lived’ and who won’t be disgusted by what they’re doing because they do similar things themselves, knowing about what’s happening, doesn’t seem so bad.
“And my back is killing me,” says Harry, shuffling a little more upright and rubbing at his spine.
“Actually, that’s not a bad idea.” His voice is dirty and dangerous, as he says “Beg for it. Beg me to fuck you.”
“That’s brilliant,” says Harry. “Can you do woodwork?”
On Thursday, Terran breaks up with him. It’s date night again, and Terran is talking, but Harry can’t really hear him. He just catches snatches of platitudes and excuses. They’re going on a break, or at least that’s what he says. Reading between the lines, Terran doesn’t want to be with him if sex is off the table. Harry knows that its over.
Draco hums and keeps hold of his hand. “That sounds nice.”
“Because he’s Malfoy,” whines Ron.
“A purr can’t heal someone from that,” Aisling points out. “But I saw what was happening. It was like something was flowing from Harry into the cat, powering it.”
Potter’s eyes dart away, and he starts to fiddle with his beermat.
Harry’s stomach churns with protective rage. “Why not? How many people can do what you do? It’s nothing I’d even heard of before.”
“Well I’ve been doing some research-”
Malfoy winds a hand under Harry’s stomach to lift Harry’s hips off the table, and wraps his other hand around his cock. Harry inhales sharply. Malfoy’s balance is unsteady now, so he slides the hand on Harry’s stomach up to his chest and positions them so they’re almost upright, with Harry bracing his hands against the table. The new angle means Malfoy rubs inside him in a different way, and remembering that he wanted to hear him, he doesn’t stop the noises from spilling out.
“Yes,” he says. “What a stupid question, Weasley. I’ve hurt him many times, and you know it. Now, are you satisfied? Or are we going to keep going in circles forever?”
Zabini whisks off into another room and returns with a procession of clothes floating on hangers behind him.
Woof. It's finally done folks. At a whisker over 60,000 words, this is twice the length of the longest thing I've ever written so far. I've got a lot I need to say, so I'm going to put it in the end notes to save you the scroll if you don't want to read it.
The Star: Hope, Renewal, Spirituality.
Harry can’t remember deciding to kiss him, can’t remember leaning in, bridging the gap between their lips. He must have done, because one moment he’s standing on the cliff’s edge, and the next he’s falling from it. If their first kiss felt like a question, this one feels like an answer. Draco presses his certainty into Harry’s mouth through the shape of his lips, the fingers sliding into his hair. With Draco angled above him like this, leaning back, he feels off-balance. Like the only thing stopping him from tipping backwards is Draco’s hand on the back of his head, his shoulder. He feels a questioning flick of Draco’s tongue. The answer, again, is yes. He opens his mouth.
Draco preens. “Very nearly. It’s what I spent most of last year doing, and I’m only just finishing. It’s sort of like a puzzle, if that puzzle was also a bomb. You have to take it apart to get rid of the bits you don’t want, but if you take out the wrong piece at the wrong time it’ll explode.”
“You would. I’m surprised you can read at all.”
“And it’s pretty much exactly what I suspected,” Hermione continues. “Dying and coming back has changed things. You’re like a walking piece of death.”
“Harry Potter, sir.”
“I told you about my twin brother, and how he was the only one in my family who really cared for me. What I didn’t tell you, was that we were identical twins. My apparent lack of magic wasn’t the only reason my parents disapproved of me. After my brother died, he left everything to me. His money, his house, even his pocket watch. In his will he called me his sister, Lynn. My parents said that since he didn’t have a sister, only a brother, that everything would go to them.” Granny turns her face upwards, as if lost in memory. “They were rich, they could afford lawyers, and I had nothing. I stayed for Rowan’s funeral, then I took the pocket watch and ran.”
“What about him?” asks Harry, feigning ignorance and turning back to the stove.
But he’s missed something, the arsehole must have spoken.
“Er, well,” says Harry, hiding his embarrassment at his own boldness with a kiss to Draco’s neck. “This room is where we first kissed, isn’t it? And ever since I finished fixing it up, I’ve been thinking we should finish what we started.”
“Don’t be too harsh on old Sybil, she has her area. She had her big grand prophecy, but the subtler arts are beyond her. I work on a smaller scale,” she explained. “We all have our talents.”
He’s not sure if Potter’s asking because he thinks the idea is so abhorrent that he’ll run the other way yelling if he finds out Draco wants it as something more than dirty talk, or if it’s something he’s interested in. Draco prays to whoever’s listening that it’s the second one. He pulls back a bit, so he can gauge Potter’s expression.
“Does he know how you feel?” asks Pansy, voice uncharacteristically gentle.
Potter’s eyes are completely shut now, cheek resting on the pillow. If it weren’t for the way he’s endlessly gripping and releasing the bunched-up sheets in his fists, Draco would think he’s asleep. The way his cock nudges softly inside, barely moving back and forth, reminds him of the way Potter suckled on his cock, his fingers. He thinks Potter found that comforting, and that’s the reason why he’s doing this right now. Potter needs soothing, reassuring.
“You know, Simi was right,” says Draco. “You should come on Saturday.”
Draco stands on the doorstep looking pale, and unsure of himself.
Harry tries to think of all the things he loves about Terran. His brash sense of humour. His affectionate touches. The quiet nights they spent talking about everything and nothing. They get on well, most of the time. Is that enough? These days Harry’s not so sure.
Harry wrenches himself from Malfoy’s grip and apparates home. He wants to fall apart in peace.
“Alright, alright,” he huffs. “I’ll find the treats.”
Draco has a few ideas why it might appeal to someone with his particular issues, but this isn’t the time for armchair psychology.
Harry frowns, disbelieving, but doesn’t argue. Draco sighs, sobering up a bit.
“Thanks,” he says, before blowing on his tea as instructed.
“I saw the article in the
Harry gestures for him to lead the way, and Malfoy complies. Rain starts drumming down on their backs just as they reach the front doors. They’re made of dark wood, intricately carved with magical creatures, but there’s a deep gouge running from the left handle up to the top of the door.
are scratched into his memory like initials on a tree trunk. Harry hopes they’ll never get tired of saying yes to each other.
“Well Earl Grey, it looks like you’re going in the paper.”
“Did you see that?” crows Draco, turning to Harry with eyes ablaze. “I'm not sure exactly, but it's either an egret, a heron, or a crane."
The words look forced out of him. He’s gripping his refilled cup of tea so tightly the handle might snap off into his refined hand. Harry knows this is his idea of a nightmare, and he can commiserate. It’s a nightmare for him too. He hasn’t even told Ron and Hermione, and what if they can tell? What if they can just sense it, somehow?
“No, I thought not, given that you grew up with them. I didn’t either.” Draco smiles weakly. “Can you imagine how my father would have reacted? But in first year, I did join a book club.”
“You can lie down later, but right now you’re going to do what you said and be a good boy for me.” He grabs Harry’s shoulders and turns him round to face the wall, grabbing Harry’s hands to place them on the tile. “Aren’t you?”
Harry leans his head on Draco’s shoulder. “Well, you
This time, when dinner’s over, he doesn’t leave right away. He’s not willing to waste any time in Harry’s presence, whether he’s surrounded by people who hate him or not. They settle back in the living room, and this time he makes sure they’re sat together. Even just having their thighs pressed together, their shoulders touching, makes something settle inside of him. This close, he can smell the familiar scent of him; the one he looks for whenever he buries his nose in Harry’s hair.
He talks fast, trying his best to keep his words clear. “There are three injured people at Granny Lynn’s shop in Diagon Alley, it’s urgent. Please come quickly.”
Ron rolls his eyes and takes the glass from her. “Maybe we should switch to water.”
He doesn’t finish his sentence. Not because he doesn’t know how, but because he’s unnerved by the ending. He wants to give Draco control. He already has, a bit, but now he wants to do it consciously.
Not a long chapter, but I wanted to give you something to gnaw on.
She unfreezes and goes to sit with him at the table. She begins to play with her hair, like she always does when she’s uncomfortable. “Luna and I are together.”
Harry bristles. “No. Thank you for listening, and thank you for holding out on making fun of me for as long as you did, but we’re not doing this.”
“What’s everyone having?” he asks, standing up. “I think it’s my round.”
“Well You-Know-Who didn’t have shit on me,” she says. “Do you remember when Daphne Greengrass spilled punch down my dress at the Yule ball, just because I called her a fugly slag?”
“Whisky, please. Jura if they have it.” Potter raises his eyebrows, and Draco smirks. “Don’t give me that look, Potter; I don’t drink beer and I know you’re loaded.”
Draco smiles. “That’s about the size of it. Besides, you’re insulting yourself in all the wrong ways.”
Harry places a hand on his friend’s shoulder. “I’ll help you, mate.”
Harry nods. “Good. He missed you and Millie.”
Eventually, Millicent sighs. “I’d better be off; I’ve got work tomorrow. Why we do this on Wednesday nights I’ll never know.”
Draco’s grin is sly as he says “I know what to do.”
“I think I’ll manage, Granger.”
“So what did you actually want to talk about?” wonders Draco.
“I might have to, seeing as I talked about more than one thing.”
He repeats it to himself like a mantra, trying to prepare himself, so the disappointment won’t show on his face as he opens the door. Taking a steadying breath, he turns the handle.
Narcissa raises one perfect eyebrow in a way Harry has never been able to master. “And what is this plan?”
“You keep saying that, and yet you’re not actually moving.” Harry turns to go, and actually takes a few steps towards the door, when Malfoy speaks again. “Wait. There really was something I wanted to talk to you about. What I actually wanted to do was apologise.”
Harry sits down next to him, instead of opposite like he usually does. “What do you think the problem is?”
Ron claps him on the shoulder on his way back to the table. “Everything okay, mate?”
Harry hears a low buzz of a response not loud enough to hear.
She stands. “Believe it or not Mr Potter, I am not overcome with lust for you. I’ll leave that to your Witch Weekly Fanclub.”
“It has to be applied directly,” he says, biting his lip as he reads the label. He doesn’t need to, he made it after all, but for some reason he can’t look Potter in the eyes. “Do you want me to do it, or…”
“Why?” asks Draco, his eye catching on where the dressing gown is falling open slightly, revealing Harry’s nipple.
Harry shakes his head.
Finch-Fletchely shakes his head bemusedly. “My dreams are always about sitting exams I haven’t studied for, or my teeth falling out.” He sighs, and sticks his hand out. “Anyway, hullo Malfoy. It’s been a while, hasn’t it?”
Draco’s answering laugh is carefree, without any of the callous undertones of his youth, and Harry wants to make it happen again as soon as possible. “Before the war I wanted to hurt you more than anything.” His smile becomes smaller, and he lies back on the grass, watching wisps of cloud blow away into nothing. “Even a week ago I still hated you. I even hated you for testifying at my trial, but I didn’t want to hurt you anymore. I don’t want to hurt anyone. I’ve had my fill, more than my fill.”
“You’re such a bitch,” he says, sighing into the soothing motions of her hands in his hair.
Hermione sighs. “I know it’s hard, it’s hard for all of us, but you need to go outside sometime.” She props herself up on her elbow to narrows her eyes at him. “Are the ghosts still following you?”
“Are you alright?” asks Hermione before continuing. “Yes, it was all over the Prophet. Not that I read it of course, but you know how gossipy the Ministry is.”
Weasley’s gaze is still steely. “Are you manipulating Harry in any way at all?”
Draco pauses, lips just brushing over Harry’s. “Can I?” he repeats, softer this time.
“What? No, he hasn’t!”
“Since when were you bothered about Quidditch, Hermione?” asks Harry, looking up at her.
Jones ignores him, and turns to Harry with a pleading expression. “Why him? Why him and not me?”
Harry shook his head solemnly. “I’m sorry Mr Owl, but I don’t my aunt and uncle would like a bird in the house. Aunt Petunia likes things tidy, and you might get your feathers everywhere and leave droppings.”
“Where should I look first?” asks Harry, looking between them.
(See the end of the chapter for
Samuel laughs, rich and deep. “Now, you look like a man on a mission. I hope I’m not keeping you from anything.”
Harry frowns. “I’m sorry to hear that, but why are you in my bedroom?”
If you want to chat I'm @moss-on-a-log on tumblr!
She’s still sharp it seems.
They kiss slowly, unhurried, like falling into a pleasant dream. Draco’s quieter than normal, not speaking as he prepares him, his low breaths dancing over Harry’s thighs and stomach. Harry’s eyes fall closed as he lays back and lets himself be taken care of, drifting in a haze of simmering pleasure. Draco keeps dotting kisses on his knee, his hip, the arch of his foot. Each one feels like an expression of praise, written in a different language. A subtler one than usual.
“Good,” says Harry, trying to hide his own smile.
“Do you think my dream will come true then?”
Harry leans back in the chair and closes his eyes. He can’t find it in himself to be surprised that she knows about them. “Draco’s on the ground, and he can’t move. I’m holding his hand, and in my other hand is the pocket watch from the waiting room, except I think its broken.”
, and Harry takes a moment to be thankful someone else has dealt with her. He’s also had enough of chasing dark wizards and witches.
“Why?”
“Sex thing?” snaps Harry. “Yeah. He said it wasn’t, but it was.”
Zabini cackles. “Oh, that’s brilliant. One day you’re defeating dark wizards with the power of friendship and just-shagged hair, and a few years down the line, you’re like a teenage girl who can’t find a dress for the Yule ball.”
Harry panics. He might not hate her anymore, but he certainly doesn’t want the ghost of a middle-aged woman haunting his bedroom. “Wouldn’t you prefer to spend time with Malfoy? You said he’s alone.”
is more of a concept than a real person. For almost ten years he’s been someone to fight, to hate, to compete with. ‘
The house is empty of ghosts when he returns, but Bunny’s waiting on the rooftop, and flies down to land on his shoulder as he unlocks the front door. “Are you waiting for a reply?” he asks.
He starts tracing the counters with his wand absentmindedly. “I used to visit my Great Aunt Walburga here when I was little. I never went in the kitchen though, we always ate in the dining room.”
“A distraction, you say?”
“What a view,” he says into Harry’s ear, meeting his eyes in the mirror, before roaming over his body. “I could look at you all day.”
Harry grits his teeth. “It is when you’re acting like we’re still at school.”
“It is for me, but I know you have a lot on your mind. I can help with some of it.”
“Are you sure you’re not feeling… mischievous?”
“That depends,” he says, folding his arms. “Are we counting blow jobs or just anal?”
thinks Draco.
Of course he still wants to come, but that doesn’t make him any less anxious. As usual Draco directs this nervous energy into obsessing over what to wear. He needs to give the exact right impression. Obviously they’ve all met before, so first impressions are out the window, but he needs to show he’s changed. He can’t have them thinking he’s the same old tosser he was before. He’s still a tosser, but he’s definitely not the same.
Harry spent that night in the cupboard, too. Their nurse, Mrs Figg, locked him in. She bade him goodnight just as calmly as if she was tucking him into bed. The nurse didn’t tell him what he was being punished for, and she didn’t remark on the blood drying on face. Harry curled himself into a ball, hugging his knees. He told himself over and over that he wasn’t afraid of the dark.
“They’ve just finished their Master’s degree, and want to celebrate with an inordinate amount of booze, and weed, and fun people,” he says. “It’s not that complicated.”
Wheel of Fortune: Luck, Destiny, Crossroads.
“Tomorrow,” she says, throwing him a set of keys. “Now, lock up for me will you? Earl will be fine on his own for a few hours.”
“Yes, I imagine many a witch and wizard has warmed themselves at night imagining being tupped by you. A dashing hero with a giant dick, muscles rippling, buttons flying in the heat of passion.” He waves his hand in a studied manner, meant to inflict maximum condescension. “Etcetera, etcetera.”
Not that he’s being completely unselfish, of course.  There’s still a nagging voice in the back of his head that says if he leaves Potter alone for too long, he’ll find someone else to give him what he needs. He knows it’s not forever, but he wants to cling to what he can get for as long as possible. Draco doesn’t like to dwell on what’ll happen when Potter gets bored- that’s a problem for another day. For now, he’ll just have to make sure he’s never boring.
that’s cutting him to pieces, leaving him certain that he’ll never be able to pick himself up from this table.
“What?” squawks Hermione.
Harry hums in agreement. “Will you stay?”
Harry thinks back. Before he met Draco again, before the war. He’d always noticed boys. He’d always noticed how tall they were, how they grinned as they let him in on a joke. Everyone always talked about how handsome Lockhart was, so why was it different if he thought so too? Harry had assumed that all boys thought these things, noticed these things, but maybe he was wrong. Maybe it was just that Draco was the first man to make him feel the way Cho had, Ginny had. Maybe he could have more with Draco.
Malfoy looks down his nose at him. “Do I look like a farmer, Potter?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy leans in close. “The regulars,” he whispers.
Harry wakes to a cold palm on his forehead. Perhaps that’s what had made him dream of pressing his head together with Draco’s. Granny removes her hand, and raises her eyebrows in a silent question.
Draco freezes. His mind is split into two halves. On the one hand, wild horses could not drag him into that pub. It’s going to be filled with people who know all the worst things Draco Malfoy’s ever done in his life, and some of those things he did to them personally. He sent letters of formal apology, after his exile was over and he was allowed to use owls again, but he hasn’t faced anyone except Luna in person. Unless you count that whole debacle at the Burrow, but he’s mostly blocked that from his memory out of sheer awkwardness. He knows Luna would spend time with him, but he wouldn’t want to monopolise her, so he’d be sat there like a gooseberry the rest of the time. Although, if Potter’s inviting him, that does imply he’ll acknowledge his existence. But keeping this secret, as he’s sure Potter wants, is hard enough without alcohol in the mix.
The water is warm, lapping at his chest, and Draco’s chest is firm and strong behind him. He’s so relaxed he might fall asleep then and there, with a low voice murmuring in his ear. The steam makes curls at his temples, and smells of the cheap soap he always buys. Vaguely, he wishes he had something a little fancier. If they do this again, he’ll have to make sure he has bubble bath, oils, that sort of thing. Draco’s bathroom had been full of products like that, and he wants to give him the best of everything.
“Yes, it’s fundamental to the process.”
Draco nods. “I’d like to talk to your house elf.”
“Don’t say anything,” hisses Granny, removing the ropes from her niece with a careful motion of her wand and concentrated furrow in her brows.
Still, he clearly doesn’t mind. He’s hard and breathless and raking his nails down Draco’s neck and under his collar. It’s not all that comfortable for Draco, either. His arms are beginning to burn; Harry is a full-grown man, even if he is short, and he’s supporting nearly all of his weight. He can’t even pretend to care. He just continues to suck and lick and Harry’s neck, replacing all the marks that have disappeared over the last few days.
This time it’s Harry who can’t help kissing him, and his eyes are closed when he feels the usual two spells, followed by the new one. He gasps. It’s strange and shocking. He’s suddenly wet and open, his inner muscles twitching and clenching reflexively.
If they’re going to do this, for the first time, it’s not happening on a sofa. Draco breathes his answer, so quiet Harry mostly reads it on his lips. Harry apparates them straight to the bedroom; he doesn’t want to wait any longer. They collapse onto the bed together, and Harry pulls Draco to lie on top of him. He wants to pretend the rest of the world doesn’t exist, wants to shut it out and fill the space with Draco.
Harry needs to outsource this dilemma to someone who knows what they’re doing. Ron and Hermione are out of the question. Not only would Ron rather die than help Harry do anything to impress a Malfoy, but neither are very invested in fashion. He’s always admired Luna’s unique style, but he doesn’t think edible earrings and hand-sewn dresses are the solution here. Ginny would just laugh. Maybe he needs to think a little wider. Zabini is always impeccably turned out, but they’re not close friends. They only ever see each other at the monthly pub nights. Still, Harry gets the feeling he might help him anyway.
“Alright,” he says, stroking his hair. “Just a bit longer.”
“But you were rubbish at Divination,” says Ron.
Harry turns to Ginny, and tries to sound confident. “I think I’m bisexual.”
“Good morning, Mrs Malfoy.”
When Harry arrives in the kitchen, Draco presents him with a mug of tea. It’s exactly how he likes it, and Harry wonders when he learned how Harry takes his tea. Probably when Harry learned how Draco takes his, staring at him from across the Great Hall day after day. Draco’s never been in his kitchen, as far as he knows, but he certainly seems at home. A guest making him tea in his own house would usually rankle, but for some reason it’s different coming from Draco.
“I’m not really sure yet, but it’s coming along.”
“The rules are a little different today,” he says. “The first one is the same. Keep your hands where I put them; don’t touch yourself unless I tell you to.”
“If you’re instinct says baby, then that’s what it is. If you doubt every prediction you’ll make you might as well not make them at all.”
him. He can’t breathe, he can’t speak. He shoves roughly at Draco’s shoulder and springs from the bed, clutching at the bedpost for support. He’s breathing faster and faster, so why does it feel like he’s getting no air? Perhaps someone cast a curse to remove all the oxygen from the room.
“Sorry,” he rasps, feeling penitent. “I’ll stop.”
“Yes, I expect so,” she says.
“This is not what I expected,” says Draco, looking round his kitchen.
Malfoy lets out a deep sigh. “It happened, didn’t it?”
“Sometimes, when Mrs Figg tells me too,” he admitted. “I prefer books with illustrations.”
He hides his head in Draco’s chest but he can’t stop crying. He manages to prevent any more embarrassing sobs from escaping, but his breath is still stopping and starting like an old car. Draco’s arms are warm and strong around him, and he clutches at his back in return.
“Um, it’s really stupid,” he says.
“You’re still wearing everything,” says Harry, breathless but still sharp.
He can feel a small shake starting underneath him, growing until Blaise is roaring with laughter. He pushes Draco off him and wipes a tear from his eye. “Only you, Draco. Only you could feel bad about that.”
“And ball jokes are the height of comedy?” Harry counters.
in 1989. Picking up the battered magazine, he settles into the lumpy cushions. A few minutes later, Draco leaves the room looking shaken.
“Why do you think we like it?” asks Harry. “I don’t really understand.”
“Hey!”
Someone knocks at the door. Harry jumps to his feet, treacherous hope brewing in his chest.
“This is brilliant,” says Andromeda. “What spell did you use?”
“You’re adorable,” says Draco, his smile turning sly and teasing.
“Shut up, Malfoy.”
“Good afternoon, Mr Potter.”
Draco cleans them up properly this time, feeling a pang of regret as he watches the dripping mix of come and lube and salve wash out of Potter’s arsehole. Maybe he should ask Potter if he can leave it there one time. Draco sighs. It’s dangerous to make plans; they have a way of falling apart.
“In your fantasy- what do you say?”
Harry and Dudley were left alone again, a state of affairs that never boded well for him.
“You know,” says Potter slowly. “I’m beginning to suspect you’re some kind of…morning person.”
Draco blinks, and pushes himself up on his elbow to face Harry. “No you don’t.”
“Erm, hello, sorry,” says Harry. “You’re obviously busy. It’s not urgent, I’ll go.”
He feels feverish. He closes his eyes. Draco whispers in his ear “If you save my life again I’m going to have to kill you.”
So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, goodnight!
Her eyes get impossibly wider. “Of course not! Come through, Harry. I’ll make us all some tea.”
Hermione launches herself at him, tackling him into a powerful hug, her hair catching in his mouth. “I’m so proud of you. We love you so much, and I hope you know this could never change anything.” She sits back, and cups his face in her hands. “You’re family, and whoever you decide to be with, they’ll be family too.”
Steam fills the kitchen. Wooden cabinets line the walls and copper pots and pans hang from hooks, gleaming in the shifting light. Over the years it’s gotten to look more and more like the kitchen in The Burrow, full of noise and activity, something always moving. But then, it’s Molly who showed him how comforting a kitchen can be, so it’s not surprising he’s modelled it after hers. One of the cabinets gives him a warning creak, alerting Harry the second before strong arms wrap around him from behind. He still jumps.
“What do you mean?” Draco asks, furrowing his brow. “It’s not
of it.
, not my glasses! Give those back!”
“Sorry,” Potter says, “That was out of line.”
“Draco, fuck, yes,” Harry babbles out. “Yes, yes, I—
“I’m sorry,” he says, his voice hoarse. “I won’t do that again.”
“Fine,” Draco says, closing his eyes. “I want to, okay?”
“You don’t have to be an extrovert to be too willing for other people,” Malfoy muttered, and Harry thought it was the first sentence Malfoy had ever spoken that made Harry undeniably want to kiss him again.
The flames dancing in the fireplace caught the corner of his eye, and he looked over, jumping when the flames suddenly turned green.
She’s silent for a moment. “I know you want to help him,” she says eventually. “And that’s really awful, but—you can’t keep giving everyone all of you.”
Hermione’s eyes widen. “Oh no, Harry, what happened?”
“Good,” Draco says, adjusting his head on the pillow.
Harry yawns so wide his jaw cracks. “God, I’m tired. Do you mind if I stay?”
“I see you have company,” says Narcissa.
Additional warning in the end notes.
he vaguely hears himself chanting between kisses. Potter is reaching inside him and moving everything around, rearranging the furniture of his soul. He’s constructing Draco a new reality. One where Potter could love him back.
Draco keeps jerking his hips, still hitting that sensitive spot, making Harry keen with overstimulation. He kisses Harry almost chastely as he stills, filling him with a wet warmth. Harry deepens the kiss, using it to show everything he’s feeling, even if he’s not sure what that is.
“Malfoy?”
Weasley takes a small vial out of his pocket. It’s perfectly clear, and looks innocent as water. “Three drops should do it, they said.”
The voice is weak, but definitely present. “Here, duckie.” In the back room Granny is settling herself back into her chair, looking shaken but unharmed. “Set her down on the chair, Draco.”
“But this wasn’t like that, it was just normal sex,” he says.
He raises his own hand, tries to lay it over hers in a familiar gesture, but it passes through to his own skin. He begins to cry. “Why?”
Zabini shakes his head. “Well, Potter. In a rare show of genius, you’ve come to the right place.”
Draco’s hurt Potter so many times it’s probably hypocritical of him to be so incensed, but he can’t help it.
Potter sucks on the head for a last, long second, as if he doesn’t want to stop. Draco hauls him to his feet and back against the books, shoving his thigh between his legs. His jeans are still done up, trapping his erection under tight denim, and it must be killing him. He grabs Potter’s hips, moving them to rub up against him.
Harry sighs, and sits up straight. “I’m not going to be sick. I am attracted to Draco Malfoy.”
Harry bristles. “I wasn’t blaming you, Malfoy. I was trying to tell you this will take a long time.”
Narcissa wrenches herself away, and almost flies through the wall in her hurry to leave. A breath is punched from Draco’s lungs, not quite a sob, and not quite a shout. He collapses back onto his knees, and Harry rushes forwards. He’d watched the encounter in mute distress, and now he only feels terror. Draco is here, and in pain, and Harry has no idea how to help him. His hands hover over Draco’s shoulders, before pulling him into an embrace. Draco leans in for a moment, burying his face into Harry’s neck, before abruptly shoving Harry backwards. He almost falls onto his back, not expecting the attack.
Determined to take his mind off things, he sends Arthur an owl asking about the Manor’s restoration. He replies promptly, with a message saying he’s there now, and if Harry is free, he could come over straight away to draw up some plans. Harry puts on some practical muggle clothes, and apparates outside the Manor gates. One iron gate swings from its bottom two hinges, squeaking pitifully in the October wind. The greying white stone of the Manor looks like a broken tooth against the bloodless gums of the sky. Two figures walk down the long drive towards him, weeds pushing up through the gravel. One he recognises by the balding ginger head as Arthur, but the other figure is taller, dressed in black, with a suspiciously pale head of hair. Shit. Why wouldn’t he expect Malfoy to be there to make plans for his own house? Then again, Arthur didn’t mention him. Maybe this is another instance of Arthur keeping quiet until the deed was done.
“I’m not going anywhere until Harry tells me why he’s been giving it up to
He went on a few dates after that, but none were promising, until he met Raphael. Raphael was a muggle, and had no idea he’d killed a dark wizard and also died himself. It was brilliant. After a few fun dates, they went back to Raph’s house. They couldn’t go back to Grimmauld, as it was too obviously magical. Things started well, until Raphael asked Harry to fuck him. Harry had a panic attack and fled the house. Thus begins the tale of Harry Potter’s incurable virginity.
The waiting room is tiny, lined with chairs, and mainly filled with shelves displaying trinkets and odd pieces of art. On a coffee table is a copy of Witch Weekly, so old that Celestina Warbeck smiles up from the cover with all her original teeth. An old woman in a wheelchair enters through a bead curtain from the back room.
Draco’s answering smile is gracious. “Of course, Molly. I’ll try to remember.”
Draco casts a quick
“Well, it’s probably not the one that breaks the statute of secrecy, Hermione,” says Harry.
Trigger Warnings:
Draco laughs, shaking his head in wonder. “I didn’t even know it was a competition, but you always have to win, don’t you?”
They move to the next room. A fourposter bed not unlike Harry’s own sits at the centre of the room, though everything is so smothered in dust that any colours are drowned out by grey. Malfoy’s nose wrinkles, and he casts a quick cleaning charm, but it doesn’t completely remove the grime.
Harry laughs. “Why don’t I just leave you two alone for a bit. I promised you lunch.”
Terran smiles softly. “Let’s go to bed.”
“Um, a Spitfire please,” requests Potter.
. The sandstone brickwork is covered in the ghostly shapes of ivy that’s since been removed, but left its mark behind.
Draco manhandles him into position, pushing his head down to lie on Draco’s shoulder, resting the book on his back. This position would be comfortable, domestic, if it weren’t for the dick that’s so hot and hard inside him. Harry settles down, breathing deeply. He lets go; Draco will decide when to fuck him, not Harry. It doesn’t matter that his body is screaming for release. All that matters is being good, and still, and quiet.
His words ring a faint bell, an echo of another conversation. Another kiss. The thought fades as fast as it came- overtaken by the press of Draco’s thigh against his dick. He removes Harry’s glasses, barely pulling back far enough to take them off, and tucks them into his breast pocket. Little red lines mark his face from where the metal frames have pressed in. He kisses Harry again, several short kisses, like he means to stop but keeps being reeled back in.
The prick shakes his head, not even looking back at Potter. “I’m not going to wait forever, and neither is anyone else.” He doesn’t even bother buttoning up his shirt before he strides over to the door, glancing back only to say: “Get your shit together, Harry.”
He shakes his head, not even looking back at Harry. “I’m not going to wait forever, and neither is anyone else.” He doesn’t even bother buttoning up his shirt before he strides over to the door, glancing back only to say: “Get your shit together, Harry.”
“Yes,” he says, looking almost through Harry. “I did want to know.”
“Fuck no. Guess I’ll have to learn.” Ron twists his fork around, gathering up the strands of spaghetti. “So what did you want to talk about?”
Draco’s mouth moves down towards his neck, thumb sliding underneath the collar of his t-shirt. Harry takes advantage of their new position to dance kisses over Draco’s face. Along his jaw, up the line of his cheekbone, over the soft skin of his temple. The kisses are almost too tender, too innocent for how heated things have become, but Harry doesn’t care. Draco doesn’t seem to mind either, because his hand traces a similar path over Harry’s face. He reaches the scar, and touches it so lightly it tickles.
said Draco, wondering if magic had a scent their sensitive noses could pick up on. Of course, he’d forgotten who he was with. Simi leaned in, sniffed, and nodded.
Harry whimpers.
“She nearly killed Draco!” spits Harry.
Harry coughs, an embarrassing flush rising on his cheeks. The words were innocent, but the way Draco said them seemed so suggestive.
They sit like that for a moment, Harry still in his lap. Draco strokes up and down his back, as if Harry needs comforting. Looking at Draco’s face- a little lost, a little panicked- he wonders if he’s actually trying to comfort himself. His face changes, putting on a mask of smug satisfaction, erasing any lingering traces of distress. Should Harry say something? Before he can think of what to say, or ask, Draco speaks.
Malfoy’s sadness is still clear in the bags under his eyes, the tightness of his jaw, but lightened by childish humour. Distraction is clearly the way forward, even if it means Harry has to provoke him. It’s not like he doesn’t have practice. “No, you’re right. He’s way funnier than you.”
Harry leaves the shop newly employed as a dog walker.
Draco suspects that’s an understatement. He’s always downplaying his own pain, be that physical or emotional.
She looks away, unable to meet his eyes. “Draco is alone, and I can’t leave him to struggle by himself, so I’m calling in my debt. I saved your life, Mr Potter. That creates a contract, and I’m asking you to honour it.”
“Yes,” says Draco, exasperated. “That is the basic concept.”
“Well,” says Draco, following him into the kitchen. “I made an absolute tit of myself last time I was here, in case you didn’t notice.”
Malfoy grins and leans back in his chair. “Well?
Harry waits silently, studying her face.
“Yeah,” he agrees. “But you’re
“Show me what you’ve got,” says Harry firmly.
“Of course,” says Draco. He takes an empty mug from the bedside table, casts a quick
Sending the letter off with Roberta, Harry disapparates. His house is relatively tidy; years of the Dursley’s punishments for any speck of dust left on the mantelpiece means he can’t leave a dish or a newspaper lying around without feeling anxious. It’s his house, and he still feels like someone’s going to scream at him if he dares to get it messy. The bedroom however, is a different story. Maybe it’s because he didn’t have a bedroom for so long, and when he did all his things were locked in a cupboard, but this room seems to have different rules. There are shirts strewn over the back of his desk chair, a lone sock on the floor, and a mug on the windowsill. It’s not a tip, but it’s certainly more relaxed. Almost regretfully, Harry tidies up a little. If things go better than he expects they actually will, they might end up back here.
“Really? Well, I suppose that’s fine for… informal occasions.”
Draco looks stricken, his face pale. He knows that Simi’s a muggle, so they definitely don’t know his name because of that. The only thing that makes sense is that Draco’s mentioned him, but why would that make him look so panicked?
So he kisses him again. And he doesn’t intend to stop. Draco seems to agree, because he wraps one arm around his back, puts one hand at his waist, and holds him so tightly he might burst. Distantly, Harry recognises it’s good to feel like he doesn’t have to be strong. He can be, but he doesn’t have to be. He lets Draco take the lead, pushing him back onto the sofa.
He no longer laughs.
“Like you can talk,” Harry mutters. “You’re literally a vampire. You can’t even be out during the day.”
between us, and it’s never going to happen again.”
“Draco—” Harry is on him, gathering him into his arms.
He thinks, with some amount of resignation, that he was probably right the other night—about falling in love with him. But loving him means that he’ll do what Draco wants, what he needs, and if Draco needs them to stay just friends, then he’ll do it.
Malfoy gives him a flat look. “I don’t care,” he says.
“The potion,” Harry says finally, quietly, dully. “I Vanished the potion.”
“Sometimes other people are very tiring,” Malfoy says, and Harry thinks he knows what he means. “Especially with the work at Mungo’s—every potion has to be done as quickly as possible. Which is fine, because I’m aware lives are at stake, but that means the head nurses like to badger us potions researchers about product volume even when we’re on break. It’s quite annoying. Potions don’t just brew faster because you want them to.”
Draco thinks of the bland expression he’s taught himself to wear in public and at work, trying the best he can not to step on anyone’s toes, and he has to grimace. “Well, what else am I supposed to do? If someone says I’ve so much looked at them wrong, it could violate my parole, so.” He’s trying not to be bitter about it, but he’s really very bitter all the same.
“Horny, are you?” Draco rolled his eyes. “Sorry. Not interested in casual sex.” He turned his head back to his pillow, and Harry groaned in annoyance.
for me.”
Father is beyond hating at this point—it seems Mother was the last thing keeping him from giving in to the Dark Lord’s will completely, and he didn’t even flinch when Draco was given his mission.
“It’s nice out, and I can’t sleep at night. So why not?” Harry sat up, shrugging. “You didn’t do anything to hurt me.”
“Yes, Daph visits sometimes, but it’s not nearly enough.” She shrugs half-heartedly. “Sometimes I feel like I’m losing my mind.”
Their bedroom is lit only by a single torch, hanging in the middle of the room. Harry watches the shadows of the flames flickering on the wall in front of his face, struggling against the bonds that Draco—no,
It’s Draco’s Allure, he realizes. He’s almost sure of it.
Harry lets out an uneasy sigh. “Maybe you just didn’t do the movement quite right?” he says.
love her. Just not romantically. He really only brought her up earlier just to make Potter feel worse, if he’s to be honest.
,” Harry gasps, because he’s hard and Draco’s hard and he can’t help but roll his hips against him, the material of their trousers sliding roughly together.
Fuck. He’s already much too invested in this, and they’re not even dating.
Which is well and good, because Potter’s breath is lengthening in a way that makes Draco think he’s falling asleep anyway.
“And anyway,” Malfoy says, “You
Draco himself had ended up shirtless—it was much too warm outside to be otherwise, and besides, he was drunk and everyone else was doing it—but his drunk self hadn’t managed to account for the fact that Potter might
“Ugh, my legs,” Harry groans, still shaky, muscles screaming with the strain of standing that way for so long. He’d been able to ignore it when Draco was fucking him, but now that it’s over the soreness is all he can think about.
Finally after hours of paperwork and a trip to Gringotts and back, the flat is in his name. He unpacks, restlessness itching under his skin, and when he’s done he immediately leaves the flat, walking down the street to who knows where. It begins to drizzle. He’s too exhausted to cast an
“It’s probably for the best,” Draco says, even though part of him wants to take it back, to just keep holding Potter and forget anything bad ever happened between them.
They finally arrive at work, and it dawns on Draco for the second time that no matter what, even if this horrid curse gets lifted, they’re still going to have to work together for the foreseeable future.
He’s a good liar, but he wishes he was better at lying to himself. To cast Avada Kedavra, you have to mean it, and he has the sinking feeling that he’s not capable of even pretending to want Potter dead.
He supposes it’s the type of thing that people never truly get over.
It’s still his home.
But it’s okay, he thinks, glancing over at Potter with warmth in his cheeks.
” Potter says, and then they’re shaking together, rolling their hips as they come, Potter spurting hot and deep inside of Draco.
Hermione laughs. “Not from working at the hospital, no,” she says, shoving the pad back in her purse. “Healers can still get sick, obviously, but we have all sorts of safeguards in place while we’re working so that we don’t carry pathogens from the patients. There was a whole unit on the rise of safety techniques in Healing during our History of Magic class in fourth year, you should know that.”
But no, it’s simply the Amortentia, and after a few seconds her smell fades to a more manageable level, replaced with the smell of the Hogwarts Quidditch field and the pastries Mother used to make at Christmas.
After the weird feeling of disorientation goes away, Draco gets his bearings and looks around. They’re at Blaise’s party, but it’s not the one he’d been expecting—instead, he spies a large banner hovering over the stage where the Weird Sisters are playing, advertising ‘
“So,” Harry says, running his thumb over Draco’s. “In that case… we’re friends now, right?”
He imagines what would happen if Potter was watching him do
“It’s all right,” Harry tells him, something unreadable in his expression. “Really. It is.”
Harry nods, feeling queasy. “Do you think you’ve gotten sick?”
He wasn't ready to walk in and see Draco half naked through the transparent wall, kissing another man.
He’s not thinking about Malfoy. He’s not thinking about Malfoy.
After all, Astoria is gone, and what would he even do with himself if not for work?
Draco shook his head, starting to shiver. “No one will listen. I shouldn’t have stayed here, Harry, I shouldn’t…!” He let out a strangled sob. “I haven’t had time to stop being afraid…”
“Okay,” Harry said, leaving off the part where people actually
“People would think me mad,” Malfoy says. “If they saw I had a portrait of you, I mean.”
Harry doesn’t answer for a moment.
As much as he wants to insist on going anyway, Harry concedes that he probably won’t even be able to see Draco for most of that time. “Okay,” he says, his voice cracking. Then he throws his arms around Draco. “Fuck,” he mumbles.
that’s between them. But Malfoy’s already gone. So he follows Malfoy back to the table and sits down in his chair, picking up his glass and downing a good portion of his beer in one gulp.
Was this what burning alive would feel like? Sadness and heat and Draco’s hand around his cock? Because Harry felt like he was on fire, and every touch left a searing trail on his skin. But it was good, so good, and all he could do was let himself burn. “Mmph, Draco—” he gasped at the feeling of warm lips on his neck.
“Potter,” Draco stops him. He opens his mouth, suddenly looking scared. “Do you know why I’m so torn about this?”
Smiling, Potter leans in close, knocking his forehead gently against Draco’s. “So,” he says. “D’you want to go on a date with me sometime?”
. “That’s… fuck,” he breathes.
He’ll probably leave, he thinks. He doesn’t think he can bear to be in the same place as Malfoy, seducing another man.
“Yeah,” he said slowly. “Why?”
Four laughs. Harry finds himself wondering what his
Just like the summer.
Potter sighs. “Sorry,” he says. “For assuming.”
“I—I don’t know,” Malfoy says, giving him a strange look. “I haven’t thought about it. Are you going to keep calling me Malfoy?”
Oh. Merlin. “That can happen?” Harry asks.
“What is it?” Potter asks, looking up from his curry.
Harry’s anger deflates, leaving him cold. He still aches to touch him. “Can I... sit down?”
as much. I might even have to spank you—wouldn’t that be fun? Getting your arse cheeks all red? Maybe I could even fuck you again afterwards, while you’re all sore, and you couldn’t even do anything about it…”
Being mated with Draco.
Then somehow they’re rutting against each other, thoroughly snogging, the sound of their panting filling the room. “Can you... you know—like this?” Harry asks, gasping.
It took not even a day of Draco avoiding him before Harry wanted to scream. Draco wouldn’t even look at him, and he couldn’t bear it; it showed him more than anything that he’d grown to rely on Draco far too much. He craved Draco’s smile like he used to crave pictures of his parents and real, true friends. And when Draco kept averting his gaze, kept turning away, it hurt.
Draco nods, looking at him. “I don’t,” he says. “But—do you?”
Then the blissful feeling finally hits him, the sheer happiness from being around a person he adores so completely, and Harry is sitting across from him, mussed up hair and crooked glasses and all. Merlin. Draco doesn’t know how he’s managed to go so long without doing this again.
Merlin.
Oh. That makes a lot of sense, actually. Harry gives him a look. “I knew you were lying about not knowing what it was.”
“I’m going to miss you so fucking much,” Draco mumbles into his hair.
that. He
He looks down. Draco is holding his hand.
Draco nods slowly, shifting downwards and collapsing onto Harry’s chest. “I don’t deserve you,” he says quietly.
It makes him wonder how Mother felt, forced to follow Father along on his awful quest for power. He wonders if she still loved him up until the end. He used to want to hate her for it, until the day she refused a task from the Dark Lord and—
Harry stares at him indignantly. “What the hell—Malfoy, you’re
Hermione leaves just as a Mediwitch comes in to declare Draco released.
“Does that mean yes?”
“I want you,” he says, and he’s not even fully hard yet but just having Draco’s body against him like this is making him feel warm all over, arousal tingling in his groin.
And the worst part—the part that makes him feel taboo and dirty in the best way—is that Harry
“Honestly? Sometimes,” Malfoy admits. “But I shouldn’t have said some of those things. You’re—” He swallows, hard, and looks as if he wishes he didn’t have to say what he’s currently about to. “You’re the only one here that gives a damn I exist, and I can’t... I can’t piss you off. But I can’t rely on you either, because then you’ll be—you’ll be too important, and when you decide you’ve done your job and helped me learn painting, you’ll leave and...” He clamps his mouth shut. “I’ll stop talking. This is stupid.”
“Fuck!” Draco grits out, and then he’s coming harder than he can ever remember, spilling over Potter’s fingers, his arse spasming frantically around Potter’s cock oh God oh
know. Oh.
“Headmistress… You can’t let them take him!” Harry cried, feeling panicky. “They’ll find some way to throw him in Azkaban, you know they will!”
He supposes it’s not even surprising. This is always how Malfoy has been to him, an unhealthy obsession, a puzzle that he wants desperately to crack, even as he continues to slip out of his grasp.
He’s as directionless as a wizard lost at sea with no wand, and he has absolutely no clue at this point what he wants to do with his life, to the point where the prospect of having to figure it out so quickly threatens to swallow him whole.
He hates this. But of course he’s going to read the letter anyway.
No. Harry’s not going to think about that right now, because every time he thinks about it his face heats, and he does
Harry makes a face and bids him farewell as he disappears from the flames. Then he stares at the paper for another moment before shaking his head and heading to the living room.
He makes himself get up, and then he eats and showers and steadfastly manages to avoid thinking of Potter for nearly half the day. But as evening falls, the loneliness begins to prickle at his back, and soon enough the prickling turns into a stab.
you don’t appreciate me taking the time to help you out, so I’m leaving.”
“But,” Malfoy says, looking at him in a way that makes Harry feel like he’s seeing way too much—“you don’t want to.”
“It’s okay, Potter,” Draco says. He doesn’t look okay. But still, he brings a hand up to stroke Harry’s back. “I believe in Hermione. Don’t you?”
“Don’t ask me,” Seb says with a shrug. “Oh, hey—can you show me how to charm that new light-thingy you came up with? The Muggle one?”
That was sure anti-climactic, Harry concludes as he turns to leave the room, but then he hears Malfoy shifting behind him.

to know that. He wants Draco to change his mind somehow, wants him stay, wants him to call him Harry and kiss him goodnight and hold him through the night while they sleep.
“Hey, it’s all right—you don’t have to say anything, don’t worry,” Potter murmurs then. His fingers are still at Draco’s elbow, and Draco feels like he’s going to cry.
Harry rolls his eyes and mutters, “You know what I mean.”
“Are you all right?” he asks, alarmed.
“What?” Harry spits out. “Is this all because you
He has to remind himself he’s not supposed to care.
“Oh,” Harry says, looking down at the desk. Then he looks at Malfoy again, at how his expression is so, so tired. “Come on,” he says, standing.

The reality of all this is that he feels more connected to Malfoy right now than he has with

—those words imply that this could happen again, that Malfoy maybe
Draco can’t get sick.
The next morning, Harry woke up in Draco’s arms. They were clothed again, though Harry didn’t remember getting dressed, and Draco was looking at him strangely when Harry turned around.
Harry’s heart sinks.
Draco’s
“And anyway, I’ve always wanted to know what you were thinking,” Potter admits quietly. “Even when I did hate you.”
Letting out a long sigh, Draco finally looks at him again, something like worry in his eyes. “I know.”
Even though he’s spent a longer portion of his life than he’d like to admit literally doing just that.
He’s surprised that he’s not angry anymore. Honestly, he’s not feeling much of anything. That’s a good thing, right? That has to be a good thing. He debates drafting a letter to Astoria but decides to leave that for another day, one when he doesn’t feel quite so dead inside.
Harry laughs. “I know,” he says.
“Please,” he says, gasps, “Make it stop hurting.”
“Yes,” Harry gasps, his breathing still wrecked.
to stop using me as a crutch.”
“A relevant one,” Harry quips, grinning. “Well? Did you?”
Sighing, Harry sets down his wand. “Come to insult me again, have you?”
“I know a place,” Malfoy answers.
to—moaning unabashedly, crying out when Malfoy licks a circle around his hole and pushes in again.
Harry’s breath hitches. “Oh—yeah. I’d be okay with that,” he says, and Malfoy smiles and—God.
He wonders if Draco is in love with him. He thinks of the way Draco said ‘
Draco’s face crumples. “Stay,” he says, “Please.”
“Oh,” Draco says, because Merlin, he’d nearly forgotten. He all but erased it from his memory, the long nights spent both studying and chattering—the fact that back then, he and Potter were almost friends.
Malfoy wrinkles his nose. “I hate the Floo,” he says, though he pockets the slip of paper anyway.
He sort of wishes Malfoy were taking his clothes off too—then he forbids himself from wishing that, because the thought of Malfoy naked and vulnerable in front of him fills him with too much longing to bear.
, Harry thinks, the words pulsing warm in his chest, and then—‘
Peace, though uneasy after the war, had settled snugly around the Wizarding world. Of course the Ministry would want to hold an enormous, ridiculously unnecessary event on the anniversary of the final battle to show everyone just how “good” life was. The triviality left an acrid taste in Harry’s mouth. He didn’t approve of it, especially when the event was outwardly all about him. But then, no one ever really listened to Harry (except concerning stupid acronyms, apparently).
Draco looks at him, shaking his head. “You’re an absolute idiot, you know,” he says, but then slowly, his lips spread into a sharp grin. “But kinky. I like it.”
“Interesting. I was certain that you were making use of some loophole in the law or other,” Malfoy says. He’s leaned in closer as Harry’s been talking, and Harry can’t quite tell if he’s doing it on purpose.
Draco’s kisses grew more urgent, his tongue swiping into Harry’s mouth as if he couldn’t get enough of the taste. And Harry understood. God, Draco...
Ginny’s eyebrows shot to the ceiling. She sank into the chair next to him, resting her chin on her hands. “Wow, really! Good for you, Harry.”
He puzzles over it as Harry bustles about making tea, smiling at him, asking him, “Want a cuppa?”
want it. And I wouldn’t know.”
“You fucking
“Are you really?” Ron asks bitterly, then lets him go, walking away.
“Don’t come any closer,” Draco says, and Harry can’t even begin to fathom why—maybe Draco is repulsed by him now, so much that he can’t even be in Harry’s presence. God.
That he doesn’t need him anymore—for anything?
Potter leans over Draco and carefully ties his wrists to the headboard. “That okay?” Potter says, and Draco tests it—he worried that Potter was being too gentle, but it’s tight enough that his hands can’t slip out. The silk feels luxurious on his skin as he twists his wrists into a more comfortable position, and he gives a hard tug—yes, fuck. That’s good.
“Me, er. Taking my clothes off.”
“I’m fine,” Potter says again, and then he smiles. “I promise.”
Slowly, and more quietly than normal, the Hat ends its piece.
