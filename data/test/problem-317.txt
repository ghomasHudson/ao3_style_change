“Yeah,” Harry responded ineloquently, his thoughts jumbled. “S’pose so…”

“I believe they only have two houses,” Javier answered, twisting around in his seat to look across at the Durmstrang students who were sat at the Slytherin table. “North and South.”
Ron had been Harry's first ever friend, ever since they'd sat together on their way to Hogwarts for their first year. His friend had welcomed him into his wonderful wacky family without a second thought, even going so far as to break him out of his bedroom after his muggle relatives had locked him up during the summer between his first and second years, using his dad's flying car to do so and had become something akin to a brother to Harry.
It made a sickening amount of sense that, if someone had indeed entered Harry Potters name into the

Lestrange, seeing as how everyone knows that she was sleeping with both of them...”
“Whilst other members of my family believed that the Dark Lord was merely in hiding my parents chose to believe the theory that the curse had backfired somehow,” he explained, his eyes following the strings of fairy lights hanging around the room as he spoke, the lights dimmed in response to the late hour thanks to the spell Ramona had cast on them when she’d put them up. “They believed it so strongly that they were willing to risk their lives in order to keep me safe, to give me a chance at a normal life away from the darkness that had tainted our family. Honestly, I dread to think what I would’ve turned out like if they hadn’t.”
Draco grimaced as the twins linked their arms together, smiling broadly at each other as they uncorked their vials in preparation of drinking the worryingly unstable contents.
“You should’ve told us you’d entered!” Fred, the owner of the too tight grip bellowed as he pulled Harry around to stand between him and his twin. Both of them looked half annoyed, half impressed as George demanded, “How did you do it without getting a beard? Brilliant!”
“I am over twat-face,” Draco sighed deeply. “But that doesn't mean you can set me up with whoever you think would be good for me. If I find someone I want to date
Thierry announced from inside the cubicle, an unpleasant sound accompanying his voice.
Yanking his pillow out from underneath his head Draco twisted and brought it down on his friends head, causing him to cry out in alarm as the assault continued with blows of the soft pillow landing all over his squirming body. Ramona’s laughter reached an almost hysterical level, tears flooding down her cheeks as her brother finally stirred, letting out a tired groan,
“Claude wake you up too?”
The ex-Auror didn’t seem all that worried to be faced with the irate Head of Gryffindor who Harry genuinely suspected even Death Eaters would be afraid of as he responded calmly,
All four house tables had filled up by the time the magical sky above them began to light up with beautiful streaks of lightening, mirroring the sky outside, and get there was still no sign of the first years. This was unusual but given the weather also completely understandable.
“Please arrange yourselves by order of position,” Madame Maxime ordered, gesturing towards the giant double doors to their right. “Mademoiselles Poulin and Morel shall lead.”
“So,” Dumbledore announced as he rose to his feet, waving a single hand to clear away the empty plates and bowls from the various tables. “Now that you are all fed and watered I must once more ask for your attention while I give out a few notices. Mr Filch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you that the list of objects forbidden inside the castle this…”
Claude tutted in disapproval.
Harry took comfort in the fact that Ron seemed equally as surprised by this knowledge, reassuring him that it wasn't just his muggle upbringing keeping him in the dark this time. Ron was a pureblood, like Fleur only nicer, so it was obviously just a case of Hermione spending far too much time in the library, yet again, rather than him not being told things.
He kept his thoughts to himself, however.
student who had caught his attention rose gracefully from his seat, smoothed out his uniform and swept up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables. His sharply defined features gave nothing away in regards to his feelings about being chosen, unlike Krum who’s joy had been clearly evident. Draco Malfoy was all about refined composure. “It’s him...”
“Ready, George?”

Unlike her sister Fleur didn’t look even the slightest bit innocent, not with her cold grey eyes and her pursed lips which were painted a rather vivid red colour. She was alternating between making goo-goo eyes at Viktor Krum and glaring at one of the boys sat at one of the middle two tables, a boy who was blatantly ignoring her as he laughed with his friends.
if their brother hadn’t made the move with them?”
Aided by magic the doors before them swung open smoothly, revealing a large hall with a magical ceiling which appeared to be enchanted to look like the sky above. The room was lit be a sea of candles floating underneath the enchanted ceiling as well as torches placed in strategic places around the walls. Dominating the room were the five tables; four long ones where the students of

No, this couldn’t be a student prank, he reasoned with himself as he fought to hold back his tears. Even for a Slytherin this was too much, too dangerous. Professor Moody was right.
Draco's parents had never tried to hide their “past affiliations and indiscretions” from him, always willing to answer his questions openly and honestly from a young age although it had only been in the last few years that they had been willing to share absolutely everything with him. He understood shy they'd held a few things back; no young child should have to know that their parents had been forced to torture others or risk being tortured themselves, shouldn't have to learn of the “plan” which had been laid down for their life which had included joining the Dark Lords followers as a loyal puppet, shouldn't have to learn how twisted and evil their grandparents, their aunts and uncles, even their cousins truly were.
“Lots of homework?” Hermione enquired, almost smugly, as she appeared out of nowhere, joining them on their way down to the Great Hall. She was clutching her books in such a way that it was a miracle she didn’t drop all of them. “Professor Vector didn’t give

Ron cleared his through, nodding towards the rest of the class who Harry now realised were completely focused on him. Despite the fact that this was an altogether too familiar experience it didn’t make it any less uncomfortable for the teenage wizard who sat up straighter in his chair, rubbing at the back of his neck with his hand as Trelawney spoke up.
The Hogwarts Headmaster took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it, extinguishing all of the candles except those inside the carved pumpkins and plunging the Great Hall into a state of semi-darkness. The Goblet of Fire now shone more brightly than anything in the entire room, the bright, bluey-whiteness of the flames painful of the eyes.
“How come Draco gets fairy lights and I don't?” Claude pouted from where he was stretched out on the ridiculously soft rug in front of the roaring fireplace. He'd stripped down to just his undershirt and uniform trousers, kicking off his shoes, and was meant to be working on his History of Magic essay but had been doodling for nearly an hour already so obviously it wasn't going well. “Ramona? Am I not your favourite anymore? Am I so easily replaced?”
“A heinous crime, of course,” Javier muttered fondly before taking a bite of his sandwich and gagging, his face twisting into an expression of utter disgust. “What

It all stemmed from the fact that both Yvette and Odette had had designs on Draco at one point or another and had seen his close friendship with Ramona as an obstacle to be overcome, neither of them willing to accept the fact that he was completely gay. They had made it very clear that they believed the

, Harry grumbled to himself,
“Saturn, dear, the planet Saturn!” Professor Trelawney grumbled, visibly annoyed with the fact that he wasn’t gazing up at her with wide eyes like most of the class appeared to be. Either they were easily amused or there was something mind-altering in the incense the older woman was burning around her favourite chair. Or perhaps it was a little bit of both. “I was saying that Saturn was surely in a position of power in the heavens at the moment of your birth…your dark hair…your mean stature…tragic losses so young in life…”
Whatever he had been about to say was interrupted by the enchanted sky above their heads going completely an utterly mental, thunder crashing, lightning flashing and real rain pouring down on top of the students who reacted loudly in fearful surprise, covering their heads even as a magical spell was shot up into the ceiling from the corner of the large room.

and now it was simply a matter of waiting to see whose name would eventually be selected. Madame Maxime seemed to be exceptionally pleased with their performance, offering Igor Karkaroff a smug smile. The Headmaster of
Harry’s mouth dropped out in shock as the ferret was unceremoniously deposited down the front of Vincent Crabbe’s trousers, the creature struggling to grip onto the boy’s belt in an attempt to stop itself vanishing from sight. It was no good and into the piece of clothing it went, followed quickly by Gregory Goyle’s hand as the taller boy attempted to rescue Fleur.
Harry had decided sometime during his First Year that he both loved and hated the Owlery.
“You heard correctly,” Severus confirmed, shrinking his supplies and slipped them into one of his pockets. “But one day he will be old enough to attend Hogwarts where I will be able to look out for him. I need to cement my position as a member of the faculty until then.”
I own nothing, I’m merely borrowing for the duration of this story.
Triwizard Champion in this years competition; Harry Potter!”
It appeared that word of their decision to enter their names that evening had reached almost every student currently residing within the castle walls as from the moment they stepped out of the carriage to the time that the doors of the
Engorgio!
No one but Professor Dumbledore who, after a long pause during which he did nothing but stare at the parchment in his hands, looked up at the students, cleared his throat and read,
“Ready?”
“Keep your fat mouth shut, then.”
Her husband’s image and that of her precious son received the same brutal treatment.
“Oh, that’s right, you were staying with them this summer, weren’t you?” Fleur sneered, tossing her picture perfect platinum blonde hair over her shoulder. Out of the corner of his eye Harry caught sight of Hermione fussing with her own less than perfect hair, attempting to get it to lie flat. “Tell me, is his mother really that porky, or is it just the picture?”
. Apparently the revolting pus was the main ingredient used for treating severe acne which was, you know, good to know. The work was more than a little bit disgusting but also inexplicably satisfying.
“There!” Ramona announced triumphantly, standing with her hands on her shapely hips as she surveyed the room. Unlike most of the girls in their year who were determined not to put on an ounce of weight if they could help it his friend had accepted the fact that her body wanted her to be “cuddly” like her mother was. She wasn't fat by any means, there was just more meat on her bones than the others girls they knew. “Done! Although if we all enter the Triwizard Tournament like Madame wants us to I shall have to take it all down in a couple of weeks and transfer it to whatever accommodation we end up in for the duration.”
“I can see you as a Champion,” an unfamiliar voice announced suddenly, startling Draco enough that he jumped as he turned around to face the owner of the voice. He was genuinely surprised when he came face to face with none other than his cousin, Fleur, the young witch flanked by a couple of goons with a couple of less than attractive young witches hovering in the background. Ramona, having realised what was going on, smacked Claude on the shoulder until he turned, bringing Javier with him, and the three of them moved to flank Draco just in case he should need their assistance dealing with his cousin. “Should you be selected I would be delighted to attend the Yule Ball with you, were you to ask me.”
His boyfriend chuckled, leaning over to rest his head on the Frenchman’s shoulder,
“I'm…I'm fine…just…” Neville mumbled, bringing a shaking hand up to rub at his eyes. “I just didn't sleep very well, that's all. I couldn't…I couldn't stop thinking about my…my parents…”
“Bottoms up.”
“I am glad to find you all here,” Madame Maxime addressed her gathered students in her own native tongue, moving to stand directly behind Draco so that she could place her large hands on his shoulders. “I hope that you will all give Draco your full support and any help that he may or may not require as he represents our school in the
He looked tired; his skin even paler than usual, his eyes circled by a ring of darkness whilst his thick, inky black hair hung limply around his face. It was so desperately in need of a wash that she considered pinning him down and scrubbing his hair clean like she sometimes had to do with Draco who had never been a fan of bath time, not even when he’d been a baby.
“What are you talking about?”
even if he did appear to have no sense of fashion or style whatsoever given that, as well as the birds nest on top of his head, his clothes were in desperate need of tidying up. It might be the end of the day but that did not mean that you should go around in such a scruffy state, or so Draco thought; you shoulder either wear your school uniform with pride or change into your own clothes.
“You'll see,” Charlie responded, his cheerful manner doing absolutely nothing to ease the worry building in Harry's chest at the ominous words. “Just don't tell Percy I mentioned it…it's ‘
Another hush fell over the crowd as they dropped the scraps of paper into the blue flames.
“Half of my friends are too in awe of me to sit with me,” Harry responded bitterly, nodding towards the ones who were gazing at him as though he were Merlin himself. “Whilst the other half hate me for cheating or for finding out a way to enter myself and not sharing it.”
Silence fell upon the crowd as, with a wave of his wand, the unsteady Professor sent the ferret flying up into the air, high above their heads before allowing it to fall freely towards the ground, only catching it at the last possible moment. Next the ferret was sent flying from side to side in the space available, over and over until the Professor tired of this.
party round be chosen to compete. Some, however, wore expressions of idle curiosity and he guessed that these were the students that weren't going to enter.
“I’m not stupid, Harry…”
“I fell down some stairs, my little dragon,” she reassured him softly, twisting the truth into a lie which wouldn’t upset him. “Mummy wasn’t looking where she was going and fell out of one of her shoes. That’ll teach me to wear impractical shoes whilst out walking, won’t it?”
Madame Maxime was perched on one of the chairs looking surprisingly elegant considering the fact that she was a half-giantess and therefore towered over everyone. Beside her Lara, the Head Girl, looked positively elfin as she sat on her own chair, her petite frame and delicate features making her looked significantly younger than her seventeen years.
“I'm sorry, but...you have no idea who I am, do you?”
Harry did.
“Ok. Well…see you, then.”
, wore a lilac coloured pin shaped like a butterfly in flight with the detail marked out in a beautiful rose gold while Javier had always been proud of his midnight blue pin, perfectly circular in shape and decorated with delicate silvers stars and a crescent shaped moon to symbolise his house,
Harry wasn’t the only one fighting to hide a burst of uncontrollable laughter as Professor McGonagall returned Fleur DeLacour to her rightful state with a flick of her wand and a muttered incantation, the dishevelled girl appearing in an ungainly heap on the floor with her skirt up around her waist revealing her inappropriately skimpy knickers for all to see.
All but tumbling into the fourth year boys dormitory Harry spun around to shut the door behind him as quickly as possible, pressing his back against it when he was done. It was only then as he leant back against the unrelenting wood that he noticed Ron lying on top of his bedcovers, fully dressed but for his shoes which had obviously been carelessly kicked off.
“The Champion for Beauxbatons is Draco Malfoy!”
A house elf appeared at the foot of the staircase directly in front of her.
“Well, the Goblet is almost ready to make its decision,” Professor Dumbledore announced after taking a moment to assess the blue flame flickering within the Goblet. Beside him Madame Maxime smiled, nodding in agreement, and Headmaster Karkaroff fixed his cold gaze upon his students waiting in silence. “I estimate that it requires one more minute.”
“Harry, guess what?” Colin gasped loudly, practically vibrating in his seat as he was overcome with excitement. Hermione offered him an indulgent smile, her fondness for the overexcitable founder of Harry's fan club well known. Ron merely grumbled about being cold and hungry. “Guess what, Harry? My brothers starting! My brother Dennis!”
His friends suggestion received a great deal of laughter from everyone but Lavender who huffed loudly, her cheeks flaming brightly with embarrassment, and Professor Trelawney who proceeded to set them in incomparable amount of homework for the first day of term.
“Draco! Don’t forget you almost forgot

had finished.
“There he is!”
“Yes,” she confirmed cheerfully. “My work here is done. My masterpiece is complete.”
“Um…no?”
“If it had to be anyone I’m glad it’s you, Draco,” Ramona, the owner of the squeal, gushed once they had calmed down enough to release him although she herself tucked her arm through his as the group of friends instinctively moved to follow their Headmistress. He smiled tightly at her, not entirely pleased with being chosen yet. “I mean, of course we all wanted to be chosen ourselves but as that wasn’t to be I’m glad it’s you. We all are, right?”
Gulping down the potion, identical grimaces flashing briefly on their faces, the twins wasted no time in jumping down from the bench, landing on the floor inside the glowing blue circle.
“Extraordinary!” he muttered, squeezing Harry’s arm almost tight enough to be considered painful in his obvious excitement. “Truly! Gentlemen, may I introduce to you, incredible though it may seem, the
“But I thought there were only supposed to be
“The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in October and will be remaining with us for the greater part of this year,” Dumbledore continued calmly as though he hadn't just dashed so many students dreams of glory and riches. Some were visibly upset although most still looked angry. “I know that you will extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us and will give you’re whole-hearted supported to the Hogwarts champion when he or she is selected. And now, it is late, and I know how important it is for you all to be alert and rest as you enter your lessons tomorrow. Bedtime! Chop chop!”
’ thing and it was just as disconcerting from them as it was from the two redheads who had jumped up to stand on the bench, shaking the potion vials so vigorously that Draco feared for the potion held within them.
“We’ll be expecting you around for Sunday lunch next week, Severus,” she informed him firmly, stepping forwards in order to press a kiss to his cheek. “12 o’clock. Don’t be late.”
Madame Maxime’s voice echoed throughout the interior of the carriage, interrupting many a contented doze or pleasant conversation. It had already been explained that they were to speak English as much as possible for the duration of their stay and so it was no surprise to hear her heavily accented voice using the language of their hosts and Draco's native tongue.
“Quick! How do I look?”

interested in Draco before she’d finally gone too far and been arrested. Apolline had been almost as bad before she married and had a child of her own, a daughter she’d named Fleur after her husband’s grandmother. “I had no idea she would react as violently as she did but I’ll be all right. I’ll be better once we’ve settled into our new home and can begin our new lives together.”
“I don’t know.”
“Great,” Harry muttered. “Just what I need; more publicity.”
“Imagining things, am I? Seeing things, eh?” Moody growled, shifting his stance so that his artificial leg thudded loudly on the stone slab beneath their feet, the noise causing most of them to flinch. “It was a skilled witch or wizard who put the boy’s name in that
“Harry Potter.”
Draco hummed softly in agreement.
“I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students,” Karkaroff all but sneered, his hands clenching and unclenching at his sides. In that moment Harry was reminded of a character from a cartoon Dudley had watched once, Harry catching parts of it as he’d completed his chores; when he was angry the
Both of his companions laughed, loading up their plates from the variety of foods laid out on the table in front of them. They were from Beauxbatons, judging by their blue uniforms, and he recognised them as being friends of the Draco Malfoy, their schools champion; thankfully there was no sign of the handsome blond who’d featured far too often in his dreams lately.
“Madame Maxime!” Draco called out as soon as he saw them, moving across to stand beside his giant of a headmistress. “They can’t really let a

“I don't know,” Harry responded as Moody visibly shuddered after swallowing, his artificial eye spinning, dropping the flask into his jacket pocket. “But I don't think its pumpkin juice.”
“Now, when the Champions names are called, I would ask them please to come up to the top of the Hall, walk along the staff table, and go through into the next chamber,” Professor Dumbledore continued, indicating the door behind the staff table. It swung open of its own accord, revealing a candlelit passage. “Where they will be receiving their first instructions.”
Narcissa hadn’t been able to attend the wedding but she had managed to visit a couple of months after the baby’s birth without the rest of her family finding out. Nymphadora had been the most adorable thing she had ever seen, wriggling in her multi-coloured blankets, gurgling almost constantly and snuggling against her chest as she held the young infant.
How could anyone think that this was something he had done to himself?
His mother had always helped out in the shop when needed, even more so now that Lucius was in charge of brewing the various potions and ointments and couldn't therefore man the counter all of the time, but she had also managed to add to their regular income by creating illustrations for a magical children’s magazine, sketching and painting little scenes when they were needed and had even turned her hand to creating humorous cartoons just recently.
Madame Maxime scoffed loudly,

Draco’s attention was drawn to the double doors when they once again opened, this time smoothly and silently, to admit an old man struggling to carry a large casket, obviously many years old and made of  a combination of metal and wood. The fact that he wasn’t using magic to move the obviously heavy casket suggested that the man was probably a squib.

“My mother will hear about this!”
“Ah,” Javier sighed, resigned. “Come here, love.”
He could probably have handled everything if one of his best friends hadn’t turned on him.
“You’re doing the right thing,” Severus murmured from where he was packing up his potion-making supplies. “You’re giving Draco the chances in life he deserves, not to mention you and Lucius. This world is not kind to those of us who were forced to follow the Dark Lord.”
That would have been bad enough but the four friends had then retired to his room for their own celebration, a celebration which had eventually become a planning meeting about how his friends were going to help him throughout the

Krum straightened up from his previously hunched position, making his impressive height even more obvious as he blatantly looked Harry up and down, judging him, before smirking and looking away. Cedric looked back and forth between Bagman and Harry, his expression making it clear that he’d assumed that he had misheard something. And Draco looked, if only briefly, truly worried. This expression was quickly covered up with a charming smile.

And most importantly as the figure in his mind shrank from 6’1 to 5’7 at the most the baby blue eyes which had always sparkled with self-assuredness transformed into a mesmerising pair of emerald green orbs concealed behind thin panes of glass surrounded by a wire rim.
– Please be aware that in some places I will be utilising some of the original material, although it has all been adapted and altered to fit with my changes to the overall storyline. None of it is literally copy/pasted as I consider that to be cheating (and borderline plagiarism which is not acceptable in my book.) As the story progresses this will happen less and less but in this first chapter, particularly in the very first section where the “scene is being set”, I struggled not to include some aspects. Just wanted to warn you.

But then, as his pleasure began to peak, the image his mind was supplying for him changed.
“What? It’s not like you could do any better…”
Eventually Dumbledore climbed to his feet, effortlessly silencing the entire room as he offered the gathered students a smile and spread his arms wide, his palms facing up.
“Oh, I don’t know. Perhaps they want to kill me?”
“And don't worry mate, well keep this between us until you want to tell everyone,” Ron murmured reassuringly as they reached the classroom, groaning when he saw what was written upon the chalkboard in cursive writing. “Ugh. Not the

look,” Claude responded with a cheeky grin, leaving the buttons of his jacket undone in favour of running his fingers through his wild hair. Rather than taming it as the action could have done his careless movements only made it worse, one side of his hair sticking up and out whilst the other lay almost flat. “What do you think?”
“Ombre Lune,” Javier explained without any verbal prompting. “And if my sister and Draco were here you would notice that they belong to the same house; Bellefeuille. A green leaf.”
The familiar sharp voice of Professor McGonagall rang out over the noise of the entrance hall, silencing the titters and the giggles as she advanced on the spectacle taking place.
It was Cedric who led the way back up into the now deserted

Another sigh, this one of defeated frustration, escaped Harry as allowed his head to fall back, leaving him gazing up at the intricate moulding of the ceiling high above them for a long moment before he closed his eyes, took a deep breath and returned to facing them.
All three of them had vastly different reactions.
“It is also my painful duty to inform you that the inter-house Quidditch Cup will not take place this year,” Dumbledore’s apologetic voice dragged his thoughts back to the address being given, prompting him to react loudly along with his fellow pupils. No Quidditch? That…that was unimaginable… “This is due to an event that will be starting in October, and continuing throughout the school year, taking up much of the teachers’ time and energy.”
It would’ve been bearable if Ron and Hermione had been at his side but they were nowhere to be seen. Did than mean they believed him? That they disapproved of the celebration? Or did it mean that they were so disgusted with his supposed actions that they could face him?

Both men received a polite smattering of applause from the occupants of the large room.
“So…going to enter, Weasley? Going to try and bring a bit of glory to the family name?” she'd giggled derisively from the door which had been left open since their friends had joined them. Her stance had been exactly how Harry had pictured it in his mind. “There's money involved as well, you know…you'd be able to afford some decent robes if you won…”
good Quidditch team to boot.
Several of the paintings on the wall nearest to him gasped fearfully, disappearing from their frames, whilst others called out to demand he silence himself. Harry sighed sadly, wiping his eyes briskly before pushing himself up to his feet so that he could begin his journey back to the tower. It seemed that even the paintings were afraid of hearing his name spoken aloud.
Javier and Fabian had been a “thing” before Javier and Claude has become a “thing” and so tensions continued to be a little bit strained between the hot-heated Frenchman and the handsome Dutchman despite the fact that said Dutchman was now dating Jacques Jordan.
“I thought he had been sent to live with his relatives,” Lucius pointed out as he helped his wife to her feet, pressing a kiss to the corner of her mouth. He then carefully shrunk his armchair, the last piece of furniture in the large room. “Muggles, or so I had heard.”
for you?”
“And there’s a picture, Weasley!”
It was reassuring that nothing out of the ordinary happened for the remainder of the journey, unlike last year when the Dementors had attacked, and that the most exciting moment had been when Seamus, Dean and Neville had tumbled into their compartment sparking a rather heated debate about the match between Ireland and Bulgaria. Neville hadn't been able to convince his grandmother to get them tickets so he was more than eager to listen to every single detail as told by the people who had actually been there.
Stepping into the sitting room she was unsurprised to find her parents sat on opposite sides of the room, her father sitting at the writing desk going through official looking papers while her mother reclined on the sofa in front of a roaring fire. Druella Black, nee Rosier, did not look her forty-nine years thanks to the potions and charms she used daily in order to maintain her appearance which had led to her being confused with her eldest daughters, Bellatrix and the twins, Andromeda and Apolline. Unlike her sisters Narcissa took after their father, at least in looks, and had had a lifetime of unkind comments about her blonde hair.
A stunned silence fell, broken only by Fleur’s sharp intake of breath before she hissed,
Why would he?
“…did I really look that pitiful sitting by myself?”
“Because I admire him as an athlete,” Ron protested firmly, his entire face, neck and ears flushing an alarming shade of puce. “Not because I think he's hot or…something…I'm not...”
Ron’s muttered comment caused him to pause partway through pulling off his left shoe.
It took him a moment to get over his genuine shock but when he didn't he could help but scoff loudly, drawing the attention of everyone in their vicinity as he enquired coldly,
“I see you’re having the same problem as me.”
His studious friend sounded so distraught over the idea of missing out on one of her precious classes that Harry couldn't help but snort, his eyes moving slowly along the varied faces of the faculty members. Most looked anxious, worrying for the new students travelling across the lake, but Snape as per usual wore a mask of indifference tinged with annoyance.
nor were there locations given, their need for privacy overruling the prospect of new students.
And yet, no matter how many times he said it, no one believed him.
A first year Gryffindor piped up, saying exactly what everyone was thinking,
, Harry snapped set himself silently as his cheeks flushed so deeply that they dynasties red and went straight to purple. Mercifully no one seemed to have noticed, either where he had accidentally been staring or his reaction, everyone too engrossed in making their own reactions and opinions regarding the selection plain to hear. Even Ron, sat beside him, didn’t notice although that was more likely due to the fact that he was sneaking sweet out a bag he’d hidden in the pocket of his robe. “Some of them seem to be taking it rather…badly…although I suppose it’s understandable that they’re a little bit disappointed.”
“The Champion for Durmstrang,” he read, in a strong, clear voice. “Will be Viktor Krum.”
“Don’t bring me into it, Cissa,” Lucius chuckled sadly as he placed another shrunken piece of furniture into the suitcase. “I’ve been trying to convince him to come with us for weeks.”
“You'll find out this evening, I expect,” was Mrs Weasley's ever so calm response, her smile never faltering. “It's going to be very exciting – mind you, I'm glad they've change the rules.”
Harry let out a deep sigh.

…did this make him…you know?
It was only then that Harry noticed that the other boy’s nails were painted the same purple as his house colour, the perfect layers of gloss catching in the light from the magical ceiling.
She had little time to cry out in shock, pressing a hand to the shockingly painful injury, before her mother grabbed her by her hair and dragged her out into the hallway. With her body bent double, her mother pulling her head downwards as she walked, it was almost impossible for her to navigate the stairs down to the ground floor without tripping and crashed into the wooden bannister more than once. Her father followed a little way behind.
Draco offered her his most cultured smirk.
“I think it looks like you just got out of bed,” Draco responded, earning a glare from his friend even as the twins snorted loudly. “And Madame Maxime will never let you leave this carriage looking like that, or did you forget her lecture about representing our school?”
“You’ll come and have a drink before you go, at least?”
“Yeah, Draco and Fleur are definitely cousins,” Ron explained around his mouthful of food. Hermione grimaced. “Their mums are sisters, I think, and the Malfoy’s were linked to the Dark Lord and his followers during the war, just like the DeLacour’s were…are. Although the Malfoy’s fled the country in the immediate aftermath, supposedly to escape prosecution.”
It seemed, if only for a brief moment, that their potion might have done the trick and their celebrations resumed. Draco was unsurprised, however, when the atmosphere changed.
“Come on, Draco,” Lara murmured, pulling on his arm. “Time to take our seats.”
Harry had no choice but to swing his bag over his shoulder and, after shooting Hermione a wince, follow Colin out of the classroom and into the deserted corridor. Once the door had shut behind them, separating them from the sea of
Not yet, anyway, not until he’d had time to really process what he feeling.
“Bloody hell…” Ron grumbled, shaking the water off of his hands after Professor McGonagall had arrived at the scene of the crime, her threat to fetch the Headmaster enough to send the poltergeist on his way but not before bed dropped the last of his water bombs on a group of second years who had just hurried in through the doors. “I hope he got Fleur…”
“My dears, it is time for us to consider the stars,” she announced grandly, sweeping her hands up towards the ceiling which was decorated with images of the constellations. Lavender let out a sharp gasp of excitement. “The movements of the planets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who understand the steps of the celestial dance. Human destiny may be deciphered by the planetary rays, which intermingle…”

Why did this kind of thing always happen to him?
The fact that Ron was also refusing to speak to him only made the lesson more unbearable.
Dumbledore’s unusually serious voice drew his attention away from the empty doorway through which the
Drawing herself up to her full height the foreign Headmistress turned to face Dumbledore.
“Indeed.”
And didn’t that cause all of their hearts to clench, that Draco was old enough for one of his fears to be of people wearing masks. This no doubt stemmed from the times he’d accidently witness his father returning from performing tasks for the Dark Lord wearing his distractive and purposefully frightening Death Eater mask. It had scared Narcissa the first time she’d seen it so no doubt it had scared their son, the metallic skull lingering in his young mind.
“I think I've heard of it,” Ron mumbled from where he had already opened up his sandwiches and stuffed half of one in his mouth. “Ugh. Plum. Where is it? What country?”
and everything he’d been through. Draco could remember being confused to find his parents in his room and why they sounded so sad, wondering in his innocence who it was they were talking about, and he could remember asking them what was wrong. The conversation that followed was a complete blank in his memory, however, as were those of the day that followed when the world had celebrated the disappearance of the Dark Lord.
“But, Professor Karkaroff, it doesn’t work like that,” Mr Bagman attempted to laugh it off. “The

A moment of silence passed between them before they began to giggle uncontrollably, their bodies shaking more and more as their giggling rapidly transformed into full blown laughter.
In spite of everything else going on learning about the other school was surprisingly interesting as up until this year Harry hadn’t realised that there were other schools of witchcraft and wizardry scattered around the world. It had been terribly naïve of him, he realised now, to assume that everyone studied at Hogwarts but he wasn’t alone; almost every single Muggleborn had been unaware of the existence of the other schools as well.
“Blimey!” he heard one boy mutter clearly as he passed by him. “That’s one

Washing himself off as quickly as possible, a habit born from the fact that his Aunt Petunia timed how much hot water he used up which he still couldn't break even though he knew Hogwarts could never run out of hot water due to the fact that it was all done by magic, he used one of the fluffy towels provided to dry himself off, pulled on his pyjamas and returned to his dormitory to get himself ready for the day. Despite the fact that it was nearly an hour before his usual wake-up time he knew better than to try and go back to sleep, knowing that he'd slip into a deep enough sleep that he would then oversleep and miss out on breakfast.
“Josephine Villeneuve,” Ramona answered, struggling with the French pronunciations a little bit given her naturally thick Spanish accent even when speaking English as was a requirement of the school. Every day the school spoke in a different language, supposedly to teach the students how to survive in a “multi-cultural magical world” despite the fact that translation spells were covered in their third year. “Which isn't so bad, all things considered. She doesn't mind what I do with my side of the room so long as it doesn't interfere with her filing system. I'm hoping to convince her to let me brighten her side up a bit, though…”
Laughter surrounded him, other Slytherin’s calling out their own suggestions for how long it would take for him to get himself killed, and it was only Hagrid’s arrival that silenced them.

As ever her elaborate robes included a high collar, this one made of fur, which framed her head like she was an Elizabethan Queen. “If you would lower ze steps for us…”

“That’s the rumour,” Cedric Diggory responded softly to his mumbled query. “But my dad says that most of the rumours about Professor Moody come from people he’s arrested.”
“Any suggestions?”
“Don't talk with your mouth full,” Hermione scolded him automatically, grimacing at the unpleasantly familiar sight before her. “And nobody knows where the school is, obviously.”
Javier held on to his annoyance for a barely a moment before tilting his head to allow Claude better access to his neck and thus demonstrating his forgiveness. Rolling her eyes towards her brother Ramona missed the moment when, as he turned to leave the Great Hall, Viktor Krum paused to shoot the smallest of smiles towards the startled Miss Granger.
together,” Ramona chuckled, stepping back so as to allow her brother and his boyfriend to slip out of the room whilst also assessing the drape she'd just hung. Eventually she nodded, happy with its placement. “I was already sharing with Josephine so that's no problem. She's even let me change the colour of the drapes around her bed to a beautiful jade green which matches those ribbons she always wears in her hair. Unfortunately I'm now also sharing a room with Skye Dreyer who has already taken over the entire dressing table with her hair products and make-up necessities, not to mention covered almost the entire floor with more pairs of shoes than I thought possible. Desiree Morel, our resident
This time it was a rumble of outrage which spread like wildfire throughout the students.
“Thank you!” the first twin cried out in response to the crowd who had responding to their cheering with cries of their own, moving out of the way so that they could move to the centre of the group. “Thank you. Well lads, we've done it. Brewed it up this morning.”
“Weasley! Hey, Weasley!”
Draco was surprised by how quickly most of the students jumped to their feet.
“Dumbledore!”
Madame Maxime's voice echoed through the carriage once more just as Draco had finished fussing with the angle of his beret, grumbling the whole time as he struggled to make it look alright.
Wisely the young man in question chose not to argue with her.
“And you don’t have to do end-of-year tests, either…”
It was a struggle for Draco not to start chuckling at his friends “misfortunes” but he managed to control himself, focusing instead of unpacking his various textbooks and organising them in alphabetical order on one of the shelves above his small study area.
“Oh, it was my pleasure, dears,” said Mrs Weasley. “I'd invite you for Christmas, but…well, I expect you're all going to want to stay at Hogwarts, what with…one thing and another.”
“You might want to fix your hair first…”
said!”
“What she said,” Claude grunted in agreement, reaching out to rest his hand on Draco's chest beside Ramona’s hand. “Although technically Hogwarts is in Scotland, not England.”
Draco and the others followed at a more sedate pace; heads held high, shoulders back and polite smiles on their faces. Nothing too big or showy, such a display would be considered
Harry felt himself sag with relief at the site of his friend,
To say that Draco had taken it badly was a bit of an understatement.
“I didn’t put my name in,” Harry found himself mumbling, glancing back and forth between Ron and Hermione as he begged them to believe him. He felt numb. His fellow Gryffindor’s looked so betrayed, particularly Ron. “You know I didn’t. I couldn’t have…I

Arriving at the front of the hall Odette and Desiree performed a synchronised series of pirouettes, magical butterfly’s fluttering out from the ruffles of their tutus, before ending in an elegant pose amidst the polite applause coming from the sea of students and teachers.
“So,” Cedric hummed as they exited the Hall. “We’re playing against each other again.”
, the subject he found both painful and pointless and therefore hated that it was one of the double lessons he'd been assigned this year. Honestly, an hour and a half of Professor Trelawney was bad enough but three hours was definitely going to drive him completely and utterly insane.
Ramona met and held his gaze.
“Yes?”

The males, it turned out, were the ones with the deadly looking stingers whilst the females had been gifted with ominous looking suckers and both had a nasty habit of shooting sparks out of the tips of their tails every now and then, propelling them forwards a few inches whilst burning whatever was in the vicinity. This, unfortunately, included Dean’s hand.
Thankfully Hermione had been able to fix the damage with a quick flick of her wand.
“And no one believes you?”
“I thought we agreed that we wouldn’t think of him in that way anymore,” Draco grumbled at the offending part of his body which only caused it to pulse wildly. “Ugh. Fine. Last time.
“I have only two words to say to you –
“Now, as I was saying we are to have the honour of hosting a very exciting event over the course of the coming months, an event which has not been held for over a century,” Dumbledore continued, drawing their gazes away from Moody and over to where he stood positively beaming down at them, his eyes twinkling bright. “It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year.”
“Harry Potter.”
himself. He'd have told Madame and you know it.”
Draco was woken, rather rudely, by an elbow to the face.
“A joke?” Bagman repeated, obviously bewildered, before he forced out a high laugh as he smiled at the group. “No, no, not at all! Harry’s name just came out of the

“Balderdash.”
Around Harry people were leaning forwards in their seats with anticipation.
Harry was still struggling to process the fact that there were apparently other magical schools no one had ever bothered to tell him about whilst Hermione and Ron argued about the practicalities of “hiding” and entire school. This argument, of course, led to an entirely too factual explanation from Hermione about the various techniques they could have used.
when we travel or you might lose him,” Lucius, the first of the three adults to recover, informed him. Draco nodded so vigorously his platinum blond hair fell into his eyes. “How about you say goodbye to Uncle Severus whilst mummy and I get the house all shut up? It’s almost time for us to go to our new house.”
“I think the muggles call it bisexual,” Ron supplied with a shrug. “He's dated witches and wizards. In fact his most serious relationship was with a wizard. Mum was sure he was going to be the first one to settle down but then something went wrong and he's single again.”
“Who are you with, Javi?” Claude enquired, munching happily on the sweets he'd been thrown having given up on completing his essay. “It better not be Fabian Houtman…”

Well, at least he had the good sense not to be frightened of a
Squaring his shoulders he knocked on the door and, after a moment, entered.
His protestations of not being hungry, of being tired, went ignored.
He couldn't say what possessed him to do it, it was like there was something drawing his attention back in the room, but as he was crossing the threshold Draco tilted his head to glance back over his shoulder. His eyes met a pair of startlingly green bespectacled eyes.
“Your own family is no longer good enough for you, is that it?” he mother demanded, dragging her into the extravagant dining room which took up most of the ground floor of the house. One wall was completely filled by the ‘Black Family Tapestry’ upon which ever member of the family was magically recorded at birth or marriage, depending on how they entered into the family ranks. “Fine. You always were a weak little bitch, ungrateful of the advantages life’s given you. You’ve never belonged in this family and so now I

, one student on either side as they dropped their slips in. Draco was last, finding himself paired up with Ramona this time rather than Lara, and hesitated a fraction of a second before he released the piece of parchment into the flames.
Penelope, or Madame Pomfrey as she should be known, arrived first and quickly set about healing the deep scratches to Narcissa’s face. It was a painful procedure, the spells she had to use causing her entire face to sting, but she grit her teeth and smiled through it for the sake of her son who watched everything closely. Severus arrived a moment later and began brewing a couple of potions, one to help with the pain and one to heal her broken ribs.
The house elf disappeared with a tell-tale pop, allowing her to make her way up the first flight of narrow stairs towards the sitting room on the first floor of the tall and thin house. Portraits of her ancestors stared at her as she passed them by, some calling out and demanding her attention but she remained focused on making her way up the staircase.
“Really?” the unwilling Champion scoffed loudly. “You’re doing a good impression of it.”
“Good luck!” Colin exclaimed as they reached their destination. “You’re so lucky, Harry!”
?” Fleur had responded to Ron's angry question by repeating her own much slower, intoning it as though she were speaking to a child. It had made all of their blood boil. “I suppose
By the time they alighted from the train, calling out a cheerful greeting to Hagrid as they did so, the weather had taken a turn for the worse and it was a bit of a mad scramble to get to the carriages before they were all soaked to the skin. None of them envied the poor first years who were being herded towards the lake which currently looked like something out of a horror movie to Harry, the water churning unpleasantly, by the schools resident half-giant.
“Of course,
“Ravenclaw.”
There were times that Harry genuinely feared his friend’s stomach was going to explode…
“Antidotes!” he announced grandly, tapping his wand against the blackboard. The chalk rose in response, moving rapidly across the board as it covered it with the information from their previous lesson that would be relevant for them today. “You should all have prepared your recipes now,” he went on, his eyes scanning the room as students retrieved their recipes from their bags, some written out on scrolls of thick parchment whilst others, like Harry’s, scribbled on a page of muggle notepaper. He hadn’t had time to copy it out properly. “I want you to brew them carefully and then we will be selecting someone to test one…”
Moments later she was thrown out of the front door with enough force to send her tumbling painfully down the steps, landing with a pained cry on the pavement below them. Only the magical charms on the front of the house stopped the muggles going about their daily business from noticing the young woman clutching at her bleeding cheek and bruised ribs, staring up at her parents who didn’t say another word to her before shutting the door.
Ron didn’t believe him.
“Yes,” Harry responded, his hand fluttering up to smooth down his tie, “to all three.”
Sadly they were a fraction late due to an unhelpful moving staircase.
The Owlery was a circular stone room located at the top of the West Tower and no matter what time of year it was the room was always rather cold due to the fact that none of the
“Time to go,” she sighed, tucking her slip of paper into her jacket pocket. “Come on. Move.”
“Voldemort.”
“Oh, Professor, look!” Lavender suddenly cried out as the end of the lesson approached rapidly, gesturing to her chart with the feathered end of her quill. Trelawney leaned over to study the page. “I think I’ve got an unexpected planet! Oooh, which one’s that, Professor?”
The worst thing about his new dreams, the ones about the Beauxbatons student, was that he didn't even know the boy’s name and there was no way for him to find it out without asking either him or one of his friends and that…that simply wasn't possible. They were all seventeen, at least, making them Seventh Years whilst he, despite being the ‘

And yet Ron, his most trusted confident, responded with a sullen glare.
“Honestly? I don’t know,” Draco sighed at length, shifting so that his arms were pillowed beneath his head. It stretched out his back, a loud pop emanating from the base of his spine. “He was absolutely petrified. No matter what they were trying to suggest, and by
Harry was pretty sure he wasn't the only student who had stopped paying attention as soon as Mr Filch’s name was mentioned. Given that the caretaker had had it out for him and his friends ever since their first day of school when he and Ron had gotten lost and ended up in an area which had been deemed “out of bounds” (a polite way for saying that there was a three-headed dog protecting the secret entrance to a series of tests which had been designed to protect one of the most powerful and rare magical gemstones on the planet) it was hardly surprising that with his continued efforts to make their lives a misery they had all settled into a mutual hate/hate relationship. Thus was it really any wonder that he had several much better things to do than listen to notices from the sadistic Argus Filch.
Claude grunted with approval.
Would no one believe him when he told them that he didn’t his name into the
“Don’t you dare insult my mother, Potter.”
“Draco Malfoy, at your service,” he supplied his name without hesitation, so focused on his cousin that he didn't even realising how many people were staring straight him. “Our mothers are sisters, Fleur, only mine decided to get away from Voldemort’s clutches before it was too late, as did my father, saving their reputations and their souls. Unlike yours.”
He couldn’t stop himself from glancing back over his shoulder at the still silent fourteen-year-old, meeting the stunning pair of green eyes with his own for the briefest of moments before he turned his attention to where he was going, following his Headmistress back up the stairs. A high-pitched squeal was all the warning he received upon re-entering the
“And with...” he paused, glancing across at the clock mounted on the wall beside the window in order to find out what the time was. “…forty-five minutes to go until we land.”
Thankfully it wasn’t more than five minutes later that Draco felt his eyelids growing heavy and, rather than fighting it as he could have done to keep Ramona company until she was ready to fall back asleep, he allowed them to fall closed and in a matter of minutes he was dreaming about flying through the clouds in pursuit a snitch glinting in the perfect sunlight.
After all, there was only a one in sixteen chance of his name actually being selected…
In fact there were only three parts of his uniform, both his everyday outfit and the robes which he only had to don for special occasions such as this, that
“There's nothing wrong with being gay, Ronald,” Hermione pointed out. “And I just wondered as you've been developing a rather unhealthy obsession with Viktor Krum.”
The celebration in the carriages luxurious common room had lasted until gone midnight.
Lastly he kicked off his shoes, leaving him in just his socks as he took a seat at his desk.
“Oh, hello,” Ron responded stiffly, his smile forced for the first time in their friendship. The redhead made no move to get up when Harry pushed himself off of the door and moved to perch on the end of his bed so that he could remove his shoes, being careful with his laces so that they wouldn’t be damaged. It was a habit that he’d grown up with thanks to the Dursley’s, his relatives having refused to replace his broken laces the one time that he’d pulled too hard on them and they’d snapped. “I suppose congratulations are in order.”

he requested, his accent truly horrific. He had been learning Spanish as long as Draco had but he didn’t share the blonde’s talent for languages so for him it was hard going.
“…I beg your pardon?”
It wasn’t all that surprising that the applause lasted for almost a full five minutes before Professor Dumbledore was finally able to restore order to the excited Hufflepuff students.
Add to that the fact that they shared the lesson with Fleur DeLacour and the rest of her Slytherin cronies and Double Potions had taken on something akin to a session of torture.
He didn’t realise he was shaking his head until Hermione gave him a little nudge, hissing,
“Crucio!”

Someone snorted behind him, the sound drowning out a shocked gasp from someone else, and Harry watched as his enemy floundered for a moment before reaching for her wand…
Personally Harry thought that anyone who was under the age of seventeen and still wanted to put their name in for such a notoriously dangerous competition was clinically insane.
It wasn’t until he was massaging his moisturiser into his pale skin that his thoughts strayed from the actions he was completely purely on autopilot, his mind taking him back to one of the many times that he had his ex-boyfriend, Dieter, had showered together. Dieter had always been amused by how complicated Draco’s shower routine was but had delighted in “helping” him to apply his moisturiser as it had regularly led to something more pleasurable.
“Ron’s got all those brothers to compete against at home,” she’d gone on, adding to her explanation as he’d munched on the slices of toast she had brought him from breakfast after he’d failed to appear before the tables were being cleared. “And you’re his best friend, Harry, and you’re really famous. He’s always shunted to one side when people see you and he puts up with it and he never mentions it but I suppose this is just one time too many…”

JJ released Fabian's hand and made his way to the door, nodding politely to Draco in order to move the blond boy out of the way, and then the room was flooded with the orange glow of a distant sunset as he flung open the door and hopped down onto the ground. Unlatch get the magical steps JJ unfolded them before offering his hand to Madame Maxime who had moved to stand in the door play, guiding her down the steps as a gentleman should.

“But Bagman wanted to tell us what's happening at Hogwarts, remember?” the most volatile of the three of them huffed as he dropped down onto the other bench seat. Harry, as the last in, turned around on the spot and began struggling to pull the stiff sliding door closed. “At the World Cup, remember? But my own mother won't say. Wonder what – ”

His slowly worded response was instinctive more than anything else, a stating of the facts.
This was his standard cue to begin his ablutions; firstly he used a tiny amount of body wash to scrub his face clean with his hands, next he shampooed his blonde locks twice and put in a decent amount of conditioner which he left to do its job as he took the sea sponge to his body, creating a remarkable amount of bubbles with the body wash as he scrubbed every inch of his skin with particular attention being paid to his underarms and the soles of his feet. Only once all of the scented body wash had been rinsed off did he set about washing the conditioner out of his hair, combing through the luxuriously soft locks with his fingers.
He’d had too many “
They'd been together for almost two years, ever since Draco had come out as gay, and he'd thought their relationship was only going to get stronger as they grew older. Apparently his ex-boyfriend hadn't felt the same way, being two years older than Draco, and had dumped him the day before he'd graduated from Beauxbatons not the previous year but the year before, publicly informing the younger teen that he “wanted to be free to see whoever he wanted as he pursued his chosen career path” and that he “didn’t want to be tied to an underage wizard who couldn't contribute to his future plans.” It had been humiliating…
No one, not even the twins who he thought knew him so well, would believe him.

Hagrid had seemed genuinely confused by their lack of enthusiasm for the creatures so after sharing a pointed look with his friends Harry, Ron and Hermione put on a rather impressive performance, giving the illusion that they were not only enjoying themselves but that they thought that rearing the new breed of monster Hagrid himself had bred was a fantastic idea.

Alone for the first time since they'd boarded the carriage Draco took his time stripping off his everyday uniform; a fitted blazer over the top of an equally fitted shirt, worn with a long, thin tie with a blunt end, a pair of trousers which weren't
“Well, you look a little bit more alive than the last time I saw you,” Draco murmured as his friends joined him just before a house elf appeared to lead them inside the building. Claude grimaced, rubbing gently at his stomach. “Good luck if any of your classes are up there…”

He loved the feeling of being so high up, something that he had come to love ever since discovering flying and Quidditch, and the way the wind moved around his body, turning whatever he was wearing into a second skin. He hated the smell, the fact that with every step you risked crushing a tiny skeleton beneath your foot and the hundreds of eyes that were constantly watching your every move. Hermione, on the other hand, hated pretty much everything about the Owlery and so had been happy to leave him to write his letter.
, teaching them all how to properly behave on such an occasion as this, and so it only took a couple of seconds for them to get themselves ready. Nina and Thierry were at the front, the Frenchman stood on the right with his arm offered so that she could rest her hand atop his. Then came Skye, Jan, Josephine and Fabian, all paired up in the same manner. Next came the three pairs of Senior Prefects; Adelaide and Javier, Yvette and Claude, Ramona and JJ.
“C-Cousin?”
“Who? Me?”
“Huh…” Harry mumbled softly, returning his gaze to the wizard he now knew significantly more about. “That’s…good to know…and somewhat concerning…do you think he’s…dark?”

It was all she’d been able to think about for weeks.

?” she had crowed delightfully, flicking her hair back dramatically as her gaggle of cronies chuckled along with her. Crabbe and Goyle followed her around like a pair of lovesick puppies, ogling her breasts as soon as they had begun to show last year and obeying her every whim. Pansy Parkinson loathed her, everyone knew that, but she also knew that it was better to be friends with the girl she was jealous of than to be her enemy and so she played the role of best girl friend very well. Blaise Zabini was the smartest in their group, dark and mysterious whilst Theodore Knott was amazingly shy for a member of Slytherin house. He was a sheep, plain and simple, and did whatever his friends did. Pike, the thug, was there as always even though no one really liked him. “You've got a father and a brother at the Ministry and you don't ever
Harry and Ron fell upon the food like they hadn't eaten in days rather than the mere hours it had been whilst Hermione, as per usual, took a much more sedate pace and loaded up her plate only after careful consideration of what she wanted to eat. Harry loaded up his with anything that was within easy reaching distance. Ron didn't bother to load his plate at all.

Draco fled the library mere seconds before the irate librarian de ended on his friends to give them a lecture on proper library etiquette. He could feel the boys gaze upon him right until the moment he slipped out into the corridor which made him smile to himself and shake his head as he began traversing the corridors which would take him to the nearest exit to their carriage; the boy was obviously inexperienced in dealing with whatever feelings he had as his attentions were more than obvious. In fact Draco would go so far as to say they were positively blatant. Whereas Draco had purposefully allowed the other boy to catch him staring he knew that him noticing the Hogwarts student hadn’t been part of the plan.

I would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket just to clarify the procedure which we will be following this year.” He paused, gesturing towards the doors which opened to admit two smartly dressed men only one of whom Draco recognised as a former Quidditch Beater. “But firstly, let me introduce, for those who do not know them, Mr Bartemius Crouch, Head of the Department of International Magical Co-operation and Mr Ludo Bagman, Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports.”

“Why?” Fred, the eldest Weasley twin, demanded.
Flushing almost purple with a mixture of rage and embarrassment Fleur scrambled to her feet, fixing her clothing as she moved but the damage was done. Not only would she be remembered for being the girl who was turned into a ferret but she’d also forevermore be remembered as the girl who flashed almost the entire school her pink, lacy underwear.

She hummed thoughtfully before returning to filing her already perfect looking nails.
“Yeah, the taste will linger for a while,” Harry explained apologetically, watching as Claude reached across to pick up the offending sandwich so that he could take a bite himself. He chewed, humming before swallowing and going in for a second bite, smiling over at Javier who let out an indignant cry. Harry chuckled, “Marmite; you either love it or you hate it.”
Ramona frowned, patting her hands over her voluminous curls self-consciously.
“Oh,” his friend mumbled. “You’re not into me right?”
“Did you ask an older student to put it into the
“Professor Dumbly-dorr, my horses have travelled a long way,” she responded, smiling approvingly down at the bespectacled wizard. Draco noticed that she was playing up her accent, turning her voice into even more of a purr than usual. “They will need attending to.”
A bell chimed signalling the end of breakfast and as one the student body rose from their seats, most of them abandoning whatever food they hadn’t managed to eat in favour of making it to their first class on time. Some, such as Ron, gathered up whatever they still wanted to eat and took it with them, stuffing the buttered toast into his mouth as they hurried down to the dungeons for their first class of the day; Potions with Professor Snape.
He found Lara at one of the four sinks to the left of the bathroom door, dressed in a fluffy white bathrobe with her hair secured in an elegant towel-twist on top of her head, carefully applying a lightly scented moisturiser to her face. They smiled at one another in greeting but, as was the unwritten rule in the unisex bathroom, didn’t stop to chat with each other.
Despite the complexities of the magic required the overall solution was alarmingly simple.
Harry couldn't blame her for finding refuge from all of that as it was bad enough when Dean Thomas got started on his love of football, discussing things at length with Seamus and Harry who were the only ones who understood what he was going on about and then only vaguely, in Harry's case, as they weren't quite do obsessive about the popular muggle sport.
Thus he was well aware of the reputation the various branches of his family tree had back in England where the majority of the trouble had taken place. He knew what people said about the Malfoy family, that people assumed they'd fled so as not to face prosecution when in reality it was to escape the deadly clutches of both of their families and start a new life in peace. And, most importantly just then, he knew that his cousins who had no doubt been indoctrinated to follow in their parent’s footsteps were currently attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Fleur, the eldest, was fourteen and Gabrielle, her sister, eleven.
“This one’s free,” Hermione announced, relieved, and ducked into the compartment. She settled down onto one of the long bench seats, the ancient springs protesting loudly. “Come on, Ron. No point worrying about it now. We'll just have to wait and see what happens.”
Harry reached across to pat his friends hand reassuringly after hearing her gasp loudly in shock but he kept the majority of his attention on what Professor Dumbledore was saying.
As he was making his way across the freshly cut grass between the stone courtyard and the carriage he was joined by two of his fellow

“This is a measure we feel is necessary, given that the Tournament tasks will still be difficult and dangerous, whatever precautions we take, and it is highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope with them. I will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them Hogwarts Champion,” Dumbledore continued, fixing his gaze pointedly on the Weasley twins who had already begun discussing different ways they could still get their names entered. “I therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under the age of seventeen.”
Mercifully he only had the conclusion of his essay to finish and he completed it in no time at all, ending the piece of work with his usual signature, a somewhat dramatic version of his name which he’d perfected over the last few months after signing forms had become more commonplace once he’d turned seventeen. Whereas before he’d come of age he’d had to get his parents signatures on everything he was now allowed to sign them himself which was both exciting and terrifying all at once. Finished with his homework he put everything away properly, securing the three rolls of parchment with different coloured ribbons for each class to make identifying them easier, and brought out a smaller piece of parchment.
Jan Boerefijn was very, very straight and something of a slut. He'd dated almost every girl in their year, Ramona included, and had slept with over half of them. Really, they should all hate him but he wasn't a horrible person, he didn't cheat on his girlfriends, his attentions never wandered from the person he was dating he just happened to date a lot. A lot a lot.
Claude groaned, obviously reluctant, but eventually nodded.

He truly did but it still hurt to hear his friend pointing it out like she would a fact in a book.
Rolling over, uncaring of the fact that his movements jostled the sleeping couple he had previously been turned towards, he smirked at Ramona who had half of his bed to herself whilst the other three were squashed together on the other half. It always ended up that way whenever the four of them would talk so late into the night that they just fell asleep together despite the fact that it would have made sense to give Claude the most room.
“I mean, I know you’re obsessed with me but I didn’t think you’d be so obvious about it.”
Tilting her head so as to see the clock on his bedside table Ramona answered,
As one the students recited the motto they had learnt in their first year,
He had been less than thrilled to discover that they were to travel to Hogwarts in a flying carriage pulled by a dozen winged horses, given how utterly terrified he was of heights, but it was actually the view out of the window that was causing his stomach to rebel. Whilst the interior of the carriage seemed to be perfectly still thanks to a suitable stabilising spell the exterior of the carriage was, in fact, at the mercy of the elements and as such was being flung this way and that. This meant that the view out of the various windows in the different rooms of the carriage which was, of course, bigger on the inside was constantly moving, the fluffy white clouds jerking back and forth across the blindingly blue sky, the sun flashing up once in a while to blind them. Claude wasn't the only one suffering and so most of the elegant drapes had been drawn across the windows, Draco's included, but the damage had been done as far as their friend was concerned, the motion combined with his fear leaving him desperately trying to keep his breakfast down in his stomach where it belonged.
“I wish I could,” he admitted softly, a look of genuine regret on his less than handsome yet still pleasantly striking features. “Not only have I entered into a teaching contract at Hogwarts I cannot abandon her child any sooner than you could abandon yours.”
“The Hogwarts champion is Cedric Diggory!”

Harry got the feeling this was either going to be really good for them or really,
His arrogance, however, was still pretty strong but only when he had a reason to behave so.
Champion, let alone the second one.
Harry's attention was drawn away from his best friends by the concern he could hear in Hannah Abbott’s voice, prompting him to twist his body so that he could look back over his left shoulder to where the boy she was addressing was sitting. Neville was pale, unusually so, his hair and clothes looking more unkempt than usual, and his hands were trembling.
A cheer rang out, startling every single person in the room, and Draco turned along with everyone else to watch as two identical red haired boys, all gangly limbs and broad smiles, sped towards the crowd. Both of them had one hand raised almost triumphantly and after a moment Draco realised that they were holding identical potion vials filled with a blue liquid.
“I would have gone to Madame and suggested that Josephine and I share with Nina and Adelaide were it not for the fact that Skye, Desiree and the ‘
“Well, yes, I suppose so,” Crouch agreed, equally as mystified as Draco’s fellow champions by his decision to willingly add to his workload. “It shall be left up to each champion to decide whether or not they wish to sit the exams. Now I really must go, I’ve left young Weatherby in charge…very enthusiastic…a little bit over-enthusiastic, if truth be told…”
Offering the mystery boy a quick smile, almost a smirk, Draco turned and proceeded to lead Lara across to the long bench, holding her hand as she took her seat. He then took his own seat, running his fingers through his hair just as Professor Dumbledore called for silence.
“Sir, I’m sorry, but it’s Mr Bagman that wants him,” Colin managed to get out, holding out a slip of parchment for the Potions Master to snatch out of his hand. “It’s to do with the Tournament. All the champions have got to go; I think they want to take photographs…”
“Like them, Potter?” Fleur sneered triumphantly as Harry slowed to a halt beside Hermione whose cheeks were flushed with anger. “And this isn’t all they do, you know? Here! Look!”

students, all of them participating in an in depth conversation with a couple of wizards in a portrait hanging on the wall. Viktor Krum was with them, his muscles threatening to burst through the sleeves of his uniform as he stood with them folded across his chest and of course this had the predictable side-effect of making most of the Hogwarts group, including Ron, Harry noticed, but not including Hermione, go weak at the knees, their cheeks flushing brightly.
“Probably like that awful cousin of yours,” Ramona snorted. “Only prettier.”

Glaring softly at her husband Narcissa made a show of picking up the suitcase.
He made no attempt to be subtle or discreet, pausing in his journey to the table so that he could turn back and seek out the eyes which had fixated upon him. There were, in fact, more than a few people openly staring across at him with varying levels of interest in their eyes, some even with a rather heavy doses of attraction or lust making an appearance, but it took him a moment to find that particular gaze which had caught his senses attention.
“There are those who’ll turn even the most innocent of occasions to their advantage,” Moody announced, almost completely drowning out the end of Cedric’s statement. “It’s my job to think the way dark witches and wizards do, Karkaroff, as you ought to remember…”

Was he sure?
“Oh, I think the least you can do is owe me a favour,” he announced as, with a flick of his wand, he sent the tiny bundles of parchment to the correct owner. Ramona murmured her thanks, tucking hers into her pocket, while both Claude and Javier continued to stare across at him in protest, tiny bundles on their open palms. “Or perhaps some Belgian chocolates…”
“…uh huh…” Draco muttered, blowing on the last of the four slips of parchment in an effort to dry the ink. He was proud of his penmanship, something his friends knew all too well, and he was perfectly aware that the easiest way to convince him to do something he either didn't want to or didn't technically have to was to flatter him in some way given that his pride was his greatest weakness. However… “It sounds more like the three of you couldn't be bothered so I suppose you all owe me a favour now for doing your work for you…”
as she referred to them) were quite possibly the only people in the entire school that she couldn't stand.
“Tell us what's happening at Hogwarts?” Fred bellowed out of the window after forcing his way through the others, literally pushing them aside in his haste which left Harry pressing Ginny up against the partition wall. George followed his twin, plastering himself to the others back as he too leaned his head out of the window. “What rules are they changing?”
He hated Halloween at the best of times, the celebration holding an unfortunately special place in his heart now that he knew when and how his parents had died, but with the eerie feeling created by the candles having burnt low and the stressful event of the evening he couldn’t help but shudder, picking up the pace and overtaking Cedric so he could get out.
Continuing to chuckle to himself Draco hung his towel up on the hook provided, kicked off his awful footwear and turned on the shower to get the water heating up. Whilst he waited for it to reach the temperature he personally preferred he unpacked his wash bag, placing everything with easy reach of the stream of steaming water; shampoo, conditioner, body wash, natural sea sponge and a body moisturiser designed to be applied in the shower.
As reassuring as his parents words had been it had been his friends that had saved him, none of them afraid to correct him when he was in the wrong or point out when he was letting his “green side” as they referred to his jealousy get the better of him. They'd worked as a team, Claude, Javier and Ramona, to keep him from becoming his own worst enemy.

“That's because you spend all your free time designing fabulous interiors and redecorating any room you can get your hands on,” he pointed out, dropping down beside her so that they ended up lying side by side, their heads together on his pillow. “You can build a career on that. I can hardly build a career on reading novels and short stories, well, unless I become an editor or a…a reviewer, neither of which hold much appeal if I'm completely honest.”
His eyes stung with frustration even worse than before.

A titter of giggles spread through the crowd as Gregory removed his hand, blushing furiously, moments before the ferret emerged from the bottom of Vincent’s trouser leg.

“I suppose that means I have to change into my robes,” she huffed, her face scrunching up in annoyance as she thought of the delicate concoction of the finest silk money could buy. Because of her more ample figure she had always hated wearing the light fabric which clung to every curve she possessed but Draco, an impartial observer given his sexuality, had always thought she looked truly stunning in them. “I hope Skye hasn't moved my things…”

students, Odette and Yvette. He doubted very much that they had been studying as Draco and his friends had been, that wasn’t really their style. Oh, they were bright enough pupils and would graduate in the top third of their class but they wouldn’t put an ounce more effort into their education than was absolutely necessary. For them the real challenge was in their search for a suitable husband.
Draco had fallen unusually silent by the time they took their place inside the roped off area.
Madame Maxine had made it perfectly clear during the welcoming banquet that she expected every student who met the various requirements set down in the amended rules of the historical contest to put their name down for “consideration” by the end of the week.

“What's that he's drinking, do you suppose?” Seamus, their Irish friend, supposed loudly as they all watched Moody take a long drink from a strange looking hip-flask. He was Dean’s best friend and prone to mischief, almost as much as the Weasley twins although he was not nearly so inventive about it. He was also something of a snob and rather filthy minded.

“I hope it’s not always this cold,” Ramona muttered, rubbing her hands together as her eyes glanced across at the grand marble staircase which dominated the layout of the large room.
When he finally sat up, reaching out for his own discarded jacket, Draco snorted loudly,
It was a bit of a mad scramble after that, everyone hurrying into the classroom to take their seats as they’d been ordered to, and in the end it was poor Neville who lost the five points.
It couldn’t have been the DeLacour’s, he reasoned.
“Igor!”
How did he explain it when he didn’t understand what had happened himself?
No, not really, but would that affect his decision to stand beside his friends?
They blinked at each other for a long moment before Draco finally offered the younger Wizard a subtle nod of acknowledgement just before he finally exited the crowded room.
It wasn't the first time he'd woken up with an erection, he was a teenage boy going through puberty after all, and he knew that it was perfectly normal thanks to the extremely awkward “talk” Mrs Weasley had given both him and Ron during his stay at the Burrow before the Quidditch World Cup. He also knew, thanks to the same awkward “talk” that at they'd had, that waking up from a so called “wet dream” or feeling the need to “touch himself” were also perfectly normal things to experience whilst going through puberty. All of this had been highly amusing to him and Ron after the “talk” was over and done with, to the point where they'd compared what had happened to them, but this latest development wasn't so funny.
“It’s him, Ron!” Harry couldn’t stop himself from gasping sharply as the
“I hate to rush you but we have a rather strict timetable to keep to,” Narcissa murmured, nodding towards where Lucius was admittedly reluctantly continuing to shrink their possessions so that they could be carried in a single suitcase.

Hagrid, evidently, thought it would be fun for them to help raise them and so each of them had been forced to adopt one of the creatures which resembled a pale, slightly deformed shell-less lobster, legs sticking out at odd angles and they smelt of rotting fish.

“Come on,
Herbology was significantly more tense than usual due to the fact that every single Hufflepuff bar Hannah Abbott, refused to so much as speak to him for the duration.
Some students had already given up, folding their arms on their desks and resting their heads upon them, and Harry was sorely tempted to join them. He was so very tired. His sleep had been disturbed for a number of reasons recently; visions sent by Voldemort, nightmares of his Godfather being captured and, most frequently, dreams of a significantly more erotic nature focused solely on the striking blonde haired student from Beauxbatons.
She hadn’t imagined it would hurt so much to see her mother draw her deformed looking wand, a reflection of her own deformed personality perhaps, and blast her image from the tapestry. Her sister’s face had been removed similarly shortly after she’d been thrown out.
Making her way along the muggle street she stopped in front of the house she had grown up in and been thankful to leave following her marriage, waiting for it to fully appear once the concealment charm had recognised her as a member of the Black family. Reaching down to lift up the front of the long black skirt she wore underneath her stylish emerald green coat the elegant young woman ascended the steps at the front of the building and, after tapping the tip of her wand on the door to unlock it, slipped inside the long entrance hall.
“Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts the Heads of the participating schools, along with the Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year,” Dumbledore interrupted the seemingly premature celebrations, silencing the premature celebrations. “Only students who are of age, that is to say seventeen years or older, will be allowed to put their names for consideration.”
It was Hermione who jumped up from her seat and proceeded to slam the door closed.
“Think of the possibilities,” Ron chuckled, slumping down and stretching his legs out to rest on the seat opposite, much to Hermione’s disapproval, as his hands absentmindedly brought the other half of his sandwich to his mouth. “It would've been so easy to push DeLacour off a glacier and make it look like an accident…shame her mother likes her…”
Snapping his gaze away from the boy Draco shot his friend a glare as she giggle knowingly at him and began packing up his things, rolling his parchment carefully before placing both it and his books in his stylish messenger bag. His quill, made of fwooper feathers, and bottle of ink were stored in the specially designed wooden box his mother had gotten for Christmas when he was fourteen before being placed inside the front pocket of the messenger bag.

Harry promised he would. Siblings generally ended up in the same house, like the Weasley, but that wasn't set in stone. Parvati’s twin sister, Padma, was in Ravenclaw and as Hermione had mumbled thoughtfully you'd expect identical twins, of all people, to end up together.
Lucius grunted in agreement, thinking of all the hoops they’d had to jump through in order to gain permission to leave the country at all. He hurried across the fire to contact first his old school friend and then the sympathetic young woman who had taken over the position of Matron at

His eyes sought out his brothers beside Harry and he gave the older boy a thumbs up.
It was just then, as they were being ushered towards the seats which had been made available to them at the end of one of the tables, that Draco felt the hairs on the back of his neck prickle, warning him that someone was paying particularly close attention to him.

“Finally I wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this Tournament is not to be entered into lightly. Once a champion has been selected by the Goblet of Fire, he or she is obliged to see the Tournament through to the end,” Dumbledore’s tone turned graver as he gazed out at the excited faces, pressing his point home as clearly as he could. “The placing of your name in the Goblet constitutes a binding, magical contract. There can be no change of heart once you have become champion. Please be very sure, therefore, that you are whole-heartedly prepared to play, before you drop your name into the Goblet.”

No, he couldn’t explain everything he was feeling to Sirius in a letter.

Whilst he waited for it to reach the temperature he personally preferred he unpacked his wash bag, placing everything with easy reach of the stream of steaming water; shampoo, conditioner, body wash, a natural sea sponge and a body moisturiser designed to be applied in the shower.

Harry really couldn't blame Ron for slamming the door shut with enough force to break the glass in the window following the Slytherin gang’s departure, heading off in search of the trolley and poor students to torment, not after what had been said regarding his family.
“Take this to my mother, please, Auctus.”
“Huh…” Professor Moody huffed deeply before grinning broadly. “I’ll do that then.”
…” Ramona muttered sarcastically, rolling her eyes towards Draco who couldn't help but chuckle softly. Odette, Yvette and Desiree were leading members of their schools dance troupe and he suspected that Yvette would be most put out at being denied a chance to perform. “They're going to think we're all complete idiots with those two showing off…”

Hermione vanished midway through lunch, scurrying off the library much to Ron’s continued bemusement as he certainly didn't see the appeal that the library offered, much preferring to spend his entire lunch break stuffing his belly with the delicious food provided.

Now, Harry could put up with a lot from Fleur DeLacour but one thing he would not stand for was listening to the selfish girl insult such a wonderfully kind woman as Molly Weasley.
“First Ron, then you,” he huffed angrily. “This isn’t my fault.”
It was Colin Creevey, the promising young photographer who had been more than a little bit obsessed with Harry since coming to Hogwarts. The Third Year flashed a smile across at his hero before forcing his expression into one of politeness as he approached Professor Snape.
prize money, eh?”
Professor Snape’s arrival could not have been any timelier, Harry realised, as Fleur was forced to abandon her plan to curse or hex him for daring to humiliate her like he had.
“Ah, but Dumbly-dorr…”
Thierry Giles was quiet possibly the quietest person he had ever met, speaking only when there was no other option. He wasn't shy, as such, merely preferred the peacefulness of his own company over the liveliness of others. No, Draco couldn't see him enjoying sharing a room with Claude and Javier but then again he was already sharing with Fabian and Jan who were just as lively as the couple were, so he probably wouldn't be too happy either way.

had once belonged to Slytherin house although even the simplest bit of research would reveal that that was more of a coincidence than a rule. After all Draco’s own parents were proof that being sorted into Slytherin wasn’t a confirmation of darkness.
“Sometimes a little emotional blackmail is called for,” he eventually announced once Claude had stopped moving around, having found his desired comfortable position. “Especially when your friend is being a bit of an idiot and worrying about things that don't really matter. You're cousins are evil minions. We all know that. Don't let them ruin our last year.”
Draco's last task of settling in was to unpack his large collection of novels and short stories, filling every possible space with his books. He loved to lose himself in the wonderful worlds created in the various works of fiction, most of them surprisingly muggle in origin although he had collected all thirty-eight works by a witch called Ingrid Crawford. It had been his mother who had introduced him to his favourite author, however; the muggle Jane Austen, and as always her much read works were given pride of place on top of his bedside cabinet.
staff and students faces that it was a rarity for Dumbledore to raise his voice as he had just done, silencing Moody before the former Auror could continue. Karkaroff was furious, his face turning an alarming shade of purple as he faced the room full of people who had just been reminded of his dark past.
Fleur seemed equally as insulted by the description of her hair as she was by the slight to her mother, finally succeeding in pulling herself from the Professors grip and storming off.
Well, he reasoned to himself, if he’s named one he should name the other champions too.
What if his name was selected?
For the next two and a half hours the students were forced to complete a complicated circular chart upon which they were expected to record the positions of the planets at the moment of their birth. It was proving to be quite a challenge, one that only a few of them were enjoying and Harry was most definitely not one of them as he found himself faced with the problem of having two Neptune’s upon his chart and nowhere left to put Pluto.
“When arguing a case it is important to present the correct facts,” Claude argued quickly, grabbing hold of her wrist when she tried to flick his ear. “Otherwise it puts the other facts you stated into question which, considering how true they were, would be a problem?”
“As I explained to Professor Karkaroff it simply doesn’t work like that, Madame…”
“Very
were led across to the table farthest away from where Draco was sat, the boys waiting politely for the girls to take their seats first before dropping down onto the benches alongside them.
“I want you to call me if you experience any lingering pain or problems,” Penelope ordered as she finished up, rising from the crouched position she had been working in and smoothing out the fabric of her skirt. She’d obviously come straight from work as she still wore the distinct uniform of a hospital matron. “Especially in regards to those ribs of yours.”
“Very well,” Snape snapped, crumpling the parchment in his hand as he turned to Harry. “Potter, leave your things here; I want you back down here later to test your antidote.”
“We must follow the rules,” Mr Crouch announced calmly from where he stood apart from the group, his face half concealed in shadow. “And the rules clearly state that those people whose names come out of the
Ron gaped at her, “Of course you did…”
Unlike Ron who had never bothered to ask her about her regular visits Harry knew that it wasn't just her thirst for knowledge that drew her to the library at all hours of the day but the peace and quiet it offered when compared with the rest of the school, particularly her dormitory where her roommates, Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil, spent all of their time giggling about “
“Hi, Colin.”
“The Heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in October with their short-listed contenders in October, and the selection of the three champions will take place at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school and a thousand Galleons personal prize money.”

Given that they were all anxiously awaiting the arrival of the feast the sorting seemed to drag on and on, an endless stream of new students joining the houses they'd been given. As usual there was a pretty even spread between the houses although there were a few more Hufflepuff’s than usual this year, the “
“Yes,” she responded, speaking firmly but kindly as she had treated all of the house elves she had become mistress of in her own house following her marriage. “Please see to it that all of my belongings which remain in this house are sent to Malfoy Manor at once.”
windows had glass in them so as to allow the owls to come and go freely. This also meant that like the top of the Astronomy Tower which was also open the elements it could be incredibly draughty. The floor, multi-layered and uneven, was entirely covered in straw, owl droppings, and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and voles and the walls were lined with hundreds of perches, going right up to the top of the tower, for the owls to nest on.
“I’m tired!”
Her sister’s trial was all the newspapers seemed to care about these days and quite rightly so, the things that she and her three accomplices had done were utterly despicable. It horrified her to think that someone with whom she shared so much more than merely blood could be capable of such a thing, of torturing a young couple who had welcomed a child into the world only the year before to the point where their minds had broken. Frank and Alice Longbottom would spend the rest of their lives in a secure ward inside St Mungo’s leaving their infant son as much of an orphan as Harry Potter, the ‘Boy-Who-Lived.’
, but nothing happened. Instead he found himself thinking that the grey of his eyes was all wrong, that the colour was too bright, and that the shape wasn’t right, too soft and round. “I didn’t put it in. I was telling the truth.”
Given his past dealing with Ministry of Magic the knowledge that they had a hand in the secrecy only served to make Harry frown deeper. They'd tried to expel him the previous year, after all, for defending his muggle cousin from a bunch of Dementors and they were the ones who had forced Sirius, his Godfather and the closest link he had to his deceased parents, to go on the run after having wrongly imprisoned him for a crime he didn't commit.
I had actually planned to carry this chapter on a little bit further than this but it ended up working better when I ended it here. Comments & Suggestions welcome. X
He hated the fact that, yet again, everyone was staring at him.
Odette eagerly danced forwards to the front of the line, fussing with the layers of stiff tulle which made up the skirt of her baby blue tutu until they sat exactly how she wanted them to. She had laced the bodice of her dress as tightly as possible to give her ample cleavage.
“Cedric,” Dumbledore continued, addressing the other

in Potions but his favourite subjects were Transfiguration and Charms so if possible he'd like to find a future career which would utilise his skills in those areas.
If it hadn't been for everything that had happened at the Quidditch World Cup during the summer the way everyone had been behaving might have been amusing, the half-sentences a sign of an amusing or exciting secret but as it was they just served to make him all the more paranoid about the coming school year. His only comfort was the fact that Ron and Hermione, his best friends since their first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, were just as confused as he was by everyone's strange behaviour that morning.
Sorry for the delay – had a bit of writers block which was firmly dealt with my taking my five Godchildren to the Harry Potter Studio Tour a couple of weeks ago. I think it’s safe to say that they loved it and I loved seeing how much they enjoyed it. So, hopefully I can churn out a few more chapters before I get stalled again. Lol. Comments/Suggestions welcome. X
It was amusing to see both Penelope and Severus adopt the same scowl as they correctly interpreted her carefully structured explanation. She had met Severus through his friendship with Lucius but they themselves had bonded over the fact that their parents were less than ideal, prone to violence although she had been spared the horrific extremes Severus had been put through by his brute of a father. Penelope was simply a good healer, often intuitive to a fault and more than a little bit suspicious, perceptive of the little details.
Draco was left to surmise that the young witch was either a half-blood or a muggleborn although he did think that it was more likely to be the latter.
She was just making things up to sound mysterious in front of his gullible classmates.
“I know, right?” Claude sighed deeply. “He’s quite pleasing to the eye, isn’t he?”
Ron shot her a smug look as she turned to book around so that she could continue reading.
They’d cast her out of the house that night with only the clothes on her back.
Ron’s cry of dismay was completely drowned out by the uproar of approval which came from the Hufflepuff table as every single member of the friendliest house jumped to their feet, screaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way past them, grinning broadly, and followed the previous Champions down to the side chamber behind the teachers table.

The fact that his inky black gaze met Harry’s as he spoke warned the student that he would be the one testing one of the antidotes, probably the one that had been brewed improperly.
“Five points shall be deducted from the last student to take their seat.”
“I know but trust me the description of Fleur’s family is significantly worse,” Hermione explained. “I can show you that later, if you’re interested. And the Black and Lestrange families which they’re also both linked to. Their histories are even darker than the Malfoy’s.  Now, in terms of recent history for the Malfoy’s this is all that the book has to say.
“He could not have crossed the Age Line,” McGonagall, his wonderful Head of House, came to his defence. She pulled him away from Bagman. “I am sure we are all agreed on that –”
“Well, shall we crack on, then?” Bagman suggested brightly, clasping his hands together with anticipation. He was far too excited about the prospect of the deadly
“I still don't know how you find the time to read as much as you do,” Ramona admitted, tracing the pattern covering one of the larger books on the top shelf before dropping down onto the bed with enough force to cause her to bounce upon the mattress. “I tried reading those books you recommended over the summer but I…I just couldn't find the time...”
Hermione’s query drew all of their attention to the top table which had several more empty seats than usual, McGonagall and Hagrid predictably amongst the missing faculty members.
“Why are you eating alone?”
This chapter has been sitting mostly written on my computer pretty much since the last time I updated this story and for that I sincerely apologise. I’m afraid my mind just went off
A loud sizzling sound filled the air as the blue flames went wild, knocking the twins back with enough force to send them flying across the room. They landed with an audible thud, their bodies literally bouncing across the stone floor like two pebbles across a flat lake, and then as though to add insult to injury their hair began to lighten, growing almost as quickly as the ice white beards which began sprouting from their youthful faces until they looked ancient.
Chaos descended upon the room as the grey haired twins rolled around on the floor, wrestling with one another over whose fault their predicament was whilst the majority of the

Not really, Draco reasoned, given that the boy in question appeared to still be in shock.
“Draco,” Ramona murmured, her voice little more than a pure as she moved to stand beside him, placing a gentle hand on his arm. He didn't miss the way the redhead’s eyes snapped across to her, an entirely different look appearing in them. “Perhaps we should be going…”
As per usual the Entrance Hall was a hive of activity as students began queuing outside the decorative doors which would eventually admit them into the Great Hall where the delicious smells of dinner were emanating from. It didn’t take long for Ron to grumble about the wait, claiming that his stomach was eating itself, and Harry was just about to beg his friend to shut up when a piercing voice cut through the general hubbub of the large crowd,
She had intended to walk off her meeting with her parents but that wasn’t possible now and so, raising her wand with her trembling hand, she apparated herself home to Malfoy Manor.
“Oh, but that's why it's so brilliant–”

“Dad says that you will never find one at the scene of the crime, though their fingerprints might be all over the guilty wand,” Ron continued after swallowing his food, focusing on scooping up some of his scrambled eggs which were covered in beans. “Mum says they’re disgustingly rich and think themselves above working for a living. She says that Lucius Malfoy was always happy for others to do the hard work and then take the credit for it even when they were at school. And supposedly they were only allowed to leave the country after they bribed the judge presiding over their case with an

“Somethings happening!”
Draco couldn’t believe what was happening.
Draco looked up from the essay he had been working on in the library at Ramona’s teasing announcement, following her gaze across to the desk opposite there’s where he caught sight a familiar messy haired boy who glanced away as soon as grey eyes met green.
Harry himself thought that, while he didn't particular fancy entering himself having spent too much time in the spotlight already being The-Boy-Who-Lived, he couldn't blame his friends for wanting to have a go. It was definitely going to be an interesting year…
“…how do you think the boy is coping with all of this?”

“Just thought you should know that your father made it into today’s paper,” their arch-nemesis announced, pretending to offer Ron the copy of the
“Draco?” Ramona called out softly, drawing him out of his thoughts. “Are you going to put your name down? Only I don't like the idea of us three going off and leaving you behind…”
He knew he had to tell Sirius what had happened, Hermione was right about that, but how?
That hurt, like a knife to his stomach; his best friend still believed that he’d found a way to get past the age-line and had decided not to share that knowledge with anyone so that he could hold onto all of the glory himself. Hermione claimed he was jealous of the attention.

He could survive anything so long as he had his friends.
All four of their group were eligible and more than capable of competing. Javier and Claude had already put their names down on the list, full of eagerness, and Ramona was planning to do so come the following morning. It was only Draco who had any serious reservations and although most of his peers assumed it was because of the well-known dangers involved in the contest (which had put off some students) it was actually because of the location;

“If anyone’s got reason to complain, it’s Potter,” Moody growled, his voice sending an unpleasant shiver down Draco’s spine; he’d heard all too many tales about the infamous Auror and his methods of catching Death Eaters, or more often than not suspected Death Eaters and his treatment of them. He was on the side of the Light, yes, but he had always operated in the grey area. “But you don’t hear him saying a word, do you? How odd…”
use transfiguration as a punishment!” McGonagall cried, rounding on Professor Moody once more who reached out to grab hold of the back of Fleur’s robes when the Slytherin attempted to storm off with an indignant huff. “Surely Dumbledore told you that?”
“Thank you.”
A sigh of relief escaped a large portion of the Great Halls occupants when the doors swing open to reveal Professor McGonagall leading a bedraggled gaggle of eleven year olds inside.
A fourth school?
“It's not going to work.”
“Tonight,” she murmured decisively, only looking across towards her brother and his boyfriend once Draco had nodded his head in agreement. “Before we retire for the night.”
“Er…good…”

“Ron,” Harry almost snapped. “Someone else must’ve done it.”
“I should never have let you go by yourself today,” Lucius murmured, his voice noticeably choked as he followed his wife out of the room. Simultaneously they raised their wands, both made of smooth black wood, and began casting spells to lock all of the windows and close up the shutters, to cover the chandeliers and any furniture they weren’t taking with them in dust sheets. “I knew how they were react and still I let you face them alone.”
“Yes,” Javier confirmed. “You have four, correct? Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and…?”
Even the confrontation with DeLacour had been somewhat predictable in that it had happened although some of her comments were just as vague as Mrs Weasley's and Ron’s older brothers had been back on the station, meaning that she knew something they didn't.
Thankfully his openness about his sexuality kept him safe from their flirtations.
Harry woke, not for the first time, with a strangled gasp as he sat bolt upright in his bed within the confines of the heavy red curtains which surrounded in only this time it wasn't because of a nightmare or some horrific vision of Voldemort. No, this time it was because of a very strange dream which had featured the cast and storyline of ‘Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves’ which Dudley had become so obsessed with over the holidays that even Harry had been forced to watch it on more than one occasion only in his dream Robin Hood had been replaced by Charlie Weasley while Harry had found himself playing the part of Maid Marion.
