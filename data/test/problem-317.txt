“Ok,” Harry said, staring intently at the readings coming from his wand for a moment. “Why did you and Astoria only have one kid?”
“I need some space,” he said, pulling the handle on the car door to open it. “I’ll call you when you can come back.”
“Pregnancy was difficult for her,” Draco explained. “Scorpius’s birth nearly killed her. We thought about adopting, but Astoria decided she would rather focus on helping the house-elves. I would have been happy to have another child, but I am perfectly content with my son.”
Harry nodded, knowing she couldn’t see it, and switched from diagnostic spells to curative ones. Finally, he hit on one that worked, causing the color to start returning to Draco’s face. But it required constant casting. As soon as the spell was cast, it wore off and Draco began to suffocate again.
Determined to think about something else, Harry grabbed the stack of papers the quill had finished with and began filling out the details that the quill didn’t know the answers to.
The quill scribbled away, oblivious of any distractions, and happy to do its job. For a moment, Harry wondered what it would be like to be so clear-headed with only one simple objective to worry about.
Harry was obsessed with his tattoo the moment he was old enough to understand what it was. He spent all the time he was allowed staring at it and reminding himself it meant that he wasn’t alone. He often pondered what thoughts his Soulmate would see popping up on his tattoo.
“Ok,” Harry said. “Take some time, but you shouldn’t walk home, it’s dangerous. And I really should stay at your place.”
As he opened the door, the owl leapt back into flight, grabbing the letter that Harry had thrown aside and forcing his way into the apartment where he dropped the letter on the kitchen counter and waited expectantly.
“Yes, I dated people. No, none of it ever got serious. I had a few men ask me to be more serious, but I couldn’t do it. None of them were worth ending my marriage with Astoria for and none of them were willing to keep dating me if I stayed with her.”
Suddenly, a bright light seemed to shine through the darkness that threatened to seep back over him. Nothing here was adding up. The familiar pain he expected never came and, in fact, Draco felt himself grow stronger every time Harry muttered the spell. This wasn’t the Harry that tortured him so many years ago. This Harry was keeping him alive.
Also, I deduced by your nearly gibberish letter that you were drinking last night. Either that, or you’re suffering from a severe concussion. I had to use three deciphering charms to make your letter make any sense at all. So, I have included  a couple of pills that do wonders to get rid of hangovers. Take one now and one in five hours and that should get you through the day.
Eventually, the workday ended and Harry packed up his stuff, giving a quick glance at his phone. Still nothing. Harry began to wonder if Draco didn’t actually want to talk to him after all.
“She glared at me the whole time we ate,” Harry replied, pulling out his wand but keeping it close to his side to continue his security check. “Wand’s out.”
“Teddy, your parents would be very proud of you,” Harry assured him, placing a comforting hand on his shoulder. “You’re taking the time to find out what you really want to do rather than throwing yourself into a life that will make you miserable. There’s nothing wrong with that.”
As soon as the liquid slipped down his throat, he felt himself returning to normal. The weight of gravity was no longer as pressing and the air his lungs brought in was filled with the oxygen he’d been so desperately missing.  A few seconds later, the spell that had been holding him down disappeared.
Harry just stared at her, unsure what to say. She watched him for a moment, waiting for a response. When she didn’t receive one, she shook her head, turning to face forward. She stared at the house for a moment. Both of them found themselves bathed in a thoughtful, but wordless silence.
A crease began to form on Harry’s forehead as he struggled to understand what this conversation meant for them.
Draco kissed him again, releasing Harry’s wrists and placing his hands on Harry’s waist, pulling him closer.
“Were you serious earlier?” Harry asked, staring at the road as he drove with one hand on the steering wheel, the other in Draco’s.
He hadn’t felt so torn up inside since he and Ginny divorced, but even that didn’t feel as awful as this. Harry sipped the second glass more slowly, melting into the comforting warmth the first glass was creating in his stomach. His thoughts began to blur slightly, making it significantly more difficult to worry about the man he’d seen earlier. Walking towards him. For the first time in nearly 20 years.
Harry heard Ron snort next to him, failing to hold back a giggle. Draco’s attention snapped away from Harry and towards Ron, his smile quickly twisting into a glare.
“Logically,” Draco replied, shrugging. “We care about each other deeply. She doesn’t want me to get hurt or to suffer from having you around.”
She looked at Harry. The moonlight broke through the clouds, making the tears that had begun to fall down her cheeks seem to glow.
He put the phone aside, face down, struggling not to think too hard about it. Unfortunately, the paperwork was dull and repetitive even with the quill’s help, making it all too easy for Harry to zone out into a fit of nerves as he worked.
“Then I met Draco and he seemed so... lost. I saw myself in him and I think he saw himself in me.” She paused for a moment, letting the silence weigh heavily upon them. “But he wasn’t like me... He still had you.
He was torn away from his thoughts at the sound of two familiar voices coming down the hallway. He would normally be happy to hear the one, but it was strange accompanied by the other.
When it came time to board the train, Harry was relieved to have his new redheaded friend and a young, honestly smartmouthed, girl with bushy brown hair to distract him on the train ride. As they talked about Hogwarts and the wizarding world they were entering, Harry’s anxieties around meeting his Soulmate began to fade away. That is, until they entered Hogwarts for the first time.
“I suggest you keep pushing your original cause,” Draco replied, his voice growing fainter. “Even if you can’t win, it’s good to bring attention to the issue.”
Harry ate in front of the tv, trying and failing to stop his mind from wandering to the phone which still sat silently.
Draco followed Harry until he came to a corner and leaned against the wall, wanting to hear this conversation. He didn't mean to snoop but he just gets curious sometimes.
"Fine," Draco snarled out of annoyance at having to talk about the Weasel. It's like hearing an annoying buzz from a bee or a fly that hangs around your ear. "I fought with him because he treated you like rubbish-"
"I'm not done yet," said Dumbledore and raised his wand to point it at the ceiling. Another flash lit up the corridor, and Dumbledore's wand grew longer and more cylindrical. He smiled at his staff and placed the end on the ground. "You shall not pass! Unless of course if you're willing to go to class early."
Harry cackled, finding it funny how Muggle Movies can be so funny to act out. He should do Aladdin next and charm an actual carpet to fly. It's actually a good idea. "It's just from some Muggle Movie and involves cartoon lions."
And then the kiss was over, but Harry brought his hands up to cup Draco's warm soft cheeks. He smiled at Draco and Draco smiled back at him. "I guess I'll see you in the sky, Draco Malfoy," he said, giving him a playful grin at the thought of catching the Snitch before Draco like always. "I'm going to beat your arse," and as he says it, his hands are travelling down south from Draco's cheeks to his back, then further down to his arse cheeks, giving them a little squeeze.
Ivy looked at her sadly, wanting to know how someone so gorgeous could be so sad. It just doesn't make sense to her. "Lavender, I know you're not," she said with a sad smile. She's glad she can see through people like others can't. "Please, may I ask why you're upset?"
Ron glared angrily at Hedwig, disliking how there will now be Owl germs all over his food. "Hey!" He looked up at Harry, a little irritably and his lips pursed together. "Harry! Get your bird off my breakfast!"
As they got inside and heard the dark blue door close behind them, they leaned towards each other and locked lips. The invisibility cloak slipped off them and Harry chucked it to his side and didn't really care where it went. Harry slowly made his way to the bed while walking backwards, pulling Draco with him and he never stopped kissing his boyfriend until Draco pulled back just an inch and had to ask, "Isn't a little early for... you know?"
Neville just stood in the centre of the room, keeping his head down. Eventually, he would look at Blaise just to get a smile from him which would calm him down.
Dean surpassed a laugh at the Slytherin. He was actually on the move to find Seamus, Neville, and Ron in this hell of a funhouse, which pretty much is just a large maze but filled with weird rooms but had no luck. He didn't realize how big this place was either. He didn't think the Room of Requirement could create more than one room.
Hermione giggled at her blushing friend and shook her head. She asked first so she'll get the answers she wants first. "Nope, I want to hear this first. There is no talking yourself out of it, Harry. You know the rules."
Harry wasn't surprised at all really. He knows the Slytherin common room has windows that also look out into the Black Lake. In the dormitories though? That's something he would like to see. Perhaps sometime else when he and Draco are alone, Draco will take him up to the boy's dormitory.
Everyone turned to look at Seamus like he'd gone bonkers. Everyone except Harry who was too busy drawing and writing depressing stuff on his blank piece of parchment. Nobody was noticing him anyway. He felt invisible to the world. He silently swore to himself as he felt tears pool up in his eyes, he didn't want anybody to see him this weak and Vulnerable. He was just a weak freak. He began to realize that he was silently sobbing but he was lucky that he was at the back of the classroom in the corner so nobody could look up at him and see him in his vulnerable state.
"Thanks...," Harry replied and ignored Snape's annoying smirk which can really piss him off at times. How does he survive with having this man as a teacher?
Draco stared back into those brilliant Emerald Green eyes of Harry Potter. He gives a fake and dramatic sigh." Oh, poor Harry Potter," he teased with a smirk on his lips.
"Oh, I think you're correct," said Harry who looked to the other side of the hallway at the Gryffindor door with a lion on it. He walked to it and wondered if this also would be the bedroom of Godric Gryffindor unless the one behind the green door is. Then what would this door be? "The word is just Godric's name, 'Godric Gryffindor'."
"Yes?" Ivy said and shot her head around to look at the boys who walked over to her. She pulled her sleeves down past her wrists so they couldn't see anything but she could sense their worry. "Oh, hello Draco and Harry. No, I'm not okay. I have the urge to... you know?"
"Anyway, and If I don't see you again have a Merry Christmas!" Ivy said and rolled her sleeves down after showing him how the spell works. She then crossed her arms over her chest from the cold. She gave him a quick hand wave and started walking backwards towards where she came from and how she entered.
They all hesitantly went downstairs but paused when finding Parvati Patil and a couple of younger girls, including Ginny, frozen to the spot in their pyjamas in the common room. It appears that they were all staring at something, but what?
"Will do, Hermione," Harry said and nodded firmly as a promise. "Thank you for helping me." He always wondered what he would do without Hermione by his side. Knowing himself, he'd probably have failed all of his subjects if it weren't for meeting her.
Draco growled deeply, knowing who Tobias, Jacob, and Max were. Whenever he sees them again, he will give them hell and they just won't escape from him. He hopes they're feeling entirely guilty now because when someone messes with his friends, oh, they will be sorry.
Ivy slowly smiled in the kiss and sluggishly walked Lavender back towards Lavender's bed. She slowly pushed Lavender down on the end of the bed, and Lavender crawled backwards up to her pillows. Ivy cat crawled up to her, smirked, and with a flick of her wand, the curtains around them shut. She stared at the beautiful flushed girl beneath her and leaned down to kiss her hard.
Draco didn't stop until the skin was purple and bruised. Then he moved lower and lower down Harry's body, licking his skin, or placing gentle kisses on each and every curve until he reached the ridge of Harry's hipbone. Looking down the length of his own body, Harry took in the huge raw bruise on his chest with satisfaction, before his eyes met Draco's staring up at him, and saw his lips hovering the tiniest fraction above the angular joint.
"Yeah, sorry," Harry says slowly as he bites his lip and thinks of something to say. He needs an excuse, and a good one. "I just... have the runs."
"HARRY, DRACO!" someone shouted from the crowd. They both turned their heads and blushed, realizing their conversation was heard. "Your microphones...you're still holding them."
"I like showing them to you," Draco said quietly with a smile at Harry. He stopped at the unlit wall torch and pushed it down. The wall opened like double doors; the opened bookshelf came into view. Both boys quickly exited the tunnel and entered the library.
Draco raised an eyebrow, not knowing if he should be angry at Harry for regarding him as a Gryffindor or impressed with him for using his Slytherin side to work things out with others if he was in that situation. "I was a little too anxious about them telling the outside world than to make a deal with the second year I nearly hexed."
"Neville?" Harry and Dean stared at their dormmate in shock. How did he even get inside anyway? Only people who participated in the prank were informed of the Masquerade ball.
Harry sighed, not believing Dumbledore would ever let him over at Malfoy Manor. He has a good reason not to and it's the name of Lucius Malfoy. "He would probably laugh in our faces if we asked him if I could stay over at Malfoy Manor. He probably thinks there will be Death Eaters coming in and out of your manor."
"So... what now?" asked Draco who was looking around for oncoming students. There weren't any so he looked back at the portrait, a little confused about why they're here. But then Harry winked at him, and of course, he blushed and watched Harry as he began tickling the pear situated in the fruit bowl. The portrait swung open to reveal a passageway that led to the kitchens. Harry, followed by Ivy, followed by Draco walked through the passageway into the kitchen.
Harry didn’t reply, holding his wand above Draco, he began running as many tests as he could remember, struggling to figure out what was wrong with him.
“It’s an hour's walk this way,” Hermione announced as soon as Astoria, Ginny, and Harry appeared. “We can’t fly, too risky. They might detect us coming. We will have to go on foot.”
“I promise to...” Harry took a deep breath, blinking tears from his eyes and tightening his grip on Draco’s hands. “I promise to love you forever and always. No matter what happens, you will always be my Soulmate.”
Draco pushed again, stronger this time, nearly managing to force Harry off of him. For a few seconds, Harry was forced to stop casting, struggling to maintain his balance and push Draco back down. In those moments, the darkness began to encase Draco again and he felt his panic increase.
Slowly, the world around Draco started to become more clear. He was immediately aware that his body felt heavy as if gravity had become too powerful and was holding him down. As his vision returned, he saw Harry, crouching over him, casting spell after spell, a deep crease in his brow as he worked.
“Yes,” Draco replied without hesitation, a light pink blush forming on his cheeks. “Do you still love me?”
When Draco was ten he realized that his Counterpart was not a she, but a he. Thoughts about sex and the lackluster explanation his awful family had given him began appearing. His “talk” was not nearly as in-depth as the talk Draco had received. At times, Draco found himself laughing at his Counterpart’s innocence.
“I suspect it will only get worse for a while,” he admitted.  “Unpack. Their closet should expand for your clothes to fit automatically. When you’re done, we can go get some lunch.”
The contents of the new bottle of firewhisky began to disappear quickly. Soon Harry found himself in a slightly more comfortable boozy haze. It became difficult to focus on anything, let alone the fact that Draco still hadn’t responded.
“We’re divorced,” Harry muttered, tossing the letter aside and taking a large gulp of the firewhisky. “Guess you don’t read Rita’s columns anymore.”
With a flick of his wand, Harry summoned his phone to check his messages. As expected, there were a few worried messages from Ron and Hermione, but there was also a message from a number he didn’t recognize that said only “Hello, Harry.”
Almost immediately, Harry felt the pain in his head begin to fade and the fog that had been surrounding him began to clear.
Suddenly, a familiar, prideful looking eagle owl landed in front of him with a letter in his claw. The owl was undoubtedly Dracos, though significantly older than when Harry last saw him.
Harry grabbed Draco’s face in his hands, pulling him close for a passionate, but appropriate, kiss. Draco’s arms wrapped around Harry’s waist and kissed him back, oblivious to the cheering audience beside them.
“What would be wrong with that?” Harry asked, the crease on his forehead twisting into a full-out frown. “I like my apartment.”
The camera continued to follow her as she walked up to Draco and his mother who stared somberly at the reporter.
Harry kissed back, struggling to keep still. He wanted to move his hands behind his back to help resist the urge to reach out and touch Draco, but he was concerned even that movement would break the moment.
“It’s his house,” he said, gesturing to Draco with his head. “And his seemingly infinite family fortune. You’re an adult with a job now.  Don’t look to me for approval.”
As much as Harry valued his alone time, he was grateful that he would have someone to at least somewhat keep him sane with all that was happening. As soon as the apartment was clean and all bloodstains from last night’s mishap were removed, he got dressed and texted Teddy that he would be there in ten minutes.
“I wouldn’t hate it,” he replied. “I’d have to find some hobbies to occupy myself while the kids are at school, but ultimately I think I would enjoy it. As it is now, I barely have any time with them. I’ve had to work longer hours at the ministry to pay for my apartment and help Ginny make mortgage on our old house. I don’t hold any animosity towards her or the fact I pay her a boatload of alimony. I know it would be less if I’d just let her work like she wanted to in the first place.”
He put his phone aside, ignoring the buzzes that followed and choosing instead to listen to the rain. He focused on the sound, using it to drown out all the worries and fears that were currently threatening to tear him apart.
“This is probably as good of an opportunity as ever to discuss strategy,” said Harry. “Astoria, is there any magical field, in particular, you excel at?”
Harry reclined his seat, closing his eyes as he listened to the pitter-patter of rain hitting the roof of his car. The sound brought him a sense of peace that he wasn’t sure he’d be able to achieve otherwise. His phone buzzed.
“Up until just a day ago, Lucious Malfoy was alive within these walls,” she began. “I’m here with Lucius’s surviving family, his son, Draco, and his ex-wife Narcissa Black.”
“Draco, what good is there? Besides the past couple of weeks of course. You were tortured there. Hermione was tortured there. I was nearly found and killed. Why would you want to stay?”
Harry woke up to a pesky scratching sound and groaned as he was hit with the full force of his headache.
“Harry,” Astoria’s voice came to his ears again. “Keep him alive. Teddy’s going to grab an antidote.”
“I’m not surprised,” Narcissa replied, a small smile playing on her lips. It was never there when Lucius was around. Draco wished his mother would smile more often.
“Harry,” Draco said, looking over to meet his eyes. “I think you should go back to your apartment for the night.”
Albus and James’s room consisted of two twin-sized beds, one with Slytherin sheets, the other with red and gold sheets.
They stared at each other, remembering the days they spent here, good and bad. The world had felt so scary then, their love so forbidden. Neither of them could have truly imagined they would someday stand as they did now, before all their loved ones, in a peaceful world, ready to declare their undying love.
“I was far from the only one who fought in that war,” he reminded him. “You have your parents to thank as well.”
D: Sorry if I’m being too pushy. If you really don’t want to talk to me, just tell me and I’ll leave you alone.
For once, he didn’t listen to her. Instead, he turned his head to look at Harry who sat beside him, that same crease of worry still embedded in his brow.
“Fuck!” Harry exclaimed, crumpling and throwing this letter away as well. He looked up as the owl flew into the room and glanced at the crumpled pieces of paper on the floor. He cocked his head to the side for a minute, eyeing them. Harry quickly leaned down, trying to grab the paper as he realized what the owl was thinking, but he was too late. The owl reached out a claw and grabbed one of the letters, flying out the window as Harry screamed after him to stop.
Harry sighed and reread the message a few times, considering his options. He glanced at the firewhisky which felt like the best option at the moment.
As soon as Harry pulled up the driveway, Draco wordlessly got out of the car and walked into his home. A few minutes after the door shut behind him, it began to rain. A few raindrops hit Harry’s windshield followed by more and more until he was surrounded by a steady downpour.
“Draco,” Harry said, under his breath, praying his Soulmate could hear him. “When I get home, I am never letting you out of my sight again.”
“It would certainly appear that way,” Harry commented. “I should have known immediately that something was wrong with her, but unfortunately I’d been drinking.”
Draco figured it out quickly after that. The thoughts on his arm often complained about being the boy who lived and getting so much attention. What did I do to deserve this? Maybe they have the wrong person. I’m nothing. He tried hard to keep his thoughts kind, almost hoping Harry would never figure out it was him.
When Harry arrived, Teddy was waiting in the driveway with his bags. They hugged and loaded up his stuff silently before driving off.
“You can stay in the boys’ room,” Harry instructed as they walked through the door with Teddy’s belongings.
Strictly speaking, aurors weren’t supposed to use enchanted quills to fill out paperwork as it increased the odds of something being filled out inaccurately. However, only brand new aurors were stupid enough to follow that rule and Harry had been working with the ministry for nearly 20 years.
Harry interlaced their fingers and suddenly became aware of something hard on Draco’s finger. He pulled their hands up to eye level and saw that Draco was now wearing the ring on his right ring finger. Harry’s blush deepended.
Suddenly, Draco glanced over at the glass that was separating them. It should appear to him as impossible to see through, but Harry could swear that for a moment they locked eyes. Seeing Draco’s silvery eyes staring back at him reawakened butterflies in Harry's stomach that he thought had died off years ago.
Of course, it seemed like the only things that were playing were romances or horrible news. Harry stopped as he landed on one of the wizard only news channels.
“It’s my specialty,” Astoria confirmed. “Not all of us had invisibility cloaks to sneak around under when we wanted to meet up with our Soulmate from another house.”
Harry quickly cast a charm so the glass was clear for him but frosted white for anyone on the outside. Perhaps Hermione and Draco hadn’t realized Harry would already be back to work. Or maybe Draco was trying to torture him or remind him to answer the damn text message. Harry knew in the back of his mind that the most likely reason Draco was currently walking past his office was that he no longer had to avoid Harry and this was the quickest route to his destination.
“It ultimately boiled down to us not being compatible long term,” Harry explained. “We just had different ideas on what it takes to raise a family; what was worth sacrificing and what wasn’t. I mentioned earlier how we had different ideas on how much privacy our children should have. I also firmly believed that at least one of us should be a stay at home parent. It ended up being her because none of the things she was interested in doing for work would generate enough money for me to be able to quit. In hindsight, it wasn’t fair of me to make her give up her passions. I just couldn’t understand how she would want anything other than to stay home with the kids.”
“When I lost Alea, I would have done anything to get her back,” she said quietly after a few minutes. “I fucking tried, too. I started studying necromancy. I joined a bullshit satanic cult that claimed to be able to raise the dead. The only reason I joined that damn plant studying group was because I heard there was an herb that let you
Scorpius told me Albus was sorted into Slytherin. You don’t need to worry about your son being in any danger, Scorpius will take care of him. Not that Albus really needs it. Scorpius told me he was already pretty good at fighting for himself.
Harry tossed the letter aside and opened the pouch Draco had sent him to find more of the same hangover cure pills. He summoned a glass of water and downed the first one, tucking the second in his pocket.
“I might have been a little sad,” he admitted. “But ultimately I wouldn’t have cared. It’s certainly easier on him at family reunions since he’s Slytherin. It also wasn’t much of a question, though. He was always very ambitious even as a child. What about you? Are you sad you only have one Gryffindor child?”
Harry rolled his eyes and flicked his wand to open the window. The owl landed on the windowsill and held out one claw containing another letter and a small pouch.
T: ron told me what happened last night. If u want to spend time recovering and arent ready for me to move in yet ill understand
“Astoria,” Teddy said behind him. “Something’s wrong with Draco. I don’t know what happened. Everything was fine but then...” he broke off, listening. Quickly, he ran into the potion lab and began searching.
“Probably Albus’s,” Harry replied, his hand dropping back to his side. “James has been weird about people using his stuff ever since he turned 14.”
Draco stared at the train tracks in front of him, offering his mother half-hearted smiles when she glanced at him. At any moment, he would be boarding the train and potentially meeting his Counterpart. He caught the stern eye of his father for a moment and quickly rolled down his sleeve, resolving not to look at it until he arrived at Hogwarts.
Harry had seen these thoughts pop up multiple times, but the first time Draco saw it, he was 11 and preparing to go to Hogwarts. His excitement at meeting his Counterpart had slowly waned as he watched him learn about the wizarding world for the first time. For years he’d tried to convince himself that his Counterpart was just a pureblood wizard who thought primarily of muggle things, but this past week had proven beyond a doubt that his Counterpart was most likely a mudblood.
“I don’t know,” he admitted, his thumb drawing circles on the back of Harry’s hand. “I guess so. I mean, you’ve basically already moved in. I guess I thought you just... wouldn’t leave.”
“Technically no,” Klerig admitted, standing back up and crossing her arms over her chest. “But they were content terrorizing muggle-born children. Now they’re coming after you.”
“I don’t want to live in your mansion,” he said. “You could put up all the paintings in the world, I really don’t want to live there.”
“You’ve always been fascinated with the male anatomy,” his mother teased. “Now go instruct a house-elf to make your father’s favorite meal tonight and never breathe a word of this conversation to him.”
“To Teddy,” Draco interrupted with a smirk. “The future humblest, best wand-maker in all the universe.”
“To this day it’s a weird sight for me,” he admitted. “When I was growing up, family members being sorted into different houses was more of a big deal.”
“Like I said,” Harry replied. “I had a rough night. I’ll be at the ministry in,” Harry stopped to check the time again. “10 minutes.”
“Mum, I think I’m gay,” Draco announced one day after scouring every inch of the house for the detection charms his father often left behind.
The summoning charm Harry threw seemed to bounce off the owl completely. Harry watched helplessly as one of the terrible letters flew away towards Draco. Quickly, he unfolded the two letters remaining and groaned. Of course, the owl had taken the first one.
A few minutes later, his phone buzzed in the corner. A silent flick of the wand had it flying into Harry’s hand.
When Harry was certain his Soulmate was safe again, he would focus all his energy on sending her happy thoughts in a desperate attempt to make her feel better. He never knew for sure if it was working, but when he looked back at his tattoo, she seemed to have calmed down.
“Why would you even ask a question like that?” Draco asked.”You know you’ll just get jealous if i tell you I did.”
Once they reached the end of the aisle, she stood on her toes to give him a kiss on the cheek and moved to sit with Arthur in a nearby chair.
Draco examined Harry’s face carefully. He saw no sign of the Harry that had tortured him. The man he was looking at now seemed capable of only kindness. Draco felt a small sense of peace wash over him. Slowly, he leaned forward to press his lips against Harry’s.
“Should we split up when we get there?” Ron asked. “It may be better to have multiple points of attack.”
Draco pulled back to look at Harry’s face again. Harry opened his eyes and looked back at Draco, his cheeks rosy.
“All I’m saying is that you could be providing them with more,” Draco explained. “I’m sure your apartment is the best you can do, but imagine how much more space they can have in my home.”
With that, Klerig walked out of the room without waiting for a response. Harry’s eyes landed on the stack of papers that had been delivered to his office before he arrived that morning. Sighing, he pulled out his enchanted quill which immediately got to work filling out all the easy details like his name and personal details.
Draco looked at Harry and started to speak but his face froze, his smile shifting down to an open gape and his eyes glazing over with a distant stare. Harry quickly twisted to look in the direction of Draco’s gaze, but saw nothing, turning back just in time to see Draco slumping down out of his chair.
“We use all of the space,” Draco reminded him. “There’s a house-elf in almost every room and there will be more coming as soon as you clear me to start bringing more back in.”
“Harry,” Teddy said, eyes still glued to his Soulmate tattoo. “Something’s wrong. Victoire isn’t thinking anything.”
Suddenly, Harry’s phone began to buzz. It wasn’t the single buzz of a text message however, it was the persistent sound of an incoming call. Harry flipped the phone screen up and stared in shock as Draco’s number, which he still hadn’t saved in his contacts, stared back at him.
Harry almost confessed who his Soulmate was to Hermione and Ron on multiple occasions, but always stopped himself. They’d spoken about Soulmates on a few occasions, but for the most part, Hermione and Ron seemed just as content to avoid the topic as Harry was.
“You can drive me home,” he relented. “But you can’t stay. I want to talk to Astoria about you and I don’t want you listening.”
Harry disappeared from his vision and his weight disappeared from his body. He felt something touch his lips and pour into his mouth and he swallowed instinctively.
“Yeah, whatever,” Hermione replied, walking with him back towards their usual section of the building. “So what happened last night?”
I was sorry to read that you and Ginny divorced. I must have seemed like an ass yesterday inviting you both to dinner. I must apologize, I haven’t kept up with the news of our classmates very well.
“Fuck,” he muttered, realizing he felt as if he’d been living in a desert for weeks. Sleepily, he waved his wand in an attempt to summon some water, but all he accomplished was summoning an empty glass.
“We have to save energy,” Hermione pointed out. “We don’t know what we will be facing when we get there.”
PS: I wanted to use a different font for Draco's letter or upload an image for it, but I couldn't get it to work. If anyone has more formatting knowledge than me and wants to give me a hand it would be greatly appreciated.
Harry arrived at the ministry in precisely ten minutes and found Hermione within the next two. She glared at him but said nothing as they walked into the conference room. Luckily, despite being five minutes late, they had somehow managed to be the first to arrive. The rest of the group arrived a few minutes later.
“I am too,” Harry said, squeezing his hand lightly. “I guess if we’re going to be together again, we should get to know each other.”
“Doesn’t matter,” she snapped. “You’ll have plenty of time to get your beauty rest when you’re done acting like a child.”
Harry groaned, downed the rest of his firewhisky, and stumbled to the bedroom, flicking his wand to turn off the tv as he walked.
“Then maybe I should be fighting to have hippogryph ownership banned completely,” Hermione replied walking into view outside of Harry’s office.
The camera cut to a young woman walking around the outside of what Harry recognized as the Malfoy manor.
“I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks,” Harry replied, turning away and returning his focus to his new friends.
D: Sorry if I’m being too pushy. If you really don’t want to talk to me, just tell me and I’ll leave you alone.
“I assure you, Harry, I would be just as fucked up by my parents if I’d been raised in a hut rather than the manor. The home has very little to do with anything beyond comfort.”
“God forbid James and Albus learn to share,” Harry replied, his frustration getting the better of him as he pulled his hand away from Draco’s. “I’m sure Scorpius is just as spoiled as you were when you started Hogwarts.”
As soon as Harry saw Draco, all his nerves washed away. The people around him, the wedding arch behind him, all vanished. He saw the man he’d fallen so deeply in love with, so many years ago at this very spot, walking towards him and he smiled.
“So this anti-gossip charm,” Harry began as he followed Draco out of the dining room and away from the very awkward lunch. “It works everywhere?”
Hey guys, thanks for reading! This being basically the end of the Harry Does Drugs story arc, I wanted to write a brief PSA. A majority of the time, drug addictions and depression cannot be fixed by finding love. Harry's case was a bit special since the thing that sent him into a depressed drug spiral in the first place was losing Draco. If you struggle with a drug problem or depression, it's important not to expect finding love to be the cure-all for your struggles.
“Do you think they’d be embarrassed of me?” he asked. “I’ve been out of school for nearly two years with no direction.”
Despite what he’d said, Harry felt a pang of jealousy well up inside him at the thought of Draco being with other men, but he suppressed it.
“Guess the fucker told you not to leave without a response,” Harry grumbled, sipping on his firewhisky and attempting to search for a pen and paper. “For a guy who was s’posedly brought up in high-fucking-society, he sure is rude. It’s rude, you know,” he said, turning to face the owl directly and holding out one finger accusingly. “To barge your way into someone’s house like that. Real fucked up. This is
“We do not call them by their preferred name” Klerig reminded him sternly. “They are not true Death Eaters. They are merely copy-cats who have a hardon for a war they were barely alive for.”
“He should only be able to hear the things he’s meant to hear,” Ron replied. “Part of why it embeds so deeply inside your head is so that it can deduce your intentions.”
“Potter, your stubbornness will be the death of you,” Klerig commented, shaking her head. “Just keep an eye out. The blood-sucker admitted to being part of the cult and she said there would be more coming. And please, for the love of all that is good, get your damn paperwork filled out on time for once.”
They tuned him out, the words already familiar to them. All that existed at that moment was each other. Harry’s thumb rubbed the back of one of Draco’s hands comfortingly. Draco smiled, resisting the urge to pull Harry in for a premature kiss.
“All worked out?” Hermione repeated, practically glowing. “Not only did we manage to convince them that house-elves deserve protection by aurors as much as wizards, but they’re going to hire more aurors to help cover the increased demand! I honestly thought you were going to stumble in here drunk or hungover and make a fool out of us both after this morning. Thank you so much.”
Thank you for reading all the way to the end! As always all comments are welcome. I would love to hear your thoughts on this fic whether good or bad or completely neutral. :)
Harry saw the mansion looming before them and pulled the car onto the side of the road. Silently, he put the car in park and turned to face Draco.
“Fuck you,” he muttered as he stripped down to his underwear and plopped on the bed, passing out almost immediately.
Clarity started returning, but with it the panic only grew. For a moment, Draco returned to that terrible, damp place where he’d been kept for weeks being torn open again and again by men with his lover’s face.
“Your godfather went through some dark times at Hogwarts,” Draco tried to explain. “The school didn’t provide him the help he needed and instead chose to medicate him.”
“That’s up to her,” Draco pointed out. “I haven’t talked to her about whether she’s ok with me moving out or not because I figured it wouldn’t matter. I mean, come on, Harry, what did you expect? For me to move into your apartment?”
It was a proven fact that the tattoos translated all thoughts except ones about the Soulmate in question until they met. This phenomenon prohibited the Soulmates from truly communicating until they met each other.
I would love to have dinner with you. Preferably without your wife. In fact, why don’t we just skip dinner and get right to fucking around like old times? I can honestly say I’ve missed the sex even if I haven’t missed the constant second guessing and whiplash that came with our romance
Harry woke with a jolt at the sound of someone opening the passenger side door. Before he’d even registered the situation, he drew his wand and prepared to cast at whoever he saw.
“Thank you,” he said to the house-elf. “Now please, I know Astoria will kill me if I don’t insist you join her and Victoire and the rest of the house-elves for your welcome party.”
“I bet you’ll be able to afford this stuff someday,” Harry commented. “Wand making can be very lucrative.”
Harry squeezed his eyes shut for a moment and took a deep breath before opening them and looking at Teddy.
"Why do I have a feeling I will be dressed up like a doll on this trip?" Harry asked trying not to roll his eyes.
Harry felt a jolt of pain as his arm was tugged, pulling him up. He was dragged up the stairs and into the master bedroom. Vernon threw Harry on the bed and locked the door. grabbing a box from under the bed Vernon began to smile. Harry began to panic. What was going to happen to him? Vernon opened the box and removed a pair of handcuffs. Vernon flipped the boy onto his front. Ripping the boy’s shirt from him, he cand cuffed one of his arms to the bed. He walked back to the box and retrieved another pair. Harry's other wrist was cuffed to the bed and he began to panic. He felt his uncle remove his underwear and cuff one of his legs to the bed. Grabbing the other set of cuffs, Vernon finished what he was doing.
“Are you okay?” the nurse asked, looking worriedly at the girl on the bed. She nodded and the man continued. “What is your name miss?”
Harry was fine being alone in the darkness of his cupboard, it gave him some time to think about what he had heard. He didn’t have time to ask about his appearance change. Now that he thought about it, the Dursley’s hadn’t said anything about it to him. Harry ran his hand through his hair, only to find it back to its original length. This was weird, he needed to know what was going on. Who was his dad and why wouldn’t they tell him anything else? Whose memories was he supposed to see?
“Mrs Dursley,” she said politely, “both boys have passed the exam, Dudley just passed, only a few marks over. Harry has almost full marks and has earned a scholarship. Please choose which boy is going where and buy them everything on this list. Both boys are required to have everything, or both of their places could be taken.” She handed Petunia a list before continuing. “Congratulation’s boys. I must leave you; I have a meeting in ten minutes.” Bidding the trio farewell, she turned and walked into her office, closing the door as she went.
The first Saturday of the school year Harry was sat under a tree trying to learn some more French. He was taught everyday after school the last year and had approved massively. He was almost fluent. His other school had worked hard on teaching him the language so he could communicate with his peers.
There are themes of sexual assault in this chapter. Trigger warnings are placed beforehand. This is the final part of the chapter, so if you wish to skip it is easy to do so.
“You had quite a nasty fall there. You hit your head. From what we can tell the blindness is only temporary. We will let you go when it has lifted. Ok?” Harry nodded, and the doctor continued to speak. “You were found in the town with no ID three days ago. Your dog was with you and wouldn’t leave. We do need to know your name though, Miss?” Harry stopped; the doctor apparently saw this as wanting to be alone and left the teen on in the room.
Harry tugged on the cuffs holding him in place. Vernon laughed. The boy heard a zip and fabric falling to the floor before feeling an excruciating pain run through his body. Choking back a sob Harry could hear moans coming from behind him. It felt like the pain would never end. He heard a guttural moan and felt the pain intensify. Vernon removed himself from the boy and left the room. He returned that evening to continue what he was doing.
Harry nodded and followed Morfran and Nauny out of the house. They took him to a small apartment on the outskirts of Little Whinging and let him view the memories, they left to go into the kitchen to give him some space.
Once she got off the phone to the Academy, Petunia turned to her husband. Once he had turned the volume down on the television, she began to speak.
As it turned out, no one left or entered the common room until 6am the next morning, which is when a poor 7th year left to go to breakfast, only to be met with the sight of a black jaguar waiting to get in. the seventh year girl, whose name Harry didn't know, screamed so loudly, he would be surprised if anyone in Slytherin was still asleep. Walking into the common room and up to the 6th year boy's dorm, Harry, surprisingly, didn't meet another person. When he entered the 6th year boy's dorm however he was met with laughter, when he looked it was to see that Draco was sat on the floor, apparently fallen out of bed, glaring at the other occupants of the room. Wearing a jumper that was much too big for him, shorts and thigh high socks, pared with bedhead that was about as bad as Harry's, it ruined the usually perfect picture that he showed the rest of the world. The glare was lost on the boys as the image was just too funny. In fact, Blaze Zabini, Draco's best friend, had a camera out and was taking pictures, he took one of those pictures and, with a semi-permanent (only the one who applies it can remove it) sticking charm, stuck all 15 above Hunter's are saying as he did so, "There now you are the proud owner of the only pictures of the Draco Malfoy with, a) his hair all messed up, and, b) in his not-so-Malfoyish pyjamas." Harry did admit to himself that when he first saw Draco in his pyjamas he could have burst out laughing, it was even worse in the morning when he threatened Harry if he ever said anything to anyone he would "Not by you a new toy for a month."
This was the last day of the summer. He was in high spirits at the thought of going back to school. This fact did not go unnoticed by his uncle who decided to beat the spark from his eyes. Harry was only able to go to bed an hour before he needed to get ready for school. Petunia knocked on his door at 6:30 when the young boy emerged the woman gasped. Her hand going to her mouth. Pressing her lips together she nodded to the chair in front of her. Once Harry sat down, she began applying makeup to his face. It took two hours but finally, he looked as though he was as healthy as could be.
Joslyn walked over to where the owl sat, on the dining room table and looked at the package. The owl hooted again and looked towards the pantry cupboards.
"It's not my loss if I don't want to date rude people," Harry spat back at him. what's wrong with this muggle? Is he that deranged that he can't tell who's taken or not?
Harry really was smiling the brightest he's ever had. He believes it's because of Draco, how the other bloke makes his heart skip a beat every time that voice goes the next note up. When he met Ron and Hermione, he never smiled as bright as he had then. He really wants this man in his life now.
Joslyn chuckled at his British accent, then frowned because this really is a bad situation. This is Bad, she thought while hesitating, and trying to look for her actual ferret but he was nowhere to be seen except for the nude boy staring in front of her. She squats down and grabbed a pair of blue boxer's her mom gave to her a while ago for some reason. "Here." She paused, looked away from him and chucked the blue boxers at him. "Put these on, please."
A series of 'Novis' was said from around the room which piglets were then being transformed back into cages. Except for one, Lavender refused to turn it back into a pig. "But Professor," she said sadly and cuddling the piglet to her chest. "I want to give it a life, it deserves to be loved!"
After putting the mattress on the wardrobe and making the bed, the horse-faced woman hurriedly placed the waking infant on the cupboard. Stepping back, she heard her own child begin to cry. Shutting the door, she turned to tend to her own child. She held her child close as she carried him down the stairs and into the kitchen. Sitting at the table she began to feed him.
After telling Vernon, she awaited the backlash, but it never came. All he said was, “If you can bur the damn thing yourself and care for it, I don’t care.” She had been shocked by the response. Sitting in her bed that night she had an idea.
"I went for a walk and somehow ended up at Hunter's Woodland Park, and-" he was cut off abruptly by Hermione.
She jumped out of bed and ran into the dining room. Her parents were already there. Lucius raised an eyebrow at his daughter. She had come down in a grump for days. She smiled at her father and sat down at the table.
"I was captured while in my animagus form by hunters and ended up here. There is no specific reason for why I am here."
They were currently at the airport waiting for the Dursleys to pick him up. When they spotted them, Harry was ushered toward them. When they got there, his teacher took Vernon to the side and told him what happened.
Harry turned pack into himself and looked at the new people to know. Pansy was the first to speak up, "I thought you were training in America."
Vivienne awoke with a start, looking at her surroundings trying to figure out why. Leaning back against her pillows, she quickly realised she would be unable to sleep. When she was dressed, she tried to push against the door. Finding it locked, she slumped back on the bed.
The conversation continued in the same way for roughly an hour, when Ginny came into their compartment. “Hey, Imogen.” Ginny turned to Hadrian in shock.
“Yes, it’s quite simple, but I would wait until we’re all ready to let Dumbledore know that we know… Unless you want to just rebel from the first day back.” At their nods Hadrian cast the spell. Hermione’s brown hair darkened to black and as her eyes became a deep brown her features also sharpened. Lisa’s eyes darkened to match her sisters as their faces became almost identical. They looked so much like their little brother. Ginny’s brown eyes turned back to a brilliant green and her fiery red hair became even fierier but otherwise she remained unchanged. Emily changed to look almost the same as Luna, besides being a little taller. Hadrian looked around to see if there were any other questions. Seeing as there weren’t, and there was still half an hour to go, they split into families.
Was all harry could think. He turned around and saw two other animals. A horse and a dog. The three sea creatures somehow living in the lake brought their heads out to the surface. That's when he heard it. A voice in his head saying, "Who are you?"
Three hours later, Harry had completed half the chores on the list. He went into the kitchen to get his small meal. Unfortunately for him, the other half of the chores he had to complete were much more difficult than just vacuuming, or watering the garden, as his Cousin was not a tidy person. Harry reluctantly went upstairs and into his cousin’s bedroom.
That is why it came as such a surprise when he heard the locks go on the door, he knew that it was the morning, as he had only heard his Cousin come down the stairs about an hour ago, so why was she unlocking the door.
Ron's Familiar was a husky, "This is Lila, she's a husky, she has two sisters in the school, and they belong to Ginny and Luna."
“I’ve found him!” He yelled and helped Harry out of his cupboard. “We have the memories for you to view.” Morfran wisely left out asking his grandson what had happened, sensing that it was still too fresh.
the stream of water hit Neville right on his face. Harry laughed as he sat bolt upright and gave Harry a death glare. "Care to help me wake up the others?" Harry asked after he had finished laughing.
He looked at the child in disgust. Attempting to keep his anger in check, he stormed out of the room. Walking into the kitchen he told Petunia to find a place for “That Freakish Boy” to sleep.
“Mr. Potter?” The woman asked, when he nodded, she continued. “My name is Nauny, and this is my husband Morfran.”
"Now on at a time starting with the 7th years, come up and introduce your familiar and a bit about the animal they are, if they have a relative in the school, let us know so we can arrange for them to have some time with their family. Professor McGonagall could you begin to call up the students."
"Yea I'm fine, I'm just going to get an early night." he replied before standing and walking towards the dorms. It took until he was ready for, and in, bed before the fact that Harry and Hunter were in fact the same… person to sink in. When Hunter,
"I know. It's just I was… distracted?" Harry replied before carrying on with his tale, "And transformed I didn't realise that there were hunters in there and when I heard one it was too late."
Glancing over at the boy, Vernon replied, ‘I’ll talk to my wife.’ He walked over to his family and took them to his car, not giving the woman the chance to respond.
All that Draco could feel was pain. He didn’t know what was wrong with him. He could hear someone screaming nearby. The pain slowly subsided and he could finally sleep again.
Amaia, Ashley and Aiden all went and talked closest to the window. Imogen, Draco, Ron and Neville decided that seeing that none of them technically had any siblings here they would talk towards the centre of the compartment, giving the other families some space. The end closest to the door was taken by Hadrian, Eleanora and Luna.
They told him to get into the car and, without even looking at him, drove off to Number 4 Privet Drive. Harry was coming up with a plan in his head, he knew now that they wouldn’t let him leave in a hurry. He was hoping to just go to his room and get his wand, he would leave at night when it’s dark and take the Knight Bus.
Once he had finished the passages that he needed, he moved to sit on the floor. Pulling his wand from his bag, he practiced the spells. The first one was a privacy spell. It would ensure that no one heard him when he had his nightmares. The second was a glamour spell. It was more complicated but required. He was currently using some makeup he had bought in Diagon Alley to cover his scars and bruises. Luckily for him, Hagrid wasn’t too observant. It took him all night, but he finally got the spell. Looking at the clock on the mantel, he saw that it was almost 5 am. Creeping back into his dorm room he went to his bed. It was Monday today and he would be heading to class in the morning.
Harry, however, was terrified of what his uncle would do to him. But nothing could have prepared him for what did. His uncle ordered him to strip and lie down on his front on the bed. Harry was visibly shaking now. Without warning his uncle thrust into him, telling him that he was a slut and that this was all he was good for, and to Harry it felt as if his soul was being ripped to shreds, slowly and agonizingly, and no matter his screaming his uncle wouldn't stop, he would just slap him so hard on the back of his head that he saw stars, but didn't pass out, and tell him to shut up. The feel of his uncles large body on his much smaller frame, mixed with the sound of his loud moans and heavy breathing made him feel sick. After his uncle had finished with him he beat him so that he could barely walk, let alone do chores and forced him into his cupboard.
Vernon’s face was going red. “WHAT!” taking a deep breath in an attempt to calm down, he made a mental reminder to find a way to control his anger. “I am not paying for that freak to go to a private school.”
Harry hated shopping. And yet here he was Draco pulling him around Diagon Alley getting charms for the collar and Draco's bracelet, and now Draco was getting some new dress robes. So Harry decided to have a nap. His dreams were plagued with images of his summer. All the horrible things that had happened to him, and Sirius' death. He woke up whimpering, with Draco checking if he were okay.
birthday that his life began to change. Making a quick decision he decided that his uncle was correct. He should hide the truth.
Shaking her head to dispel her thoughts, Petunia nodded her head. She went to the attic and walked to the back. In front of her, under a bedsheet, sat her sisters’ old bed. Collecting the mattress, Petunia walked back down the stairs. She placed it on the sofa and walked back into the attic. Next to the crib was a chest full of bedding. She picked out some single bedding and made her way down the stairs, turning off the light as she went.
An hour later, Nauny and Morfran took their leave. It was a good thing that they did, as the Dursley’s returned not 5 minutes later. Nauny had used her magic to do all his chores, so he wouldn’t have to rush, and he’d have time to process everything he’d been told. When the Dursley’s returned they sent him to his cupboard without food.
Harry glanced at his watch before quickly telling Sav the time. They had 20 minutes to get onto the train. He rushed up into his room grabbed a roll of parchment and wrote a note to his aunt.
It had been six days since Harry and Sav had been going to the headmaster's office when she yelled triumphantly, "Found it! It's the
When his uncle had entered the room, it was clear he was furious. His face was turning red, and his fists were clenched. It was only 6 in the morning and his uncle had been asleep. The man rarely rose before eight. He was still in his pyjamas and was looking for the culprit. Turning his beady eyes on the boy he began to yell. Before either of them knew what he was doing, he had his right hand raised and he struck the boy across the face.
The hospital had called her uncle to come and pick her up. When they got to Privet Drive. The teen was locked in the cupboard and the dog outside.
“We had three names that we were going to choose between.” She explained, stepping into the room when the door was held open for her. “Theodora, Cassiopeia and Theophania”
“The veil didn’t kill me, it just sent me back an hour in time. I awoke after I had fallen through the veil, but I couldn’t just walk up to you.” The man responded. “I saw your uncle drop you off and noticed your scar. I thought you were just a random girl at first. I called an ambulance and was Padfoot by the time they got there.” He explained rapidly. “Your mother wanted to call you Vivienne.” He said quietly. It took Harry a second to realise when he meant. The name. Right. She smiled at her godfather before hearing the door open. His vision had started to return in the time the doctor was gone.
Twenty minutes later, Hadrian and Draco were in their new lounge decorating. Once they were done, the room was now arrayed in blues and browns. A sofa and two armchairs surrounded a coffee table in the centre. Four doors lead away the lounge. One was to a dining room and another, the kitchen, which had an island that you could sit at in the centre. Both rooms were done in light coloured woods, which they both liked so decided to leave them as they were. Through the other doors there were two bedrooms. Both contained a king sized four poster bed, a large closet, and two, three drawer bedside tables. The boys did their own rooms in neutral colours. Keeping the rooms to their own unique styles.
“Nauny and Morfran, my grandparents, Neva’s parents, gave them to me.” He explained before looking around. Everyone seemed to be both in shock and lost in thought. “What time is it?” he asked Amaia.
When he got to the airport, he was greeted by a young teacher who immediately began talking to the other adult. After a few minutes, he was left alone. The man gave him a kind smile and took him to the nearest café to get a drink. While the young boy was sat at a table drinking his juice, the other walked to the counter and bought two pastries. When he returned, he placed one in front of the young boy, who looked up in surprise.
Nodding slowly, Draco took a deep breath and stood up. Bidding his parents goodbye. When he got to his room he flopped onto the bed. Turning onto his back, he threw his arm over his eyes and sighed deeply. Before he knew it, he had slipped off to sleep.
Before Draco could ask what they were doing, the three snakes, as long as they were going to get now, came out of the mouth of the statue. “Holy Fuck.” Was all the Veela could get out in his shocked state.
"It's about Harry, Albus he has not come into school." She said looking worried. Albus always knew that she cared for the boy, he just hoped that it would not get in the way of his plans.
When the door had shut behind them, some of the girls burst out giggling. The group went off to talk with Snape in order to show him the memories. They hoped to get a shared common room with their own private rooms attached, just to spite Dumbledore. When they got to the dungeons they looked at Draco, ready to ask him where his head of house would be. However, when they turned they saw Snape glaring at them with a sneer on his face.
Come September, both boys had everything they needed and were packed for their trips. The school just needed a name for who was going to France.
The day he was told he would be going to Japan for five months, was one of the happiest days of his short life. Even being told that it was a specialist school for “Freaks” like him couldn’t dampen his good mood.
“I learned when I was little,” He replied simply, not wanting to talk about his past, “Shall I make breakfast for Draco and Mr. Malfoy too?” Hadrian asked, successfully changing the topic of their conversation.
The effect was instant. Silence swept through the hall as everyone turned to look at them. When they began to move towards their tables the whispers broke out, Hadrian couldn’t even decipher what anyone was saying. It was all just a buzz of noise. Only when Dumbledore yelled for silence did they finally die down and come to a stop. “I want all of you to follow your Prefects back to your dormitories, except those who were late to the meal.” He said before gesturing to Hadrian to follow him into the room that he had gone into when his name had come out of the Goblet of Fire. He looked at his friends and family and nodded for them to follow him.
Harry had finally had enough. As the Dursley's went out to get something for Dudley, Harry finally managed to get out of his cupboard and out of the house. The horrors that lived there would forever haunt him. After that first time his uncle beat him and raped him every day for a week. Then it got worse. He still remembered that… conversation,
October 1981 saw a young boy orphaned. Crying in his crib, just wanting his mother to stand from the floor and hold him close. Oblivious to the world around him. He looked up with tears streaming down his face. He had heard something downstairs. Crying harder, he held his blanket close. Staring at the door, he saw a man turn the corner. The young boy didn’t know who he was, just that he was wearing dark things. The unknown man fell to the floor beside his mother, holding her close. Hearing another sound coming from downstairs, the man disappeared, leaving the child alone.
When the time came for him to return to Privet Drive, Harry began to feel uneasy. He didn’t know if it was because of the way the teachers were treating him, or it was because he knew something was wrong. Vernon had become far worse than he had ever been. He had been hitting Harry almost daily. It wasn’t until his last week there that he realised why.
It was a difficult task for Harry to seem unaffected by those words. 1 hour, he had been unconscious for two days, what was Dumbledore doing in that time. Harry growled at the headmaster and ran to the dungeons. When he got there he bumped into Draco making his way to the carriages. Draco grabbed Harry and pulled him into an empty classroom.
The teen sat on the bed and put her head in her hands. Of all the things she thought were going to happen last night this was not one of them. She knew it was possible, of course, but had never imagined it would happen to her. Veela were born the way they would be if they were human. It was only on their sixteenth birthday that they would change. She laughed lightly to herself. She figured that the compromise was that she looked like her mother.
It was currently 10 pm on June the fourth and the day before Draco’s sixteenth birthday. The Malfoys were sat around the fire talking. At midnight Draco would be coming into his creature inheritance. A house-elf popped into the room to bring the family tea. Draco knew that he was stalling. He knew that when he went to sleep, he would wake up different.
"Draco do be careful with your search for your mate at Hogwarts, and please don't scare them off." Lucius said laughing a little at the look on his sons face. Draco nodded raising from his seat and excusing himself to go to the library.
I am so sorry that this chapter is shorter than the others, and that it has taken so long to come out. I have just been really busy.
Harry then realised that he hadn't told his friends. A cold dread flooded through him as he waited for the occupants of the room to fall asleep. He came up with a plan in his head. He knew it was bad and with his luck would go terribly wrong, but he had to try.
"Okay, but how did you end up as Malfoy's familiar?" she asked, clearly locking the information in her mind for a later date.
Harry hadn’t eaten in over a week. He was starving. He hadn’t been let out of his cupboard since he was put in there, 37 days ago, as Dudley was still in school until yesterday. Aunt Petunia gave him a glass of water a day at midday, then locked it back up.
Vernon froze to the spot. Worried that the boy would retaliate and use that freakish magic of his against him. To his surprise, the boy just began to cry. Fat tears falling from his face. A smirk came to his face and he bellowed to the crying child to go to his cupboard.
Hadrian was aware of the arms surrounding him, but all he could think of was his time at the Dursley’s. All the memories were flashing through his mind.
At about midnight, though he couldn't be sure, he got up and began to make his way through the castle. Coming to a holt in front of the entrance to Gryffindor tower, he began to scratch at the frame. He scratched once and waited, twice, waiting he scratched a third and final time when the door swung open to reveal Hermione. Almost sighing in relief he walked through the entrance and came to a stop in front of the fire. He could have cried in relief when he saw that other than Ron sat on the overstuffed armchair the common room was empty. Looking at his friend's fearful faces as Hermione looked at his nametag Harry decided to turn back.
Neither Vernon nor Petunia had wanted their precious Dudley to be too far away from them and had made the obvious decision to send Harry away. The school had already covered the flights and just needed a name to go on the tickets. Petunia picked up the letter again, reading it aloud to her husband, “Someone from the school will meet you at the airport to collect him. I will be with them at the time, so you know who they are. So, all we must do is get him there. We’ll be rid of him for ten months.” She didn’t even try to hide her excitement.
Aunt Petunia and Dudley had left. That meant that Vernon Dursley could do what he wanted. He trudged to the cupboard under the stairs and unlocked it, pulling his nephew out and ordering him to go up to the master bedroom. His nephew was quite good looking, with his stunning green eyes and messy black hair. He had some muscle too.
Before he could finish his musing, there was a knock at the entrance to his study. Putting that king grandfatherly look on and the twinkle in his eyes, he took a seat behind his desk and said, "Enter."
Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy would do almost anything to ensure the happiness of their child. It had been their dream to have a big family, but Narcissa struggled with her pregnancy and was unable to have any other children. Draco was the most important thing to his parents. He wasn’t as spoiled as many assumed. But he still had everything he could ever need.
This happened all summer usually two to three people, then Vernon, a day. Harry was only allowed off the bed to shower in the mornings. He was hand-fed by Vernon once a day. If he remembered.
Snape looked at the changes the students had went through. Nodding, he gestured for them to follow him. When they got to his quarters all of the students, save for Draco, were shocked. Instead of it being all black, it was decorated tastefully in neutral tones. Snape motioned for them to sit on a comfy looking couch, while he sat on an armchair. “What did you wish to speak to me about?”
Her appointment was at nine, and she would have to walk. Vernon said that he refused to take her in his car. Sighing again she sat up straight. Waiting for the cupboard to be opened. Once it was, she began to dress while Vernon showered. When she was done, she stood at the door. Vernon walked down the stairs and unlocked it, almost pushing her out of the door. She began to walk towards the end of the street when a dog came to walk next to her. Smiling slightly she looked down at Sirius and carried on.
The excruciating pain was almost worse this time. He could feel old wounds reopening. The pain was overwhelming.
At 12:00 the Dursleys and Harry were outside the airport waiting for the school representative to pick Harry up. Looking around, they spotted Annette standing near the doors with another woman. When they got there, they were introduced to the stranger. Her name was Claudette. She was the headmistress of the French academy. After a quick conversation, the Dursleys left Harry alone and drove back home.
Harry could barely think through the pain, he was just hoping that he would be out of here before he was killed. Vernon’s sweaty body pressed against his back and the grunts coming from the much larger man, would probably haunt Harry’s nightmares for months. The metal was biting into his wrists as he fought to get free. However, the only thing that he could think of was the feeling of Vernon thrusting into him, ripping him apart from the inside out.
it there. They had abused him for most of his life and had treated him worse than a House Elf. As he slowly rose from the bed and got ready for a shower he was silently praying that the Dursley's didn't find out that Sirius had died. That was the only thing that stopped them from hitting him the last two summers. He was always the first in the dorm to wake, so it was his job to get the others up. That was his favourite part of the morning. He went for a quick shower, got dressed and then started to wake the others up.
"Harry?" She asked clearly trying to hold in her amusement. Somehow he knew he couldn't talk so instead just nodded. "What happened? Oh right you can't answer. I know who could fix this but first we've got to meet Maman's friends dog, Spark. Come on." She picked him up and ran down the stairs.
Turning and running up to his room he pulled open the door to his bathroom and stood in front of the mirror in shock.
2pm saw Harry Potter sat in his locked cupboard again, his family at the waterpark. There was a crash as the front door of the house was blown off its hinges. The door to his cupboard was ripped of the frame with so much force that it took some of the wall with it. Harry looked up and saw the, very angry, face of Morfran.
He had been back from Hogwarts for five days and they had been the worst five days of his life. His uncle had taken to selling him out, saying he needed more money coming in. Harry knew this was bullshit but didn’t he deserve this? It was his fault Sirius was dead! If he hadn’t been so gullible, he would never have been in the department of mysteries.
Half an hour later Vernon was satisfied with what he had done. He yelled at Harry to clean up the blood on the usually pristine laminate floor.
“We were all talking before I woke you, is there any way for us to return to the way we are supposed to be?” Hermione asked looking hopeful. Hadrian didn’t know whether it was her wanting to change or not.
A few minutes later Marley slithered forwards and went to Draco, silently letting them know that he was going to act as his familiar. Hadrian asked the other two to company them, and together they left the chamber.
"Yea, sorry. This is too weird. I am having a kind of civil conversation with Harry Potter." He chuckled, and Harry laughed a little at that, but before they could continue their conversation there was a knock at the door.
At Draco’s curious look, Hadrian wordlessly handed the paper over to the blonde. “I forgot that we needed familiars.” Draco whispered, looking around at all of the animals in the room.
Harry had decided to go by Hadrian, Harry felt weird now. He would go by Harry in front of Dumbledore but other than that, he was Hadrian. He had learned that he had a mate and could become pregnant too, however, like his mother, his pregnancy would only be six months long. Oh, and his new appearance was now permanent. He had decided that he would
She had been researching glamour spells all summer for this moment. Placing the strongest one she had found on herself. She made herself look like Harry Potter again. She made sure to sit in a compartment alone, not wanting to see anyone until she had to. Taking a deep breath, she tried not to think about what would happen when she got to Hogwarts.
Harry had returned to Privet Drive for the summer, depressed about what had happened to Sirius. Petunia had sent divorce papers in the post while he was at school. He had only found this out when his uncle was ranting while driving Harry home. He couldn’t find the energy to care. He kept thinking he could see a big black dog watching him from afar. But Harry knew it couldn’t be Sirius. He had seen his godfather die.
She glanced between them, before her eyes widened and her mouth formed a perfect 'o' before turning into another smirk. The boys took longer to figure it out, but when they did they went through the same steps as Pansy.
When Draco got home he went straight to the dining room where his mother was waiting for him, she had a knowing gleam in her eyes. "Get carried away shopping again?"
While his Uncles back was turned Harry was looking for an escape, however, not knowing his Uncles plans, could not prepare for what was to come. When Vernon (Harry refused to think of him as anything other than Vernon as he knew what was to come) turned to face him, Harry tried to bolt for the door. Vernon grabbed the small teen and, once again, threw him on the bed, handcuffing him to it so he could not escape.
Another chapter! I hope you like it. I am changing the name of this fic to Broken, and it will be changed by the next update.
"You were bored? That doesn't mean you destroy a room!" he said back, not quite at the point of yelling, but, as a reflex, Harry flinched anyway.
“You might want to see the memories, unfortunately it will take a while for us to get them.” Morfran explained, Harry was shocked, they hadn’t hit him! Why?
Back in the dorm the boys were glaring at the Boy-Who Lived, Now Draco Malfoy's familiar, Hunter. Harry, who could feel all five pairs of eyes baring into the back of his skull, simply raised his head lazily, looked at the other occupants of the room, and rolled onto his back. Rolling their eyes the boys got into their night clothes and went to bed, however none of them went to sleep.
Aunt Petunia and Dudley were out on a week trip with some of her friends. They had left at 9pm and were to arrive back at Number 4 Privet Drive on 8
Harry thought. There was laugher in his head then the voice said "That was my reaction too. Somehow we all got turned into animals. But we cannot be seen by others, we have been turned within the last week."
He stood and made his way to the compartment door, looking over his shoulder he said, “This affects others too, I’m going to collect them.” Not giving them time to protest, Hadrian walked out of the compartment, and right into someone. “Sorry.”
"Yep, I was talking to Hunter. Now can I go to bed?" Draco asked already backing up towards his bed.
Blaise was attempting to keep Paws still while he was talking, "This is Paws, her Mother is Silver."
When Harry awoke the next morning, it was to the sound of voices coming up the stairs. The door to the room opened and he could hear someone thank Vernon, handing him something. Throughout the night, Vernon had placed a blindfold over Harry's eyes. Unable to see, he felt someone walk towards him. He heard the person tell Vernon to leave before the sound of clothing falling.
"Of course Father." Draco said calmly but his excitement on having such an exotic pet was bubbling beneath the surface.
Once they got home, Vernon sent his wife and son out of the house to go shopping. Turning to the cowering boy Vernon slowly removed his belt and began beating the child with it. Yelling about how he should not let people know that he was in pain. When the fat man was done, he carried the unconscious boy to the cupboard and threw him in there. Walking away, the man poured himself a whiskey and sat on his armchair in front of the television.
Today was the first day of lessons at Hogwarts, and Snape came into their room to give them their timetables. Before he left he reminded them to leave for their classes, which begun in ten minutes.
When she arrived at the doctor’s office, she only had a few minutes to spare. After signing in at the desk, she sat in the waiting area. After waiting for a while her name was called. After explaining everything to the doctor, he looked at her in disbelief. Shaking his head, he told her to go to the hospital for a scan.
Vernon sat up in bed, shocked awake by a scream coming from downstairs. Getting up as fast as he could, he made his way down the stairs as fast as he could, which wasn’t very fast at all. When he got to the sauce of the sound, he saw his wife clutching a letter to her chest. A noise made him turn to look at their armchair and noticed a bundle. Walking towards it, he noticed that the bundle was moving slightly. Picking it up he was face to face with a baby. He would never admit this to anyone, but he had a soft spot for babies. He looked at his wife for answers. She silently handed him the letter before leaving to make breakfast. After watching her leave, he placed the baby back on the chair. Turning back to the letter he began to read.
“Dumbledore stupefied me. I woke up less than an hour ago.” Harry replied running his hand through his hair.
They heard the gargoyle to the headmasters office move aside and knew that they had to get out of there and fast. They ran to the floo, taking the book with them. They had just left when the headmaster came into the room. Seeing nothing out of place as of yet he walked to behind his desk, accidentally kicking a fallen book as he went. Going to put the book back, Dumbledore noticed there was one missing. The book with the animal spell.
Once the ceremony was over they took Hunter from the room and everyone had a drink, before leaving the manor congratulating him on the way past. Some people would think it odd that he was being congratulated, but having a familiar was a big deal. They had magic stored inside them and would come to there bonded aid should anything happen to them, and with the war they all needed the protection. When he went back to his room he saw Hunter laying on a large pet bed by the fireplace. When they woke tomorrow they would have to get to know each other.
Harry sat up in his bed when he heard his uncle coming down the stairs. When the door was tugged open, an apple was thrown into the cupboard. The door was then closed and locked. Harry ate his apple quickly, knowing that if he wasn’t done when he came back, he wouldn’t eat until late tonight.
"That's just an excuse because Dumbledore doesn't know where I am." Harry said, figuring it was going to be easier to just answer the questions, she had the look in her eyes that Hermione does when she finds something new to learn.
Seeing that the fireplace was lit he looked around the room. Once he had assured himself that no one was there, he sat in one of the oversized armchairs and began to read.
Suddenly there was a chorus of "Happy New Year!" from Hogsmeade as the clock struck midnight. Just as the voices began so did the fireworks. It was a magnificent sight.
The first of September couldn’t come soon enough. Vernon decided to have some fun before Harry had to leave for school. Thrusting himself into the small boy Vernon let out a throaty moan. Whispering threats into Harry’s ear as he pounded into him. Once he was done, he got up and demanded the boy showered and put his makeup on. When he had the makeup on Vernon got the boy into the car and drove him to the train station.
Harry grabbed Draco's waist and pulled the blonde Slytherin down to sit on the chair of the compartment. Draco rolled his eyes with a smile at how sex-craved Harry can be. But he loved him for it.
Pansy ignored Draco and smiled at Blaise, really wanting her other friend to hear this. "I'm asking him when he'll finally ask Potter out," she told him in an excited tone, and she was nearly bouncing on her feet.
And then Ron walked out of the room, leaving Harry alone in the loungeroom and Hermione followed him out.
Harry shook his head at Fred, gave him a frown, and quickened his pace, catching up to George in a second. George looked back at Harry who was catching up to him quickly. "Hey there, little brother. Who do you think will win? Gred or me?"
"Immortal?" Ivy asked, forcing herself to sound confused. But she was confused. "Ma'am, nothing is immortal in the wizarding world. Everything dies. If something cannot die then that's just... impossible. Beings die, wizards and witches die, trees and bushes die. The moon and sun will probably die in the lengthy future."
"I never knew that..." Harry said. He'd have to talk to his professor about this at some time. It would be intriguing to hear actually.
"Oh, um..." said Neville and he sounded like he was uncertain about what to say. But then he finally spoke. "Yes, I'm fine thanks...." A long moment of silence came upon both boys before Neville had the courage to speak up. "Do you know the clue to the egg yet?"
"Thanks, Professor," Harry mumbled quietly while patting his piglet over its neck and down the back. The skin was a weird feeling as he has never patted a pig before. He had felt snakeskin in the past, which was a little rough, but pigskin was a little like his own but thicker.
"So, what'll it be? A fancy restaurant or McDonalds?" Harry asked as they exited the store and looked down the mall to the Food Court where Mc Donald's and other fast-food restaurants were. Unless Draco wants to go to the fancier restaurants then he would be up to it. This whole date excited him because he has muggle money he has never had before, and it was his own so he can buy anything he wants without the Dursley's knowing.
McGonagall walked back into the middle of the room where the gramophone was, a smile on her face as she turned it off. "Alright everyone, dance time is over," she said loudly so her students can hear her. "You may head to your dormitories for the rest of the morning. All I can say is well done; we have all learnt some new dances today."
Harry shrugged, not really caring about the Yule Ball. He'd rather spend the night up in the 4th year boy's dormitory where he can wallow in self-pity for not going and seeing how incredible Draco looks. He would rather be isolated and alone than go to some dance. Unless someone asks him... then yeah, he will probably go. Though who he wishes to go with is Draco.
When Harry wasn't answering his questions but looking down at the floor, Draco sighs and reaches for Harry's hands. "Harry, I don't mind if I have to repeat myself over and over but you need to hear me out when I say you are loved by so many people around you." That made Harry look up at him, but a little slowly. "Yes, Harry. You are. You just don't see it. And it's not your fans that I'm talking about. It's your best friends Weasel and Granger. Me as well, and our professors. We're all your family and we love you... I love you, Harry." By then he had tears in his eyes. It was the three words that got him the most.
Harry laughed slightly as he cracked his knuckles and neck. He then glanced over to his left, "Say, Draco? Want to give them something to really gawk at?".
Harry just smiled as he removed his wig, chucking it on the grass then he took off his mask. Draco's eyes widened. This bloke in front of him looks like Harry except for... the eyes.
Harry tries wiping away the tears, but they just keep on falling from his eyes. Its useless. His life is useless. There's nothing to live for when he's lonely and punished by his Uncle and bullied by his cousin. He cupped his hands in the lake and splashed his face with the chilly water, hoping by doing so it would erase any traces that he's been crying. He could still feel the tears running down his face... unless it was the water, but he really didn't care right now.
Draco narrowed his eyes at Harry and wiped the sauce of his forehead. "What the bloody hell was that for?!" he asked in an almost demanding tone. But he did want to know why Harry did such a thing. "And what in Merlin's Beard is a Simba? Is it a type of spell or Potion I've never heard of?"
"I love you, Draco Lucius Malfoy," Harry said, his actual voice echoing through the room. He walked to the left, out of sight before Draco could reply back. It was time for another costume change.
Harry thought the other wizard would hex him, and he wouldn't have cared. He let the boy named Justin heal him, feeling the warm calming magic overwhelm his senses. "You've kept this from Dudley and his friends all this time? And aren't you Dudley's age?"
Luna shook her head knowingly at Draco and smiled. "So, if you had a list of things you love about Draco, how much would there be?" she asked as she caught onto Ginny’s mischievous game she’s playing.
Harry was just confused with what he was seeing. The chairs weren't even letting Draco touch them no matter how hard he tries. It's like they have a mind of their own. He would have scolded the chairs if he could but didn't want to appear odd to everyone.
Draco looks behind him at his best friend from Slytherin house and smiles. It seems that he and Harry had been spotted and watched after all. At least someone knows. But then again, he would have to tell Blaise that he and Harry have been kissing for a few weeks. It would be a nice conversation to have though.
Harry's messy black fringe fell across his lightning bolt scar, and Draco desired to brush away his fringe so he could see that infamous scar. In his opinion, it made Harry look even more attractive and unique, like a gorgeous butterfly.
Lucius looked closely at his son in the photo; he definitely saw something he didn't expect. It was the look of love. "Oh, my," he said and rubbed his finger over his bottom lip. He wasn't expecting this at all when Draco came into his life. "It reminds me of how you looked at me when we first met."
Harry's stomach flips and knotted as his knees became a little weak from the incredible sensation of Draco's lips on his own. They were so warm, and yet so soft that it caused his brain to completely shut down. Draco's kisses to him were like black holes pulling you in until you are lost. It was a sweet and loving kiss that made Harry want more.
Harry recognized his robes as those belonging to someone with a high rank in the department of the ministry that dealt with the safety of all non-wizard magical creatures.
I was glad to hear that you and Ginny ended up together. You truly make a beautiful couple and even more beautiful children. When I first saw James, I could have sworn for a moment I was looking at a well cared for version of you when we were at Hogwarts.
“It’s true then? What they’re saying on the train,” Draco said intentionally louder than necessary. Harry’s head snapped in his direction. “Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts,” Draco smirked and nodded to his friends as he introduced them. “This is Crabbe and Goyle, and I,” he stood up a bit taller and let his smirk turn into a proud grin like the one his father often wore, “am Draco Malfoy.”
“I love you,” Harry said, fighting the part of him that wanted nothing more than to grab onto Draco and never let him go.
“Why not?” Harry asked. “Unless sharing a room with a couple half-bloods would hurt his little ego.”
“Damn,” he muttered to himself or perhaps to the owl who still sat somewhat impatiently. “They should sell this shit.” Harry turned to the owl. “Wait here. Drace awaits my response.”
“I think the problem comes more from no wizard being able to afford that much land without moving out to the country,” the achingly familiar voice of Draco replied. “And no one wants to move that far out. Then who could pass by and be amazed that they own a hippogryph?”
PS: Covid-19 will not be present in this story since it wasn't in the general public knowledge when I wrote this whole second half.
This chapter contains depictions of violence and blood that some readers may find disturbing. Nothing too graphic, but if blood squicks you out this may not be the chapter for you.
“Sorry I brought it up,” Draco said, sipping on his drink. “I forget that not everyone knew the Harry I did.”
Harry kissed back immediately, his hands starting to rise to take hold of Draco’s waist. Draco’s hands quickly grabbed Harry’s wrists and pushed them back to his sides.
Harry wandered back into the kitchen and checked his phone which he’d left sitting on the counter. There was another message from the new number which he had neglected to save as a contact.
“Draco,” Astoria said again, placing her hand on his cheek and turning his face to look at her sparkling eyes. “Look at me. Feel the ground beneath you. Feel my hand on your face. You are safe.”
“I’m sure it’s nice, but it’s really no place to raise three children. James and Albus should have their own rooms. They could have that in the manor,” Draco argued, motioning with the hand that was not still holding Harry’s to Malfoy Manor looming before them.
As Draco got older, he learned to take comfort in watching the words shifting on his arm. He saw that his Counterpart wished to escape her family as much as he did. Thoughts about her “terrible Uncle Vernon” or “god-awful Aunt Petunia” popped up on a daily basis by the time Draco turned seven. Of course, from the very beginning, his Counterpart was constantly complaining about some kid named Dudley that Draco originally assumed must be her brother, but later understood to be her cousin.
“Tell Draco I’m divorced,” Harry said to him, his words beginning to slur as he finished off the glass and got up to pour another. The ring that still sat on Harry’s right ring finger began to feel tight as his hands started to swell slightly from the alcohol.
Harry sighed and gave up on the scan, putting his wand back in his pocket. Nothing had changed out here. The Malfoy’s protections were still very advanced.
“I’m excited,” Teddy replied, allowing the shift in conversation. “I’m a little bummed it’s not paid, but not surprised. No positions like that are. It just means Victoire and I will have to wait longer until we find a place together.”
“Her whole family is like that. It’s been notoriously difficult for the women in her family to conceive. It’s a miracle her mother was able to have Astoria after having Daphne. Do you remember Daphne? She was in our class.”
The next morning, Harry woke up to find two owls sitting in his living room. One was Ulysses, the other Harry recognized as a ministry owl.
“I believe you two wrote vows for each other,” Hagrid concluded, breaking the trance. “You may recite those now if you wish.”
The familiar panic welled up inside Draco and he struggled to move, managing to push himself up, fighting to get away from Harry.
Anyway, I was writing to let you know that I want to be your friend. I believe that Soulmates should at least try to be together in one way or another. I understand that our Hogwarts days are far behind us and the war has done irreparable  damage to our relationship, but I don’t think that should mean we can’t be part of each other’s lives.
“Shit,” Harry exclaimed, instinctually pulling out his wand and rushing over to Draco, kneeling beside him.
As Harry got older, he noticed the thoughts on his arm becoming more delusioned and frightening. The person often thought about “wizards” and used crazy terms Harry had never heard before. Those thoughts confused Harry, but they weren’t nearly as bad as he’s going to hit me again, better me than mother, why does everything have to hurt so much, please stop. Please stop, I want to die. Harry would always stare at his arm while the terrible thoughts appeared and faded, waiting anxiously for everything to go back to its crazy normal.
Gloria Klerig rolled her eyes and leaned forward on Harry’s desk, both palms pressed against the thick ironwood.
Harry finished buttoning his shirt and pulled on his auror robes. There would be no time to try to tame his hair, though even when he was on time he rarely tried. Still, if there were ever a day to try to look presentable, it was today.
Before he could second guess anymore, he pressed send. This time, he did throw his phone across the room and straight into the magically cushioned wall which had been designed for catching things that probably shouldn’t be thrown.
“No,” Harry said quickly, sitting up and looking at Teddy again. “They gave me something else to help with heartbreak, but they let me stay on it too long and didn’t let me go off it slowly enough. So, when they took it away from me, I turned to something else.”
Harry hadn't thought birthdays were confidential. They're always something everyone should know so they can celebrate when the time comes. "I um... notice things," he said and brings his hand up to rub at the side of his neck. He felt entirely awkward in this conversation. "Can I ask about your parents?" He decided to ask as he knows Sirius is somehow involved. Or that is what he thought.
To change the topic, they talked about each other, what they like and love doing until it was time to head home. Harry insisted he comes over and meets Draco's parents properly, and not like back in the second year. Eventually, Draco agrees to take Harry home, even though he questioned him to if he's alright to see the manor after the war. So, Draco took Harry to the manor and smiled when seeing the new-coloured manor.
Draco saw the panic written all over his friend's face. He looked around the ball and didn't see his cousin anywhere. Now he began to worry for his cousin and her whereabouts. "What is it?" he asked fairly quickly with a mixture of worry and panic.
"You know, you're starting to act like a Gryffindor, Draco," Harry admits and gives the Slytherin a little playful poke in the arm. Draco starts laughing and his cheeks pinken with pleasure at what Harry's saying.
"Um..." Harry managed to say shyly. He just didn't know what to do. He felt as if he was stuck, frozen to the spot and directly over Draco which only made his flush darken. God, why does Draco make him feel this way? He knows the obvious answer is having a crush on him but like... can he for once control the blush on his face?
He lifted the hem of Harry's dress robe shirt and twisted the fabric up, revealing a nice flat stomach and a neat thatch of small black hairs that are starting to grow. He took out his wand and with a quick swish of it, the curtains around them shut closed. Why didn't he do that before? He looked at Harry's black boxers which had white patches on the material. Ivy's shown him a muggle book before that she got from what muggles call a sex shop. It had a lot of things in it that he's read and learnt like moves, and what to do to make the other feel incredible.
"Yes, but don't expect more compliments to come," Petunia says and turns on the tap of the sink. "So, how's this boyfriend of yours? What's he like? From where I was standing, he looks like a wonderful young man."
Harry placed a chicken wing, a square of lasagna and some curried eggs on his plate. If Draco never gave Harry the eating disorder thing potion, he'd be feeling super sick by looking at these foods. He wolfed down only half of what was on his plate as he felt a bit full after eating as much as he could. He then exited the Grand Hall to get the egg, Marauders Map, a towel, and his Pajamas just to see if Cedric was right about the egg.
"Ever had your first kiss?" Harry asked though he knew it was a lame question. But it was also a really popular muggle question, as he remembers. He just wants to keep the game going. Plus, he is learning more about Ivy too.
"Good!" said Harry with a strict nod. If that girl did anything to his Draco... she will definitely regret it. But he trusts Draco to tell the truth. "Otherwise, she'll regret it."
He led them into his compartment and ignored the funny looks his friends gave him. He put up locking and silencing charms, before taking a deep breath and beginning to talk. “I saw some memories this summer that affected all of us.” He paused and looked around to everyone in the compartment. Draco, Aiden, Amaia, Ashley, Imogen, Neville, Eleanora and Luna. “I think that you’ll want to see them.” He cast a
"No sir." The boy replied. With a sigh and a flick of his wand, the professor had everything back into place. He spun out of the room, robes swirling around him, in a way that only he could manage.
She was completely drained by the time she got back to Privet Drive. She had been told that she had brain damage that was causing her vision and hearing to go at random intervals. Apparently, it could get better, but it would get much worse before it did. They said that each
It snapped. Today was her sixteenth birthday. How could she have forgotten? Her birthday was one of the most important times of the year for her. realising that her mother was still talking she tuned back into the conversation. “We’ll need to go shopping, obviously, and… You’re name! How could I forget?”
When she stepped off the bus, she walked to the guide dog training centre and paid for all the additional training that would be needed. They told her that they assumed that he was a semi-trained guide dog, from the way he responded to the commands. She was told that she would have him by the end of the summer.
Wanting to impress his friends, one of the boys punched Harry in the stomach. Laughter came from his friends as they all started to join in. When they finished, a teacher stepped in to take him to the school’s hospital.
I went to look at what she was talking about and understood immediately understood. The cliff behind her house had 'Harry Potter' carved in to it so big it took up half of the cliff, the other half had Shops running along the length of it. I heard Sav ask her mum about it and she just said that nothing was carved into the stone and even came up to look. Harry suddenly felt weird and was… small?
When they arrived at platform 9 ¾ they all said their goodbyes and went to their families. When Hadrian and Tom walked through the wall they were bet by his aunt and uncle. Apparently they had been told to pick him up. When hadrian told his father that they would try to take him back Tom was furious, but he could still see that his son was shaken by the thought. When the older man asked why, as he knew that they didn’t particularly like Hadrian, all he said was that they were probably being paid to do it. He knew that he had to stay calm, as he didn’t know the full extent of what had happened while Hadrian was living with them. They sped up their walking and, when they got to the apparition point, were gone.
An hour later, Harry was sat alone in one of the train compartments when Hermione and Ron walked in. “Harry-” He flinched at the name, and they noticed “What’s wrong? Do you have a headache? Why do you look different?”
He was by a lake so he went and had a look at his reflection, how he got there he didn't know. He was a tortoise. Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived was now a tortoise. He looked at his reflection again and saw something beneath the surface. It was a shark. A small shark, but still a shark. He was going to jump back when he saw two other figures beneath the surface. A whale and a small dolphin.
"But my animagus is a jaguar not a damn tortoise!" Harry said back. This was all a weird experience.
Draco Malfoy was very excited about Christmas, so excited in fact that he was up at 5am on the dot to awake his roommates. They however were not as giddy to be up at 5am. The all just rolled over and went back to sleep. Hunter jumped onto Draco's vacated bed and curled up to sleep. Apparently Draco had other ideas as he tried to get the animal off the bed. The 6th year boys and Pansy were the only ones in Slytherin that were staying for Christmas. Hunter decided to just growl at him and continue to sleep. Draco was having none of it. He was going to get people up. "I'll just open your presents then. Clearly you don't want them." No one seemed to give a shit, huffing he was about to try another technique when pansy came running into the room, clad in overly Christmassy pyjamas she jumped on all of the beds and yelled with excitement, successfully getting all but one of the occupants of the room up. The only one who wouldn't budge was the jaguar.
Tearing his eyes away from his friend on the floor, the man picked the child up and carried him down the stairs, still in a daze. He made sure to hold his godsons head away from his father’s limp form on the floor as he left the house.
When Draco Malfoy awoke the next morning, it was to his parents sitting on the armchairs, looking shocked. He cleared his throat to get their attention, causing them to look up sharply, a startled look on their faces. It was only when they were with people they were comfortable with, that they showed emotion. Therefore, it was always a little funny when they looked so shocked, which wasn’t often.
When Harry came out of the pensive it was to see Morfran and Nauny looking worried. “We have one more thing to tell you.” Nauny said, when Harry nodded she continued, “You are part Dark Elf and part Siren. You are the hair to the thrown to both. You don’t need to think about it now but there are some books at your relative’s house for you to read.”
“That they were killed when I was a baby.” Harry said with a shrug, wondering what his parent's deaths had to do with these people wanting to talk to him.
Within the first week at his new school, Harry was told that he would also be attending an external school for half his schooling. His teacher explained that he would be being examined throughout his few months there to ensure he went to the correct school.
"And what is this new rule, Draco?" Lucius Malfoy asked looking up at his son who looked so much like him. Draco passed him the letter and once he finished reading it he told Draco to wait there and he would be back as he knew just the people with the perfect familiar for him. So Draco did wait, wondering what this mysterious creature was.
The Dursleys still made him do the work but Harry hadn’t been hit a single day for the whole summer. He was already on the train to Hogwarts before he knew it.
When done, she left the house to go to the shop. While she was there, she picked up the cheapest baby food possible. She was thinking a lot on her way home, finally deciding as she pulled into the driveway. The child would need to learn to do as he was told.  She would let Vernon deal with him. Let him do as he pleased. The less she knew the better. For the both of them.
"Father, my letter from Hogwarts arrived this morning and the school seemed to think it wise that a new rule be set. I personally love the rule." Draco said as his Father sat on a chair.
Harry really tried to get on with his fellow students, but they all seemed to hate him. They didn’t seem to understand that he didn’t have parents. They just thought he was strange. He was treated like an outcast and couldn’t wait to get a fresh start in his new school.
Curious, Narcissa turned to the pensive before telling her husband that they should view them together. When her husband agreed she began to view them.
‘The school is to cure people of mental illnesses. It is not a mad house!’ the teacher sighed, before talking in a quieter voice, ‘Just don’t put him in the hospital again, there aren’t enough beds. Otherwise, do what you want.’ He heard the teacher leave the students quietly laughing as they followed.
Harry didn't know what to say. He didn't have anything against it, he was bi after all. He decided to go with, "Well if it's a day for coming out, I'm bi."
Suddenly there was a knock at the door and Harry went to answer it, not having his wand, he put his long hair into a bun, it wasn’t very neat, but it kept it out of the way. He went to open the door and when he did the couple he found there were… different. Even for witches and wizards, which he didn’t think they were. The woman was tall, with upturned eyes as blue as the ocean with flakes of green in their depths, soft features on a heart-shaped face, with flawless pale skin that perfectly complemented her eyes. She wore a tiara holding some Aquamarine, with small emeralds between them, both were also woven into her long hair, with long embroidered robes to match. The man was even taller, he had black hair with almond eyes the colour of ice. He was wearing long dark blue robes, with ice coloured embroidery and a crown with four different types of jewels placed around it, Sphalerite’s, Ruby’s, Sapphire’s and Diamond’s. They asked if they could come in and Harry, being naturally curious, agreed.
“I explained that we are not financially able to send both boys to the Academy. They told me that they must obey the school rules. However, they said that if either boy passes with a high enough grade, they will be given a full scholarship.” She said, looking at her husband for a response.
He awoke to one of the worst pains of his life. Rolling onto his side he tried to stifle a gasp of pain. Looking at the broken clock Dudley had gotten for Christmas, he could see that it was currently 6 am. Closing his eyes he rolled onto his back, wincing as he did so. Every morning he would be awoken at 6:30 by his aunt so he could clean up and make the family breakfast. Once done, he would do any housework that needed doing before making lunch. While the family was eating Harry would be given an apple and sent outside to do the gardens. His neighbours had been told that he was sent to a madhouse and hurt himself. He wasn’t allowed to shower in the house and so had to hose himself down at the end of the day. When he was done in the garden the Dursleys would do as they pleased while Harry cooked their dinner. After they ate Vernon would take it upon himself to judge Harry’s work. It was never perfect but the better a job he did the less he would be hurt.
When he arrived at Hogwarts, he made up an excuse to his new friend, Ron, and headed for the library. After asking the librarian where to look, he made his way to the bookcase. Picking up the books he needed he checked them out and hid them under his robe. He waited for all the boys in his dorm to go to sleep before creeping down to the common room.
Smiling fondly Narcissa repeated herself. “We have to give you a new name dear, and a new wardrobe!” Her eyes lit up at the last part. Although she never showed it Narcissa loved to shop. Being a Black had meant that she was trained to be on her best behaviour in public. Never showing too many emotions. The idea of having a daughter to shop with had always delighted her. “Before we knew we were having a boy, we had a few names picked out for girls.” She explained her tone turning more serious. “If you would prefer to pick out a name for yourself, I would completely understand, but let us know if you want any ideas.” She smiled at her daughter before turning and leaving the room.
“Ben Jones, Emily Lloyd, Luna Lovegood and Neville Longbottom.” He responded absently, going to the next compartment, where he found Luna. “Hi Luna! Can we talk?” she just nodded and walked out of the compartment.
Sat on the floor in his cupboard Harry cried to himself silently. Today had been horrible. Petunia had taken Dudley to an all-day playdate with one of her friends’ children. Vernon had taken this opportunity to beat Harry within an inch of his life. Everything hurt and, although it made it worse, he couldn’t stop crying. The digital clock Dudley had got for his birthday and didn’t want was sat on his old bedside table.
When they got to Malfoy Manor, Draco came out to meet them. When he saw his mates distress he immediatly pulled him into the house and into the room he was to stay in. He sat them both on the bed, giving the smaller boy a hug.
Harry slowly turned to meet Dumbledore’s twinkling blue eyes, making sure to keep his occlumency shields up. Legilimency doesn’t work on animals, he just hoped that his shields were strong enough. He cocked his head to the side and hoped that he acted enough like an animal. He turned and continued the trip to the common room. “Not so fast, I need to check if you are registered to a student.”
When the call ended Draco, with some trouble, gave the potion to the screaming boy. All that was left to do was wait.
“Well, that is not exactly what happened.” Nauny said, Harry was more than confused now, and apparently they saw that as she hurried to elaborate. “Your parents didn’t die that night. They weren’t even your parents. Your real parents were
Professor Albus Dumbledore needed some jaguar hair for a locating potion that he was making to locate young Mr. Potter and now was the best time to do so.  It takes about two days to brew and another 10 hours to work. All of the students and teachers would be home by then so he would be alone to find the boy.
By the time he crawled into bed that night, his bones aching from exhaustion, he could feel his face straining from all the smiling he was doing. Before he drifted off to sleep, he remembered the students his own age he spoke to.
The week that followed passed in much the same manner that the first night did. However, Harry’s life was about to drastically change.
They had just sat down when Hadrian walked into the room, fully dressed, with his hair left down. He stopped short upon seeing the elder Malfoys sitting there, but just smiled and greeted them politely before walking into the kitchen.
"Yes." Harry then heard footsteps coming running to the dorm, and the 6th year boys, minus Draco, looked at him in wonder. Then at their room. There were cries of disgust and horror coming from them.
Theophania awoke with a start. This was the fourth night in a row she had dreamt about her mate. But this was the first time that she had seen her awake. She had told her parents about the fact that her mate didn’t do anything in the dreams, but they didn’t help much. They didn’t seem to know why. Both of her parents were veela, but never learned much about their kind until they were about to come into their inheritance.
Hermione released him apologising then asked, "What Happened to you? Why are you Malfoy's familiar? Why didn't you tell us you were an animagus? When did-"
Vernon Dursley had just left Privet Drive when Harry Potter, who had been told to complete his chores, saw himself in the mirror. It was quite a shock when he saw his appearance begin to change, he walked closer to the mirror and gasped. His eyes were now an icy blue, his already pale skin, had gone even lighter. His hair had grown down to his hips and the tips were icy blue and there were deeper blue streaks running through the curly strands.
When he got to the new school he was immediately taken to his room and told to get ready for their evening meal. He was hungry, so it didn’t take much convincing to got him to go to the dining hall. He sat with his head down, expecting it to be like the other school. Never getting a chance to eat before the bigger students got everything first. This school was different, however and many of the older students around him were filling his plate, telling him he was too thin and needed to eat more.
The next day, Vivienne went to the local shelter with Sirius. She told them she had found a stray and wanted to adopt it. They looked shocked but allowed her to adopt him. Heading straight to the local guide dog training centre, she did as her doctor had instructed. When she got there, she booked Sirius in for training. Putting his name down as Padfoot. She would pay them at the end of the day when they had conducted their initial assessment. Pulling her wand out, she called the Knight Bus.
They both began to speak at the same time but Harry shushed them, he lowered the charms on Ron's bed and yelled at the top of his lungs, "CONSTANT VIGILANCE" it had the desired effect as Ron jumped out of bed, wand in hand and began looking around. Harry got a pillow to the face before he could escape the room laughing, only to be met by an angry, pyjama clad, Hermione. She apparently had heard the yell from her room and had the same reaction as Ron causing her to get funny looks from her friends.
Apparently, I stress well too much about this and need a beta to help me out, if you would like to be my beta please leave it in a comment, Thanks.
Draco stood and tried to get Harry to move but he was not going to be shown to the whole school, it was only when he whispered to him, "Go up there now or I'll shave all of your fur off." That he moved. "Hunter here is a black jaguar, he likes high places, water and jumping from high places into water. He definitely does not have any relatives in the school."
Nodding, the teen thought over the names her mother had said. “Theophania.” She said slowly. The name had called out to her for some reason.
Ron and Hermione however were trying not to laugh at the look on their friends face the wolf cub was entertaining itself with trying to catch the big cats tail, even though the white one was trying to stop it. The headmaster chose that moment to stand up to make an announcement, "Good morning! As some of you have noticed, Harry Potter is not with us. He has gone to train in America. Now no questions as everything else is confidential, none of us know when he will be returning."
When they finally arrived at the school the sorting ceremony had just begun so they had to wait outside the Great Hall. Hadrian didn’t think that any other sorting had dragged on so long, but it could have just been the excitement of what they were going to do. When it was over he turned to his friends and announced, “Right then, let’s cause some mischief.” Before sending the spell at the door.
Hadrian perked up, “I have an idea.” He smiled before turning back to listen to the lesson, ending the conversation.
Two weeks later saw Harry, Dudley and Petunia sat outside of Annette Marcus’ office, waiting to be called in for their exams. They had been there for just over an hour, and Dudley was beginning to get restless. Looking up when they heard a sound, they saw a stern-looking woman appear from the office.
Those two weeks were the best of the year. They were the only weeks of the year that he could relax.
It was about three weeks after his third birthday when it happened. His aunt was teaching him to put away pots and pans by himself when he inevitably dropped one. He heard his uncle’s heavy footsteps coming down the stairs. He held his breath, ready to be yelled at, as had become the usual.
Spark was not what he expected. He was rainbow and made of wool. Apparently he was animated using a charm. The dog was calm and well behaved. Playing with his toys by Sav's feet. However Arlo, Sav's dog, is really giddy and when he came in all hell broke loose. Me and Sav managed to get away undetected and decided she would take me to see her older cousin, Lizzy. We had to floo to Diagon Alley as she works at Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes. Lizzy was really nice and managed to find out who the magical signature that changed me into… this, belonged to.
When he awoke it was to a familiar smell. A hospital. He groaned and began to open his eyes. There was nothing. It was all black. He began to panic, and he could hear a beeping noise coming from beside him. A soothing voice was telling him to calm down and when he did, they began to talk.
Vernon took it upon himself to train Harry to act like he wasn’t in pain. He would break his bones and make him act like he had nothing wrong with them. In the two months he was there, Harry had sustained a broken leg, a broken arm, a concussion, and many wounds and bruises.
Savie was also part Veela, that is where she got her paleness from. She also told him that because her Papa is a Veela her eyes change colour depending on her mood. Red for anger, lilac for happiness, turquoise for sadness and they go slightly darker for fear.
Once she was down the stairs, she opened the cupboard under the stairs. It was currently housing some cleaning supplies. She moved everything into an almost empty kitchen cupboard. Standing back up she had an idea. Making her way back into the attic, she grabbed a shelf that had been with the house when they bought it. Before she left, she grabbed an old cupboard door and some old shelf brackets. She also some screws and the required tools. She went back downstairs and fixed the shelf to the wall. Satisfied with her work, she went back into the attic. Grabbing another old door, she attached it to the wall, forming a makeshift closet.
He sat near the Slytherin, scared about what he would say. "Don't worry I'm not just going to yell or anything. Is there any chance you could change back, just I feel crazy talking to a Jaguar." Mentally laughing Harry nodded and turned back into his human form.
At that moment Draco began to stir, and Harry already felt protective. He knew to just give into the bond and so that's exactly what he did.
could last for up to three months and could overlap for up to a day. They told her to get a guide dog, and to talk to her caregiver about one. Sighing deeply, she stepped into the house.
About an hour later Harry heard a crack. He looked at the egg and, sure enough, there was a mini basilisk's head slowly coming out of the egg. He decided to try and talk to it,
August. He was aloud in his old room for one day, to collect all of his stuff. Harry knew what was going to happen seconds before it did. Vernon lunged at him, trapping him on the bed and winding him. When Harry got control of his senses again his uncl-
It was his last month at his new school and, even though he was still underweight, he was closer to the weight of his friends his age. Before he went to sleep on his last night, he smiled. He couldn’t wait to spend more time with his friends in the coming years.
"Staring at you in an oddly human like way?" If Harry still had hands he would have slapped Draco right then and there.
"I can't believe that the Weasel and Weaselette managed to afford a familiar. I thought that their family were too poor." Malfoy mocked getting a laugh out of the other boys "Did you notice Potter wasn't at the feast?" He asked no one in particular when the laughing had stopped.
Professor Severus Snape, Potions Master and teacher at Hogwarts, snapped out of his shock when those emerald green eyes looked at him. He swore that he had seen those eyes before, but he just didn't know where. He would figure that out later however, as there was a bigger problem at hand. The 6th year Slytherin boy's dorm was ripped to shreds.
Tonight was the first time that the Slytherin's and Gryffindor's were being civil to one another. In fact they seemed to be getting along well. Pansy and Hermione were talking about their friends and how they 'wouldn't be alive' without them. Ron and Blaise were acting civil to each other. They were at the top of the Astronomy Tower getting ready to watch the fireworks that people set off in Hogsmeade. Afterwards they were going to go to the room of requirement and get a house elf to bring up some firewhisky and butterbeer and they were all going to celebrate the New Year.
Going back to the attic for the last time, she grabbed an old wardrobe. Getting her husband to help, she brought it downstairs and somehow managed to get it into the cupboard laying on its front.
Draco couldn’t focus on the conversation going on around him he was getting tired and knew that he would need to go to bed soon. Realising that his eyes had fallen closed he snapped them open again. He noticed his parents watching him and smiled at him.
Waking up he heard a hushed conversation between a teacher and the students that had done this to him. ‘He’s mad! I heard his class talking about it. His other schools for mad people.’
Deans was a ginger cat with green eyes, "This is Sandfur, she doesn't have any relatives in the school."
The next morning Harry awoke with a start. He looked around wondering where the fuck he was when he saw Malfoy on the bed. Then he realised.
I’m sorry that it took so long. I wrote up until the main plot of the story. The old way I was writing was becoming boring and I had no motivation. Quarantine hasn’t been as easy as I thought it would be. I'm autistic and the change has hit me pretty hard. When I was still in high school, I really struggled with going in. This has been much to similar. To make it worse I have begun to have tics that make it much harder to write. Every so often I’ll either delete some of my work or smash the keyboard. They have also made it somewhat difficult to sleep. The final thing before I get to the story, my laptop hates me and I cant save things and edit them again so I have to write everything in one sitting. With the attention span of a fruit fly, this sucks. I'm so sorry that this was so long. I hope you enjoy!
An hour and a half later, the boys had left the office and were awaiting their results. It didn’t take very long for the woman to emerge from her office. Holding both exams in her hands.
Smiling at Harry, he moved to explain, “It will be a long flight and there won’t be any food until halfway through.” He nodded to the pastry and took a bite from his own, giving him a thumbs up.
Harry was determined not to get up until 7am, because Ron and Hermione were the only Gryffindor's staying, so The Golden Trio had made plans to meet in the Gryffindor common room and spend Christmas together. And 7am was when they were meeting. Harry now, however, had all 6 Slytherin's trying to get him up, and it was fast getting annoying. So, yawning, he stood up and stalked down into the common room and curled up in front of the lit fireplace. He decided that he would leave the common room when the Slytherin's were opening their mountains of presents.
He shivered at the thought and continued walking. After about an hour of walking, but he couldn't be sure, he came to a forest. He walked inside and then turned into his animagus form. It was a beautiful black jaguar. In this form he was capable of going up to 64mph at a sprint and his eyesight was perfect. He could even see at night. However, because of how rare they are he has to stay out of sight, there are only about 15,000 normal jaguars in the wild, let alone black ones, and they only live in America.
She turned the light on and looked at the clock. 7:30. Vernon always came down the stairs before eight, so she knew she didn’t have long to wait. Pulling one of Dudley's old books from their box she began to read. Before long she heard the unmistakable sounds of Vernon stomping down the stairs. Sighing she rushed to put the book away. Vernon made an appointment to see the doctor about the issue she had been having, mumbling about checks while he went.
Harry was harmed almost weekly during the five months he was in France. When it came time for him to leave, he was clutching a broken arm to his chest.
Everyone was at the Halloween feast when there was a loud crash in the entrance hall. The chatter died down and everyone was wondering what was happening. Before the mutterings could start, there was another crash, this time the doors to the Great Hall were blasted open. There stood, Lily and James Potter, Alice and Frank Longbottom, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, most of the higher ranking Death Eaters and Tom Riddle, no longer looking like Voldemort. They made their way towards where Dumbledore was sat and shared a hushed conversation with the old man, before turning and leaving. All of the children and friends of the people that were now leaving the school, had a letter on their plaits when they looked down.
Just past midnight the next morning, a flying motorcycle touched down in an average neighbourhood in Surry. A man exited the vehicle and took a bundle from the sidecar. Two other people, wearing funny-looking clothes, were stood waiting for them. The older of the two stepped forwards, taking the bundle from the large man and patting him on the shoulder. Leaving the others alone, he took a letter from his pocket addressed to a Mr. and Mrs. Dursley.
After that the conversation turned light and after a while they decided to go for a walk around the grounds, with Harry under his invisibility cloak. When they got down to the lake there was a sudden wind that blew the cloak of Harry, who ran to pick it up, he couldn't have had it off for even a minute, but unbeknownst to him there was a pair of silvery grey eyes watching him, that were now widened in both horror and realisation.
Harry felt Vernon stop when his manhood was just pressing against Harry’s tight hole, “Happy Birthday, Harry.” Just as he finished saying that he thrust, without preparation, into Harry, not stopping the frantic thrusting to let Harry adjust, dragging a pained scream from the teen.
An hour later Mr Malfoy was sat on an overstuffed chair in one of the many rooms in the large manor. "I have your new familiar Draco, an extremely rare animal. They however didn't tell me where he was from." Lucius said continuing as his sons eyebrows rose in question, "He is a Black Jaguar. It would do you good to read up on them tomorrow as the bonding ceremony is the day after."
I’m sorry about telling you what Dumbledore did and not having any suspense, it needed to be done so the story made sense later on, and I didn’t know what to do in the two day gap.
Nodding her head, the woman responded, “Good, now then, if you boys would follow me.” She turned on her heels and walked out of the room, not looking to see if they were following.
It was weird to see Hermione now. He could see the way she would have looked if her appearance wasn’t changed in his head. She looked a lot like her mother, Bellatrix, not Mrs Granger. “I’m fine Mi, but
“We’re going to the chocolate factory for Popkin. We know how much food there is, you can have a slice of bread and an apple. After you have completed half of the chores on the list that is on the kitchen table.” His Aunt said, before joining her son and husband at the car.
When his sensei came to pick him up from school, he looked awful. The students had beaten him to the point that he would need to go to the hospital. The teachers just handed him over and walked back into the school, not even telling them what had happened. Sensei Atsushi rushed Harry to the schools’ private jet, phoning the medic in the car over.
charm at the door before taking the vial of memories out of his pocket and cast the pensive spell that would allow all of them to view them, almost as if on a television. He had added the memory of talking to Nauny and Morfran about his creature inheritance to the mix. They had about seven hours of the eight hour train journey to kill anyway.
Harry Potter had never been so happy. For the first time in his life he had friends. By the time he was ready to go back to the Dursleys he couldn’t keep his smile off his face. That didn’t go down well with Vernon. The minute he got through the front door, the large man asked Petunia to take their son and leave. With a sharp nod, she picked the screaming child off the floor, promising him chocolate and anything else he wanted.
“That would be amazing, Draco, thank you so much!” he exclaimed, his attention turning to his Soulmate tattoo on his wrist.
Harry nearly threw his phone across the room. He only stopped when he saw that he also had a message from Teddy.
Astoria turned his face to look at her again, searching his eyes urgently to make sure he was ok. He pulled away again, turning to look at Harry, but this time, he was gone.
Teddy blushed as Harry and Draco shared a smile then took a sip of their drinks. Slowly, Teddy brought the cup down to his lips and tasted it. He was shocked by how smooth the drink felt. It was nothing like the burning, cheap fire whiskey he and Victoire used to sneak from Harry’s liquor cabinet.
“You sure about that?” Harry asked, crossing his arms over his chest. “You seemed to just imply that I am not properly providing for my children. I’m fairly certain that counts as judging my parenting skills.”
“Maybe he couldn’t be with you the way he wanted. Maybe he couldn’t even think of you without falling apart. You lost the ability to communicate through your tattoos. Both of you lived completely separate lives from each other. But, unlike me, unlike everyone else whose Soulmate died in the war or before their time, you have a second chance. You have the opportunity to be with him the way you always dreamed you would be.”
“-is just not enough for a hippogryph,” Hermione was saying. “But of course everyone cares more about the status of the wizards than the quality of life of the magical creature.”
“Draco,” Harry began, tears already starting to fill his eyes. “30 years ago, I made a series of promises to you. Now those promises are a bit outdated. I would like to revise them if that’s ok with you?”
“So,” Harry said, quickly changing the topic. “How pumped are you to start working with Ollivander?”
Harry put his phone aside and finished his dry cereal. It wasn’t too terribly unpleasant, but he did wish he had milk. The coffee pot beeped that it was done and he poured it into a transportable mug.
Sighing, Harry poured the cereal into a bowl and started the coffee brewing. Dry cereal would just have to do for now.
The guests stood, looking back expectantly as Harry and Molly Weasley began walking down the aisle arm in arm. Harry stared straight ahead, focusing intently on the wedding arch and lake before him. Molly whispered comforting words in his ear as they walked, but they seemed to do little to calm him.
Harry quickly regained his balance and cast a different charm to bind Draco’s arms and legs in place so he couldn’t push him off again. He pushed his wand back against Draco’s chest and started casting again.
“No, but I would have been if I wasn’t cursed,” he said. “The thought of you being with her now makes me a little jealous. Before I was too busy being terrified of you to care that you were with someone else.”
“Just go home,” Draco insisted as Harry began to drive. “I’ll call you when I’m ready for you to come back.”
“Fuck!” Harry exclaimed again, muttering under his breath as he continued to cast spells on Draco. “Teddy,” he finally stopped for a moment, turning to his godson. “Get Astoria. Now.”
Harry grew excited as he watched the thoughts on his arm ponder about maybe meeting his “Counterpart” on the train. His excitement faded slightly, however, as he watched his Soulmate decide not to look for him until well after the sorting ceremony.
“Good,” Harry muttered, pausing to make sure they were fully outside before he continued. “I think Astoria hates me.”
