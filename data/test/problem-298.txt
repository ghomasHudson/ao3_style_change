“Are you alright?” Malfoy’s voice was full of concern, and Harry shook the cobwebs from his mind. Having Draco around again was not doing his mind any good. It kept wandering, and as he looked at his ex-lover, holding the angelic baby, his mind wandered again. Stupidly, he let himself imagine it was HIS baby. Stupidly, he imagined grabbing the long blond hair that Malfoy had let grow, and pulling him in for one of those slow, deep kisses. And even more stupidly, he imagined days on end where that was the norm, kissing his fiesty blond, and sometimes getting bitten. Carrying a blond baby around, and teaching him to ride a broom. Telling him that the peacocks his great-grandfather had let infest the property were truly a dumb idea, that the pink roses on that gazebo were full of magic, if he just wished hard enough of one, his wish would come true.
“I didn’t know.” Is all he could manage to mumble through lips that didn’t want to move. None of him wanted to move too much. As if Pomfrey wouldn’t see him if he stayed very still. She took another of those deep breaths, and waved her wand sharply at him.
"And… they can all smell me? They'll all know?" He thought of how Malfoy had stopped dead in the hallway, eyes locked on his. He'd likely smelled him from down the hall. Harry pushed that though FAR away.
“I’ll only take it if I’m about to get raped, then.” Harry said it bluntly, and Pomfrey’s face softened.
As Draco stood, still in the bathroom doorway, Harry watched the hardon stiffen to its full length, and Draco’s eyes darken as he took three short steps into the room, to stand directly in front of Harry, who sat on the bed. Harry felt the frighteningly familiar thrill of power at being able to so easily arouse Malfoy. He looked up into stormcloud eyes and tried to fight the urge to pull Draco back onto the bed with him.
“Sorry, I got stopped by Luna.” He said, hoping they’d not ask questions about his still-damp hair, or in Ron’s case, the scent of cinnamon still lingering around him. Ron gave him another look, and Harry knew he was testing the pheromones. To his relief, Ron looked convinced, and Harry was thankful that Ron was only interested in women. The scent of Malfoy was getting stronger, and he sincerely hoped Ron wouldn’t be able to tell.
He followed the sudden surge of bodies up the stairs, ignoring the chatter, and nodded mutely when Ron asked if he was okay. He forced a smile, but by Ron’s tight smile in return, he knew he’d done a poor job of it. After trudging up six floors, they all emptied into the hallway, and marched around the corner, to the hall their rooms would be in. He heard Dean and Seamus ahead of them crowing with delight that their rooms were next to each other. He heard Theodore Nott complain that the rooms had name plates on the door, and he wouldn’t get to browse for the best one.
The next week went on in the same fashion, but each day after classes, Harry found fresh sheets on his bed, and new potions in his cabinet. The elves seemed to still know his routines and habits, and it made him wistful, thinking of Kreacher who worked in the Hogwarts kitchens now, Dobby who had died.
he’d grabbed handfuls of pale hair and skin, but he was fully aware of the moment Draco Malfoy shoved him down on the couch and covered Harry’s body with his own. Harry whimpered at the feeling. It felt so
He tore his eyes away, and looked back into Malfoy’s face. A mistake. Malfoy pushed him backward, and kicked the door shut forcefully. He grabbed a handful of Harry’s robes with one hand, the other sliding around to grab a handful of his hair, and suddenly, his mouth was there, on Harry’s. Harry wouldn’t call it a kiss. It was far too violent. Too invasive. Malfoy’s tongue was in his mouth, and he could
“No… My… Heat potions.” He said, looking away, at the windows, the ceiling, anywhere but at the aging woman.
“Here. Sorry.” Harry let Draco take the baby from him, and stepped away, staring at the pair of blonds, he felt another sharp stab in his gut. Sure he and Malfoy had had a bit of fun, but he couldn’t really understand why, after all these years, such an insane whirlwind that they’d been in was still affecting him so deeply….
“Fuck you, Potter, it’s a fine name.” Malfoy declared, crossing his arms. Harry’s grin slid from his face. He could feel it coming. The moment it all became too much, and one of them would leave. He knew it would probably be him. His chest was already starting to ache from looking at Malfoy. But Ginny was right inside, his whole family was in there, and he was out here. With Malfoy. There it was. The moment he realized he was alone with Malfoy, and he had to leave before something happened.
stuck inside me, so I’d say whatever reason you have for risking this happening again is my business.” Harry argued.
Harry stood in the Entrance Hall with the other Eighth Year students. They had all arrived early, and while Harry was filled with a giddy anticipation to be back in his childhood home, to see his friends and do his best to forget the war, he missed riding on the Hogwarts Express. He missed King’s Cross Station, and the sounds of owls hooting as they were loaded up. He missed the old witch with her candy trolley. Most of all he missed blending in with the throng of students as they rode carriages up to the torchlit castle through the dark and were met with a glittering feast.
He let himself cry for only a few short minutes before he angrily dashed the tears away with the back of his knuckles, rubbed violently into his eyes until he saw stars, and forced himself to stand. He had a shower, cold, quick, and efficient, rinsing the sweat and leftover traces of orgasm away. He went back to his room, and looked at the bed, damp from his sweat, a puddle of his release spilled across the blankets. He groaned and dug through his trunk for his slippers. He’d just have to go ask the elves for a clean set.
"Whatever it takes? Fine. I don't hate you, you're forgiven. See yourself out." Malfoy stood, and was almost to the door when Harry caught him.
“They’re probably all the same.” Hermione told him a bit waspishly, finding her own room. Her room was between Padma Patil’s and Ron’s, and on the other side of Ron’s, at the far end of the corridor, was Harry’s. He stood in front of it for a moment while all the other students went in, came back out, shouted to each other, and explored their new spaces. He hesitated. He was a bit terrified of what might be on the other side, worried that the others might feel the extra wards if they tried to go in with him. He was terrified that something inside might give away what he was, and even more terrified that Hermione had been right. That all these rooms were the same. That it would be impersonal, that it wouldn’t feel like
“I don’t mind.” He glanced up at Malfoy, and quickly looked back to the baby. He absolutely could NOT engage in the look Malfoy was giving him. It was one of his scarce looks of open contentment.
wanted this! I swear to god if you panic every single morning you wake up with me in your bed, I’m going to just avoid you altogether.” Malfoy threatened. Harry barely heard him as he rushed into the bathroom, and threw open the medicine cabinet hidden behind the mirror. He yanked out potions as he heard footsteps following him, and swallowed quickly, shoving the empty jars back into the cabinet to be magically refilled the next morning. He slammed the mirror closed just as Draco rounded the corner, and Harry turned on the tap, running cold water to splash on his face.
. Malfoy looked half-feral as he stomped his way over to where Harry was standing, and Harry felt as if he might collapse. His legs felt weak, and his breathing was too fast, and Malfoy was too far away. But then Malfoy was right there, grabbing him, dragging him a few steps down the hall, and pulling them through the door of a classroom. Harry stumbled through, and grabbed a handful of Draco’s robes to steady himself. He could still feel Draco’s anger, and with his mind nearly mush from the battle of Alpha pheromones he’d been subjected to, Harry moved on instinct. He flattened his hands against Malfoy’s chest and leaned up to kiss him, hoping his gesture cooled Malfoy’s fury.  It seemed to have the exact opposite effect of calming him down. He grabbed Harry, and kissed him violently, shoving him into the wall in a way that mimicked the position he’d been in with Zacharias. This, however, was not a gentle kiss while surrounded by a delicious scent. This was angry, forceful, and so thick with the sharp scent of Malfoy’s pheromones that it nearly burned Harry’s tongue to taste it. Everything about Malfoy burned. His scent, his flavor, and his body. They burned into Harry and Harry clung to it, wondering how on earth he could have ever imagined Smith could be a half decent replacement. There was no replacement for this. There was no substituting how quickly Malfoy got rid of their clothes, or how tightly he held Harry. He gave Harry just what he needed, and he didn’t wait. He didn’t ask. He didn’t hesitate. Harry could taste in the air what Malfoy wanted, what he needed, and Harry knew Malfoy could discern the same of him. He knew just what Harry needed, and wasted no time giving it to him. He touched him, hands claiming the skin the Smith had dared to touch, teeth warning Harry never to let anyone else kiss those lips, and pheromones drowning Harry under a tidal wave of jealousy, possession, and desire.
“Please…” He breathed, not sure if he was asking Malfoy to hurry and go, or to stay and fix him. He knew he could fix it, too. He knew Malfoy could touch him and take the burn away, replace it with bliss, and end his horrible torture. Malfoy froze, his eyes locked on Harry, and Harry almost sighed with relief when Malfoy came towards him.
“Er… Yeah. Thanks.” Harry finally managed to express. He shifted uncomfortably on Malfoy’s lap, desperately wanting to flee. To his shock, there was a strange pulling sensation, and Malfoy’s flaccid length slipped free, leaving Harry straddling him for a heartbeat with nothing trapping him in place.
"Not even a little. I never told anyone, but… he showed up to my wedding.  I'd thought he'd understand, that we were friends, but… I was sooo wrong. He was furious. Pretended to be all cheery and even congratulated me, until he got me alone. I thought he was going to curse me, or Ginny, or…. Set the place on fire. He was out of control. I was actually a little scared of him, of what he'd do, or say. But… he just screamed a lot. He tried to get me to call the whole thing off, tried to get me to… um… anyway, I didn't, and… he left, and… I didn't see him again until this past Friday." Harry felt a heat in his face, and a pricking behind his eyes. A moment later, a sniffle escaped him. Hermione practically jumped to her feet, and darted around the baby and the table, and wrapped her arms around him, smothering him in comfort, and the scent of family. Harry tried to push her away, tried to hold back his stupid, uncalled for tears. Neither worked, and in moments, he found himself sobbing into her chest with his arms wrapped around her. He felt like a giant baby, sniffling and bawling, but as he cried, and tormented himself with memories of a perfect white smile, glittering silver eyes, and a furious, jealous explosion of platinum and alabaster, cloaked in black, BEGGING him not to do it, he felt relieved. At last, he wasn't the only one carrying the knowledge. Hermione knew. He knew. Draco knew. Draco's wife had known before she died. By the laws of probability, he knew more people were bound to find out. One person could keep a secret. Four people was an uncontainable leak. It felt as if the secret was already out. All that was left was damage control. His life was already miserable, he couldn't imagine how it could get worse, except, maybe, if Malfoy left again.
“Being married make you soft, Potter?” The blond taunted, and Harry lifted himself from the breathless body to glare down at his newest guilt. Teasing silver eyes met his, and Harry felt his stomach lurch at the provocation that filled them. It’d been so long since he’d had sex at all, and even longer since he’d felt so intensely aroused. He’d finished too quickly. He wasn’t done with his lover yet, and it seemed Draco, though he’d also cum, wasn’t ready to quit.
“Where do you keep hearing all this from?” He muttered, more to himself than anything. Malfoy had heard him, though, and gave him a small smirk, before he turned to answer Harry’s wife.
another way to stop my heats from being out of control.” Harry murmured in an undertone as they sat at their usual table at the back of the library, minus Malfoy who was still conspicuously absent. Ron’s eyes brightened, and Hermione gave a small, hopeful smile. “I could get pregnant.”
“I’m not so sure, anymore. I don’t fancy other guys, but… I don’t really fancy other women either… Just him.” He explained. “I thought I fancied you, but… it’s a different kind of love. I’m sorry, Ginny… I think I want a divorce.” As the words left his mouth, a weight lifted from his chest. He’d said it. Finally, after years, he’d said the words, and there would be no taking them back.
He’d been in the courtrooms, after the war, testifying on behalf of the Malfoys, explaining how Narcissa had lied to keep him alive, and the Malfoys had all switched sides…. He hadn’t even realized Malfoy was there, until he’d been exiting the courtroom…
“I’ve been wonderful. I was glad to see you’ve finally come out as an Omega. It’s good to be honest with yourself, you know.” Luna said, her smile stretching a bit wider for a moment. “I’m glad to see you and Draco are getting along better now.”
“Actually… I think I’ll go see Pomfrey.” Harry stood from their table, ignoring the glances the children eating lunch around them cast him, and hurried from the Great Hall. He jogged up the stairs, and nearly burst into the infirmary.
"Apology not accepted. Will you be leaving, or would you like to sneak around my house more?" Malfoy asked sarcastically. Harry sighed. He should have known it wouldn't be that easy. He closed his eyes, and tried to find a sliver of patience.
you’ve been abusing these potions, you’ve built up a tolerance to them.” She pursed her lips, and Harry sagged with relief. That was easy, then.
"I don't think being friends is a possibility." He admitted, rubbing the back of his neck, and stretching a bit. "I didn't cheat on Ginny, but I wouldn't say things went WELL, either."
"Harry, are you feeling alright?" Hermione asked softly. Harry jolted, and shook his head to clear it of the sticky cobwebs.
“Er… Are we?” Harry asked, certain that he and Malfoy had not said so much as a single word to each other publicly. Even in their group Charms project, they avoided interacting directly.
“Harry, over here!” The call from across the library made Madam Pince frown, and Harry startle as he swung to face the familiar sound. Luna sat at a table halfway down an aisle, with a stack of books by her, and a serene smile on her face as she beckoned him over. Harry cast one look around, but saw no one that might save him from whatever strange subject Luna was researching this time. He walked down the aisle toward her and took a seat, eyeing the books she had gathered. It looked like a collection of random spell books and charms, but Harry couldn’t determine any common factor just from the titles.
mark, too. Scent-marking is even more temporary, soaking someone in your pheromones until it’s in their pores, usually during sex. You can have sex without releasing a bunch of pheromones, and you can also just spend a ton of time with someone, steeping in their pheromones without having sex, so someone being scent-marked isn’t
“No, I don’t think so. It’s not… not like dominance, as you might see it, forcing people to do things, it’s more to do with dominant genetics. ‘Dominant’ does not mean you like to bend others to your will, it just means that your pheromones are… more potent to those around you.”
“Go to bed, Harry. He’ll be fine.” Ron said, sounding suddenly tired, and worried. Harry nodded, feeling strange, light-headed. He disappeared into his own room, and hid in his bed, forcing his eyes to stay closed and his limbs to remain still, even though he didn’t fall asleep for hours.
“Oh, er, yeah. Sorry. Anyway…” Harry tried to collect the jumble of his thoughts, what Luna had said, what Pomfrey had said, what Hermione had said. What Draco had said. “What do you think of… Draco? Do you think it’s a bad choice to… have sex with him?”
"'And' nothing, Hermione. What are you on about?" He was afraid he already knew the answer though. Hermione sighed a long-suffering sigh.
“Potter. Could I have a word?” Zacharias Smith spoke with sure even words, and Harry nodded before he’d really processed the words. His thoughts were far too fuzzy. He rubbed his forehead as if it might help, and followed Smith around the corner, to a less frequented corridor near the Transfiguration classrooms. Harry could smell Smith now, and realized he’d never been alone, or close enough to really single out his pheromones from the crowd before. He smelled cool and minty, and when it was just the two of them, with Smith standing just a short distance away, the scent of him made Harry’s head spin.
“Sorry.” Malfoy responded without a trace of remorse in his voice. “I’m close to a rut, so…” He shrugged, but then his eyes narrowed in suspicion. “After this, I should probably avoid you until it’s over, just in case.”
“I… Really smell like him?” Harry sniffed himself. With Luna’s words in his head, Malfoy’s scent DID remind him of cinnamon. But it was faint, even with his nose pressed to his own shoulder.
"No more than usual." She said with a lifted brow. Her eyes flicked to Ron, and he shifted uncomfortably.
He left the house, and apparated to the pub, barely noticing that it had started to drizzle. He came in from the back to an unusually full bar. It seemed to grow louder as he entered, and it took his ears a moment to register the cheer that went up.
Harry let the comforting way Hermione talks about her books soothe his nerves, and smiled down at his breakfast. The next month, he thought, was going to be FAR better. Afterall, he has a whole month to plan for his next heat.
Harry looked away. He could figure out how to approach Malfoy later. At that moment, Seamus was trying to set the table on fire with a new spell for turning juice into spiced mead.
“What did Pomfrey say? Are you okay, then?” Hermione looked worried as she leaned across Ron, barely listening to the lecture on multi-wizard charms.
Harry felt himself relax as Malfoy spoke. It was almost like listening to one of Hermione’s lectures. Comforting, familiar, and gave him ideas.
“Yeah. I’m used to taking potions every day, so it’s not hard to remember.” Harry shrugged, already trying to back out of the hospital ward. Pomfrey frowned at him as he escaped, but didn’t stop him.
"Malfoy and I were never in a relationship." He finally argued. He couldn't bring himself to mention the rest of it.
“If it’s not someone who’d have sex with you, or someone you’d have sex with, then the sexual appeal isn’t part of the scent.” Hermione summarized. “There aren’t MANY Alpha girls in school, but it’s probably why you liked Cho, and Ginny, even though you were on suppressants. Part of you could still tell that they were what you wanted.”
The new door had the same handle as the door to the hall, and it revealed a bedroom. Deep ruby red sheets draped elegantly along a huge four-poster bed hung with equally rich purple curtains. At the foot of the bed stood his trunk, already brought up by the elves. There was a bedside table made of wood equally as dark as the previous room’s furniture, and a narrow desk against one wall, next to another door. Harry moved toward it, certain that there wasn’t possibly enough space between where his door had been and the end of the hall for so much space, and smiled to himself as he praised the magical work that allowed so many extra students to come back to school.
“That’s not good for you Harry!” Hermione chastised him, ignoring the way Ron tugged her hand to get her to sit again. “You could mess up your internal chemistry, or damage your magic, or-”
Harry was surprised when he apparated to Malfoy Manor, and the wards didn’t drop him outside the gate. Instead, he landed on the steps, just as he’d meant to. Malfoy hadn’t locked him out of the apparation wards. He was sure it meant nothing good.
“You can’t tell how much stronger their scent is?” Ron asked, and Hermione gave him a chastising look.
“You’re being incredibly calm about all of this, Potter… I was half expecting you to lose your head when I bit you. Or after we’d mated the first time… Well, I suppose you did actually kick me out of the bed…” Draco trailed off, and Harry shrugged, smirking at the memory. That had been its own kind of satisfying.
too. There really wasn’t a surplus of Alphas in his age group, he thought, catching a whiff of some underdeveloped hormones. They smelled almost like baby powder to him. Soft, fresh, and unappealing. He had laughed out loud at the fourth year Alpha that had tried to pheromone bomb him into a corner. He hadn’t even bothered to retaliate.
him. Speaking to him, and meeting his eyes. Harry found it easy to speak to him like this. Strangely easy. Terrifyingly easy. Malfoy looked at him with incredulity.
“More or less.” Malfoy shrugged. “At least it’s only one day, at most. Consider yourself lucky. When I go into a rut, it won’t matter who I sleep with or how many times I come, it’ll still last for three days, and I’m likely to rape any Omega that gets near me.” He sounded disgusted with himself, and Harry felt a pang of sympathy. Without thinking, he found his hand resting on Draco’s thigh with only the sheet separating their skin, comforting his Alpha.
When he turned to face Draco, he caught the same emotions on the blond’s face, and pulled him roughly into another kiss. He couldn’t help himself. He felt as if he was freefalling into pure emotion, a mixture of hope, love, and fear filling his every thought as he tried to drown himself in the kisses. When hands tugged at him, pulling him toward the door, Harry grinned maliciously into the needy kisses, and wrapped his arms firmly around Draco. A moment of quiet struggle was all it took for him to take the blond to the floor. He easily trapped his love, who struggled carefully so he wouldn’t wake the child, and not nearly enough to free himself. Finally, he broke the kiss, and hissed quietly at Harry.
"Thank you. Why don't you rest for a bit." He listened to the small, breathless elf's outrage at his suggestion all the way up the stairs.
“I think maybe… I’ll just have to do what Pomfrey said. Find an Alpha and have some sort of arrangement with them, so we don’t… Pretty sure  you’ve ruined Smith, though. Maybe Charlie, Ron’s brother, or…”
“Ginny?” He found her easily, and she, followed by what seemed to be the whole room, congratulated him as she suctioned herself to his side, and he started through the crowd. He was slowly headed to the bar. He needed a VERY stiff drink. It seemed like some horrible carousel of people wanting his attention, spewing pleasantries, and clapping him on the shoulder. He did love his friends. He enjoyed spending time with them all. But today was not a good day…
“Don’t stop. Don’t stop!” Harry begged, squeezing his legs around Malfoy’s thighs, urging him on. Malfoy smirked down at him and strong hands grabbed him, lifted him, and then Harry felt a rather short rush of fear as he realized he was being carried. Another door slammed open, and Harry was tossed on his own bed. He had no time at all to feel anger at being tossed, indignation at being carried, or infuriated that Malfoy had
When Harry picked up his robes from the floor, he found the small emergency potion in the pocket, and wondered if that had been ‘an emergency’. It had been surprising, sudden, and rather violent, but… He’d liked it. He’d
“Hm? Oh, yeah. Fine.” He said, looking back to Hermione. She looked all too knowing, and he didn’t doubt that despite not being able to smell him, she hadn’t forgotten what Malfoy was.
“Oh no! I can’t come. I’ve got practice.” Ginny explained, with an almost convincing look of sorrow.
“I already had an earful from Pomfrey.” Harry interrupted, and Hermione finally gave in to Ron’s tugging, allowing him to pull her back to her seat. “Anyway, I didn’t know. And I built up a tolerance, and now I can’t use them, or… the emergency ones might not work when I need them to.” He explained, feeling his cheeks heat with a blush. Hermione nodded seriously, having already thought of all of this, but Ron let out a low whistle.
Harry noticed Ron’s eyes on him more throughout the day, the flaring of his nostrils as he breathed in what HAD to be Harry’s pheromones. Harry discreetly sniffed himself, but couldn't smell anything. He was a little sweaty, but otherwise he smelled the same. He found that he could smell Ron, though. It was strange. A tangy scent that tickled his nostrils and made him want to lean in and take a deep breath. He noticed how tall Ron was, how broad his shoulders had gotten. They were resting in Hermione’s room, studying (or pretending to study, in Harry’s case), when Harry suddenly made the connection.
“No! If you hate it so much, take them yourself!” Malfoy snapped, and his pheromones practically gushed out. Harry swallowed, his heart pounding at the scent of Malfoy’s disgust at the idea. He wanted to nestle into him, tell him he wasn’t serious, kiss him until he stopped being so angry. He settled for explaining why Malfoy’s suggestion wasn’t possible.
“She refused to believe things were over… I filed the paperwork for divorce after she left. I don’t think she’ll want to speak to me after the owl delivers the copies for her to sign…” Harry mused, recalling the way the elderly wizard who’d helped him through the single horrible roll of parchment had explained the process as Draco stood next to him. A light touch ruffled through his hair, and he looked up to meet the soft silver gaze. He looked as if he shared Harry’s heartbreak, and Harry leaned into the touch, finding it both strange in its newness, and enjoyable. Before he could grow used to the gentle sensation, the fingers tightened, and the silver gaze seemed to harden a bit. Harry winced a bit at the sudden change of tone, but said nothing as Draco leaned in.
“Yes, Headmistress.” The students rang out in unison. Her lips thinned in what might have been an approving smile. Harry was amazed. He’d get his own room. A small piece of the castle that was just for him. It felt like Christmas had come early. His eyes darted around the group, taking in the others’ reactions. They all seemed excited, grins plastered across nearly every face, except…
Harry glared at her. He didn't want to be told how lucky he was. He was likely the least lucky person alive, in fact. He dropped his head to his hands.
“Of course I’ll agree to keep fucking you. That is what you meant by ‘help’, isn’t it?” Malfoy’s eyes opened again, and he managed to fix a mocking smirk on his face for a moment before it was wiped away with another inhalation of Harry’s pheromones. Harry had to resist the urge to call him a prat, and refused to give in to Malfoy’s provoking. He was clearly just trying to wind him up, and Harry thought it was probably better not to delve into their old warring habits. He much preferred the new habits they seemed to be forming. Which was strange on it’s own.
Harry wasn’t sure if he was expected to apologize, but he didn’t have time to decide on the correct words before Smith stepped closer. He looked almost nervous. Harry found their gazes locked together.
“As it would be unfair to reduce the opportunities of our younger students, all Eighth Year students will not be formally included in the houses. This means you will not contribute to the House Cup, you will not be allowed to compete in the house Quidditch, Academic, or Accessory teams, except in a supervisory capacity. You will be allowed to sit wherever you choose at meals, visit the Common Rooms and Dormitories if you are staying there, or are invited, and you may invite visitors to the castle and your private rooms on the weekends,
“Oh. Er. I suppose.” Harry said, imagining for a moment what Hermione might smell like. Parchment WAS about right, he thought. “Luna, can I ask you something?”
“If you hate it so much, why do you keep coming back for more?” Harry snapped, his own ire rising at the thought that Malfoy wasn’t pleased with what he’d taken. At his question, Malfoy’s glare faltered, and he looked to the side.
makes me want to fuck you between classes, just to see their faces when they smell me on you.” He murmured right in Harry’s ear. Harry shivered at the low sound of it. The threat.
“Find me irresistible do you?” Harry teased with a grin, feeling that same tingle of enjoyment in his chest at being able to
“Of course you weren’t paying attention. And you probably haven’t done any reading to understand what being an Omega actually means, have you?” Malfoy asked, looking at him with a sort of sad humor. The irritation was no longer burning his nose, and instead, the spicy scent of Malfoy was almost playful. Harry wanted to kiss him, to taste that flavor on his tongue.
“Would you stop that?” Harry snapped, his knees squeezing Malfoy’s hips as if he could make the shaking end there.
, Ron.” Hermione’s voice answered from the door, and both boys turned rather guiltily to see her standing with her arms crossed.
Harry ignored the trail of sweat that dripped down his back, telling himself it was the sun as they walked back in from Herbology. The greenhouses HAD been rather warm, afterall. He ignored how fast his pulse felt, telling himself it was the walk. It WAS uphill, wasn’t it? Harry refused to acknowledge the way every scent around him was more potent, especially that of the Alphas. Ron was walking ahead of him, keeping a brisk pace, and Harry could taste his pheromones trailing behind like a cape. Hermione was at Harry’s side, and Harry could even smell her, now. She smelled like soap, dirt from their lesson, and Ron. He’d never noticed before, since they were always together, but he could
"It was… too much. I'd thought the pain would fade, like grief, you know? But… seeing him, being in that house… seeing Scorpius… it was… too much." He felt clumsy trying to explain, but Hermione just nodded.
“Harry’s amazing with babies, isn’t he?” Ginny said from next to him surprising Harry with her presence. He hadn’t realized she’d approached.
Harry was hopeful after two weeks, that his heat cycle would be back to the normal once a month schedule. He was halfway through a month without even a hint of being too warm, or horny. Just two more weeks to go, before he could declare to Pomfrey that he was fine. The horizon looked bright and cheery and
“Well, unfortunately, there’s nothing that can be fixed. My diagnosis is that having been dependent on suppressant potions, now that you’re off of them, your natural heat cycle has become unstable. It should sort itself out in a month or two, and get back on track. Until then, I suggest you either take time off of classes, or keep an Alpha on call. Don’t look at me like that Mr. Potter, I know very well how your last two heats ended so abruptly. Don’t act as though I’m suggesting something distasteful when you can’t deny it works. Being an Eighth year, of course, gives you certain privileges. If you need to have someone come to you, I’m sure that can be arranged. If you’d like recommendations-”
that spicy, cutting scent. It burned his nose and filled his head, and his tongue trailed out, seeking more. The hand in his hair wasn’t
Malfoy’s brows pulled together, and he glared up at Harry, hands flat on the floor on either side of his hips, and Harry could still smell his irritation.
Draco stood, shaking, for a moment and caught his breath. Harry clung to him, arms wrapped around his shoulders, suddenly aware that Malfoy and the wall were all that kept him from dropping straight to the floor. The sweltering sensation of his heat was passing, leaving his skin sweaty and cooling in the empty classroom.
Accusing eyes blinked open to stare at him, and Harry could do nothing more than smirk down at the perfect response. If this was to be his life, he could find himself easily intoxicated by simply living every day.
I think he’s trying much harder this year, to be who he wants to be.” Luna finally said, cryptically. She gave Harry a smile.
“Because I didn’t want to get kicked out again. I don’t WANT to leave while you’re asleep… vulnerable. Especially since you’re covered in my scent. It makes me want to stay, to protect you while you recover. It’s the same for all Alphas." Harry noticed that Malfoy’s pale face was tinged pink, and he laughed softly. He definitely hadn’t imagined the defensive tone in Draco’s voice. He felt his body relaxing into the embrace, comforted by the pheromones, the warmth, the familiarness of Draco’s body. That thought threatened to make him panic again, but it was suppressed by the words Draco had just spoken. It was natural to feel like this. Last night, however… Harry groaned, wiggling his way out of Malfoy’s arms to sit up, holding his head in his hands.
hard to not notice that when Malfoy spoke quietly to Hermione he was always polite and the sound of his voice made Harry’s stomach clench. He couldn’t hear it without thinking about the way it sounded during sex. Murmured exhalations and harsh words of need. Harry did not think of how those hands and lips felt on him. He did not think about how Malfoy’s body had felt against his. And he absolutely never, not once, thought about how he had felt afterwards.
“I don’t know what’s going on with you, Potter, and it’s probably none of my business, but… You’re distracting me. I’m meant to be focusing on my school work, and you’ve been smothering the class with your blasted pheromones for
. He was glad when the blond took the hint, removed his fingers, and rubbed the hot, thick length of his cock across Harry’s arse. Harry groaned, louder, arching his back, biting roughly at Draco’s lip, trying to convey that he wanted
Hands explored, more slowly than they had before. Lips trailed down from his mouth, along his jaw, down his throat. Teeth scraped, and a thrill of dangerous anticipation filled Harry at the thought of Malfoy biting him.
When they were both spent, Harry took a moment to catch his breath, resting his face on white skin and he huffed in oxygen. He felt Mafloy’s soft chuckle under his head before the sound reached air.
“Whatever they want. It probably won’t work very well on you, since you’re dominant, but typically if an Alpha or Omega just starts smothering you with pheromones, you’ll do pretty much whatever they want. Sort of addles the mind. Mostly the younger ones just do stupid pranks like stealing kisses, or a quick feel, but there are a few that take it too far.”
"So is this what it's like, then? Being able to SMELL everyone? All the time?" Harry mumbled, depressed.
“Sure. Not gonna shower at all. I’ll just go around school with your come dried all over me, and let
"Don't wake the baby." Harry breathed, as wide, startled grey eyes found his. Malfoy's expression changed to outraged confusion. "We need to talk." Harry said, and nodded toward the door, taking a moment to stare down at the perfect pink baby swaddled and pillowed in pure white silk, before he joined Malfoy in the hall and let the door close.
“Yeah, but I thought you were joking. I mean… You said you and Ginny…” Harry broke off, suddenly realizing that GINNY must have been an Alpha, too. The thought made his head spin.
“Seven… eight hours ago?” Harry shook his head, unable to recall exactly what time he’d woken up and choked down the thirteenth potion in as many days.
“Sorry. Just didn’t sleep well. No time for breakfast.” He lamented, checking the clock on the kitchen wall. He gave her a swift peck on the cheek, and headed for the Floo, dissolving into the flames with a handful of powder before he could even hear her farewell. It was one of the rare days when he could hardly look at her, for the rage twisting in his gut. Not at her, she’d done nothing wrong, of course. But at himself. The days had been coming more and more frequently where he couldn’t meet his own eyes in the mirror. Where Kingsley spoke to him about being too aggressive with his suspects. The days were becoming rare when he felt happy, and satisfied.
He woke alone, his bed still damp with sweat, the scent of Malfoy lingering around him, but the sheets were cool, Malfoy long gone. Harry almost felt jilted to find himself suddenly alone when he’d fallen asleep warm and safe. He refused to entertain the feeling of being alone and empty, and maintained to himself that he was glad Malfoy was gone. That he didn’t have to decide whether to kick him out of the bed again or awkwardly laugh over this happening again.
“Of course.” He agreed, and Hermione immediately began drawing up a time table of what he needed to learn, and how long it should take. Harry let her, entirely out of his depth already, and just wanted to know what he was doing before Malfoy could overwhelm him again.
“I’m not taking the suppressant Potter.” Malfoy’s voice was firm, unyielding, and Harry licked his lips.
Harry made a stop by the infirmary to let Madam Pomfrey know that there was nothing to worry about, but she took one look at him, and was forcing a potion into his hands.
“You have NO control over your own pheromones, do you?” Ron chuckled, and Hermione glanced up, curious. Ron explained as if on cue. “Harry just reacted, nothing terrible. Younger Omegas do it all the time, if an Alpha tries to bully them with pheromones. It’s sort of an involuntary reaction.”
A dull throbbing pulled his attention to his own body, and he looked himself over, seeing bruises and bitemarks littered across his skin. His fingers came up and he pressed them to the bruise he could feel but not see at the base of his neck. His eyes grew wide, but when he pulled his fingers away, there was no blood.
“You don’t want to go just once more?” The temptation was breathed against his throat, and Harry shook his head violently.
"I wanted to apologize." Harry started. Malfoy's face flickered with disbelief, and irritation, but he nodded for Harry to continue.
Harry sat quietly as they were sorted, cheering at the appropriate intervals, clapping for students sorted into other houses, and resisting the urge to boo the first time Slytherin was mentioned. He knew that Slytherins weren’t all bad, but it still chafed him a bit. He let his eyes wander across the hall to Slytherin table and found the head of bright platinum blond hair that was ducked, not watching the sorting, but appeared to watch the cutlery on the table. As if he could feel the eyes on him, Malfoy looked up, met Harry’s gaze, and held it. His face was unreadable, blank. Harry stared back, unsure whether to smile or frown. They were supposed to be putting the past behind them, putting aside their differences. Harry had even testified at his and his mother’s trials.
The Hall slowly filled with students, and Harry found himself seated amongst an eager, excited group of Gryffindors. Those closest to him were his friends, but those farther down the table kept shouting, trying to get his attention, or tell him about themselves. Harry ignored most of it, pretending he was deaf to all but those near him. Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, Dean, Seamus, and even Dennis Creevey sat around him, nearly like a barrier, keeping him neatly cushioned from the attention seeking acquaintances and strangers. Harry shared a short conversation with Dennis, and they shared a sad smile over a memory of Collin. Harry, in a strange burst of emotion, wondered to himself if Dennis needed an older brother to look out for him now, and vowed silently to himself to keep an eye on the younger boy. He was a sixth year now, but still seemed tiny for his age, thin, short, and the dark circles under his eyes made Harry want to pat his back and tell him everything would be alright.
Harry gulped. He couldn’t say no. Not only would he look like a cad, but he just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to see the baby. And damn him, Malfoy knew it. He’d been had.
!” Ron accused. Harry felt his cheeks burning hotter with each word, opened his mouth, and found he couldn’t deny it. Ron’s pheromones were filling the space, angry, tasting of betrayal, and… weak. Harry hated that thought, but even Ron’s furious uncontrolled rush of scent was nothing compared to Draco’s. Harry knew, if he wanted, he could do what Draco had done to Smith. He could bring Ron to his knees without a word. Could make him stop shouting by choking him with dominant pheromones. Harry shivered at the cruel thought and pushed it away. He’d suffered Ron’s wrath before, it wouldn’t be so bad.
“She reckons I’ve done it to myself, with the potions. Says it’ll probably be a couple months, and in the meantime, I’ll just have to suffer a heat roulette every day.” Harry griped, far too hungry to mention what she’d said about keeping an Alpha in his bedside drawer for convenience. He bolted down lunch in record time, nearly matching Ron’s appetite. Hermione pointedly kept her eyes on her own plate, and Harry, feeling a bit bold, took a deeper breath, taking in the pheromones around him. He could smell it again. Stronger now. Ron and Hermione were
“So? Weasley having a fit isn’t going to stop me from fucking you.” Draco purred. Harry groaned, definitely needing a cold shower to get rid of the effects of Malfoy whispering obscenities in his ear.
"I'm sorry I married Ginny, and I'm sorry I got engaged to her without talking to you at all." Harry said. Malfoy stared at him, eyes narrowed, hands clenched together in a silent show of anger.
idea how good you feel?” Malfoy groaned, biting at his earlobe. Harry couldn’t answer. Malfoy was all the way inside him, pressing into everything that made him want to fall apart. “Fuck… Harry…” The mutter was all he heard before Malfoy couldn’t stop himself from moving. The first few thrusts were slow, testing, and then he was slamming forward, as deep and fast as he could, grinding into Harry’s sweet spot with every thrust. Malfoy’s mouth was on his, sharp teeth pulling at his lower lip, nibbling at his tongue. Harry felt his whole body tense, and he came again, trembling under Malfoy’s unceasing force of pleasure. His pounding thrusts and biting teeth and squeezing hands made Harry come twice more before his pace slowed. Harry was limp, shaking, barely able to merely hold on to the savage Alpha that drove into him, but when he pulled out, Harry whined. Wordless, keening, and needy. Malfoy growled and bit his chest again. Harry cried out at the sudden sharp pain, but then Malfoy moved, pulling Harry around, lying down so Harry was on top, straddling him.
“Oh, probably not. Pheromones are strange things, Harry. They’re stronger for those they’re meant to attract, so, unless Ron might fall in love with you, or Draco, I doubt he can smell Draco’s scent on you as well as I can.” She said breezily. Harry nodded, thinking of how Smith had clearly been able to tell he’d slept with Malfoy, well after it had happened.
“Yes. A rather clever bit of charmwork. The door reads you as you approach it, and when you touch the knob, a bit of your magic goes into the room, and makes it just what you like. It’s the same at upscale wizarding hotels.” She waved a hand dismissively, but he and Ron shared a look. How on EARTH did she know what upscale wizarding hotels were like?
“I don’t want a divorce.” She argued, but he wasn’t sure she meant it. Her voice wavered slightly, and her eyes were guarded. He gave her a pitying look, knowing she was simply saying what she thought she ought to say.
"Sure." Harry muttered, sure she'd get to the point eventually. He sipped his tea, keeping an eye on the clock as they exchanged pleasantries. She made it three whole minutes before she finally came to something of substance.
He watched the sorting without really seeing it, and after McGonagall had given her speech and the food appeared before them, Harry dug in eagerly. He hadn’t eaten since a bit of toast that morning, and felt suddenly ravenous. For a while longer, he didn’t think about what the increased hunger might mean, or the slight trickle of sweat that trailed down his neck might threaten. He focused on his potatoes, on his steak and kidney pie. He guzzled down three glasses of pumpkin juice, and ate half a dish of pudding himself.
Once, he’d been unable to imagine a future where he wasn’t married, with a gaggle of dark-haired children to call his own. He knew he could never marry Draco, that the only child he’d have wouldn’t be HIS, and in that moment, between being rolled to his back, and warm lips find their way to his own arousal, he couldn’t imagine anything more perfect than a future filled to the brim with two blonds, dancing a fine line of surreptitious pleasures, and not-too-horribly scarring the child they would raise together. It wasn’t what he’d imagined for himself, but it was perfection.
all over you! I thought it was just a coincidence the first few times, some sort of pisisng contest, like you said the other day, with Smith… But I saw him! I SAW him leaving your room this morning! And suddenly you’re not in heat! You’re
“I… er… tried. With Zacharias Smith… That’s what they were fighting over. Me.” Harry blushed, but forced the words out. “Malfoy literally chased him off, and… I’m sorry Ron, but there’s no one else in school who can…” Harry trailed off, not sure Ron would appreciate hearing any of the words he’d wanted to apply. “It’s hard, Ron, but… Right now, Malfoy’s really the only option, unless I want to spend half the next few months hiding in the hospital wing.”
, but it was warm, and kept him steady as his mouth was violated. He found his hands tangled in the front of Malfoy’s robes, and felt the hard little buttons of his white oxford shirt. He pulled at them, wanted them away from him, out of his way.
what he felt. Harry spread his legs wider, and dragged Malfoy’s lips back to his. The finger inside him was good. It was like nothing he’d ever felt, and… it wasn’t enough. Harry groaned wordlessly, his hands tugging at different pieces of pale flesh, hoping he’d hurry up and
"Malfoy… I thought you'd left the country?" He narrowed his eyes, and kept his voice steady, conversational, and a touch unwelcoming.
Malfoy inside him, but with soft lips surrounding the head of his cock, he couldn’t form the words to beg for it. All he could do was moan and arch and grab platinum hair. Malfoy’s fingers were long and slender as he slid them into Harry’s slick entrance, and Harry let out a groan of satisfaction at finally having the void inside of him filled. It wasn’t enough, but it was a start. They weren’t as filling as he needed, but they were massaging the best part, and with the mouth on top, Harry found himself at the peak in mere moments. The feel of a warm tongue lapping his climax up made him shiver, but when he looked down to see it, Malfoy was done, his head coming back up, his hips settling between Harry’s thighs. With just that sight, Harry was too hot again. He was eager for more. Eager for Malfoy to complete him. Teeth nipped at his neck as Malfoy slid slowly in, and Harry moaned, squirming, trying to take more of him in, trying to make him go faster, deeper.
“I never knew you were…” He trailed off, eyes darting around the hall suddenly wary of others listening in. “Nevermind. Talk later?” Ron asked, eyes hopeful.
He slowed his steps and walked quieter as he approached the nursery, listening as he walked, to the soft, melodic sound of that familiar voice, quietly reading a book aloud. He stepped into the room, pleased that he'd managed to sneak up on the blond. He sat in front of a cradle, his back to the door, his warm voice filling the room like a bewitching fog.
"I met his son." Harry replied with every bit of nonchalance he could muster. Hermione rolled her eyes. Harry gulped nervously. She couldn't know.
"I don't think Ginny will ask, but if she does, you can tell her where to find me. Don't bother lying for me, Hermione. I'm sick of the dishonesty in my marriage."
“I can still smell him on you, but you don’t need scum like Malfoy.” Smith’s words were spoken in a whisper against Harry’s lips. “I’ll take care of you.”
“And the pheromone suppressants between.” He admitted, feeling a bit sheepish now. Her face was going a bit red, and he wondered if she was about to explode. She took in a long, slow breath, and then let it out just as painstakingly slowly. Harry sat silently, hoping she didn’t shout at him for whatever he’d apparently done wrong. Had he been supposed to take them together?
now. We’ve never been particularly close, and I usually can’t bloody stand you, but… this can’t go on.”
you will become uncontrollable. With your heats as unpredictable as they are, the pheromones of my rut would likely set you off, and if you went into heat while I was in a rut, and we had sex, there isn’t a contraceptive potion in exsistence that could boast even twenty percent efficacy against such strong fertility magic.
“You should take suppressant potions so you can’t smell me, that way this doesn’t keep happening.” Harry said matter-of-factly. At least, he was pretty sure he had. Malfoy looked even more furious when blazing grey eyes met his.
“Shame, I was looking forward to a good game of Quidditch.” Harry bemoaned quietly. Ron nodded, and got an elbow from Hermione for not paying attention. Harry and Ron shared a look over her head, and each cracked a grin. It was almost like old times.
"Is everything alright? What did Madam Pomfrey say?" Hermione asked. Harry looked over, and past her, Ron was staring at him with an expression of confused concern, his chest expanding as his nostrils flared, taking in the scents Harry had brought with him. Harry felt his face blanch, and tried to cover his tracks.
He opened the window, cast air freshening charms and showered for far longer than he usually did. When he was dressed, and went down to breakfast, he could barely smell Malfoy’s scent on his skin at all.
He suffered another round of diagnostics, and prodding before he was finally allowed to break free. He was fairly certain she would have kept him longer if he hadn’t had a class to get to.
He moved even closer, and Harry realized they must be standing by the wall, as he suddenly found himself trapped between it and Smith. The dark brown eyes were going darker as his pupils flared, and Harry licked his lips in anticipation. He couldn’t seem to think properly. Smith smelled amazing, he was attractive, and Harry was far,
“Too big. What’s with the temper?” Ginny responded, setting two plates of toast and eggs on the kitchen table. Harry shook his head, and forced a smile as he stood.
pheromones than their average counterparts. It made them more appealing, and far more influential. Harry didn’t really understand it. He didn’t think he’d let anyone, dominant or not, boss him around.
“No.” Malfoy answered, his voice soft, and Harry felt his stomach twist at the scent that surrounded them. “It’s biting
deep, Harry came again, seeing stars as his muscles clenched around Malfoy, his whole body shivering and throbbing with the pulse of Malfoy’s climax.
He held Malfoy’s gaze as he entered him, watching his face warp with expression. There was surprise, relief, and then enjoyment. Harry moved slowly, savoring every inch of the tight heat he sank into, every soft breath from Malfoy’s lips. When he was fully immersed, he paused, the briefest moment spent marveling at what he’d done. There was no going back. Only committing, fully, to this moment, to this future. He pressed a violent kiss to Draco’s lips, and began fucking him in earnest, harsh, rough strokes that slapped skin against skin. He yanked at blond hair, forcing the head back, and sank his teeth viciously into a soft pale throat. Malfoy groaned, and Harry felt him tighten in response. He didn’t slow his pace as he snatched his wand back up, slashed at the air, rending fabric, and vanishing troublesome shoes. He tore away what little remained covering his prize, and pressed his body down onto the other, relishing the familiar feel of him, the feel of his breath heaving the pale chest against his. The feeling of hands grabbing his hair near-painfully. He could feel Malfoy's erection being pressed between their bodies, and he took pleasure in knowing he had the same effect on Malfoy as Malfoy had on him.
The buttons went easily, as did the shirt, robes, and tie. Harry was vaguely aware of crashing noises, of a hand leaving his body to flick locking charms at the door, and then the wand, and everything else, was thrown to the floor. Harry wasn’t sure when he’d gotten naked, or
Ron had just come from Hermione’s room, a pleased smile on his face, and Harry felt as if he’d been caught. The feeling worsened when Ron’s eyes landed on him, and he looked suddenly angry.
“Well… I will give you ONE strong suppressant. One bottle, Potter. For use ONLY in an emergency. You do understand what constitutes an emergency, yes?” Pomfrey lifted one severely arched brow at him, and Harry gulped.
“Oh. That. Yeah, it’s got to do with everyone’s compatibility. I only like girls, so, only girl Omegas who are interested in blokes will smell… like that to me.” Ron said.
. Harry pushed that thought away, and tried to put his question into words that wouldn't entirely humiliate him.
“No, I remembered, I just… I’m kind of trying to keep it secret.” Harry admitted, feeling a small twinge of guilt at admitting to lying to his friends. “Do you think Ron will know? He’ll go ballistic if he finds out.”
“Oh, that’s a shame.” Malfoy said in a tone that was almost disappointed. But the way his eyes flicked to meet Harry’s was an unmistakable silent gloating. He’d get Harry alone, one way or another. Harry looked away. He knew what was likely to happen if he allowed himself to be alone with Malfoy. He always seemed to get under his skin, to make him lose his sense of control, and sanity. He could never help himself when Malfoy started up. And then it always escalated…
“Bloody hell, Harry!” He exclaimed, and Hermione looked confused. Harry wasn’t sure what he’d done to make Ron react so violently, but he was covering his nose and mouth, his pupils dilated, and he looked almost as if he was in pain. Harry stood.
“I don’t imagine anyone would be able to even MOVE with the force of yours, so you probably don’t have to worry. Unless it’s another dominant.”
“I thought I wasn’t supposed to take any more suppressants?” Harry asked, only a little sarcastically.
Harry thought he should probably be angry for Malfoy chasing off a possible replacement, but the thought that Malfoy was here, for
at him since the other night. Hadn’t spoken a single word to him yet all term that hadn’t involved bare skin and frenzied actions.
“I think I’ll go to bed.” Harry finally gave up on pretending he was paying attention to the card game Hermione had been teaching them, and stood. Once he got into the hallway, he shivered in the cool night air that surrounded him, and hurried past Ron’s room, to his own door, eager for a fire and his own bed. He paused with his hand on the knob, and turned to look at the door across the hall. He couldn’t smell anything. He didn’t even know if Malfoy was even
Harry realized he was cringing by the end of it. He felt as if every word Malfoy shouted was a ball and chain of guilt dragging him to the bottom of a lake of misery. He was sure, if he hadn't cried all over Hermione, he would have started crying, just over the guilt that Malfoy's fury slapped on him. He managed to keep his reaction in check, and as Malfoy's anger outgrew words, and he stood, hands balled into fists, chest heaving from his rant, Harry thought he was still beautiful. Even furious, ready to spit vitriol, and fire, Harry couldn't be upset with his angry accusations.
He drifted to sleep and dreamt of warm skin against his, soft lips pressed to his own, scraping teeth, and the feel of bodyweight on top of him, pressing him into the mattress, heating him from the inside.
He couldn’t stop thinking of HIM. And he hated that his thoughts were pulled like gravity, constantly falling back to what he had given up…
He was lost on a sea of ecstasy, awash in the intoxicating spicy scent, and when the feeling of being stretched became almost painful, and too intense for words, Harry’s mouth opened in a silent scream, and he hugged Draco’s warm body to his chest as his final orgasm shivered to a halt. It left his eyelids feeling heavy, and his body feeling weak. He didn’t want to move. He didn’t want to speak. His eyes fluttered closed, and with the warmth of another body pressed along the length of his own, he fell into a perfectly sound slumber.
“With you… Your pheromones make me feel like I’m half in a rut already when we have sex. I imagine if I smelled you while I was in a rut, it would feel rather like jumping in front of the Hogwarts Express…”
“She’s dead. And yes, she knew. I told her about a year ago.” Malfoy said, leaving Harry reeling with shock. Whatever he’d been expecting, it hadn’t been that.
“Alright, mate?” Ron asked from beside him, catching his sour expression. Harry nodded once, and let his features relax. He could pretend he didn’t hate Malfoy. He could pretend his room wasn’t warded to keep his scent contained if he failed to take his potions. He could pretend that he was just a normal student attending school. He wasn’t a war hero. He wasn’t awakened to his own screaming nightmares almost every night. He wasn’t an Omega.
“I think I’ll have another drink.” Harry excused himself, kissing Ginny’s hair as a brief goodbye, so she’d be forced not to follow him. He heard her start up a conversation with Malfoy as he turned away. She was trying. So hard. He felt bad for not being able to give her more. But really, she’d been the one to ask him to get married. He wasn’t sure what she expected, but was certain it had included more than he’d given her.
Harry woke, groggy, his whole body throbbing as if he’d been running quidditch drills all the previous day. He felt warm, comfortable, and safe, and was disinclined to get up. The horrendous dream he’d just suffered, however, made him want a shower to wash away the very thought that Malfoy would be some perfectly acceptable Alpha to sleep with.
Hermione stepped forward and put a hand on his arm. Harry was almost jealous of the way Ron deflated a bit at the touch, turning to Hermione, taking comfort from her soothing gesture. She wasn’t an Omega, but she seemed to feel the same need to calm him down. Harry gave her an appreciative smile as she encouraged Ron to sit.
“An Alpha’s rut is like an Omega’s heat only in the loosest of senses, Potter. It’s not the same. An Omega’s heat, untreated, lasts for a week, and happens once a month…. Barring your strange circumstances, I suppose. While it’s… a bit of an impairment, you’re still able to go about your day, take classes, do your best to avoid Alphas…. An Alpha in rut gets rough. It lasts for only a couple days, and it turns us into mindless beasts. The desire to bite you, to
He ignored Malfoy whenever they had to sit together, refused to look at him, and tried his damndest to hold his own pheromones back, to not accidentally bomb poor Ron just because Malfoy is sitting there, irritating the hell out of him.
As he felt his balls tighten, and feared he'd finish too soon, he felt the change in Draco's body, the tightening of his muscles, the pitch of his voice, and the slight trembling as his climax painted their bellies. Harry kissed the satisfied blond as he came shortly after, unbothered by the slippery mess between them.
“You’re acting funny.” Ron accused, and Hermione leaned forward, placing a hand on Ron’s arm. The sight of the familiar touch made Harry’s own too-warm skin suddenly burst with heat, and he wanted -
“Harry… You smell… like…” Ron suddenly sat up, and shook his head, laughing. “Nevermind. It’s stupid. Anyway, glad you’re alright.” He looked away, and Harry noticed the tightness at the corners of his eyes, as if he wasn’t convinced by his own words. Harry felt his own lips part. Suddenly, he wanted to tell his friends, to tell them what he was suffering through, to warn them that he might be testy for the next week. He clamped his lips shut, and faced Professor Flitwick, trying once more to pay attention to the lecture.
Harry paused at the door of his house, steeling himself to go inside. He’d almost rather take down a hundred Death Eaters at once than cross that threshold, but finally, he worked up the nerve, and went in.
“Oh, worried he’ll end up liking me better, cause I’m more fun?” Harry teased, speaking the words down at the baby in his arms. The baby smiled good-humoredly, and kicked his feet as Harry spun in a circle. Malfoy lurched forward as Harry danced away, keeping his son from him, smiling at the sheer joy of holding the tiny, but somehow incredibly weighty, little person. He’d always wanted one of his own. He’d wanted to start a family. But Ginny hadn’t been ready, She’d just gotten OUT of a big family. So Harry had waited. But now, holding Scorpius, with Draco chasing after him, he felt a surge of pure emotion, and happiness. THIS was what he wanted. He wanted a baby smiling up at him as he sang off-key, and hopped repeatedly out of reach as his partner gave chase. But that wasn’t right, Draco wasn’t his partner. He’d really never been. Harry slowed, his smile falling as he kept staring at the child that looked JUST like Draco. They’d been intimate, but… they’d never been public. They’d never been honest, even with themselves.
Harry took a refreshing breath of fresh air, and could only detect the faintest hint of Alpha lingering on him. It was as good as he could hope for. He counted it as a win and went to join Ron and Hermione.
to pair off like some predetermined will of nature. You’re free to see whomever you choose, Harry. Or, no one at all, if you like!” She seemed terribly pleased with her answer, and Harry smiled, appreciating her effort. The problem was… after the previous night, he was pretty sure he’d never be able to have sex without imagining what it
“Well… It’s difficult to simply explain. It’s something most Alphas and Omegas just… learn as they develop. But I don’t like the idea of you wandering around with NO idea of what’s in store…” Hermione bit her lip, and her eyes darted to Ron, and away. Then back.
“Shame. An Alpha is probably the only thing that could make it pass more quickly.” She said in a curt no-nonsense tone. Harry recalled his first, and last conversation about the subject. Having sex with an Alpha would end his heat, but he’d risk getting pregnant.
Harry felt his cheeks darken, and grinned. He knew that not everyone knew what Ron was talking about, but the snickers from the few that did and could hear were rather humiliating. Harry held his head high and tried to ignore it. Ron’s nostrils flared and his chest expanded as if he were taking his first breath as a free man. Harry rolled his eyes, but didn’t miss the way Ron’s brows drew together, and his head turned more toward Harry, as if he’d smelled-
“Yeah. But I’ve apparently, according to Pomfrey, built up a tolerance. So… I can’t take them anymore… Unless it’s an emergency.” Harry thinks back to the previous night, still unsure whether that would have constituted an emergency. He hadn’t even
“I’m not in heat. I’m… Going to shower!” He declared, and with every ounce of his willpower, he pushed back, yanked the door open, and slammed it shut between them, shutting the Alpha and his pheromones out until he could wash the scent and the words out of his skin.
Harry snuck into History of Magic, and slid into his seat next to Hermione as casually as he was able. His red face and hard breathing from running halfway across the castle may have ruined it, but besides a few snickers, no one said anything.
They continued the tour, doing Harry’s and Hermione’s in turn, before they were invited to Neville’s and then Dean’s, and Seamus’s. It seemed everyone was eager to show off their room and how perfect it was. Hermione repeated her explanation over and over as each boy wondered about how the rooms managed to be so personal.
Harry tiptoed up to him, a smirk growing on his face as he approached. When he was close enough, he grabbed the blond, using one hand to cover his mouth, and the other to grab his arm, preventing him from grabbing his wand.
"Fine, I'm in love with you! I've BEEN in love with you,  I've just been too stupid to realize, or admit it, or whatever! The point is, you can't leave again. You can't just take Scorpius, and vanish to another country, because I swear to god, Malfoy, I WILL come after you. I'm sick of my fake marriage, and I'm sick of missing you, and I'm sick of this stupid, boring life without you in it. I can't live without you. Please don't ask me to." Harry begged, realizing that he sounded hopelessly desperate. If he was Malfoy, he would be disgusted by the sound, but the grey eyes that met his weren't full of disgust. He seemed to be considering the words, and Harry watched his face twitch through different reactions. Finally, it settled into a wary sneer.
“One of the reasons I never liked git. Around third year, when he started producing pheromones, he would smell SO awful. And he’d fill up a whole room in seconds with his stupid scent. Put everyone on edge until he learned to control it. Then he, of course, did it on purpose.”
No, Harry could barely smell it himself, there was no way Ron would be able to tell that he’d slept with Malfoy. He couldn’t even smell Ron’s scent coming from Hermione anymore, either. It would be fine, he told himself. Everything would be fine. And he would continue pretending Malfoy didn’t exist.
"I don't care what you do. " He asserted, even as he looked the other over, inspecting the changes that his three years away had brought.
“Nah. Heard he got told off fifth year, which must be true, ‘cause he hasn’t really bothered since.” Ron gave a shrug, and Harry was unable to stop the tide of memories. The overpowering crush of Malfoy’s scent. The
