"I know. Hopefully it's not as bad as we think, but..." Ron trails off and doesn't finish his sentence. He doesn't have to; Harry shares the same sentiment.
In an almost nervous, knee-jerk reaction, Harry stands. “Do you want some help?” He blurts out.
Draco Malfoy has always been inclined towards brooding. In the half-dark, flame in his face, he sits by the fireplace in a swirl of his own thoughts. Sometimes with wine in hand, catching red in the light. Other times with nothing.
“Fantastic.”
That couldn't be farther from the truth; Harry's still almost breathing too heavily to be able to speak, and he can already tell where his muscles will be aching tomorrow.
“...I think so. It would be nice.”
He snorts at that, the first thing resembling a smile on his face that Draco’s seen in days. “It was Ron’s idea. He thought it would be...calming. Being in nature and all.”
Draco red and - for some reason - sounds a little breathless. "Sure."
One hits Malfoy's midsection, causing him to recoil a little bit, the second hits his leg, and the third actually reaches Harry's goal and hits the blonde git squarely in the face.
Hermione begins. “Harry, we have something to tell you.” She threads her fingers through her daughter’s and husband’s.
Draco turns his head to look back. Even under the hood of night, Draco can make out Harry’s expression - his steady brow and focused eyes, the serious set of his mouth.
“Er-yeah. Same for me.”
“Boxed in?”
Before Harry can respond, Draco rises. “Go. Take the bed. We’re leaving early tomorrow.”
“What are you doing here?” He whispers.
Draco chews on his lip and stares deeply into his empty wine glass, as if there's something left in it.
was the one who grow up with Muggles. Baggy dress pants means they don't fit right! That's a basic rule of Muggle formal wear! Plus the color was all wrong."
(See the end of the chapter for
"I hope they don't work you too hard."
Kingsley and Robards constantly make a strange pair, no matter the context. Right now, for the example, Kingsley’s face is perfectly smooth, not ripple of any emotion other than thoughtfulness, while Robards’ face looks like a volcano about to erupt; his facial features are shifting endlessly, quivering, like molten lava is slowly moving them around, making his eyebrows bunch closer and closer together.
"Into a jazz fan? Like Arthur?"
“I didn’t expect for you to get so excited.”
to say or
“What is so funny?”
Draco waits, but Harry doesn’t say anything more. “Harry?” Draco says, gently taking Harry’s hand. Their fingers interlace, and Harry squeezes.
Draco Malfoy is a wonder.
“It’s alright, we know the way.” As she and Ron file out of the bathroom, she stops and turns back to look at him in the doorway. “Good night, Harry.”
“I don’t know!”
He's already thinking about next time and they haven't even made it out of Harry's house yet. Harry gulps. "O-okay."
“You look tired.” Draco spreads his arms. “Come. Sleep with me.”
Almost immediately after he finishes, a line forms at the donation table. Both Belle and Ava are running it now, along with one of bouncers, but even between the three of them they can't accept the checks and cash fast enough.
“You wouldn’t get lonely if you were trapped under a sheet of ice for several months out of the year?”
In the struggle, Harry’s foot somehow finds itself hooked around the back of Malfoy’s foot, which promptly makes his leg give out under them and sends the pair sprawling onto the ice Malfoy-first.
The kids get to him first.
<3 <3 <3
As they enter, dozens of eyes swivel to focus on them - but they don’t leave. Whispers erupt, some laughter, some sly looks. Malfoy speeds up his pace, nose turned up, clearly embarrassed to be seen by his adoring students in such a state.
Robards jumps in eagerly, his voice powerful and confident, "Since he escaped - which we know occurred yesterday night sometime between 9 PM and 2 AM - we've gotten several reports from our field agents posted in the at popular neo-Death Eater hangouts that their group has not only doubled in membership in a week, but is currently on the move. Several of the members have stayed in their safe houses but most of the top brass have escaped from our detection. We don't know what exactly they're planning, but we know it's coming soon. And we need to prepare. And to find Jack Willows and all of his friends."
He looks up, but his voice remains skeptical. "How do you know?"
Harry, meanwhile, can't stop laughing at the entire situation. When he tells Hermione and Ron, he can barely get two words in a row out without dissolving into giggles. When he tells Draco, in bed that night, his shoulders shake so hard from laughing that the bed shakes and the mattress springs squeak.
“We, the caretakers, do not come here often. Unless for emergencies, it is better to leave this place alone, but it’s still winter, so we may be allowed.”
“Let us go.” A click and a flash go off behind Narcissa. In the darkening air, the sudden light sends shadows sprawling up her face.
But Hermione's not convinced. "Are you absolutely sure?"
"Yes. And no?"
Harry stares. “Malfoy-”
By the end, Rose can kick off and land fairly safely, but the other children like Dominique or Lucy can't do much more than hover shakily a few inches off the ground. Teaching children isn't really Harry's strong suit - he neither actively likes nor dislikes it - but this is obviously where Draco shines. He teaches even more expressively, more animatedly, than he does with his teenage students at Hogwarts. His gray eyes shine in the dim lantern light, and Harry finds himself looking into them more often than he looks anywhere else.
"Go where?" Lucy asks, tugging on Harry's shirt.
s toward each of them.
Thankfully, the wind dies down a bit after an hour of flying. The world below Harry is white and quiet again. He’s following the Hogwarts Express’ route, though its last trip of the year was yesterday morning - bringing Hogwarts students back home for the holidays.
Draco remembers. He cannot forget. His bated breath, all of Sixth Year, anticipating, dreading the sign to proceed. Watching his childhood home become a slaughterhouse, a torture chamber with too many rooms to hide in and not enough doors from which to escape - clinging onto whatever scraps of hope he could find that someday, one way or another, it will all be over.
"Professor Malfoy!"
Slowly, Harry shakes his head. “I didn’t marry her.”
He shakes the thoughts way with minor success, mostly because he’s tired and drunk and ready for the peace of sleep. His sheets are warm and smell nice - like lavender. He’s grateful that Kreacher changes them regularly, because Merlin knows what state they would be in if laundry were his responsibility.
"It's...uh...warmer there, or something?"
"I am."
“No,” Malfoy’s hand catches Harry’s, “You misunderstand. It looks good.”
He is tired, too.
“This is an amazing honor. Thank you. But I can’t accept this alone.” She looks out at the audience - specifically at the row of people in front of Harry.
“Yes.”
Shaking his head, Draco replies, “No, you don’t understand. Then Mother started to talk about her childhood and what it was like growing up with Bellatrix and Harry, it was
Draco turns the tap off and pauses. “Harry.”
Harry doesn’t speak much and is even less inclined to laughter. As the days pass, the colour in his face drains paler and paler. His cheeks grow gaunt, and the shadows deepen.
Harry shakes off his thoughts. “I’m alright. How’s the term so far?”
He busies himself - there is much to be done with the end of winter. He fills the watering hole. He readies the food stores. He sharpens and resharpens his dragonhide tools, as the end of hibernation means a mass shedding of old scales and skin.
“I work here. I am going to be your guide.”
Robards moves on to the next group. "Hughes and Edwards, both of you too will continue the work you've been doing with researching the group as well as looking into whether or not similar movements abroad are in contact with Jack Willows' people." Harry can't help but to stiffen at the mention of Keith Edwards. He's nothing but a bloody wanker with a death wish, and Harry is close to granting it for him. Edwards' partner may be Mackenzie Hughes, a well-mannered woman who pays attention even at the 9AM staff meetings, but he's closer with a group of other cronies of his - most of them white, male field agents - who regularly go around the office terrorizing people - mainly focusing on Harry. He's a bigot and a bully, and the fact that Robards still keeps him around and protects him is testament enough to his own character.
“Yeah, yeah.”
Percy and Audrey, after sharing a look, speak up. "We're willing to watch them while you all go," Audrey announces. Out of all the partners that Molly and Arthur's children have chosen, Harry still thinks that Audrey is the strangest, and he's thought that way since the first time Percy brought her to the Burrow to meet the family. And he doesn't mean it in a derogatory way towards her, in fact, it's the very opposite. She's beautiful: dark skin, hair, and eyes, full eyelashes, high cheekbones, an elegant, flat nose, and an amazing figure. That was the first thing everyone noticed about her - her modelesque aesthetic - but the second thing was even better: her personality. When she speaks, her voice flows like molten gold, and when she directs that speech towards you, it completely captivates your attention. Kind, patient, and independent, Harry even had a small crush on her for a few days, before he had no choice but to squash it once it became clear that her bond with Percy was unbreakable.
They have lunch, and then begin their climb.
Mal-Draco steps forward and bows, startling Harry. For a moment, he had completely forgotten that he had come here with him - the blonde was so quiet.
“If there aren’t any questions, we mobilize now.” Kingsley finishes the meeting and the Aurors practically stampede out of the room, voices overlapping and growing volume as they all try to consult with each other and shout orders at the same time. Robards leaves to try to herd them toward the elevator and the apparition point.
When Harry steps off the lift onto his floor, he's greeted with what has become a familiar sight the past few months; a department in chaos, papers strewn everywhere, Patronuses darting in and out of the walls, delivering important information left and right, and a few Aurors sleeping on makeshift beds that Robards had no choice but to cram in the main lobby area due to the sheer number of Aurors who have had to sleep over at work. A few of them wave to him as he passes - one of them being Ron.
“Hm?” The colors flashing on the screen distract him momentarily. “Oh, hullo.”
Once again, she garners a standing ovation. Ron takes Harry’s hand and squeezes. Harry looks over, and sees his best friend is crying. He squeezes back.
“Hi.”
In front of them lies the campsite: three squat cottages, a firepit, and an outhouse. “
“Come on - it’s your turn!” Teddy points out, chipper.
” At that, Harry wrenches his hands out of Hermione’s grip and sits down at the table. It’s already been set, and steam rises enticingly from the pot of soup in the center. Harry turns his head to ask Hermione about the food and spots Ron sneaking up on her. He flashes an urgent look at Harry, and he knows what he must do.
Climbing the horizon, a glint of metal - a familiar car. It approaches slowly, the air around it wavering like Draco’s heart.
"I was just about to come get you."
Draco scoffs at this. "I suppose I have Teddy, but other than that, no." He shrugs off his coat, folds it, and rolls up the sleeves of his shirt. "Part of my sentence after the War was community service, and I chose to serve a Muggle War orphanage. And I've been there ever since." He says it so casually, almost in a throw-away line, an
"Would Master like me to owl the Ministry then?
“Is this the conference you were talking about?” Andromeda inquires.
“Sure, you were nervous, but you were still
“Hey.”
The other, a boy dressed in black robes with a green trim also introduces himself. “I’m Lucas. He, him, his. I’ve heard a lot about you.”
"You must have quite a talent for it, especially since they hired you. What's the name of the club? I'd love to come and watch you sometime."
Harry thinks bitterly. He closes the file and tosses it back onto his desk in disgust.
A moment later, Harry understands the insinuation and blushes. “N-no!”
“I think that’s it.” Harry sets the last scroll down next to the neatly stacked pile he and Malfoy have created.
Draco prays Harry passes over the vial, which he forgot to stow away.
They walk out together, to the apparition point. Harry could use the Floo, but the journey through the flames and dust has been upsetting his stomach the last few times he’s done it. He blames age.
Hermione frowns in disappointment. "Alright. I respect that. But I'll second you, Arthur, I would be very interested in reading it when you finish."
The photos associated with the suspected Death Eaters are blurry, the figures in them dark and shadowy. They seem less of an accurate tool for identification and more of the photographer’s best attempt at capturing a vague human form. Nothing much is listed in the description section - some estimates of their heights, weights, and some distinguishing features like the missing finger on the left hand of one of the suspects.
"I think it's intermission," Hermione explains to the group, "He'll come back in fifteen or so minutes."
Charlie looks over, concern etched on his face as well. “I think you’ve had enough, Draco.”
Hermione doesn't hesitate to jump up. "Speaking of Draco..."
She thinks for moment and answers, “I think that should be okay.” Then, she places a hand on Rose’s head and asks her, “Is next Saturday okay with you? Christmas Eve?”
Night passes. When it leaves, Harry rises silently, makes breakfast, eats some, puts the rest under a heating charm for when Draco wakes up later, and leaves for work.
“What?”
He’s not much different from the last time Harry saw him -
Harry grunted in response, chugging his coffee.
“And finally,” Hermione concludes, “I want to thank Harry Potter.” Dozens of sets of eyes land on Harry, but he doesn’t squirm. “Our success is in no small part due to you. Thank you, thank you, thank you for your generosity. For being on the front lines with us.” She raises the medal again, its gold surface scattering light all over the place. “This award belongs to all of you! There’s still much to do, but for now, we can celebrate!”
Looking closely, there are dried tear tracks on Angelica’s face. Her voice is shaky when she speaks. “We’re alright. We all made it out. Listen-” she reaches out and gently grabs the front of his robes, “do you know where Draco is?”
Harry’s heart plummets. “Oh-no-please, please don’t apologize. Lucas, you did nothing wrong, I promise. It’s my fault for getting so worked up.”
Although a little taken aback, Harry tries to help him by describing exactly what he felt during the performance. At the end, Draco scans his notes and mumbles to himself. Harry doesn't feel like he felt anything groundbreaking or interesting, but Draco seems totally invested and engrossed.
“You didn’t understand anything did you.” Malfoy says it more like a statement than a question. He can’t hide his smug grin.
If she recognizes the name at all, she doesn’t show it. Usually Muggles aren’t a problem, but Harry has encountered the occasional person who had vaguely heard of him and would be convinced that he was some lesser-known celebrity. “Nice to meet you. Friend of Draco’s?”
but his mouth refuses to open. Everyone around him has frozen: Hermione, the members of Wizengamot, the old man who delivered Malfoy’s sentence - everyone except for Malfoy and the men dragging him away. Malfoy’s eyes snap up to meet Harry’s just as the doors slam shut in front of his face.
authority on the matter.
"Master, you'll be late to work."
This is the life Draco chose, the one he chooses, rising from his bed, every single day.
“Yes, Glyder Fawr is the forebearer of all the dragons in Snowdonia. And she has been sleeping for a millennia.”
“Yeah.”
With one last look at Draco's prone outline and his mop of messy blonde hair sticking out from the blankets, Harry leaves the room and lets the door click softly shut behind him.
Harry notices out of his periphery that a few of the spectators have been creeping closer, while the rest - mostly the children - have stayed back.
Draco exhales slow and steady. “You thought you could wait it out,” he repeats.
They sit, unspeaking, for a little while. Something cold has settled around them, like an autumn fog.
Words brim at the top of Harry’s tongue, threatening to spill like froth after a wave, but for some reason, nothing gets out.
Often, Harry doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry after binge reading those articles. Laugh at the absurdity of it all? At the foolish way the media is running itself to the ground with its overactive imagination? Or cry because of how far they are from the truth, and how close they are to Harry’s fantasies?
Draco clenches his jaw. He flings back the covers, grabs his coat, stamps across the cottage, and throws the back-porch door open. By the light creeping out from behind him, he sees a figure - just one - sitting a little ways off in the distance. It turns and faces him.
Harry directs his attention back to the table just in time to see Molly taking out an enormous jug of tequila and setting it on the table. It’s the jug that she saves for special occasions, mostly pregnancy announcements. “Let’s celebrate!” Bill, Ron, George, and Ginny cheer and drain whatever liquid’s remaining in their cups in preparation. She doesn’t waste any time in divvying out the alcohol to most everyone, occasionally pouring too much, causing some to spill on the tablecloth.
Between them, Draco’s left arm burns.
Harry sits back into his chair. “Wow, that’s…” He runs his fingers through his hair. “That’s incredible. Congratulations.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry watches some neighborhood children, dressed up in puffy winter coats and caps, play around in the snow. A few are working together to build what looks to be a snow fort and a few others are lugging a sled down the street -
"Really? He's never brought anyone here? Never mentioned anyone?"
Molly seems confused by the sudden change in conversation too. "Th-thank you, dear. Eat up, there's plenty left."
“Yes, Potter, you did. Several nights in a row, in fact.”
"Will that be cash or credit?"
“It’s fine.”
Spotty hoots sharply at Harry from the window. Upon noticing the small bit of parchment tied to her leg, Harry throws back his covers and practically sprints over.
Finally, only the last partner pair remains - Jenny and Ash. Robards opens his mouth and draws in another breath to give them their orders, but Kingsley cuts him off, stunning most everyone.
Just as Draco predicted, they reach the cottages just as the sun is slipping into the mountain’s pocket and casting the sky in orange and the hills in gold.
But it’s not a listening ear, either. Not yet, at least.
“Belle,” Draco begins to introduce her to them, “these are-”
With the sun gone, the cold quickly encroaches - the last breath of winter - but the men lay comfortably, basking in their warming charms. It’s the last night of their trip, so they’ve brought out the liquor and the wine.
Harry doesn't try to dodge it this time - only turning around to let the snow hit his back. Luckily, he doesn't feel much through his coat other than a soft thud of impact, but he suspects it'll be a different story once they accumulate and soak through. He has to be careful and win this game quickly.
“I-” For a gripping, terrifying moment, Harry thinks he’s going to be turned down, but Malfoy continues to surprise him at every turn. “-okay.”
He's right where Harry left him, not having moved even an inch. When Harry comes in, he diverts his attention from a particularly gruesome troll tooth wall decoration to Harry.
bathroom at Grimmauld Place.
Gray eyes flutter open.
Just as he has that thought, a Muggle car lumbers over the horizon.
They fall silent, and Harry’s dozing off when Draco whispers, “I love you.”
The air is tense when Harry walks into the conference room. No one is sitting, preferring to instead lean against the walls, arms crossed, and eyes darting from Auror to Auror. Ron glances at him when he comes in, but looks away as soon as he recognizes who it is. Harry tries to appear unaffected.
“A-Angelica.”
Sophia shouts with what seems to be a mouthful of snow, "Retreat for now and regroup!"
“Since
“Thanks for all your help. See you in two weeks, Draco?” Malfoy nods. “Merry Christmas, then. And to you, too.” She smiles at Harry.
Harry lets him finish. "As I was saying," he continues, "I don't want us to become...toxic to each other. But I absolutely don't want to break up. I..." He flushes and struggles to speak. "I want to be with you."
“At the jazz club? What about the orphanage?”
Now, he walks on, his eyes focused on where his feet touch the rocks, and the stars wheeling above.
Not answering immediately, Malfoy brushes back the strands of hair that had shaken loose from his usual slicked-back style. “I’ll...see. I’m only here for a week more, after all, the curriculum is tight, and I have my own research taking up all my freetime.”
Walker holds her partner close, “You were incredible, Draco.”
They clean and pack up, and Draco isn’t allowed to help. So he goes to sit on the beach, pleasantly dry and warmed by the sun at his back - its light turning the dark sea to pale blue. Terns play in the surf, outrunning the tides, and gulls circle and cry across the frothing waves.
Hermione, who is seated on the bed a little ways off, laughs and shakes her head. "I have to agree with Ginny on this one."
Thankfully, they take pity on him and stop asking questions. “Oh. Okay! I’m Sophia,” the curly-haired girl with a Hufflepuff scarf hanging off her chair says while extending a hand. Harry shakes it hesitantly. “My pronouns are she, her, and hers.”
Harry Potter opens his mouth to say something else, but Neville Longbottom interrupts him: “A-are you here for a tour as well, Malfoy?”
"Mate...."
"Anyways, I wish I could go but apparently it's supposed to be Muggles-only."
He approaches Edwards cautiously, wand drawn. "Edwards? What the fuck are you doing here?"
failure.”
“Take me here. Spill me everywhere. I don’t want this.” Draco clutches the vial tighter. “I want something different.”
“I can’t take these,” Harry finds himself protesting.
"Harry," its voice is deep and smooth - Kingsley's - "Emergency meeting, now." The Patronus dissipates. The Muggles around them are rendered wide-eyed and speechless. Without any warning, Draco quickly and efficiently sends
She raises her voice slightly for the first time the entire conversation. “Because you scared the shit out of us and we don’t want it to ever happen again!”
He looks away and off behind Harry, at the rest of the club. "Saying things like that so...seriously."
Harry ponders his argument, which seems logical, but it still makes his gut twist.  But since Malfoy's asking....
"Potter?"
"Hey."
piece the whole way.
Ron sighs and flushes the toilet, which Harry only just now realizes is full of vomit.
Harry tries to scream,
Puffing out her chest, she takes his hand and shakes it heartily. The rest of his team has gather around him now, and Harry's team has done the same. The line they've stopped at seems to be the halfway mark between where their wands now lie in two heaps at the two ends.
“We think they are set to hatch this year. And no, that is their aunt. In this particular species, the family members take turns guarding the brood during hibernation. Last year, one of their mothers kept watch.”
“You’ve already told me,” Draco says.
Draco sighs. “How long?”
“Oh? How would you know?”
“Yes, Harry?”
“Everyone does this, Harry.”
“Hello, Potter.”
"How didn't you know that, Sophia?" Stella asks, shocked.
Lucas straightens up a little more. “Yes. I do.”
“It’s oka-”
Months ago, Draco would have heard only pity in his voice. But he knows, now, that Harry has always been sincere, and it was Draco who was afraid to listen too deeply.
Harry blushes, feeling a bit awkward now with the attention focused on him. Not everyone in the room is paying attention to their conversation, so it's really just the attention of Draco and Hermione, but the two are a formidable combo to face. "Er, I asked around? I knew I wanted something music-related, so I just went to every shop and asked. The storekeep at Ursa's hadn't been able to sell that for months, so she was pretty relieved when I came in."
“Mmph?” Harry’s arms, thrown around Draco, tighten and his face pinches.
“It was….amazing.” The flavor was perfect. “Just like what my dad used to make.” Harry’s gone a little choked up without him realizing it. Teddy and Draco and Andromeda give him warm looks, and Harry steals the last bit of fish.
"Yes, please." Harry sits up, takes the tray, and places it in his lap. The food smells good; Kreacher's baking has always been a point of pride for him, and anyone who tries his wares immediately knows why.
Harry looks down. It’s Rose, clinging to his pant leg.
“Don’t you dare! Keep ‘Potter’ so we still get all the discounts.”
“Glyder Fawr. The fifth highest mountain peak in Wales - to Muggles, at least. You will see when we arrive, it will be worth the effort.”
No, only the press is there, still circling and circling after so many years, never tiring of the chase. They clamor at the cemetery fence, a cacophony of camera shutters, interview requests, and frantic reporting.
Harry isn’t sure how he should tell him the truth of being an Auror. He isn’t even sure if he
The tea warms Harry’s hands as he chuckles and reflects on his time in Hagrid’s class, trying not to die by Flobberworm. “I heard Neville’s working here now?” Hermione had told him, obviously hopeful that they would reconcile.
"Why did we carry the books by hand all those times when we have
“Are you really so nervous? You’ve known each other since childhood.”
Big, big thanks to everyone who left kudos + all the nice comments on my work - I see you, I've read them all, and I appreciate you more than you know.
“We’re volunteering at the pound! Sorry, Draco, we’ll talk to you next time,” Angelica yells on her way out, letting the door slam.
Although he's almost literally being pulled in five separate directions, Draco maintains a smile as he tries to fulfill all of their requests at once.
Harry nods, but says nothing.
Finnigan speaks up: “But not now, right?”
“None of your business.”
Draco's blushing so hard that he's visibly sweating again now. He avoids eye contact with Harry and instead stubbornly stares down at the table cloth.
much to drink.”
Bill lets out a low whistle. "And how many children do they oversee?"
The curtains are still drawn tight, so the room is dark and cool, but it's beginning to feel suffocating rather than comforting. With a wave of his hand, Harry uses wandless magic for the first time in a month to open the curtains. Light floods in. It's not snowing, but the clouds have gathered close in the sky, hinting at it. In the distance, Harry sees the roofs of his neighbor's house - all mostly frozen over and covered in snow. Their trees have lost all their leaves, and now their naked branches stand out in dark brown dashes, hooks, and exclamations stark against the white snow.
"Congratulations," Draco tells them through the chaos, smiling at them warmly. "Have you told Rose?"
Harry breathes out a long breath. “Yeah. Yeah, you’re right. Should’ve thought of that.”
After briefly squeezing Harry’s hand, Draco marches off toward a gaggle of Aurors in the distance, ignoring the jeers from the reporters and wiping at his face.
“You’ve really thought this through.”
“I would love to, Potter, but I’m afraid I cannot. With spring approaching, I am going to be quite busy here.”
Then, Longbottom asks him a question regarding the wild grass bordering their trail, and their conversation carries them. Without prompting, Longbottom shares that he is an Herbology professor at Hogwarts now, and he takes special interest in flora native to the Isles, aiming to research some particularly rare species. Draco entertains him, and before long the sun is high, and they’ve reached the foot of the mountain.
I wish I could tell you that I wrote down and remembered the specific Clementi piece that I was drawing off of in this chapter but alas...I am Boo Boo The Fool....But seriously though pretty much all of Clementi's pieces are upbeat so if that's your cup of tea then I'd suggest looking him up!
“Yeah, yeah,” Draco grumbles. He moves a rook. “But if you’re old, what does that make me?”
“Draco! Harry!” A muffled voice calls - Walker, Draco thinks.
“Wuzzat?” Weasley bursts out as Longbottom wakes him.
“Ron, we play the same instrument. I don’t think that her intention is for us to sound exactly the same. She was talking nonsense about how my violin and Malfoy’s piano playing intertwined or something,” Harry made air quotes around the word ‘intertwined’ like it was the most ridiculous word ever. Which it sort of was. And people only said intertwined when they were talking about something...illicit.
“Actually, you can’t. It’s past lights out. I’ll go to McGonagall. Or better yet, Snape,” Draco sneered at the look on Potter’s face. He ran a hand through his own unruly, dark hair and sneered back at Draco.
Once others around him woke up and began their morning routine, Harry also “woke up,” sitting in bed and realizing he didn’t know exactly what the morning routine would be like. How does Malfoy get ready? How long does he spend in the mirror perfecting his hair and robes? Will he be suspicious if he does something out of the norm? Harry settled to pretend he was too tired to get up until most of the Slytherins had left, and then attempt to style hair. Midway through, Harry realized he literally did not know why he was bothering with this when his mission was to go straight to Ron and Hermione and ask them for help. Surely then he wouldn’t need to be hiding this from anyone. The professors would help him out of this mess. Right?
“Maybe detention,” she said, smiling sideways at him. Draco could deal with detention.
“You coming, Draco?” he asked. Harry shook his head.
“And what, did you think I was okay parading around with Granger and the Weasleys? Did you think I enjoyed wearing your stupid clothes?” Malfoy scoffed and began laughing, like this was all a joke. No, actually, he began laughing like he was going insane. Or maybe he was laughing at what he looked like with Harry’s hair. Harry did not find this all very funny. He decided to do the right thing, and march his way to the hospital wing like he should have the second he woke up in the Slytherin dorms. But Malfoy gripped his wrist so tight his fingers began to fall asleep.
But tonight Harry dreamt of a large home, where surely the wealthy lived. But it was so dim and sad, that Harry didn’t want to enter. Somehow the place felt so familiar to him, as soon as he entered, he turned and went upstairs as if he knew exactly where he was going. He ended up in a bare bedroom, larger than Harry was used to, quite obviously. There was a big bed and it seemed void of life. Most likely a guest bedroom, he supposed. Until he saw in a corner a wide desk. Inspecting the drawers, he realized this was the bedroom of a teenager around his age. There were open letters and potion ingredients and other kinds of clutter scattered around. Harry hadn’t quite put the pieces together until he read one of the fancy envelopes, which was addressed to the Malfoy Manor. This was Draco Malfoy’s bedroom. Where he spent his Christmases and his summers and where he grew up. This is where Lucius Malfoy lived, and Malfoy’s mother. Harry couldn’t help but wonder why this room was so lifeless, so void of, well, Draco. At the Weasley house, you could pretty much tell who slept in what bedroom. Each bed was different, and so was each wall. Every room had a personality in that house, and was also full of life, just like Hogwarts. But the Malfoy Manor felt so pristine that even the air was stale. Harry felt uncomfortable, and he suddenly awoke from his dream.
“What happened? Why did you follow him?” she pestered. More questions flew from her mouth but Draco only focused on the potion, making sure it was the right color and temperature. When she finally ceased, Draco turned to her with a grin.
“Wait, we aren’t choosing our own partners? And she’s pairing up you and Malfoy? Clearly she must know it’s gonna be a disaster,” Ron laughed. “Don’t worry. You two will have a wand fight and Villareal will realize the mistake she made and pair us up together.”
So now, Harry was walking down a random corridor, not quite interested in joining the Slytherins for lunch. He figured he’d head down to the kitchens later and ask the house elves for leftover food. Or he did figure that, until he heard the familiar screech of Pansy Parkinson behind him.
“What?” he asked, his hand still on the doorknob, itching to leave this awkward situation. Malfoy took a breath and opened his mouth, but he didn’t say anything. Instead, he just looked down. Harry decided to take that moment to, again, try to leave.
Draco stopped suddenly, clinging onto a loose brick so he didn’t fall from the sudden surprise. He willed his voice to come, so he could find an excuse to have been up there. All he could do was turn around with a terrified look on his face, praying that his demeanor would come back to protect him. A foot and a leg was there, along with an arm that gripped a wand. “Who’s there?” Draco demanded, finding his voice back. The person stepped down one step and there he stood.
“Malfoy, can’t we figure this out in the morning? It’s late,” Harry tried to reason. Malfoy didn’t reply. Harry, his head dropping with exhaustion, had a sleep-deprived idea. He grabbed the parchment from Malfoy’s hand, and before Malfoy could realize what he was doing, recited the spell on himself and Malfoy. The same feeling from before filled Harry, and when he looked at Malfoy, his mouth dropped.
“I don’t think I’ve heard that one before. What’s it called?” Harry’s voice piped up. Draco pursed his lips, and sat up straight.
“Heroic Harry Potter, now going to play a musical instrument on Monday. Good luck. I bet whatever you chose to play, it’ll be almost as horrible as your Quidditch playing,” Draco said, holding his chin high. Potter just gave him an annoyed look before turning away to walk down the stairs. Draco desperately did not want to follow him, but he had no choice. Potter chose to ignore Draco’s snide comments as they strode down the hallway. He nearly ran into the boy when Potter stopped dead in his tracks.
“I dreamt about such a small, tight space, that I began to feel claustrophobic. It was dusty and horrible in there,” Malfoy said. Harry saw the realization in his eyes soon after. “Is there where your home is?”
-Tuesday
“I came to practice,” he said finally. Malfoy was silent. Apparently, he decided not to mention the fact that Harry’s violin was nowhere to be seen.
“You do feel a little warmer than usual. But you should get some food in you. You’re skinnier than me!” Pansy grabbed his hand and locked her fingers with his, pulling him along. Holding hands felt very weird to Harry, but he didn’t know whether or not he should pull away. What does Malfoy usually do?
“What do you think you’re doing?” Draco asked, walked up to him. Potter turned around quickly, seeming scared to see Draco there.
Most of the books Harry found weren’t related to effects or the making of potions. Somehow the only ones he seemed to pull out talked about potions professors, makers, or masters. Meanwhile, Malfoy was handling two armfuls of books that he’d scattered around a desk he’d claimed. Harry sat down with him, picked up the least intimidating book he saw, and began flipping through the pages. Within seconds he’d reached the end, and had clearly retained nothing. Malfoy gave him an unimpressed look.
Violins were something Draco didn’t think he could handle. Firstly, he didn’t think he had the willpower to hold up that block of wood for however long a song was. Secondly, it looked too complicated what with the turning of the wrist and specific strings to hold down. Draco much preferred the simplicity of the piano, how each note was laid out in front of you, nothing hidden or any talents you needed to possess. Just knowing how to read music and measures was all you needed for the piano, at least in Draco’s simple mind.
“Just wandering. I’m not feeling well today, Pansy,” he muttered. She stopped walking and look at him, her head tilted like a puppy. She had a concerned look written on her face, and before Harry knew it, her hand was warm and soft against his forehead. He froze.
“Potter!” a shrill whisper came from the entrance of the common room. Harry was pulled away from the fire and his thoughts, to investigate. It was Malfoy, obviously. Who else would ask for Potter in the Slytherin dorms? Malfoy pulled on his robes and out into the corridor they went.
“Oh, and our voices! I sound like you, and that’s apparently what I sound like,” Malfoy made a face. “I can kind of see why people call me snide, now.” Harry couldn’t help but just nearly laugh at that.
“Of course, Ron. If I wet myself, you don’t talk about your crush in your sleep,” he retaliated. Ron shoved his shoulder, Harry shoved back, and Hermione had to walk between them, just like every day. “Since you didn’t notice, Malfoy bumped into me when I was putting the ingredients away. We both got potions spilled on us. He was a lot more disgusted than he should have been, anyway.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“My father would be horrified that his only son wouldn’t be able to carry on the family name.” A grin was plastered on his face at the thought.
Later that evening, while the trio sat at Gryffindor table and ate their dinners, Leo Parks walked up to Harry with an expected look and some parchment perched onto a book.”Well?” he asked. Harry had forgotten all about it after HoM, but decided he would sign the petition anyway. He abandoned his homework and began writing his name, before another caught his eye. ‘Draco Malfoy’ was written in thin and cursive handwriting. Harry sneered at the name, but wrote anyway. Hopefully enough people signed that there would be multiple periods, and Harry wouldn’t be stuck with the Slytherin. Ron and Hermione signed as well, appearing to not notice Malfoy’s name. Leo stood very excitedly, nearly bouncing on his feet as they all signed.
The most important thing to remember when making this potion, Harry recalled, was to not mix any tools or ingredients with another person’s potion. He had sectioned off his own side of the table, separate from where Ron was likewise struggling with his own potion. Hermione was sat behind them next to Neville, mumbling tips to all three. Harry felt guilty that she had always had to help them out, but she seemed pleased enough to feel like the smartest out of them all.
“You act like we’re going to be like this for a long time. I’m going to do some research and see why we haven’t changed back. If you want to join me in the library maybe you can be of some use if you ever want to talk to your friends again, because I’m not going to be seen associating with a mudblood and a blood traitor,” he snapped. This time it was Harry’s turn to glare.
“Are you with someone? I thought I could hear a voice, are you alright? You know it’s late, Draco.” Harry could hear the voice getting closer and began to panic.
“That was amazing!” she shouted, giggling and clapping her hands together ecstatically. Malfoy and Harry simply shared an unnerved look. Their professor reminded Harry of a young girl who just discovered the newest warlock boy band. She was constantly eager about everything, sickly positive towards everybody no matter how they treated her, and she seemed so lovesick. “You two young boys are so talented, your practice has paid off wonderfully! And what a wonderful idea, practicing together. I sense you knew about the duo and trio performances we will be having here at Hogwarts!” She squealed and clapped again. “I may have let it slip to a few students. I’m just so excited about it! You two are definitely going to be paired together.” Professor Villareal looked up to the ceiling and tapped her chin, walking back and forth. Meanwhile, Harry and Malfoy were still so completely startled and dumbfounded that they’d hardly said a word.
“You’re being ridiculous,” Draco said, taking another sip. He tapped his fingers against the fake leather of his chair, feeling extremely uneasy. “Maybe I’ll tell you what really happened. The Harry Potter you’re seeing today is just a clone. I actually stuffed the real Harry Potter in a closet because of his insolence,” Draco smirked. Pansy and Blaise laughed, but didn’t seem fooled. Draco looked at Pansy and tried his best to give her an I’ll-explain-later look. She seemed to understand and began to question Blaise on the frayed end of his quill. Draco snickered as he held his head in his hands.
of everyone in the department. Aurors preach against hate, against discrimination, but a few of Harry’s coworkers still pull the corner of their eyes back when Kingsley’s not looking at staff meetings and Harry
“V-very well, then.” Draco steps back and awkwardly leans against a counter. He tears his eyes away from Harry’s back and the muscles there, how they work as he dries and reaches up, into the cabinet.
It’s long after class has ended, and Harry and Malfoy have been sitting in silence for the past hour, silently grading the homework assignments the students had turned in. Despite the violent storm last night, the day so far has proved to be surprisingly nice - through the window Harry hears the jubilant cheers of students as they romp and play in the snow.
A distant sound rolls through the valley. “Yes,” Draco says. “It is.”
Their full-grown parents or family members are unable to help, either, as their size and the nature of their claws do not lend themselves to sensitive operations. They cannot help their children hatch, lest they risk crushing the entire egg - baby and all.
"Bring it."
They apparate home - a squat two-story in a fishing village not too far from London. Harry still owns 12 Grimmauld Place - he doesn’t think he could ever bring himself to sell it - but he never wants to live there again. It’s a chapter of his life that has closed.
Harry taps his pen to his lips in thought.
"Would Master like me to open the curtains?"
Harry leans over and presses a kiss to his cheek. "Thanks." Without waiting for his reaction, Harry sweeps out the restaurant, finds an alleyway, and apparates.
Draco stands so quickly the chair topples over. The glass vial in his pocket weighs like stones. When he speaks, he only manages a whisper: “That’s quite enough. I must ask you to leave now, Potter, so we both may get some sleep.”
Malfoy nods and extends a hand to her. "Pleasure playing with you, Stella."
and it’s just.” He pauses to take a breath. “Not the same.”
When sleep finally finds him that night, a strange dream comes with it.
“Here,” he says, rolling up his sleeves, “Let me help with that.”
Draco tightens his grip on the straps of his pack. “A whim.”
Harry’s in the process of rubbing his bleary eyes and making his way to the Great Hall for breakfast when he glimpses a tall, blonde man turn the corner in front of him. He whips around to see Malfoy practically jogging down the hall with his head down.
He sets up several lanterns around him for light, and inspects the eggs. They are close indeed - one or two are showing significant webbing, the film inside showing through the cracks.
The wind grows warm, and the days lengthen, and before Draco properly stops to take it in, spring passes into summer. The tour groups come - families and couples fleeing the cobblestoned Wizarding world. Draco takes them up and down the mountains. He leads them wading through the rapids, and he shows them the best, shadowy respites from the beating sun.
Grinning, Ginny winks at him. "Trust me, you look better like that."
She gives them a smile, smug smile. “I did, did I? What do you think, Harry?”
Draco nods.
Setting his cup on the table, Harry stands too. “Good plan.”
"What the fuck," Harry breathes, looking down at him and his pitiable form on the ground.
"Thank you for coming on such short notice, during such a busy time," Kingsley begins, surveying the room. There's a flicker of pity in his eyes. "This will be quick, I promise."
Draco looks at Harry with a fondness in his eyes so intense that Harry thinks he might just break in half. Wordlessly, they gather each other into their arms and don’t let go.
"Perfect. And may I inquire about your family’s brooms?"
Harry feels a sudden rush of empathy for her, but also for Draco. More often than not now, Harry also finds himself choosing to rush home instead of spending time with his loved ones. "He can be stubborn, but I promise he's a good guy."
“I talked with this young gentleman and this lovely lady during intermission,” she says, gesturing to Harry and Hermione - not with a point of a finger, but with a wave of her hand.
Cups go up full and are set down empty again. The tequila lingers in Harry’s throat as a slight burning sensation, but he bears it. More shots, more conversation, more talk of the pregnancy - minutes seem to pass, or maybe hours? The burning sensation has moved down, lower and lower until it reaches his stomach, warming it up. Lucy is asleep. It might be Harry’s imagination, but it seems like, for every shot he takes, Draco takes two more. Even through the thickening fog settling in his mind, Harry feels concern for him.
Harry looks up. It’s Ron.
“The piano is simple to me. All you have know is what the keys are named and when to play them. One of my many talents is being coordinated,” he said with a smirk. “And besides, my grandmother used to let me play when I was little. She was extremely gifted with the piano.” He smiled to himself and Harry was silent, shuffling his fingers together and apart.
Draco looked through the form for Music Lessons, feeling content as he sat facing the crackling fire in the dungeons. Pansy Parkinson stood next to him, reading over his shoulder. It was quite irritating, but today Draco was determined he wouldn’t snap at anyone (even Harry Potter), for today was a day to celebrate. He would finally be learning to play an instrument, one of his items on “Draco Malfoy’s Top Secret Bucket List”. “Pansy, where’s your form? And what instrument are you signing up for?”
“Mind your business,” Draco said, and then in a point to prove that he knew what he was doing, immediately struck out a song, his hands flying across the piano, but none of the notes sounded right. His fingers dances across the piano, but to him, they looked lanky and like they didn’t know where they were going. The notes that were once clear and filled with melody sounded wobbly and each one sounded to him like a different person crying. He stopped playing and pretended to flip through his sheets.
“Well,” Harry started. Malfoy’s shoulders tensed, and he looked up as if finally realizing exactly who was in the room with him.
Harry’s dreams usually were dark or empty, ever since he could remember. The cold and cramped space of the cupboard under the stairs where he’s lived practically forever never had enough room for any happiness. The dim and blank space he spent most of his time in represented how he felt inside for many of his young years. Hogwarts brought so much life and energy to him that soon his dreams were filled with magic, quite literally. His first year at the school made even sleep exciting, and when he realized he had to go back to his aunt and uncle’s house, he couldn’t even be sad, but instead felt excitement to return to Hogwarts. It was such a drastic change always feeling positivity.
“You’ve been on edge ever since you came back early from your piano practice yesterday. Did something happen?” Pansy joined them, and Draco was about to retort when she spoke as well.
“Earlier today, I went to the music room to practice, because I wanted to be alone.” Harry bit his lip and furrowed his eyebrows. “Well, Malfoy showed up. To practice, obviously. Because of the piano, um... Well we argued just a bit, and somehow ended up playing the same piece at the same time.” Ron laughed uncomfortably.
“You’ve got to stop letting him bother you so often. You complain about him all the time, you know.” Harry was silent at that and realized he did talk about Malfoy quite a lot. Hermione kept her firm glance.
“How did you learn to do that in only two weeks?” He suddenly asked, shuffling on his feet. Malfoy shrugged, and looked down. He began to run his fingers along the keys.
“Once your potion has ceased bubbling, take exactly three strands of your hair and dissolve them into your potion.” drawled Professor Snape from right behind Harry, causing him to jump and almost knock over the jar of fluxweed. “Try your best to resist the urge to stir in the hair... Let it sit on its own or the ingredients will become imbalanced and you may have either two or zero brains in a body...” A phrase that caused snickers around the room. Snape seemed pleased and strolled along to watch some of his more favorite students.
“We’ll not be working with cauldrons today,” announced Professor Snape in his drawling voice. Draco immediately frowned. “It has come to my attention that half of this class have not finished the ten pages of written work I assigned last time we were all in this classroom. Therefore, you’re now a day behind my other class. You’ll be spending all day working on that assignment.” Somebody behind him muttered something to their friend. Everyone looked curiously to one another, and for good reason. Usually, written work was for outside of class. During Potions, they’d work with actual potions. Draco felt his mood drop, and hastily pulled out his book, followed by a few others.
“It didn’t work,” he groaned. Malfoy’s mouth dropped, looking down at Harry. “What?” And just then was when he realized. Malfoy was in Harry’s body, looking down at him. But Malfoy’s body is taller than Harry’s. And suddenly Harry realized his vision was blurry.
“Give me my wand, you nimrod. This one doesn’t know one spell from the next. And it’s convinced I’m some imposter,” Malfoy sneered, holding the wand by the tip with his thumb and index finger. Harry snatched it out of his hand, and reached in his robes for Malfoy’s wand, handing it over.
“Would you like to show me?” he said, surprising both Malfoy and himself. “I mean, since it’s so great and all,” he challenged. Malfoy stood for a while, but then turned around and walked towards the piano.
“Do you smell them? Come on, girl. We both heard them, now you’ve got to do your part,” he said, giving the cat a small scratch on the head. Mrs. Norris turned her beady eyes down the hallway and stared right into Draco’s eyes. Then, she looked at Harry. Filch tried to follow her view, but couldn’t see anything. Then the cat stalked away, followed by Filch. Draco let out a shaky breath, and gripped onto Potter’s shoulder once again, trying to rebalance himself after being so light headed.
The most Harry could respond with was, “Uh...” To which Blaise chuckled and sat down on one of the couches.
“But now you look ridiculous without my glasses on, and I probably look ridiculous like this,” he said, wiggling the glasses on his, or Malfoy’s, face. “But this really is a problem. People are bound to notice the glasses, maybe not the height change. After all, it’s only a few inches. Maybe try the spell again?”
“Well, Mr. Malfoy, your skill on the piano compliments Mr. Potter’s levels of skill on the violin perfectly,” she swooned. “So much talent for two young boys has to be shown off!” Malfoy scoffed at that.
“Potter, I just don’t know how to handle this, alright? This is entirely your fault, we spilled our potions on each other, but we didn’t even drink them. It just made skin contact. Maybe that’s why it hasn’t worn off, because it’s absorbed into us? Rather than going through our stomachs...” Malfoy brainstormed. “I don’t know anymore.”
Malfoy just stared, his mouth agape in disbelief. Harry laughed, knowing he was right. And then he went to turn around, go to sleep, and forget this day ever happened. “You’re wrong, Potter.” But that was all that Harry heard before the door shut behind him and he was back to being all alone in the grungy old dungeons. He absolutely hated this place, and everything it stood for.
“Oh!” Malfoy said, smiling. This was unusual for Harry to see. “I know that one, too. Let’s see who’s better,” he laughed. “Play it again.” And Malfoy sat with his fingers resting on the keys, waiting for Harry to start. Honestly, he had no clue what was going on, and so Harry decided to just roll with it. He began to play. And then Malfoy joined in, occasionally pitching in that he sounded so much better than Harry. He wasn’t quite sure who was better, but he did notice that the music that was surrounding them was filling Harry with an emotion he’d never felt before. He felt tingles all over his body, he felt flushed, he felt pleased. He tried to tell himself as soon as this moment was over, he was going to ignore it and pretend it never happened.
“Potter?!” The grip on Harry’s arm was getting tighter, and the other Harry looked frazzled.
‘We are. We’re not speaking to each other.’ Draco sighed and folded the paper neatly, tucking it into his bag. He started to doodle again.
“Okay, do it,” Harry said, and stood a few steps back, allowing room between them. Malfoy nodded, took out a piece of parchment, read from it, then flicked his wand and read the words. Harry closed his eyes, suddenly feeling faint. His knees nearly gave out beneath him, until he jolted straight up again, filled with energy. It quickly dissipated, and once his eyes opened, his was staring at himself once more. His shoulders slumped.
“Everyone is going to be in classes. Plus, we’re going to be in the back. Can’t have anybody finding out exactly what we’re researching, nimwit.” And with that, Malfoy straightened his Gryffindor tie and began striding out towards the exit. Harry really had no choice but to follow him.
“Yeah, I’m alright,” Harry mutters. He then also realized he has no idea how Malfoy talks when he’s not spitting at Harry or shouting at other students. “Just tired, you know,” he trails off.
“It was, before I came to Hogwarts.” Malfoy looked away, unsure of what to say next. “If we can’t tell anyone, how do you suggest we fix this exactly, Malfoy?”
back again...
‘Potter keeps looking at you.’ Draco tensed up and snuck a glance towards him. Sure enough, he kept looking back up and down from Draco to his cauldron he shared with Weasley.
“Sounds like you two are getting along,” he told Harry.
“Just walk with me. I still have yet to learn what instrument you’ll be awful at,” he smirked and dragged an unwilling Potter behind him.
‘Not exactly.’ Harry wrote back. ‘But there’s no reason not to. Plus, it wouldn’t matter if I failed the class, right? I do fine in all my other classes and the music lessons would just be an extracurricular.’
“You’re right, Harry.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Teachers shouldn’t favor other students just because of their house; or relationships with their relatives,” she mumbled. Draco thought that actually sounded quite fair, but seeing as he was on Snape’s good side, he pretended that was the worst idea ever. He must have let it show on his face, because Potter send a rude look his way and Draco sent one back.
‘You mean have.’
“You’re Malfoy,” he stated. “How did this happen?” he asked. Malfoy just shook his head, looking furious.
“Go to the common room. I’m not losing house points because of a curious little girl,” Harry said. So the girl scurried away. There was a moment of silence before Malfoy said,
“Draco, there you are!” she shouted. Harry reluctantly turned around, after hearing the girl running towards him. “Where have you been, hon?” She ran up to him, and linked her arm in his. He was then pulled along as she strode down the corridor.
“The prodigy?” Harry was confused as to how he earned that name, considering when he played the violin he sounded suspiciously like metal scraping loudly together.
“Right. That was odd,” Harry said to himself. He looked baffled before continuing down the hall where everyone was eating dinner.
“If I have to use Brachiabindo on you to get you to sit in your god damn chair, I will,” hissed Malfoy. Harry stayed quiet. He had no doubt that Malfoy would do that.
“Hey mate, I filled your plate for you,” said Blaise, and a half full plate of food was pushed toward him. Harry grabbed a fork and flattened his peas, while sniffing the liquid in his goblet.
“Not quite tired yet, and I’ve got homework to do.” Blaise shrugged, patted his shoulder, and left the common room. Save for a few other Slytherins, Harry was alone in his thoughts, staring blankly into the crackling fire. His fingers massaged the green tie he wore, and his feet shuffled towards the fire, warming up. He wondered how long this would last, how long it would be before he could wrestle with Ron, do homework with Hermione, fly his broom, use his own wand. Malfoy’s wand knew exactly who held it, no matter the face, and did not like him one bit. He thought if he would have to go to Malfoy’s home and pretend to be Draco Malfoy. Would his parents know? Would he get caught? How would Malfoy deal with his uncle, or his cousin? He hoped Malfoy wouldn’t kill them before the two got back to Hogwarts.
“Seriously, why are you not averse to be with me?” he grumbled, attempting to claw Draco’s hands off. Draco flushed, realizing he was still holding on and snapped his arm to his side.
“I wish you would. You’ve no idea how many times that cat has ratted me out. But I don’t know why she let me go this time,” he muttered. Draco took a deep breath, still recovering from the terrifying few moments.
“Your father doesn’t have a say in who you’re attracted to. That’s all you, darling,” Pansy laughed, brushing the hair out of her eyes.
“Potter! Why are you here?” he hissed. Harry stood quiet in the doorway, finding he really didn’t know the answer to that.
‘I can.’
“Actually, I think it’s quite exciting,” said Dean. “I’d love to learn to play, and Seamus and I,” he patted Seamus on the back, “are going to be learning the same instruments so we can practice together.”
“Does that mean you signed it, too?” Draco said, trying to sound rude. He couldn’t stop thinking, however, about having music lessons with Harry Potter. His life was about to get an hour every Monday worse.
“Maybe,” he guessed. That was all he said, but Harry didn’t really care. If that were to happen, they would have to go to the hospital wing and get it fixed immediately, which was fine with him.
It was at this point that Harry pretty much just stayed silent out of confusion and shock. Clearly he had somehow apparated into the Slytherin dorms and whoever this guy is thinks he’s Malfoy... Harry guessed. He was in for a real shock when he got Harry into the light. Harry guessed he would be hexed at least a few times, and then sent out into the hallways to be bothered by ghosts or Prefects while he finds his way back to the Gryffindor dorms. He was led down into the Slytherin common room, when he realized he’d always wondered what it looks like exactly. He’d imagined a scary dungeon void of all happiness. In fact, it was kind of like a dungeon, only because of the walls. Instead of torture devices, there were large couches surrounding the biggest fireplace ever. It looked like a mixture of elegant and evil. Harry knew he was probably overreacting. He had to remind himself not all Slytherins are evil and not all evil wizards and witches are Slytherins.
“Of course she would, Potter.” Harry wasn’t quite sure what he’d said to annoy Malfoy.
“He’s actually being a teacher for once,” said Weasley from across the room (he must not have even tried to be quiet as he spoke over the shuffling of papers and chatting of other students).
Instantly, he felt cold. It was dark, and he couldn’t see anything, which meant this was not where Harry fell asleep. Every night, the moon shone through the windows next to the beds in the Gryffindor rooms and there was always moonshine no matter what time of night it was. And it was always warm in there, a reason why everyone wore sleeveless shirts to bed. This was not where Harry belonged, but he wasn’t sure where he was. He heard light snoring and heavy breathing around him, though, which meant there were people sleeping around him. Squinting to try to see, wishing he had his glasses, Harry nearly jumped out of his skin at a sudden raspy voice nearby him.
He scowled as he remembered yesterday’s incident; allowing his guard down around anyone was punishable, but Harry Potter was the absolute worst person to ever stop being Draco Malfoy around. If he’d even let slip that he thought Harry was marvelous at the violin, he would have to flee the country. And no matter what anybody said, he was not overreacting. If a single person knew that he liked anything about Harry Potter, lots of bad things would happen. First of all, it would get around the entire school. Secondly, it would make Potter think he could win over anyone. And lastly, everyone would finally piece together why Draco Malfoy, unlovable Slytherin, was so irritated by Potter.
“You played for me, Malfoy? Really?” Harry snickered. It can be tricky to understand these past few days whether or not Malfoy is attacking Harry or being civil. Malfoy glared at Harry. He sighed, and decided he wasn’t getting out of this without Malfoy holding yet another grudge over him. He sat down and pulled his violin and bow back out of the case, the nerves filling his stomach. Harry decided to go with the only piece he knew without looking at any sheets and closed his eyes and began to play. He grimaced at the mistakes he was making and how ridiculous he thought he sounded, nothing but emptiness trying to drown out his horrible music. Feeling Malfoy’s eyes digging into him, he stopped and looked back.
“Alright. We can head back to bed if you like. I’ll stay up with you till you’re asleep, yeah?” Inside of Harry’s mind, he was cursing. But on the outside, he just nodded and stood up with Blaise. He let Harry lead, which wasn’t a good idea because he couldn’t remember which way they came from, but eventually they ended up back in bed. Now that Harry knew the situation he was in, he didn’t think there was a way to go back to sleep, so he tried to decide if Malfoy snored or not, and if he tossed and turned in his sleep. He settled for turning his back from Blaise and just breathing deeply until he was satisfied and went to sleep.
“‘Thanks to Leonardo Parks, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are proud to announce new music lessons being offered. The students below have promised to sign up for these lessons and will do so for an entire year. Otherwise, these lessons will secede for everyone involved.’ And there’s Dumbledore’s name signed at the bottom.” Ron groaned and sat back in the love chair he was resting on. Hermione began counting the names for Gryffindor house.
“No! It wasn’t like that, it was weird... anyway, Professor Villareal happened to be listening in. I have no clue why she was there, but I guess from what she heard, she thought Malfoy and I were practicing together and she said it was wonderful and she’s pairing us up for the performance.” Harry spit it all out at once, laying it on the table for Ron to be disgusted by like he did.
“I just saved us from getting caught, no need to thank me, Malfoy.” He rolled his eyes and began to turn away, when Malfoy gripped his arm again. “Will you stop doing that?!”
Each holding mini glasses of their own potions, they swapped and waited for Professor Snape to approve of their work. After inspecting and smelling both of the potions, he sneered at them but allowed them to drink. “You’ll feel a tense headache seconds after drinking the potion, enough to force your eyes shut. You’ll want to be sitting, Potter, Weasley, and once your headache stops, the potion should have done the trick.” When Ron spoke from Harry’s body, cursing and leaning in to inspect his face sitting across from him, there were laughs throughout the room of those watching. Harry was struck wordless, thinking he looked so different than he’d seen in mirrors. He also couldn’t help but notice his hair looked nicer today.
“Sorry, habit. Are you alright, by the way?” he said, grabbing a napkin and dabbing his tongue.
“Just making sure the precious Chosen One,” he pretended to mock, “knows how much trouble he’s in for trying to sneak into our common room.” Harry inwardly punched the air in victory at his quick thinking. “And for wandering the castle past lights out. I was going to turn him in, or better yet, punish him myself.” Harry turned to Malfoy and gave him an award-winning Malfoy sneer. Malfoy returned another award-winning Harry Potter glare, but which was probably intended only for Harry.
“Uh, Ron? That answer’s wrong, you have to cut the dragon scales into halves, not crush them into powder. Otherwise, you’d technically be making.. A bomb, I suppose.” Hermione looked puzzled at that, and began writing something down while Ron scratched out his answer in exasperation. Harry watched as Leo began walking around Gryffindor table, asking for signatures. He noted that Neville Longbottom wrote his name down, as well as Dean and Seamus, but when Lavender Brown was asked, she turned her nose up at him (she explained she had better things to do with her time, like flirt with boys and make up her own spells to make lasting makeup).
Harry nodded, “I’ve heard of him. I like his music.” The two were being very civil and Harry would be lying if he said it didn’t unease him. Malfoy began to play, and went on for several minutes. Each time Malfoy’s long fingers pressed down on a note, Harry felt the single sound resonate within the room and through his own body. Keys were pressed a million miles a minute, but Draco sat on the bench, his robes falling all around him, looking completely effortless and almost bored. Harry found himself lost in the music for so long that he barely noticed when Malfoy was staring at him afterwards, his hands no longer at the piano but at his sides.
Draco was pulled out of his thoughts when Pansy shrieked at him, “Are you even listening to me?!”
“Uh, professor, if I could also say that Malfoy and I will probably never work together. I know what it might have sounded like, but we’ve never gotten along. We fight constantly, and it just wouldn’t work out,” he trailed off. She tilted her head at Harry and smiled.
‘Nothing happened? ;)’ said a ripped piece of paper that Pansy slid over to him. He scowled and crumpled it up before tossing it in the bin. “You’re being ridiculous,” he whispered. “Don’t think this has anything to do with that stupid infatuation with him I had,” he mumbled, regretting he even brought it up. Another piece of paper slid over to him.
Now finding out that man was in fact Blaise, Harry watched as he lit the fireplace and prepared himself for hexes and punches. But they didn’t come. Blaise turned back around, tossed his wand aside, and smiled at Harry. “Um, I know you don’t ever like talking about it, do you want to take your mind off of it maybe?” he asked Harry, tilting his head. Harry was confused about all this concern for someone who didn’t really take a liking to him.
“Yeah, okay, Malfoy and Potter together in the library not trying to choke each other to death. Not suspicious at all.”
“You know I brought you here to be twice as productive. If you’re just going to follow me like a lost puppy then I’ll gladly be alone here,” Malfoy stated. Harry began looking through the aisle across. Except he didn’t know exactly what they were looking for.
He didn’t want to admit it, but he was entranced. And then he noticed Malfoy’s eyes looking right into his own. Harry was startled, and looked away. He decided to listen to Malfoy’s advice and tune out the glorious music. Looking back to his own sheet music, Harry was uncomfortable. His attempts at ignoring Malfoy’s playing weren’t going quite well, and Harry didn’t want to ruin it by torturing this poor violin. He set the bow down onto the stand, and his violin rested in his lap. Harry had truly only come here to practice in hopes of hearing Malfoy play again, but maybe it wasn’t such a good idea. He was feeling unmotivated. He felt like he was falling in love. With the piano, obviously.
greenotter's back...
“If you insist.” Harry followed Malfoy to the piano. He stood awkwardly as Malfoy leafed through his papers. “My sheet music,” he explained. “I’ll play a common one. It’s hard, but I like it. Very popular with muggles. It’s from a man called Beethoven.”
“No! Just the envelope, because I wasn’t sure where I was,” he trailed off.
“What? Why?” Harry pulled back to look Malfoy in the eye.
He went to bed that night imagining himself on a stage. He had a violin in hand, and many faceless people were there. The only people he recognized where Ron, Hermione, and Malfoy. His friends smiled encouragingly at him, but Malfoy only stared straight at Harry. Every time he played, no noise would come out. He saw Malfoy smirk before the rest of his night was spent dreamless.
“Somewhere. I’ve been taking a while to think, but I’ve decided on the harp.” She turned away and began searching for the form in her bag. Draco imagined Pansy playing the harp, and fought a smile.
“Sorry Professor,” he mumbled, assuming the class would go on. When eyes were still trained on him, he sighed and rubbed his eyes. “Was up late working on homework,” he lied.
“He walked in on me playing. I guess he wasn’t expecting me to be so well, after all. Can you imagine, him thinking he’s the only one with talent?” he smirked, working up a laugh. Neither of them joined in. “What?” he said exasperatedly.
Harry immediately knew what he’d done was a mistake. He was mortified at the sight of what Malfoy looked like. He truly wished he could go back in time to thirty seconds ago when none of this had happened. He’d much rather be in Malfoy’s normal, weird, body. But now he saw what appeared to be himself, but with pale blond hair and boring grey eyes. Malfoy’s look of responding horror indicated that his pale skin did not match with Harry’s brown, unruly hair, and green eyes.
“He doesn’t quite match me, professor,” and then turned to look at Harry, who was almost ready to bolt out of there. “He may think he’s all that, but surely we could never work together in any kind of situation. I think I’ll work perfectly with someone else. Perhaps another Slytherin in the class?” he persuaded. Professor Villareal looked at him, smiling.
“Sorry, not much sleep. You know,” he said, hoping she understood. Pansy gave him an odd look, but continued on complaining.
“Well, I’m not going to any of your classes, then,” Harry replied stubbornly.
tell your friends...
“Well, eventually I’m going to get back into my body, and I can’t have people coming up to me and asking why I looked like I’d been fucked, so we’re going back to my dorm to fix myself up.” Leaving Harry with no choice but to follow, they headed down the hallway to the Slytherin common room. When they stopped in front of a seemingly bare wall, Malfoy turned around and tried to shoo Harry away.
“I can hear someone, dimwit!” Harry hissed through his teeth. The footsteps stopped for a moment, then slower, began coming closer. Harry tried to shove Malfoy further into the dark corner so he wouldn’t be seen, and for once, Malfoy didn’t fight, knowing they were right outside the Slytherin dungeons.
“He’s right, you know. And I saw Potter was uneasy as well. Did you two have another wand fight or something? Who was your second?” she interrogated. Draco licked his lips, looking for an answer.
“Potter,” Draco spat. “What are you doing here?” He inwardly thanked the Gods that he was back to being Draco Malfoy, Slytherin Pain in the Butt.
Draco went to bed that night thinking about the piano, and nothing else. He imagined sitting in front of it, too scared to do anything. Then Potter’s face appeared, urging him to play, and Draco spent the rest of the night up and reading.
“You’re an idiot, Potter.” Harry just stared, bewildered.
“Well you are, aren’t you?” Draco looked down at his drink with a puzzled look.
“Ouch!” shouted Harry. Malfoy gripped harder and shushed him. Harry listened, once again realizing their surroundings.
“What happens in the music room stays in the music room,” he said with a smile before pushing open the door and walking inside. She followed him in and he sat down in his usual front seat. Pansy, however, plopped down right next to him.
-Thursday
“If we get to the point where we actually believe that, I’m breaking down your pride and going to the hospital wing. They’ll know what to do, and they already do know what to do. So we just probably just head over there,” said Harry. He was trying his best to lure Malfoy away from the research and towards actual help without making him too pissy.
“Anyway,” Harry said, changing the subject. “I think I’ll be playing the violin. I’ve always favored the strings, and it’s easy to carry, so why not?” A few people nodded in agreement, and Harry turned to his best friend. “Well?”
“Do you remember the commotion tonight at dinner? With those Ravenclaw girls asking us to play that weird game they heard of with the questions?” Blaise asked. Harry didn’t really know what to do at this point, and he was too scared to come up with the strange conclusion that he must look like Malfoy right now. “And that shorter one asked if you were gay? I think they only played that whole game to ask that one question. It’s kind of ridiculous that they’re coming up with that theory. Ravenclaws are too smart for their own good, they start thinking up ridiculous things that aren’t true, and then they can’t be convinced otherwise,” he shakes his head as he says this. Harry decides he’s just gonna listen to whatever Blaise is saying until he’s satisfied, then they’re gonna go to bed, and then he’s gonna sneak out and go back to the common room, somehow get Hermione from the girl’s dorm, and ask her what the hell is going on. “Was the nightmare really that bad? You still haven’t talked and you look a little freaked out,” Blaise asks Harry, looking and sounding concerned. Harry realized he’s going to have to act a little bit to get out of this one.
Harry stops folding his last robe and turns around. “Where’s this coming from?”
“Right.”
Harry rolls onto his back and sticks a leg out from under the blanket. The room is cold. The heating charms must have worn off.
“Of course. Of course I will. Whatever you want,” Harry says, and Draco knows he means every single word.
Cane.” The door opens and the dog practically leaps into Harry’s arms, licking every inch of exposed skin. Hagrid chuckles. “Welcome back ‘arry. Sorry abou’ Cane - he’s bin cooped up in ‘ere all winter.”
still shimmer on it in gold paint and intricate brushstrokes. Harry enters and the bell jingles.
Draco feels as though all the breath’s been pushed out of him. “I-I thought...Thomas and-”
“That you hate your regular gloves? Of course.”
“Hi again.” “Hey.”
“Oh fu-really?!” Almost as if the sheer force of Harry’s words has thrown himself off balance, Harry accidently skates too fast in the wrong direction and collides into Malfoy, who manages to catch him without falling himself.
The girl with her hair in cornrows - Stella - nods. “Okay, you can head that. I’m no good at that without magic anyways. I’ll lead offense.”
“It’s pretty good.” Harry has no idea if it’s good or not. He doesn’t drink wine often enough to tell or to care.
The entire club waits with bated breath. Even Harry finds that he's unwittingly holding his breath in anticipation. Hermione gives his hand a little squeeze.
“I’m gonna get you for that one.” Harry calls as Draco dashes out of the room, towards the stairs, his light laughter floating through the house.
“Okay, okay, fine.” Harry, who has just been standing in his boxers, pulls on the trousers she forced onto him. It feel surprisingly good on his body - no extra fabric around his crotch or ankles.
“You’re not missing much.”
“Pegasus is beautiful, too,” Longbottom breathes.
"Are you alright? Did you break anything?" Hermione scans Draco with her brows furrowed and her parent-voice on, but she doesn't touch him.
“Let’s go, then.”
After swallowing, Harry choked out, “Tonight?”
Suddenly, Draco, in a last-ditch effort to grab the Snitch before Harry, takes one last swipe at it, but leans too far forward. He wobbles on his broom for a gut-wrenching moment, before beginning to fall, a panicked-yelp escaping his open mouth.
mid-run in his scarlet robes - frames it, and hangs it up in the sitting room. At the end of the entire ordeal, Ron gets a promotion for his efforts, and relations with the Muggle Prime Minister improve due to the tireless efforts of Ash and Jenny to calm the Muggle population in the aftermath.
“Of course.” The group of teenagers in the corner burst into laughter. “It’s least you deserve. And it’s the least I could do.”
The third present is from Ron, and it’s a polished wooden box with the words 'Copy Quill' printed in golden letters on the front. Harry lifts the lid and finds a - shocker - quill inside.
He holds it up; it’s an unmarked notebook, and Harry knows that the inside is blank too, but it’s the function that makes it so unique.
“It was...hard. To listen to all of it.” A heavy pause. “Because it was so familiar. Bellatrix she-she-did all of that to me.”
“Are you going to ask me what I got you?”
"Yeah!" "It was awesome!" The others clamor over themselves in agreement with her and crowd around Draco.
he thinks. Snow in London has come late this year - something attributed to Global Warming by scientists, according to the snippets of Muggle news Harry would catch while dozing in front of the telly.
"I can't believe you dragged me into this," Harry complains over the sound of the wind in his ears.
Harry makes to walk after Longbottom, but he hesitates at the door and looks back at Draco, standing next to the firepit and watching him. Harry opens his mouth, closes it. Then, he disappears through the doorway.
“Are you questioning my ability to understand complex interpersonal relationships?”
"Thank you." Harry doesn't think he'll ever use it.
They enter, and step inside. “I think we’re ready to go now, Malfoy,” Longbottom calls. Weasley, Finnigan, and Thomas avoid eye contact. Harry’s gaze is starting to feel like a brand, searing Draco’s skin.
Desperation creeps up on Harry, but he doesn't quite know why. "But you two are his friends, right?"
"I'm glad most of you are doing well. And for those of you who aren't having a good holiday season, just know that it's not over yet. My performance can still salvage it." His smile curls up, his voice turning a little cheeky at the end, but it only elicits more cheers. "Thank you for having me, and I hope you have a good time tonight."
The next morning, they pack up and begin the hike back. An overnight trip was the most they could get away with, considering that they were rapidly approaching summer’s tourism peak, and, worryingly, that the dragon eggs haven’t hatched yet.
“And,” Harry whispers, “The apology you wrote to Hermione, after everything. That was all you.” He presses his thumb into the snake’s yawning maw.
Harry rolls his eyes. She's right that Ava is extremely attractive - sporting a somehow aristocratic and commanding face - but if Ginny knew the real reason he was talking to her, he would never hear the end of it.
With more emotion: “
I sincerely hope you enjoyed this chapter, and if you did or are interested in the thought process behind it, check out my tumblr @Inofaro, where I have a log of how I wrote each chapter. Next and last chapter will likely come this weekend.
It feels like his intestines are uncoiling. It feels like his heart is about to burst through his chest.
“Potter. Look down.”
The end result is this:
Harry chuckles weakly, remembering with a jolt his plans with Malfoy the next day. “I can’t, I’m sorry. But sometime soon. Next weekend?” He looks to Hermione for confirmation.
Chuckling, Harry obliges. When they reach their wizard chess set up on the sitting room table, Harry is met with an extraordinary pouty-looking Draco Malfoy. “Ha-a-rry~” He whines, laying his head down on the table. Harry looks at the board.
Draco looks intensely amused. "Why are you asking?" He takes another sip of wine as he pierces Harry with his intense stare. He's gotten really good at doing that since Hogwarts.
“North. Toward Glyder Fawr. Have you had breakfast?”
He sighs and lets his chin fall back onto his desk. In front of him lies the case file of his current target, the half-finished report strewn randomly. The guy has the usual profile for neo-Death Eaters: young, white, and male, and the small group of other young, white males he leads has grown bold in past months. Ron’s told him all about what he’s seen on stakeouts: the seedy, angry-looking bigots posted up in various side alleys down Knockturn Alley, preying on anyone who looks desperate or angry enough to believe all the bullshit they spout about blood status and, the Death Eater movement’s new gimmick, racial purity. The turn in their ideology came as no surprise to everyone. After all, The Boy Who Lived, the Vanquisher, the Chosen One - Harry Potter - is half Chinese.
“An-”
Prasad and Walker skid down the slope and run over. Amira’s levitating wheelchair flies her down, and Dr. Julie Khanyile follows her wife. They crowd close, smiling and laughing, and don’t flinch for a moment at the stench of birth fluid that has no doubt soaked to Draco’s innermost layer.
"Thank you for coming tonight. I know it's last minute and everything so I appreciate your support for not just me but most importantly for the little ones up front-" he gestures at the table all the orphans are sitting at. The audience cheers and applauds and the children give them shy waves back.
McGonagall leans forward at her desk and motions for them to sit. "Draco, I want you to come back to teach sometime. If not next school year, at least something small like this during the break again. I've been looking to expand Hogwarts as an institution in recent years, and I believe my judgement is correct that your work will be key to that end."
Falling asleep to his own thoughts, again. Harry’s eyes closed and wouldn’t stay open no matter how hard he tried. So he drifted off to sleep, and dreamt about standing in front of a young Draco Malfoy, and shaking his hand. As soon as Harry’s palm touched Malfoy’s, he instantly was dressed in Slytherin robes, and held a long, powerful wand that he did not recognize as his own. It stung his hand, and he went to drop it, but the wand stuck there. It didn’t want to leave Harry, and it was urging him to use magic, light or dark. It was Harry’s decision, after all.
When the two reached the classroom and Potter moved to open the door, Draco slapped his hand away. “Are you mental? We can’t go in at the same time!” Draco took Potter by the robes and shoved him backwards. “Wait at least two minutes,” before he opened the door and sauntered in. When he took his seat next to Pansy, she reached for his arm.
“Well, if you’re not much of a reader, then I don’t see how else you can help.”
Draco knew she was right, and maybe later he would mull over where his eyes seemed to be drawn to. “I wonder if my parents are too old to have another son to keep the Malfoys alive,” he smirked.
“You know, Hermione would know what to do,” Harry mentioned. Malfoy sighed and slightly shook his head.
So then he decided that he could not let anyone know that Malfoy was a hundred times better than him, and that’s how he found out he had been practicing his violin for almost three hours and was about to entirely miss dinner. Deciding he probably did need to eat if he wanted to stay alive, he put away his violin and left the Gryffindor dorms empty save for a few studying peers. On the way to the Great Hall, he slid down a stairway that turned into a slide whenever it was feeling particularly silly, and ran right into Pansy Parkinson. He scowled, getting up and dusting his robes off as Parkinson began to speak loudly. “Ah, here he is. Potter the Prodigy,” she sneered.
“What?” he asked.
“So then why are you so tense around him? And you guys share this look,” Pansy and Blaise looked at each other, seeming to mock Draco and Potter.
“Uh, using the bathroom. What does it look like?” he threw back, instantly defending himself. Draco scoffed.
“Hmph!” was all the short man said before he turned back to the rest of the class, continuing his lesson. A few minutes went by before it happened again. “Mr. Potter!” he yelled, this time angrier. “Please excuse yourself to the restroom to splash some cold water on your face,” he huffed. Harry stood up, bumping into his own chair before stumbling out of the classroom. He went into the lavatory and ran cold water from the faucet, letting it run down his face. He groaned into his hands before grabbing his glasses and returning to class, this time drifting off while covered in water.
Harry tugged at the bag that ached into his shoulders, his schoolbooks weighing down his back and forcing him to walk at a very slow pace. He didn’t quite mind, although he was nearly late for his fourth and final class of the day, History of Magic. This class bored him the most, after all what kind of student would want to learn about some old witches and wizards when they could learn how to turn someone’s hair purple, or make their ears grow three times their size? It was obvious that even in his third year at Hogwarts, Harry was still fascinated by magic.
“What is it, Malfoy? I was about to head to bed,” Harry slurred, realizing just how tired he really was.
“Yes, well at least that’s what Draco says. He bets you’ve learned before, and are just trying to make yourself look better than everyone else? Haven’t you already done that quite enough?” She said, turning her nose up at him. Harry thought this was a ridiculous notion and only pig-minded people like Parkinson would believe such a thing.
“I almost left you here that day. I thought you were already dead. I didn’t want to know. I cared about you Draco, and I wish more than anything you hadn’t lied to me. So many people have lied to me. I just couldn’t stand you being one of them. Not you…” He paused, taking a breath, but Draco hadn’t even moved. “When she… when Fleur told me at Christmas, what the feathers meant, I was beside myself. And then weeks later and I was here and you were nearly dead, and I nearly died the day I saw you lying there.
“Dudley, I-” he hiccupped inelegantly, trying to regain his composure, “Dudley, I think we need to clear up something- And I will do my best to say this as politely but-”
“Mr. Malfoy I presume?” he asked, and at Draco’s nod he continued. “Mr. Potter was hit with the Exanimationes Incidamus curse-”
A student had come down to let them know that it was safe again and that Voldemort was gone. The younger students had pleaded to go back upstairs to try and find their families, and though Draco was afraid of what they would find waiting for them, the vote was unanimous. So, up they went.
“It will be fine my love. You have battled psychopaths before. There is nothing you cannot do. Nay, you won that battle when we were fighting. Together… we are unstoppable,” Draco announced, puffing his chest out a bit for added effect. Harry chuckled lightly, but it was half-hearted. Draco just sighed, and hugged his husband tighter.
“I know you are. That’s why I don’t hold this against you. Not really. You didn’t know.”
Harry slept fitfully. Honestly it may not have been an exaggeration to say he didn’t sleep at all. The hours passed in fits of tossing and turning.
“Did you know?” Draco asked, returning his gaze to the lake.
It didn’t start out as much. Lunch breaks. Walks in the park. Then one afternoon before they left he heard a knock on his door, and looked up to find a tall elegant blonde liaising in his doorway.
“I think the phrase entails crossing a bridge, Harry.”
“Harry. Harry!” Draco called, shaking the screaming boy awake. “You’re okay Harry. You’re okay… We’re okay…” he said, as the boy woke, his voice trailing off.
“Harry?” the witch asked startling him out of his thoughts once more. “Where did that suit come from? I don’t remember it being in your closet.”
“Dudley? I’m sorry, but A- Aunt Petunia mentioned you’d be coming to stay but she didn’t mention if the was reason or… a specific duration?” Harry asked, his smile tight.
There were thousands of them. Thousands of people turned up, maybe millions. The entire Wizarding world had closed to attend or as a show of respect. It was a sea of black for miles around, mirroring the dark storm clouds floating above their heads. Eulogies were given, from people that have never even met Harry. They spoke as if they had been best friends but it wasn’t the case. He hung back, behind most of the crowd. He didn’t figure they would be happy to see him there today, but if he was honest, he wasn’t there for anyone else, he also didn’t care what anyone else thought. It was his dead friend’s - almost boyfriend’s? - funeral. The world just fell away.
“I, I’m meeting someone. I have to go,” the boy stated before running off.
It was the same table that Draco was now headed for, as it was breakfast time on the first morning of ‘year eight’.
Right, he forgot. Mcgonagall’s next act, after providing them with a revised final year, was to abolish all houses among the year eights. There were numerous reasons for this, most of them involving their mental wellbeing and that of their schoolmates. There weren’t enough of them, and to be fair, they had seen things no one else could imagine. They needed a place of their own, a safe place. An eighth-year dorm.
your cousin is coming to stay with us?” Draco asked, though it earned him a disapproving look from his husband.
“I don’t keep ‘minions’-”…..
“If that is even a little bit true, then you should also know that your ‘world’ would die without you. Don’t you dare take yourself away from me,” Draco sobbed.
“No, it’s fine. I was awake anyway, plotting my next scheme and all,” he said, humour evident in his voice. It was a fib, and they both knew it, but one they both told frequently. One lie that Draco thought was absolutely worth any damnation in hell for the smile that crept on to his boyfriends panicked face.
The blonde paused, waiting.
“I stayed, and I watched you grow paler, and your breath remain so shallow I thought you might be breathing at all. So don’t tell me I do not love you or that I only did it out of pity because I tried- I tried so hard not to love you. I tried-” the final dam broke, and the man crumpled, as he curled into himself crying, broken and hurting.
It didn’t take long for the blonde’s eyes to find Harry, who was currently serving himself lunch at the buffet, mourning his future loss of the buffet table, rather distractedly.
One minute since he had learnt about a Veela’s wings.
He entered with a flourish, true to Malfoy form. Draco had grown. He looked a little older, a little wiser, and a little more pained. Like every moment, he was preparing to be turned away, to be hated for who he was, for the blood in his veins, the house he had come from, the mark on his arm, or the white wings now trailing down his back.
“He looks so fragile, doesn’t he?” a soft voice uttered from what he assumed was somewhere towards the door.
He had tried six times now, on various days of the week, different weather, different temperature, but got the same reaction every time. It was him, wasn’t it? And yet the git still had the nerve to act like Draco was so amazing while they were on breaks in the lunch room.
way to go, but they would be okay.
The boy’s face was swollen.
“Nice to talk to you again too, Malfoy.”
It was a Wednesday evening, so the Library was quiet - the students usually left their cramming for Thursday or Sunday nights.
“So, why, in Merlin’s name didn’t you tell me?” the blond shouted as his head snapped up to meet Harry’s eyes, his voice wavering between a scream and a plea.
He turned slightly, watching himself in the mirror, in the slim blue silhouette of the suit fit him like a glove.
down.”
He hadn’t spoken to the boy, not since the war at least, and he didn’t know how, but he knew for a fact that he loved lilies.
And then Harry saw him.
Harry woke with a start. Wrenching the bedsheets off him in cold terror. The sweat pouring off him, as he gasped for breath. It was a dream. It had just been a dream. But was it really?
------------------------------------
“You know it’s for a good cause, Harry,” the witch said, softening.
--------------------------------------------
“Yes Harry. It’s me. You were having a nightmare.”
A moment later, Draco, too incoherent to immediately complain just glared.
“I managed to get your wands, but it won’t take them long to notice you are missing-” Draco cut himself off suddenly, stuffed the wands into his jacket, and then continued as though he had never paused, “-filthy mudbloods, and mudblood lovers. You’re all a disgrace to wizarding kind! You should be grateful our Lord will be putting you out of your misery soon enough. The world will be a better place without your miserable little selves in it,” he sneered.
“I am one of the head doctors at St Mungos. I recall you are Mr. Potter’s emergency contact?” the voice half stated, half asked.
Was he currently going out of his mind thinking about it?
“What’s going on Harry? What’s wrong?” The blonde’s eyebrows drew together, all humour and sarcasm leaving his voice instantly, in a way only Draco could pull off.
“HE SWINGS THE OTHER WAY DUDS!”
“Well, Draco?”
That was the first thing Draco noticed about the boy. He carefully took note of other smaller details as he dragged his eyes from the other boy’s. His hair was messy, and his robes didn’t quite fit. He had big round glasses, but he kept squinting behind them as though they were horrendously outdated, in more ways than one. He had a small nervous smile but there was a kind of strength behind it.
all cleared up, can I ask you something?”
He wasn’t sure. He wasn’t sure of much anymore.
It was full of old fairytales. At least, old wizarding fairytales, including
---------------------------------------------
His denial forgotten for a moment he went back over the boxes laid out on the bed and looked through the others, finding a small box containing a set of Potter Crest cuff links, and another with a set of black socks and black dress shoes. In the final one, he found a matching tie for the suit. He rubbed the material through his fingers several times before coming to a decision.
To be clear, about ten - give or take - students from the entire Gryffindor table didn’t act like absolute idiots, well about the ties at least. Ravenclaw and Slytherin were probably the most refined about the whole event. Though to be fair, on multiple occasions Draco had heard the Ravenclaws excitedly discussing it in private, pretending it was some romance novel they had read, and the Slytherin’s plotting to hex the tie currently on them - usually the poorly tied ones - so that when the ties returned to their owners, they would be hexed to and could then “feel their pain,”. They were all just as involved in the event as each other, just in different ways.
to go.”
Draco returned to his room that night to find dozens of slime filled balloons filling up his entire room. He accidentally brushed against a few before he could banish them, and was coated in a revolting smelling substance.
“Please don’t make me eat those- those…”
--------------------------------------------------
Harry sighed, before resting a hand of the doorknob, still and cold, or maybe that was just him.
partnerships or prospects, or you walk away, knowing that he wouldn’t want you to live a life you didn’t want. Either way do so knowing neither of us hold that choice against you.”
The dining hall was abuzz with conversations and activities. The ties hadn’t changed much since the years before but people were acting like it was all new to them. Give it a week and it would all be old to them. Give it a year and they would be acting like they never expected it all over again. It was insufferable. Of course not everyone acted like that.
Harry turned just as another curse shot towards him. He flinched, closing his eyes, but it never hit. He hesitantly opened his eyes expecting to see another attack, but… there were all he could see was feathers.
“Wait, why? Depending on where I am going I’m not objecting, but why are you sending me off?” he asked, hoping the voice was less of a conniving Slytherin than he was.
The sun rose early the next morning, shining gently through the curtains onto a sound-asleep Harry. His breath coming out in gentle snores. Blithely unaware and unconcerned with the trials and tribulations he was sure to face in the coming hours. It was Draco’s favourite moment of the day, besides the evening couch time of course. He seemed so at peace, and… that was something that they sometimes lacked.
Harry mused,
“Before he...”
“No, you idiot,” he heard the boy say, and looked up only to find him smiling a little ironically. “I wanted to talk to you.”
“Is he- Is he okay? I’m sorry. I really didn’t mean to-”
And so help him, Harry wanted to be cross. He so wanted to stomp his foot and shout at the absurd notion that he would accept such frivolous notions. He didn’t need to be taken care of! He was the saviour!
“Yeah. Yeah, I think I am.”
He was almost surprised how long he had been to keep it up. With the help of his map, and the elves for food of course, he had managed to pull it off for almost a full week, until Draco cornered in his classroom… from which there were no alternate exits. Though, he had to admit the windows were starting to look appealing.
“Old news. Try something new.”
“Draco?” A hand touched his shoulder, and his head zipped around as he backed away, scaring the young witch.
The nightmares were getting worse.
“Marry me?”
“Wait. What do you mean? What are you talking about?” the blonde asking pulling away from a very disgruntled Harry. Harry rubbed his eyes, glaring half-heartedly.
“Neither was I,” he admitted.
“I do, Harry… But so help me, if you compare me to Him again-” The blonde’s ranting and any further complaints were cut off by a set soft lips pressed to his.
No, it was the first time they had spoken, or just interacted and not come to blows over other people or over some war they never wanted to be in. The first time they had met since Harry had returned Draco’s wand to him at the trials. And Draco was wearing Wintergreen and Lime.
It took then eight months to finally announce the end of the Uprising. Draco had barely seen any of the Aurors in the last month, which meant one of four things.
“Explain.”
“Yes, Draco, I do. I’ve come to realise that we are all going to die anyway so we may as well do it with a bit of dramatic flair.”
“It’s not really that difficult. You either stay, and hope that he can recover in time, knowing what that will mean your life and any
“The Ministry doesn’t know a damned thing about him.” She didn’t reply. What could she have said? So, she closed her eyes for a moment before getting up and leaving. He wasn’t insane, just hurting. Hurt was a strange thing.
“What… That’s… I… Who told you that?” the blond stuttered, blushing, as Harry just laughed. “So, help me Potter or I will obliviate you into thinking I never turned up.” The laughs were cut off.
And there lay the flower, delicate but dying beneath the soft rays on the windowsill, waiting for its own inevitable demise to come, left alone and unwanted by the blonde.
On the fourth Wednesday he appeared, the raven brought a bag of sweets and cookies. He made no comment, but simply pushed them towards the blond. They ate in silence, each boy becoming lost in their own thoughts, accompanied only by the smell of old books and the sound of wind whistling off the castle turrets.
“Speaking, and you are?”
... Harry’s hand stilled when he read the next title.
“It’s fine, Dudley. Just- maybe keep a low profile for today, and ask the elves for help next time?”
They had been coming less lately, still there though.
“Lucky,” Draco muttered, making Harry chuckle as he turned to his paper.
“Then it would be a slow process. Veela are strong, but only when supported or supporting our bonded. We are a dependant race Mr. Potter. We need connection. It will take time to rebuild that bond, and I will not lie to you. It may not become strong enough in time.”
They stayed like that for a minute, Harry’s chin pressed firmly into the pale skin of Draco’s neck as the blonde uncertainly stroked Harry’s head. Draco took a breath.
Harry never went back to the Aurors, but he found great comfort in printed pages, and in the books he sold. His bookshop was far from famous - though it might have been if he had told anyone he had bought a bookshop, besides Ron and Hermione - but it was comfortable, nestled in the outskirts of a small village about an hour from London. It was warm and safe, just the way he liked it. And with the added bonus of excellent company, it was just the way he loved it. And love him he did.
When he didn’t respond, she sighed.
Harry had begun watching Draco as he wandered around now, well, again he supposed. Old habits die hard. It was much the same as before. Malfoy was courteous but a long way from being overly polite. Sarcastic and a bit of a prat. He was just Malfoy. There was… one thing he noticed though.
Regardless, as their own separate group, a group that should hopefully never be formed again, they were seated together at a separate table in the great hall. It was placed in between the teachers table and the other houses’ tables.
Malfoy looked tall in a suit. Well, no, the blonde
I wasn't going to continue this. I was pretty happy to leave it where it was. Suffering. But I had some amazing feedback and comments about a second chapter.
“Malfoy,” Hermione nodded. “It’s been a while.”
Pained lanced through him, and he thought he heard someone scream as the world went black. It might not have been for him though. Then again, it might have been. The person might have known that they couldn’t scream his name for fear of Harry being distracted and losing their one shot at winning… Then again maybe it was Harry. He didn’t know anymore…
------------------------
“What are you doing down here Draco?” he heard a voice call from behind him. He had been expecting it, hence his change in attitude.
Holding it up to the floor length mirror in front of him he admired himself, managing to rationalize trying it on. Just to see how it would fit. Then he would take it straight off afterwards.
“I’m not sure I understand what you are referring to…”
“Severus, what happened?” he asked, his question only just passing as a greeting.
“So, really. Everything is fine.”
“So am I,” he replied, then smirked as the other boy glared at him. Oh, if looks could kill. “I suppose, we will just have to see what happens.”
“Sorry to keep you waiting,” the blonde said handing him one of the glasses. Harry gave him a small smile.
The Headmistress had offered to hold extra classes for the previous year seven ‘graduates’, because let’s be real, in between fighting a Dark Lord and just generally trying not to die, who had time to study? Okay, maybe the Ravenclaws, but that was beside the point. The younger years, as involved in the war as they were, didn’t get held back because they could cover everything in the next years’ revision, but that wasn’t the case with the year eights.
He dragged his fiancé into a hug, taking in the wonderful smell of wintergreen and lime. He loved that smell. It smelt safe. It smelt like home. It smelt like memories.
“You know you can’t threaten to erase my memory every time you do something cute,” the boy returned, his tone oddly serious in comparison to what he was saying. The blond just blushed harder.
Nightmares plagued them all. Draco knew for a fact that no one got more than five hours sleep each night, except Ron, who seemed to be able to sleep through anything and everything, no matter what was going through his head. Draco kind of admired that about him.
“I… You… He left you a letter,” the girl said, eyes red and swollen, face downcast, eyebrows drawn slightly together. She held out a piece of paper, with the same stupid, chicken scribblings he had always been mad at.
For a split second, the other boy’s eyes were burning. The usual emerald alive with a fire not unlike those brought about with floo powder. It was terrifying, but Draco couldn’t bring himself to feel afraid. He didn’t believe there was a single thing that he wouldn’t let the boy standing opposite him do to him.
-------------------
He didn’t expect Malfoy to be the one to stay though.
“Maybe…”
“I don’t know what you mean,” he said at last, with a small indignant huff at the end. He didn’t take charity, and most certainly not if Harry still couldn’t tell the difference between his eyes and everyone else’s.
“But you love me,” the messy-haired boy replied simply. Instead of an answer the blond simply leaned down to kiss the other boy’s cheek before whispering in his ear.
"Are you sure?" Ron asks, reaching for his robes.
Draco smiles. They always ask the same question, he always gives the same answer. “She wakes when she wakes.”
There is no response, only the slight shaking of Draco’s head, as if he didn’t hear anything, as if he wouldn’t be able to hear anything ever again.
“No?” He kind of did.
So when it becomes clear that something is bothering Draco, one week in November, when the chill of fall begins to turn icy and brutal, Harry lets him stew. And stew. And stew some more. Because Harry knows Draco will come to him eventually - but only when he’s ready and not a second before.
Draco inclines his head. “Yes.”
"Harry, I wanted to talk about...what we're doing. Us."
Draco offers him a small smile. “Excellent.” He changes topics immediately. “Do you have a preferred wine, by the way?”
If there is anyone to tell by then, Draco thinks to himself, I’ll tell them that, when I go, I want to go everywhere:
Draco glances at Ron, whose eyebrows haven't returned to their normal, low position on his forehead, and back at Hermione, before hugging her back. "Thank you, Ms. Rose. I appreciate your concern."
Audrey inquires, leaning her head on her hand, "Did you receive this past week off for Christmas, at least?"
Outside, a flock of dragons cross the sky, a gray spear pointing toward home.
With a flash of feathers, his letter is on its way to its recipient.
“Oh. Where do you work?”
"You just wanted to watch me suffer."
“Be my guest then. Please sort these alphabetically.” Malfoy doesn’t hesitate to push the scrolls into Harry’s arms. He breezes into the kitchen. “Would you like some tea?” he calls over his shoulder.
He's still wearing clothes, thank goodness, but when Harry looks under the covers, he realizes that
“I don’t
The voice takes on an edge, “Be honest, Ron. Would you
“Dinner’s ready!” Andromeda calls, sending everyone scrambling to get to the kitchen. “Oh! Harry!” She says she Harry walks in. “I didn’t even notice you coming in. Sit down, sit down. Tonight’s your favorite! I’m trying a new recipe based on what you told me.”
