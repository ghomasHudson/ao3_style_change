.” I watched him choke back a sob, crossing his arms tightly over his stomach. “And I’m trying, but it’s so hard sometimes.” I couldn’t stand to see him like that, and I pulled him into a tight hug, his arms coming around my waist and head tucking into my shoulder. He started crying quietly, his entire body shaking.
“Siri…” Remus scolded.
I sat down, trying to contain the smile on my face. I was pleasantly surprised to find a french inspired meal- my favourite style of food. There was a healthy serving of ratatouille, a nicely seared steak to accompany it, and what looked like-
He reached up on his toes to place a shy kiss on my cheek. Immediately, my face turned hot and my whole body seemed to tighten with a quick zap of electricity. I fell into stuttering as I opened the door, somehow stepping out and slipping on a bit of ice right outside the door. Harry laughed, his own cheeks rosy, and closed the door gently behind me.
“It’s not something he talks with us about. He likes it when we ignore it.” Neville chimed in. “Don’t say anything if something’s different, okay? Harry has a hard time sometimes.” I bit back my anger at that statement.
“I do, too. I just wasn’t sure.” Harry bit his lip, the corner of his mouth twitching happily.
“Sirius, don't be embarrassing.” Remus chastised softly. He smiled warmly at the man, then at me. “This is my partner, Sirius. And his feathered friend is Honey- just a visitor.”
“Can I bug you for a refill?” I asked, handing him my cup. Harry grinned and took my cup, filling it up the way I liked it, his face going smooth and serious as he made the design on top with cream and a toothpick. He handed it to me with the lid off, a pleased smile on his lips. This time it was a tree, the leaves intricate swirls. I grinned up at him, and he laughed softly, looking away with pink cheeks. I gently lidded my drink and left the money on the counter. “Sit with me tomorrow?” I asked eagerly. He sighed again, nibbling his lip, but nodded slightly. I smiled and did up my coat, slinging my bag over my shoulder. “See you tomorrow, then.”
“You’re right.”
“That tie really does look nice, Lucius.” My mother’s voice floated out into the hall, making me grin. I shut the door behind them and faced my friends, grinning.
... Just so damn alone... “
“You’re gorgeous. I can’t even tell you what your eyes look like right now.” Harry chuckled, looking down shyly.
“Yeah. Thanks, Dray.” His arm came around my waist, and I practically shone on the inside. “We’re here.” He said, stopping at the street corner. “I’m number four.” He turned to face me, biting his lip. “I’ll see you tomorrow?” I grimaced guiltily.
“Oh, good!” Luna took Pansy’s hands from the table, holding them between hers. “We’re going to have so much fun tonight!”
And so, my plan formed.
I was tired by the time I got to Remus and Siri’s apartment, and had to lean against the wall to catch my breath and try not to fall over.
“Great! I have a few different kinds, you can choose-” I seriously would have been listening, but Harry had an ass and my eyes were thoroughly enjoying monitoring its slight bounce and flex as he walked. He was wearing black jeans as his uniform, followed by a white button up shirt and a black apron. His jeans were tight, showing off his long, skinny legs and his ass which was cute and perky and I kind of wanted to grab it. Fuck… “-Right?” I looked up when his ass disappeared from view, meeting Harry’s happy eyes and cute smile.
We both startled at the sound of footsteps coming down from the upstairs apartment. Harry padded down the stairs, looking cute with socked feet and baggy sweatpants.
“Sirius, no-”
“Oh, I forgot to tell you!” Harry said suddenly, making me look up as we entered the loft. Only the lamps in the livingroom were on, the rest of the flat being lit by various candles around the room. I could see the kitchen table had been dragged from its usual spot, a frayed tablecloth laid over it, with more candles set out, and a meal for two already plated up. “Er… surprise! We have the place to ourselves for the night.” I looked back to Harry, who was standing by the stairs looking hopeful and bashful. He twisted his hands, gesturing limply to the table, then towards the staircase. “Have a seat, I’ll put the candles on the stairs out.”
“Wow, I almost forgot. My name’s Harry. It’s nice to meet you.” I shook his hand (
“Yeah, bye!” He ducked into his flat finally, making me laugh. I caught up with Neville and Luna, who were waiting by the elevator for me. Luna smiled and took my hand, and Neville patted my back; their own little ways of showing support. I let myself feel good, thankful for my amazing friend-family.
“Hey,” I jumped, wiping my face, when Petunia appeared at the doorway suddenly.
“Okay. I’ll let you try one before I do the rest.” He spread a fair amount of frosting on top and handed it to me with a napkin, leaning forward eagerly when I took a bite. I felt a bit self-conscious when eating near him at first, but Harry was so eager to please with his food that I quickly got used to being his sampler. Even if it meant I had to work out more to work off all the sugar.
“Y-yeah, in the living room.” I pointed in their direction, Harry shooting me a smile and walking over to see them. “Harry...”
“Before,” he said, eyes darting around my face as he spoke, “When I was with my parents, before everything happened, I used to feel so anxious all the time. Like, I had anything I could have wanted, and it could be taken from me at any time.” Harry touched my cheek with gentle hands. I let him speak. “And then it was. And I thought I would break.” His voice cracked, and he swallowed tightly, pressing his lips together. “Maybe…” he breathed, looking down at my lips. “I think I did, actually.”
I picked at my food that night, my mother looking pointedly between my father and myself as though she thought I wouldn’t notice. My father cleared his throat after having a silent argument with my mother which I clearly saw through my peripheral vision. It was complete with fork-stabs at my father.
. I had never seen eyes that that before, and they were… Well, they were beautiful. I suddenly remembered what Luna had told me, the words echoing in my head familiarly.
"Bye, Harry!" After a few minutes, I burst into the book shop I worked at, panting desperately.
“Uh, it’s possible?” I really wasn’t interested in talking to her; I just wanted her to leave so I could stare at my latest crush.
“Sounds good.” I agreed, pulling the door open for Harry. He grinned and stepped out onto the sidewalk.
“They don’t bite.” I assured him. “They’ll like you. They’re not like the kids at our school.” Harry grinned at me.
“You guys are the best, you know that?” I whispered. Luna leaned over and hugged my shoulders, rubbing my back.
“You try some.” I ripped off a chunk and offered it to him, surprised when he leaned forward and bit it out of my hand.
“Well, he’s an adult.” Harry chuckled. “Very formal. It comes with his job.” I received a nod of understanding, and I couldn’t look away once I peered down at those green eyes. “We look quite similar, actually, but his hair is longer.”
“If they’ve done their job, then I suppose you should.” He looked up into my eyes, smiling easily at me. “I can’t wait to be threatened by your parents.”
“Sorry guys! I got kind of caught up in catching up.”
I realised with a warm jolt in my stomach. His uniform looked old and baggy, and he plucked nervously at his tie. I felt a tap on my arm and turned to look at Hermione, who was resting her hand on my arm.
“What do you mean?”
Dark feelings, and opening up.
“Nuh-uh. You’re my sampler. I can’t have you pay for samples.” I glared half-heartedly at him, biting into my bun again.
“I- well, I’ve never had a pet, really. But I do love them, of course. My father has an allergy.” I felt the need to explain.
“Sorry…” I muttered, looking back at the books. I found the author I was looking for and considered a few titles.
“Alright there?” I turned my head to meet bright green eyes, and felt my face heat up immediately.
“But... Father...” I whispered, embarrassed that he was hearing this. My father cleared his throat.
“Not really!” Luna said, “Harry is one of my favourite people in the world though.” Luna slid back into the booth, but on the opposite side she had before, getting right into Pansy’s space. “Pansy, I think you have a very strong aura. You’re captivating. Is it alright if I do a tarot reading for you? I’m just so curious about you.” Pansy tried her hardest not to look bewildered, her eyes fluttering.
“Was it The Hobbit?”
I smiled to myself as I came across a few that I considered personal classics: Lord of the Rings, Artemis Fowl and Eye of the World being a couple. I was contemplating a new book when the door flew open, the little bell ringing violently. A shorter, skinny boy with wild black hair burst into the shop, panting heavily.
“He’ll be okay, Lucius. It’s boy stuff.”
.” I wanted him, wanted more and more and he wanted me too and it made my head spin-
“Hello.” Her voice was soft and floaty, and made me feel like I was on some kind of slow drug.
“I’m sorry.” I apologised automatically. I can’t imagine how it would feel to lose a parent. I wondered how old he was when it happened.
Standing at the cafeteria doors, in clothes much too big and wringing his hands nervously, was Harry. I smiled when I saw him, looking awkward and embarrassed and
“It was so stupid.” He murmured, his voice tight and choked. “I was only doing laundry. He was upset because I m-mixed our clothes so I didn’t waste water! Now you had to find out like this, and I’ve ruined everything!” A fresh wave of sobs took over, Harry grabbing my shirt in a violently strong grip. “I’m s-sorry, Draco…” My heart broke at his tone, at the desperation and loss in his voice.
“You disgust me.” I told her. “I bet you hardly know him.” I stood, brushing my arm where she touched me, and collected my things. Their group was staring at me with various looks of shock on their faces. “I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.” I nodded in their general direction, and made my way to the cafeteria doors. Harry smiled at me when he saw me, looking a bit scared and very out of place.
“I’ll see you at school. Have a good weekend.” I murmured, pulling back to smile at him. Harry grinned back shyly and hesitated again.
“Some of my friends from my old school. There’s Pansy, Blaise and Theo. I don’t expect my friend Greg to come, he and I are kind of on and off friends. My ex, Theo, he’s-” I stopped abruptly, realising my mistake. I hadn’t come out to Luna or Neville yet; hadn’t felt the need. “Um...”
“I just...” He breathed deeply, letting out a long sigh. “I’m trying really hard, Draco.” He sounded exhausted, refusing to meet my eyes. “I want to be strong and together, but I just...” He looked away, biting his lip as his eyes watered. “I
“Okay.” He glanced at the door when a customer walked in, and I waved at him to let him know I was leaving, wandering over to my spot to read my book. I didn’t want to distract Harry when he had customers. Remus gave me a knowing look when I passed him, and I looked away, blushing. I sat down and took out my book, ignoring the feeling of Remus’ eyes on me while I read.
. “What time do you have to be home?” He asked suddenly, looking concerned. I glanced at my watch again.
Even in the cold walk home, I felt warm right down to my toes.
I stroked soft red hair out of her face, running her brush through the lock already in my hand. I placed it at her shoulder accordingly, pulling the quilt up to her shoulders. I tucked her in carefully, raising her frail arms to finish fixing the blankets.
“Do you want to talk about it?” I asked, tossing my empty pie container in a trash bin we came to. Harry snapped out of his little trance when I paused in front of the bin, finishing his food and tossing the container as well. He crossed his arms over his stomach, holding his sleeves.
. If this happens again, you’re moving in with me. Understand?” I nodded, and Remus grasped the back of my neck affectionately. “Eat something before you start. Siri will make you a sandwich if you go upstairs.”
“Harry!” He cried. I startled, looking up at him. He took my hand and pulled up my sleeve, gasping at the line of cuts he saw. I snatched my hand back, pulling my sleeves over my hands. The cup of tea fell to the floor with a crash, but we ignored it. We stared at each other for a long time, Remus’ eyes wide with shock and sadness.
I closed the door gently behind me and walked to the kitchen. I grabbed my bag off the floor, glaring at Dudley as I grabbed one of my apples from the counter. He had stolen one yesterday, and I was still angry.
“It’s not too far of a walk, is it?”
“You’ll settle in no time. My friend Ginny has wanted to ask you to hang out some time. Maybe you could sit with us at lunch someday?” She smiled up at me expectantly. “Oh, but you probably don’t know who I’m talking about. Ginny Weasley. She has long red hair, captain of our girl’s football team…” I shrugged helplessly. Hermione waved her hand dismissively. “No matter. You can meet her, say, tomorrow? We can all sit together.” I opened my mouth to politely refuse, but Hermione cut me off, smiling happily. “Good! Our school is like one big family! You’ll fit right in, don’t worry!” She patted my shoulder and flounced away, leaving me speechless. Apparently I wasn’t remarkable when school first started
“That’s common in wealthy families.”
“Ah, I skipped breakfast.”
Heh, please don't kill me. I'm still alive!! :D And I have the next chapter finished, just need to work on chapter six first. I also made a tumblr, but I'm too shy to post a link... -_-' There's nothing really on there anyways. Meh.. D:
"That's good. She should eat more Vitamin D. It'll be good for her in the winter."
“They are, but I need to pitch in as well-” Remus’ eyes darkened, and my blood went cold. Remus can be scary when he wants to.
“Come in, make yourselves at home.” I opened the door for Luna and Neville, gesturing inside. Luna smiled and me and touched my arm as she passed, and Neville grinned crookedly. I looked into the hallway hopefully, but Harry wasn’t there. “Is Harry coming?” I asked, turning to face my new friends. I noticed their hands were intertwined, Neville blushing. I smiled knowingly at them. “Well, it’s about time!” I shouted. Luna laughed happily and Neville blushed more, ducking his head.
“It isn’t really my house,” He explained after giving me directions. “I’m only staying there with my aunt and uncle for a while, until things are sorted.” He choked up a bit again, ducking his head. “Uh, my family is a little broken right now.” He swallowed, biting his lip, his eyebrows furrowing. I finished my pie and looked around to see if anyone else was around.
“He died.” Was the soft answer, Harry’s voice catching. Remorse swelled inside me.
“Language.” My father chastised me automatically. “I kind of knew then that you were different.” I felt my shoulders droop. “But I’ve never thought that you weren’t good enough.” I looked up at my father sharply. He was looking at me intensely, his gray eyes boring into mine. “You’re my son. You’ve always done well in school and been kind and polite. You’re extremely literate and well-spoken, and you have so many opportunities for your future. I have
“I don’t want to. I’m not ready.” His expression softened, and he hugged me again, rubbing my back.
Harry was a fantastic cook, and I didn’t shy from telling him so, humming with pleasure as I ate. We talked, the topics going off course as the wine set in and I felt my face flaming up. He finished the meal by unceremoniously setting our dishes in the sink and returning with another full glass for me, his with white wine to try out.
on my legs. A week after, they appeared on my upper arms. A month later, they were on my forearms. Remus saw them when they made it to my wrists, when I handed him a cup of tea.
I quickly finished it, and fiercely wanted the sequel, where the couple was planning on adopting. It was one day after that that I finally got the courage to return to Lunar Café.
I was sitting by myself at a table in the school’s cafeteria with a book in my hand, just the way I liked it, when someone plopped themselves into the chair across from me. I looked up, my best scowl on my face, which I almost lost when I realized who it was.
“Maybe.” Harry laughed, stepping back away from me. I took a deep breath in as he stepped around me, leading me to the door. “For now, I guess I should be getting rest?”
“Don’t...” He murmured. Even his resistance seemed tired, unenthusiastic, like he didn’t really want to say no to being taken care of.
My parents and I had moved to Leicester just a month ago, making ourselves comfortable in our large apartment. The move took a long time, with me still completing my first term and my father wrapping up his affairs in London. I jumped into school just after first term, after the Holidays, and I missed being on break already. I walked past the book shop/coffee shop twice a day five times a week; when I walked to and from my school. Lunar Café. It looked cozy and welcoming, and I just couldn't resist anymore.
“Draco! Can you catch two of them?” Luna challenged. I shrugged.
“Red,” I chuckled, watching with amusement as Harry twisted the top off, pouring me a generous glass. “Thank you, love.” He poured himself a glass as well, before finally joining me at the table.
“Bloody fuck, Harry! What the hell happened?” I pulled him into the house, kicking the door shut behind us. I took his jacket and hung it up for him before turning and cupping his face gently in my hands. “Oh my god! Does it hurt?” Harry blushed bright red and shrugged, ducking his head to get it out of my hands.
have a chance… I huffed, crossing my arms across my chest.
“Hey!” He cried out, mock outraged. I saw his scars, then. From his shoulders down to his wrists. Some were white from age, and some still pink and healing. I felt my mouth open a bit, but somehow I wasn’t as shocked as I thought I would be. “You okay?” he asked tentatively when he saw my face, his hands dropping from his chest. I looked up and was struck by how beautiful his eyes looked in the low light. They were such a pure, glowing emerald, with only one fleck of brown near his right pupil. I reached for him, and he climbed onto my lap, holding my face between his hands.
I startled when I felt his hand press into mine, gripping my hand lightly. His palm was warm where it pressed against mine. I turned to look at him sharply, surprised and pleasantly so. Harry was looking forward, the slightest blush on his cheeks. I bit back my questions, my heart pounding, and his hand squeezed mine when I faced forward again, a question.
“Just for next week. I was slacking. My grades went down a bit last term.” Remus sighed in disgust and let go of my elbow, rubbing my shoulder with his other hand.
to hurt him. Asking me not to say anything if something was hurting Harry was like asking a honeybee not to make honey. Neville and Luna stared at me solemnly, and I huffed, nodding. Fine, I would try not to. But if something bad was happening, then I was going to step in. That was just who I was. Our serious moment was broken by the sound of the door being softly knocked on. Luna and Neville scurried back into the living room, and I turned to open the door.
“I don’t want to lose you.” He breathed. “I feel like I’ve lost almost everything.” He breathed in a deep, shaky breath, his voice thin and breathy. “I’m scared.”
“Cocky,” I sighed, sliding my hands up to his uncovered hips.
“That’s fine, I’ll help you out.” We stared at each other a moment, just grinning, happy. “Yeah, awesome. Cool... See you soon, then?”
“Actually, the ones I was buying before were a change from my usual. I have a thing for fantasy and adventure. I like the action.” Remus nodded thoughtfully.
“You come from a family of wealth.” She said.
been proud of you.” I swallowed around the lump in my throat. “Maybe it’s because I have issues expressing my emotions and thoughts, or maybe it’s because I’m not home as much as other fathers, but whatever it is that’s made you think you aren’t good enough, it needs to stop now.” I felt my lip tremble and bit harshly at it. “I feel like I haven’t seen who you really are in years. Even now, you’re holding your own emotions back.” He moved closer, and I clenched my fists to hold myself still. “I’ve never been more proud of you, Draco. Especially now that you’ve accepted yourself and stood up for yourself. I know how hard that is, Draco. I’ve seen you struggle.” I sucked in a breath, feeling myself tremble.
“Marshy.” Sirius gently scratched his rump, making him kick his legs. “He’s got a bit of a cold. Are you okay, Harry? You look pale.” Sirius’ hand was suddenly pressed to my forehead, and I rolled my eyes.
“Harry!” Sirius called fondly from the floor, a ferret draped over his shoulders. He worked at an animal shelter across town, and sometimes brought home the animals that needed a bit of extra attention. He was a licensed veterinarian, but couldn’t find a job in a vet’s office, but I think he’s happier working with animals who need to be adopted.
“Draco? That’s a really cool name.” I chuckled again, fucking nervous laughter, and shrugged as he pulled his hand away.
“The Year of Our War?” I read. “It’s about angels?” I asked, looking up at Remus. He smiled, showing that scar once again.
"Oh, um...” Reus tried futilely to stop laughing, and I covered up my embarrassment by scowling. “Well it certainly looked like they were dating, all the giggling and touching.” I sniffed. “I doubt he'd be into me anyways. I kind of have a 'never fall for straight boys' rule." I explained. Remus’ face softened again, a gentle laugh escaping him.
“I’m a veterinarian at the animal shelter,” Sirius explained briefly, “And I have a few stowaways almost constantly. Do you like animals, Draco?”
“Look, I’m sorry. Please don’t be mad.” I put a few ice cubes on the washcloth and bundled it up, tying the ends.
“This is Luna and Neville. I’ve told you about them.” Neville reached forward the shake hands with my mother, and then (bravely) with my father, who stared holes into Neville’s face. I watched the colour drain from his face somewhat, sighing internally.
“Smacking that whale right upside the face-”
There are graphic descriptions of accidents and self harm in this chapter, please be safe and aware of your limits, lovelies. <3
I rested my head on my mother’s mattress, a tear rolling out of my left eye and falling onto the quilt covering her. I had my arms tucked to my chest, the stinging sensation keeping me awake. I didn’t have to pay for my food anymore, but the Dursley’s glared at me so fiercely whenever I went to grab something to eat that I only ate when they weren’t home. With Petunia being a housewife and Dudley’s different school schedule, it was rare that they weren’t home. My stomach growled, and I winced at the hunger pains. I looked up at my mum, her sick pale skin and dull red hair. My usual guilt ate me up, the stinging on my arms flaring.
“I’m fine, really. Don’t make a scene.” Remus grumbled under his breath.
I recently got an email about a comment left by “Ki’ya+hetep” here. I do think about this story every now and then. It was one of my biggest escapes when I was at my worst. And I had no idea that anyone else still knew this little story existed! Thank you so much, Ki’ya+hetep, without  you I wouldn't even be posting this little note! Or realised that I missed writing so much! But I'm also horribly out of practice!
“Of course,” Harry confirmed. “And Draco,” he continued, placing a warm hand on mine, “thank you for the skates.”
“I really want to, but it kind of- It reminds me a bit of what happened to me. In the bathroom.”
” He moaned when I complied, my hand running up a smooth length and mouth tracing up his neck.
“Yes, I’m actually quite horny these days,” he said, a giggle escaping his lips. I felt my own face break into a smile, a tense leap of interest in my stomach nearly making me gasp.
“I can go if you’d like?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Bright green t-shirt, light blue long-sleeved shirt underneath, a necklace with a clay carrot resting just at her chest, small sparkly earrings in turtle shapes and long curly blonde hair pulled to the side of her head in a messy braid. The outfit was complete with a pink bandana tied around her head.
Luna took turns going through Pansy, then Blaise, and after some encouragement from the rest of the group, Theodore. The night extended into a trip to a new board game cafe, and though I protested, Draco ended up paying for my fee. We eventually made our way back to Draco’s flat, as his three friends were staying over there for the night. My heart started beating faster as Luna, Neville and I got ready to leave. Draco lent me his cable-knitted cashmere scarf that almost buried my face in softness, and all of Draco's friends hugged me tightly, Luna getting the same treatment. Draco rolled his eyes at his friends and followed me out of the flat, adjusting the scarf absentmindedly. Luna and Neville subtly continued down the hallway, giving us privacy. I grinned up at him when he started to talk and faltered, ruffling his own hair nervously.
“Oh… Well, he still could have told me. I’m not about to burst into flames because he has a thing for a boy. He knows I don’t care!”
“Absolutely. I’m open-minded.” Remus smiled, his eyes softening.
“What are you talking about? Your ex boyfriend Theo is what?” Neville asked. He smiled at me, waiting for me to continue. Luna raised her eyebrows, grinning. They didn’t care. Didn’t even miss a beat. I smiled widely, sitting straighter in my seat.
“Oh,” Pansy said suggestively, watching Luna and I approach, “The lovers return.” Luna and I laughed together, and Neville hid a smirk.
“Alright, fine. You’ve got me.” She laughed lightly, a happy sound that made me smile. We sat in comfortable silence before I admitted quietly, “And you may have been right about the other things, too.” Harry’s girlfriend or not, I still really liked her. She was kind and refreshing, and although she seemed a little wacky, she was good company. I wasn’t any less jealous, however, and the fact that she was lovely didn’t help at all.
I blinked confusedly for a minute afterwards, playing with the tissue in my hands.
“Okay.” He said quietly.
“Real men know when to let go.” My father murmured. He stood up and bent over me, pressing his lips to the top of my head. “We can talk about this young man of yours tomorrow; I’ll be able to get home earlier than usual. Goodnight, Draco.” He smiled softly at me before he closed the door behind him.
I answered by lacing our fingers together, holding his hand more securely.
The second time I went, (I think his name was Harry?)
"That boy hasn't looked away from you since you walked in the store." I glanced at Remus as he pulled back, smirking at me. I looked over at the customer in the fiction section, and he looked away quickly, blushing. The boy carried on down the bookshelves, touching the spines absently. I tried to look away and focus on making coffee and cookies, but it was hard not to stare. He looked very classy, wearing a dark gray coat with a green scarf, his white blonde hair falling slightly into his face, which he brushed away with an elegant sweep of his hand.
“No drugs, no strangers. I know mother. Enjoy your evening.” I resisted the urge to dodge the kiss placed on my cheek, and jumped when my father clapped his hand on my shoulder.
“Draco,” he gasped, tangling his hands in my hair. I licked over one of his nipples, making him moan. I felt his cock twitch where it was pressed against me, making my mouth actually water. I looked down at him, and saw a wet patch on his pants from his cock. I closed my eyes at the wave of arousal that came over me, imagining how he would taste.
“People don’t like me at school. They think I’m strange, and they tell stories.” I huffed. Fucking bullies.
This chapter is completely in Draco's POV. :)
“Harry?” Remus asked cautiously.
“I’m sorry about them, Sirius in particular has little to no social skills as far as I know.” Harry apologised with a laugh. I smiled in return.
“Hellooo?” I sang.
and started to laugh as well, before biting my lip to stop the embarrassing noise.
“Sorry, I’m making things awkward, aren’t I?” I shrugged, smiling at him apologetically. “Would you like some tea? I’ll give you a free cup as a little ‘Welcome to the town’ gift.” I played with my hands and nodded.
I woke with a start, rolling over as my mother shook my shoulder. She looked at me with raised eyebrows and a concerned curve to her mouth.
“Yeah, let’s head out. Where did you want to go?”
doing here?” Ginny asked snidely, catching my attention and causing me to look up. I would stick up for a stranger if needed. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again; I HATE bullies.
“Just-” I gripped his chin carefully between my index and middle finger and my thumb, forcing his eyes to meet mine. “Please, Harry. It hurts to see you like this.” Harry swallowed tightly, the tendons in his neck visible and his collarbones looking wickedly sharp when he sucked in a quick breath. “Let me take care of you. Please.” His shoulders tensed up, and he fought to hold my gaze, eyes flickering away every now and then. I felt his chin wobble, watched his eyebrows come together. He took a deep breath, exhaling shakily, and then nodded minutely.
The intercom shut off and I pressed the button to let him into the building. I unlocked the door and turned around to find Luna behind me, fidgeting and biting her lip.
your godparents; you should be with
“Harry,” Remus sighed, “Maybe it would be a good idea to take it easy today.”
“Love you too, Lu.”
I tuned out while Neville sheepishly went through our introductions, watching Draco watch his friends. He lit up in a different way with his old friends. It was more familiar, less hesitant. I was struck once again with how effortlessly beautiful he was.
“What was his name?” Harry asked curiously, not looking away from me.
leave like the
“I miss you.” I whispered to my mum, “You and dad.” My breath caught in my throat, and I coughed so I could breathe again. “It’s kind of bad here right now. I just-” A sob tore its way out of my chest. “I just miss how much you loved me, and how much I loved you. I miss being
“Aren’t most people?” I rebutted. She smiled again.
“Every teenager feels like that sometimes.” I argued. Luna’s eyes softened.
“Yes?”
“I understand boy stuff. He could have spoken to me.” My father said indignantly.
.” He warned.
“No need to spoil the surprise,” He laughed breathlessly, nipping at my neck and humming when my hands explored his torso.
“What are you- What would you ruin?” Harry’s hands twitched, and he tucked them behind his back carefully.
“How do you do that?” Neville asked. Ever since I tossed a piece of popcorn up and caught it in my mouth in the theatre, they had been obsessed with my skill.
“Quite.” He murmured, and stood up, leading me to the fiction section. “You may enjoy this one.” He pulled a fair sized book out of the shelf and handed it to me. I looked down at the cover, touching its spine.
“Look what Remus suggested for me.” I took the book, careful to keep his place. “It’s about immortals and a war with giant bugs. How cool is that?” I smiled and looked down at Draco’s bright eyes. I loved that look. I loved that kind of look on anyone. Knowing someone had something that made them happy made me happy. Whether it was through a book, or a coffee, I always wanted to give people that look in their eyes. That’s what Lunar Café was about. That’s what I was about. Making people happy. I handed Draco his book back, my heart sinking when I thought of my mother.
Seasons passed, and I experimented with my gained freedom. I found myself testing boundaries that had been set- Arriving home past my curfew, talking back, leaving my room messy, even sneaking a few sips from my godfather’s stash of alcohol. I waited for the rage that must follow, the shout or the raised arm, but the most that my actions would bring was a long talk about trust and responsibility, and being grounded a few times. Sirius was particularly gracious when I acted out- and I realised one day with a start that he could empathize. I wondered if my grandparents gave him the same growing room when they accepted him into their family. I asked him one night, and we spent a long evening in some form of tears, be it happy or painful, as he told me about his own years of healing.
“Is it too sweet? I put less sugar in the dough this time. I wanted to make a cream cheese icing. Can you taste it?” I sucked on my tongue, looking to the side so Harry’s face wouldn’t distract me.
“Well, darling, there will be other boys.” She stammered, still petting my hair.
“Every now and then, yeah.” He waved his mitts over the buns, helping them cool faster. Harry noticed me eyeing them and smirked. “Want one? I’m putting icing on them once they cool down a bit.” I almost drooled. They looked gooey and delicious and ohhh yeahhh…
“Oh, um... Yes. Yeah, I’m fine. How-um- How are you?”
“Goodnight.” He replied in kind, before walking into the house. I loitered helplessly for a minute or two before starting towards my apartment, feeling oddly drained.
“Hey, don’t I go to school with you?” The girl beside me asked suddenly, closing the book she was looking at. I blinked, looking her over quickly.
“Uh, a burn from work. It’s nothing.” He took his arm back, tugging his sleeves down again and folding them across his stomach. I looked at him for a moment in concern.
“He stayed over last night, actually.” Remus paused, looking as though he had something he wanted to say. He frowned to himself, resting a hand on the box, then smiled at me quickly. “What’s in the box?” Remus asked.
“I wanted to be like my father; in every single way.”
“Thanks.” He said softly, looking down at it. “Is it a feather?” He asked. I loved making shapes on the foam of the drinks. Customers were always impressed by how detailed I could get. I grinned and shuffled shyly.
We walked down the street, Harry pointing out the store Luna worked at. He slipped on ice and caught himself on my sleeve, giggling skittishly as I steadied him. He walked close to me afterwards, and I could feel how warm he was, how close he was. The shop was warm after being outside, and I pulled my coat off, leaving the jumper I was wearing underneath on. We ordered our food and sat down in a small booth, our legs touching underneath the table.  Harry glanced up at me from under his eyelashes, which were long like a girls’ and he was so perfect... I smiled at him and he grinned back, pulling his coat off. We fell into an easy conversation, Harry mostly listening. He gained some colour to his face while he ate, which pleased me. He still looked tired, though, poor thing.
“Cheers,” he said, lifting his glass towards me, “to being young and beautiful.” I snorted, but gently clinked our glasses together. I was used to the taste of wine, even enjoyed it, as my parents let me have a splash with supper here and there. Harry swallowed his with a pained expression, coughing afterwards. The sight nearly made me spit, and I saved it by laughing into my glass.
"What?" He asked, touching his cheek. "Is there something on my face?" I shook my head.
“I don’t really know her. I’m new here.” I scratched at my head nervously, and Harry nodded.
“No, I- I don’t want to hurt Harry.” I was quick to assure. “I want him to be happy, too.”
“Excuse me.” A voice startled me out if my staring, a girl with curly brown hair brushing past me and reaching for a book.
was behind the coffee counter making a latte for some lady with a cashmere scarf and there was a boy with brown wavy hair behind the main desk. He smiled at me when I walked in, Harry being busy with the person he was making coffee for. I smiled back, moving to the fiction section and looking for books with the same author as the last book I bought. I snuck quick looks at the green-eyed beauty while I looked. God, he was beautiful. His hands were so careful as he worked, and his smile made my blood race.
It was slow, and careful, and so, so good. It felt so right. I was entranced by his eyes as he bobbed his head, whether they were open or closed. I couldn’t hold my moans back if I tried, Harry rubbing the tension out of my legs as I let go. My confidence returned. When I settled between Harry’s thighs, I felt nothing but sex-drunk and powerful. We took turns building up, reaching a crescendo and riding the wave.
, Harry.” He moved the empty kettle away when I reached for it, my hearing going back to normal. His voice had an edge to it, and I felt his hand on my elbow, steadying me.
“Take your time. We can go to the moon when you’re ready.” A flicker of a smile crossed his face, and he held my arm tighter.
In which we meet Remus and Sirius, get a peek into Harry's life and Draco and Harry become friends for real?
“If anyone here is perfect, Harry, it’s you. If I can’t apologise, then neither should you.” He stared up at me, a little crease between his eyebrows as they drew together thoughtfully. A long, soft sigh left him, and Harry leaned into me again, burrowing his head into my shoulder once again.
I suffered a panic attack one day during school when our class was shown videos to encourage students against drunk driving. I was so out of it, caught up in memories and grief that the school had to call my aunt and uncle, and when they couldn’t calm me, Remus had to come. Everyone avoided me after that, rumors of schizophrenia and other mental illnesses spreading quickly. The stigma made me into a disease. Luna and Neville were my cure.
He looked up again when he neared the end of the aisle, and blushed deeply when I smiled at him, turning away so I could only see his profile. He was smiling, but turned his attention back to the books. I bit my lip and leaned against the counter, watching the way he pulled the books out to read their covers. I still wasn't sure if I was gay, but Remus was, and I didn't have a problem with homosexuality. I also wasn't afraid to admit when someone is attractive.
“Remus sent me up here for a sandwich.” I said embarrassedly. Sirius shot me a severe look.
"Can I help you find anything?" The boy startled, turning to face me. He had fine features, light skin and piercing, heart-stopping eyes. They were molten silver, cloudy skies, with sharp, cutting, cold icy blue flecks. I lost my words for a moment, mesmerized by those
“It’s sweeter than you usually make it.” His eyes narrowed in worry.
“Actually, his name is Sirius, but we call him Siri most of the time. He’s the kid in the family.” Harry said fondly, smiling. “I’m going to live with them eventually... When we go to the moon.” He shot me a grin, nudging me. His smile didn’t quite reach his eyes though, and it hurt me to think that he was unhappy at home.
“I’m not.” I denied, my voice hard and cold. Harry looked disbelieving when I turned around. “Well, I am. Not at you, though. Well, a bit.” I rubbed the cloth where the ice was, getting it damp. It was cooler when it was a little wet. I held it up to his face, trying to get it near his eye. Harry gently pushed my hand away.
“You’re really okay with it?” I asked, pausing in the middle of the sidewalk again, my heart lifting with relief. I had been so frightened...
“See that boy at the doors? That’s the kind you want to stay away from. He and Luna are total freaks. Not the sort of people you want to be seen with.” She smiled at me, like she was doing me a favour.
“So when you want to kiss me, you can. And if you want to spend more time together, just the two of us, you can tell me.” Harry kept his eyes locked on mine, eyebrows twisting up with a hint of guilt. “I know I’ve been through a lot, but I want you to be happy just as much as you want me to.” He smiled then, a suggestive twist of his lips followed by his teeth catching his lip. “And I want to fool around with you just as much as I hope you want to.”
“You’ll be late for work.” She said, her eyes lingering on my mum before travelling to look me over. “What happened to your arm?” The bandage covering my forearm was in plain view, and I grabbed my work shirt, tugging it on over my t-shirt and doing up the buttons.
“He doesn’t start until ten today.” Remus reminded me. “He likes to spend Sunday mornings with-” He cut himself off, biting his lip. “Uh, nevermind.” I suspected his girlfriend, and felt myself droop a bit. “Why do you ask?” I immediately blushed, looking down. “You fancy him, don’t you?” I looked up in shock and embarrassment. Was I that obvious?
school
“I know.” Luna pulled away and put her makeup back in her pocket, holding my hand and kissing my knuckles.
We met up with Draco’s friend group in some chain cafe, taking up the store’s large circular booth. There was Blaise Zabini; olive toned, darked haired and gorgeous. Then Theodore Nott; tall, wispy, with chestnut curls and shy hazel eyes. And of course Pansy Parkinson; short and curvy, with pale skin and contrasting pitch black hair. We spent some time listening to the three new people fill Draco in on how things were at his old school. Neville sipped away at his drink, politely paying attention. Luna seemed particularly drawn to Pansy’s intense energy. The four chatted away before Theodore slyly mentioned,
“What did you want to be when you grew up? When you were a child, I mean.” I was startled by the change in conversation, but went with it.
“That’s good.” Harry smiled. “I don’t think sons should be afraid of their fathers.” I nodded in agreement. Had he been afraid of his father? Oh, there was so much I wanted to know about him... His stomach growled, and he blushed brightly, his cheeks going red. “Oh, I’m sorry!” He seemed embarrassed.
“I’m not going anywhere.” He swore. “Come on, it’s getting really cold. I have to check on my mum before I go to bed.” We continued to his aunt’s house, walking close enough to brush against each other every now and then. “So... Do you fancy anyone at school?” I laughed a bit too loudly, afraid he had seen through me.
“I want to.” I insisted. “Come on, we’ll grab a bite to eat.” We stopped in a little pastry store, and I bought us both a hot meat pie, which we ate to keep us warm as we headed to Harry’s house.
I dared a look back at the attractive boy as I walked to the end of the aisle, only to find him still looking at me. He smiled, and I blushed, looking away to hide my own smile. The smell of coffee mixed with the smell of books, making me feel warm. I touched a few other books, pulling one out every now and then to read the inside cover.
I liked my new friends. They were all quite different people, which made hanging out with them new and exciting, and entertaining each time. Luna was... herself. She always wore cool or strange jewelry and was quite affectionate towards Harry and Neville. She also liked to read tarot cards for all of us and ask us if she was right the next day, which she often was. Neville was a bit awkward, though not as much as I was, and had a talent for taking care of plants. He and Harry met while working at the café and have been friends ever since. He was a bit shy, but opened up quickly once he got used to me. I didn’t understand why no one else at the school wanted to hang out with them. They were all very kind and hilarious, and loyal towards each other. They were both especially protective of Harry, which is probably why they tagged along on our not-really-date night.
I managed a polite reply as Harry dragged me back toward the stairs, firmly shutting the door behind us. We walked down into the main bookstore, Harry’s hand still lightly clamped on my arm.
“Thank you, lovely.” Luna danced forward to kiss my cheek. “Harry is coming soon; he just had to do something for his aunt before he could leave.” I nodded and ushered them out of the front hall, taking their coats and hanging them up for them. My parents had me well trained. My mother came out of my parent’s bedroom, my father trailing her silently.
“We love you, Harry. Don’t forget that.” I smiled at my godfather, nodding slightly.
I made a tumblr, there's not much on it right now, I don't go on tumblr a lot, but I'm hoping it will help me stay consistent with my posting, so if you're interested, it's
“Me too.”
Draco was still sitting and reading when I walked downstairs, that little crease between his eyebrows again. I wanted to press my thumb against it and smooth it out. My hands were shoved in my pockets to quell the urge. I slipped by quietly, knowing his type, like Remus, didn’t like to be disturbed while reading. Remus smiled at me when I passed the front counter, and I returned it shyly, putting the kettle on to boil. I made Draco’s usual latte, one sugar and some mint syrup at the bottom. He told me he liked the icy shock at the end the first time I made it for him. I used cream to make a quick feather design on top that I was rather proud of. He looked up quickly when I brought it to him, setting it beside him on the little table.
“If you’re getting involved with my godson, you’ll take good care of him.” Sirius interrupted. I met his intense gaze, blinking under the scrutiny. “Harry is one of the best things that’s ever happened to us. He doesn’t realise how much he means to us. You’ll be good to him.”
“Are you okay?” I asked, reaching out to touch her arm.
“Good.” Sirius nodded, reaching up to offer the bird on his head his hand. “I’m glad to hear it.” Harry bounded back into the room, looking suspiciously at his godfathers.
"The appointment was early this week, after what happened last week..." Remus cut me off, subtly gesturing his head towards the bookshelves. There was a customer here.
“Remus,” he mumbled, rubbing an eye, “Siri wants you to- Oh, Draco!” He seemed surprised to see me, before a look of realisation came over his face, and he glanced down at himself, turning beet red. “Oh, god. I didn’t think you’d be here today- Not that it’s a problem! I’ll…” He looked to Remus, looked to me, looked upstairs, then back at me. “I’ll be a second,” he sputtered, turning and rushing back from where he came.
.” I swiped at my eyes, rubbing away tears. “I... Siri and Remus say I should think about-” I cleared my throat, a lump suddenly appearing and blocking my words. “That it’s time to let you go. I don’t want to, but Vernon keeps saying how expensive it’s getting, and Dr. Inoue- er, Makoto, she told me you might not be waking up... since it’s been over two years...” I sat up, looking down at my lap. “Mum, if you’re still in there, I really need you to wake up.” My voice wobbled, and I fought to control it. “I know you can do it. I s-still have hope. Please...”
“Yes, definitely.” I leaned against his counter, laughing when he shooed me away to wipe it down. “You should get some bar stools here so people can sit and chat.” Harry looked up at me slyly.
“Y-yes?” I stuttered.
“I should go home soon.” I answered regrettably. “But I’ll see you tomorrow…?” I wanted to see him at school, too. Harry sighed, pushing his glasses up with the heel of his hand.
“Sorry.” I mumbled. “Thanks for the sandwich. I’ll see you later.” He followed me to the door, his face drawn with sorrow.
“I know it’s hard. I
“I know.” I mumbled. “I know you wanted me to find a wife and have a family, and I know I’ve disappointed you. I tried really hard to be straight, but it’s not who I am. I can’t help it.” I looked away from my father, tucking my hands under my thighs so I wouldn’t fiddle with them. He hated when I did that. It was silent for a moment, and I winced, regretting my words.
“Guard?” Luna nodded.
“What? What’s wrong?” Luna asked, looking confused.
A soft voice panted into my ear, a long body writhing against me. “
“I’m fine.” I insisted before he could get to lecturing me. I pinned my hair and reached down for the kettle, stumbling when I stood up again. My ears rang for a moment, my vision blurring. I shut my eyes tightly and ignored Remus’ muffled voice whispering urgently at me.
Thanks for sticking around!
“Harry and I are planning on going ice skating, and he said he had never been, so I brought some spare skates for him.” I scratched the back of my head sheepishly, “I mean, I didn’t want him to have to deal with gross rental ones, so…”
“You are close with your parents…” She began.
“A touch-up, silly. I used the code word.” My heart stuttered in worry.
“I hope you two aren’t harassing Draco.” He accused, easily taking my arm under his. I fought the butterflies that rose to my stomach.
Harry came back from a hallway off the living room, dressed in jeans and a black sweater. I couldn’t help myself from quickly looking him up and down, though I ripped my eyes from him as soon as I could, afraid of being caught by the two older men. Harry picked at his sweater, smiling at me. I got a closer look at his eye, which had darkened considerably since last night, and looked swollen and painful.
"Remus, I'm so sorry I'm late!" He said, his face softened with apology. My angle gave me a perfect view of bright green eyes. That boy was bloody cute. The man at the counter softened, sighing at the boy.
“Okay, okay.” I exited my coffee booth and started towards the back of the shop, where the spiral stairs that led to my godparents’ apartment was. I found Draco sitting in a cushy chair with his face in a book. “Draco.” I said happily, my stomach fluttering. Draco was the fourth friend I’ve ever made, and probably the most awkward, even more so than Neville. He startled, almost dropping his book.
“Why?”
“I don’t mind.” I assured him, hugging him firmly.
I sat down in silence, watching the mechanical rise and fall of her stomach as she breathed. I felt my familiar rush of guilt as I opened my mouth.
“Yeah, I can taste it. That’ll taste good if the buns aren’t too sweet.” Harry looked comforted, turning back to the cinnamon buns.
My heart lurched at the suggestion behind his words- both at the hint that my parents had something to be protective about that was beyond friendship, and at the identifying his godparents as his current parents. I searched his eyes carefully, trying my hardest to ignore the swell and bruise. I realised how close we were standing, truly alone together in the same room for the first time. I felt my hands clam up with sudden nerves, tension flickering between us. I wet my lips, unable to stop myself from stepping closer. Say something charming, I hissed at myself.
“No problem.” I relieved him, smiling to apologise. “Any tips for adjusting to our school?” Harry smiled again, this time genuinely, and poured a bit of milk in my tea before stirring it.
“Is he alright?” I heard my father ask in the hallway.
“No!” Harry laughed, “It’s romantic, Draco.” The unspoken ‘duh’ had me laughing too.
-Ray. (WammygirlZ)
"Uh, you too." I muttered, chastising myself internally.
“No, Harry!” I insisted. “Let me pay for my food, god damn it!” He shook his head, smirking shyly.
I ran full tilt down the street, pausing to lean against a streetlight and catch my breath.
“Don’t worry, I’m a careful person.” He chuckled lightly, making me shiver.
“Well.” Remus said, a smile creeping over his face. “Draco, would you like to come upstairs for a moment while Harry makes himself presentable?” I held in a chuckle, feeling an endeared blush come to my cheeks.
“I... I don’t think so.” I answered finally, Harry bumping into me as a couple walked down the street, Harry letting go of my arm. I had forgotten he was doing it until the sensation left.
“I know. I love you too.” I hesitated, glancing downstairs. “See you later.”
the time. Not just after school.” I saw him smile before he brushed a hand across his face, wiping the look away.
feel so
Wow! So much has changed in my life since I began writing this story.
“Hello.” I repeated curtly. She smiled at me.
I felt a light thrill go through my body when he looked over at me, grinning sheepishly. He must have thought I was staring because of his abrupt entrance. I was… A bit. But I was staring mostly because he was so. Fucking. Attractive! He was a bit on the short side, but had long (for his height, anyway), nicely shaped arms and a lithe torso. And he really was handsome, with a cute nose and a strong jaw, and those fucking
“Oh, you’re gay?” He didn’t sound as surprised as I thought he would.
, but please don’t do that anymore. It’s okay, Harry.”
It turns out the book I had bought was a romantic drama about a boy who was accepting his sexuality. It was a huge change from the books I usually got, but I related really well to the character and the ending left a fuzzy feeling behind. It wasn't quite as satisfying as an action adventure novel, but I still really liked it. I found myself back in the little shop three days later, browsing the fiction section once again for something similar.
“Break?”
“Yeah. And I’ll see you at school?” I walked myself to the door, reaching to twist the handle.
"Have a good day." The older man laughed. I noticed a long white scar then went from just under his eye to his jawbone when he smiled, feeling a rush of guilt for staring.
It was exactly this that caused my family to move in the first place. I had been attending a prestigious school in London, and doing rather well. I had a close knit group of friends and excellent marks. Then I came out as gay. Most of my friends were fine with it; Pansy claimed to have known all along, Theo was Bi himself, Blaise didn't care as long as he could make jokes and Greg looked unaffected. Vincent Crabbe, however, rejected the idea completely and outed me to the rest of the school. The effect was violent. I was harassed, ignored, shoved and even beaten, until my father stepped in and pulled me out of the school. We moved away, my mother needing a break from city life and my father getting a new placement in his job. I was relieved, but struggling to adjust. My new school was very accepting, and most of the students were friendly, but things were very different from how I had been raised in the sense that everything was very laid back.
“Oh…” he said shortly, taking the box from me. “But I feel fine, really,” he objected.
“Grabbing everything you own and bringing you
beside me, who were raving about some football game next week that Ginny was bound to win. I sighed and started the paragraph I was reading over again, having been distracted by the loud group at the table next to mine. They went quiet suddenly, which was much more distracting after their shouting and guffawing.
And afterwards we lay together, bare and a bit sticky, Harry smiling while touching the pink flush still spread across my chest. I kissed his head over and over, feeling so happy and free. My foot was somehow tangled in the blanket, and Harry kept adjusting his head uncomfortably, until I pulled him against my chest so he could relax.
“I thought your aunt and uncle were paying for all the medical things.”
Many, many things happened to me that have made me feel like a totally different person since I started Lunar Cafe. I escaped an abusive home, I moved to another province, have been working on my self confidence and recovering from the trauma I've experienced, been robbed at gunpoint (just to name a few major ones!).
“Well... I want you to be happy.” He played with his sleeves again. “And maybe I’m a bit curious. What’s your type?” He peeked up at me and good lord; if I had a type then it was him.
“I like them,” I decided, “Although I feel vaguely threatened. Should I feel threatened?” Harry laughed, stopping me near the coffee bar.
“You should put some cream on it; it must be pretty bad to have bled through like that.” Harry shrugged and nodded, picking at what was left of his food. He got strange, quiet and avoiding eye contact. I cleared my throat after a long moment of uncomfortable silence. “Um, maybe we should head back now. Your break will be over soon.” Harry sighed and leaned his head on his hand, looking at me. My stomach dropped, and I felt myself blush. Harry had this intense look in his eyes, the green seeming dark and
I also have horrible luck.
“No, I know that.” I cut her off, biting my lip. “I think he’s straight.” My mother was quiet a moment, not quite used to these problems either.
“Yes?” I answered, slightly harsher than I wanted to. I heard him sigh, careful footsteps crossing the tiled floor.
“How was your day, Draco?” He asked, his voice controlled.
“You never have to do anything you don't want to.” He said, “Not with me or anyone else.” I closed my eyes, leaning into his touch.
Luna didn’t approach me anymore after the one day we sat together, and I think it had to do with how Hermione told me I didn’t want to be seen with ‘Loony’ Luna Lovegood. Of course, I ignored her. Popularity meant nothing to me. It was all rather childish if you ask me, and I never approved of any kind of bullying, especially after what I went through. I never saw Harry in school, even though I kept my eyes open for him every day, looking between classes and at lunch. Wherever he hid, I wanted in. It must be peaceful.
“Calm down, Lucius. He just needs some alone time.”
“Yeah, in Chelsea.” He looked surprised, his eyes widening behind his glasses. “My father works in the government.” I explained vaguely. “You seem to lack a Leicester accent.” I pointed out. I found the accent rather entertaining, some of them living up to their nickname- Chizzets.
"The appointment was early this week, after what happened last week..."
“Who’s coming tonight?” Neville asked after a moment of comfortable quiet.
Harry and Draco go on a date, and someone makes a move.
“I would have been late.” I argued. “I really need this week.” I looked pleadingly at Remus, and he searched my face, frowning. I knew I looked bad. I had been more focused this week, spending more time with medication and therapy than on taking care of myself. I needed to do it though, it was important.
“Yes, we’ve made reservations in town. We trust Draco won’t make a mess.” Mother smiled at me. My mother and father went to get their coats on, and I followed to say goodbye. “Now, remember the rules, love.” Mother reminded me. “No alcohol-”
Through the coming months, Draco was there. Laughing until his face went red along with Neville when Luna showed us her new cat- who turned out to be a disgruntled but gentle raccoon. Luna grinned along as though she had gotten exactly the reaction she wanted. He was there, biting into his lower lip with his eyebrows creased, curled up on my godfather’s well-loved couch with a book in hand, making the chaos that surrounded him seem like pleasant background noise. He was there, shaking his head in amused disappointment when I confessed that my curfew ended half an hour ago, shooing me out of his fancy flat with a rushed kiss.
“Break.”
I was in his arms before I started to cry, feeling foolish for being a vulnerable fifteen-year-old, but his voice was soothing, and I felt so
I hadn't noticed before how much taller than me Draco was. It wasn't a huge difference, but enough that if I stood closer, I had to tilt my head back a bit to look at him. God, I wanted to kiss him. But he didn’t want my messed up problems. The fear in his eyes when he saw my bruise... No, I couldn’t do that to him. I didn’t deserve it. I didn’t deserve him.
“No, dear.
The next day, I pushed into Lunar Café with my shoulder, keeping a firm grip on the box I was holding.
“Yeah, sounds like fun.” I could feel my blush coming back, and I buried my nose in the soft fabric that smelled like his cologne. “But I’ll definitely fall on my ass, so you know.” Draco grinned, his cheeks going pink with happiness.
“Your father is the breadwinner of your family, and puts a lot of pressure on you in terms of your future.” I considered this, but still didn’t buy it.
“Everything will be okay,” I echoed, kissing his thumb.
“Thanks.” I murmured. “I was worried for some reason.” Harry rolled his eyes and stepped forward, hugging me tightly.
"Yeah?" I asked weakly.
he was wanted, and though I couldn’t say I was in love with him yet, I certainly wasn’t far off. I wanted to know about him. I wanted to know what his father was like, and what his mother is like. I just
“Have you ever been afraid of him?” Harry asked. I looked away from him for a moment as a car drove by, Harry nudging us away from the edge of the sidewalk a bit. I considered his question for a long while. Sure, my father was an intimidating man, but being behaved and being scared were two different things...We came out of the one of the urban parts of the town, coming to where most of the shops were.
“I know why.”
“No, no. Come in. Put that box down before you drop it.” Remus met me halfway and took the box for me, setting it down on his desk. He glanced at the coffee bar, then back at me and seemed to stutter. “Did you want a coffee?”
"Yeah. Come, sit here." Harry moved out from under me, pushing me where he wanted me to sit. I had to laugh at his forcefulness, oddly charmed. I sat at the head of the bed with my back against the wall, Harry lying between my legs and propping himself up on his elbows. I looked down at him as he pulled my trousers off, then started kissing his way up my legs. He gently mouthed over my pants, and I could feel his hot breath on my cock, making me sigh and roll my head back in pleasure.
“I’m not short! And I enjoy your company.” He blushed and turned away, checking the temperature of the buns with the side of his hand. He hummed thoughtfully and grabbed a spatula, moving them onto his cutting board. He faced me again with a big bowl in his hand, stirring it slowly. He held out the spoon for me. “Taste.” I stuck out a finger and he drizzled a bit of icing on it, like he usually did. I often tested new recipes of his. I popped my finger in my mouth, looking at him in consideration.
“You’ve gotten thinner. I can see it in your face. Are you not eating again, Harry? What did we
“It might be rough next week, but it’ll be fine after that.” I dropped my voice down to a whisper when Siri joined me, his bare feet padding against the floor. “I just want to be with mum.” I swallowed when my voice cracked. “Just for the last bit.” Siri sucked in a breath, sitting down beside me with his legs crossed. He traded me my sandwich for the ferret, rolling it over on his lap and rubbing its belly.
