“I like it when you’re cunning, Harry. Lock up and then we can head back to my flat to out plot the plotters.”
“I’ll take one pink and rainbow and three Christmas ones. Here. I’ll see you this weekend. ‘Mione’s been complaining that we’ve barely seen you recently.”
His father gave Harry a sharp look and unwrapped the box that was in front of him. He removed the lid and picked up the parent scroll that was inside. Draco was sure he had only read the first few words on the parchment before he dropped it and stared at Harry in a very unMalfoy-like way. His mother reached over and took the scroll but she didn't seem to get any further than his father had before she also dropped the parchment. He decided he needed to see what was written in the scroll which was so shocking it could cause both his parents to lose their composure and why it was something his, sometimes idiotic, partner thought would be appropriate as a Christmas gift.
“I felt like all I was doing in the Aurors was continuing the fighting that I had been doing through our school years. I needed to stop before it killed me and I thought I would see how my investment was doing from the inside. I’m normally in the workshop, but I help man the till over Christmas and the summer when it gets particularly busy and I cover Boxing Day, as the Twins have a tradition of getting very drunk. This is the fourth Christmas since I started working at the store. Would you like your refund in coins or transferred to your vault?”
“Would you like to come visit my flat after you have finished working, Potter? I think it would be fun to catch up.”
“Yeah, if he can get something he actually wants afterwards it will hopefully smooth any overly-ruffled feathers.”
I don't plan on continuing this series any more but I have kept notes on my ideas for WWW which may turn up in other fics I write
“No mother, I refuse to step foot into that Shop. I will just have to find something to do with this, I’m sure I can find something.”
“What if we create a wrapping charm which means you don’t even accept the present from Blaise? Make it look like an object you would never touch or something? That way, they won’t be watching the shop and we could spend the day together.”
“He has a month from the day of unwrapping to return it, as long as it’s undamaged. Don’t worry, all the information’s on the back of the receipt. That will be five Galleons and seven Knuts. Have a good Christmas, mate, and give Hannah my regards. Good luck with your father-in-law to be.” Harry called after Neville as he left the shop.
“Ok, well do you want me to wrap it in the Peek-Proof-Paper we just introduced? The paper is spelled to prevent any peeking before the date included in the spell, all child-safe and accidental magic safe. Christmas themed paper will open on the 25th, Yule themed on the 21st, all other paper requires a staff member to spell the correct date into it before it is used.”
I planned to post this on Sunday with the other fic's epilogue but had a migraine so you get it today (with the epilogue)
“Ron didn’t buy anything, but the group of conspirators appears to have expanded by one. Neville bought one a few weeks back and apparently somehow passed it on to Blaise.” Harry looked down at the box Draco put on the counter.
“Why would I care about saving you money when you bought the ridiculous thing in the first place!?” Draco playfully shoved the other man's arm off his shoulders.
Draco had worked himself up into a bundle of nerves over the afternoon, and as the day wore on he had gone from irritated at Harry for working on his day off, to mad that he hadn’t been there to keep him from working himself into the panicked frenzy he was now in. He turned towards the small hallway as he heard the door open.
“Draco, Love, I was hoping they would try for at least one more year. I was going to swap their gift out for this when I wrapped it for them.” The brunet pulled a box out of his pocket and got down on one knee next to the table. Green eyes met grey. “Will you do me the honour of marrying me, my Love?”
He looked over to Harry and saw him turning a Dark green wand holster over and over in his hands. “This is basilisk hide isn’t it, It’s been almost eight years but I don’t think I could ever forget what it looked like. Thank you so much for this.” he pulled up his sleeve along his right arm and carefully fastened the holster to his forearm. He pulled his wand out of the holder he kept on his belt and slid it into the new holster before flexing his arm and wrist. “This is brilliant and so useful. But please, open your gifts, this shouldn’t just be about me and Draco.”
“Mrs Mal-” she gave him a look, “Narcissa, you don’t need to thank me. You and Draco had both already saved my life by the time I pulled him from the fire and while your husband might have been a willing follower of Riddle at first, by the end you all were prisoners here, and he had not caused anywhere near the amount of death or destruction than any of the other Death Eaters, so I never thought he deserved to be sent to Azkaban.”
“Though you are lucky, Ron spent almost the entire morning hanging around the shop. He wasn’t particularly subtle and it’s not like there have been any customers. ‘Mione dragged him back home at lunchtime. Apparently, there was only so long she was willing to deal with Rosie on her own. But I’m sure he was trying to see if you were going to come in to return the tie.”
“We want you to take over running the investments using the family vault, Draco. All the suggestions you have made so far have been more successful than we ever expected, and we feel that you will be able to keep this going even with your commitments. We are proud of how well you have been managing to balance your training and your commitment to our family.”
They were both stunning. This wasn't news, especially not to him, as the guy--what was his name? Alex?--had been the reason for Harry walking straight into a pillar upon his arrival to Hogwarts.
His breaths were choked out of him, his chest refusing to expand with each inhale. "Getting mated was, was s'pposed to fix e'rything, s'not, tisn't-" he tried to force the words out of him, but the more he tried the heavier his tongue. Draco's vision was blurring from the sudden onslaught of tears that spilled down his cheeks.
Harry sat at the foot of the bed to catch his breath. "What was that? That Cassie did? I thought sirens couldn't influence other sirens."
But it was information that had to be disclosed. Voldemort was after sirens, desperate for their allegiance (or at least their unwilling cooperation) for his efforts in the war. It had been stressed at many Order meetings how the sirens' involvement could make or break Voldemort's schemes.
He got up as Corey handed off the crate and turned to leave, putting himself in his path. Corey tilted his head with a smirk, the question in his eyes.
He was going to be sick. "Wait, are you saying that She's considering aligning herself with the Dark? Against Dumbledore?"
So, yes, sue him for deciding that he wasn't going to just sit there and let things happen. Prophecies were vague as hell, which meant that all the actors behind the scenes would easily go unnoticed. No one even thought to tell him to keep his nose out of it, because they all assumed that Cassie would be the one to get in the proverbial way.
Moody's biological eye widened just as much as Potter's, the Auror's Adam's apple bobbing with a nervous swallow. The sight was honestly unsettling, seeing the brash Defense professor looking that rattled. While Draco knew his godfather to be powerful, most of the time his threats were empty, all bark and no bite. At least, where Draco was concerned. Clearly, others had quite the wrath to be fearful of.
They were in Draco's dormitory, which had once again been rearranged to accommodate new circumstances: the room was mostly the same but had taken on an extra three doorways. The first was just a passageway that connected directly to Severus' office for ease of access, one was Corey's new bedroom, and the other had three spare beds inside.
"You absolute fucking fool! He doesn't trust you because you only see her as a pawn! She's important because she's his fucking daughter! Maybe we should have gone to the dark side for protection, because at least they'd value our lives! The goddamn fucking murderers!
"It's like, it's..." Harry finally looked up to bore into his eyes. "It's pure. It's like when you have to cast a spell in front of the whole class, and you're thinking about making a fool of yourself in front of them, and worrying about having food in your teeth or your robes on backwards. But when you're in that state, there's none of that. It's just your emotions, stronger than ever, and your mind is clear. Like what it feels like after a fresh kill, or in the dead calm of night when the only sound is the crash of waves."
Potter looked like someone had knocked over his morning porridge, the utter confusion on his face most pitiful. McGonagall then stormed out of the room, likely wishing to claim credulity to the aftermath of her suggestion.
"It is unfair what I asked of you. It's better this way. You may not see it now, but you will. I know I have not always been the greatest father, but I have loved you more dearly than anyone else in my entire life, and I will love you even after I'm gone. Andrew, he'll-" he choked back a cry, "he'll be there for you better than I ever could. If your mother could see you two now, she'd be so proud. You're too good for this world, and what it asks of you is unjust. But you cannot follow me in my missteps, and I'll be damned if you get caught up as I try to right my wrongs. I'm so sorry, my little star.
They were good for the war, but nothing else. No siren would be surprised if at the end of the day, the Ministry threw them away like trash, hunting them down and skinning their tails despite their cooperation. Wizards weren't to be trusted. Only sirens would look out for sirens. Harry Potter would never be fully on Draco's side. Their kiss meant nothing. Potter was likely delusional from shock, had only kissed him because he had no clue.
"It's time," she told them, and Draco crammed in a few more bites downed by a splash of tea before pulling the hood up over his face. Cassie was more of a sloth in her movements, taking her time to straighten her robes upon standing, a picture of elegance. Draco wasn't going to lie, he had been bubbling with a mix of both nerves and excitement for the past few days.
Harry swallowed down the lump in his throat before answering, "There's nothing that anyone can do or say to talk me out of this now."
"Is that so?" Draco's breath tickled his cheek, grey eyes searching. Harry nodded quickly, his neck pinching from the tense motion.
The doors opened, McGonagall hurrying over to Snape. She grasped the other professor's forearm with both hands before leaning in to mutter something unintelligible to Harry. As Snape processed her words his face changed into a calmer demeanor, his posture going rigid as the fidgeting was trampled from existence. Harry caught the end of Snape thanking McGonagall, then realized he'd been given a sleeping draught. His eyelids grew heavy--as did his bones--as he sunk into a dreamless sleep.
"Potter, this obsession you have with me is quite unhealthy. Have you considered going to a Mind Healer and getting your head checked?"
Hermione raised an eyebrow, her expression gone cold. "Oh? Is that all I'm good for, being friends with Harry Potter?"
Potter leapt out from behind a pillar, practically stabbing his wand into Draco's throat. For fuck's sake, how hard was it to avoid getting the Scarhead's attention 'round here? Was there no one else he could bother?
Despite it being the most awful conversation he had ever had to have in his entire life, talking to Corey was easy once he got the ball rolling. Returning the agate had lifted most of the weight from his shoulders. However, it was almost frustrating how well Corey took it, even with the clear sadness in his eyes.
All attention was on him as any student in hearing distance asked after the identity of the student. Who died? If this was anything like the Chamber of Secrets, wouldn't they have been locked up in their respective house? Unless it was like last year when Sirius broke into the castle, but then again, they had been immediately moved to the Great Hall. Today they had waited until breakfast to summon them...
Andrew held out a crinkled piece of parchment, charmed waterproof by the looks of it. Draco took it from him like it was a delicate piece of china, folding it out carefully as he recognized his cousin's careful script. Harry shifted to read over his shoulder, and Draco angled it so he could see it better.
Severus stood slowly, walking to the door like he was stepping around broken glass. Yet Draco's eyes never left his cousin's and the look of pity that they held. She knew he hated pity from others' and she wasn't even attempting to hide it.
He was curious, after breakfast, what they possibly could have wanted him for in the Second Task. He obviously could not risk making them believe he'd even consider the idea of volunteering himself, with the task being in the Black Lake and all...
As he stood there, he watched the other four of his pod splash about, their roughhousing a common sight. Draco envied their true forms, wishing for his development to be complete already so he could be like them too. It'd be a full year before he'd get there, but next summer for certain. Then he would be the envy of someone else, not the other way around.
Cassie jumped in, grabbing both their arms and leading them towards the sofa. "So! That essay for Potions, am I right?"
"The Black line doesn't have a history of siren blood, from my recollection," Tonks added. Both her and Sirius looked pointedly at Snape to provide answers.
At least the rumors were contained to just the Slytherins. Perks of being in the house with the united front; everyone rather keeping to their kind than risking the unreliability of the other three. Draco wondered briefly, what it would be like to be in his situation in any other house. The Ravenclaws seemed the type to see past the lies, capable enough to figure him out. The Hufflepuffs might be too dunder-headed to think much of his illness, more likely to try and smother him and annoy the living hell out of him.
Umbridge's lips were pursed, the toad looking like she had bit into something sour. She likely hadn't anticipated the two of them teaming up against her, especially not like this.
"And, you know what the best part is? It's not even because she's a beast. You've done it to everyone! Severus, Cassie, Harry! We mean nothing to you unless we serve a purpose, our lives are only worth saving until that purpose runs up! What do you have to say for yourself, you fucking monster?!"
"Surely you've considered Mr. Potter might benefit from more positive role models in his life," Umbridge preached, "The boy has surely been through quite troubling experiences and having to be confounded by two fatherly-figures, one inadvertently scarred from Azkaban, and another who cannot even be there for him full-time... It's a shame, really."
"Is it just me, or are they getting easier to kill these days?" he asked, and Andrew scoffed as he swam over to him.
He had looked more corporeal than the ghosts of his parents. Had felt solid under his hands, soft as they kissed. He'd looked
She rolled her eyes. "He's also well aware you're a siren. That didn't deter him in the slightest from drooling at the sight of you this afternoon."
Pitch-black and predatory, Draco's eyes served as a firm reminder of how deadly he could be. Just like the first time he saw him like this, Harry felt anything but afraid. He bit back a groan, and Draco leaned in, hot breath ghosting over the shell of his ear.
"It's beautiful," was all he could manage to reply. And, it was. A lighter blue that was almost lavender, the stone had wispy bands of white and bleached violet layered throughout.
Not that he minded. It was nice to have people that cared. Both had done more than either of his parents combined. Father almost acted as though Draco wasn't there sometimes. He had yet to send any sort of letter this far into the year, and hadn't corresponded with him over summer either. His mother, with whom he had sent daily letters over the summer, regularly sent him letters and parcels of treats each week. But she'd been quite unhelpful on the Siren front.
It was Draco's turn to snort. "We're not Gryffindors, we actually have a sense of self-preservation, thank you very much."
Madam Pomfrey finished cleaning his wounds, shoving a potion into his hand for him to drink. Snape was still hovering nearby, likely on Dumbledore's orders, eyes flicking over to the doors every few seconds. The man was fidgeting, something Harry didn't even know Snape was capable of, like a bird itching to take flight. Was this about Mad-Eye turning out to be Barty Crouch Jr.? Or did it have to do with Voldemort's return?
"The five types of sirens are Sea Devil, Sea Demon or Hellfire, Moonbeam, Sounding Tomb Siren, and Nightingale," she supplied, putting an emphasis on her know-it-all voice.
He sucked in a breath as he collected his bearings. Focused on following Andrew's steady directions.
"We had to dump the bodies in the sea and get rid of the surviving witness. Ironically, not the first time we've been in that particular scenario. But, uh, after I drowned the poor sod, Andrew made this offhand comment. About how he 'wouldn't want to be an accomplice to murder with anybody else.' Then he just smiled at me, and I knew. I was in too deep."
It hadn't been that long ago, in this very room, that he had danced and laughed and looked so vibrantly alive. He had looked fine. Hadn't he been fine? He couldn't remember the last interaction he had with the blond. He'd seen him, before the Second Task, sat with his cousin at breakfast. Draco had looked tired, certainly, but he was still up and about.
"She- She said, she would be right back, but then she was taking so long, so I went- She wasn't there, or anywhere, she just, where would she be? Then I looked, and found the note, and she's not there, Dray, she's not- She's not-"
"Draco," the eldest siren reasoned, "you're going feral. You love Harry, and he loves you! Meanwhile the Dark Lord is looking to bond you to him! What exactly isn't worth it? This is a two birds, one stone situation!"
"Ron!" he complained, craning his neck around the corner to watch the three head towards the dungeons.
He stumbled to his feet to assess the scene before him. Potter was running in his direction. Draco looked down, the cloaking spell was still active. Potter couldn't see him, nor could-
to feel that way about him. With ample time, sure, maybe, but you can't force romantic attraction. If it were that easy, the world would run quite differently. 'Sides, we already knew that it was always going to be Potter."
"It's time to get moving," Cassie quietly announced, and within the blink of an eye Draco was now seated on the Hogwarts express, watching through the window as Narcissa's smiling face grew further and further away from him.
Severus walked over to Draco to wrap an arm around his shoulders, allowing him to tuck his face into his godfather's shoulder. He could feel the traces of Cassie's magic still clinging to the man's cloak.
Draco laid on the ground of the bathroom floor, ready to hex anyone that tried to move him. He had barely slept a wink last night thanks to his stupid gills that were coming in on both sides of his rib cage. It wasn't even as excruciating as when his spines were manifesting. It was the type of ache that persisted no matter what position he laid in, aggravating enough that he had yet to find a singular position where the ache lessened even slightly.
Krum blinked in confusion, and that was when Draco saw Potter and Diggory arguing next to the Triwizard Cup. The hedge walls began to shift, cutting Krum off, and Draco yanked on Cassie's sleeve to pull her towards the two Hogwarts Champions. Krum would be safe now. Hopefully.
Madam Pince announced the library was closing, and everyone began to pack their bags and return to the dormitories. As they all grew closer to the Slytherin dormitory entrance, Draco lightly grabbed at Blaise's wrist.
He entered the tunnel that led into the castle. Cassie and Andrew had beat him here, he could sense them already up near the surface. Maybe they'd be blind to the obvious guilt on his face?
Cassie had passed out with her head resting between the bed and the wall. Snape quickly moved to get her back into bed with Andrew not too far behind him. The latter turned to help him lift Draco up once she was settled, and despite his small frame Draco was unbelievably heavy. All that siren muscle had to go somewhere, he guessed.
Moody's face had fallen flat. He seemed as if he accepted this losing battle, in a room where he had no allies. Not even Potter, who had some sort of weird attachment to the Auror.
He felt helpless as he soaked her robes with snot and tears. As she rocked him gently, shushed his cries and whispered empty assurances into his ear.
Draco slapped the hand away before it could touch him. "Don't touch me! I'm a beast! I could kill you right now if I wanted to."
Cassie was audibly shivering in the bed just a few feet from his. Andrew had been forced to go to the Islands to meet with the Elders for a reason he'd been tight-lipped about before leaving, and Cass was too out of it from her pain-killing potions to be able to pry it out of him. Their symptoms had diverged almost overnight, hence him burning up and Cassie freezing cold, but the new Seer part of his brain told him that wasn't why Andrew had been called to that meeting. He would get better physically soon, but thinking about his near future beyond that filled him with a familiar sense of dread. The stink of death was almost upon him, yet he would not be the source.
The far wall had an entrance to a spiral staircase. Corey was standing next to it and looking at Draco in a way that made him suspect he had been waiting for him to catch his eye. He strolled over, letting Corey hook an arm in his before ascending.
Dumbledore cleared his throat once more, reigning the room in with the simple sound. "Alastor, the offense you have committed is entirely unacceptable. I cannot let it go unpunished."
Draco hummed for him to continue, patting the empty space on his bed. Harry shuffled forward, skittish as a cat as he took a seat.
Draco wiped the blood from his mouth, wiping it off against his scales and letting the crimson dissipate in the water. The Death Eater that Andrew had yanked from his broom sank faster than an anchor towards the bottom of the ocean, face suspended in a state of shock, eyes wide with fear.
Cassie was uncharacteristically subdued. Aegeus had ordered she be dosed with a potion before the meeting, and Draco wanted to carve the proud smirk off of his face when the potion took effect. He'd likely have to get in line, however, with the murderous intent that was clear in Andrew's eyes. Damn Andrew, only he could make bloodthirst look attractive.
That was it. The rest of Slytherin didn't give Malfoy any flack for his sudden change in behavior, treating him just the same, if not
Refusing to look at her, knowing he'd burn up with embarrassment at the look she was most definitely giving him, he began to disrobe and make his way out onto the porch. Corey followed, going to close the door behind him, when Cassie decided to get her two cents in.
“No, no, I refuse. That’s disgusting!” Draco started walking away from his friend. “And tell Theo that I won’t accept his gift either if it is also wrapped in a frog.”
The next morning, he marched into the gaudy building that housed the Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes store and, ignoring all the ostentatious displays, made his way directly to the counter at the back of the store. There were a few customers around and Draco thought he could see the distinctive Weasley red hair out of the corner of his eye. Without looking at the person behind the counter he put the box on the table, with the receipt on top.
Draco thrashed from where he was being restrained by four sirens, eyes pitch-black and teeth sharp as razors. Unlike the previous times Harry had seen him like this... He didn't seem like Draco anymore. Didn't seem to recognize his surroundings.
Perhaps... Chang? Diggory was friendly enough towards him, but Draco didn't think he was more important to the Hufflepuff than his girlfriend. Unless Diggory was fiercely in the closet, which would add up considering he was an only child, but Draco always considered the Diggory family to be on the more progressive side of wizarding society.
Cassie stepped in between them. "Were you not present when I informed you of my cousin's illness? Not everything is about you, Potter. Draco is gravelly ill, and he doesn't need the headache you bring on top of the rest of his pain and suffering. Now, if you bother him just one more time about whatever lunacy you've turned to next... The Triwizard Tournament will be the least of your worries. You may just find yourself expelled from Hogwarts and inadmissible to any decent Wizarding School worldwide. They'll break your wand and make you more of an outcast than you already are. Now,
Granger perked right up, eager to discuss the assignment. Leave it to Cass to save the mood. After that, it was easy for Draco to get into the discussion, enjoying the mirth that Granger's intelligence brought to the table. They quickly moved on from Potions to Transfiguration, and then somehow got onto Xylomancy, which was the last thing Draco wanted to hear about.
Draco, having only woken up less than a half hour ago, found his way to the kitchen. Andrew was there--likely avoiding getting dragged into the conflict--and he wordlessly slid a plate of grape leaves over to Draco.
"I can think of a few reasons why Ilvermorny refuses to participate in this hodpodge. Are there no statutes in place to prioritize students' safety? A challenge like this would be much better for students that have already graduated, or at least have made it close enough to graduating. Who in their right mind thought that this was a good idea? Wouldn't it be more constructive to have, like, a big Quidditch tournament?"
"Fucking hell, I said not to crowd him!" Andrew smacked someone's leg before returning his full attention to Draco, using the sleeve of his night robe to wipe the vomit from his face.
Huh. It was the first time Harry had ever heard her last name. He'd seen it last night, on the map, but he'd assumed that it was also Malfoy for the longest time, seeing as everyone referred to her as Cassie.
They continued towards what Draco suspected was Dumbledore's office. They got to a griffin statue, the password as simple as 'Chocolate Frogs,' and the griffin leapt out of their way.
but it's aight because I kept saying I wanted to learn a third language fluently and now I'm being held accountable and actually learning one so???
switching up the timeline just a bit, but Harry's still as clueless as ever, so what's really changed?
"Cassie?" There must have been something in his voice, for she was quick to look at him in concern. "What do I do if someone finds out? What if I can't keep it secret? What if a potion explodes in my face during class and they rush me to the hospital wing and then Dumbledore finds out?"
trigger warnings for mentions of drowning/violence/mentioned non-con in mythology (all not explicit in their descriptions)
And thus had started his tumultuous journey with the pod of teenaged sirens. It was difficult to interact with them at first, their customs not even the exact opposite of Draco's. It was more like they were going by entirely different books, but theirs was in Ancient Greek and written both backwards and upside-down.
Hermione glared at him from the desk to his left. She was taking plenty of notes for the two of them, who cared if he knew the theory behind bonding magical cores between species! If they could just tell him what they needed him to do, this would be much less painful for everyone involved.
The hairs on the back of his neck prickled. Someone was watching them. He blearily scanned his surroundings, but he was closer to passing out cold than being an effective lookout. Andrew and Cassie had stopped in their tracks, likely sensing the same thing. Survival instincts were silly that way.
Although, it was only the sirens (and Harry and Hermione) that were in on the know. Small miracles, and all that. He was grateful for their help, really, but they also didn't have much of a choice. Thanks to the prophecy, they'd bend over backwards for him (but only for things concerning the outcome of the war, they weren't about to serve him everything on a silver platter).
Something wet poured over him; cold this time, not warm like fresh blood. As the pain washed away and the wound healed itself, he came to the embarrassing realization that the sound he'd heard hadn't been the rushing of blood in his ears, but the trickle and rush of a small fountain.
He gripped Cassie's hand even tighter, tight enough that maybe he could get some of her strength from the contact. As shouting voices of concern mounted in volume, McGonagall and Dumbledore and Snape rushing to the trembling boy with Aurors not far behind, his grip tightened to the point that he was certain he had just broken two of his fingers.
Draco had felt so real that Harry questioned if the event had actually occurred. Because, as he opened his eyes once more, Draco was gone without a trace. Vanished into thin air without even the slightest of sounds. Because he was still dead. Like his parents, he'd been there to save him, even if it didn't add up.
"I'm just saying, if the system is this easy to play, maybe it's time to reform the system. So many weak spots is like asking for someone to come and corrupt it. I still can't wrap my head around a bunch of adults not putting the pieces together that Harry Potter, of all students, is the one who gets his name unwillingly put in the Goblet! Ah fuck, my tea's gone cold. But if the damn thing's only supposed to allow one student from each school, what if someone went and said they went somewhere else, like Ilvermorny? What's the damn cup to know any different?"
As Draco's godfather and surrogate healer at Hogwarts--especially when you considered how he bore witness to the horror that was Draco's siren transformation last year--he'd only find it unpleasant if Draco weren't sickly and possibly dying.
"Can I, um, can I share something with you? Something you'll promise to keep to yourself?" He couldn't meet her eyes, or the lump in his throat would grow to the point where he wouldn't be able to breathe, let alone finish this conversation.
The other eleven sirens stayed fast asleep around them. Even Cassie, who was so deep in slumber a small puddle of drool was forming on Andrew's shoulder. If only he had a camera.
Cass took a sip of her tea from where she was sat at the edge of the pool. "That passageway was formed when you were born, all that had to be done was shed some skin. The bleeding should stop in the next hour or two, but you're not going to be able to walk any long distances for the rest of the day."
"The conditioner will promote blood circulation to the area," Cassie explained without prompting, "You should apply it at least once a month, but also on new scales that come in after an injury to prevent infection."
did you really think I was going to use my Song on Dumbledore?" her voice was closer to a stage-whisper than an actual one, and the two professors in front of them could definitely hear that snippet of conversation.
Draco stood in the wine cellars of Malfoy Mansion. It was dimly lit, but he'd recognize it anywhere. He turned slowly on his heel as he took in the room he didn't anticipate ever seeing again.
Hermione raised her hand before speaking, even though the classroom was vacant except for the three of them.
He turned to the two sirens. "The walls are charmed to part for magical creatures, yourselves included. The Champions will enter the maze at staggered intervals with the goal being to reach the Triwizard Cup at the center of the maze. There are many dangers that lie inside to deter them, but Miss Prince has assured me that she has amply prepared you both should you find yourselves in trouble."
Draco easily got lost in his head as they arrived at Hogsmeade, Cassie gently guiding him under the appearance he was escorting her, her hand curled around his bicep and tucked in by his elbow. He felt nauseous. Maybe this had been a mistake. The solid ground beneath his feet felt like a thousand pinpricks, he longed to be nearer to the Great Lake. The air was suffocating, he desperately craved the comforts of water pressure pushing in on him like a firm hug, the weight of its resistance slowing everything down around him.
Moody grimaced, sending a hex in her direction, and--arm still outstretched--Cassie flicked her wrist. The hex bounced right off of her.
And thank modern architecture for its strange obsession with placing indoor water features inside buildings with large walkways. It was a peaceful reminder of nature, sure. But it felt so out of place when it had been brought into a place that had been lacking, the water confined to cycle through pipes and waterways and forced away from its natural habits.
The door opened. That was not the case. Dumbledore and Snape strolled in, both unfazed by his presence. In fact, Dumbledore came and sat on the other end of the couch, giving him a twinkling wink. Draco and Andrew pulled apart, and Draco came to lean on the chair of the couch nearest to him, despite there being space to sit. Harry didn't fail to miss the weary glance that was given to Dumbledore before being concealed behind an uncaring mask.
"You were in bed and not out in the corridors, and that's frankly all I care about at the moment. What I want is for you to promise me to let Severus and the Order handle this, and for you to not go rushing unprepared into certain death."
"Would it be awkward for one of us not to move out? Would it be awkward if we did? Should I talk to him before moving out, or just do it quickly to avoid the conversation? Should I be the one to ask him to leave?" he rambled.
It still wasn't that late, and Peeves did not appear to stall them as they made their way back. However, a much unlikelier foe decided to make an appearance.
She ducked back behind the pillar, inching her head around the corner ever so slowly. She bit back a gasp as she watched Professor Snape and Cassie dance a slow waltz to the muted orchestra floating in from nearby.
He nodded, feeling his lungs deflate in defeat. It really hadn't been anything more than a crush. Maybe it also had to do with the feeling that one of his closest friends was abandoning him, his cousin-kinda-not-cousin moving on with her own life while Draco was still trying to unravel his. Was that really what this was about? With all of these uncertainties piling up, had Draco finally reached his breaking point?
When he opened his eyes the next time, he was tucked into his bed. His robes had been changed, and their was no lingering taste of vomit on his breath. There was a vial of Dreamless Drought on his nightstand, and a small bowl of oatmeal placed under a stasis charm. Sunlight trickled in through the stained glass windows of his room, the rays fluttering about as a result of the lake water they had to breach to travel this far down.
"It's just a term we use for unstable sirens. Nightingales are most sensitive to becoming unstable, because our magic is regulated by the moon, but any siren can get that way if there's a perceived threat great enough. Like, if Cassie saw someone flirting with Andrew, she could go feral just because their bond was recently threatened. Honestly, though, she's probably just being overly protective. This whole week she's been acting like he's going off to war on another continent."
Andrew leaned back in his seat, shoulders slumping as the ire drained from his body. Defeated. As though he had considered the exact same thing. He had yet to face Draco to his right, and wished desperately for the growing silence to end. Building himself up, he braved turning to his side.
The floor-length fishtail dress was reminiscent of her siren form. It was the same deep black of her scales; the kind of black that was not an absence of color, but one that appeared to devour its surrounding light, forcing your attention to the wearer. Unlike the blinding sun that stunned you upon first glance, she was the polar opposite of brightness, drawing your eyes to her like a black hole pulling you in.
She seemed ready to keep going, so he held up a hand to stop her. "Slow down, we're just going to brush past you mind-manipulating the great Albus Dumbledore AND an auror-turned-professor?"
"Harry, don't look at me like that! Only an idiot would find Andrew unattractive, the amount of times I've had to listen to Draco wax poetry about his scales it's no wonder I picked up a thing or two..."
His mother was unwavering as she approached Griphook and asked to be escorted to the Black family vault. Draco was amazed at how well she portrayed herself as unafraid, wondered how easy it came to her, if it had gotten easier with practice... He hoped he mimicked even a modicum of her confidence.
"Cassie is sweet, I don't know how many times I have to tell you," Hermione contributed, albeit looking grateful the conversation was beginning to take a turn.
He elbowed her ribs, and the Hufflepuff on her other side lightly glared as they were shoved to the side as Cass tried to evade the assault. None of the badgers dared say anything, however, as the one bracing herself to speak up was cut off by Cassie's head snapping to look at her.
Even with the aid of the potion, the itching felt like being bitten by thousands of fire ants. Severus had begun brewing a numbing draught after dinner but it was unlikely to be finished for another hour.
Their cackling died down, leaving them both laying there side-by-side staring up at the pink and orange paint strokes in the sunset sky. Draco felt like his whole body was thrumming with happiness.
Cassie was just as lost for words as he was. She shrugged, and they moved along, not having the time for a discussion.
Draco's suspicions regarding Mad-Eye Moody quickly turned into paranoia. Defense Against the Dark Arts suddenly having a lesson on Sirens? Despite starting with the three Unforgiveables, completely unrelated to magical creatures? Quite the turnaround.
Cassie scoffed, "yeah, just like how She was the one to tell you to have us poison ourselves, makes a whole lot of sense."
The entrance door swung open with a telltale creak, barely-there footsteps indicating Cassie had returned. Knowing there was gossip to be shared, he was grateful he was mostly finished with his schoolwork for the day.
Severus stood with his spine ramrod straight to the point where Draco wondered how much pain the posture was bringing to the Potions master.
Cassie grinned, spinning out of his room, her robes outlining the movement as they disappeared from his view. At least someone had fun today.
He shot up from his seat, blinking away the stinging in his eyes. "How can She ask this of you? She's risking you, your life! What about Andrew? What about me? We need you!"
"Actually, can we stick together? I feel like I'll get lost in here otherwise, parting walls or not."
What proved more challenging was the curriculum being taught to him by Cassiopeia. Sat together in a clearing of the Forbidden Forest, he carefully laid his twigs out in the formation Cassie had drawn in his notebook for him.
The next time the four were together they discovered what the smoke had done. They could only speak together if there was a fifth person with them. Anytime the four were alone together no words would come out of their mouths. This effect was only lifted at the joint Malfoy-Potter bachelor’s party on Christmas Day, right before the wedding.
“Well at least it’s not a frog this time. But how are you still not out of wrapping paper from that shop?”
Harry wasn’t even sure why the Twins felt the store should be open on Boxing Day. He didn’t think anyone would want to go out and shop, unless absolutely necessary; most people would be recovering from the large amount of food and alcohol they’d consumed on Christmas Day. There hadn’t been a single customer since he had opened the shop that morning, though he was enjoying using the quiet to work out the bugs in his current project. Since the store was quiet, the bell that announced the door had opened seemed overly loud, as it was usually lost in the noise of the shop.
He turned and looked back at Blaise. “And when did the two of you start reading muggle fairy tales, anyway?”
Once everyone was finished the group moved back into the sitting-room he ended up back on the sofa they had sat on earlier, with Harry sat on a cushion at his feet. Once everyone was sat down he watched Victoire carefully make her way to the pile of presents under a tree in the corner of the room and start to pass them out. After she had returned to her parents Harry passed out their gifts. He watched the reactions to his gifts hoping that there weren’t any bad reactions.
He looked down his clothes and winced when he saw his tie. What had been plain black was now a riotous mix of every colour imaginable, each one clashing madly with its neighbours and the rest of his clothes.
He watched his parents first open his gifts and put them to one side and then all that was left on the table were the two parcels from Harry. His mother was the first to open her present but she had barely opened the box before she started sobbing.
He had agreed to meet Draco at their flat before they would make their way to the muggle pub their friends had taken to plotting about them in.. It had originally been Draco’s, but Harry had moved in just before the peak of summer business that year.
“Draco, Darling, this one appears to be for you.” His mother passed a particularly brightly wrapped parcel to him.
“I have to admit that the way the Twins applied the house colours was almost tasteful with this line of products” Harry looked at the box for the floating ashtray in Slytherin green and silver. “Who’s this for, then? I didn’t think any of your family smoked.”
“I wouldn’t even let Blaise hand it to me. I acted like a complete drama queen, and almost channelled my eleven year old self and told him my father will hear about this.”
“I did. It’s based on a muggle kids story where a princess kisses a talking frog who turns into a prince. It doesn’t have a time lock, so don’t let it get kissed early.  And don’t let it get damaged, either, or the gift will be damaged, too.  Oh, and it’ll be a permanent transfiguration if you let it sit for more than six months.”
“So, if I march in the shop at about eleven, I am likely to be seen by the Weasel? You said they meet at the bar at about five thirty?” Harry nodded. “If I suggest I meet you after your shift, maybe at six, and  you claim you have something you need to do, so I can bring you back here as if for a date. We can get to the pub before them, since you closed the shop at five the last few years, anyway, and we can hide before they arrive.”
“Have to give him serious ones sometimes, though I’ll use the spelled paper of yours, not the frog, he refused to kiss it last year and I ended up getting Fred to de-frog it for me. You said the paper was kid-safe, right?”
“A Miniature Troll’s Leg Quill Holder, and look he’s included the receipt. That is quite a departure from his normal standards. Are you going to take it back to the shop, Darling?”
“Theo and Blaise have been close friends since before Hogwarts, though I still don’t know why either of them would pass it on to me, especially as Blaise claimed that he had run out of wrapping paper and that was why it was wrapped with paper from here.”
“What the fuck, Blaise?” Draco stared down at the parcel he had just been given. It was wrapped in the gaudiest wrapping paper you could imagine, which was less surprising when you noticed the three golden W’s floating in and out of the pattern.
“Hi, Love. I’m back. I’m sorry that it took so long for me to finish, but there could have been dangerous consequences if I didn't..” Harry had walked into the living room as he was speaking but stopped abruptly when he saw Draco’s expression. “Love, what’s wrong?”
“Food first, darling,” his mother told him, and then signalled to their house elf for the food. It was a fairly simple breakfast, and they all finished in little time. Once they had all finished he stood and brought the pile of gifts along the table. He passed his gifts to his parents. He had found a necklace he was sure his mother would love, and a rare book on breeding the various magical horse breeds for his father. He picked up the parcel for Harry and passed it to him before opening his own. As he unwrapped it he was overwhelmed by what his parents had given him, while he had his trust vault he had not expected to be given a key to the main family vault until he was married at the earliest.
“I wonder all the time what might have happened if I had accepted your hand all the way back on the train in first year.” Harry continued. “But I also don’t regret not taking it, as I don't know if we would have what we have now.” Harry turned back to his mother, “I don’t pity your son, Narcissa. I love him despite and maybe even because of all that has happened between us. And, Mr Malfoy,” Harry turned towards the doorway his father now occupied, “I don’t hold any of your actions against Draco either, he’s his own person and while I do believe that family is important, I don't think that the mistakes or crimes of one person should be held against their loved ones.”
“I’m also a little tired, while I do enjoy working on night shifts they are more tiring than an equivalent day shift. Once I’ve finished the next run of nights I think I need to take some time off before I push myself too hard. Shall we eat, or should we start with exchanging gifts?” Draco felt nervous about what gifts Harry had bought for his parents, almost as nervous as he was about his own gifts for later in the day.
"Of course, Love, but would you be willing to wait for the explanation until we return home tomorrow evening, the Weasleys don't know he is being pardoned yet and I don't want to cause an argument over Christmas."
“I heard from Andy that he wears it each time he visits little Teddy. It was just a matter of finding something he could find no excuse for keeping and had no-one to pass onto.”
“That sounds very sneaky of you, Mr. Potter. When should I show up at the shop to guarantee that I’m seen by one of them?”
“You know, what would really get them panicked is if you kept the tie. I mean, as far as they know, you never returned the Troll’s leg. And Teddy would love that tie. I’m sure you would become one of his favourite people if you wore it around him. Andy talks to Molly enough that I’m sure it would get back to Ron eventually, and then he’s sure to tell the rest of that quartet about it.”
After the shock of Harry's gift, the four wixen moved into the family sitting room and spent the remainder of the morning quietly talking, though his father said little. Eventually, it was time to floo to the Burrow. As they stood to leave his mother pulled Harry into a hug before giving Draco one.
As each person unwrapped their gifts there were shouts, and people jumping up to hug him. He started to get overwhelmed by all the redheads crowding him. He barely noticed when Harry stood up in front of him causing the group of exuberant thankers to step back. Harry led him up to the room they were sharing for the night and got him settled in bed.
The blush that stained Harry’s cheeks made strange things happen in Draco’s stomach. “You can meet me outside if you would like.”
“I think you do work far too much for them, and honestly they shouldn’t be relying on you so much. I was managing to stress myself out too easily. Logically, I know it should all go well and there isn’t really anything I can do now to change what happens, but I feel like I can face anything
"I can wait, though I am going to be dying of curiosity the entire time." They entered the green flames and stepped out into the busyness that was the Weasleys kitchen. It was even more crowded than it normally was due to the large amount of food that was being prepared.
"You're here, everyone is in the living room." Mrs Wealsy greeted them with warm, strong hugs. She then hurried them into the next room where they were greeted by a chorus of hellos as the various groups of people in the room noticed their arrival. They were the last to arrive and not long after they had sat down beside George, the entire group was called into the kitchen for the large Christmas dinner that Mrs Weasley had prepared. He found himself sat between George and Bill with Harry opposite him. He was glad to be sat with the quieter of the Weasley siblings, and those who he had less history with. He tried to keep his contributions to the conversation fairly simple and respectful as much for his own nerves as any worry about causing a fight. If he was honest with himself, which he tried to be, it was mostly out of nerves. He found the meal overly rowdy, with everyone grabbing food off various plates and serving dishes being passed up and down the table, he found it very different to the meal they had with his parents earlier that day.
"Dude, it was Draco's decision to terminate the courtship. She'd be upset had it been you to do so, or if you had tried to sabotage it in some way. She's not blind, either, she definitely knows the likelihood of Cassie meddling is one-hundred percent certain."
"You are not going after her! I will be able to check on her," Snape spat, "She will never forgive me if you get hurt!"
The motionless moon water rippled with a sudden vitality, pulsating as it morphed to the inky black of a startled squid. One object breached the surface with a bob, riding the minuscule waves for a brief moment before being joined by a twin object, until the pool finally stilled once more. It was only then that the objects could be identified, two sleek feathers that couldn't be more than two inches in length.
Narcissa brushed imaginary dust off of Draco's shoulders one last time. "Promise me you'll be careful-"
Andrew's hands were digging at the gills on his neck, and Draco realized they were bleeding. Cassie's hands quickly covered her mate's, frantically muttering any healing spell she could think of. It didn't appear to have any impact as Andrew kept choking, a horrid sound of agony.
Lucius looked towards the floor, shaking his head slowly like he couldn't believe what he was about to say. Looked up to look dead at Severus.
The eldest siren rolled his eyes, turning back to the cauldron just off to the side of him. The potion was almost ready for the dragon's tongue to be added.
Even worse was what Snape shared at the last meeting before term started. Harry had barely been allowed in on that meeting, his attendance being sporadic to begin with. Molly kept pushing for him to be kept out of the loop, but with Sirius as his legal guardian, the latter had more say in what Harry could or couldn't do.
The professor was cut off by Harry somehow managing to choke on his own saliva after hearing the phrase 'bodily fluids.' He'd rather just combust on the spot, thank you very much.
Cassie smiled, although it didn't reach her eyes. "It's what She wants. I don't really have a say in the matter, you know as much."
Draco shrugged, adding, "That was still better than that debate we had over landing face-first into a pile of shit versus a puddle of stinky urine."
The two had the apartment all to themselves. While Draco knew this was intentional, a small part of him wished he could've sat with his friends. Things were different now. He was different now.
"We told Severus, did we not? He has confided in Dumbledore for longer than either of our lives, and if there's something off about one of the professors in
Andy scoffed, "Probably your weird psychic bond from the reflecting pool water--which we still don't know the full consequences of--or your weird psychic bond from your birthright prophecy; Take your pick."
Snape turned, robes whipping with the curt motion, and he marched away to avoid further questioning. Harry's heart was attempting to barrel its way out of his chest with how hard it was beating. What Snape suggested... It changed everything. He didn't even try to deter Harry from his investigation, and his admitted defeat was as good as proof!
"Well." Cassie leaned back against the sofa arm, looking upward to the ceiling to really amp her theatrics. "Millicent Bulstrode
"This is one of the worst ideas that has ever been concocted in all of history, magical or not," Draco said. None of the Oracles or Elder Nightingales present replied to the statement, but Draco knew he was right. He was rarely wrong when it came to matters like this.
"Two Nightingales are directly involved in Voldemort's downfall," Aegeus reminded them for the millionth time, "it's imperative they be accessible to those seeking to defeat him."
He nodded, curt and quick, and Cassie yanked him by his arm to stop, keeping him in a death grip so he couldn't escape. He refused to meet her eyes.
Lupin never thought he would be in a position of such gratitude to the other man. He had successfully drawn the attention off of Lupin, for nothing if not the most basic of sympathies. Like the salivating dog that she was, Umbridge bit into the bone dangling in front of her.
Severus, for whatever reason, looked ready to smack Harry upside the head. Draco had an inkling he would feel similarly in a few moments.
There, neither him nor Cassie would have to be in any danger. Prophecy be damned. Whenever he thought of that blasted thing...
The attacks on muggleborns had amplified throughout the UK. The death eaters were becoming a force to be reckoned with, and Dumbledore had confided in Harry that he found it likely they'd be taking the Ministry soon, especially considering the haunting visions he'd been having at night. Mr. Weasley's screams still echoed in his ears.
Draco stood up in a heartbeat and Snape didn't even flinch as Draco rushed out, "Sorry, but I need to go talk to Harry."
He almost felt a tad jealous that he hadn't been the one to kill her. But he didn't have the same flame of vengeance buried inside him like his cousin did. He couldn't have made her death quite as agonizing or drawn-out.
Harry let the cloak drop from his shoulders, scanning the room in deep focus. Draco winced, either in sympathy or in shared pain, as Harry pinpointed the horcrux among them.
Andrew looked like he was going to have an aneurysm. Perhaps he was already beginning to have one, given the never-ending circle this conversation had been following for the past twenty minutes.
They must have had a silent conversation with their eyes that Draco could not participate in from the floor. Cassie had scrambled to find a piece of parchment and a quill, the scratching of the two together emphasizing the hurry she was in. He could hear the parchment crinkle as it was forced into Severus' hands, followed by the slamming of the entry door to their quarters.
While she had scales covering her entire body neck-down, he only had patches here and there, as well as from his lower torso to the tops of his thighs. He had webbed hands and feet, she had a gorgeous six-foot long tail. He despised how long of a process his presentation was, just wanting it to be over with so he'd stop looking so ridiculous. He felt ridiculous.
For her sake, he wished he could take her there once the war was over with. The cold would weaken him, could even kill him, and she'd never entertain the idea no matter the circumstances.
"Who even comes up with these ideas? How are we supposed to spectate an event that's deep underwater?"
He sat up. Draco tried to turn and run, but Andrew grabbed the hood of his robes and yanked him back. Flinging an arm around Draco's shoulders, he practically dragged the Slytherin over to Harry. They both stopped at his feet.
Draco pulled his knees even tighter against his chest. He shouldn't have asked, even though it would've all come out eventually.
Cassie turned, a bit of the dark ire still lingering in her eyes. "Of course not, wouldn't want to draw any attention to ourselves. However, in the future if she does write an article about you, even if it's about your engagement or some new position you've taken up, well..."
"There's no need to be nervous! You should be excited!" Andrew waved his hands around to express the grandiosity of it all. Blasted optimists and their distorted view of life-defining events.
In all honesty, not even Draco was aware of the answer to that. Why had he done that? He may as well have undone the cloaking spell at that point, since he was apparently hellbent on exposing himself after all.
The harsh sound forced Harry to turn back to him, not expecting the bared fangs and coal-black eyes mere inches from his face. All the knowledge he knew about Nightingale sirens suddenly evaporated from his memory. Draco's hand was still tangled in his hair, the grip tightening as he sized up Harry's friends.
"Potter." Andrew stood from the couch, crossing the floor. Draco was trembling again, yet this time it was in excitement. He'd seen Cassie use her Song, but not Andrew. As a Hellfire siren, his call would be different, warm unlike the chilling tone of a Nightingale, fiery and-
"When my first set of gills appeared along my neck, I don't remember it being this drawn-out of a process," Draco whined.
Draco's glassy stare fixated at a point on the wall, his choppy breathing growing quiet as he matched Cassie's note. The buzzing in Harry's chest intensified as the two Nightingales fell in sync, and he had to lean against the bed nearest for support so he didn't crash to the ground.
The room fell silent as Dumbledore entered, walking with purpose to the front of the Hall. The look on his face was eerie, one Harry had rarely seen present on the Headmaster. As the man took to the podium, everyone was on the edge of their seats to hear what had to be said.
Umbridge blabbed on about classwork and whatnot, and Draco zoned out to stare out into the lake. If all his classwork was to be done in here, then he was never going to get anything done. They would have been better off facing the desks away from the windows.
They followed down the hall to Snape's office and only then did Harry feel a spark of fear. He had accused the man's daughter of being a loyalist to Voldemort this morning just as he was, and he had an inkling that it wouldn't bode well with the professor. At the same time, it was confusing as to why Andrew and Draco had been conspiring with him seemingly all day, especially if he wasn't to be trusted. Perhaps they were doing it for Andrew's sake?
Anger. That was something he understood. Knew what to look for, the little telltale signs that someone was in a bad mood. The tense way that they carried their shoulders. How they distributed the weight in their feet to announce their entrance into a room, just to draw attention to themselves. The way their eyebrows would pinch ever so slightly to begin with, furrowing as they let it bubble up from underneath the surface. The way their voices snapped from terse to yelling, the whole house reverberating with the echo of it. At that point, there was no escape.
Potter seemed unfazed at his silence. "How've you been? I, uh, had a question I needed to ask you..."
Draco immediately thought of his father. He certainly disliked the Boy Who Lived, but was it enough to support a ploy to bring about his death? Was Moody the only one involved? And wasn't he an Auror? Certainly not a follower of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
Ron sighed, pulling out the empty chair next to him and patting it. Harry obliged, slumping down into the chair.
He barely focused through first period, mind occupied with figuring out the second task and why Malfoy and his strange cousin would want him apart of the Tournament. It was known to have been quite deadly in the past, but they had no way of ensuring one of the tasks would do him in for good. Maybe they just wanted to watch him make a fool of himself?
Cassie patted his back reassuringly. "Don't worry, She would never let that happen. We must always have a just reason for using our Song. It's for protection, not for abuse. Besides, if a siren were to truly grow out of control, once a siren dies so does the influence of their Song."
Hermione had pressed on the spine of the book he was holding, forcing it down and away from his face. He never thought she'd interfere in him trying to research, for Merlin's sake.
Potter was whiter than the Bloody Baron. Dumbledore still had that bloody twinkle in his eye, no doubt having sat back knowing he'd barely have to lift a finger to get the point across.
As they reentered the pool and breached the surface, Draco could sense a presence before coming up. Expecting his godfather, he almost shrieked when it was anyone but.
"Harry's core is gold though, we know that from the mating scale. That's not exactly an impure color. What if this is a side effect from you losers deciding to use my weird psychic bond as a reverse Portkey to Cassie?"
Severus didn't look any less infuriated. "Something attacked a grindylow that was after him, and then Gabrielle Delacour was mysteriously freed right in front of Potter's eyes! You may have been cloaked, but your blatant disregard for your safety was on display for all to see!
Draco snarled but otherwise stilled in his movements. Harry rubbed his thumb in circles over the sharp lines of his cheekbone, waiting patiently as his boyfriend's heavy panting slowed to calmer breathing. Behind him, Dumbledore was yelling at Harry, yelling at sirens who were blocking his way.
Potter made a grunt of confusion yet still obliged and followed. At first, Draco wasn't certain where he was even going, but he was not running about aimlessly. She was guiding him, She would led him to safety.
Andrew, face dripping with blood from deep scratches on his forehead, flashed a grateful smile at Harry. Draco let a out a noise not dissimilar to a roar, fangs snapping mere inches from Harry's face.
Malfoy then rushed to her side, pulling on her arm and pleading with her to stand down. Moody looked furious now, ready to try again, when McGonagall rushed in and pointed her own wand at her colleague.
Andrew answered, already attuned to the nature of their conversation. "Narcissa will come to scopuli, under the guise of spending time in France to grieve the loss of her child. I don't know about your father, but he doesn't exactly enjoy fraternizing with magical beasts."
He pointedly ignored the stares and whispers as they entered the Great Hall in a tight formation. Many were about there being actual sirens in the castle, but quickly the chatter evolved as they made it to their table.
He received no reply, but didn't anticipate one at first. He wondered if it was exclusive to sirens, or if Harry could love him enough to find forgiveness as well. Guess it was too late to find out now.
Cassie, if she was uncomfortable, hid it well. She took notes and paid attention, nodded her head at key points to make it look like she was attentive to the lecture. Draco tried to keep up as well, fall into the same pattern. But with the scratchiness of his back, the blood that was definitely seeping into his white dress shirt, and Moody's swirling eyeball that always found a way back to him, it was too much.
There was no greater relief than knowing that Andrew's rage wasn't directed at you. He couldn't remember how the saying went, something about 'not wanting to be on the receiving end of hellfire' or something of that nature.
"I'll be okay, Draco, you don't need to worry about me. There are other fish in the sea." Corey waggled his eyebrows at the line, and Draco rubbed his temples in exasperation. "Besides, I was beginning to sense your heart wasn't in it. I was waited until you were ready to confront yourself first."
Corey pressed a kiss to the top of his head. "Get some sleep, only a few more hours until we leave for Hogwarts."
He bowed his head awkwardly at the mention of his name. Cassiopeia was thin like both him and his mother, yet loomed over them with an impressive height. She must have been at least 180 centimetres.
"Oh, that's cool. Right, well, I can talk to Draco later, sorry for disrupting your lunch." He left faster than he came, form retreating into a sea of black robes. The meal resumed around him as he stared at the spot where Harry had disappeared into.
Cassie wrapped her arms around him. "But you don't love him, right? You know sirens only fall in love once, and I need you to tell me now if you do, it'll change everything-"
Draco stepped over her body with a huff, ready to regroup and move on. Where the hell were the others? Cassie was just ahead of him, using her Song to force information out of a Snatcher, had been doing so for the last three and a half minutes. The others should have been here a minute and forty seconds ago.
"We haven't really discussed it, but in September, a Moonbeam siren was found dead in France. He was found by our kind, so it was kept secret from the wizarding world, but..." Cass stared at her feet, making it impossible to read her expression. "He was... When they found him, his tail had been skinned. Someone wanted his scales, probably for a vitality potion or who fucking knows what..."
"Corey will understand. Not all courtships lead to fruition. The whole point of them is to discover what you're looking for in a mate. But you need to talk to him, right away. He doesn't love you yet. You can't let it get that far."
Cassie had beat him to the punch. Run off to serve Voldemort because she knew he would die trying to protect her from him. He shouldn't have warned her. Shouldn't have tipped her off to what he was planning to do.
by his parents. A bit further down a more recent one, of Cassie and him dancing at the Yule Ball. The article itself was uneventful, as his 'illness' wasn't new to anyone. The only sentence of interest to him was the speculation that "Lord Malfoy is to name Lady Cassiopeia Prince the new Heir, potentially through post-humorous marriage."
There was a wide berth of silence, followed by a question spoken so softly it could've been mistaken for a flutter of feathers, like a pin dropping.
He shouldn't have felt this hurt, he had never told either of them about his crush. Realistically, it was a long-shot to begin with. Andrew was two years older and had known Cassie for years (not to mention also being a year closer to her in age), and had barely gotten to know Draco over the course of a couple months.
Harry really wished he was better at following these types of conversations. He wished Hermione were here to connect the dots for him.
There was a toad-like woman dressed in all pink stood at the common room entrance that watched them like a hawk as they took their seats. His instincts screamed that she couldn't be trusted. Her frilly pink exterior was doing her no favors either.
Sitting down and picking a piece of toast to nibble on to qualm his anxieties, Draco leaned into Andrew's side. His energy was similar enough to Cassie's that he could almost pretend it was her.
Draco spent the majority of his days at Sirenum Scopuli learning to brew siren-specific potions from Andrew. It was very different from how he was used to brewing in that the ingredients seemed to be outrageously specific at times.
Of course Cassie had inherited her father's flair for the dramatic. Draco couldn't be so lucky as to be spared from the theatrics that were going to go down once seated in Dumbledore's office.
Snape shoved Harry again, forcing him to tumble and crash into Draco's solid form. His arms had reached out to catch himself, but all he could focus on was the slick scales that had found themselves under his hands. From the few times he had felt a fish--courtesy of Vernon dragging him along on one fishing trip to carry the bait and equipment before deciding him too much a nuisance to ever bring him along again--he had come to the understanding that despite the scales their flesh was soft. Likewise, he had assumed that sirens' had a similar give, not dissimilar to when you pressed your fingertips into another person's palm: sturdy yet pliant, yielding but durable.
"Ron, did you see Malfoy?" he hissed, hoping the Patil sisters couldn't hear him (they could, they just really didn't care).
I made a storyboard if anyone is interested :) included some visuals for both Andrew & Cassie for how I see them both in my head
"Boys and girls must stay six inches apart," she tutted. Draco looked up in time to see the flick of her wand that yanked Andrew and Cassie's chairs apart.
The four bodies were taken straight to the sea, but Draco wasn't there to witness it. He had been sat on the couch in the sitting room as Andrew spoke to Jess and Corey in a hushed voice. Tea had been shoved into his hands, and he drank it obligingly, like it was the only action his limbs were capable of executing at the moment.
Cassie moved her long legs and patted the now empty spot on the couch. He obliged, sitting with his legs tucked against his chest for comfort.
He also loved learning about the others. Corey was a Sea Devil, all dark reds with streaks of black on his caudal and dorsal fins. Jessie was a Moonbeam, a beautiful pattern of navy and violet swirled across her whole tail, her caudal fins deep purple and royal blue that reminded him of an aurora. And Andrew, well.
Cassie must have finished her work around a similar time as him. She always did struggle to sit still for very long, and the endless bouncing of her leg was driving him insane as the vibrations shook the table. He exhaled sharply to convey his displeasure, and Andrew came to the rescue. From the corner of his eye Draco watched Andrew hook his ankle around Cassie's, ceasing the tapping and drawing her attention away to something other than boredom. Draco could almost
Andrew pulled his claws from where they were still lodged into Draco's shoulder, fingers curling around his palm as he cradled it to his chest. Draco barely even winced from the movement, eyes still dazed as they searched Harry's face for answers.
Draco would most certainly be recounting this tale to Hermione once all was said and done, just so she could properly lecture Ronald on 1) paying attention during class, 2) being knowledgeable on all things siren, 3) how goblins sold out hundreds of sirens they had promised to give sanctum to.
cabin. Something that became increasingly evident as they crossed over the threshold, the normalcy of the inside suffocating.
"Here, boy." He held it out for Draco, who sat up only because of the promised relief in front of him. He took it without having to exercise any cognitive function, at this point used to taking potions by rote.
While he could see the resemblance, her appearance was highly suspicious. Hogwarts hadn't ever had exchange students in the past--he'd checked--especially not ones from Ilvermorny. He hadn't even heard of the school (granted, he wasn't very familiar with any magical schools other than Hogwarts before this year), and for them to send an exchange student but not participate in the Triwizard Tournament? Or even send more than just the one student?
Aegeus ignored him almost entirely. "Sirens are natural-born killers. We were not make to roll over and expose our bellies, we were designed to protect ourselves from threats! We are the legacy of prey turned predator. They have a duty to their kind to fulfill the prophecy, lest we become prey once more."
Cass closed her eyes at the condescending remark. "Which part of my language, may I ask? I do hope I haven't said anything
The taste of blood from where Draco's fangs cut his lips was nondescript to the relief that flooded through his entire being. Draco was possessive in his methods as Harry melted like putty into his hands, more than fine to relent control.
"Cass!" he cried, bringing a hand to his forehead and finding something wet. Pulling his hand back--despite the doubled vision--the blood it was now soaked in was unmistakable.
Cassie grinned like the maniac that she was, and Draco shoved her, starting a wrestling match that left them both breathlessly cackling like hyenas laid out on the sandy beach. He didn't even care that he was going to have sand coming out of his hair and ears for the next few days because of this. For once, he didn't have to be afraid to be himself, and he'd never felt freer.
"Whatever you decide, you know I'll support you," Severus whispered to him, "but you need to decide now. You'll need to leave soon if you're to get back to the Islands, before
Draco's supposed grandfather stepped forward. As an Elder Nightingale--at least, one of the very few that resided on the Islands--he had been called forth as a governing body in the war planning. Draco was simply glad there were individuals here with more authority than the bloody Oracles and their prophetic bullshit.
Cassie made a gagging noise, pretending to vomit all over the table. "I'd rather impale myself on a Victorian fence than have that image forced into my thoughts one more time."
"My cousin was just taking me to the hospital wing," Cassie replied, already well-informed on who they were dealing with.
Cassie wrapped up her last sentence, and then leveled with him. "Draco. I love you dearly, but sometimes I really do question whether there is anything occupying that thick skull of yours. Now, please shut up, or I might just bash your head in to prove my point."
"Wait, weren't you already planning on going with Zabini? You asked him a few weeks ago, did you not?"
He did his best to find his footing and support as much as himself as he could, but she was moving too fast for him. It was better for the both of them if he let himself be pseudo-dragged out of here. For one, it was faster than him trying to play catch-up. Two, Cassie was an impatient bastard who didn't care if he wanted to attempt to save the last shred of his dignity.
The shadow people were gone, but they had left behind an accomplice. This shadow was different than them. Like a cobra, its color a violent red; the red you see in a lightning storm, that dramatic flash right before lightning strikes, the red you see when you squeeze your eyes so tight you see stars.
By the door was a tall one that sounded like tiny cymbals clinking around with each dart to-and-fro. The window, the shortest, rumbled like a tiger ready to leap and devour its prey. They were fast, unstoppable, even as Draco tripped over himself in his pursuit of them. He was spinning and spinning and spinning until he collapsed into a heap.
"Mr. Potter," Dumbledore grumbled with enough fury to part the Red Sea. He would've felt more intimidated if it weren't for the way Draco's attention snapped to just over his shoulder to release a low snarl that rumbled through his bones.
Her prejudice for werewolves? Sure, whatever, he could look past that. Her prejudice for who he had chosen as his husband?
He caught Snape glaring at Andrew in his periphery, unsure if it was regarding the unsolicited commentary or the choice of nickname.
Cassie rolled her eyes like this was old news. "Again, not that impressive, any siren could've done it. Dumbledore now thinks of me as an exchange student that he does not care about what I get up to, and Moody believes I'm much too advanced for anything his class has to offer, and understands how important it is for me to support my cousin this year. Piece. Of. Cake."
Severus shifted from one foot to another, before making his way over to sit next to Draco on the sofa, staring straight ahead at the wall instead of meeting Draco's eyes. "I would never do anything to endanger your life, Draco. The Third Task will be a labyrinth, with various obstacles installed by other professors. The walls of the maze are enchanted, and will make way for any magical creature attempting to navigate it. Along with some other enchantments, and you would be protected from the eyes of the champions, not even the Minister would know of your involvement.
Draco leaned away from the warmth of Cassie's side to meet her eyes square on. "Is there anything you all want to share with the class?!"
The same merperson shook their head in disdain. Likely the leader, then. "I will have to make up a lie for the judges to explain what has happened, if the boy has not blabbered to them already."
“Blaise gave it to me for Christmas, which is honestly very strange as he usually gives particularly useful gifts.”
“You should act like you’re surprised to see me there. We don’t want to make them suspicious, after all.”
“Should we tell them we know what they did?” asked the blond man, sitting in a booth hidden from the group.
“Yes, yes, you told us so. But, admittedly, we did try to give it to him last year as well, but Ron, you did insist on the frog.”
“Let me guess. Blaise gave you a tie that looked black but became overly vibrant when you were around other people and then reverted to black when you took it off?” Harry said wryly.
“Yeah, that’s fine. Twelfth of September, right? These will only work if you wrap it before the next time the date comes around, and they can't be reused. Well, they can, but they won’t be peek-proof at that point. We have house colours, pink, purple, blue, green and rainbow patterns, as well as the Christmas paper.”
Draco quietly crept down the tree and climbed onto Harry's lap, who didn't even seem to notice, he just continued to talk. “And I know that nights are an important part of your job, that your hours can be just as unpredictable as mine or even more so sometimes, but it hurt when you volunteered to take another set of nights right after Christmas, especially as you only finished a set a few days ago. I know I wasn't meant to be working today, I don't know why they think this project needs me so badly and if I had known you were so nervous about the next few days I would have told them: ‘No I'm meant to have the day off, I've been working sixteen-hour days for the last week and a half, and I'm needed at home. I really don't want to lose you, I love you Dra- umph” he cut off Harry's rambling by changing out if his Animagus and kissing him.
“I want to see whatever you want to show me I think this is honestly the happiest I’ve been since the war.
He felt harry gently shake his shoulder bringing him out of his dozing. They arranged for his parents to visit them in the next few weeks so they could finally see their house, as neither had been allowed to visit when they moved in. Once they had finished with the goodbyes they returned to the Floo parlour and went through the fireplace to their home. Harry helped him get settled in bed for the second night in a row but he felt much more settled in himself and their relationship, as he drifted off to sleep, than he had even a day before.
“Yeah. They can.” Harry dropped the fake voice, “as long as they bring it back within a month and it’s undamaged they’ll get a refund. Who is your new partner, anyway?”
“You know I love you, and I do love you more than I love my job. I’m sorry that I’ve been so distant with you this last week. There has been this big project happening and it’s been all hands on deck, everyone has been called in for as many hours as they can possibly do. And I know it’s not an excuse, but every time I would try to leave early to come and see you before you left for a shift, I would be pulled away into some complex bit of the project that ‘absolutely needed my help right that minute’. Even though I just missed you, and I had been looking forward to spending the day just you and me.”
“You’re not wrong. I definitely want my own children someday. I want an actual family of my own, especially since I don’t want my only family to be the relatives that hate me. I know I have my friends but they’re all starting their own families now. We’re not as close as we were. Hell, I’m closer to the Twins and Bill now than I am to Ron. Sometimes, I feel like I wouldn’t have been friends with Ron and Hermione if it wasn’t for all the mad stuff that happened at Hogwarts.”
A distinctive box was set on the counter in front of him along with a receipt; the mini Troll’s leg that he had sold to Ron a few weeks prior. Looking back at it, he was definitely not going to let the Twins make any more of them. Harry glanced up at the person on the other side of the counter,  surprised to see the blond hair that belonged solely to the Malfoy family.
“I have to admit, unless your brother’s managed to think of something particularly spectacular for next year I don’t actually know what we could have given him.” The four laughed and finished their drinks before leaving
Harry quickly put his hand over Draco’s mouth. “Yes, I know it was our idea, really,” he hissed into his partner’s ear, “But you did overact just a little bit, my Love.”
Draco pulled Harry into a hug. “Friends grow apart, Darling. It happens to everyone. You spent almost every day with them for nine years, maybe those connections needed all that time to keep them strong. You haven’t stopped being friends now, it just takes a bit more effort than it did though school and when you were partnered with the Weasel as Aurors.” Harry felt Dreaco gently press his lips against Harry’s.
When they stepped out of the floo they were directed to one of the smaller family sitting rooms where they met his parents, once again. Shortly after they settled in the living room his father asked Harry if they could talk in his study.
“So, they will quite possibly try to give it to you again.” Harry pulled the blonde down so he could kiss him. “You know, I’m happy about their meddling. We wouldn’t have gotten together without it. But they still could have talked to us.”
“I’m not sure it was the Twins, or at least not directly.” He frowned at the letter that had been inside the envelope. “It seems that Harry and Malfoy got together and they decided that the matchmaking I’d been trying to do with Nev, Theo and Blaise, was annoying, so they snuck around and pretended they hadn’t seen each other since Hogwarts. This is them telling me they know what we were doing and inviting us to their wedding. To be held on their 5th anniversary this Boxing Day.”
“I wonder what they’re gonna get for next year’s gift. That may affect what we do.” Draco rolled over so he was leaning over Harry.
“Which is why the ashtray worked. No-one Draco knows smokes and it was just annoying enough that he wouldn’t want to try and keep it.”
“All spells used on the paper won’t do more than surprise a kid who tries to peek, and none of them will become unstable if exposed to accidental magic. Rosie starting to try and peek at presents?”
“Ron tends to hang around the shop from opening at nine until about one. Neville turns up at two and stays until four. As for the other two, they never come into the shop but since they don’t seem to have twigged that you’ve come to the shop twice already, I’m assuming that they don’t hang around the alley long after four. If they show up at all.”
Harry blushed and grinned. “You’ve made me very happy as well. Thinking about the conspiring quartet; how much longer do you want to drag out their suspense? I was thinking we time you bringing in whatever they get you so at least one of them sees the two of us talking, maybe even one of them hears you asking me back here after I finish work. I don’t want to keep us a secret from everyone for more than another year or so.”
Harry grabbed the correct paper and quickly wrapped the miniature troll’s foot, trying to ignore the memories it brought up. He put on his best customer service voice, trying to imitate the shop assistants he had seen the few times his aunt had dragged him out to carry her bags while she pampered herself.
He kept hold of the tie and wore it each time he visited his cousin Teddy. The three year old enjoyed attempting to match the colour of his hair to the colour of the tie.
Draco had decided to open Blaise’s present in his flat before he visited his parents, just in case it was as strange as the previous year’s had been. He was pleasantly surprised to find a plain black tie. Since he hadn’t decided on a tie yet he quickly looped it around his neck. Checking he had everything he Floo’d to the manor.
“I was the one to inherit the majority of the Black Vaults. Sirius had ritually adopted me, which meant I was the next in the main line. One of the smaller vaults has actually passed to my godson through his mother. When I was trying to figure out what to give you I started to sort through the main family vaults, the set wasn’t labelled as yours or as being meant for you at all, which is quite possibly how it failed to become part of your dowry. When I saw what was in the box, I immediately thought of you, and I felt that they should be in the hands of someone who truly cared about them. Honestly, there are enough other pieces of jewellery in the Black Vaults and the Potter Vaults that I would not miss one set, especially one that looked personalised if I ever had a daughter.” he paused, “Mr Malfoy, I should possibly warn you that your gift is not entirely from myself, and in some ways is similar to your own gift to Draco. If you want, I can explain how I can give you what I am now or at another time if it would suit you better. I feel I should say it did not take as much work as I expected it to, and it is on record that I am giving this to you today.”
He sighed.“It was a gift from Blaise. In the box, it appeared to be a plain black tie. I do not know why he insists on giving me these ridiculous gifts, considering he has included the receipts with I’m assuming he knows I will hate them.” he unknotted the tie and the colours faded back to the black he had seen in the box. “I do have to admit some of the spell work is impressive, especially for Weasleys.”
As they walked through the manor to the floo parlour he turned to Harry, "even if you don't give an explanation for your gift to my father, I would like to know how you secured the pardon and why you were allowed to be the one to give it to him."
“I want to take you to the cinema and the theatre. You’d probably enjoy opera, and I’d sit through exactly one for you.  Any more than that, and you’d have to be very convincing about it.”
"Draco," his mother called to him after he had passed in front of her for the tenth time, "if you are so nervous that you cannot focus on anything else why don't you change into your Animagus and go to sleep in my lap until they return. I am sure your father will not do anything to hurt Harry, especially after his gift yesterday. He is most likely just doing his duty as your father and affirming Harry's intentions towards you."
The next morning he was awake earlier than he had expected. He woke Harry and once they were ready the pair went down to the kitchen. They quietly made themselves some tea and toast, and just sat in the kitchen enjoying spending the calm early morning together.
“I think I know what’s going on with our friends.” Harry felt a shiver go down his spine at the grin on Malfoy’s face. “Why don’t you process this refund, and then close up the shop early and we can discuss it, and how we can get back at them.”
“I wouldn’t miss your mum’s Christmas lunch, even if it’s still a bit awkward between me and Ginny.”
“Coins,” he said without thinking, “You know, this is the fourth Yule Blaise has given me something from here and included a receipt with it.”
“That is very strange, considering I know that there has only been one of those horrible quill holder’s sold to Ron. He told me he was going to give it to his Auror partner, Theo Nott.”
“How did you get Aunt Andy to not mention that you visit with me most of the time?” Draco quietly asked him.
Eventually, the door opened and the pair returned to the room. They walked in and Draco could hear them talking about the difference between two words when said in parseltongue and how some words didn't have a direct translation, touching on how this could affect casting spells using parseltongue. He was surprised, he knew it took a lot of effort to get his father interested in Magical Theory. It wasn't that he didn't know about many obscure parts of it, he was just more interested in other things and didn't often talk about it.
“How did you find these? They had been meant to be part of my dowry but they couldn’t be found before our wedding, I had always hoped that I might have been able to search for them if Draco inherited the Black Vaults, but when they passed to someone else I assumed I would never see them again.” Narcissa carefully pulled a delicate silver Narcissus flower on a very fine chain out of its velvet case and fastened it around her neck, leaving the rest of the set in its box for the moment.
“You just settle down here, Love, I’m just going to go downstairs, say goodnight and then I’ll be right back.” He was barely aware that harry left the room before he had fallen asleep, exhausted from the stress of the busy day.
“You’re buying that tie? Really Neville? For the love of Merlin, who are you planning on giving it to? And are you ready for what they’ll do to you when they realise that it’s not actually black?” Harry looked at the plain packaging that ‘The Worst Tie You Could Possibly Imagine’ came with and wondered who Neville even knew that wore ties.
Draco groaned. “I had forgotten about that, Blaise gave it to me before Yule. I don’t know why he used Weasley paper on it, apparently it was spelled so I couldn’t open it before today.” He carefully unwrapped the colorful box, which matched the wrapping paper.
It had a silver rim and base, and appeared to be a dish of some sort. Looking back at the box, he saw two pieces of parchment sat in the bottom. One was the customary receipt he was coming to expect from Blaise’s gifts and the other was written in the standard Wheezes font. ‘The Always Ready Floating Ashtray’ the leaflet proudly proclaimed. Draco removed the receipt and carefully coaxed the tray back into its box before promptly putting the lid back on and tying a ribbon aboud it to keep it closed.
“Why are you buying a miniature version of the umbrella stand from Grimmauld Place, Ron? I don’t even understand why the Twins even thought it was a good product to make. That’s the first one that’s been sold since they created them.”
“I know it seems quick, but I do love your son. I don’t think I would have made it through that last year at Hogwarts, after the war, without him being there.” Harry looked away from Narcissa, gazing at Draco fondly, “you kept me sane through that year. Through the adoration, the hostility, and all the chaos that happened, in what I had honestly hoped would be a quiet year, you were there for me. I don't know why none of my previous years at the castle had been quiet, but when I felt like the people I had relied on for so many years were pulling away from me when I still needed them, you stood by me. You were this steady presence through so much, and I kinda wish we had stopped fighting sooner.”
“Well then Harry, feel free to call me Narcissa. I don’t think I ever thanked you for saving Draco’s life, and for speaking for us at the trials. I don’t know what would have happened to us if you hadn’t.”
“I happened to take some particularly excellent wine from the family cellars last time I was at the mansion. I’m sure you would welcome it after having to spend so much time in this mess of a store. We can catch up and maybe you will discover you enjoy my company after all.”
The quiet was interrupted by Mrs Weasley who was up to make breakfast for everyone before most returned to their own homes. Harry immediately stood and offered to help her with the cooking. He watched the pair work together almost seamlessly in the kitchen dancing around each other in the space to make enough food to feed all fourteen people. He enjoyed watching his partner move about the room and cook with skill and confidence, though it made him sad to think of how and why Harry knew how to do these things.
“None of them smoke, and unless one of the many Weasleys smokes, then none of them have use for it, so they will have to get rid of it somehow, assuming they de-frog it.”
to take an extra set right after Christmas. You knew when we started dating that my job took a lot of my time!” Draco saw Harry’s back stiffen as he talked.
“You know what I do, Love, and you know that I can't always control when I’m needed,” Harry said soothingly. His tone was calm and caring which only made Draco angrier.
Draco found it fascinating; the difference between Mrs Weasley’s mostly magical style of cooking and Harry’s use of many more muggle methods. He wondered whether his partner would have opened a restaurant or a bakery if he had not been recruited by the Unspeakables right after they took their NEWTs.
Draco had even braved the Muggle world to find a book that explained electricity in the simplest of terms for Mr Weasley and at the same time had bought a cookbook of various curries and other Indian dishes for his wife. He had bought a copy of a novel by his favourite French author for Fleur, as well as a book of French fairy tales for Victoire. Percy had received a collection of essays written by former ministers about their journey to gaining the office. Lee and Audrey had received slightly less personalised gifts but were both pleased by the selection of sweets he had chosen for them.
“Ok, you want this wrapped again? Is paper fine, or do you want to try the new Kiss-A-Frog wrapping? The gift will look like an animated frog until someone kisses it. If no-one is willing, the gifter can have it changed back for a small fee, or the recipient can do the same, but they won’t be charged.” Harry grinned at his best mate, he knew exactly which would be chosen, even if Ron didn’t realise he was so predictable.
Harry fingered the small box he had hidden in his pocket. He knew it could be seen as early but it felt like it was the right time to ask. He had assumed that Ron would ask him to help wrap the gift for Draco again, and had planned to hide the ring inside the box. Either way, it felt right to ask, as they were ending their friends’ attempts to get them together. It had been fun, but hiding their relationship had become exhausting.
“It’s for Hannah’s dad, he’s been being uncooperative about her wants and it’s not like he interacts with any muggles or anyone who could actually cause problems for me and Hannah. It should just embarrass him a bit.”
“That’s a little complicated. But, essentially, the Twins were the first to realise that working as an Auror was slowly killing me. After I quit, they told me they were happy to let me help them out with research and development, as long as I didn’t mind helping out in the shop when needed; summer, the run up to Christmas and today. Though I’m still not sure why they want to be open today. You’ve been my only customer so far.” Harry cast a quick tempus charm. “And considering the shop closes in about half an hour you are likely to be the only customer at all.”
“Sure, here are the two Galleons and three Sickles that that thing costs, I just need to tighten the wards and then we can Floo out from the office.” Harry offered his hand to Malfoy, who took it and allowed himself to be pulled behind Harry as he did his final checks before the pair Floo’d together to Malfoy’s flat.
“Fine, but I hope it’s better than last year’s Christmas gift. Seriously, my birthday gift was one of the best ones you’ve ever given me, but that Troll's leg, I was honestly expecting you to say it had been a joke and give me something else for weeks afterwards.”
“Are you really still playing into that Love?” Harry whispered to Draco, who only grinned in response.
He was pacing up and down in the living room of his house. Draco had been fine that morning; if slightly mad Harry was working that day when he had been meant to have the day off. He had been looking forward to spending the day with him relaxing before the packed schedule they had over the next few days. It didn’t help that they had barely seen each other over the week before. With Harry working long days and his run of night shifts, they only had about five minutes where they were home at the same time and awake.
“Ah, but you see, my darling Draco,” Blaise laid his arm around Draco’s shoulders, “They’ll charge me to cast the spell as the buyer of the Kiss-A-Frog, but you, the unwilling recipient, they won’t charge a single knut.”
“How did you know? I thought you said Weasley hadn’t bought anything that wasn’t obviously for his spawn this year.”
not interested anymore? I’m not the one who, having just come off of a set of night shifts, chose to
“There was a better gift, you just have to figure out how to get it.” He had a particularly smug look on his face and his grin only got wider as Draco glared at him.
“I love you too, you idiot. I’ve just spent the day stressing about all the things that could possibly go wrong at my parents and at the Weasleys. All I could think about was that I wanted you here. I’m sorry I hurt you by taking the extra run of nights, I hadn't thought about how it would affect you. I only took it as it gives me the opportunity to be running the emergency room for the night, I’ve not done that without supervision before and as soon as I was offered the chance, I took it without thinking.”
Draco had decided to wait until he was back home after visiting the manor to unwrap Blaise’s gift that year, after the incident with the tie, he did not want to risk something else that would only reveal its true nature once he was with others. He carefully opened the wrapping paper and saw a box, with the golden triple W insignia of the shop and the letters ARFA. Completely stumped by the labelling, Draco slowly removed the lid of the box, as soon as there was a gap between the two parts of the box a bright green thing quickly flew out and hovered at his elbow. It continued to stay by his elbow as he moved around his flat. Once he realised it would not move out of arm's reach, Draco carefully examined the object.
The next morning the pair were up early getting ready to Floo to Malfoy Manor, and spend Christmas morning with Draco’s parents. He was worried by how unworried Harry seemed. Once they had gathered the gifts they were taking with them, both for his parents and for the Weasleys, they quickly went through the Floo and arrived in the reception parlour of the manor. They were met by a house-elf and directed to the family dining room. At one end of the dining table there was a small pile of parcels, as they passed Harry and Draco added their presents for the elder Malfoy’s to the pile. He joined his mother at the table and Harry sat opposite him.
Harry carefully pulled away from Draco and picked the parcel up from where they had left it on the living room table. “This is definitely the paper I sold to Ron. I added a second W to each of the Christmas papers I gave him. It wasn’t obvious if you don’t look at it everyday, but it was enough that I would be able to tell if they used it to wrap your ‘gift’.” he looked back at his boyfriend, “Did I tell you I accidentally found the pub the four of them meet at? It was a coincidence, I was walking past the Leaky when I heard Ron and Theo mentioning meeting Blaise at a muggle pub nearby for lunch. So, I went there just after I finished work and talked to the bartender. He told me they tend to meet up there at about five thirty in the afternoon on Boxing Day, and he thought that they seemed to be trying to drown their sorrows while most people are still celebrating the holiday. I’m really tempted to go there once they know we’ve seen each other and hide in a booth and see how they react to the end of their scheming.”
He swam away in a panic. The longer he stayed there the risk of him doing something stupid once more increased. He sped through the water before the Merpeople's village was in sight. They would be able to smell him, even if they couldn't see him. Draco forced himself and his heart rate to slow down so they wouldn't mistake him for a threat.
The breath many were holding was released, pleased with the results of the prophecy. Evil was on the horizon, but hope followed in its shadow.
Aside from his soul being 'stupid' part, Draco was relieved at least one person was on his side. At least, that was how he would feel until he figured out what her angle was.
His godfather tried to chastise her for the behavior, despite the fact that once on steady feet he returned the hug tenfold. Draco let them have their moment, knowing how hard it had been for the two of them to be apart. He had to fight for owl privileges after all, with Cassie insisting on sending her daily letters before Draco's, leading to many wrestling matches that had to be broken up by Andrew.
"Your first summer with the pod," she answered with zero hesitation. "You remember when you first used your Song?"
The panic in Andrew's muffled voice on the other side of the door felt like a bucket of artic water being dumped onto his head. Straightening his rumpled clothes as best as he could, he threw the door open, fear sending hot sparks down his spine at the look on Andrew's face.
"I'm afraid that may not be an option in this case," Lucius cautioned, "I know with certainty that she is mated with another siren. Their bonds last even in death."
Draco stood so quickly that Harry got whiplash looking back to him and then turn again to watch as he stormed up to the teachers' table. The other sirens had decided now to fall silent, along with the rest of the students present, as it was obvious something significant was about to go down. Before Harry could stand to join Draco in support, the latter was already straight across from Snape and leaning over to whisper whatever accusation he had on the tip of his tongue.
It was then that he noticed that Snape looked paler than usual. Even Dumbledore lacked that ever-present twinkle in his eye, his shoulders slumped as he turned over a letter in his hands.
Draco fixed himself so he was knelt at Harry's side, clearing his throat to diffuse the tension. "Right. Potter."
He looked at the modest cabin surrounded by sea cliffs and towering pines and wondered how soon he could go back to the Malfoy estate. He already knew he'd have to leave behind his wand, but this was a
Cassie's talons had extended, their sharp ends dripping with blood glistening in the morning light. As Aegeus began wailing, clutching at his bleeding cheek and thrashing about on the floor, she made no move to retract the offensive weapons. She stood over her victim with a grim tightness to her face, pinched from the aftermath of her actions.
"A couple, yeah," Draco answered without hesitation, and this time Harry tumbled all the way down to the floor. It was only then that Draco came to the realization that Harry wouldn't understand.
Something still itched at the back of his mind. "Why tell McGonagall about Andrew being a siren at all? Doesn't that make me a more suspicious candidate to also being one?"
Merlin, the headache he could've saved himself by mating with another siren. Even when Cassie and Andrew bickered, at least they'd never have to worry about one of them betraying the other. Loving another.
"Narcissa thinks we should move them to the Islands until we figure out the underlying reasons for their... afflictions," Severus muttered. He likely thought Draco was asleep or he wouldn't have said anything while he was in the room.
They fell into a comfortable silence, alternating between watching the rolling scenery and stretching out on the long benches. He was glad to have spent the summer with her already and gotten to know his few-times-removed cousin, otherwise this would be quite awkward the whole way.
Andy sucked in a breath like he'd been punched in the gut. "Right. She's, well, she's not here right now, so I'll have to suffice until she gets back, okay?"
She shrugged. She had to've known this was the only direction this conversation would take. Why bother bringing the subject up, if not to ruffle Draco's proverbial feathers?
His friend's face was beginning to turn the color of his hair. "No, lately both you and Hermione have been ditching me to hang out with the sirens, and that's fine. But I'm your friend, too, and you can't just keep putting me on the backburner! Up until last year, you and Draco hated each other. For all we know, he could ditch you for You-Know-Who and go back to being your mortal enemy! Now, you promised me you'd do this for me, so you have to choose. Me or him."
"How are you certain this won't kill us?" he asked once more, needing to hear some type of reassurance.
"I'll kill him," Narcissa muttered to herself as she plotted how to kill the elder in the most achingly slow, excruciatingly painful way possible.
"She grew up in America, and attended Ilvermorny as a result. Although, last year she decided to transfer here, and you will quickly realize she's the most headstrong Slytherin in the house's history. Merlin knows I hold little authority over her."
He watched them in the Great Hall, how Slytherins of all years would walk up to talk to him, giving him books and sweets and whatnot. If he wasn't there, then Cassie was, and he didn't like her very much either.
Perhaps what made it so difficult was the fact that Draco truly did care for him. Even if his heart was still caught up somewhere else, there was someone here right in front of him that guaranteed a life of security. Corey was a siren, meaning once the war nonsense was over they could hideaway within the safety of the Islands. His mother was here, likely would remain here for the rest of her life, and if Draco mated another siren she'd be ecstatic for him.
Cassandra was always kind to him. At first he believed it to be her way of trying to survive, perhaps part of plan her escape. Yet she seemed genuinely interested in the questions she asked him; why he had decided to follow the Dark, why he had doubts, why he couldn't just leave. She made him vulnerable, had him opening up to her in a way that he hadn't with Lily. Made him love her in a way that made him want to completely sever his withering loyalty to the Dark Lord.
She released him, which resulted in both of them sitting in a comfortable silence while Draco tried to sort the spiraling thoughts in his brain. The worst part was that even though they ran rampantly inside the bounds of his skull, he had a firm grasp of their significance.
Despite all the commotion behind him--Dumbledore was there now with other infuriated professors--Draco couldn't take his eyes off of Cass. Once the thought had wormed its way into his forebrain, he couldn't shake it out.
He jogged to catch up, and Cassie took his arm in her elbow. "As you already know, Sirenum Scopuli was the birthplace of the First Siren. Each island is a distinct district; St. Achelous the home of the school and the majority of the shops, Isle Poseidon is home to our healers and elders, and Amphitrite being the island we're currently on."
"Maybe I'll just move in with you two-" Draco said, and Andrew's head snapped up to glare daggers at him. On second thought...
The lion blinked, then held out a hand. "Sorry, I don't think we've met, I'm Harry Potter. Me and Draco are friends."
Harry promised to talk to her again tomorrow, after some much needed rest, and she began to make her way back to the dance. She had taken them both into a courtyard hallway far enough from the Hall where they wouldn't be interrupted, and barely caught herself as she went around a corner to an untimely sight.
Snape straightened from where he sat at the end of the bed, one hand resting atop of Cassie's blanketed leg, like it was the only thing anchoring him to the moment.
Malfoy Manor was like a Dementor in how it sucked the life out of the room before anyone even set foot in it. It smelled as such, but that also could be attributed to the dead body rotting atop of the dining room table. Even coming in through the Floo, cold had settled into his bones the second he'd arrived.
"Enough," Snape snapped. "You need to stay here and protect Draco. He's going to send someone to figure him out, and you and Corey need to be prepared to throw them off his scent. Lie if you have to, but think of the bigger picture. What would She want you to do? Hmm? Why don't you go ask Her about Her damned prophecy and if she has any useful insight? Isn't She supposed to protect you? Go ask her how the bloody hell she let this happen."
Then again, sirens were not as common in the waters surrounding North America. They were native to basically everywhere else in the world, and even then all descended from the First Siren of Ancient Greece.
Her words seemed to shatter the earth underneath Severus' feet, as his godfather stumbled to sit down into a chair. Andrew, on the other hand, let out a heavy sigh and stood.
"If you so much as get a scratch in that bloody maze, I'll never let you out of my sight again," he warned. Dumbledore and McGonagall both shared looks of amusement at the rare outwardly display of emotion on behalf of the Potions professor.
"I am, sorry, by the way... It doesn't excuse the things I've said to you in the past, and doesn't erase the hurt that I've caused you, but I do apologize. There have been many times where I've wished that I could take it all back, you've done nothing to deserve such hatred."
"Hello to you, too, darling." He sounded both irritated and amused. "You could have just called after me, you know? I'm not actively running away from you."
He wondered whether or not he should feel more ashamed at the swirling in his stomach at the idea of seeing Draco that way. From the look Cassie was giving him, she seemed attuned to the path his thoughts were following.
His fifth-year companion spoke up. "You're free to brood if you want, or you can say what's on your mind. The latter would be much healthier for you, emotionally."
Ron leaped to the offense. "I saw her arguing with Professor Snape! She called him 'Severus' and told him that if he tried to give her detention ever again she'd steal his left femur and beat him with it!"
"Is none of your concern. You will stay here and protect Draco. If you go after her then he'll follow along right behind you, and then that's three sirens in the hands of the Dark Lord. Prophecy or not, I refuse to risk Draco's or your life when there is an alternative solution."
Harry shoved down the swell of irritation blossoming in his chest. "This is important, Ron, I'll make it up to you another time-"
But it didn't matter. As he got to where the two Hogwarts champions were kneeling, placing their own hands on the Cup, Draco was too late. He grabbed onto their robes in a feeble attempt to pull them away, but it was too late.
Draco could hear the blood rushing through his head. "Is it really that dangerous out there, for us?"
"Listen," Draco said, "I wanted to talk about what happened in the maze, during the Triwizard Task..."
He couldn't be one to judge her blood purity. If only she knew what he really was... Sirens ranked even lower than muggle-borns, at least the latter was allowed to live.
“Last night was definitely enjoyable. I wouldn’t object to a repeat at some point, though I want an actual date outside of your flat, as well. If we have to avoid  the Wizarding world while we string the interfering quartet along, I could always show you some more of the muggle world.”
When Snape released the feral siren, Corey and Andrew shoved him into the Great Lake, their robes sopping as they blocked his escape from the water. Snape gripped Harry's shoulder and pulled him back from the water's edge as the elder sirens fought to disrobe Draco before he could tear the fabric to shreds.
Draco keened, the noise sending shivers straight down his spine. It was impossible to ignore the two spectators right next to them as Draco pulled Harry flush against him, Harry instinctively gripping tighter at the sudden movement and prompting another drawn out moan from the Nightingale.
She composed her smile into one of benign innocence. It wasn't able to soften the steel edge in her eyes or the shark-like quality of her teeth. What it did do, however, was throw more fuel into the fire that nipped at their proverbial ankles.
The three sirens stood at alert, even when no danger presented itself after a moment's silence. They glanced wearily in the direction of the supposed source of the noise before Corey resumed his tirade.
Ron blinked, sitting upright to look at Harry like he'd grown another head. "Yeah, mate, what about it?"
The cat in question, Koshka, chirped in response. The darn stray had somehow turned into their cat, all because Cassie had decided to feed it after the brat had followed her in from patrol one day. Granted, the cat did keep the mice away from the potions stores, and Draco only held a grudge against Koshka because of the motherly affection he stole from him. Draco would be fine, but ideally he would not have to compete with a feline for his mother's attention.
So, as their sides were pressed together in the astronomy tower, Draco's mind was spinning. It did not matter that they were going back to Hogwarts. Potter was trouble, would only endanger everyone Draco cared about as well as Draco himself, and Draco's sirenhood would put an even larger target on both of their heads. There was also the hiccup of Draco being technically dead to the wizarding world, including Potter, and that the golden boy would never consider stooping so low as to think a siren anything other than a monster. A threat.
He hummed in annoyance of having last-minute plans sprung on him. "Very well, but if she finds anything incriminating it's on you to do the damage control."
"In honor of Mr. Malfoy's memory, and to allow anyone the time they need to grieve, classes are cancelled for the next three days. Professor Snape will also be taking a leave of absence for the week, meaning I will stand in as Potions professor. If students need to confide in a trusting adult, their Head of House, prefects, and other professors are here to support you. Mind Healers will also be present in the Infirmary for the next two weeks should you wish to talk with one. Lastly, I ask of you one thing: Be kind to one another. We all grieve in different ways. Even if we were not close to the one we lost, they always seem to have held a place in your life, and learning to live without someone is never an easy feat. To Mr. Draco Malfoy, you will be dearly missed."
"So, you and Corey, huh?" Cassie asked him after they had walked the perimeters of all three islands. The sun was beginning to set in the horizon, the evening sun casting them both in golden warmth.
Draco guided Harry over to a couch near the fireplace before leaving his side to go over to a solemn Andrew stood staring into the flame. They hugged, whispering something to each other, and he had to remind himself that he had no reason to be jealous.
All he could feel was his throbbing head, his vision beginning to swim on top of his toppling surroundings.
His husband rolled his eyes at him, the affection they held deep and on display for the whole world to see. Harry wanted to die of embarrassment, these two couldn't go anywhere in public without making heart eyes at each other.
Her status as a siren had been revealed early on in the summer by Professor Snape at an Order meeting, along with the revelation that Cassie was his daughter. The latter wasn't surprising to Harry, as in that moment he remembered learning that tidbit many months ago yet somehow forgetting about it almost immediately after.
"Potter, pay attention!" The Potions professor slammed a book down onto his desk, forcing him to startle from where he had begun to doze off.
Someone from a middle table cleared their throat. It was Eliot, a Sounding Tomb around Andrew's age, a siren that had been Head Boy at St. Achelous'. If they were sorted, he'd be a Gryffindor, no doubt.
However, upon leaving the Hall, he saw a flash of bleach blond hair rounding the corner towards the dungeons. Sprinting after the figure whilst ignoring a yell from Filch about running in the corridors, he barreled into Draco without meaning to.
"Care to leave?" he asked, not caring for any of this any longer. It likely would be more exciting without the deathly fear of fire he'd inherited recently. He could really go for a dip in the private pool in his quarters. Surely Cass had a similar idea in mind.
The ground trembled, knocking them both into the nearest wall, Draco smacking his head against a marble pillar. The whole building shook with it, portraits and paintings running out of their frames as rubble and dust rained down from the ceiling.
He rolled his eyes. "Potter's really not the brightest. It's a miracle he doesn't get lost on the way to his dormitory every day. And, we've already been over this. I'm trying to avoid causing a stir with him this year. It's not worth the risks."
He went back to scrutinizing his appearance in the mirror. His face had changed so much since the start of summer. His hand came up to brush against his cheekbones that seemed to be sharpening with each passing day. Even as his fingertips brushed over soft and delicate skin he failed to convince himself that he wasn't looking less and less human.
"Should we tell Severus? Do you think Dumbledore knows? Do you think Mad-Eye talked to him? Do you think Dumbledore told Mad-Eye to look into us?"
Snape paled, and Harry cheered internally. Caught in the act, then. The professor slowly stood to walk around the table to Draco. The two were talking in hushed whispers, until Snape looked over to Andrew with a strange look somewhere in between a glare and a plea.
Draco still had no clue as to the whereabouts of the caster of the Imperius. Why target the Triwizard Tournament? What-
"The Dark Lord has a keen interest in Narcissa Malfoy," Snape had informed them, "as her husband disclosed to him her status as a Nightingale siren."
Harry just hadn't anticipated Draco continuing to surprise him, although this likely was far from the last time that he would. The pure awe that struck him as he learned more and more about the sirens--now allowed to know every secret, way more than Hermione, thanks to his newfound status as mated--it would never get old.
Moody nodded. "Excellent. Five points to Slytherin. Now, why are sirens considered more dangerous than most other types of magical creatures?"
He grew quiet. The words he wanted to say died before they could even reach his tongue. He turned his head away as he quickly sat up. Cassie waited for him as he calmed the brewing storm within him to be able to speak.
