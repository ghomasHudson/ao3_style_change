"I'd be honoured," said Malfoy, making an obvious effort to let his shoulders drop.
The next morning, despite no-one spotting Hermione sneaking out to find them, the coffee table had several new Pamphlets.
"Good," said Harry.
Harry grinned. It had taken some time to get used to Andromeda's dry sense of humour. Harry couldn't bear the idea of anyone being sarcastic about Teddy, like the Dursleys had been about him, but Harry had learned by now that her words and behaviour to Teddy himself were nothing but doting.
"Look, I just need new jeans," interjected Harry, knowing he was fighting a losing battle.
"Oooh!" said Ginny, perking up from her position lying across a beanbag. "Is that the catalogue?"
"I don't like it," he said eventually, and his voice cracked. "I feel drunk and I don't like it. Fuck, is this me now? Unable to drink like a normal person?"
the weird one. It seems to me
"I do wonder what would have happened if it had been heads," he said, staring up at the archway of leaves and branches above them. Draco's Warming Charm pulsed, warm and familiar around him.
Ron looked appalled. Harry and Ritchie began to laugh.
Harry blinked at him. Malfoy made a good show of pretending to be looking at his book.
"What?" said Harry, looking down at his own body in confusion. Malfoy sighed.
"Thanks, Luna, but I'm fine."
He loitered uncomfortably as Draco sat Pansy, Harry lingering at his own chair at the head of the table, more in a display of loyalty than anything else. Draco gave him a funny look as they finally sat down.
Post dealt with, Harry felt a little lighter. By evening he was almost in a good mood again, humming to himself as he collaborated with Kreacher on a roast dinner. It was nice to know they'd all be in tonight for the vote, even if the vote itself made Harry jittery.
Harry thought it was kind of hot, that Malfoy was in tune with his house. He swallowed.
well, when we were in school. Swanning around, being all handsome and troubled. I thought it was all for show, but I see now that you didn't even know how you looked, from the outside."
Ginny gave him a dubious look.
"I'm wearing clothes," he said, shrugging. "Why, Malfoy, are you about to faint away?"
He spent a brief, guilty second considering Andromeda's long letters, hidden upstairs in a drawer. He'd carefully replied to each one, he'd sent pictures and presents, but it hurt to think of them both, and so he tried not to. He saw them at the Burrow on occasion, but it never seemed like enough, and he never got up the nerve to visit in person. How could Harry be a good godfather to Teddy? He couldn't even manage being an adult very well.
"Right," said Harry, annoyed that Malfoy had either assumed Harry's vote or didn't think to count it at all. "Another month it is then."
"Yeah," he agreed. "I don't even really know how to be a
"Obviously," Harry continued, very slowly, feeling that Malfoy might need it spelled out. "I would not do that. Because that would be the sort of thing
Harry gave him a smile.
"Not careful enough, obviously," said Hermione. "But there's no harm done."
Fish looked uncharacteristically shy.
Draco gave him a baleful look. "It's Latin, I didn't invent it," he complained. "Now come here, before I give up on this nonsense entirely and run off to Paris."
"Sent what?" said Harry sleepily, and sat up. Dean and Ritchie were already dressed, looking curiously at the package; the other three boys were already gone.
The sound of the stairs creaking distracted Harry from hearing Blaise's reply. Seamus had paused on the staircase, bleary-eyed and pyjama-clad, eyeing Harry's position by the door with his eyebrows raised.
Malfoy pushed him into an empty classroom and locked the door. Harry thought he could hear his own heart racing.
trauma group about your trauma?" he said. Ginny grinned.
Malfoy swigged, then immediately doubled over, hand to his stomach.
"My bathroom's closest," said Hermione, gesturing to the door across the hall. Malfoy staggered up through the door.
When he got to the Leaky Cauldron, he stopped to catch his breath for a moment. Then he slipped down the back alley, tapped the brick, and stood back.
As though sensing Harry's need not to go too deep, Adhikari spent the rest of the session discussing the abstract science of fears and phobias, showing him books with treatment programmes, magical tools and practical exercises, occasionally asking casual and specific questions about his moods or a childhood experience — things that Harry could answer calmly, factually. She wanted him to keep a mood diary, to track anxiety triggers, to fill out short worksheets. It felt more like making a battle plan with Ron than dealing with his feelings, and it felt
Malfoy looked suddenly exhausted; his backpack slid off his shoulder.
. I wasn't scared, even. Spider was being so nice to me, bringing me food and fussing over me and making sure I had plenty of painkillers, and — I thought it was getting better.
"It's the comedown," said Harry, rolling over onto his back. "To be expected. Won't last forever."
"Only myself," said Malfoy dryly.
Harry glanced at Hermione, who looked appalled, and Ron, who looked nauseous. He winced.
"I guess fortune favours the bold a lot more if they have a plan," said Harry, painfully aware that he did not have a plan. That he didn't even know where to start.
"Your loss," said Malfoy, smirking. His eyes were heated, and they sent pleasurable shivers down Harry's spine.
"Damn, Potter, where were you a week ago," said Malfoy darkly.
"In that case,” Harry stared into silver eyes with pupils blown wide, "You can always come up to my room. You can show me the CD player."
Harry winced. He had a vague, uncomfortable notion of his own status as a potential
He dropped a large, heavy paper book onto the coffee table. Several Pamphlets fluttered to the floor.
"Oh my God," said Harry. "They're true, aren't they?"
like snark, it hadn't been an
Harry let out a breath.
"Well, of course," said Hermione, flustered. "But sometimes people don't entirely realise…"
"Sounds like a plan," said Harry. "With less shouting."
"Oh," said Harry. "Well, there was no need to get so stressed about it, blaming me like I did it to you on
Hermione squeezed his hand. He smiled at her.
"Ah," said Hermione, looking as though she wanted to giggle. "Oh, I bet he was furious. I didn't know he liked guys – probably no-one else does too. And to kiss
Maybe he was just reading. Maybe, like Harry, he found it hard to use the library in the day, with all those eyes upon him.
"It's quite big," he said, letting his nerves get the best of him. It wasn't huge, but it wasn't a tiny little thing either.
It was kind of true — he had a small pile of owls he'd been studiously ignoring. But it still felt like running away.
"I don't think it works like that," said Dean.
Harry snorted.
Harry bought it, relieved that Dean had warned him about how good Camden would be at relieving him of Muggle money. Then he thrust it at Malfoy, who looked astonished.
Harry snorted, and Ginny looked at Ron as though considering an entirely different angle on the issue.
"Let me stop you there.” Malfoy held up a hand. "I am sure he has many virtues, but the fact remains that he could be the kindest, nicest, most perfect person in the whole wide world and I will still hate Harry Potter. Because it is very important to me that I do."
"Oh, how I love Quidditch talk," said Hermione darkly, while Ron grimaced.
Ron sighed, rubbing a hand over his forehead.
"You may be right, Weasley," said Malfoy haughtily, giving Ginny a smirk, but Harry could see two spots of colour high on his cheeks.
be a prick from now on and he's fine by me."
Ginny raised her eyebrows.
"Actually, it's easier than I thought. Grace thought it might help just to listen, but it turns out if you kind of start vague and pause whenever you're struggling to translate something, someone offers up the right words anyway. For example, did you know that I was
"First of all, he's in a bad way. He's sick, and he's got nowhere else to go, and he could do with some… positive influences, you know?"
Dean nodded, looking quietly troubled. Ginny watched him go before turning on Harry.
A long silence, which Harry couldn't interpret, and then Ginny muttered, "Well, serves me right for forgetting a Silencing Charm."
Or at least, Harry hoped it was.
Harry turned the speaker down and became aware that there was an insistent tapping at the glass of the drawing room window. Harry pulled back the nets; an elegant Great Grey owl was flapping at the glass.
Harry grinned and tugged at his pyjama bottoms, somewhat short in the leg nowadays, before descending to a squat on the hearth.
read something you give them, but if you can drop an organisation naturally into the conversation you'll have more luck. Not that everyone will want to talk to you, and that's alright — we're not here to save everyone, especially those who don't want our help, we're just here to hold out a helping hand. Make sense?"
He pulled out the Marauder's Map.  There was no-one in the common room – it was now or never if he was going to make it to the kitchens unscathed.
take it away," begged Ron, already halfway through his piña colada and sporting a cream moustache. "A dressing room is no place for a potions lab."
"Apparently so." Harry smiled down at him. "What exactly does that mean?"
"Excellent, come on, Pans," said Draco, catching her by the wrist. He pulled her up the stairs with surprising energy for someone who had just eaten three courses, the rest of them trailing lazily behind.
"What are we going to do?" said Seamus. "Have a dry party?"
Seamus, of course, burst into a filthy cackle at this. Malfoy made a high-pitched noise of alarm.
Hermione looked at him, head tilted, then her eyes flicked down to her hands.

Draco shifted, stared up at the canopy with lowered lids.
"Oh! Oh… thank you, Harry! It's just, Pomona is retiring in a few years and wants me to apply but she thinks I'm not ready — I mean,
"See you later, Harry," said Hermione kindly.
"I'm not," said Harry, smile sliding off his face. Malfoy was so close, now. Even in the dim light of the kitchen, his fair eyelashes caught the light as he blinked. "I like it when you call me Harry."
Harry wanted to kiss those gentle words, so he did.
"And your current wardrobe does?" said Ginny. "I'm pretty sure the only things you own that fit you, you bought from an Asda while on the run from You-Know-Who."
? He would have suspected a dark plot, but Harry couldn't imagine what Malfoy might want to do now.
Malfoy laughed, a light, free sound that Harry wanted to bottle.
to have you. It feels like some sort of — cosmic joke."
George scowled at Harry, like he'd committed an act of betrayal, and stalked off. Harry's chest ached for a long moment; George used to be the more circumspect one, but he had a short fuse nowadays.
"When you say serious," said Luna curiously. "What do you mean?"
"Then we'll begin at the most logical point — what brings you to seek Mind Healing? What would you like to achieve from our sessions?"
"Yeah, why not. Whose go is it now, anyway?"
"You're very famous. You own property in central London. You're the heir to the ancestral Black home," said Malfoy. "And
anything, no love or connection. The only other nakedness he'd really seen was in the Quidditch locker room, of course — something about that snagged on his mind, a vision of Oliver Wood himself, broad-shouldered and strong, looking down at him and smiling with affection — love,
Harry left dejectedly. Hermione fired spells indiscriminately as they walked.
"I'm going to chop it off," murmured Ginny. She sounded sleepy, almost drunk.
"Harry! How was lunch?"
"Maybe we should find him," Seamus speculated. "Just give him a quick hex and send him on his way. Nobody would have to know. Not for Malfoy's sake specifically, obviously, just for being a scummy person."
"No. I don't believe you. I don't get to have something like this."
"Oh," said Malfoy again. "Right. Well. Bottoms up, I suppose."
"Really amazing," he said. "Of course you can stay here. As long as you want to."
, because he
"Is that so?" she said, not sounding convinced. "Then why take the potion?"
"Dunno why," said Harry, shrugging. "It's fine. We did break up over a year ago."
"I paid his mate to tell me," said Harry. "If he's spinning a Machiavellian plot through withdrawal symptoms and the complete collapse of his life, he's smarter than I gave him credit for."
"What for?" said Harry. "Gringotts will send me cash by owl order if I need it."
"No promises," said Harry, smirking at Malfoy over his coffee. Malfoy looked back at him, confused and unsure; Harry raised his eyebrows, still smiling, and something in Malfoy's shoulders eased.
"Well, mostly by encouraging people to engage with local services," he said. "There's a stack of leaflets in the back — if you're serious about this, I'd recommend you take some home and read about what each one offers and to which people. People won't or sometimes
Fish took a break to scoop another lump of chicken out of his curry. Harry did the same, trying to imagine Malfoy in a pub, probably dressed in a suit and fancy brogues, in the middle of Muggle London and utterly lost. It would almost be funny, if it wasn't so frustrating. Did he really have no-one to turn to? Lucius was in Azkaban, but why wasn't his mother there?
"Fine, so not Blaise, but what about Pansy Parkinson? Or Crabbe and — I mean, Goyle?"
Harry's room was one of the smaller rooms in the house, although still expansive, with dark wood furniture and a four-poster bed. Harry hadn't made much of it besides putting his clothes in the wardrobe and spelling the textiles red; his Hogwarts trunk still sat at the foot of the bed, full of everything sentimental Harry had ever owned. It was tidy, thanks to Kreacher, and Harry saw it as Draco would. Painfully reminiscent of Hogwarts, and strangely devoid of evidence that it was
Malfoy looked up at him.
But that was the Dursleys talking again, wasn't it?
"Conspicuously the opposite," said Harry, and Ginny raised her eyebrows at the ceiling.
," said Kreacher darkly. "I am blaming Master Harry for this."
Malfoy's face went a little grey at that, but he nodded. There was silence for a beat, as Harry watched the two of them staring at each other.
"I live to entertain," he said. "Come on, Potter, I think it's time to go home."
"No," he said, after another long and breathless moment. "I spent my childhood being told on the one hand that I should pretend I don't exist, and on the other that I'm personally responsible for saving the world. Honestly, I don't know how good I'm going to be at managing
It did seem like a nice thought, to see the soup run regulars again. For the last few weeks, Harry had been avoiding the van and its influx of Christmas volunteers, working in the church kitchen with a rotating cast of friendly middle-aged women. He knew they'd be serving turkey soup and roast potatoes today, with plenty of salt.
"You had me to learn from!" said Seamus. "Font of filth that I am. Do you know, Potter, that I thought you didn't like me for like, a solid year?"
"I come to the Quidditch pitch sometimes." He hunkered further over his coffee, carefully not mentioning that it had been once, late at night, with only Ginny and Ron for company. "Don't tell me you want more from me?"
"Like… like a black pit opens up inside of me when I think of it. I feel stuck between wishing I were dead, and knowing that I…"
"Can't think why," quipped Ginny, "I'm on the pitch every bloody day."
"I think I've had enough of travel for a bit," said Harry, flinging a hand over his eyes. "I've backpacked all over the country, seen all the sights, remember?"
"On that note," Malfoy declared, getting up and shoving coins into his pockets. "I'm going upstairs. Thank you for this utterly hellish conversation, Potter, let us never do it again."
"I'm pretty sure all of it was hard," muttered Malfoy, covering his eyes again.
"Exactly," said Ginny, although her face had softened again. "We're not… ready."
"I'm unlikely to ever like you, Malfoy," said Neville, cutting him off. "I accepted your apology for the things you did
There was colour crawling up Malfoy's pale neck, now; Harry tried very hard not to think about licking it.
"Shift it, Potter," said Malfoy, and Harry did so awkwardly, feeling bare and unpleasantly sticky. Malfoy waved his wand over the mess and pulled his trousers up. Harry did up his jeans and leant against the desk behind him.
They hadn't said much, yesterday. Everyone had been too keen to talk about Harry's tattoo, crowding him, and Malfoy had smiled wryly from behind Hermione's shoulder and vanished upstairs.
Harry nearly dropped his drink in his lap. Apparently Malfoy had decided to buy new clothes for the occasion, because instead of the smart shirts or paint-splattered work jeans Harry had become accustomed to, he was wearing a silver shirt, and it was translucent. It fit his lithe form perfectly, the barest suggestion of a nipple flashing through the mesh fabric, and he'd paired it with black velvet jeans that hugged him like a lover. He'd done something to his hair as well, long and loose and swept back, nothing like his slicked-back look from school but instead fashionable and soft.
After the storm, the weather turned hot and bright again, and Harry began to spend more time in loose-limbed, sweat-damp work in the Grimmauld garden. With Neville and occasionally Ginny's help, Harry broke through weeds and brambles, peeling back each section to find exciting new treasures: a patio, a broken-down shed, an ornate birdbath.
Ginny stood frozen for a moment, then turned on her heel and ran after Dean.
"Oh really?" Ron raised one ginger eyebrow.
"You're not." Harry's voice was a dark growl, now. He tried, but he couldn't quite hold back the feelings burning in his chest. "I've watched you swallow your pride and take help over and over again, even when you didn't really know if you were safe. I've seen you face people you hurt. You've had to deal with everything from Voldemort threatening your family, to losing your wand rights, to having nowhere to live and surviving the attention of a nasty piece of shit, and you're
"Okay," she said, letting go of his wrist and turning to her tattoo machine. Harry looked up at Malfoy, who was standing in the gap beside the screen. He was very pale.
"Er," he said, and Malfoy gave him a sideways look. "You look better, by the way."
people are weird,
"I'm not sure," he said. "I think I could probably do with a bit more educating. Just to be sure."
Malfoy stared at him.
Harry listened to him walking down the stairs, bleakness now a background echo against a sudden zing in his limbs. Was Malfoy not well? Was he going out again?
It didn't feel like half an hour. It felt much longer and much shorter at once. Shev was right, though, the shading did hurt less — it was almost satisfying, burning warmth running up his wrist.
"I can't just casually turn up to a trauma group. It'd all be in the newspapers the next day."
"Come on," said Ron seriously. "We ought to go and introduce ourselves. I can't even remember any of their names."
They sipped at their tea. Harry wondered if it would be okay, if it would make sense, to pat the hand that Ginny had left resting on the table.
"Believe what you like, but I've not been… entirely good. It took me a long time to admit to myself that I was hiding Dreamless Sleep in my room not so much for nightmares but more in case I wanted to just… take a holiday from existing."
be ready, and I can't do that to you."
"It's perfect, Harry, thank you," said Neville from behind him, startling him. He was wearing his new jumper, and Harry was surprised at how much younger it made him look; at how much his usual five o'clock shadow and cardigan aesthetic made him look like the most grown-up of them, when he really wasn't.
"Yeah," he said, grinning. "Yeah, I'm good. Although maybe I need to sit down."
if you know what I mean, but he never said…"
"Shall I have a go?" said Hermione kindly. Ginny, behind him on the sofa with a full view of his wardrobe malfunction, snickered.
"Well fuck me," she said looking Draco up and down. "You're not joking."
"Fascinating," said Janine. "And you're together?"

"Oh, I see," he said, leering. "All three of you, is it?"
He'd not said a word about that.

"What was that?" said Harry.
Harry hadn't thought of that, but now it seemed awfully tempting.

Malfoy was silent for a long time.

My father — my father never said sorry for anything in his life. It felt
"Weasley," she said, startling Ron.
Harry, Ron and Hermione all winced, and Ginny pulled a guilty face, but it was undeniably true. True, and desperately sad. He lived in Weasley jumpers and plain shirts and supermarket jeans. He had holes in everything. He still owned things that had once belonged to a twelve-year-old Dudley.
"Wow," she said, after a while. "Is that the whole house now?"
tense for being threatened.
It was a book of erotic art, glossy prints of classic Wizarding paintings. The page Malfoy gave him had two muscled, golden men in it, completely naked, lying in front of a fireplace. The men were staring out at Harry, an exotic brunette and a golden-blond, and as Harry watched they very deliberately ran their hands over each other's bodies. Harry swallowed, shocked beyond belief – the painting seemed to notice, and entirely misinterpret, because with eyes locked on Harry the blond began kissing down the brunette's chest, tongue tracing a nipple, curling around the man's bellybutton, moving lower and lower until he was –
Hermione jerked, looking suspiciously as though she'd been poked by an unexpected bony elbow. Ron looked innocent beside her.
"I rather thought you'd decided to leave me to starve," he said.
"Right," said Harry. "Er, thanks."

"If Astoria weren't your very female
Harry tried to watch how Ron and Hermione touched, trying to learn the difference by observation alone, but they were not like the others. Ron touched Hermione easily, but gently, like she was something precious; like a butterfly that had chosen to land on him and might float away at any second. Hermione, reserved as she was, would typically wait until she thought they were alone to lean into him, to curl up against him, to kiss him in the kitchen in the sliver of sunlight from the basement window while the kettle whistled to itself on the stove.
"That sounds profoundly reasonable, given how difficult your life has been so far," she said. "May I call you Harry?"
afraid, he thought he might be as afraid as Draco was, but he wasn't going to give up now, not when Draco walked like that and kissed like that and while he thought there might be something good that could come out of this.
"Come on," said Draco, tugging Harry's hand, eyes dark and hungry. "I think you should follow your own advice. Come back to bed."
Harry looked at him for a long time, not knowing what to say. He wasn't naturally good with feelings; he didn't really have the words for them, barely knew what he was feeling himself some days.
The next day, Ron awoke to find a package at the foot of his bed.
"Why won't you just drop it, Potter? I'm not up to anything, and even if I was, it's none of your fucking business!"
"No," said Harry, for the tenth time, although he thought he might burst out with it any moment, and he dearly needed to talk to someone.
"You're not actually going to do this?" asked Malfoy quietly. "You're aware that they're permanent?"
Harry grinned.
Harry wondered if he wanted to be put with Malfoy, or dreaded it.
To his surprise, a hot tear fell from his face, splashing him on the hand. He looked at Adhikari; she caught his eye, looked down at her notes, and silently pushed a box of tissues towards him.
"That better be sarcasm.”
That's not normal."
, she mouthed, gesturing down the stairs. She waited until they were on the first floor before turning on him.
"Not a substitute for therapy," said Hermione sternly. "I've brought you a list of Mind Healers who might consider putting you on their books pro bono until you're on your feet. And the address of the local NA meetings. I can't make you go, but I would consider it a fair price to pay for the benefit of what I've just given you."
"Sure," said Harry, still grinning. "Speaking of deodorant, can I borrow some?"
"No, I don't suppose you have." Draco's eyelids dropped, as though he were composing himself. "Do you have anything you want to try?"
Harry grinned at her.
"Tea?" said Andromeda, gesturing Harry to the sofa. "Here, have Teddy for a moment. He's still a little dozy from his afternoon nap."
Harry stared at him. Draco was blushing, not meeting his eyes, as though he'd been caught stealing rather than giving. He still had paint on his forearms from his Muggle job, the one he worked all hours, and Harry's eyes followed the white-flecked constellations on those slim arms with new understanding. Malfoy worked all day, but he didn't have enough money for records in Camden. He bought most of his clothes from the charity shop. He hadn't been paying any rent for months, but he still seemed to have next to nothing to spend.
Harry raised his eyebrows.
. I was terrified, but maybe some part of me thought it was for the best. That I deserved it."
Harry nearly dropped the letter. They'd
"So what are you going to do?" said Hermione gently.
Harry watched as Draco brought a spoonful to his mouth. His eyes fluttered closed, a moment of rapt indulgence, and Harry found himself gripping his own spoon hard enough to bruise.
the appeal of dying.
and I'm holding you personally responsible. You made it look easy, you are a truly terrifying person."
"How about seventh year? Remember that?"
The guy nodded, like he approved of this.
"I started it," Harry explained. "Made him feel better if I called him a dickhead, apparently."
"Please, come up to the drawing room.” Harry imagined that's what a posh Slytherin would say. Blaise had the audacity to look surprised.
"Snape was shit at teaching," said Harry. Malfoy looked as though he wanted to defend Snape, but then he gave Harry a silent shrug of acknowledgement.
"Oh. You already have it. Sorry."
"Mind you," continued Hermione scornfully, drawing Ron's attention. "I wouldn't be surprised. Have you seen what she's done with that robe? They are
"Hello," said Harry, hostility taken out of his tone by his surprise.
Draco slammed a hand into Harry's shoulder, sending him staggering against a tapestry.
"My apologies, I overstepped." Malfoy's tone was cold, posture stiff. When he turned away from Harry, Ginny gave him a disapproving look.
"So Granger's got a kinky side?" said Derek thoughtfully. "I can see that. She's pretty hot too."

, said Dudley in his ear, unbidden, and Harry scowled. The Dursleys' voices had no place in his head, he'd known that since he was eight years old, and he hated the way they rose up unbidden now.
Everything seemed to turn to slow motion. Harry's heart, already beating fast from the flush of flirting, now seemed to flutter unpleasantly in his chest. He gasped, taking in an urgent breath as he took a step backwards, staggering until he hit a low wall. He slid down it, chest heaving, body dizzy, a sense of nameless and all-encompassing dread filling his every pore.
"Suit yourself," said Ginny, linking arms with Hermione. "Later, Harry."
"Right," said Harry. "Right, thanks."
"Necklaces can be for boys, Harry," said Ginny. "At least try it on, you'll like it. It's the exact colour of your eyes. And all you need to do if you're ever feeling overwhelmed is touch it. It'll help."
Now all he had to do was get up to Gryffindor tower and not get mugged.
Malfoy's face lit up.
"You like me a bit, I reckon," said Harry, smiling. "Why are you so afraid of that?"
Harry decided to return to Hogwarts after the war for his seventh year. So did Hermione, which was not surprising, and Ron, because he couldn't bear to be away from Hermione.
"That wouldn't be very good for your reputation," said Harry dryly.
element, which Hermione hadn't mentioned. He didn't know a lot about churches — the Dursleys would sometimes slope off to one at Easter, or when Aunt Marge was down — but he was fairly certain they didn't like people like him. He wondered if John would mind if he knew he was dealing with an odd, slightly broken, possibly bisexual wizard.

By five o'clock Ron and Harry had stopped making sandwiches in favour of eating them behind Kreacher's back, something Kreacher evidently had no intention of preventing, despite their increasing lack of subtlety. On one particularly transparent grab, Harry was fairly certain Kreacher winked at him. At about half past five, Ginny came downstairs. There were sparkly shamrock-shapes in her hair.

Then Malfoy lunged again, and Harry thought perhaps his spell might not have worked until Malfoy's hands were around his neck.
Luna was waving at him madly from the doorway of a tiny, pink-painted tea room, tucked neatly between a crystal shop and a large textile emporium. She was wearing a pink apron, and an awful lot of things about her array of strange new clothes and the smell of food and incense clicked into place.
"You should definitely check out the soup run tonight, Harry," said Ginny, in his ear. "Trust me."
"I successfully worked a Muggle job for a
"Right," said Malfoy, looking between them as though this perfectly normal and civilised exchange were bizarre. "Yes, thank you for coming, Blaise. I hope it wouldn't cause any inconvenience for you to visit again."
me, sir, is room service inadequate?" said Harry dryly. Malfoy gave him a funny look, but stepped back to let him in.
Harry stopped, but it was too late. He'd started now, and Draco's eyebrows were already raising again, pale eyelashes glittering in the dawn light.
responsibility."
"Good," said Hermione. "Anyway, I'm not here to demand restitution. I have something for you. It's as much a favour to Harry as it is a gift for you. No need to be alarmed."
it's because wizards are sophisticated international travellers and are more culturally aware than silly old Muggles. Did you know that's what the textbooks say?"
Draco was still hard, pressed wetly against Harry's t-shirt; if Harry was terrifying, Draco didn't seem to mind.
"Can I stay here?"
Dean, to their surprise, laughed raucously.
Harry thought of Malfoy, and blushed.
"The second he spoke to me," continued Malfoy, looking away, "It was like he really
people."
"Excellent," said Malfoy, as though nothing momentous had just transpired. He clapped a hand on his shoulder. "I'll let Ginny know."
"I know," said Harry, glaring. They sat there in silence for a moment, both staring awkwardly at the coffee pot.
Harry, too, felt like he was fixing up by degrees; the lights and sounds of the pub slowly stopped bothering him, and he hardly ever touched his wand at the sight of a strangely dressed customer in Tesco anymore. But sometimes, for no reason he could fathom, something dark and terrible would still set upon him, some nameless fear that whispered
"Gonna give us a show, Harry?" asked Seamus, winking and nodding at Harry's pile of clothes.
"Urgh," said Harry, scrambling to flip himself over in half-laughing frustration. "Does anywhere do owl-order?"
Draco put one knee up, still shamelessly naked, and brandished his wand.
It was particularly incensing because the happier Malfoy became, the more the sight of him made Harry's heart turn over. Like the day Dean came into the drawing room and handed Malfoy a piece of paper with a number on it.
"Ah, Harry," called Seamus from the doorway. "I was hoping to pick your brains about my birthday party. Are you
"Spider," said Ron, nose wrinkling. "What a stupid name."
like someone. Even Veela don't seem to do it for me like they do for, say, Ron."
"That's easy," said Draco, pulling his hips closer. "You would have been too busy in Auror training to go rescuing a Death Eater in trouble. You might not even have heard about me. You and Weasley would pass training together and become an Auror dream team and everyone in Grimmauld would pair off and make little homes for themselves until it was just you and Ginny, barely living in Grimmauld at all, saying hello to each other in the gaps between your whirlwind careers. You'd probably end up hooking up with her out of sheer convenience. And if that happened, convention and Mrs Weasley would push both of you towards marriage. Ginny would probably agree as long as you didn't insist on monogamy."
"And without his mother, you would not have killed Lord Voldemort?"
Malfoy's slow, creeping smile made his heart stop. Malfoy was
Harry covered his amusement with a bite of brownie.
But it was him, climbing the stairs to the first floor, his footsteps weary. Harry hung back in the downstairs hallway, listening with surprise to the sound of Malfoy stopping on the landing and opening the drawing room door.
"You try," Draco murmured, and Harry raised his hands and tried to copy. Malfoy huffed a laugh. Harry glared at him.
"Oooh, he used the

"I can't just roam the halls like a housepet. I'm — I'm going out."
"Hermione…" said Ron slowly. "I meant the stuff about Malfoy. Don't you think it's weird he agreed so quickly to volunteer after hearing Malfoy was there? It's going to be sixth year all over again!"
Harry stared at Dean, whose focus on his notebook was intense, his sketch lines gone dark and heavy. With a deep breath, he repressed the urge to jump to Hermione's defence.
Teddy hugged Andromeda as Harry made his way downstairs, looking like he might cry at Harry's departure, and Harry considered never leaving again. Instead, he gave them both a long hug, and pulled himself away.
Hermione cleared her throat again. Harry gave her a shifty look, and kept his eyes on his plum pudding.
Harry froze as Malfoy rounded the corner, and scrabbled for his wand. He didn't know how long that nose-blocking spell lasted, and stupid bloody Malfoy had probably taken it off anyway.
"What a band!" said Ron, laughing over Hermione's frustrated noises. "Galvin Gudgeon, backing vocals."
Harry sighed again.
"Well-observed," said Malfoy darkly, not moving at all. There was a long moment where neither of them said anything. Harry stared out at the motes of dust in the thin bar of sun that pierced the curtains, not thinking about anything in particular.
"What now?" said Ginny, watching.
"I still don't know. It's funny really, I spent so long knowing exactly what I was going to be doing with my life whether I wanted it or not, but now I have options I can't even begin to choose. I know more about building houses than I ever expected to, and I seem to have a rapport with House Magic, I could make a career in that if I wanted. Or I could use my skills to renovate the Manor, but I don't know if I'm… ready yet. And I want to help people, and I'm good at making things work with magic — oh, speaking of, your present, it's in the drawing room, hang on —"
"That just makes it more bizarre," said Malfoy, but he slumped against the wall, and looked a little better.
"I didn't know –"
Harry snorted. "What about Muggle shops? Surely they do?"
"Wanker," he mumbled.
exactly, but every day Harry would wander about the house until he found a new thing to fix or clean or tidy. Then he would summon Kreacher for advice or tools, and Kreacher would complain about Harry's aversion to using magic, and then Harry would settle into working on whatever it was until it was done. There was something peaceful about the repetition of a manual task; even scrubbing the grout in the bathrooms with a toothbrush felt more meditative than boring.
Harry closed his eyes. He thought of the Dursleys, that summer after Cedric, about how he'd felt furious and deserving of suffering all at once. He thought about those moments in his life, those rare and bittersweet moments, when Aunt Petunia treated him like a human being. He closed his eyes tight, and understood.
"It'll pass," murmured Harry, low and soft, hoping it would help the way it sometimes helped him. "It's okay, It'll pass."
"I think it took him maybe three weeks before I complained to him about Fish and Jenny and he asked me to move in with him." Malfoy looked away again, shivering in his see-through shirt. "He told me they were leeches, that they were taking the piss having me tend the bar and clean the house and giving me so little for it. And then he told me I was the first person he'd ever met that made him feel the way he did. He told me… "
And he sloped off up the kitchen stairs.
"You've got me there," he agreed. "But this is actually very important to me, Kreacher. It's a gesture of thanks to the household."
But Malfoy was like a glittering thing, dancing in the corner of Harry's eye. At the end of his second drink, Harry summoned up the energy to say hello to everyone: making awkward conversation with Parvati Patil at the buffet table, kissing Blaise on the cheek like it was something they did, hugging Hannah Abbot. Malfoy was perched on the arm of the sofa talking to Ernie, waving a vol-au-vent and looking exaggeratedly at ease, all long slim lines and a loose smirk. He made it look easy, like he wasn't scared to be here at all, but Harry could see that it was an affectation; every now and then, when Ernie looked at his plate of food, Malfoy's mouth would turn down, his eyes flicking about the room as if anticipating an attack.
Hermione cleared her throat. Everyone looked at her; she opened her mouth as if to speak, frowned, and shut it again.
, after all."
It helped, but it didn't stop the more discerning owls from occasionally finding a way to get to him.
"Is there a reason you be blocking our noses, sir?"
Draco looked up at him, startled.
"New Year's Day," murmured Draco, after a moment. "Planning to make any resolutions?"
"Oh?" said Harry, unable to figure out what she was about to ask, or what could warrant Ginny's tone.
He saw Ritchie inhale, and then inhale again deeply, with a faint smile.
"I'm beginning to realise that. I thought I knew you
not pretending to like you now!" shouted Malfoy.
going to analyse what it did to him, to be commanded to do filthy things to Draco. Instead, he obediently trailed a wet hand along Draco's balls and then under, to the soft spot beyond, the tight furl beyond that. He slid a finger in, slow; Draco sighed, a pleased sound, and brought his knees up a little.
He walked along the corridor in a daze, only remembering that he still hadn't got rid of the magical deodorant when he reached the entrance hall. The hall was busy with people crossing to get to their next lessons, and Harry froze in horror as the closest girl sniffed, breathed deeply and turned blindly. Sensing prey.
, with the street empty and Hermione's hand tight around his bicep.
Harry stuck his head around the door. Malfoy was shivering over the toilet, damp with sweat. The room smelled of vodka and bile.
"Come sit down," she said. "It'll start in a bit."
"Nirvana," said Malfoy in one shop, holding up a t-shirt with a bright yellow smiley face. "I know that name, from the records. I liked them."
"Thanks," he said. "Look, if you wanna chat about music some other time, I'm here most weekends. Or you can give me a call. We could go for a drink, even catch a gig."

Whilst Harry had the suspicion that her parents took

hard not to, but it's hard to collect
"Afternoon, Finnegan," greeted Harry, grinning. "Sleep okay?"
Harry reached out, tried to grab Draco's wrist. Draco backed away.
Harry dived desperately for the aerosol. He squinted at the fine print, but it was all muggle warnings and instructions. Then Hermione pointed to the front.
you? Well, I don't. I
don't even know what I want. So you can stop speculating, thank you very much."
echoed Harry's brain, disbelieving.
In honour of the bittersweet nostalgia, Harry popped the cork on a bottle of pumpkin juice and set it beside Malfoy's left hand. Malfoy took a swig, looked surprised, smiled to himself, and then schooled his face into disapproval.
," said Luna. "We're not quite profitable enough to employ anyone full-time at the moment, but I'm sure I can pass you a commission."
Actually, you're very fortunate I'm here at all, really."
Harry felt bad for briefly wondering the same, given how little Dean knew about his father.
"Is that… a band?" said Malfoy, endearingly tentative.
they hurt, he didn't know anything at all. It was probably one of the more ridiculous things he'd ever done.
He pulled open the front door and stalked outside, still barefoot and undecided about whether he was about to give Blaise a piece of his mind. Blaise watched him approach with a bland expression.
"I hear some people do," said Seamus from the drinks cabinet, amused. "Who wants some? Wine, I mean, you dirty buggers."
"Too good to go to lessons, Potter?"
"Maybe we can tell him your brains were addled in the war."
"I hope so," said Draco. "You're better than that."
Ritchie attempted a close-quarters rugby tackle. Harry dodged, and made a heroic run for it.
"I'm sure you are, with a hunk like that," said Pansy with a filthy smirk, and Hermione nearly dropped her fork again. Harry's eyes pulled back to Draco, who had an expression on his face like he was suppressing a laugh with all his might.
"Careful, Potter, you're giving me a good idea how
a little bit exotic?" said Seamus.
"Oh, so you're
Then Draco moved like silk, slipping past Harry's chair and onto the piano bench, and Harry watched him breathlessly before he realised he had to follow. He couldn't not. The rest of the room had gone curiously silent.
state, of having to make a choice between a concrete bed or a stranger… Harry felt a surge of disgust. What kind of a person would want to prey on a homeless nineteen-year-old?
Pansy's lip twisted, like she wanted to say something cutting, but she didn't.
"While everyone else enjoyed a lovely stroll in the park," retorted Malfoy.
"What, does everyone think I'm some sort of insane bigot who'll fall out with you at the drop of a hat? Well, that's really nice. Not that I'm saying there's not a bit of a precedent, of course, but still. I usually have, like, reasons!"
"I am betrayed. Tell me, how much were my most intimate secrets worth?"
Hermione was silent for a while.
"Some buzz," said Malfoy bitterly. "But… yes."

"I'm sure this won't surprise you by now, but in the morning, he was
Neville looked sheepish when Harry arrived in the kitchen somewhat after midday the next day. He also looked the worse for wear, brown hair tousled and yesterday's jumper askew, like he'd slept in it.
"It just goes that way."
the police?" said Luna.
"That's my room," said Harry, pointing to the door that led to his room at the front of the house. "And Dean and Seamus have those two rooms. That's our floor's bathroom, and yours too, since there's not one on the floor above."
In fact, the whole morning was rather a triumph.
"Oh, Harry Potter, what a surprise," said Ginny, angry and embarrassed. "Avoid me all day only to come and find me now, when I've finally found someone who actually listens?"
"Mum's driving us mad, Harry."
"Having him in the house makes me more uncomfortable than I thought it would," said Neville quietly, poking at his rice. "I keep expecting to turn a corner and have him be there in his Hogwarts robes, calling me names."
"You're not wrong, Luna," said Harry. "I don't think you're that weird at all. Or… you are, but in all the good ways."
"Alright," said Harry, although ignoring Malfoy felt like ignoring something brittle and dangerous lurking in the corner of the room. He turned to the washing up. Malfoy sat for a moment, and Harry could see the confusion on his face out of the corner of his eye.
? Never mind that I'd never touched a Muggle oven in my life. And there were people at the house, mostly quiet junkies, but occasionally someone scary or unpleasant. Sometimes they'd call me names, make gross jokes about Spider's posh little rent boy, and he'd just laugh. But still he was always so
Harry shrugged off the empty feeling in his chest.
"How'd he end up a wreckhead?" asked Fish, following the thought. "Yeah, wild innit. He must be from

"Not a thing," said Dean. "It's getting pretty close to me applying to McDonald's."
"Yeah," said Dean, wiping his face. He pulled Seamus back down onto the sofa. "That was a weird experience. He's actually
"Well, I mean, I
Harry wanted to do something. Harry wanted to touch him. Wanted to grab him. Wanted to…
They ran for it.
"At night," said Malfoy scathingly. "
"When will they be back?" he asked, failing utterly to look nonchalant.
"Very wise of him, especially given the revote. And is he turning his charm on you?"
"What are you saying?" said Ginny.
Harry leant his head on Hermione's shoulder. The park was a peaceful oasis, cool and tranquil in the autumn light. Amber leaves fluttered down from the trees; Harry breathed in the smell of damp earth and tried not to think of anything at all.
Harry pulled a face.
"It might not be forever," she said. "Malfoy gets his wand back soon. He might even get it back early — he has a review hearing in a few weeks, now he's got a
"I know it must be hard to fight temptation all the time," he murmured.
on, and that was that it was quite funny. He nearly choked on his tea three times, and when a woman entered the shop who looked just like Umbridge but was dressed like Trelawney, Draco did a skit about the two of them combining until Harry couldn't breathe for laughing.
The whole thing made him uncomfortable.
Harry let out an amused hum, glancing at Seamus.
"Right," said Malfoy. "Observe the black keys. You see how the black keys are clusters of two and three? The white key to the left of the two black keys is always a C." Malfoy pressed a key with an exaggerated wrist movement; it rang out. "Then of course the two to the left are B and A, and then we have D, E, F, G, then back to A."
get a guy's number." Malfoy pouted. "You're not even interested."
He rubbed a hand over his face, and went upstairs to retrieve
"That's hot," said Pansy. "Draco, why didn't you tell me Weasley got hot?"
Hermione strolled casually out of the dorm room. Harry watched her go.
Much to Harry's surprise, he didn't hear Malfoy make a dart for the door at the earliest opportunity that morning. He didn't hear anything from the top staircase at all until well past ten, and even then, Malfoy's step was unusually slow and heavy.
Harry considered it a sign of Kreacher's emotional progress that he didn't immediately burst into tears. He simply beamed, giving Harry an appraising look up and down.
"Er," he said. "Well, you know. Some people don't.
"But that's not a good enough reason, obviously," said Ron.
"Think I reminded him of his abusive ex," he mumbled, because even though it hurt him to admit it here, to his friends, he knew it
"Potter," he said. Harry couldn't speak to reply. "Harry," he said, gentler. Malfoy was bending down over him, staring into his face, and Harry felt hot and cold all over, the movement of the crowd around him claustrophobic. He couldn't see the men, he needed his wand but he couldn't do magic in front of the Muggles — his vision was tunnelling —
"Am I in the servants' quarters?"

"Fuck, Potter, you are

of it, of feeling like Malfoy was as affected by Harry as Harry was by him.
, as if I cared whether your stupid little club thinks!"
"Potter, you haven't..."
"We liked Radiohead, too," said Harry. "Alanis Morissette. Bowie. Pink Floyd. Honestly I don't know what I'm into, seems to be all over the place."
Harry smiled faintly at his four awestruck new dorm mates.
Harry wasn't entirely convinced he'd always been a good friend to Neville, but he supposed that was no reason not to try now.
"A couple of times sneaking food into the dungeons does not make him a friend, Luna," growled Dean. "All I saw was an evil-minded little shit quivering in his boots because pure-blood fucking supremacy wasn't as glamorous as he imagined. I have nightmares of that tosser's cellar. No."
"Any chance
Seamus's bedroom door was open, Seamus himself leaning in the doorway, hair messy and expression curious.
"You know when you found me hiding at lunch?"

"I know what it means.” Harry pointed out the window.
"So what is your forever plan?"
"I mean, that was a
"There's a classroom a few corridors away. Should be fine if we seal the door. Come on."
Ginny, Hermione, Neville, and Ron's faces echoed how Harry had first felt, upon hearing the story — confused, but horrified. Dean's expression had hardened, though, and Seamus was frowning, one hand on Dean's leg. Luna, as always, looked perfectly placid.
your sex slave," protested Harry.
"Don't stay up too late," said Ginny. "Parkinson can see herself out perfectly fine."
"You," said Neville. "You're alright by me. There's some things I can forgive and some things I can't. But I reckon those are things I can, and I believe you regret it and you want to change, so you're alright by me. As long as you don't, you know, hurt anyone again."
The group left haphazardly after dinner, Ginny and Ron arguing up the stairs about whether Mbene would make it to the World Cup, Luna following behind. Hermione stopped longer to pick a fight with Kreacher over the washing up, which Harry ended by getting up and starting it himself, throwing suds at Hermione when she tried to argue. Neville stayed, having given himself a second helping of stew, and Malfoy stayed too, still picking over his first one and shooting Neville furtive looks.
Then he leapt. Harry was knocked back onto his bed, and Ritchie's mouth seemed suddenly very close and
"Right," said Harry again, getting up, making Malfoy dip awkwardly as the pressure on the beanbag changed. Malfoy scowled; Harry threw a smirk over his shoulder as he left the drawing room, and Malfoy's face did something strange in response, and then Harry was flooding with inexplicable heat as he fled.
Malfoy looked at him then, eyes wide and confused. He looked younger all of a sudden, a scared boy huddled on a bathroom floor.
"I can do something smaller, but you'll lose a lot of detail, and they tend to bleed over time. But it's up to you." She pulled a pack of baby wipes closer with her right hand, her left still grasping Harry's wrist. It was strangely intimate.
to hate me. For some reason."
"Thanks, Harry," she said, smiling vaguely at her embroidery. She'd taken to hand-stitching patterns on every textile Harry owned; little doxies on the curtains, bees and butterflies on the cushions. Harry felt like it would have been normal to be annoyed, but wandering through the house had become a treasure hunt; Harry's favourite find was the little pink moustache she'd embroidered over Walburga Black's face on the family tapestry.
"Don't want no scrub weighing you down on your path to Quidditch superstardom," agreed Seamus, nodding sagely. Ginny's grin was bright and fierce.
"And they wouldn't even fit that many people in a room," mused Harry, gazing into the distance. Then he turned to stare at her.
Seamus and Dean were on a date tonight, and Neville was visiting Hannah, so only Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Luna were waiting to greet Pansy in the dining room. Hermione was stiff in her chair, and looked as though she were only there to make a point. Ron hastily stood when they entered; Ginny looked askance at him, and he shrugged and mouthed
house, what they've done is painted up a warehouse. I'm pretty sure they stole the carpets out of a skip, there are bizarre art installations everywhere, and the whole place is heated with a pot belly stove that seems dubiously safe. And I'm not entirely convinced anyone in residence actually pays to use the building."
"I'm not ignoring you," said Harry, voice rough.
Hermione tilted her head at him. "What did you say?"
"Seamus told me he'd be here," said George darkly, sidling up to Harry, "But I can't quite believe it. Still as punchable as ever, I see."
"Oh hey, I forgot it was basically a Gryffindor Quidditch team reunion in here," said Ron, looking much happier. He jumped onto the nearest available bed. Harry sat down on the one beside it. He wondered which one Colin had slept in.
"I died at the battle of Hogwarts," he said. "And I don't mean metaphorically."
"Have fun!" he said.
"Amazing," said Ginny, her grin spelling terrifying things for Harry's house. "You two are planning on changing into something other than
"Don't you think she was a bit young to be affected?" said Harry.
Harry's insides squirmed, his eyes flicking instantly to Malfoy, who — to Harry's strange relief — gave the tiniest roll of his eyes.
"I feel really guilty, leaving Harry upstairs like that," he heard Hermione say, which was gratifying.
"Ah," said Malfoy, turning toward the drawing room door. He looked suddenly tired. "Well, this has been — weird. But not bad. Congratulations on your victory, Finnegan. I'll just…"
"Pansy," said Draco, and his eyes flashed with something Harry hadn't seen before, something dark and dangerous.
"I really don't," said Harry dryly. Seamus looked disappointed, and then pleadingly at Dean.
"Don't say a word," she said, gesturing to the open bathroom door, and the sounds of Malfoy being sick.
"Your existence makes me uncomfortable," muttered Malfoy into his cup, but his shoulders slumped again.
"Do you care?"
"Potter, I hate you," he said again, which Harry was beginning to suspect actually meant 'Potter, you're right and I'm angry about it.'
"It's being a bad host," said Ginny, as though that trumped all potential objections. Ron nodded, as though this logic were obvious.
Dean got up, flashing a grin at Seamus, and clapped a hand on Draco's shoulder. Draco flinched.
Hermione let out a little huff of laughter.
"Yeah," he said. "Sorry. I do, you know,
"How about Paris?" said Pansy brightly. "Do you remember when we tried to sneak into the Eiffel tower after hours — "
"I tried to limit the glitter," she said dryly, gesturing to the décor. "But I'm afraid there was no saving the dining room."
"You'd think," said Ron, grinning, "But I went to the canteen. It's just I have fifteen minutes until Poisons and Antidotes and there's a slice of mum's coffee cake in there. Accio lunchbox!"
"And you called
Luna didn't ask him anything difficult. She never asked him why he wasn't… doing something else. Whatever it was you were supposed to do, when you'd just won a war.
"Dickhead," said Harry, grinning. Malfoy looked up at him, startled.
"Um, Gin —" said Harry. "It's really nice, but —"

"You're good, you know, Weasley," he said, guiding them back to the safe zone of Quidditch. "You're going to get hired any day now, I'm sure of it."
"She's not going out with him," said Hermione quietly in his ear, and smirked when he started.
"Yeah, get your kit off, Harry," she called, grinning. Harry looked at her, then at the slim tube of pale blue silk that made up Ginny's new dress, and swallowed. He glanced at Dean, sharing in an awkward ex-boyfriend moment; Dean grinned, and then nodded to Luna.
for beer pong."
"You've got away with so much shit because of this," he said. "I really think I ought to confiscate it."
"Must be? As in, you don't know from experience? Wow, either she's frigid or you are," teased Andy.
"It's alright," said Hermione, and Harry relaxed. "You can put the broom down. I'm guessing it didn't work?"
Draco shook his head.
Harry shrugged. "Inherited a record player. Got any recommendations?"
He didn't sound scared by the prospect at all. He sounded keen, maybe even a little hungry.
," said Draco, sounding uncannily like Snape.
coming back to him. This is worth the risk. This is worth owing you a debt. This is, quite frankly, an extravagantly excessive gesture." He paused. "Ever think it's weird, Granger, that even the most devout of Muggle-lovers don't want to share this sort of thing?"
Teddy had a certain enthusiasm for making them crash, and he spent a good fifteen minutes knocking over the chunky plastic water tower and laughing hysterically when Harry set it right again. Harry listened diligently to Teddy's babbling instructions to set up the train set in ever more dangerous ways, laughing when Teddy giggled uncontrollably. He was fairly certain he wasn't supposed to be enjoying himself quite so much with a small child's toy, and a non-magical one at that, but it felt good to just
But he'd
Shame, shame upon the family!"
Harry certainly did not know anything about GITS, but at least that answered Harry's urgent concerns about his own obliviousness during school.
She picked a blue marker up off the table. Harry sat down and held out his right arm.
The coast outside the bathroom was clear. Harry, still conscious of the possibility that a bath had not worked (in fact, now he came to think of it, Weasley's Wizard Wheezes were often notoriously difficult to get rid of), made sure to keep his wand out as he crept down to the ground floor.
"Get OUT!" shouted Draco, startling Harry; he jumped to his feet, and a strange look flashed over Draco's face, but Harry didn't register what it was. He turned away, yanked open the door, and then stopped.
"If Darren tries to cheat off me one more time," replied Dean, stabbing at his stew. "I'm going to be calling you to help me dispose of the body."
"I don't really want us to be enemies," said Harry desperately, wishing he could wipe the look of despair from Draco's face.
Malfoy gave up his position lurking in the doorway. He sank onto the sofa and put his head in his hands.
"Potter.” Malfoy looked uneasy. "You didn't answer why. Someone who feels like he owes me a favour might — well, they
"You see,
"Not feeling it," said Ron, looking longingly at the beer.
"Oh?" said Hermione. "What for?"
," said Harry, running a hand through his hair.
"I hear you've been making plenty of men happy," said Seamus, waggling his eyebrows, then yelped as Dean and Ginny both prodded him. "Not a criticism!" he said. "I should be so lucky."
Draco put a hand on his chest and pushed Harry backwards until he hit a desk. Then he moved in, sliding a thigh between Harry's as he twisted a hand in Harry's hair and kissed him fiercely. Harry groaned, happy to be abused for now, and rubbed shamelessly against him. Draco groaned and it sounded involuntary, desperate, as unconscious as the hips now grinding against him. Harry wanted more, scrabbled to get at it, pulling Draco's robe up until he broke the kiss to toss it aside, and Draco followed suit with Harry's before Harry could start on Malfoy's shirt. Then Malfoy was kissing him again as he fumbled between them for the button of Harry's jeans, and Harry let his hands explore the smooth back under Draco's shirt. He traced around his waistband, and Draco bucked as Harry's fingers skimmed the line of his hipbone, but it did not distract him for long; Malfoy's nimble hands were undoing Harry's zip, and one hand slid down into his boxers. Harry clawed at Draco's shoulders, throwing his head back, and Draco's mouth descended to bite down on Harry's neck as he began a messy, perfect rhythm, grinding his hips.
"Did you hear that the reserve Seeker for the Holyhead Harpies is pregnant?" said Ginny. "She announced it's Byron Warbeck's, but he swears he was in Paris at the time of the supposed conception. Quite the scandal."
"True," he agreed, smiling slightly at his stew. "All thanks to Harry, of course."
They left the room, Dean shutting the door behind him. Then Ginny began to giggle, which set Seamus off, and before they knew it they were all laughing until they cried.
"God," he said, cringing into Hermione again.
"No," said Malfoy, voice taut. "Well, I'm not averse to some tactical sucking-up, yes, but I know you're not stupid, Longbottom, you wouldn't believe me. I'm just trying to be better — I don't have any idea what I'm doing — "
For a long moment, Harry stayed there, near enough to feel Malfoy's warm breath on his cheek. Then Malfoy exhaled sharply and looked away.
It was… odd.

, sweat-drenched and bright-eyed.
"And he knows it's not forever?" asked Neville.
"Nah," said Harry, "I'll take them all. And these." He brandished the records. The man's pierced eyebrow rose.
"A bit of what?"

Draco's eyes roamed his face, settling upon his mouth. Harry's heart pounded, time stretching like elastic until Draco finally pulled himself up and crushed his mouth to Harry's.
"I hope that was the only charm you forgot," said Luna mildly.
Harry didn't really mean to intrude on these moments, but he'd got to know the house by now. He was used to knowing where to stand to not make the floor creak or disturb the sideboards. He didn't really want to ask
"Oh," said Malfoy, very quietly, as half the party turned to look. Then Luna spotted him, and pulled him inside before he could protest, and Luna's approval seemed to be enough for the crowd to accept Malfoy's presence. And in any case, everyone was immediately distracted by Ron jumping up on the beer pong table and helicoptering his shirt while Seamus shouted, "Glitter cannon!" and used a cardboard contraption to blast him with glitter shamrocks.
have my revenge."
"Probably fun," said Seamus, winking at her.
As he spoke the words, he sat up again, drenched in alarm. What if Luna couldn't — Malfoy couldn't go out on the streets again — Harry couldn't bear the thought of him being that vulnerable again —
A few days later, in a quiet moment, Harry found Malfoy stretched across a beanbag, lean and elegant, pale hands turning pages on an old, fragile Potions textbook.
"Binary? Like in Arithmancy?" said Malfoy. "Hermione has all these equations written with runes in her dressing room —"
Kreacher was much less gaunt these days, and he had an array of pillow-case outfits now, from casual cotton to formal silk. He seemed to have more of a sense of humour the more time Harry spent with him, and he hardly ever went into wailing agonies of guilt any more. For reasons Harry couldn't explain, he seemed to get on with Harry more than anyone else, though nowadays he was unfailingly polite to everyone, even Hermione.
"You don't
Harry hated how Draco's smile widened and then fell, in slow motion.
"Because I don't want you to," said Harry, his voice low and dark. Malfoy's eyes flicked down to his mouth, and Harry thought about how easy it would be to close the gap between them, if only his legs would move.
"Merlin save me. I don't think I'm physically capable of doing
Ginny, halfway through a mouthful of casserole, nearly choked at this, and Harry stared at his bowl and tried very hard not to look suspicious in any way. Dean and Seamus gave each other an amused, borderline conspiratorial look. Harry did
Harry's anger flared hot inside him.
"Not any more," said Blaise.
"Fuck," muttered Draco. "You really are going to be the death of me."
Harry's eyes began to prickle. It was absurd, impossible, that they should be okay with this at three in the morning, yet here they were taking it into their stride, like this was all unfortunate but perfectly normal. Like the man Harry had fallen for wasn't Draco sodding Malfoy.
. He wasn't sure he ever really had.
"What's the problem with having alcohol?" Luna asked.
." Kreacher stuck his nose up and made a little gesture with his elbows that Harry realised, with delight, was Kreacher doing a mocking impression of a wizard. "I is thinking it's not much of an ask for Kreacher to have
"I hate you," said Draco. "You're the reason my life is hell, and now you can fuck it up even more."
"For conversation," Dean clarified, and Harry could almost hear him rolling his eyes. "I mean it, Malfoy, you can't keep hiding in your room trying to pretend you don't exist, that's no way to live. Come in and read a pamphlet or something."
"Ah yes, since I'm perfectly positioned for public relations."
She held up a notebook as she spoke. It was absolutely rammed with precisely drawn flowers, like a botany book, except that amongst the plants there were a hundred different kinds of skulls.
Dean's grimace was sympathetic.
"Hang on," he murmured, setting down his coffee on the side table. "I want to watch the dawn."
know, wasn't sure what thinking someone
"Knock yourself out," he said blankly, and looked down at his food. "God, you're actually insane."
"Please, have a seat," said Adhikari, gesturing to the armchairs. Harry sat, resisting the urge to settle back into the comfortable padding. He could hear his pulse racing in his ears.
"Seamus's word for it. I don't mean it in a drugs way. I mean, when everything stops being a crisis, that's when it really hits you. That's the bit that's hard."
Harry hadn't really noticed. He pulled a pillow a little tighter to his chest, letting his book slide down to the floor. It had a little bee embroidered on the corner, rough silver and gold strands woven into the threads.
"Oh," said Malfoy faintly. Then, in a show of bravery, "Why is that?"
"Yeah. Hefting bricks, mixing cement, sawing wood, that sort of thing. It's hard work, but they won't want to check your ID or know your National Insurance number or anything."
"No, no," said Hermione. "Just because you hate each other so much, and he's so proud..."
Harry half-expected the bookshelves to rattle, so strong was the knot of rage and grief in his chest, but they didn't, and so Harry forced himself to sit in it. To let himself feel it fully, for the first time in a long time.
He sighed, and dropped the book. He wondered if he'd ever see Malfoy again.
"Not hungry?"
"Absolutely," agreed Harry, grinning at her. She rolled her eyes, but he could see she was repressing a smile.
. Malfoy was gay, and he played Quidditch like he needed it to breathe, and he was lithe and slim and he wanted to hate Harry but he didn't seem that good at it, and all those separate threads of his thoughts coalesced into something burning and terrifying, something that froze him to the spot.
"You think that's why I hate you?" said Malfoy. "You've got no idea. What was that all about,
He looked down at the picture, swallowing, and Malfoy snorted in his ear.
"Is he a nark if he nearly
"No," said Harry, smiling. "Not any more."
Dean grimaced.
Harry looked at Hermione. Hermione grimaced.
"Great, see you later," she said, and shut the door on him. Harry blinked at the door for a second, then shrugged.
possible thing we could do together, but I do have some starting points that may appeal."
"Could be worse, I suppose," he said.
Of course, not all of Draco's distraction this morning could be attributed to the fall of Slytherin.
"Yeah, like that," she said, sticking her tongue out at Dean. "I was trying to fit what I thought a pretty girl would look like."
," continued Hermione, and only then it occurred to Harry that something might be wrong. He didn't have much time to think, though, as Hermione pulled Ginny back by the hair and dived in, requiring his second dodge of the day.
Sometimes, it would flit into his chest and then drift away. Other times, it would leave him gasping, trapped in himself, until his body could no longer maintain the terror and gave way, his breathing slowing enough that he could drag himself to the comfort of the kitchen and a warm tea.
"Yeah, but do you?" he asked, trying to sound merely curious, as though it didn't eat at him. "I know you
"So, I suppose this household isn't
Malfoy hesitated, staring at Harry's outstretched hand.
"Old Muggle reference," answered Dean. "Ron said your name like, three times."
His eyes were already glazing. Hermione hexed him.
what he's hiding from, so nah mate."
He rolled back, staring at the canopy. Draco's body was warm beside him. Was this going to be weird now?
Harry had to stifle a relieved laugh.
"Of course not!" said Harry. "But it's not like you'll listen, is it? What's the point in trying?"
"What about your Weasley girlfriend? You don't like guys."
Seamus's bedroom door swung open with a thud. They all jumped.
he can stay."
All words left Harry's head. He'd said it, but he didn't know
"Snape always said you were too stupid for wordless magic," said Malfoy, staring at the wand with open envy. Harry snorted.
"It's not like that," said Harry, squirming. "I might be able to help him, that's all."
"Much to my surprise, I miss them too," said Draco, slumping against the van. "Who would have thought?"
But as soon as he asked the question, the answer was obvious. Something cold and horrible settled over Harry's chest. He abruptly wished he were sober, too.
"Yeah," he said. "Yeah, I'll do that."
But Malfoy did charm Ginny, Harry could tell. He started strong by continuing to join them at dinner, mostly silent but inexorably drawn to the safe topic that was Quidditch, and it seemed as though he and Ginny had a natural alignment of opinion. And then one night Ginny was mocking him, challenging him to a match at the Quidditch club, and Malfoy was
"Why's he not off enjoying the Riviera, anyway? Isn't that what the rest of the war criminals are doing?" said Ginny. She kicked back in her chair, arms folded.
"Don't get comfy!" he said, full of wobbling joviality. "In the spirit of inter-house co-operation, I'm splitting you all up!"
But they didn't look for what they came for, both of them content to wander a little longer. Malfoy tried to make him buy some giant boots all covered in buckles; Harry accidentally bumped into a rack of studded collars outside a very sexual-looking shop and had to pick them all up, the owner laughing at him as he helped Harry out.
She returned to the house after work that day with a handful of leaflets, a book entitled
"Bonkers." Dean shook his head. "We're all bonkers."
five minutes. The first sight of all that skin, those hands, the blond man's wandering mouth...
Harry laughed.
And then Ginny whooped and the two of them broke apart, Dean's hands falling away from Seamus's hips in slow motion, Seamus still so close that he had to arch his neck to look up at Dean.
"Well we now know for sure that it wasn't to steal you off Ron," said Seamus, and Harry retreated before he could get burned by his temptation to eavesdrop again.
"I meant don't tell anyone that – wait, deodorant?"
"Um," said Dean, shrugging. "Not much to say. You get a catalogue and you pick what you want out of it and they send it to you. And if it doesn't fit, you send it back."
"Great," he said, and after a moment the smile became genuine. "Go absolutely wild. Me eighteenth was a bit of a drab affair, now I come to think of it."
Harry didn't let go.
Luna and Ginny looked at each other, eyes sparkling, and Harry smiled through his lingering sense of unease.
Harry shivered. If he was entirely honest with himself, he didn't
"Yes, well," agreed Malfoy, "I'm sorry for that too."
Harry, laughing, decided he might as well join in, and pulled off his threadbare t-shirt to try on one of the new ones at the very moment the drawing room door swung open again.
"A ride.” Harry grinned at him.
"He was in Slytherin, naturally," said Harry, staring at Regulus's spot on the tapestry. "Strong views about Muggle-borns and magical superiority. Loved old Voldie's teachings." Malfoy didn't flinch, but his lip quirked in a cold sort of smile. "He was a Death Eater, and he got pretty far in before he realised that it wasn't all that great. Then he found out about something very important, something Voldemort wanted to keep hidden, and he knew where it was. So he tried to destroy it. He died in the attempt."
"You're very welcome.” Fish grinned at the meal they'd mostly demolished, and downed the rest of his third pint. Harry watched him, guilt still churning, and then gestured for the bill. Fish looked disappointed for a second, but then brightened.
"Would you like to play something with Harry, Teddy?" said Andromeda, and Teddy wriggled himself out of Harry's grip, nodding.
And with one surprisingly graceful movement, he'd stepped back into the Floo and away again.
"LUNA! I don't think you need to finish that sentence— "
"The world doesn't revolve around you, Malfoy," said Harry. "I was just reading."
"I was thinking how I missed breakfast and lunch," said Harry. "It's not like I wasn't careful."
Malfoy snapped out of his haunted expression to nod, slowly.
"Thank you. What do you think?" she said, holding his arm up. He was no artist, but to him, the sketch looked perfect. "It'll be more like Ellie's rose when it's done, with the shading."
"I can't believe you didn't tell me about Camden," said Harry to Luna, when she'd taken their orders and come back to lean against their table.
"I haven't taken any in the last week, have I?" said Malfoy, sounding strange.
"Merlin's fucking balls, Granger, I think I just saw God."
"Er..." said Harry. "Not... really."
Harry's door swung open too wide and hit the wall; Malfoy jumped.
that stuff?"
He strode forward, pausing for a moment to buy a silver and green dragon from the wizard in the top hat. He pretended he didn't know who he bought it for.
"It is?" squeaked Harry. Hermione gave him a smirk.
you're not a Slytherin?"
"I'd run an ad in the
lover, Pans, I'd think you were trying to set me up."
Harry just looked at him. He'd thought he'd had something to say to Draco —
Everyone gave her a long look, which she didn't notice.
The buzzing was louder now, a screen obscuring most of the tattoo parlour from view. There was a slim girl sitting behind a reception desk with skin a little lighter than Harry's and a jet-black buzzcut, every inch of her bare arms covered in tattoos. She was reading a magazine, her vast buckled boots up on the counter.
"He asked if you have a problem," said Dean, much less brightly, "With two men kissing in the privacy of their own lounge."
Harry grinned and held his hand out for Teddy. Teddy grasped it, and began to pull him up the stairs with surprising enthusiasm.
"Wait," he said. "Was Malfoy your
Harry looked at Kreacher, the little elf who'd done so much for his Masters, good and bad, and felt the seriousness of that duty.
"Oh, right, erm –
"Sorry, Harry, I've got brothers."
"Any chance you know a friend of mine? Skinny blond guy, pointy face, posh accent?"
"That's good to hear," he said. "It feels a bit like I'm permanently broken."
"The headmaster was a bit, um, unusual in his approach," he said. "Although he died in my sixth year and the administration after that was, um, much worse. I skipped my seventh year to avoid it in the end."
"Are you just planning to sit there and watch me eat?"
He got out, dried off, and attacked the robe with several rounds of
"Very nice," said Draco, eyes still narrowed. "And exceedingly handsome too. Probably in love with me. I daresay he'd ask me to marry him if I hadn't already told him I have a free spirit and cannot be tamed."
"Blaise!" said Malfoy, hopping down the last few steps and diving in for a hug. Harry, used to seeing a lot more in the way of fancy manners and reservation between Slytherins, was both surprised and irrationally annoyed.
It was getting dark when he finally sat up, empty of tears and strangely lighter. He stretched, wiping his face, then went over to the desk to tidy the letter.
And with that, he traced his tongue over the head of Malfoy's cock. Malfoy exhaled sharply. Harry grinned, and put a hand on his hip, steadying himself as he wrapped one hand around Draco and ran his tongue in a circle over the rosy flesh in front of him. Contrary to what Ron liked to believe, he had received this before, and while his eyes were closed it had been too gentle, but... good.
"Shit," Dean repeated, more firmly. Seamus reached out and squeezed his hand.
Harry snorted.
Something about seeing the House in full health made it easier for Harry to start the things he knew he had to do. He had a responsibility now, the House had expectations of him, and he was tentatively ready to accept it.
"Anhedonia," agreed Harry, who had read his pamphlets carefully. "From the withdrawal."
"What do you mean?" he croaked.

"Maybe
Harry sighed and pushed the plunger down on the cafetière, no longer caring if the coffee was ready or not. He poured them both a cup, and Malfoy pulled his close in both hands as though savouring the heat, even though the kitchen was warm. Malfoy's shoulder-length hair was drying quickly, the ends curling up in a strangely soft and endearing way that Harry had never seen before.

Maybe if the person he was with wanted it. Someone who wanted him, who trusted him… who loved him enough for that.
," said Malfoy, "I am perfectly capable of enjoying normal, earthy Muggle pursuits. I don't need to be surrounded by, by glittering chandeliers and peacocks and — "
"Um. Yes, but it's not like I didn't… well, I could have said no."
"You can't say that about Muggles, Thomas," said Malfoy, and Harry thought he sounded kind of snide rather than funny, but Dean huffed a laugh anyway.
on him.
"You can't glamour it," said Harry, confused. "You don't have a wand."
"Thanks for the advice, Mrs Weasley," said Harry. Malfoy scowled, but it softened after a moment.
Malfoy straightened up, hand over his mouth.
"Bad habit from a bad Muggle," said Draco darkly, and for a moment Blaise dropped her bland reserve to look intrigued.
"Auror training has mandatory counseling. It helps."
"Um," he said, after a moment. "You might need to give me some context for that one."
"Taking us poor down-and-outs under your wing. Does it make you feel like a big, strong man?"
"And it's nearly two," said Ron, looking at his watch. "We need to get to class soon."
because the man's eyebrows rose again.
Hermione laid a hand over his.
"I wondered if you'd ever talk to me again," said Blaise, voice light, as though it were nothing at all. Harry was beginning to think that it was just something about how Blaise spoke.
" Malfoy asked, and Harry knew rock bottom well enough to pick up the thread of self-hatred amongst the incredulity.
The trenchcoat man looked amused.
"Everybody feels like a Bubotuber at fifteen, am I right?" he said, a little loudly. "Good job we're all happy functional adults now, eh?"
"Sounds awful," he grated out, through a closing throat. Ginny looked at him for a long time, face a mix of frustration and sympathy, and Harry felt as if the walls of the kitchen were somehow far away, as though everything was far away —
"Yes," said Pansy. "It's a beautiful city, and I adore the French. Honestly, Draco, the second this dreadful probation nonsense is over you simply

Except now he was, and maybe he
Draco's shoulders slumped as the front door closed behind her. Then he turned, slow and tired.
After a while, Andromeda left them to it, and after two hours she came back upstairs to see if Harry would like some dinner.
"Naturally," said Malfoy, but then he made them all piña coladas covered in whipped cream, with big pink umbrellas he forced Ron to conjure out of cocktail sticks. Somehow, he managed to make the drinks sparkle.
"Right," said Hermione, rolling her eyes again. "Look, you've got to understand something. Ron
He turned to set the cafetière on the table, and caught Malfoy as he twisted, pretending he hadn't been watching. Harry found himself grinning.
"Potter, I cannot
He touched his necklace and blinked away the vision, angry at himself, and took a swig of his drink.
Harry flipped round to stare at him, wondering if he'd read Harry's mind, but he was looking down at a record himself.
"In what possible way?" demanded Malfoy, folding his arms.
He took a deep breath, and carried on.
"Okay," he said breathlessly, after a moment. "Okay, let's do it."
"I think I am a bit," he said. "Everything feels a bit more
And he poured himself another.
"Go on then."
"No, you haven't," said Draco. He seemed afraid.
at the bedside lamps. Draco's gaze roved around the bedroom.
"If you'd kindly refrain from being funny as well. Talk about adding insult to injury."
"No," said Harry.
"This school, unfortunately, does not have solitary confinement facilities," said McGonagall, looking amused. "But perhaps you could be given the day off. To research. Miss Granger can fetch you some relevant books and then return to her afternoon lessons. In the meantime, I suggest you stay locked in your dorm. Come to me if there are any developments, please, Miss Granger."
"Oh," she said, "I was wrong, Draco, he is a bit fun after all."
"I think Kreacher is hinting that you should say a polite goodbye," said Seamus, snatching the last piece of pizza off Harry's plate and winking at Kreacher. "Off you trot."
Malfoy looked up, swallowed, and nodded. Hermione passed him a vial.
Malfoy paced the aisles for a while, then vanished from Harry's view. He came back a moment later with a massive tome, dumped in on a table alarmingly near to Harry's, and opened it at the first page.
Harry bit down on the side of his tongue. Malfoy didn't appear to need a response to that, thankfully, because he kept talking.
"Harry," said Draco, more firmly. "If you want to try anything else tonight, you might want to stop."
"Yes?" he said.
I shouldn't have made it so personal and I did it anyway, you're completely right, I'm selfish —"
"Um," said Harry, and Malfoy started and dropped the knife.
"Like… Muggle drugs?" said Ginny looking perplexed. "What kind?"
"See you later," he said, clapping a hand on Neville's shoulder, and retreated to the bedroom.
Harry tamped down his hot flare of anger. He had the feeling that this would be the least of the story, and there would be time to murder Spider later.
"I've got my own bloody deodorising potion," growled Ron, throwing the canister onto the bed. He got up and pulled on his robes.
"You might have solved my problem as well," he said thoughtfully.
Adhikari picked up a notepad and an ordinary ballpoint pen. Harry grinned at it, shook his head.
"I just got a rare Smashing Pumpkins vinyl on trade-in," he said, turning to a box and fishing a record out of it. "You might like that. You on the rock end of things?"
They were mostly period dramas, and generally a bit steamy, probably wildly inappropriate for his age, but Harry loved the bright clothes and the dramatic tension, characters lounging about with open shirts and heaving bosoms, intense stares and almost-kisses that made him feel funny, and sometimes there were even pirates. They were good memories, ones that had made the rest of his sorry childhood a little more tolerable.
"Very well," said Hermione. "Any objection to a daily cast?"
Harry could hear the noise of the common room as he travelled down the stairs. He tried to stop, but Hermione tightened her grip.
Then his whole body seemed to light up.
"Not the pasta, idiot," he said, still glaring at it. "
"Did you not hear me? I let some shitty little Muggle criminal
Harry became even more convinced that Malfoy had taken Blaise's advice to heart when he went out to the garden the next day and found Malfoy kneeling in the dirt next to Neville, both of them carefully inspecting the potions garden. Neville's body was a tense line and Malfoy's face looked pinched with fear, but Harry watched as the two of them carefully unearthed and separated a plant from the unruly patch.
Luna helped him erect new wards and figure out how to re-cast the Fidelius Charm, with Harry as the Secret-Keeper. They read books about it at the kitchen table, a long discussion about phrasing and intentionality; he wasn't sure if he could call Grimmauld
"Forgive me," said Malfoy, with a little bow to her. "Obviously I was deliberately excluding you as you are far too smart to fall for such a trick."
Malfoy's eyes flashed with something bright. Harry thought it might have been hope.
"And you're living in Paris?" asked Harry, wanting to bite his own tongue at the awkward way the words tumbled out of his mouth.
"So," he said, trying to think of something he could say that would make it clear that he was totally, completely fine. "Do you think it'll go any further?"
Harry's thoughts went fuzzy, every part of his body attuned to the man now working his cock with messy, wet enthusiasm. He could feel his blood pounding, impossibly hard, balls drawing up already and it was too soon, he couldn't finish, he wanted to feel this forever. He pulled at Draco's hair, and Draco looked up at him with such a face of beautiful concern that he couldn't help himself from tugging him up for another kiss.
"Hey!" Harry protested, resisting the absurd urge to cover himself. "It's... possible it's not related..."
She grimaced.
Pansy's first drink was finished before she even touched the soup. Harry sipped at his, painfully aware of the pin-drop silence. As though sensing a dinner party in need of rescue, Kreacher swiftly switched the aperitifs for wine; Pansy snatched up a bottle of red before it could begin to pour itself. She tipped almost half of it into her glass. The complete abandonment of manners made Harry warm to her a little.
"Can't have that," said Harry, and let her loop her arm through his. She led him down the stairs, guiding him over a 'No Entry' sign that someone had wisely strung up on the first floor.
I'm not ready, I'm barely older than a seventh-year — and there's a fascinating study opportunity at Kew Gardens… Of course, I'll pay whatever the rent is."
"Why flowers?" Harry asked Shev, then winced. He didn't know if conversation was distracting.
, but weird.
"What? No… it can't have been! Are you sure?"
"There's a test."
"Well," said Harry, "I'm not really sure. Obviously I have to talk to Malfoy again, but he just thinks I'm on some weird power trip, and he really hates me... but then again, he
"Harry Potter, Plumbing Wizard," said Ron, although he had an odd expression on his face.
Dean and Seamus both raised their eyebrows at each other. Harry hadn't even thought to take it like that —
Harry let the hand on Malfoy's arm drop.
Harry took a deep breath, resisted the urge to gently bite that smirk off Draco's face, and went to sit back down next to Ron. He carefully avoided Hermione's eye.
"Why?" he asked.
Malfoy sighed. "Yes, thank you. Food and sleep are excellent restoratives, whoever would have known."
"I hate you," he snarled, but he did not move.
want to give it away," said Harry, voice a little harder now, "You could give it to the War Orphans Fund."
"You can't grow flowers on poisoned ground," muttered Malfoy, and turned his face away from the drawing, startled when he noticed this brought him closer to Harry.
"Face off with any Dark Lords?" said Harry, unable to help himself.
"You're incredible," murmured Harry, voice low. Draco's expression clouded.
me but this is… restful."
"So what clued you in?" said Ginny. Harry thought restlessly of Malfoy working a hand into his jeans pocket, and bit the inside of his mouth.
"I didn't say I didn't want to. I said I didn't
Malfoy huffed a laugh.

Malfoy raised his eyebrows.

"Oh, it's so shiny!" exclaimed Ginny, from behind the screen.

good. He thinks there's a risk you'll be Head Auror one day."
"But," said Harry, still grinning, "You've never called me Harry before that. Seems a bit chummy, for someone you profess to hate?"
"I'm just – I'm
"I live in a magical mansion in central London," said Harry dryly. "Let me buy you the stupid chunky trainers at least."
It seemed to be a day for interrupting kisses, because he got an eyeful the second he walked into the dorm. After they day he'd had, though, it didn't feel like much could shock him.

"Kreacher is an old elf," he said. "I is not interested in living like a wizard, making
In the end, his self-consciousness lost against an old spark of competition with Malfoy.
"Thank you," said Luna brightly, as everyone else stared, wondering if she'd somehow managed a silent Imperius.
Harry stared at Malfoy, all worry lines and bright silver eyes, and took a slower breath. Another. His chest hurt like he'd been running. He closed his eyes and focused, counting. Forcing himself to breathe normally.
"Hermione may have a potion," Malfoy suggested. "Shall I find out?"
amount of touching, what constituted friendship and what constituted flirting. Ginny and Cho had one thing in common, and that was disinterest in being subtle; he knew where he stood, and if he wasn't sure then Ron would be there to give him a little kick. On the friendship side, he was touchy with Ron and Hermione, but he wasn't sure if their friendship was particularly normal, given what they'd been through together. They felt more like a kind of surrogate family to him, unquestionably bound.
He scurried away from his girlfriend's disapproving gaze.
less slow."
Dean laughed and gave him a shove on the shoulder.
"It's fun," he said. "I mean that. But it's not a forever plan."
Pansy Parkinson did not decline Harry's invitation. The next week, Harry found himself — wearing a shirt, inexplicably — opening the door to welcome her in for dinner.
"Well, he told me a lot of things. I knew he had a temper, but whenever he snapped at me he was always so
he fancy you?"
"This won't be forever," said Harry, half to himself, playing with his necklace. "Grimmauld will run out of things to fix, everyone will settle down and move out. Life will have to change again. Just give me this time, yeah?"
"And what's that?"
"That seems reasonable," said Ron, shrugging. "We do have the rest of our lives ahead of us."
Harry might be generally oblivious, but he
Over the next week, new and better clothes seemed to enter Malfoy's wardrobe, all staunchly Muggle, nothing obviously expensive, but better-fitting. He had jeans that didn't look like he'd borrowed them, now, and shirts that he left open to show a flash of the silvery scar across his chest. He watched as Malfoy began to fill them out better, as the labouring and the Quidditch and the walking and the good food made him look stronger, healthier. Even his hair seemed to gleam again, long and soft and tied back with Luna's embroidery thread. He looked good.
"Oh my god I'm so sorry!" said Hermione, hands over her face.
Draco went rigid. Harry wanted to kick himself, what was he thinking, he was so
think that I've committed credit card fraud."
When they left the bathroom, the door was shut, and Hermione was nowhere to be seen. Malfoy, eagle-eyed now that the alcohol had gone, immediately went to poke at the printer.
Neville, to Harry's immense affection, looked disarmingly embarrassed. He adjusted his cardigan self-consciously.
"We could get a catalogue," said Dean. Ginny elbowed him, and Hermione sighed.
Harry realised that, for reasons unknown to him, he had intended to do just that.
"Is it plum pudding?" asked Draco.
Dean and Seamus came over for lunch the next week to say hello to everyone, and then didn't leave.
you," said Malfoy, looking Dean in the eye. Dean shrugged, uncomfortable.
Neville raised his eyebrows. "Come live at Harry Potter's central London mansion and make him hangover potions? You'd be overrun."
"Right," said Harry, annoyed and flustered and confused at himself. "Right."
Malfoy was pressing his hips closer, and Harry felt lightheaded and really this ought to stop...
"Ah," said Luna, apparently oblivious to the tension. "Yes. I suppose it ties in with what you said about Bubotubers. It's hard to feel safe while your lover is with someone else if you don't feel like you deserve them in the first place."
"Potter," said Malfoy, sinking into the chair. "Are you really about to make me pancakes?"
"Seamus, oh my
"The '93 final was an absolute crime," interjected Malfoy. "The referee was crooked, I'm convinced of it, that's the only way he wouldn't call foul on Drummond —"
"No," said Ginny. "It better not be who I think it is. No way."
"I… think we might prefer to go out," he said, taut. "On balance, probably the best plan. Although we appreciate the hospitality."
"See? There's something wrong with him," he heard Malfoy say as he left, and Harry resisted the urge to push his nails into his palms hard enough to bleed. He couldn't imagine why he'd ever thought things might be okay between him and that slimy blond git.
They poured their coffees together, Harry fighting to resist his urge to keep touching Draco, to keep exploring the angles and curves of all that smooth skin. Draco dragged him up the kitchen stairs before they could get any more involved in the kitchen, but Harry stopped him on the landing. Paused to bite one pale shoulder.
Until Hermione made a few pointed comments about Ginny. Harry tried his best not to think about it.
Harry nodded. "It hasn't been long. But I went to Diagon Alley the other day. Which reminds me, I have a present for you too. I haven't wrapped it, and it's not as good as yours, but — "
"It's the Gryffindor girls that are
"Pig," corrected Ginny, sticking her tongue out at Ron, who stuck his fingers up in return.
"It's not being
Draco gave him a long, slow look up and down. Swallowed.
A long pause.
He stopped a few feet in front of Blaise, mouth opening on a rant, but was somewhat distracted by the fact that Blaise was wearing lipstick, and Blaise's snappy robe was in fact a dress, chic and black and figure-hugging. Harry was fairly certain that this was a new development.
"So I'm on a waiting list for housing," continued Fish with a casual wave of his drink, "Floating about between staying with mates and such, trying to avoid the hostel cos they're right Nazis about the drinking. And I'm hanging out in the park near the pub one evening when I see Draco puking his guts up. I've been around a bit and reckon he's coming down off something so I ask if he wants a hospital and he says no, he's fine. I ask if he wants the number of the place that keeps trying to get me to quit the drink, and he says he's not an addict."
"I know, Potter," snapped Draco, looking wild and undone against the wall.
most of it, then why are you here?"
Draco snarled and shoved him into the wall.
Harry nodded. They shared a long look, Malfoy's lip quirking, Harry breaking into an infectious grin.
"Good. Annoying you is my
"Naturally," Harry agreed. Then he pounced, hands moving to either side of Draco's head, grinding his hips and lowering his mouth. It felt like being drunk, dizzy with the knowledge that he was allowed to do this, he could do this and so much more. His imagination spun, full of the things he wanted to feel, the ways he wanted Draco to moan, the acts they could try.
Harry relaxed back into his chair, staring at the bare red-brick wall of the chimney breast. It wasn't
"I'd like that too," said Harry.
Draco smirked.
Fish’s eyes narrowed. "How badly?"
Malfoy found him in the kitchen the next morning, absent-mindedly gazing at his raw, shiny tattoo.
"You could
would be about a foot taller than Harry when he stood up, grinned at him.
"Dance, Draco," said Luna, and Harry realised that he, himself, was just standing there watching, no longer even pretending to dance. Terry, in front of him, didn't seem to mind, throwing his hands out to the rhythm with his eyes closed and a grin on his face.
"Um," said Malfoy, looking at him with bright eyes. "This
The next morning he found Kreacher in the kitchen scrubbing at the surface of the table, as though neither of them had ever left.
"No problem, Harry," she murmured, and they sat there for a few minutes more.
"Okay getting home?" he asked. Hermione snorted.
Harry stared at the shuttered windows. He could see slivers of the street outside — people striding past in suits, a couple walking their dog, a delivery driver on a moped.
"Honestly, Harry, did no-one ever teach you not to eavesdrop?" she said.
Harry hadn't heard Draco say anything like that before.

"Yeah," said Harry. "Right. Well… give me a shout if you need anything."
"Alright, I'll get it sent to mum's. Although she
worse.
"I do," admitted Harry, the confession tearing out of his mouth and leaving behind it a ringing silence, Draco's face softer in shock, and Harry still couldn't help himself.
Harry scowled.
, I tell you," said Malfoy in his normal voice, looking glittering and smug as Harry tried to muffle his laughter behind his hands.
"Excellent, good, well, wasn't this a great talk," said Malfoy, poking at his bowl.
"Are you being kept here against your will?" Blaise asked, sounding no more than mildly curious.
"He's desperate," said Harry, shifting uncomfortably.
"I think it is," said Harry dully, pressing his face between Hermione's arm and the pillow. "That'll be why he's leaving."
Then Draco launched into a jaunty rendition of Three Blind Mice himself, and everyone in the room laughed, and Harry abruptly became aware that the entire time they'd been at the piano they were being watched.
"Look, I don't know who came up with it or how, but I know it works, so you'll just have to trust me. If you don't play with the right fingers on the right keys, you'll end up with your fingers all in a knot and you won't be able to reach the next note in time."
"Have at it," he said. Malfoy pulled a surprisingly reticent face for someone so skinny. He dragged a tub of egg-fried rice toward him and stuck a spoon in it, swallowing each mouthful quickly with his head down. It reminded Harry of his first feast at Hogwarts, where despite it all he hadn't been able to shake the feeling he would have his plate snatched off him.
" Harry breathed. "I bloody
Harry opened his mouth and arched, head turning as the hand in Harry's hair pulled too tight, and Harry fought back with tongue and teeth and nails digging into Malfoy's sides. Malfoy was more controlled this time, more precise, tongue flickering over the inside of his mouth without giving Harry a second to breathe. Harry groaned, hips moving involuntarily, and Malfoy gasped and pressed back, grinding with almost painful pressure. And Harry wanted
"Me too," said Draco, who was beginning to look panicky. "Let's go with that."
Harry nodded, and when Ron was gone he curled around the bee pillow and stared, vacantly, at the front cover of
"You're welcome to borrow my set, Draco," offered Hermione.
articles in her favourite armchair, and the scent of chamomile tea. Then Ron and Hermione fell out, loudly, over how much time they were going to spend with the Grangers at Christmas. Ginny was unusually quiet, visibly missing Luna herself. Harry, meanwhile, wrestled silently with the challenge of buying Christmas presents and decorations by owl-order rather than venturing out, aware that if he complained he would get another lecture on leaving the house. But then Ron, Hermione and Ginny gave him their gifts in the kitchen on Christmas morning, and it was lovely — a book on House Magic from Hermione, a bottle of goblin mead and a very large box of Chocolate Frogs from Ron, and a Calming Ccharm inexplicably in the form of a necklace from Ginny. It was not a particularly
"Yeah, but
"You can't make people change," she muttered, perfectly audibly, then grinned at him. "You know where I am if you need me."
Harry nearly jumped. Malfoy stood in the doorway, in a too-big jumper and jeans, looking unsure and a little grey. His limbs seemed so fragile, skin stretched too thin over fine bones.
Harry tried not to feel too triumphant. Draco might not know exactly what he wanted, but he wasn't about to go running after Pansy the second the opportunity arose.
"Alright," he said warily.
Harry pulled a face.
It was strange to exit the shop, like leaving a dream world. Harry was assaulted by the smell of the street food and the sounds of the crowd, the glare of the afternoon sun. He wanted to move closer to Malfoy — absurdly, as though Malfoy represented some kind of safety.
"Fuck," hissed Malfoy. "Potter, what— " he looked between Harry's bleary-eyed face and his bare chest for a moment, swallowed, and then whispered: "Potter, you better tell me you have a house-elf, or else I don't think much of your sense of humour."
kind of mark.
"Not for the reasons you think," said Harry darkly, and Hermione's eyes widened.
"Yes!" said Ginny, ripping into a plastic bag and pulling out her silk-and-string dress. "Right, nobody look!"
"I don't know if it's obvious," said Neville, who'd been silent up until this point, "But I also say no. I've come too far to

"Where now?" he said.

Seamus obviously caught something of the tension in the room, because he looked between them. A slow smirk crept over his friendly face.
Dean wiped his eyes and sat up on his bed.
Fish shrugged, a smile tugging at one corner of his lips.
"And of course there's this incredible bias towards Western magic in this country. Did you know that there are indigenous tribes across the world who practice magic without wands, but Western wizards went in and insisted they weren't doing it right, and wouldn't let Indigenous students study at the schools that white wizards set up in their own damn lands unless they bought a wand and learned spells in Latin? And don't even get me started on the Statute of Secrecy, it's completely at odds with the way other cultures integrated non-magical societies with magical ones… it's ethnocentric, and enforcement literally divided communities."
"You would say that," said Seamus, still muffled. "Don't take sartorial advice from Dean, Harry, he has many fine qualities but fashion sense is not one of them."
Seamus lost it. Throwing himself back on his beanbag, gasping through bales of laughter, he cried, "I'm sorry — Harry — I really shouldn't — but Merlin that is the grossest — thing — I have ever — "
"Got shoes in an eight?" asked a young man with two missing front teeth, strolling up to the box and giving it a kick.
"Wonderful," said Hermione. "I think I'll be ready to submit my thesis a lot sooner than I thought."
Harry
Malfoy didn't come back until late again. Harry tried very hard not to be annoyed about it. Malfoy was probably looking for jobs, or complying with Hermione's wishes and out talking to a Mind Healer, which grated on Harry for reasons he could admit to himself were ridiculous. And he didn't know how often he had to check in with his probation officer — Harry was only vaguely aware of what a probation officer even did.
"Nah," said Dean. "It's fine. Let's get this over with. Kitchen?"
The weather turned dark and icy, so Harry couldn't walk as much as he used to. He listened to the records they'd bought in Camden on a loop, regret dragging on him with every bittersweet note. He cleaned everything in the house. He sat in the drawing room every evening, resting against the reassuring warmth of Hermione or Ginny or Ron, saying little. In the daytime, when everyone was out, he wandered the city, or went to the church to help with the soup run, mindlessly chopping vegetables until his fingers went wrinkly.
"What's next to do in the house, Harry?" asked Hermione over-brightly, settling in beside him.
She added a leaf, and then another, then began to sketch a bulb — she hadn't asked him any more questions about the art, which was good, because he really didn't know. He watched as she outlined a half-open lily, gently curving up his forearm with the tip of it pointing to his wrist. It seemed appropriate to Harry that it would be forever half-open. The real Lily had barely started her life.
And, because he was nothing if not impulsive, he strode into the shop.

"It's not about
"Then what on earth did?"
"You look a lot fuckin' better," said Fish, giving him an exaggerated look up and down.
"Yes, well, glad I could help, but you're rearranging the beans in an unwelcome manner," he said, looking at Harry's position beside him.
"I hope you're going to be careful," she said, dumping the pile in his lap, and went upstairs to find Ron.
"Well then," said Harry. "Might as well say yes to a warm bed."
" said Hermione primly. Everyone clutched their nose.
"Kreacher let you carry the tray up?" he said. "He must be feeling his age."
"And House owns you too." He waved a spindly finger at Harry. "You have
"I'll take the hit," said Dean, glancing sadly at Seamus. Seamus was glaring resentfully at the clock as it counted down the minutes to his night shift.
"And I hate that you always do the right thing, and I hate that fame and glory hasn't even had the decency to go to your head, and I hate that you're actually funny, and actually smart, and that you're kind without having to try, and you're good at things, and you're unfairly blessed in the looks department —"
Maybe even turned on. But it just felt… kind of nice, and the ache in his chest was more jealousy because they had people to kiss, than a desire to have Ginny be
"Would you like some tea, sir?"
"It's pretty bad," agreed Harry. "You a regular?"
Dean, to Harry's annoyance, laughed at this.
"Um," said Hermione gently, "Yes, well I don't think Harry needs to hear that part of it —"
"Happy to join the unremarkable and kind of gross club," said Harry, winking at Dean. "It's probably true."
Harry raised his eyebrows. Malfoy didn't say anything else; didn't react at all. He looked exactly as awful as Hermione had said. He was starkly skinny, pale skin looking paper-thin and eyes red-rimmed. A yellow bruise ran across one cheekbone, and Harry thought he could see the ghost of another mark on his neck. He was visibly shivering in his too-big coat, despite the warm summer night, and his hair was long and limp over his eyes.
Harry hadn't spoken to Xenophilius Lovegood since the man had called the Death Eaters on them. He wasn't harbouring any grudges, but the awkwardness alone was enough to put him off.
Harry slid away as little as he could reasonably slide, and laughed again as Malfoy made a great show of getting into position, flicking an invisible tailcoat, flourishing his wrists. He took an age to bring his hands down to the keys, face solemn, nose held high, and Harry found himself staring at those long fingers, imagining what they were about to play. Imagining what they'd feel like to play
? You're not even gloating. Merlin,
"A bit of the last one," said Harry, still grinning. "Maybe a bit of the second one, too, I guess I don't know what I don't know. But mostly I said it because I'm a Gryffindor, and we love rushing into adventure."
"I - I don't know what I want. Malfoy..."
places…?" said Ron. He avoided Harry's eye, picking up
Behind him, Sirius's bedroom door popped open. Harry smiled, and took the hint to explore.
Though Harry still felt twitchy and frustrated with himself, the conversation flowed past his involuntary hostility. Malfoy seemed to be on form, trying to prove something — he was all smooth manners and plummy anecdotes about the Slytherin common room or his nights out with Blaise, play-acting the rich cad. Everyone seemed to find it hilarious, and Harry realised with a deep self-disgust that he was
"Can I see it?" said Malfoy quietly, nodding at Harry's arm. Harry held it up. Malfoy lifted Harry's wrist and drew it gently towards his face.
"Well, think about it," he said. "They keep their noses in books all the time... can't all be textbooks, can it? And they're so tightly wound... when they let go they must be wicked kinky."
Harry closed his eyes and tried to think of someone naked in his bed. He'd barely seen anyone naked — Ginny, once, pure and pale, arching up against his shaking palm — but it felt wrong to think of her now. He thought of the people in the dirty wizard mag they'd passed around the dorm, girls with fake smiles and the men not smiling at all, and they all had figures like Oliver Wood but oily. They didn't make him
"Don't worry, I'm not freaking out this time," he drawled. "Just having a moment."
Perhaps a dry party wouldn't be so bad.
"When I first met Spider," he said evenly, "It was like seeing hope again."
," he drawled, a word Harry would never have imagined emerging from Malfoy's mouth. "Sounds delightful. Can I sleep now?"
. I want to make sure we all fit in."
so much.
Malfoy looked around at them with an almost awed expression, like he couldn't quite believe they would put themselves out on his account. Harry liked it, liked the way it made his mouth curve and his eyes catch the light of the gilt candelabras, turning silver into gold.
"He's just a person," said Ron. "Sat here in our drawing room, doing normal person stuff. He seems sorry. He probably won't do anything like it again. I'm not trusting him or anything, but it seems a bit ridiculous to wander around ostentatiously hating him, you know?"
More seemed to lift off him as they spoke, one of those weights he only noticed when it was gone. He wasn't, in fact, a freak. He wasn't substantially more broken than anyone else would be, had they been through what he went through. He just had a few issues, and he would fix them bit by bit, just like he fixed Grimmauld Place.
"So many reasons," said Harry, sighing. He watched a plastic bag as it drifted across their path, an eddying ghost. "All those expectations. Everyone's opinions. The complete lack of boundaries. The photographers, the hungry journalists. And sometimes — sometimes people are angry at me. For not killing him faster. For not saving someone they loved."
He sprayed his underarms liberally. He sniffed; it was strange, but he couldn't smell anything. Harry remembered Dudley had some truly awful stuff you could smell all through the house – maybe his wasn't working?
at some point when they were young, but he got the strong impression that she didn't want to talk about it, or at least — she didn't want to talk about it in the wizarding world.
"Ever the conversationalist, I see."
"Doesn't need electricity, naturally," said Draco, leaning against the wall and looking down at Harry. "I fished it out of a skip and fixed it, in case you were worried about the extravagance. I probably shouldn't have told you that, Merlin if my mother could hear me now, no manners left at all —"
one," agreed Malfoy.
"She wasn't very specific. I, er... I had a bit of..."
"Given that I have no money or resources to buy my own food at this present moment, Potter, it doesn't feel like I have much of a choice."
In the end, however, it wasn't so bad. On the day of the party Ginny decided to take the lead, and sent him and Ron to make sandwiches and vol-au-vents in the kitchen with Kreacher. Kreacher was almost beside himself with excitement at the idea of hosting, so much so that he barely complained at all about their assistance with the cooking, and Ron kept Harry distracted with idle speculations about who might be shagging who in the Aurors. Harry was
"God no," said Harry.
"What a shame," Seamus added, also grinning.
And Harry knew what she meant, he agreed, even if a part of him would always want what he thought he would have with her — marriage, children, a
Malfoy picked up his lamp and swept into the stacks, ignoring Harry's stare. Harry watched him blankly. Malfoy was going to show him
"You're joking," he said. "Surely Potter would have — I mean — no, I really don't have a problem, excuse me, sorry for disturbing you —"
It was two in the morning when Harry finally heard them; he padded up the stairs on quiet feet. The first thing he spotted was the red of Pansy's eyes, the smudge of mascara underneath — but her hands were wrapped tight around Draco's neck, and Draco was stroking her dark hair and murmuring something soft. Harry's stomach turned to knots for what felt like the hundredth time.
Malfoy snorted.
in the war."
Harry bit gently at Draco's lower lip.
He wanted more. He almost wanted to go and find a record shop right this second. Malfoy's face of discovery, his occasional awed commentary — it was good. He hadn't expected to feel anything at all today, but now he was feeling good.
"Come on," said Malfoy, "Let's go check out the giant shoe."
Malfoy looked bemused, as though laughing at that was strange.
"You picked it out at the shop, Weasley."
"Yeah, in your dreams, Malfoy. We've all heard the rumours about
"Right," said Malfoy. "He was family to you too, wasn't he?"
"Not with Ginny," he said, looking up at him from against his chest. "It'd make her miserable."
"You take that back."
"No problem," said Dean. "See you around."
Harry's birthday fell on a Friday, and the household persuaded him it was customary to spend your eighteenth getting embarrassingly drunk in a pub. In the end, he owled Neville to ask if he was being similarly badgered and if he'd like to join forces. Neville scouted out a Muggle pub to book, and Harry handled the payment.
A long pause. Harry didn't say anything, but he knew he didn't need to.
Harry stared at him, a slightly hysterical giggle forming in the back of his throat.
he would be leaving the criminal life, I asked him if he could stop having people over late at night, I told him how much I hated him smoking in every room in the house… we'd shout. I'd shout at him. I wasn't
"Of course I would," said Malfoy. "It's not like we were the best of friends in school —"
Harry lurked in the kitchen with Seamus, fighting over the pizza and arguing over whether spelling the kettle to explode in glitter was hilarious or deadly, with both of them switching sides half-way through. After what felt like hours, Kreacher appeared, looking cheerful to have had Slytherins to serve, and told him that Zabini was on her way out.

"You mean... Malfoy was affected by the deodorant? Oh, Harry, poor you... it must have been dreadful!"
of living in fear, I don't want to live like that any more —"
"You don't know what interests me, Malfoy," said Harry. Malfoy stopped dead; a stranger slammed into him, cursing, and Harry pulled Malfoy back into motion, dragging him up some stone steps and onto the main road.
Adhikari gave Harry a gentle smile.
"Aren't you going to wait?" said Harry.
Harry snorted. "Come on," he said, and started up the steps, but Malfoy's arm was rigid in his.
"Hey," said the guy, leaning forward a little, eyes flicking from Harry's chest up to his eyes. "Is that your boyfriend?"
Harry's stomach flipped. There had
"You were back early. You should have knocked," said Harry, grinning.
"The next time," Malfoy continued, his voice a cut-glass drawl, "She asked me how I was doing and I said 'Well, thank you, and how are you?' and then immediately wanted to curl up and die of embarrassment. But she laughed at me, which didn't strike me as terribly professional, and I told her so. So then she apologised insincerely on purpose, and I laughed even though I didn't want to, and realised I'd found the right sort of Mind Healer for me. To answer your question, Potter, yes it helps. It took time, and it's not easy, but it helps."
"What, that I hate Malfoy? I don't really. I mean he can be annoying and everything, but he helped us out in the war and I think I do like him a bit, that's why I went to his hearing –"
"I thought about wrapping it, but it's an awkward shape and I ran out of time."
"What do I do?" said Harry, staring round at everyone. "Do I just leave him to it?"
"Pretty much," said Harry dryly. "I think I've had an epiphany."
"Oh. Good. Can I have a word, then?"
"You know," Harry observed, "You're not the only one who knows about houses now. We could work on it together."
"Yes, I've basically recreated Gryffindor tower," Harry agreed, wry. Draco snorted.
not to be annoyed, but it prickled across his skin. It was like Neville had said — like a snake in the house, silent and vaguely threatening, and Harry couldn't even hear Malfoy speaking through the walls.

"I can see that," said the guy, raising an eyebrow at his top.
Malfoy stuck his hand into the shelf and brought out a small paperback. He flicked through it, opened it at a particular page and handed it over.

"Oh, whatever, Mr 'Screw You, Professor', you hardly helped."
Fish tapped the side of his nose, grinning.
"No problem, Harry," he said. "Sorry to miss you at the graduation ceremony, by the way. Hermione told me you were wicked sick. Feel better now?"
"Can I see?" asked Luna. She put her head around the screen. "Oh, wow."
He pulled himself off the floor and dusted the knees off his jeans.
The food helped. He never usually wanted it, but it always helped.
bad, because when Dudley repeated them in the street in front of Aunt Petunia he'd had very rare, very urgent scolding, Petunia looking fearfully up and down to see if anyone heard.
"Sometimes I wonder if I should have followed your lead with this Auror business," said Ron, staring at the ceiling.
"Notes can have different names. B is C flat and F is E sharp, and that's how it goes. Take it up with music history."
Ginny popped up from behind the sofa.
"I trust you," he said, and he was almost tempted to laugh. Adhikari was a bit intense, nothing like the sarcastic Healer Draco had described, and he found it strangely appealing. It felt like he couldn't upset her. Like he couldn't make her feel sorry for him, even if he tried. It was much nicer than the idea he'd had in his head, a teary-eyed therapist asking him to talk about his feelings.
"Oh," said Shev, face going soft. "I'm sorry. I'll do her justice, I promise."
"Yeah, alright," said Harry, leaning forward to yank his drink towards him on the coffee table. "I know what a catalogue
"Harry!" said Ron. "Nice ankles!"
"Did you pick going-out clothes?" asked Ginny.
"I like your piercing," he added, and would have died of embarrassment if the man hadn't looked thrilled.
"Um," Draco repeated, eyes flicking between Dean and somewhere around the region of Harry's belly button. "Yes. Right."
," said Harry. "I don't care what you think, I
Harry's eyes prickled. It felt like too much, too much to bear — but then again, for the past few years he'd not been able to bear it at all, not been able to think about it, pushed it far away from him, into the outside world. So maybe feeling what he felt now was good.
"Alright there, Malfoy?" asked Seamus, grinning.
the Black family rolling in their graves; it forced a smile out of him, involuntary.
He did not know what strength of will made him push Malfoy away, but he did, and yelled "
to realise what was going on."
"Thank you," said Harry, pulling himself to his feet. "For the tea. I'm so sorry I haven't done more —"
"I'm sure old MacDonald would be delighted to have you," offered Ginny, messing up on purpose to make the Muggle-borns wince.
"I've seen
"Lead any armies into battle?" said Seamus.
Harry was annoyed at himself for not thinking to offer.
"Ha," said Malfoy, but he pulled himself up straighter and flung a casual hand over his broom, which jumped obediently into his hand.
"Mostly the old guard," said Ron, after a beat. "Dunno if you heard that Ashmead ran off to the continent during the war and they replaced her with Romeo Jones, who isn't my
'Yeah," said Ron. "Him and Ritchie are like, quietly inseparable, apparently. I think he's worried that Jack knowing he's gay is going to ruin their relationship."
There was a moment where the silence hung thick. Harry found himself staring at the place where Dean's hand rested in Seamus's hair, suddenly still.
"Right," he said. "Yes. Of course. You're an adult. And you're not my prisoner. Or my ward."
"I think he gets posher the more uncomfortable he is," Harry noted. Dean smirked.
"Alright," said Neville, eyeing the cauldron like he had every intention of overfilling it himself. "Deal."
"Besides," he said, voice low, trying to pretend he wasn't enjoying the wide-eyed way Malfoy was staring at him. "You can't honestly think
"Um," said Harry. "Before I leave you alone, a couple of ground rules."
Malfoy nodded slowly.
He pulled Pansy towards the dining room door, one arm in hers, Harry trailing behind like a puppy.
"Oh. You know. It was your idea," he said. Harry tilted his head, uncomprehending.
It said '24h'.
Harry pulled a face at the comparison. Kreacher gave him a long look down his nose.
Harry didn't remember that, either. So much of school seemed to be a blur now.
"Maybe it was a coincidence?" he heard Ginny saying, as he padded down the kitchen stairs.
"No," said Neville. "Not on my watch, thanks. Remorse is one thing, but punishing yourself is the coward's way out. Find a way to deal with it and be better, Malfoy, or you'll become all nasty and twisted with it, and that'd be a waste of everyone's time."
"Well, subtlety has never been her style."
"He bought me things. He took me out. He made me laugh. People started knowing me by name just for being around him, saying hi, being friendly. I knew he sold drugs, but he told me he had an honour code. He told me that he wanted to get out of the business eventually. You probably think I'm an idiot."
Harry turned, trying to force his frozen face into something normal.
Everyone nodded in firm agreement that it was lovely, and then the room lapsed into silence once more.
Harry sighed, hand wrapping around his Calming Charm. His head felt a bit fuzzy with drink. The bathroom lights haloed above them, blurry, as though his glasses were smudged.
"Rude," said Ron, grinning.
"Wow," Harry heard her say. "You really do look great, if I say so myself."
"You'd better not be changing your –"

," said Malfoy dubiously.
I want it out of my body, I want it to stop, I want my mind back again —"
"Not a clue," lied Harry, not very well, but McGonagall seemed content to let it pass.
Harry couldn't shake the feeling that he was seeing the relationships evolve from a distance, like an alien trying to learn human customs. Or a child at the window of a toy shop, nose pressed against the glass. He'd had such a rigid idea about love, as though it were something abstract and untouchable, like his parents' love. Watching his friends, he was beginning to realise there was something profoundly mundane about it, profoundly tangible, like the touch of Dean's hand on Seamus's shoulder, the cup of tea that was always waiting for Ginny after Quidditch.
"Wow, what did you
Harry studied Malfoy, still a little too skinny and pale and pointy but perfect even so, reading a laundry list of Harry's supposed virtues, and felt his stomach quiver, his limbs go hot. He looked at Malfoy's mouth, taut and down-turned. He looked at Malfoy's eyes, widening now, pupils blowing out as he trailed off under the force of Harry's stare.
"No, of course not, why would you? You've got plenty on me and my family, you don't need anything else. My life is in your hands, I get it. Just don't expect me not to hate you."
Harry led Malfoy up the stairs; Malfoy followed quietly. At the first landing, he froze at the sounds of merriment in the drawing room, but Harry ignored it and led the winding way up to the third floor.
"Not so far," said Harry. "Although he did call me a
A great, black pit opened up in his chest.
"Allow me," he said, pulling his own wand out of the waistband of his pyjamas. "I'm still not used to having it back yet."
He held the bag out to Harry. Harry took it, peering inside; on top of a stack of CD cases sat a round, silver plastic CD player. Every available inch of plastic was absolutely covered in tiny runes, drawn on in black felt tip.
And then his composure cracked, and they were all laughing until they couldn't laugh any more.
With a resonating crack, the soup tureen appeared upon the table, and a hovering ladle began to dispense tomato consomme into their bowls. Harry sighed, relieved that they now had something to do rather than avoid each other's eyes.
Draco accompanied this with a casual shrug, an elegant toss of his hair. Harry didn't know how one person could make him
Harry barely saw Malfoy until the next weekend — his building firm secured some big construction job in the City, and Malfoy was tired or absent every evening. Harry tried not to think about him — about the hot stab of rage he felt whenever he thought about what had happened to him. By Saturday night, Harry had got a handle on his desire to curse Spider and damn the consequences, and Malfoy was finally at dinner. He was blasé as ever, dramatically waving a forkful of sausage at Seamus as he insisted that yes, he absolutely had seen Hooch kissing Sprout in the greenhouses in second year and everyone had been very cruel and unkind to disbelieve him just because he'd lied about Snape and McGonagall the week before.
"Blaise is joining the Unspeakables," she said. "We spoke on that recruitment day."
Harry pretended to himself that he wasn't going to follow, right up until he was at the door. Ron appeared beside him, surprisingly alert at his elbow.
ex-student of my boarding school? Did you know he encouraged me to write
Draco snorted.
"George sent us prank deodorant that attracts women!" said Ron quickly, saving Harry from a potential hexing. "Harry didn't know."
"Hermione thinks I need... self-reflection," he said. Malfoy gave him a long, strange look.
Hermione gave Harry a look over the soup ladle.
"Oh, alright," she said, winking. "I'll allow it."
Draco held out his hand and the little dragon pushed off and into the air, flying circles around his outstretched palm. Harry couldn't read his expression.
"I actually can't think of a reason why not. I mean, there's no weird revenge ritual or humiliation you could put me through that would scratch the surface at this point. I'm not even entirely sure I can feel
"Harry," she said huskily, and dived for him. Feeling a little put-upon, he allowed her rather enthusiastic hug but attempted to protest when she pinned him to the wall and stuck her tongue down his throat.
"Oh, do
"I thought you said you had housemates?"
"I don't like you. I don't want to like you. I don't want to be your
"Oi!" complained Ron. "She was hinting that you're – that you think you – don't like Ginny that way. Or any girl, for that matter."
"That you'd better get y-your arse out there, because he plans to f-fuck you into next week."
"Unlucky for some," said Fish, still grinning broadly. "And I'm always safe, me. Thanks though."
"Thanks," said Harry, snatching it back. He didn't like the look on Draco's face, fear and hate and resentment tightening his sharp features.
"I frankly have trouble believing you can even read, Potter," drawled Malfoy. He opened the book at the page Harry had stupidly,
She looked up at him.
"What do you mean?" he said, very quietly.
"And this is Keith." Keith was a little younger than Janine, in jeans and a shirt with the left arm pinned up, his right arm sporting a bicep the size of Harry's head. He nodded at Harry, grim. "And Elsie." Elsie was tiny, dressed in black, with jet-black hair and white make-up, and she was standing behind Janine with the air of someone hiding. She looked as though she couldn't even be Ginny's age. Harry gave her an encouraging smile — she turned abruptly away from him. Ginny patted Harry on the arm, and circled around Janine to talk to her.
"Um." Malfoy's head turned in the direction of the record player. "I was going to put some music on, actually, but I can see you're concentrating."
"But Draco," she said, visibly unsure for the first time that evening. "You always said —"
join me. I've a friend in the French Ministry who would absolutely love to meet you. I'm sure he'd offer you a position on his team after five minutes of your company."
"And he can't use while he's here," said Hermione. "He'll have to agree to be tested. I think there's a spell I can learn."
"Harry, mate," he said. "Can we come through? We've got a favour to ask."
"We're going to need new shoes," said Ginny.
"She wouldn't want anything to do with me. She lost her
"Um.” Harry froze, his fork was halfway to his mouth. "Sorry, shall I go?"
"Not just women," said Harry.
He'd chosen a Mind Healer called Adhikari. Hermione approved of her research into traumatic memory loss so much that when Harry had read her name from his list of potentials, she'd done a little dance of excitement and launched into a description of what an amazing researcher she was. Hermione's enthusiasm was really the only reason he chose her, besides the fact that he was fairly certain she was not the same person counseling Ginny or Draco.
"A hundred years, if you need it," said Ron seriously. Then, because he knew Harry well enough to know this kind of conversation gave Harry the urgent need for space: "Wanna cuppa?"
Then Ron corralled Harry into a discussion with Dean about whether Muggle martial arts were better than Auror combat training, and Hermione danced with Ginny on the coffee table, and everyone got progressively louder and more drunk until Harry looked around and could no longer see Draco.
"Alas, not as sexy as it sounds," said Seamus. "Still fun though."
"Now you're angry at me for leaving?" said Harry, taking a step closer. "Do you want me to go or not? God, what are you afraid of?"
. It didn't smell of anything, but Harry hadn't been able to smell it before, either.
Seamus wrinkled his nose.
Malfoy again, let alone what would happen if he did.
"Or you could come stay with me for a bit," said Harry, and Malfoy promptly spluttered the coffee all over his sleeping bag.
"Huh," Seamus mused. "Well, I guess the signs were there. Welcome to the club, mate. Although I'll be honest, I'm still working it all out meself, and Dean's got one foot in the other court."
As though Harry had summoned him with his discomfort, Kreacher appeared at his elbow.
"I bet Great Auntie Walburga is turning in her grave," Malfoy declared, pulling his gaze away. "Den of filth and iniquity, how
"Hermione has a leaflet about that," she said, Irish lilt sharper than Harry was used to. "Maybe you should give it to him."
"Great. Oh, but give me ten minutes, I need to go poke Hermione and make her eat something, you know what she's like when she's got a project."
Harry, abruptly, didn't feel at all normal. Should he feel jealous? He would have, once. He'd been stupid with jealousy, once.
"I don't think they sell rave gear in Littlewoods," said Hermione, amused.
"Gamma," said Teddy, pointing at Andromeda.
"Wanna play chess this evening?"
"Thank you
"I don't think that'll be necessary," said Harry dryly. Shev looked like she wanted to say something teasing in response, but professionalism got the better of her. She nodded at the bench.
going to be you who deals with him, you know that, right? He causes trouble, he has a breakdown, he has weird withdrawal symptoms, you're the one cleaning up his sick or whatever."
Ellie, giving him a look that was definitely flirtatious, held out her left wrist. Harry went hot with embarrassment as he caught her hand to examine it. In amongst the swirling patterns and winding calligraphy was a black outline of a rose, the petals delicately shaded with appealing dotwork. Harry didn't know much about tattoos, but it looked really good.
"For what?" asked Dean.
"But Draco — your childhood — all those summers in the grounds — "
"Oh," muttered Ron, pulling on his new shirt and looking at the sleeves. "Do you think an Extension Charm works on Muggle clothes?"
Harry couldn't tell if this was a subject change, or Ginny being terrifyingly astute.
"You might go to the papers I s'pose," said Seamus. "Hear you like that sort of thing."
"After seeing how long yours took, I made a potion, naturally."
"Yeah," agreed Dean, chuckling. "It always blew my mind a bit that everyone in Hogwarts was mad about this one band playing what I would have called
many things to say to you."
"I said I couldn't just forget the past because of an apology, but I didn't really know what he could possibly do that would make it better either. That it's beyond anyone's power at this point. I did tell him I respected him making the effort to change, and that I did understand he was a victim as well as a perpetrator. He didn't seem to like that much, but he did seem pretty genuine about wanting to be better." He heaved a breath. "I dunno. It's a lot to handle. And honestly, I don't really know the guy. He could be an unmitigated wanker or a really nice guy or anything in between and I don't know which he's going to be and how much energy I want to put into him. Guess I just have to give him a chance."
"Um," said Malfoy. "Actually, I'm not hungry."
Harry's stomach immediately began to gnaw. Was he really going to hand out soup to a line of strangers on the off-chance he might see Draco sodding Malfoy? He hadn't been able to run away fast enough the last time he saw Malfoy, on the stand in front of the Wizengamot on that one horrible day when Harry had been unable to avoid an in-person appearance. Malfoy had looked so small and sad and thin, barely recognisable as the snotty boy he'd first met in Diagon Alley, and it was only by focusing on the misery etched into Malfoy's face that he stopped the walls closing in on him. That was the day he'd run all the way to Grimmauld, and he'd mercifully not had cause to visit the Ministry since.
Harry shrugged.
Then he'd go and
Harry laughed against his lips.
"You need to tell her right away."
"Hey Ritchie, hey Andrew," he said. "Didn't know you were the year below."
Then he sat down against the wall beside the door, casting a subtle Eavesdropping Charm.
"Obviously," said Harry, smiling at her. She gave him a strange look, not quite a smile.
"It's Muggle, obviously, I couldn't exactly stroll into a wizarding trauma group either."
," she said eventually, dropping a plate back into the sink with a splash. "I'll see what I can do."
"Yes," he interrupted, clipped. "I was a little off the grid for a while. Blaise, it was… "
Ron snorted into his pastry. Pansy, to his annoyance, looked absolutely delighted.
Time stopped when Draco's palm cupped him through his boxers. When Draco slid a hand in to free his cock from the cotton, Harry thought his heart would stop too. Then Draco was sliding away from his lips, shimmying down the bed with his hands on Harry's chest, slipping lower, gripping his hips with bruising fingertips.
Neville gave him a pained look, like Harry would know exactly what he meant, and Harry became hotly aware that he
Malfoy was gay, and dated a Muggle drug dealer.
"Anyone else, Potter," said Draco against his lips, some moments later, "And I'd think that was a line."
"Can you think of someone you want to dress like? Someone you think is cool?" said Luna. "That's how I decide. My mum was ever so sparkly, and she never wore anything like anyone else I know. I dress like her, mostly. It makes me happy."
me and Hermione sleep in separate rooms. I mean, it's ridiculous at this point, we're both eighteen and serious and they've known her for years. Do they think we're going to get up to anything in the comfort of a bedroom that we couldn't have done in a tent?"
"Oh, about an hour ago," said Luna, waving a hand. Ginny sighed, giving Harry a conspiratorial eye-roll.
Malfoy was gay.
And why did Harry care so much?
"Oi, what was that for?" asked Jack. "Ooh, Harry, in bed with your best friend's bird?"
it's alright to host it here?"
. It's like knowing there's an actual snake in the house, but never knowing where it is."
"Alright. Then it's agreed. A month of babysitting Draco Malfoy."
"Here, these trackies are cool," said Dean.
"Good-o," said Fish. "Knew he'd land on his feet eventually, posh git like that. Tell 'im I said hello. Say, do you wanna blow this lot off and go grab a pint?"
Dean pulled the sympathetic face that alerted Harry to the fact he'd said something incredibly depressing about the Dursleys again. He forgot, sometimes, the extent to which their treatment of him had not been
"I don't suppose you recognise it?" said Harry, looking at Malfoy. Malfoy sat up, squinting at the window, and then his face broke out in a smile like the rising of a dazzling sun. Harry found himself caught up in the sight of it, the flash of teeth, the pink bow of Malfoy's mouth curving up with excitement.
"Um," said Ron. "Yeah, I kind of meant the
This was Malfoy, bloody Malfoy, and even if he had elegant hands and slim hips and wicked eyes...
"No," she said, looking away. "No, I… I gave it to my parents."
With an unsteady rattle, a full tea service materialised on the coffee table. Kreacher's probably in ecstasy, thought Harry, not at all sharing his joy. He made a move to sit down, but Blaise looked up at him with another bland smile.
than I remember, how can that be?"
"Makes sense," she said. A pause, and then she added: "How's Malfoy doing?"
"Maybe I don't understand," said Luna, "I've never done it. But why can't you love more than one person at a time? Is it something to do with being sexual together? It can't be magical, I've looked it up, but everyone
master. What can Kreacher be doing?"
"You pick the items," said Dean, settling into the other beanbag besides Seamus, who gave a little snore and flung a hand over his face. "Tell me the number and the price, I'll write it down, then we can check it over and fill out the order form in the back."
"A solid orange, maybe," he said, grinning reassuringly at her.
Harry pulled himself back a little, out of the bubble of temptation.
"That's a shame," said Ron, slowly. "But he's not
"Come on," said Harry, giving her a shoulder barge. "Let's go lose chess on purpose so Ron can do the silly victory dance again."
happier.
They settled down in plastic chairs, a steady filter of people settling in next to them, and Harry was struck by how different everyone was, how many ages and genders and walks of life were represented in this little circle of people. He could have passed any one of them in the street today and never known that they all shared the kind of weight he felt. Even now, watching them chat and laugh and drink tea, it seemed unthinkable that any of them were anything other than perfectly normal, perfectly fine.
"I do," he said. "Probably more than makes any sense, if I'm honest. But you're allowed your privacy. Besides, what am I going to do? Beat it out of you?"
Malfoy was out again by the time Harry dragged himself out of bed. Harry tended to the garden in the morning sun, carefully spelling greenfly off the roses, and at lunchtime he flopped down beside the sunflowers with a coffee and a sandwich and read one of Neville's gardening books, occasionally prodding optimistically at his flagging sunflower.
They abandoned all notion of heading out that weekend. Harry made pasta while the rest of the household took up positions leaning on the kitchen table, loosely under the guise of helping, although with the exception of Neville quietly chopping onions they were entirely in the way. Harry didn't mind, especially since they kept him topped up on the wine that nobody wanted to wait to open, and Ron and Ginny kept them entertained with a sibling skit over who got to sit at the head of the table, culminating in a quick-draw Stinging Hex duel which Ginny won. Harry, laughing, ruined her victory, claiming the end of the table himself. He kicked back on the chair, like Sirius used to do, and attempted to pull something that halfway resembled Sirius's trademark smirk.
like the look of it.
, really, never two men, except that one time Ron got Neville when playing spin the bottle. But that hadn't been like this, that had been a peck with no passion behind it, not like Dean who was pulling Seamus close against him now —
"It's a good job
"I know," agreed Hermione. "But if I'm honest, Ron and I thought it wouldn't last. We thought she'd get out of this phase she's in and change her mind."
Then he went to Flourish and Blotts and bought Hermione an expensive quill and a notebook, because at least she couldn't have read a notebook already. Harry was served by Blott himself; the man was all smiles, but Harry made some loud comments about how he hoped his excellent staff were being paid a fair wage and treated well, and left Blott standing at the till with several curious eyes upon him. The assistant that day hid his grin behind a copy of Advanced Potion Making.
a little bit evil, not completely obviously, but a little bit, and can you imagine what his parents would say if they found out? God, what's Ron going to say... but yeah, I think if I can get him alone again we can talk – or maybe not, you know, maybe direct is the answer –"
you insensitive —"
"Oh, hey Ritchie, hey Jack," he said. "S'funny, thought you had a Ravenclaw girl."
Hermione put her hand over her mouth.
Harry absolutely was
"You prat, everyone knows. Well, you know, important people."
the Malfoy we know," said Harry, grinning. "No, it's not the servants' quarters. It's where Sirius and Regulus used to sleep. I think they must have liked the view. I've sorted out Regulus's room for you. You're the only one on the top floor."
right now."
Harry had to fight the urge to press his face into Teddy's hair and squeeze him. He loved him so much it almost hurt. Why had he stayed away so long? He'd missed so much, he never wanted to miss another moment.
"That's very kind of you," said Malfoy, not looking at Harry. Harry wanted to curl up into the bean bag in embarrassment.
"Thanks," said Harry. "See you at home."
Harry locked himself in the study and finally began looking through his post. Most of the letters were invitations to balls and events that had long passed, but he politely declined those which were in the future. He signed some cheques to charitable causes, all carefully chosen by his accountant, because Harry couldn't be trusted not to sign away everything he had. He wrote letters of thanks for the few fan letters that made it through his mail filter. He finally read the letter from Narcissa, which was uncomfortably grateful. Then he read Pansy's apology, which felt so formal as to be copied verbatim from some pure-blood book on etiquette. Harry didn't really know what to say in response, so he didn't.
exactly an addict," said Harry grimly, pulling himself up off the floor. "But I don't think he'll be drinking again, either. Not at the moment, at least."
"Bowie?" said Neville, appearing in the doorway. He had a smudge of earth on the side of his nose.
"Well," said Ron. "I suppose that could have gone worse."
the embarrassment radiating from her.
"About your sexual crisis! You can't just leave her hanging while you prove your sexuality by trying to get off with Draco Malfoy, can you?"
"Can I have that purple blazer, if you're buying?" said Seamus, grinning.
Then Malfoy drained his cup and rose, slowly. Harry followed him up the stairs, watching Malfoy's elegant hands trace over the bannisters as they mounted the main staircase, studying the set of his slim shoulders as he walked. They didn't turn on the lights in the upstairs corridor, letting the moonlight spill down from the skylight on the top floor, and Harry wanted to say something ridiculous, like
"How about if we ditch the soup and go get a takeaway or something, you get to know me and hear me out, and then you can decide."
"I think there's a music stall," she offered, leaning over the counter to pick up a receipt. "In amongst everything else. I'm not sure where exactly."
"You looking at Harry's bum?" said Dean, in mock-outrage.
"Sorry," said Ginny, as they looked at her, smiling and embarrassed. "Just. You know. About time."
" said Harry eventually, aware that it wasn't really a question.
Malfoy sucked in an audible breath. Harry gave him a sideways glance; he had that pinched look on his face, the one Harry was coming to recognise as guilt.
It looked old, the sweeping calligraphy at the top declaring it to be the Title Deed to 12, Grimmauld Place. He smoothed it out and read the first line.
"Oh?" said Harry.
"I appreciate your caution," he said. "I really, really do. And it's why I can tell you this now with confidence — because I trust you. I
"’Scuse me, lad!" An elderly wizard barged past him, knocking Harry inside. The wall closed behind him.
Malfoy was absent at dinner again, but to avoid any funny looks Harry decided to stay downstairs to eat with the others first. Hermione, to Harry's surprise, was also absent; when he asked, Ron shrugged and said she was, "Faffing about with potions equipment upstairs again. Honestly, Harry, she keeps banning me from the dressing room to do mad projects, I have no idea why she's like this."
