"You didn't forget to order the other costume you have to wear tonight, didn't you?" she asked, still scanning the corridors for students with her knife out in front of her. She felt like a Shadowhunter with her knife, from her favourite muggle tv show she likes to watch. The Shadowhunter's.
Cedric chuckled at the two boys while Cho giggled at them. This was such a nice sight to see. Two people deeply in love though they don't see it. "You know, you two really are adorable together," he said with a warm smile, and hinting what they should become.
Harry and Draco looked at each other and laughed. "Yeah, well..." Harry says and brings his and Draco's intertwined hands up onto the table. He places a little kiss to Draco's knuckles, making Draco smile and so he continued. "She's got her eyes on someone else. A certain Slytherin."
Harry noticed Draco's frown and rubbed his cheek with his thumb. The blonde wizard looked up and nodded, non-verbally saying he's alright. Harry nodded and smiled, he looked over at Ron who looked at him and Draco with disgust, guilt, and... jealousy?
He really wasn't angry at anyone except Crabbe, Goyle and Nott because of the article. The other thing was Draco and how he reacted after Harry kissed his cheek. He hoped it didn't do anything to their relationship, he didn't even know why he did it. Was it just to reassure Draco that he was okay with the article? Well, the article was very hurtful to Hagrid, but he knew it wasn't Draco's fault.
It was no good. He just couldn't wait any longer. "Kiss me," Draco whispered. Harry didn't need asking twice. He lowered his head and pressed his mouth to Draco's, flicking his tongue out and lapping carefully at Draco's lips. They both groaned and writhed together as they fell into kissing. They seemed so compatible, each intrusion into the other's mouth both needed and welcomed. Draco dragged his arms from above his head and gave in to his ultimate temptation. He wrapped them around Harry, letting his hands wander over every piece of accessible skin, stroking and tickling and teasing as they moved. He cupped the back of Harry's head, gently at first but with growing force as the kisses became more desperate, more passionate.
"Bien sûr, je sais que tu parles français, Draco," she said in her soft French-British accent. "Je le parle pour une raison." ("Of course, I know you speak French, Draco. I'm speaking it for a reason.") She sighed and rubbed her temples, feeling a migraine start to come.
Draco sighed as he lay with his back against the wall. He enjoyed tasting Harry so much and wanted more. He watched the Gryffindor stroll up the stairs with a loving smile and walked off after him. As he walked up behind his boyfriend, he snaked his arms around his waist. "We really should head to class as we don't want to be late, my darling."
Fred just smiled at him. This was intriguing to hear. He will do his best to help his non-blooded brother the best he can. "No worries, Harry," he said with a dismissed wave of his hand. "Just place your right hand on my waist and your left hold with my hand."
"Harry! Snap out of it!" Petunia hit him across the face again, this time it was harder. Harry inhaled sharply and everything around him began to focus. Honestly, he would rather suffer than see everything clearly again.
He looks back at Draco and leans down, placing a soft kiss to the side of the Slytherin's jaw. He's seen muggles do it on movies and he has wanted to try it out. Draco doesn't even move when Harry kisses him, so he decides to continue kissing up and down Draco's jawline until he moves.
"Gin, what's the matter?" Ron froze at the sight of a woman dressed in all black, the hood of her robe white and she wore a cross around her neck. She was just standing in the shadows of a corner of the room, her deathly pale face almost as white as a sheet and closed eyes which had black circles around them.
Harry snuck into the lounge room where Aunt Petunia was watching the news and hid behind a chair. He heard a news reporter say that a girl committed suicide due to her mother being an alcohol addict and was abusing her. The news reporter says she had been suffering from depression and anxiety and that she'd had self-harm cuts all up to her arms due to a razor blade.
They wandered down the torch-lit tunnel, stealing glances at one another as they neared the oak door. Draco opened up the door without hesitation, revealing a large 6m by 6m torch-lit room with grey walls, three small wooden bookshelves with carvings of flowers on it, a large cream-coloured stone fireplace, two large enchanted windows with black curtains, a wooden antique table with a few books on them, a large brown wooden dressing table with a circular mirror with drawers, two-midnight blue armchairs with black linings and a couch with the same colours.
“Something more?” Ron asked him, repeating the words over and over in his head and trying to figure out what Harry meant by ‘something more’. “What do you mean?”
Gregory sighed but smiled at the two. He grabbed Vincent by the pyjama sleeve and pulled him away from the blonde Slytherin and the green-eyed Gryffindor.
Harry decided to make the girl laugh, she deserved it after all. "Uh, if I may ask, what's a lesbian?" Of course he knows what a lesbian was but from what he has seen Ivy doing in this very room a few weeks ago, he knows she deserves to have a laugh.
Collin, Emmaline, and Rebecca were the first out. Everyone followed them, looking out for the other students who would be walking the corridors, thinking it is just a normal night.
Draco studied Harry's demeanour, seeing as he looked sad like always. Every time he asks if Harry's okay, he gets the 'I'm fine' lie. He wanted to know what was up with him but didn't know if he should ask. "Are you alright?"
Draco shook his head, "Nope." He wished he knew. He literally has a whole walk-in wardrobe that's at least three times the size of a bathroom, so he has plenty to wear. But plenty isn't enough. He needs more.
Harry stared at himself in the mirror and smiled. But he still needs to wear these irritating lime green contact lenses. "Do I look recognizable as myself?" he asked his reflection, but really, he was asking Dean.
"Oh, I don't know," said Fred and shrugged a little. He learnt the Macarena, Nut Bush, and Gangnam style from the fifth-year Muggle-borns. Their names are Elton who's a Gryffindor, Rosemary's a Ravenclaw, Nikola's a Gryffindor, and Corbyn's a Hufflepuff. Elton and Rosemary are actually from America, and Corbyn and Nikola are from Australia. They came to the United Kingdom when they were young and grew up here. "The macarena, Gangnam Style and Nut Bush? Oh, and by the way, what were you laughing at when we entered the Great Hall?"
Harry ran a hand slowly along Draco's body. He stared at Draco's wrist, still bent up above his head as it gripped the headboard. Draco felt the soft press of Harry's warm fingertips as they drew over his pulse point and stroked the inside of his arm, stopping briefly to trace the crease of his inner elbow before continuing steadily over the silky skin inside his upper arm. Draco sighed as Harry's fingers combed through the sparse hair in his armpit and twisted his body instinctively into the touch. And then the hand moved lower, the fingers now joined by the press of a palm as Harry's hand travelled on, teasing his side, his thumb straying onto Draco's chest to circle his hard little nipple before moving again. Further and further it went, tracing the shape of Draco's waist and the ridge of his hipbone, letting the fingers stray down to caress the slight swell of Draco's buttock. The hand continued along Draco's long thigh, bent upwards and wrapped around Harry's hip. It finally stopped at Draco's knee and began a slow return journey.
Everyone looked at him strangely for one second, knowing he was speaking his native language, Gaelic, then looked back at the girl. They had no idea what he said in Gaelic.
When in the Slytherin 4th year boy's dormitory, he searched his trunk for his own nail clippers. He picked up the grey nail clippers from in a little compartment and checked his own nails out just to be sure his own nails weren't sharp. Perfect as always with no pointy or sharp edges. He smiled and headed down into the common room to find his sharp clawed friend.
"What happened to the entrance?" Blaise asked, his eyebrows drew together with worry and confusion. He swore the exit was right here. He just knew it. "What's wrong with this place?"
Draco rolled his eyes at the Gryffindor. "You just can't help yourself, can you?" he asked him flatly with a shake of his head. "Gryffindor this and Gryffindor that." The obvious answer to this is that any Gryffindor wants to see something new that's Gryffindor-related. It's the same with him but with Slytherin. He wants to check out the Slytherin bedroom too.
"Your brothers, sister, parents, Hermione and I are all here for you," Harry assured him softly. "You can talk to any of us about your grief, George. You're not alone. I still miss Fred, same as your family." He paused, trying to remember what McGonagall once told him in a therapy session. "Go where the joy is, George. Surround yourself with love, family members and friends. Don't let the addictions take you on. Self-harm is one of the worst addictions with suffering from depression. I know because when Cedric Diggory died, I blamed myself for it. What's worse was when Sirius died, I felt so alone and fell into a deep depression. I used self-harm as a coping mechanism with my grief."
The music recorder changed songs from old classic jazz and played 'Dancing Queen', by Abba. Harry remembers this song from one of Petunia's albums and music collections. She loves her Abba, Fleetwood Mac, and a few other bands like the Beatles. Harry's found so many albums that it's not even funny.
"I'll take this furry friend!" Draco yelled at Sam, who was at the counter of the pet store. He wanted to buy this ferret right away and send it to Joslyn. He knows she will love this little fella.
Harry sighed sadly; he really, really didn't want to be here. He wished he never woke up today in fact. "Are you going to get the ingredients, or shall I?" he asked but he gave his best mate a palpable look to say he wanted him to get the required ingredients.
"As it was so, Harry," Draco said, agreeing with him about the 'spending time together' part of the morning. He'd love to do this again but didn't know how to say it. He stood there, staring into green eyes and bit his lip, "Right, I should... Goodbye, Harry."
Ivy yawned on Draco's shoulder, covering her mouth. "Yeah, I guess. I haven't been sleeping much lately, you know... Nightmares and episodes."
Ron stared at the two boys in shock. He had no clue what was going on except Malfoy feeding his best mate food. It was just... weird. But he admitted to himself that it looked kind of... adorable. But guys shouldn't be doing this... Beside him, Blaise was smiling at the thought of him feeding Ron or even the other way around.
Taking a closer look, Harry saw Mike show the group a muggle penny and gesture a young third-year half-blood witch with toffee brown hair forward with a little wave of his hand. The girl stepped forward, clearly confused, and amazed at these two younger Gryffindor's could make items disappear without using wands.
"I was nervous, okay!" Draco responded back coldly. Merlin can't his cousin stop being right for once. "You don't know how he makes me feel. My heart... it is like it's about to explode into butterflies and fireworks. And did you see him in that hoodie? He is so darn charming and cute!"
"I-In Q-queensl-land," Ron stuttered and looked to the floor. The whole room suddenly quietened down until the sound of crickets could have been heard.
"I guess I'll go then," said Harry with an unwilling shrug. He didn't care if he was the one who tests it out, he just wanted to know what his apparent true lover is even though he wished it to be the guy he's been crushing on for ages.
Overwhelming fear took over to the point where Harry couldn't move, couldn't talk, he just kept seeing Uncle Vernon in Ron's eyes. Harry wrenched away from his best mate and glared at him. The sleepiness and confusion had now faded away. Harry was now aware of where he was and who Ron was. Shit! he thought, staring into his best mates' blue eyes. Now he knows... This is bad... "R-Ron?"
And then Draco kissed Harry's cheek, causing Harry to feel a sudden heating sensation in his cheeks and he smiled. The blonde Slytherin's kiss still lingering on his cheeks and it was so calming, so natural.
After Harry had escaped everyone in the Great Hall, he headed directly back to Gryffindor Tower. Tears were present in his eyes before he finally broke down, Ron's hurtful words still echoing in his head from earlier this morning. Freak, he thought. A depressed gay freak! I'm a depressed gay freak!
"Oh my god Draco, keep going," Harry panted, running his fingers through the Slytherin's blonde hair. His whole body was hot, small beads of sweat running down the sides his face, his face was scrunched up in obvious pleasure, his grip on the sheets tightening.
He remembered everything his Dragon had told him about Harry Potter, 'Wonderful Potter, with his scar, smile and his broomstick'. How could he be so blind? Draco was masking his true feelings in front of his own father, and possibly his mother. He now knew in between those lines, that there was a boy who masked his true feelings, a boy who found love. Lucius sighed and looked back up at his wife, "Did you know about our son's true feelings for the boy? Did Draco mask his feelings in front of you too or is it just me?"
"Oh, I just wanted some alone time," Harry said which actually was true. That was until Draco somehow found him, but he doesn't mind at all. He enjoys Draco's company even in his darkest states of mind. He just wished Hermione, even though he loves having her around, didn't disturb the moment as he wanted to know what Draco wanted to ask him. "Let's head to the common room, I need to finish off Potions homework." Hermione nodded and Harry went back to the Gryffindor common room by Harry's side. She had a few things she needed to do as well.
"Don't you ever say you don't deserve someone, and don't you dare say you're a freak!" Draco nearly spat but kept his tone down. He didn't want to upset Harry by being loud. He couldn't believe what he was hearing. He turned off the music player and wrapped his arms around Harry before he could runoff. He kissed Harry on the forehead and tightened his grip on his boyfriend. "You are not a freak! Don't call yourself such a bad word. You are loved by so many people. By me, Weasel, Granger, and by so many people. Every teacher in this school cares about you, Harry. Don't you ever think nobody cares about you because it's not true. So many people care for you, Harry. Your own mother gave her life for you, you should feel grateful. I love you Harry James Potter and I will always do."
"Oh my gosh!" I nearly screamed at them. But this was making her feel a little irritated. She wanted to see some kissing. "Just kiss already!"
Hermione nodded at him, watching carefully for any odd signs in his demeanour but she didn't see anything. "I don't think many people are going to believe it, Harry," she told him in an assuring voice. "People are going to think that since you're the 'Chosen One', you appear as straight. So, if you're worrying, you shouldn't. Only a few people are going to believe the rumours. Well, people who know you and are smart enough to see will see that you're not straight."
Harry let those thoughts fly off to the back of his mind. He began to zone out, just staring at a small chip on a tile a few feet away, all those negative thoughts he felt earlier that day, had come back to his mind.
Harry looked up at the Slytherin table, meeting eyes with Draco. He nodded and Draco nodded back with a smile. Harry felt a little sick just staring at the food, he decided he just wanted to be alone, so he got up and started walking out of the Great Hall. Draco watched as Harry got up, he'd been watching him and haven't seen Harry eat decent amounts of food. He's been really worried for his Gryffindor friend.
Harry shook his head in disbelief. "Right..." Hermione rarely watches F.R.I.E.N.D.S but if she does it's out of boredom and Hermione's never bored, as far as Harry knows as he's been her best friend for years. "Tell me what you're thinking, 'Mione."
Draco sighed happily and got up, dusting his pants off. "It's okay," he assured him. It didn't matter anymore. All that mattered if being here with Harry and spending long numbers of time with him alone. "Are you ready for Potions Practice?"
"Madam Pomfrey, what are you doing!" Ivy snapped as she looked away, hissing at that delicious smell of the medics blood filled her nostrils and she could feel her fangs appear in her mouth. She's tried blood before. Human blood which the human let her feed of them so she wouldn't get in trouble by the ministry.
"I know!" Blaise said and he beamed at the thought of kissing the guy he likes in a similar way to when he saw Harry and Draco kiss. "It just... seems like a dream come true to Draco. He's liked Harry for a year or two. What about Harry? I don't know him as well as you do."
Ron couldn't believe what she had said. He hasn't even eaten anything decent yet! "But we have like... an hour until Potions!" he exclaimed with a frown and quickly gathers a piece of bread onto his plate and butters it. "Can't we just... I don't know, eat?" Hermione shook her head at him a little ignorantly.
"Bloody Marry x3?" Blaise said, he touched the base of his neck, wondering whose blood that could be.
"There will be no talking," said Snape as he began walking slowly back and forth in front of his Slytherin students. "No whispering, giggling, fraternizing, fondling, or any further form of disgusting behaviour that doesn't involve learning to dance. Any sort of that behaviour and you will be excluded from this practice and made a fool of yourself when the Yule Ball approaches. Are there any questions?" A few people raised their hands, but he chose to ignore them. "No? Good. Boys put a hand on your partner's waist. Girls put a hand on your partner's shoulder and the other hold your partners' hand. For those whose genders are the same within partnering, you decide what comforts you best."
A male bartender with rolled up sleeves was moving from one side of the blue and white bar to the other end of the counter. Blue wooden stools lined up along the counter, there was a wall of alcohol bottles, stem glasses were hanging upside down above the male bartender's head. Half empty cocktails and wine glasses were dispersed out on the counter. There were a few empty tables with upside down shot glasses and crumpled napkins, but the rest were full. There even was a karaoke stage, with a young dark-haired female who had a really pitchy voice.
Harry shook his head, not even thinking that his best friend could like him in that way. Even if she did, he wouldn't have noticed. Who would even like a freak like himself? "She doesn't." He looked back to the book he was previously reading. The first word he spots in one paragraph is 'soul'. Strange... "She's always looking over at the Slytherin table."
Harry looked into Fred's brown eyes once again, not knowing how to reply. He was a little confused. How can you test this kind of theory? "Uh, what do you mean."
"The look on your face," Harry said simply. That one comment knocked Draco sideways. He didn't have any kind of snappy comeback ready. Instead, he looked away from Harry and focussed on a spot high up on the ceiling, giving the impression that it was the most interesting thing he'd ever seen.
Harry pulled off, this time stroking the Slytherin with his hand at a fast pace and pushing Draco over the edge. "Yes, Harry." He could hear the silent moan from above him, knowing Draco's covering his head in his arms over the table. Watching the Slytherin's cock jerk up, he licked his lips and took Draco back in his mouth again, sucking harshly as the Slytherin shot three loads of semen into his mouth.
"No, only you," Harry said, and he hugged his legs to his chest to keep himself warm. The bathroom was quite cold. "I just didn't want my f-friends worrying about me. They all have their own p-problems to deal with." He was thinking about if Ron will accept him as being gay. "I was thinking of telling Draco since we have become good friends, but I just don't know when to. I love him and don't want him to worry about me." Good friends with benefits he should say as he remembers the kiss earlier today.
"He believes I'll cut off the relationship between him and me because of the article," Harry said with a frown as he doesn't want that either. He wants the relationship with Draco to go on for as long as it can and hopefully that will be for a long time. He wants to get to know more of Draco and to maybe meet his mother and see what she's like.
Harry sighed and folded the letter back into the envelope and placed it back into his robe pocket. He loved how Sirius was so accepting of his sexuality and his crush on Draco, he honestly thought Sirius would shout at him and tell him to never speak to Draco again. That would be depressing, not being able to talk to the person who you secretly have feelings for. Harry got up and made his way down to Potions, he knew he wouldn't be late as he left the Great Hall 10 minutes into Breakfast. Though he didn't really care if he was late.
Harry nodded at him while Hermione sighed a little. They eventually headed back up to the castle to wrap their gifts and give them to the house-elves for them to deliver the presents on Christmas day.
Sooner than later, the Quidditch World Cup has made its way to England. Ron seemed more excited to see Victor Krum than the Bulgarian Quidditch team, besides, it's not like they are actually going to meet anyone famous.
Draco was just singing along to the lyrics, not knowing who made this song but he swears, if he finds the person, he will thank them for the song. This song is really sinking deep into his heart.
Draco was filled with the desire to taste Harry's skin, and he pushed his tongue out and licked the lengthening shaft with infinite care, memorising the subtle lumps and bumps of the hardening flesh which is his now and forever. This man, and this man's beautiful cock was all his, forever.
Harry just stood there, and he cupped his cheek that Draco kissed and chuckled a little. It was sweet what Draco did, but he doesn't know why he did such a thing. When thinking back in time a little to the day where he saw a heart doodled with his name in the middle on Draco's work during Herbology, he pondered if it was true. That Draco liked him. But who would even like him? A freak who's enslaved by his own family. A freak who cuts himself. Shaking away those dark thoughts in his mind, he decided to head to Gryffindor common room. He found Hermione in that very spot he always finds her, and he walks up to her with a smile. "Hello, Hermione!"
The three could hear Fred and George planning some of their mischiefs which they knew it was about the age line and trying to get in. Hermione kept interrogating the two twins into why they would do such a thing and that they'd never be able to actually cross the age line. But of course, the twins ignored Hermione and kept plotting.
Harry really didn't want to be here. Escaping was something he wanted to do but he had to stay and suffer in an hour of Potions. He wanted to be alone, to be someplace where nobody could find him. In a loud 'Thud' the Potions Classroom Door shut, that could only mean that Snape has entered.
Narcissa smiled at her son and shook her head. "No, my dragon." She embraced him in a tight hug as she was glad this war was finally over. "It's not bad at all, but maybe a little bit early to say those three words."
"I know and I'll tell them when I can," Harry said to him, dropping his gaze back to the floor as somehow tears were forming in his eyes. The hell is happening. Is he having some kind of relapse or something? He blinked away the tears, focusing on the topic at hand. He just didn't know when he'll be able to tell Ron and Hermione about the truce with Draco. This was just decision making which he really can't be bothered with doing. "By the way, do you think you'll get into the tournament?"
Draco smiled from the hug and leaned in, ending the space between him and Harry and giving him a long lingering lovable kiss and didn't care if he could taste himself from Harry's mouth. He wanted to give Harry as much love as he could. He wanted Harry to feel loved, to know what love really feels like because he deserves it from what Harry is suffering from. Everyone deserves to feel loved, he hoped so much that Harry did not doubt that. He leaned back an inch out of the kiss, pressed their foreheads together and held Harry's hand. "Let's head down for breakfast, I'm guessing it's nearly halfway through."
"We Slytherins kind of have the same mechanism," said Draco, but he laughed a little at the way the Slytherin's have to deal with if they dare try and cross into the other gender's dormitories. "We can't go to the girl's dormitories, not even though the tunnel without it burning the hair off our heads or we get blown into the wall behind us. This one kid learnt his lesson last year. He was mortified about losing all his hair and having a back injury at the same time. It's the same with the girls too. The only way you can go into the other sexes dormitories is if you're holding their hands."
Unfortunately, Hermione saw Harry's struggle to eat which she grew immensely worried about. "Harry?" she asked softly. "Are you going to eat anything?"
Pansy nodded her head and sighed a little sadly. The state Ivy is in really makes her understand that this world can really be cruel. "Yeah, I've hidden them in the most secretive of places. Nobody will ever find them, not even Dumbledore could."
Draco rolled his eyes at his cousin again, linked pinky fingers with her and promised her the muggle way. "Yes, I promise I'll ask Potter out - when it feels right."
Draco smiled down to the floor at nothing and nodded. “I enjoyed it very much, father.” He looked behind him at Harry, who was walking towards the Weasleys.
"Oh, alright," said Hermione. "I guess we should head back too. I need to start making dinner for these two." She pointed her fingers to Ron and Harry.
Draco nodded; he was mainly here for the bacon. He loves his bacon. "When's it going to be ready?" he asked. He was sure if Weasley was here he's be dribbling all over the kitchen floor from this smell of bacon.
"I'm going to get dressed..." Harry suddenly says and runs a hand through his dark messy hair. God, he won't be forgetting this morning with Draco at all. The Slytherin just filled him with light and love and such a strong emotion that he forgot he even had. He just felt like he was floating when kissing Draco which he never thought kisses could do. With Fred, he never felt like he was floating. It was just a kiss and even if there was a spark of interest, he didn't think kissing could make him feel this way.
Harry actually smiled at Draco. True smiling was quite rare for him as he would always use fake smiles but for Draco, it seemed he could give him real ones. "Two can play that game," he said boldly as he pointed his wand at Draco. "Anteoculatia!"
"What?" asked Lisa slowly. She looked around the corridor they were in for anything odd. When nothing was seen by her, she said, "Speak up. What are you saying?"
Cedric laughed at the lovestruck Gryffindor. It took a moment for Cedric to find the words to say to Harry about the next task, "By the way, have you figured out the egg yet?"
"I know, and non-taken," Harry said as he sluggishly was getting up from his bed and walking towards the window closest to him and facing the Hogwarts grounds. "But it is a good way to let time fly though."
"You call that fair?" Harry asked, glaring at Draco. Though he couldn't stay pissed at Draco for long as he notices that there are these beautiful stars in those silver eyes that glimmer so brightly which makes his heartbeat like a mini drum. He could have gotten knocked out and broken a few bones only minutes ago if he didn't take that sharp cut upwards. "I almost crashed into one of the Hufflepuff towers."
"Never mind..." Harry said, shaking his head to end the conversation. He didn't want to go on if Cedric doesn't know what he meant. "It's a muggle thing." Cedric nodded.
Draco took a moment's hesitation to think this through. Of course, he wouldn't say much about Harry to Skeeter even if it were for a laugh and to make sure Crabbe, Goyle, and Nott aren't suspecting anything about the relationship he has with Harry. "It's more complicated than it was now, isn't it?"
"What was that?" Pansy asked in a terrified voice. She was seconds away from crying because anything that screamed bloody murder must be something terrible.
Harry sniffled at the small speech his boyfriend gave him. It helps a little but not entirely a lot. "I love you too, Draco. I'm sorry, but..."He shook his head sadly. He can't say it. "Never mind... Can we just... cuddle on the couch?"
Joslyn accidentally let out a loud 'REEEE' and shouted, "DRARRY IS REAL, MUTHAFUKAZ!" Hermione scolded her for swearing so she apologized. But like... Drarry!
Draco shrugged and smiled with a blush to his cheeks. Oh, this is hard to say. He can't say I know things about you like nobody else can. He's not that crazy about Harry even if the thought of what pyjamas Harry wears does cross his mind. "I notice things."
Ivy noticed the stutter and grinned. Oh, did she not hear wrong? Is it true that Harry likes her cousin back? "I'm sorry, did you mean to say you love him?" She asked with a wink.
Harry just stared at Draco, still not knowing why he'd just come up and say 'Hi' then say 'Bye' and leave. He then caught himself staring at the blonde Slytherin's butt and liking how it moves as he walks. He sighs and decides to head to breakfast like he would have done. It's nice to see Draco come and go though.
Narcissa greeted both boys with a tired smile in the dining room. She obviously didn't get her required amount of sleep last night. Both Harry and Draco wondered why that was as Narcissa always came down to breakfast as if she slept for the last week or two.
"Uh, look," said Ron ad got straight to the point. He hated this silent treatment they had and wanted it to end now. He can't live without Harry, his best mate, in his life. He's the only mate he has while Hermione's his best friend. "I'm sorry for nagging you about how you passed the age line."
And then the kiss ended, both boys out of breath and staring at each other. Harry wished there wasn't a thing called breathing. He could kiss Draco all night long.
"Harry, you have no idea how much I care about you," Draco says, and he stares into those green eyes which look so glossy like Harry's been crying last night. Little does he know Harry has been crying himself to sleep for many months now. "I hope you believe me because I've been showing you how I truly feel about you through hugging, flirting, and kissing. There is always someone who cares for you without your knowledge and people. I am one of those persons. It's the same as Ivy and your Gryffindor friends. They all care deeply for you. But I'm the one who cares for you the most. If I don't then I wouldn't be kissing you, asking you out, or planning dates for us."
As he worked himself up and down, Draco felt the first signals of his body's struggle to cope with the intrusion. Harry's cock was ploughing tender, untouched territory and Draco didn't even have him all the way inside yet. It felt so deep, so completely far into his body that it seemed impossible for Harry to go any further.
Ron's eyes widened in surprise, but then he shook his head knowing he shouldn't take money from people, especially his best friend. "No, it's okay," he said with quite a heavy sigh. "I'll just not go, no biggie."
Ginny suddenly smiled and she gave a long sigh. She believes it is time to tell them. "Since I know that now... I would like you both to meet my girlfriend," she said as she stood up from the seat and noticed her brother's surprised expression. "Wait right here, will you?" She gave them both kisses on the forehead just to embarrass them a little. Embarrass them she did. She smirked and headed over to the Ravenclaw table.
Harry looked over at Draco. Draco's eagle owl swooped down and landed on his shoulder with two familiar letters in its mouth. Harry noticed Draco stuffing his own envelope into his robe pocket and furrowed his eyebrows curiously. Who were those letters from?
Harry's breath hiked, feeling someone else's leg against his own. It was Draco's, of course. He noticed Draco was staring at him, he smiled back at the Slytherin. "What?"
Harry backed all the way to the wall and wrapped his arms around his knees. Burying his head in his lap, he laid out a strangled sob. He just wanted to die.
Ron sighed in frustration; he really wants Harry to tell him what's up. "Harry, is everything that happens at your relative's house okay?" he asks him softly. "They don't... abuse you, do they?"
"Well, this is... boring," Ron said first with a long sigh, his arms were holding up his chin which was resting on the palm of his hand. Harry just couldn't have agreed more than to believe this was boring and a waste of time.
Harry finished Draco's sentence as he had a feeling, he knew what Draco was going to say, "-That your eyes are the prettiest emerald green I've ever seen in the world? Yeah, I've noticed." He smiled and caressed Draco's cheeks with his fingers. "A certain and handsome blonde hair and silver-eyed wizard told me that."
As if on cue, the lights dimmed. The whole room turned dark with only the snowflakes just giving enough light to see everyone in the room. Harry was slowly regretting asking George to put the music on, it was just making him want to kiss Draco again but longer than necessary. He wanted a full make-out session with Draco.
Draco opened his eyes and looked down at the Gryffindor whose eyes were closing, and he looked pretty much at peace. The sight adored him. He smiles as he leans his head forward to kiss Harry's forehead and with his fingers, he brushes away the dark hair from closed eyes.
Snape scoffed at his student and his terrible knowledge. Even Lily knew of the potion. "It appears you have not read page 343, Mr Potter. Perhaps Miss Granger can answer my question?"
"Hey, Harry," Neville whispered back with a smile. He was about to ask Harry about how his holiday was but was cut off by Ginny saying her hellos.
George held his hand to his heart and sighed in defeat. "Oh Freddie, how will we ever deal with being beaten by Harry?" Harry gave a little chuckle at them, but it didn't reach his eyes like a normal laugh would.
"Yeah, that sounds about right," Harry said truthfully and giving the Slytherin a little poke in the arm. He then got lost in his train of thoughts as he stared at a ladybug crawling around on a single piece of grass. Just by being with the blonde Slytherin, his heart takes a leap, and he feels so light and excited. Draco is just so beautiful with brilliant bright pretty silver eyes, soft-looking perfect whitish blonde hair that shined in the sunlight and such a handsome face. Oh, Harry could just go on about how amazing and attractive the Slytherin wizard is.
"That's true, I've been there myself," Ivy said straightforwardly and gave Lavender a little smile. Everyone looked at her in disbelief. "It's amazing there! There's even a magical passageway that leads to a muggle lake. It's gigantic. There are swans, ducks and all sorts of birds."
Harry burst out into laughter. "Me? Liking Malfoy?" He couldn't stop laughing even if his face was reddening more. How could he like such a git?
"It was incredible!" Harry says in a dreamy-like voice, making Hermione giggle because of how lovestruck he seems. "He made me feel so many things at once. I felt so warm inside, those butterflies were filling up my stomach and my heart... it was beating like a mini drum."
"Harry, what exactly are you implying?" Ginny asked and shifted uneasily on the stair. Now she was feeling a little worried for her older brother now.
Hermione looked as if she didn't believe Harry, but she didn't leave a comment about it. "Harry?" she asked softly, bookmarked the page in her book and put it down on her lap, closed. "Are you alright?"
Ivy didn't seem to notice the boys at all. She actually looked disappointed that the Beaubaton students didn't sit at the Slytherin table and sat with the Ravenclaws instead. Pansy seemed to not care at all. Her eyes were directed at the Gryffindor table.
Draco saw the dullness in Harry's eyes and frowned. He really worried for his boyfriend, wanting so much to help but doesn't know how. All he can do is tell Harry and show how much he loves him, and to listen to Harry whenever he's talking about deep things. "Let's head to class," he said and hid his worry with a little smile and gave Harry a kiss on the neck. "I don't want us to be late."
Harry sighs, bids farewell to Mrs Figg and thanks her for the news, and puts the lawnmower away in the shed out the back. He walks inside only to see his Uncle rushing up to him with a red face but becoming a purple colour in anger and humiliation, and a belt in his hands. Harry swallows uncomfortably but gets down on his knees, practically begging his Uncle to get it over and done with.
"Spaghetti Bolognese, please," Ivy said while she was licking her lips hungrily and sat down at the table. There was garlic in the meal she wanted, she knew that but she can easily stomach it. She forgot the House-Elves were here in the kitchens with them as she could hear the clatter of utensils and pans, but the elves were out of sight.
Harry nodded and took a sip of his orange juice. He heard Fred and George whispering something on the lines of, 'Get ready!' 'This is going to be hilarious!' 'Any minute now!' What the bloody hell are they up to now? He knows they've been planning something and want to find out what.
"I have my ways, Harry," Draco said softly, now looking down at his feet again and finding something interesting in them. "Ivy's in her 6th year at Hogwarts if you didn't know. Apparently, you two met during the Quidditch cup."
Harry was about to answer but was interrupted by Seamus. The Irish Gryffindor chuckled at his dorm mate who entered late, "Oh, I'm sure he was off with Malfoy somewhere, possibly snogging in some dark corridor somewhere."
"I guess you're welcome, Ivy," Harry says and as he sits up, his hand finds its way to Draco's, but he quickly brings his hand back to his lap. Like Draco could sense his need, he reaches for Harry's hand and he intertwines them together with a smile. Harry's a little surprised at the meeting of hands, and he smiles. But then he sighs as he really shouldn't leave Ron alone on Christmas day. It's nothing Ron should have to go through. "I think I should... erm... head back. I don't want to leave Ron alone on Christmas Day."
Harry noticed Ivy's reaction and frowned, knowing the answer to his questions. He looked beside him at Draco, wondering why he's at Hogwarts instead of being with his family. "Draco, why aren't you spending Christmas with your family?"
Harry blinks at him, thinking he heard wrong. "What was that?" he asks softly and sits up too, staring into silver irises that shine with an inner glow.
Harry remembered the hat saying the exact same thing to him. He chuckled at the antler horns on top of Draco's head and he had to admit that they kind of suit him and made him look... handsomely adorable. "The antlers suit you; you know?" he said as he felt his face redden with a blush that snuck up from his neck.
Harry sat on the dark lounge chair in 12 Grimmauld place. He could tell Ron was looking at him like looks could kill and Hermione just didn't know what to do in this situation.
"It was wonderful until I saw your son just sitting around doing nothing while poor Harry over here is doing all the yard work," Mrs Figg says bitterly, and her stare at Vernon lacked complete warmth. "It's not fair that your son's just sitting up on that chair watching Harry do all the work that should be split equally amongst your family."
All Harry could manage to say is an "Mmm" before he drifts off to sleep in the warmth and comfort of Draco's arms. The Slytherin smiles and presses a gentle kiss to Harry's forehead. Merlin... this round of lovemaking was incredible and he couldn't wait for the next one. Just as he closed his eyes, they shot open when the curtains to Harry's side of the bed were forced open and the head of Blaise Zabini appeared.
Ivy watched her go and then looked back at her cousin, giving him an unimpressed look. "I'm a little disappointed right now but that will fade," she told him, sighing. "Off you go then! I don't want you late to class."
"It's from your mother," came the familiar and calm voice of Blaise Zabini. Draco looked over to him, and Blaise cracked an eye open to glance at him. "Not to be a snooping little git but I may have read through it and," he smirked, "all I'll say is it's a damn surprise."
He faked a smile at the students who glanced over at him every so often. He knew that if he could feel the pain and sting of his metal blade across his skin, it could do a lot more than keep one emotion away. He saw Ron and Ginny glaring at Hermione and himself from the other side of the hall. He felt really guilty that it seems he'd ended Ron and Hermione's friendship just talking about being gay and such. He doesn't deserve such a great friend like Hermione. He deserves to be alone.
Draco placed a hand on the entrance, which somehow turned into a mirror. He slid his hand across the mirrors when moving left, hoping he comes across an exit but there was nothing. "I guess we go forward."
Draco felt his face and neck go warm at the sudden compliment, especially with the word 'pretty' coming from Harry's mouth. He just feels like skipping through the corridors of Hogwarts with a smile now. Merlin, this is how Harry makes him feel. "I hate to admit this, but I would still have to insult you and your friends."
Rebecca gagged as her throat was slit with blood gushing out of her neck. Obviously, she was acting this out but making it seem as real as she could. She fell to the floor, clutching her throat.
Aunt Petunia opened the door and wrinkled her nose at the mess called Harry's room. "Come down and start breakfast before your uncle wakes up, unless you want a morning punishment from him," she ordered. She was about to turn around and close the door when she added, "and clean this room after your chores today!" She gave her nephew a disapproving glare as she shut the door and left.
"Are they having a BLOODY party without me!" Pansy snapped and pushed her way through the double doors. She paused and flushed when everyone in the room looked at her. Why were the killers all dancing in the...whatever this place was? But she also saw students in their robes and pyjamas, the dead students she saw. Nobody died...
Draco turned around, hands supporting his weight on the sides of the dresser and leaned forward to give a quick kiss to Harry, not seeing the golden egg in the sight of his eyes. Harry kissed back eagerly and snaked his hand up and around Draco's neck, pushing him closer to the blonde. Draco leaned away with a smile and flicked his wand at the muggle music player beside him, turning it on and it started playing a song. It was Seven Wonders by Fleetwood Mac.
Harry nodded again, liking that idea. Good lord, he needs the help in Potions otherwise he will be failing the class in a matter of months. He doesn't actually want that. He wants to pass so he can get a good enough job. "That sounds very fair."
Harry hesitantly looked back at the angry face of Vernon Dursley, and just as he expects it, he gets slapped in the face again and pushed back against the wall of the stairway. Vernon threw him onto the floor, then kneeled down, and he started punching him with his fat sausage fingers. First in the nose, where a crack could be heard, from both his nose and glasses. Then in the mouth, which knocked a tooth out, and finally he resided to just punching Harry repeatedly in the ribs and in the stomach. It didn't seem like he was satisfied until he heard a crack, and Harry coughed up a bit of blood. Just like that, Harry's whole world crumbles to his feet, and Vernon kicks him in the ribs and gets back up to his feet only to go to his son and ask what happened.
Harry blinks at the sight of Draco below him, so handsome and perfect with his high cheekbones, and sharp jawline, shiny silver eyes, pointy-natural pink lips, soft white-blonde hair, and a beautiful pink tinge to his cheeks. He smiles and looks around them, seeing no Ron, Blaise, or Ivy in his sight. He looks back down at Draco and bites his lip.
Draco smiled to himself at the thought of actually dating Potter. Just the thought of being with him all the time, hugging, snogging, and going on dates with him always made his stomach flip but in a good way. "Yeah, well. That will happen when it feels right."
Draco frowns, not wanting Harry to go at all. However, he knows Ivy would need to talk to himself alone, like she always does. "See you, Harry," he says while he rubs Ivy's back soothingly in the hug. "It was great talking to you."
The professor noticed the two boys coming from the classroom and smiled. "Ah, boys. Glad you can make it," he said and gestured them towards everyone else in the class. He then looked over the crowd of his students, finding someone to get the rest of his pupils. "Can someone fetch the rest of my class, please?"
"To answer your question, my Dragon... Yes, your father is gay, but he doesn't want to admit it," Narcissa whispered to him with a smile as she was out of Lucius' hearing range. "Your father always did what his father asked of him without an argument. Even though he hated most of the things he was ordered to do, but he wanted to impress his own father. We just had extremely strict parents that made us marry into pureblood families. However, I don't regret a thing about our marriage. Yes, your father can be a bit...weird sometimes...most of the time...but I do love him."
Draco woke up bright and early on Saturday morning for the date. He took his time to get ready as it is a lunch date and lunch was five hours away. He put on casual clothes and tried to find something that looked muggle enough to wear which was a black button-up shirt with black jeans. When he was dressed, he headed down to the kitchens to grab some breakfast. The smell of French Toast was amazing. He walked in silently, grabbed a plate and placed a French toast on the plate from the pile and snuck out so he wouldn't be seen. He began eating the toast, his taste buds flaring from the heat of it. He opted to take a long walk around the grounds of the manor to pass the time.
“You don’t see it?” Harry asks him sadly, thinking he is probably going crazy. But the only thing keeping him sane is that he can feel the creature, whatever it is. “You don’t see this bat-looking horse?”
"Okay," Harry said. Right now, he just wanted to get away. It was nice talking to Seamus and Dean, but he feels as if he needs a longer walk. To reduce some stress and anxiety. "It was good seeing you again, but I have to get back... Bye." He didn't even wait for their reply as he walked away, with a frown.
Hours later when Harry was falling asleep, he dreamt of Draco, and a scene which he and Draco are under the Willow tree and are leaning towards each other. Harry smiled in his sleep as he knew they were going to kiss and kiss they did. He watched himself and Draco, his hands in Draco's soft blonde hair, and Draco's hands cupping his face as they kiss in a loving manner. What a beautiful dream.
"Can I," Draco kissed him. "Stay," A kiss. "In Gryffindor," Another kiss. "With you tonight?" One final kiss.
"I am finally Done at last!" She said with a smile and guided them through The Three Broomsticks until they found a seat together on the left side of the restaurant. "Harry, may I please use Hedwig to deliver my parent's presents?"
Joslyn snorted and shook her head. Never in her life would she ever have sex with a guy or try to. Hence the reason why she's a lesbian in the first place. "No, mate." She shook her head again. "We didn't do the do. But if you were a girl, however... You get the jiff." Then she asked, "What's your preferences?"
"Sure, I would like that," Draco says, and he intertwines his hand with Harry's and walks with him out of the Great Hall and away from the music flowing and echoing through the corridors and hallways of Hogwarts. "Where would you like to go?" he asked when they're safely away from the Great Hall.
Ivy remembered the promise she made Draco do, she really wanted to change the subject so she wouldn't begin to feel even more depressed. Some memories, although good, really bring back negative thoughts. "You still have that promise I want you to do."
Harry grabbed himself a slice of pudding with whipped cream and a cherry on top instead of his usual Treacle Tart. He's never had pudding before as it's usually on the other side of the Gryffindor table and he's just been too lazy to get it. And the first spoonful he had, he loved it. But it wasn't as good as Treacle Tart of course.
"I'd rather do it in a bed or on a couch, preferably away from people," Draco whispered back. This was quite a funny conversation to have on the train. But Merlin, he will allow Harry to do anything he wants. He began running his tongue along with Harry's mouth and down his jaw.
Firenze sighed and trotted off back to Blaise with a smile on his face. He was glad the wizard's little prank worked on Harry's boyfriend. Draco was so jealous, it was quite amusing to watch and see how rilled up the blonde Slytherin got.
Harry felt a pang of guilt as he watched Ron stiffly try to sit down at the Gryffindor table on Thursday night. Harry had been practising stunning spells that afternoon and Ron had kept missing the pillows that Hermione had placed for him to fall onto.
"Sure, I'd love to have your company," Harry said with a tired smile and a nod as he knows he won't be able to do it alone. He would need his boyfriend there to comfort him. He really didn't know about this therapy appointment thing and if he should do it, but he would do anything for Draco. And he will do ii for Ivy too so she's not doing it alone too.
Ron nods back and heads up to the dormitory with Harry just to put his presents in his trunk. Harry does the same and puts everything he was gifted in his trunk. Even the items on his bed he put in his trunk just so he can follow Ron down for breakfast.
"I believe you, Draco," he says softly with a little nod and leans away from Draco's head. He's getting a feeling that Draco knows of his depression, but he can't have. He hasn't discussed the topic with anyone before besides Ivy. But she told him she will keep it a secret. Did she break the promise? "I just..." He can't do it. He can't tell Draco otherwise when he's alone again he would think negatively of himself.
Draco finished his sentence with a smile, "Like you. Me too, Harry Potter." The rain began to pour down a little harder, soaking both their shirts but neither man cared. "I have done for a very long time as I can remember," Draco added.
Draco looked at Harry sadly, wondering why someone so amazing could be treated so badly like a house-elf. Harry sniffed, leaned closer to Draco and continued, "So, as I got older, they always made me do servant stuff. C-cleaning, gardening, ironing, cooking. I-if I do something badly, Uncle Vernon would... h-hit me or b-belt me. I- was teased as a kid, 'cause of my scar... and... I never had it easy. But that won't excuse all the things that he did to me. I couldn't accept that I was never accepted at their house or even in the muggle world. Because I had shed too many tears, I fell into... this depression. I was called names but it was all the same. I was feeling so rejected by everyone."
Ron hugged his best mate, really thinking hard about these nightmares his best mate was having. First, they were dreams about Voldemort and now dreams about his own family? Bloody hell! What was happening to his friend? He really was pondering about asking his mother about this nightmare. Maybe she could help Harry?
"Let's go with you'll talk to a Shadowman at 3 am while everyone's still sleeping," suggested Fred as he rubbed his thumb over his bottom lip in thought. "You'll plant a deadly flower and it'll bloom exactly when Mars pasts Jupiter in a few months' time. You'll trip over Ms Norris and make her fall down the stairs and break a few bones. Oh, and house elves will replace the caviar for fisheyes."
Harry returned to the Burrow for some dinner, even though he vomited it all up afterwards. He just felt worse after vomiting, he just wished he could sleep an entire day or even week at times, so he doesn't have to deal with the emotional pain anymore.
"I care for people, not like my father ever does," Draco said with a smile towards the tent Harry could be in. He couldn't wait to see Harry's beautiful face and everything. "I'm more of my mother than my father, even though my father thinks I'm like him. And when I was younger, I sort of wanted to be like my father. That was until I realized how obnoxious and rude my father can be to others."
Elk antlers replaced Draco's deer antlers on top of his head and Draco felt the new antlers Harry gave him with his hand and pointed his wand back at Harry. "Anteoculatia!" Oh, it was so on! If he's going to be antlered up, so will Harry. But he likes seeing that charming smile form on Harry's lips, the lips he so wants to claim his own and kiss with all the love he has for the boy.
There were murmurs of disgrace throughout the boys' side of the room and giggles on the girls' side of the room. Not many people found this appealing, especial.ly Ron as he grunted loudly, clearly hating where this was going.
Neville, Seamus, and Dean nodded in agreement before snuggling under their bedsheets. It was indeed a tiring night full of dancing, eating, and more dancing.
Dean smiled back at the Slytherin girl and shook her hand as a greeting. Her hands were a little cold. Almost deathly cold. He's never shaken hands with anyone in a while. It almost feels alien. "It's a pleasure to meet you, Ivy. I'm Dean Thomas. This is my... this is Seamus Finnegan, and this here's Neville Longbottom." He pointed out to the two other wizards sitting next to him.
"I'll start," said Ivy and she immediately looked at Harry, smirking. She wondered how far the Gryffindor will let her go with this game. "Truth or Dare, Harry Potter."
Harry cut him off, smiling and feeling his nerves flutter within as he says, "Will you go out with me, Draco Malfoy?"
"Yeah, thanks. I just can't wait until I unmask at midnight," said Harry, beaming while also adjusting his voice modulator to sound deeper. He just wants to see Draco and surprise him. "I've been waiting to get a kiss from Draco since lunch."
He placed a finger to his lip and sighed. "Oh, Draco. What are you up to at Hogwarts?" he asked the letter. He placed the letter down on his desk and walked around to sit in his seat. He began writing a letter in silence but his wife, Narcissa had knocked on his office door. "Come in."
"Farewell, Harry," Draco said with a wave goodbye. He turned to leave for the exit with a bright smile planted on his face. He heard Bagman's voice echoing throughout the arena, announcing Harry's scores. There was a moment of silence as the crowd did the math and a roar of excitement as they realized that Harry had tied Krum for first place. Unbelievable, Draco thought with a groan. How does he do that?
Harry shrugged. "Maybe an Auror. I don't know. People expect me to still save the wizarding world, but I don't know if I want to do that or not. Just surviving from Lord Voldemort was hard enough but putting myself in more danger by becoming an Auror and making more enemies." He took a quick sip from his tea. "No thank you."
Hermione saw the unfamiliar look in Harry's eyes and looked at him worriedly but shrugged it off as normal teenage behaviour. "Anyways, what shall we do?" Ron opened his mouth to say something, but Hermione quickly cut him off," And no, we're not playing Wizards Chess or Exploding Snap!"
Harry woke to the sound of shuffling and yawns from around him. He yawned himself and opened his eyes to come face to face with a sleeping Draco, something he likes to see a lot. He smiled at his boyfriend and softly ran a finger down his delicate face. When he saw Draco stir in his sleep, he drew his finger back and placed his hand back on the pillow. He watched as the Slytherin slept and how peaceful he looks. He wondered what Draco was dreaming of, that is, if he was dreaming. So, he just lay there, his eyes suddenly closing, waiting until Draco awakes.
"You wanted to see Harry, didn't you?" Cedric asked in a soft tone with a smile. Knowing the secret friendship Draco and Harry has, he just knows these two obviously care deeply for one another. It's honestly quite beautiful. Too bad they can't see their love for one another.
"I think I saw a guy with a pigface take him somewhere," said Seamus, too busy looking for Dean in the crowd. All he wants is his Dean. He cares about nothing else besides Dean.
Draco heard a silent "Good luck" from beside him, which he would have thanked Blaise for, but was too pissed with him and Pansy at the moment.
Hermione, Ron and his family gasped at what they just witnessed but before Ron could say anything back, Mr Malfoy made an appearance and behind him came Hagrid. “Son, Harry, there you are!” came Mr Malfoy’s panting breath. Everyone could tell he’s not the one for exercise at all. “Don’t scare me like that! You could have been kidnapped and I wouldn’t have known.”
"Sit up, Harry," Draco says as he reached underneath Harry with his saliva-coated fingers and as Harry sat up, raising himself from his seat on Draco's thighs, and he looked down into Draco's desperate face, Draco slid the first finger inside. Harry's eyes widened a little and he gasped at what the Slytherin was doing, trying to get him ready.
"You gave me the feels, Harry," Hermione said with a hand to her heart and gave him a soft expression. She swore she nearly cried tears of joy twice. "It was like watching a gay Hallmark movie. So beautiful and romantic."
He shook his head; he shouldn't be thinking this. He's probably already married to some pure-blooded witch with a kid. Another kid named after a constellation. But naming a kid after a constellation sounded pretty... interesting. Imagine naming a girl Aries and she's actually born in between the months of March 20th and April 19th. That would definitely be something.
The professor really didn't know what to do in this situation. Has she ever had a student ask if they could keep something? No. "Miss Brown, it has no life," she said in her stern voice and watched as her young pupil's expression became gloomy. "It's been a cage for centuries now."
Hermione grabbed a hold of Crookshanks and gently lifted her up from her lap. She closed the compartment door silently and sat back down. She didn't want the Slytherin's hearing their conversations. Especially if it had something to do with sexualities. Crookshanks swished her tail at her owner and sat staring out at the window wishing that pesky rat was still around to chase.
He used his teeth to graze along the swollen length, loving the sound of Harry's torment above him. He felt his hair being pulled into painful fistfuls and pulled his head away so that his scalp screamed at him to stop it, but the stinging sensation merely pushed his need to please Harry higher.
Harry smirked and collapsed backwards onto his bed again. Silver eyes had entered his mind and he just couldn't get rid of them. Thanks a lot, Ron, and Hermione.
Draco rolls his eyes with a smile and ushers Harry under the table. "Fine, get under the table then," he says and moves his legs under the table. When Harry crawls under the table, Draco starts for Harry by unzipping his fly all the way and before he has a chance to pull down his white boxers for Harry, a hand swatted his hand away. He then feels a tongue on his prick and groans a little.
Harry ran and ran, looking back again and kept running until he was at the park. He raced through the park, jumping over small shrubs, ducking from low tree branches and zig-zagged through the lines of trees. He looked behind him for what felt like the 30th time, didn't see Dudley or his friends and ducked behind a tree. Panting, he glanced around his surroundings again but there was still no sign of his cousin.
Harry blinked; he still had to ask Draco about what happened in class the other day and What Draco wanted to ask him. "So, the other day in class..." he said and trailed off a little. He blinked again and thought about how to say this. "I forgot which class it was to be exact and you were going to ask me something. Do you by any chance remember what it was?"
Harry finally looked up at Hermione, still feeling the overwhelming depression drown him to the depths of his emotions. What he needed was an escape. "Sorry, I need to go," he mumbled and then got up and left the Great Hall, not caring where he went. He just wanted to be alone. He wouldn't go to any of the secret places Draco had shown him, no. He decided to head to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom as it is the only place that he feels safe with his sharp friend which he really needed right now.
Harry shrugged and looked out the window into the cold chilly morning. It really was beautiful outside, but he prefers snow. Nice white snow. Whitish blonde... He shook his head, sending the sudden thought of Malfoy away. "Maybe we could go for a walk?"
The exhilaration that Harry felt after the meeting at the Hog's Head disappeared when word spread of Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four. Hermione, Ron, and he debated hotly whether or not to try and hold the meetings. It was only when Dobby told him about the Room of Requirement that he realised that maybe it would be possible. He was willing to risk.
Draco and Harry nodded and followed her to the photographers taking group photos. They spotted Pansy, Blaise, Ron, and Ivy in one group who were positioned in front of the large white fir trees. They hurried over just so they aren't wasting the photographer's time. Ignoring Pansy's rants about where they've been, Harry and Draco joined the two other boys on the floor while Hermione joined the girls standing up.
Malfoy then rolled his eyes as he grabbed Harry's quidditch robes as Harry did the same to Draco's. They both shared one last heated and amused look before they fully leaned in, their eyes fluttering closed as they moved closer.
Harry groaned and threw his beeping alarm across the room. It was magically made so it didn't break when it hit the wall. Then he remembered what day it was. It was the day he goes out with Draco. He smiled as he hopped out of bed and searched his closet for something to wear. He started to get anxious a little, wondering what he could wear on the date with Draco. A suit? Uh, no, too fancy.
Ron nodded, giving him narrowed eyes for the little insult but left it be. He got up from his seat and followed Harry out of the classroom to the Courtyard. Professor Flitwick was already there with half the other students from the class.
Harry pointed his wand at Draco's robe as he had a spell in his mind, and he thought of the Gryffindor colours. "Colovaria!" He said and watched in amusement as Draco's Slytherin robe turned into a Gryffindor robe, just without the Gryffindor crest.
"Because you're closest to the ingredients storeroom," Harry muttered and he had a downcast countenance. It was true. Ron was closer to the ingredients storeroom than he was. In fact, why were they fighting over who's going to get the ingredients? It's just so childish.
Harry forced a little chuckle and leaned his head on Draco's shoulder, staring in front of them towards the Flower Meadow. "That's my rebel boyfriend," he said and gave a half-smirk at his boyfriend. "And your mother?"
"Harry, Harry, Harry," said George with a shake of his head, a little disappointed that Harry's forgotten about the one thing he has that can find someone in a matter of seconds. "You're forgetting that we don't need to search when you can just use the Marauders Map."
When Harry got close enough to him, Draco grabbed him by the waist and pulled him down onto the bed with him. He smiled at the Gryffindor with green eyes who's on top of him, and he wrapped his legs around Harry's bottom. "We haven't been alone like this since our first date," he whispers, and he bites his lip at the possible events that could take place in his bed in the future with Harry. But he shouldn't be thinking about that now. "We should do this more often."
Draco began to wonder what he and Harry can do on their date in the muggle world. But he and Harry cannot use magic out of Hogwarts, of course. Unless he wants to have his wand taken off him which will never happen. He knows the rules and laws of the Wizarding World and will never break them.
"Harry, it's great seeing you again," Cedric said with his charming smile after witnessing something he knew was exciting for Harry, and he wondered if it was Harry's first time. But that's also why he's here to see Harry. But not just that. "I see your relationship with the Blonde has progressed into something more?"
"Typical," Draco said with a nod which earned him a nudge in the ribs by Ivy. He grunted and rubbed at his side where she nudged him. It kind of hurt but he knew why she was like this: her mother. Her darn mother who he hasn't seen in a year and doesn't plan on seeing ever again.
Savannah and Chelsea's eyes widened in surprise and they looked at each other. They didn't think their wizard headmaster would actually know of Gandalf. They wanted so bad to ask the headmaster if he could conjure them booth up some Gandalf robes but was a little shy to ask. The other two girls just gave the Headmaster odd looks.
Draco smirked a little and realized that Harry was actually liking the flavour of the jam. He did too. Lemon was his favourite flavouring in nearly everything. Some say it's weird, but he doesn't. "That wasn't so hard now, was it?"
"Potter! This is not the time and place. And I'll have you know that it is obvious to me you were a flame since first-year.
Hermione continued, "Neville Longbottom? Theodore Nott? Ernie McMillian? Justin Finch-Fletchy? Wayne? Zacharias Smith? Stephen? Kevin? Draco Malfoy?"
"That's why I'm asking you, Harry-kins," George said and span Harry around in the dance, grinning a little at how well his favourite little non-blooded brother is doing at dancing. It appears his twin has taught Harry well. Maybe he can teach Harry a little something too.
"Give Harry a compliment whenever you see him next and ask how his day has been," Ivy whispered into Draco's ear. "And you know that Harry likes you back. Remember the Yule Ball? He was practically staring at you in a loving way. Not to mention the kiss you both shared."
"So, are you really mad or just a little?" Draco couldn't help but ask because the thought of ever hurting Harry really saddened him. He knows Harry's going through something just as the way he's been watching him. He notices how depressed he looks, and how his eyes look lifeless to the world, and it's easy to tell when the Gryffindor hasn't been sleeping by the bags under said eyes.
Ivy sighed and let them go to class, and wished she were two years younger so she could be in their class. "Bye then!" She then remembered she had a spare instead of class right now. She grinned and thought a trip to the library to read would be quite nice.
Harry looked at her as she said the last name. But one thing was sure, he didn't want to be found out this easily. Even if he did have a crush on Draco Malfoy - which he doesn't - he can assure that.
Draco looked around, seeing nobody, and sighed in relief. He didn't want to be caught in the act of saying, "I'm sorry for hexing you the other day." He really was sorry for what he had done. He hated losing Harry because of it.
Fred guided Harry slowly around the dance room, making sure not to knock into others dancing. Harry took dancing with Fred an advantage, he was tired of girls asking him to be their Yule Ball partners. So hopefully they will see now that he's not really interested in females, only males and one by the name of Draco Malfoy. However, he'll keep his crushes' identity a secret because he doesn't exactly know if Draco likes him back. People have been saying that he likes him back, but they could only be guessing.
Harry gave a little half-smile as he sits down on the other side of Draco and Ivy next to Blaise and puts his plate of pancakes down. He then sees Ivy's phone on the table but thinks nothing of it. As much as he would rather Draco call Ron by his given name or just Weasley, he doesn't mind if it's still 'Weasel'. It's a little funny and he admits it.
"About controlling my loathing of Gryffindors, and my friendship with you," Draco said with a sideways glance towards Harry, and he gave a small smile at Harry. He wondered how Harry would look with a rose placed on his ear.
Harry bit down on Draco's tongue and sucked on it hard. It was delicious as always. He was delicious as always. Draco moaned silently from the gesture and entered his tongue into Harry's mouth. Harry opened his mouth wide enough for Draco to explore him and felt Draco's tongue twine with his own. Draco licked around the inside of Harry's mouth, tasting him endlessly. Harry trailed his hand down Draco's shirt, to his pants and pressed his hand against Draco's prick.
"Maybe," said Harry. Although, having a Chevy sounds pretty cool but they're bloody expensive now. "I wouldn't want it to turn into Christine, though."
"I'm not sure anymore," Draco said with a light shrug, not even knowing himself what happened. He really misses Harry and wants him back in his life. Harry has made him much happier than ever in his lifetime. He... loves him. "First, we were becoming friends and now... I feel so bad." He sighed and laid his head on Ivy's shoulder, hoping he would get Harry's trust again.
Harry sighs miserably as that's all he really needed to hear. "Oh," He says sadly and rattled the bottle of pills in Dudley's sight, half smiling at him. "Goodbye then." Dudley rolls his eyes and slams the door in his cousin's face.
Harry nodded, he looked over Cedric's shoulder and saw Draco walking towards the Transfiguration Courtyard with his robes billowing behind him. Such a pretty sight to see with that blonde hair he wants to feel in his fingers, and those silver eyes that always makes something inside him flutter, those lips that he wants to feel against his own... "I don't think magic can be cheated on."
"We're really sorry about our little Ronny and Ginny," George said with a cracked voice, and he rubbed at his nose. He hoped it wasn't all because of him and Fred that their younger siblings were raised like this. "It's a shame. We thought we raised them way better than this."
Harry grabbed small pieces of grass and slowly ripped them apart, anxious to how Cedric would take him coming out. He had already come out to Sirius and Hermione; how bad could it be?
When he brushed some long strands of hair away from Draco's cheek, Harry watched those big silver eyes open and look up at him.
"I will try," said Draco and gazed off at a skull candle that lay on one of the tables. Some of the items in the common room, he admits, are entirely creepy. "But if I get too distracted by him it'll definitely be harder on me. He's bloody gorgeous!"
Dudley elbows Harry hard in the rib, making Harry hiss and clutch at his ribcage. "You really think you will ever find love?" he sneers as they walk past a few more girls, and he stands tall and winks at them. The girls giggle and quickly run off. It made Dudley feel proud. "Because a face and body like yours, I believe nobody would love you. Your mother and father even died because of how ugly you are."
Harry smiled at Draco's departing figure and cupped his own cheek. He then, after saying the password to the common room, walked through the tunnel and headed up to the boy's dormitory. There, he found Ron lying on the bed and staring up at the roof. "So, how was your Christmas, Ron?" He just wanted to ask even if he knows his best mate would have spent it with Blaise.
He rushed over to his cousin so he wouldn't fall splat on the floor, and from behind, he tried to make his cousin vomit the pills up by pushing into his stomach with his hands. He could feel Harry slowly slipping away, and this ooze was coming from the inside of his cousin's mouth which was just disgusting and smelt like chemicals. "Come on, you prat!" He continued pumping Harry's stomach until he heard a gagging and vomiting sound, so he sighed with relief but kept pumping his cousin's stomach.
Snape handed the port key to Harry and smirked, hoping he'll never see the brats again. "Have a safe trip, Potter, Granger and Weasley," he said coolly.
"Did you all know that Lavender lives on a farm?" Hermione asked them. She didn't let her friends reply back as she spoke once again. "I've heard her talking about it to Padma in the dorm. It's apparently quite big. And her house, though I haven't been there, is one of those American Quaker barns. It's been in her family for years. Part of her pureblood heritage." She then sighed and gathered her stuff so she's ready to leave the classroom. "Let's go back to the dormitory."
Harry's heart flutters in his chest, and he smiles down at Draco lovingly. What could he say back? "Your beauty makes the morning sun look like a dull glimmer," he speaks in a soft tone, and Draco just freezes, smiles, and then blushes from the compliment.
Pansy began to panic, and she shuffled back a little, but it only made the barrel they were in start to spin and they all lost their balance.
Harry smiled at the centaur's warm greetings. Odd, but nice greetings. "Hello Firenze, it's so good seeing you too."
She then looked over at Draco and his messy hair. She decided to feel it, because why not? It looked so soft... It was definitely soft and smooth, especially when he was a ferret.
Neville crossed his arms on his chest. "Name's not Longbottom, remember?" he said with a grin, but he really didn't mind being called his last name. He prefers his first name though. "Also, that's okay. Ask him out when you feel comfortable."
The girl crawled towards the tv, and when everyone didn't expect it, she crawled right through the panel of the tv.
Ivy remembered the talk they had a night ago and chuckled. Then she remembered his face and how red it is. "By the way, your face is very red," she told him earnestly. "You should read chapter 342 of your charms book, Dray." She reached into her robe pocket and took out her round makeup mirror, opening it up so the mirror faced Draco.
Harry, Cedric, and Fleur all headed back up to the castle and to their dormitories for the rest of the day, until it was lunch or dinner. As Harry opened the Pink Lady's portrait to the Gryffindors common room, he was greeted with every Gryffindor he knew and didn't know. He gave them all a fake smile while they congratulate and applaud him, much like after he got the egg. Harry honestly needed some rest, so he walked past everyone, and made his way up to the dormitory.
"You and Malfoy?" said a disapproved, disgusted tone of voice from behind them. It was like the person hasn't seen Harry and Draco kissing at all. It's like they were just born today.
Blaise grimaced at the eyes that stared at Pansy, then they looked directly into his own eyes and his heart began beating wildly in his chest out of fear.
"I assume so," Narcissa said, patting her son's head. "If not, give him something harder to do. It's quite funny watching Lucius doing such nice Hufflepuff things."
"Draco, I never got to say goodbye," Harry reminded him with an obvious fake frown, which Draco kissed away and turned into a smile. Draco pulled him closer gently and linked arms with him as it seemed they were heading up to Gryffindor Tower. He didn't mind if he has to stay in Gryffindor Tower because as long as he has Harry everything will be fine.
Draco's mouth fell open a little out of surprise. Harry had just asked him to be his date to the Yule Ball when it should have been him to ask Harry all along. But then he felt a little guilty as he didn't ask Harry in time. "Oh, I'm sorry Harry but I'm going with Pansy," he told him a little regrettably and scratched at the back of his neck. "We're going as friends, Pansy and I." He added that just so Harry knows it's nothing serious.
His nose picked up a scent from Harry that he just loves. Pine. Pine scented...he didn't know if it were Harry's shampoo/conditioner or if it was his cologne. He tried not to inhale too deeply but he just loved the smell. It was so relaxing and reminded him of taking a walk in a pine forest. It smelled so beautiful and utterly amazing. He wondered what it'd be like to wake up in the same bed as this amazing handsome young man and kiss him good morning.
"Yes, it is I," Draco said while smiling and guided Harry a few steps forward until he removed his hands from Harry's eyes and showed him what he had planned for them. He kisses Harry's cheek again, grabs his hand and leads him to the green, black, and white checkered blanket with a range of food in the centre of it.
Blaise walked side by side with Neville, accidentally touching his hand and apologising. Neville would say it's alright, smile with a deep blush to his neck and face, then look down. He is really proud to know that Neville is okay. If anything happened to him...
Harry watched the tip of Draco's tongue dart out and press into his skin. The sight made him squirm, bringing into focus just how close to his erection Draco's mouth was. He watched Draco sit back and pull down his green silk pyjama bottoms until that beautiful cock of his sprang free to be worshipped once again.
"Truth or Dare," Harry said and wonders just how daring these Slytherin's can be. He's heard of the Dares Fred and George do with the other sixth and Seventh years and they can get pretty weird. He's heard George ask someone to lick someone's shoe, to chew on someone else's chewed gum, and to get someone to take off one piece of clothing from someone else.
From there and on, Harry kept taking George to therapy, as well as keeping up with Draco and going on dates with him. Draco even started helping George out by paying for the tests that George had to do to get checked up. Harry refused to let Draco pay for anything but somehow, Draco did it under his nose.
"Oh," Serpentine said. He looked up at the boy, studying him from head to toe. "But you do not ssseem like an evil or bad boy."
Harry sighed, wishing the hug could last longer. Maybe some other time. Right now, they had to go to class and not be late. "Let's head to class before we get a detention for being late."
Draco climbed onto the bed and sat next to Harry. He reached for Harry's hand and held it in his. "That makes sense as I was also thinking that exact same thing," he said earnestly with a little nod. "I would also love to wake up with you by my side, Harry."
"Yes," Harry said with a nod as he looked down at himself in his dress robe and the shoes he got. He just couldn't wait until he walks through those doors into the Great Hall, though it will be nerving, and he sees Draco. He wants the first dance to be with Draco, but he knows he must dance with Fred. Unless Fred and Draco do a switcheroo and change dancing partners.
Ivy was one of the most stunning things she'd seen, her dark hair framing her perfectly sculptured face with its shadow-like appearance. The vampire was clearly something from another world and even though Lavender knew close to nothing about the girl, she wanted her. Merlin, she wanted her. No matter what she thought during the day or what she might try to convince herself of this was the naked truth.
Harry groaned, he still had to find shoes to wear. Shoes! He just picked up a pair of sneakers and decided that's what he'll wear, as well as the dark green turtleneck sweater and black jeans.
Harry stared up at the now, see-through Draco Malfoy. He wanted to run his hands through the soft-looking Whiteish blonde hair, but he'd think his hand would go straight through like he was a ghost. He then scanned Draco's face, that handsome face, those beautiful silver eyes, the sharp cheekbones and jawbones and his soft-looking inviting lips. Harry forgot he was staring until a warm hand lifted his chin up to meet perfect silver eyes. That hand gave Harry tingles all through his skin, like static electricity was pulsing through his veins. "I-, Uh-," he stuttered and swallowed. He just had a sudden urge to kiss him but in the bloody classroom. It'd just draw attention to them.
The trio all followed Harry up the street, dodging cars and cyclists who were on the road. "Aren't those people driving on the wrong side of the road?" Harry asked, trying to catch up to Hermione as he just kind of dozed out and thought about Draco's smile. Charming smile... Wait, what?
Draco nodded his head with a smirk, agreeing with his cousin. He's seen Blaise just lying in bed and staring up at the ceiling of his 4-poster. It was hilarious actually. "Yeah, that is quite true."
Draco twirled Harry around with a smile, and he whispered right into his ear, "Shut up and dance with me, Potter." Harry felt himself blush and let Draco lead in the dance. The next thing he knew Draco was holding onto both of his hands, he was leaning back onto Draco's chest and was swinging side to side.
Another one of Dudley's friends, a tall skinny boy with short wavy black hair and a pointy face with a strong British accent didn't leave with his friends and frowned at Harry. He turned his head to look at his departing friends. Well, so-called friends. He really didn't know why he was friends with those gits, the only reason why he was so close to them is because of his mother and father who are filthy rich and want him to have strong 'sidekicks'.
Draco's cheeks flushed slightly, "I know, don't let it get to your brain. I can't be helping you every day and night." Although, that thought did sound nice because he would be with Harry but utterly exhausting since they would both be doing potions every night which means they would have to carry their stuff all the way down here again. "So, who's going to drink the potion?"
Ivy reached into her robe pocket and pulled out what looked like a large, but thin, brick looking thingamajig with a black case and a teddy bear holding an axe that's saying, 'Don't touch my phone!' She liked the cover. It was kawaii but evil.
The boys sat down at the furthest desk and pulled out their textbooks. Draco searched through his textbook for something to try. With a spell in his mind, he closed his textbook and pushed it down three desks beside him. He pointed his wand at the textbook and said, "Accio 4th year Charms book!" The book flew towards him and landed in front of him on the desk. He smiled and cast the counter-spell. "Depulso!" The book flew back to where it was on the third desk beside him.
Harry yawned, too tired to deal with stressed teenage boys like himself who are overreacting to what they are going to wear. "No, it's fine Ron," he told him earnestly. He really would go out and buy his best mate a new dress robe. He's got plenty of Galleons in his vault that can probably last him a few twenty years or so. "I'll just get the cheapest dress robes in store, no second-hand clothes for you."
Harry shrugged as he said, "I don't know." He has never taken any language class while he was back in primary school so how would he know of anything related to Latin? But then he thought of the simple word for 'open'. "What's open in Latin? Maybe that word, whatever it is, will work for the door."
Draco swallowed down the lump in his throat and backed away slowly. He couldn't do this right now. He needed to run and hide. He had to get someplace safe.
"Fine...," Ron said, his direct stare lacked warmth and he rolled his eyes and started gathering his stuff up. Why couldn't the ferret just find his way back to Hogwarts on his own?
He sat on his bed in Ron's room and stared down at the wooden floorboards. He pondered what it would be like to have his mother and father alive. Would he still be...gay or would he turn out to be straight? Would he have the best life, or would he be one of the unpopular kids? He has always wondered what it would be like to actually speak to his mother and father, to actually have a conversation with them. Being with Sirius was like having a dad. He remembered last year when Sirius told him about some of the mischiefs, he and his 'Marauders' got up to. He remembers cracking up in laughter. Oh, how he misses laughing. Misses smiling for that matter.
Blaise looked at Harry curiously then to the masked man he's dancing with. "Neville?" He lifted the man's mask up and gasped in surprise. It was Neville. A blushing Neville.
He then turned around and hurried to the 4th year's boys dormitory, snaking his way through the male students and opened the door to the door beside the wooden sign which says '4th years. He freezes as Nott, Goyle, and Blaise look his way from on their beds. He checked himself again to make sure he was covered and he thankfully was. He looked over at Draco's bed, seeing him lying down on his back and looking up at the ceiling with all drapes around him closed except the one facing the door.
"The thought of Harry with another guy or girl always makes you sick, Draco," Ivy said sweetly, and she reached over to pat his shoulder. "It shows how much you love him and want him to be yours. So, if you complete the promise that I made you do then he can be yours forever."
"So, do you like him?" Joslyn asked, nudging him again and giving him a warm sympathetic smile. Secretly, she was screaming to herself, "OMG! DRARRY IS REAL!!!!"
"Oh," Harry says, and he sits a little uncomfortably on the seat, believing this could end badly. But what could Draco say that would be a little saddening about them? He hasn't seen Draco look at him oddly, or like he doesn't want to be friends. He realizes he's jumping to conclusions and shuts the voice out of his mind. "Okay... go on."
"I think I saw something red on the white book exactly when I was about to leave the aisle Harry and I were reading together in," Draco said in a clear voice just in case his best friend was somehow death and mispronounced a word for 'snogging'. The thought of snogging Harry sounds wonderful beyond imagination and something he really wants to do but he can't just go up to Harry and kiss him square on the lips.
"Brilliant!" said a boy who looked Italian and beamed at Harry. Harry recognized him as a boy named Blaise Zabini.
He really did not feel like getting up at all today, or even interacting with people. He zoned out, remembering the times he has been with Draco. The hugging. The kissing. The snuggling. The sex. How Draco makes him feel loved, how he flushes the sadness out of him.
"I like that idea as well," Draco said and got Harry back with a bump to the shoulders and a charming smile which made Harry's heart flutter in his chest. He smiled at his Harry and placed an arm around him, keeping him close to both his body and heart.
There was a pounding on the door. Both boys looked up at the compartment door and were glad the window curtains were down. Oh, what would they do if someone had seen them like this? It never happened the last time they made love on the Hogwarts Express two months ago.
Hermione nodded, thinking she knows exactly how Harry felt because she also wanted to read the last chapters of 'The Maze Runner'. She was nearly finished and had about five more chapters to go. Then after that, she will start some of the Agatha Christie novels.
"I-It's I-Ivy," Draco stuttered quietly, not wanting anyone to find out. He just couldn't, this was too hard. He needed to find her. "S-she tri-." He felt a pair of arms around him, giving him a hug. Such cosy and soothing arms. He felt Harry's head lean onto his shoulder. He loves Harry so much; he doesn't know how he could have reacted if he didn't have Harry here.
Harry was still thinking about whether he should tell Hermione and Ron about the truce with Draco, but also his sexuality. He knew he should though, just never know when to. He knew Ron would probably think that he had gone mental to make a truce with Draco, but Hermione would probably know sooner than later because of how smart she is. He also hoped Ron would accept him as being gay and pondered how Ron would take him to have a liking for Draco. Of course, Hermione already knew for how could she not? The brightest witch of her age nonetheless she was a muggle-born.
They didn't say another word to each other until they were back at the Willow tree, they dismounted their brooms. Harry grabbed his invisibility cloak, linked arms with Draco and pulled the cloak over himself and Draco. He smiled at Draco's surprised expression, noticing a slightly pink tinge to his cheeks, "I can walk you to the dungeons if you want?"
Draco frowned. If Harry wished that his life would be normal, would their friendship still be the same? Would he still share the same feelings for Harry? Well, of course, he would. Who doesn't love those spectacular green eyes...and those pretty soft lips...and his fluffy black hair?
Cedric opened the flap of another hospital tent and spotted Harry sitting on his bed, staring at the floor. "I'm good to talk to, Draco," he tells him. He knows the Slytherins have a disliking to Hufflepuffs which doesn't bother him at all. "If you want to talk to me about anything, just ask."
There were whistles coming from the crowd of students watching them, but they didn't care. They glided across the dance floor, waltzing past other people who were slow dancing and doing the Macarena. They waltzed past Seamus and Dean who were slow dancing together. Seamus and Dean were looking into each other's eyes lovingly, they even kissed a few times.
"Yeah, we did," said Harry as he distantly remembered what he and Ivy talked about. He remembers something to do with phones and Draco. "It was a nice chat. She's a nice girl." But what he asks himself is who her mother and father are. He doesn't know of any other Black family instead of the Purebloods. Wait... "Who's her mother and father if I may ask?"
Ivy walked sat down on the table beside him; she didn't want this to feel like it was her fault but deep down she believed it was. Pansy and Draco exchanged looks of worry and sympathy at Ivy, they both knew what she was thinking. That it was her fault.
"Actually, that is a smart idea!" Harry said and thought of a light bulb appearing over her best friends' head. It seemed real, the light bulb. She always comes up with the best and brightest ideas whenever it's needed.
Draco and Blaise now had tears in their eyes, Draco was trying to reach out to her, but Blaise was pulling him back, saying, "Come on Draco. We need to get out of here before...he comes after us too." They took no hesitation and ran away, as fast as they could, the blood on their slippers making it harder for them to run, to where the alive Hufflepuff's had run off to.
"Are you kidding me?" Padma asked the younger Ravenclaw who called the doll 'beautiful'. "You really believe that disgusting piece of ... material is beautiful?"
In a matter of minutes, Professor McGonagall came in from another tent and interrupted Harry's train of thoughts. "Mr Potter? Please come and join the others, it's about the egg and about the next task."
"Let's head to the boy's bathroom for the hairstyling," Ron said as he grabbed a small round tub of banana smelling hair gel from his trunk. It was a nice smell and he hoped Harry didn't mind it. On the way to the boy's bathroom, he said, "There are mirrors so I can see what I'm doing and so can you."
"Oh, my goodness, same!" said the chestnut-haired girl and she bumped shoulders with her friend. "I'm Zoe by the way. And this is Chelsea. We know we really should be doing our Muggle studies homework, but we pretty much know everything and use that time to catch up on some Doctor Who."
