*flashback*
”where were you Draco” “I was just returning a favor” I say calmly, filling my plate. “A favor?” “Yes Vincent, a favor. I just beat up Davy till we reached an understanding.” “You beat up Davy, cool” “Why, did he beat up potter again: When I didn’t answer Charlie started chuckling and even Marcus grinned. “Man, you do fancy him, and a lot to beat up a small troll for him.” “He doesn’t know I beat up Davy, he’s in the infirmary right now.” “Hey Draco, if you fancy him why do you let us beat him up, we could find someone else.” “Vincent, if he found out he would be disgusted with me.” “How do you know?” “Just leave it Vincent!” I snapped at him, huffing in satisfaction when he let it go. A few minutes of silence was all I got before he started talking again. “Why don’t you ask him out?” “By god Vincent, because he’s not queer.” I stated angrily, and for a few seconds they all stared at me before busting up laughing. “What’s so funny” “Oh my god Draco, why else so you think Potter’s bullied” Marcus chuckled before Daniel stopped laughing. “It’s not just because he’s a broken spirited boy who’s an easy target, it’s because he’s queer”. “So you all beat him up because he’s queer? Why the hell am I not picked on then?” “Geez Draco, because you stood up for yourself and actually intimidated the initiator, you know, the first bully everyone has at the beginning of first year. Harry was too weak, too short, to gentle, too scared to have stood up for himself against the initiator.” Marcus said frowning. “Oh, he probably didn’t make much of an impression then since I don’t remember him. “Most don’t” Marcus said before returning to his conversation with Daniel. I can’t wait for this weekend, this was the last day of school for two weeks since its spring break. Some kids stay here but I would never imagine staying here for that long of a break when I could see my beloved family. Sighing, I stood up with the guys and we head back to our dorms.
"Now, if I could once again ask for your attention! I'd like to announce that this year Hogwarts will be hosting the Triwizard Tournament!" Dumbledore started again. The Great Hall exploded with sound but the loudest of voices were the Weasley twins who both shouted
"Hermione over here!" Ron yelled. He and Harry took off down the path to find her. The rest of the group followed suit. Nobody wanted to be alone. They rounded a bend and there she was. She looked frightened. Tears stained her face. When the three of them reached each other they embraced each other in a group hug.
Also may have some angsty love triangle action.
They passed two kids chasing each other around on toy broomsticks. Next to their campsite a young couple watched a toddler walking across the grass.
Their train ride went by quicker than those in past. It felt like a familiar routine at this point. They had visitors filter in and out of their compartment. Seamus and Dean stayed for a while discussing the punishments they received for the events of the Quidditch cup. Their parents had been furious. Ginny stopped by to awkwardly ask how the rest of summer was. She ended up leaving with Dean and Seamus to hunt down the Trolley. Harry felt a bit of sadness as he watched her walk down the hall holding onto Dean's arm. Neville stopped by with tales of woe from his sad summer. His Gran had thought the Cup would be unsafe and after the scandal proved her right, Neville had lost hope of being allowed out of the house ever again. Fred and George brought Lee by to scare Hermione with his Tarantula's babies. By the time the castle had pulled into view it felt as though half of the school had filtered through his compartment.
A cute little house elf came from a small door in the back of the booth and started to take drink orders. She looked just like Dobby except for the squashed tomato looking nose that took up half her face and the cute little kitchen towel she was wearing as a dress.
Dumbledore stood and looked out at the crowd of eager kids. The final first year had taken his seat at the Hufflepuff table.
"Harry, I can't believe you said yes to this." Hermione whispered as they moved through the dark corridors. The three fourth years were the last to leave Gryffindor house. The Fourth years had agreed to go in small groups so as not to get caught. They were tucked under the safety of the invisibility cloak but Harry didn't know what the others had done to prevent being seen.
"Alright, last spin of the night and we can play something else." Seamus grumbled. He must've been grumpy that he hadn't gotten any action so far. Harry snickered at the thought. Seamus spun the wand. Everyone watched it go round and round, waiting silently with anticipation. As it slowed Harry's heart dropped to his stomach. The wand stopped right in front of him. His eyes slowly moved up the wand and to his horror, he saw that the wand had also landed right on Draco Malfoy. The other boy just smirked.
"We spent most of the time hurling insults at each other. Then he slapped me across the face." Harry lied. Ron narrowed his eyes as if he didn't fully believe the story.
They began to dig in. Harry took two of everything he could reach and finished it too. Since living with Sirius he had noticed that he put on more weight. He was no longer lean and lanky. He had started to fill out and gain more muscle. That meant that his appetite increased and he was able to eat much more.
"Hi Hagrid!" Harry called. The silhouette waved back throwing water in their direction.
Viktor Krum looked directly into Harry's eyes as they scanned the crowd. Harry waved but the players zoomed off again, this time to stop on the other side. They zoomed around the stadium two more times before flying to the ground. Then the Irishmen flew out, just as fast. Again they came to a stop, fairly close to Harry's booth. They pulled out their wands and shot green confetti from them, creating the pattern of a leprechaun in midair.
"I think it looks lovely!" She exclaimed.
"The name's Winky, sir. House Elf and personal assistant to Mr. Barty Crouch but for tonight, server to all of you's! I expected to see Mr. Kreacher here but I suppose he's just as grumpy as he ever was." She squeeked excitedly. Harry smiled.
"Luckily, since you three were so quick, we'll have an extra 20 minutes to get there. We should be there before the Diggory's even arrive." He explained. They all cheered. Harry had met the Diggory's a few times. Sirius had invited them over to the house for dinner every couple weeks to keep Harry from dying of boredom. The son, Cedric, was a Hufflepuff at Hogwarts and was a few years older. He and Harry could get to talking about Quidditch for hours if they wanted to. Sirius had even let Cedric borrow his broom so that he and Harry could play catch in a nearby field a couple times.
As they were ascending up the stairs, a lantern bobbed around the corner. Filch, accompanied by Mrs. Norris, ran down the steps just barely missing Hermione. His cat however barreled right into her legs and yowled in surprise. Harry signaled for them to start moving up the stairs around her. They had to get out of here. Filch's head snapped back and he ran back to Mrs. Norris who was pacing the step they had just been standing on.
He could blame the firewhiskey for his sudden lust for Malfoy. He could blame Malfoy. Deep down he knew it was him. Harry felt something besides hatred for his nemesis. If he were to keep feeding this feeling it would surely grow into a school boy crush that would leave him stuttering and fumbling worse than his attraction to Cho Chang. The thought of his friends finding out mortified him.
Fred and George led the way through the station to the barrier to Platform 9 3/4. They went first, Hermione followed behind. Harry and Ron ran together.
Ron was munching on one of their Never-Ending Cotton Candy sticks which a man had guaranteed would last all game. Hermione had already learned the name, age and skill set of every player that was planning on touching a broom via a booklet purchased at the information booth. Harry was just soaking up the culture.
"Mr. Crouch it's your house elf." Amos said gravely. Mr. Crouch turned on him.
The leprechauns had risen in the air again. They had taken the formation of a hand which was making a very rude sign at the Veela. At this, the veela lost all control. They began to change into bird like creatures, with beaks and wings. Then they started throwing fireballs at the leprechauns.
Harry took a seat in the front row. The rest of the kids sat up there with him, his best friends on either side. Sirius and the rest of the adults took the second row. They got comfortable and started to chat about the game.
Suddenly the doors shot open, nearly smacking Harry and Ron in the face.
"It wasn't us," Hermione interrupted, explaining the obvious, "The spell came from over there."
"They're going to notice us missing soon. I say she's in." Harry decided looking to the other boys for help. Ron sighed and turned to keep down the stairs, completely oblivious of Harry's realization. He looked back to Ginny and gestured down the stairs in front of him. Her cheeks started to redden. She must've recognized the way he was looking at her. He felt his own cheeks get hot.
"Oh look, you woke the owl." Hermione scolded. Harry laughed again. He got up and opened the huge window so Hedwig could fly out. Then he closed it and sat back down.
"Harry?!" Ron?!" He heard shouting coming from down the path. Hermione was looking for them.
"Well, well, well, surprised to see you here, I guess. I don't know how Weasley afforded the ticket but I should've known he'd be anywhere you are, Potter." He spat looking down at them from his higher step. Harry stepped up to the landing he was on and got in his face.
"Now, for the details, the Heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in October with their short list of contenders. I believe it was about 30 students from each school. The selection will take place on Halloween after our great feast. An impartial judge will decide which students are the most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school, and a thousand galleons personal prize money." A hiss of excitement rippled through the crowd.
Lastly, I am sad to announce that we will not be holding our Annual Inter-House Quidditch Tournament this year."
"Um, hello? You're all in big trouble. That means no laughing or fun of any kind." Sirius interrupted. He had a stern look on his face but Harry knew he was joking. He had that twinkle in his eyes that he would always get when playing pranks.
"Oh, come off it, Barty. Some of our stun spells went that far. Let's check if we got them?" Diggory suggested, running in that direction. They watched him disappear in silence, daring not to even breathe. His brown-haired head disappeared into the dark. The man was bold.
"You should've seen Mum's face when she caught Fred sneaking some of their joke products in his pack." Ginny chimed in. That caused another loud laugh through the group as Fred and George launched into the story. They were just about done when Cedric and his father rounded the corner.
A green light burst from where he stood and rose into the air. He thought maybe it was another giant leprechaun but he soon realized he was mistaken. A glittering green skull with a giant snake hung ominously in the air above them. The shadow that had stood below was gone.
"You'll be using the bathroom across the hall." Sirius pointed out. Ron and Hermione joined them back in the hall.
"Our first victims are Dean from Gryffindor and Helena from Ravenclaw." Seamus announced. One of the Slytherin sitting at the desks got up and opened a closet door behind him. A couple of barrels stood against the back wall. Empty shelves lined the other two walls.
"That means no points taken from Gryffindor tonight boys." Seamus said.
"Let's go." He muttered nudging Ron. The boys slipped away and down the stairs to join the other two on the landing below.
"Where is that path?
The next morning everyone buzzed with excitement, especially Sirius. He hadn't been school shopping in decades and he was excited to do it with his his Godson and friends. They were all at the breakfast table dressed and eating by 8 am. Mrs. Weasley was frantically serving up eggs when sparks started to puff from the fire. A face was emerging leaving Harry's curiosity to spark.
"Oh, this isn't good. Can someone go slap that referee?!" Ludo Bagman chuckled. A mediwizard was out on the field seconds later running for Mostafa. He gave him a hard kick in the shin and the referee seemed to snap out of it.
"It's so rainy." He whined. Harry chuckled. They got out of the train with their fellow students and immediately regretted it. Rain and wind pelted them from all directions. The night was gloomy and the moon hid behind the clouds.They looked around the station and saw a giant silhouette through the gloom.
"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the four hundred and twenty-second Quidditch World Cup!!" His voice boomed. A small and skinny wizard marched out onto the field. He was bald but his moustache was huge. He was carrying a large wooden crate in one hand and his broomstick in the other.
"Did you get them?" He asked panting. "Them" being tickets to the Quidditch World Cup which Harry and Sirius had been planning on attending for over a month. Sirius smiled and waved the tickets in a flashy manner. Harry cheered and ran over for a hug. He broke away to look at the tickets. He studied them hungrily, adding to his anticipation.
"Goodnight Harry, try to get some sleep!" He called as Harry walked out of the room. Hermione was waiting by her door in the hall so Harry quickly caught up to her. He looked into her room to see Hedwig perched on the edge of her bed returning his gaze with her golden-orange eyes. Harry pulled down the long sleeves of his night shirt that he had rolled up earlier. He held his arm up and whistled. The snowy owl ruffled her feathers indignantly before jumping into the air and taking flight. Hedwig wasn't much for being summoned, she liked to make her own entrance. She soared around the room before landing gracefully on Harry's arm. Her talons just barely grazed his skin as she latched on for support.
"Students this is our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Professor Moody has extensive experience as an auror for the Ministry of Magic. I hope that you all will pay close attention to the wisdom he has to offer." Dumbledore announced. This announcement was met with dead silence. Not a single staff member or student knew how to react and clapping was the last thing on their mind. The man in the long torn coat stood and waved to the students. Whispers burst out throughout the Great Hall. His eyes searched the crowd until finally they both stopped and stared dead at Harry.
"And you kissed me back. You wanted to get in the closet with me. I stopped everytime you pulled away." Harry argued back. Draco shoved him but he didn't budge. He wasn't the scrawny boy that Draco had been teasing for years anymore. He stood up and moved so he was inches away from Draco again.
"We should probably split up. We can go find our group. You three could retrace Harry and I's steps back to camp." Ginny suggested making gestures between them all.
"They're going to crash again!" Hermione screamed, fearing the worst again.
"Hello Harry Potter. My name is Kingsley Shacklebolt." He said shaking his hand gently. His voice was deep, soothing. Harry was glad to hear this guy was basically his magical bodyguard. Harry shook his hand and thanked him. The man continued to help the other's up, introducing himself along the way. They said goodbye to the Diggory's who had their own camp site reserved a few rows away and started toward their own.
"Sorry, thought I saw a bug." She muttered, completely red-faced. Her brothers broke into laughter as she got up.
The trio made it back to their own floor uncaught. Harry wasn't sure how their drunken stomping feet hadn't been heard. Ron even fell over at one point having fell for the trick step. Hermione woke the Fat Lady and snuck through first. Ron and Harry followed.
"Goodnight boys, thanks for forcing me to come." She giggled, making her way up the stairs to her dorm. Harry was happy to see her letting loose. Though the night had gone disastrously for him, it seemed his friends had a good time.
He tried to remember his dream but the only thing he could remember was a cold high-pitched voice, one that he knew must belong to Voldemort. It had been a while since he had experienced any horrifying dreams to do with the wizard that killed his parents and this one had been particularly troubling. He looked around his dark room, making sure no ghoulish faces were hiding in the shadows. Once he was sure it was clear, he got out of bed and went down the hall to where he knew Sirius wouldn't be sleeping.
"Thank you." He whispered to Sirius as they embraced. The man had changed his life for the better. Harry knew this had to be the best night of his life.
"Mr. Bagman?" She called. Harry looked at her and then back to the forest's edge. Ludo Bagman stumbled onto the path. His hair was disheveled and his glasses askew. His color changing bowtie was partially untied and hanging from his neck. He looked pale and frightened. He must've seen what the teenagers in front of him had seen at the camp.
"Nah, they wouldn't. They couldn't." Harry remarked. She nodded.
"Harry! Harry! Harry! Harry! Today's the day. Come on, it's Quidditch day get up!!" A loud voice bellowed, interrupting his cozy dreamland. Harry's eyes shot open as the words being shouted through the room caught up with his brain.
"Viktor Krum gets the snitch, I'd bet five galleons." He decided. Sirius groaned and pulled out the little pouch he kept his money in. He handed over five galleons and Ludo Bagman wrote his bet down in a little book right underneath the twins names. Harry smirked.
"So, what made you want to be a healer, Malfoy?" asked Harry.
“Sorry, yes.” Harry was wrong. It was not enough of an answer for the blond. “My whole life, it was cursed from the start. Everyone believed the lies on the paper. Everything about me, my family, my friends.” The anger Harry had felt from Rita Skeeter resurfaced. “I just want to right their wrongs and spread some truth for a bit.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, they didn’t quite like the part where the chosen one ranks them, because he used them.” Draco just stared at him. “And the part where I said I was bisexual.” Draco’s mind froze. Bisexual. Harry liked men.
Attempting to bring Draco’s spirits up, Harry said, “What, be mean to a kid who was mean to you, like seven years ago?” As soon as he said it, Harry wished he would think before he spoke. He felt oblivious.
“Oh, hardly.” Draco seemed to blush and this time, he couldn’t hide it or blame it on anything else. He wasn’t drunk, he hadn’t been drinking and it wasn’t hot in Harry’s loft. Draco had blushed over how fond the two of them were becoming.
Harry had taken a good while to think of a response but nothing else sufficed. "Dumbledore was difficult, and he caused a lot more problems than I knew." He paused and took a sip of his drink. "And, people change." Malfoy scoffed at him.
He wasn't supposed to, but, Merlin, he did. Draco had only ever said how he truly felt once. It was a few days after Potter had defeated He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named for the final time. Draco and his mother had been hiding out after everything that happened. They only left due to a letter from the Ministry. They thought it best to go to the trial, fearing that if they continued to flee, the consequences would be even worse. So they showed up, both expected to be tortured and sent to Azkaban. But instead, because of Harry bloody Potter had saved their asses. Draco thinks to himself that he could never repay him.
"They're not dates mother!" She was almost out of the room when she muttered something under her breath, but too far away for Draco to hear her.
“What in the bloody hell are you doing here, Potter?” he whispered harshly.

“Well,” Draco continued. “No matter what you had said, or what I’ve been doing, wizards still see me as a Death Eater.” Draco’s face turned sour. “They still see my father.” Draco still was refusing to look Harry in the eyes, so he settled on his own hands. Occasionally straying to look at Harry’s hands.
Sirius let out a laugh. Remus answered first. "It was your father actually,"
Sirius went on about how attractive his fiance was and Remus stopped him.
"You know Malfoy, I'm the one who's supposed to be asking questions." Potter, chuckled? And at Malfoy? That's kind of cute Draco thought. But only kind of cute. "But, if you are curious, we could always," Potter halted, but continued anyway, "I dunno, go for a drink or something?" Potter must've been cursed or something. To ask such a question!
"I'm sorry." interrupted Harry, " Can I call you Draco instead?" He looked at Malfoy with the softest and fiercest look. "I just feel like it's a bit, childish is all." He added.
Draco contemplated kissing Harry right then and there. He had let doubt into his mind and his heart. Fuck, his heart. But instead, he put his hand, the one Harry wasn’t holding and touched Harry’s face softly. This shut him up real fast. He stored this away for later. “Okay.”
After about two hours of sedating and trying his best to help his patient, who had the Dragon Pox, even though his 'co-workers' thought it was eradicated long ago). "My grandfather died from it, so yeah it's not extinct," he muttered the second half. Seeing as no one else was going to help, as they were too scared that they would get it too, they forced the previous Death Eater to do the grunt work. Draco gave his patient the purple cure that was hidden away in a glass bottle that had been collecting dust. Slowly but surely the patient stopped sneezing out sparks and the bumps on his skin began to disappear. The green of his skin started to fade to a nice, dark brown. Draco was reminded of Potter.  He pictured the contrast of the colors of their skin. Draco with his nearly sickly shade of white and Harry with his skin that looked like what the warmth of the sun felt like. Draco longed to reach out and touch the Gryffindor's skin. His skin looked so soft but Draco knew it'd be rough. Rough from all the years of fighting and surviving. Draco laughed at himself, the man lying next to him almost died and all the doctor could think of was 'Saint Potter'. He thought of Potter's laugh and how he did so with his whole body. His body would jump up and down while he banged his fists on the table or his thighs. Oh, his thighs. Harry had the thickest thighs and Draco could barely stand it. He knew it was because Potter was the star quidditch player and had his thighs held tight around his broomstick for years. The man next to him coughed, which shook Draco out of his trance.
But the thing that hurts Harry the most, the thing that will stay will him the rest of his life, is his treatment towards his godfather. Since Dumbledore couldn't use or manipulate Sirius, he had no use for him, so he let the man rot in Azkaban. After the war was over, the very first thing he did was prove his innocence. He extracted Sirius' memories and used the truth potion on him in front of the Ministry. He's been free and living with Remus ever since. The two of them had gotten engaged just last month. Harry realized they were together during the winter holidays of his fifth year when they gave him a gift, together. Plus they always were together. Harry didn't believe in soul mates, but hell if they weren't the closest thing to it. This just forced Harry to do more soul searching and try to accept himself and his sexuality. He's still working on it.
"Sometimes. I think he tries not to make a big fuss about it, but I've noticed how much pain he can be in." Draco appeared reluctant.
“They- muggle sex toys?!” Draco looked exasperated, “and almost? What stopped them?” Harry smiled even bigger. There was a flicker in it, maybe he didn’t like talking about this kind of stuff.
"Not bad." Draco had a slight smirk on his face. He motioned to mother's book. She turned it around.
“So Potter, why are you a reporter?” Draco looked at him with a smirk and curiosity. “Didn’t think you’d become something you despised.”
"You, like it?" Draco was lost and felt a tad bit lightheaded. He doesn't think he could blame it on the little amount of alcohol he had.
Draco's brain started to freeze, of course, he'd blame it on the alcohol he's drinking. Even though he'd only taken a sip or two. Potter had the audacity, not only to ask him out at his place of work, but he asked him out on another date while they were still on one! Were they on a date? Is that what he was asking him? Had Draco hoped that Potter was asking him out? Who does Potter think he is?! Wait. Of course. "Potter," Draco felt disappointed for some reason. "Are you under a love potion?" Just saying it made him feel slightly sick. He had thought, he let himself believe. But, belief in what exactly? How could he let this happen? Draco had told his mother that he was friendly with Potter.
He couldn't believe Potter had the nerve to say what he did. My seat my arse. It didn't help that Potter looked the way he did. Potter looked like had forgotten to shave that morning and the day before. He was wearing the same stupid grey shirt he always wore and a Gryffindor red flannel. Bloody Potter, he always looked like pure fire. Whatever that means. He knew what it meant but still, after eight-plus years, couldn't admit it.
“Shaking your hand is hardly a thank you, Potter. Honestly, were you raised by wolves?” Harry chuckled.
It’d been a strangely quiet week for Harry, he finished his article, it wasn’t too great or too bad, it was alright. His friends were busy so he had little to do. He felt bad for rescheduling on everyone and felt worse for lying about why. He wasn’t ready to tell Ron and Hermione that he was fucking up his schedule up royally all for Draco Malfoy. So that Friday night, at the same bar as last week, Harry had gotten there ten minutes early, only for Draco to show up two minutes later.
"Malfoy-"
"Could say the same to you." Draco retorted. For some reason, he believed Potter. "Never thought you'd want to leave all the love and fame of everyone from," Draco looked around, making sure no one was listening, "you know where."
Harry felt his face drop. "You think I'm in love with you? And that I'm under some sort of spell?" Why would Malfoy think that? Because he was trying to be nice? "Why-"
"It feels more real, authentic. And I know what it’s like for people to see my dad when look at me." Before Draco could respond, Potter added, "Some might even say that you're stealing my look." Potter dared to smirk into his drink.
"He wasn't a friend, Potter." quipped Draco. "I didn't have the luxury for those."

(See the end of the chapter for
They talk to their parents about feelings *insert barf emoji here*
"That's actually why I left," Potter said. "Everyone thinks I'm some hero. I'm just a kid." he got quiet.
Harry quickly yet reluctantly let go of Draco and attempted to clean up the mess on his desk. “Sorry, I usually, well never have anyone over.” Harry was almost done organizing his desk when Draco spoke to him.
"It's more peaceful at the manor," Draco spoke so quietly and softly, Potter barely recognized the other man's voice. This is what he was hoping for. "But," he says louder, "Everyone says it's much busier here than before. I wouldn't know the difference I suppose." Draco had forgotten the question. It seems that Potter must have as well. "Although we do have lots of people with sleep disorders: nightmares, insomnia, paralysis. And a surprising amount of burns." Draco was trying to do his best for Potter. No, for the reputation of his workplace.
“I’m as surprised as you, but yes.” Draco’s hands felt cold since Harry let go, so he fiddled with them, just as Harry had a few seconds ago. “Wait, why’d you come to see me at work then?” Draco asked. Blood in Harry’s face rushed to cover his cheeks and neck. Interesting, thought Draco.
"Aren't you loaded with questions tonight?" sneered Malfoy.  They both paused for a beat. "Maybe buy me a few more drinks before you can call me that," He looked at Harry, hoping that he could read between the lines. Harry could not.
"Oh." The man sitting opposite of him looked unsure of how to continue. "Friends or not, war is war," he added. Draco nodded glumly.
Nowadays, those things are amongst the endless reason why he-
Hearing his name coming out of Potter's mouth sounded, good. It felt safe with him.
“Should only be a minute or so.” Harry said. He sat back down next to Draco, who thought Harry was closer than before. But even if he was, Draco said nothing about it. “So,” Harry continued, “you really believe me?”
Krum had pulled up, again at the last second but with the snitch in hand. He held his fist in the air rising higher and higher. He had caught the snitch.
"I can't believe the World Cup is only in seven short days. The best night of my life is in seven short sweet days." Ron blurted out. Harry laughed. He was excited too but Ron's enthusiasm still seemed to outweigh his own. He sat in the middle of his bed and Ron and Hermione joined him.
"I did need something." She said quietly, almost whispering. She stepped into the moonlight streaming from Harry's window and he could've sworn in that moment she was the most beautiful she had ever been. He was mesmerized, no enchanted, by her beauty. She came closer and closer until all he could see was her face. Her big green eyes seemed to take up his entire view. They were filled with uncertainty.
"Goodnight, you lunatic!" Ron called after her. Harry laughed and shook his head. He started up the stairs to his own dorm with Ron following suit.
"Awe, buddy, never tried firewhiskey?" Seamus asked. Harry shook his head. His coughing turned to laughter.
Suddenly something in Harry's mind just clicked. His hatred for Draco was still there but a stronger feeling was trying to beat that out. He couldn't help but notice how soft his lips looked or how his hair shined in the multicolored light. He hadn't noticed the beauty of his eyes. Before his thoughts could stray any further he snapped himself out of it and looked to his fellow Gryffindors instead.
"I won't let my dad get in the middle of our best summer yet. Death Eaters and all, that was still a brilliant game. I can't believe Fred and George called that. They're rich." Ron started rambling. Harry grinned. It was an excellent night until the party was crashed. Harry was sure it would be a night he would be telling his own kids about someday. The Weasley boys continued to chatter about the match. Hermione had her head laid on Harry's shoulder and was dozing off.
“What the hell happened” she hissed at me as I sat down. Glancing back through my non swollen eye I saw Draco leaning forward slightly like he wanted to know what happened as well. Looking back at Hermione, her glare softened when she saw my eye. “Harry, what happened, was it him again?’ ‘Is you mean the troll then yes, if you mean the other stray creatures that bully me then no.’ ‘So it was Davey?” “Yeah” “Bloody hell Harry, what did he do. “I was walking to class and I ran into him. He smirked at me and grabbed me by my collar then slammed me into the ground making my vision swim and nausea turn my stomach. While my vision blurred and my head throbbed he kicked me hard a few times. When he stopped I opened my eyes but he just smirked again and slammed his fist into my face. After that, I’m not sure what happened but I’m pretty sure he beat me bloody with my text books; who beats someone with their own textbooks then shoves them in a closet covered in their bloody textbooks.” I looked back at Draco and he looked so pissed that I involuntarily flinched, so I turned back to Hermione. “Harry, that’s worse than last time, we have to do something” ”Do what Hermione, I’m a shrimp. I’m so small that I almost could fit in with the gnomes.” I say angrily, closing my eyes and resting my head in my hands. I must have fallen asleep because the next thing I know someone is shaking me awake. Sitting up, I hear someone gasp but I can’t see them thanks to the swelling. “Harry, can you hear me” “Yes Mr. Finigan, I can.” “I think you should go to the nurse” “Ok, Hermione can you help me?” “She’s not here. I can’t take you to the nurse but Draco is here, he can.” “No problem Mr. Finigan,” I hear Draco say before he grabs my empty hand and puts it on his arm and then we were on our way.
Harry’s pov
What’s wrong, Vincent asked. It’s harry. Who hurt him now, Charlie asked. I believe his fucking father did. Ignoring their gasps, I slumped in my seat. Why, the only reason I could think of is if Harry was one out of a thousand-born human, that’s exactly what I think. I growled, cutting Marcus off. But we’re not going to tell anybody anything said in this cart. Yeah that would be bad since what I know about Mr. Potter is that he would most likely be so embarrassed that he would kill Harry, Marcus said. Plus, if anybody found out he would be expelled and be sent back home, and that would be bad, Vincent said, not smiling for once. You know what, that granger girl, uh….. Hermione, she’s like the smartest one in the school. Daniel stated. And by the look she gave his mother I would say she figured it out long ago that his father beats him, I said excited, sitting up. Which also means she knows he’s a human, but that fairy Ron doesn’t, which means, since their dating, that she wouldn’t tell anybody that would tell someone else, even accidently. We have to talk to her, we all said at the same time. So, we talk with her tonight, Marcus said, sinking back into his chair.
Harry slid open the door and started down the hallway. The Trolley was stopped a few compartments down. Harry caught up to her in a few steps. As he finished getting his snacks, the compartment door to his right slid open. The beautiful Cho Chang stood a few feet away. Harry had never been this close to her. He'd only ever seen her at Quidditch and in the halls. He could see every perfect eyelash. She smiled shyly and Harry realized he had been staring. He started to fumble with all the parcels in his hands. His face felt hot. Packages started to slide from his grip and hit the floor. Harry could hear giggles coming from the compartment behind. Cho looked pained. Embarrased for him? Harry reached down and quickly picked up his stuff. How could he alleviate the awkwardness?
"What? What in the hell are you kids doing out here in the woods? It's not safe." He shouted almost panicked.
Harry was stomping up the last set of steps when he saw a familiar blonde head. His stomach dropped and he let out a small groan. The boy with the slicked back hair in front of him turned around. Unfortunately, the adults and older teens had fallen behind, leaving just Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny to deal with the pain in the ass from Slytherin house.
"It wasn't Winky. The voice was deeper. It was a man." Hermione spoke up defending the poor house elf. Harry and Ron nodded in agreement. This bit of information didn't seem to settle the adults.
Harry sat on the floor close to the entrance, watching witches and wizards filing out of the stadium, some drunk, some disappointed and sobered. He saw Draco walking out, trailing behind his arguing parents. He looked sad. Harry felt almost bad for him. His right leg dangled down the steps and for a moment he thought about running down after him but that was a crazy thought. Ron sat next to him leaning against the wall with a dreamy look on his face.
"Harry Potter, master of the Wronski feint." He cackled. Harry joined his laughter. Sirius looked up from his pint and smiled.
"Only if you keep standing around. You lot always leave me out of the fun." She snapped back. Harry raised his eyebrows at the young girl's ferocity. Her red hair flowed behind her and her arms were crossed firmly. She stood a few steps above giving the impression, she was taller than them all. Her eyes glistened as she stared the group down. He hadn't really looked at her until this moment. He hadn't noticed her intensity. He didn't know if it was the adrenaline or the spirit of the Quidditch cup overcoming him but in that moment all he wanted to do was take her hand and run.
"Okay, let's go, quickly." Harry whispered. They walked as fast as the cloak would allow them. Harry was sure they had flashed their feet a few times in their hurry to get to the stairs. They were out of practice after the summer break. The stairs were difficult to maneuver too at first but by the time they got to the dungeons they had gotten back in sync.
"That's my wand. I dropped it!" He exclaimed. Diggory reached out and handed it over with an eyebrow raised. Harry grabbed it from him but the wizard didn't let go immediately. He looked Harry directly in the eyes.
"Stay out of trouble." He said quietly finally releasing him from the hug.
"Come here and give me a kiss, the both of you and stop pestering me." She snapped. They shuffled in for hugs and then turned for the train as well. Harry and Hermione stood by awkwardly while Ron got smothered with love from Mrs. Weasley.
"I have only two words to say to you," his voice boomed through the Hall. "
"We didn't notice you were gone until the riot started. I thought you all were dead. The adults are looking for you." She sobbed. Harry stroked her hair for comfort.
"I was teasing you as I always do. Maybe you have fallen in love with me? It doesn't matter anyways because I'm not a homo." Draco spat. Harry raised an eyebrow at that. He sure didn't kiss like he was homophobic.
He couldn't help it. He closed the distance between their lips. She melted into his chest and his arms just fell naturally around her, pulling her closer. She started to pull away but Harry leaned forward and pulled her in more. He felt hungry like he never had before. He wanted to tear her apart.
"Fred what did you bet?" He asked the closest boy.
"She started it." Ron whined in a hushed tone, oblivious to the threat in front of them. Harry elbowed him in the ribs and pointed forward. The lantern had swung to a stop. It was close enough they could see the person behind it.
"Wha-when?" He blurted before leaning over and puking violently. The girl who had been trying to wake him screamed in disgust.she clapped a hand over her mouth realizing what she had done. The remaining students froze. They had removed the soundproofing charm from the room already and with the door wide open she had surely been heard by half the castle. Everyone got up and ran leaving poor Johnathan behind in a drunken heap. Hermione whipped out the invisibility cloak when the trio reached the stairs and quickly threw it over the three of them.
"Course not, but she was found at the scene with a wand..." He mumbled.
Lupin had arrived a bit later in the day with a few more of Sirius friends. Harry was glad to see his Godfather letting loose after being haunted by his dreams the past few months. This was their first real outing into the wizarding world since Sirius had been declared a free man. Harry thought he had noticed a few stares but he couldn't tell if it was him or Sirius they were staring at. It was a welcome change.
After pie, Harry led the way upstairs. The adults had retired to the sitting room. Both doors were closed but voices could be heard still. Harry stopped. The group of teens behind him perked up and gathered around too.
"Quickly, now. Let's go." Harry urged. He didn't want to get caught. They went down another flight of stairs but they were still in sight of the booth. Harry looked up and his heart sank. The twins were staring over the banister. Fred winked and the both of them disappeared only to reappear moments later on the steps, barreling toward them.
As Harry walked down the Gryffindor table he received many waves and hellos from his friends in his house. It felt quite strange to be as popular as he was here. Years of rejection at muggle school had conditioned him to feeling invisible. Hermione took a seat across from Seamus and Dean right next to Ginny. Harry sat on Hermione's other side and Ron sat next to him.
"I do hate eavesdropping. Go to bed children." Kingsley ordered. His smile was warm but his voice was deep and commanding. Harry led the way upstairs holding eye contact with Kingsley until he was out of sight.
"It was swell. Sad I missed the cup. How was yours?" She returned. Harry nodded then realized that he was supposed to articulate an answer.
Hermione whispered, looking alarmed. She seemed to be the only student who had heard that particular phrase as the rest of the Great Hall was buzzing with excitement. Harry himself was more interested in what the Tournament would entail rather than some deaths that occurred hundreds of years ago.
He was so excited to finally be seeing his first professional Quidditch match. Ever since he had made the move to Sirius' house they had done nothing but catch up on Quidditch, news and politics. Harry had never had a chance to even form opinions on magical matters like these. He felt more and more like a wizard everyday that he stayed with his Godfather.
"The thing is I already fucked up. She came into my room just now and..." Harry stopped.
"Yeah, Sirius inherited it from his family so we've been fixing it up and trying to make it less gloomy and depressing. It took awhile, we're still not done with Kreacher's room and the attic." He explained. Hermione beamed.
"Tonight in Dungeon number 006 the fourth years are having a welcome back party,  round half past ten. It's Hogwarts tradition for all Fourth years to be there. Will we see the Gryffindors?" He asked. Harry swallowed his bite of biscuit and looked to his friends. Hermione has a disapproving scowl but the boys had a mischievous glint in their eyes.
"HE WAS FAINTING, YOU FOOL!!" Sirius and Arthur shouted angrily.
Dumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to Professor Moody. The Hall was filled with scraping and footsteps as the students crowded the door and poured into the Entrance Hall. Harry stood up with his friends. They passed by Fred and George who were already plotting ways to trick the judge. Harry didn't think any amount of aging potion or disguise spells would work for the twins.
They both started down the rest of the stairs catching up to the rest quickly. Dean was already sprinting for the forest's edge. Harry broke into a run behind him. Once they had all reached the trees, they gathered on the path leading into the forest.
"Welcome to the Quidditch World Cup!!"
"Don't worry, he's only ploughed." Charlie yelled to the kids. Harry looked at Krum who was hovering above Lynch. He was taking this time to look for the snitch without interruption. He didn't get long. Lynch was on his feet and then on his broom again, accompanied by screaming from fans. The whistle blew and they were off again.
"That would be brilliant, Harry. You'd be the most famous wizard in the world." He remarked. Harry shook his head.
The Quidditch players flew so fast that Harry could barely keep track of them. Cheers were the only indication that anyone was scoring as the balls flew even faster than the people hurling them. Ludo's commentary was so fast it just sounded warbled above them. All they could hear were names.
Winky came around with drinks and treats for everyone before disappearing back behind the door. Ludo Bagman's voice echoed through the stands.
"I had a nightmare about Voldemort." He told him. Sirius furrowed his brow. Then he got up and went to his desk in the corner. He pulled out a quill, ink and a notepad. There was a small end table to Harry's right. He set the items on the table's wood top.
"I'm nervous about this year." He admitted looking up. Lupin was looking over his glasses at him.
"Wait, wait, we have to wait for the Diggory's and the rest of Ron's family. I don't want them to miss it." He called. Harry turned around and started back down the hill. He sat down in the grass at the bottom and Sirius took a seat next to him. Hermione sat on his other side and opened her book. Ron sat down across from them and started to fiddle with the grass.
"Oh Harry, you didn't have sex with her did you?" Sirius questioned.
"Mascots will be coming out now, stay in your seats boys!" Sirius roared. Harry flashed back to a conversation they had about the Bulgarian mascots. A team of Veela started to dance across the field mesmerizing everyone in the stadium. Harry was enchanted and felt a sudden urge to RIP the shamrock from his chest and drop it off the balcony in front of him. He must've gestured he would do it because Sirius reached up and put an arm on his chest, anchoring him to his chair. Hermione reached forward and yanked Ron back by his shirt. He had gotten out of his chair and climbed to the edge of the box looking as if he might jump off.
Sirius had been drinking since they had located the first booth selling Ale which was only shortly after they had arrived. Sirius' drunken state only made him more generous though. He had been buying drinks, snacks and trinkets for the group. He had even convinced Harry to wear a giant shamrock on his shirt.
"I hope we still get to spend the rest of summer with you and Sirius, Harry." Hermione muttered leaning against his arm. Harry patted her back.
Dean stood up, crossed the circle and offered a hand to the pretty Ravenclaw. Helena blushed but took his hand and followed him to the closet, ignoring the giggles from her house fellows. The Slytherin standing there closed the door behind them. He seemed to have deemed himself in charge of the closet door. At least he was participating though. A couple of the other Slytherin looked bored.
"It's just sickening how people treat their house elves sometimes." She started. A loud cheer erupted bringing her speech to an abrupt halt. Bulgaria's players were flying around the stadium with such speed you could barely see them. They pulled to a unified stop right in front of the booth that Harry and his friends sat in, a mere twenty feet away. Harry could probably jump on one of their brooms if he was crazed enough.
Harry led the the other three up the stairs to his floor. Kreacher had made up the room next to his for Ginny though he didn't know why. He would have to resist the temptation to slip into her room at night. Though he wouldn't mind having someone to talk to. He had a lot on his mind.
"Okay, okay, I'm sorry son it just seems so amusing to talk girls now when our usual talks consist of life or death material. I'll tell you your father's technique and how he got your mum." Sirius said regaining control.
"Well, Seamus I think you and Dean should, go find your mum and dad. I saw them when I was running in but they stayed back to see if they could find you in the crowd." Hermione suggested. The boys nodded and started down the path. Dean stopped and turned around.
This part always had Harry feeling a bit doubtful ever since the incident where Dobby had bewitched the barrier. At least now he knew what to do if he got locked out.
up, staring out at the darkness of his room in fear. As a result, Sirius didn't sleep much without using various sleep-aids. He explained that every time he closed his eyes he could feel the Dementor's presence.
It was covered in steaming dishes of delicious food, reminding Harry of a Hogwarts feast. Sirius and Kreacher could whip up a good meal when they were getting along. The four of them stuffed their faces, joked and laughed all night. Harry was starting to feel the warm glow that being home left in his heart. He'd never have thought just a few short years ago that this would be his life now.
"As you must already know, activity surrounding or relating to Voldemort has increased in the past years. Honestly, since Harry has rejoined the wizarding world he's been growing in power. After the Death Eater trials, accociating with Voldemort in anyway became a social taboo. You could be fired or shunned just for talking about the trials the wrong way. People thought if they didn't talk about him, that he would just disappear.
"Thank you, dear. Let me show you to your rooms. I had Kreacher set up two rooms on Harry's floor, it's three flights up, hope you don't mind but that was Harry's choice." Sirius started leading up the stairs. Harry liked being so high up in the house. It would take longer for anyone to reach him up there. It felt safe and private. They passed the second floor landing which had various photos of Harry, Sirius, James and Lily. Hermione stopped and looked over them. She smiled and touched the corner of a framed photo of Harry as a baby. He was flailing in a bath tub looking happy. They continued back up the stairs. When they reached the top, Sirius led them into the first room.
"Are you busy this Friday?" Malfoy asked quickly. Yes, in fact, Harry was extremely busy that day.
Draco found himself getting easily distracted and his eyes wandered off to look for that messy head of hair. Perfect Potter and his perfectly messy hair. Potter had been waiting for Draco for about five minutes. "You still up for drinks then, Malfoy?" asked Potter. Draco smoothed his shirt down to calm himself, why wasn't he calm? He felt unusually nervous.
"Old friend then?" She asked.
"Oh." Harry was disappointed. He'd been having a rather enjoyable night with Malfoy. "I um- this was- I had a good time." He was unsure of what to say, not wanting to scare him away. Malfoy seemed to notice this too.
Shit.
i have a lot more to update with but i completely forgot about it so don't worry there's more!! and i know it's slow burn but like,,,, enjoy it
"I don't think I'll be long tonight." He answered. The oddest thing about this, apart from all of it, was that Malfoy had been wearing muggle clothing. It'd been a strange feeling seeing him in black skinny jeans and a t-shirt. The thing is, it wasn't a bad feeling. Harry thought he looked nice.
"But you didn't." The pair went quiet. Harry was exhausted and Malfoy had a somewhat hopeless look on his face. How was he supposed to explain it all to Malfoy?
Why did Malfoy have a phone? He thought that wizards didn't use muggle technology. When Malfoy got out his cell Harry had asked impatiently, "What does a non-muggle need a phone for?" He made sure no muggles were listening to their conversation. Malfoy shook his head.
"I'm sorry, for earlier. I dunno why I said that." Potter looked at his shoes with a strange look. "Just a little surprised to see you here is all."
Harry should stop drinking so much. To clarify, Harry's not an alcoholic, it's just the only thing that quiets the thoughts in his head. Sometimes. He had stopped going to the Leaky Cauldron since people wouldn't stop coming up to him. Everyone acted as if they knew him, all because he killed Voldemort. Sure he was a terrorist and the man who killed thousands of innocent people, including his family, but murder is murder. Dumbledore forced Harry to become a murderer, he felt like him and Tom were more equals now than ever. It's not like Harry could talk to anyone about it. The only other murderers were in Azkaban. He tried to talk about it with Ron and Hermione but they always end up saying that it had to be that way. That there wasn't another option. Harry had no choice. This was all rubbish to him. That's why he goes alone to a muggle bar. And that's what made it even more surprising when he saw the man on the stool he always sits at.
“The piece!” Draco looked at the door closed behind Harry. “Written about us!” Draco sighed and pushed Harry to the side and walked back into the employee’s room. He grabbed the newspaper off the coffee table. “This.” Draco threw it at Harry.
"Scared, Potter?"
He looked back down at Potter. He studied his face. The dark skin with even darker freckles splashed perfectly over his face. He could see them falling down his neck too. Draco let himself imagine the freckles that lived on Potter's chest. His toned chest. From all that quidditch. The hair on his head, and the unruliness of it all. The way it pointed in every single direction completely untamed. Yet it looked perfect. Perfectly messy. It was hard to believe that a close relative of his was the person who invented that hair gel he used to use. Before he could settle his focus on Potter's eyes, the man started talking again.
"No, dear boy, he was talking about your mother." Harry's heart lurched. Feeling cheated out of knowing his parents. "I realized I felt the same way about boys, along with girls." It sounded like he was going to continue but Sirius wanted to give his two cents.
It was a discreet photo of the both of them at the pub they’d been frequenting, with smiles upon their faces and drinks completely untouched. “I swear to you Draco,” Harry looked into Draco’s beautifully silver eyes, hoping this would help get his point across, but almost gets lost. “I had no idea about this.” Harry checked to see who wrote it. Rita fucking Skeeter.
"And why wouldn't I want to answer that, Potter?" snarked Draco.
lmao so i didn't proofread this
“Yeah, I want to do something else after a few more stories.” Harry smirked. “They let me write just about anything I want because I’m the ‘chosen one’ and all of that shit. They almost let me publish a story on muggle sex toys.” Harry laughed while Draco choked on air.
"Amongst other reasons." He hoped that Potter couldn't see his blush that began cascading down to his neck. He felt so embarrassed. He started to feel more vulnerable each second that passed. Potter was going to make fun of him. He hadn't expected him to make fun of the one thing that Draco knew was his own and not a replica of his father.
Draco apparated to the manor as quickly as he could. He couldn't stand the looks he was getting from the other healers that worked the night shifts. He found himself in front of the fireplace. "Oh, my goodness Draco darling you frightened me!" His mother was had been wearing he silk pajamas that were so elegant you could hardly call them as such. She was lying on the large grey couch which occupied a spot on the floor several feet next to the fireplace.
"What is it, Potter?"
i know this one was short but i still have more coming,, i might update again tonight or possibly tomorrow
hey y'all i'm rewatching hannibal so i'm thinking about adding more pinning and yearning lmao
“Defense Against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts.” Harry waited for a response but kept going, “Lupin, our teacher in the third year, has been teaching since but, he says he can’t keep up with it as much as he likes.” Harry’s smile subsided. “Plus he wants to work with Hermione at the ministry to help werewolves.” Draco felt a pang of guilt, remembering the ass he was to Lupin in their third year.
"You and me? Out for a drink?" Draco laughed. Only then did Potter truly seem to realize how preposterous suggestion was.
Without a second thought, they disapparated to Harry’s place. It was a one-bedroom loft which was surprisingly clean. Except for Harry’s desk. The kitchen, the desk, the bathroom, and the table all were to the left of the front door. The living room and bedroom were separated by a wall that was only connected to the floor, it didn’t touch the walls. The walls were bare, with only one picture of Harry, Ron, and Hermione just above the television.
"Good?" Of course, she had begun to notice Draco staying out later and grew concerned. It didn't take much budging for Draco to tell her about his 'meetings' with Harry. Draco didn't want to cause his mother to worry any more than she already did. She gave him a smirk and then her face fell. Don't hurt yourself Draco darling. She had said. Mother knew of his interest in the boy since before he had even met him. But everything changed when he met him. Draco had been too harsh and didn't realize until it was far too late for him to do something about it. The thing about Harry Potter is that the boy who, when Draco was a very little boy, made his father stay home and give him and his mother a kiss before bed instead of working with the Dark Lord wasn't who he thought he'd be. He wasn't supposed to have such curly hair, nor glasses, nor the huge lightning-shaped scar that rests on the middle of his forehead. The boy was most definitely not supposed to be a Gryffindor who was friends with muggle lovers. If things were different, if Draco had been raised to be a good person, none of these things would have bothered him. But he was and he did.
“You called me Harry!” He quickly moved back to Draco’s side, waiting for his response.
Draco splashed water all over his face, hoping it'd cool him down. Instead, he got water all over his shirt and messed up his hair. He'd been trying not to use any straightening charms or products on it, as he had no one to impress anymore. Nor was his father there to pester him about how unruly and unprofessional his hair is. He had ended up in Azkaban, all the death eaters had. Draco was one of the many who had voted for it when they were on trial. He only felt bad when he looked at his mother's jewelry; she still wore their wedding ring. Whether it was out of obligation or something else entirely he wasn't sure. It was obvious she never loved him. He felt guilty for something he had no control over (story of his life). But whenever he looked in the mirror, he saw his father. This made him nauseous. That's why he let his curls come out. And that's why he had been dressing the way he was. He wanted to see himself in his reflection. Not his father. Now, he saw more of his mother, he was alright with this.
"I mean I get the general idea of the game. I just needed a more in depth understanding of it and the book wasn't expensive." She responded. Ron had broken into a fit of laughter. When he caught sight of her death glare his mouth closed almost immediately.
Harry knocked on the door of his Godfather's studio and walked in. Sirius was sitting in an armchair by the window, reading one of Harry's Schoolbooks from his third year. He looked up from his book and lowered his reading glasses.
"We saw Ludo Bagman stumble out of the trees up here. He had no idea the riot had even started." Harry remarked. Hermione looked troubled. She met Harry's gaze and suddenly Harry flashed back to her knocking on the door as he told his uncle about his nightmare. How much had she heard. He let his eyes fall from her gaze to the ground in front of him. They were nearing the spot Ginny and him had met up with the group. He started to his left walking off the path and scanning the ground around him. Hermione and Ron followed with their own wands lit up. He heard Hermione gasp behind him and he whipped back around. She was waving for him to come back, as he was a few steps ahead of them. He turned forward again and saw a shadow of a man out in the woods.
"We're in for an interesting year. I know that much." Hermione remarked.
"Threats? Who would be stupid enough to plan an attack when the entire Ministry will be there?" Hermione asked. He wondered if she had heard any of the conversation from last night. If she had she would already know.
He got out of bed and peeked out his bedroom door, then he made his way to the study. The light was on but voices could be heard from the room so Harry knocked.
"Oh shut it, Hermione!" Ron replied. They all laughed again.
"Its been well Mr. Weasley, you?" Harry asked in response.
"Oh did it? How would you know? You conjured it maybe?" He shouted. Hermione teared up in fear. Harry pulled her by the hand to stand closer to him.
"Alohamora." She muttered flicking her wand at the same time. The door clicked and she pushed it open. This time the door swung forward. Most of the fourth years sat in a big circle. A few students were sitting at the pile of desks in the corner. They all turned to stare when the three walked in. Harry felt tense and nervous like he had just walked into a situation where he wasn't welcome.
"It's good to see you again, Ron, Hermione!" Sirius said grabbing them each into a quick hug. He grabbed their suitcases and picked them up. He smiled at a neighbor and then came inside. Since they removed the hiding spell from the house, it had become a lot easier for visitors to find them. They weren't quite as worried about hiding anymore.
"Amos? What is it?" Arthur asked. Suddenly Mr. Diggory's head popped out of the center of the fire clear as day and annoyed as ever.
Kissing Draco made him feel like his heart was exploding out of his chest with a hundred different feelings. Every sense was overwhelmed with Draco. He could taste him, smell him, feel the heat of his body against his. He didn't dare open his eyes and spoil the moment but he imagined the passion that he felt had manifested on Draco's face. It was fireworks booming and lighting up his soul. It was waves crashing into the beach that was his mind. In that moment it didn't matter that a powerful wizard wanted to kill him or that the father of the boy he was kissing followed that killer wholeheartedly. All that mattered was Draco's lips.
"You. Kissed. Me." He spat.
"I'm so ready to eat." Ron whined. Just as the words left his mouth the Great Hall doors opened again. Mcgonagall led the first years up to the front and lined them up along the staff table.
The kids get into a bit of trouble and Sirius' guardianship capabilities are questioned. I think I might take this in a more emotional direction. Let me know what you think. I'm sorry there's so much dialogue and if I write dialogue awkwardly.
"Harry!" Sirius yelled. He pushed past a couple wizards and grabbed Harry as soon as Arthur let him go. He looked him up and down before hugging him tightly.
"We're almost there actually. The portkey is at the top of that hill." He explained pointing in that direction. Harry started to race up the hill. All traces of exhaustion were driven out by excitement.
"Stop." Harry whispered throwing his arms out. A lantern had just rounded a corner and was bobbing wildly down the hall, directly their way. Clearly they'rebickering had been heard.
"You as well." Harry responded. Sirius clapped him on the back and pointed toward the Weasley's. Harry gave Molly and Arthur a hug as well before boarding the train. Hermione climbed in after and Ron was already sitting in his seat looking grumpy. The train let out a final whistle. Everyone started to close the train doors. Harry, Ron and Hermione went to the window to wave goodbye one last time.
"Well, no one knows. I'd like to imagine somewhere cold because their uniforms require a fur cape. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons have concealed their whereabouts so that no one can steal school secrets. There's a huge rivalry between all the wizarding schools. They used to have a Tournament but it got too dangerous to continue. Honestly boys, this is all in
"You're getting school supplies tomorrow. Be ready for the trip, I'm sure you'll leave early to beat the crowd." Lupin said effectively ending the conversation. Harry got up and marched back to his room. When he passed Ginny's door he thought he could hear faint sniffles but decided to play it off as a trick of the mind. He knew that progressing their relationship would only end up being a mistake.
"Harry this is the first sorting you've been to since your own." Hermione muttered, having overheard them. He laughed. She was right.
"What are you trying to say??" He asked. Mr. Diggory looked down ashamed.
When they got back to the Black household, Mrs. Weasley exploded into a frenzy. First she shouted at Arthur, then Kingsley, then Sirius, then Lupin, and then it was the kid's turn. She started on Fred and George as they were the oldest of the group of troublemakers.
"Just want to be prepared." Hermione replied. He shook his head and chuckled before jumping in to help her.
"I'll miss you kid. It'll be lonely in that big house. I won't be offended if you want to stay at school over the holidays. This year will be unforgettable for you. Write me, especially if you have any more of those dreams. I'll send you care packages every few weeks." He explained. Harry felt his eyes start to sting and closed them tight. Saying goodbye to his new found family was harder than he'd anticipated.
"BLARGH! PEEVES!!" Ron shouted suddenly from his right. Harry felt a large wet pop on the top of his head. Ice cold water trickled down his head and into his robes. Looked like the school's poltergeist was excited to see the students returning too.
"Hermione, it's a Quidditch match! You go for the game, not the people!" He shouted. Hermione rolled her eyes. Hedwig woke up and screeched.
"The Irishmen have style, you've gotta give them that!" Sirius shouted from his seat directly behind Harry's. Harry turned around with a grin.
"Alright, here's the plan. We set them off in the field at the same time. We run to the apparition point down this path. Then we sneak back to the campsite and pretend we were in your tent the whole time." Seamus explained. Dean had already started passing out fireworks. A few screams came from the campsite but Harry dismissed it as partygoers getting rowdy.
"Ah, who needs em! Let's play another game." Dean sneered.
"Harry, what happened in that closet with Malfoy?" He asked. Harry stopped and Ron ran right into him knocking them both over. They fell into a quiet fit of laughter, trying hard not to wake everyone up.
"You haven't even made it to school, do try to take it easy on her?" Sirius asked. He had just walked in to witness the tail end of their confrontation. All of them shook their heads and burst out laughing again.
"Not a surprise. Any particular reason why?" He asked. Harry looked down at his hands.
Without pausing to think, Harry yelled
"Somebody keep time for them. In the mean time let's pass this bottle round again!" Johnathan yelled. Harry wasn't sure if he could take much more. He looked across the circle and saw that Malfoy seemed just as drunk. He was leaning heavily on a Slytherin girl sitting in a chair behind him. She didn't seem to mind though. She was lightly scrubbing her fingers through his hair. He passed the bottle to her and she chugged a few gulps before passing it along.
" He asked wiping a handkerchief across his forehead. He shoved it in his back pocket. Sirius turned in a full circle looked back up at the hill nearby and stopped.
"Just tell us!" Fred demanded.
When the group got to Diagon Alley, Ginny was quick to suggest they split up. Harry felt a twinge of sadness but decided maybe he'd use the opportunity to look for a forgiveness present. Hermione and Ginny went dress shopping with Molly while the boys followed Sirius to get dress robes. Something Ron was not looking forward to if his loud complaints were any indication. They had fun messing about in Madam Malkin's shop much to her dismay. She worked her magic still and the four boys were all fitted for rather sharp matching black robes. Even Ron was pleased.

Harry saw Draco walking to the employee’s room, Harry had come at the end of Draco’s shift today, not wanting to disrupt him or his work. “Hey!” Harry shouted, “Draco,” The blond’s head whipped around to stare at him. There was annoyance in his face.
“People seem to never forgive or forget,” Harry said glumly. Draco nodded.
"Yeah," Harry adds, "Ron's got a nasty burn on his arm and chest. Didn't even notice it at first."
“Okay,” Draco was quiet after that and started to get into his plainclothes. He took off his white doctor’s coat, put it in his locker. He was wearing a simple light green shirt. He slipped off his sneakers and put on fancier ones. Harry thought it was stupid, but they looked nice on him.
“That’s it?”
He hates all the anger he has, for himself, the Dursleys, for Dumbledore. But he's glad the old man isn't around to cause more havoc, as disrespectful as it sounds. Harry wished that Malfoy could get all of this with a melancholy look. Doubtful. The blond was smart, but he wasn't a mind reader. "It's just a bit more complicated than it looks."
"I still don't know what you mean." Harry tried his best to sound as genuine as he felt.
Malfoy began to walk towards him. "Potter!" He whispered loudly. "What on Earth are you doing here? Following me, are you?" he added. Harry froze, what was he here for again? Right, work.
“I don’t mind, Harry, plus you should see my bedroom. It’s much worse.” Harry stopped what he was doing and smiled at Draco.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry smiled, “No, you said Harry.” he quipped. They both ended up laughing softly on his couch. “Oh, shit, uhm do you want tea or something?” Harry asked. Draco was going to ask for something harder but he needed to keep his wits about himself. He already almost kissed Harry and he was sober, Merlin knows what he would do if he was drunk and alone with Harry.
Amongst the billion other things the Dursley's loved to abuse him for, the way Harry looked at boys was one them. That was yet another reason why they kept him under the stairs. God forbid the malnourished and abused boy does something to their perfect son. It's not like Harry could do anything, he was Dudley's punching bag for years. This all made perfect sense to the Durselys. Even though his friends and family were accepting, it was still a struggle for Harry to unlearn the abuse he got from Privet Drive. Ron had figured it out in their fourth year, he had seen the way he looked at Cedric and Cho, the way he talked about them. They bonded even more over being bisexual. Harry is forever grateful they didn't continue fighting that year. He was trying to figure everything out, the goblet picking his name, everyone around him, Dumbledore, his stupid feelings, but the most difficult part of their fourth year wasn't even Tom Riddle. It was fighting with Ron.
But then he wasn't that Malfoy anymore so maybe– just maybe– he might receive a much calmer reaction. He could also just tell him that this lavatory was the nearest from the Gryffindor tower. That would give him a way out.
“Harry?”
Draco finally leapt into action and pulled Harry’s hand away from Cho by claiming a possessive hand on Harry’s wrist. Cho was startled at the reaction and flinched back.
"Why shouldn't I?”
He bet on Draco but the conversation he had eavesdropped on right now clearly affirmed that it was Harry.
Thank you to all my readers and my comment-ers! Thank you for the kudos too!! I love you all <3
“If you really want to…” Harry was lost. He didn’t want to leave Draco like that. He wanted to take him and place him into his care but he didn’t force on it any longer. “I’ll go…”
Harry had just left Dumbledore’s office after a discussion that led to more questions in his head rather than answer some. He wanted nothing more but to go back to the comfort of his bed and rest his mind. But apparently, Merlin has different plans for him when he saw Malfoy, accompanied by Crabbe and Goyle, on his way.
"I.. I thought if I could remove the mark... He might disappear..." Tears threatened to pour from his pair of blue eyes that was staring at a distance- and not at Harry.
“What?”
Harry leaned back. He seemed reluctant to let go of the man in front of him. “Are you sure? Can you walk there alone?”
Granger.
“It’s your fault. Why did you have to come? Why did you have to tell me that you love me? Why did I want to say I love you back? Why did I–“
Draco can’t keep Potter out of his mind. He kept remembering the events from yesterday that he certainly wanted to forget. Potter pinning him on the wall, Potter locking him in his arms, Potter kissing him, Potter caressing his pale skin, Potter–
“It was here.”
Draco growled and covered his eyes with his hands. He really needs to stay focused before their professor catches him and take him to detention due to negligence.
“Go back to your common rooms now.”
“But that’s not–“ Ron tried to look at Harry but he realized he wasn’t with them today. “If Harry was here, he’d disagree!”
Harry sighed and went back to his thoughts but
Harry planned to just ignore them and quickly go back to the Gryffindor tower but Malfoy chose to stand in front of him and block his way. With his two usual lackeys by his side, Harry had no choice but to stop.
“Harry”
The kiss wasn’t forceful or dominating at all. It was slow and gentle with Harry’s lips trying to figure out what to do with Draco’s before licking and nibbling his lower lip. Harry’s arm went to join his other arm around Draco’s waist to further press their bodies together and eventually sucking at the other’s lower lip.
"And tell me why you should care for a death eater?" His tone was insulting but he wasn't really insulting Harry this moment.
Ron didn’t realize he had been meandering all this time. He didn’t know where his feet took him but then he suddenly heard voices from afar. He slowed down his pace and approached the door from where he heard the voices.
Harry stopped when he realized that Malfoy was just going to the lavatory. But why did he need to take all this way when there's one located near the Slytherin tower?
Harry knelt beside Malfoy’s curled form and he slowly did what he just thought of. He wrapped his arm around the Slytherin and pulled him into his chest. Said Slytherin started to struggle and thrash weakly but the other’s hold on him was firm and unrelenting.
Unknown to Harry, Ron had turned his head to look at Draco and saw that he had cracked a glass with his hand. Ron cringed at the trail of blood from the Slytherin’s hand that was slowly pouring down.
Draco had stopped. By the end of his narrative, Harry realized he had been crying with him.
With Harry by his side, nothing seemed impossible.
Harry did speak this time, “Oh, I don’t know. I probably liked it when you started waiting for me after detention.”
“No, that’s not true!” Harry wanted to speak further but Draco interrupted him.
Luckily, Cho was there to help him... albeit in an indirect way that he didn't appreciate.
“Now, now. We said 10 galleons.”
Malfoy tried so hard to bring his nails to the mark again but failed to do so with Harry's strong grip. "He... He... I… I can't let him out of my head..." He whimpered and drew in a shaky breath.
“Ron!” Harry hissed and stood up.
Harry struggled to look for the certain Slytherin in mind but he was nowhere to be found.
Malfoy slid down the floor, his cheeks still flushed, and his heart beating wildly. He placed a hand on his chest willing it to calm down but it didn’t comply. “Damn you, Potter.” It took him several minutes before being able to stand up with his head held high but a blush apparent on his cheeks. He then went back to the Slytherin Common Room and decided to act like nothing happened.
“Bloody hell, Hermione.”
“Flirted with each other out into the open!” Fred and George finally finished their wonderful story simultaneously.
“I don’t know. She’s pretty cute.” Harry decided to push it, a playful smile finding its way to his lips. “I think her name is… Cho Chang? Sixth year Ravenclaw.” He then met the Slytherin’s gaze… which turned out to be a wrong move, a very wrong move.
“Don’t you dare think about it.”
Draco held at the arm with the hand that was still on his cheek. His eyes were open while Harry’s were closed. He looked a bit confused as to why Harry was being gentle… It’s as if he’s being
“What’s the matter Ron? You seem to be aloof these days,” Hermione asked her friend who was busy staring at his food rather than eating it.
Harry pulled back but his lips remained pressed to Draco’s and he said, “Thank you,” He kissed him. “For not being able to do it.” He kissed him again. “Thank you for not leaving.” And again. “Thank you for staying with me.” And again.
Or so he dreamed…
Draco glared at her. He really didn’t mean to. It’s just that he’s been glaring from the start that it would be too hard to suddenly soften his features. “Nothing.”
with his wand but the room instantly lighted up.
I wanted to focus on the bet.... but they'll interact in the next chapter! I promise!
The map only shows the names of the
Harry and Ron both looked at their professor, their mouths open wide. “But professor–“ It was only Harry who Snape interrupted.
“We can always continue with last time.” Harry slowly angled his head. “If that’s why you’re here.”
Harry looked everywhere. He didn’t care if someone saw him. He had to find Draco.
“Have you done the assignment that’s due next week?” Hermione crossed her arm and raised her brows.
Harry then remembered what Draco last told him, to search for him even when he can’t be searched. What did he really mean by that?
Harry smiled– almost laughed– as he lunged forward to capture Draco’s lips in his.
Draco grimaced at the thought, his hand clenched into a fist. He examined Harry’s actions from his periphery.
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
Draco made no sign of acknowledgement so Harry just left, unwillingly.
Harry, eyeing the other figure in the room, slowly stood up from where he landed on his torso when Malfoy had pushed him. "What were you doing, Malfoy?" He didn’t sound mad, he didn’t sound curious, he sounded stern.
I'm sorry if there weren't any interactions this time between them!
Harry spotted a pale figure lying on the ground. What caught his eye was the blood gushing out of the man’s wrist. Harry knew who it was. With wavering hands, he reached out to the blond and took him in his arms, covering his whole body and shielding him from anything that might harm him.
Draco’s eyes widened and he felt his heart miss a beat. He willed himself to stay inside the strong and protective embrace for a moment. He let himself feel and experience this proximity with Harry for a longer moment before finally speaking up, “I’m tired. Can I go back to my room?”
Harry hasn’t even got all the way up to the top of the astronomy tower when he heard someone crying. He quickly took his cloak off together with the map and rushed to the top of the staircase to see Malfoy on the floor hugging his knees with his chin resting on them as he sobbed and whimpered.
Draco smirked and looped his arms around Harry’s neck. “Yes. I know how much you’ll miss me.”
Ron bet on Draco and the twins bet on Harry.
At one point, Draco felt weak on his knees and was only supported by Harry’s arm on his waist semi-carrying him already. He wanted to pull away since he was afraid someone might see them but…
“Don’t you have a plan???” Draco hissed while looking around, searching for a place to hide.
Ron lazily scratched his head. “The one that’s due next week? I’ll do it before deadline.”
Malfoy, with his usual haughty demeanor, pushed on. He started to walk toward Harry menacingly. “Better go back to that filthy mudblood and pathetic Weasel who continue to be a disgrace to the wizarding world. I’d say hurry up and prevent them from doing stupid things again but then I realized–“
For all those who knows MCAT and will take it too, high five!!!
“Harry??”
What was bothering the Slytherin’s mind? Harry can’t help but to wonder. Was he thinking of him? Of their encounter yesterday?
Ron looked back at Harry, determined not to lose the bet, and stomped on his feet.
kissing him ferociously against the wall, Draco’s plans might have succeeded.
Harry hadn’t opened it ever since Fred d– his battle with Voldemort. He didn’t want to but slowly reaching over the pale parchment and pulling it into his grasp, and with his wand, he whispered, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” The map then started revealing the entire Hogwarts and Harry didn’t miss the name
I didn't mean for this chapter to be this long... I was actually worried it might only be 500 words or something... sometimes my hands just can't stop writing and adding things that aren't originally in the plan. XD
“Ronald! What’s happening??” Hermione asked frantically. “Fred? George!”
, I’d say you were scared.”
A door opened then closed again, indicating that someone had went out. Footsteps resonated within the hallway. “Fancy being a regular in detention?” Draco said right when Harry was about to round the corner.
Ron slowly turned his head to look at the brunette beside him.
Harry smirked and suppressed a laughter. Malfoy did look so embarrassed yesterday so he won’t be forgetting that memory soon.
"I need to go now. You know how hard it is for Ron and Ginny as this was also the exact day that Fred had died. They haven't... Accepted it yet," Hermione said as she looked down the floor. This wasn't easy for her too but she had to be strong. "Are you coming?" She met Harry's eyes again.
Harry missed it. The ignorance that comes with childhood. He barely had one of those thanks to the Dursleys. But every time he reentered a magic place, he felt like a child for the first time in his life. He remembers meeting Hagrid for the first time and feeling like it was all a dream. Not truly believing it all until Mrs. Weasley helped him get to the platform in his first year. Harry tells people that it was his first class at Hogwarts that made him believe. But it was the kindness of a stranger that made him believe.
He went back to the bar, part of him hoping to run into Malfoy. But they ran into one another at work. Or rather, Malfoy's work. Harry had been wanting to do a piece on St. Mungo's and how they were doing after the war. The very last thing he'd expected was to see that head of platinum blond hair. I mean, it'd make sense if he pissed someone off so much they beat him up for it and Malfoy ended up here. But no. Malfoy works here, as a healer. He even had the robes and everything. Harry couldn't believe it. Not to mention how strange Malfoy looked in the robes. A good strange he thought to himself. Unclear on what that meant, another strange through passed through his mind. Malfoy had looked soft. It looked like he was comforting a small child who had grown a finger from the crook of their elbow. Harry thought Malfoy looked unrecognizable. Then he looked at Harry. There was that stone-cold look he used to get every day!
(See the end of the chapter for
"He's right, Potter."
“You did though.” Harry thinks back to the trial. When it was all over, Draco went to shake Harry’s hand, a stone-cold look on his face, but tears had filled his eyes.
“Shit Potter, you really are thick in the head.” Draco said. “Well, I suppose I am homophobic since I hate myself but I seriously doubt that’s what you meant.” The smirk returned onto their faces and Harry apologized.
"I'm here to interview some of the healers here." Malfoy gave him a blank stare. "Because I work for the Daily Prophet..." Harry paused, still a bit taken aback by seeing him. "What are you doing here Malfoy?" Harry thought he sounded smart. How the hell did he save the wizarding world more than once?
"Catcher In The Rye," The same smirk that rested on Draco's face was now on Narciss's face. "This is by far the most boring book I have ever read." They shared a soft laugh and she moved up off the sofa. "I'll be off to bed then, and maybe you can tell me more about your dates with Harry." Thank Merlin it was dark, Draco hadn't wanted his mother to see the growing blush on his face.
"Well," Sirius had interrupted his somber thoughts, he sounded exasperated. "It seems like you're infatuated." Harry wished his godfather was wrong, however, it was true. "Not to mention, Harry, it's late and I know for a fact that you have an article to write." Sirius might have played the fool but that didn't make him miss any details. They wished one another a good night and Harry reached his place as he put his phone in his back pocket. His mind so full of thoughts, he finished his article and went to bed with a blond man in his mind.
"Even death eaters? You think they can change as well?" Draco didn't want to know the answer to that.
Later that night, Harry had a brilliantly stupid idea. His last article for the Prophet should be about Draco. It’d be a perfect send-off. He knew his job as a journalist wasn’t going to last. But to have his last story tell the world the truth about Draco. Harry knew that people are quick to judge, and he hopes that people will be quick to believe the truth. They never had before, but this is different. The ‘Savior’ was going to write the truth about the past Death Eater, about the good in Draco, and he hoped that people believed him. He needed them to. He wasn’t sure why, but he just needed it.
"No."
instead of doing my thirty-ish missing assignments and studying for my written spanish final tomorrow that i am utterly unprepared for, i did this, so pls enjoy this
"Did you want to be a death eater?" Potter's question felt genuine. No secret motives. He could use more of that. Draco went quiet.
“Yes. You say you didn’t know and I believe you, is that so hard to believe?” Draco tilted his head to the side as he put on his jacket. Harry was quiet.
"Draco, call me Draco." Yeah, he definitely had a crush on him.
Harry didn't know where to go or where to look. His hair? His outfit? His face? His mouth? So he walked up to Malfoy like a bloody idiot and said: "That's my spot." Malfoy looked astonished and ready to kick him in the shins.
Closer and closer to him. Harry reached out to Draco and grabbed his hand. Draco’s fingers were longer, skinnier than his own. This seemed to be true for everything between their bodies. “You know,” Harry was scared of the silence, In  a whisper, Harry asked him, “Would you like to go back to mine?” A beat passed and he added, “To talk, if you want. We don’t have to of course but-” Draco stopped him.
"Let's do this again on Friday, same time?" Harry didn't skip a beat, but his heart did.
"No, not at all. I'm completely free." He could have sworn that Malfoy smiled.
“Oh,” Draco felt something genuine again. “I’m sorry, that’s awful Harry.” The name felt so strange on his tongue, but well guarded. Attempting to lighten the mood he asked, “What job are you looking at?” Harry looked him in the eyes and smiled. He felt vulnerable here, like this, with him. With Harry fucking Potter. Draco felt goosebumps.
Harry sighed. “Yes, Malfoy,” the smile on his face left and he stood up to leave. “I should’ve known you were homophobic.” Draco laughed.
Draco paused. He wondered what could possibly happen if he explained himself. No one likes him anyway. And no one listens to Potter, or do they? “The muggles are the only people not repulsed by me.” Draco looked away from Harry and out the window. “Even after the trial, when you vouched for me.” Draco almost looked like he was going to cry. “I never thanked you for that.”
“What do you mean?” Harry asked.
"Shut it, Potter, I'm leaving." he interrupted. Draco didn't feel like explaining himself, nor did he feel like talking tonight. Maybe another. Maybe he should stop drinking so much.
i know this is short but more is coming!!!
"Um, Malfoy?" Harry had interrupted his train of thought. "Well, I was going to ask if it was hard, helping to rehabilitate people." Potter paused before Draco could respond. "You don't have to answer if you don't want to." Draco gave the other man a defensive look.
“You can’t be here!” Draco pushed Harry into the bathroom, “Don’t you read your paper?” Harry’s reaction was answer enough.
Draco glanced at him with a puzzled look, “Only for a bit?” he asked, genuinely curious. What else would Potter be doing? He always had the idea that he’d be a professional seeker seeing as he loved it so much. He remembers how devastated Harry had been when Umbridge had banned Harry from quidditch in their fifth year.
"Malfoy wait!" Potter shouted as Draco was walking away. What the hell were they doing? Draco stopped in his tracks and decided to hear was Potter had to say.
"Well-"
Harry was definitely telling Ron and Hermione.
“I could say the same thing for you” jabbed Harry. “I saw you volunteering at a muggle hospital.” Harry had hoped that this was sufficient enough of an answer.
Once Harry started talking about Malfoy, it was hard to stop. "I think he used to hide because he was afraid or didn't know who he was," Harry remembered back to their sixth year in the bathroom. Afraid of the world around him. The gaunt and exhausted boy staring at his reflection in the mirror, scared of who was looking back at him. Harry was scared too. And dumb. But that doesn't dismiss what Harry had done to Malfoy. He thinks about that night almost as much as the war. He regrets all of those choices. Thinking it was okay to hurt someone solely based on fear. He thinks of the blood he caused to pour out of that small pale body, an innocent body. Out of Malfoy's body. Harry thought it would make his guilt lessen, but in fact, it just made him feel worse. He fell asleep after a few hours of tossing and turning. Only to be welcomed with images of Malfoys body, covered in blood. Harry couldn't escape all the hurt he caused Malfoy and all the pain Malfoy brought to him. Neither of them guilt-free.
"Why are you being so nice to me?! I mean, I was a bully and I was awful to you and your friends!" Malfoy appeared exasperated. "I almost killed Dumbledore!" Harry sighed.
Draco was definitely telling his mother.
i'd rly like to know what u think of this fic and what you want to see, so let me know!
"Hey, you two." Harry had left the pub and started to walk back to his flat. He'll finish his article tomorrow. "I have a question for both of you." Harry almost hung up. He wasn't afraid of being judged or anything of the sort, but he was afraid of the truth. Afraid that he'd be even more of an outsider. "How," he paused for a few seconds before blurting out the rest, "how did you two know you weren't straight?"
“Me? Homophobic?” Harry stirred waiting for ‘the speech’ that people say when they’re homophobic but don’t want their reputation tainted. Funny, Harry had just started to think that Malfoy didn’t care about his reputation anymore. “Potter, I’m gay.” Draco let out a small breath. It was Harry’s turn to feel as if his mind had frozen.
"You're joking, right?" retorted Malfoy. "This isn't your bloody spot Potter! It's a pub, you complete idiot." Malfoy stood up and rushed to the bathroom before Harry could say anything to him. The bartender chuckled and said,
"See you then Draco." The name felt foreign, but it sounded right coming out of his mouth.
He and Draco had planned to meet for drinks every Friday, but this couldn’t wait. Harry only had a week and a half if he goes through with this, and he needed to convince Draco. Fuck. He’d never go for it. Draco was all about privacy and keeping to himself. But, he could see the looks that his co-workers and patients at St. Mungos gave him. If people knew the truth, maybe, just maybe, Draco could do whatever he wanted to do. He could be a doctor, a cook, a teacher, a Ministry man, anybody. So Harry apparated to St. Mungos and felt nauseous.
"Finally, something we can agree on." Potter chuckled at this. Draco thought about staying to continue the conversation with Potter but instead, he grabbed his jacket off the stool and began to leave. "Try not to die from alcohol poisoning Potter. People will think it was me." and left.
"Well for me, Harry-" He could just feel the adoring look Remus must have been giving his fiance. Gross. "I think I always knew, but fuck, coming back home to our third year at Hogwarts and seeing him for the first time since last year. Yeah, that's when I knew." Now Harry could feel the adoring look Sirius was giving Remus. They were so, soft. So gentle with one another. So soft it hurt Harry's heart. Because he knew all the pain and heartbreak they suffered. Harry thought that they were only so careful with each other because they were afraid of making a mistake. He could understand that.
"Is that why..." Potter pointed at Draco's head, "you changed your hair?" Draco is definitely going into hiding with his mother after this. This was all too much.
"You had a crush on my father?" Harry felt a bit lost, unsure of how to compartmentalize such new information. It was Remus' turn to laugh.
“I just am not out to a lot of people and that’s another reason I’m switching jobs. The Prophet gave me two weeks’ notice. But I talked them into a month.”
they disapparate to harry's place,,, 😳😳😳
"How," he paused for a few seconds before blurting out the rest, "how did you two know you weren't straight?"
Harry couldn't believe he'd asked Draco Malfoy out on a date. Was it a date? No. That would be preposterous. They were just going to catch up, like old friends. Being friendly? Harry spent the rest of his waiting doing what he meant to do when he got to St. Mungo's. He hoped it wouldn't take too long to write up the article.
“They only hired me out of pity. And because my mother may have sent quite the wordy letter, thank Merlin it wasn’t a howler.” Draco looked at Harry, expecting him to change the topic, but he didn’t, so he kept talking. In a much quieter, hushed voice, Draco said, “It’s funny, the people I had so much hate for, and all because my father told me to,” Harry understood that Draco was talking about Muggles, “are the only people who treat me like I’m my own person.” Draco let a tear fall out of his eye. “They don’t know all the things I’ve done.”
"The opposite. I think" Honestly he wasn't quite sure anymore, they definitely weren't friends, but they were way past the childish enemy stage.
"Because everyone else doesn't think I can change. They always see my father when they look at me." Potter let out a soft chuckle. Fuck him for being so soft.
"Goodnight darling. I love you."
Before Malfoy, no, Draco left he looked back at him once more, giving Harry a small smile. He felt like he was electrocuted, he was so excited for Friday. He didn't even feel that guilty about how he had to cancel all his plans. Harry did however still felt conflicted about his feelings. He tried to pretend that it was a phase for the past two years or so. The war brought back all his trauma. So he called the only people he could.
Draco looked at Harry with admiration. “I think it’s perfect.” It’s strange. Harry wasn’t looking for Draco’s opinion but felt much better about his decision after hearing Draco. The blonde seemed a bit squeamish. “How are Granger and Weasley?”
"Just an old schoolmate I keep running into." Harry had calmed down on his walk back to his flat. He felt too lightheaded to apparate back. Not to mention, walking always made him make more sense of his feelings. "It's confusing," He wasn't sure if he should tell them. At least, about the Malfoy aspect.
“More like signing up for a fan club for one of the most notorious murderers known to man.” Draco didn’t appear to be sad anymore, now he looked angry. “How did you even get to this!” He exclaimed. “I asked you a question, Potter.”
"We went to school together," Harry said. He'd hoped that would be enough explanation for why he said what he said.
Harry didn't tell them.  He thought they might think Harry was going full 6th year again on them. They still make fun of him for that. "Well, you were stalking him like crazy, Harry." Ron would say. "Honestly we thought you were going slightly mad!" added Hermione.
“Well, they’re important to you, yes?” Harry nodded, unclear on where Draco was headed. “If we’re going to be,” Draco paused and held a slightly confused look on his face, “friends, or acquaintances, then I should care about them as well.” They both stayed silent for a moment. “And maybe I could also just be making conversation.” Draco spat out.
Harry couldn’t believe his ears. Draco had wanted to hear about his friends and called them friends. “Friends,” Harry said dreamily. “I think I rather like the sound of that.” They beamed at one another. They had started off as enemies. Now they both saw a light at the end of the tunnel. They could be friends. They both liked that better than the alternative.
