He settles further into his pillows as he opens the paper. He’s interested to see whether or not this Rita Skeeter character considered him fit for society after being released from Azkaban.
Draco’s heart leaps, but falls as Bryn continues: “It’s not going to undo the memory loss, but it does provide information about it, like reading the history of your memory. Does that make sense?”
Draco frowns, shakes the thought away, and tries to focus on the book on his lap. He’s still trying to learn how to sign the letter K, even though it’s not necessary to know at the moment. It really only bothers him because his hand doesn’t want to move that way.
Draco’s soft expression makes Harry’s heart thrum. He finds it difficult to look away from Draco’s eyes — beautiful, and full of meanings that Harry doesn’t understand.
that Draco Malfoy,” the green-eyed man says. “Look at your arm if you don’t believe me. You’ll see, the Dark Mark will be right there.”
“But you’ve got nothing against kissing Longbottom, Harry? I’m offended. It’s probably for the best, though. You couldn’t handle me,” Draco says with a wink.
“Oh, be nice to poor Aggie, Draco. You wouldn’t want me to have to step in, would you?” comes a bright voice to Draco’s left.
Just then, a low buzzing starts in Draco’s ears, growing in pitch and volume with every passing second, and his vision blurs slightly around the edges.
They walk down the hall, past Teddy, who’s been cornered by Hugo and Rose — Harry gives Teddy a pointed look, as if to say to just give up whatever he took from them, and Teddy’s hair turns red.
. He half-stumbles to the sink, turning on the tap and splashing his face with freezing water, relieved for all of a half-second. He falls to the toilet, emptying the contents of his stomach.
Draco’s eyes go wide, laughter dying immediately, and Harry looks away, mortified that he just said that.
He squints through the soft light to see Isabelle, dragging a bag almost as large as she is through the door with her mouth. Her legs are on either side of the knobbly velvet sack, her gait awkward and adorable as she pulls it towards Harry. He chuckles at the sight.
He thinks, and he misses Draco. Together by the fire, pouring a bit of alcohol into empty mugs, voice soft and reaching into every corner of the room to fill it with comfort. Reaching into
“Careful, Draco,” Neville mutters. “You might make his hair grey faster if you keep teasing him like that.”
His chest fills with slow, steady warmth. It’s an easy, straight-forward feeling, something that he could fall into if he let himself.
Draco thinks about it, expecting to be angry and hurt, but finds it easy to accept that it happened. He’s not even upset about it, not really—maybe in a distant sort of way, but he’s preoccupied by the realization that he doesn’t like how apologies sound coming from Potter, especially not for things Draco can’t remember. “I think you’ve made up for it since.”
“Thank you. It’s been nice to see you in person,” Draco says, choosing his wording carefully. He wants to say that it’s been nice to meet her, but he’s not
With a start, Remus realised that he had the house to himself. Risky, foolish ideas began to form in the back of his mind, and he willed them away forcefully. He would absolutely
Indeed, he had barely arrived when the first carriages with students were rolling up, pulled by the same Thestrals Severus now knew had transported Harry and his friends to the Ministry back in June. He hadn’t questioned the fact that he could see them in years, but as he looked at them now, he suddenly became painfully aware that
Now that they were alone, neither of them was trying too hard to resist the gravitational pull towards the other. Draco leaned into his touch and Harry smiled. The past week had been quite the revelation. Things between them were still fresh, raw. But good. They hadn’t talked about everything yet, not by a long shot, but there had been much needed conversations regarding the most recent events before Harry had disappeared from Hogwarts.
Potter practically flew out of his chair and whirled around, drawing his wand—where the hell had he been keeping that?—in one fluid motion. Draco narrowly kept himself from flinching, forcing his posture to stay relaxed. If Potter decided to hex him in earnest, he probably wouldn’t stand a chance either way.
Severus tensed when Draco stepped behind Harry to get a look at the parchment, but the expected negative reaction didn’t come. Instead, Harry simply shifted to give Draco a better view, not a trace of James Potter’s competitive arrogance on his face. Draco nodded his thanks and Harry returned his attention to Severus, waiting expectantly.
Harry’s wandering hand disappeared. For a split-second Draco mourned the loss of it, then he gasped as Harry’s mouth closed around the tip of his erection. The feeling of a tongue, hot, wet, and perfect, tasting him. Draco moaned again, louder than before.
“Relax, Draco,” Harry was saying outside the door, “it’s Remus. And the potion is working, he knows who he is, he would never hurt me.”
Severus thanked him and left, making his way to his quarters quickly. Unsurprisingly, he found Draco pacing back and forth in his sitting room, flinching slightly when Severus entered.
. Maybe everyone felt like this in a relationship, Harry wouldn’t know, but somehow he doubted that. The way he and Draco fit together was…different. More. He’d certainly never felt anything like this for Cho, not even for Cedric, and his crush on Cedric had been much more intense than his feelings for Cho.
Immediately, the twins, Draco, Ginevra and Ronald Weasley began to list suggestions, and Severus leaned back with a satisfied smile. Apparently he hadn’t been all that wrong about what Harry would appreciate as a gift, even though it had undoubtedly been a risk to choose a live pet, and a lethal one at that.
Hours later, he grudgingly interrupted his reading when Narcissa announced that dinner was about to be served. Snape had left again long ago. For a moment, Harry wondered whether Snape had even spoken to Narcissa, or if he just left her to her own devices now that he’d brought her here.
“You’re right, eventually you’ll have to talk to Harry about these things. As much as I want to believe that you could overcome those difficulties, I am not him and I can’t speak for him,” Remus said. “Just, maybe allow him to warm up to you first? At least he speaks again during meals, so it
“No, he probably couldn’t get away with disappearing right under the eyes of so many Gryffindors.” Severus was watching him intently, his dark eyes heated.
“Well, I suppose I should go,” Blaise sighed. He shot Pansy a wink as he got out of his seat, adding, “I’ll tell you all about my other cousins when I get back.”
“Wards. Burning. Feels like injury,” Harry replied without stopping. He practically flew down the last few steps into the entrance hall, where he found himself staring at—
“I’m not entirely sure either, to be completely honest. In part it is what I said back then, a desire to have someone to be close to and relax with. Plus I can’t deny that I miss sex quite a bit.” He gave Severus a lopsided smile. “That in combination with the tension between us back then because of our argument—I suppose we just cracked under it.”
“The Dursleys never bought me new clothes, and I certainly didn’t have any money to buy my own. I always got my cousin’s old ones that he had outgrown. Now that I’m taller, it all fits me better than before actually,” Harry replied with a shrug.
“May I?” He reached out to Harry, who let him wrap the golden rope around his wrist. It looked stunning against his warm-toned tan skin. “They are a pair, connected by a spell.”
No, being with Draco felt nothing like a crush, or even a new relationship. Being with Draco felt like coming home. Like all their fighting had just been some elaborately disguised lead-up to this, because it was undeniable that they had learnt a lot about each other through it. Sometimes Harry wondered whether it should worry him how sure he was about Draco, given that it was so new. Whether it was somehow not real, a delusion. But every time he even considered that thought, he came to the firm conclusion that it was very much real to him, and it seemed to be equally real to Draco. It was just…right.
“Certainly, Mr Potter,” Burgock keened. “If you would simply sign here—” He waved his hand at the scroll, which grew a few inches, revealing a line for a signature. “—and provide a single drop of blood next to your signature. Yes, right here.”
Meanwhile Draco had handed his letter to Narcissa, watching her anxiously as she unfolded it. A smile spread on her face.
Remus could practically feel his heart being ripped apart, as he watched silent tears spilling from Harry’s eyes. His cub. Remus got to his feet and padded over to the bed to softly nudge the side of Harry’s head. Even on all fours, he was on eye-level with the black-haired boy sitting curled up on the bed. When Harry finally looked up at him, his green eyes were filled with so much sadness and desperation that Remus had to restrain himself to stifle a loud howl.
The second floor had clearly not been renovated yet. He didn’t see much merit in digging through the chaos and moved on quickly.
Harry gave a satisfied nod at the cowed crowd. “Good, now that that’s cleared up, let’s move on to that demonstration I promised.” He turned to Remus with a slight smirk. “What do you think, Remus, duelling floor or natural terrain?”
“Because he was a Death Eater first.” There was no sign of judgement in her voice, she was merely stating a fact.
“Our new Potions Professor,” answered Harry, biting back an annoyed groan. “Guess we don’t really have a choice. Come on, Neville.”
I've also decided to try doing NaNoWriMo, meaning there will hopefully be quite a bit of progress to this story.
at the first sign of vulnerability? Because frankly, vulnerability is part of a friendship. What good is friendship if you can’t share your burdens with each other? You can’t run from people every time they get close to you, Severus.”
He just glared at her and didn’t respond. Harry sighed and carefully reached out to him, taking his hand, which finally made him look up without scowling.
“I would advise against it,” answered Severus. “It would be best if you acted like you did for the past five years, anything else would be suspicious.”
The urge to laugh died down immediately and Harry levelled a cold glare at her as he answered, “They are my friends. And if you don’t mind we’d appreciate some privacy again.”
There was a pause before Remus spoke again. “You don’t want to talk about it, I get it. I’ve told Severus to give you time and he respects that. But you have to eat something eventually, and your Occlumency lessons are still important. Do you think you can at least come down for that?”
Whaaaaaat, two chapters in one day? Yes, yes indeed, because NaNo is making me write 1666 words a day and I wrote two full chapters last night, meaning I get to update twice as well.
Draco scoffed. Who he really was, right. He wasn’t even entirely sure who he really was, let alone confident enough in it to show it to everyone just like that. Sure, he could drop his defences around Harry, but that didn’t mean that he could around other people. Besides, what if the way he was around Harry
Severus felt sharp anger rise in his gut. Albus had given his word to tell Minerva about his ridiculous request of Severus.
“Oh, and Severus,” Albus called after him, “if you happen to think of anyone who might be Harry’s father, you will tell me, won’t you? After all, you also knew Lily well.”
Harry hesitated. He did have his reasons for wanting to continue the DA that went beyond the desire to help other students to learn how to defend themselves, but he wasn’t sure how wise it would be to reveal those reasons.
“I’m looking for Trevor,” Neville responded without turning around, then dove back under the seat. “There you are!” He emerged, holding up his toad triumphantly. “Sorry, hi Har—” Neville broke off as he turned around, frowning. Harry couldn’t fully suppress a laugh as he watched realisation dawn on his friend, brown eyes widening comically. “Harry?!”
“Then he yanked Merope by her necklace and held that in Ogden’s face, screaming that the necklace was from Slytherin, that they were his last living descendants.”
During the rather tedious task, they somehow started several conversations, which eventually on the third day led to Harry recounting all his ridiculous adventures at Hogwarts so far. Draco, who had been listening in and occasionally moved a piece of furniture around, was barely able to hide his outrage at some of it. He insisted that he could’ve beaten McGonagall’s giant chess board much quicker than Ron, and without having to lose a vital piece like
Harry had to bite the inside of his cheek to stop himself from bursting out with laughter. A malicious grin flickered across Ginny’s face.
One hand still in Harry’s hair, keeping him in place, Draco used his other hand to push off the sink, turning them so Harry’s back was against the wall next to it. Harry’s arms came up around Draco’s waist, pulling him closer, and Draco felt Harry’s bulge pressing against his own rapidly swelling erection.
, Harry thought, suppressing a groan. Now they all knew. At least he wouldn’t have to repeat himself. When Remus moved, Harry flinched at the speed with which the man crossed the room, dropping to his knees in front of Harry and pulling him out of Draco’s arms and into a crushing embrace of his own.
Severus stood in the middle of his room, letting his eyes wander while pretending not to be curious. Harry almost laughed. He had to admit, since this whole…situation had kicked off, his potions teacher had certainly behaved markedly different from before. It wasn’t entirely unpleasant, although he was glad that Severus hadn’t tried to get closer to him too obviously. He wasn’t sure if he could let go of the deeply ingrained mistrust he had for the man, just based on the fact that they were related by blood. After all, he was related to the Dursleys by blood too, and he certainly wouldn’t trust
Draco was silent for a moment, watching Harry closely as he considered his words. His mind was screaming to find out what the hell this prophecy was about, but it was clear that Harry’s focus was somewhere else and he deserved support, not selfish curiosity.
Judging from the look on Remus’ face the man knew that there was more to it, but he knew better than to ask while they were out in the open.
By the fifth time Dumbledore had thrown him out of his mind, Harry was exhausted. Far too exhausted for the fact that he’d been sitting comfortably in a chair this entire time.
Harry didn’t know what to do. He looked over at Severus who was watching them with an expression Harry had never seen on him before.
, Severus, his family—a thing he wished for and has been deprived of his entire life. He wants nothing more than for you to love him as your son, he just never got a chance to say so, because you’d rather shut yourself away from the world than allow anyone to see you vulnerable. He
leave. I will not tolerate prejudice based on the decision a magical hat made when we were eleven years old. Understood? We are all on the same side.”
“Ron got it from the cupboard in the Potions classroom because he doesn’t have his own copy yet. I gave him mine to prevent him from whining about it the entire lesson.”
“Yes, I guess we do,” Severus replied, giving Remus a rare smile. It almost took Remus’ breath away how much a simple thing as a smile could change a face.
There were worse things than four people seeing him naked, even if two of them were his son and his godson. Things like bleeding to death. He pulled on his dressing gown over his pyjama and made his way downstairs, hoping to find at least one of the four in the kitchen.
She didn’t argue further, but he saw the way her jaw clenched in displeasure. She’d get over it, eventually. When he glanced over at Remus, he found the man frowning at him, clearly worried. Surely he wouldn’t have to explain the importance of his position to a member of the Order? True enough, Remus’ features smoothed over after barely more than a moment, and he gave Severus a small smile.
She smirked at him. “I heard your shower and figured you’d be hungry. It’s almost eleven. Remus should be down shortly, we met when he returned and went to rest a couple hours ago. I’ve sent your house-elf to fetch him.”
Harry cringed a little and tried to change the subject by asking about everyone’s O.W.L. results. It worked only partially, since Ginny and Luna hadn’t taken their O.W.L.s yet, so it was really only Neville musing whether McGonagall was going to accept him into her N.E.W.T. class with only an A.
“Not extensively, but the basics. I gained some interest in it during my N.E.W.T.s, although I focused rather on the potions-related aspect of it. You can do amazing things with healing potions, some far more effective than spells. Admittedly, they often lack the flexibility of precisely cast spells, especially against curses that don’t respond to healing magic itself in the first place.”
Harry sighed, not feeling particularly inclined to bare all his thoughts to Snape. “I tried to stay focused on my breath, as you told me to, sir,” he said, hoping that maybe Snape would be satisfied with a partial truth.
The door opened and Blaise, Theo, Vince and Greg filed in. Draco forced himself to give them a polite nod, reminding himself that they wouldn’t be able to read the messages even if they caught a glimpse. He focused back on his half-finished message.
It was now or never, and suddenly, Draco could barely breathe. If there had ever been a time for some foolhardy Gryffindor courage, it was now.
Inside, Dumbledore was lying on one couch apparently asleep, Severus was slumped on the other, his face buried in his hands. His head snapped up at the sound of the door opening, regarding them with wary eyes.
Severus’ non-verbal attack came so quickly, Draco’s breath hitched, but Harry deflected it with a mere flick of his wand. Soft gasps and “oohs” went around the room; even Blaise made an appreciative noise.
The Great Hall was filled with chatter when Severus entered through the door by the head table. He had barely sat down when Minerva led in the new first years for their sorting. The Sorting Hat sang its song as it did every year, but Severus was barely listening. Instead, he was scanning the crowd, paying special attention to the Slytherin table. Somewhere in this hall was a spy, a Death Eater with the task to kill Albus Dumbledore—and potential other orders the Dark Lord might not have told Severus about.
He waits a few seconds after Soto has left the ward to walk into her office, glancing at the beds down the ward and confirming that all of the curtains are closed. Then he looks over his shoulder at Rue. She usually stares at him anytime he’s near, but now she turns her gaze to her knees, picking at invisible lint as if to say, “I don’t see anything.”
with varying degrees of amusement and irritation. Rita Skeeter was particularly biased when it came to Draco (or any former Death Eater, for that matter), but some of the opinion pieces in the back of the paper make him crack a smile.
“It’s nice to meet you,” Narcissa says politely. Probably sensing that it would be weird to shake hands, Agnes smiles wide, though not wide enough to show her canines. Similarly to what she did the other day, she moves her thumb along the bottom of her chin, holds up her index fingers, joins them together, and then points at Narcissa.
Suddenly wishing that he had tea and biscuits to offer her, Draco nervously smooths over the front of his robes before he sits in his bed, a few feet away from where Narcissa sits in the armchair. She’s staring at him like he’s a ghost.
— so he makes his way through the crowd to the winding staircase, trying to find a familiar blond head.
He’s been telling himself that it’s impossible to find something for Draco, simply because he never wants anything. He has Isabelle, he has every potion supply under the sun, and he has his impressive collection of tea leaves. But Harry can admit that he was wrong — that’s not why it’s so difficult to figure this out.
They part ways when they arrive at Hogsmeade, agreeing to meet at the Three Broomsticks at noon, and Harry briskly makes his way to Madam Puddifoot’s.
“Well, all your vitals are normal. There haven’t been any changes in your magical core or your brain. I can’t be sure there isn’t any major trauma to them—unless you see a specialist,” Soto says a bit absently, jotting something down on her clipboard with that distracted air she always adopts after checkups.
He thinks of Draco, and his long, blond hair pulled into a messy bun, a stubborn strand always finding its way over his eye. His bottom lip is always pulled between his teeth when he brews, eyebrows furrowed when he counts his stirs.
He glances at Agnes’s cubicle when he walks past it, half-hoping she’ll poke her head out and wave or sign something, even if he won’t understand it. But she doesn’t. Unreasonable disappointment drops like a stone in his chest.
“This stays between us,” he whispers. Agnes rolls her eyes, but nods. “I went through Soto’s office yesterday.”
Madam Puddifoot bustles out from behind the counter and beams at him, eyes twinkling knowingly when he asks for her best Earl Grey leaves, and sends him on his way minutes later with a tin of it.
that he knows her name, and it’s on the tip of his tongue, but he can’t quite grasp it for a few moments. Potter’s frown steadily deepens, either in concern or impatience—or neither.
“What’s the bad news?” he asks hesitantly. Bryn’s expression turns sympathetic. They put the chart aside and lean forward ever-so-slightly, as if wanting to reach out to Draco. The dread he’s been feeling since the beginning of the meeting peaks.
“If that’s the case, maybe I should get the mistletoe going, eh?” Harry chokes on his drink and coughs, and Neville absently pats his back as Rosmerta continues. “I got some of the enchanted sprigs from the Weasley place, the ones that hold both parties in place until they do the deed. I was gonna save it for the Christmas party, but I’m thinking it’d look great hangin’ right above this booth. Whaddya say?” Rosmerta muses, eyes on the beam above Harry’s head, nodding and spreading her hands wide like she’s imagining something grand.
Harry’s heart twists. He isn’t sure what makes him do it, but he finds himself leaning forward and putting his hand over Draco’s, a thrum running up his arm at the touch. Draco’s eyes widen.
“Er, another day,” Potter says. And, yes, Draco is definitely more smug and reluctantly amused than annoyed, now. It’s something about how Potter’s glance darts from his knowing look, like he’s embarrassed about lying—or embarrassed that Draco can tell.
"That'll be the results," Bryn explains. They look over the few pages, humming in understanding occasionally at whatever they're reading.
Neat, purposeful, stylistic cursive. The loops on his R and O curl elegantly. The green ink shines in the light of the fire before it dries, color lightening slightly. He skims over the letter once more, making sure it sounds how he wants it to.
manage to overhear. He can’t possibly imagine how or why Potter managed to demote Soto. Surely, he can’t just do that over nothing.
“Yup,” Neville replies. “I’ll have to be alone for this, though, so I won’t ask for your help. You know how the mandrakes get at this age. Very picky about the humans they interact with. But I’m sure someone else could use your hands.”
But importantly, Saul was admitted in 1997, which means it’s unlikely he’s working with the potion thief—though it’s still not a good idea to rule him out completely. He hasn’t even spoken to Saul directly and has no idea if he’s capable of getting away with something like this.
The corner’s of Draco’s lips tighten. He’s not sure if it’s just him having an off-day, but her words sting.
He winds his fingers into Draco’s hair, messing it up even further, and Draco makes a small noise of protest against his lips.
Bryn seems to catch onto his unease, and adds: “I’ve watched them myself. There’s nothing, uh, too disagreeable. I think you would be interested in seeing them, actually, given your concern about what you read in the journal.”
The files are sorted by surnames, and fortunately, Draco knows everyone’s apart from Rue’s. It’s a little frustrating that he won’t be able to find hers with the amount of time he has, but he focuses instead of the ones he
Before he can figure out what’s happening, Draco’s lips are against his, hands gripping his collar to pull him close, and Harry sinks into the kiss. He can barely believe that this is happening.
She punctuates the sentence with a pointed finger and promptly walks away, leaving Harry to gape at her back.
If nothing else, Potter at least seems to be a competent healer, and has shown that he knows what he’s
After what feels like hours of struggling to hold a conversation with Draco, Filius finally gives up trying to get names out of people (Cuthbert, as he does every year, is the only one who broke) and deems it an appropriate time for gifts.
never say hello,” he points out, and Draco bats his hand absently. Harry’s eyes are glued to his fingers.
They slip through the secret passages, hands interlocked, avoiding the portraits and the possibility of running into other people.
“This is what a memory looks like in its physical form. It’s not very complicated to remove a memory, but once you do, it allows other people to watch it exactly as it was experienced. A magical instrument called a pensieve will make it so we can watch the memory.”
He debates leaving the bathroom and simply going back to his cubicle, knowing he’d be able to if he wants. But suddenly, he feels wretched
He tries not to think about it as he knocks on Agnes's curtains. There are voices on the other side, and Draco groans internally when he realizes it's the new patient and Gilderoy.
They’re silent for some time, content with not speaking, their fingers interlocked and moving to grip the railing between them. Their hands say everything they need to.
ever kissed, if you’ll recall,” Hermione cuts in smoothly, not looking up from her book, and Ron’s ears turn bright red. Harry laughs, Bill snickers — obviously having listened to their conversation, which is a little embarrassing — and Hermione stifles her chuckle behind her hand.
“I’m sorry I don’t firecall more. I’ve been meaning to, but it just slipped my mind.” Ron and Hermione share a look, and Harry fidgets nervously — he recognises that look. It’s
Draco appears behind Rosmerta, leaning in for a quick hug. His hair and shoulders are dusted in snowflakes, the tip of his nose pink and cheeks flushed, and Harry’s mouth goes dry. There’s always been something about Draco and the snow that makes his mind stop working, no matter how many times he’s seen it.
Draco, thankfully, isn’t looking at him. His eyes are focused on Isabelle in his lap, who’s kneading his leg and purring so loudly that Harry can hear it a few feet away. It brings a smile to his face.
Gilderoy was admitted before any of them, all the way back in 1993, and it doesn’t surprise Draco that Gilderoy took his own memories by accident. He tries to tell himself not to discredit Gilderoy over his
He takes a few calming breaths, willing his pulse to slow and his muscles to relax, before he swings his legs over the side of the bed. The sun is up completely now, and the rain has stopped. The breakfast tray is gone from the armchair—Soto most likely took it—and Draco’s stomach growls.
Draco’s stomach turns over. He has to turn his gaze away, unable to stand the sight of that wizard. He knows the only person that can be is Lord Voldemort, despite the fact that there weren’t any pictures of him in the
“I’ve been worried about her lately. I think she could do well to be around people this Christmas,” he says.
Part of him expects to be met with an invisible barrier when he reaches for the doorknob, but nothing happens. He glances at Rue, who’s gone back to staring, before he pushes one of the doors open.
“Good lad,” Soto says, grinning before she ducks out of Draco’s cubicle. He checks the clock—a quarter till twelve—and assumes that Narcissa will arrive soon, so he settles onto his pillows with an issue of the
“How’d you end up in Gryffindor, huh?” Rosmerta asks, squinting at him, and Harry splutters. “You better suck it up if you ever wanna make something between you two. From here on out, you’ll be gettin’ no more help from me. That’s my New Year’s resolution.”
Soto’s eyes soften, and she tilts her head as she regards him, and he knows he didn’t do a good job of hiding anything.
“Do you think mother and I would be welcome at the Burrow?” Draco finally asks, voice soft, not looking at Harry. Harry raises his eyebrows. He wasn’t expecting that.
“You can rely on me, Draco. If there’s anything you need, anything at all…” she trails off, eyes imploring. Draco smiles, suddenly thinking of Agnes.
And what about Agnes and Rue? Would they get into trouble for letting him sneak around the hospital without Wagner knowing?
The fire casts shadows over Draco’s face, throws his eyes into darkness, and Harry wishes he could see them. But then again, he’s not sure he could handle whatever look is in them right now.
“Malfoy, this is Healer Cassidy. They’re the best memory specialist in Britain,” Potter says. The admiration in his voice is obvious, even to Draco, and he ignores the spike of jealousy he feels at that. Cassidy blushes a bit, but turns their attention to Draco instead of replying to Potter.
“Healer Cassidy told me about the test results. I’m so sorry, Malfoy. Is there anything I can do to help?” Potter says. For the first time, there’s only a straightforward sincerity in his voice, and Draco doesn’t doubt that Potter is being honest.
It feels very strange, like it’s actually happening, but everything is hazy around the edges. His legs move of their own accord—he finds that he doesn’t quite care all that much—and carry him to just outside the door of the ward. He’s carrying too many vials to open the door, and begins to transfer them to one hand so he can go back to bed.
At noon exactly, Draco’s nerves as tight as a wire, someone raps softly on one of the metal poles hanging up his curtain.
But mostly, his irritability is because Soto never came to visit after she was demoted, not even to say goodbye or apologize for accidentally giving him the wrong potion. She doesn’t go to see Gilderoy, either, for all the years she was his healer.
The afternoon passes slowly, and Harry resists the urge to duck out of the party. The gifts pile up on the table, most of them small and seeming to also be wrapped by magic. He nurses a glass of gin, which was something Neville brought at Blaise’s insistence, and makes conversation with the other professors when he can.
“Thank you, Isabelle,” he murmurs, setting the vials on his bedside table in favour of scratching behind her ear. She trills happily.
Draco enters Harry’s office later, smelling faintly like whatever potions he’s been brewing. Asphodel and monkshood, Harry thinks, if his potions skills have improved at all — Merlin knows Draco has tried his damndest to teach Harry something.
He gives a sharp, small nod in response, digging into his pocket until he grabs hold of the potion vial that Soto gave him. It’s cool in his hand, and he welcomes it. He quickly uncorks the vial and brings it to his lips, steeling himself to open his mouth and just
Neville shoots him knowing looks, which he ignores. He glances to Draco’s face, and finds Draco staring back at him.
“Harry!” Rosmerta says when she spots him, cheeks rosy and eyes bright. “Thought I heard something about you being here.”
As quickly as Draco arrived, he’s gone, leaving Harry with a windowsill of snow and papers to grade.
Draco watches until the sky breaks and the rain falls more heavily, pounding against the roof and the window. He shuts his eyes, takes in the sound and loses his thoughts for a moment, before he shakes himself from it and walks to the bathroom.
Burgock turned towards the filing cabinets lining the walls and snapped his fingers. A drawer much further back flew open and a scroll of parchment flew right into the goblin’s hands.
Harry took his time to pull on the robes, hoping incessantly that Draco would already be done by the time he went back out. He lingered so long that he was only half-surprised when the sound of a curtain being pulled back announced someone entering his cubicle.
“Quite the present,” murmured Remus, giving Severus an amused smirk that sent a shiver down his spine.
Harry didn’t answer and continued to stare into the basket, until suddenly a small smile appeared on his lips and he let out a strange hissing sound. A feeling of triumph washed over Severus. The hiss was promptly answered in kind from inside the basket, and after a few turns of back and forth, Harry reached into it and pulled out a small snake that wrapped itself around his wrist. Several people gasped, and Charlie Weasley let out a delighted sound, leaning closer excitedly. The snake was nothing short of breathtaking. While at first sight its scales appeared to be black, they shimmered iridescent as soon as they were touched by light, refracting it back into the room as colourful sparkles.
In the meantime, the argument between Charlie and Molly was slowly turning into a shouting match, drawing everyone’s attention back to them. Arthur was trying to intervene, but Molly ignored him, and Charlie would not let Bill dissuade him either. It was Narcissa who eventually put an end to it by summoning one of the house-elves—Kibsy, Severus thought, although he wasn’t entirely sure—and loudly asking how far along the dinner preparations were. When the elf answered that dinner would soon be served, she announced that they would now relocate to the dining room downstairs, her tone making it clear that there was no argument about it.
“Well, we have more than enough evidence to accuse them of child abuse, both in the wizarding world and with the Muggle authorities. They know nothing yet of Harry’s newfound family, in fact, they might still suspect him to return home any day. They wouldn’t think to hide condemning remnants of Harry’s presence there, and once the authorities are at their door it would be too late. With enough evidence, they would be deemed unsuitable to look after a minor. We can take their son from them.”
He smiled and turned to collect his presents. Severus’ eyes followed him as he walked to the back of the room, but lingered on Molly as his gaze passed over her. She was frowning deeply, not at Charlie from their argument, but at Narcissa. Severus had to suppress a scoff. Of course Molly would not appreciate to see someone else in charge of the household—she was so used to being in control.
Finally, Harry could muster a small smile. The grief he felt hadn’t lessened in the least, but knowing that he wouldn’t have to return to the Dursleys, that he could stay at Grimmauld Place with Remus instead, was almost a dream come true. It was enough to momentarily distract him, at least.
Draco let out a laugh and shook his head again. Then he took a steadying breath and said, “Harry, I’ve
“So,” she said, folding her hands on the table, “now that we’re talking openly: Would you care to explain yourself?”
Harry doubled up on the muffling charm before he gave them a brief retelling of the memory and the Legilimency lesson. As expected, Hermione’s reaction to Harry’s success with Legilimency was an exaggerated version of Draco’s: shocked disbelief. It took him fifteen minutes to convince her that he had merely been lucky to know this kind of magic from healing. Eventually, she gave it a rest and started to pick Bob Ogden’s memory apart instead.
Harry didn’t bother to argue, the woman would do what she wanted either way. Rolling onto his back, he let out a heavy sigh. If he was going to stay in his room indefinitely, he might as well be productive in here.
Severus nodded mutely. “I thought I must’ve lost it somewhere, I never even considered that it’d still be here.” He frowned. “It can’t have been here all this time, though. I am absolutely certain I cleared all the cupboards at least once a year.”
“Why would I need this many variations of a shield charm if a regular Protego does the trick?” he whined.
“Of course,” Severus said softly, mentally preparing himself for what was about to follow. “Unfortunately, there is one more thing we must discuss.”
“Okay?” he said slowly. Perhaps it was best to just let the subject go if it irritated Hermione and Ginny so much.
“I’m glad you worked things out with him,” said Remus, keeping his voice calm. “Now would you care to explain to me what the
Fourth year was harder to talk about. He told them about his fight with Ron when his name had come out of the Goblet of Fire, which caused Draco to scoff and claim that he would never have abandoned Harry like that. The thought made Harry smile, because he actually believed him. The first and second task were quickly explained, but when he got to the third, Harry’s tale slowed down. He never really talked about what had happened during and after the third task, except for that one time for the Quibbler. But Draco and Narcissa turned out to be excellent listeners, never interrupting, only prompting sometimes when Harry seemed to be lost for words. Haltingly, he told them about the maze, the portkey, and the graveyard. About Cedric. At that point Draco moved to his side and wrapped an arm around his waist, even as Harry continued to levitate some furniture for Narcissa to clear out the stuff underneath. He told them about how Voldemort had returned, about their fight, and how he’d gotten away.
“I’m afraid not, my dear aunt, Lucius is otherwise occupied. But I thought, maybe you would keep me company? You see, I am merely a guest here, for now, and I would appreciate it ever so much if you could watch over me in my room. Wouldn’t you be more comfortable, too, with me, rather than in this noisy hallway?”
Remus had to resist the urge to go and check on the man sleeping in the next room. Severus’ blood-soaked return had shaken them all up quite a bit, Harry especially. He hadn’t spoken much during dinner, although Remus had been glad to see that his appetite was undeterred. Afterwards, he had insisted on staying with Remus, as if something terrible would happen if he left his side. Remus couldn’t help the slight feeling of guilt nagging away at him. His condition was making everything harder again.
The twins shared a glance, then shrugged and stowed away their wands. Their expressions had morphed from shock to intrigued curiosity. Weaslette and Mrs Weasley followed suit a few tense seconds later, though Mrs Weasley looked awfully unhappy as she did so. Weasley, however, kept his wand trained on Draco.
“Thank you,” Severus said eventually, which finally got Harry to lift his head again. “You saved my life.”
“Harry,” she began gently, putting a hand over his, “I imagine you’d rather not talk about it but I have to ask what happened between you and Severus. I can see how unhappy you are and I want to help you, but I don’t know how. Please, tell me what’s going on.”
just happened? He forced himself to take another deep breath, trying to expel the lingering scent of Severus from his nose. It lingered anyway. And
The countless comments on the ADHD representation on the last chapter made me so happy, y'all have no idea <3 I'm glad so many of you could relate or felt like you learnt something new. Makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.
They rounded a corner and Harry was pulled out of his thoughts by the incredibly bright storefront in front of them. The contrast to the dull, grey buildings flanking the twins’ shop was beyond stark, and Harry was struck speechless for a moment.
to talk about whatever was preoccupying him, he simply didn’t dare to. It made Draco curse every stupid thing he’d ever said, everything he’d done to make trusting him even harder than it already seemed to be in general for Harry.
Term was only one more week, maybe Ron and Hermione could visit him on their way home. He longed to talk to them about—
“Because it means that you’re not ashamed of me,” Draco said quietly, his words barely louder than a whisper.
Harry hesitated, but allowed Draco to pull him up and out of the room. Excited, Draco called for his mother to present her with the idea. Her initial look of concern disappeared quickly as Draco explained, and he turned to Harry with a satisfied smirk.
She was still watching him, lips slightly pursed and brows furrowed, so he went on, “That being said, I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to you. I’ve said some pretty awful things to you over the years and I’m sorry. It was what I thought would gain my father’s approval, which is of course not an excuse—it didn’t work anyway. I hope you accept my apology and can maybe even forgive me one day, though I would understand if that is too much to ask. Regardless, I wanted you to know that I do not subscribe to my father’s ideologies of blood-supremacy, and I wish I could take back the things I said and did to you. I am truly sorry.”
It was nothing like the bond between Narcissa and Draco had been. While the string was still reasonably thick, it was obviously not white. Instead, it was a gradient from purple on Snape’s end to teal on Draco’s end.
“Is it your spell?” he asked, keeping his voice as calm as he could. Somehow he had ended up taking the lead in this entire ordeal and he wasn’t entirely sure when it had happened.
“I’m afraid that’s exactly what I’m suggesting. It’s the safest place possible for anyone trying to hide from the Dark Lord. It’s perfect. And since I’ll have to teach Potter, I can check in with you regularly. You’d be safe.”
to cuddle, it bordered on witchcraft. One more unfairly perfect thing about him to add to Draco’s list—a list that was getting decidedly too long.
In reality, it was as much about war preparations as it was Remus updating Severus about Harry’s emotional state, which had drastically improved rather suddenly. Not that he wasn’t still grieving Sirius or still processing the prophecy and Severus being his father, but he seemed noticeably happier and far less tense. Perhaps it was the duelling training with Remus that gave his mood a boost, since he was able to let off some steam there on a daily basis now.
He stayed in the restroom for another minute, carefully slipping his Slytherin mask back on, the mask his friends knew him with. Then he opened the door and finally made his way back to his compartment.
Severus looked up from his reading when his wards alerted him, announcing a visitor. There weren’t many people the wards allowed to enter by his office, so the list of potential visitors was rather short. True enough, Severus wasn’t surprised when he saw Draco Malfoy stepping through the connecting door into his quarters.
For a long time, Remus simply listened to Harry breathe, content to lie there and serve as a living pillow if it made his cub feel safe. Then, he heard soft voices from downstairs. If he hadn’t been in his wolf form, he wouldn’t have understood a single word, but as it was he was easily able to follow the dispute going on down below.
With his hair up, that stubborn strand in his face as usual, Draco approaches the table and gestures for Harry to follow. He does, rolling up his own sleeves as he nears the table, listening to the rises and falls of Draco’s voice as he instructs Harry on how to handle the Skele-Gro. It has to be cooled and stabilized magically before put into the bottles.
“Ah, thanks for offering, but I just finished eating, myself,” he declines genially. Agnes pops the bit of toast into her mouth with a shrug, giving Draco a glimpse of her sharp canines as she chews. He turns his gaze away—thinking that he’d be uncomfortable if someone was watching
He looks around as he walks, feeling quite pleasant—lighter than air—though not really sure where he’s going. He knows he has to go somewhere, though. Wherever
“Potter. This child was caught in the fire,” memory-Draco says, voice carrying over the shouts in the room. Potter turns his sharp gaze upon memory-Draco and the child, and his eyes widen. His composure breaks.
He realizes that this is yesterday’s sickness settling in. He squeezes his eyes shut against the spinning room, attempting to lean against the wall, but underestimates the distance.
Harry shakes off the memories and ducks into Madam Puddifoot’s, the bell above the door chiming. The warmth of the shop hits him, and he gives a satisfied sigh, looking around for Madam Puddifoot. The shop is empty, save for a lone patron in the corner, face hidden behind an issue of
There’s something nagging at him that he can’t put his finger on, like something he’s supposed to be doing or remember, but he has no luck in thinking of what it could be. He knows he’ll quickly grow frustrated if he thinks too much about it, so he tries to focus on something else instead.
“Careful, love, that almost sounds bitter,” Rosmerta says, and he clears his throat, rubbing the back of his neck.
Alone yet again and sticking to the shadows, Harry locates the nearest table of food. His stomach growls at the sight and smell of everything. There’s a slice of treacle tart with his name on it.
Draco places his letter on top of the ever-present stack of newspapers and eats his lunch slowly. He figures that he's put off seeing Agnes for long enough. By now, he thinks in amusement, she might be closer to the new patient than she is with him.
” they begin, muttering the words under their breath over and over, repeatedly moving their wand in a complex hexagonal pattern. Their eyes are focused completely on a seemingly arbitrary part of the wall behind Draco, hardly blinking at all as they perform the spell.
My OC swooped in and stole the chapter from me, whoops. It’s theirs now. And because I love them, I just let it happen. Hope you don't mind. :D
If he wanted to, he could just ignore the message. He could pretend he lost his memories of the “mission” too, and no one could question him. He’s not even entirely sure that he
He feels himself relax completely, almost against his will. It’s so unlike what he was expecting, and so calming, that he can’t help his eyes falling shut, and all his tension and irritation slips away from him. He absently thinks that he could fall asleep, if this continues.
— Draco is beautiful. Hair mussed, falling out of the bun, the strands blowing against his neck in the breeze.
Potter leaves shortly after, claiming he has paperwork to do, which Draco doesn’t believe one bit. Unfortunately, he can’t keep holding Potter’s hand forever, and he’s starting to grow tired.
Draco eyes them skeptically, wondering how this could relate to his question, until he recognizes one as the vial he had yesterday morning. It’s completely empty now, the glass tinted the same shade of green as the potion it held yesterday. The other vial holds a teal potion, bubbling slightly and glinting in the light.
He looks around his small cubicle at the off-white curtains and walls, his green armchair, neatly-made bed, and the hundred-or-so newspapers on the floor. It’s all very neat and clean, and could certainly pass whatever standards Narcissa might have.
“Come on, I’ll take you back to your ward,” he says, setting off at a brisk pace before Draco can reply.
“Look, I don’t know what you were doing in there, but you’re going to have to come with—” he stops speaking abruptly, eyes widening as he fully takes in Draco’s appearance. “Oh. You’re a patient.”
Harry looks for only a bit longer, before he retreats into his bedroom to get a couple more hours of sleep in. It’s too early for anything at all, but especially pining — he can do that when he’s rested.
He finds himself holding his breath as he thinks about the memories, trying to figure out what’s so wrong about them. A moment passes, then another and another. Suddenly, white fear hits him, throat tightening with the realization that he doesn’t recognize the name he’d written on the note. It has to be his
“I didn’t expect to see you here, Rosmerta. The pub closed?” Harry asks. He expected Rosmerta to keep it open as usual. Rosmerta winks as she pours something in Harry’s glass. He shrugs. He may as well take it.
Feeling like he’s done something wrong without knowing what it is or what he should say, he hesitates.
He thinks for a moment, fiddling with a loose thread on the sleeve of his robes. Based on everything he’s learned about who he was, he’s not even sure he actually
He resists reading the rest of his file, aware that he doesn’t have much time, and moves his search to the other drawers in the cabinet. Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how he looks at it), the other drawers are full of old patient files that would do him no good.
They find the twins where Neville said they were, overlooking the first floor and making sure nobody is dying or getting too handsy. But the night is young, and there’ll be opportunities for that later, Harry supposes.
. Harry mentally berates himself for looking, and turns his gaze up. Draco’s hair is tied in an elegantly braided bun, full lips painted pink, eyelids shimmery and blue.
He watches her go. Almost immediately, she disappears in the darkness of the night. Another flick of his wrist, and the window is shut and the water is gone.
“I’d forget too,” Hermione starts, “if I was lonely and pining and wasting all my chances to correct that.”
Once Isabelle leaves him, everything is quiet and empty. He misses the soft sound of her paws pattering on the floor the second she’s gone.
It’s clear how difficult it is for Potter to remain professional—and even if Draco isn’t really helping, Potter has surely had unfriendly patients before. And besides,
“Physically,” he starts, before he hesitates. Should he tell Bryn about his concerns with the potion and the brief two days of nausea—can he trust them? He’s afraid that he’s been too open, too naive. Decision made, he continues: “I’ve been tired. I wake up feeling more tired than when I went to sleep. Is that normal?”
Trying to focus on something other than her staring at him, he downs the rest of his tea, even though it’s cold, and smooths down the front of his robes again. He hopes that Soto will be as eager as usual to leave and not think much of him hovering by her office. Otherwise, he’ll have sat here for nothing.
As Harry nears and stops next to Draco, he shifts his stance to match Harry’s, and the action makes his heart flutter a bit. He has to resist invading Draco’s personal space to see the expression on his face.
“What’s gotten into you?” Draco asks, corners of his lips pulling down as he squints at Harry. “You look... constipated.”
“Thirsty. And confused,” he adds, tearing his eyes away from the space the clipboard had been. He licks his cracked lips. “Where am I?”
“Sorry,” he murmurs. He’s mortified when he feels a flush creep up his neck, though he’s not quite sure why or how to stop it.
He goes over everything he knows in his head: his name is Draco Malfoy, he is twenty-nine years old, he used to work for the Aurors at the Ministry of Magic, his parents’ names are Lucius and Narcissa, he was hit by a strong curse that took away his memories, and now he stays in the Janus-Thickey Ward. Miraculously, he still remembers magic and broader concepts like reading and writing, even places like the Ministry and Hogwarts.
They walk to the potions lab together, the world quiet, apart from their footsteps on the stone. They walk through the winding dungeons, most of the portraits on the walls yawning and glaring at them as they pass. They’ve evidently gotten used to sleeping in while classes are out.
, with his smirks and knowing eyes and heart-stopping beauty. How is Harry supposed to deal with those kinds of things?
Anaise seems skeptical, but accepts it. He steps towards the window, removing his wand from its holster as he does. The window opens with a flick of his wrist. Stray drops of water land on the window sill.
He wants to sink into the blankets for a bit longer, not even wanting to reach for his wand to warm himself up, but a rhythmic
They sit quietly for a long time after that. Gilderoy’s snores are loud, but not louder than Potter’s steady, easy breathing directly across from him. He realizes at some point that his breath has synced with Potter’s, and he has half a mind to make himself stop, but can’t be bothered.
check. He quickly finds Agnes’s file, which is the thickest one there, probably a hundred pages thick—which makes sense if Agnes has really been there as long as she said she has.
To say he’s nervous would be an understatement. He has no idea what to expect from the healer, or the meeting. Narcissa’s warning not to see a brain specialist weighs on him, but he reasons that there must be a difference between a memory and a brain specialist, right?
Draco licks his lips. Hesitates, for a moment, before turning the parchment over and scratching a list down. Potion ingredients. He scratches the words down, folds the parchment, and tucks it into an envelope.
“Do you think Neville would miss us if we left?” Draco asks in his ear, voice low. His breath sends a slight shiver down Harry’s spine. He wonders if Draco intended that.
He thought that reading the journal would be a welcome insight into the person he used to be. He thought that he’d learn something crucial to what it means to be Draco Malfoy, that he would learn to be normal—to be
the only Draco that exists anymore—doesn’t have a million experiences, and certainly doesn’t understand the ones he once had.
“No, no,” he says lightly. “I’m just asking you to distract Wagner if he decides to impulsively check on me. He shouldn’t, but in the off-chance he does…”
He looks at the journal and the sign language books on his bedside table, swallowing against the lump in his throat. He'll read the sign language books later, but he doesn't know if he can open the journal again.
“You’re welcome,” Harry whispers. It’s only then that Harry realises how close they are to the mistletoe. He swallows thickly, excusing himself from the party, and ignores Draco’s questioning looks.
thoughts, exactly as he had them and when they happened. He eagerly unwraps the package, skimming over the covers of two sign language books, but puts them aside in favor of a worn, leather-bound journal.
, ducking out of the examination room. He spares a glance at Draco, and if Draco didn’t know any better, he’d think it was a look of concern.
His patience snaps, and he scowls in Agnes’s direction, roughly jerking his curtain back further as he abandons the paper and stomps to her bed. How is he supposed to learn anything about who he is if he can’t even hear himself think?
Draco lets out a small breath. Things will be much easier if he can exit the ward whenever he pleases.
“You’re on, I say Samhain at the very latest,” said Minerva, straightening in her seat as she composed herself again. “But enough of teenage romance; how are you enjoying your new position?”
The tears he’d been trying to hold back spilled over Harry’s face. All he managed was a shaky nod before the first sob escaped his throat and his composure broke.
He was pacing restlessly back and forth in the kitchen, feeling Remus’ eyes on him. Narcissa had left Grimmauld Place half an hour ago to pick up her son directly from Hogsmeade. They were bound to return any minute.
Harry complied and waited as Severus settled Dumbledore onto an old couch. Only now did he notice that one of Dumbledore’s hands looked rotten and black.
The snake had grown quite a bit already in the month he had her. Where she’d been barely as long as his forearm before, she now easily stretched from his shoulder to his fingertips — unless she shrunk herself down, which only worked half of the time so far. To Harry’s amusement, Sirona herself had been quite surprised when he’d mentioned that ability to her, as if she hadn’t been aware that she could do such a thing. Sometimes Harry could hardly believe that the Ministry classified prism vipers as XXXX level magical creatures*, Sirona was so adorable. But then again, she was still rather young.
“Then you have to try again, you have to tell him,” she urged, but Harry pulled back his hand at once.
Has it been way too long since the last update? Yes. Is it because Whumptober stole all my dopamine for two bloody months? Also yes.
“Why do you have to be killed in the first place?” Harry asked. “Why not live as long as possible until the curse runs its course? Are you even sure it can’t be removed? There might still be a way to heal you.”
Severus hesitated. He knew what Remus meant, of course. Dark arts. Admittedly, it wouldn’t hurt if Harry were able to use more destructive spells—he was most likely going to be fighting Death Eaters after all. And Harry would never abuse such spells and use them against innocents.
“Harry,” Remus said softly, and Harry realised he’d been speechlessly staring at the bright almost-white thread connecting him to Snape.
Before anyone else could ask anything of him, he spun and finally fled to his quarters for some well-deserved rest.
Harry unpacked package after package, revealing several books, a knitted jumper with a big H on it, a variety of products from the twins’ shop, and new Quidditch gloves. A book on defence magic, along with a shrinkable practice dummy that could be set up in the garden, turned out to be from Remus, which meant they were through the Weasley-part of the gift pile. The numerous packages from Draco’s mother were next, and Draco was as curious as Harry as the latter tore into the paper to reveal…more clothing?
“I’m trying to give him that time,” Severus replied quietly. “Really, I am, but at the same time I feel like I should be trying harder, should do more. I don’t know. I feel like I should be approaching him, show him that I want to fix things, tell him why I did some of the things I did, tell him I’m sorry for them.”
He fled to the hidden library, one of the only rooms he still hadn’t shown Draco. Only when his bracelet kept pulsing against his wrist, signalling him that Draco was looking for him, did he leave again to go back to his room. They didn’t talk that night, and though Draco initially tried asking him what had happened, he quickly figured that Harry was not up for a retelling.
“I invented all sorts of spells,” Severus replied. “Without any friends, I had nothing better to do than to experiment—mostly with potions, but I also dabbled in spell-work. This particular curse was one of the last ones I ever finalised, along with its counter-curse. At that time, I was already involved with countless Death Eaters and prospective Death Eaters, since most of the upper year Slytherins intended to join the Dark Lord upon graduation. When they learned of my experiments, they encouraged me to try my hand at something more…
Draco had to admit that it was rather endearing. Their conversation shifted to less serious things then, such as how Sirona felt about her new designated spot in Harry’s room. When they dispersed from the dining room a short while later, Draco was almost content again. Almost.
it overwhelming him. He hadn’t been able think straight, and before he’d realised what he was doing, he’d pressed Draco up against the wall and bloody
He glared at her, but conceded eventually, returning to his seat at the head of the table where Harry usually sat. Narcissa sat back down as poised as ever, always in perfect control of herself. Severus had always admired that about her, even back when she’d still been at Hogwarts. He’d had originally met her through Lucius, but in the end, she’d turned out to be the better friend and a much better parent to Draco. And despite the fact that her fiancé—and eventually husband—had been the opposite of discreet about his relationship with Severus, Narcissa had always been kind to him. But her kindness was not to be misinterpreted as weakness, the woman could be lethal if she so desired. Now, her anger seemed controlled, but Severus knew that this didn’t mean that she wouldn’t retaliate. Indeed, when she spoke again, Severus could practically watch a plan form behind her eyes.
, but Harry adjusted within a heartbeat leaving only the feeling of soft lips and a searing tongue that kept moving around Draco’s tip.
Their eyes met and Harry lost himself in the silver for a moment, overwhelmed by all his senses screaming
An hour later he was on his second cup of coffee and feeling much more like himself. Blaise was reading the
He crossed his arms, stubbornly setting his jaw. Harry rolled his eyes and seemed to relent, as he grabbed Draco’s arm and manoeuvred him into a corner, before pointing his wand right at him. Some past reflex in Draco wanted to flinch and draw his own wand, but before he could even think about moving, Harry was already casting.
At a questioning glance from Harry, Draco’s mother smiled and explained, “I might have overheard you saying that you wanted some Muggle clothing as well, since it was—how did you put it?—a different level of comfortable. I do hope I’ve made the right assumptions regarding your taste, I based it on your preferences in wizarding attire.”
Narcissa. Disbelievingly, Harry checked his watch: Half past seven. He must’ve missed the chime that usually called everyone for dinner. He’d been lying around moping for more than four hours.
Severus’ chest felt tight. Unbearably tight. A wave of emotion threatened to overcome him and, almost instinctively, he slammed his Occlumency shields up. Instantly, he was calm. Detached.
Theo shrugged. “I’m just saying it might be worth keeping an eye on. We’re N.E.W.T. students now, and I personally don’t want to lose out on a potential advantage just because it involves Potter. Where’s your Slytherin spirit, Parkinson? We’re supposed to be resourceful.”
Draco didn’t look too happy, but he nodded. Before leaving, however, he pulled Harry close once more, giving him a rather passionate kiss. Severus wasn’t sure whether he should look away or not.
Harry nodded, collecting himself. With a deep breath, he pushed himself out of Draco’s arms. He pulled his knees against his chest, resting his chin on top, and tried to sort his thoughts, tried to figure out where to begin.
“Yes, quite. I’ve never seen Draco so unguarded before, I do hope it keeps up once the school year starts.”
“Mother heard you,” Draco said, barely meeting Severus’ eyes. “You and the Dark Lord. She heard what he plans for me and— I can’t do this, I don’t want to be a Death Eater.”
To his relief, Draco relaxed against him immediately and when he looked down, he was met with sparkling silver eyes that shone with an undoubtedly positive emotion, even though Harry couldn’t exactly decipher what it was. It was good enough in Harry’s book that he didn’t look appalled at the idea. Much unlike Ron.
And sure enough, only two days later Potter broke. Draco didn’t even do much. He simply bumped into Potter’s side as he tried to get past Draco down the stairs, but instead of arrogant indifference, this time Potter reacted, shoving Draco back with considerably more force than he’d expected.
“It’s only because I know how you fight now,” Harry replied with a shrug, then pointed his wand at Remus and murmured a healing spell.
After that, Draco’s frustration festered and grew rapidly. How dare the arrogant git ignore him? Carefully avoiding the watchful eyes of his mother, Severus and Lupin, Draco returned to his usual routine of aggravating Potter; sneers, muttered insults, discreet shoves and hexes. It had remarkably little effect, which in turn aggravated Draco.
“Thank you. For the bracelet. You have no idea how much it means to me that you would give me such a thing. I truly love it.”
“Harry, please,” Draco whined, his twitching hips pinned in place and unable to move to seek friction.
Would he have grown up with his mother and James? Would Severus really have switched sides eventually? Would he have patched things up with Harry’s mother some day, and would she have told him that Harry was his son? Would Neville be called the Chosen One now, while he’d be nothing more than a normal boy with parents—three of them, even? Then again, despite Voldemort choosing Harry, Neville had lost his parents all the same—they may not be dead, but he’d lost them.
“I used to have that kind of unshakeable faith in him,” Harry replied, holding Hermione’s gaze steadily, “until I started asking myself how exactly he had earned it. He’s just a man in the end, Hermione. People make mistakes. Plural. I don’t doubt that Dumbledore wants Voldemort gone and is doing his best to achieve it, but he’s not infallible. We can’t just blindly rely on him.”
The next carriage pulled up and Severus’ question answered itself when Harry and his friends climbed out of it. Compared to Draco, Harry moved at almost startling speed, quickly catching up to the Slytherins who were now being controlled by Filch.
He snapped out of it as a tiny second year student squeezed past him and went up to his dorm. Within minutes, he was ready for bed. Ever since Harry and he had started to take their showers together whenever possible, his habit of showering in the evening had been slowly replaced by a preference for morning showers. All Harry’s fault.
“Yes, but they can take care of themselves. Although I could theoretically summon them here I suppose, if you should wish so.”
Harry shot him a quick grin. “You cannot say a single word to anyone else. Not even Narcissa and Remus — for now at least — I don’t want to completely ignore Dumbledore’s orders. I’m trying to go along with his wishes and keep it as secret as possible, so for now I’m only telling you.”
“It’s true!” Harry insisted. “You’ve always been gorgeous, but I sort of figured you only started to think of me like this since— well, since the charms came off.”
He dropped down onto the blue couch and set his bags full of books and robes down on the floor. Ron and Ginny followed suit, settling on the red couch, and Hermione only hesitated a couple seconds before sitting down next to Harry.
He slips out of bed, sliding his feet into his slippers, and bends to scratch Isabelle’s chin as she drops the bag by his feet. Her fur is soft beneath his fingers.
The lights start to pulse stronger and more frequently as Bryn’s muttering grows more confident. Draco has to cover his eyes as the blue light glows even brighter, until Bryn abruptly swipes their wand as if slicing the air—maybe cutting through the thread—and the line snaps into four, the pieces slowly turning a deep, dreadful black.
But, on the other hand, it’s exactly as he wrote in the journal: everything seems to go back to Potter. The only history Draco knows anything about is with Potter—and
He’s not sure that he’s going to find anything useful, considering he doesn’t quite know what to make of the letter Narcissa gave him, but he has two lists now. It wouldn’t hurt to compare them.
Soto’s desk doesn’t have much on it apart from the mugs that Draco placed on it. There’s a framed photo of her and a similar-looking witch—Draco would guess she’s Soto’s sister—laughing as students. Soto’s tie is yellow and black, her sister’s green and silver, their school robes shifting in the wind. Red and orange leaves fall all around them, and Draco feels a stab in his chest when he sees how care-free Soto looks.
Rosmerta grins, almost feral, and rubs her hands together. “I like your mind, Zabini. That husband of yours been wearin’ off on you.”
But then he thinks of the potions and his attacker, and suddenly things are twisting around in his head and making everything more complicated.
As he makes his way through it, he somehow loses track of time, and eventually Soto stops by with lunch. Her expression is soft when she sees him with the sign language book in his lap, attempting to sign the letter K, and Draco flushes as he sets everything aside.
His curiosity peaks when he sees the next page (“Patient Notes”), but he doesn’t keep reading Agnes’s file. He’s already seen everything he needs to know, and learning more would only intrude on her privacy. It’s difficult to push aside his desire to know more about her, but he closes the folder and slides it back into place.
Draco runs his hand through his hair, at a loss. Any information must be in the other healer’s offices—if there’s any at all. He doesn’t know how he’s going to get into their offices without a wand, but he’ll have to figure it out.
“No, no, that’s for Percy,” he explains, easing back into the seat and pulling off his gloves. Neville lets out a relieved sigh, and Harry gives him a significant look with his next words. “Anyway, you aren’t supposed to know that I drew Draco’s name, remember? Filius would have our heads if he knew I told you… and who knows, he could have spies on us
Draco falls silent at that, and Harry wishes he could see Draco’s expression clearer, worried he said something he shouldn’t have. The space between them feels like a chasm.
sort of make sense—even if he doesn’t understand how Potter was in the position to demote people. Still, something doesn't add up about the potions. He pushes the thought aside for later, when Potter isn’t sitting directly across from him.
Agnes barks, getting Draco’s attention again and pulling him away from darkening thoughts. She points to herself, then to him, before clasping her hands in front of her and moving them down her stomach. Puzzled, Draco tilts his head at her and smiles apologetically.
Minerva, who’s three drinks deep already. She’s flushed, and her eyes are a little glassy, but otherwise, she holds herself pretty well. She keeps trying to nudge Harry in Draco’s direction, and Draco notices almost as soon as she starts doing it, so Harry makes his escape quickly.
Draco swallows roughly and mutters his agreement. Steels himself as Bryn brushes their dark hair from their eyes and turns their clipboard around to show Draco.
“I don’t know. Both are important,” he admits, voice soft. The more he thinks about it, the more he realizes that it
Reading over Saul’s, Draco feels a little disgusted—Saul’s leg that Agnes mentioned as being “sometimes there, and sometimes not” was
“Breakfast, love. Have you done your reading today?” Soto asks warmly. Draco drags the tray closer, peering down at the fried egg, toast, and sausages. At least he has two sausages today.
Firenze, who keeps tugging on his ugly Christmas tie, muttering about how there’s no good cheese at this year’s party. Harry has to agree with him — last year had a large variety, but this year there are more baked goods than cheeses. It’s a shame, really.
He decides that today, he’ll sign hello to Agnes and introduce himself to the new patient. There’s nothing better to do while waiting for Narcissa’s reply, first of all—and secondly, it would distract him from the odd sense of unease in his chest. As if something bad is about to happen.
“I’m sorry, what?” he says, affronted. This can’t be happening. Just yesterday morning, Potter didn’t want anything to do with him, but now he’s here as Draco’s
Narcissa sent an owl to him earlier that morning, letting him know she would visit him around noon, and he’s grateful she did. Apparently, he can nervously clean for hours.
“What’re your plans for Christmas?” Harry asks eventually, and Draco hums. They have this conversation every year with the same responses, but Harry always asks anyway, and Draco always answers.
He steps up to the basin on Bryn’s count, leaning over and slowly pressing his face into the pensieve when Bryn reaches three. He instinctively squeezes his eyes shut and holds his breath, even though he knows he doesn’t need to.
“It’s okay. I didn’t have my hopes up,” he replies softly, voice breaking and betraying his emotions.
Memory-Draco continues to talk at Potter. Draco doesn’t even hear the words, eyes caught on the differences in their expressions—Potter’s, growing increasingly indignant and disgusted, and memory-Draco’s, with a permanent curl of his lip and narrowed eyes.
“What did you do to poor Draco?” Neville mutters, and Harry laughs, but he’s a little concerned, once Draco takes a spoonful of porridge that he didn’t even add any sugar to.
“Would having a—a diagnosis mean I could get treatment if nothing is damaged?” he asks, trying to keep the note of hope out of his voice.
He rubs the back of his neck bashfully. Draco has obviously showered and dressed, wearing a simple black traveling cloak with his hair in a braid. He looks elegant and put-together, and Harry’s heart stutters.
He glances at them and licks his lips, hoping they didn’t see his blush. He closes his eyes as he imagines himself being pulled from the pensieve, and when he opens his eyes, he’s back in the examination room.
Draco sucks in a sharp breath. The drawings of Potter flash in his mind’s eye—drawn with such care and softness. Of everything in the journal, the one thing he
person is a mistake. But anything more is getting dangerously close to incompetence, and we can’t afford that,” Potter contends, and despite not previously having much thought on it, Draco’s blood
Agnes grins, stepping aside and gesturing for him to enter. He does, but stops when he sees an unfamiliar person sitting beside Agnes’s bed, dark hair and a gaunt face, eyeing him suspiciously. It’s clearly the new patient.
“It’s alright, mate,” Ron says sympathetically, going back to kneading the dough with Bill, and Harry worries his lip.
Neville gives him a gentle smile before going to open his own gift, which has stopped squirming as much. Draco and Harry watch in gross fascination as Neville peels back the paper. It turns out to be a Mimbulus Mimbletonia sapling, and Neville’s face lights up with joy, while both Draco and Harry take a good few steps back. They’re all too aware of how explosive and disgustingly sticky the plant can be.
And so far, Potter is the only person Draco knows he has a history with, apart from Narcissa. He hasn’t heard a single thing from or about any friends, so naturally has to assume that he didn’t even have any. But he knows about Potter—and Potter clearly knows about
He blinks, almost wondering if he’s hallucinating. He finally decides that no, he isn’t, and it would be rude to ignore her. So he smiles gently at her, before stepping up to the doors.
Though he feels a little guilty for it, Draco suspects that her presence is part of the reason why the trainee healers avoid staying in the ward too long—though he reasons that Agnes’s fur and Saul’s temper might do that, too. He could probably use that to his advantage, eventually.
“I’ll kill them,” he whispered, as he held Harry close to his chest. “I’ll find them and fucking kill them.”
Draco wished he had Harry’s map, then he could check whether Harry was still in Dumbledore’s office. When he’d shown it to Draco for the first time, Draco had been outraged. First, because that was an incredible breach of privacy — you could spy on anyone with that map! Second, because why had nobody in Slytherin thought of making such a thing? Draco was still adamant that he was going to figure out how the map worked and replicate it. Replicate and improve it, even.
“Yeah, yeah, whatever, consider it a birthday gift,” Weasley grunted, then added so quietly Severus barely heard him, “We’ll talk about the other thing some more later, alright?”
“It’s not a wild animal if raised by humans,” Charlie interrupted her. Molly made an annoyed noise and fully turned to face Charlie now.
Harry hadn’t moved at all, staring at Severus with those glowing green eyes, Lily’s eyes, unyieldingly. Where was his outburst?
Was about time Severus came clean about all that. Now Harry just has to accept any of it and give one of those chances Draco is so upset about.
For the next few hours, Draco was able to forget his lingering anxiety. After warming up with some lazy passes of the Quaffle—Harry turned out to be surprisingly competent with it—and a few practice shots at the goal-hoops, they switched to playing one-on-one seeker games, neither going easy on the other. Just because they were dating didn’t mean that they weren’t rivals anymore when it came to Quidditch—not even on Harry’s birthday. Draco held his own well enough, but when Remus called for them to come down Harry had a slight majority of victories.
That now got the attention of Draco’s mother, who had been talking quietly with the goblin who had greeted them upon entering. With a wave of her hand, she interrupted the goblin and stepped over to Draco and Harry.
The rest of the group uttered their goodbyes and Draco made his way across the common room to the sixth year dorms. He was already at the stairs when someone almost bumped into him.
“Alright,” came the quiet answer, then soft steps retreated from the room. Harry let out a breath of relief, although he felt decidedly guilty for his tone. It wasn’t Remus’ fault that Harry had made a fool of himself.
“I didn’t, actually,” said Harry. “I stayed at Grwml— What the—? Grnmpl— Oh for gods’ sake, that stupid Fidelius! I stayed with Remus, at a safe-house of a sort, which I can not name out loud right now because I am not Secret Keeper.”
A wave of gratitude at those words, mixed with the immense grief still squeezing his lungs, had Harry dissolve into sobs once more, and he tightened his arms around Remus. This time he wouldn’t let go, wouldn’t waste their time like he had with Sirius. He had barely even seen Sirius in the two years that he’d known him. Remus waited patiently, running his hand up and down Harry’s back soothingly.
His eyes were still bright green, he noted with relief. It was his one connection to his mother and he’d loathe to lose his only resemblance to her. Almost everything else about his face was different, though. Sharper. His cheekbones were high, his jaw was much more pronounced than he remembered. His nose was different, too, although only slightly—maybe a little straighter. He felt like he’d seen that nose before, but he couldn’t pinpoint where. His hair, however, was by far the most pronounced change. Whereas it had been perpetually messy before, it now fell in soft waves, shining deep black.
“I see,” said Ginny, tapping her lips, pretending to think. “Well, I’m afraid if you haven’t found him in the entire train I can’t help you. You see, sometimes Harry likes to disappear—” She made a dramatic pause, staring at the girls wide-eyed, and raised her hands mimicking an explosion. “—into
And with that he strode over to the door, breaking the locking charm without even thinking about it, and left. He kept to himself for the rest of the evening, and Draco let him, once more displaying his uncanny ability to know exactly when Harry needed comfort and when he actually wanted to be left alone.
“Do you have so little faith in me? Yes, it works,” he replied, getting a little uncomfortable under her scrutiny.
wanted to be well-rested for the trouble that most likely lay ahead. Harry followed him—still shirtless—and they quickly brushed their teeth before changing into pyjamas, which had Draco silently mourn the view of Harry’s naked chest. Now that he had gotten a glimpse, he wished Harry would never put on a shirt again.
“He’ll torture you,” Harry interrupted. “I’ve seen inside his mind often enough to know what happens to Death Eaters who displease him. Go, you’re already late.”
Here’s the second part of that way-too-long chapter that I split in two — which is why we’re still with Draco’s POV.
He finished his drink, set down the glass, got to his feet, and said, “I’m off to bed, see you all tomorrow.”
Severus waited patiently as the two shared a kiss; he knew it must be much harder for those two to play the roles of enemies than it was for him to feign dislike for Harry.
Draco took the syringe and put it back into the box, before pulling the leather bound journal from Harry’s lap.
Severus had tensed considerably at Remus’ blunt recital of his cruel deeds under You-Know-Who’s command. Remus thought for a moment before responding.
A frustrated noise escaped Draco’s throat, but Harry felt his pyjama-clad erection twitch against his own in unmistakeable excitement. Still grinning, he bent down to let his lips brush along Draco’s chest until he found a hard pink nipple. For a moment he just hovered above it, his breath ghosting over pale skin and letting Draco squirm until a soft whimper fell from those perfect lips, then, without any warning, he caught it between his teeth and pulled ever so slightly before sucking it into his mouth. Draco’s whole body jerked up as he let out a loud whine.
