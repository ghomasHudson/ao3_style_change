When Draco's testimony had concluded, they put Lucius on the stand. Harry figured it was late afternoon, but time moved strangely down in the courtrooms. He thought he should be feeling hungry, or tired, but he just felt on edge. It seemed the rest of the courtroom felt the same. Marchbanks didn't call for recess, instead she stared down at Lucius, as though analysing a particularly interesting insect.
Ladon smacked him on the arse, hard. He gasped and jolted forward against the couch, cock rubbing hard between his stomach and the velvety material.
Harry doesn't have to ask if it worked. He can feel it. An increased awareness of Malfoy, of how close he is, of how he smells; the heat from his body as he stands less than a foot away.
'Sit here, Harry,' Teddy said, pointing to the seat in front of him, as though he didn't think Harry had noticed it. Harry looked between Malfoy and the seat behind, where Teddy was sitting with Malfoy's son, who was bouncing eagerly on his seat. Andromeda was behind them, already deep in conversation with another woman Harry vaguely recognised as a Rosier.
Beside him, Draco is still, all pretence of eating his breakfast gone. Harry can feel his eyes and he takes a breath, continuing to read.
Draco finishes the laces on Harry's other boot and taps his leg to get him to lift it. He pulls Harry's boots and trousers off, then stands again and tugs Harry's tie free before he slips his shirt off his shoulders.
Harry stepped closer to Lucius, leaning down and lowering his voice, but Draco heard every word. He felt Harry's tone of menacing certainty fill him, calming him further.
'You're in one of our executive apartments. Your companion checked in a few hours ago.' She hands him a key card with a bright smile and a touch that lingers against his fingers just a moment too long. Harry forces himself to hold his smile.
Harry's eyes jerked up and he felt something in his chest twist. Robards didn't want him. Had never wanted him. He didn't know why, after all those years, that should still hurt.
In a second Malfoy's wand was out and pointed at him. Harry debated Apparating away, but he didn’t want Teddy to be alarmed at the idea that someone had been watching him.
'Take O'Neill off your board,' he said, voice leaving no room for argument. 'I'm going back out.'
'You,' Potter said, after a long moment.
Harry looked around, seeing most of the Aurors in various states of misery, hands tucked under arms, bulky coats over the standard-issue robes. Some looked to be having better luck than others with their Impervius charms
Hermione looked sympathetic. 'Me neither. But I started visiting them a few weeks ago, telling them I was researching, and -' she shrugged. 'It's not so bad in the daytime.'
They were halfway to the room Harry remembered interrogating Malfoy in when they heard the boom of an explosion in the distance. It was strong enough to shake the house around them. Harry spun immediately towards the sound, cursing as he saw Draco move the opposite direction, a light at the end of the corridor flickering into existence and then disappearing just as quickly.
'No reason we can't start again, then?'
His party would be good, he knew. His whole family was coming. Charlie had even come back from Romania, and Sue, Jones and a few from work were coming. Nev, Luna and some of the others from the annual Hogwarts get-together would be there. It would be good. An occasion to celebrate. The start of something new.
'Objection!' Elders cried. 'Leading the witness.'
'You're mine,' Malfoy said, pressing into him. 'No one else, Potter,' he growled in his ear.
Jones nodded. 'Right,' Harry said. 'Get a team on communications as well. Whoever is organising this must be talking somehow, and we need to find out how. Hopefully if anyone else is thinking of retaliating against Muggles we'll hear of that before it happens too. But get some plain clothes patrols out in the Muggle areas wizards are most likely to visit. And publicise that we're doing it too. Last thing we need is some bloody hothead attacking Muggles in some trumped up idea of payback.'
He would lift James up to his face for a kiss. James' hands would twist in his hair and Harry would just look at him. Just look and look and look as though his heart would burst.
'I think I need help,' Harry said at last, meeting Hermione's eyes in the dimness of the hospital room.
When Draco woke, the morning light was filtering through the curtains and there was a warm body against his back, an arm around his chest. He lay with his eyes closed a moment, savouring the familiarity of waking up together. Then he looked down, something in his chest squeezing as he saw dark skin, a calloused hand. Harry. Of course. Not Astoria.
Harry wants to say no, just to be contrary, but he knows that now he's up he'll need to eat soon. His metabolism is so much higher than it used to be. The amount of food he consumes on a daily basis is embarrassing.
task you're doing then, won't you, Mr Baggins.'
'It's probably best if I don't tell you more, Harry,' Luna said. 'I'm not really supposed to bring people with me, so I probably should wait and see what they would like to tell you.'
'Of course, Mr Malfoy. I - it was surely fate.'
He spun, ties dropping to the floor. 'That's—'
That wasn't what Malfoy was angling for, was it? Harry felt dread and a growing sense of inevitability spreading through him. Judging by the way he was living and the people he was meeting, Malfoy had the right sort of money and connections to sway people to his aims.
'I've watched you for years,' he said, glancing up to meet Harry's eyes, a faint blush spreading across his cheeks.
Ron's hesitancy didn't fade, if anything he began to look worried. 'We know what happened, Harry. Remember, they sent it all in a big letter. It was an accident. The was a gap in the wards and the window was left open. The monitoring charm wasn't set. The Erkling coming in was just an awful, awful accident.'
Harry took it and read though.
They're outside and Malfoy has organised the front desk to call him a taxi before Harry's thoughts catch up to where they're going and what they'll be doing when they get there.
Poor Harry. He's just not having a great life.
'Of course,' Davies says, as though oblivious to the messages running through the room. 'I'll need to refer you to a meeting with our Head of Operations to confirm your terms, but the gist of your proposal has been viewed favourably.'
Malfoy nods as their hands clasp. 'Call me Darius, please,' he says. Harry doesn't like the friendly tone in Malfoy's voice, or the way Davies' hand envelopes his.
- You go forth with your heart
'What,
mine!
Harry saw Marchbanks nod and scribble something down, and he mentally ticked that one off.
'Show me how the seals work,' was all he said in response.
Harry took a seat at the table and finished his smoke, vanishing it and itching to light up another in its place. Instead, he crossed his arms over his chest, brushing against his runes as he did so, setting the ones for Need and the Unknown into life. They would sharpen him—help him to sort fact from fiction, and help him to make the connections and understand just what the hell was going on. He pushed against the one for Stamina on his ribs as well, almost grunting as the hit of adrenaline entered his system and helped to burn away some of his exhaustion. He'd pay for it when he crashed later, but he needed the stimulant now.
Harry was almost speechless at the blindness of Javier's words. He pushed to his feet, clenching the table, white-knuckled.
'Is there a problem?' Malfoy asks, turning away from the floor to ceiling windows of the office, where he's been taking in the view of the city. 'I require Hunter with me at all times,' Malfoy says, and there is a touch of censure in his voice. It's just enough that the words 'at all times' convey a sense of intimacy.
Harry looks at the bracelet, faint doubt still tugging at him. Malfoy had said it straight out. He's very good at telling people what they want to hear and, specifically, he knows how to work a werewolf.
Jakub nodded agreeably at Harry's words and looked back over the water.
He stared sightlessly at the papers -
', to coat his hands in a much more effective form of Muggle rubber gloves. He hears Draco do the same, then he starts unlocking the cabinets one by one and sifting through their contents.
'I'm sorry,' was all he could say.
Harry freezes, trying to process the words that had been in his mind, the desperate edge to them, and the way Malfoy's scent has changed as he looks at the pictures, from aroused to disinterested. The mixed messages don't make sense to him. It's enough—
All they have to go on are three new scents. Davies is dead. He's no use to them now. Unless Draco has something, they're worse off than when they started.
Beside him Draco pours them both a glass then holds his up expectantly. Harry picks his up and clinks them together. The moon is bright enough that, combined with the streetlights far below, he can see Draco clearly.
of it.
Harry smiled and scooped more pasta onto his fork as he listened to Draco rant about one customer or another and their strange interests and requests. He'd thought, when they'd first started dating five years earlier, that Draco was unhappy with his job. He'd grown, quite quickly, to enjoy the way Draco brought his customers to life through his complaints, dramatically imbuing them with probably far more cunning, intelligence and vice than they actually possessed.
'I will see you soon, Catalyst,' the Horseman said.
The moment they're inside the lift Harry grabs Malfoy by the arm, his grip brutal. He doesn't know whether he's going to rip Malfoy's head off or force the truth from him and in that moment, he doesn't care.
He listens to the quiet exchange of words as Malfoy greets the person, then the squeak of the tray as it moves into the room. It's as the door clicks shut behind the trolley that Harry stiffens. The response he's hearing is wrong. The voice is deep. He knows them all by now, and he's never heard this one. And the scent is off. The man with the trolley smells like the street outside, cold and fresh. The breakfast staff always smell like the end of a long shift, like food and linens and cleaning products.
2. Someone is in my mind at night.
He woke early the next morning. His sleep had been fitful, more a forced relaxation from the 'weed than any true rest. He took a quick shower, banging at the pipes to try and get the hot to switch on, and then gave it up for a bad joke.
There was no sight of Malfoy in the entry and Andrews hesitated for a moment. Harry slipped in behind him and waited for him to close the door and continue through. He wanted Andrews to go first. Who knew what sort of situation the man was walking into. Malfoy could have hidden all sorts of traps in the rooms. Harry didn't want to be the one to spring them.
. He doesn't know how to deal with the surge of emotion rising in him. Draco wouldn't want anything to do with him now—if he ever had. Harry had almost assaulted him the night before. He's a monster. Despite what Draco says, Harry knows Draco wouldn't have been able to stop him.
Malfoy returns a few minutes later, sliding back in opposite Harry and placing another Firewhisky in front of him.
Harry was in a foul mood. He had been for the last week. It was like there was a darkness hanging over him and he had no idea how to clear it. The case was stalling - it felt like his whole life was stalling. He knew people had started avoiding him, coming to him only when they had to.
He raised an eyebrow at Harry's look of shock. 'Don't look so surprised. You wanted me to know, Potter. A part of you did, anyway - wanted to lay yourself bare before me. You're a better wizard than that - or you used to be.'
'Where's Ginny?' Harry asked.
Harry scowls. 'Ron didn't tell me you'd been working on this.'
lost him,' Lucius' lip curled in the hint of a  sneer and Draco felt his anger flare back to life again at his father's next words. 'He is my heir and
'Parkinson's been giving me strange glances for the last half hour,' Harry said, wondering if it was some lingering issue she had with him from the war. He hadn’t forgotten the moment she showed her true colours. He doubted she had either.
'Fidelitas,' he says, tapping the bracelet once.
It was Scorpius who answered, sitting up over the back of the couch with a wide grin and an excited shout.
'So good, Harry,' Ladon praised, voice husky. Then he moved back and Harry keened at the loss of the touch.
A few notes:
Harry felt sick as the words washed over him. This was not the line of attack he'd been anticipating. To know that this was going to be a fight pitting Draco against his father was far worse than he'd thought. Lucius was throwing his son under the bus, and Harry had never hated him more than at that moment.
'I'm here,' he said, mustering all of his Malfoy disdain and injecting it into his tone, 'Because I assured the Board that if anyone could get you to pull your oversized head out of your arse and see what help was being offered, it would be me.'
'Bloody hell, Harry,' Ron said, when he saw him. 'You look like a drowned rat. Raining down in Creature Control too then?'
The sounds of splashing from the bathroom down the hall had died down, so Harry assumed bath time was over. He moved down the passage, intending to use the toilet quickly, when he heard the faint sounds of a song coming from Scorpius' partially opened door.
Harry ripped himself out of the mind of the man in front of him and clenched his fists to stop the magic that was rising through every part of his body. He wanted to tear this building down, to bury every one of these bastards in it. He forced himself to breathe and to keep his magic contained. He bit his cheek until he tasted blood, hot and coppery, and then he let the Imperius Curse dissolve and blasted an Obliviation at the man that left him slack-jawed.
Mrs Norris took one look at his face as he stalked back to his desk and said, 'I'll move your caseload review meetings with the team leaders to first thing tomorrow morning, shall I?'
Harry stood as well. 'Thank you,' he said, earnestly. 'I appreciate your cooperation.'
'Harry?' came Hermione's voice from downstairs. Harry jumped at the unexpected sound and grabbed a black t-shirt. He pulled it on, then dashed downstairs. Hermione's head was in the Floo and she looked him up and down with curiosity.
'I will. Some day.'
the thing they need to be afraid of now.
He looked up to meet Ladon's eyes and licked his dry lips. Ladon's words rang through his mind.
He reached for more and more memories, trying to fill himself with them. They were tinged with sadness, every one of them, but he held them inside himself and hoped they would be enough.
Harry sees Malfoy's hand drop to his wand, but he doesn't even think to grab his own. That's never his first reaction anymore. His fingers flex against the table and he remembers the feeling of claws erupting through his skin. Strange how so many years of training can be overridden by foreign instincts so quickly.
'Yes, sir,' he said easily, the smile still on his lips.
She was cut off as Ron pulled her back down into the seat beside him.
who should have been home sleeping—who would have been if he hadn't gone out on a job at the last minute.
build up, twining with his desire and fanning it hotter. He wanted this. He
Malfoy sobered. 'But the other stuff - the stuff that I did that was cruel, and wrong, to you and others. I'm sorry for that.' He looked down again, his hand coming up to grip his left arm, to where Harry knew Voldemort's mark would still be branded.
the one who's using this magic to disrupt the entire Ministry and make people's lives hell.'
'What do you mean, fix this?' he said, voice rasping slightly. 'There is no fixing. He told me to leave him the fuck alone. He told me he never wants to see me again.
'Only around you,' I snap, and something in his face looks pleased at that response. I don't know why I said it. Except that it's true. I can't remember the last time I felt so much like myself, so much like I could choose what happened next.
'If you'll excuse me,' he said, inclining his head gracefully. The older woman couldn't hide the flash of relief that crossed her features, and Draco had to stop himself from rolling his eyes as he turned away.
is the threat.
'Fuck,' Harry rasped. 'Fuck, Charlie.' A sob escaped Harry's throat and he clenched his eyes shut as he slammed himself down on Draco's cock one last time before he started to come, the hot splashes of his release coating Draco's stomach.
'So, "Hunter", is it?' Markwell says, condescension in his tone as his gaze flicks over Harry again, this time in a look that seems to consider him to be more brawn than brains. Harry ignores his tone and the annoyance it stirs in him as he catches Markwell's scent. It's warm, just a hint of spice to it, layered over something darker. Something heady.
. The thought entered Harry's mind clear as crystal and he knew the truth of it down to his bones.
Harry laughed and leaned in to kiss Draco, feeling his want stir back to life as he pushed Draco's trousers off, taking his pants with them. He paused for just a moment, to lay Draco's robes out on the grass and put up an umbrella charm.
Harry's breath caught and he felt himself harden fully in an instant at the command in Draco's tone, at the idea of doing that for him. He turned from the room, making his way down the corridor. He stepped into the room at the end, on the right, noting that it was just as tastefully decorated as he'd thought all those months ago when he'd gotten a peek at it. The room was done in soft blues and grays, and Draco's bed was a four-poster.
Trina shook her head. 'Didn't really see him up close, and like I said, he kept his hood up. That was what made me notice him to start with - the robes. In this weather, most people've got their kit off, haven't they?' She gave Harry an appreciative glance and Harry tried to ignore the way her eyes lingered.
The boy looked up at his dad for approval and Draco nodded, then he put out a tiny hand.
, she hissed pensively.
'I'm coming through,' he said. 'Give me a minute to pay for international travel and I'll be over.'
Harry stood, shocked, mind racing as he tried to figure out what had gone wrong. He'd cast everything perfectly. Exactly as he'd been shown. He was doing nothing differently now. Nothing... except he was wearing his Invisibility Cloak. Was the cloak interfering with the magic's ability to pass beyond him? It was never normally a problem.
'This is Maggie,' Draco said, gesturing her forward.
Harry took another swig of his beer, then began to speak.
Harry moaned at the feeling, unable to stop himself from jerking forward. Malfoy's mouth was relentless, bringing him to the edge harder and faster than he ever had in his life. Within a minute he was crying out and spilling down Malfoy's throat.
Malfoy nods, seeming to relax slightly and Harry decides to see if he can get something out of him. He pushes for the question that's been most on his mind.
Weaving through it all. That melody. That song.
Harry shrugged slightly, his awareness on the heat of the contact of Draco's back against his arm, and on how easily he could lean in and capture his mouth in a kiss. Then he thought of the night before, and thought of wearing Ladon's collar and begging Ladon to let him come, and he stood back up slightly, breaking the contact.
'You are aware, of course, Head Auror, that Resolution 735 of the Rights and Justices Accorded to Citizens Under Suspicion of Crimes Act requires new evidence to be provided -
'No buts. Molly and Arthur were perfectly nice to you when we had them for dinner last month and you had your mark showing then too. It's fine. Let's go and have a good time, okay?'
Draco watched his father, some fragment of him wanting it not to be true, despite all of the evidence.
'Calm down, Potter. As always, you are the exception to every rule.'
Teddy's scream comes again. Harry hears his name, but it's fainter now, drifting away. He tenses at the sound of it, his instincts still urging him to go to the boy.
But then he seemed to shake himself as he reached for the rope at his side.
He looked down at the note in his hand. Would it be best to start the clean break from Ladon now? Or could he have this, just one more time, before it was gone forever? He cursed himself and his indecision. He'd talked this through in his mind so many times. He knew what the right thing was. He put the note in his pocket, not quite able to throw it away. He very much wanted to take the high road, to do things right, but the thought that this could be his last chance to be with Harry in this way pulled at him in a way he couldn't completely ignore.
Harry had meetings until eleven, but when he got back to his office, Draco was there as always, robes hung on the hook beside Harry. His shirt was a pale grey today, open at the neck and rolled up to his elbows. Harry paused in the doorway for a moment, just watching him. Draco lost himself in his work so easily and Harry had found himself stealing glances at him more and more lately.
'He absolutely is,' Harry said, meeting Ron's eyes with confidence. He reached into his coat and pulled Pheo out from where she was huddled around his neck.
Molly stepped back, holding him at arm's length.
He'd dreamed of the Forest again - the Acromantulas this time. He groped for his wand and cast at the lights, unable to sit in the darkness. Ron was the one who was scared of spiders, not him.
'Always were good at potions,' Harry says, eyes closed as he focuses on the feeling of Malfoy's touch against his skin. 'Diagnose me, P'fessor.'
'I was planning on coming inside,' he said, unable to help the cutting edge to his voice. He'd come here to ask for help. That didn't mean he could put up with being manhandled as well.
on Ron, who blinked and looked around sleepily. 'Was'appenin?'
It was a few more minutes before Malfoy came back into the kitchen, crossing to the cupboards above the fridge and pulling out two glasses, titling one towards Harry in a clear question.
Hermione looked startled for a moment, then she nodded slowly. 'It's just a concept, based on my conversations with Xenophilius and my research -'
Draco turns at Harry's movement and the look on his face is surprised for just an instant, before he pulls his wand as well and casts a sweeping Disillusionment Charm, which radiates out from the two of them. It hits the room at the same time as Harry tears the wards to pieces, and then the Aurors Apparate into view, sharp cracks filling the air as they immediately begin to fire Stunners into the crowd.
'Why have you left the bar open, then? Why not disappear?'
Harry watched Draco doing the same with Scorpius - the two of them chatting in a mix of French and English. When Scorpius ran off to join Rose at the seahorse tank, he stepped up beside Draco again.
Harry's cock was right there in front of him, hard and leaking, bobbing as he moved his hips, his legs writhing slightly on the bed, lost in the pleasure of what he was doing.
He glanced away, finishing the story and closing the book.
He thought the first step might be to uninstall the weapons, before he got to work on the mechanics.
'I need to go and check if Hugo went down okay,' Ron said, kissing Hermione lightly on the cheek and somehow communicating with her without words. She nodded slightly. He gave Harry a half smile and a last, troubled glance before he disappeared back up the stairs. Harry watched him go, a pang shooting through him at their familiarity. Had him and Ginny been in sync like that, when they were younger?
Harry reaches for the door handle only to find it locked. He shakes the door but it doesn't budge. He sets his shoulder to it. He has to get to Teddy. His scream comes again and Harry feels the sound echo through him. He hits the door again, panic surging in him.
Harry narrowed his eyes at Malfoy's sarcastic and dismissive tone. He was sick of being pushed away. There was something between them. He knew there was.
like he's faking it. There's something hungry in his expression that calls to Harry, makes him wants to lean back, to feel Malfoy against him. He shakes the impulse off and resists looking down at the bracelet on his wrist. Fucking thing.
Just as Harry is about to grab Malfoy and force him up, he stands and performs the same spell Harry had, calling all of his belongings to him and directing them into a suitcase with a neat flick.
He looks across at Draco, whose cheeks are faintly pink.
the person you have become.
Draco nodded, before he could help himself, then stopped. Pansy's ministrations paused for a moment as her eyes widened, then she continued, silently.
the same way as him. Protection. Pack. Loyalty. Honour.
Ladon shuffled the papers, then pulled out his wand, tapping them to banish them before he stood, looking down at Harry, something dark coming into his eyes.
Malfoy rolled his eyes but subsided back into the chair.
'You'll be fine,' he said, cupping Draco's cheek with one hand as he rested their foreheads together for a moment. 'Just don't let anything he says get under your skin.'
'Enough,' Conor said quietly, and she subsided, shutting her mouth with a snap and glaring at Harry with crossed arms.
What was he doing? He thought he'd been clear but it was all getting so messed up in his head. Catching Malfoy, solving the case, giving a shit about the missing people … it was all starting to mean less and less. He stayed under the spray for a long time, trying to drag himself into some sort of clarity - some sort of direction. Thoughts of the day he'd just had - just dreamt - kept intruding. He couldn't stop thinking about how right it had felt, how natural, to watch his son play with Draco's or to reach out and wipe a smudge of ice-cream from the corner of Draco's lips, bringing it to his mouth and smiling as Draco's eyes went dark and he looked away.
'Hello, Molly,' he said, a hint of a rasp still in his voice.
'Do you want to work together, then?' Harry asked, as the idea came to him. He forced casualness in his voice. He wanted to see if Malfoy had anything to do with this, that was all. He pushed the thought of the vulnerable little Peruvian out of his mind.
'I'm going to start by asking you a series of questions,' he said, 'to establish some facts. And then we will move into exploring your understanding and motives around a series of events.'
'So,' he said, as Harry scooped a mouthful, letting out an appreciative sound at the taste. It was delicious.
Malfoy shakes his head. 'What part of, "I've been on the run from the Aurors for ten years" didn't actually sink in, Potter?' he asks, and Harry can hear a hint of fear in his sneering response.
Harry looked down at Draco, then reached out to still his hand as he flicked the quill again and again. He felt the tingle of magic sparking between them as their skin touched, and then it dropped into a comforting murmur over him.
Draco let a small smile slip across his face. 'Indeed, Potter. Amazing, the way one's views about things can change.'
Harry looks down at the letter and feels the entire plan click into place in his mind. He glances up at Draco and lets a smile spread across his face. His wolf approves of his hunting tactics and he feels his smile sharpen with that approval. Somehow, rather than putting him off, the wolf's endorsement makes him relax. His wolf—the part of him that is the wolf—lives for the hunt. It wouldn't steer him wrong.
,' he swore viciously. He cast at the wards separating the crypts and the chapel from the world above. They were gone too. Shredded.
'This thing is like a Slytherin wet dream,' Harry says, and frowns as he hears the low rasp to his voice. He focuses on the garage door opening and the air he needs, to be able to clear the way he and Malfoy smell together from his mind.
Draco just grins and turns, stepping closer again and pulling Harry into a kiss that's deep and filthy. 'Part of you is,' he says, as he breaks the kiss, nipping lightly at Harry's lip, 'and I bet he's particularly keen to play.'
The Malfoy's voice was in his mind again. 'No? They hurt you even in memory? How about this, then?'
Four hours have passed by the time Malfoy stirs and wakes. Harry has been growing steadily more tense as each minute ticks by. He hasn't been this close to a full moon without his potion since the disastrous time he'd decided he hated it more than the thought of shifting. He'd ripped his house apart in his frenzy to escape and to hunt. Only the wards he'd forced Ron to build into Grimmauld had kept him from killing that night.
From the alley, he Apparated home, knowing what he needed as soon as he walked in the door. He sent an owl to Dean and then collected a bottle of Polyjuice. He didn't even grimace at the taste as he let the change wash over himself willingly. He didn't want to be Harry Potter anymore. His new body was hard and strong and tall and confident. Everything he knew he wasn't.
'Go to my bedroom,' Draco said, his voice calm, but unquestioningly in control. 'I need to get a few things organised. When I come in, I want you kneeling, naked, in the middle of the floor.'
'The way that sounds, when you talk like that,' Draco said, his voice rough. 'You have no idea -'
'When did it change?' he asked, voice hoarse.
'I need …' Harry licked his lips and tried again. 'I want - what we had. I want it again.' Draco could see the struggle it took for Harry to ask for that. To ask for what he wanted for no other reason than that he wanted it. A part of him marveled at how different Harry was from just a few months earlier, when he was so wrapped up inside the wrongness of his life that he couldn't even see what he needed, let alone ask for it. A part of him was so damned
Harry turned over all of their research to Ron. Every time they were questioned on it, Draco pointed to Harry as the person who'd brought it all together, who raided Davies, cracked the code, identified the locations. Harry wanted to argue, but he knows Draco will have a reason for it. He doesn't do anything without a reason. Harry can only hope it's a good one.
'If someone had told me at any time in the past twenty years that my money would be better off in the hands of Draco Malfoy -' He laughed again, but there was no edge to it.
'The trial is next week,' Draco said suddenly. He was watching Scorpius, a deliberate casualness to his posture that Harry could see straight through.
'Fuck,' Harry says, and it's almost a sob. He hunches forward slightly, wrapping his arms around his stomach as he squeezes his eyes closed. He feels Draco's other arm come around him as he's pulled into Draco's chest.
Malfoy cocks an eyebrow, pursing his lips. 'That's none of your business, Potter. Unless you have a warrant for my arrest?' His face makes it very clear he's aware Harry has no such thing.
Malfoy sneered again and it was an ugly, bitter thing. 'Voldermort never existed in the dreams, Potter. Not one of them. He's tainted every reality we have. The dreams will only ever be a fantasy. They can't be real. He made sure of that.'
. He took a drink from the glass in his hand instead, barely tasting the whisky as slid down his throat, washing the blood down with it.
Underneath were pictures of the six people Malfoy had named in his list of suspects. They'd gone up on the board the moment Summers' body had tested positive for magical influence. Front running theory was Imperius Curse.
They entered the Ministry through a side door Draco had never seen before and it took them straight to a set of lifts with only two options. DMLE on Level 2 and the Courtrooms via Level 9.
Ladon reached up, wrapping one of the ropes around his wrist and pulling sharply. It came free from the wire grid suspended above the stage and spooled in a pile at his feet. In a quick and practiced movement, he laid it out on the stage, so that it was doubled when he picked it back up. It was a thin cord, about the width of a finger, Harry guessed, brown and smooth. He wondered what it would feel like.
'Tuesday sounds great,' he said, feeling his mood lift slightly at the thought of it. 'I'll be working but I'll try and get away as close to seven as I can.'
Harry thought about himself and snorted. Gods knew he wasn't the person he had been eight years ago. He wondered if the old him would even recognise who he'd become now.
Harry watches him for a moment, gauging his reaction. Malfoy
Harry rolled his eyes, but couldn't keep any sort of annoyance going as Pheo finished her hunt and slithered sluggishly to the edge of the desk. Without hesitating Malfoy reached out a hand and she curled onto it, belly distended with the evidence of her meal. Malfoy transferred her to his shoulder, where she draped herself over his neck comfortably.
It was two days before Harry was judged as knowledgeable enough to be let outside. He'd been given five of the remaining ten names to investigate. Rick had apparently returned and crossed Saunders off the list while Harry had been practising the forms of the seals. He looked at his list. He knew which one he should track down first; John O'Neill, arms dealer. But there had never been any question in his mind about which name he'd start with. He'd copied every piece of information they had about Malfoy, despite the fact that he wasn't on Harry's list. The sheets he'd stolen were tucked away inside his Mokeskin pouch.
Malfoy didn't respond. He just stared at Harry, thin lipped. Harry stared back, surprise filling him when the instant rejection he had been expecting didn't come.
Harry looked at him and realised the decision was simple - no matter what was between them, or because of it, he wanted Draco. A surge of fierce possessiveness rose up in him at the thought that this might be gone, that the fragments of the future he'd started to imagine might be taken from him.
'You were out of your mind,' Malfoy says, voice flat.
He was woken the next morning by a tapping at his window. He raised his head groggily and checked the time. It was already seven. He needed to get up if he had any hope of getting to work on time. He pushed the covers back and stumbled over to the window, opening it for the insistent bird. It held its leg out and Harry took the letter automatically, turning it over and absently Accio-ing his glasses from his bedside table.
Potter looks up sharply and shakes his head. 'No, I— I just,' he frowns and drinks again. 'I just saw you and then I couldn't get you out of my head and I just wanted to know what you were doing, and I didn't think it was actually
As he thought, his mum was at the kitchen table with Lucy, feeding her spoonfuls of the pumpkin mush that was all she would eat right now.
'I was thinking of taking Scorpius to the aquarium,' Draco said, the casualness in his tone seeming almost overdone.
onto the bottom and then tied it back to the owl's leg. The bird took off immediately and Harry watched it go for a moment, anticipation already building in him about the night to come.
There's silence behind him and Harry takes that as an agreement.
Draco nodded.
'Walter Parkin.' Parkin had jumped in front of an Avada meant for him.
'Sit down safely, please,' Malfoy said, at the same time as Harry grinned and said, 'Sure did. And my name's Harry, what's yours?'
Draco's hand hovered over Harry's cock, so close that he could feel the heat of it. His whole focus narrowed to that almost-touch. Then Draco looked into Harry's eyes and Harry forced his attention away from his cock.
, he tells himself, trying to force the wolf and the bond to listen to him. His roiling emotions don't calm in the slightest and he hates how out of control that makes him feel.
He'd done some research earlier that day into Malfoy's pardon as well - the idea that he was out for good behaviour was ludicrous. Malfoy wouldn't know good behaviour if it bit him on the arse. No, Harry would be willing to bet the Malfoy fortune had a lot more to do with it. That idea just made him even angrier - the thought that people like the Malfoys could buy their way out of - or into - whatever they wanted. People had to pay for their crimes - had to pay with something meaningful, not just pull money from an inexhaustible supply.
Draco frowned, and Harry knew he was thinking of how the Ministry had seized the entire estate. Draco hadn't been upset about the loss of the building, per se. In fact he'd even advocated for it to be rehabilitated and turned into the base for the new Magical-Muggle Education Reform headquarters, eventually to become a school.
Ron just reached for a memo template and his compendium of Forms For Every Occasion: A Ministry Guide. He handed both to Harry. Harry grunted slightly under the weight of the tome, then dropped into a seat at Ron's desk. He put his chunky black boots up on the edge as he flicked through until he found what he needed. He began scribbling.
'Why do you want me on this case?'
Malfoy arched an eyebrow at Andrews, poised at the edge of no return and then Andrews spoke, setting the glass down hard so his drink slopped over the edge as he did.
Malfoy says it in such a matter of fact tone that Harry gets a sudden insight into the way he must have lived for the past ten years. The way he's managed, somehow, to stay off every radar.
Potter!
After a moment the room began to shift, things reverting to the way they were.
Harry looks at him, surprise running through him at the question. He hadn't even thought of it—hadn't even considered that he might set Malfoy up to be arrested. Had he really turned about so completely on his view of Malfoy?
'And then I walked into the room,' Draco said, the edge of his anguish still in his voice, 'my old room, and he was there, like a spider in its web, hovering over my drugged and unconscious son.'
He woke to the smell. The sharp, over-clean smell of the hospital. Harry groaned, forcing his eyes open and struggling to sit up before his consciousness had even caught up with him.
'Lord Minchum, so glad you could make it tonight. And Lady Minchum. A pleasure.'
I'd love to know, as always about what you thought of that chapter, or the whole story. I'm always happy to chat on tumblr or discord as quicksilvermaid as well <3
them. He was himself.  Not watching himself, but feeling how he had, remembering what he'd thought at that time.
'Harry?' Hermione said, twisting to look around at the place his voice had come from. Harry realised he'd forgotten he was wearing the cloak and he cursed himself. He could have Apparated away again without them even knowing he was there.
Malfoy's answering grin is sharp and contains a dark glee that steals its way inside Harry's chest and sits lodged there. He is so fucked.
Harry nodded again and Draco leaned forward over Scorpius' head, cupping Harry's cheek with one hand as he pulled him into a kiss that ached with tenderness.
Harry ignored it and kept reading, filing away the various sightings and connections she had made. They would all be valuable.
, he thinks.
Malfoy's made ham and cheese toasties and Harry sees him make a face at the way Harry's talking with his mouth full. He hums before answering. 'I've been thinking about it. I assume they'll know I lived through the attack, though you'd be better off choosing a different glamour so they don't ask too many questions about how you survived the Jimsonweed.' For a moment Malfoy looks like
'Oh, dear boy,' she said, reaching forward and gathering him into another embrace. Harry struggled to hold back the emotion swirling within him. He couldn't cry. He didn't deserve to cry over this. If anyone should be crying, it was Molly.
Malfoy hesitated before he huffed a sigh. 'Fine. I suppose you want some entertainment while you're here?'
Malfoy seems to relax slightly and he leans back. 'That's fine. I'm not expecting it to be constant contact. We start tomorrow night. I'll bring the bonding object with me. I've booked my first meeting with a lower-level entry point. I need to get to the top eventually, hence the time. To get what I need, I'll undoubtedly have to prove myself in a number of ways. That's why I'll be expected to bring you. Markwell is wealthy, and known to be shady, but wealth and a dirty background alone aren't going to get me to the person I need.'
He concentrated on trying to steady his breath, twitching slightly as he waited to see what Ladon would do next. He heard the shuffle of movement again, and then a click and a buzzing sound. He tensed, worried suddenly that it was the agiel. He didn’t think - knew he didn't want that pain on his sensitive areas. The buzz clicked off and Ladon put his hand on Harry's leg, seeming to guess what he'd been worried about.
you if I have to. The only reason I can do what I do is that nobody has any idea who I am. Veritas is a hundred people and no one, all at once. The moment a thread gets pulled and pieces start to be linked, what I have will fall to pieces.'
Ron had dropped out of the Auror program post-graduation, and somehow the Department had never got around to revoking his access. He often stopped by to chat and cast his eye over some case or other. Harry privately thought he would make a great investigator, and sometimes he thought Ron's visits had less to do with him and more to do with the idea that, just for a moment, he could be a part of this life.
'Good,' Ladon murmured. 'Let's begin.'
The way that had felt comfortable, welcome in some unconscious way. He was such a fool.
Sue's eyes widened slightly, the only sign of her shock.
Jeffries was a stickler for his filing, so Harry had no trouble finding Malfoy's case and flipping to the most recent updates. There was a packet of dry biscuits in the drawer as well, so Harry opened them, eating them one by one as he read. His stomach protested at him, wanting something more substantial. He couldn't remember the last time he'd eaten. Yesterday? The day before?
Harry frowned at his appearance and rubbed a hand over his chin. He hadn't shaved all week and his beard was thick against his jawline. He considered running a shaving charm over it, but then shrugged and pulled the band out of his hair instead. He collected it up to another messy topknot, trying to get as many of the unruly strands as he could. He cast a quick freshening charm over himself, looked his jeans and black v-neck t-shirt over and then decided that would do.
. Besides, he wasn't quite sure if the offer to fly together was such a great idea, though something in him yearned to really challenge himself against Malfoy again.
'Could what?' Harry asked, though another mouthful.
Harry looked up at the older woman and the serene satisfaction on her face suddenly reminded him of Umbridge all those years ago - so secure in the knowledge that she was doing the right thing but so utterly wrong in those convictions.
Draco was at his wit's end. It had been eight days and he'd had no response from Harry. No indication that there had ever been anything between them. He'd stopped sending letters after day three when one of Pansy's owls had come back singed. Harry's Floo and Apparition coordinates were blocked. Draco wondered if that was a precaution due to the media shitstorm that had exploded once word of the Potter-Weasley divorce had got out. But his attempt at entering the Ministry had also been met with a very clear indication that he, specifically, been added to a 'banned entrants' list. More than that, he'd got the feeling that he was very close to being called in for questioning, from the way the Aurors at the doors watched him with sharp eyes.
'We were never friends,' he said, voice cold and hard. 'We fucked years ago. And then you left. And this is my damned son's funeral so I need you to leave again, right the fuck now.'
Draco held up a hand and Pansy stopped, sighing again, looking him in the eyes and dropping the haughty expression. All of a sudden her voice was real and Draco knew that his Malfoy mask hid nothing from Pansy - it never did. 'All I'm saying is go out some time and have some fun. Have a fuck. Whatever you need. Just open up a little.'
Harry broke the silence. 'It's good to see you,' he said, smiling again. 'I've missed you.'
'Visual too?' Harry asks, nodding his head at the huge glass window opposite them.
Draco's smile sharpens as he brings his other hand up to clasp Rothwell's as well. 'Indeed. Terrible shame he met his end in such a gruesome fashion.'
this.
Draco grit his teeth in the face of his father's casual slight, trying not to let it worm its way inside him. He was not damaged. He had remade himself. Healed himself. Draco felt, rather than saw, Harry step forward, his presence somehow calming, giving Draco the strength he needed to stand before his father.
Harry's mind stuttered, fixed on the word that had just left Ladon's mouth. He felt an ache in his chest. No one ever called him that, just let it tumble easily from their lips. He wanted to hear it again.
The final word was like a hiss in his ear as another memory shimmered to life in front of him.
'Cedric Diggory.' Harry had told him to touch the cup. Had said they should do it together. The
'Since I doubt you've ever hosted a tea party, Potter, let me fill you in on a few details. As gauche as it is to talk money … Yes, the Ball will cost me a knut to put on - the budget's at about 1.2 million Galleons at last count.' He held up a hand as Harry sat forward to protest, no doubt at the outrageously high sum.
Ladon had seemed … okay with it. Harry found it hard to remember the man's exact response. But he certainly hadn't been angry. In fact Harry had thought it strange just how okay he had been with it. That was part of what had sent his mood spiraling again, he remembered, the idea that Ladon didn't care if he stayed away because he had ruined the scene. He knew that hadn't been true. Ladon had told him it hadn't been true. But everything had been so messy - still felt so messy.
Then he considered the question and how best to answer it. His real reasons, his impending divorce, his need for something new, the way he'd been rocketing from one thing to another for what felt like months now … those were things he had no interest in sharing with a former schoolmate who'd been on the other side of a war.
As for the children, it seems they've been sold, some more than once, into private homes, or to the highest bidder. Harry doesn't need to ask what for. He knows.
The rumble was louder now. A sharp crack of thunder shook the Ministry beneath their feet and Harry looked up. His alarm rose as he saw black thunderclouds began to fill the sky.
He pushes open the bedroom door to see Draco in front of the mirror wearing a pair of Harry's combat pants and heavy boots, resized to fit his slimmer form. He has a heavy jacket on that Harry recognises as his as well.
They pass Harry's favourite coffee shop—Carol's—and Harry looks in the window, his stomach reminding him that he hasn't eaten in a few hours. He used to come to this place all the time for lunch with Ron. They haven't seemed to make that regular meetup happen anywhere near as much since Harry left the Ministry.
The voice inside him whispered again, asking why it mattered that Ladon approved of his choices, but Harry pushed it away, looking up as Ladon spoke.
Harry shook his head, the feeling desperation rising in him making the action sharp. 'It's not just that, though,' he said, leaning forward, and reaching for Draco's hand. Draco glanced towards his movement and his fingers twitched, but he didn't reach for Harry.
Ron nods without taking his eyes off Draco, but Robards and Kingsley exchange glances. Robards opens his mouth to speak but Harry overrides him. 'Your word,' he says, voice hard, 'or the two of us walk out of here and when this case explodes, I can guarantee the story in the papers won't be one you want told.'
'What
happened? He remembered the party. Talking to Malfoy. And then -
Draco felt himself tense further at the words. Harry had never brought this up before.
Draco sped up his movements. Harry closed his eyes, the panting cries leaving his mouth and the look on his face signalling his orgasm was approaching fast.
Harry ignored him. 'What's wrong with Victor?'
Draco's French at the aquarium:
The Junior Auror who'd brought the boxes in - Evan? No Euan. Euan Abercrombie - looked up. 'Smith asked me to tell you that yes, there are a lot of similarities so far. These photos are all static too. They're sorted into two piles. That's how we found them.'
He pulled his wand out and held it loosely in his fingers, gathering his magic and holding it ready.
Harry takes a deep breath and watches the child as the auctioneer steps up beside him. 'I will open the bidding at three hundred thousand Galleons,' he says. There is a flurry of action in the room as bids are placed immediately, travelling higher and higher as the smell of lust in the room grows.
He looked back down at the assignment. The top of the file read
Luna tilted her head to one side, considering him. 'Do you see them too?'
'That's an interesting one,' he says. 'Number of tunnels all around Britain, o'course. Let me see.'
'You have to protect him,' Harry said, feeling a twinge of jealousy - that Ladon had someone to care for? He didn’t know. He pushed it away and looked back down, breaking eye contact. The glint of gold on Ladon's finger caught his eye.
'You're wrong,' she said flatly. '
He remembered his thoughts from the night before. There was something about Malfoy that called to him—something that told Harry he needed to watch him, that something was wrong with him. He closed his eyes as he concentrated on the spell and hoped that he wasn't fucking everything up by following his gut.
They walked through the gate behind Ron and Harry stopped as he took in the display before him. The Burrow was overtaken with bunting and streamers, and everywhere there were pictures of Harry's head looking down at him laughing or winking or giving some official speech.
Ginny was watching him curiously. He could see the question in her eyes, knew that she wanted to ask him about the man he'd kissed, about whether there was something more to it. He didn't want to talk to her about Ladon. Couldn't
He shook his head, fighting off the nausea, fighting to take a breath. She'd killed James. He'd been avenging his son. He had to do it. He repeated that to himself. He'd
'Yeah,' he murmured. 'He's helping a lot.'
Ginny was silent, her mouth set. Tears began to shimmer in her eyes.
Harry's eyes widened and he sucked in a sharp breath, feeling anxiety race through him. He couldn't do this. Not now. Not after what he'd just heard. He had to be prepared before he did this. Had to have time to
Harry tried to ignore the headache building behind his eyes at the thought of another layer of shit to deal with. He made a note to himself to write to Ginny and make sure she was ok, then the lift stopped and he stepped out into the Atrium.
He forces himself to hold off. He doesn't want this to be over. He wants to do this for the rest of his life. Neither of them can stop touching, tasting. Draco's hands are all over him, pulling at his clothes, scratching down his skin, urging him faster and harder. Harry shoves him against the wall with every thrust and his shirt is hanging off his shoulders now. Draco looks so absolutely, totally
A moment later, the bed dips beside him as Malfoy sits on the edge, then Malfoy's hands are back on his skin and the cool wetness of the cloth is wiping blood from him again. It feels nice. Malfoy feels nice. The last of the panicked feeling fades and Harry can't hear anything but the sound of Malfoy's heartbeat and his soft breathing in the dim light.
Potter blushed slightly and looked away, then glanced back almost immediately. Draco felt the satisfaction of guessing right: Potter's husband liked to surprise him with sex. That certainly hadn't been in any of the memories Potter had surrendered for the purpose of his therapy. Sex was never a part of the sessions Draco led. The idea of doing
He could feel his magic rising to the surface, as if drawn to them, and he forced himself to relax, to let it. Draco had said this would be safe as long as he didn't fight it. He trusted Draco.
It's the moon, he knows that. He always gets more protective this close to the full moon; always fixates more on people. This level of emotion, though—jealousy—is one he doesn't normally experience. He doesn't like it. He especially doesn't like that it's directed at Malfoy. Fucking wolf. Why should he care who Malfoy whored himself out to in the past?
'Not so fast, Potter,' Draco said, looking down at him with a sharp smile. 'I want you to beg for it.'
'Only you could be so monumentally stupid,' Malfoy continued, voice hard and flat. Harry felt a spark of fear and he span around again, trying to find Malfoy in the darkness.
War's eyes flicked down to his wand and it bared its teeth in anger. Harry caught a flash of the sharp-edged fangs again before they disappeared.
Sex seems to be how they solve most of their arguments now.
It took him a long moment to hear the voice calling his name, feel the hands on his body.
'Hey, Gin,' he said, leaning against the trunk and remembering countless hot summers days out here, talking about everything and nothing. He glanced over and saw Draco watching him, his eyes returning to Arthur when he caught Harry's glance.
'I'm fine,' he said with a smile. 'Overextended a bit is all. How are you? Were you on shift last night?'
Scorpius giggled, shaking his head. 'Noooo,' he said. 'They don't have hands.'
'You can come like this, can't you, Harry?' Draco said, not missing the way Harry shivered at his words, eyes closing for a moment as his movements slowed.
He nods.
Harry thought about following that statement up, but it fitted with what he'd assumed and something more interesting had been playing on his mind. 'How come I noticed you?'
'Always saving my life, Potter,' he said quietly, chest thumping as Harry leaned into his touch, his eyes drifting slightly closed.
He had flipped it open and was about to read when something spasmed hard in his chest. Of course it wasn't from his father. It couldn't be. His father was dead. The dream where he wasn't was just that. A dream.
'How was your day?' he asks instead, and Hermione launches into a detailed discussion of the meeting she's had with members of MACUSA and the Bulgarian Ministry of Magic.
'We've stopped the
Harry looked at it in surprise, 'No, wait,' he said. 'I've got one more thing. It's worth it. I promise.'
'Did you shield your son?' he asked Draco with a raised eyebrow.
They were lists, each of them. Names, ages, dates and locations. Details of deaths that didn't stack up; illnesses that shouldn't have killed, creatures that shouldn't have been where they were found, gruesome murders with no clues at the scene. Harry pulled a pen towards himself and ran his finger down the lists, ticking off those he'd already investigated, and putting a star next to three in Czechia that he'd need to look into while he was here. He compared the letters side by side. There was a cluster in Italy that looked promising. Nothing yet had directed him there, so it was a possibility this was something new, something that could bring him closer to James' killer.
Draco just pulls him back into another kiss as he tilts his hips, urging Harry on. Harry keeps it slow and deep, wanting to take his time, wanting to cover Draco and to feel every part of their bodies aligned.
Harry's fluid movement jerked to a halt, the second word in the invocation dying on his lips. His eyes snapped to the face of the creature in front of him.
'I'm serious, Malfoy,' Harry says. 'It's getting too close now. You need to tie me or stun me or something.'
They watched the show a while longer, making comments now and again about an architectural decision that looked hideous, or a price blow out.
- Magic is might.
Malfoy seems to be taking his time tonight. Harry lies in the dark as he listens to Malfoy working himself over. Every now and again his movements speed up, the rustling of the sheets and the gasps joining them. Harry can hear Malfoy getting closer and closer to the moment of release before he stops, all movement ceasing as he pants heavily.
'Harry? Harry, wake up. You're going to be late.'
'What are you doing here, Potter?' Draco asked and Harry tried to hide his pain at the anger that was still present in Draco's voice. Draco wanted his, but he was clearly still hurting from Harry's accusations and from whatever emotions he'd stirred up with his talk of Parkinson.
That seems to be the right decision, as 'Joseph,' simply moves back to his desk and begins clicking away at his computer. Harry thinks about his own team, and how he'd never let them become so concerned about challenging him that they let someone walk into a building wearing his face.
Ladon glanced at the chair for a moment and then picked up a black rubber figure eight. He gestured for Harry to stand and then grasped his cock firmly at the base, slipping the ring down over it, and looping the other half around his balls before reaching into his pocket and tapping his wand on the band. Both rings tightened instantly, until Harry hissed at the pressure and the increase in sensation. The whole thing was done in about five seconds. Ladon's hands were gone before Harry even had time to feel the pleasure of his touch.
Ron fixed on him. 'You're saying you dodged our annual New Years party tradition to go - voluntarily - to
hadn't changed in the slightest. He was still the same two-faced, sneaking, bastard Slytherin.
'Where are we going?' Draco asked, as they made their way to the roof.
Harry suppressed a shiver at the look on his face.
Malfoy licked his lips and Harry's eyes dropped to them for a second.
Draco pulled Scorpius back from his chest, worried that the boy wasn't moving, hadn't responded to his touch. Scorpius' face was pink and his body was warm, relaxed.
cast a shield around it, after he'd somehow managed to pull time back for a few seconds so he could react quickly enough to do it.
'Of course it matters,' Harry growled. 'You're pretending to be somebody else.'
'Apparate then,' Harry says. 'Now.' He can feel the change shifting under his skin. It's even stronger now, as though the room they'd been in had been suppressing some of the moon's call.
Draco pushed away the pain of Harry's continuing dismissal of him. He'd known how Harry felt about him. He repeated it like a mantra. It couldn't hurt him if he'd been expecting it. He forced himself to concentrate on Harry's words, and frowned slightly as they sank in. What did Harry mean by 'move on'? Was this a one-time thing?
with Draco as well was just too much to pass up.
Malfoy nodded once, still not meeting Harry's eyes, and moved to sit opposite Harry, clearing an extendable containment field off the chair before he did.
He blinked and the walkway was crowded with people, running, pushing, screaming and fighting.
'The Burrow,' he said, and stepped through.
He pushed his fingers back in, two this time, groaning at the feeling and cursing at the awkward angle.
It was a long moment before he let go. It wasn't until Draco made a strangled noise and looked over Harry's shoulder that he turned, breaking the contact between them.
'If you two have finished pissing on each other, might we look at the menu?' Malfoy says, exasperation in his voice, tinged with something heavier. Harry wonders, suddenly, if Malfoy
'Fuck,' he breathed as Harry's strokes slowed and softened and he felt a kiss against his skin. Harry's hands were on his arse still, spreading him. Draco looked back over his shoulder and the look of … worship on Harry's face was almost enough to send him over the edge.
Potter let out a cry of pleasure and his hands tightened in Draco's hair, pulling him closer. Draco's hands slipped down over Potter's jean-clad arse and Potter arched his back, as though inviting Draco to slip his hands inside. Draco had never done anything like this before but it felt so natural to feel Potter's skin under his hands, to cup the swell of his arse.
He spat again and spoke louder, reaching out, as though heedless of the flames.
He can feel the moon in the sky above, its draw stronger now. He has to fight almost constantly against it when it's this close to full, and the fight is draining.
'No, I was turned on,' Malfoy agrees easily. 'It just wasn't him I was thinking about.' Something in his gaze heats in a way that is totally at odds with the conversation they've been having and Harry can't keep eye contact. Instead he finishes his drink and reaches for the bottle to pour himself another.
Harry walks through the door, closing it behind him as he takes in the apartment with a glance. It's not top-of-the-line luxury like he'd expected, but it's plush, decorated in reds and golds. A large, open plan living space with floor-to-ceiling windows is spread before him. The view out over the city lights is stunning, but Harry doesn't let his gaze linger. Off to one side are two closed doors, the other side of the apartment holds a small kitchen, a dining table and a clearly ticked off Draco Malfoy. He's wearing Markwell's face, and Markwell's fuller lips don't quite manage to capture the same cutting disdain Harry remembers.
Harry looked at the intricate webs of magic a moment longer, then he closed his hand and let the spell slip away.
Harry grimaced at the crappy options. The food in the Ministry cafeteria was shit, but if they went to Oliver's, he'd have to Polyjuice first, unless he wanted his face all over fucking
'No,' he continued, more calmly. 'I've never watched anyone doing - that.'
Harry stood from the cot, moving stiffly, still not feeling quite right in his own body. He noted some of the beds were empty now and others contained forms he didn't think he'd seen on the way in.
As Malfoy walks past him, Ron turns to Harry and mutters, 'Blimey, mate. You sure?'
Harry straightens at those words, forcing himself to focus through the hints of blackness at the edges of his vision.
Harry looked down at the few notes he'd written, mind clicking over what more he might need, frustrated by how foggy he still felt. 'That's probably all we need from you for now,' he said, dropping his quill to the desk and looking across at Malfoy. 'You'll stay contactable?'
Deciding he'd go and feeling strangely energised about it, he went upstairs to shower and change. The room he'd shared with Ginny still didn't seem right. It wasn't just that half the closet was empty … the room itself felt empty, as though it was used to having two people share the space.
Hermione nodded. 'The lack of information share between Departments is ridiculous. The Wizengamot comes under the DMLE, but the only reason I have a clue what the Aurors are up to is because I'm friends with you, Harry. It's such a waste of information. Imagine if we were categorising it properly - collecting and filing and cross-referencing -'
'Why did you take the case?' Malfoy snaps back.
.' An enhanced version of the Minister's voice booms out over the packed Ministry atrium. There is a flurry of clicking as cameras flash, the reporters' seats a buzz of action.
The whip of the lash scoured him. He didn't know how many blows it had been now. All he knew was he needed to say the next name. And the next.
'You're wearing the collar,' Hermione noted nonchalantly, the slight darkening to her cheeks giving away her embarrassment about the reasons Harry might do that.
Harry nods. It makes sense.
Aoife paused and scowled again. 'And up you waltz and just bloody kill that woman, letting Conquest loose, happy as you please, no heed for the consequences. No heed for the damage a source can do when it's loose in the world again, looking for a secondary agent to subvert.' Aoife smacked her hand on the table, making her disgust and anger clear. She barely drew a breath before she continued, her words getting faster and faster.
'That's the other part of the surprise,' he says with a grin
Ginny's smile widened and she kicked higher on the swing. 'I'm good,' she said as she swished back and forth. 'I feel like anything might be possible now, you know?'
Harry walked into work the next day feeling more relaxed than he had in a long time. Memories of the night before kept running through his mind. What they had done had been different again. Ladon hadn't touched him, not once, but what they had done … He thought of Ladon's voice as he told Harry to strip. To kneel. To wait. He felt arousal flicker through him again.
Harry feels a surge of arousal at those words and he reaches for Draco, one hand sliding down his back to cup his arse, kneading it softly while the other runs over Draco's cock, still only semi-hard. Harry rubs it lightly, pulling and tugging gently as Draco looks at him, lip bitten between his teeth. Harry wants to swallow him down again. He leans forward instead, licking at Draco's lip before taking it between his own teeth and biting lightly.
Draco
The first time he has to hold himself back is agony, but he understands the rush of it, as Malfoy's movements resume. Harry moans softly at the sensation of touching himself again, and already he feels closer to the edge.
Pimms ran through their schedule for the day, reminded everyone that they wouldn't be using magic, and that any wands seen in use on the trip would be removed. She also stated that they should keep conversation about differences between the magical and Muggle worlds to a minimum until they returned from the trip. Then she turned to Harry with a bright smile.
'There are black lines radiating out from the wound. They're moving, slowly, but I can't tell if they're getting bigger or smaller.'
. He thought about what he'd seen and read so far - what he wanted - what Ladon had promised him. And he shivered. She was right. He did know.
It was quiet in the house and the quiet was making things worse. He needed to be around people, he decided as he dressed hurriedly, pulling on a pair of joggers and a comfortable hoodie that felt warm and familiar.
Harry heard a soft huff from Dahlia but didn't spare her a glance, his whole attention fixed on Draco.
A few hours later, Harry stood at the front steps of the Natural History Museum. It was a huge, imposing building, with stone columns reaching high into the air over a grand entryway. Harry frowned at it and then began walking. That was the Muggle entrance. He knew the one he was looking for would be far less flashy.
s the bottle of Firewhisky to himself. It slaps into his palm and he pours himself another measure.
Draco felt Blaise shrug. 'She didn't need to. I saw the way you looked at him at New Years. You've always had a thing for Potter.'
'I will sit here.' He gestured at the chair. 'You will sit beside me.' He gestured at the low stool placed beside it. 'We will watch, and you will tell me what you're thinking as the scene unfolds.' He paused, clearly waiting for a response and Harry licked his lips.
'Bullshit,' he whispered. 'Does Hermione know how to do that?'
In that instant he knew why he'd come - he recognised the twisted mix of hunger and release he was chasing. He knew what he needed and there was no reason for him not to go after it. Not anymore - Ginny had seen to that. He looked Ladon right in the eyes, body tensing in anticipation as he spoke.
Harry wanted to argue back but it struck him abruptly that she was right. He was only with Luna because he'd wanted information from her. Her father, really. He wouldn't have given her a second thought if the idea of the Hallows hadn't made him think of Xenophilius and the information they'd gotten from him last time they'd been on a mad search no one else believed in.
He didn't reach out. Instead he focused on his job.
Malfoy shrugs. He's still sitting on the ground and he looks perfectly comfortable. 'I've known for weeks.'
Harry grabbed his broom then sprinted back to the lift, opening the door to the roof, kicking off the ground and making for the mass of clouds as quickly as he could. He knew from past experience that getting through it would be hell, but as soon as he was above it he would have a much better idea of what was going on.
'You don't believe me? Fine. Point someone out and I'll tell you who they are and why they're here. I get it wrong and I'll leave you to your brooding.'
Harry sank down in front of the familiar stone.
'Hunter James,' he says.
Draco drew in air with a sucking gasp, every line of his body tense with panic and fear. The flash of green light hovered at the edges of his memory, the realisation that it was his own death he was seeing filled his mind.
'Your presence isn't necessary,' Malfoy says. 'It's different business. There's no expectation I would come accompanied.'
'The case,' he says, 'we have nothing. We didn't save the kid—we don't even know if they moved the kid. And now Davies is gone, we have no leads.'
Malfoy jerked his chin at the bowl of half-eaten carbonara. 'Finish your lunch, and your tea.'
He spent the day in a state of restless agitation. He snapped at one of the Junior Aurors who was trying to go on about something to do with old letters, and then immediately regretted it. But he couldn’t bring himself to go and find her again. He'd do it tomorrow. He wondered what tomorrow would bring.
Then he flinched as a flash of green light sliced through his shield like it wasn't there. It went wide, off to his right, and he realised they were throwing AKs now. If he hadn't been wearing the Invisibility Cloak, he'd probably be dead. The people below seemed to have the same idea. The fireballs stopped abruptly and Harry dropped to the ground, rolling as the light of a dozen killing curses speared through the darkness above him. He shivered at the speed at which the people below had changed tactics. It almost felt as though something was directing them. Linking them together.
'This is bad, Potter,' Malfoy says, and Harry feels the flow of the healing magic over his skin again.
Harry moved across to the table and sat down slowly, cupping his drink and listening absently to the muffled thuds from the floor above.
'No, sir,' Harry said. He wasn't even sure what a taser was.
Harry snorted at the understatement, crossing his arms.
His head was fuzzy when he fell into bed, pulling the threadbare blankets up around him. He let his fingers rest on the tattoo on his chest, let himself imagine it was James, sleeping there, having woken, needing Harry in the middle of the night. It was with that image in his mind that he drifted into sleep.
He felt the tail end of a jerk of Apparition and he cracked into place in front of an unfamiliar house. No, he shook his head, what was he thinking. It wasn't an unfamiliar house. It was his house, the one he and Gin had brought so long ago, 'round the corner from mum and dad's. She'd been happy enough not to be located within walking distance to the Burrow, and they'd both thought Godric's Hollow would be a good place to raise kids.
He drained it in under an hour and passed out in a fitful sleep. When he awoke and stumbled out into the main command room, it was to see everyone gathered around the large screen, watching a televised broadcast. Every face he looked at was grim and Harry turned to watch as well, noticing Rick in the crowd and feeling a stab of dislike, and then disgust at himself. Was he any better? He couldn't even do what he had to when he was properly trained for it.
He had no choice in the cases he was given. Rosa made that clear when she first took him on.
Ron looked concerned, and suddenly Harry wanted to tell him everything. Wanted to unload onto him and let Ron help him get out of this mess. He remembered the laughter in the tent - the overwhelming relief that Ron had come back to them - come back to him.
Malfoy snorted and moved over to the kettle, filling it and putting it on the hob. 'Because I am more than capable of handling Aurors whose noses are too big for them.'
open on his lap and another two beside him, which he was cross referencing. Erklings weren't even native to England. Everyone seemed totally fine with one crawling in the window of his house, but the fact that it shouldn't have was the only thing Harry had at the moment. That and the fucking dreams of hooded men. It was getting so that he couldn't even close his eyes without seeing them, as though they were waiting for him.
But it was just a kiss, wasn't it? Was a kiss cheating? He'd stopped before anything more happened.
He doesn't realise until the words are out of his mouth exactly what he's just admitted to, but Draco's only response is a look of softness as he pulls Harry close again, kissing him deeply. Harry lets himself get lost in the taste of Draco and the touch of their bodies against each other. It's so easy, this dance, like they were made to do it together.
As soon as this case was tried, he would -
Harry glared into Avery's face a moment longer. Then he clenched his fist again and Avery slumped, losing consciousness. Harry let him slide to the ground with a thump, then he cast a Patronus, informing his team of Avery's location. There was another explosion, this one closer, the Manor shaking around them. They must be traps, Draco thought, laid throughout the building. Avery must have set them.
Harry felt his heart thump in his chest as anxiety started to spiral in him. He couldn't lose Draco now, not after everything.
Harry stepped through the Floo and Scorpius beamed at him, sitting back down onto the couch, and turning his attention to the telly again. Harry considered joining him for a moment, and talking with him about his day and about what he'd liked from the trip yesterday. But he still felt unsettled, like there were dark memories swirling just underneath the surface of his mind, waiting to tug him back under. Instead of joining the boy on the couch, he followed Draco back into the kitchen, taking a seat at the table when Draco waved him into it. The kitchen was warm and light and quiet aside from Draco's movements around the space. Harry felt himself unwind slightly.
Lucius' flat gaze turned to Scorpius, sleeping soundly in Draco's arms and Draco clutched him tighter, turning away, trying to shield the boy from his grandfather's covetous gaze.
Draco ignored Potter's self-correction as he tried to separate the person in front of him from Charlie's memory. Drawing attention to the dissonance never worked well. He always found he got better results with letting people sink into the pretence. He reached down to unlace his own boots, kicking the clumsy things off with a feeling of relief. He joined Potter on the couch, twisting to face him and bringing one leg up under the other, sitting the way Charlie had in so many of Potter's memories, as he thought about how he wanted to start the conversation.
Ginny still wasn’t home and he didn’t feel like going to bed, so he walked through the house. He paused in front of Sirius' room, one hand half-raised. It was times like this he wished Sirius were still here - or Lupin, or his parents … someone he could go to for advice … someone who wasn't his wife's parents. He couldn't talk to Molly and Arthur about Ginny - did he want to talk about Ginny? Tonight had been like any other night. Present but not together. With a sigh, Harry wondered when he'd stopped being in love with his wife. Wondered when it had all gone so wrong. They'd been happy. For so many years, they'd been happy, hadn't they?
He looked back at the bear. They'd called it Paddington, Pads for short. It made him think of Sirius, sometimes. He would sit James on his lap and sit Pads in front of them and tell James about the extra grandfather he would have had. Hermione and Ron's crup had eaten Paddington's nose off, giving him a slightly puzzled look. Sometimes Harry imagined it was the same look of surprise Sirius had worn, as he'd stepped backwards, through the veil.
'I'd really like to kiss you right now,' Harry said. 'And then I'd
He can feel the wolf pressing at him, sensing his anxiety and his fear. It's always so much harder to hold it in when he isn't in control of himself. The hunt and Malfoy's closeness—the heady, rich smell of his want in the tunnels has only brought the wolf closer to the surface. Harry takes a deep breath and forces himself to try and relax. It doesn't work. Malfoy is kneeling by the door now, considering it, peering it at its details.
'I'm the Master of Death,' Harry said abruptly, the words leaving him before he'd had time to think about them. But the moment he said it, looking Draco in the eyes, he knew it was right. He'd told Draco he didn't want secrets between them -  he couldn't keep this one.
Harry glares at him, but there's no heat in it. It's strange, being teased gently like this, having what happened to him being made light of. Hermione is always making sure he's okay, and Ron doesn't like to mention it, but Draco seems perfectly comfortable with referencing the fact that he's a werewolf in casual conversation. Harry wants to dislike that, but there's something about it that's freeing, that makes a tension he didn't know he was carrying in himself relax.
'Harry,' Draco said, voice raw, as though he'd been screaming for hours.
'The Ministry has not done one single thing to endear itself to me, Potter,' Malfoy says. 'Azkaban nearly killed me and when I got out, Ministry workers made it their mission to finish the job. I had no guarantees that if I went to the Ministry, the whole thing wouldn't be buried and me with it.'
Hermione's smile took on a puzzled edge at his words, and he had a feeling they'd be having a conversation later. He glanced at Ginny again, but she had her back to him.
Pheo didn't like the reports any better than he did.
'That's a picture of the thing that killed him,' she said, indicating with her chin an image of an Erkling on the wall behind him. It was a pointy, vicious creature, all sharp claws and teeth. Harry had nightmares sometimes, about those feral yellow eyes being the last thing James had ever seen.
much anger. The thought that Draco could be in danger suddenly hit him and he looked back at the sky, dread filling him. Draco hadn't suffered any effects from the other weather changes, had he? Harry didn't know. He regretted again the way he'd rushed in to confrontation, rather than trying to talk to him reasonably.
'What's changed?' she asked carefully.
Harry wrenched his bike to the side of the road and leaned over, vomiting again, the acid of his empty stomach burning his throat as he heaved and retched.
'I ran a diagnostic on your paperwork after I realized you were luring unsuspecting victims to your club.'
, Javier had sent him to a date with the Wizengamot. Harry supposed he should have kept his temper, but he'd been on a knife edge for too long and it was getting harder and harder to pretend he was fine.
Harry shuffled the photos and reports into a loose pile, putting them to one side. He rubbed his eyes again, feeling a headache building behind them. He had so much swirling through his mind - was being pulled in so many directions - that keeping his focus on his work was taking its toll.
After a moment he moves forward, reaching for his soap and flannel. He lathers it and then goes about scrubbing the grime of the day from his body. He makes a cursory swipe across the scar tissue that ridges his left hip. He hates the reminder that it's there, and having to touch it is even worse.
'I know,' Harry said. 'I still think these changes will reduce the admin burden on all of our teams, allowing more time for active duty, training, and civic engagement. I think we need to be proactive, rather than reactive. We could do with supporting some of the current reforms coming from the Law Office and the Reparation Society as well.'
Malfoy's head jerked around and he seemed to consider that for a moment before he nodded his head once. 'If someone got a hair from me in this form, they could impersonate me in it.'
The movement started again. Harry could feel Malfoy's touch inside his mind, now that he knew it was there. He could feel Malfoy's fingers rifling through thoughts, memories, nightmares. He could feel where Malfoy lingered and what he dismissed. Harry wanted to feel revolted, outraged. He wanted to turn Malfoy out, to rip him from his mind, but he was helpless, held by the potion and by the effortless power Malfoy wielded as he sifted and sorted.
Hermione nodded, expression unchanged. 'You turned time?'
Harry shrugs, affecting nonchalance. 'I'm being paid to be here. I may as well make myself useful. Maybe I could lift some heavy things for you?' He makes himself smirk, though he wants to throw Malfoy into a wall. Being around him is infuriating.
Pansy rolled her eyes. 'I've never understood that. You know I haven't. Who needs to be in love before they can get it up for someone? It's like you're a fairy tale princess waiting for his one true love.' She held up her hand to forestall the snarky rejoinder she knew was coming. 'All I'm saying is you're never going to meet someone to get all emotionally involved with if you don't put yourself out there.'
He glances across at Draco with a smile, but instead of seeing his satisfaction reflected, it's Markwell's arrogant face looking back at him. Even in the face of this news, he shows no emotion. Harry looks at him and feels a niggle of worry worm its way into his mind. He wonders for the first time what the end of the case means for Draco—for them. He pushes it away. Surely after what they've just shared, Draco won't be going anywhere. Draco's scent is still all over him and he can smell his own layered over Draco from the other side of the room. He lets those things calm him.
'Hello, Harry,' the man says softly, looking him in the eye. He drops his gaze, tilting his head so his neck is bared as he looks at the ground. His scent doesn't change. There is still no fear, no intent to run.
Harry nodded in relief, the last of the worry about the boy leaving him.
Malfoy's mouth hardened. 'I'm not here to be hospitable. I'm here to sell drinks. You want a drink, you pick one.'
Ladon had showed him the private rooms too. Had seemed to almost take pleasure in the blush that Harry couldn't stop as he described the purpose of the rooms. Harry had assumed he was reasonably knowledgeable about sex. After all, he'd been having it for twelve years. And yet he'd felt like an innocent virgin at hearing some of the things that had come out of Ladon's mouth.
The bouncer drops his arm and Harry smells the sharp, acrid scent of fear. Malfoy steps back out of the entranceway and his eyes narrow when he takes in the scene before him.
The light in the cavern is brighter now and he looks up to see a ball of light floating near the roof. He disregards it. He can hear the thudding impact of the other wolf as he races through the tunnels and he lets out another roar, dropping to all four legs.
There's something in Malfoy's eyes that makes Harry double guess himself. Malfoy couldn't know Harry had wanked in the shower last night, could he? He'd been so quiet. The bond doesn't tell him how Harry reacted to it…
'I guess we'll have to see,' she said at last. 'I don't want to fight - to be bitter.'
, he implored mentally, pushing it towards Potter with the barest touch of
'Ron has such a crush on Veritas,' Harry says in a change of subject he knows is strange, but with the whisky buzzing under his skin, he's unable to bring himself fully out of his musings about the taste of Malfoy's skin.
After a few moments it stopped and Harry opened his eyes to see the room was … off. It was a bright green. Harry's eyes flicked to Draco's and the slight smirk on Draco's face told Harry he realised it was the green Harry used when he gave consent for his forms.
'Am I understood?' Malfoy asked sharply, breaking into Harry's conflicted thoughts.
'This site is sacred, yes,' she said, with a frown at him, 'and it holds great power. It could be that an ancient skull is interred below the foundations of the chapel, and it could be that soil soaked in blood was sprinkled on this site.' Daniela shrugged one shoulder, holding his gaze, an unshakeable certainty in her eyes. 'But it was sacred long before these things occurred. It's a life-giving well. It's a space for rebirth and rejuvenation. The Muggles sense these things. They just can't interpret what they're sensing correctly.'
Harry swallowed heavily and followed Hermione. She cast a charm at the door at the end, opening it, and he stepped through behind her.
'So the papers weren't overstating it, then?' she said archly. 'Good morning, Draco. What a pleasure to see you.'
, Draco realised and he had to bite back a moan.
'He's gone. Someone took him. At seven. Over two hours ago. They thought it was me -' he said, gesturing to Mr. and Mrs. Parkinson. Malfoy's mouth twisted into a hard line as he glared at Harry. 'But I was busy wasting everyone's time to satisfy
'What—' he clears his throat and glances down, seeing Draco's familiar by-line. He's tracked back through Draco's whole career, digging out every story published under the name Veritas and pouring over them. Every time he does he can't quite believe Draco is his now.
'I'm afraid.'
Suddenly he'd had enough. Enough of people, enough of the game. Even his earlier success tasted hollow. What did the million matter? There would always be a need for more. His head was swirling and he felt restless, as if he was stuck in his own skin. He looked around the room, spotting their host, Mrs Nott and moved across to make his farewells, claiming he had business to see to. One must always keep up appearances after all. Blaise raised an eyebrow at him as he passed, but Draco shook his head minutely, indicating his partner should stay. They tried not to emphasise their friendship in public. It served them both better to be seen as mere acquaintances.
He spat and tried to force his mind back under control. Those things were not the same. He needed to separate them. He still had no proof that these deaths had anything to do with James. But that high pitched cry of need wouldn't leave his mind.
Harry rubbed his hand over his tired eyes, nudging his glasses up out of the way, then he looked again at the latest report in front of him, frowning in frustration. The attacker's name was David Bright. He was in his mid-forties and lived alone in a perfectly normal-looking flat. It seemed like he'd acted alone. They'd had Magitech experts look at his phone and computer, and they couldn't find any evidence of an accomplice.
Harry nodded, unable to make himself speak.
The bird ruffled its feathers before turning away from him and launching itself back out the window. Harry closed and locked the shutters behind it. Then he concentrated, feeling for his wards, and closing the loophole that recognised owls and granted them entry.
'You're going to be amazing,' he said, turning to her, a sense of certainty and hopefulness rising in him. 'Whatever you do next - whoever with. You're going to keep being amazing.'
When it had disappeared out the window, he drew the curtains and cast a silencing spell on the room. When it was dark and quiet, he slept again.
'You're doing so good, Draco,' Harry said, voice wrecked. 'You're incredible.'
And it blows my freaking mind. It's stunning.
The wind swirled around them again, sending Malfoy's hair whipping into his face. He seemed to be copping the brunt of it even worse than Harry had been. Harry could see the annoyance written all over him as he pushed his hair back, fingers getting caught in a snarl.
'Let's get another,' he said, clapping Ron on the arm before leading them back to the party. It was speeches next, and it wouldn't do for Harry Potter to be lurking outside in the dark. The
Scorpius nodded and reached for Draco's hand, tugging him to his feet.
'Fine,' he said, and opened his mouth, tilting his head back.
Harry watched as the substance oozed and twitched, moving almost like tar. He realised what it was a second later. This was the thing that had lived inside Draco. This was what it looked like to Seal and destroy a Horseman while leaving the host alive. Draco threw more and more of it up, one arm around his stomach as he sobbed.
Harry shook his head against Ron's chest. 'I can't,' he whispered, voice raw. 'I can't, Ron. I can't. I can't. I can't.'
'We are very well aware of that, Catalyst,' she said, her voice disapproving. Harry wondered for a moment if she was pissed about what he'd done to Rick the day before. It seemed like a lifetime ago.
There was a titter of derisive laughter around the court and Harry glared at Giles, loathing filling him. He forced himself to breathe again, looking back at Draco. He was doing exactly what Harry had hoped, picking through all the truths trying to force their way into his mouth and choosing the ones he wanted to share.
Harry touched it all the time, without even realising it. Draco watched him, in their shared office, and tried to ignore the things he'd done to Harry while he was wearing Ladon's collar.
Harry spoke the next name.
'Perhaps I just like the colour,' he replied. 'If you prefer we change rooms, we can abandon what I have planned for you tonight.'
Draco owled Harry immediately to confirm that he wanted to meet, but chose a day a week later. He needed to watch all of the memories. He needed to understand what Harry wanted, what he liked, how Charlie fucked. He needed to know if they cuddled, if they switched, if Harry actually enjoyed everything they did together or if there were things his face gave away, when Charlie couldn't see.
Harry watched it come to life with mounting dread as the murky depths became clearer.
'Yes, Potter,' Malfoy says with an eye roll. 'I know. I've done this many times, with exactly zero input from you.'
'He wants you in the green room tonight, pet. Third door on the left, past the bar.'
Draco, for lack of another option, followed him down the darkened corridor, which opened up into a bright and warm living room. Granger appeared in the doorway a moment longer, her hair bound in a scarf as though she'd been preparing for bed.
He swallowed, forcing himself to relax, forcing himself to breathe slowly.
'Hermione knows?' Harry asks, feeling something in him relax an inch at the thought of that.
Draco leaned down to place a kiss on his upturned forehead and then he reached into his shirt, pulling out his wand and pointing it at the night sky as he whispered the charm.
'Harry,' Hermione said, ignoring his words. 'Please. It could be important.'
Ginny just stared at him. 'Are you listening to yourself? Someone? Like who?
'Don't try and come after me,' he said to Ron and Hermione, and then as Ron pulled his wand out, Harry Apparated away.
His breakfast was a coffee and a fag and he lit another as he headed down to the street and his bike. He didn't bother asking for directions. Sedlec Ossuary wouldn't be hard to find. It was a major tourist attraction, after all. Besides, the few people out on the street this early looked harried, passing quickly, looking around constantly. He didn't think any of them would take kindly to being approached by a stranger.
'Can't sleep,' Harry muttered, barely aware of the words coming out of his mouth. His voice was raw and croaky. He'd woken up screaming again.
Harry thought of why he was here - what he wanted to prove - what he needed evidence to be able to prove. He couldn't stop now.
For a moment, Harry second guesses himself. The man in front of him looks nothing like Malfoy, but now that the connection has been made, it's all he can think of. He knows that scent. Some part of his brain remembers it faintly. Remembers it enough, now, that he has no doubt. Malfoy is sitting in front of him, glamoured as someone else.
Draco stilled his movement, looking down at Harry, his own face tight with pleasure, pupils blown wide. He leaned forward, putting his hands on Harry's collarbones, and then sank slowly back down onto his cock.
Harry Potter hadn't once attended a Ball at the Manor, despite the Society extending him an invitation every year … not that Draco had particularly wanted him there.
Silence stretches between them for a long moment. 'You'll just have to trust me,' Harry says at last. Malfoy's face shutters, as though that will never be a step he can imagine taking, and Harry wonders, not for the first time, just what Malfoy's life has been like over the past decade that he is so completely incapable of leaning on another person.
Harry inclined his head respectfully at the bulk of the creature. The Librarian swung himself up onto the desk nearest the door Harry had just entered through and glared at him balefully.
Harry was brought to the stand a number of times to verify evidence and account for procedure. He kept his tone calm and professional, laying the events out clearly and concisely, his notes almost burned into his brain.
'What's going on?' Draco whispered again, his voice more urgent now. He needed to know what this was. A dull arousal twisted in him, begging to come to life.
'Sometimes, the Giant Squid would come and play with the lights,' he continued, gasping as he gave his leaking cock a hard pull. He heard Harry's sharp intake of breath followed by a soft groan.
He mutters a quick thanks and picks up his knife and fork, shovelling the food into his mouth, barely blowing on it before taking his next mouthful. Inside him, he can feel the wolf's contentment that Draco is taking care of them—is providing for them. Harry wants to tell it to shut up, but the same feeling of contentment is flowing through him. He watches surreptitiously as Draco sits opposite him, the bitter smell of his coffee wafting over as he starts on a scaled-down version of the same meal.
Nothing happened.
The hand wielding the whip paused as he spoke. Harry didn't notice when it came down with less force than the others. He remembered holding Dobby in his arms as his life bled out into the sand. Dobby had only been there to save him.
'Sit down,' Malfoy says, pushing out the chair opposite him with his foot.
'Thank you for seeing me, sir. I hope I can be of some help. I don't know if it was important, what I saw. It's hard for me to remember, these days, you see. But Mr Potter here said it could be, so of course I was happy to come in.'
It was late when Harry got back to his room. The streets were almost empty as he rode back through the city. No one wanted to be out after dark, nowadays. He parked his bike and disillusioned it before he headed upstairs, his mind still full of everything he'd seen at the Ossuary. He'd barely paid attention on his ride home, instead he'd played Daniela's words through his mind over and over again, trying to make sense of them.
, he reminded himself.
I don't even consider taking off my Cons or hanging my trench-coat up. For one, it's bloody cold in here, like he hasn't got the heater on. For another, I prefer to see what sort of interaction this is going to be, before I make myself at home.
A strange look flitted across Barclay's face for a moment before she smiled. 'See you.'
. Harry fixed on the name. This was
Harry wavered, wanting to talk to her but not sure what to say. He finally decided on the truth - or as close to it as he could get. Keeping things from Ron and Hermione had never felt good.
'I haven't been able to stop picturing it all night,' Harry said in his ear, and his voice was suddenly huskier. Draco shivered slightly as Harry's lips brushed his skin.
The silver roars, the sound deafening and Wolf feels teeth slice into his shoulder. He drops to the ground, pulling the silver down with him. Wolf brings his hind legs up and shoves with all his force, sending the silver flying over his head.
'I … withheld something from Harry. Something important,' he said, and watched both their faces for a response. Neither made a move. 'I had been going to tell him. I knew I should have told him a lot earlier. But that's irrelevant. He found out.'
'Victorum, Bellum, Jajunium, and Mortem.' The words sounded heavy on her tongue, laced with pain and fear, heavy with power.
The thought of Hermione gave him that same sense of sick guilt it always did, so he put it aside as well and focused on what he was reading.
The blond boy widened his eyes and looked at his dad. 'You told me you were the best flyer at Hogwarts,' he said, tone accusatory.
Malfoy's eyes are wide and dark, Markwell's face twisting in a way that makes it hard to tell what Malfoy is thinking. Harry can't read this face nearly as well. He pulls out his own wand and lays it against Malfoy's temple.
Harry landed on the front step of Grimmauld Place and stood, panting, heat still rocking through him, mixed with guilt and confusion. He looked at his front door and panicked. Was Ginny home? He couldn't remember where she was. He'd kissed someone else. Fuck. He couldn't see Ginny right now. Harry closed his eyes and fixed on the first destination that came to mind, then he whirled into the night with a crack.
'Whatever it is, mate,' Ron said. 'You can tell us.'
Malfoy nodded, looking over at the dome with nervousness in his face.
'Let's go, we're going to be late.'
Harry considered chucking the note in the bin, nettled by Draco's tone, but then he thought about going home to his empty house and to working on the case until he fell into bed exhausted, and he decided a row with Malfoy might be preferable to that.
Then he made the link to the headline he'd just read, on the street outside.
'And what happens during that time?'
Malfoy paused at the bar. 'Do you want Dreamless to put you under?' he asked, gesturing at the shelves. 'Or something else?'
'Why are you bringing me, then?' Harry asked, not wanting to dissuade her, but a bit bewildered by everything that had just happened.
. That's the only word Harry focuses on. Even the idea of being caught by Ron fades into the background before the thought that he and Draco are an 'us'—are together now. Harry feels happiness grow in his chest until he thinks he might choke with it.
regular way of contacting him when he'd started curse-breaking all those years ago. The door shut with a click and Harry felt his tattoo warm again.
'Are you okay?' came his mum's voice from down below, and Harry winced at the concern in her voice. It wasn't like he fell out of bed all the time. Only sometimes. Well maybe a few times a week. But it was only that one time he'd fallen down the stairs. He rushed down them now, in his burgundy pj's. Dad had bought them for him a few years ago. Mum had rolled her eyes and said they should just wait and see, and not to put pressure on him, but Dad had hugged him close and said he knew a Gryffindor when he saw one.
'Do you think Malfoy did it?' he asked, 'Killed those people?' He didn't ask the real question -
'I'm ready,' he said, in a voice that only shook a little.
'How do you even tell them apart anyway?' he burst out. 'If the whole point of the Ball is for people to cut deals and impress each other - how does having everyone in masks help with that?'
Harry nodded, understanding completely. 'We'll have protection organised for you as well -'
'Are they supposed to be mouldy?' he asked, not looking away from the bones.
It takes them the best part of three days to set it up.
Harry makes a face at the Apparition, but steps close and wraps his arms around Draco, nuzzling into his neck.
He pulled his wand out to extinguish the end but Malfoy waved his first with a faint roll of his eyes and something that sounded like, 'Gryffindors' muttered under his breath. The burning end disappeared and Harry looked down at his fingers in surprise, then back up at Malfoy. He let out a giggle. It escaped his lips without meaning to.
'Thank you,' Malfoy says. 'For today.' And Harry hears more than that. He hears the loneliness of doing all of this by yourself, year after year. He hears the confusion of not knowing who you are anymore, and the loss of having no one who can connect you to who you were. Harry hears in Malfoy's voice something that sets that heat in his chest alight again.
Draco's face softened and his concentration relaxed. As it did so, the scars returned.
Harry's about to slam him against the wall again when the word breaks through the fury inside him.
Harry looked up at Draco, a smile on his face. 'Is it okay if they play together?'
He resizes the shirt with a flick of his wand and pulls it over his head, running one hand over his ribs, letting himself imagine, just for an instant, that it's Draco's hand.
Harry was so, so sick of the killing.
Malfoy sits on the edge of the bed for a long moment, but then he reaches out, running his smooth, cool hand down Harry's back. Harry sighs at the touch and then shuffles over, moving slowly and painfully until he's closer to the wall.
---------
Harry seemed to hunch in on himself further, the frantic whispers increasing until Draco could almost make them out. What he could hear turned him sick with fear. What the fuck had he done?
. He felt his interest prick at the words and he nodded. He'd been thinking … a bit … about the sorts of things he might like to do … or have done to him. Yes … he could do this.
Robards reaches out to shake his hand as well, with a gruff word of thanks. He smells slightly uncomfortable, but it's to his credit that he doesn't show it externally. Harry wonders what it's taken for Robards to get to a place where he can shake the hand of the same type of creature who killed his wife. He wonders if Robards has come to the same realisation about how damaging it is to blame a whole race for the actions of individuals.
Harry felt a curl of satisfaction and possessiveness at those words - at the thought that Draco hadn't been with other people. Harry knew it wasn't the same, that he was the only one Draco had had sex with, but even the thought of it - of Draco fulfilling other people's needs instead of his, or Draco singing for other people as he held them close - made something simmer angrily in Harry's chest. He felt his magic stir in him, rumbling to life, and he breathed deeply, pushing it back down.
'Harry,' Draco said, his tone dead serious. 'If you don't touch my cock in the next two minutes, I will not be responsible for what the weather does to you.'
'Just from knowing how good you're - fuck - making me feel?' Draco panted.
He'd arranged for them to meet Draco and Scorpius at the aquarium entrance at ten and he wasn't surprised to see two blond heads waiting for them when they arrived.
Harry forces himself to focus on his job. If he's scowling at the door when the bloke walks in, he isn't exactly going to make the right impression, is he? Hermione's voice echoes in his mind,
The silence stretches and then Kingsley nods, followed by Robards, with a frustrated huff.
People reached out to him as he passed through the crowd, offering comforting touches, or comforting words. Harry couldn't see or hear them. His feet followed a familiar path, one he'd travelled a hundred times before to be with the rest of his family. His parents. The placeholder for Sirius, who would never return to him.
'Fine,' he says, lifting his hands to the buttons of his Auror robes. He strips out of them quickly and pulls on a tight grey top and a pair of jeans. It's cold out but his blood is running hot and he's been sweltering in his robes all day. He loves being back in the Ministry and in his team, but having to hide what he is every day is wearing. Sometimes he just wishes he could be himself. But he knows that's not how the world works.
'Thank you, Elias. I've spoken to a number of those fleeing the turmoil which is overtaking the city and what they have to say is disturbing. They're reporting the attackers are using flamethrowers and laser guns, and say there has been indiscriminate killing. Police retaliation has been ineffective and the violence seems to be widespread.'
He watched the flame bob and dance for a second, and then he fed the letter into it, face impassive as he watched it curl in on itself.
'Not here,' Draco said, staring intensely into Harry's eyes. 'Will you come to my house?'
Harry has to fight the snarl that wants to rise in his chest at the sight of it. Malfoy is
When he was fully seated, Harry rested for a moment, leaning his forehead against Draco's as he breathed deeply. He looked into Draco's eyes and Draco realised he had never seen Harry this closely before. Harry's eyes were bright with want, but there was also a sadness inside them that seemed embedded in every part of his being, like it had been there when he was born and would be there until the day he died.
'Most times,' Draco admitted. 'I couldn't keep Ladon's form when you were responding so beautifully. I couldn't keep my focus enough.' He coughed, embarrassed. 'I think a part of me didn't want it to be a lie, either. It's why I had to keep blindfolding you.'
The lead-up to the trial passed quickly. Harry went back into the office on Monday, officially ending his leave. Javier had sent a terse reply to Harry's owl, and so the first thing he did, after he'd seen Mrs. Norris and thanked her for supporting Sue in his absence, was to head up to the DMLE office, let Javier's secretary know he only needed a minute, and knock on his door.
A few minutes later Harry hears the shower turn on and he realises there must be a bathroom between their two rooms. A second later he realises that means they'll be sharing it. The fact that he'll be sharing this apartment constantly with Malfoy for the next five weeks hits him all at once. He's going to be sitting opposite him at breakfast, seeing how he spends every day, privy to all his phone calls and movements. He starts to think about what he needs to watch for. He wonders if Malfoy has files or documents with him; if he can have a hunt through his room at some stage.
'As I said, we have three options; Advocacy, pressure, or financial support.'
Harry flushed as he was jolted out of his fantasy.
'He ended up dead. Dead from a fucking Auror AK because he couldn't afford his suppressant potion anymore and he turned one moon, when I wasn't home to help him cope with it.' Malfoy's voice is almost vibrating with anger and Harry can hear the pain layered through it. The scent of it hangs heavy in the air. It mixes with Harry's own anguish until he's almost suffocating with it.
'No, sir,' Harry said easily, 'I make sure to keep in shape, and I'm out in the field with my team on occasion.'
Harry ignored the request for the moment, crawling back up Draco's body to kiss him quickly. Draco looked dazed, lips red and eyes heavy lidded.
'Would that be so bad?' he asks—the first thing that comes to mind.
You're all the very best <3
Harry catches glimpses of the faded Mark on his arm, but it doesn't bother him like he thought it would. He plays absently with the bracelet on his wrist as he watches Malfoy, finding his mind drifting back over the last few days, thinking about how much his view of Malfoy has shifted.
Harry made his way back to the same place now, a huge lake, a castle in the background, hanging over it, reflected in the water. It wasn't Hogwarts, but there was something about the space that called to him. He could sense the comfort of the park around him, trying to draw him in, to soothe him. It didn't work. He could feel the shadow of James in his arms, in his heart. There was only one thing that was going to let him ease the pain that was screwed razor tight inside himself, and that was the reason he was here.
Malfoy rolled his eyes in turn. 'You really are something else, Potter. Say I let you stay. What then? What sweet dreams does your little heart desire?' Something flickered in Malfoy's eyes and a slow smile came over his face. It made him look, just for a moment, like the boy Harry had flown with, so long ago. 'No, never mind, I have just the thing.'
Could he be any more of an idiot?
'I've hurt you plenty of other times,' Harry says, clenching his fists and feeling his nails dig into his palms. They feel sharper and the pinpricks of pain send his emotions spiralling higher.
'You're a Catalyst,' Conor said, voice deep and certain.
'I took a few days off and we spent Christmas with Andromeda and Teddy, then we went across to Paris. It was nice,' Malfoy's smile turned down slightly. 'I don't get to spend as much time with him as I'd like.'
Harry stopped, turning back to her.
'I want to suck you,' Harry said, voice low, as he squeezed Draco's arse, pushing up into him again.
Harry felt the memory unfold in his mind and he smiled. Of course he had been. Last summer, when he was staying with Draco after sixth year.
Harry stepped forward again and then again, the wards rippling and cracking around him as they resisted him, fighting against his presence. He felt pain shiver over his skin, but ignored it. His shields blocked the brunt of it, and he'd felt far worse.
Malfoy and all of the emotions and memories his appearance have stirred up in Harry's mind mix with the feeling of uneasiness he gets every time he visits the PROtego building. He hates spending time there. It smells wrong. Like sadness, hopelessness, jealousy, anger, pain. People need their services for all sorts of reasons, but they're rarely happy ones.
. No one had ever let him
But Draco tilts his hips again and squeezes just so and Harry swears at the perfect pressure of it, thrusting hard into him, the movement involuntary. The look on Draco's face is self-satisfied and Harry nips at his lip.
'Draco,' Harry said, something inside him clenching in pain. 'Please. Don't do this.'
Finally, he thought of how it felt to have all of that taken away - the case, the confusion of his feelings, the fear of what this new possibility might mean - to face the idea, again that the Hallows might continue to direct his life.
He wrote to Molly, apologising for his absence and letting her know a little of what was going on. He promised to come for tea that weekend.
Harry moved over beside him, looking down at the piles of paperwork on his desk. Draco glanced up at him from his chair and then gestured at the papers.
Harry looked around the circle, seeing some people look faintly alarmed and some lean forward with anticipation. Malfoy just cracked the bottle of Firewhisky he'd carried in and took a drink, straight from the bottle, before tilting his head back to blow the smoke into the air in a steady stream. Harry swallowed dryly as his eyes caught and held on Malfoy's smooth, pale throat. Malfoy handed the bottle to Nott, wiping his hand over the back of his mouth with a knowing smirk at Harry as he did. Harry looked away, embarrassed to be caught watching and surprised at the behaviour from the normally uptight Slytherin.
The headline blared up at him.
'Don't,' he said, 'Please.'
He came to an abrupt stop at the foot of the stairs, and this time he couldn't hold his vomit. He leaned to the side and squeezed his eyes shut as he retched his guts up.
. Don't you dare make excuses for them.'
Draco shrugged, eyes flicking to him before he looked away again.
'Right,' Harry said. 'We'll work on that assumption. Now for the who and where.' He fixed Malfoy with his gaze. 'What's your gut telling you?'
He was beautiful like this.
'Wait,' Harry interrupted, the surprise more obvious on his face now. 'You actually … believe this is an issue – a danger?'
Of course the Pureblood Society was encouraging Muggle-themed costumes. He didn't know why it annoyed him so much. It made sense to encourage learning and the celebration of Muggle culture and history. He finished his drink and turned away from the mirror. Ginny would be a while yet. He'd have another drink while he waited. Something told him that would be the only thing that would get him through the night.
. He felt nausea swirl and rise in him and he fell to his knees, vomiting into the gutter.
behind this, but I don't see how,' Harry said.
Harry considered pushing him. He had to try and get Malfoy to talk - to open up to him, somehow, if he had any hope of figuring out the full picture of what went on at Dreaming Darkly. Then an idea occurred to him.
Ladon's mouth left him immediately. The grip on him changed direction, pulling him back from the couch until his hips were jerking against air. Harry let out a shaky cry, breath shuddering in his lungs as he fought to get himself under control. At last, at long last, the need subsided. He moaned at the loss of his orgasm as he rested his head on his arms and breathed deeply for a moment.
'That will get you the day, Potter,' he said, that same, knowing smile from the other night on his face.
He knew the next name. Knew it better than he knew his own.
Malfoy guides them quickly and easily out of the city and Harry keeps watch in the mirrors of the car, checking for any signs of pursuit. He thinks they've been quick enough—and the would-be assassins would've had to have a trace expert with them to be able to make a follow-up jump—but Malfoy doesn't seem to want to take any chances. He cuts off Harry's attempts to make conversation and drives, his face impassive.
Her eyes linger on the exposed skin from the v of his shirt and Harry feels like clicking his fingers in her face. He clears his throat and her eyes jerk up to his.
Lucius was sitting straight-backed and proud, as though he were hearing the weather report, but under the table, Harry could see his fingers gripping hard into his leg.
, she hissed drowsily, head drooping.
Harry tried to think of how to describe it. Everything had happened so quickly.
Harry thought back to his perfect day. The birthday he'd spent his whole life wishing he could have. 'Yes,' he said softly, unable to muster up even a hint of his earlier anger. 'You are.'
. I have connections to every one of your families, one way or another. If I even hear a
Instead he forces himself to look down at the phone. The image shows the network of tunnels under the surface. There are a number of entrances across the grounds, though only the one they're looking at now seems to be used by the public.
Still, it explained why the stupidity was continuing. Harry had cancelled or diverted all his upcoming cases. The people who worked in the Ministry might be daft enough to keep coming in, but that didn't mean he had to subject creatures to the extreme temperatures. Besides, with no active cases on, and provided he turned one or two reports into Jefferson each day, Harry's time was freed up to allow him to get to the bottom of just what was going on.
'Shit,' Malfoy says, under his breath.
. Potter had no idea Draco was even there. He wanted Charlie Weasley. Draco felt a sick disappointment curl in his gut. He chased it away immediately. What did he expect? Potter had never wanted him.
'What are you talking about?' Harry said, frustration running through him. None of this made sense.
Malfoy gives him an exasperated look, Markwell's features putting an ugliness into the sneer. 'I don't know what part of "you don't need any details, just look intimidating" doesn't make sense to you, Hunter, but maybe try and focus on one word at a time until it becomes clear.'
He capped the bottle and slid it back away then sat on his bike a moment longer, pushing James back down into his heart where he belonged. Harry had to use his head for this. He couldn't afford to be distracted. Distraction could kill him.
With a flick of his wand he had his papers lining the walls of the small room and he looked around, trying to see where the connections were, where all of this fit into everything else.
Draco Apparate away.
Harry rolled his eyes at Ron's show of misery and looked down at what he'd been given. On top of the papers was a note from Baggins.
He came back to himself much later - after he'd had breakfast with his family and talked to them about anything and everything to do with starting school in a few months. Lunch with his uncles - where Sirius had teased him mercilessly that he would be sorted into Slytherin house and Remus had assured him that no matter where he was sorted he would do well. And then flying all afternoon - on the new Nimbus 2000 he'd gotten for his birthday.
Harry concentrates for a moment, knowing what Draco is asking and totally on board with it. He can only hear one set of breaths downstairs and he shakes his head. Draco is moving before he's finished. He lets go of Harry, bends and reaches down for his waistcoat and fishes his wand out of it. He flicks Locking and Silencing Charms at Harry's door before directing his wand at himself. His posture relaxes slightly at his nonverbal spell.
Ron nodded and Dean leaned forward, pressing their lips together. Ron had closed his eyes and he pulled away once the required five seconds were done, but he smiled at Dean as he did so. 'Not bad, Thomas.'
Draco grunted in surprise as Harry moved to straddle him on the couch, the way he had one week before. Harry pressed down with his hips as his hands slipped under the hem of Draco's shirt and urged it up.
He wishes he could
'Malfoy,' Harry muttered grimly. 'What the fuck are you doing at an American arms deal?'
There's a buzz and the doors open to another reception area, this one more lavishly appointed.
'We could call that duck Harry,' Draco said. 'Maybe he'll follow us home?'
'Potter,' Malfoy says, as Harry's face re-emerges. 'It's not what you think.' His voice is raspy and his face is turning red. Harry can feel Malfoy's heartbeat pounding against his palm and his tightens his grip.
He pressed a kiss to Draco's forehead and murmured, 'You were incredible.'
Harry nods within the embrace of Bill's arms and then shrugs. He has no idea how he is. 'It was… a lot.'
Harry is tempted to throw the offer back in his face, but he forces the impulse down and nods instead, a hard jerk of his head. He may have been forced out of the Ministry, but a lifetime of suspicion dies too hard. The tracker is one thing. He'll get more out of Malfoy if he's close to him.
Malfoy just nodded, moving towards the door and pushing it open. He stood for a moment in the doorway, looking inside. Harry could only see the side of his face, and something twisted across it, almost faster than he could catch. It looked like fear, followed by longing. Then the cold, emotionless mask Harry had seen the night before came down again.
Conor glanced beside her, face taking on a slightly perplexed look, and Harry realised he was still wearing his cloak. He felt a small prick of unease at the thought of how natural it felt to do so. The feeling was drowned, a moment later, by the greater discomfort at the thought of removing it before this room full of strangers. He would have no defences from them. Harry shook his head, reminding himself Luna was a friend. She wouldn't bring him into harm. Not knowingly. And besides, he had his wand. He touched it for reassurance. He wasn't defenceless.
It opened into a huge room that was filled with people moving back and forth, weaving in and out of each other's space with a purposeful speed that made Harry think of bees in a hive. There was far more tech than magic in the space. Harry could see a huge map of the city on the far wall, with digital images pinned to it and moving around, flashing up photographs and video of whoever the targets were.
Harry shrugged, dropping his eyes and picking at the puffy pants. 'Didn't fit right,' he muttered.
he is—so that he doesn't upset or offend other people. Even a few weeks ago, he would have jumped at that as the perfect solution. Now it makes him uncomfortable, and his wolf whines at the idea that Harry should feel ashamed of him.
, Harry thought.
There were signs of the festering new ideology as well, in the boarded up or burnt out buildings he rode past. Not everywhere, but enough to know that the damage was rising. The night-time incursions were increasing. The fear was growing and with it, Harry could sense the city beginning to fracture.
Hermione nodded. 'Yes, but that's not surprising. Level nine is cut off from most of the main Ministry support systems. Too many things that are too delicate for the likes of this to be happening,' she said, waving her hand at the rain with a sniff.
'Ron still at work?'
, Pheo said, still appraising Malfoy curiously. Harry looked down at her, confused. Sometimes her thought patterns just didn't translate into something he could understand.
, past the ever-present Dahlia, whose objections followed him into the public space. He looked around the dimly lit room with clenched teeth, feeling his anger crackling around him. A small part of him whispered that what had happened had nothing to do with Ladon, but he pushed it down. The lights flickered  and he heard murmurs as people on the couches looked around. The Club was a lot quieter than it had been on the weekend and Harry's attention was drawn briefly by the stage. There was a woman standing with her arms and legs tied to a wooden X-frame. He watched for a second as she writhed, while another woman dripped hot wax over her naked chest. The woman on the frame was blindfolded and her torso was streaked with drying wax.
Harry rests on his elbows and looks at Draco, their noses nearly touching. Draco's eyes are beautiful up close, grey flecked with blue, like ice chips.
Harry glances at Draco again, something connecting in his mind. He has his job back. He has his power back. He's never been in a better place to help people. For a short time, while the child trafficking case sits on top of his fame as Harry Potter, he'll be untouchable.
'Indeed,' Lucius murmured.
He woke three hours later, jerking upright in his bed, scream ringing from his throat and heart pounding in his chest. He sat forward, resting his arms on his knees and sucked in air, trying to push the dream from his mind.
? Is that a joke?'
Draco swallowed heavily as he felt arousal rush through him at the thought. Not one tentacle, but many moving over him, holding him in place, pushing their way inside him. He closed his eyes for a second and took a deep, shuddering breath. Then he nodded, a sharp assent, eyes still closed. He couldn't look at Harry while he admitted to something like that.
party?' Ron's face was a mixture of indignation and genuine bafflement.
'Weasley,' Draco said with a terse nod. 'Granger.'
'Do you mind if I have a moment?' Harry asked. Javier's face became even more suspicious and Harry couldn't blame him. He could count the amount of times he'd entered this office voluntarily, let alone politely, on one hand. One of the things he'd recognised, in his reflections, was that, yes, Javier drove him up the wall, but that Harry himself probably hadn't been the easiest person to work with either.
'His drawing room is this way,' Draco muttered, wand held in a white-knuckled grip.
'Are you okay?' Harry murmured. 'Are you hurt? Do you need anything?'
You guys blew me away on the last chapter. I couldn't believe how many gorgeous comments I got. Thank you so, so much.
Harry closed the folders in front of him and checked the time. They'd left Lucius Malfoy for a few days. They knew exactly where he was, after all, and from everything Harry had seen regarding the restrictions on his house, magic and movement, the idea that he could be involved was incredibly slim. Still, Draco had put him on the list, and there must be some reason behind that, even if it was just to distance himself from his past and the prejudices of his father.
He felt confused and disoriented, as though he couldn't trust his own judgement as he continued to come down from what he had experienced under Ladon's hands.
normal, of him getting to have this, always, bubbles up into his mind and he can feel the wolf leap on it, pushing it harder at him.
Malfoy flipped the cover open and then let out a snort. 'Apparently you came off second best with a Niffler. Really, Potter? A
When he came back to himself, the ropes were gone and Draco was singing.
'Fuck,' Harry rasped behind him, and Draco could only agree. The tentacle continued to push into him and he felt it writhing and moving. He put a hand to his stomach, groaning at being able to feel its penetration from the inside and the outside of his body simultaneously.
'Oi! I only did half of it, you know.'
Then his shirt was over his head and Harry was bending over to take one of Draco's nipples in his mouth, rasping across it with his teeth before sucking it. Draco flinched, wanting to tell Harry to be careful, that the scar that cut away most of his nipple made the flesh painful, but then he looked down at Harry's messy black hair bent over a chest of ginger curls and he felt a jolt of shock as he remembered this wasn't his body. This was Charlie's.
'You can still fly, yeah?' he asked, letting a hint of challenge into his voice.
Malfoy parks them by the water, half a mile from the castle and he leads them to the wall that surrounds the Dover castle grounds. It's approaching dusk and there aren't too many people around as they stroll casually towards the expansive estate, as though they're just out sightseeing.
'I need to lie down,' Harry says as he pushes to his feet. Tiredness is running through him again. Now that he's cleaned and fed, his body is pushing him back towards sleep.
'Fuck, bite me,' Potter gasped, grinding down against Draco's lap. Draco was almost surprised to realise he was hard, his cock twitching at the words from Potter's mouth. He did as he was asked, biting into the muscle under his mouth.
After a second his eyes cleared and Draco was looking at him. The otherworldly air faded and Harry could feel inside himself that this was Draco. His eyes were exhausted and full of suffering and his voice, when he spoke, was raw and desperate, that uncanny edge absent from it.
'Magic is real. Those who attack us have magic. They have powers beyond anything we have seen before and they seek to use those powers to dominate us. To enslave us. To rule over us.
Harry hears the shower shut off and he shakes his head. He's being stupid. They're being hunted. He almost died the day before. He should be thinking about the case, not his cock and whether Malfoy is directing it.
Draco reached up, running his fingers across Harry's chest, grazing against one nipple and leaving it hard and tingling. Then he traced over Harry's arm and down to his fingers, twining their hands together for just a moment before he pulled them free. Draco rubbed his fingertips over Harry's stomach and down to the curls nesting at the base of his cock. He pulled lightly at them and Harry's hips jerked forward a fraction. He felt himself react, precome leaking from him, but he couldn't bring himself to feel embarrassed. He'd never been so turned on in his life.
'Did what -' Draco began, but Harry was already pushing at his hips, turning him to the side and then backwards, until he was looking down at the foot of the bed, legs spread either side of Harry's chest.
Harry thinks about arguing the fact that his look isn't a 'bad boy' look. His jeans and boots are serviceable and he finds Sirius' old leather jacket comforting. He stands up and sets his glamour but before he can open his mouth to disagree, Malfoy grabs his arm and Apparates them.
He focuses on scent marking. He brushes against the body in front of him again and again, rubbing himself on every part he can reach.
before.
'Beware, Dominus,' Daniela called after him as he made his way up the stairs, grasping at the stone walls to force himself up them faster. 'The Horsemen are riding.'
Harry spun next and got Seamus. He glanced over and Seamus grinned at him, waggling his eyebrows. Harry laughed and moved to his knees, meeting Seamus in the middle. The kiss was awkward to start with - their mouths not quite aligned, the slight rasp of Seamus' stubble feeling different to anything he'd felt before … but also, in some strange way, familiar. Then Seamus' tongue darted against Harry's lips and Harry opened his mouth slightly, all thoughts disappearing from his mind. All he could focus on was heat and pleasure, as Seamus' tongue slid against his. Harry let out a low moan, then was immediately embarrassed at making that sound in front of everyone else. The embarrassment disappeared a moment later as Seamus echoed him, pulling him closer.
He was a few steps away when Draco's gaze flipped to him, eyes widening slightly. Harry saw a hint of relief in them and he stepped closer to the railing, leaning in to speak to Draco.
Harry leaned in for another kiss and another, getting lost in the feeling of Draco's body under his. His erection had flagged while they talked, but Draco was making these lovely little sounds and Harry could feel him beginning to get aroused as well. He broke reluctantly away from Draco's mouth to kiss his jaw and then down his neck. Harry breathed him in, rubbing his face against the soft skin. Draco's hands came up to his hips and he thrust lightly against Harry, the feeling of his hardness sliding against Harry's distracting him for a moment. He ground down and Draco gasped, throwing his head to the side.
Draco took Scorpius home for a change of clothes after their day out and they arrived at Pansy's parents' Estate late in the afternoon. He knew Pansy wouldn't be watching Scorpius for the night - not on a Saturday. But he knew she'd be there, getting ready to go out, and he needed to talk to her.
The tip of Ron's nose was red and his hair was plastered to his head in soggy clumps. He looked miserable as he sniffed wetly.
Malfoy looks satisfied by whatever he's just observed.
'Fuck you, Malfoy,' Harry snarled, finding his voice at last. It echoed strangely in the emptiness. 'Let me go. Let me out of this.' He spun again and again in the darkness, searching for some sign of Malfoy - some way out.
Harry jerked his head up, taking in every detail of Draco's form. He was still wearing the black trousers and navy shirt he'd had on the night before, though it looked like he'd cast cleaning charms on himself. The grime from their fight through the Manor was gone, but Draco looked exhausted when he met Harry's eyes, shifting a still-drowsy Scorpius into a more comfortable position. Harry felt something in him relax, to see that Draco was okay - that they both were.
Harry noted Shacklebolt was present and gave the Minister of Magic a nod, which he was relieved to see the man return, albeit minutely. Perhaps the Minister could help make sure the typical red tape bullshit didn't smother him today. Harry was less pleased to see Javier, taking his assigned position as DMLE Head, sitting beside Kingsley. Javier rarely attended warrant hearings, but of course he'd made a special exemption for this one. Harry supposed it was too much to ask that his boss may have caught dragon pox on his way into work.
'Having fun?' Draco asked as the silence stretched on. It wasn't a bad silence. It was warm and relaxed and familiar, but Draco should be trying to get Potter to talk. He hadn't got anything he could use yet, after all.
'Bullshit,' Harry hisses, and he leans in closer to Malfoy, so that their faces are just inches apart. He can feel the heat of Malfoy's body against his and the scent of him is strong and heady. The lingering pull of Malfoy's arousal just sends Harry's disgust and fury spiralling higher. He'd started to think Malfoy had changed.
'In the REAL world,' he went on, pushing a finger hard into Harry's chest as his voice rose and his words came faster, 'I make my living twisting people's dreams for money. I trap them in a life that will never exist, and sometimes they die. They die because they won't leave the dream.' He took a deep, shuddering breath. 'I have to live like that - I had to see my mother
'Yes, well. You don't count,' Malfoy said, sniffing slightly.
'In here,' came the voice from the kitchen. Harry smiled and kicked off his boots, lining them up neatly and hanging his Auror robes over the peg by the door, giving them a quick flick to straighten them.
For a moment, Harry could almost see him there, blond head bent over the blocks, concentration on his face. He wondered if the boy looked like Draco had, as a child. The though gave him a pang of grief. James had had Harry's hair, dark and unruly. He wondered, as he had so many times before, whether his son would have grown up to look like him. That thought had no place here, and Harry shook it off.
He replays the Veritaserum conversation, runs a finger over the chain clasped around his wrist and thinks through the interactions he'd witnessed at the strip club.
This chapter is a change of pace and we're heading in a bit of a new direction (don't worry all the current stuff is still in play). It's something I hadn't originally planned when I started the story but have been building up to for the last little while.
Harry kissed his neck, nuzzling into it again before he opened his mouth, biting down lightly. Draco moaned at the sensation, his hips thrusting again. Harry licked the spot and then rubbed his cheek against it again. He ignored the voice inside himself that whispered,
Harry paused for a moment, and then nodded firmly.
He cast about the clearing, sending his detection charms spiralling through the trees. They came back quickly, holding three magical traces, one of which was Harry's, the other was clustered around Jacob's body. Harry memorised the third and then checked the physical charm. Nothing was out of the ordinary. There were no signs of struggle. Harry frowned up at Jakub, wondering again at the extent of his magical power, and what it said about his attacker that there had been no signs of struggle.
'He's the Chosen One, remember?' Draco said wetly, remembering the awesome power Harry had demonstrated as he changed time itself to deflect a bomb blast a few weeks earlier. 'You wouldn't stand a chance.'
'They certainly didn't say no,' Ron says, and his smile is broad. 'But they want to see you in person. So get your arse downstairs.' He steps back with those words and pulls Harry's door closed.
Harry huffed in frustration at himself and rolled onto his back, the thought of Ladon's absence killing the growing arousal. What did he expect. The man ran a club. He'd been doing
It took him about an hour before he rode into Hlouška. It turned out the Sedlec Ossuary
Malfoy's hands pull him closer for just a second—just long enough for Harry to picture how it would feel to lick and bite his way down Malfoy's body—then he yelps as a Stinging Jinx hits him on the arse. He pulls back and looks down at Malfoy.
Harry feels himself flush slightly at the strange direction his mind had just gone. This sort of situation is no place for a thought like that, let alone about Malfoy. He looks down at the bracelet, feeling suspicion curl through him. His research had said only that he wouldn't be able to betray Malfoy. It had said nothing about the creation of physical awareness, or intimate thoughts with the instigator of the bond.
As Harry got closer he could make out details. The horse was stained with red and black streaks like dried and clotted blood. Its eyes shone crimson and long teeth extended from its muzzle, pointed and vicious. It shifted on its hooves, as though it wanted to run. Upon its back, its rider held the reins in an iron-clad fist.
'So, in Ireland, they... what?' Harry asked, not understanding.
'Catalyst, wait!'
'There's nothing I can do about the paper,' he said wearily. 'Never has been.'
'What are you doing?' came a voice from behind him.
Harry let what he was seeing file away into his unconscious as he rode. He let it distract him from his morbid thoughts about the anniversary that was fast approaching and instead he took in details and made connections, mapping the spread of the destruction in his mind.
Harry nodded. In that moment, he didn't think he'd ever wanted anything in his life as much as he wanted what Ladon had just described.
Draco halted, stunned by the casual confidence in his father's tone as he looked death in the eye. Somehow, his father's assumption that Draco would not act against him, like he had not acted against his father so many hundreds of times during his life put Draco right back into that place where he had no power. No control.
. This was his damned fault.
'Consorting with criminals?' Harry is aware his words have an edge of accusation to them, but he can't bring himself to rein it in completely.
Harry groaned and pulled his arse cheeks apart, feeling pressure on his hole as he did. It was just a hint, a promise of what was to come.

'No.' Barclay shook her head. 'I'll be back again tonight. Start to build up some familiarity, turn myself into a patron. A place like that, something more than just drinks has to be going on. I need to be there long enough that he offers it to me, too.'
Once he was back on his bike, he wheeled it around and turned it east. He had to be across the borders and in France before morning. By the time Ron realised he was gone and managed to get in touch with the French Ministry, he'd be half way to Germany.
Harry considered the note - considered the thought of spending Christmas lunch with Malfoy, of all people. Sure, they'd run into each other a bit lately. Had even started talking, in a reasonably civil manner. But to spend Christmas with him?
Malfoy hummed in thought. 'Those people wouldn't happen to be the people I identified for you, would they?'
'I don't regret what we had,' Ginny said, voice slightly muffled against his shirt.
Harry Apparated to the familiar street corner, anticipation and desire coiling in him. He'd taken the time to shave and dress in clothes he knew looked good on him. A part of him felt nervous, as though he were going on a date. But that was ridiculous. He'd known Draco most of his life. They've been telling each other stories about every part of their pasts and their hopes for the future for weeks. They'd saved each other's lives. They'd fucked. Still he ran sweaty palms down the legs of his jeans before he stepped up to the entrance to Release.
Harry stopped dead as they entered the doorway at the end of the stairwell. Everywhere he looked, he could see bones. Skulls, spines, rib cages. Thousands of them, hundreds of thousands, were stacked, or hanging, all over the interior of the room.
Ladon leaned back, looking him directly in the eye. 'Would you like to play, Harry?'
Despite the churning emotions inside him, he needs to know that Malfoy will still be here when he gets back. He's got too much riding on this case to lose it to Malfoy disappearing on him. The idea of it makes something twist in his chest. Harry tries to tell himself it's the thought of not making a case, of losing his chance to get back into the Ministry. But he knows it's more likely that it's the damned Loyalty Bond forcing him to want to be close to Malfoy again.
'What is this place?' Harry asked, looking around. The interior gave no clues as to what service it provided.
'Potter, stop,' Malfoy says, and something twists in his face, something that looks like desperation. 'You don't want this. I told you. I'll stay here with you as long as there's no kissing.'
'You like him, don't you?' Ron said, without any attempt at a preamble.
'Why are you here?' he asked, after a long moment. Harry stopped, staring across at him, the question catching him off guard. Why
At the thought of the boy, Harry made his journey through the house a little more purposeful. It was a few minutes before he found it. A child's bedroom. He deliberately didn't think about how he knew Malfoy favoured the East wing for a child's room because it was the one his mother used to manage, which his father never entered.
'Want to take this discussion elsewhere?' Davies says, as he finishes his meal. 'Leave your pet behind?'
glad I ran into you again,' he murmured, holding her hand just a moment too long. 'If only to save you the ...
'I've been thinking about this so much,' Harry whispered. Draco's hands clenched helplessly against Harry's hips as he fought to get himself under control. He needed to be in charge. That was what Harry liked. He wanted to give Harry what he liked.
The look Malfoy gives Davies as he says this is more of a leer and Harry bites his tongue so hard he tastes blood. Davies' look of faint suspicion disappears as he leans in to murmur in Malfoy's ear. Harry hears him, just like Davies had meant him to.
'What are you doing here?' Ron asked again, as he shook his head in answer to Harry's question. 'It's the middle of the night.' He looked Harry up and down. 'Did you ride here? The last time you saw Malfoy you tried to kill him. What the fuck are you doing here?'
Harry looked around the room for a moment, deciding he didn't feel like sitting still yet. Instead he went over to the sink, looking underneath for the washing liquid and running some hot water. The least he could do was clean up after dinner.
He felt a curl of heat run through him when Harry called out a low and gravelly, 'Enter', at his knock. Draco schooled himself - forced himself to get his feelings under control. This wasn't about him, wasn't about them - there was no 'them'. This was about advancing the cause of the Pureblood Reparation Society and supporting needed reforms. He took a breath and stepped inside the door. He immediately sought Harry out, eyes flicking over his broad shoulders, messy hair, strong arms as he leaned back in his chair and crossed them, fixing Draco with a piercing green gaze.
