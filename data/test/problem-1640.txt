Harry picks up his robes as directed, pleased with the way they fit him even though the material is heavy and sort of stiff. He’ll look good, at least, and the idea of being fancy and well-dressed around Malfoy gives him an absurd sort of thrill that he doesn’t care to examine too closely.
for cuddles, oh lovesick lord.” Draco complains, though he still peppers kisses up and down the side of Harry’s neck.
“If you could refrain from mentioning it to people outside the Eighth year, we would appreciate that.” Harry tells her, and Draco isn’t really listening to whatever she says in response. He pulls an amused Harry over to greet Ron and Neville.
“Put on pants at least, Seamus.” Harry complains, grateful for once for his terrible eyesight. He can’t see more than a distant blur where Seamus’s junk is exposed.
“These are for you, go ahead and put them on. Should be more comfortable.” Harry says, gesturing to them. Malfoy nods, dressing quickly.
The next day, Harry is fiddling with a string of Christmas lights trying to get them to light up. He’s lounging on the sofa in the living room.
on my arm, no money, no family, no place to go, no wizard will ever hire me, and I would never make it in a muggle world. Once I’m out of Hogwarts, I’m out of luck.” He says. A tear runs down his face but he remains expressionless.
“No. They’d Obliviated the hell out of him. He had spotty memories but seemed to remember me, mostly anyway. Could barely hold a conversation, never laughed. They imperiused him to work the floor again, but he wasn’t as good. I think the last straw was when he recognised someone. He tried to say something, but that blasted ankle bracelet zapped him and a bouncer took him to the back. He was put on one of the poles after that.”
“I woke up from my afternoon nap sooner than I planned on.” Harry says, grabbing for the tray of various finger foods. “Do you always eat stuff like this?”
“You all did such an amazing job!” Harry congratulates, giving them all hugs. They’re sweaty and Ron’s dress is scratchy but Harry doesn’t care.
but after that, I think you shouldn't have any." He says, nabbing the tin and clutching it to his chest.
“Well it seems like everything Harry got up to at Hogwarts is crucial somehow to European wizarding history, and I’m missing huge chunks of it. I’m the only one who doesn’t understand.”
It reminds him vaguely of the time he’d tried figging, honestly, except on the wrong end and decidedly less exciting. He wonders vaguely if he could convince one of his Doms to apply both punishments at once. He nearly shivers at the thought.
"It's sort of nice." Malfoy yawns. "I didn't think my father particularly liked me growing up. He's making an effort to be more of a father now."
he’s in bed with naked? Or if he’s as casual with his friends as he was with you? Or maybe one of them is a better cook than you.”
Narcissa moves to pat Malfoy’s knee, but he shifts back ever so slightly when she reaches out, and she withdraws her hand with a frown.
“No. I can use soap?” Draco’s gaze falls on the couple bottles and the bar of soap sitting on the shelf.
The rain was all Draco could hear. It had been an incessant sound over his entire summer, rain against stone, thunder, coldness.
That aside, Harry’s friends had been surprisingly supportive of the addition of Malfoy to general Gryffindor activities.
“It is when you’re Malfoys and have to make everything ridiculously posh.” Malfoy sniffs. Harry laughs.
He leaves the room with them, waiting until they’ve all filed out of the back of the building before he returns to the kitchen.
“Draco…” Harry starts. “I’m not going to promise that if it means you’ll stop being here.” He whispers. Draco snorts.
Draco’s hand shook as he turned the page, despite not recalling any of what the last page had read. It tore slightly with a rasp as his hand jolted out of his control. He let go of it and stared at the offending hand.
Draco nods, and follows Harry to the register. He has his own money now, but hasn’t learned muggle bills yet, so Harry handles the transaction while Draco watches intently.
Everyone’s laughing by the time he struts over, keeping a blank face and a level gaze at the back wall. He nearly topples over when he pivots on one foot, then struts back to the kitchen.
Harry clenches his hand around his own thigh, the phantom feeling of that arse in his, Harry’s, hand rather than being groped indelicately by some bloke who’s only been here two weeks.
“So two strikes against already, and he didn’t do anything to erm. Get me in the mood. So that was just… not a great experience. It’s no wonder I got with Luv shortly after.”
“Hey Draco, I made us- oh!” Harry says, moving out of the way. Draco is levitating the record player in front of himself, keeping strong eye contact as he walks. He sets it down on the table.
“I’m not sure. I asked Marion if she had any ideas and she mentioned something called ‘decision fatigue,’ which sounds like it might fit you. Do you know when you’re starting to shut down like that? Can you tell me any warning signs?”
With a great sigh, Potter tosses his fork onto the plate and leans back in his chair, crossing his arms.
"The entire point of this is to prove you're not tougher than I am. So no, I will be as boring as I please."
Abruptly, something hot and hard is pressed against him, dragging along his crack. Draco clutches at the pillow, burying his face in it to hide his terror.
"I have chronic insomnia, have since I was a child." Malfoy says. "There are certain solutions but they're not very healthy so I manage as best I can."
“No, that’s not what I wanted to talk about. I wanted to ask you why you use yes, no, maybe or I don’t know when you answer my questions.”
He releases the hand, lifting Draco up and gently laying him down on the bed. He covers the naked body gently, casting a warming charm. Harry has to make everything about this completely different from that horrid room. Warm. Soft. Nice.
Harry knew Draco was having a rough day. Harry lost him after their class let out, and against his better judgement, didn’t try to follow.
That he doesn’t just keep the conversation going mercifully, he makes you finish your thought first.
Draco comes without his own permission, and he wants to cry. It doesn’t feel any sort of good anymore, it hurts, and he feels ill.
“I’m as real as you need me to be.” Sirius says with a smile. “But you shouldn’t stay. You can go back without me.”
Once glance in the stall mirror reveals Malfoy is flushed pink with his bottom lip between his teeth again, fangs threatening to break the skin.
person you dislike. But according to your professional assessments, you are a good match, complimentary skills and all that.”
"Depends on how stressed I am, but I'll typically get about eight hours over a few days. Distribution varies."
“I’ve been called into St. Mungo’s to treat a severe curse victim, and I’ve no idea how long it will take, the call was maddeningly unhelpful. My guess is I’ll be gone at least three days.”
Harry moves, making an indignant noise when he sees Malfoy’s collection of kinkery littered over Harry’s bed.
“No, don't stop,” Malfoy whines, then huffed in a way that makes Harry believe he hadn’t meant to say that.
“I supply plants and potions to the Ministry as well as a few private parties. They are largely used by healers here and at St. Mungo’s.”
“I’ve seen your videos, the flatmate stuff.” She grins. “You went viral recently with his livestream.”
store Harry hopes to never set foot in again and does not remember the name of. Fortunately, the suit the tailor and Draco had picked out for Harry wasn’t too out of Harry’s comfort zone - a neat black button up with matching burgundy slacks and blazer.
Harry had to act now. The snake would be found soon, but Voldemort was killing everyone just because they were there. Harry didn’t have time to wait for the snake to be found.
“Oh I’m sure.” Potter says dismissively. Draco wonders if his sarcasm has reached the point that people think he’s serious.
“That’s the exact reason I brought you here.” Harry finally explains, gesturing around them. “This is the world that’s made for you. You’re a Heather Pixie, I’m fairly certain, and this is where they come from. Well, Scotland, actually, but moors in general.”
“Right! Yes, I wasn’t sure if you’d agreed to that or not.” He admitted, rushing back inside to grab his coat and scarf.
. Maybe every now and then at school, but there was always something, you know? Something more important.”
“No one says you have to watch me, Potter.” Malfoy says with a smirk, not looking up from the vase of quills he’s charming to not fall off the edge.
“Exactly! We’ll protect you, Draco. I promise. And everything we’ve talked about is safe with me.” She swears, holding out one of her pinkies. Draco stares at it.
He drops back into his chair, not looking at Harry and drawing his knees up to his chest. He puts his face on top, so only his red forehead and ears are visible to Harry.
"Well he's way older than mine was anyway. He has white hair." Harry says with a smirk as Malfoy sputters.
“You smell nice. Like... flowers or something, I can’t place where I might’ve smelled it before.” Harry says. “And treacle tart.”
“I-” Harry was cut off by a reporter jostling his arm, and with a deep frown, Draco waved his wand, encircling Harry with a gauzy curtain like the one from the club.
fic here! If you don't know what Kinktober is, it's basically where smut writers take a list of 31 prompts and write a new little smut for each day of the month.
“Lamb, you’re reading into this too much.” She says, looking to Greg for confirmation. “Just get there a bit early, half an hour or so, and have a nice time.”
Please note the trigger warning sections marked with bold /!\ symbols across the page at both the beginning and the end of the scene. There will be a summary at the end of those sections if you want to skip over them but continue reading the story. This is how I’ll be formatting content warnings for the rest of the story.
“Fine.” Draco says quietly. Harry has learned that Draco chooses his words carefully, even if it doesn’t seem like it. He personally thinks ‘fine’ is a little too generous for the Legilimens.
“You don’t have to. But that’s what happened. I wish every day that I had never done it. I regret nothing more. I’m sorry to have to tell you this, but you would find out some day. I wanted you to hear it from me. I’ve hurt you too. I’m so sorry.”
The treacle tart is gone soon after, and they deliberate for a bit what to do with the empty dishes before Malfoy just Vanishes them impatiently.
“You never send the Patronus, you always wait for me to do it.” Harry says, and Malfoy looks a bit surprised to hear it, likely waiting for more questions about his appearance.
"You couldn't just get your ears pierced or something? How are those staying in, anyway? Did they just… stick you like a pincushion? I imagine that would hurt even after they'd healed, if it's sharp on the inside too."
Malfoy breathes, thrusting into the mattress. Harry watches his arse clench and release with each dip against the bed.
“I did, there was some leftover lying about on Brutus and Knox’s plates, so I just… swiped that.” Potter says with a smirk as Draco has one piece of bacon in his mouth already. “Joking.”
Harry entered the bedroom to find Malfoy inside, lying across his bed on his stomach with his feet up near the headboard. Completely starkers.
“Secondly, I’ve seen the pensieved memory of the event, and there was absolutely no need for Harry to be under the Imperius curse to have acted in exactly the way he did. It was unnecessary.
“Nope.” Potter says, looking off to the side. “We talked about it a lot. Rose is five. After Rose, they always said they’d name me godfather if they had more.”
He has to carry Draco upstairs to the bathroom, but the hot bath seems like it helps, although he keeps giving Harry sad looks where Harry sits on the floor outside the bath.
On a hunch, Harry goes out to the harp cottage, as it’s on the way to the secret garden, his next stop.
Draco unbuttons his sleeve to show his BLOOD TRAITOR tattoo with its vines. Hold glances between Weasley and Draco, then smiles tightly and settles in her chair, looking regretful.
“Hey Neville, do you know what happened to Draco’s collar?” Harry asked, wandering about the halls looking for either his flatmate or the pale pink collar itself.
I'm so honored to have received so much support on this! I've written part of the next section already and O M G I'm so excited to post it. I'll give a hint, there's love-letters involved.
do just yet.” Lupin says. “The Aurors and the Order are all recovering in the hospital wing so we’re ready for whatever happens next.”
"Blaise gave me some cologne bottles for Christmas. To find one I like. He says I used to be very picky about the way I smelled. I don't think I'm picky anymore."
“Merlin, I could get used to this.” Harry mumbles against the skin, prodding the plug with one finger.
“I’ve never done something like this before.” He admits. Draco steps closer, returning his hand to the messy dark hair.
“No one says you have to pretend. You’ve every right to bring it up to them and ask for an explanation.” Draco presses, but he can see it’s of no use.
“Oh.” Harry says, unsure what else to say to that. “There’s a bloke who tends the bees and harvests the honey. He’s nice. I think he’s Jeanette and Marion’s cousin or brother-in-law or something.”
“Hey!” Draco complains, releasing his leg to fall back beside the other, the movement shifting the ridged plug against his sensitive insides. Draco shudders, and Potter grins.
Snape sits down behind the desk, steepled his fingers and looks at Harry and Malfoy. The clock ticks.
Draco looks up to see a potion bottle in Alpha’s hand. He takes it hesitantly, knowing it’s not going to be anything good.
"It's been over six months since you moved in, it's not exactly new. And at what point in your conversation did I come up?"
Harry wakes up as the common room gets louder in the evening. He doesn’t seem troubled about taking up the entire sofa or being so openly affectionate, although Draco stops playing with his hair when classmates he doesn’t know arrive.
Their performance was a hoot, as they’d taken the standard muggle ‘magic’ shows and turned them on their head. They pulled a hat from the mouth of a rabbit, Ron was locked into a table and duplicated so that he had a head poking out each end. George opened a vanishing cabinet and out stepped a handful of students, looking confused at having appeared on stage before retaking their seats.
“And anyway, half the things Pansy’s put in her books aren’t physically possible.” Draco adds. “She has me test them out whilst she’s drafting but then she ends up putting them into the book anyway.”
“When you’re under your red blanket, all I can see of you is a blob shape and your pretty eyes and your nose.”
“I’ll never pass Hermione.” Draco says, which makes Harry laugh. “Maybe I’ll give it a shot.” He finally agrees, and Harry looks very excited.
“Draco, we just want to make sure our son is alright.” He says quietly, turning so his shoulder cuts Harry out of the conversation.
“Really, you let me just wear these shoes without telling me we’re going on a field trip?” She asks Harry as they leave the room.
“Draco, I’ve been friends with Ron for eleven years now and even when he’s been mad at me or at Hermione, he doesn’t do stuff like that to us. He just stops talking to us for a bit until we sort things out.”
Harry laughs, leaning against another tree as he watches Malfoy use magic to lift the Furby and stare at it.
“What about this: I’ll read it to you and you can mess with my hair or squeeze my arse if you like.”
“I very much doubt you’d want me to top you.” Malfoy says casually, jerking a thumb at his back. “Look at my arse and tell me you’d rather me top.”
“Yeah, well.” Malfoy seals the envelope and stands. “I’m going to send this off, we’ll see what happens.”
“Oh.” Harry says. For some reason, he’s a bit surprised to hear of Blaise taking Draco on field trips. “What was it like?”
Weasley's WW is in Diagon, but for the purposes of this story, it's in Hogsmeade (or there's a second store, which is in Hogsmeade).
“Yeah, he said you did. Just the once? I was there nearly every week for a bit, I had no idea who ran it, I just went for the fit bartender. That would’ve been the second year you were there.”
"It's a walking stick! For poking at things and storing his wand. He can walk perfectly well without it."
“Master Draco is very focused, he won’t notice anything until he’s done.” Peppy says to Harry at a normal volume, as if Draco can’t hear her.
He does that on purpose just to be a prat. Just because he can see it makes Draco weak in the knees.
“But it’s not exactly unrealistic, is it? I mean, first I bring him to my house - no idea what sort of state he’s in, only to find out he’s got a few dozen physical ailments. Then I start to understand how thoroughly brainwashed he was, and not to mention the memory loss-”
Draco’s face took in the wonder that was the shop, tall and colourful with something to look at on every surface. Harry thought it fair to assume Draco had never been inside considering his family’s feud with the Weasleys up until now. He turned to let Draco admire everything in peace, finding George again.
“Apparently I was justified in that, you’re smearing my grademarks.” Malfoy says, his eyes on Harry’s hands.
“That’s a very normal thing to wonder.” Draco says, though he hasn’t asked her himself, guessing she either was
Harry lounges on the bed while he waits. A few minutes later, Malfoy steps out in a black dress. His head still looks like him, but the rest of his body has shifted into Meredith’s.
“That’s fine. If you asked me not to, I’d never speak of it either.” Harry says without missing a beat. Malfoy nods.
Harry conjures a glass with water, passing it to Draco with a wordless encouragement to drink. Draco downs the whole thing.
“They would… ‘punish’ him for breaking the rules they gave him. I think he was Imperiused, and maybe drugged on top of it. He’s been there since the battle, my guess is that Fenrir Greyback took him. Draco doesn’t know the rest of their real names, but I’d venture to guess they’re all wanted for something or other.”
As Mr. Weasley takes a breath, Draco lifts the pillowcase, which looks a bit like a tote bag, with the nice canvas fabric, and pulls out the record player he’d repaired.
“I want to do this. No one is making me do it. I know I don’t have to. But Jack didn’t have to help me, and he did. Now it’s my turn.”
Draco looked down at his hand, surprised to find a wand in it. It wasn't his, he couldn't remember where it came from.
When Harry was doing up the last of his shirt buttons, Draco spritzed him with the new perfume he’d been sent by some brand or other.
Harry and Draco were the last to enter the garden, and George whooped when they appeared, calling everyone’s attention from the meal back to the couple.
It’s only been maybe ten minutes when there’s a crash in the kitchen followed very closely by Molly’s
Malfoy moves to his knees, shifting the crown on his head to sit more suitably and using more heather to weave through his plaits and keep the crown in place.
“I mean, no-” Draco says, looking back down at his book. He seems like he wants to say more, but doesn’t.
“If people were in danger it’s because they chose to follow you, they knew what they were doing. You’ve always done the right thing.”
OKAY this is a huge chapter but I couldn't bring myself to break it up any more, I've kept you guys waiting long enough I think. Genuinely, all the comments have brought me so much joy, so thanks to everyone!
“You were disoriented.” Harry tries. “You didn’t know where you were. You didn’t know what happened.”
It’s late, very late, and they’re tiredly packing up their reports for the night to be completed Monday. Malfoy sighs.
“Yeah, here.” He pulls out a folded and stacked pile of clothes and a pair of shoes. Malfoy eyes them warily.
Harry rests his chin on his hand, looking at Draco until Draco shifts around a bit, scowling harder.
“Very good of him. Did you want to get up now?” Harry asks, looking again at the angelic face watching him from the other side of the bed.
“I don’t think so. Your father’s name is Lucius.” Harry says. “Oh, you mean because you’re named after a constellation?”
Harry turns to see Draco walking into Potions in one of his usual little skirts, which reveals the love bites Harry had left peppered all over the pale skin of his thighs.
Harry once again makes eye contact, but the lack of recognition bothers him. Malfoy’s eyes have never looked so shallow.
“He invited himself over the other day, we were going out and I had to change out of my work robes, but I’d been wearing it the night before and left it on the sofa.”
The Crabbes had always seemed generally even-tempered, at least before the war. When they were children, Mrs. Crabbe took rather a liking to Draco, though she was always telling him he was too thin and should eat more. But he’s steered clear of any potential interaction with her for the last seven years.
He’s trying very hard not to be smug, but from the look on Scarrow’s face, he’s not doing a very good job.
Malfoy’s joints crackle as he gets off the floor, following Harry. They have a new arrangement where Harry handles the food parts of meals, but Malfoy does everything else, like setting the table. They have a shared incentive of not being poisoned.
“Can you call me Draco?” It’s soft, vulnerable and nervous. Harry has never heard Malfoy - Draco - sound like this. “I- I don’t remember… I don’t remember anyone calling me that. I don’t know if it’s my real name. I don’t like the others.”
“I’d boot him. I mean, he did try to kill me a few times so maybe I’m biased, but he’s your dad, so.”
“You’re not.” He says, avoiding the word. “You’re not, Draco. You told me a while ago that you trust me, do you still?”
The memory fades away, and everything shifts around for the next memory, which, unlike the two previous, starts without preamble.
“Enough about your lovely boyfriend.” Shannon says indulgently. Hearing the words from her gives Harry a little thrill, and she seems to be aware of this as she smiles. “I gave you an assignment last we were here.”
“Legally - technically. I want our friends and family to see us married. Something small, maybe, I don’t care, I just want my family there.”
“I asked Ayla to show me how to plait. Her hair was down when you met her, but she usually has it plaited.”
Harry focuses his attention to brush a strand of hair off Meredith’s face, trying to look very absorbed in it. He probably succeeds, it’s not difficult.
“I can’t, Harry, Harry I can’t take it- I can’t-” Draco wails, his legs kicking beneath Harry as much as they can. “I’m gonna come-”
“At what point in our friendship do I gain the ability to read your mind?” Blaise asks, looking down into Draco’s face.
“You’re saying he holds financial control of your establishment?” Robards asks, looking delighted. Rosmerta shakes her head.
“I’m so glad you’ve told me that, you made me very happy.” He says, taking Draco’s hand and squeezing.
“Mm, fresh apples, a bit of cinnamon, fancy French cologne and leather.” He says, and Draco opens his mouth to tease him for it, as obviously he’s smelling Draco, but Harry startles him by leaning in close, pressing his nose against the side of Draco’s neck and breathing in.
"Sorry pet, you'll have to wait until it's time." Harry says, reaching across the table to pat Draco's hand lovingly.
“Funny thing, I usually get plants from Neville Longbottom. Are you still friends with him? He has a conservatory with all sorts of plants for potions.”
“It’s not a bad idea, there’s loads of charities you could donate to. But I wouldn’t say your channel’s not worthwhile, it makes lots of people smile. That’s always something valuable.”
The letter has Astoria’s writing on the front, and Draco frowns at it for a moment before opening it.
The ‘Shroud of Blind and Deafness’ is placed over Scarrow’s head while everyone vote on whether he’ll receive a slap or a kiss.
“Romilda is playing hard to get.” Pansy sniffs. “She’s had a thing for Potter, but now he’s off the market, she’ll no doubt need a comforting shoulder to cry on.”
Malfoy smirks, holding out the back portions of the skirt which only exposes more skin. He’s not wearing anything underneath.
They pause when they stand behind Kingsley Shacklebolt and Mr. Weasley, whose robes and broad shoulders hide them from view.
“I don’t need you naked today. Just take your shoe off and roll your trouser leg up for me please.” Marion says. Draco tilts his head to the side, but doesn’t object.
A bang. A crash. The sounds of battle are coming from all around, and now that he’s listening, he’s overwhelmed by the noise. His throat is still too hoarse to yell back to her, assure her he’s alive, if nothing else.
“Yeah. Guess he decided he didn’t want a part in it after all. But… but Malfoy should know his friend did that. I don’t know how to tell him, they had to Stun him to get him off the corpse.”
as she tells him about her coworker who is genderfluid and currently using their store discount to experiment with gender expression.
“I put him in many situations he would’ve otherwise avoided. And I’m sure if you and I weren’t friends, you’d have someone else to help you. Your sister works for one of the top hospitals in the world.”
“Good morning, gentlemen. I can’t say this is much of a surprise, won’t you please come in?” He greets, a gracious smile plastered onto his face and a sweeping gesture of welcome as he opens the door wide. He sounds far more awake than Harry feels.
“I was wearing something really skimpy and tight, so you know, nothing hidden. And at the end of the evening, I was just
Harry stops halfway through unwrapping his first gift, distracted by watching Draco’s delighted face as he opens up gifts from everyone present.
With a snort, Harry finally starts getting himself dressed, starting with socks just because it peeves Draco.
The man raises his manacled hands as if to touch his cheek, staring at Draco in shock. His hands move again, and Draco slaps the other side of his face. The auror catches Harry’s eye, and Harry shakes his head.
Draco.” Harry says, using Draco’s thighs to slide him closer to his knees, away from his crotch. Draco looks at him.
“I don’t know. Maybe because they know I owe them too much to even consider betraying their confidence?” Draco shrugs.
"One sec. Hey I'm back sorry." He unmutes his audience. "Malfoy's got a problem with opening his own deliveries, something about a bad experience with a knife, so I'm going to help him because I'm a saint. Saint Potter, he calls me."
They’d returned to the solarium, the trickle of water from the fountain in the corner filling the quiet pleasantly. The air smelled like a more potent version of Draco’s flower-ridden room, and bees and other insects buzzed about happily. It’s a bit like walking through a perfumery, Harry imagines.
Harry finds Malfoy easily. He’s still among the taller students, even though he’s taken his shoes off and is only in the shorts and shirt while he holds one end of a- something, Harry doesn’t know what it is to be honest, and Zambini holds the other.
“I thought you were irritating before, Merlin above.” Harry complains, pushing him toward his bedroom.
“Really, Potter, it’s a wonder you haven’t killed anyone with your potions. I’m not sure I’d really want to use one if this is the sort of care you take.” He’s mostly joking but is a bit horrified, and is relieved when Harry laughs.
” Harry growls, looming over Malfoy knowing full well he’s got an expression like a wild animal hunting its prey.
Harry Apparates just inside the gate with Rose on his back while Ron carries Hugo and Hermione nearly topples over in her high heels.
“Right, but a mind healer is… better at listening. And they could give you better advice than I can.”
"I'm okay, thank you. I'll have a margarita." Draco says breathily. Jack nods, looking to the man with Draco for his order.
“You missed the opportunity for eggs benedict.” He says defensively, before sticking the entire thing in his mouth.
Harry’s heart is pounding as he looks into Draco’s scared face, completely at a loss of what to say to him.
“That’s true. But he will eat some of my food after, so I was wondering what kinds of food I should avoid giving him.”
“Get off the counter, Draco!” Harry shouts on a whim. A loud meow responds, and Harry laughs. “I’ll be back soon.”
“From what she said, there will probably be reporters at the Ministry.” Harry warns Draco as he shoves his feet into boots.
“You’re right.” Malfoy agrees, turning back. “Oh, can you help with the zip? It got caught partway up.”
Pansy Parkinson, the girl who’d tried turning him over to Voldemort, had also approached Harry at the start of the year. Her stuttered, scowled apology was awkward but heartfelt, and Harry still cringes to remember it.
This bathroom has a large window above the tub, and Harry watches the dark clouds rolling by when Draco dozes off.
With that taken care of, the girls release Draco to mingle with the rest of the tamers and search out the alcohol table.
“No, I don’t care anymore, I’m so sick of talking about plants and plant parts. I need sleep.” Harry says.
Draco whines as Harry strokes his hair, and his hand pauses, mouth open to ask if it was a good sound, but Draco only nods, a tiny, quick motion. Harry starts stroking again.
“I know. I’m still hoping we can phase them out. But one of them is to wear clothes around other people.”
“She’s probably fallen asleep on the sofa by now.” Malfoy says, pushing himself upright with his hands on Neville’s back and craning his neck to see behind him.
“I never said we’re the same. I know we’re not. But that-” Potter gestures at the marred skin of Draco’s right side. “-that was not your fault. That should never have happened to you. You didn’t deserve that.”
“Yeah I know.” Harry says, wondering if Malfoy had looked for them specifically or just knows what Harry’s back looks like. “I don't know, maybe. They do look cool but I don't know where I'd get them.”
“Excuse me, what?” He growls, joining Draco by the door. He shifts his shoulder slightly in front of his husband to act as a sort of shield. Draco’s hand rests hesitantly on his back.
“No, keep it with you.” Harry says. “If you see the snake Voldemort keeps with him, kill it with the sword, alright? It’s really important.”
considering they’re not really memories at all. But after all the Obliviation Draco’s been subject to… it feels wrong for him to just erase what he
Harry knows they’re talking in circles, and Draco is starting to get frustrated because he can’t explain what’s wrong in a way that Harry understands.
“I asked who he thinks throws the best parties around here.” Draco says, sipping his drink innocently.
That’s what he tells himself the next day, when he’s in the front of the crowd, but barely glancing at the dark-haired man on the stage now.
“Here’s a thought, what if you studied too?” Draco says, a warm smile sneaking onto his face. Harry rolls his eyes.
“The only things I wasn’t able to take care of today are the blood issues, which we talked about, the scars on your chest, and your stomach.”
“Because- because… you’re… you’re not happy.” Draco repeats, frown deepening. “You’re- you… you’re not happy.”
When he opens the door, Draco is sitting there primly, paw raised and claws out, frozen now that the door is gone.
It takes a couple tries, but once the looped scene reaches the point where it jumps back to the beginning, Harry pushes ever so slightly into the next part of the memory.
Time went on, and despite Hermione and Ron both working for the Ministry, Harry’d heard nothing of his rival. He spent most of his days gardening in Neville’s greenhouse, decidedly
“There’s a very simple solution for that.” Harry suggests before he thinks about it twice. He nearly cringes.
“And have you spoken with Mister Harry Potter after the events of June 3, 2008, the beginning of his bond with Draco Malfoy?”
“If you leave me here with a full hard-on just to go wank in the loo, you can kiss my arse goodbye forever.”
“C’mere, babe. Leave them to their gay little morning rituals.” Dean mutters, tugging the hangings closed again and giving Seamus a noisy kiss.
smooths the way. “And sometimes, it’s used to help prepare for sex. Have you fingered your arse before?” He asks.
Harry’s noticed the cat does that when peeved, as he knows Harry doesn’t like when he sits on the counters.
Harry averts his eyes, on principle alone, but considering that Malfoy’s taken to laying across the floor in the sitting room naked, he very likely doesn’t care.
“So you should know, that when muggle technology is introduced to a magical environment, the technology becomes thoughtful.”
“For punishment. I didn’t answer your question.” Malfoy says. His voice is crackly with tears. He swallows loudly. Every muscle in his body looks tense.
That night - their last night with the bond magic - they don’t have sex. They stare up at Draco’s charmed ceiling and point out the stars.
Harry turns to see Malfoy running his hands over his face. He looks exhausted, and Harry wonders how much energy it takes to keep up a transfiguration like that over an entire evening.
Harry stays beneath the stage for some time, trying to catch his breath and figure out what to do now.
“What are you doing out here?” A voice startles him, and Draco spins, instantly regretting it as the room swims.
Draco doesn’t blush anymore, he wears his title, the lovemarks from the night previous, and little else, with pride.
“Snape wouldn’t know flirting if it flew up his nose.” Ginny says blandly. “I’m glad you talked, though. It just takes time, often.”
Harry again wonders if it’s a fairy thing or just a Malfoy thing that he has to express himself in such a roundabout way.
“Okay. I’ll make a deal with you. We’ll go upstairs and I’ll give you lots of nice touches in bed, does that sound good?”
Harry tries to think of other options, any option really. There’s no floo inside, he doesn’t have his cloak, and he’s afraid to leave Malfoy here. He’s sure it’s easy to see them conversing.
Draco were to get better and want to still sleep in bed with Harry, he would stop sleeping clothed. But now is not that time.
After ruling out all pixie types but Heather, Harry decided to take Malfoy toward the mountains through Stoke, up to the moors.
All Draco has to do is lift his wand, pointing it at the nearest one, and all the photographers almost simultaneously shield their cameras protectively with their bodies. Harry almost laughs.
"Americans have funny things they say. Saying sneakers. In place of trainers. Like where are you sneaking? Or 'sweater.' If you're sweating in it, take it off."
Harry’s arse has gone a bit numb, but he does as he was asked. It’s nothing compared to what was demanded of Draco.
When that has been agreed on, the Shroud is removed and Knox moves to Inkwood, raises her hand, then swoops in for a brief peck. Inkwood giggles, touching her lips. Knox pats her shoulder, and Potter snorts.
“They were expelled. She said something about a person named Umbridge, who was nasty to you and your friends.” Draco reads off the page. “Fred and George set fireworks off at school.”
Draco throws his hands up, sighing heavily. He looks immensely distressed, and when he starts rubbing his temples again, Harry tries guessing what’s wrong.
“Gregory Goyle, Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott. Vincent Crabbe is dead.” He reads. “Do you see them now?”
"You're sure? I know it's tempting to accept a dare, but piercings take some time to heal and we recommend taking the time to research and all…"
Harry sighs, eyes closing. The magic swirls under his skin, and he’s hard in less than a second. He just barely manages to keep himself from thrusting against it.
“Potter’s got Defense this morning, doesn’t he?” Pansy asks, and Draco could kiss her for revealing she actually
“What do you think his job is?” Harry asks curiously. He’s not sure if the uncomfortable way Lucius said ‘working’ was due to its supposed nature or Lucius’ opposition to any sort of labour.
having to fight Malfoy at every turn, of having him sort of on Harry’s side after everything… that might make everything just a little easier this year.
“Is Draco down yet? I thought he’d greet us at the door, but he’s foregone civility.” Blaise says with a smirk. “Hello, Potter. Good to see you, I suppose. Well done on nabbing the ponciest of us.”
“I’ll shower when you’re done.” Harry says. “Would you like me to give you some privacy?” He offers, reaching for the door handle.
“Well, fuck you too, Scarrow.” Brutus says blandly, flipping Scarrow off casually with the hand around the neck of a beer.
“Draco, squeeze my hand if you can hear me.” Harry instructs. Nothing. He sighs, rubbing a hand over his face.
Men - dancers - are in various stages of undress on the poles and floors, writhing and showing themselves off shamelessly. Draco blushes and averts his eyes.
The spello-taped notes continue to appear, a new one every day. Malfoy uses ink to write on them, which runs after they shower and the steam collects on the mirror they’re taped to.
Harry and Draco only stayed for Jack’s trial, as Harry knew he would get angry no matter how severe the rulings for the club owners were, and Draco didn’t seem to want to see his old bosses.
“Mine.” Malfoy says, then glances at Harry. “We switch off between the Manor and the Twins’ flat, but with all of us I think the Manor would be more comfortable. My parents won’t bother us. I rather suspect they believe I’m having an affair with George.”
“It’s alright. I’m sort of getting used to it.” Draco says, crushing a can in one hand a bit viciously.
“Yes. I wrote about today.” Draco says, standing up. His eyes snap to Harry abruptly. “I signed it.”
“Right, yeah. Slept through it.” Harry stammers. He takes Neville’s seat across from Luna, feeling a bit weird about that too. He serves himself some lunch, but keeps looking at Draco all through it.
Draco is pretty wiped out by the time they get back home, but still points his new wand at some things here and there to levitate or otherwise interact with them.
“Er, house elf.” Hermione says. The book flips open, pages fluttering until it settles on a section on house elves. Hermione squeals and covers her mouth. “A voice activated placefinder?”
to, but it’s due in the morning, so we’ve got to finish.” Harry says. Draco clenches down around Harry’s cock, and the gentle arms wrapped around his back tighten slightly.
“Thanks, ‘Mione. You’re a good friend.” He says. She holds out her arms and he hesitantly steps into them, giving her a hug. He feels awkward about it, he’s never been much of a hugger. But he’s seen the Golden Trio hug each other frequently, so evidently at least some of them are. It feels nice, he decides.
“Okay, why don’t we stop touching for a little bit, and we’ll see if the wrong feeling goes away or gets worse.” Harry suggests.
“Oh, right, so when you were speaking with Dumbledore in the Astronomy tower the night he was killed-”
“Yes.” Draco says, shuffling his belongings into neat little piles and closing his notebook around the ankle bracelet bookmark.
“You don’t have to apologise, like I said, I’m not offended by it. You could go around snogging people randomly to test it out more, but physically, your body didn’t really respond how it would’ve if you’d been interested in the kissing.”
Draco closes his eyes and tips his head back against the headboard. His hand is sweaty and trembling even with how calm he seems, and Harry kisses his knuckles before he casts.
“That’s not what I said, I said you’re not over the Puddifoot Debacle, and we’re going to go change that.” Malfoy says importantly.
Harry can’t linger on the thought for too long, as the moment they’re in their room again, Draco pushes him down on the bed and is halfway through unbuttoning his shirt.
“You’re fine here, I think.” Harry says, stowing his map. “I just… I heard something you guys should hear.”
“We’re in a bit of a unique position, me working with both of you.” Shannon says, pouring them each a cup of tea.
Ginny was still in Wales, Charlie in Romania and Percy in France, but Arthur and Molly, George, Hermione, Ron and Rose were all present.
“He’s doing really well, isn’t he. I mean, you didn’t see him when I first brought him home, but he’s come so far in such a short amount of time.”
“I need a Galleon from you.” She says, swiping Knox’s coffee, taking a sip and making an odd whining sound before spitting it out. Knox flips her off.
“I’ll plait your hair after it dries.” Draco promises, and takes Harry’s hands to rub lotion into his skin. It feels
“It’s just, the school has been so downtrodden. It’s not a healthy environment for learning. We could use a bit of spirit right about now.”
But while up close looking into the familiar eyes, the ones which used to flash with disdain upon seeing him, melt into liquid mercury when angry, and grow cold when embarrassed, Harry found no emotion inside them. It was startling.
“Now where would I get drunk at Hogwarts?” Draco repeats, and Harry throws up his hands. Draco flinches away.
The Prince had looked him up and down, eyes catching on the exposed vee of Draco’s chest, where his shirt fell open - stylish, yet a bit scandalous depending on who was asked.
“He was a performer, you said?” Hermione asked. “In a gay strip club owned by Death Eaters? Is he even gay?”
“I don’t know how to make you feel better.” Harry says. “I’m really sorry we were insensitive, and I’m going to do my best to not do something like that again.”
“We can do it.” Ron says confidently. “The snake won’t stay by him forever, it would get in his way underfoot and it’s too big to hold. We’ll use Harry’s cloak to get close.”
“Yeah. And the others are the return tickets.” Harry says, then nods at the note. “Look at the paper.”
Draco is slapped by Scarrow, though Draco suspects that was decided because Scarrow has been far too eager to kiss or be kissed by anyone and it's gotten ridiculous.
“Just remember, Hogwarts is already short one professor, don’t kill him at least until Sprout’s back on her feet if only for McGonagall’s sake.”
Neville snaps another photo of them, and despite Harry’s grumbling, he’s absolutely going to swipe it and add it to his little collection upstairs. Fodder for teasing Malfoy when he comes back, probably.
“I had a disillusionment on you, nobody saw you. I told them you’d gone back out to watch for stragglers.” Harry says.
why is it that everything you say is so fucking-” Potter cuts himself off, hands cupping Draco’s jaw and dragging him into another kiss.
“I did not like that. I didn’t tell you.” Draco says, holding out his wrist. Harry kisses it before tapping it gently.
Draco practices cockwarming sometimes, and it’s not very painful anymore. He can take the handsome man’s cock and stay still. He likes the way the handsome man touches his hair, and sometimes his middle or his legs.
“I was only 15 minutes late, Blaise, your kitchen staff kept the food warm enough, didn’t they?” Ayla says fondly, sitting down across from Blaise.
Draco’s plans are very detailed, with a great deal of figures calculated for costs and estimated profits.
“Very true.” Harry smiles at him, leaning in to press a noisy kiss right behind Draco’s ear. Draco blushes while their friends complain. Harry’s breath is a whisper against Draco’s skin as he whispers
“Okay.” Draco breathes. Harry smiles, lowering his hand to hesitantly stroke over Draco’s skin, just barely brushing his fingertips along his collarbones. Draco’s skin tingles and he feels his eyes slip shut. It feels heavenly.
Several nights a week, suspicious noises come from the closed curtains of Dean’s bed, and Harry casts a Muffliato, trying not to imagine scenarios where suspicious noises are coming from his own bed whilst his dormmates grumble and put up silencing spells.
“He’s absolutely thrilled at the number of Gryffindors in his home tonight.” Narcissa says with a funny grin, one that seems like she’s not accustomed to using often. It suits her.
“Oh? If you’re a healer, you didn’t happen to get the job which was posted in the paper two weeks ago, did you? The
“Okay, what were the logistics there?” Inkwood asks. “That’s a lot of prick and not very many holes.”
Narcissa hums as she starts the hairbrush at Malfoy’s forehead and brushes it all back. His eyes close, and Harry finds the repetitive motion mesmerising to watch.
Malfoy, for all his bitching about Harry taking too long in the shower recently, takes far longer in the bathroom as a whole.
“Good.” Harry smiles. “The first time I came here was the summer after the war. I was spending an afternoon helping Neville sort out some money his gran gave him so he wouldn’t have to go back to school and take his NEWTS.”
“Of course, yes, I love it.” Harry grins, turning back to see Draco clutching the snuff box nervously. “This is wonderful, I’ve always wanted to learn to ride.”
Draco sits up a bit, freeing one of his hands and cupping Harry’s jaw, tangling his fingers into the hair behind Harry’s ear. Leaning in, he gives Harry two slow, hot kisses that suck the breath right out of Harry’s lungs.
“Probably Aurora.” Harry guesses. “It’ll be nice to see Neville, though. I haven’t heard from him in ages.”
“Pretend like you’re not crying. Or about to. You did it just now and you did it in the bathroom last week.
“Potter’s pants at Occlumency.” Malfoy says from where he’s sitting at the other end of the table, writing letters.
“No, he’s not brewing it, he made some a long time ago and he uses it to make the shop smell like everything anyone who walks in wants. He swears it’s a business tactic, but George and I think he just really likes whatever he smells. He won’t tell us what it is.” Fred says with a roll of his eyes.
“Yes.” Draco says, sitting on the bed. Harry sits in front of him on the bench, waiting to see if Draco will keep talking. “It doesn’t work anymore.”
They put a spare pillow between them, but only an hour or so after falling asleep, Harry wakes up with Draco beneath him, grunting his name.
“Is it fine that I know about him?” Harry asks hesitantly. He doesn’t need to specify who. Draco stiffens slightly, but answers.
“Hm?” Malfoy licks his lips, catching Harry’s shoulder in the process. Harry’s further distracted by the way Malfoy’s hips shift as he sits up a little, looking unsurprised that Harry’s beneath him.
“You should be there, then!” Hermione says, her voice increasing in pitch. “You need to be fit for the battle!”
“He’s going inside.” Harry tells her. She nods, leaning up to kiss him again. When she pulls away, Harry tries very hard to keep his breath steady.
As she talks, Harry can’t look away from her face, with the long, darkened eyelashes framing the familiar silver eyes, which catch the light reflected by the dress. Her lips are painted a dark red, almost purple tonight, and she looks like an evil queen.
“Hm.” Draco thinks back to the ones at the Triwizard, and whether or not he’d learned any names in school. “I know… Hungarian Hornsnout.”
“I’ll call my brother. If anyone can prove you’re not under a curse, it’s Bill.” Ron says, already moving towards the floo.
“Alright, let’s go then.” Harry says, grabbing Draco’s thighs firmly and standing up with him still hanging on. Draco yelps a bit, holding tightly to Harry’s shoulders. “Is this okay?” Harry asks.
“Fine.” Malfoy squeaks, keeping his eyes directed down as his cheeks flush redder. Harry’s unsure if he’s avoiding his reflection or Harry’s gaze.
“I would agree, and I think I’ve got my sights set on one now.” He says, leaning over the table into Draco’s space. Draco forces himself to keep from flinching away.
After a brief search, he finds Draco cradling a teacup wrapped in a spare duvet from one of the guest bedrooms, sitting on the bench beneath the roses in the back garden.
The reason for breaking them up into a series is so I can skip large chunks of time/change perspective and style/post them when I feel like it/because I want to.
Though he tries to hide it, Malfoy cringes with his entire body, dropping Harry’s hand and moving to stick his into his pockets before realising he’s wearing a skirt and has none.
“Potter, what on earth are you wearing?” Draco asks, aiming for casually disdainful but not quite hitting the mark.
“It was good to hear from you, Draco. Really. I’m so relieved you’re alive and you’re safe. Let me know anytime you need anything or if you want to visit and I’ll be there, alright?” Zabini steps closer to Draco, who takes a small step back into Harry.
“That’s okay.” Harry says. “Do you want to leave it for now? We can always come visit Marion another time if you feel comfortable talking about it later.”
Harry stepped over bodies trying not to look too closely as he fought his way to where he heard high-pitched cackles.
For someone who doesn’t remember nearly killing and nearly dying, it seems very unlikely he’d remember watching a sunset.
With Draco around, he doesn’t take the time to let loose like he used to, only sometimes in the shower. Harry sighs in relief when he gets a hand around himself. He summons his lube, adding it to the equation.
Immediately upon arrival, Draco and Potter were accosted by Ashe and Inkwood, wearing a magenta fleece dressing gown and a tshirt and pyjama bottoms respectively, both in fluffy slippers.
having this conversation with you.” Harry mutters, shovelling eggs into his mouth so he can leave the table sooner.
“No.” Malfoy says coldly, speaking more carefully. “It only works if the hair’s from the original head. Not from a polyjuiced head.”
“Not for ages. Send him to bed if you find him. Better yet, take him there yourself, maybe then he’ll sleep.”
Harry settles him on his lap so Draco’s weight rests mostly on his knees against the sofa cushion. He directs Draco’s arms over his shoulders and around his head, then puts his own arms around Draco’s still damp middle.
“They kept asking you to explain yourself. I thought they wanted to understand what you were doing, but they don’t trust you, do they.” She says. Draco shrugs.
Ron and the other auror sat nearby, silently listening and writing things down occasionally. Harry stroked Draco’s arms or legs, hoping he could keep him calm and… and okay.
Ron uses Omnioculars to scan the area the Death Eaters came from, but there’s no sign of any movement.
“No. I don’t remember. I touched it. I remembered again when Alpha told me I had a private performance.”
“Well, let me take care of you now.” Harry says, sneaking his arm around Draco’s back and scooting him closer so their thighs are pressed together.
Dinner itself is a strange combination, but Harry wants Draco to be able to partake. He makes scrambled eggs with melted cheese bits and pulled chicken, seasoning on the table for the people, bland in the pot for Draco.
“No one knew but Greg. Vince told him shortly after it started because Greg thought we were excluding him from get-togethers.”
“Okay.” Harry holds out a hand to help him up, which Draco takes. Harry smiles nervously, and Draco smiles weakly back. It’s a relief.
“Draco, don’t work this thing with Potter up in your mind. Yeah, it might just be a breakfast between friends. It might be a date. Just go and have a nice time, okay?”
He’s still lying flat on his back, hard and missing the weight of another person when Malfoy returns, pumping white lotion from a bottle onto his hands.
Harry’s stomach dropped out through his feet when he saw Madam Rosmerta. Draco didn’t look thrilled, either.
It was rather flattering, but Draco had a lot of potion brewing to catch up on after using so many on Mr. Devoe, and he had to clean up the rather untidy hospital room the tamers had nicked various supplies from to deal with their own injuries.
Malfoy Summons a variety of books off the shelves and sends them in stacks to different parts of the room.
Goyle lost it first, drawing his knees up and sobbing loudly into them, his face hidden. Malfoy nodded at Harry, wrapping himself around Goyle, his shoulders shaking.
Feeling a burning hunger race through his veins, Harry grabs one of Malfoy’s legs and pulls it up, wrapping it around his own waist. Harry presses his hips closer into the space between, grinding down as his mouth demands more of Malfoy.
Draco doesn’t bother denying it, he’s known for a long time that he’s very fond of Greg in a bit-more-than-friends way.
"Blaise wouldn't talk to me for a week." Draco mutters. "So I can't go tomorrow. I absolutely cannot go early for- I'll call in sick-"
Unsurprisingly, there are books and papers all over the bed, and Harry gives Malfoy a disappointed look. Malfoy just puts his hands on his hips and glares back.
“I’m sorry- it’s just- the last thing I remember before waking up here was my friend dying. We knew each other as children. All I hear are his screams.” Draco says hoarsely, desperately, pleadingly.
“You’re looking better. Your aura, I mean.” Harry says calmly, dragging his magic over the wrinkles to smooth them.
I wrote most of this chapter back in March or April before I even posted the first chapter, and now we're finally here!
“Master Draco has not tried to hide his feelings since Master Harry arrived.” She says. “He wanted for Master Harry to read the flower book for weeks now.”
“I’ll leave you to explore a bit. Cut whatever you like and I can wrap it up for you before you leave. I’ll have tea ready whenever you’re done out here.”
Willows lifts up, wiping his mouth with the back of one hand while the other keeps Draco’s wrists in place.
Harry lets his eyes roam appreciatively over the curve of Draco’s waist and his hip. His eyes land on the stretched rim with the vibrating plug nestled between Draco’s soft arse cheeks. Harry resists the urge to pet the attached fluffy tail or give it a tug to further tease.
“I was going to ask you if you wrote down what happened during the raid, but I only wanted to figure out what was happening to your memories. I thought one of your bosses Obliviated you.”
He slips out of the bed, adjusting himself in his shorts as he grabs his shoes from the floor and leaves the room.
“I’m sure you didn’t lose them for good.” Draco says gently. “People don’t go through what the three of you have just to wake up ten years later and decide not to speak to each other anymore.”
“He doesn’t know pulling your tail bothers you, he’s only a baby.” Harry says, offering a bite of rice to Draco, who eats it primly off the fork.
“He came in with me, but once it was handled, he went back out to continue doing his goddamn job.” He says angrily.
“No. He’s told me things. We used to hate each other.” Draco says easily. “He thought you could tell me why I was so rude to him and whether or not I fancied him in school.”
“I’m not sure, it depends on how long he was on the stuff. Lust potions contain opium. If he, as I suspect, has been on it the entire time he was imprisoned… well, it might take all day, but he should feel better by tonight.”
“Mate, ‘Mione’s waiting for you to go to bed.” Ron says rather tiredly. “So I guess, wake up early and snog in the morning before everything starts.”
“Bumped into her in the supermarket, actually. She threatened me over the last carton of eggs. I know better, so she got them.”
“It’s not snogging, it’s literally a peck. I’ve had sex before, you know. I’m not playing unless you flip a coin when it’s my turn. At least give me 50/50 odds.”
“Why do you like it so hot? It burns my skin.” Harry asks. He tries not to sound like he’s complaining but Draco wrinkles his nose.
“I’m sorry for how the game went. I see what you mean, how everyone’s constantly bringing it up but then mocking you for talking about it.”
“Just because I’m a slut doesn’t mean I’ve no self-respect or self-preservation. I’m still a Slytherin after all.”
Malfoy’s wearing jeans and a muggle rock band tshirt with a flannel and high top trainers. And he looks
“Right, I wanted to pop in to see what you’ve got now. Ah, would you mind-” He said, glancing at Draco and tugging George far enough from the door so Draco wasn’t in immediate earshot, though if he tried he could probably still hear.
Harry is torn. He really doesn’t win either way, but at least if he takes them, he’ll get his clothes back and maybe wipe the smug look off Malfoy’s face. So he bends to pick them off the floor, avoiding Malfoy’s arse in his face.
“I do, I like to use all my flowers in many ways.” Draco says, lighting the candles. “If I’d planned this better, I’d have some vases of roses in here too.”
“That’s the first time you’ve used the ‘something else’ option. I’m really proud of you for that, too.” He says. Draco looks down, still scowling, but trying to hide his blush.
“I recommend starting with blander foods like bread, bananas, rice and chicken to reorient your system to get used to digestion again. Small, more frequent portions will also help, like you’ve been doing. As for your arsehole, I strongly recommend waiting for at least six months before any kind of penetration. Your body needs to heal. Taking a shit will be painful at first, but will fade in time.”
Harry snorts, rolling onto his side so he doesn’t choke on his own spit. That only makes him laugh harder.
“Here-” Drake says, holding out her hand for Draco’s wand, which he passes over, and transfiguring the shoes Scarrow’s already wearing into very tall, very pointy heels.
He makes it outside the house, runs barefoot through the garden, ignoring the pain in his- everywhere.
Many of you have also read this work. I was shocked to find that the boy I’d hated in school had abandoned the ideas he was raised to believe and gone so far as to encourage others to do the same.”
Draco walked right in, music blaring as soon as the door was open, and Harry followed him toward the lights flashing down a hallway.
Harry squints at the faintly glimmering skin, which lacks even a scar from where the Dark Mark once sat.
Harry falls asleep easily with Draco’s head tucked against his shoulder, Draco’s soft puffs of breath warming his hand.
The man bounces his thighs, which jostles Draco up and down on his cock slightly. The man’s hand gropes Draco’s cock under the skirt and through his thong, teasing.
Malfoy lets out a huge breath, tossing his book aside and turning so his feet are on the floor again. He stares at Harry.
“It’s explained in that document. Draco Malfoy is under arrest for the use of the Imperius curse as well as the unlicensed use of a bewitched wedding altar.”
“Oh I’m already picturing it and I hate it. But I still have Pansy and Blaise and my long-term sex partners, so I’m sure I’ll survive. You’ll make me godfather of course.”
“That’s what you want, isn’t it? You want me to get you off so you can stop thinking about everything. You want me to teach you how to be good. I can’t do that unless I know what I’m working with.”
His eyes snap into focus as Malfoy comes out, wearing the same thing as the first time Harry had seen him.
“Probably. Whatever would the Slytherins say if you went to breakfast in the same thing you wore yesterday?”
Goyle’s dot might be wandering around on the Seventh floor whilst Malfoy’s in a dark corner of the library. Goyle’s dot might be in the bathroom whilst Harry watches Malfoy through a tower window, flying around the Quidditch pitch after dark. Goyle’s dot is in the Slytherin dorms and Malfoy’s is in a secluded alcove on the third floor.
“Minerva, thank you for testifying.” Draco says, walking over to greet her properly. She tuts at him.
He whispers. Malfoy complies, but winces as soon as he’s on his feet, dropping back onto Harry’s lap. He shakes his head. Harry puts his fingers on his wand where it’s strapped to his leg. He whispers ‘
Harry holds up his middle finger as he steps back into the booth, slamming the door shut behind him as he crowds in beside Draco.
I can't believe it's over! I remember when the premise came to me and I sort of debated not writing it, but I'm so happy I did:)
“But you could have fancied me and hated me at the same time, right? Maybe you thought I was fit but you still didn’t like me.” Harry suggests. He doesn’t know why he’s talking Draco into the idea.
"Yeah, a while ago. This is the start of the season so I bet it's only the first of many. We just do what we do at the club, mingle and flirt. But here, we could… do stuff. If someone wanted."
“Nope.” Harry says. “Well, I did, not here. But she cried then, too. Bit of a bad time for her to be dating.”
He wonders if Malfoy gets as bothered by the internet telling him he looks like a girl and that's why Harry keeps him around. That his latest photos in a rather cute skirt and yet another bra top were just to entice Harry into fucking him.
“Oh come on, Blaise, he’s going to be taking up with Potter soon enough.” Pansy argues, still toying with Draco’s nipple as he settles back to listen to them talk until they tire themselves out.
“Okay.” Harry finally agrees. “I’ll stop. Ask me for what you want, if you would like more attention or anything, okay?”
Finally, Malfoy’s charms set a strange buzz to the stoat, and its open eyes grow dark, glowing with that same violet charm light.
“There’s a quieter sweet shop in wizarding London we could try some other time. That was too loud.” Harry says as they reach an empty alley.
Malfoy sneers again, not moving. With a laugh, Harry likes the photo and adds a comment about Malfoy’s elaborate photo setups.
“I like to stay here until the sky is dark.” Harry says. “A little darker than this. You can see the stars.”
Harry had Draco pinned to the bed, hands on wrists, but Draco’s legs were free, and he locked them around Harry’s to topple him. He looked surprised as he fell to the floor, but a moment later, Draco was joining him, using his height advantage in his legs to twist Harry into an unbreakable hold.
“No training between now and sundown tomorrow will be of any use. You did good work with Dumbledore’s Army, those who are planning to fight will be ready.”
“Yeah, I mean, I haven’t heard anything, but I assume it’ll be shut down. All the owners will be arrested, no one will be left to keep it running.”
Malfoy repeats disdainfully. He crouches at the base of a tree, murmuring words under his breath as he breaks off bits of the bark and sets them in the basket.
?” Harry asks as they walk, watching Draco’s face. He fiddles with one of his neat black gloves before he answers.
“Well, Ron is correct.” Shannon says warmly. “Draco chose to dispose of the rule regarding glamours.”
“Oh. It’s- it’s okay. I’m a little sore.” Malfoy answers, curling back up again. He looks really confused.
"Yes, that's it. I did some more research after meeting with you both - I should've realised when I read
“Don’t act like you understand this event. You’re going to be shell shocked with high society, and I rather think you’ll hate most of it.”
Draco finally picks something after that, a light linen shirt, nearly all the way unbuttoned with just two done above where it’s tucked neatly into... extremely cute orangish brown short trousers. His feet are bare. The ensemble is breathtakingly adorable.
a ballerina outfit, and the ‘Grandfather Draco’ comments are extremely annoying and off-brand for me.”
“I should’ve said that differently. I need to know some things so I can help you. But you don’t have to answer me if you’re not comfortable with it. Okay?”
“Very little, I’m afraid.” Draco says, wondering if Potter would tell him what spots to see, or where to avoid perhaps.
After a moment, he waves away the boxes and opens instead the garment bags, where a wide variety of dresses are stored.
“I don’t. It’s a baseless assumption. Men are pigs.” He adds offhandedly, and Harry nods in agreement.
“That’s absolutely true, I’ve tried them all and I look stunning.” Malfoy says airily, and Harry snorts.
“Nope.” He says as he chews, but swallows before he speaks again. “Treacle tart. I like it so much, it’s one of my Amortentia smells.”
He comes back out wearing red, a stiff looking dress with sleeves on his arms like they’ve fallen off his shoulders and a large skirt.
"I don't know what you're complaining about, I've gone for much less urgent reasons, Pansy called me over once to paint her toenails."
“I did not like it.” Draco says. “Blaise showed me my room. I don’t want to live there again. It feels… incorrect.”
Potter cooks for a moment without speaking, and Draco watches him with the awe of someone who learned the difference between a pot and a pan at the age of 23.
“Yes you do. Maybe not to everyone but I’m used to your face now and I don’t like it when you do that, when you pretend you’re not feeling a certain way.” Harry says. Draco frowns.
He also gave Draco a shallow dish filled with pumpkin juice, and for dessert, he made a berry tart for himself and Neville, and a little dish of berries with less batter and seasonings for Draco.
Harry laughs, the idea of Draco, who is several inches taller than himself, being told he’s a ‘fairly small’ cat is amusing, to say the least.
The gardens and animal menageries would be available for visits by the public, with occasional live concerts, and there was a brief mention of outdoor painting lessons becoming available if demand was high enough. There were also references to spaces where Blaise had evidently taken archery lessons with Draco as a child, learned to swim in an indoor poolhouse and played what Harry guesses is a wizarding version of tennis.
Harry twisted again, but the greater bulk was too much, and his movement caused Greyback to lash out, knocking the stolen wand from Harry’s hand.
“Because I fingered myself. And you wanted to talk about it.” Draco whispered miserably. Harry shook his head even though Draco wasn’t looking at him.
“Have a seat, Potter.” Narcissa says, her keen eyes moving back and forth between Harry and her son.
With that as an invitation, Potter’s tongue traces the plush part of Draco’s lower lip, then explores further.
“Oh it’s not. But they’d been so poorly treated here that staying longer was just prolonged torment. I haven’t gotten around to hiring a new staff.” He says. Harry guesses he’s probably looked, but no one wants to work for the Malfoy Manor anymore, even if things are different.
“It would be a shame if Perfect Potter turned out to be half-gone over his worst rival.” Malfoy smirks.
Potter wiggles his eyebrows and takes another drink, smacks his lips and leans in close. Draco watches him warily.
He could barely sleep that night. The next day seems to crawl by, Neville asking him a couple times if something’s bothering him.
In retrospect, Harry is quite glad he hadn’t brought them here by portkey, as they would’ve had to leave at a certain time, and when setting the time, Harry would definitely not have anticipated Malfoy running around for as many hours as he has.
Even though Harry’s startled in seeing the long, thin scars crossed over Malfoy’s chest, he doesn’t mention them now. He’ll apologise later.
The handsome man sometimes fucks Draco from behind, and he’ll do nice things, like sucking or licking Draco’s shoulders and neck. Sometimes he holds Draco against his chest, and it’s nice. Comforting.
the same. I was a bit thrown off because you were being too accommodating at first, but it’s a relief to see that you haven’t changed.” He says.
Harry’s marks have improved, for no other reason than him using his homework as a distraction from thinking about… anything.
The first goes in easily, and Draco exhales a sigh. Potter’s fingers are thicker and longer, making them so much more satisfying to have thrust inside him.
“Well he told us yours. I’m Oliver. All your clothes will be on the rack before you’re due to go out, labelled with your name.”
The next time Harry saw Malfoy unaccompanied - several days later - he marched right up to him and grabbed his arm.
“I don’t, no. Having healed that particular burn myself-” He gestures to the recently healed, barely visible mark on Potter’s left pec. “-I hardly think you can blame me.
The rest of the gifts are a mess of chaos, none needing the explanations of Draco’s intricate charms, but just as heartfelt and wonderful.
Draco chances another look out to see the barkeep, apparently called Jack. He’s a very good-looking man. He’s tall and broad in all the right places. Yes, Draco can very much agree to being served by Jack.
going on, and I’m sure he didn’t take that lightly, but… maybe he’s decided he’s sick of being under the Ministry’s thumb and he’s just gone.”
“I know you don’t, and that’s why we have to.” Harry insists, and Draco tilts his head back. Harry notices him blinking quickly like Harry does when he’s trying not to cry. “Draco...”
“Who I didn’t know, he just looked strange and wild at the time.” Draco explains. “Anyway, Potter got done first, and he left, and I didn’t see him again until the train.”
“I did. Now are we going to waste our very limited time more talking about unimportant things or can I brief you?”
“One point to Potter.” Draco acknowledges, pushing up his sleeves. Obviously, Greg is one of Draco’s smells.
He’s not really listening, only catching something here or there as he turns his teaspoon around in his fingers, watching the reflection change as it moves.
“I’m a little proud of myself for having Former Auror, Dragon Tamer, Evil Wizard-Killing Harry Potter at wandpoint.”
Malfoy doesn’t meet Harry’s eyes, only runs his own fingers through his short hair, grasping the ends.
Harry arranges Draco to be curled in his lap, head resting on Harry’s shoulder and still completely covered by the blanket. Draco sighs slightly, leaning into Harry’s warmth.
"Oh, the button he wears. It's a Protean link with this." Fred holds up a knut with a complicated string cage that's knotted around their wrist.
“Mr. Bishop, please-” Ernie Macmillan is trying to get him to shut up. “We currently are not charging you with anything, you’re only a suspect-”
Draco sighs in relief, washing the bite down with the coffee. Oh, he missed Potter’s eggshell coffee.
“Yes. I… I… feel like. Feel… I don’t understand.” Draco pauses for a long moment. “It feels like the one with no name.”
“Yes. Muggle, I think. Muggle pop, probably. Ayla plays a lot of muggle pop. It’s nice.” Draco says without pausing to consider. Harry guesses he already has a list of songs started somewhere. “Jack told me I was very good, you know.”
Harry smiles, putting his other hand higher up on Draco’s arm, pressing more kisses from wrist toward elbow.
It feels like a weird sort of deja vu to be back in Madam Malkin’s after all this time, and particularly considering the company he’s with.
decisions.” Draco says dryly. “But he’s always loved me, and that makes it difficult now. When part of me knows he should be in prison, that
“Several Slytherins, one Ravenclaw.” McGonagall says with pursed lips. “Considering their parents are on the other side, it’s an understandable decision.”
, but it’s not like there are any Time-Turners anymore. And either way, it wouldn’t matter. But you could do something
"When you said Fleetwood's High-Finish Handle Polish," Potter says abruptly, looking suddenly sheepish. "You meant- I mean, it's because you smelled it on me at school, right? Because that's what I used all throughout for Quidditch. I just assumed-"
My goodness, when I was first writing this story I was considering not posting it at all, as I thought it might be too bleak for people to actually read, but I've been pleasantly surprised by the incredible response!
And of course, he's taken Harry on a series of the most spectacularly muggle dates possible. Apparently there are lots of outing ideas in the books he recommends to the ladies’ book club.
“It’s alright. You’ll be okay.” Harry says, taking his hands, which Ron drops happily. “I couldn’t talk them out of it, I’m sorry. But I’ll be here holding you the whole time.”
Their eyes meet, and Malfoy bites his lip, blushing. Harry raises an eyebrow, and Malfoy only blinks as the tips of his ears get very red.
“I don’t know. I tried to talk to him, but they uh.” Malfoy cuts himself off, making a strange motion with his hand.
“I’m not attracted to her but I’m also not repulsed. I don’t have trouble keeping my body interested if she wants me to fuck her or eat her out, particularly if Blaise is showering me with attention in some other way.”
Draco stares his prick in the eye for another moment, then grabs it, trying to get a feel for the size.
to imprison my husband.” Harry says fiercely. “And I think it’s a good time for me to take a holiday.”
Draco’s eyelids droop eventually, and Harry continues until the little o forms on his mouth, and he’s sure Draco’s asleep.
“But she said she felt fine after…” Willows continues, prompting more groans. “So she used a charm to freshen up and we kept going, but er… She didn’t feel fine.”
“Good for you, maybe Malfoy’ll agree to double date as friends, that seems like something he’d do with the Slytherins.”
Snape’s spells cut through the Death Eaters mercilessly, McGonagall beside him at the foot of the bridge sending blasts forward whilst discreetly directing Seamus with a hand behind her back.
hot as fuck.” He says, and Draco hides his smile in the pillow. He hears the bottle click open again, and jumps when Harry’s hand brushes one cheek. “Sorry. Going in now.” He says, and Draco rolls his eyes.
One hand is fisted in the sheets, the other is near his face. There’s a slurping noise as he takes his fingers from his mouth.
‘I won’t hurt him.’ Harry argued. He blinked his eyes open, forcing the peaceful sensation to the back of his mind.
“So you’re not…” Harry gestures. Malfoy waits him out. “It’s not an identity thing, it’s only practical. A disguise. A character you play.”
"You! Fucking! Prick!" Harry shouts, punctuating each word with a hit to Malfoy's torso. "You absolute
A quick pat down confirms this, and Harry looks back to see Draco’s wand sitting on the corner table behind them. A silent Accio brings it to himself, and he tucks it inside his clothes so they can’t take it.
“What do you suppose the Durmstrangs see in him?” Harry asks Ron one day, pretending he isn’t watching Malfoy and the Bulgarian from across the library.
“I hardly think that’s true,” Harry says mildly. “We spoke with so many people, addressed their concerns.”
“I’ll criticise all your shoes, you’ve got no taste.” Malfoy says disdainfully. “Lucky for you, I have excellent taste.”
Hermione tells him that all the Weasleys survived - even Percy, who’d saved Fred’s life from the killing curse and denounced the Ministry in the same breath.
“Would you- could you show me how to do that?” Harry asks hesitantly. “It’s just- some of the others on my team plait their hair back so it’s not in their eyes. Mine’s so unruly, thought I’d give it a shot.”
“I don’t really.” Draco says. “But I also told you that my friends do. It causes a bit of a stir when a Pureblood man takes his wife’s last name, even now. Particularly when said wife is muggleborn without a well-established surname.”
“I don’t think it would work.” Draco says thoughtfully. “The glamoured nipples don’t really exist, so I don’t think real piercings would stay in. I suppose I could just add piercings to the glamours, though.”
When Draco returns to Harry’s side, he’s got tears streaming down his face. He hugs Harry wordlessly.
“I can handle myself, but thank you for the offer.” Draco says, giving Potter a genuine smile. “And I do think I should be going before I fall asleep mid-Apparition.”
Like before, Draco Disapparates once he’s calmed down a bit, although he isn’t gone nearly as long before he walks back up the stairs wearing different trousers.
"Draco- how could I know that you're lying? I can almost never tell when you lie." Harry asks desperately.
“One of the gifts I bought you that hasn’t arrived yet is some kind of lotion. It’s for your skin, so the hot water doesn’t make it dry.” Harry has noticed whenever he touches Draco, his hands come away with little flakes of skin, likely due to his scalding hot, hour-long showers every day.
Potter laughs, shifting to lay down beside Draco, tugging Draco’s head to rest on his chest. Potter presses a kiss to Draco’s hair.
, so Harry puts his wand into the hand around Malfoy’s waist and uses magic to send ripples through Malfoy’s aura.
“Merlin, it’s good to see you, how long has it been, seven? Eight years?” He asks her, positioning himself so the man has to take a step back.
While Draco still doesn’t really talk much, he can manage a question here and there as Mr. Weasley tells him about more of the things he’s enchanted or otherwise encountered.
As they’re lounging in a shallow spot, watching the two hunks wrestle a bit off, Crane opens up to Draco about Ashe, and Draco tells him a few tricks to win her affections if she isn’t already interested.
Draco still hasn’t started eating again. After a moment, he takes out his notebook again and writes.
“Well, you did show up at my flat in a very creepy and mysterious way just to have me bring you back home, where you took me into the forest to show me a cool new way to interact with my magic whilst you do what, collect some more beetles?”
“I thought it might make up for the ‘Potter Stinks’ badges in Fourth Year.” Harry teases, laughing more when Malfoy shoots him an unimpressed look.
“Everyone lost people in the war. One loss is considered lucky. You’re incredibly lucky to have lived yourself, lucky to be here and lucky to have escaped Azkaban. You should thank us for saving you.”
“Tell me this feels casual to you.” Potter murmurs, setting his forehead against Draco’s. “Because it doesn’t feel casual at all to me.”
Draco arrives last to breakfast, feeling generally rushed and out of sorts. Sadly, when he sits at the table, he realises that Potter’s not there.
“So you’ll dress up like a female superhero in a comic from the 60’s, what’s your outfit going to be?”
“The rain’s stopped.” Harry whispered, and Draco realized with a start that indeed, it had. He still didn’t move to release Harry. Harry continues, seeming like he’s just now realised something. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t wrestle you-”
“I should be going, we’ve got end of day chores to finish.” Potter says, standing. “I should warn you, I am injured often and I will not stand for sloppy healing.”
“Oh come on, you’ve taken this one before.” Potter coos, setting it aside to grab the lube from the bed.
“I think you’d like talking to Mr. Weasley, Ron’s dad. He also thinks muggle things are very interesting.”
“Oh. Well, no reason, really.” Harry says. “I just found out he’s made peace with all my friends from school and they never mentioned him, and he’s never mentioned them since he started teaching.”
Ron and Harry are working in the common room, but Hermione is there too, and Draco doesn’t even stop walking to say, in his most casual voice, “Hermione, a word.” before leaving into the halls. He ignores the rest of the students scattered about.
He gives just as good as he gets, too. Harry’s wardrobe has been tailored to fit him properly, though Draco initially wanted to just replace everything altogether.
Harry putters about the yard for a bit after he leaves Draco in the study. It’s not as fun alone, but as he approaches the harp cottage, Peppy Apparates beside him with a soft crack.
“You were right, I can’t fit everything I wanted to bring into my trunk.” Malfoy says as he moves around the flat, picking things up, staring at them for a moment and then putting them back down again, likely deciding there’s not enough room.
“Hey Harry, what was the high five for earlier?” He asks with a grin. Harry guesses he has a good idea of what it was for already, and just rolls his eyes.

“Oh, it’s just you.” He says, setting his invisibility cloak and wand aside. “What are you doing here? It’s past 2.”
The macabre silhouette of the rows of identical wooden boxes hung heavy over anyone in sight of the courtyard.
“Blaise helped me find this house and buy it, helped me pick out the paint and furniture colours, went to buy the furniture - the furniture shop was very busy and I did not like it, and he set up the rooms. Everyone has done something, they want you to have a lovely home too.”
The libraries were to remain intact and opened to the public - the rarer books would be moved to the smallest library, where they’d be treated as museum pieces accessible only to professionals. The other books would be available to be read and purchased.
lightshow in town, we saw that one evening.” Drake adds through a yawn. “Mostly uneventful, though.”
“The Unspeakable Department does not use identities. They glamour over every applicant and take them for who they are, not name, not family, not background. They’re only given a binary report of criminal record.”
“I have a lot more information than you have, Harry. I need to share it before we can go.” Malfoy says. Harry frowns at the use of his proper name.
“Did you know that if you slam your head against stone hard enough, you can crack your skull? And you’ll only be picked up, put back together and left where your blood stains still haven’t washed away. No potions mixer in the country will sell anesthetics to Azkaban. You feel
“The drawing. I just remembered, I signed it before I sent it to you. In the corner. DM.” Draco says, sounding shocked.
Blaise nods at him with a warm smile, and the potatoes-bearer sets the dish down with a bit of a clunk before running back into the kitchen.
Pansy and Blaise descend upon him, plying him with beverages and pulling him into a chair nearby to talk him down from his ire.
“Doesn’t help me if I don’t know what that is!” Harry calls after him as Malfoy leaves out the front door.
“I need to know exactly what happened in Madam Malkin’s.” Willows interrupts. “Who said what and why and when?”
“Whatever. I’m just going to find him and drag him to the library for a cuddle. It’s easy enough.” Harry says, sitting up and adjusting his newest jumper from Ron’s mum.
Besides, he’s a touch distracted by Malfoy’s plump little arse and the dimples above it that sparkle with the piercings that have long since finished healing.
For a brief moment, Harry’s heart pounds as Draco darts off, but he gets a sinking feeling when Draco turns for the stairs instead of the kitchen.
“But if you want to talk to him, we’re moving him to interrogation at two. You can come to the Ministry then and mention me at the front desk, I’ll bring you to him.”
At 9p, Harry kicks the door open and they cast stunning spells on all the room’s inhabitants efficiently, Malfoy blocking a burst of red light in front of Harry with an especially strong nonverbal Protego Duo. He’s always been good at those, and Harry has a sinking suspicion why.
“Sorry sir, Asher is occupied for the rest of the evening. I can arrange for a private session tomorrow, or a different dancer tonight.”
Draco stands, knowing he’s absolutely going to regret tonight's hubris when he’s trying to lift his arms above his waist tomorrow.
The double doors lead to a sort of sitting room lined with bookshelves and windows. There’s a small wet bar in a corner with a sink and what looks like an icebox. The ceiling is painted like a cloudy sky and lets a faint glow even with the lamps off.
When Harry wakes up, Draco is already sitting against the headboard, frowning at his wand in concentration as he twirls it between his fingers.
“Of course they do, that’s why it’s not in his name. It’s in Leo’s name.” A short man explains, running his eyes up and down Draco.
"Er, hi?" Harry clears his throat, looking around and wondering if there's a bell to ring somewhere that he's not seeing.
Harry manages to find Teddy later that afternoon, but he was unfortunately - or fortunately, depending on how you looked at things - walking from the library with Olivia.
Terry Boot. His name surprised Harry, he didn’t really have any friends in common, and he hadn’t heard him mentioned. Several Ravenclaws were present at his coffin, murmuring too quietly to be heard. One looked up and saw Harry, giving him the weakest, most watery smile. It barely lasted a single second.
They move to a drawing room, where Lucius attempts to isolate Draco onto one sofa and Harry into a chair, but backs off at Draco’s glare.
Feeling… well, Harry can’t quite explain it. He’s certain Goyle’s looking for Malfoy but when he wasn’t there, Goyle’s empty expression somehow seems more lost.
“What about you? How would you like to try a high heel on?” He asks, a note of teasing to his voice that Harry could use to just laugh off the question if he was uncomfortable. A mercy, really, but Malfoy is finally opening up to Harry, so he agrees.
“I’ll be right by your side the whole time.” Harry says gently, bending for a kiss. Draco’s hand untenses in Harry’s.
Harry can only imagine how awful it would be if Malfoy got back to school and started taunting Harry like this in the halls.
Draco eats everything, although Harry hadn’t served him as much in hopes that it would actually stay down.
Malfoy, he’d healed up alright. Hadn’t even considered that Malfoy was already in tears when he’d found him, that
“Because Harry Potter helps me.” Draco shrugs. “Even if he never liked me. He wouldn’t leave me to be hurt. Harry Potter is good. I always knew that.”
“Don’t tell anyone that, trust me. When you get your drink, take a sip straight away, don’t smell it. Either lean on the bar or don’t, keep your hands off otherwise.”
“Materials.” Malfoy says vaguely, then returns to his soft murmurs and breaking more bark from the tree.
Draco had suggested they play this American muggle game, Monopoly. Harry had heard of it, but evidently Draco had read about it somewhere and ordered the game for himself. He was excited to play against Harry as he said the elves were not very good at it, never buying properties and constantly getting stuck in jail somehow.
“You-” He says shortly, flushing. “And Knox. Right after I was hired, I didn’t know she was dating Drake, and I just thought she was really cool-”
“I can see why.” Harry says with a watery laugh. “You did this? The garden charms, and- and the stove in the corner of the kitchen-”
“I don’t mind. It’s nice to have my own hot water bottle to keep warm all night.” He says, and Harry huffs.
“The way you felt today was like you felt after too much shopping.” Harry guesses. Draco nods. “Overwhelmed.” Harry guesses again. Another nod.
All just one happy group of two dozen of their most favourites who all happened to be in the area at once - even Charlie, Bill and Fleur.
It is nice that he isn’t quite that small, though, as he’s hard enough to keep track of being person-sized.
Malfoy eats the dessert quickly, draining two more glasses of wine and lisping anytime he has to speak.
“Whatcha doin?” Harry asks over his shoulder. Malfoy ignores him, but comes out wearing different clothes a minute later, now in sort of a leotard with strategic cutouts on the chest and hips and a fluffy, see-through white skirt. Harry snorts. “Cute.”
, I only used lube to wank, not finger myself!” Malfoy says quickly, clinging to Harry’s arm as Harry tries dislodging him.
Meredith/Malfoy explains that she? has found out about a deal going on in a back room at precisely 9 which they can storm and arrest at least some of the party.
Hermione writes ‘Ron Weasley’ on the top, then looks back at Draco. He takes the page and tucks it back into the pocket, closing the book.
“What if-” Harry frowns. This is not a possibility he wants to think about. “What if we lose Fred that way? By him leaving this body too?”
The back is open, nothing but a criss cross of skinny straps down until the lowest portion of his back, where the fabric is fitted snug over his arse.
“If I’d thought you posed an actual threat to me, I would’ve Expelliarmus’d your arse from twenty feet behind you.”
Wow I was so thrilled with the response to last chapter, you guys are all so quick to pick up on the little hints sprinkled throughout. Thanks to everyone who commented, I hope this chapter starts to unravel some more ~secrets~ as we figure out what exactly is going on:)
“I did not want to live at all, before. I wanted anything to make it go away.” Draco says quietly. “But I want to live now.”
“That’s right, you put on glamours.” Harry recalls. “But you don’t know why someone pointed it out?”
“I know you’ve got a Saviour complex and all, but I doubt you’d do that for anyone you didn’t fancy a little bit.”
. I… their touch burned my skin. I didn’t want it. The water burned more, and I could stop feeling their touch when I felt the water.”
The prospect of a Quidditch-less year makes Harry wish for the good old days when his worst problem was that Dementors were infiltrating the grounds.
“Sorry I was short with you earlier, I was preoccupied.” Harry explains, not really sure why he needs to justify himself to his cat. Draco meows, but doesn’t look at him. “You know you’re not supposed to be on the counter, but I’ll give you a pass since I was cross.”
Potter’s eyes fall to the table, and Draco watches him think. Ashe and Knox exchange a confused glance.
“Well, now I feel pretty good about myself. I was fucking a girl in the back of my car in high school, in a mall parking lot. And the mall security came up and told us to leave.”
“I- After a bit, I started… I dunno, pampering Draco a bit. With bubble baths, or… yeah, waffles, cooking more… I always say I’m just spoiling him… but it’s only an excuse because
"Fuck, I'm going to regret saying this." Harry groans. Malfoy perks up, turning in his chair entirely to listen. "Yeah, I think you're alright. I'd go so far as to say I've stopped disliking you."
Malfoy is very noisily moving things around in the bedroom when Harry’s done cooking. When he spots Harry through the open door, he reemerges wearing the collar still, but now some shorts that do
“Well that’s not much better, since he gave him to you to dispose of.” Draco sniffs. “Anyway, that’s hardly one of my more egregious offenses, and I was punished for it too.”
“Shockingly, we’re here for him and not me. He’ll need a full diagnostic if you don’t mind.” Harry says.
"I don't see why it matters - they come back because they know I'll be here. They want to see me, they don't care that it's my job, and no one knows who I really am anyway." Draco argues. "You wanted me to bring more business and now you're angry when I've done it."
“No.” Harry says confidently. “No, you were mean and you didn’t make the best decisions, but when it came down to it, you weren’t evil. You never killed anyone.”
When the bar closes, he's not drunk. He feels as if he's been drinking pumpkin juice all night. It's much better.
“Yeah, really smart. Some other time, I can tell you about why I still think you’re smart, even though it’s a different kind of smart than you used to be. Or, maybe it isn’t. You’re clever, trying to get the best end of the deal, aren’t you?”
“First game we’re playing is called Paranoia. As usual, your being here opts you into the game, no exceptions. If you would all take a spot in the sitting room, we’ll begin.”
As Malfoy shifts, Harry's pinky grazes something that's not flesh, and realizes after a confused grope that Malfoy has more piercings on his stomach.
Draco twists to see an irritated man several inches taller and much older glaring at him. He’s naked.
“Would you mind undressing for me now?” Marion asks. It’s as gentle as Harry’s ever heard her, and he’s almost proud that she’s being nice.
Harry stopped listening to the conversation when the pole slightly off to the side from their table switched operators.
“Well, if you don’t mind, tell that to the rest of the employees here.” Draco said bitterly, too tired and frustrated to keep it to himself. Mrs. Devoe frowned.
That first time Malfoy was in Harry’s bed, when he’d let Harry see his hard cock… why had Harry covered him back up instead of sliding down and putting his mouth on it?
Inside, Draco is writing very quickly. Reference books and various pages hover in the air around him, he has a mug of coffee half-raised to his lips, and there’s ink in spots on his face where he’s smeared it from his fingers.
“I dunno how you’re going to wiggle out of that one.” Willows says from where he’s sitting beside Potter and now Draco.
“Tell them I lied, I’ll tell them you lied.” He murmurs, and Draco smiles wider than strictly necessary.
“When Pansy and Blaise got married, it became quite clear that they’re not going to fall in love, even though they do love each other very much. Pansy suggested opening their marriage to share their bed with others, such as me, and Blaise agreed.”
Harry has to admit, he does feel very luxurious in them, and from the way he’s touching his sleeves, Draco feels the same.
“Do whatever you like. I’ve a study with books if you still like reading. Just don’t go anywhere, the house should protect you as long as you’re inside.”
"Potter told me… months ago, he said I'm probably the only one here who's never killed anyone. Which… I suppose I haven't. Not directly at least."
It was a bit of a drive, especially since Malfoy probably wouldn’t like sitting all that much, but Harry hoped it would be worth it.
“I already asked her, she said she’s happy to teach you.” Harry says. “You’ll like her, she’s very smart and quiet. Sort of reminds me of Luna.”
She covers him with a light, pilled hospital blanket and closes his eyelids gently. Harry keeps talking.
Draco ends up agreeing to sit in a new room, one with a large open window where the sun streams through. His pale skin glows in the light.
The Prince’s handsome, tired face lights up when Draco walks through the doors, his silken attire flowing behind him, bare feet making no noise on the spotless marble floors.
Harry presses a kiss to Draco’s shoulder, ignoring the glares from the leaders. Draco releases a breath.
“So no, you don’t.” Malfoy smirks, dropping Harry’s shirt hem. “Well, when your metabolism catches up with you, you’ll have to.”
Though it’s incredibly annoying when Malfoy is cocky, he’s somehow worse when he’s sulking about, so Harry rolls his eyes and leaves him to gloat.
“Merlin, I didn’t think I’d see this again. Hagrid rode this to bring me out of Godric’s Hollow to Dumbledore when I was a baby, then again later during the war.” Harry says, stepping forward to touch it. “Sirius used to ride around with my dad, getting into trouble.” Harry laughs, his eyes welling up.
“Well, the staff wanted nothing to do with us. But the patrons who called said that a blond, half naked stripper was being taken off by a man with long black hair who exclusively used Stupefy and Expelliarmus. There was quite a fight between these two and the club staff, it seems.” Ron explains, his arms crossed.
“I have a portkey, I’ll go round up Malfoy and make sure it’s all clear first.” Harry says. “Meet you there.”
“Your father had failed in getting something for him, so Voldemort took his wand and said that it was your job to make up for his mistake. You were sixteen, it was beyond unfair, but Voldemort was very evil and incredibly cruel.”
“I think he wants to know how you silenced him.” Ron says smugly, standing rather protectively by Draco’s non-Harry side as Smith glowers at both of them.
his father, and Draco could finally, triumphantly say he’d befriended Harry Potter. He would love to see the exasperation on that fondly amused face.
“Might I suggest overturning a feed barrel?” Potter says, gesturing to a large metal drum with a lid half on and half off.
Though they didn’t have any visuals like the muggle police often use, the aurors had the audio of what was happening, even if only three people could hear it.
“Oh don’t worry. I was only asking if you’d done the work for Slughorn. I’ve been having a bit of trouble with mine.” Harry explained. Draco looked over.
“Huh.” Harry says. He turns the bird around and blows on it the same way Draco had, but nothing happens.
“I don’t know how you would’ve broken the charm, Potter. It did more than stopping the effects of it, it broke the bewitchment entirely. Finite Incantatum doesn’t unenchant things.”
Draco sticks around after the games end with the excuse of helping Inkwood and Ashe tidy up, but more because Potter’s also there, and Draco’s not quite ready to stop looking at him shirtless
Harry nearly jumps as cool fabric lays over his body, and he strongly hopes Pansy Parkinson doesn’t trot off to the Prophet with the tell-all tale of Harry Potter’s backside.
Harry, Ron and Neville were sandwiched together in the corner of the booth surrounded by a few familiar faces from Hogwarts, but lots of Dean’s other friends since leaving school.
Draco lays himself out again like before, and Harry follows the pattern from Thursday, starting with hands, moving upwards to his chest and head, then down the rest of his body.
Malfoy shows them through a gate and up a path that isn’t nearly as worn as the rest of the Manor paths, which makes Harry wonder how long the gate had been there. There’s a hidden door on the side of the house, and they slip inside quietly.
He hadn’t tested his shields with the stronger dose, but he’d need them up all the time to prevent responding immediately, it seems.
“No, actually I knew pretty quickly that you wanted to shag me.” Potter says. “I've gotten good at reading the signs. You've been fixated on my arms for months, and even before that, I noticed you’d look at me a lot, in a different way than you did in school.”
Harry’s body relaxes when he sees Draco sitting at his usual place, looking at him curiously, between Luna and Hermione, with Neville sitting across him. He runs over.
“Harry Potter, how lovely to see you here. Would you care to dance?” She asks, her low, smooth voice catching his attention. Her accent is even more posh than Malfoy’s, somehow.
“I do not consent to be touched by you.” Draco says, glaring at her shoulder pressed into his arm. She takes a hasty step back.
Drake proceeds to lick at the strawberry and suck at it rather relentlessly, and Draco bites his lip to keep from laughing at the intensity of their eye contact.
Someone (probably Knox) casts refreshing charms over both of them, and Draco suppresses his disappointment that Potter’s back to normal again.
“Well, you did say he’s older, so probably two.” Draco says flatly. Millie smacks him in the arm, snorting.
Harry will leave the financials to him and Hermione to figure out. Though it would take time for Draco to get an understanding of what he has between his two family fortunes, Harry knows that he’ll be much smarter about how to use the money.
Harry mutters about hosts and prats under his breath as he pulls out his wand and Summons both the bottle and a glass to himself.
“So then, how do you decide when you’ve done a night’s worth of snogging?” Potter persists, leaning his head back against the sofa to look up into Draco’s face.
“So you just… befriended Ron and Neville? What about Hermione? And asked them to not mention that they’d seen you?”
“I’ll have you know, that was a fantastic bit of magic I did at fourteen. And that was five years ago.”
“Let’s keep that one. Once the case about the club is closed, then I think you’ll be safe to leave the house alone. Until then, Blaise, me, any of the Weasleys, Neville or Marion can be out with you to keep you safe.”
spot again and he’s groaning, alternating pushing back against Harry’s fingers and digging his hips into the pillow.
well with magic.” Malfoy says. “So the second you brought a computing-sensing thing onto a property entirely surrounded by enchantments, not to mention gifting him to a magical Bei- I mean, Beast, that thing started to become a thinking, functioning item.”
Potter’s holding onto the desk becomes obvious when he moves his hand and each thrust shoves the desk backward. Draco, despite already having come, feels his body work itself up over Potter’s strength.
“I know.” Draco slides off the bench to wrap himself around Harry. Harry holds him, pressing his face into Draco’s neck.
“Yeah. I’m pretty sure.” Harry says, pressing a quick kiss to Draco’s mouth before pushing him into the floo.
“He can come by anytime?” Harry asks. He remembers Draco’s rule with Mrs. Weasley because of an unfortunately constructed sentence.
The Twins study noisily, tapping rhythms on the table or their legs, thumbing through the pages of another absently while reading the one in front of them. In time, Harry discovers that George is much louder, and anytime Fred is using the body, it’s mostly still aside from incessant foot-tapping.
Harry can’t tear his eyes away as Malfoy lowers his hand, arching his back as the unmistakable wet noises fill the room.
From what Harry’s seen, he’s not supposed to use it at all. Maybe Jack told Draco not to use it unless he needs to. Harry wonders if he’d be able to get an answer out of Jack if he went back there.
“Technically, neither am I, but since you’re dating me, you’re part of the clan and must abide by its rules.”
“Take your pants off.” He says, but Draco knows better, so he just shifts them to the side a bit, and sinks down on Harry’s cock.
“I’m a man of many talents, singing is just the beginning.” Malfoy says. “What about you, do you sing?”
He’s back in his own body again, tits gone. The dress has also been adjusted to hang fitted against his chest. Harry sighs, running his eyes over Malfoy’s figure.
In truth, Harry had determined Malfoy most closely matched the description of a Heather Pixie, both in physical description and in demeanor. Therefore, if there’s a place where Malfoy will feel comfortable and happy, it should be the moors.
Harry arrives at the club as soon as it opens, taking a spot at the bar until 7. He barely drinks anything stronger than soda water, although one shot of firewhisky calms his nerves slightly.
He unbuttons his robes, taking off the outer layers and revealing his jeans and tshirt beneath the formalwear, pulling a denim jacket and his own worn trainers from the robe pockets.
“Green.” Draco says after a moment’s consideration. Harry nods, starting the bath water. Once it’s running hot, he plugs the drain and pours some of the green bubble bath into the stream.
Harry finds him sitting at the kitchen table downstairs, looking at a thick envelope with his name on it.
“Hand?” Harry prompts, holding his own out. It’s as much for Malfoy’s comfort as it is practical, so Harry can feel the skin shift as the polyjuice wears off.
“I wasn’t, that honour went to a lady who they found at a bar and haven’t seen since. They didn’t want to invite someone they knew unless they’d already established together that it wouldn’t complicate things between them.
He stayed in his seat, wondering at what point he should go searching for Draco to apologise for taking liberties.
“I’m sure I will, you don’t need to tell me that. I’ve been your partner for months now, and if you’re sort of a mellowed out high-society pureblood, I’m not particularly looking forward to meeting the uptight ones.”
They laughed breathlessly as they wrestled, Harry managing to tip them onto their sides, but Draco was still pinning Harry’s legs to stay where they were, and Harry had to use one of his arms to hold himself up off Draco’s chest, which left him with only one to defend himself.
“I very much enjoyed it, thanks.” Draco says, though he’s not bothered by her question like he thought he might’ve been.
Draco hums again, putting his bee-laden finger near the flower again to coax the bee back onto the plant.
“Maybe some standards would be a good idea.” Harry laughs. “Anyway, what does this have to do with Teddy being a menace?”
"We needed a place to store it while we work things out. I'm beginning to think you don't know the first thing about George and Fred."
The day ended with eggnog and hot chocolate all around, everyone lounged on sofas and chairs and cushions on the floor, sleepy from everything they'd eaten.
“It’s the Malfoy crest signet ring. That’s the one my grandfather wore, and his father wore the one my dad’s wearing. Same with the one my mother’s got on.” Draco explains. “They only work if there’s only two living, of-age Malfoy men.”
Draco was still in the study when Harry got to their bedroom, so he got ready alone and sat against the headboard to (pretend to) read until Draco came.
Malfoy is sort of curled up on top of one of Harry’s legs, rather like he was impersonating a frog with his knees bent, arse up. Harry’s hands had found his hips, and Malfoy was drooling a bit onto Harry’s shoulder.
“I see why you’re unsure if he’s flirting.” Pansy acknowledges. “Aren’t you glad we’re all so blunt with each other and you don’t have to guess?”
.” Lucius says, softer, one hand moving toward Malfoy’s shoulder. Malfoy flinches away, crossing his arms.
“Well maybe not all is lost. I had a thought. But it might be tricky since we’d have to get Draco to work with us.”
“He said to always assume you’re nearby anytime I’m thinking about misbehaving, because you’ve got an invisibility cloak and you’re very sneaky.”
"I've been researching. I believe it, like Dementors, separates soul from body. But unlike Dementors, it's fast, tearing the two apart. A Kissed person never lives long without the soul, but an Avada Kadavra'd body doesn't have that adjustment period to gradually slow down. So the body just stops right away."
The second one hurts less, as he knows what to expect, so Harry is able to keep even more still and Malfoy puts away his camera with a disappointed noise.
“Austrian roses, here, the red ones. The big white ones are chrysanthemums, and the small white are lemon blossoms. Smell them, they’re very fragrant.”
“Right. I suppose he hasn’t told you much about school, then?” Zabini asks with a look thrown at Harry.
"What is it about this that you get off on?" Harry asks, lulling Malfoy into that funny state he slips into when Harry does things.
tasteless, Malfoy calls it), and the auror department was tipped off. Malfoy and Harry are to be present to observe the dealings and make the arrests.
“You doing alright, pet?” Harry asks, stroking his hair. Draco whines, looking up at Harry with those lovely grey eyes.
“Yeah…” Harry says, scratching the back of his neck. “But that was a bit weird, wasn’t it? I mean I kept thinking…
On a whim, Harry spends the rest of his time waiting by perusing a muggle catalogue he’d received on accident. He’s thrilled Draco has found something to enjoy, sure it will help his recovery. He finds the page with bathroom things.
"My relatives put bars on my window and bolted the door so I couldn't leave the room for the summer." Harry says, unsure why he's telling Malfoy of all people this.
Draco shrugs, deciding not to mention anything of consequence to Potter ever, because the prat doesn’t take comments at face value and it’s dangerous for him to be thinking about what Draco might be saying to his friends about Potter. That’s certainly a road that ends in embarrassment for Draco.
“Huh.” Potter says blankly. “Well actually, I barely remember anything from the transaction itself, because we got caught.”
When Draco arrived in the Zabinis bedroom, Blaise was leaning against the wall, fumbling with his belt buckle. Draco rolled his eyes and went to help him with it. Blaise grinned groggily with a wiggle of his eyebrows.
“Oh shut up, I'm here for our date.” Malfoy says dryly, tucking the little pink rose into Harry’s coat buttonhole.
“Something else, then. Would you like me to give you more options, or would you like to suggest something yourself?”
“My cards are on the table. If he wants something, he knows where I stand. Until then, I told him I’d keep it to myself.”
Squeezing his small eyes shut and swiping hastily at a tear that leaks out, Goyle takes a few steps backward.
Just wait till you guys read the next chapter- also long and 80% sex (not Harry/Draco yet, sorry, but absolutely splendid anyway)
“I don’t know, Potter, I’ve never done this, remember?” Draco huffs, embarrassed. Harry shakes his head.
“Mm, you couldn’t wait to see for yourself?” Harry asks, leaning his elbows on the top of Draco’s chair.
“I’m not going without you, Draco.” Harry says firmly. “If you really can’t do this, we’ll go home, and I’ll tell Molly I got sick. But I really wish you’d stay.”
"Ooh!" Pansy squeals and snatches a notebook from the coffee table. "I know I'm supposed to wait to pitch it in the formal meetings, but I have my next book premise."
“Hm. Well, there’s a bunch of games, everyone gets pretty tipsy, and if you show up, nothing is optional.”
“Nope.” Harry says, moving to sit on the sink instead of getting into the bath as he’d planned. “What are you doing?”
“It looks like you have stars on your scarf.” Draco says when she lets his hand go. Jeanette’s fingers reach for her hijab like she didn’t remember which one she was wearing.
Greg wouldn't care, but Draco doesn't want to plant the idea that he's become sloppy out here on his own.
Draco almost screams when Potter’s voice comes from behind him, and he spins, pressing his back against the wall, eyes darting between Potter, Greg and Pansy. Panting, trembling.
“Just bored now, I suppose. I was going to have a look around the property and see what else is out here, Draco is always showing me new things I’ve missed.”
“Don’t say that! Draco, don’t!” He says, crawling between Draco’s legs. Draco glances down, almost amused to see Harry begging him from between his legs.
The first thing Harry notices is the funny watery colours. Everything looks washed out and a little blurry. There’s a sort of fog or mist coming in from the corners, but if he focuses on what he’s watching, it seems normal enough.
“Do you use this?” He asks Harry as he opens the door. Harry isn’t used to Draco hearing him come, and he’s startled for once instead of Draco.
Deciding that whatever Harry smells in Amortentia can very much go fuck itself, he closes his eyes and tries to sleep.
“No, I wouldn’t let her if she tried.” Ron grins. “But it’ll relieve some stress for her if dinner’s ready by the time she gets home.”
“Fine, go ahead.” He says, turning the plate so the scrambled eggs are in front of Draco’s nose. “Don’t eat the sausage, I don’t think it’ll be good for you.”
Though Greg arranged things a bit, it was mostly a giant pillow nest by the time they all piled into it.
Harry takes his hands, but doesn’t stroke the backs, and Draco notices, staring at them like he’s waiting for the reassurance.
Briefly, Harry thinks he might acknowledge the room, but he’s only looking up to check something in one of the floating books, and he uses the quill to scratch the side of his head, leaving ink stains in his hair.
Harry has to stand up to pull his wand from his back pocket, buried beneath his layers of jackets. Draco watches with no small amount of curiosity.
“I especially love a little virgin baby. One I can make messy, just like you. My messy little baby. Look at your tiny cock, drooling all over your little tummy.”
Ron heads back downstairs while Harry helps Draco into a pair of joggers and tucks his red blanket around his shoulders.
When he arrives back at the flat, Malfoy’s up and lounging on his stomach on the sofa. Harry tosses the bag aside and smacks Malfoy’s arse. Malfoy yelps.
“That’s okay. It may have been because of one of the STDs, sometimes they can make your skin itch. Marion didn’t tell us what kind you had.”
Then, they’re alone in the room, the door still closed, warded against interruptions and soundproofed.
“I’m not convinced that he doesn’t have some record of the raid. He writes everything down as soon as he can so if he doesn’t remember, he can read about it. I remember the morning after the raid, he’d already written in his notebook. He showed me - it was unrelated but if he wrote that-”
Draco’s call summons Peppy into the bathroom directly, and she doesn’t look very surprised about it.
“No you didn’t. However, as it was me who you believe to have been cursed, and as an auror working for the Ministry, I’m within my rights to speak freely.” Harry says. Robards surrenders the floor.
“Dunno.” Harry shrugs. “It’s nice out, I like driving on days like this. And you’re always working so much, can you use a break?”
“I’m sorry.” Draco sniffles a bit, then looks up with a semi-composed face. Harry regrets what he said.
Crane is dared to kiss Ashe for a full minute, which he accepts a little too quickly and pulls away from blushing heartily.
“Ah, I was looking for Harry. He wasn’t in his room. Hermione said I might find him here.” Ron stammered, glancing behind Draco to where Harry stood on the other side of the bed.
“Alright, you’re free to go home. I recommend a bath, if you don’t mind Harry supervising just to make sure you’re safe, and get some sleep if you can. I’m sending you with two potions, they’ll replenish your electrolytes, as I’m sure vomiting this much has really worn you down. Drink as much water as you can.”
my god-” He pants, his eyes almost shutting automatically at the feeling, but he forces them to stay open to see the sinful bounce to Draco’s arse with each time he lands on Harry’s hips.
Immediately, the living gnomes start popping up from everywhere, and following the statue gnome as if in a trance. Draco murmurs a few things under his breath, pointing his wand around the edges of the garden, where the little statue marches.
“So… according to theories in the book, anyway, your wings are purple so you blend in more, though I’m not sure why the rest of you isn’t purple too. And your vision is purple because all the heather is too, so your eyes will spot anything that
“Okay. Um. What did you mean when you said you know some of my rules? What do you think my rules are?”
“Okay.” Draco says from over his shoulder. It’s sort of funny to see Draco hug someone his own height.
“Okay, one, my mum is dead, and two, you’re super, super gay, so. You get, like, a 1/10 for that one.” Harry says.
"Is it part of the appeal - feeling my magic when we're with other people?" Harry asks curiously, and Malfoy starts squirming, slightly more aware until Harry’s thumb shifts a bit higher and he melts bonelessly into Harry’s chest again.
Harry deliberately reaches out, watching Draco hesitantly put his hand in Harry’s, and Harry strokes across his knuckles. The tension in Draco’s stomach eases.
“Seriously? Dare.” Draco says, knowing Potter could fairly easily word a question to make Draco talk about sex.
“Yes. Back… when I first started, I was brought to patrons for full services. I have no memories of… of anything inside their houses.” Draco frowns, rubbing his head with his free hand. “Not for a while. I haven’t gone anywhere for a while. But I might not remember if I had.”
Harry pays with his money this time, though Draco looks so frightened and out of it, Harry’s not sure he would’ve realised it was time to get money out anyway.
“So it’s not that you like being tickled necessarily, but you like being touched and tickling is alright?” Harry asks.
“Now we go find our friends and congratulate them.” Neville says, tugging Harry along to the curtains separating the backstage from the rest of the room.
Draco smiles broadly, moving to kiss Harry but unable to rid himself of the smile and instead tucking himself against Harry’s chest with a giggle.
Draco smiles as the Prince takes his seat, then Draco drapes himself on top, one leg on the floor between the Prince’s, the other extending across his lap.
“You’re like a squirrel.” Harry says as he watches. “You know how squirrels collect a bunch of nuts and bury them?”
He watched as Malfoy showed off his body for the eager audience, touching here and there as he moved about the floor in an almost sleepy way. The Malfoy he’d known was far more feline in his grace.
“I didn’t want you to be concerned for my health.” Draco says softly. “After all, I’ve recovered now- well, I
“Hm.” Potter says, mockingly thoughtful. “I really don’t know. I’ll have to consider and get back to you.”
“You know what Blaise was saying earlier? About throwing his money at any and every project which strikes his fancy?”
“I don’t know. I don’t think he knows any of mine. He doesn’t talk, I’m not allowed to talk to him.” He says. He opens his right arm, showing Harry the purple crease of his inner elbow. “This is from the injections.”
They start with trousers, finding several pairs in a variety of classy neutrals that both fit Draco and he doesn’t consider ‘ugly.’
“Potter will show you, you’ll be sharing an office as is customary in the aurors.” Robards says. He nods significantly at Harry.
"I definitely would. I'm going to ask him what he wants. I'm not even sure if he wants to… to date, or whatever."
“Thought I’d give it a shot. I’ve been told I’m as good a flier as my dad anyway, so if he could do it, I should be able to.”
By the time he’s able to process it all, Harry’s back, stroking his skin with one hand like how it had all started. Draco blinks a few times.
Fred says Malfoy would be the son of an oil monger in America, and Harry says he’d be a British kid in India who was brought by his parents who were very wealthy and spoiled him rotten, but never actually spoke to him because of all the parties they attended.
Draco was twitching nervously in the sitting room, dressed neatly in his new clothes, when there was a smart rap on the door.
“Don’t. My reputation comes and goes. What the people think of me varies, but so long as I have the loyalty of my court, what does it matter?”
He can hear Narcissa talking to one of the elves through a wall as they walk quietly, and Malfoy holds a glowing orb to light the way.
“Did you put on glamours?” Harry asks. Draco nods, lifting his left sleeve. The Mark fades back into view after a moment.
“Bubble bath and bath salts. You’ve probably used them before.” Harry explains, slicing the tape on the top of the box. Draco opens it.
“I understand. Another option is for me to physically heal your body, but should you have any biological children, the curse will be passed down several generations. The last option is to put your body into a temporary stasis, during which you will be unconscious while we look into this specific curse to find the best way to target and remove it. This option could take years, but would be the most complete solution.”
Harry wants to run over, but he moves slowly so he doesn’t scare him. Draco’s eyes are open but he doesn’t seem to be registering anything he's looking at.
“Pierson. Pierson!” Draco says urgently. “Hide in my room. Make sure the one with no name sees you running. He will bring the others.”
“Yes.” Draco croaks, releasing the bin into Harry’s hands. Marion takes it and mutters something, which empties and cleans it.
“I-” Draco squeezes his eyes shut. Harry leans forward, taking his hand and rubbing the back. “I-” He tries again, but doesn’t get any further.
“I do hope we meet again soon, Harry.” Meredith says, smiling sweetly. Harry nearly swallows his tongue.
They formulate a plan. Hermione pensieves Harry’s memory during the initial incident, Ron brings Bill over, who takes one look at Harry and declares he’s not under a curse, and Harry writes down everything he can about his experiences with the Unforgivables.
“No, but they sentenced you to five years probation, which means at any point they can come by and check in on you. And you’re not supposed to use magic till it ends, which is when they’ll give you your wand back. I didn’t think I’d ever see you again, or I would've kept it and given it to you myself.” Harry says.
“It’s a shame you’re not playing Quidditch anymore.” Harry says absently as he follows the dip between left and right.
“Oh good for you then, my apologies.” He says sarcastically. “And pardon me for wanting to look my best.”
Malfoy squeezes his eyes shut. More tears leak out, which he swipes at hastily. Harry reserves his sympathy even as Malfoy’s distress makes him want to wrap him up and never let him go.
Draco’s eyes open suddenly, and he sits up with a jolt, scrambling away to the furthest corner of the bed.
“That’s wonderful, I’m happy to hear it.” Marion says warmly. “How did you know about how the potion was made?”
Wildly curious, everyone follows Draco out to the garden, where he kneels down, opening the snuff box again.
“Mm. It’s been mine for about ten years now.” Potter continues, and Draco guesses Sirius gave it to him when he died. “I stayed there for the holidays, but only at night.”
thoughtful and creative.” Draco says seriously, and it’s such a comical difference from his parents’ views, Harry has to laugh.
“It’s been awhile, Draco. I was very glad to receive your letter. I had no idea what happened to you.”
“Yes.” Draco whines, watching Harry with dark eyes and biting his lower lip. He lets out a soft whimper when Harry’s lips reach his inner elbow.
“I should hope so, it’s been going on for six years.” Harry mutters, adjusting the floofs over his arms. “How’s this meant to stay up?”
Harry fights his curse, trying to break free, but he’s completely paralysed on the floor. Watching Draco be attacked.
“I’m offended you didn’t ask me to be your best man, but at least you didn’t ask anyone else.” He says, thumping Harry hard on the back.
Hermione’s owl is scratching at the window, and Draco opens it up to take the note and give the owl a friendly pat. It’s very cute.
“How wonderful for us." Knox says. "My comfort food is bread. I can eat an entire loaf in a sitting if no one stops me.”
“Fair enough.” Draco says, picking up a beer and flicking the top off with magic. Brutus gives him a nod and walks off.
gives him a dirty smile, though it looks fake and unnatural, and his eyes have the same glazed over look they’ve had on the pole, though he looks less like he’s been drugged and more like he’s operating under someone else’s orders.
the time. I have a vial in my hut to help me figure out who I fancy at any given time.” Ashe says thoughtfully. “Last I checked, I had freshly washed linens, sort of an ambiguous cologne and-”
Malfoy starts laughing when Harry has to pour water straight from his wand into his mouth with an Aguamenti.
Mr. Weasley joined them a few minutes later, clapping Harry excitedly on the shoulder and holding out his hand to shake Draco’s.
“I’ve sat through every witness in this court today. I myself did not know Draco Malfoy at any point, but the likelihood of someone who is so remorseful for his actions risking everything he’s built up since then just for one ounce of protection from Harry, which is clearly not doing much considering you still arrested him, well, the likelihood is slim to none.
“When was he last on trial?” Draco asks, and answers his own question when no one says anything. “1986. He hasn’t gone back to crime in sixteen years, why would he now that you’ll be watching him? Jack is smart.”
First, he’d caught someone trying to snap a photo of him using the loo - he’s glad to report Expelliarmus works on cameras as well.
“Draco, you live in a mansion. You have fourteen bedrooms, each with their own closet.” Harry points out with a laugh.
“No. I messed up a note and started folding it up and when I was done, it looked like this.” Draco says, eyeing it with a frown.
“You’re absurd. And I do not fancy seeing your hard cock this early in the morning no matter how old I am.”
“You weren’t planning on using it, you said. Did you want to stay there for Christmas? I assumed you’d be at the Weasleys’.”
“Well that’s why I asked you.” He says weakly. “Because I don’t know, and when I don’t know something, you usually have an answer for me.”
“I’ll find one for us sometime, we could explore the Mediterranean. We’ll have to find you a strong sunblock, though, I imagine your pale complexion does not react well to sunlight.” Harry teases, and Draco glares. Harry laughs, feeling lighter than he has in a few weeks.
Harry looks over again as a particularly strong spell knocks out four bouncers. Malfoy’s not using the wand, only gripping it tightly in his fist. Harry doesn’t have time to think about that.
I hope you all liked this chapter - from here on out, we really start getting into the meat and potatoes of plot...
Okay, Molly stans, I know I presented her in a pretty bad light, but I urge you to reread some of the scenes Harry mentions.. she's super protective and whilst that's not bad, it does get out of hand:// dw, this is not the last we see of her!
“Harry? Why are you on the floor?” Ron asks as he hovers in the bedroom outside the cracked door. Harry looks back to find Draco’s eyes.
Maybe Potter would have inspired Draco to question his family’s values - Potter, with his house-elf, muggleborn and blood traitor friends, his half-giant pseudo-guardian and his werewolf mentor.
“Hermione’s going to see if you can be released into my custody. I don’t think you’ll be able to get out of the 5-years probation, but if you’re here, you can do whatever you want and they won’t bother you.” Harry says.
“Er, dog, probably. Maybe stag, depends on my mood.” Potter says, taking a hasty drink of his beverage. “Hm. Knox - strangest thing you’ve ever eaten.”
“Alright, then, if you prefer it, I’ll wear pants for the next 24 hours until you go from er…” Malfoy shuts his eyes. “Six thousand, two hundred and some-odd days old to six thousand, two hundred and some-odd plus one days old.”
The Twins end up falling asleep on the sofa after a particularly long-winded description of Fred’s successful rugby career by Malfoy, whose answers had gotten increasingly specific as he drank more wine.
“I’m speaking with you, Malfoy, and I still don’t really think of you as a fairy, just a person who’s very recently gone from an incredible pain in my arse to reasonably alright. And muggles can bring people back to life sometimes too, if they’re fast and lucky enough.”
“You’ve painted your nails?” Harry asks, finally realising the little pale pink bottle in his hand is indeed nail polish. “And is everything in that bathroom lavender or light pink?”
But evidently, the student body hadn’t heard. They chattered and whispered when he walked into the Potions classroom, quiet enough to ensure the infamous Malfoy wouldn’t hear them and damn them to hell.
Malfoy is bent over Crabbe’s corpse, so pale and lifeless there’s no way he could still be alive. Malfoy’s sobbing.
“I was looking at the dress. It’s really sparkly.” Harry says, willing away the heat beneath his collar.
“I completely understand where you're coming from.” Harry nods, feeling the satisfying itch of vengeful justice settling low in his bones.
It certainly doesn’t help that Malfoy’s wearing a skirt again, and his skintight pants are on full display as the bloke paws at him.
for this.” He pants. Harry grins. It’s not the first death threat of the evening and certainly not the first of their time fooling around with edging like this.
“Yeah, probably. He ended up dead either way, so I suppose it didn’t matter all that much, though I am glad Sirius died innocent.”
“You’d better. If I don’t hear from you by tomorrow night, I’ll have to assume you’ve gone into hermitage out of sheer desperation.”
“Potter, Malfoy. Did you have something you wanted to share with the class or shall we continue the lesson sans flirting?”
So when he was invited to Dean’s bachelor party in a gay strip club hidden in the depths of wizarding London, seeing the white-blond hair and pointy chin again was quite a shock.
He allows himself to be rearranged to lay fully on the bed, the mostly-clothed man behind him, holding Draco’s still-hard cock possessively. He can feel the cum leaking out slowly onto his legs, and it feels disgusting.
“Cut from the ground, not below the flower. Stems are used in a lot of potions as well and they’ll just die out here anyway.” Draco explains, showing his long-stemmed nocturnal flowers in his bag. Harry shrugs, doing as instructed.
Harry has to set an egg down so he has a chance to consider Malfoy firing off hexes at Death Eaters wearing eyeliner and platform boots.
A flash of Malfoy’s whines as he fucked himself on his fingers in full view of Harry runs through his head, Malfoy coming to the sound of Harry’s voice, casually referencing his use of sex toys-
"They'll still hurt a lot but dermals require an incision, which is always more painful. The part of your skin is less sensitive, but the operation is far more invasive."
“Alright then, we’ll go to your house. Is there a back way we could go through? I don’t have the most pleasant memories of the front.” Harry says hesitantly. Malfoy shivers.
Firenze. His coffin was far larger than the rest, and Harry morbidly tried to imagine how he had been arranged inside. No other centaurs were in sight. He didn’t know if anyone had informed them he’d died, or if they’d so thoroughly cut him off that they didn’t appear anyway. Hagrid was arguing tearfully with a man attempting to attach ropes to the coffin to pull it somewhere.
Draco shifts, then pulls his notebook from his pocket. He opens from the middle, flipping the pages back. Harry gets a glimpse of several pages, seeing
“You alright? Uh- need help with anything?” Harry asks awkwardly. He’s never complimented Malfoy before and he’s not sure what comes after.
“Asher.” Draco lies, lifting his drink as if toasting and taking a sip. It goes down easier every time.
“So are we going to be uncomfortable again?" Potter asks abruptly with a sheepish smile. "I'm sure it’s entirely possible for us to carry on a conversation without discussing our histories and your sex life.”
“What’s the counter-curse? Fuck.” He turns to the four petrified students. “Go get Hermione.” He orders.
“Do you want that?” Harry asks. “It doesn’t have to affect work, I’m sure you’d be just as good as a man.”
Draco very, very slowly makes his way across the room, testing the door. It opens, and he steps out.
“No, it’s okay. I think you may have had a nightmare.” Harry says. Draco only stares back at him. “Did you?”
“As long as you’d like. You enjoy the shower?” Harry asks, a smile threatening to take over his face.
“You’ve done plenty. I look forward to seeing your cousin this fall. I do hope he’s a bit less of a troublemaker than all of you have been.” She says, and Harry laughs.
Ron claps his hands onto his thighs, standing with a grunt. Harry follows, putting one hand on Ron’s arm.
Draco turns, walking back the way he came into the throng of students, looking like he hadn’t just been speaking of his own death.
Harry has a hand over his mouth to keep from laughing as Malfoy wraps things up, posts it, and slides off the counter again.
“Start from the bottom, work your way up.” Harry says innocently, as if it’s the first time Draco has complained about how Harry dresses himself.
“I’m really sorry you don’t feel well, but you have to eat something or you’ll starve.” Harry says gently. Draco nods.
“We weren’t. You used a charm to make it fly over to me, and when I unfolded it, there was a moving drawing of me playing Quidditch and being struck by lightning. You were trying to scare me, I guess.”
“Oh right. Here.” Malfoy waves his wand at it all, and everything moves to his bed, where he shoves a wide variety of things onto the floor to make room.
They don’t talk for the rest of the dance. As soon as the next song starts, however, Meredith groans.
"'Greg, how fit was your summer, I mean, your fit summer, such a tall fit! Morocco was hot?'" Greg recalls with a fond smile. "Did wonders for my self esteem."
As he listens, Harry starts hearing hints of the more familiar accent coming through, and realises that the feminine voice is something
“Of course, Harry. We can speak freely in here, my office is soundproof and doesn’t allow eavesdropping of any kind. Perks of being an Unspeakable.” She winks, and Harry relaxes.
“Cockwarming. You do not move. You do not ask for more. You stay in place and you take it.” The handsome man says to Draco.
“You told me you didn’t want to be friends, but I still did. I didn’t know how to be ignored by Harry Potter, so I made it so you couldn’t ignore me.” Draco explains. Harry is shocked.
“Stop me if I’m reading this wrong.” Malfoy says huskily, turning around to look at Harry. Harry is about to ask what he means when Malfoy’s hands are on his shoulders and he backs Harry up against… something. The side of the stage, probably, Harry isn’t fussed. He's more concerned by the dark look in Malfoy's eyes.
“Oh my goodness!” Astoria whispers, joined by the gasps and surprised noises of the rest of their guests.
He watches as Draco examines the paper bird more closely, then does a complicated series of motions with the wings before placing it on his palm and blowing gently in Harry’s direction.
“You agreed to speak English, Zabini. If you agree to do something, gotta follow through.” Harry says. Draco nods.
“We should leave the aurors and form a private agency exclusively for infiltrating high society functions.” Harry suggests when they read the case file.
Draco hooks his trouser-less leg over Potter’s shoulder, and Potter circles his fingers around Draco’s hole.
With one hand absently touching his lips, Malfoy’s usually sharp eyes have a distinct glassiness to them, one Harry’s never seen before, let alone directed at him. His cheeks are flushed scarlet and he’s panting heavily. His skirt hides absolutely nothing, and Harry resists the temptation to pull it aside to see the evidence of his enjoyment for himself.
For Narcissa, George says ‘Cleopatra,’ and winks, and Malfoy tells him to stop flirting with his mother while Narcissa laughs.
“Well. I Apparated from yours. Got to England, checked that all parts were attached. I sent you a Patronus - which you ignored so very rudely - and put my stuff down at my England house. Don’t look so surprised, I have two houses just like you do.”
“It’s probably one of the older ones. Everyone knows Draco needs almost no prompting to talk about his sex life.”
“Do you truly not know how spoiled you are?” Harry asks suddenly, setting his fork down. Malfoy looks up.
“Okay, that’s too much for me to be aware of all the time.” Harry interrupts. “I’ll just keep it private.”
He writes for a while, pen shaking in his unsteady hand. Marion gets him a glass of water while she waits. Harry strokes his back.
“I understand.” Harry repeats, and he’s surprised when Draco jumps onto his lap and squeezes him. “I’m finally starting to understand you.”
“So I’m just broken then? Dropped on my head one too many times?” Neville asks sadly. “I don’t like kissing, much less anything else beyond that.”
“You’re a bit of… well, a big deal with a lot of the elves.” Blaise finally says, completely devoid of any tone. “Kreacher speaks highly of you, and he’s become sort of a leader in the elf-employment movement.”
“This is fun.” Potter says mildly, his hands falling to rest on Draco’s hips. He can feel the warmth of each palm through his trousers.
“That’s not that embarrassing, Potter. Everyone knows you’re a better flier than me, it’s why you got on the school team first. What would be
“It was. I changed it.” Draco says. He holds out his hand and takes the quill, hesitantly tucking it behind George’s single ear. “It’s bewitched with physical contact Legilimency. When you think of a new thing to sell, it will write it down. It doesn’t react to voice commands. Open the paper pad to start using it.”
Draco is much slimmer than Ron, so he puts the arm bands over top of his jumper. He tucks his own wand into the straps, where it lays against his inner arm, and adjusts it a bit to be snug.
“This stuff’s called heliotrope. It’s very conducive for my writing process, now more than ever.” Draco explained as they arranged a few vases around the desk.
“Could you ask Hermione if that’s possible?” Harry asked. “Er- Maybe I could track him down if I knew it was safe.” He added quickly.
“Okay.” Draco’s eyes fall to the bed. He starts tugging at one of his sleeve cuffs, squirming in the shirt.
“Is this some lingering Unspeakable training?” Robards asks with a hint of interest. He often tries to get Malfoy to slip up and spill some Unspeakable secrets, and gets annoyed when Malfoy never does.
Draco skims over it, and Harry distantly recognises that Hermione and George have finished unwrapping gifts and are watching Draco and Harry.
okay? I’ll come right over if you need me. I’ve been your friend for ages, you can ask me for whatever and I’ll do anything I can to help you.”
“That’s true, I suppose.” Hermione says pensively. “You really dodged a bullet though. If Malfoy hadn’t warned us of the Taboo on his name, you would’ve given your location away because you use it.”
“Tell Shannon. Ask for her advice.” Draco suggests. “I don’t want you to help me because I want to be equal. I want to be like Ron and Hermione.”
Draco thinks for a long time. Harry waits patiently. It wasn’t a question, so he may not get an answer, but he also didn’t want to have to punish Draco again.
“Do you know where these scars on your chest came from?” Harry asks, dread settling into his stomach.
Draco has to give himself a firm talking to immediately after to avoid asking for more slaps. Not the place for that.
For all his proclamations, Neville has a refreshingly normal life now, and with all the madness of the last several weeks, getting drinks with him is just what Harry needed.
Harry moves around the kitchen as fast as possible without breaking anything. He doesn’t want to waste a second of their time.
“Remus. He couldn’t trust me after some of the things I did. And I stopped trusting him before your parents died.”
The brief details the case. A ring of magical animal smugglers and illegal potions dealers are meeting under the guise of a charity gala (
The sun sets facing the mountain, and Harry watches the colours of the heather grow more vibrant as the orange in the sky is reflected onto them.
“Neville cornered it and sliced the head off with the sword.” Ron grins, sounding very proud of their friend.
“What’s the matter?” Harry asks, leaning forward. He has to stop himself from taking Draco’s hand to soothe him.
“No.” Knox says, wrinkling her nose. “So already not great on that front. He was also… shall we say… his prick was enormous.”
“It’s okay. You don’t need to be sorry, you’re allowed to think things are ugly. Do you not like my clothes, then?”
“Absolutely not, it’s professional-grade massage oil and should not be used for anything other than that.” Draco says, though he doesn’t mention the time he’d given a facing shoulder massage whilst seated on the man’s cock, nor the time he’d been massaging Pansy’s back whilst Blaise absolutely devastated Draco’s arse from behind.
Harry, weighed down by expectation and purpose, would dread public courts before Draco. It’s because of Draco that they’ve become bearable.
He surprises Harry by straddling him, much like he had during his final performance. Harry’s hands fell automatically to his hips, gentle to avoid pressing the bruises.
“What if- Can I… I’d like to suck you off.” He says, summoning all of his courage. Harry grabs at his own cock, pinching it.
Harry nearly jumps out of his skin when he hears Malfoy’s very real voice breaking through his lust-clouded mind.
“Your crown has apple blossoms for love and peace, ivory spray roses for charm and grace, pink morning glories for gentleness, thoughtfulness and gratitude, and a yellow carnation. The first flower you ever gave me.”
Draco wakes up to a pounding headache. The light of the room is as jarring as ever, and he sits up slowly. His vision swims.
The heels, or more specifically, boots, are extremely tall, and the black leather goes all the way up his leg to above his knees. The shorts are tiny, cutting off high on his thighs. Tucked into the shorts is a shiny, silky grey shirt that’s open all the way down his chest.
“Well, I’m twenty-five and not sixteen.” Draco sniffs. “Things are put into perspective when you’re out of school.”
“I was playing against other kids then. We’re still not sure if I can hold my own with professionals.”
Harry grabs the soap while Draco thinks, washing up efficiently so Draco can have his time in the water soon.
Draco rolls his eyes when he’s turned another direction. Potter seems to still be a reckless Gryffindor.
“Marion said the potion keeping you hard all the time would wear off, this is good. It means your body is healing.” Harry says.
“I can’t imagine who that might be from, considering it’s not me and only one other person you know has a mobile.”
Though everyone who sees them seems shocked, no one else gives away their presence. Voldemort can’t see them yet, as they’re blocked by taller people standing in the front.
“The thrill of being caught? All I’m saying is maybe you should cast some cleaning charms over that cloak of yours before touching it again.”
After a second, there was an awkward cough, and Harry pulled back to see Lucius had appeared, staring at the floor very intensely.
“I like when you like me. I like when you spoil me when you like me. And you’re happy. I don’t like this. When you’re not happy because… because…”
“I think you’d really enjoy a multi-day cruise.” Harry says to Draco, who’s sitting primly on top of Harry’s folded jacket in the seat facing Harry. He’s little enough that he’s barely visible, and Harry’s sure he’s indignant about that.
“Well, I wanted a solid gold cauldron when I first went shopping, but Hagrid wouldn’t let me buy it. And I wanted gold scales, but again, no go. But Hagrid’s not here now, so I shall buy what I please.”
“Luxury - or more simply, anything more than the very minimum. That’s what I wanted to talk about, with you using a piece of paper rather than a notebook, when we both know you can afford one.”
was blasting guards out of the way. “It was you. I didn’t think Draco had done anything, he wasn’t holding the wand right.”
When Snape finally looks away, Harry twists back again to look at Malfoy, who’s resting his cheek on one palm. The scorched thistle is in his other hand, and he spins it between his fingers absently.
The shot wasn’t really painful at all. He had to be told again what it was for - apparently, Greyback mentioned it, but Draco was so drunk he didn’t remember most of last night. This only further demonstrated the need for a potion which would up his tolerance. He certainly wouldn’t mind not waking up with a hangover.
“I sort of expect it of Lucius.” Harry admits. “He’s hated me for years, that won’t change after I killed his boss.”
“You and Weasley, find Longbottom. Have him take all the above age students to Gryffindor tower - no exceptions, every last student above seventeen. Once you’ve told him, find the other Prefects and have them round up all the underage students and bring them to the Hufflepuff dorm. To my knowledge, their common room is safe from the Death Eaters, who were all Slytherin. We’ll use that to our advantage. Stay there until further notice.”
“I pay them, obviously.” Blaise says, an air of carelessness betrayed by his frown as he makes eye contact with Harry. “I believe you know one of them.”
“Can you flip back over? I’d like to see your face.” Harry asks, and Draco huffs, but he isn’t in a position to be making demands right now, he just wants Harry to keep going until he can’t take it anymore. So he rolls over, Harry guiding and following with the hand still shoved up his arse.
“Draco? Were you reading this?” Harry asks with a laugh. He picks it up. The bookmark is in the same place as before.
Then he went back to all those places and found the absolute prettiest versions of each book. For some, it was paperback, but for others, he found lovely gold-embossed copies.
“Went out to buy more milk, we’re nearly out.” Astoria says, bringing a platter of sandwiches. “Hello, Blaise.”
“The other four- well, I’ve got them in highly secure cells, no visitors. Unfortunately, given that we’ve got so many people in custody right now, they’ve had to forfeit a few meals since the lower security cells are served first.”
Potter looks exactly as good nude as Draco had anticipated, though he was precious about showing his cock, which had been a bit of a disappointment. Still, his arse could keep Draco busy for
“Mister Potter.” The oldest man interrupts. “I understand your concern, but we have many things to do today, and we just need to get on with it. He’s a man, he’ll be fine.”
“Look.” Jack says seriously. “I did what I could. I wish every moment that I could’ve done what you did.”
“I was operating under the assumption that you’d grown your skills since age seventeen, you’ll pardon me for thinking such.” Malfoy says with a twinge of humour. Harry groans, dropping his head back.
They return to the common room, and to Draco’s relief, no one pays them any mind. Harry and Ron are focused intently and Draco returns to his room to wait for night, nervous that for the first time in months, Harry won’t turn up.
“Out of nowhere, the biggest one drops to the ground, dead. And the other two turn, and Crabbe’s there, and he kills a second. The third got to him before he could fire again, but I grabbed the first one’s wand and Stunned him.”
Harry imagines Draco has had plenty of emptiness in his life, and it’s about time he enjoys freedom and activities.
“Snape accused us of flirting in class last week.” Harry says abruptly. “I mean, we were just talking, but. I haven’t seen him since, he skipped Potions last class. But he skips class a lot. I don’t think it means anything.”
“Do you like apples?” Harry asks, a memory of Draco biting into a green apple in the back of his mind. That was almost an entirely different person.
Malfoy’s hand squeezes tighter, and he presses his side into Harry’s. Their shared power makes their spell light overpoweringly strong. So bright, it’s difficult to look at.
“Perfectly! Master Harry must get changed!” She squeaks excitedly. “Master Draco is being dressed already!”
Draco starts to wilt from there, although Harry can’t tell if it’s because he’s sad or because he’s tired. Maybe both.
He’s a step too late to just leave when Lucius exits the house, spotting them both and walking over.
“Ron’s got them in cells. He’s safe at Grimmauld, only people you’ve chosen can get inside anyway. And sure, there’s no way he’s
“Honestly, keeping busy is usually a good thing, even if it is akin to slavery. Maybe Hogwarts could bring in some outside help to spruce up their quarters, ask if there’s anything they’d like to make the work easier or something instead.” He says. “They’d hardly have use for money anyway.”
“After everything you’ve done, you can’t even look him in the face?” Harry demands, staring down at Zeus’s crumpled face.
body started as Fred and which as George but that's not important- so Fred's body was Kedavra'd. But he saw the spell light coming and he hopped into the other body - George’s, so the body here, the one that was hit, didn't have a soul in it when the Kedavra landed."
Listen, any excuse is good enough to show off in front of Potter, especially if he can coax him into-
you’ve had him for three weeks.” Neville says. “Although, the fact that you know Malfoy’s birthday is not something I’ll be letting go. You don't even know mine and we've lived together for years.”
Or at least, he thinks it’s still night. There’s no way to tell time inside this room, and no one comes in regularly enough to set a pattern. Their answers to his questions are maddeningly unhelpful.
He looks back at her, at the waist-length blonde hair pulled back on one side, the dark-red-and-gold dress with the deep neckline and the silvery eyes watching him from a pale face. She watches him curiously, her dainty, long fingered hand still extended between them. She tilts her head down, meaningfully, quirking a brow.
Neville humors him and joins in a spirited ‘Happy Birthday’ song and he and Harry blow it out as Draco meows, leaning closer to the flame like he’s mirroring them.
“Obliviating Draco in the back room.” He says, hoping Ron can hear it above the din, and do something about it before Pierson is too far gone.
The week leading up to the event was a blur of activity. Harry was not the least bit inclined to ‘try out’ for the show, and was determined to only attend as a guest.
Memories of trying to do star charts at school are a blur. He’s not sure he’d ever learned anything in that class.
Robards was fighting uphill, and Harry wanted to cheer as each person who testified spoke of Draco so highly.
Listen , I know this is later than I usually update but h e y it's still Sunday where I am so technically //not// late. :) enjoy
Harry gives Draco a towel again, and a fresh set of clothes, although he reminds Draco that he doesn’t have to wear what he doesn’t want to.
He again makes far more food than he thinks will be consumed, but Malfoy eats it all, as well as a few pieces of bacon off Harry’s plate.
things life has to offer.” Greyback growls. A shiver runs up Draco’s spine at the mention of his father.
“No.” Blaise agrees, mouthing at Draco’s ear. “But what fun it would’ve been, yeah? Should I train you now, pet?”
When they’re all dismissed to floo out, Smith walks up to Draco, pointing at his mouth. Harry notices a few of the aurors pause to see what Draco will do.
“I haven’t even spoken to him since Fifth year when he nearly snapped my wand.” Malfoy says, shrugging.
“Thanks Harry. I’ll see you in the morning.” Draco says, a weak smile forced onto his face. “I’ve told Mims which flowers to finish setting up in our room, she’ll take care of things.”
“Anyway, I’d hardly expected to run into you in a street market.” Potter says mildly. “It was quite a shock. Don’t try to feed me that line about not seeing my picture in the news. You would’ve stared a lot more if you hadn’t, I look completely different now.”
“Thank you.” Draco says again. He’s not sure what he’s forgotten, but his head has stopped pounding for the first time in ages.
"Charlie?" Draco asks. Charlie is so mild mannered, even tempered and thoughtful that Draco can't imagine him being responsible for a death.
Draco pulled his knees to his chest, scooting back into the corner his cot sat in. The plaster walls were cold against his back, barely protected by his thin shirt. His breathing was too fast.
"Yeah, you're a terrible human being." Harry says, getting up from where he'd straddled Malfoy's hips. Neither of them remark on that.
“Right. But you were really rude then. You had two friends who were with you most of the time, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle.”
“I don’t care. I’m not fussed about pronouns, no matter what I look like. It makes more sense to use feminine pronouns if whoever I’m around doesn’t know, but I don’t
"Have you been to one of these before?" Draco asks hesitantly. Mitch is very nice but Draco knows not to ask too many questions.
“Peppy is glad to see Master Draco taking care of himself again.” Peppy says kindly, and is gone again before either can respond.
“What did they say?” Harry asks curiously. He can’t think of ever hearing Goyle speak, and remembers Blaise as having been rather aloof and arrogant.
Harry sighs, recalling the night he Expelliarmus’d Stan Shunpike instead of Stunning him, and understanding how Draco feels.
Draco is not being paid, but that's not common knowledge. They've stopped asking him why he's the only one who lives at the club, stopped asking why he never uses the loo or eats anything.
Harry shuts his eyes, letting warmth and happiness buzz along his arm toward his wand. It takes some effort not to immediately conjure up a stag, but he reigns it in to a non-corporeal form and directs it toward the stoat’s heart.
Harry can feel his own face light up at the excitement and relief coming from Draco. He shifts onto his knees on the sofa like he’s too energetic to stay sitting.
Astoria has work to do for Daphne, so after Greg puts him under, Astoria enlists Draco’s help in stuffing envelopes with letters and forms.
Finally, Alpha gives in. He kneels on the floor in front of them, sitting like Draco used to, with his head bowed. When Harry glances up, the auror is just as surprised that without even a word, Draco has a much larger man on his knees.
“Seemed like a good way to get you to let me leave last night.” Malfoy says humorously. “And I figured you’d ask anyway come Monday.”
“Oh my god.” Malfoy whispered, jerking his hands away the second Harry was free. Harry scrambled up.
“I asked for a cup of tea.” Zabini says easily. He leans forward, lowering his voice. “He said leaving here was ‘against the rules.’ What does he mean?”
He sits in the velvety chair and looks around at the many mirrors hanging on the walls. He assumes that behind at least one, a camera or a person watches the happenings of the room. It makes his skin crawl.
Malfoy doesn't turn back around, and when Harry mumbles an awkward goodbye, he sees Malfoy Summon his cloak again and fasten it back around himself.
Okay I really love Peppy knowing she can be sassy and bossy and that Draco doesn't punish or reprimand her at all, the elves are genuinely household members and not servants. idk house elf right ig
“Nope. I mean, Crabbe… he thought well of him and Goyle, he’d defend them last summer anytime I brought it up. He really did like Crabbe, so…”
“I’d never timed how long I can hold my shields up. I know the chart, though, we studied it in training.”
“Oh, it’s a muggle thing. It’s called a pinky swear. It’s mostly a gesture of good will, not officially binding. But I take my promises very seriously.” She says, taking his hand and lifting his pinky, then locking hers around it. She smiles at him.
Harry doesn’t know exactly what feels ‘incorrect’ about the Manor, but he gets the idea. He wouldn’t want to go back there given the choice either.
“Couple nights ago. I’ll warn you, don’t go reading just any book about fairies, a lot of them are really racist.”
“That said, you will need to… I mean, purely for appearances’ sake, your mother and I, we urge you to find- Perhaps your friend Pansy? A marriage of convenience, to produce an heir, you understand…”
This dance is livelier and the music is too loud for conversation, but Meredith is a fantastic dance partner, though Harry stumbles once or twice and she gives him a wry told-you-so look.
Hermione was sulking a bit, but Harry discreetly dewrinkled her aura, which brightened her mood considerably.
Malfoy faces Harry, watching him blankly as he mechanically spells his face and hair to show no sign of his crying.
“In a manner of speaking. When I freed my elves, they panicked, not knowing what to do with themselves. In light of your elves working at Hogwarts, many other elf-owners sent their freed elves there too, and there were simply too many without enough work to do.
“If I kiss Harry like that, he can’t keep his hands off me. Granted, we’re together and attracted to each other specifically, but still.”
“That’s right.” Harry says. “It’s part of their rebranding. Team was bought by a new owner, so they’re changing everything around hoping it’ll help them win.”
Snape, McGonagall, Sprout, Flitwick and Hagrid are all accompanying the students just in case something happens.
Draco can tell when the man falls asleep, and he waits a minute longer before he very slowly, very carefully slips out of his hold.
“Because this is the first time you’ve been bratty since you came to live with me. It reminds me of what you used to be like. I think it means you’re getting a little bit better, even if it doesn’t feel like it.”
“So, do you have a foot fetish or was it just me?” Harry asks, giving him a mischievous look. Draco rolls his eyes.
“Hey, it’s alright. You’re safe here.” Harry whispers, drying his hands and slowly reaching out to touch Draco’s face. His thumb wipes a tear from his cheek. “I won’t let anything happen to you here.”
He’s quickly pushed into a chair by a girl, who he tries to introduce himself to, but she brushes him off and is done with his appearance before he’s able to learn her name.
“Dobby’s just heard the news! How terrible!” Dobby squeaks, using bright socks to wipe at his enormous eyes.
“If it makes you feel better, I’ll owl a case of the good beer Daphne drinks and you can rub it in his face, what poor taste he has in bevvies.” Astoria offers.
“Alright, so not in front of your friends. That’s just Nott, Zabini, Parkinson, Crabbe and Goyle, right?”
“This is the best in the house. Reminds me a bit of the Prefect bathrooms at Hogwarts. I come here anytime I feel like luxuriating in fancy things.”
“He came highly recommended by the department head, he requested a transfer and with Ms. Patil moving to another department, we decided to use him to fill the opening rather than wasting time working with a trainee.”
“Oh. I’m sorry. I would never have left you there if I had known. I’ve been looking for you for years. I honestly thought you’d gone to France to escape after they got your parents, but I could never find out the address. I’ve been to France every six months hoping you’d turn up.”
“It’s funny to hear you say shit.” He explains. She rolls her eyes again. “No, just because you’re so prim and proper. It’s funny when you swear either way.”
“Yes. I was given injections. They didn’t want me eating so I wouldn’t get fat and so I wouldn’t shit.”
His hips continued in aborted little movements as he rode out his climax, and Harry could only stare with his mouth open. When it seemed to be over, he shifted his foot back slightly. It seemed as if even the birds outside were too startled to chirp.
“Well, I don’t feel any moral opposition to that. I’ll get things sorted here and owl the paperwork to you when it’s done.”
“This way.” Malfoy says, opening up a portrait and gesturing impatiently for them to enter. “Shortcut.”
When Draco returns to the living room, Blaise is draped over Pansy’s lap on the sofa, snoring heavily.
healer position? The one with photos of all the dragon tamers?” Potter asks, pointing at his own chest with a small smile.
“He’s refusing to call me Professor Malfoy, usually says Mr. Malfoy unless he’s being particularly insolent, when he calls me Draco. I’ve given him detention for it twice now, but he’s weaseled his way out of it tomorrow night.”
“Then we’ll deal with it. I’m not going to just fuck off because you don’t know what rimming means, or something stupid like that-”
fault that you were hurt. Your mother… well, she was complicated. I can tell you more about her another time, if you’d like.”
Draco rarely finishes on days like this. Some days, he'll get closer than others, staining his silky garments with drops of precum leaking from his cock.
“I got pretty scraped up here, but I guess Hold knew a couple healing spells that did the trick. Still a bit scarred, though.”
“Alright, sure, it’s not like you could see anything anyway.” He says, pulling Potter’s jumper off and tossing it back at him. He knows he looks very nice in his pale silk pyjama set, and now that he's inside, it'd be a shame not to let them be seen, even if he had to go to the trouble of hiding all his chest scars to let the shirt lay artfully unbuttoned.
“At any rate, she hasn’t contacted me. I heard she was looking for me right after the battle, but I barely knew what was happening and someone stunned me before I could talk to her.”
"Ooh! Where did you find this? I've never heard of it." He asks giddily, turning it over to read the back.
Their table erupted in whoops and shouts as a grinning Dean and Dean’s brother, whose name Harry still hadn’t learned, approached.
“If you went somewhere as Meredith with like… the poshest, most feminine outfit on and just… ate the biggest meal. Somewhere with really manly men, they can just watch this tiny woman put away the most food they’ve ever seen.”
Harry rolls his eyes when Malfoy disappears into the kitchen. When he returns, Harry doesn’t think he’s imagining the way Malfoy wriggles in his seat for a second before digging into his food.
Inside, Draco sits in the accused’s chair, still handcuffed and looking nervous as he bounces his leg.
“Yeah. Yeah, I like big.” Draco says, sounding wrecked already. He brushes Potter’s hair off his forehead. “I’m still taller, though.”
Willows grins, watching as Prott takes one pepper from the jar with a grimace, then drops it into his mouth.
Harry feels very numb. He barely registers the hand slipping into his where it rests on the chair’s arm.
“Oh right. Yeah, I can probably arrange that. You don’t have to do it, though. You look like you could use some rest.”
He reaches Harry then, shoving at his chest. Harry automatically grabs his wrists, still staring at him.
Draco finds himself across from Potter tonight, sitting between Jamie Hold, who he still barely knows anything about despite having resided briefly in her lap last time, and Prott on his left.
“Little Dragon.” Draco says finally, wrinkling his nose as a few people laugh. He shrugs. “Bite me.”
Rather cranky, achy in his crotch and feeling like he’d wasted the entire summer, Harry flops onto his bed without even glancing at Malfoy.
Malfoy’s face lights up and he sets his elbows on the desk, leaning forward with a bright expression.
“He kept me safe from rude patrons. He taught me how to do my job so I wouldn’t be punished so much. He charmed an ankle bracelet to make me stop remembering when I was punished.”
bad at Quidditch at first. That’s why my father paid my way onto the team, because he figured I had too much energy again and
Hermione has to remove him from the library in the evenings to attend dinner and to take him with her up to the tower for bed. Ron takes over from there, making sure Harry brushes his teeth and at least takes off his shoes before getting in bed.
“I sort of got that now, after this morning. I feel like we’ve wasted so much time.” Potter breathes, bending over Draco, folding him in half with his leg still propped on one shoulder, to kiss him again.
He used one foot to nudge Draco’s top leg up, spreading his knees open, then ran his toes along Draco’s inner thigh, bared by the shorts.
Draco’s world isn’t simple, and certainly not easy. But the way he speaks, he tries to explain complicated thoughts and feelings in a few, small words because the rest have lost their meaning in his mind.
“I feel dumb.” Harry says. “I know I’m usually oblivious to stuff, but this seems so obvious now. Just tonight, some man at the thing was coming on to a woman who very clearly wasn’t interested. It was right in front of me just a few minutes after you’d said that sort of thing happens, I didn’t even have to look for it.”
Malfoy squints at Harry, but mutters the spell and makes a pleased noise when the piercings heal and the redness fades.
“He would not come upstairs in your house, he does not know you that well. He might send a Patronus up, though. It’s a swallow and it pecks.”
Murmurs of acknowledgement flitted about the courtroom. Harry knew that public opinion of Draco, while still not very high, was significantly better than it had been before he’d published the book. Anyone who’d read it said they were taken aback by the fervent regret and urges to reconsider bigoted views.
“I’m quite cross with you. You know we talked about your habit of preying on animals. First the rabbits and now you’ve upgraded to stoats?”
Harry’s eyebrows raise as Lucius gestures at the two of them curled up on the sofa together, Draco’s arm twined with Harry’s.
“Draco, I was hoping to see you again soon. Come in.” Marion greets warmly, giving Harry a friendly nod.
“Not always. But with my hair, or nice touches like I’ve done with you, that sort of thing makes me fall asleep. Other stuff…” Harry wiggles his eyebrows at Draco, who blushes as he looks back to Harry’s hair. “Well, it doesn’t make me sleepy, I’ll just say that.”
Harry feels rather warm all over as he tugs Draco closer to himself, though not touching except the hands on his hips. He presses his lips to Draco’s shoulder.
“Nothing-” Potter says, bending his leg to rest one elbow on his knee. “I’m sympathetic. Most of us war vets have had a hard time dating anyone outside of each other.”
“Can you put glamours on yourself or do you need me to?” She asks, her wand twitching. Draco frowns.
Draco nods, wondering if they’re good enough friends now that he can ask when Potter inevitably comes by to have his spine repaired or something absurd like that.
“He also has some kind of ankle bracelet thing, he said I couldn’t get rid of it even though it’s fucking up his skin underneath. There are multiple sites of head trauma and older injuries that look like untreated concussions. Psychologically, I don’t even know where to start. Honestly, I’m really not sure how he’s still alive.”
him, have you read the papers? Kids read his books, and adults read his biography. He founded a program for muggle-born witches and wizards to receive financial support and safe, free housing when their families reject them. His program would’ve saved
“It works both ways, Harry.” Draco says smugly, releasing him just as quickly as he’d trapped him. He holds out a hand, which Harry takes without hesitation, and Draco pulls him back into step before letting go.
Draco’s voice is deadly serious, his hands have stopped shaking, and he takes a tiny step towards the students, slicing his arm over and over while they flinch away. He hardly seems to notice. At least one of them is crying.
Harry gets up to make them some dinner, and Draco shadows him, looking lost standing in the middle of the kitchen.
Harry looks at the new eyes. They're still grey, but much larger than before. They're oversized and unbalanced on Malfoy’s face, making him look a bit too innocent and just a tad unhuman. The irises are huge, taking up most of the space and swirling with silver, like a pot of boiling metal.
“It’s alright, I won’t let anyone hurt you, including Marion.” Harry says. He squeezes Draco’s hand.
He yawns loudly and gets up, shoving his feet into house shoes and heading downstairs. He can hear Draco’s soft footsteps behind him.
“Well you’ve probably just gotten lucky.” Hermione says sharply. “What if he starts using your scar connection again? The least you could do is practice Occlumency.”
Harry sits at a table for a long time after, wondering. He sort of hopes in the back of his mind that Malfoy might come out onto the floor and speak to him, but he’s alone until the bartender shouts for the final call.
It’s fairly easy to get himself a ticket after that, and he’s greatly looking forward to the weekday trip.
“Well he doesn’t remember that we hated each other. I think... he essentially profiles everyone he meets, remembering their behaviour and reactions so he knows how to not be hurt. He creates rules with everyone, remembers how they expect him to act. He’s been doing it with me from the first thing I said to him.”
“Mm.” Draco says, turning to see Potter giving a smug look and a nod to Willows as he makes an obscene gesture with a grin.
Inside Draco’s room, Harry tosses him down onto the bed, and Draco immediately grabs Harry’s tie and uses it to pull Harry on top, kissing him deeply.
“And whose cock will you ride until you see stars? It'd be a shame, you do look so gorgeous on my cock, kitty.” Harry teases, running his fingers along Draco’s very ticklish, very sensitive hip bones.
The whole crew shuffles down to the floos, heading to the Granger-Weasley house at Hermione’s command.
It’s a handsome burgundy leather with a black silk ribbon bookmark and handmade paper with rough edges. If Harry hadn’t known, he would have assumed Draco paid a lot of money for it.
Coating his fingers in lube, Harry would dip them between those delectable arsecheeks until he found the puckered rim. He’d caress the hole before pressing the tip of the first finger inside… just the tip, to tease a little, pulling it away and feeling smug as the arse moved back to chase the sensation.
Harry flinches slightly as the hot water hits his feet. At least, with two people in the shower, the water barely touches him. It mostly falls on Draco.
Ignoring Ron, Harry resigns himself to watching the blushing Durmstrang boy as Malfoy places his hand high on the thick thigh as he talks.
“It’s no secret that Voldemort wanted me dead. He even cast the killing curse on me twice in my life, which obviously,” Harry spread his arms dramatically, ''didn't work. The Imperius curse also did not work. I broke free of that as well. Unfortunately, those who witnessed, including Lucius Malfoy, are all either in Azkaban or dead. However, that memory as well has been pensieved for your review.”
plays professionally. How’d you get her?” Harry demands. “I haven’t even seen her in… probably eight years.”
Harry is prepared for cameras at the Ministry, but not lying in wait for them outside the visitor’s entrance.
“Yeah, yours. Would you like to open it with me?” He offers, slicing the tape on the box. Draco emerges from his cocoon, dropping to the floor eagerly.
“Disgusting. Absolutely uncalled for.” Ron says mockingly, but Harry can see the smile in his eyes. Harry laughs.
“Are you going to repeat everything I say, Potter? Thought you were an adult now and could hold a proper conversation.”
“Roll over, I think it’ll be easier. I haven’t done this with another person before.” He says, and Draco complies. Harry sets the pillow under Draco’s hips to lift his arse slightly off the bed, which makes him feel
