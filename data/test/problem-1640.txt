"I'm doing this because I care. I never hated you. Not really. I was angry with you when you dismissed me on the train our first year. Of course, now I know what a pompous arse I was, but I didn't at the time. All that I knew was that you had dismissed me for someone I thought lower than myself. I decided to torment you any way I could because of it. I resented you, and Weasley and Granger. I don't anymore. I'm not the same person I used to be. I only wanted to be friends with you back then because of your fame. Your scar. But that's not the case anymore. And I certainly won't stand by while you've been tortured by Umbridge. If you'll let me help you, I will."
Draco had to fight to keep his face expressionless as an amused Harry Potter emerged. As it was, he couldn’t quite contain himself. “Potter!” he nearly shouted, before catching himself and hissing, “What in the bloody fuck….?! How did you…? What is that?”
“SHUT UP!” Draco screamed, enraged past thinking. “
Most who received a bond accepted without hesitation. Would this person do the same? How would they react when they found out who he was?
Draco smiled, “A house is where students get placed together. They were created and named after the four founders of Hogwarts; Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin.”
Harry sighed, "Well? Are you just going to stare at me all day Ferret? In case you hadn't noticed, I'm a little busy here. Why don't you go round up some helpless first years? I'm sure Umbridge would love to have some more students torture themselves under her nose…..Bloody hell why won't the bleeding stop! Just get out of here Malfoy. I don't have time for your pathetic attempts at insults today."
Looking at Kreacher, an idea struck him, “would you be able to transfigure something and make it look exactly like that one?” Draco asked.
Sorry in advance for the long note, but...
After several more minutes, Harry pulled Draco to a stop.
Harry Potter came into our office! Healer Edwards should fire me...no, I’ll fire myself! Yes, I’ll quit!”
Smiling softly at the elf again, Draco nodded, “If that would be alright with you.”
See Chapter 1. I own nothing!
Floored at the casual use of his first name by his long-time rival, Draco forced himself forward, entering the room with all of the Malfoy-bred confidence he could muster.
“Oh, that…” Draco shrugged, “I already owled him. I denounced the death eaters and Voldemort and shamed him and his actions in the process. It was really quite a relief actually. I wrote everything I’ve been wanting to say, insulting him thoroughly and eloquently in the process. I imagine it will be quite a shock when he reads it.”
“Listen carefully, Draco,” Merlin commanded gently, “You do not bear the weight of your sins alone, nor should you suffer damnation for them.”
As grey eyes met green, Draco did a double-take, his jaw nearly dropping to the floor.
“Um...Dray,” came Harry’s muffled laugh, “aren’t you forgetting something?"
Harry grabbed Draco and apparated.
“Okay… but how?”
Draco studied the raven-haired boy. He looked as though his nerves were wound so tight, he could break in a moment’s notice. Draco could practically feel the doubt and insecurity radiating from him, so he persevered.
Beneath that was the immense joy that he finally had more of his parents to hang on to. As he was getting ready to leave the bank for the day, intending to come back tomorrow and decide what he wanted to take and what to keep safe, something caught his eye.
They bid farewell to the forest and gave their gratitude to the Devas. Though the spirits of the forest did not show themselves, there was at that moment a gentle wind that whipped through the trees around them. The forest itself seemed to come alive with the chittering of all manner of creatures and the movement of the trees. All at once, both were overwhelmed as the Devas entered their minds, sharing emotions of joy, hope, and affection. The couple stood together, eyes closed, basking in the warmth they felt from the Devas.
Olivander paused and said quietly, almost to himself, “Perhaps I have been going about this all wrong.”
"I told you so."
Harry smiled. Not only did Draco agree, but he seemed to be excited by the idea. Harry was extremely relieved to have someone around who would explain things properly. “Sounds like a plan,” Harry said, looking forward to getting to know his new friend.
Of course, he hadn’t died.
Harry threw his hands up in frustration, giving in to his curiosity. He scribbled a reply without bothering to sign it and sent it off with Hedwig.
Slowly, tentatively, warm lips met.
Chuckling lightly, Draco turned Harry around. "Look," he whispered.
For the last year, they had kept their relationship a complete secret. It had quickly become a competition to see who could insult and prank more creatively and win their 'fights.'. No one saw the sparks of amusement and affection in their exchanges, or so he had thought.
Harry tried to protest, but Draco wouldn’t let him get a word in. After a few minutes, Harry decided to try again,  “Draco,” Harry said, but it went unnoticed in the other boys’ ranting. “Draco!” Harry shouted, causing the frantic blond to pause mid-sentence. Harry smiled as Draco blinked his eyes in apparent shock. “I’m not angry with you. I told you I would be back, didn’t I?
Draco nodded and swallowed, unbelievably nervous. After they’d become friends, Harry had revealed that Draco had been a "pompous git" when they’d first met. Harry had already been feeling stupid and ignorant at this point, and Draco had shot his mouth off. If Draco was honest with himself, he agreed that he had come on rather...strong.
“But hold on,” Draco protested, “aren’t you supposed to be ancient? Long white hair and beard, long staff, that sort of thing?”
Draco was bewildered and slightly hurt by this outburst. There was no reason to be laughing at him!
, Umbridge’s wand,” Draco said, grinning as the wand flew effortlessly into his hand. “Much better. You won’t be needing it for a while, so I may as well hold on to it.”
Still, as he settled in for his first night with the island as his home, he couldn’t escape the feeling that there was still something… someone missing from his life. An empty feeling in his heart that nothing could chase away.
Harry shook his head briefly, “You’re outspoken and you don’t think when you get angry, but so what? You’ve treated me better than anyone I’ve ever known.”
Harry was beginning to lose hope. Maybe their bond required them to meet in person? He’d heard of bonds where they could only find their soulmate by touch or sight.
The silence that followed was deafening, and he could see nothing other than contemplation on the other boy's face. Draco thought he would crack from the pressure until finally, "Why do you want to do this Malfoy? We hate each other. We always have. What's in it for you? I should think you would be glad to see me injured. Why now?"
He looked at Harry and gasped. He could see it. Harry’s emerald eyes were glowing with love, affection, and hope.
Admittedly, it wasn’t the smartest thing in the world to do, but Draco couldn’t bring himself to feel any guilt or shame over losing control. If nothing else, Draco had been able to confirm something he’d long suspected: his father’s policy on a Pure-Blood being above emotions was completely mad.
Draco gasped for breath as the malevolent force was ripped from his soul… like a living parasite designed to torment him.
Too wired to sleep, and too tired to think of Malfoy, Harry lit his wand and reached into his bedside table, pulling out a small dragon-leather pouch. He clutched it in his hands fondly, thinking of Sirius, who had given it to him over the summer. He extinguished the light on his wand and lay back down, keeping hold of the pouch.
Draco paused, not quite wanting to trust a door that came from nowhere.
“Tsk, tsk, what a shame,” he mocked, “you seem to have fallen, my lady.”
The sky was a cool, beautiful, bottomless blue; the kind that was so blue, you felt as though you were diving into a crystal clear lake every time you looked up. The air was as clear as the sky, brushing softly across his skin and caressing the tips of his hair.
See Chapter 1! Not Mine!
It didn’t sound so difficult; he’d managed to become friendly enough with students outside of his house after he’d defected from the death eaters the first time, and that was under the most impossible of circumstances. Something Merlin had said made him wonder, “What do you mean, ‘regardless of which house’?”
Merlin smiled and shook his head, “I cannot give you all the answers, I’m afraid. But consider each house carefully over the next few days. You’re a different person than you were before, after all.”
But even as the world tumbled into chaos and darkness, Draco Malfoy could only focus on the figure advancing towards him.
Once again, major love and thanks to my beta PTwritesmore who was absolutely instrumental in writing this series, and this chapter in particular. There's a lot in this chapter so if anyone is confused about anything please feel free to DM me! Please review!
Behind the desk sat a pale woman with wild blonde hair and furrowed brows, too absorbed in stacks of parchment to notice their entrance. After waiting for several minutes, Harry considered interrupting the woman. At this moment, however, a tall and slim man with dark-brown skin walked through the door in the back of the shop.  His familiar muggle clothing stood out against the wizarding robes Harry had seen all day. From the white coat he wore, Harry guessed that this man would be his eye-doctor.
Draco laughed softly as he settled back on his pillow, jumping slightly when the humming abruptly stopped and Lyra came to snuggle against his neck.
Shaking his head softly, he returned to the sofa and waited, wondering if he would even get a response to something so ridiculous.
“Shhh! Dobby!” interrupting the near-hysterical elf, “You have to calm down. Someone could walk by!” taking a deep breath, “Now, tell me what happened.”
“I’m sorry, Kreacher, I can’t tell you that. I trust you, but I can’t risk anyone having that information right now. Do you understand?”
Looking at his friends, he couldn’t believe how this was going. He’d been sure that Ron was going to explode again and that Hermione was going to draw the line at not following Dumbledore. He looked at her, his eyes wide, and she chuckled, “I know I’m the first one to go on about rules and authority and such, so it won’t make much sense to you.  Regardless of his intentions, Dumbledore allowed a lot of this to happen and is ignoring you when you need him most! Of course, I’m going to support you!”
Dobby was abruptly cut off from his rambling when Kreacher cuffed him over the head, “Kreacher
“I may not deserve you Harry Potter, but I will not take you for granted. I love you. I love everything about you. It took me months to write that poem, and bring up the courage to say what I’ve known in my heart for the last two years. I want to spend the rest of my life fighting with you, challenging you, protecting you, being protected by you, getting to know you, and treasuring you. Will you let me? Will you marry me?
My Darling; Those were the last words his mother had said to Draco before she died. Before he had a chance to control himself, a choked sob escaped his throat and tears began streaming down his face. Looking at Draco with alarm, his mother swept him into her arms. In between the waves of grief and relief at being held by her again, Draco reflected that he should not be behaving this way. His father had taught him that pure-blood wizards did not show weakness, and his 11-year-old self would not have shown such emotion.
Shaking himself out of his memories, Harry put the pouch back in its place. It was sturdy and charmed with spells to protect the items inside, as well as to be expandable. It was where he now kept the Map, his invisibility cloak, and the photo album of his parents.
Shock passed over Harry's face, and he nodded.
Harry must have seen something in his face because he began to look concerned. “What are you going to do?”
This will most likely be a pretty long fic. It will also likely get darker over time. I’m not quite sure how much as of yet, which is why the tags are pretty generic. When needed, I will change them.
But even as his body and mind had healed, even as he remembered what it was to be free and safe, something was still missing.
“Draco. Was it completely necessary to break down my door?”
One chapter left before we head to Hogwarts!
When they arrived in his room, Draco found he wanted to cry with gratitude at seeing the light and clean space again. He’d only been in that house a short time, but he could still smell it. Resisting the urge to shuck his clothes and drown himself in soap and scalding water, he took a seat in his armchair, facing Kreacher.
He looked at the trunk with curiosity and suspicion.
It was as if the words, both powerful and gentle, pierced through the abyss. In an instant, Draco was pulled from the void; dropped through time and space.
“Ahem. Wonderful to see you, Mr. Malfoy. I must admit I was a tad concerned after the events of this morning. I’m pleased to see your priorities are still in line despite your
Harry seemed pleased with her reaction as well; he released the breath he had been holding and his shoulders relaxed. Harry shook his head and responded firmly, “Not at all. I wasn’t raised around wizards, and have never heard the Malfoy name before today. I don’t know what Hagrid was talking about, but Draco has been perfectly nice to me. I’ve invited him to come shopping with us,” the request for permission implied.
Draco was unable to contain his amusement at the situation any longer and burst into great peals of laughter. After a few moments, he wiped his eyes and lowered his face to hers, a malicious grin on his face.
of all people, I mean really.”
Putting aside the onslaught of emotions for the time, Draco focused on the man in front of him. "Who are you?"
When Harry got to the front, he was met by a mortified Miss Ames. The woman’s face was flushed and her blue eyes glistened with unshed tears, “I’m so so sorry Mr. Potter! That was inexcusable and shameful of me! To think I didn’t even notice when
The world blurred around him.
I thought the scenic route would be nice for a while, but you don't want to just take a stroll, do you? I know you want to let go. You want to run. So, do it.
He frowned as he remembered that the only reason he’d been able to get glasses at all was that his teacher had noticed his tendency to squint and rub his eyes when he was trying to read. Harry would forever be grateful that his teacher had started sending letters home when she received no response. The Dursleys had been forced to act or face questions.
Harry hesitated, “Oh that….I have a map. I’ll tell you about it sometime. Not yet though.”
As he started to get out of bed, a piece of parchment folded in half appeared with a pop, landing right in front of him. Harry scanned it thoroughly for any sign of dark magic or ill intent. Finding none, he opened it.
Draco's relationship with his mother evolves. Draco and Harry meet in Diagon Alley, and this time Draco is determined to do things right.
Swallowing, his voice slightly shaking, Draco began to speak.
Harry laughed at the simplicity of the message; clearly, his soulmate had thought the same thing he had and decided to test the theory. He waited to see if the word would disappear, allowing him to write another message, but it didn’t.
Shaking his head, Draco sighed and waved off the apology, “No harm done. I have my wand now. So, what is this one made of?”
After 30 minutes, Dobby hadn’t returned and Draco was beginning to worry, pacing in front of the shattered steps. He was considering entering the house despite his earlier intentions, but his instincts told him this would be the best way to approach Kreacher, rather than just walking in unannounced.
After pocketing the wand, he decided to move the witch so that she was lying face-up. “
Stunned at the idea, Harry turned to Hagrid, “Is that something we could do?” he asked, hardly daring to hope.
For half an hour, Draco read his magazine, resolutely ignoring the hoarse croaks from across the room. It was only when the toad was finally silent that he decided to look up.
“Yes,” croaked the house-elf, “Naughty Sirius is in Azkaban. As the only male child of the Black family line, Kreacher is bound to serve you.”
Harry and Draco saw none of it. As they made the age-old promises, they had eyes only for each other and their hearts were full of love.
Throughout the morning, it seemed as though the hits kept coming. As they walked, Hagrid constantly threw out words and phrases that made no sense to Harry. He was beginning to get frustrated. Not only was he extremely confused by this point, but he was also dying to explore this new and wonderful place. Hagrid, however, was focused entirely on his task of getting Harry school supplies and quickly ushered them from one place to another.
“But wait,” Draco asked, confused, “I’ve never heard of familiars showing magic of their own. I haven’t given her any magic of mine, and it doesn’t feel as though she’s taken any.”
Draco was going to ask the man what he meant, but Olivander shuffled towards a different section of the store. He plucked a wand and handed it to Draco. Immediately, Draco was engulfed by a golden glow and his body was flooded with warmth and joy; he had found his match.
Harry started to protest, but Draco stopped him, “Yes you did. I was already branded. Marked. A pariah. No family. Hated by everyone because of what I had already done and who my parents were. You saved me from that darkness. Gave me a friend. A home. And you. The most precious gift I still don’t think I deserve.”
Harry closed his mouth. He didn’t think he would be able to say anything anyway. He felt like he’d just swallowed a ton-tongue toffee.
But he hadn't, and this is the price he would pay.
Forcing his feet and eyes forward, Draco recovered himself and moved towards his table. Oddly, the concern in Harry's eyes had calmed his nerves, reminding him that there was someone there to help him absorb the blow of whatever his father had planned.
“What would you have me do?”
Now the only thing left to do was find the manifestation of the link.
“You’re…” Draco paused, “You’re serious about this, aren’t you? But why?”
When Draco had calmed down, his mother gently grasped his chin and raised his eyes to meet hers. She wiped away the remainder of his tears and asked, “What happened, darling? Why are you so upset?”
Suddenly, strong arms wrapped around him Draco from behind, encircling him in a familiar warmth and comfort.
"What do you want Malfoy?" Harry hissed.
While surrounding cells were filled with the laughter and screams of the insane and destitute, the only sound to be heard here was a rough click-clack against the stone floor.  The large brown dog inside huffed impatiently as he paced back and forth, trying to control his irritation. The mystery writer had promised a delivery within a week, and today was the seventh day.
“Why should I be?” Harry asked, “Yeah, you might have insulted Hagrid a little, but it was true,” laughing, Harry continued, “Besides, you cared enough to get angry on my part. That’s what’s important. Not to mention, everyone else acts weird when they meet me, except you.”
"But..."
Draco lowered his eyes to the ground and said nothing for several moments. While he waited for the boy to collect himself, Harry reflected that this was confirmation of his earlier theory. Draco Malfoy was definitely not used to praise.
After a few moments of feeling her embrace, hearing her voice, and smelling her perfume, Draco decided his father could promptly sod-off. He wrapped his arms around his mother and sobbed, basking in the warmth of her hand as she stroked his hair and allowing the sound of her gentle shushing to calm him naturally.
Draco felt as though his breath was ripped out of him as he was hurled across the room. Seconds later, pain and white burst behind his eyes, his head making a sickening
Kreacher nodded and disappeared. It was at this moment that the smell hit Draco’s nose again. Without wasting another second, he threw off his clothes, praying to Merlin the smell could at least be removed from his jacket, and returned to the bathroom where he intended to spend the next few hours scrubbing the scent from his skin.
Without another word, Draco turned around and stormed back into the shop, the door slamming closed behind him.
Merlin clapped his hands together, his face once again lit with a bright smile, “Excellent. I wish you the best of luck.”
Thanks for reading, I hope you like it, and I hope it was worth the wait, even a little! Love and Hugs!
"Told you it would be fun, didn't I?"
Later, Draco wouldn’t be sure how he had managed to make it to his bed, only that he had. By sheer force of will, he put one foot in front of the other. He continued to fade in and out of consciousness as blood dripped into his eyes, causing the world around him to be nothing but a haze of black and red. When he finally made it to his room, he collapsed on the floor.
“Yes, I love you,” Harry agreed softly.
“So... they can turn into sunglasses?”
Hagrid blushed, “Yer welcome, Harry”
So lowly that Draco almost missed it, Harry whispered, “Snape. I saw his memories.”
Draco nodded, “Thank you, Kreacher.”
Despite everything he'd seen so far, Harry rubbed his eyes once and then again, and even pinched himself in his amazement.
I'll try Padfoot" Harry said quietly, "It might be a while, but I'll try."
Without hesitation, Harry nodded, “Yeah! That sounds brilliant! Thanks, mate!” Harry beamed.
Even before he was fully conscious, Harry knew something wasn't right. There was no warmth or weight wrapped around him as there should have been.
Harry clenched his teeth and tried his hardest not to say what he was thinking: that this behavior was far more unprofessional than missing when they walked into the store.
Still feeling somewhat awkward, he looked again at Merlin, who had returned to the bench and was waiting patiently for Draco to sort through his thoughts.
Draco was mortified. He couldn’t think straight. He was rooted to the spot, shaken to his very core.
“Oh,” Harry paused, looking surprised.  “It’s alright, and yes I am,” Harry fidgeted as he spoke, his nerves evident.
“Quit your whinging! We’re almost there!” Harry shouted.
Last warning, MxM SMUT! EXPLICIT! This is my very first smut piece ever. I never thought I'd do anything like this, so reviews are especially appreciated, and I hope you don't hate it!
“I understand, but I don’t think you have to worry,” Draco said, looking at Kreacher inquiringly, “if Sirius hated his home so much, do you think he would want to live there?”
As Draco cautiously peered inside the mystery room, he was surprised and somewhat disappointed. It was nothing but a common sitting room! Why on earth would there be an invisible door to a common sitting room?!
Also, vulnerable Harry! Couldn't help myself!
“So you’ve finished, have you?” he said with a smile as he began to stroke her fur. He still couldn’t get over how soft she was. Draco was grateful that his mother had been immediately accepting of her, and promised not to reveal her existence to his father. If his father found out… he couldn’t even bear to think of it.
Harry paused as if not trusting him to keep his questions to himself, and then continued. Draco listened with rapt attention as he was told all about the press and the students, the harassment, and how Sirius Black had told him about this room as a lifeline to escape it all from time to time.
What came next left him howling with rage, causing the crowd around him to flinch.
“SHUT UP!” Draco shouted, cutting off the building rant.
“No, Kreacher, you’ll have to go back to Grimmauld Manor.” Draco was touched and concerned at the downcast look in the elf’s large eyes. “It’s not safe for either of us if you are here. Besides, someone needs to take care of the Manor don’t they?”
But now that he saw the thread and had felt that warmth, there was no question in his mind. He took the thread and wrapped it around his wrist, signalling the acceptance of the bond. The thread pulsed brilliantly before vanishing completely. Harry was briefly alarmed before remembering… he touched the pulse point on his wrist and watched in wonder as the bond appeared again, still the brilliant white of purity and potential.
Healer Edwards walked over and put a hand on Harry’s shoulder, “Well, you will have a wonderful new pair of glasses in a few moments.”
But the beauty meant nothing.
Severus could hardly comprehend the words, and then his mind swam with rage. “Do not presume to judge me, Draco!” he shouted. “I have no idea how you came to know of the lessons or why you are here defending Potter of all people, nor do I care! It is none of your business! I’m sure Potter had a wonderful time whining and playing the victim—”
His mother waved her hand, dismissing his concern, “I was able to step away for a moment. Your father is still in his meetings. You know how he is.”
Words were mumbled in a foreign language Draco didn't recognize. Lucius touched his wand to the knife, which shifted from glinting silver to the darkest of black.
In truth, Severus had thought Lucius was successful until the incident with the howler. Apparently, Draco had been keeping secrets.
Regardless of the changes in his perspective, Draco Malfoy is not above exacting revenge. Umbridge will pay for her actions against him, Harry, and the other students of Hogwarts.
Draco smiled victoriously at Hagrid and turned towards his mother, “Thank you, Mother.”
Harry dropped to the ground, wrapping his arms around his knees as he sobbed, whispering, "maybe it would have been better if I had just died with my parents."
he grumbled internally.
As always, thank you to my wonderful readers, and I hope you're enjoying the journey (please tell me!). Love and hugs to all of my Lovely Larks. Lastly, all bow down to my amazing friend Kaedmarie, without whom this chapter would not exist as it is. She worked tirelessly to help me work out all the knots running around in my brain.
A second note appeared.
He smiled as he made a beeline for the shower, excited to scrub away years of filth and despair. He still had a lot of questions, but those could wait until later.
Major thanks and credit to PTwritesmore and my Minister of Magic for their input and support!
Relief washed over him like a cool breeze as the space was illuminated by glowing orbs of light, revealing the end of the staircase as well as a passageway beyond it.
Draco sighed, looking at the ground. Harry noticed he had a habit of doing that when he was embarrassed in some way.
as he landed. Draco didn’t know what he had hit his head on. The only thing that registered was the fire raging in his skull and the dampness of blood on his head.
Joy, passion, and love surrounded the couple as their lips melded together. Whatever came their way, they would overcome it, as they had done so many times before. They were together. Forever.
With a sudden inspiration, Draco said, “Yes, Kreacher, there is something I would like you to do for me,” feeling a pang of sympathy when the elf perked up immediately, “I would like you to carry a message to Sirius Black in Azkaban.”
Trigger Warning for mentions of emotional abuse, depictions of the impact relating to emotional abuse, and one scene of extreme emotional abuse.
Sirius Black had been called a lot of things, many of them quite nasty, but patience was certainly something he was never accused of having.
Draco smiled gently and wiped the tears from Harry's face.
"Alright yes, you told me so. Don't be so smug about it," Harry said, his voice mumbled by Draco's shirt.
As he walked, the scenery began to change. The autumn gold sycamores were slowly replaced by the dark green pine until the green was all that remained. He continued following the stream of colours until it led him to a dirt path, then promptly vanished. Harry anticipated the next note that appeared, catching this one in his hand.
Kreacher shook his head,  “No, Young Master, Kreacher will not. House-elf magic will be protecting Kreacher.”
A croaky whisper broke Draco from his memories, “Kreacher welcomes you to the house of black. My mistress would be pleased to see young Malfoy in her home, son of most beloved Narcissa.”
“If I had just grown a bloody spine and broken away from my father!” His fists were now bruised and bloodied, but he took no notice.
"Harry, I know that I sometimes have trouble saying the important things out loud. That's why I chose to write those notes today. I feel as though you and I were made for each other. I want it to be you and me against the world, for the rest of our lives."
But who, and why?
Sobs wracked his body as he curled into himself, unable to say or do anything further. His screams and cries of sorrow echoed through the garden as he grieved every loss and regret buried within his soul.
While only a few days had passed since the confrontation with Umbridge, life at Hogwarts had taken a dramatic shift. It was assumed that Draco was hiding out due to the incident in the Great Hall, so no one was particularly concerned. The main focus of the school at the moment was the fact that Umbridge was no longer terrorizing the halls.
“Yes, Young Master. Should Kreacher be returning to you after he delivers the note?”
It seemed to work. Draco noticed Harry had stopped fidgeting and looked a great deal less nervous than before. Harry returned Draco's smile, surprising him by saying, “Well, I’m here with Hagrid. I don’t know if you’ve heard of him? He’s the groundskeeper at Hogwarts," Harry paused, and Draco nodded for him to continue,"  Anyway, I’m sure you don’t need help, but you could come shopping with us if you like.”
Magic began to flow from his core, seeking his soul mate. As his anger and desperation increased, so did the magic. The air vibrated with it, and people cowered around him, unsure how to react to such immense power. All at once, his magic surged, reaching its destination and connecting with Draco. Although he couldn't see it, he felt their magic swirl together, forming a rope as it snapped into place.
"ENOUGH!"
Draco rushed to his desk and dipped his quill in ink.
Harry with his stubbornness and infuriating way of acting before thinking… Gryffindors must be contagious!
Kreacher’s demeanor changed completely, “WON’T!” he screamed, “Sirius is being bad! Sirius abandoned my Master and Mistress! Kreacher won’t!” Kreacher began to beat himself and howl in fury. Draco felt ashamed; he knew how the elf felt about Sirius, and his loyalty to his previous master was now clashing with his desire to serve.
Even Draco had to admit to himself that this made a lot of sense. No one would think to notice if he was the one who was sent back. Of course, this didn’t stop him from glaring reproachfully at the other wizard.
He continued to follow the river until he came upon an enormous flock of white herons. They were resting on the banks of the river, and, like the deer, didn't seem to notice he existed, even as he stood right across the river from them. As he watched the snow-white birds preen themselves, Harry couldn't help but compare them to the peacocks at Malfoy Manor. While the Herons were beautiful and elegant, he had always found the peacocks creepy. They were white as well, but it seemed… wrong... as though they had been artificially drained of colour. The most important thing to Harry, however, was the fact that these birds were free. They could go anywhere they wanted. No one held them captive.
Draco returned to the bed, flopping down with a sigh. Lyra returned to her previous position on his shoulder and nuzzled his neck softly, before moving up to lick the tears from his face. He was overwhelmed with the gift of having a companion like her, and affection and warmth for his new familiar pushed the remaining grief away. When she finished licking his face, she looked into his eyes and huffed lightly. Draco almost felt as though she was scolding him for his negativity. He laughed and petted her softly before picking her up and depositing her on the pillow next to him.
Rather than rising to the bait, Draco remained silent and sat next to Harry, who looked confused but said nothing. After a moment's thought, Draco reached out and swiftly but carefully pulled the injured hand into his own, leaning closer to get a better look. Startled, and not knowing what Draco intended, Harry started to pull away. This had been the wrong thing to do, as he let out a yelp of pain and promptly ceased struggling.
The elves started to bicker again, but Draco interrupted them before it became too heated, “Thank you,” he said roughly, “you two may go now. My wounds are healed, and I would like to be alone.” As Dobby’s eyes grew wide with tears, Draco braced himself for frantic objections. Before Dobby could say a word, however, Kreacher once again wrapped his arm securely around Dobby’s head and clapped his hand over his mouth. He nodded respectfully at Draco before apparating them both out.
Sorry for the cliffhanger, I couldn't help myself!
Miss Ames looked up in shock, her face nearly entirely red with embarrassment. She fumbled with her wand for a moment before giving it a wave, causing all of the pairs to rush back to the shelves and place themselves neatly in a spot.
When they got to the front of the building, Harry noted with relief that it was just a painting. He supposed someone had used magic to make it move. Harry thought it was brilliant, although it was slightly disturbing to see a large bird of prey on top of a building like that. This magic stuff was going to take some getting used to.
Harry grinned brightly at her and nodded, “Yes, ma’am.”
He reached for the ink, cursing under his breath when he knocked over the bottle, covering his hand in ink.
Draco smiled, and Kreacher looked rather startled at the gesture, “You said that I am the next heir to the Black family line, didn’t you? It seems to me that if I helped him, and Sirius didn’t want to take responsibility for you or the Manor at Grimmauld Place, he wouldn’t have a problem with me taking things over and staying with you.”
Harry was too overwhelmed by the concern his godfather had shown to say more. Instead, he got up and enveloped Sirius in a tight hug.
“He told me to go to the forest and place the records on the edge. He specified that I had to place the records, the diary, and my Heir’s ring in a row. I then had to speak aloud to the forest. I had to plead my case as to why I wanted to visit the oasis alone. So I did. I told them about me, all about us, starting back from first year. I explained that I wanted us to visit for a few days. I must have spoken for over an hour. I was beginning to get hoarse, but I persisted.”
Harry shrugged, “You said something about enhancements?”
Shaking himself from the memories, Harry began to follow the trail. Looking back, he was glad that he had agreed, and had learned to enjoy Draco's efforts. Because of that day, he was walking through this beautiful place, making his way towards a man who loved him unconditionally and showed him every day.
He gasped as he was yanked up and encircled by a pair of strong arms. Draco hugged him fiercely. Then he lifted Harry's gaze to meet his, "You listen to me, Harry Potter," he said softly, his grey eyes shining with an emotion Harry couldn't place, but took his breath away regardless, "I don't want to hear you say anything like that ever again."
"Dammit! Why won't it stop bleeding?!
Draco wracked his brain, trying to think of something to say.
He thought. With a sigh, he plunged forward, “I think you should come and stay with me in Gryffindor tower.”
,” he whispered. Umbridge was subsequently lifted into the air, turned over, and dropped once again on the stone floor.
Lastly, on a lighter note, I wanted to let everyone know the next chapter will be relatively short. I don't know about you, but I really want to see what Narcissa is going to say to the Dursleys :) after that, finally, we're off to Hogwarts!
Draco nodded, his heart glowing from such a simple statement. No one had ever absolved him of his family’s crimes before, past life or otherwise. Even though Harry knew next to nothing about the wrongs his family had done, it still felt nice to not be immediately distrusted.
Draco’s face immediately brightened, “That’s brilliant, Harry! There are so many places you should see! We’ll get your glasses and clothes and then I’ll show you around for real!”
Would they cut the thread completely?
Taking a breath, Harry decided to tell the truth, “Well, we’re friends now right? And what kind of friend would let his friend roam around and fend for himself like that? We’ve already been getting along so well and everything, so I just thought… well you would be safe and…” He felt his face flush.
Draco flinched, then nodded. “One more question. How did you know when I got here?”
Looking sheepish, which was an odd expression on the wizard, Merlin admitted, “The truth is that I am breaking a lot of rules by offering you this chance, and even in death, The Powers That Be watch Harry closely. They would know immediately if I were to attempt to send him back in time, and they would put a stop to it. Regardless of what was meant to be, they don’t take kindly to the idea of me, or others like me, tampering with what has already come to pass. In fact, it has never been done before.”
Draco looked up curiously as Harry took off in the direction Hagrid went. He turned back briefly, “I’m not angry. I promise I’ll be right back.” Draco hesitated, then nodded.
“There are several additional enhancements we can make; they can be charmed to repel against the elements; snow, rain, fog, and things of that sort so that you can see in any weather. I’m sure you’ve already noticed that they automatically adjust to fit your face. That is a permanent feature; they will grow as you do. Lastly, we can charm them to transition, allowing you to see perfectly regardless of the lighting.”
“There were records of this place and its history in the Black Family Vault that I inherited from Sirius. Eduardus Limette Black was a historian and loved to travel to various wizarding countries and communities, learning their ways and documenting their history. Eventually, his travels led him here. When Eduardus first heard the tales of the two lovers, their tragedy, and the Devas, he was skeptical. He came to investigate and found that he could see the Devas, due to his power as a True Seer. Over the next several years, he learned the ways of the people and the Devas. Learning from the Devas, he helped to make the forest and the land around it flourish. As a gift, the Devas gave him their memories. He learned everything that had happened, and he wrote it all down. His parents later disowned him; he had married a witch who was poor and a half-blood, and as such beneath their status. Eduardus didn’t care, however, and he remained in the village for the rest of his life.”
Harry was floating in the water, enjoying the perfect weightlessness of it all when he sensed something...strange. It felt like… a magical shift of some kind? But how was that possible?
He looked up, only to find that his boyfriend was standing right in front of him, shaking with laughter.
He was beginning to feel concerned....was Harry alright? Was he still breathing?
Draco started to protest, but his mother cut him off, bending to whisper in his ear, “Your father isn’t here, and he need not know. You’re just a boy, and I want you to be able to act like one. I trust you to make wise decisions with this money.”
If Harry was shocked before, he appeared to be reeling now. "How….Malfoy….But you…..there have been hundreds of chances since then! If you realized you were a git, which you were, why continue? You've still been nothing but a complete arse every time I've seen you! You work for Umbridge; you've even got that ridiculous badge to prove it! On top of that, your family supports Voldemort! How can you want to befriend me when he's out to kill me?!"
Once again, Harry’s expectations were thrown. Instead of protesting as he thought they would, Ron looked thoughtful for a moment before saying, “Well, how about we eat with you then?”
Harry smiled, “Alright then,” and the trio left the common room together.
Two chapters in one day! Can you believe it? This chapter is shorter because a lot is about to happen with Harry and I wanted it separate. As always, thank you to my lovely readers, and I hope you're enjoying the journey (please tell me!). Love to NoxCelestis, homonemrevelio, lightningspartan1996, mattheb, SowenElf,  kaedemarie, and all of my other lovely larks, without whom I would not have the courage to continue writing.
Harry thought, still hesitating.
What had started as a beautiful winter's day in Hogsmeade was now a complete and utter nightmare. The snow-covered paths were now littered with debris and dropped packages. The frigid air was thick with smoke, curses being flung in every direction. Explosions rang out like thunder.
Harry and Draco meet again.
“Young Master… Master Lucius is wanting to be seeing you in his study… now.”
Harry doubled over at Draco’s petulant stare, managing to choke out between his laughter, “Your….Hah hah…Your face! Oh, Merlin….You should see…..your face! And….Bloody fuck….Hah hah! Prim and proper….Malfoy….Never thought I’d hear….Hah Hah Hah!”
Draco began to pace the room. “Have you ever bothered to look past his hair and glasses? His clothes are an absolute mess, he’s always bruised and thin, and eats like he’s starving at the beginning of the year.” Severus watched as his godson took a breath, feeling as though he’d been petrified. He couldn’t rationalize this, as hard as he was trying.
“You… you’re not mad?” Draco said nervously. “Why aren’t you mad? Aren’t Gryffindor’s supposed to be all righteous and noble?”
Draco smirked at him and didn’t answer.
After dealing with being killed, ending up in a strange place, and humiliating himself by fainting in front of Merlin, Draco has some difficult decisions to make.
“Dear me...of course, you are right...I apologize,” Miss Ames mumbled through hiccups and loud sniffles. Harry’s jaw nearly dropped as she wiped her face and returned to her desk without saying another word, avoiding their gazes entirely by staring at a fixed spot at her desk.
“Er… Good job?” The cat stuck his nose in the air, almost looking as though he were preening himself for the accomplishment.
A week passed before Harry received a reply.
Harry thought it over for a few moments, “It’s a good plan, Draco. But, as relieved is as everyone is, won’t people start asking questions about her absence?”
Draco was lost in nothingness for a long time. He was only a sense of identity, floating through an unidentifiable emptiness.
As they lay together in the field that night, staring up at the brightest starry sky they had ever seen, Harry decided that lilac was now his favourite colour.
Draco sighed and knelt in front of Harry. “I know you can, but you don’t have to. This isn’t right, and it’s not going to happen again,” he said firmly. “I’m going to have a chat with Snape, and then you and I are going to see Dumbledore. This ends tonight.”
“No Draco, it was just a normal root. You were struggling so much you didn’t pause to think. If you’d twisted your foot the right way, you could have gotten out from under it with no problem.” Harry said patiently.
Kreacher looked to where Draco pointed and nodded his head, “All humans is being tall to Kreacher,  but that man is being much too tall."
With nothing else to distract him, Harry became lost in thought, trying to imagine what it would be like to see clearly again.
A romantic poem, a confession, and a question
While it was true that he didn’t want Harry to see him like this,
Suddenly, Harry’s hands covered his eyes.
Would they tie the thread to postpone the bond?
Draco’s answering smile was blinding. Without wasting another second, he crossed the floor and slid the diamond and emerald encrusted ring on his fiancés’ hand, his own hand finally sure, rather than shaking.
That night, when they went to the Room, Draco had nearly cursed Harry at the idea of walking around on a leash. Harry had laughed furiously at the reaction before suggesting a simple glamour. Draco had ranted and pouted for nearly an hour afterwards before furiously agreeing that there was no other choice, but that Harry had “better not watch or laugh when the glamour was applied, or risk having his own bollocks hexed off.”
“So...what does mine look for?” Harry asked, desperate to know after what Olivander had said.
Voldemort's eyes flashed, "Crucio."
And so he told them everything. He started with the Dursleys and their treatment of him, going into more detail than he had ever done before. With some hesitation, he opened up about fourth year, his anger at Ron and what happened at the graveyard, leading him to the summer and his feelings of abandonment. Next came the night with the dementors, his court hearing, Dumbledore, and Umbridge. By the time he finished, it was getting close to dinner time. He was hoarse from talking, Hermione had tears in her eyes, and Ron was looking at the floor. The air between them was so tense, it seemed like it might shatter at any moment.
He smiled in the darkness as he remembered his last day at Grimmauld Place.
Hi! I'm so sorry for the cliffhanger! I hope this chapter is good enough to make up for it! Please review either way! Love you!
“Thank you, Kreacher.” Draco rose and walked to his writing desk, penning his message to Sirius. He would have to pick up some things for the man while he was in Diagon Alley next week. “Here you go,” Draco said, handing the note to Kreacher, “Make yourself invisible, and drop this where he can see it. That way you two don’t have to see each other,” he paused briefly as a thought occurred to him. “Will you need to worry about the Dementors?”
Really, what had death done to him, he thought to himself. It was common knowledge to every pure-blood that house-elves as a species needed to serve. To most, being free was more of a punishment than anything else, regardless of how they’d been treated. Draco couldn’t imagine how awful it must have been for Kreacher, bound to serve and yet alone in this house all this time. He nodded to himself; he could help Kreacher both by treating him kindly and tasking him as needed.
He had a soulmate… and they were trying to find him.
Draco hugged her tighter and thought for a moment; he couldn’t tell her the truth, but he could tell her a version of it. “I..had a nightmare...someone was after me. You...sacrificed yourself to save me. Your last words were ‘I love you, my darling’. I know it wasn’t real but...when you said that just now...”
circumstances.”
“You let me worry about him.” She grinned, “It’s your first year. You deserve to have some fun.”
“Oh, I’m sorry,” Draco said sincerely, “I didn’t even think to ask if you knew about the houses. Lots of first years don’t. I don't know why no one ever thinks to make sure everyone is informed ahead of time, but I personally don’t think it’s very fair for anyone to be left in the dark. First-year is already scary enough, don’t you think?”
“Come on in deary,” Madam Malkin said kindly, “you can step right up here and I’ll get with you as soon as I finish this young man’s measurements.”
“Wait, how did you know what I was thinking?” Draco demanded, suddenly realizing this wasn’t the first time Merlin had answered his thoughts. A quick examination confirmed that his occlumency shields were still intact. Was Merlin simply that powerful of a legillimens?
Merlin stared at him with slight reproach and Draco winced, mentally scolding himself. Merlin was the most powerful wizard who ever lived; He really should have had more tact. “I just meant...you don’t look the way you were painted at Hogwarts,” he trailed off, nervous about the reaction to his insult, unintentional though it had been.
He strolled over and bent down, looking her directly in the eye. Unsurprisingly, there was no fear, only anger.
Now that he could move without risking a hit to the face, Harry surveyed the various styles and colors on the shelves. Looking at the shelves in amazement, he wondered why on earth people would want to wear glasses shaped like triangles, hexagons, or diamonds. Harry shook his head and continued looking, relieved when he found the standard rectangle and oval lenses.
The morning after his “rebirth” as he was now calling it, Draco approached his mother’s study. He wanted to see her, hear her, talk with her, and even just be near her again. As he raised his hand to knock, he heard his mother humming, and his hand froze mid-air. Emotions slammed into Draco like the Hogwarts Express, and he found he couldn’t move.
J.K. Rowling and associates own these characters. Writing is not for profit.
“Oh,” Hagrid said, thinking it over for a moment, “Well, ter tell ye the truth, his mother was right. I was too judgemental at the start. He seems like a nice enough lad, despite his father, and I thought yer may be more comfortable with someone yer own age.”
When Harry got to the seventh floor, he paced in front of the wall where the door would appear, thinking of a simple living room. He focused on making the room feel welcoming and neutral, as well as comfortable. He was satisfied when he entered a well-lit blue and grey coloured sitting room, with a warm fire in the fireplace, two comfortable looking sofas, and a coffee table between them.
“Harry, I know we’ve only been dating for two years. But you’ve been a part of my life, for better or worse, since I was 11 years old. Sixth year, you saved my life. I couldn’t kill Dumbledore, and you knew it. You took me off a path that would have killed me, eventually. After we graduated, you saved me again…”
Umbridge stared at him for a moment before swiftly exiting her office. Draco was mystified until she shouted, “Come along, Mr. Malfoy. I don’t have all day. Show me the room this instant.”
“Hmm, alright then,” Healer Edwards said, letting the matter drop, “Well, I could fix these if you want, but I would prefer you get something a little more sturdy, not to mention better fitting.” Healer Edwards paused, thinking for a moment, “Unless you would prefer to correct your eyesight?”
“He left me alone in his office. I used his Pensieve.”
“Of course, Madam,” Draco purred, lowering his head in a bow of respect, “It would be foolish to allow personal matters to interfere with my service to the school.” Looking at him, no one would have guessed that his thoughts were the exact opposite.
He thought bitterly,
“I’m afraid I don’t speak toad,” Draco laughed, “but I don’t think you’ll be making it to the exit anytime soon. Even if you could somehow reach the door, the toad is a rather slow animal.”
The beauty that surrounded him with each step was like nothing he’d ever seen. The entire island was covered in a series of lakes, connected by small rivers and waterfalls. One of his ancestors had built a series of bridges into the surrounding mountainsides, allowing him to gaze endlessly at the crystal and turquoise blues of the water.
Harry’s responded nervously before Draco could ponder the matter any further, "I...um..."
When he awoke, he was being held upright by random death eaters. Harry was in front of Voldemort, his eyes trained on Draco. As he watched the air crackle with the force of Harry's magic, he sneered weakly at Voldemort, not caring about the blood in his mouth.
Draco observed Umbridge cooly. Her eyes had gone steely with malice, and her mouth was twisted in a cruel grin. He suspected this might be her natural face, as it looked much more natural on her, compared to her usual wide-eyes and innocent smile routine.
Realization dawned on him, “Draco, what have you done?” he asked softly, already suspecting the answer. The cat looked at him with wide and innocent eyes. “Oh no you don’t,” Harry said sternly, “that is not going to work on me. You tell me what you’ve done right now.”
After a few moments, Draco became aware of something.
It was just after 10 pm as Draco Malfoy approached the location Harry had given him the night before. He’d had a rough time getting from the dungeons to the seventh floor, narrowly dodging Filch and Peeves along the way, but he’d made it.
He nodded at his godfather without lifting his eyes from the thread, not registering the words as he watched the magic begin to swirl with the second phase of the Soulmate Ritual; the link. Whoever his soulmate was would have to accept the bond without ever knowing who he was.
“What house are you hoping for? I...well...my whole family has been in Slytherin.” Draco paused. He hadn’t realized it until this moment, but he didn’t particularly want to be sorted into Slytherin this time around. With this thought, Draco remembered something from his time with Merlin:
Harry smiled and waved, before he called, “It was nice to meet you too, Mrs. Malfoy.”
Though the winter night was cold and the ground was blanketed with snow, the atmosphere was one of warmth and love.
He looked up, waiting for the protests and anger he was sure he’d receive, particularly from Hermione, but there was none. Instead, they were looking at him with determination. Ron spoke first, “Of course, mate…” he took a deep breath, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly, “I know that stuff last year set us wrong, and I know that I was a complete arse about Malfoy. I’m sorry about that. I really am. But this is your life, and the way Dumbledore has been acting is completely mental!” Hermione nodded at this, “Whatever you need to do, mate. I’ll support you. Even… Malfoy. I don’t like the git, but it’s none of my business if you want to help him or be friends with him.”
From behind him, he heard Draco growl in frustration. When Harry turned towards him, he realized that Draco was much more than frustrated. Draco was furious. He had his hands at his sides and was looking at Hagrid’s retreating figure with fire in his eyes.
“What h…happened to the bodies? They aren’t buried here are they?” Draco asked, slightly frightened at the prospect.
Of course, When Harry was finally taken to get his glasses, Aunt Petunia had gotten him the cheapest and, in her outspoken opinion, ugliest pair possible. Afterward, he was locked in his cupboard for the rest of the day for the “inconvenience” he had caused.
Ever since Draco had begun to doubt the validity of his father's beliefs, his mask had threatened to slip. Today, maintaining his air of indifference was nearly impossible. As Draco prepared for the events to come, his fears bubbled just beneath the surface.
He stopped pacing and turned to glare at his godfather. “And who are you to talk about bullying anyway? You ARE a bully! Potter was wrong to treat you as he did, but he was a kid! YOU’RE A PROFESSOR! You bully everyone who isn’t in Slytherin! You torment FIRST-YEARS, CHILDREN! You blame them for not paying attention and call them idiots, but the truth is, they most likely fail because of you! Students like Longbottom are so petrified of you that they can’t function, and students like Harry know they won’t get anywhere, so they don’t bother trying!”
Chuckling, Harry shook his head. “Come on now, where’s that borderline pompous confidence I love so much? Did you really think I would say anything but yes? Especially after today? I’ve been sure since our first date. Now, is that beautiful ring you’re holding just for show, or are you actually going to give it to me?”
"Let this serve as payment," Lucius condemned softly, " Your afterlife shall be a torment of regret and despair; a living hell that will haunt you with your failures and treasury..." he paused, plunging the knife forward, "... for all eternity."
Harry came and sat down across from Draco, still smiling. “This is called the Room of Requirement. It’s also been called the Come and Go Room, and the room of hidden things.”
“What you don’t realize, however,” he continued, “is that you were set on your path long before you had a choice. By the time you met Harry, you were set on the path others had set out for you; a path of greed, power, and darkness. This set you apart from Harry and sent you in different directions. If you chose a different path from the start, allowing you to befriend Harry as you desired while saving you from a lifetime of dark uncertainty… I believe it would have the power to change everything.”
He’d chosen the right side in the end, and Voldemort had been defeated.
“Think hard before you lie to me again, son,” Lucius spoke softly, causing Draco to flinch. While his tone almost sounded comforting, Draco knew it warned of impending danger. “Is there something…” he paused, his eyes narrowing dangerously as he leaned closer and whispered, “you would like to tell me?”
“How long has this been going on?” Draco asked, filled with dread as he remembered Harry’s earlier reaction.
Draco considered this for a moment.
He moved over to the mirror and was surprised again when his reflection shifted into focus. He looked around and found that everything else was still blurry; he realized it must have something to do with the mirror. Harry was ecstatic to find that he loved everything about these glasses. They were light and comfortable, and he thought they looked much better than the horrid round ones he would be tossing out today.
Sirius thought it over as he headed for the mail slot, confirming its existence. He would have to return to his cell from time to time, but he knew the guards’ routines like the back of his hand. Now, instead of shifting into dog form, he would simply escape in here.
Draco spent the majority of the next few days alternating between hiding out in his room and working at Grimmauld Place. He didn’t see anything of his father, which he was grateful for, but his mother was a different story.
Harry read the last note over and over again, tears running freely down his face. While Draco showed him that he loved him every day, he'd never been this open with his feelings before. Wiping the tears from his eyes, he began to run, desperate to reunite with his lover. He was going to spend the rest of his life making sure that Draco knew how worthy he was.
"That's correct, Draco," the man said solemnly as though reading his thoughts. "Look there," pointing towards the air above them. Draco obeyed, shocked when he saw what appeared to be a black snake floating in the breeze... only something wasn't right. All snakes were simply that. They weren't dark or light, despite the common misconception.
Draco looked towards the elves, careful not to move too much. He got the sense that it wouldn’t be a good idea to interrupt Lyra in whatever it was she was doing. “Is she healing me somehow?” he asked quietly.
“Can you
“There,” she said, “that’s settled. You go out and have fun, darling. I’ll expect you at the tea shop in Vairtyc Alley by no later than 5. Afterward, we can get some dinner and you can tell me all about your day.”
The Oasis
But...your parents! He…”
Kneeling to the floor, Draco placed his hand on Kreacher’s head. “I’m so sorry, Kreacher. I’m so sorry he left. And that Regulus and Walburga died. You don’t have to like Sirius or forgive him. But he doesn’t deserve to be trapped in there.”
The cat meowed in greeting when he spotted Harry. He grabbed the toad in his mouth, pranced over to Harry, and dropped it at his feet. He turned his eyes to Harry, looking at him expectantly.
His father approached like a tiger ready to devour its prey, his eyes burning with a look of hatred that Draco remembered all too well.
, he thought,
His touch lingered against Harry's cheek.
Draco sighed in frustration and decided to focus his attention on Harry’s arse, rather than the trees. It was certainly a more pleasant sight. Perhaps he would take revenge on his lovely boyfriend later in the evening. He did so enjoy making Harry beg for him. His mood improved drastically as he began to picture all of the delicious ways he could torment his lover.
“Thanks to kissing her robes these last several weeks, I happen to know that Umbridge sends reports to the minister on Mondays. She sent one out this morning, and won’t be expected to report again until next Monday. If we haven’t settled things by then, we’ll come up with something. What do you think?”
“Bloody hell!” Draco shouted as he was unceremoniously thrown face-first into the forest floor.
The dog started when suddenly a large trunk appeared, falling to the ground with a loud thud. Seconds later, a note appeared on top of it.
“Nice job,” Draco said, coming to stand next to Harry. He pulled out his own wand, using it to conjure a small swarm of flies and direct them into the tank. Neither could resist laughing as the toad snapped them up one by one.
Steeling his resolve, Draco moved to his writing desk, setting Lyra gently on his lap. The tears flowed like a river from his eyes
Note: I've changed the timeline so that the attack on Mr. Weasley happened over the summer. I needed to free up Christmas holidays, and this was the only way I could have things make sense.
And it was. What had started as a throbbing in his head was now only a dull ache. He stretched his muscles carefully, pleasantly surprised when the pain wasn’t nearly what he had expected.
The rage he had been controlling up to that point flared to an inferno at the mention of Harry’s name, “
To his astonishment, Merlin began to laugh, “Don’t look so fearful, Draco,” he grinned broadly, “in the thousands of years I’ve been here, do you really think that’s the worst I’ve heard?”
“Very well. Is there anything Kreacher can be doing for Young Malfoy?”
Draco shook his head and stepped onto the stool, hoping that at least his appearance was a little less pretentious this time around. He turned his head toward Harry, trying to think of something friendly to say. He only succeeded in staring at the boy.
Disclaimer: See Chapter 1, I own nothing!
By now, Draco had recognized the blubbering voice of Dobby and the snide voice of Kreacher. He was beginning to feel the pain, and though it wasn’t nearly as strong as he would have expected, the noise was grating on his nerves.
After several minutes, he was finally able to calm down. He sat up, wiped tears of mirth from his eyes, and beamed at Draco, who was staring at him with his eyes wide and his mouth half-open in shock. “That’s just brilliant!”
He stood and walked to the toad, curious at the sudden change in behaviour. “Does this mean you’re going to behave yourself?”
“Well?” she huffed impatiently, “Go on then!”
, he grudgingly admitted to himself, he had no trouble putting up a front for someone he disdained. It was a relief, as he had plans that relied on flawless deception.
“Well…” Draco trailed off, nervous again, “If you want, I could tell you about the houses?”
“Mr. Potter,” Mr. Edwards said a few moments later, his voice laced with concern, “how long have you had these glasses?”
Now that the elf was calm, Draco moved out of his kneeling position, his knees screaming in protest from being on the floor too long. He winced and sighed in relief as he sat and thought things over for a moment. Draco remembered all too well how Sirius had detested Kreacher and treated him nearly as bad as his father treated Dobby. He was determined that things would be different this time around.
“I completely agree.”
While Draco may have lived a lifetime, his mind was currently that of a child. He had to work for a few moments to restrain himself and control his anger at the judgment. The man had admitted his mistake, after all, and apologized. Besides, he recalled that his father’s and grandfather’s wand had both been made of yew, so he wasn't entirely wrong.
This was supposed to be his vacation! His and Harry’s first vacation as a couple! He’d been ecstatic when his boyfriend of nearly a year had proposed they take a holiday together. Yet instead of relaxing in a spa, getting a massage, or shagging in their hotel room, he was traipsing after his raven-haired boyfriend through a bloody rainforest.
Merlin paused momentarily, as though gathering his thoughts. “First, for reasons I don’t quite understand, people were extremely nervous, even frightened when I greeted them.” Merlin shook his head, as though still perplexed by the issue. “After some time, I decided to change my appearance, and found that my younger self, for whatever reason, was much less intimidating. Besides,” he grinned, “why would I appear as a frail old man if I had another choice?”
At his words, Dobby broke out in rather loud tears, “Young master is being so kind to Dobby! Dobby does not deserve-”
“I love you, Harry”
! She was wonderful, particularly when I threw this at her while we were working on something else :)
“No Harry.” Draco said, eyes pleading, “Don’t say anything yet, please just listen to what I have to say first?”
“What do you mean?” Draco asked, confused.
Nodding, Draco said, “yes ma’am,” and Narcissa rose to her feet.
“In remembrance of the love that occurred here and the crime that was committed, the Devas turned this place into a sanctuary. It was originally just a part of the forest, a little oasis in a sea of trees. They merged the trees to form an impenetrable wall. The Bougainvillea, which symbolizes passion, liveliness, and life experience, were trained on either side of the wall and nurtured until the entryway was formed. Like I said before, it’s enchanted. Only those with true love in their hearts can even find this place, let alone enter it. Anyone else wouldn’t have been able to see the curtain and would have been compelled to turn around. The Devas still watch this place, using their magic to transform the area based on what they perceive the needs of the couple to be.”
Surely it couldn’t be healthy if what he’d felt was the result. It was enough to drive a person to an early grave. Draco shook his head in exasperation at his unintentional pun.
Harry had been ecstatic at the prospect of having a place to hide away from time to time. His anger temporarily forgotten, He spent the rest of the day with Sirius, badgering him with questions about the Room and his time at school. It had been the first time in a while Harry was able to forget his troubled thoughts.
“He has a stone in his pocket that I need to get from him somehow.  If he keeps it, bad things could happen. Can you retrieve it for me without him noticing?” Draco asked hopefully. Draco didn’t have his wand yet, and even if he did, he wasn’t sure he would be able to pull that off just yet. Kreacher thought it over for a moment and nodded, “Of course, Young Master. Kreacher will be retrieving the stone.” Before Draco could ask how he planned to do this, Kreacher vanished. Somewhat alarmed, Draco watched Hagrid and Harry as they walked, hoping the old elf wouldn’t do anything rash.
Harry made a mental note of the title, internally wincing when he realized he had been thinking “doctor” this entire time.
“That’s not the only reason though!” Merlin insisted. “Harry’s life needs changing in ways he wouldn’t be able or willing to do. Because he was the only one who could defeat Voldemort, he was made to believe that was all he was useful for, and he came to believe it. Yet it was this exact belief that was his downfall in the end. He should have been nurtured, allowed to grow in his strength and confidence. Instead, he was sheltered, manipulated, and abused. No one, not even his friends, did anything to intervene.”

The shock was enough to stop Draco in his tracks.
“Yeah,” Harry said, averting his eyes and rubbing the back of his neck, “You shouldn’t be just wandering around in your cat form, hunting on the grounds and all that. I could tell everyone I got a new cat. We’re allowed two pets after all. No one would suspect a thing.”
Harry smiled, forever amused at some of the things Draco had been taught, "Sure."
Draco had been ecstatic when they had arrived at a luxurious seaside resort in Costa Rica. He had been disappointed when Harry had told him that they would be staying here for the later part of their trip; they were only there to drop their luggage and their wands. Draco had protested heavily at that, but the Gryffindor had begged, pleaded, and cajoled until Draco had given in, and they’d apparated here.
Draco opened the door, his blood growing cold at the sight of the darkened room. His father stood before him dressed in his signature black robes, looking down on Draco with menacing silver eyes. “Draco.”
"No, Harry," Draco said fiercely, grasping his chin tighter, "Those people out there don't deserve you. Fuck Voldemort. Fuck Voldemort. Fuck them all. The world would be a much darker place without you. You are strong, smart, funny, sarcastic, talented, stubborn, reckless, brave. You are a beautiful person, not because of what you did, but because of who you are. Never again, do you understand me?"
"Bloody hell, Draco!" he shouted, just in case Draco was nearby, "A little warning next time! You know I hate-"
Draco was swept away by images of Harry writhing beneath him, begging him for more as he…
Harry maintained his silence, looking at Draco expectantly.
Draco nodded, gesturing for him to continue.
His soul sang with joy as he felt Draco in his mind. Harry knew exactly where to find him and could feel surprise, love, and then smug satisfaction from Draco.
Shaking his head, “Alright Potter, it’s not that funny. You caught me off guard. Now, will you please calm yourself and explain what this place is? Surely an average sitting room wouldn’t need an invisible door.”
“Thank you,” Draco said swiftly. Miss Ames nodded and returned to her desk.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said, deciding truth was the best way to go, “ Honestly, I was just trying to think of something to say. You’re the first person my age I’ve seen today. Are you going to Hogwarts too?”
“Nicolas waited hours that night, hoping his love would arrive safely. As Luciana approached, his relief turned to fear, then to despair. Her diary had been discovered, and their secrets revealed. She was able to escape with her life, but just barely. She was bleeding profusely, and in a great deal of pain, but she knew she had to find him if only to say goodbye. He gathered her in his arms and carried her to the waterfall where they had spent so much time together. He wept as her life slipped away. She gave him one final kiss, professing love that would last until the end of time. Her eyes closed for the final time, and such was his anguish that he pleaded with death to take him as well. His wish was granted, and he lived no more.”
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a door appeared!
"From what you said earlier, I'm assuming Umbridge is responsible?"
Draco had no such hesitation, “Honestly, Miss Ames. Please, control yourself. You were busy. Harry has been tended to and will be getting his glasses, so there is no harm done and no need for you to quit your job.”
As though they had heard his thoughts, the Herons took off into the sky, responding to some silent instinct as old as time itself. Harry stood and watched until they had all but disappeared into the setting sun. He was left thinking of Draco, and how he was the only thing in the world that gave Harry the sense of freedom in flight although he remained on the ground.
Cushioned though it was, the landing was still somewhat rough, and Umbridge collapsed into a heap on the floor.
“Well, I see they’ve been broken. Would you like to get them repaired? Or, if you prefer, we could look into getting you a new pair or getting your eyes fixed?”
Forever Devoted
"Padfoot I… thank you. For everything. You're the only one who hasn't been trying to hide things from me. You always give me a say and treat me like a normal person. "
“None of it would have happened!
As they got closer, the sound grew louder, until it was at a dull roar.
Harry stared at Draco in bewilderment and admiration. He couldn’t understand how he could speak to an adult like that. If Draco’s flaw was that he didn’t think before he spoke, Harry’s was that he never spoke at all, at least not when it came to adults. If an adult was making him uncomfortable in any way, he usually just stood there and accepted it. Harry supposed it was a habit born from years with Uncle Vernon.
“No, Kreacher. Sirius was innocent of his crimes,” Draco said carefully.
Sirius shifted into human form and picked up the note. It read:
No longer afraid, Harry rushed down the stairs and through the corridor, coming to a complete stop in the doorway.
Eighteen-year-old Draco Malfoy jerked out of his thoughts, staring at his godfather for a moment before remembering what they had been talking about.
Nodding, Draco continued, “You are aware that Sirius was convicted of murdering twelve muggles and a wizard by the name of Peter Pettigrew?”
Draco stormed from the room, fury raging like fire through his soul. Severus was not going to get away with this.
“Why did it take so long?” Draco asked.
“Something is missing.” Draco responded immediately, repeating his earlier thoughts. “I always pushed away the thought of a soulmate. I didn’t think I’d live through the war, so there was no point, but now…”  he paused, sighing softly, “there’s no reason not to now, with the war over. I may not even have a soulmate, but if there’s a chance… a match for me… I have to find out.”
