"Let's talk somewhere private," he said and gestured for them to follow him. He was just leading them out of the common room when Ginny ran up to them.
"You can see how rare that would be," Rowena said excitedly, looking back and forth between the two solemn Slytherins. "Usually either one or the other of the two mental and physical states are achieved. Never in history that I'm aware of has a single person been able to access both planes at once, and this child is able to do that. He is very, very special."
"I need some fresh air," he muttered and opened the front door. The sky was just barely lightening with dawn. It was still too dark to see easily and he stumbled a bit on the icy, slippery path.
"No… I just think we could observe him for a few days and see. I mean, Shadow said he risked his life to get away. And we've heard the Headmistress talking to the others, Ron. The Death Eaters have gone insane from a failed Dark Arts attempted. Imagine witnessing such a horrible thing. Imagine living with Lucius Malfoy. That's bound to turn anyone to our side, don't you think?"
"I know." Draco forced Shadow to turn from the mirror. "Look at me. It wasn't your fault. You couldn't control what Demon did. You were not responsible."
… with anyone. It was unnecessary and disgusting. Why should he? He told shook his head, even knowing his father would consider this the wrong answer.
"Damn right, you will," she glowered. "And when will I meet this son of yours? We will have to test him to make sure he is up to his peer’s level. He will be in Fourth Year, won't he?"
Severus sneered and opened his mouth, but Remus brushed passed him. He stood in front of Neville, blocking his view of the others, and put his hands on his shoulders. "You're comfortable working at the surface level of your magic; you can do this, Nev. I know we're asking a lot. You've never had to cover so much distance before, but Harry needs you. All we can do is ask you to try."
"Hey. Things better now?" Shadow asked once the teen released him.
Expectations for Christmas dinner at Grimmauld Place were low. The house was only half-decorated, most of the Order was either on watch throughout England or at home recovering, and fear of the war and grief over those they had already lost hung heavy in the air. But as the few remaining Order members gathered around the table, they were reminded that not all magic came from a wand.
The little dwarf had met Shadow at Grimmauld Place when he had come to test him. He had been just as excitable then, too. Shadow liked him, but he was still greatly relieved when Flitwick released him after guiding him to a seat at the front. He began taking out parchment and quills when Flitwick called on someone in the class.
A crack sounded and the little elf appeared with a dignified bow. "Shadow is awake. Please serve breakfast now."
! Color it black as all things should be black. Storm clouds gathered and blue lightning snapped and crashed, tearing it asunder - And he laughed! Laughed and pulled his
Amalia liked to bake. She'd send Omi out just so she could have the kitchen without terrorizing the little elf. She'd bake barefoot, and in this particular memory, her belly was swollen. She'd talk to her unborn child and laugh, all the while bustling about making a mess more than she was making cookies.
"Now. Say again, but slowly, yes?"
Her morning tea slid down her throat and she sighed with pleasure. There was nothing like tea first thing in the morning. She wasn't aware that the twins were staring at her avidly. She wasn't aware that a talk with the house elves that morning guaranteed that their potion would be slipped into her drink, the drink she had just finished.
A second shadowed figure moved in the background and came forward. A cup was placed at his mouth and he swallowed cold water. It felt heavenly against his abraded throat. It also seemed to wake him up a bit more. His eyes adjusted to the dimness and he recognized that it was Neville sitting at his bedside, holding his hand. The water-bearer was Severus. Both looked drawn and grim.
He glared with pure hatred at the creature stalking toward him.
"I do. She's really great."
Draco lay propped up on his elbow staring down at Shadow as he slept. He could still see the tear-tracks and he tried not to hear his friend's broken rant repeat in his head. It was hard. The words were like poison. He wished he could eradicate them from Shadow's mind, eradicate what was done to him. He'd heard an echo of Boy in Shadow's little breakdown. It didn't have the same pitch of terror, but the grief was identical. And Shadow wondered how he could worry about Seraphim and want to make him better. They

"Well done, Shadow," he praised his son. "We look completely different."
"All right," he answered tiredly. He wasn't exactly looking forward to it, not when they were acting like this, but it wasn't anything he hadn't expected.
Harry could feel Lucius's fury. He almost smiled, but he forced his expression to remain blank. This wasn't a game, as much as it felt like it at the moment. He could hear screams on the air. The war had begun and he needed to finish Voldemort as quickly as possible.
These thoughts made up the whole of his self-image not even a year ago, but then Harry and Remus had stepped into his life and began to make him believe it
Neville got up and grabbed her arm. He pulled her over to him and sat back down, settling her half on his lap, half next to him. Ron blushed while Hermione smiled brightly at them.
," the last was said with a hateful sneer. The creature's eyes were narrowed in absolute disgust as he stood naked and injured, his right arm tight across his ribs.

"Hurry, hurry," Sirius chanted, voice raspy.
"Do me a favor?" she asked, peeking out at him from Neville's sheltering shoulder. "Tell them who you are."
Harry’s heart thumps in his chest, and he stands up. Malfoy laughs coldly. “Why so obedient, Potter?” He takes a sip of his firewhisky and continues, “must be your nature. Didn’t you do everything Dumbledore asked of you? Of course you did. You’re really such a saint, aren’t you?”
“Yeah.”
“I think I might like blokes.”
“Does the Boss have anything to do with this?”
He goes up to the bartender and asks for a vodka martini, and when she asks Harry for his preferences, he’s completely clueless. He makes the excuse that he’s just turned 21 and doesn’t know much about alcohol, and the bartender seems to understand and spares him some embarrassment. After a few drinks, he finally works up the courage to go and talk to the blonde man he’d spotted earlier. The alcohol seemed to have worked for him, because in mere minutes, the man was pushing Harry up against the wall and kissing his neck aggressively. Harry can feel the man growing hard against him, and in lieu of him not being able to reciprocate, he closes his eyes and pretends that it’s Malfoy kissing him. His imagination seems to do the trick, and the man suggests that they head back to his place. Harry is reluctant, but agrees, remembering that the entire purpose of tonight was to get laid, and hopefully forget Malfoy.
Ronan laughs. “Clearly a humble fellow.”
Ronan seems to be satisfied with Harry’s choice, and nods in approval. “A pretty girl for sure. Too young for me, but yeah, definitely. So, what about her’s got your knickers in a twist?”
Ron and Hermione look at each other and Ron raises his eyebrows. “What makes you say that?” Hermione asks calmly.
“Not necessarily surprising,” Ron answers, “you and Malfoy have  always been rather obsessed with each other.”
“What kind of secrets?” Ronan asks.
Malfoy is taken aback, so much so, that he can't even think of a snide remark to reply with. “Are you offering what I think you’re offering?”
“I’m confused,” Ron comments. “I thought you liked Malfoy now?”
“I’m telling you,” says a chaser, who’s name he didn’t quite remember. “She’s slept with half of the Chudley Cannons.”
Harry shrugs. “Just something about her, I guess. I saw her yesterday. Couldn’t stop thinking about her ever since.” He internally praises himself for the good save.
Harry shakes his head. “Eh, I only caught it because the other guy fell off his broom. Not impressive at all, really.”
“I think it’s more of a lust-driven obsession,” Hermione remarks. “Not the healthiest thing to pursue.”
“Um, Harry,” Hermione begins awkwardly, “were you at a gay bar?”
Harry nods. “Very.”
Harry swallows his saliva and attempts to remain calm while Malfoy saunters his way over to the broom polishing station. His insides turn to jelly as Malfoy’s eyes meets him, and he begins to polish his broom with unnecessary fervor in some lame attempt to divert his attention. “See something you like, Potter?”
“Wait, so you’re not judging me?” Harry exclaims incredulously.
Harry snorts. “Gee, thanks.”
Harry stands up, his legs weak and shaky, his knees wobbling as if he’d just run a marathon.
Ron’s jaw drops. “The Montrose Magpies? The greatest Quidditch team in the UK?” He elbows Harry. “Let’s go, mate.”
During practice, Harry makes eye contact with Malfoy several times, which Ronan spots and makes sure to tease him for. By 3 PM, the coach dismisses the team, and his teammates head for the locker rooms. When he doesn’t see Malfoy stand up, he heads over to the broom polish station. Despite the fact his broomstick looks perfectly fine, he reasons that it’s the best way to catch a glimpse of Malfoy while still maintaining at least a shred of dignity. Harry expects him to move, but he doesn’t. Malfoy remains seated, glued in place, almost as if he were waiting for something.
with him? “Of course not,” Draco finally adds. “You insufferable twat. I just called you in to tell you that you catching the Snitch today, well, helped us beat a record. The Magpies are officially the team with the most World Cup wins in Europe.”
“And?”
“Well, I don’t really have a choice,” Harry says. “I have a lot of secrets that I’m sure people won’t be great at keeping.”
He didn’t really understand why they had sex so often. He never questioned it in the past, but after his night with Ginny, he was wondering how they could possibly enjoy it that much. “Sex is overrated,” Harry blurts out at breakfast.
“He’s definitely trying to shag you,” Ron comments.
Harry pauses for a minute. Why
Harry laughs. “No, it’s not girls at all, actually.”
Harry makes no effort to hide his frustration, and he’s so deep in his own thoughts that he forgets he can use
Harry decides not to beat around the bush, knowing that she’d get the truth out of him somehow. “Muggle London. I was at an, er, bar.”
“I’m confused.”
He tries to occupy his mind, with anything—quidditch, Ronan, what he wants to do over the weekend, all to no avail. His cock is throbbing now, begging to be touched. Harry sighs, and pulls off his pajama pants cautiously, even though there’s absolutely no one around to see him, humiliated by how hard he is. He lies down and wanks shamefully, coming relatively quickly, then wraps himself in his blankets and tries to go back to sleep.
Harry assumes Ronan would be there, but agrees anyway, deciding that avoiding a gathering with his new teammates was a sign of cowardice, a trait Harry prides himself on not possessing.
Ronan chuckles. “That’s it?”
“Albert,” says the man missing a tooth. “Beater.”
Harry is frozen in place, transfixed on Malfoy’s blue eyes, seething with hatred. His heart thumps in his chest so loudly, he’s scared Malfoy can hear it. He can’t remember the last time he’s felt so powerless—nor can he remember the last time he’s ever been so aroused. He momentarily imagines Malfoy bending him over the desk, and blushes at the thought, furious by the fact it popped into his mind, but even more so by how much he enjoyed it. He finally manages a response and says, “if you hate me so damn much, why did you even let me onto the team in the first place?”
that much.
The next morning everyone was excited about the first Quidditch game of the year. Originally it was scheduled to be Slytherin vs. Gryffindor, but since Umbridge had banned the Gryffindor team it was Slytherin vs. Ravenclaw. There was talk from the Gryffindor table of not going to the game just to make a point, but then they decided that they shouldn't add to the punishment by denying themselves Quidditch completely.
“Still." He wrinkled his nose.
Remus bowed. "Of course, Molly. Excuse us."
him!" Shadow argued, desperately wanting to flee but unable to do so. He hadn't expected this at all. He wanted condemnation. He wanted to be stopped. What was Neville doing? What was he saying?
Remus burst into loud laughter and Harry snickered.
"Did it ever occur to you that he may have been moving to help Draco and I?"
“Hey." Shadow smiled, pretending to be ignorant of the tension in the room. "Things didn't go quite as planned. Did you guys get in trouble for covering for me?"
"I guess.” Harry wanted to cross his arms, but knew he shouldn't. His chest still hurt. "For now, though…"
beyond human endurance. Demon may not exist any longer, but Seraphim has his memories. Worse, he
"I did. You were doing your best, but it wasn't enough for my peace of mind. I'm not sorry I did it, Severus. He was going to kill you!" Harry closed his eyes tight and took a deep breath, forcing himself to calm. When he opened them again, there was finally the sadness to his eyes that Severus wanted to see. "I
"H-h-harry?" he whimpered. His brother didn't stir. "Oh, Merlin." he groaned. "I dropped you. You're still sick and I got you upset and I dropped you from my branches." Curling around himself, he began to rock, a panic attack overwhelming him. "I've killed you. I've killed you."
They were released from the Pensieve. Draco stood with flaming cheeks as the two Snapes stared at him. Severus's face was at least unreadable, but Shadow looked distressed. Draco shifted his feet, wishing with all his might he could sink into the floor or become invisible. His nails dug into his palms almost hard enough to break the skin. He had a sudden understanding of why Severus liked his hair hanging loose. He felt almost sheltered behind his bangs as they fell over half his face.
"Uh huh," Shadow drawled, unconvinced. He eyed his father. "And you got on your knees why?"
"Strike at their image," Shadow answered, smug. "We should act casual but serious. Sorry that Katie was hurt, but let it make us stronger. We point out all the flaws in the attempted assassination and point out that the shoddy attempt at my life merely made the Headmistress strengthen security, which will make future plans all but impossible. Also point out that it got our Hogsmeade weekends canceled for the rest of the year, which wasn't a very good move for the benefit of the school in general."
Ron never got to finish his sentence as Neville leapt at him with a roar of rage. The redhead flew backward as a solid fist slammed into his cheek and another impacted his chest right after. Air whooshed out of his lungs and stars exploded in his vision as a third and forth strike collided with his face. His ears were ringing, so he had no idea what Neville was screaming at him.
"No," Shadow gasped. "No… The war… I can't…"
"We would be better supplied if we had the services of an elf."
Although Shadow hadn’t turned into the Dark creature that had attacked St Mungo's, something strange
"Her problem is the Ministry's problem. They can't face the truth because they're too afraid, so they create enemies they think they
Neville writhed, voice hoarse from screaming. Lucius stood before him, his laughter cutting through his brain like broken glass. Dark magic emanated from him as he cast spell after spell at the ice walls. Open, raw, vulnerable, the darkness seeped into Neville's soul, making him twist and cry out desperate to escape the foul magic. Vomit coated the front of his shirt. Its acrid smell making his stomach roll and bile burn the back of his already raw throat. He wanted to claw out of his own skin just to escape. If his arms weren't restrained, he would have done just that.
"Who?" Draco quirked an eyebrow.
"He transformed…" Shadow repeated, dazed.
"I don't know." Draco rubbed his hands together uneasily. "We know the Dark Lord was making Snape Manor his home base, but we don't know if he still is or if they would keep Neville there. They might take him to a lesser base in case someone tracks him."
Shadow looked into his steel-colored eyes. "I'm thinking Harry Potter needs to get the word out."
The voice, thick with emotion, drew him over to a small sitting room. Harry looked around the door and saw Remus sitting in a chair, his head in his hands, his shoulders shaking. Tonks was crouched before him, her hair dark brown with stress and worry, as she stroked his head in an attempt to sooth him.
"Where?" Neville asked. They were in the woods and, looking around, he still couldn't see a reason to be out here.
It’s Easier to Run by Linkin Park
"First Severus and now Neville," Shadow said faintly. "They're both gone."
The next day just so happened to be a very special day. It marked the three month anniversary of when the Weasley brothers had begun the arduous Animagus Revealing Potion back at Grimmauld Place. They had managed to squeeze in time to work on it in-between their studies and the DA, and it was now ready.
“Nope." Shadow smiled. "Well, one down, then. Why couldn't Dumbledore just tell me what the others are?"
He went left, walked down the hall, and stopped at Harry's open door. Remus was sitting in a chair pulled up to the teen's bedside, reading a thick book on medi-wizardry. The mutt was in his human form and snoring softly in a cot pushed against the wall. The curtains on the windows were pulled half-closed, softening the harsh summer sun.
"Why do you think?" Neville snapped, clearly agitated. He stomped over to the other side of the room and stared at the painting that hung there. "Shadow would never be that way. Not after…
"I was in the Dark Lord's mind," he said hoarsely, never looking away from his father, needing that connection. Severus didn't flinch. He stayed strong and his face remained passive and accepting. It kept Shadow grounded. "He cast the Killing Curse and suddenly I was sucked in. He killed Avery. I can still feel it. Before it was resonating in my bones," he whispered, wrapping his arms around his chest.
"We are already in the light of day," Draco sneered, gesturing to the windows letting in the summer sunshine. "And you do recall the last time Shadow went outside, do you not?"
"Severus. Salazar is finished. He wants to talk to us."
Shadow tried to sit up, but he didn't have the strength. Severus was quick to help him. Together they managed to get him sitting against the headboard. Severus pretended not to notice the gritted teeth and occasional sharp gasps. When Shadow was settled comfortably, Severus reached for his barely touched cup of tea and gave it to him.
Shadow pushed open her office door and stepped into the room. The floor was carpeted in a rich, red-wine color. The walls were painted white, on which hung dozens of moving and mewing framed pictures of kittens. There was a love seat - white with a rose pattern - in front of the elaborate and heavy wooden desk. A floor lamp with a lacy cover stood to the side. The desk itself had dollies and delicate china tea cups. Overall, the room was hideous.
"Yeah," Shadow guessed, otherwise he wouldn't have been allowed to wake. "Salazar! Come on! We're waiting."
Neville nodded. He stood there, fidgeting. His thick brown hair was mussed from sleep and dark circles ringed his eyes. Shadow frowned and felt understanding dawn like a slow motion car wreck in his head. After everything that had happened, he hadn't even thought to consider how his brother would feel about him after seeing what Demon had done. God, could he be anymore thoughtless? What was he thinking putting Neville with him?
Shadow answered by loping over to the lifts and twitched his stubby tail impatiently. Luna skipped after the cat with Draco hot on her heels. Soon they were all squeezed into the small elevator and heading down a level. When Ron heard the voice announce Department of Mysteries, his face paled. This was where his father had almost died.
The Order Triad stood at the head of the table in the strategy room. They looked grim-faced and determined. Just fifteen minutes ago, they had been alerted that the Aurors guarding Azkaban were under attack. Charlie leaned over a map of Azkaban, sprawled out over the table. All eyes were on him.
"Shadow!" Neville cried out, panicked seeing his brother's return in
But as they walked to their seats and saw the hated teacher standing calmly at the front of the room in a horrid lavender robe, they knew that they were hoping in vain to see some remorse, some actual shame. Umbitch stood with her hands were clasped demurely in front of her and she was smiling a soft, sweet smile as if nothing had changed. That just a week ago the Dark Lord hadn't made an appearance and freed all his Death Eaters from Azkaban.
"No. I find the logic of Death Eaters fluid at best."
thirsty now. It had to have been a day, at least, (it felt like a week, a month, but Shadow knew time seemed longer than it really was) of being trapped in here. He was starting to get weak without water, sleep, and food - in that order. And the smell of his prison was becoming unbearable. It wasn't like there was a toilet. The corner had to do.
Shadow rolled his eyes. "Well, excuse me. And don't go back to calling me Harry."
Marissa looked up at them, her eyes darkening and her face drawing tight. "The angel… He saved me."
"What happened after Demon went back In? And why did he do that? Why not stay Out on a rampage?" Harry questioned, tilting his head curiously.
"I wanted advice,” Remus explained. "I'm worried about Neville. He seems to have understandably developed an aversion to homosexual relationships and I was wondering…"
was a mother's love. This was what he had been searching for so earnestly in Petunia. This was what he lost the night Voldemort came for him. Amalia was the first mother he ever new, no matter that she was dead. He only had fantasies of Lily, and Petunia offered only a perverse facsimile of motherhood, while Amalia's voice and laugh, her smile and her smell, her love and tenderness was now real to him, known to him.
"Thanks," the teen answered absently.
The Gryffindor nodded and hurried upstairs to the bedroom he was sharing with his brother. Remus and Sirius followed silently. Sirius was still upset about how things had turned out and by the fact that Remus had chosen Severus's side over his several times now.

"Well, it's true! I overheard Diggle talking about it. Then his mother and sister are killed and he has to go into hiding. When he finally comes out into the open, he's captured. Now his dad's probably dead. That's got to be the worst luck in the world. How do you explain that, huh?"
The next morning Shadow made his way to breakfast with Rogan and Miles. Lillian decided to skip breakfast in favor of cramming for the Charms quiz later that day that she had forgotten about. As he took his seat, he noticed that Hermione and Ron both looked haggard. Dark circles lined their eyes, their clothes were wrinkled, and their hair was in disarray. Both kept flashing glances at the Slytherin table. Their emotions changed with each glance, alternating between pleading, worried, and frustrated.
Harry shrugs, and hops into bed. “It was alright, I guess.”
“Yeah, give that a try. I bet there’ll be a cell in Azkaban with your name on it, Saint Potter or not. So, are you going to leave my tent or not?” Malfoy grabs Harry’s chin again, and Harry swats his hand away without another word, although he somewhat regrets it. Malfoy chuckles coldly. “Shame, we could’ve had so much fun.”
The man finishes first and makes no attempt to get Harry off afterwards. He leaves abruptly, not even bothering to stay the night. Shamefully, he realizes that he’d spent the entire time thinking about Malfoy. His idea to hook up with a Muggle in order to forget about Draco was probably his most unsuccessful endeavor to date, and he almost wishes that he would have asked Hermione for advice, but he’s afraid that she’d call him foolish. And that would sting, because he knows in the back of his mind, that she’d be right. Harry has to remind himself he doesn’t like Malfoy, and never will. He acknowledges his burning desire to sleep with him, but reasons with himself that sex doesn’t mean love. Clearly that was true from tonight’s experience.
“But how do I tell her that?” Harry asks. “I don’t want her to feel bad.”
“No problem. Just don’t let Hermione know we had this conversation.”
Harry has never found himself to be particularly attractive, and he assumed all the attention he received from girls at Hogwarts was simply because he was the Chosen One. But considering how wasted everyone seemed to be, he didn’t think he’d have too much difficulty finding a guy to bring home. Harry spots a decent-looking blonde boy from the corner of the dance floor, and decides that he’d suffice. He’s never been much of a flirt, not even with women, let alone men, so he hopes that a couple of drinks would help him muster up some confidence. He realizes that he’s never ordered Muggle alcohol, and searches his mind for anything that the bar might have.
Ron snorts. “Are you calling my sister bad in bed? I’m never letting her live that one down for sure. Watch me bring that up the next time she tells me it’s such a surprise that I pulled Hermione.”
“Then no,” Ronan says. “I won’t. And I won’t tell anyone either if you don’t want me to.”
“And I’m Flynn,” adds a red-haired boy. “Chaser.”
“I really hate it when I don’t have the answers,” Hermione comments. “But I can’t be sure of the right course of action to take until you have your feelings entirely sorted out.”
Ron is still confused. “Why? Were you looking for a hookup? No strings attached sex?”
“So what do I do?”
“It was alright,” Harry answers plainly. “And, uh, I was just out.”
“He’s definitely better than Malfoy, I’ll give you that,” Ron answers. “And hey, I’ve got my fingers crossed, okay? Maybe he likes blokes. I mean, there’s no way of knowing for sure.”
“We know, Harry,” Hermione reassures him. “Ginny is always understanding. And as Ron said, you two will have no problem finding someone else. You’ll always be good friends. But it probably won’t even come to the point where you’ll have to break up.”
Ronan nods. “Yeah, he’s pretty hands-on with his investments especially this one. Scared of him? Didn’t think you were the type to be scared of anything, definitely not Malfoy. But we call him the boss for a reason, I guess he is pretty intimidating.”
Harry had already been impressed with his first experience at the Quidditch World Cup, but the experience of being a member of one of the teams was absolutely incomparable. He was used to the magically-expanding tents, as he’d already stayed in one with the Hermione and the Weasleys, but this was truly spectacular. His room had two queen-sized beds, a bathroom that reminded him of the prefect’s bathroom at Hogwarts, and an assortment of portraits on the wall that greeted him enthusiastically. Not to mention the mirror, that told him “looking good, Mr. Potter” in a high-pitched voice when he’d seen it for the first time. “This is amazing,” Harry comments.
“Well, time to get these fools home,” Marcus says, gesturing to Bryce, Flynn, and Albert. “It was nice having you.”
“You couldn’t kill Dumbledore even with your own life on the line,” Harry reasons. “That’s why Snape had to do it. To protect you. Doesn’t sound like a monster to me.”
“Shut up.”
“Harry Potter? Second door to the right.”
per say. I mean, I didn’t do anything wrong, it’s just embarrassing. Do you know what I mean?”
Harry’s nerves prevent him from returning Ronan’s exuberance, and he replies with an awkward grin. Harry strips apprehensively, even though he knows no one is looking. Or maybe they were. If Ronan were undressing, perhaps he would glance over at him once or twice. That was normal, right? Harry clears the thought from his mind. He didn’t have time for this in his teenage years, and just because his life was no longer on the line, didn't mean he had time now. He wonders if he’ll tell Ron that he wanted to see another guy naked, and maybe that’s the reason he didn’t want to shag his sister.
“Maybe I should supervise practice more often,” Malfoy comments, buttoning his trousers and shirt. Without as much as another glance, he’s off. A wave of disappointment washes over Harry, and he sighs, the post-orgasmic bliss lasting for a much shorter time than it should have.
“Ronan, but you already know me,” Ronan says with a wink. Harry feels his knees buckle, and he’s grateful that he’s sitting down. He blushes furiously, but manages an awkward smile.
“Hey,” the team captain, Marcus, scolds. “Why don’t we start by introducing ourselves, instead of bashing his best friend?”
Harry gives Ginny a goodbye kiss before he leaves, and luckily, she doesn’t mention last night. He loves her—there’s no doubt about that—but thinking about sex was never anything Harry had time for. Not in his teenage years certainly, and even though things are better now, the trauma hasn’t gone away. He still has nightmares. He misses Sirius and Remus every day. Perhaps he just wasn’t ready for this. When he returns home, the sheets in Ron and Hermione’s room are in disarray, leaving Harry with no doubt of what they were up to when he was gone.
Harry tells Ginny the good news anyway, and invites her to the Three Broomsticks to celebrate, which he figures is the best way to spend time with her without having to snog her. He usually orders a butterbeer, but knowing that he won’t be allowed to drink much once he starts his contract with the Montrose Magpies, he opts for a firewhisky instead. Or perhaps more than one. Ginny gets sloshed too, and by the end of the night, their speech is slurred and they can hardly walk straight.
“Didn’t know Harry Potter couldn’t perform a simple locking charm,” Bryce jokes, and Harry doesn’t reply. He doesn’t want to lose his temper with his teammates—he’s not a git like Malfoy. Another reason he was being stupid, letting him occupy his mind.
Great. The question he was dreading. “Um, good?” he answers awkwardly.
“Do you think he feels the same way? He called me over to his tent once, and he...touched me. He grabbed me by my chin and said we could’ve had some fun?”
Harry is puzzled. “What do you mean by compatibility issue? We’ve been through plenty together.”
Keeping what Ron said in mind and shoving aside Hermione’s advice, when Harry wakes up the next morning, he decides he’ll make a move on Malfoy. He spends his time in the locker room pondering how he’s going to talk to Malfoy, only to realize he doesn’t have to. When he arrives on the Quidditch pitch, Malfoy’s sitting in the stands, the top two buttons of his shirt undone like they’d been the last time they had met. Their eyes meet, and Malfoy smirks at him mockingly, and Harry doesn’t know what’s stronger—his desire to slap that stupid smile off his face, or his ever-growing attraction towards him.
“Should I go for it then?” Harry asks.
“So a Slytherin girl?” Ronan answers. “I was a fourth year when you started at Hogwarts, so I might know her. Name?”
Harry sucks slowly, tentatively, wanting to enjoy every second of this. He takes more of Malfoy into his mouth, sliding himself down on his length, reaching about halfway before he can’t take anymore. “Never thought I’d be seeing this,” Malfoy says. “Golden Boy, Saint Potter, on his knees, choking on Death Eater cock.”
He doesn’t see the point in lying, so he nods. “Yeah.”
“You know, the girls.”
Harry catches the Snitch, but he doesn’t think that it’s too impressive, considering that the Spanish Seeker had fallen off his broomstick. He observes the crowd’s reactions, noticing a girl with a massive poster with a moving picture of his face on it. He looks up at Malfoy, who seems to be the only person in the crowd, excluding the Spanish team’s fans of course, who isn’t celebrating. He’s glowering at Harry, and Harry’s grateful that he’s sitting on his broom, or his knees might have buckled and he would’ve passed out on the spot.
Harry gulps. “Each other?”
Ron laughs. “I’m just messing with you, mate. Anyways Hermione, what do you think? Is bad sex a dealbreaker?”
Harry grins uncomfortably. “Why so tense?” Marcus asks. Harry’s once again reminded of Malfoy, and takes a sip of his butterbeer, trying to swallow the lump in his throat.
Ronan sighs. “You’re very secretive, mate. Not a good liar, either, like at all.”
“Just tell her what you like and what you don’t,” Hermione replies. “Or maybe just take a little more control. It takes time, Harry. And especially considering the fact you’re still healing, maybe enjoying things like this can be a little difficult. Maybe just give it some time. But if nothing works, maybe it’s just a compatibility issue.”
“How I treat my secretary is none of your business, Potter,” Malfoy spits. “Now get the fuck out of my office.” Harry’s knees are weak as he stands up. He quickly Apparates back to the quidditch field, not before taking one last look at Malfoy’s stupidly attractive face.
Ronan snorts. “The Chudley Cannons? Looks like someone doesn’t have much taste.”
Harry smiles weakly and says, “thanks guys, i don’t know what I’d do without you,” even though he’s not entirely comforted. He knows his friends did their best, and he was the one who was overthinking it anyway. He still doesn’t really know what Hermione means by a compatibility issue, and while he doesn’t disagree that Ginny would have no trouble finding a new boyfriend, he doubts he’ll have the same luck. Come to think of it, it’s been years since he’s found a girl attractive. Unless he was...No. That was out of the question. This was going to be harder than he thought.
“Well, he encouraged it, yeah. But in the end, it was my decision.”
He washes himself quickly and puts on a bathrobe. “That was a long shower,” Ronan comments, when Harry steps out of the bathroom. “Thinking about the Boss?” Harry blushes, but doesn’t respond. “I’ll take that as a yes.”
Harry gulps. “He’s here too?”
“Bloody hell,” Ron interjects. “First you were shagging my sister, then you realize you’re gay for one of your teammates, and all of a sudden you’re gay for Malfoy?” Hermione rolls her eyes in response.
Harry checks the time. 6:00. He has about 20 minutes to kill, so he decides to take a shower. While he’s lathering shampoo through his hair, his mind drifts to the only place that it had been for the past 24 hours—Malfoy. He imagines Malfoy’s naked body, covered in soap, pressed up against his. He pictures his hands running through Malfoy’s platinum hair, while Draco’s lips latch onto his neck, leaving marks he’d have a hard time explaining to his teammates. He quickly lets the thought slip his mind before it can make him hard. He rinses his hair quickly, before stepping out of the shower and putting on his quidditch jersey.
“Erm, thanks,” Harry says. Since when was the Boy Who Lived so timid and awkward? He changes as quickly as possible, stuffs his clothes in the locker, and tries to avoid conversation. Harry silently thanks God for his seeker position, because he could independently pursue the Snitch without having to stare at Ronan Mulligan batting away the Bludger. Harry remembers his conversation with Hermione and what she said about that “compatibility issue.” Before the rest of his teammates file out of the locker room and meet on the field, Harry reminds himself that it isn’t gay to find a guy handsome.
Ronan laughs. “We know. Looking forward to having you on our team. Your locker’s right there.”
Harry’s never been so irrational in his life, but something about Malfoy inhibits his logic completely. He makes what could either be the smartest or his stupidest decision yet, and drops to his knees.
“Well, no, I’m not saying that at all. But I mean, if nothing works, even after a while, it’s something that you might have to consider.”
Ronan shrugs. “Very difficult question to answer. I’d just go with the flow, if I were you. If you guys ever do anything, let him initiate it. He’s handsome for sure, but as you said, a terrible person. You don’t want to go catching feelings.”
Harry desperately tries to tear his eyes away, but he doesn’t, and allows himself to give in, even more overwhelmed by how much he loves Malfoy’s body. “Who knew that golden boy Harry Potter fancied blokes?” Malfoy teases cruelly. “Not very saint-like of you, is it? I bet the Daily Prophet’s going to have loads of fun with that little tidbit.”
Hermione sighs. “I don’t know, Harry. But playing for the Magpies is an amazing opportunity, please don’t let Malfoy ruin it for you.”
“Your contract,” Marcus replies. “The Boss wants to see you.”
“Who?”
Harry takes a long glance over at him, all concerns of being seen vanishing from his mind. He takes in every detail, his grey-blue eyes, his pale skin, his platinum blonde hair, the silver serpent ring on his right hand, the two undone buttons on his dress shirt. He can’t comprehend the way Malfoy makes him feel, but he describes it best as some bizarre combination of lust, desire, and hatred. Malfoy's eyes meet his, and he quickly diverts his attention back to the broomstick, only to see Malfoy’s signature smirk from his peripheral vision. He sighs, knowing that once again, his inability to control himself had failed him.
Harry nods awkwardly. “Yeah. Of course.”
“Right,” Harry answers awkwardly, and apparates home. Ron is asleep on the couch, still in his Auror uniform, and Harry decides it’s not a bad idea to take a nap himself. He wakes up at 5:30, and decides to once again try to tidy up his hair. It fails for the most part, but at least it looks better than it did before he left for practice this morning.
“But he’s straight.”
Hermione, as usual, was right—but that didn’t mean that he had to listen. He wouldn’t mind learning his lesson the hard way if it meant he got to live out his fantasies, even for one night.
“Well, he’s an asshole,” Harry says. “A terrible person. But ridiculously hot. He kept...touching me. Like, he kept grabbing my chin. And he kept mocking me. He said, ‘do you like when blokes touch you, Potter’ and ‘we could’ve had lots of fun.’ What could that possibly mean?”
Ron snorts. “Have intercourse? Gee, Hermione. Yes, Harry, Malfoy wants to fuck.”
He’s almost tempted to go back to Hermione and tell her he wants to quit, but he doesn’t, because that would be stupid. Why would he give up the opportunity of a lifetime because he might be a little bit gay? This wouldn’t last long, and soon enough, things would surely go back to normal. Harry finishes his shower last, and the other guys are outside, chatting. A wiry brunette boy taps Harry on his shoulder. “I’m Marcus. Team captain, chaser. We all go out for drinks every Friday, but since it’s your first day, we figured we’d reschedule for tonight. Care to join us?”
It was horrific. Maiming, magical bindings, enforced marriages, having memory and/or magic erased; these were just a few of the things he read about. All of them were awful. The dry voice of the author told him in great detail about Mendon Kinder in 1865 who had both his hands and feet permanently removed. He had to totter on stubs, making walking an agony. They surgically grafted his wand to the end of his wrist bone, making casting magic agony as well. The author described the painful procedures in detail. Mendon was allowed no anesthetic or pain relievers. It told about his life after, how it was really just a slow death as the pain wore away at him.
," a yell came from behind them.
Remus smiled and could see why Minerva would be worried. She had no idea why the teens thought the potion was so important, and their meek obedience was disturbing without that explanation. He let them be, promising to see them at lunch. He might as well get started on the article for the paper.
"Doesn't matter," Draco answered. "He's still a threat."
, Draco."
A few hours later, in their third pub, Shadow felt the compact in his pocket buzz. He caught his father's eye and tilted his head toward the door. Severus blinked in acknowledgement and Shadow slipped outside into a dark nook. Flipping the small mirror open, Draco's smooth tones drifted up to him.
Shadow slid his hands over Neville's shoulders and locked his fingers behind the taller teen's neck. He smiled - his two-colored eyes dark and disturbed. Neville paled, confused. He was afraid to pull away, afraid not to.
Tired eyes - haunted eyes - rose to his. Voice thick and needy, she whispered, "Where did th’angel go?"
Everything went black and Blaise froze, his knuckles white around his wand. He was completely blind. Terrified, he waited to be finished off, his lungs constricted, his pulse pounding against his throat. What he didn't expected was a gentle hand on his shoulder.
Smiling sadly, he brushed his fingers along her wet cheek. "I always will be here for you. Come when you want to see me. If you want this boy, tell me and we will be friends still."
"Very well," Remus said and moved into position.
Without hesitation, he opened the trunk, grabbed a fang, and set the diadem on the lid. He felt darkness pull at his senses, felt the semi-sentience scratch at his mental walls. Harry narrowed his eyes and slammed his arm down, piercing the Horcrux like butter. A shrill scream sounded, forcing Harry to cover his ears and stagger away. He quickly regained his footing and kicked out, sending the remains of the diadem sliding across the floor.
"What does that mean?" Shadow hissed, eyes narrowed dangerously.
"Back at the Chamber," Draco answered, looking over his shoulder at his lover. He hid a smile when he noticed the thoughtful expression cross the alter's face, but he didn't push it.
Back in his tent, a very expensive copy of the
Luna floated through space. There was absolute silence all around her. The cold dark carried her effortlessly. Clear white light sparkled in the distance far, far away. Planets loomed before her as gorgeous balls of light. Some were filled with life, but it was all too distant to touch her senses. She saw clearly,
Dedalus Diggle stood as well, his head lowered and eyes averted in shame as he followed Sturgis out of the room. That left nine, not including Draco, Harry, and Charlie.
"Draco, pay the man, please," the Potion Master murmured softly.
echo endlessly in the dark where he slept…
"That's right," Hermione exclaimed, excited. "Oh, I so envy you. I wish I could take advanced classes. I was just so afraid I'd miss something if I just skipped ahead."
"Eleven-oh-five," Remus spoke softly from his corner.
Shadow saw him twitch his arm slightly, the one that still bore the Dark Mark. The teen's insides turned to ice.
"… or Shadow," Fred interrupted, cutting a look at his twin.
"You insufferable, arrogant, moronic
Monday morning dawned bright and cold. Dazed survivors wandered Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade, searching and crying for lost loved ones. Aurors and Healers helped look for bodies and tended to those too much in shock to realize they were wounded. Every able hand helped clear away debris. Death tallies and lists of the missing were made.
"I see," Severus murmured, but he suddenly realized that he didn't. There was no way to truly understand what Draco had gone through, what it was like. He was suddenly very aware that not even his imagination could conjure up even a sketch of what that situation had been like.
Malfoy simply raises his eyebrows in amusement. “I think the broomstick’s polished enough, don’t you think? And by the way, it sure is hot out here, I hope you don’t mind if I just…” He doesn’t finish his sentence, simply unbuttoning his shirt, tossing it to the ground haphazardly, even though it probably cost more than Harry’s entire closet.
“Bryce,” says the blonde-haired boy seated next to Ronan. “Chaser.”
Ronan nudges him affectionately. “Hey, you’ll do great. We’re meeting on the field in five.”
“Yikes,” Harry answers. “Well, why does he want my contract? Is he trying to kick me off the team or something?”
He shrugs. “I’ll shoot my shot, I guess.”
“Merlin, if even Marcus is telling you to lighten up, something’s wrong,” Oscar points out. “Might as well get comfortable with us.”
Harry’s hands are shaking as he opens up the letter, and he reads it, finding himself incredibly disappointed by its content.
Although this isn’t his first time having sex, he feels like he’s losing his virginity all over again. Harry’s completely unsure of himself, and decides he’ll let the man take control. With a blush, Harry realizes he doesn’t even know his name. He wonders what Malfoy would think. Famous Harry Potter, sleeping with a Muggle bloke who doesn’t even know his name. The man makes it pretty clear right away he isn’t much of a gentleman, and imagines that Malfoy probably wouldn’t be much of a gentlemen either. He assumes Malfoy’s not the best in bed, and that he’d be the type to just want to get off and leave it at that, caring for little other than his own pleasure. He’s unfazed by this, however, and finds the idea of being used by Malfoy incredibly arousing.
Burning with desire, he takes Malfoy’s cock into his hand, and circles the tip with his tongue. Harry licks a stripe down his entire length, before finally taking him into his mouth. He’d sucked a cock once before, when he’d gone to a Muggle bar and picked a bloke for a one-night stand. He had done it only to please the man enough that he would hopefully fuck away his feelings towards Malfoy, but this was different. He wanted this to be something Malfoy would never forget, because Harry was sure he’d never forget this for as long as he lived.
“Um, you won’t hate me, right?”
Harry makes his way to the locker rooms at 6:40 the next morning, deciding to get changed before he has to see Ronan in his underwear again. Marcus is the first to finish changing, and he’s holding an envelope in his hand. “Coach told me to give this to you,” Marcus says, handing Harry the envelope.
“Sure you have,” Hermione says. “We’ve been through even more together, yet we’re still not romantically compatible. It’s not like me and Ron, you know, we liked each other for years before finally getting together. You and Ginny...Well, it kind of just, happened, didn’t it?”
“Of course. But that doesn’t matter, I’m a horrible person, and you know it.”
Ronan rolls his eyes. “You? Who would reject Harry Potter?”
He wakes up again at 5 AM, and decides not to go back to sleep. He gets up and opens up the pile of letters on his bedside table. There’s a few from old friends at Hogwarts—Neville, Dean, Luna. He’s too tired to write back to them, so he places them aside and makes a note to himself to respond to the letters after practice. He goes through the rest of the stack, most of them being from girls who were desperate to date him. He makes his way to the final letter, and his heart nearly stops. He looks at the name printed on the envelope again, to make sure he wasn’t hallucinating.
“Surely you just wanted to make him proud?”
Harry regrets being so impulsive. “Nothing.” He returns to his food like nothing happened.
“Fuck, I’m going to come.”
Harry shudders. He was in the bath. He was alone. He’d just won the Magpies another break. He comes to the conclusion that he needs to give himself a well-deserved break. His hand moves down to his cock, and he strokes it a few times, before closing his eyes and imagining Malfoy again. He comes on his hand in a matter of minutes, and sighs, knowing he’d wanked more in the past month than he did his entire time at Hogwarts. Harry finds it foolish how Malfoy kept telling him not to fuck things up, when Malfoy ruins everything. All he wants to do is sit down with Ron, have a drink, and complain for hours, but he knows he can’t. Ron would call him stupid, and he couldn’t be mad, because Ron would be completely justified in doing so.
Harry tries to avoid conversation when he heads back to the tent.
Harry pauses. He doesn’t have the answer to that, because he’s not even sure what he wants. Try to go out with him? That would be a terrible idea. Shag him once? But surely, if that were the case, would he be this hung up? He finally responds with, “I’m not sure.”
Harry smiles and decides he likes Marcus. “Likewise.” He apparates home to see Ron and Hermione cuddled up to each other on the couch, watching a Muggle TV show, while Ron expresses his confusion.
Even though Harry doesn’t know the girl, he feels the need to defend her. “Sod off, Malfoy, she’s working for you. Show her some respect.”
But Ginny’s his girlfriend of four years. Having sex wouldn’t be a big deal. He knows Ron and Hermione do it all the time. Not because Hermione’s silencing charms fail, because nothing of Hermione’s ever fails, but because Ron tells him about it. He and Ron had become pretty accustomed to telling each other everything by now. So Harry lets Ginny seduce him. He didn’t really have any expectations, but by the end of it, he was sorely disappointed.
“Well, I got over Malfoy quick,” Harry says, the words leaving a sour taste in his mouth. That was perhaps the biggest lie he’s ever told. “So, back to Ronan.”
Two days later, the fans arrive, and Ron, Hermione, and Ginny also come along to support him. As happy as he is to have them here, he’s grateful that he has an excuse to avoid talking to them. He knows they’re going to ask why he’s been so distant lately, and telling them that he’s still crushing on Malfoy was the last thing he wanted to do. He was already stupid for even finding him attractive in the first place, but being hung-up over him for a month was much, much worse.
Harry nods curtly and makes his way to the office. He nearly wets himself when he opens the door. “M-malfoy?” But this isn’t the Malfoy he remembers from Hogwarts. This isn’t the pointy-faced Malfoy that always used far too much hair gel. This Malfoy radiated authority and dominance that made Harry’s knees buckle. He’s wearing a suit that looks like it was perfectly tailored to fit him, and his blue eyes are as icy and piercing as ever. This Malfoy was gorgeous. Harry quickly sits down before he can do anything stupid.
Harry wants to give Marcus a hug for sparing him from the embarrassment, and also coming up with a decent excuse for refusing to give details about his relationships with girls. Hopefully, he could survive the next hour. Despite the fact it stated on his contract that the members of Montrose Magpies weren’t allowed to drink heavily because they needed to be in peak physical condition at all times, it didn’t stop half of his teammates from getting wasted.
Malfoy stands up, resting a hand on the armrest of Harry’s chair, and placing the other one underneath Harry’s chin. Harry freezes, his heart pounding in his chest. He should push him away, but he can’t. He sits there, completely still, his eyes transfixed on Malfoy. “You bastard,” Malfoy snarls. “You arrogant bastard. Think I’ve asked you here to
“Hermione, you’re a miracle worker,” Harry comments and she grins. Surprisingly, Ron was the only out of the three that found a decent job after finishing up their 8th year at Hogwarts. Hermione hated the ministry with a passion, and Harry decided that he didn’t really want to be an Auror, and that his desire to be one in the past the result of him being squeezed into the mold of a “hero.” Although Hermione admittedly wasn’t much of an athlete, Harry suggested she become a manager for aspiring professional quidditch players. Initially, of course, she thought it was a horrible idea, but Hermione’s wisdom ensured that she found success right away.
“Yeah, an asshole, but not evil. I never saw you as evil.”
Ronan tosses him a towel and says with a grin, “there’s an empty shower over there. You smell.”
Figuring there was no use in hiding it, he sighs, and prepares to unload.
Harry wakes up early the next morning, something he hasn’t done in a while. Professional sports, even quidditch, was no walk in the park. The coach had requested everyone be present by 7 AM sharp, so Harry woke up at 6, had a quick breakfast, before standing in front of the mirror and trying to get his hair in order to no avail. He makes his way to the locker rooms at 6:50, and when he walks in, it sounds more like a pub than a changing space for athletes. When he walks in, the chatter stops abruptly, and everyone turns around and greets him.
“I’m just so frustrated,” Harry says, “with myself, with everything. I can’t stop thinking about Malfoy. I get upset when he doesn’t talk to me, although when he does talk to me, he’s just insulting me. It’s stupid, I know.”
Draco was bored and horny and had no intention of doing this again. Maybe their conversation would ensure that they were no longer enemies, but definitely not friends. And most certainly not lovers.
“R-right,” Harry replies, shaking his hand quickly. He lets go as fast as he can, not because he doesn’t appreciate the physical contact, but because he’s sweating. “I’m Harry Potter,” he adds impulsively, and then internally scolds himself.
Harry Apparates back home, and realizes that it’s midnight. Hermione and Ron are still on the couch, and they immediately bombard him with a barrage of questions. “Where were you?” Hermione inquires worriedly, and Ron adds, “how was practice?”
“Sounds good. See you later.”
Harry raises his eyebrows. “What’s this?”
Harry shakes his head. “Nah. It’s not necessarily
He checks the backside to see if there was anything more, and sighs. Malfoy had sent him a waiver, the same one that was sent to every player on every team that participated in the World Cup. Harry asks himself what exactly he was expecting—a letter of apology? A declaration of love? He shakes his head. He was being stupid. He fills out the blanks, folds it neatly into an envelope, and hands it to his owl. Harry decides to respond to all the letters now to pass the time, even writing back to a few love-crazed girls.
“I don’t
“Well, he doesn’t like me much, let’s just say that,” Harry replies, and occupies himself with polishing his broomstick, even though it’s not necessary. When Ronan comes around the corner, he’s not so impressed anymore. He feels incredibly stupid. Ronan was handsome, athletic, and a decent human being. Why the hell was he all of a sudden so fixated on someone like Malfoy, who was a complete and utter asshole, who would gladly date anyone in the world before him?
He smiles weakly. “Thank you for thinking that way about me, but really, a lot of people. Perhaps everyone who’s ever been a Slytherin?”
Ronan takes a surprisingly sympathetic approach. “Don’t be like that, mate, what’s wrong? Girl problems?”
Ronan laughs. “What, did you hex the other team?”
He hardly manages an orgasm, which makes him feel incredibly guilty. He knows Ginny deserves so much better, and he wonders if there’s something wrong with him. He wants to talk to Ron, but this is sister. Certainly it would be too awkward. Harry stays the night with Ginny. He wants to apologize, but he doesn’t know how. How do you tell your girlfriend you love her, but she just doesn’t satisfy you, and you’re sorry if she feels bad about herself for it? That’s right, you can’t.
Harry sighs, and prays that Ron’s right.
Harry nods. “Yeah.”
he doing this? He supposes he doesn’t really care to convince Malfoy that he wasn’t such a terrible person after all, and more to justify to himself that it was alright to want to shag him. He doesn’t want to tell Malfoy that of course, so he remains silent.
Ron is puzzled. “Why a Muggle bar?”
Hermione elbows him. “Ronald, for once, could you try to be more considerate?”
“How about you, Potter?”  Flynn chips in. “How’s your love life going?”
When Harry heads back to the tent, he’s met with a barrage of praise from his teammates, which he can only respond to with a quick nod and half-smile. The Keeper, Oscar, nudges him lightly. “What’s up, mate? You won us the game!”
“Good news,” Hermione begins, sitting down at the table and joining Ron and Harry for dinner. “The seeker of the Montrose Magpies just came down with Dragon Pox. Which means they have an opening. And they want you.”
“What did you call me here for anyway, Malfoy?” Harry spits back.
Harry meets up with Ron anyway, and tells him 80% of the truth, not bothering to leave out any details, except just replacing Malfoy’s name with Ronan’s. “So I don’t know what to do,” Harry was saying. “Because he’s clearly straight.”
“Any hits about who this lucky lady is?” Flynn adds.
Marcus raises his eyebrows from the other side of the locker room. “Who could hate you?”
Harry reminds himself. Malfoy straightens his tie, and despite the thousands of people surrounding them, Harry feels like he’s staring directly at him. Their eyes meet, and Harry shudders, under Malfoy’s intimidating, yet unfathomably attractive, glare. He can hear Malfoy’s voice in his head saying, “
Harry looks up at him eagerly. “Come on my face.”
“Of course it isn’t,” she answers. “I don’t think anyone’s naturally bad in bed. Everyone can learn. And if there are people who were just born to suck in the bedroom, it’s not Ginny, that’s for sure.”
Harry smiles. “Thanks.”
“Not that I’m aware of,” Harry answers with a smile.
“Yeah, I guess,” Harry answers lamely. “So you think we’re not meant for each other?”
Ronan snorts. “No way. Would have never guessed. So you’ve got really bad girl problems? Let me guess, you like some chick that’s way older than you. Mommy issues?”
“My bad,” Malfoy retorts. “Famous Harry Potter is a bit of a bad boy.”
With a few strokes Malfoy comes, coating Harry’s face in streams of sticky white liquid. Harry allows his come to stay on his face for a while, licking his lips and tasting it. Harry mutters a quick cleaning charm, because as much as he loves being covered in Malfoy, he doesn't want to return home to Ron and Hermione with  come all over his face. “Take off your trousers,” Draco orders. “I want to get you off too.”
Harry finally meets Draco, meaning, the fun begins now.
Harry blushes furiously. “I mean the Dark Mark.”
Something about Malfoy calling him a slut makes his cock twitch in his pants. Harry considered himself to be more of a power bottom than a submissive one from his previous experience at the bar the other night, but there was something about Malfoy that made him want to submit completely. Harry sucks Malfoy’s cock furiously, taking as much as he can each time, occasionally swirling his tongue around the tip. Malfoy’s not talking anymore, letting out deep, ragged moans that drive Harry to the point of insanity.
Draco rolls his eyes. “It was my stupid secretary. She’s a whore, anyway, I don’t know why I hired her.”
Malfoy nods. “A lot. What’s it to you? I was nothing but an asshole to you.”
Hermione suggest he break up with Ginny, and despite his reluctance to hurt her feelings, he knows it’s for the best. After all, he knows that she deserves a man that would genuinely want her, romantically, anyway. She’s heartbroken, of course, but as usual, she’s understanding. She acknowledges the fact that his sexuality would have been the least of his concerns in his teenage years, and thanks him for ending their relationship before having an affair with a bloke. She offers her unconditional support, and Harry questions what he ever did to deserve someone like Ginny. He remembers her saying,  “Well, I’m always here, so if you ever need to bitch about how some guy did you wrong, call me,” and smiles fondly.
Marcus shrugs. “I’m not sure. I have no idea why he would want to kick you off the team, you’re way better than our other Seeker. If we ever lost, it was because he couldn’t catch the damn Snitch. Well, Coach and I will see what we can do.”
The Quidditch World Cup does provide him with some much-needed distraction from his nearly month-long moping over Malfoy. Being Harry Potter had its advantages—he got first pick for his roommate. He debates between Ronan and Marcus. He decides on Ronan. He was pretty easy to talk to, and also the only bloke that could even compete with Malfoy for his attention.
“Haven’t grown up much have you, Potter? Not how you speak to someone you want to shag.”
He wants to make a good impression on his teammates, which he luckily does, by trying to focus on anything but his new incredibly attractive teammate. By the end of practice, he’s sore, sweaty, and thoroughly exhausted. The majority of his teammates used the showers in the locker room, including Ronan, but he thought maybe he’d pass this time. He wasn’t sure he could resist the temptation to glance over at Ronan a couple of times. “Hey, Potter!” Ronan jokes affectionately. “You stink.” He’s reminded of those stupid “Potter Stinks” badges from fourth year that he assumed were made by none other than Draco Malfoy, and his stomach flips.
“Of course,” Malfoy continues, “I tried tearing up your contract. But the stupid things are charmed.” He takes Harry’s contract from the envelope, rips it apart, only for the pieces to reassemble again. “I own the Magpies, but I don’t own the entire league, so there’s nothing I can do to kick you out now.” Malfoy slams his hand on the table, and while leaning forward towards Harry, he practically spits, “so don’t fuck it up, Potter, or your quidditch career will be over faster than you can wipe the drool off your chin.”
“Don’t think I won’t hex you into another dimension,” Harry growls.
“Embarrassing ones.”
Ronan laughs. “Yeah, he’s pretty handsome. But that’s kind of a strange comment to make.”
“Amelia McMillan,” Bryce answers. “She’s a waitress here. I hooked up with her at least year’s championships, and now she’s writing to me again for some reason.”
Harry blushes. “So, you know, nobody would know who I am.”
Harry’s meeting Draco next chapter y’all
Hermione raises an eyebrow and sighs. “What happened? Were the guys jerks?”
Harry chuckles weakly, and follows his teammates into the living room. He’s busy removing his protective gear when the coach walks in. “Hey Potter, Boss wants you. First tent to the left, the big one.”
“I’m absolutely terrified.”
Harry sighs. “I want to quit quidditch.” Before Ron and Hermione have time to respond, he continues. “Just when I think it couldn’t get any worse. Malfoy owns the Magpies. He called me into his office today to tell me not to fuck anything up. And Merlin, he’s bloody gorgeous now. So, I went to the bar, to, er, try to get my mind off of him. Didn’t really work.”
Ron shrugs. “Yeah, well, you don’t
Draco moans. “Oh fuck…” Harry, motivated by the encouragement, tries to take Malfoy down his throat again. He gets farther than last time, but he’s still a few inches away from the base. “You’re such a fucking slut, Potter.”
“Well, spill,” Bryce replies.
While he lathers shampoo through his hair, he gives into temptation, and sees Ronan stepping out of the shower, his blonde hair damp and a towel wrapped around his lower body. His heart thumps in his chest, and he feels blood rushing to his cock. Harry winces in humiliation, even though he’s pretty sure nobody noticed. He should’ve known this before joining an all-male sports team. But then again, he’d never had time to think about things like his sexuality. How would he ever face Ronan again, knowing that he had inadvertently made him hard? Harry vows to never use the showers in the locker room ever again, even if his odor could be smelt from a mile away.
The ministry had paid all three of them a larger sum of money they’d ever need after the war as some sort of hero award, but they still seeked out employment options anyway, as days sitting at home had become monotonous. They decided to buy a flat big enough for the three of them situated in between Muggle London and the wizarding world, which worked out for them, since they traveled almost exclusively by Floo Powder.
Harry decides to make his presence known before barging in. Malfoy replies with a particularly spiteful, “come in, Potter.” When he enters, Draco is sitting in a lounge chair, his jacket hanging on the chair next to him, with the top two buttons of his dress shirt unbuttoned. A half-finished glass of firewhisky sits on the table beside him. Harry gulps and sits down, to which Malfoy answers, “did I say that you could make yourself comfortable?”
“Surprised you’re not shoving my hands off of you,” he continues, and Harry pushes him away. Malfoy scoffs. “If I didn’t know any better, I would’ve thought you enjoyed that. Do you like when blokes touch you, Potter?”
Harry grins. “You’re a lifesaver Ronan, you really are.”
“Did you kill my entire family?” Ronan jokes.
“Oh, sorry, the guy who owns the team,” Marcus clarifies. “We call him the Boss. Major pain in the ass.”
“Fuck,” Malfoy says with a breathy sigh. “Goddamnit, yes.”
“You told me I just wanted to shag him.”
happened today?”
Malfoy laughs humorlessly. “Someone clearly hasn’t grown up. Anyways, I came here to tell you not to fuck things up like you normally do.”
“So they have a really good Keeper,” Marcus was saying. “I think we’ll be alright, but we should definitely get the Snitch to secure our victory. You think you can do that, Harry?”
to open his locker, and he struggles with it for a minute or two, before kicking it aggressively.
When Harry enters the Three Broomsticks, his teammates are already seated and waving enthusiastically, including Ronan. Well, being the Chosen One did have its perks. Harry had spent the entirety of his childhood neglected by Dursleys and trying not to die, so he wasn’t really aware of what “normal” guys talked about. Probably quidditch and girls.  Harry would certainly have trouble making contributions to the latter.
Harry thinks he’s at least semi-decent at controlling his mouth, but blurts out, “um, Malfoy’s kind of hot, don’t you think?”
“How did the meeting with the Boss go?” Ronan asks when Harry gets back.
He looks around at the assortment of guys in the bar, not overwhelmed with his options. Most of them were completely inebriated, while one couple was engaging in activities he thought would have been more appropriate behind closed doors. Harry scans the bar for any blondes, and sighs, feeling defeated and completely pathetic. He imagines what Ron would say if he told him he’d hook up with anyone who bore a slight resemblance to Draco Malfoy.
“Of course not,” Ronan replies. “Your secret is safe with me. Albert gives me homophobic vibes to be honest, so if you ever want to come out, please be careful.”
Harry performs worse than usual, but not all that much. He blames Malfoy for it, and he believes his blame is correctly placed. When he takes a shower, he doesn’t bother glancing secretly at Ronan. Harry Apparates home without saying goodbye to his teammates, far too frustrated for being mannerly. Ron’s staying late for an Auror mission, and as usual, Hermione was busy slaving away in her office, so Harry heads upstairs to bed, even though he knows he won’t be able to sleep.
Even after four years together, Harry and Ginny had never had sex. They’ve discussed it, sure, but Harry’s always told her he was too nervous. Ginny is understanding. She always is. She tells him that whenever he’s ready, she is. Tonight was different, however. Harry’s never been more drunk in his life, and based on the way she was acting, he assumed Ginny hadn't either. He’s resisted the Imperius curse—surely he could resist the effects of alcohol.
“Don’t worry about it, mate,” Ron adds. “It’s unlikely that you guys won’t figure it out. And worst case scenario, she’ll have no trouble finding a new boyfriend. And you’ll have no trouble finding a new girlfriend.”
Malfoy drags Harry over the shed where his teammates had stored their broomsticks, and they both sit down. Harry happily complies with Malfoy’s command, using a spell to remove his clothing. His cock is aching and throbbing, and when Malfoy closes his hand around his length, he almost can’t take it. Draco’s strokes are long and teasing, but feel incredible. Harry moans shakily, and Draco picks up the pace, filling Harry with white-hot pleasure. He’d wanked in his room plenty of times, but it never felt anything like this. Maybe it was the fact that it was Malfoy’s hand instead of his own that was making this so intense. He comes embarrassingly fast, but Malfoy doesn’t seem to be bothered, and he licks Harry’s come right off his hand.
“No problem,” Ron replies with a grin. “Until you get laid, wank yourself raw, mate.”
“You just want to shag him, mate,” Ron adds. “Believe me, when you just want to shag someone, you get over it really fast. Give it a week and you’ll be fine.”
him, do I?” Harry inquires. “I mean, how do you like
“Well, I, er, thinkimightlikeblokes.”
"I think Malfoy’s hot.”
“I am,” he replies. “It’s just…”
Harry turns red in the face. “R-right. O-only the girls.” He internally reprimands himself.
Harry blushes furiously. “Y-yeah. Just popped into my head for some reason.”
“What?”
Hermione immediately turns off the TV and greets Harry. “So, how was the first day?”
“Please don’t, Ron.”
“Well, I better Apparate you there, don’t you think?” Marcus holds out his arm, and Harry takes it, Disapparating once he’s in the building. Harry finds himself in a waiting room, foolishly dressed in comparison to the receptionists and the other people filing in and out of the room. Harry twiddles with his thumbs for the next five minutes, embarrassed by being in his quidditch uniform, until a lady with oddly-shaped glasses and overdrawn lipstick calls his name.
Ronan raises his eyebrows. “Looks like he wants to shag you.”
“But that’s beside the point,” Hermione adds. “He probably does want to, um, have intercourse, but…”
“I’m straight,” Ronan says. “I don’t do that.”
“Um, there’s this person, I think they’re really cute,” Harry begins. Gender-neutral terms would work. He didn’t have to lie, and nobody couldn’t accuse him of being gay. “I doubt they’d even look in my direction, to be honest.”
The fans begin filing into the stadium, the box seats still empty, as they were reserved for special guests. Harry had reserved three of them for Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, and they arrive in a few minutes, waving to him enthusiastically. A few more people arrive, which Harry assumes are his teammates’s friends and family. Three suited men have a seat, and Harry gulps when the final man has a seat.
“We’re alone, aren’t we?” Harry answers. “May I?”
Harry doesn’t know what to make of this. His head was spinning in a combination of both post-orgasmic bliss and shock. He thinks about the way he wants Malfoy to take him next time, before deciding to come to his senses.
“Well, listen,” Ronan replies. “I wish you the best of luck. I doubt she’d say no to you, for real. But hey, the Quidditch World cup is in three weeks. Something to look forward to, right?”
He regarded her thoughtfully. They stood at almost the same height. He was only slightly taller than her, so it was easy for him to study her eyes. "Me and a few others that I know are planning on getting together and practicing defense on our own. There are concerns that we won't be skilled enough should something happen, and there are the OWLs and NEWTs to prepare for."
Neville laughed. "Pretty normal. I'm not noticed very much, like usual. Ginny and I get to spend time together again. Hermione's happy and frustrated with her boyfriend being here and a teacher. Ron is more depressed than I've ever seen him. The twins are being very mysterious, more so than normal." He glanced at Shadow. "Know why?"
Saturated with the Earth, Neville communicated his need to help restore the balance. Something unlocked and he felt all of Hogwarts grounds as if it were his own body. The aggressors held a distinct feel, disrupting the life web of this area, and he lashed out with limb and root, with angry warning tremors that knocked the Death Eaters off balance. Neville felt no joy at this destruction, only a grim focus to protect life as he knew it.
He didn't get any visitors. The three boys in his year kept their doors firmly shut. Draco wasn't as lucky. Students from Fifth-year and up dropped by the blond's room, asking subtle questions about why he turned to the Light side and also wondering what the relationship was between Severus and Shadow. Were they father and son? Uncle and nephew? Was he adopted?
"Okay, this way," Shadow said and led them forward. There were gasps of awe as a door materialized in front of them. Shadow turned the handle and gestured for everyone to go inside.
Severus bowed his head in acquiescence. "I will remain downstairs."
"It has to go in the matching hole," he reminded encouragingly.
And he was right to be worried. Ron and Hermione were handling his revelation too well. They sat down again and they asked Shadow what he had been up to. Within minutes, Hermione was asking why he told Neville the truth and not them while Ron was questioning why he was in Slytherin and getting so friendly with the snakes, Draco in particular.
Shadow was furious. Voldemort was dead!
First, he stretched his hoodie over his knees. It felt like this might work, but then it didn't. The cold seeped right on through. Then he worked his hands up and down his arms; blew his stuttering breath over his fingers. His core temperature dropped and his breath failed to warm them. His hands grew number until he could no longer feel them. The panic attack built slowly as one thing after another failed to work to warm him up, and then the flashbacks had come.
"Maybe not," Shadow agreed. He grabbed his book and flipped it open roughly.
"But T-Tom killed his father last, I think… Yes, he wanted his father to s-suffer, so he made him watch as he killed his grandparents. He killed his grandfather and put the piece of his s-soul that broke away into a ring that represented his Pureblooded heritage, which was better than their f-filthy bloodline. He got the ring that night; it was new and he wanted to make it his completely. What better way than putting his soul inside?"
"They shall come," Draco answered evenly.
The Dark Lord began to laugh. The sinister sound slowly grew to fill the empty hall with chilling echoes. Maybe he
Shadow returned to his human form and met his father's gaze. "I'll be there in a minute. I want Remus to look over it first."
The portkey activated before Remus could retort. He landed heavily in the sitting room of Grimmauld Place. As Sirius had warned him, Tonks was waiting. She jumped to her feet and almost tripped over them in her attempt to catch him as Remus staggered. They leaned on each other, trying to keep from falling. Tonks smiled up at him through vibrant yellow hair. Despite his fatigue, Remus felt happiness stir at the sight.
Severus was exhausted. He had been Apparating around all day. It was nearing dusk, but he refused to go home until he had his son. The spell he was using only pointed him in the right direction, so he tried to triangulate the teen's location. He had finally narrowed it down to a large town about twenty-five miles from the house and had been wandering the streets, following the tug, ever since. It didn't help that Seraphim was obviously moving around.
"Cool new eyes, by the way.” Fred grinned.
It took longer than he thought, but he returned just as the scent of dawn touched the air. Light would come soon. He moved through the window and hurried toward the small room. His soon-mate and their soon-fledgling weren't there. Growling, he stalked the house and found them in a bigger room, sitting against the wall and staring at the door. The Boy whimpered in her sleep, her head pillowed on the smaller male's thigh. He growled again, louder, and his soon-mate lifted a stick. He knew it was dangerous, a threat, and he froze.
"I turned to Albus in April of 1980, eight months after I joined the Death Eaters," Severus began. "Then I immediately began spying for the Headmaster. It was… difficult."
"He had a nightmare the night before last night, too." Neville bit his lip and wondered how much he could say. He settled for, "I'm just worried he's not getting enough sleep."
"No one was killed," Severus stated, neatly avoiding the real question. He turned his back on the other two men and began to leave.
He nodded. "What did you find?"
"You did very well," Severus said evenly, holding his gaze.
They entered the kitchen to find Marissa almost done with her bowl of soup and chatting happily at Severus about her games with Sirius. Neville blinked dully as he slowly spooned liquid into his mouth, and Severus watched him out of the corner of his eye while pretending to listen to the hyper four-year-old.
"I'm sorry," Draco said quickly, hoping to stave off another round of hysterics. "It's okay. I won't touch you. I'm sorry."
What he really needed right now was information. Information that could help him plan for the future and Shadow's safety. And, perhaps most importantly, he needed to better understand the changes in his son's still-fractured mind in order to know the best step to take toward healing him. So Severus had retreated and stilled his mind and self-awareness, virtually flooding his mind with outside stimulus and clearer perceptions of those around him, including his son. It was the fourth day of such detailed observation and he had a wealth of material to consider tonight when he relaxed back to a more normal awareness.
"Serpentine."
"He would have tried," Firenze said gently. "Without you, the fledgling would still reside within darkness and pain. And without you, the Man of Earth? He'd never have broken free of the magical prison he'd confined himself within. You opened his path away from despair and early death."
"I owe you too much. You have to stick around and collect. What good Slytherin would pass up a deal like that, huh?"
"I don't want Severus to see," Draco muttered and grabbed Shadow's wrist to drag him across the Chamber and into the hallway. They slipped into the first study they came to. Draco warded the door as best he could and turned to find Shadow watching with a smile curling his lips and his arms crossed expectantly.
"Only games for fun.” Miles smiled sadly. "I have brittle bones. Have to take potions every month for it. I'm not allowed to play if the game is going to be too rough, but I'd love to be a Seeker."
"So five then."
"What about your scar?" Fred asked doubtfully.
"You don't like him claiming Draco."
The owl obediently flew to the end of the table, making Shadow jump back with a startled hiss. There was a blurring of the creature's edges and, within seconds, Luna sat on the table, kicking her feet and smiling brightly.
Vernon lifted the whip and prepared to strike.
Turns out the Ministry wasn't as ineffectual as the Order feared. Aurors had arrived at the start of the fight and protected Hogsmeade as much as possible. It was due to their efforts that not a single civilian had been killed. The dawn after Voldemort's demise, Minister Scrimgeour arrived at Hogwarts with his soldiers, dirty from battle and feeling triumphant.
"I'm sure Pomfrey has her on immune boosters, as well," Draco guessed correctly. The werewolf nodded. "Then there's a chance."
Shadow sighed and relaxed. "I did see her expression after she ran my physical, and then Remus took her aside and talked to her privately afterward. So I guess I did know."
"That is why it is important someone get this into him while the seizure is relatively mild." Severus glared at the werewolf in annoyance. Surely that was self-evident. "However, if he cannot swallow, it will absorb through the oral skin, so at least make sure it stays in his mouth. It will not be as effective administered this way, so use both vials instead of one. Understood?"
The guard weighed their wands, which meant he recorded their type and then handed them back. Shadow was stunned, but kept his face carefully blank. He had assumed the wands would be held here for safe keeping. Guess not. His fears crystallized inside him and he felt himself become more aware of everyone around him. They would be armed as he was. It was not safe here by any stretch of the imagination.
Salazar's eyes snapped open. The Baron shot into the air. Shadow fell limp, the diadem still clutched securely in his white-knuckled grasp. Sirius dove forward and scooped Shadow up into his arms bridal style. The teen was not heavy, but the smoke inhalation had Sirius staggering to the side, feeling like he was about to cough up his lungs. Then, as if in answer to his prayers, the fiendfyre impossibly disappeared. As grateful as he was, Sirius still managed to get his wand pointing in the direction of the door.
The only thing that made him feel the slightest bit in control was his visits to Remus, but tonight his mentor regretfully explained that he was needed down in the Chamber for some dangerous experiment involving Shadow. Neville itched to go down with him, but the same thing that kept him from going to DA kept him from the Chamber. He didn't want whatever, or whoever, watching him to discover his brother's location.
"You've got a point," Ron agreed.
Most of the fish swam back and forth between different emotional clusters. It was rare for a person to only feel one emotion during charged events. The fish mimicked this, and like the fish with the seaweed, they also swam in patterns. These indicated behavior habits and personality type.
"Hey… uh… Sorry, I guess I'm just a bit… confused," he said awkwardly. He had no idea what to do. He had no experience with children at all, but for some reason she reminded him of… Suddenly, he had a flashback of when he was Silas in the soul room. He had woken from a nightmare and Boy was curled up at the end of his bed, so desperately hurt. The memory only disturbed him more and he just stared at the little girl helplessly.
"You don't mind rooming with him, do you? We are tight for space."
She squealed in laughter, making those around them smile.
"We went farther than ever before…" Harry bit his lip hard, his hands fisting on his thighs. "I hate that I feel like this afterward. This fear. It's not normal. I should be able to be with him without having mental convulsions afterward."
"I'm sorry my disappearance as Harry caused you all such grief…" he began carefully, feeling his way through the situation. "I certainly didn't want to hurt anyone. To be honest, I didn't know you guys would take it so hard."
Shadow, after two nights of nightmares, staying up for almost twenty-six hours, and still recovering from dozens of nearly fatal wounds, wasn't likely to regain consciousness anytime soon. That gave Severus a chance to prepare to move into Headquarters with his son.
"But why should they have to do that?" Shadow exclaimed, disgusted with himself. He covered his face for a minute, rubbing at his cheeks before staring back at his father. "Why would I
"I can see that." Hermione smiled. "I'm glad they're so close. I know how much family means to Harry."
"Very well. Since you've left me with no choice, I agree," she said stiffly, obviously not pleased.
"I think I was even closer to Draco than them by the middle of last year. We had been writing each other, talking about the war and the sides we were born on without our permission. I could talk to him about things that Ron and Hermione would just brush off as stupid. They still thought in terms of black and white. There was no middle ground, no room to question, but it was different for me. There's this prophecy hanging over my head and it's a lot to deal with, especially with the leader of the Light side as an enemy."
Draco regarded his friend thoughtfully. He did look tired. "I'm sure I can amuse myself that long."
"Guess the rumors were true," Rogan said thoughtfully as he looked over Lillian's shoulder. "Potter is training somewhere."
Harry didn't know what to expect from his mentor, but answers to all his questions hadn’t been it. He was grateful and humbled by the man's trust in him and in his strength, but he was also grimly anxious about all he had learned. He retreated into himself, freeing his mind from his still severely injured body to think about everything Severus had revealed to him.
“Good." Harry nodded decisively. "Because neither are coming out ever again if I can help it. Merging is a lost cause. Boy and Demon are too insane and dangerous. I would not come out of a merging sane or functional."
Severus stood, staring at all of them. His hands were clasped behind his back, lank hair framing his formidable features, dark eyes holding deadly intent. "Outside this school," he began, voice dark and soft, compelling and dangerous, "things are rapidly occurring in certain political circles. We are all Slytherins here. It would be foolish to ignore the situation. Some of you, I am well aware, are being compelled by family or personal beliefs, perhaps both, to follow the Dark Lord. I know the position you are in. I once faced the same.
Neville stared after her. He had no idea what she was talking about. Shaking his head, he returned his attention to his brother. "Seraphim, I'm going to sit over there, far away from you, but you have to promise not to leave. Professor Snape is coming. He'll help you."
Shadow allowed his eyes to close, a frown still on his face, but that softened into a smile when he felt someone spell him dry and clean. The feel of the magic told him it was Draco.
Severus raised his hand, asking for a moment. "However, there was a strange message." He reached into his robe pocket and retrieved the note. Shadow took it, read it quickly, and then handed it to Draco who was once more sitting, this time much closer to his friend.
Harry felt the change come almost instantly. He shivered and squeezed his eyes shut as his skin shifted and his body changed - Severus's blood absorbed into him, became a part of him. It didn't hurt exactly, but it wasn't pleasant either. He focused desperately on outside stimuli, trying to distract himself from what was happening to his body. He could hear the fire crackling, could even hear the quick anxious breathing of Sirius. He could smell blood and sweat, but also a hint of the sage that was burning in the hearth.
Severus gently pulled out of his son's mind when he was confident he was in control and stable. Shadow blinked up at him, sweat rolling down his chin. Severus stroked his son's hair once before pulling away. Shadow forced himself to hold still and just catch his breath. It felt like he had run a mile. Neville and Draco stood in battle-ready positions, ready to defend the two Snapes no matter what came. He smiled and gripped his brother's shoulder firmly, both in apology and to reassure Neville that he was all there.
The four of them disappeared with a loud crack. The race was on.
! It's too late! He's dead… He's DEAD!"
Shadow seethed, resenting the power these cretins held over them and what they were doing to his father. What right did they have? It was ridiculous!
"We'll see," Draco said darkly. "We haven't heard Salazar's report yet."
"Draco?" Harry looked back at him. "What's wrong?"
"Morning, Professor."
Godric shook his head solemnly. "No. When you are done here, I will destroy it.”
"You look like hell, Severus. I wish you'd let us help you," Tonks murmured. Her smile had gone and her eyes had turned dark and calculating.
"Thanks, Remus.” Harry smiled at him.
"You're crazy," Ginny sated with absolute surety.
"What?" Draco asked softly, gently caressing Shadow's warm, damp cheek.
"I'm so sorry," Remus said sadly. It was always hard to hear of the deaths the war produced. "I never met him."
Arms wrapped around himself, he turned to go back into his room when something flashed in the sunlight above the trees. Dawn had come an hour ago. The sun had fully risen while he had been trapped once again in his memories of that damned Pensieve. Draco lifted an arm and shaded his eyes, squinting. An owl? Gasping, he ran…
Ginny hugged him, making her brothers catcall and tease her. She ignored them, but Neville turned red again. "Come back some time?"
To distract himself from the harsh emotional energies coming from the adults, he turned to quickly read the teens. The twins were bright with anticipation, knowing the dinner could quickly become explosive. Ginny was worried and defensive on his behalf. Hermione was curious and nervous. Ron was apprehensive, guarded, and distrustful.
The blond slipped out of the room without another word.
"You didn't know.” Shadow nodded. “Right, but it should have been considered. I should have been given the chance to consider these things. Are we even safe anymore? I assume Demon spilled a whole lot of dark magic around the area."
Draco was flung off the bed by a wave of magic, and he rolled, eyes wide and shocked. "Shadow?"
Shadow felt an uncontrollable smile spread across his face. The response was so Draco-like that he could literally hear his friend's voice in his head. He had a fond flashback of the careful dance of letters between them last summer.
Medals were also granted to every surviving member of the Order of the Phoenix, including Severus Snape, and Hogwarts' Defense Association, including Ginny Weasley, Hermione Granger, Luna Lovegood, and Neville Longbottom.
"Severus!" he called frantically.
"Not your fault." Draco pushed him away so that he could unfold his arms and drape them around Shadow's shoulders. "My mother… She was a wonderful woman. She was stronger than even I knew. I'm proud of her for standing up against them. She saved my life." But even as he said it, tears coursed down his face, bitter and cold. As proud of her as he was, as grateful, he was also desperately hurt. He'd miss her. She was his mother. He didn't want her to be dead.
Draco eyed him, obviously not biting.
Severus took a deep breath and repeated, "The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches. Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies… That's as much as the Dark Lord knows, but there is more… And the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not. And either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives. The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies."
xXxXx
believe in the curse, at least a little bit.
"How much is permanent?" He asked it so softly he feared Lupin wouldn't hear him.
"What?" Shadow pulled away and glared up at the man. "You
"They see my coming here as a betrayal of our beliefs." Firenze reached out his hands, palm up, and held them to the sky. "We see the events of the world play out above us. It is a pattern that cannot be altered by mortal hands. And yet… There is a time of divergence in the stars, where two paths can be taken."
The crowed reacted with a roar of approval. Fists viciously punched out at the air. Charlie met the ferocity of his people with a hungry grin. He flung his arms up, beckoning for silence. It came reluctantly.
He grabbed for his magic and let it roar into him. The ground shook. He felt himself stretching, burrowing deep, tasting Luna's blood in the soil. Then he was thrashed about in the wind, groaning and creaking, remembering how easy it was to manipulate death, to bring it forth in order to live, but he also remembered the good things about Earth magic as it filled him to the brim with a sense of vitality, of beauty.
The woman, short and round, with the face of a toad, curly light brown hair, and a deceptively sweet smiling mouth, came around the table to stand at the front, ensuring everyone was looking at her. She wore a pink cardigan over her robes and folded her hands, which had a few delicate rings on them. Shadow glared, he hadn't seen her among the other teachers, he was so caught up in his own thoughts and watching the students, but he remembered her from the hearing and wasn't pleased to have her here at all.
"Yes." Hermione sighed. "It's just hard to admit that we didn't really know him. But I'm glad I'm getting the chance to know him now."
Carrow slipped her head out of the floo and stood with a delighted smile upon her face. She'd just received her orders and they were glorious. She had waited, bided her time, but now she no longer had to restrain herself.
"Omi?"
"You still haven't answered the question, Mr. Snape. How were you punished? Give us an example."
Severus's dark eyes were neutral and his emotions were like a still pool, giving out nothing. He was the only person Harry knew who could become so still and accepting. Everyone else had a constant flow, no matter how small, of emotions escaping them. Only Severus could stop that flow and direct it inward, canceling it out so that he could observe and listen without distraction. It was one of the things Harry admired most about the man, one of the things he was most grateful for, especially since he was such a powerful Empath.
… And that's when everything had changed. His grandmother agreed and revealed she knew where the Order's Headquarters was because she used to be a part of the Order during the First War. They had asked her to come back a few months ago and she had agreed. She had been gathering information from many sources and feeding it to the Headmistress.
Draco couldn't wait any longer. He couldn't allow it to run. What if they never found the creature again? Shadow would be lost forever. He jumped to his feet and yelled, "Reverto dormio!"
"Was it worth it, ghost?" Severus asked icily. "Do you know how to keep the Dark Lord from my son's mind?"
The white ocean underneath them was all they could see. Draco began to lose sense of direction, his stomach was light, lifting away, his blood was sizzling, and Shadow was laughing, laughing… Draco closed his eyes, following that sound in the darkness, always following… Blind, deaf, dumb; it didn't matter. He would always follow Shadow… into Hell… into infinity…
"Uh huh… And?"
Draco shook his head with a doubtful smirk. Before Shadow could retaliate, the blond pulled him into the corridor again. The two teens made their way through the dimly lit passages. More aware, Shadow was amazed at the complexity of the caverns. It took a good fifteen minutes before they reached a cave opening.
Wednesday after dinner, Draco and Shadow waited by the portrait of Barnabas for the others who wanted to be in the defense group. They were talking in low tones about the prophecy and the Order guarding the corridor when groups of three and four students began trickling into the seventh floor hallway. Shadow smiled as Hermione stood next to him, head held high. Twenty minutes later, he decided that everyone was there who wanted to be.
Shadow lunged, but the phantom disappeared before they made contact. The teen hit the desk hard and sent it toppling. Draco hurried over and helped his friend to his feet. Shadow didn't so much as thank him before storming from the room. Draco followed him, sighing. It was time for DA. At least they'd be able to duel and burn off his frustrated energy. And if DA wasn't enough, they had the meeting with the Slytherins afterward.
They had dinner together. It was quiet and companionable, but there was still a heaviness in the air. What they needed was a good distraction. Severus was going to suggest a game of chess when Salazar materialized beside the table. Not exactly the distraction he had in mind - Salazar's information was bound to be unpleasant - but it would have to do.
Shadow snorted. He could see Draco's smug smile now at being described as incorruptible. And it was true in many ways. Lucius had tried very hard to mold his son in his own image, but Draco would never be anyone but himself.
Fred explained them. "We're trying to figure out how to get the same effect with a charm or maybe a potion. We could make one of our eyes green so we match yours or we could go one brown."
"Listen to me!" Neville said firmly, grabbing hold of him again and shaking him slightly. "A
The cart slowed more gently this time before coming to a halt in a large cavern. Harry stared. Griphook had described it, but seeing it with his own eyes was something totally different. The dragon was enormous. Pale white, with pink eyes, the poor beast was chained and there were ugly scars all down it's sides and mussel.
Severus met her gaze unflinchingly. Nothing would induce him to betray his son.
inside, no matter how much his body participated, but these last two… These last two he actually came in the real world and he felt completely like Kit had… Absorbed, excited, content with what was happening while that
"I was not. His visit was unexpected."
"…please, wake up. It's just a dream. No one's going to hurt you. You're alright."
"In the Lestrange vault, one of the most ancient chambers, stored at the deepest level, where the vaults are largest and best protected. Though the goblins of Gringotts will consider it base treachery, I will help you in exchange for the sword."
Neville clambered to his feet, his teeth chattering violently with the cold. Shadow trotted in on silent cat paws while Draco shut the door behind them. The warmth of the house was very welcome and the three of them made their way to the dinning room, Shadow transforming back into his human form as they went.
Shadow said nothing to that. What could he possibly say? It was sadly true. He hadn't been Ron's best friend in a long time. The redhead stood and stiffly made his way to the door. He didn't look back once as he left and Shadow didn't stop him.
"Hey…" Neville came up and gave his brother a hug. "It'll be okay. I'm sure Professor Snape and Remus will figure something out."
"I know. I know, cub, and he knows it, too." Remus pushed him a bit away and smiled. "Write your letter. I'll help you pack."
"As I was saying," Shadow smirked. "Since
After a few hours of sleep, those with Animagus ability slowly crept toward Malfoy Manor fifteen minutes before the sun was due to rise on Monday, February 22nd. Draco had revealed that the manor wards had a vulnerability. There were two different system of wards; one that activated at night, the other that activated during the day.
"Yes. He and Draco were both taken. We're looking for them now." Remus lifted a rag from the end table by Neville's head. One charm later and it was damp with cool water. He gently wiped at the teen's sweaty face. "Rest. I'll tell you as soon as we find them."
"How. Do. We. Stop. It?" Severus bit out.
"Okay, but we have to hurry." Sirius grabbed the werewolf's arm and Apparated them to Hogsmeade. Hogwarts had some of the best postal owls. They'd use one before making their way to Italy to search for Severus themselves. They had no time to waste.
