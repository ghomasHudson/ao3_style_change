His mother had talked about the events in the forest, briefly, like if it was something someone else had told her. Like if she was unsure of what had really happened, her mind too occupied on worrying about him. She had said Potter told her her son was alive, and she had believed him.
“Yes,” Draco enunciated slowly “you know, the lavatory. Unless you rather me going right here, I am not in the mood of improving the furnitures”. He shrugged, wrinkling his nose at the stripy pattern of the old sofa.
Well, almost everything, he thought noticing Pansy, as the girl entered his line of sight. She looked lost. The room was sparsely occupied, as most of the younger pupils were enjoying the first snow of the season and the older ones were catching up on studies before the holidays. She spotted him, and he moved further up the sofa to free some space for her to join him. She sat down on the edge, hands gripping the worn leather on both sides. The reflection of the fire danced in her dark eyes, and for a while they were silent.
“My second big mistake was to believe I only needed myself. That I knew better than anyone else. During the war, there were moments in which I was terrified —“ He shook his head. “Even admitting this is a sign of how much I have changed. But, yeah, I was fucking scared” He looked at McGonagall apologetically, but she nodded for him to go on “I know it was a shared sentiment and many of you probably think that I put myself into that situation in the first place. . . Which I did. But once I realised it wasn’t all what I imagined, I was so scared. Still, I didn’t reach out. I didn’t seek help. Honestly, the only thing that kept me going was knowing that someone was afraid, too. Even if I was never too fond of that person —“ He heard Harry huffing behind him “it made me feel less alone”.
“For the sake of comprehension, the English language requires you to state the subject of your affirmations, or you might be misinterpreted,” Draco drawled, enjoying the flare of anger in the other wizard’s blue eyes.
“Oh, Mister Malfoy. You are early. I’ve talked to Harry. . . Mister Potter, already, but the password is Russian Blue. Have a good day” she gave him a curt nod and hurried away. Draco hadn’t expected her to be present, but the sudden realisation that he was going to be alone with Potter made him feel strange. They had rarely been on their own and most of their confrontations had been tense at best.
His father had been sentenced to jail, and this time Draco had written that owl he should have sent when Stephen died. He had said he was sorry and many other things, and had told Theo he was welcome to stay at the Manor if he needed a place. Theo had gently declined. Blaise was staying with him for a while, before joining his mother in Italy, and he needed some time to sort things out at home and eventually sell the place. He came to visit though, quite often.
“So” Draco prodded, feeling childishly vindicated “we have all been bleeding our hearts dry thinking about poor Potter while the git was somewhere out there building sandcastles and playing muggle with his dick”
His eyes widen with the implications. Hands against the glass like a child, Draco began to fall in love with things he had never allowed himself to notice before.
Oh the shore, just a few metres away, a familiar pair of ginger and black heads was walking in their direction.
He plopped one of the sweets into his mouth with a thank you, quickly turning back to the window to avoid further interaction.
Draco startled but the animals seemed unbothered by the new presence. They must know her, he thought and his beliefs were proved right when the Ravenclaw girl that sometimes hanged out with Potter, Lovegood or something, approached them carrying a bucket of what looked like blood covered rats. The smell of iron was strong and the creatures were immediately drawn to the girl, that fed them with the aid of a hooked stick. She was wrapped in a thick multicoloured scarf, far longer than the school ones, and messy strands of greyish/blond hair escaped from the bottom, a leaf or two tangled in the wavy locks. She wore no gloves and her hands were pale and bluish, but she didn’t seem to mind.
“Fine.” Draco gritted out, not that he was expecting any different “And how are you planning to do this?”
He pooped his head back into the lounge “The what-who now?”. But Lupin ignored him. His head was already bent over the journal, a bluish light streaming from his wand and softly illuminating his concentrated frown.
After another long pause, it was Draco that spoke first “You know, I was afraid of coming back. I expected people to hate me, but, excluding some looks, everybody seems incredibly okay with me being here”.
When it was over he tipped his head backwards, under, and didn’t come out until his lungs started burning and the water had gone cold.
She shifted her weight, leaning her shoulder against the door to keep it open and re-adjusting the enormous pile of green menus balanced in her arms, before giving him a welcoming smile.
Draco feigned horror and the Gryffindor let out a loud chuckle. “No, not like that. It was mutual. I just think there is potential there. . . Terry is obsessed with dragons, he is going to Romania after graduations. We just want different things”. He shrugged again.
Draco’s mind procured a vivid image of the other’s boy red cheeks under the paper crown, realising belatedly that Potter hadn’t been wearing glasses in that picture either. The lack of spectacles bothered him more than it was rational.
And sorry about the lack of Harry and i know they are meant to love each other but i doubt that could happen without a few changes in their way of thinking and that takes time.
It was a week after, when they were together in the library, that he heard Harry’s laugh again. They were sitting at a long table, a few of them. His eyes had lifted involuntary to search for the origin of the sound. A sound that he could recognise everywhere. Harry was chatting to Macmillan, clearly amused. Their eyes met, and the Gryffindor smiled. And in that mundane moment, just a normal instant of an everyday, it hit him. He stared at the other boy’s open face. His boyish, soft, beautiful face. His eyes widen, his pulse raced, and for the first time Draco noticed how Harry stood out even when the room was full. He adverted his gaze, not quite sure what to do with this new information. It was long before his heart slowed to its usual rhythm.
“And aren’t you?” Draco couldn’t stop himself from asking, recalling the way the other boy had never seemed able to stop himself from being the self appointed hero of every injustice.
Hey! This was quick, but I am on a roll. It’s actually my favourite interaction between the two of them as of yet, and I had lots of fun writing it, so I hope you’ll enjoy it as much as I did putting it into words.
“How do you know?” He felt childish, like throwing a tantrum, and tried to compose himself, “You don’t know what I’ve done, what I’m capable of” he spat, trying to sound assured.
“Do you think I will see the dolphins?”, breakfast Harry had asked, eyes wide in wonder, before gleefully shrieking at the endless possibilities of the ocean.
Wanting. 16 years old Draco had wanted many things. 17 years old Draco closed his eyes and thought of flying. Hands tight around the handle of his broom and off against the wind, chasing a flicker of gold dancing just inches out of reach. If he could ask one last thing, Draco wanted the simple feeling of happiness.
“You have never really bothered to ask, have you? You just assumed this was the life i wanted, too. That i wanted this just like Stephen” Theo was yelling to his father, uncaring of the dangers his loud voice could attract.
“A coupla idiots” Scott replied, tempting a charming smile that fell just this side of a grimace instead.
His gaze found Draco’s, green and confused. Draco gaped back, before realising that Potter had no clue of what was going on in his mind. He laughed, embarrassed, his right hand reaching the base of his head in a mirror gesture of the other boy’s.
“You spent the last 72 hours lecturing me on how they are not that much different from us. How difficult can it be? I am not an idiot”.
Yey! I did it! I finished it!!! i am so happy! Thanks to everybody that has been following this mad journey and I hope you like the romance😂 as in finally, sooo sorry for that ❤️
To his surprise, Potter gave a short humourless laugh, a wide open mouth  thing, canines bare and pointy. Wild predator teeth in a human boy’s face, Draco thought a bit bewildered.
From the mirror expressions of bafflement on both Potter and the Muggle’s faces, Draco hadn’t quite managed to convey the “here, take my money” vibe he was going for.
He came clean with Blaise about his preferences a few days before. The boy had raised his eyebrows, looking up from his book. “Do not mock my intellect, Draco” he had commented, before resuming his reading.
Looking back, he knew his mother had needed the reassurance as much as he did, helpless against a situation out of her control. She had been chasing a flame of hope in the insurmountable darkness of her son’s affliction, trying to find a positive in a pain that she could not make her own.
“Would you have done it?” Blaise asked eventually, because that was the point. The heart of the issue.
“I can assure you that the Wizarding World would know if the Dark Lord had found Potter. As you surely know, Albus, he is not one to keep his accomplishments quiet. You don’t need me for that.”
Potter was sitting next to a beaming Luna, and wore the strangest expression between determination and discomfort.
“I wasn’t aware” Harry’s cry sounded horrified but he quickly started chuckling “I’ll make sure to tell him”.
Snape, who was sitting at his immediate right, spoke first “My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Potter from his current place of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.”
Draco watched as he approached one of the glossed cabinets above the stove and started rummaging in what looked like a chaos of miss-matched plates and plastic bowls. After a minute he turned around holding a small stone basin, covered in elaborate runes. It was oddly beautiful, in contrast to the sundries cluttering the shelves.
Draco stepped into the dark corner and was received by Harry’s floating head. The boy giggled. Draco had noticed a mixed group of students leaving the Hall some time before, and knew Harry was one of them.
17 years old Draco now recognised what the child he had been did without realising. He had picked his “inferiors”, his “enemies” not between the students that were somewhat less talented than him but among the peers that presented the most challenges to his own superiority. Granger, with her brain and her dedication. Potter, with his fame and his courage. And even Weasley, that was deemed a superior choice by the only person to ever reject him. Him, that was raised to see himself as desirable company in the eyes of everyone and that couldn’t understand why this time he wasn’t.
“Er -“ Draco briefly considered lying, but Potter was smirking. “I am sure it was all perfectly fascinating” he drawled instead.
But, Potter was a constant in the peripheral vision of every single person in the whole damned school, whether willing or not.
The grass squelched under his boots. It had rained all afternoon but the grey clouds were dissipating and, in between the remaining ones, dusk coloured the sky pink. Draco smiled, feeling like a character out of one of those cheesy romance novels that were his mother’s secret weakness.
Surprisingly, it had taken a couple of days for the blast to blow at full power. Despite Potter’s habitual courtesy of keeping his delusions of grandeur and heroic gestures until the end of the school year, people had assumed The Boy Who Lived was simply out there, slaying some beast.
His former Professor moved like a caged animal, seemingly oblivious to the world. His hands were buried into his hair, tugging at the strands in a way that didn’t appear entirely comfortable, and he was deep in conversation with himself.
“I don’t know. Everything is different. Daphne is friend with Lovegood. . .I saw you, with Potter, too. You used to despise him the most”.
Cry for a long time. Days and hours and seconds. Cry until he was certain he didn’t have any more tears left in him and then cry some more.
And Draco didn’t know if they were still talking about the animals anymore. Or about her. Or, maybe, himself.
He looked at the young Gryffindor that would never go back to either of his worlds and wondered if his parents even knew of the war that was going on. Of the magnitude of it. And of their son, that died to protect a reality that would never welcome them fully.
“What do you want, Draco?” The largest of the two, Vincent, asked menacingly. Incidentally he was also the brighter, so he had taken upon Draco’s role as a leader.
“Fine.” Draco truly hoped that, if there was justice in this world, he would be amply rewarded for the shit he had to put up with.
“Because I am a nobody. Greg has left, you know? His father wasn’t lucky like yours. . . And he left. He has family in the continent, and after Vince he couldn’t come back. But I have no future, no qualification. Who wants anything to do with the daughter of supporters of the Dark Side? And you know what’s funny?” She laughed bitterly “ — We were even too cowards to join Him properly”. Pansy’s parents had never taken the mark.
There was resignation and acceptance in Dumbledore’s words, and for a short moment Draco let himself believe that that was it. The Headmaster’s last gift, for him only.
Draco nodded, trying to contain his nerves. He barely registered as the other boy moved a little further to have a private conversation into one of those cello-phones things. In just a little while he would see Potter again.
“Ah, young love” Blaise voice observed, like he was 100 years old. They turned to greet their friend, who was fumbling with the knot of his tie.
“Mhmm, yeah. I think I’ve just learnt to live with it” Draco counteracted, knowing there was some truth in the other boy’s words. “But seriously, why was it so easy for you to move on, after our history?”. He really much wanted to know the answer.
Draco sat down at the edge of the sofa, determined to fight his curiosity and the urge to snoop around the room. It was surprisingly comfortable, a charcoal grey three seater, well-loved and, against all odds, to Draco’s taste.
He sat up straighter, shifting uncomfortably. He needed to consider his next words carefully, so he took his time until he was certain Lupin was going to start asking again “You need to find Potter”. There was no way around it.
Even with Christmas widely being the most popular of the holidays, Draco had always favourited Easter. Being used to have the best of everything with just a whim made the exchange of presents less exciting, and summer was too long and tedious. He found that Easter gave him a balanced respite from the busy schedule of the approaching exams, when life at Hogwarts was getting demanding and chaotic. When younger his parents, normally focused on his school career, would often take him somewhere nice for a few days, where they would just spend time being a family, mentions of school and achievements forgotten. In his constant pursue to come out on top, besting the other students to satisfy his father’s desires and his own ambitions, this time was a much needed break to just let himself be young and relaxed. On top of that, the Manor in spring was simply a sight to behold. The white stoney walls of his home looked regal and neat, a beautiful contrast to the gardens, that were coloured by an impressive array of blooming plants. The gravel path, that led visitors from the intricate iron gate to the imposing entrance door of the Manor, was edged on both sides by symmetrical French gardens, developing around two beautiful central fountains, frequent attractions for chirping birds, looking for refreshment and a place to play. But Draco’s pride had always been the area stretching to the left of the Manor, where all pretentiousness was abandoned in favour of a more natural landscape. Here, lost in the middle of groves of trees, were a lovely little pond and, just before the land touched the orchard, the raspberries bushes where Draco had found his secret corner of normalcy the summer before.
He gestured for him to keep his place ahead in line, quickly shutting his expression off when it looked like the other boy wanted to engage in conversation. The Muggle seemed to struggle with himself for a moment, mouth opening and closing a few times. Draco stared back, trying to convey as much hostility as possible, until it became uncomfortable and the boy turned around, eventually lost in the moving queue.
Fucking Potter. One would think the obnoxious prat was the backbone of the entire Wizarding World. Like they hadn’t survived well enough for the 11 or so years their precious hero had been hiding Merlin knows where.
The last few hours into the early morning had passed alternating between counting the mould stains dotting the ceiling and flipping idly through the journal’s blank pages, almost but never allowing himself to stop at the first page. He missed his mother dearly and, part of Draco, felt like he had already spent his time mourning her loss without having a proper closure.
“What brings you here on such a terrific evening and all that crap?” He asked, rehearsing one of their previous conversations.
Don’t be stupid, father, you know you have no choice, Draco pleaded in his head. His request was granted when, after a brief moment, his father reached into his robe and gave up his wand.
Potter was missing. He suddenly thought of Voldemort’s words and turned to Luna. “Do you think Potter —“
For a moment, they stared at each, puzzled, but before the other man could open his mouth to say something else, Draco knew.
Vincent and Greg made a move for their wands and for a moment Draco thought they were going to fight. At the end they must have realised their spell-casting wasn’t at the Professor’s level and, with two disgrunted sound of agreement, they followed the man inside.
“My uncle, he was one of the Aurors under the Imperius as well” added a Hufflepuff girl, giving the Slytherin a sympathetic smile.
When the last of the young students was sent to join the Ravenclaws, the Hat offered a few parting words “Think differently, accept different” and then fell silent again, collapsing on itself like a worn out rag.
Oh man writing is much harder than i was expecting. I have what i want to happen figured out but then putting it into words is a complete different matter. So kudos to all writers, you are amazing.
Having slept 10 hours on the plane he wasn’t tired in the slightest. He blinked up at the ceiling, grimacing at the spots of mold tattering the white paint.
It had passed in a whirlwind of emotions and words that made the contrast with the silence in the cab even the more poignant.
“I didn’t chose to be a Slytherin, it’s just who I am. Which says nothing, because I am not at all like Blaise —“
“No. Yeah. . . Okay - that’s fine”. Draco thought about all the nameless faces he had seen vanishing at the Dark Lord’s hand throughout the previous summer, in that same house his mother called her own. But Narcissa wasn’t a nobody. She just. . . Wasn’t. She mattered. She had to be alive.
They stood there, facing the spiralling staircase for a long time, each lost in their own mind. Alone.
But Draco knew now. He knew why the memories were given to him, and he understood why someone like Lupin, someone that loved Potter, would have never accepted what needed to be done. So he said none of that, falling willingly into the role he had been assigned. That, too, was becoming a fucking habit.
The walls of the “MTEL” were a sandy brown, paint flaking in more places than not and rude words scribbled everywhere. Two dead potted plants were carelessly positioned at either side of the entrance, like a mocking welcome sign to hell. Hoping that the place wasn’t representative of the local fashion, Draco dragged his luggage behind him and entered the building.
Lupin righted his clothes and fished Draco’s belongings out of his pocket, unshrinking them in the process. The black luggage dropped to the ground with a thunk and Draco barely snatched his backpack from the air before it met the same fate. “As I said, piss!” He glared harder between the other wizard and the stained asphalt.
When fall turned over into winter, it wasn’t gently. October had been tempered and lovely and the sweet scent from the pumpkins patch behind Hagrid’s hut had lingered in the air well into November. The edge of the Forbidden Forest had been scattered with fallen leaves that gleamed gold in the mild sun light, making the place look magical. Draco had wondered if Muggles believed in magic, on warm November days like those. He knew Muggles talked of magic, and he always thought them to be deprived, surely jealous and spiteful if they were to find out their secret. Find out that people just like them, were actually quite special. Better. Stronger.
So, the quote Narcissa makes is from “Sill Life With Woodpecker”. Great book, so read it. Anyway, I remembered it and I think it fits my purposes so I used and twisted the origins a bit.
The envelope was small, bearing the Hogwarts crest on an emerald seal. The owl had dropped it in the centre of the table and was now hooting in disdain. Draco just stared, until his mother offered the animal a piece of ham and picked up the letter. She gave him a look for permission and he told her to go ahead.
“Yes, I do” Dumbledore replied calmly, even when his body seemed to give up a little and he slumped further down, looking tired and worn. “As for being about to kill me, Draco. We have been here, quite alone, for long moments and I am defenceless. Still, you have not acted”
By the weekend they had agreed on a layout and the fact that there was indeed no need for a fountain. Macmillan had tried to argue his case, but Luna had spoken quietly, in her dreamy voice “I don’t know. . . I guess I’ve always envisioned a small, tranquil pond, with fish. And wildlife will surely claim it as their home. . . Dad always says they attract Freshwater Plimpies, and that would be tremendously wonderful, you know. . .”
The Headmaster didn’t sound surprised in the slightest and he looked right at him with a small smile
Some of the other students had looked at her with skepticism, but most of them were used to her odd declarations. And it made sense, a place buzzing with life to celebrate the ones that no longer could enjoy theirs.
Potter was chatting idly about how he came upon his job as a server at the Mad Hatter, gaze twinkling narrowly on his traitorous cat. Draco, only half listening, took the opportunity to observe him.
When he started speaking, thought, he realised he understood now why a lot of students would seek Harry and look at him for guidance. The powerful intensity in his green eyes had people holding their breaths.
“He was a Muggleborn. He came back just for this, he really believed in Harry. Nobody noticed, you see. He was underage”.
“Harry, have you seen him?” Weasley prodded and the other boy looked in the direction of the fields.
“Yes, Theodore, very helpful. But the seahorses are a fundamental ingredient for the endurance effect of a girding potion”, he scoffed, annoyed. He had been mashing his brain on the topic for hours, and it was only mid morning.
“Only you could finish such a speech calling everybody an idiot” Weasley commented, still looking impressed.
Blaise voice resonated in his ears like a mantra “We are just trying to survive, to see the end of this war a way or another”.
Draco barely had the time to register the need to talk to Lupin about the apparent flaw in his enchantment, before the other boy was saluting them with a hand to his forehead.
“I can’t. . . I can’t be sure” he mumbled. Coward. He thought about his conversation with Blaise, about making a difference. But he also knew that, despite being an accomplished occlumen, he was panicking and that made him more exposed to mind attacks. And in that moment his mind was screaming POTTER.
The woman was short, with mousy brown hair, and held onto her husband for support. When she addressed Draco, although her voice was wavering, she looked determined
“We are Colin’s parents, Colin Creevey. And this is Dennis, our son, he comes to Hogwarts too. . . They told us you found him, that you took care of him. Thank you. He went, in the middle of the night, he was gone. But he was proud of who he was, happy” she paused. Sobbed. “So we never truly lost him, because he was were he belonged. . . Thank you for making sure he returned to us. . .” She sobbed again, unable to continue.
Draco was frozen. The other boy placed the Hawthorn wand awkwardly on the table next to the bread basket, brushing slightly on Narcissa, that had been looking at him all the time, in the process. Draco swore his mother and Potter exchanged a silent conversation.
“Who is he apologising to?” Draco couldn’t fathom who the person that literally died for everybody else would need to say sorry to.
One hour. Luna looked worried. Macmillan was chewing his bottom lip apprehensively, glancing back and forth from Draco to the Gryffindor’s body. He seemed to have come to a decision, because he moved to stand behind the boy’s head and reached to grab him under the armpits. “Help me, will you?” He asked, nodding in Draco’s direction.
So long, in fact, that he couldn’t really recall the exact shade of her eyes or whether her smile had really been as bright as he remembered. So long that, sometimes, he found himself frantically rummaging about in his drawers just to look at her one more time. He would stare at her pictures, drinking in all the details that, later, were inevitably bound to fade in the void of his memory, like leaves in the current.
Two weeks into the school year and even Longbottom could tell you that, based on the worry lines and perpetual frown on the headmaster’s tired face, Dumbledore himself had no sodding clue of Potter’s whereabouts.
“I like the hat”, Theo’s voice trailed off sleepily after a while. “I wonder if there will be raspberries bushes in the Memorial Gardens”.
The boy caught up, but stopped as soon as he reached him “Wait, I haven’t been in the forest since — well. . .”
“Because it was a fucking stupid idea! What the bloody hell were you thinking? Do you know Potter at all? He would hate you if he knew what you did to him.” The words tumbled out of his mouth like a waterfall and he hoped the blow would hit low enough to damage. He hoped they would be enough to deter any more questions he didn’t want to answer.
Was it worth it, Potter had asked. Maybe. The other wizard wouldn’t have agreed, but that was beyond the point, there was just too much at stake. There was no backing out and Draco needed all his concentration and abilities to complete the task. If Potter knew he had been the motivation that pushed Draco to finally fix that blasted cabinet he would have been horrified, and the thought was strangely not as satisfying as it should have. Draco reasoned that the sudden lingering of guilt in his stomach was due to the fact that wherever his loyalties laid he didn’t really want to kill anyone. Not for the first time he thought about what Potter said about being sixteen and thinking about silly, inconsequential things, and his left arm itched in response. As much as it was for Potter, that was not an option, and Draco had never craved simply being young more.
“But, as much of an arse as you can be, you are not stupid. You know I cannot go around blatantly asking about Narcissa Malfoy’s wellbeing.”
Potter was one to act, Draco thought a few weeks after the bathroom encounter. Potter was scared but he acted anyway. He had found himself comparing with Potter more than once in the last few days, quite often, if he was being honest, and he found it reassuring.
“Uhm, ewwww” was not the answer he was expecting, so he glared, obtaining only a louder chuckle in response.
“I think Harry wouldn’t want any more people to die”, she said, looking at her friends. “I like Harry” she added, more to herself, and with that Draco watched her walk away to join the group.
“Oh, yeah. The guy actually cancelled ‘bout an hour ago, just like that. Said he had some family issues, or something. Evan was blabbering about covering the rent himself, that it’d certainly give him less grief.” Scott said, clearly not agreeing with that determinate plan of action.
“I am sorry”. Lupin said again, and Draco felt there was an understanding there, a sort of kinship. Shitty birthdays were apparently a bonding experience, because his shoulders relaxed fractionally, some of the anger deflating. He considered the man in front of him, and he was suddenly hit with the realisation that Lupin wasn’t much older than him, if at all, when he had to live through the First War. He wasn’t really sure of the story there, but he had heard rumors of the friendship between his former Professor and the Potters. How many people had the other man lost? Lupin didn’t speak to him with pity, he spoke as a man that knew what it meant and didn’t wish it on anybody else.
It was just a detached observation, he told himself with conviction. At the end of the day even Chang, who had dated someone as conventionally handsome as Diggory, was somehow taken by the speccy git, if rumors were to be believed. And Chang, even by Draco’s rather gay standards, was very pretty.
A cloud of dust enveloped them and Draco coughed to free his lungs. The battle was degenerating fast.
Draco was starting to feel loose and relaxed, almost convinced that things were truly going to work out.
He reached out, as he had done many times in the past, a long gone past. The other boy’s eyes widened and he moved slightly backward.
And that was it. And Draco heard his voice saying “If I might be bold, you” while he held his breath.
His gaze involuntarily searched for a spot of dark hair in between the heads of the students looking for a space to sit. He was aware that Potter wasn’t a fool, and if Hogwarts might not be safe any longer for some of the students, it would be downright suicidal for the Dark Lord’s most wanted wizard. But still, almost out of habit, he kept his eyes wandering. He had seek Potter out in nearly every one of their train rides and it seemed only fitting to do it in the one that was going to be his last. Did Potter regret not knowing that the previous year would have been his last time on the Hogwarts Express? Would he have tried to enjoy it more? It was a frequent dilemma in Draco’s mind as of lately, if people would make the most of their experiences knowing before that they were going to be their last chance at it. He absentmindedly reached for the door handle of a compartment, still so lost in thoughts that he had to do a double take at the sight of the black haired boy sitting by the window. Not Potter, his mind provided eventually, even before the other boy turned to look at him.
I gave her away, i gave them away. No matter that she was herself, no jinx to protect her identity like Potter’s, her pain was on his conscience.
His father had gotten closer to Potter and was inspecting his face. “There’s something there,” he whispered, “it could be the scar, stretched tight. . .Draco, come here, look properly! What do you think?”
“Draco” Theo urged, hysterical. He was bouncing from foot to foot, eyes wild and hair sticking up on the side he had been sleeping on. He still had a crease mark on his cheek and Draco didn’t want to say anything. He wanted to tell him to go back to sleep, that all was fine.
Sure, there was an overall pretence of normality. Classes were scheduled as per usual, Gryffindors were a bunch of idiots, as per usual. Hogwarts was a joke. As. Per. Usual.
With a quick wave of his wand he watched as abused cartilage straightened, blood and dirt vanished, leaving no traces of what had happened behind.
When their friend went missing and rumours of the caught Muggleborns on the run had reached the school, Longbottom and his band of merry men had started to be more daring. The war was getting serious and these kids, bruise after cut, were looking in the eye of the enemy, defiant and still not broken.
Draco was angry. He hated it, being scared. That too, he had grown out of at 5, as it should have been. As his father had wanted.
“No, I know he is. I told you about the amulet. I don’t often look but. . .  I’ve seen glimpses. I've seen the sea, an awful lot of it, and. . . Uhm” Lupin flushed slightly and wringed his fingers together “other things. He is alive.”
Night, not dusk, and Draco almost sagged in relief at what must have been just a horrible dream. He closed his eyes and let his head fall backwards, groaning when the impact sent an uncomfortable jolt down his spine. As his breaths grew deeper the voice around him became louder. Draco was about to tell Blaise to knock it off and let him sleep when he realised that the voice sounded frantic and very much not Blaise’s.
Potter, he wouldn’t have been in this predicament, that stupid boy would rather sacrifice his life than kill an old man that was possibly dying anyway. Draco wasn’t Potter, though. Still, he couldn’t voice the curse, so wasn’t that what he was doing too? Surely not killing Dumbledore would mean death, wasn’t not acting a sort of sacrifice itself? He was young, he didn’t want to die.
“I seem to be lacking in patience and concentration”, Harry replied, as if reading his mind “Hermione thought I would benefit from the exercise. There’s a treat inside” he pointed at a discarded box behind him with a chocolate frog wrapping on top. “You know, for motivation”.
“Are you telling me the defender of the weak, the hero of every witch in distress, is done with fighting the evil?” His tone was exaggeratedly incredulous but Draco was curious.
Lupin's voice was reaching a new level of exasperation that a morning spent buying clothes for someone used to expensive and tailored cuts hadn’t helped with at all.
The Gryffindor looked uncomfortable, like if unsure he should answer, but Luna piped in “He is in Australia”
Sorry guys this took so long but it has been a wild start of the year. I hope it’s okay, I haven’t had much time to re-read it so finger crossed it’s not just a bunch of nonsense 😣
“Honestly? Yes. But one day, this pretty daft guy told me it was okay to be” he rebounded, with a smirk of his own.
“She can be a bit meddling. Ellen, I mean.” Scott said, his mouth twisting in a grimace. For some reason, he too looked guilty. A set of keys dangled from his fingers and Draco averted his eyes, focusing on the gentle swaying of metal. He shrugged helplessly, unable to explain why he had jumped at the opportunity with the enthusiasm of a single mum meeting a pre St Mungo Lockhart, to then deflate like a jittery teenager.
For a moment they stared at each other like two cats, teeth bared, but Draco’s traitor stomach growled and he had to concede defeat.
“I said nervous.” The boy shrugged, giving him a little smile. “I’ve been flying since I was very little,
Harry still looked doubtful, eyes gazing at the open palm resting on his legs as if they held the answers to his concerns.
Draco came to it feeling mildly disoriented, and wasn’t that becoming a fucking habit. Lupin stood, leaning over him, concern and confusion written all over his exhausted features.
He had never said it out loud, but Draco had seen it in the way he was with Teddy. In the way he would alway sigh after closing the door behind the little boy, to then retire in the living room and curl up on the sofa. Teddy was part of their life but at the end of the day, he would always go back to Andromeda.
When she pushed him gently towards the door of the carriage he could swear he heard her whispering “It’s going to be ok” so softly, like a promise that she wasn’t sure she could fulfil.
Because i know about your parents, he thought, but that was personal, too. “Because you have to mean it”.
She had just finished telling them how some of her patients that were left with permanent disabilities, had been found to be the victims of mind controlling spells, when a Slytherin girl said timidly “My mother, she worked for the Ministry. She was under the Imperius. . . No one noticed”.
Potter’s clothes turned out to be a mismatched set, green t-shirt and navy sweat shorts. The cotton was used and almost threadbare in places, but it felt incredibly soft between his fingers. The t-shirt was baggy and too wide at the top, slipping off one of his shoulders, and wasn’t that unfair when the shorts were just the right size around his narrow waist. Draco had only considered his lack of underwear for a second, before thinking that he was considering too much and pulling them up.
If it was a surprise for Draco, who hadn’t even realised someone had entered the room, Snape's presence was clearly expected. Dumbledore barely glanced at him before giving his full attention back to the book, as if the other man had always been there.
Doing his damndest to ignore Blaise’s knowing looks, he quickly turned away, making his way back to Slytherin. He was gonna go find a bed and hopefully wake up 6 years in the past when Harry Fucking Potter was none of his concern.
Harry sighed and continued “So, if you are asking if I’m scared of kissing a boy because, Godric forbid, i might be Harry Potter the Sexually Confused in the next month worth of The Prophet’s prints, the answer is no. I am not scared. . . Not this time and not about this”.
It was his first time inside someone else’s mind and he found that the journey was quite different from apparition or even using a portkey. No unpleasant tug in the middle, none of the dizziness he had come to associate with teleporting to another material place. Simply a shift in and out of his body, almost nice, like a cool wave rippling through his inner essence. He was in the Headmaster’s office and at the same time he wasn’t.
The water, mixed with the sour taste of lemon, washed away any lingering blood from his mouth. He sat, staring contently outside until the cabin was almost empty and he was forced to follow the swarm of bodies inside the airport.
His aunt clutched tightly onto Granger and forced the boys to surrender their wands, asking Draco to pick them up.
The other boy must have read his silence as confirmation, because he continued a little more firmly.
The small homage to Harry’s parents felt flat when compared to the enormity of what he was doing, yet the insistent voice in his mind commanding his actions kept reminding him that no magic had been able to save James and Lily Potter.
Draco was starting to notice how he seemed to prefer smaller, almost uncomfortable, spaces, caging his body in between the furniture like he was used to blend into the background.
“He has a cat.” He wrote instead. “A ginger tabby. His name is Ron, looks like your charm wasn’t as effective as you claimed.”
His mother sighed “You were just a boy, and under lots of pressure. If anyone, it’s my and your father’s fault”.
“Potter is here?” Fucking Potter was alive. Draco scanned the room, adrenaline pumping in his veins. Potter had been in Wales the entire fucking time and Draco could punch him again. Would punch him again.
“No, but really, Theo, what is going on with you recently?” Draco asked before his friend could kill the other.
After that there was his aunt, and Granger screaming. And screaming. Screams that curdled blood. Draco faced the wall and didn’t move. Coward. He thought of the boys in the dungeons, listening to their friend’s screams. He wasn’t behind bars but trapped all the same.
In truth, he was as committed as Theo to get to their next class on time, so he aimed a quick vanishing charm at his friend’s breakfast. “For Merlin’s sake Blaise, cut the man a break”.
“Just eat, kiddo. I see people eating all day! . . . Honestly.” She prompted, when it looked like he was still hesitant to pick up his fork. Draco half expected her to start scolding him for how thin he was and decided he was actually too hungry to care about any lingering awkwardness.
Everybody laughed, but Draco only stared. He had just strangely noticed how full Potter’s lips looked, even when he smiled.
The group stopped, and he saw that there was a third person with them, a brunet almost as tall as Weasley. Draco looked at the blue tie of Terry Boot in mild surprise.
Yes, they were alive, but barely. Draco clenched his teeth. What was Potter playing at! The Dark Lord had been furious when the boy had eluded him once more and Draco could only be thankful he was unimportant enough to be spared the worst of the rage.
Lupin ignored him, eyes scanning the Prophet worriedly. “I think he has to be you, to find Harry I mean”.
September came, eventually, and his trunk was ready. He had prepared it himself, in an attempt to keep busy. He had spread all the belongings he intended to take with him on the bed and, after all the space was taken, on the floor beside the trunk. He had been amazed by the amount of stuff in front of him, realising that he never saw it all together out of the confined space of his luggage, charmed to extend in order to accomodate it all. Oh, how perspective changed things. The process itself was methodical, the fact that he didn’t resolve to using magic at all completely escaping his notice. Pick. Bend. Pack. Don’t think about Hogwarts. Repeat. It was over too soon.
He finally spotted the queue for the check-in, Lupin’s voice in his head repeating for the umpteenth time what he was supposed to do.
“I am tired to be afraid, I want to make a difference” and with that he went back to his wounds, dismissing him.
“Listen, Malfoy, you came here looking for a reason to forgive yourself. Your family, I think that’s your reason. You chose each other, at the end. . . Your parents chose you, and you did most of what you have done for them. Dumbledore was adamant about the importance of Love. And that’s it. For Snape it was the love he felt for my mother, for Dumbledore the one for his sister. . . As soon as there is some sort of Love, there’s your opportunity for change. Voldemort never knew what it meant, and never sought it, so he was doomed. You grew up in a family were your parents loved you, and loved each other. You’ll be fine”.
“He played it well. . . He was able to fool Voldermort, don’t beat yourself up too hard”. Potter tone was almost sad.
Sprawled across the shabby carpet of the last carriage of the Hogwarts Express, he lay motionless, but for the frantic quivering of his irises, the only indication he was still alive.
“In some ways. . . I talked to the Professors after the exam this morning. I am not going into Auror training, which feels weird. . . But also kinda right, you know?”
The smell of wet dog was the last thing he felt before he was pulled into the opposite direction, towards the dark hideout of one of the castle’s many alcoves.
He rolled his eyes, trying to shake the lingering sadness away “Very Mature. No way I’d be caught writing in this thing”.
He still remembered the ghost of pale fingers across his forehead. A gentle, cooling pressure against his clammy skin, whilst his young body had shaken in the aftermath of yet another night of horror. He still remembered her words, lulling, reassuring.
“No, right, I am not. I am the defective son, isn’t it so father? Pray tell, what bothers you the most? The fact that I don’t particularly enjoy torturing Muggles or the fact that I like the wrong bits?” Theo’s voice was hard but he was crying.
“Run, Draco” Snape’s voice said, again. He ran, further, while Snape fought Potter, but then he couldn’t go, he couldn’t leave and he turned to look. Potter had grown a fair lot in their sixth year, so he didn’t look small, compared to their professor. He stood, battered and proud, addressing Snape like an equal, despite the differences in experience and power. He saw the other man killing the Headmaster in cold blood and still there he was, knowing it wasn’t a balanced fight but trying anyway. For a moment, Draco thought Snape would kill him and he felt the grip on his wand become painful, not really knowing what he would do, feeling his body guided by instinct. The curse, however, never came. He saw Potter’s body twisting on the floor, green eyes wide in pain, and Snape shouting “No!”. He saw the professor’s fury, Potter still trying and being knocked over. Then a firm grip wrapped around his arm, and he was running again. Next thing he saw was the hall of the Manor, and his startled eyes fixing him from one of the mirrors, frozen in terror, and for a moment, they looked green.
“Of-fucking-course I am aware mudblood Granger is above me in all but one subject, father, fuck you very much”. His father was always too far gone in his rants to notice the mumbled words, and Draco would just wait until the lecture was over to plaster a complacent expression over his features and nod meekly, ever the perfect son.
“I would get it if you rather not. But I’d like to see. . . To understand. . . “ It was hard to explain what he was trying to achieve, as he was unsure of it himself “At my trials, if we want to call them so, they said it was Dumbledore’s wish to protect my soul. Snape had tried to help me, all along, but I was too arrogant. . .Sure that all he wanted was to steal my glory” He swallowed “I wanted revenge. . . On you, Potter. For something that wasn’t even your fault. Then I suppose I was just too desperate to see reason. . . I was the one that had to do it, I couldn’t take the risk. . . When the time came, and he did it instead, I was relieved”. Draco felt suddenly tired. Old.
“I just don’t like being the centre of attention.” Potter scoffed, and Draco grudgingly acknowledged how it ringed true.
He scratched the back of his head, stalling for words. “We all have flaws. Take Dumbledore and Snape, for example. Were they good men? Ultimately. But they made plenty of bad decisions”. He turned to the graves, that were barely visible between the branches of the lush vegetation. “It’s all a matter of what we learn from our errors.”
Cat Ron glared, digging his sharp nails in the soft skin of Draco’s stomach. They both hissed and Potter looked at him with a tiny, knowing smile.
So, he had sold his grandfather’s vintage car, almost legally, with just a little push of magic to help move the transaction along.
“Do I have to ask him out, or will you?” Theo stopped with his fork in midair to send him a meaningful gaze.
In the last weeks more and more students from the upper years had followed, vanishing into thin air under the Carrow’s noses.
How had his life turned from an uncertain future to a reality of adolescent problems and dickhead friends, only Merlin knew. But Draco wouldn’t have it any other way.
It was Draco’s turn to flush, but he accepted a plain white t-shirt without complaints. Even if it was a bit too big on the shoulders, he couldn’t deny his shirt was way too stuffy for the weather. He wondered if wearing Potter’s clothes was going to become a habit, but drew the line at the bright orange swimming shorts the prat had offered with a smirk.
Summer of 1997 was a completely different matter. His home, his pride and the place of most of his childhood treasured memories, was no longer empty, but the company was far from what younger Draco had imagine in his wistful fantasies.
He waved Lupin off and stared blankly at the kitchen ceiling. “Dandy”, he heard his own voice croaking in the distance. “Just fucking great”.
He almost laughed at the image his mind evoked of a Potter reluctantly sitting at a dinner table under the uncharitable scrutiny of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, jolting cat Ron in the process.
“Er. . . Yeah, well chrysanthemums in Australia represent mothers. They are often just called Mums. . . And we wouldn’t have won this war without mothers”. He had lifted his gaze and looked directly at Draco. They held each other eyes for a moment, before the Gryffindor broke contact “The red ones signify love and devotion”. The faint colour on his cheeks had lingered for a while.
“Sweet. If you want to have a look at the room now… This is mine” He said, gesturing at the space around them. Only then Draco looked, surprised at finding the bedroom to be an organised chaos. Clothes were piled on top of a chair, a few pairs of shoes and flip-flops poking from under the bed. His mother would have frowned in disapproval, but Draco found it strangely homely, proof of how much the last year had messed with his head.
Draco, that so far had spent most time quietly observing from the side, looked nervously at Daphne, who had moved closer. He searched for the other Slytherins but found the two Seventh years sitting with the artistic Hufflepuff boy he had discovered was called Tam, going trough his sketchbook.
Vincent shot a curse in his direction and Draco panicked, grabbing his arm to stop him from casting a second one. It was irrational, he knew he was playing with fire, standing in the middle of two flames that could easily burn him. He wasn’t the Trio’s friend, he had no apparent reasons to stop the other Slytherin from attacking them, at least in their eyes. But inside him, he knew he didn’t believe that. He was sure of whom he wanted to win the war. Even if he was the enemy in it, even if maybe it was too late for him to be on the other side. So he stopped Vincent, trying to rationalise, and the other boy looked at him in disbelief “Who cares what you think? I don’t take your orders no more, Draco. You an’ your dad are finished.”
“I dunno, he sounds alright.” Potter called, already halfway to the kitchen, where he picked a box of dried food and started pouring it into a dotted bowl on the floor that Draco had completely missed earlier. “Glad to know you have already got me figured well enough to make a judgment, though”. Draco was relieved to notice his voice seemed simply amused.
Dumbledore, however, called his bluff, seemingly knowing all the struggles Draco had endured during the year, all the horrible things he had almost done. “Maybe your heart wasn’t really in it”
Only his mother had ever loved him so profoundly. And even then, he was still there, fighting in a war he was raised into. Fitting like a cheap suit in a role he was led to believe he wanted.
The problem with Felix Felicis, Draco considered as they stepped outside, was that it lulled you into a false sense of security. He wanted to panic, he really did, but the insistent humming in his blood overrode his senses with the certainty that he was on the right path. It was like being drunk, and he could only hope that it didn’t lead to the same sort of regrets.
“Oh, right, I thought I was forgetting something.” Potter said, releasing the arm that had snatched around Draco’s waist for support. “That’s Ron.”
“You are a Malfoy and as such you are better than most. There is no wrong in acknowledging it, so put your inferiors in their place” 11 years old Draco had been lectured by his father just before boarding the first of many trains to Hogwarts.
Later on, much later, he would wonder if it had been fate that led him to what was, no doubt, the rashest decision of his life. The right circumstances, that one single drop enough for the glass to spill.
“Is that why you are clueless about how to properly work a vhs player? Did you have someone else doing it for you?” Potter joked.
“It doesn’t seem like something you would enjoy” Draco mused and he could see a flick of irritation passing in the other wizard’s eyes.
“Hello” Potter said smiling, with an awkward little wave that had Draco’s lips tugging at the corner in response. “I am Evan”.
Draco had heard that Potter was in a safe place, probably with his muggle family, but the protection would vanish the day he was to become of age, on July 31st. In a week. Draco thought of his own birthday, the excitement of finally becoming an adult tampered by the events and the fear of what was to happen. He wondered if Potter was aware of the impending threat on what should have been a happy day in the life of a young wizard. He knew that the other boy was most likely prepared but couldn’t help wishing that Potter could still live the days up to his birthday with some sort of normal anticipation and joy. He used to be jealous of Potter but living in close quarters with the Dark Lord made him realise what a fool he had been. No fame was worth being the target of such darkness.
Is this absolute rubbish? Probably. But I had to get it out anyway. This year is getting the best of me and I am absolutely stressed out, so this is my way to distract myself.
Soon, like an insect attracted to the light, he felt his feet change course and carry him towards the other boy.
Draco sat on the edge of the bench, and together they watched as the rain drops disturbed the surface of the lake with a soft tapping sound.
“Stop, Theo, please. It wasn’t me, it was him. He was riding that broom, I didn’t- I wasn’t. It was his choice. . . It wasn’t me, you have to believe me Theo!” He was aware he was blabbering, but he couldn’t care.
He sounded excited and Draco knew the implications of being the ones to hand over Potter to the Dark Lord.
“Maybe you need to go back, if you can’t even transfigure a bowl”. And maybe being young wasn’t so bad, he thought, trowing some pebbles in the water.
“Merlin, Draco. It’s not too late! Stop before you are in too deep!“ His eyes were pointedly fixed on Draco’s  pale, unblemished forearms.
Draco was trembling and only a quick glance to his mother, steady and composed, helped him to recover some sort of control.
Then someone agreed, saying it would make things easier, and more and more voices gave their consent, drifting the conversation into other directions. Soon the table was buzzing again with chatter and laughter.
His gaze, once again, roamed subtly over the boy on the floor. He doubted that the recent healthy glow and tanned freckles that had taken the place of the underfed and skittish orphan would go completely amiss between the hormone-fuelled walls of Hogwarts, fame or not. He had never before stopped to consider if Potter was attractive, his irritating personality enough to overshadow everything else. Evan James, though, had a lean waist, long legs and the loveliest eyes Draco had ever seen. It felt only marginally better to think of Potter as someone else.
“Draco, you don’t understand” Theo said sharply, eyes searching his almost in a silent beg “I am forgotten. And I intend it to stay that way”.
“The only apologies you should make are to your Ravenclaw for that atrocious hat you are wearing” he drawled, peering at the offending accessory as if it was personal.
But his eyes locked with Theo’s washed out blue, and Theo was crying, pointing a trembling finger at him “You killed him! You killed him! I told you, Draco, not to go too far.”
After agreeing to have the new contract ready to sign by the next morning, she was just reminding them to bring a copy of Draco’s documents with them when he had thought it appropriate to dig out his wallet and hand over his bank card-thing.
The letter arrived a few weeks after his birthday, just like the one that told him he was admitted into Hogwarts 8 years before. He was having breakfast with his mother in the little space by the kitchen they had refurnished for that purpose. The dining hall held too many bad memories and this arrangement felt cosier, more like home. His father was at the Ministry, giving his statement on what he knew about the other Death Eaters involved during the war. Draco had been absolved on the fact that he had been young. Just a boy. And, despite his actions had lead to casualties, he had never actually delivered the last blow. He had stood in front of the Wizengamot feeling small and lucky. It was Dumbledore’s wish, someone had said, and so he was free. His mother had never been marked and was involved only on the side, only until the matter touched her family personally. And then, she had lied to Voldemort. For her son. For Potter, someone had said again. And so she was free. His father had informations, and his testimony was important. Valuable. Enough to let him out with just a minor sentence. House arrest, restrained usage of magic. They were free, and Draco felt grateful but uneasy.
Draco watched in bewilderment as Nagini, the snake, rose from the floor and came to rest across the Dark Lord’s shoulders. The wizard stroke her absentmindedly.
Harry didn’t seem distressed, thought. Eyes lost to the blur of 9 am traffic, he appeared merely deep in thoughts. There was a soft smile parting the boy’s lips and that was enough to strengthen his resolve.
Harry slumped gracelessly in his seat, all teenage lankiness in a twisted slouch that would have left an older body aching for days.
Potter had flushed when Granger had asked the others for permission, to which she had laughed and told them about sending him into a flower shop during their trip “I really needed to get something for. . . A person. Anyway, I was so nervous and I asked Harry to go instead. He spent the best of an hour discussing with a Muggle about the meaning of flowers. . . It was really sweet”. She had added, smiling softly at her friend.
His eyes darted to Granger’s clenched fists. The ghost of pain from her knuckles on the delicate skin of his cheek sent a red alarm to his brain, almost enough to have him backtrack on his current plan of fucking with them.
The Ravenclaw hushed but not even the promise of a particularly nasty detention could wipe the smirk off his face. From the look of admiration and interest in Boot’s eyes while he talked about the three Gryffindors, Draco wouldn’t be surprise if the boy was to jump on Granger at the first sight of her.
Also, Theo is probably my favourite character to write. He doesn’t say much but I feel connected to all he says.
“Although mine is slightly less pretentious” his grin was getting bigger and Draco felt one of his own tugging at the corners of his lips.
“Ah. Very well, and where do you think you are going? All students are required to follow me to the Great Hall” and he gestured back at the entrance of the Slytherin dormitories.
“Fat chance. Talk. What did you do with Potter?” A new fear rose in his guts, the reality of what Professor Lupin was making his head spin with gruesome possibilities. He retreated further until his back hit the wall.
“It’s a tricky enchantment” Professor Flitwick explained, proud. “It’s tuned with emotions and will respond with the colour you need the most in the moment you step on it.”
“Good,” said the Dark Lord. He drew  out his own wand and compared the lengths. To Draco’s horror Lucius made an involuntary movement; for a fraction of a second, it seemed he expected to receive the other wizard’s wand in exchange for his own. The gesture was not missed and the Dark Lord’s eyes widened maliciously.
He wanted to refuse but his treacherous hand had already reached halfway to the box. The lady nudged it closer with an encouraging nod.
Draco watched as the two remaining boys sat down, their feet grazing the water. They were staring at each other awkwardly, but both were grinning. Then, Boot reached for the other boy’s hand and intertwined their fingers.
So that was the prophecy over which his father was now rotting in Azkaban. It didn’t make sense, Draco thought wildly. Neither can survive. It was worded in such a strange way, it almost sounded as. . .
Unable to actually talk about Merlin and whatever twisted interpretation Muggles had on magic, Draco ventured on the other aspect of the Animation that had bothered him.
“Have you ever used a pensieve?” The other boy asked, clutching a small bottle filled with a silvery substance in between liquid and gas.
“Hey” He greeted, his heart beating so fast he might have been dying. It felt like dying, if dying was exhilarating, and somewhat good.
Draco, who had been listening incredulously, put down the piece of toast he had been holding in the air for far too long. “As if that would be wise”, he commented, still dazed. It was not a possibility he had considered.
He looked at these three young faces, and at their eyes. Brown. Blue. Green. And inside, a fire burning. The destiny of the world in the hands of a bunch of kids, and they had a chance.
He got a whiff of the stench before he saw the people. The strong odour of blood and dirt was out of place within the pristine four walls of the drawing room. Greyback. Draco had only ever seen the werewolf twice before, but he would never forget the scent of death that always seemed to accompany him. A small group of prisoners was being dragged into the room, bounded to each other, back to back. From his position on the armchair by the fireplace he could only spot the matted red hair of the tallest one. A quite tall one. Oh no. No no no. Draco swallowed.
He vaguely registered the cooling sting of tiles against his cheek and an oddly familiar voice telling him “I’ll be back” before he passed out again.
The timbre was vaguely familiar but lacked the instant recognition of an intimate connection and Draco’s curiosity suddenly spiked in tune with his heartbeat. It wasn’t fear exactly that prompted him to move slowly, as to avoid alerting the other person of his rouse, but caution. The instinctual need to assess the situation before revealing his cards, so to gain the upper hand in case of danger.
Harry stood there, embarrassed but a little proud. Draco saw Granger’s tears, and knew the Gryffindor’s friends were too. And while he shared the feeling, he wanted to have a reason to be proud of himself, too. And Draco had learnt a lot from his mistakes. Maybe more than any of the other young faces standing there. They were all silent, looking at Harry as if waiting for more. So he gathered all the courage that he didn’t feel he possessed and walked towards the other boy.
A few days before, after Draco had entered the library in search of material for their latest Potion assignment, a group of younger Ravenclaw had stood up and left. They had looked in his direction and declared they didn’t feel comfortable to be in the same place as someone like him. Draco had recognised one of the girls as Karli Webbs, who’s mother was killed during the war while on the run with other Muggleborns. Part of him had wanted to retort, to tell them that he was just their age when his life was turned upside down and that he had paid dearly for his stupid decisions, but the bigger part understood where they came from. It was the first time he had been directly confronted about his past but he knew that others, like Silas Avery in sixth year and even 12 years old Amanda Atkinson, whose family was only moderately connected to the Death Eaters’ activities, had received similar comments. And Pansy. He had frozen in place, unsure of what to do. Then Luna had walked by, putting a gentle hand on his shoulder, just a quick brush, and whispered “Don’t worry, I think they meant blond people. They don’t seem to like me that much either”. He had blinked. Harry, who was just leaving with the Ravenclaw, had sniggered, giving his friend a look of pure affection. The comment was so innocent, and thoughtful, and surreal that Draco had found himself softly chuckling too. And like that, the feeling of inadequacy had dimmed to an insignificant tingling on the back of his neck. Prejudice would always exists and maybe in some measure he deserved it, but he had changed. If some couldn’t or refused to see it, others did, in that quiet yet heart-warming way kind people do. They didn’t scream it for the wind to carry, but they showed it to him nonetheless. It was that easy acceptance that made it all ok. That was important and what mattered over everything. But Draco knew that it went both ways.
Draco allowed himself an almost welcomed moment of internal panic, before letting the calming effects of the potion settle his thumping heart. “No!” He assured, cringing at how loud it came out. Letting out a long breath, he fumbled for an explanation, glad to hear his tone of voice was back to a normal level. “Truth be told, I need a place to stay. I’m not sure that mold infested hovel I slept at can be even accounted as an accommodation, unless you are a goblin, which I am not -“.
As the two inconvenient nuisances they so insisted on being, it was only natural that Potter’s sidekicks chose that exact moment to cross paths with him.
“People will like you for who you are”. The distraught faces of Ron and Hermione, tear streaked and lost, ignite a different kind of guilt. Some already have, it’s what he wanted to say.
“Yeah. . . Okay.” Potter agreed again “The memories were given to the Wizengamot as evidence, but I think they have been returned. Let me talk to McGonagall and see if we can arrange a time for you to use the pensieve in her office. Tomorrow would probably be best, before all the students are back from the holidays on Tuesday” he closed the hand that was still caressing the cold stone into a fist, but left it lingering a bit longer before turning to leave.
Finally in the next chapter we will have D and H in the same place alone. In Snape’s head, very romantic, i know
There weren’t many people on the roads, and none paid him any attention. It wasn’t like Draco expected Potter to bump into him in the middle of Chestnut Avenue, so he just kept walking until his shirt was plastered against his warming skin and he was suddenly very thirsty.
“They don’t teach you how to ride bicycles at school, you nimwit!” He ventured, feeling less confident about such claims that his voice let on.
“Much better than this one!” And Draco suddenly remembered something that Muggle woman had said at the cafe.
I was like Oh boy, Potter! This guy looks a lot like my idea of Harry, glasses aside. I like to visualise a character when i write, so my Harry is a lot like this, good looking but not over the top swooning sort of thing, just normal, on the thin side, with wavy messy hair and very pretty eyes.
“I appreciate the difficulty of your position,” said Dumbledore. “Why else do you think I have not confronted you before now? Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realized that I suspected you.”
The other boy sighed “Snape, and even Dumbledore, had taught me the world is not black and white. There are different types of courage. He went against his beliefs, against a mindset he had build for himself out of abuse and neglect . . . He wanted to belong and because the Muggle world hadn’t been kind to him he sought it in the magical one, to an extreme. . . I’d disliked him, even hated him, but now I think I understand a bit. At the end, he sacrificed all his life out of what he felt for my mother, and regardless of the reason, what he did was fundamental for ending the war. As for me dying, with a piece of Voldemort’s soul in me that was the only way, just a fact. . . And I think Dumbledore knew me well. . . He was right, I didn’t want to die, but I wanted other people to live more. Neither him or Snape forgave themselves in life, so yeah, I think I do”.
From his new position he could discern the idents of Potter’s spine as he sprawled gracelessly on the floor, half bent inside the cabinet.
Draco scoffed and was about to sidestep around the toy to follow the moving queue, when someone from behind tripped over him. Draco watched as a boy around his age stood back up holding the bunny and giving him a weird look.
He would never taste someone else’s tongue in his mouth, and for the first time that year he felt the unwelcome jolt of raw want in his gut. His gaze lifted on its own accord.
“It was truly a lovely place” he replied, willing his smile not to slip at yet another jab at his conscience, “but, H-Evan, all your parents ever wanted, in spite of fancy boarding schools and expensive things, was for you to be happy.”
There was something, a bittersweet memory, but patience was stretching thin on both sides and someone had to give “Well. My mother, when I was little, she used to call me Dee. So, something like Dean I guess.” Like that Muggleborn Gryffindor that was banging the girl Weasel, Draco thought hysterically. His mother would be so proud.
“Don’t mind him. He was dropped on the head one too many times and he is now afflicted by. . .Idiocy” Potter shrugged, not really answering the question. He still looked guarded, and Draco felt the need to rectify that.
By the time he had collected the rest of his belongings from the moving line that appeared to be spitting luggage after luggage from a hole in the wall, his stomach was rumbling painfully for attention. Surprised that his bag had made it safely through two stops and what was no doubt the longest journey of his life, he followed the signs towards the exit.
The Hat waited silently for the first trembling child to take a seat on the stool before appointing each one of the new students into their future House. It spoke the four names of the Founders loud and clear, with a tone of defiance odd for an inanimate object. A word for each child, said in a confident way as if challenging someone to object, and the meaning behind it was transparent to Draco’s ears. You are who you are, be proud, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. But also, be open.
Lupin sighed “I guess thief has made my resume, among all the other things. . . Well, not exactly but Albus was the only one I knew who had one, and it was clearly what he wanted. . .”
Draco remembered thinking, that night on the tower, that the man in front of him was already dead. He remembered vaguely registering the signs of a dying body, his conscience gripping onto each and every one as an excuse to ease his guilt. The slight but incessant tremor in the limbs, the sickly gray tinge of the skin. And that hand, withered fingers just hanging loosely against Dumbledore’s thigh. But only now, up close, he could really see the damage and what he saw made his stomach churn. Dying, and it looked like there wasn’t much of that year left.
Before he could think about it, another of the things that had been exchanged over the breakfast table, came out of Draco’s mouth with a glee he didn’t expect “Nothing to stop you, now that you are a free man”.
Out of depth and time in between the tees and shorts clad youths of the Californian coast. Maybe the potion had wanted to give him just that, a private corner of “different” where he could feel the most like himself, as much as he himself would never have dared to associate with such an establishment before. As it was, he felt quite at ease in the presence of the stranger in front of him and her odd taste in furnishing.
Draco, before, would have never given it the time of day. As it was, Draco now barely spared the chalkboard that inanely proclaimed “Come to the Math side, we have Pi” a glance and pushed the door open with a thrilling sense of anticipation.
Lupin fixed him with a pointed look and clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth in disapproval.
The dawn light was starting to filter through the moth-eaten curtains and Draco almost bemoaned the fact that no Muggle had attempted to rob him during the night. He knew that hours of inaction hadn’t helped with his current state of mind, and he found that he was actually ready to face the day.
Also, I have a new tumblr blog called inconsequentialmania in which I am posting all my hogwarts related art, so if you want to check it out ✌🏼
“Dear Mister Malfoy” the letter read “we are pleased to inform you that, due to the events that prevented the completion of your NEWTS, you have been invited back to Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The year will not be mandatory but necessary if you are to finish your education.
“I guess it’s just us, that are unable to get over ourselves” Daphne murmured. “It was her idea, Tori’s, to come back. She said she didn’t believe in blood purity anyway, and that this was our opportunity to show we are more than just Slytherins. . . What was it for you? Why did you come back, Draco?”
The money was good. More than enough to buy Harry a complete wardrobe and a new pair of glasses with a thick, square frame. They sat differently across his slender face, accentuating all the right angles of his cheekbones and altering his features slightly, so that he was still recognisable but, at the same time not quite himself.
“Take two for good luck” She told him with a cheeky grin and Draco felt himself flush, obeying nonetheless.
“Great! I think Lisa and Sue will make it too, at some point during the week. . . And we are expecting a sixth year. I. . . I am happy Harry is coming back”. It was the same Ravenclaw that had spoken about the Trio’s adventure in the bank and Draco still thought he sounded very enthusiastic.
Deep in his heart sat the knowledge that he wasn’t likely to survive the war. It was more resigned acceptance than a feeling. He was the last man standing of a group that did everything together, and his death seemed the only natural conclusion. The last step bringing a friendship stronger than life, stronger than the limits of human form, to full cycle.
The crowd automatically turned to Harry and Draco noticed how his lips tightened and his posture stiffened in discomfort. Granger gave him a small understanding smile and shrugged apologetically. The boy replied with a if-I-must look and went to awkwardly stand near the Jasmine arch that marked the entrance of the Gardens.
The slanted curve of Blaise’s eyes, fixed on his face with that knowing look that curled Draco’s fingers into fists. He wanted to pound at the soft flesh of Blaise’s high cheekbones until smooth velvet turned purple with abuse, demanding who had appointed him to the Supreme Court of the High and Mighty.
“So you don’t even know if he is alive right now?” He spat, pondering on what he really wanted to ask.
So, when Harry wasn’t at dinner, Draco believed that sadness was something Harry wanted to deal with alone. He was about to leave for the Dungeons, when he met Granger’s gaze. “Quidditch field” she mouthed. Go and get him. And that was it, Draco had no more excuses. It was now or never.
“No” Weasley said, but the wizard interjected “Why didn’t you use the Cruciatus, that day with Carrow?”
Draco looked in horror as Longbottom rose to his feet and, keeping his eyes fixed on the other man, spat “Harry was a better teacher and a more powerful wizard that you’ll ever be”. Apparently Potter attitude was contagious. Although fundamentally stupid, Draco was impressed with Longbottom’s audacity, as he had begrudgingly been with Potter’s before.
“Wouldn’t want you getting too comfortable, now”. Draco huffed, reading the words in his head in the dry timbre he had come to associate with the other wizard.
Draco wanted to throw up, his stomach thigh and uncomfortable. All eyes were now and her and Snape confirmed his recognition. Draco found himself unable to watch, now that she had woken, but he had figured she looked about the same age as his professor and he wondered if perhaps they had been in school together. She was an inconsequential woman, not memorable, but something in his brain was telling him he knew who she was.
Also, I think it’s pretty clear who the POV is, and it will be revealed soon, but I just like writing with the element of doubt.
As the rest of his senses recovered he realised there was someone talking close by, words unintelligible against his pounding headache.
He shook his head “At the end, Snape’s wasn’t some grand action out of a change of heart, because of truly believing he had been wrong. . . It was personal. Hadn’t your mother died he would have probably continued to serve his cause”
It was well into the night when people started coming back to the Manor. Draco had barely moved from his position in front of the window, his right hand resting on the diamond-paned glass, relishing the cold feeling against his palm. The numbing ache in his fingertips kept him grounded, a gentle throb that anchored him to reality, and for a long time he had tried to concentrate on that sensation alone. It wouldn’t do to think of what was happening, not while there was still hope. In his left hand, resting along his body, was his wand. There was nothing he could do but its presence was comforting. His index finger was involuntary tapping against the smooth wood, the only movement in his otherwise still body. His eyes were trained on the property gate, and he must had forgotten how to blink because they felt dry and painful. Tired, but he wanted to know. Needed to know. From inside he couldn’t hear the telltale “pop” of apparition, so when a body suddenly materialised in the driveway he shot an involuntary stream of wild magic that left a nasty burn stain on the lush carpet. Even without the silver mask he wouldn’t have been able to make out the features of the person in the distance. The figure stood still, waiting, and soon others appeared in the proximities. They were moving now, agitated and when one of the hoods fell backwards Draco recognised the wild hair. Bellatrix. His aunt was pacing around, hands gesticulating frantically, in what looked like rage. His body trembled in trepidation. A dark cloud of smoke surged trough the sky and Lord Voldemort’s scream of fury held all the answers Draco had been waiting for. Potter was alive. That night not even the wails of pain coming from the dungeons could dim the little ray of hope that was warming his heart.
He had never seen Bellatrix so terrified. The Dark wizard was growing more and more agitated and Draco knew that, to act now when it was so risky for his life, Potter must be into something very important. He could feel the momentum building, things were about to happen. The end was near.
The other wizard rubbed his face, looking extremely old in a young broken shell “I was the one that found Harry on the train, the day you broke his nose. Although, I couldn’t be sure it was you. We didn’t exactly have time to talk”
The round table was out again, but instead of being placed in the centre of the room they had moved it all the way to the left. It was crammed with food and drinks of all kinds, courtesy of the house elves and the Irish heritage of the Gryffindors. Soft music was playing on the background and students sat comfortably on the few sofas they had transfigured and on the blankets spread all over the floor. Hogwarts had never felt so young and lively. Draco was coming back from the loo, when a voice called him from one of the alcoves.
The words were in his throat “Because he is nothing more than a pig for slaughter. Because Potter has to die and knowing him he will do it willingly. He will sashay to his death with his chin raised, shielding the rest of the world with his massive ego and his trice-damned hero complex that, honestly, is starting to get boring. Because there are no other options, don’t you understand, you stupid dreamer?” But he swallowed before any of that made it past his tongue.
“Yaxley. Snape. You are very nearly late”. The two men didn’t speak but took their allotted spaces when ordered to sit.
Draco stepped closer, and the snatchers scooted the prisoners roughly so that he could see the boy better. He was afraid of what he would see. He kept his eyes levelled with the other wizard’s shoulders, that reached just about an inch below his own. He hadn’t seen Potter in a long time, but he was aware they were almost the same height by sixth year.  The bones protruding too oddly to be healthy were an indication that the person in front of him was half starved and the wayward locks that almost reached his shoulders, curling just below the ears, were telling of a long period deprived of proper self care.
Maybe it would all end in disaster. Maybe he would never see Harry again, and the loss was already unbearable. Maybe he was a foolish man.
Draco wasn’t sure what to make of this new, carefree version of the moody boy he remembered from Hogwarts. After all that had happened in the last year, he was tempted to let himself be pulled into the flow and enjoy being simply seventeen for once. Lupin might have robbed Potter of many things, but it was clear that he had given him back his youth.
She moved her mouth to speak, but he had to get it out “I want to apologise. I should probably be in Azkaban for what I did to you, but I’m not and just because I was extremely lucky. You were just an easy target and all I could think about was myself and my safety. . . I didn’t stop to consider you in the picture. I’m not asking for forgiveness but, for what is worth, I am sorry.”
It was the deject that Draco could hear in his voice that made him add, almost as an afterthought “The prophecy”. Damn self control.
And, as Draco could testify from his favourable position dead centre in this ever so amusing game of piggy in the middle, neither did the Dark Lord.
He knew that some of the Death Eater had managed to sneak their way into the dungeons already, probably looking for their children, but so far most of them had been contained outside the perimeters of the school. Now it was clear that Hogwarts was losing ground. Draco’s stomach churned and twisted and, while the world crumbled around him, he thought of his parents. Once proud, powerful. Now wandless, broken, at the mercy of people they had never showed mercy for. He last saw them at the Manor and even then he knew well that their goodbye, for once full of emotions, could have been the last. He thought of them, that had birthed him into this life hoping to give him everything and were now denied the simple wish to see their son for what could be the final time. He had no doubts the Malfoys, fallen from grace, weren’t between the lucky ones who were helped to sneak into the school in search of their children.
He had always thought the Imperius to be the most lenient of the Unforgivables, almost not justifiable to be in the league with the Cruciatus and the Killing Curse. But Professor Achebe gave him a new perspective.
Potter, the absolute fuckwit, had started wheezing, grabbing him by the arm and, with the half arsed excuse that he was “Home schooled”, dragging him upstairs after a promise that they would be back in the morning.
Luna smiled sadly “We know, we saw what you did. He would have liked it, his wand was quite precious to him”.
“Well, that’s not entirely true. I think he travelled a bit, at the beginning. But Evan James wanted to go to California, and I have my reasons to believe he came back where he started. He settled by the coast, at least. And. . .I have something that can help us.”Lupin confessed, like he was already regretting it.
The woman laughed and Draco was starting to lose the thread of the conversation, growing more nervous by the minute. Every little revelation about Potter’s new life made it obvious how he himself was no longer part of it. The boy that had been such a constant during the most part of his formative years was now as good as a stranger. The realisation left him feeling surprisingly lonely.
On his way, he saw a bucket of dead rats just outside Hagrid’s hut. An idea flashed in his mind and he quickly aimed an Accio at it.
He had, despite himself, been impressed by the animation, as Potter had called it. Moving images was a fourth year charm, and not an extremely easy one at that, so achieving it without the help of magic was something even he couldn’t discount.
It was surprisingly insightful and, at the same time, it left no doubts about what this really was. A goodbye.
People were rushing outside and he didn’t want to go, didn’t want confirmation. They were screaming, Potter was dead.
He wanted to say it all, and more. He wanted to shout it and watch as the other man's knees buckled as the futility of his attempt to give Harry Potter a better future dawned on him.
Pansy dug her nails further into the fabric of the sofa and turned away from him. “I’ve seen it happening to you too, Draco. People saying you shouldn’t be here, that you don’t deserve to. Those Ravenclaws last week. . . Fifth years! And you didn’t say anything. Why are you letting people treat you like this?”.
They were eight when the Weird Sisters had made it into the bronze collection of the chocolate frogs cards. When Theo had found the one with the picture of the Lead Guitarist of the band, just 17 and fresh out of Hogwarts, he had inspected it with a great deal of interest, before declaring, in front of Narcissa, that he was going to marry him. Draco, who had been looking at Kirley Duke’s smooth, shiny hair with a twinge of irritation, had replied that that wasn’t possible, as the guitarist was a man. They had argued until his mother’s intervention.
But, watching Harry munching on a piece of buttered toast with the carefree countenance of a young man that had no worries for the future, he had never wished more for his own chance at a smooth ride.
But April wasn’t time for raspberries and Luna was in his house and things had changed. The Dark Lord was busy elsewhere and the prisoners in the dungeons weren’t screaming so Draco could almost pretend they didn’t exist. Almost. He hadn’t dared going to visit Luna, not with his aunt roaming the place like a wild beast. They weren’t friends and they had no reasons to be. She was alive, he knew as much, and he could only hope that after months in captivity that wasn’t the worse fate. He knew from experience what a prolonged period in a cage, even one without bars, could do to one’s sanity.
The other boy looked unfazed, but Draco could see Scott’s amused grin at the corner of his eye, so he added lamely “Sorry, I am let jagged.”
“What?” He whispered, alarmed. He was conscious his eyes were still set on Harry, who was chatting animatedly with Theo, of all people. He was still wearing his knitted yellow hat, which was ridiculous considering they had been inside for at least half an hour. His hair were barely contained and escaped in thick curls over the bridge of his nose. Draco knew Harry struggled with his own sense of guilt but, in that moment, he looked young and completely relaxed talking with Theo. He shook away a strange pang in his chest he didn’t really want to dwell on.
“Yes, the Merlin be damned prophecy that declares our precious Potter as the saviour he was born to be. The teenage hero of those badly written romances 14years old touch themself reading, coming with his wand and his second year spells to win against the fairly superior villain and free us all. That. Prophecy.”
This is mainly dialogue actually. I hope I did fine and that it flows. It’s a bit of a filler chapter but I need to get Draco on that plane 🧐
He tossed it to Draco, who couldn’t help but catch it, before turning to tidy the mess he had made all over the floor.
Dried blood caked his left cheek, tilted towards  the floor. A stark trail of bright red stood out against his clammy skin, starting at the tip of his nose and accumulating  in a lone bead just below his  ear. He watched as the droplet filled, following the tug of gravity towards the sticky pool that drenched the boy’s hair and the carpet.
“I wasn’t trying not to be seen” Draco retaliated. The other boy turned around, letting his leg dangle from the edge of his makeshift seat and addressed him with a curious tilt of his head. He was holding a small intricate object in his hands, thumb lazily brushing soft circles on the surface, and Draco felt a surge of recognition “Is that a magical puzzle box?”. He had more than once delighted himself by solving the testing riddles but the patience required didn’t seem to click with his idea of the boy in front of him.
Was she suggesting. . ? The opportunity of being in close quarters with Potter during the month he needed for the other boy to turn of age was just too good to miss. It would give him the time to build his trust so that the blow of the eventual lash out, once the Gryffindor had regained all his memories and temper, could be significantly lessen. Hopefully this way Potter would give him the time to explain, before hexing him.
Like all students of age, he was given the option to floo to Hogsmeade and walk back to school, instead of boarding the train in London. So it was only after dinner, when Longbottom and the girl Weasley confronted him in an empty corridor, that he found out Luna had been taken.
He swallowed, but kept his chin raised and his cards exposed. He was aware of being on the wrong side of the blade, but Lupin seemed too Gryffindor to notice or to abuse his own power.
“I think it was made innocently enough, as much as anything owned by my beloved family can be considered such. It was meant to absorb the wild magic of children before they were ready enough to use it, something to avoid them accidentally breaking one of these rich assholes’ delicately evil heirlooms. I am sure Great Grandfather Black and his delightful gang of blood purists enjoyed using it on Muggleborns to weaken their magic. All charm and snake. Pretty lady, a special gift to adorn your lovely neck-“ his voice had taken a mockingly concerned tone “and there you have it, Your Honour, a squib. Of course, I will take her into my service, poor thing. It was one of Mother’s favourite bed time stories”. He had concluded bitterly.
“Subtle.” Draco muttered, rolling his eyes to the vacant surroundings. The pink cover glimmered back in response.
Draco started to feel unsettled and confused, buckling under Dumbledore’s sudden stare. None of the accusations sounded like they were directed at him and he thought that his confession might have finally broken the pillars of the Headmaster’s precarious sanity. The hysterical image of pins flashing bright, welcoming Dumbledore as a member of Draco’s “Nutters Club”, invaded his mind, further proving the fact that he was indeed losing it.
Draco was wondering if he could just leave some money on the counter and quietly slip away to plot his next move, when he felt Ellen’s gaze directed at him. The Muggle looked pensive for a moment before asking “Have you got a place to stay, boy?”
“I am just checking, Theo” He tried to reassure him. On his way out he whispered to Blaise “Stay. Stay with him. Please”.
The sky had cleared and the airplanes stood in contrast against the blue, faint tails of white going in all directions. He had never been a believer, but today he wanted to. He wanted to imagine James and Lily watching their son fly.
Speaking of apologies, Draco moved to Harry, who had reached them. “I feel like you are the only one I haven’t apologised to, Potter” he stated formally.
A hand tapped gently on his knee. Draco knew he must have looked a fright when he turned to face the elderly lady sitting next to him, his eyes wild and his split lip sucked in between his teeth.
Lupin sat cross-legged on the kitchen floor, his wand pointed right above the bowl, and started chanting something in a hushed, lulling voice. Cloudy liquid slowly filled the basin, setting the precious stones encrusted in its rim alight. Their reflections danced around the room, accentuating the white scar tissue that marred most of the werewolf’s skin. Draco felt an odd pang of regret for calling the man a creature when the pain of a lifetime was so clearly etched all over his human flesh.
Anyways, I hope you enjoyed the chapter. I don’t know why but I never considered Remus one to cry easily. I guess his life experience hardened him somehow in that instance.
Anyway this chapter has a few things taken from the original book but hopefully not too much to make it boring.
She yelled something about one of her weird creatures and with a swift motion Potter pulled something on top of his head and vanished.
Even the smallest chance of recognition, even the tiniest possibility of Harry reacting to his name being called, was too dangerous. The only way for the boy to disappear and finally have his shot at normality was to cut every single tie to the past.
But the clock ticked to zero and the steps were now voices and Dumbledore was falling with all his answers. Draco stood frozen, fingers tight around two wands and a glass vial. Until Snape’s hand tugged at his wrist, dragged him down the stairs and eventually lost grip in the chaos waiting for them inside the castle.
Potter gestured for him to come closer to a richly carved basin sitting inside the cabinet next to the vials one.
He didn’t have an answer, so he stood, emptying his half eaten plate in the bin and setting it by the sink.
With the second mirror safely stored at his grandparents’ Muggle house as the only connection left, it was time to let Harry go.
Theo rolled his eyes but diverted his attention back to his chicken, leaving Draco to feel twice victorious.
And then it was chaos. Draco saw Vincent aiming a Cruciatus at Potter and cried hysterically “STOP. The Dark Lord wants him alive —“ because that was reasonable. That might stop him.
“Water. Yeah, water would do.” He replied, wishing his stomach to stop growling so that he could get going.
Harry paid it no mind though, his eyes peering at his surroundings with indolent curiosity. Most of his focus was on the generous breakfast laid in front of him, cheeks plumping whilst his jaw worked through three days worth of starvation.
“Uhm, no, I was thinking to stop here for a while.” He stammered, trying not to sound too eager. “I mean, yes, I would be. I am. Definitely.” He nodded, feeling his cheeks warm at his poor attempt to keep it together.
“Would you like me to cast an Impervious on your clothes?” Theo asked. He obviously hadn’t bothered on himself, so Draco shook his head.
“Who, Ron? Nah, we are just really good friends”. For a moment, Draco blanched. The other boy looked a bit thoughtful, as if surprised of his own joke. And suddenly, the mood significantly lightened.
His Professor had knocked his head against one of the lacquered doors hard enough to leave a small indent, and was now massaging his neck with a confused frown. “Ouch. . . I don’t- I don’t understand” he winced, looking up at Draco with glossy eyes.
“I am not afraid” he snarled, wand raised but the curse wouldn’t come. “it’s you that ought to be scared”.
“You do realise I just said at school, right? Anyway, I doubt you would have liked him either.” He replied, smirking at the thought of what a better friend he would have made compared to Weasley.
“You’re just a bad copy of your father”. Theo’s accusations echoed in his mind and, for the first time in his life, Draco felt he could reply “Not anymore.”
He uncorked the vial and let about one third of the potion fall onto his tongue, surprised at finding it completely tasteless. For whatever reason he had expected sweetness. As soon as the liquid had reached the back of his throat he felt pervaded by a strong sense of purpose and the compelling need to go for a walk.
Draco looked down at his new shoes, still doubtful. The black pair of high top sneakers stared back at him, not offering much consolation. “Absolutely not!”
He never wanted that, and once again he felt the weight of his actions. Did you really think you could get all the power and glory without dirtying your hands? He asked himself, and even if his mind pleaded him that he didn’t know, that he hadn’t thought about that consequence, his heart couldn’t quite believe it.
“Fine. I am gonna go, take care of this. Help yourself to the pantry. I went food shopping while you were trying on the 100th shade of burgundy, so bon appetit, Dean.” And Lupin departed in a flurry of garments that would have impressed Snape.
Lupin smiled sadly “It’s an adaptation of a charm that I haven’t used in many, many years. I had to tune it into your magical core, for the lack of better, as I didn’t really have a location exactly. . . Well, it’s complicated, but her magic is connected to yours by familiarity and it picked up her “signal”.” He made finger quotes in the air, looking awkward “All you need to know is that as long as your mother’s name is on that page she is we- alive.” He corrected, unwilling to make a promise he couldn’t keep.
The surface felt cold around his finger, but Draco had only a moment to register the sensation before he was hauled into a different scenery. The pull, unlike a portkey one, wasn’t uncomfortable and lasted merely a blink. He was amazed at how real it seemed. He could perceive the warmness of the ground, the heaviness of the summer air. The only indication that he was an intruder was the feeling of a light, smooth film on his skin, like a barrier between his body and the reality around him. It kept him aware he didn’t belong in there, that he couldn’t interact, couldn’t interfere. He looked at what seemed to be an old playground and notice that the other boy was staring intently at a little girl who was pushing herself on one of the swings, dark red hair floating around her face. Draco considered the cruel irony of having the only glimpses of your own mother from someone else’s memories. Lily Potter, as it turned out, would never be able to push her own son on a swing. But this Lily, this child in Snape’s mind, didn’t know that, so she swayed in the air, happy and carefree. And her son looked at her, drinking in all her smiles.
Than Macmillan said “Well, I think you were the last” and they resumed their discussion, giving a brief explanation of what they went into so far.
“Give him some credit, it was a last minute decision. Finding a new roommate for just the summer is always stressful.”
From this chapter the story should be a bit more interesting as they are not events properly described in the books. Its all from Draco’s prespective so we won’t really know what is happening to people he doesnt interact with but pretty much the same as in the books. I just changed the sectumsempra part and I will change what happens straight after the battle of Hogwarts.
He paused, feeling immensely stupid. He wasn’t used to have to explain himself, but they were all waiting “I envision it as a place where people would want to sit around and talk and spend time. Something to nibble on would —“ He tried.
“No —“ but Draco had seen the figure approaching, wand raised in his friend’s direction, and had jumped in front of Theo, shouting “Stupefy”.
Obtaining the documents, though, had been a completely different matter, and the amount of laws and ISWS (International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy) regulations he had broken would probably land him in Azkaban, if he was to be caught. All in all, he found that the prospect didn’t scare him as much as it should.
He thought about Theo and Blaise, probably fucking in their empty dorm while Blaise mind was on Daphne’s tits and Theo’s on Draco’s sins. He thought about Potter, the bastard that got out behind everybody’s back, with the shape of Draco’s knuckles still fresh on his skin. Maybe Potter was a product of his insane mind, and they were all crazy. Maybe Potter was Draco’s first step into the pit and he was a killer after all.
“No? Because I am pretty sure that even at Eton they teach you how to ride a bike.” He quipped, referring to Draco’s morning embarrassment.
Draco didn’t trust his voice and nodded, before darting into the room and slamming the door shut behind his back.
Draco was distracted, though. He was looking at the faces around the table. What looked like two Hufflepuff boys and two girls in his year were back, and so were three Rawenclaws wizards and a witch. Her sister was the only female Gryffindor, while Thomas, Finnegan and Longbottom were all there. The Trio was noticeably missing.
Unexpectedly, Theo chuckled “Do you remember when your mother had tried to convince us that my infatuation with Kirley Duke was just a normal interest of a little child for a celebrity?”
“Then we have no time”. Dumbledore eyed his wand, clutched tightly in the boy’s grip and sighed. With a twirl of his healthy hand a vial appeared out of thin air, steadily filling with the stream of pearly liquid coming out of the Headmaster’s right ear.
“Not exactly” Lupin actually smiled at that “but close. Do you remember how Hermione won a bottle of felix felicis in Slughorn’s competition?”
“Guess you’ll find out.” Lupin wrote, and Draco could feel the mocking tone through the page. “How did you find him?”
Instead Draco hunched his too thin shoulders and nodded in the direction of Vincent and Greg, a signal that they had things to do. Their responding grins made him sick, and he couldn’t decide if he was weak or just human.
The picture portrayed a boy that was most definitely Potter, standing under a banner proclaiming “Employee Of The Month”. A paper crown adorned with big, red hearts was pushed down over his hair and covered most of his eyes, balancing on the tip of his nose.
“I’m just gonna grab us something to drink. We have coke, oj, sparkling water… Maybe root beer, it’s actually alright!”
He followed Greg and Vincent, who had waited for Potter to separate from the group like predators. One. Alone. Easier. Draco wanted to run, get out of there, tell Potter he was just casually strolling in the room. Nothing to do with the other two, thank you very much. Potter who was startled. Clutching Draco’s wand.
“Whatever” He rolled his eyes and vindictively pushed past to enter the flat first. His victory was short lived, though, as just after crossing the threshold he stumbled over an orange blur that whizzed past him. It was only thanks to Potter’s seeker-quick reflexes that he didn’t end up sprawled all over the floor.
“Just about as well as a mourning widower. You’d think she is going to war and not just enrolling in the summer program and moving a few hours away.”
Touch him, Draco’s mind commanded. He wanted to reach out, but they weren’t there yet, so he tried to lighten the mood.
“It worked” Theo was watching Potter and, when he met the other boy’s eyes, gave him a little smile, to which the Gryffindor replied with an uncertain one of his own.
“You mean when he lashes out and hexes me into next century, therefore alerting everyone and their mothers of his secret location?” He couldn’t help the snark.
The other wizard stammered, unsure, although he didn’t look surprised. “But. . . I-why?”. It was a plea more than a question and, not for the first time, Draco thought about how deeply Potter was loved.
The pancakes tasted divine and he found that, when she asked again what had brought him into town, the answer coming out of his mouth was at least partially honest “I’ve arrived yesterday, but uh - yeah, not on holiday, precisely. Truthfully, life at- back home was getting out of hand and I. . .” He trailed off, feeling extremely inarticulate. How very Potter-esque of him, to forget the basic rules of speech, but his life was such a mess and there was just so much he could not explain to a Muggle.
Draco huffed “I’ve kissed Theo before” he supplied, but Potter didn’t react, so he stared impatiently.
“I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for you? But I have noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late. . . . What is it about my presence in your home that displeases you, Lucius?”
Potter and his friend bursted out laughing, and the tension Draco could perceive in the air dissipated, leaving them all smiling. He didn’t allow himself to think about how unsettling it was to have his nemesis regarding him with such an easy expression, when they had probably never shared a smile before.
“What an amazing sense of humor, no wonder we are best friends.” Draco scoffed, and then vindictively “And she only has you to thank for her wonderful year, doesn’t she?”
The other boy looked so comically offended that Draco couldn't help bending down to scratch behind the tabby’s ears, whispering “Don’t worry darling, let that vulgar boy keep his own Weasel. I think me and you are gonna be good friends.” He said the last part loudly enough to be heard, chuckling at Potter’s responding groan.
She gave him a long, calculating look. When Draco thought she wouldn’t reply, she spoke “Harry, he sometimes still. . . Feels guilty.”
Now, though, as an almost 17 years old, Potter wasn’t too skinny nor short. Now, he looked every inch the athletic git his skills already advertised him as, and Draco was bothered. He had towered over the other boy for years, giving him leverage where the Gryffindor begrudgingly bested him in fierceness and lionhearted bravado. Draco was a sensible person, after all, not a reckless idiot. Potter had decided to grow, though, and Draco had lost that advantage, knowing he was hard to look intimidating with those green eyes so annoyingly levelled with his own.
“Draco! Draco! Oh. . . Draco” she sobbed, holding him like he was the only thing that ever mattered.
Draco could see the terror in the eyes of the smaller children, too young and innocent to fully grasp the meaning of what was going on but aware that it was bad.
“We’re gonna be rewarded. We ’ung back, Potter. We decided not to go. Decided to bring you to ’im.” Vincent was saying to the Gryffindor, who looked tired and annoyed. He was trying to buy time, Draco could see that.
They stared at each other for a while. Draco was just about to raise an eyebrow at her persistence, when she unclenched her fingers and let go the ratty bunny she had been holding. She followed the fall and then looked back up, eyes boring into him with a silent invitation to interact.
Draco raised an eyebrow, not taking much offence at his friend’s accusations. He was living! But Theo was also a tad overdramatic. “Was that really necessary?”
While working on a design for the Gardens, they had decided to place one stone bench on each side of Dumbledore’s grave, facing the calming waters of the lake. Luna had said it would be like sitting for a chat with the Headmaster.
Slipping into his new trainers, Draco appreciated how the canvas was steadily breaking in to become the most comfortable pair he owned. He went through his bathroom routine quickly, poking at the dark skin under his eyes with a sort of detached acceptance. His hair was getting long. A poor attempt at fixing it a month prior had left the sides shorter and kind of choppy and the fringe brushing just below his eyebrow. It had now reached the eyelids, tickling annoyingly every time he shifted. Draco thought it fitted his new brooding aesthetic to a tee, leaving the pristine and polished image of the rich brat behind. He wasn’t that person any longer, and the realisation wasn’t as bitter as he had expected.
A little smile tugged at his lips and he wanted to bask in this newfound lightness. He had barely gotten a taste, though, when Dumbledore’s voice pleaded softly, almost as if directed at him “And I need you one more time. When I’ll be gone, you need to find what happened to Harry. You need to find him. . .”
“You have a point” the other boy laughed, like if it made sense. “Anyway, I think we shared. . . What did you call it? My strange fascination with red heads”.
He wasn’t even sure Daphne was still listening but, when he glanced at her, her eyes were shimmering.
Despite his upbringing, despite the tangled mess of opinions and facts that had been drilled into his brain from the moment he could articulate, part of Draco had admired his former Headmaster. After years of parroting Lucius’s words without questioning them, this new awareness came both as a shock and a relief.
So he turned to Pansy “It’s ok, because I was like that, and now I’ve changed. Maybe some day they will find their reason to change to”. And if they don’t it’s their loss, because the world with this new eyes looked brighter and a bit more colourful.
Would anyone else miss him, if he died, the way people would miss Potter? Potter, that had the name and the means to gain a crowd of adoring followers but instead spent his time building few but strong relationships. Meaningful. Important. Loving. He wished he could tell that 11 years old child that boarded the train feeling like a king that nobody would care for the shiny crown resting atop of the untended and forgotten grave. That a few people standing next to you are much more precious than the idolising thousand looking up at you from below.
There was no way, however, that Harry’s wouldn’t freak out at his incontrollable bursts of magic. What could have passed for tricks of an active imagination as a child, would definitely raise some questions in his 16 years old mind.
Draco drained his mug in two gulps and nodded, watching as the other boy filled his own with a dark liquid he had taken from the fridge. He couldn’t help raising an amused eyebrow when he noticed the “Pizza Slut” printed in bold letters across the white ceramic.
With each death he had witnessed, Draco’s beliefs had fallen one by one, like corpses, like victims of the war. The only positive victims of this stupid war, he supposed, for he was a changed person. He vowed that, if he had any, he would raise his children to be different from the boy he had been. With respect, to never make another feel inadequate when, like the son of Muggles that had died for the future of Wizards, they were just trying to be themselves.
As if able to follow his line of musing, the gaze of the Dark Lord fell upon his father and he requested Lucius to submit his wand.
“Draco, dear, dinner is about to be served” his mother’s voice called from outside his room and for a fraction of a moment pale fingers lingered on the frame of the door, left slightly ajar.
There was not much time, having to deal with the news of the missing boy spreading across the Wizarding Community like fiendfyre and with the bureaucratic nightmare that was forging someone’s new identity, but he was a skilled wizard and he had made it count.
“Well, if you must know, I have solved all of your problems. The obvious ones, at least” He teased, before Draco felt himself being dragged helplessly into the room “Ellen found you a stray!”
“I can get you the newspaper, clippings, whatever I can find. I am sure if anything happened to your mother it would make the news. I can keep an eye on Azkaban. . . Again, if she was harmed your father would certainly be informed.”
“Mother. . . Mum, I really can’t see the benefits of going back. I did terrible things, at Hogwarts”.
“Hell yeh is the Mark, it is. Time you weaklings get your shit sorted” Vincent barking voice called from near the door, startling Blaise awake.
On one side, provided he could find their location in the first place, he was doubtful his little stunt with their Ring Leader had brought him the favour of any of the members of the Order. On the other, he wasn’t that deep in denial to keep pretending he still wanted the dream-life of a Death Eater. He was stuck and his only hope was the man in front of him, who was eyeing him with a mix of impatience and weariness. It was probably time to tune down on the insults.
So Potter worked at the cafe. Draco briefly wondered if it had been the same sense of familiarity he was feeling that had first attracted Potter to this place, as well.
“She can’t help it. But you look uncomfortable, and no one expects you to go for breakfast and come out with a two months contract for a summer rental you didn’t ask for. So, you know, feel free to say screw it and go your way. No hard feelings.”
Harry was gone. Somehow, Draco didn’t know how, Harry was gone. He wasn’t able to resist the the mob any longer so he let himself be guided back to the Great Hall. It was chaos, but Harry Potter was alive. He had to be.
From there to his final destination was a rather quick trip in comparison. The smooching couple next to him was too busy staring into each other’s eyes to pay him any mind, which served Draco just fine.
“I have six!” Macmillan was blabbing “I am telling you, do you have a Garden? A proper Garden always has fountains”
“Eager, are we, little Lucius?” Amycus taunted him “Are you trying to redeem the family name after Daddy’s fall from grace?”
Draco shut the diary, finding that he wasn’t ready to answer that just yet. He had mixed emotions about the other man’s unexpected bouts of compassion, but it wouldn’t do him any good to dwell on why a rather simple question about his well being had reignited the now familiar ache of loneliness.
So, when a wisp of silvery smoke morphed into a phoenix, right before him, asking in Dumbledore’s grave voice, “Have you found him?”, his responding denial was resolute and confident.
He swallowed twice against the lump in his throat and blinked, willing the tears back. He had never cried in front of anyone but his mother, and he certainly wasn’t going to break apart in a pissy alley with Potter’s fanclub Leader as his witness.
As an adolescent, he had clung onto her words, wanting to believe with his whole heart that he could turn his pain into growth and still enjoy his life.
Potter was sitting cross-legged in the middle of the floor, pieces of what looked like a puzzle scattered all around him, but hastily scrambled to his feet as soon as he noticed the new visitor, grabbing a t-shirt from the nearby chair and pulling it over his head. Draco spotted a glint of the owl amulet before it disappeared under blue cotton.
Draco swallowed again, vaguely aware of the blood warming his fingertips, where his nails had dug into the tender flesh of his palms.
Theo didn’t disappoint. “You are getting mixed up in things way bigger than you.” He glanced around the room to make sure the other boys were paying them no attention and casted a muffilato, before digging his index finger painfully into Draco’s ribs “Somehow, I think you don’t fully understand what you have gotten yourself into.”
His eyes were caught by the presence of a second broom next to the Headmaster, and his heart gave a panicked thud. “Who else is here?” He asked. Dumbledore twisted his question and he felt himself answering, trying to put an inflection of proudness into his voice at the scheme he concocted.
“So. . .” He started, trying to defuse the anxiety “as many of you know, I am Draco Malfoy, and I could be considered the anti-hero in comparison to our friend Potter over here”. He saw Blaise rolling his eyes at his dramatic introduction. But Draco could do this, he could talk in front of people. The other students were regarding him as I he was crazy and for a moment he felt what it must be like to be Luna. Harry, on the other side, was looking at him with an interested twinkle in his eyes. Yes, Draco could do this. “I want to share my experience, because as Harry said, we have a lot to learn from our mistakes. And I made plenty. My first mistake was to think I was better. Life proved me wrong many times, and it felt like a slap on the face every single one. . .Don’t raise your future children telling them they are perfect, that they are better. Make them feel special, say that you love them. Admit their strong suit but don’t make them feel like they need to hold it against others”.
His feet dragged him aimlessly through the waking city, one step after the other without a proper direction, but nonetheless the right one. His thoughts just the same, intertwining in a flutter of broken paths, never focusing on anything in particular. For the first time in over a year his mind felt light, careless.
That’s how, on the 16th of August, Draco had found himself apparating to Hogsmeade. It had been a lovely, warm Sunday and he had spent most of it nervously walking back and forth on the patio, backtracking on his decision. His mother had sat patiently on a wicker chair, letting him release his steam and occasionally reading a passage from her book aloud. It was a story about love, youth and second chances. When she read “It’s never too late to have a happy childhood”, he had rolled his eyes and replied “I had a happy childhood!”, but decided that was his clue to go.
The experience was short-lived when he had to ask a couple of Muggles for directions to the bus station, which left him feeling both helpless and irritated. Trying to block any thought he wasn’t ready to deal with, he concentrated on the pleasant humming of his full stomach and the fact that, for the first time in a long while, he was at least physically well.
They carried the body in silence to the Great Hall, were Finnegan saw them and came to help. He gave Draco a brief glance but nobody said anything. Draco let him take over and hovered by the door. It took him a while to notice Luna, who had stayed behind as well and was now staring at the line of bodies covering the middle of the Hall. He noticed a group of red heads and realised that one or more of the Weasley’s didn’t make it. Granger stood nearby with the youngest of the siblings, arms around each other, and Draco knew it wasn’t her Weasley.
“I will, but that won’t make it less of a bad idea”. I won’t be welcome, Mum, and I don’t think I can take it. I can take being alone another year, not with people around me. He made to leave but she stopped him “There is more”. She was still holding the letter, and started to read the few lines at the bottom “The postscript. It says that all students of age, or with permission from a guardian, who wish to aid in the creation of a Memorial Garden for the fallen, are welcome to anticipate their return by two weeks. You will join Neville Longbottom, with the supervision of Professors Sprout and Flitwick, in helping with the completion of the project. We required any interest to partecipate to be included in the reply to this letter”. And with that, she folded the paper back in two.
“They are scheduled back early tomorrow, Neville!” She interrupted “Hermione had some. . . Business she needed to take care of, and Ron’s brother, George needed him. It’s quite a delicate moment for their family and they spent some time in Romania. . . So, Harry just went instead”
“Let’s do it together. Not all your family is gone, Theo”. Blaise’s voice sounded strong, and Theo wiped his tears.
It was a cold Saturday, and Draco blew on his hands to keep them warm. He was too nervous for magic. Apologising to Theo was one thing. Easy, they cared about each others. Theo didn’t need to be polite. Draco was hoping for anything but politeness.
After the third time Potter had to reach around him for something he needed, he was shooed out of the kitchen, pleased to notice that the brunet looked more amused than irritated by his incompetence. He wasn’t sure if he would have been so understanding, if the roles were reversed. He had actually proven not to be more than once in the past, when presented with the opportunity to mock Muggleborns and such.
His reverie was interrupted by the arrival of Snape, and “Severus, please...”. Then two words, spoken with rage and disgust, and green light and a soft, horrendous thump. Sound, light, sound. And then nothing, for a moment or for hours, days, weeks. Snape’s voice, telling him to follow, and it was all mechanic movements after that. Running, dodging, getting away, surviving. Somewhere, a cry of rage and shock, and maybe panic. Potter, he knew it. Don’t be afraid, Potter, Harry, the name coming in the moment of kinship, two boys so young and so terrified. He knew that, as well.  Don’t be scared, Harry, because Dumbledore is dead and you are all we have left. I can’t afford to hate you anymore, because I am scared enough for both of us and I need you, i need hope, to save me from myself.
Then his wand had been taken, gone. He hadn’t blamed Potter because in that split second of adrenaline and danger there hadn’t been time for thinking about respect and code.
The bed was a small double, covered in a thin blue sheet, roughly made but for a pillow hanging skewedly at one end. Muggle photographs of Potter and his friends were scattered across the walls.
“But you would not have taken her classes,” said The Dark Lord. “For those of you who do not know, we are joined here tonight by Charity Burbage who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”
The other man’s attention had once more drifted towards the screen. “Nah, don’t care.” The dismissal was clear. “You can access your room from the outside. Make sure to lock it, we are not responsible if something goes missing. Room 78 is between 77 and 79.” He added, snorting at his own dumb joke.”
Time was passing in a blur of following orders and waiting, his survival instinct taking control of his body like a puppeteer. Then his aunt touched her Dark Mark and Draco froze in terror.
“No, you are not listening. It’s my point. He has you. He could be alone but he has you” He wanted to get the message across, but the other boy’s eyes were so wide and green he had to turn away. He shook his head and faced him again “You are just 18, yet you are there for a kid to whom you are not even related. I don’t know much about Professor Lupin, but he was an adult and from what I’ve seen in the pensieve he was friend with your father. . .This wasn’t your war, it was everybody’s. He had lost someone too. Isn’t it somehow offensive to his memory to think he didn’t have the rights to fight for it as much as you did?” He hoped he wasn’t pushing too far, but he kept going “Harry, you died for all of them. . . Us. Don’t you reckon is time to let other people take their risks? To accept their sacrifices, and let go?”
Please ensure to send your decision back by owl in no longer than a month time. Upon affirmative response you will be provided with a list of books and materials. Best regards, Minerva McGonagall”.
Draco had remarked that he was starting to sound more and more like Professor Snape, but in his heart he was grateful for Blaise.
Harry narrowed his eyes, and the yellow actually contrasted well with his dark hair. “Its truly remarkable, how you bully your way into comfort”. He observed, almost impressed.
But he wasn’t happy, and December came, bearing reality like an unwanted gift on its frosty shoulders. The leaves rotted on the soggy grounds, the Norther wind claiming the perfumes of spices and fruits to replace them with the pungent odour of decaying nature. The snow, that often by then would cover Scotland like a mantle, was late this year and everything looked brown, muddy and dead. Still, Draco walked to the forest. The cracking sound of frozen sticks breaking under his boots mingled with the shaking voices of third year Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws, begging the groundskeeper to take their lesson somewhere warm. His classes were over for the day, and, as of lately, he rarely spent much time on his homework or resolved to take them with him. He muttered a warming charm, breathing in the little puff of steam that rose from his winter cloak. He could still feel the cold, but the castle was no place for outcasts. He knew that his loneliness was partly self imposed, but he didn’t have it in him to play along anymore. After the “accident” with Longbottom in Carrow’s class neither him or Theo had been called to aid again in the Death Eater’s torture sessions, and Draco had speculated about Snape’s involvement. Although, probably, the Carrows just found students more willing to have their go at loathed classmates. Longbottom hadn’t learned his lesson, and still spoke up whenever he felt right to do so. His attitude always made Draco think of Potter. Potter, lost somewhere but that still left an imprint on the friends that stayed behind. Potter that, wherever he was, still had friends. There was no one with Draco, when he entered the forest. He had come to like the place, with its sounds and its quiet and its safety and its dangers. He had found refuge from his confusing feelings in the strange peace of a little clearing not far into the trees, company in the creatures that sometimes strolled by, giving him curious glances but never coming quite too close. Today, there was a small group of thestrals already there, two adults and a little foal, steady on his fragile looking legs but still fairly young. Draco knew that despite their disturbing appearance they were quite innocuous, but still couldn’t shake the jolt of disgust he had felt upon seeing them for the first time. It was hard to like something so connected to a tragic memory.
Draco startled at being addressed, the option of joining the other man never having crossed his mind. Did he want to look into the memories of Dumbledore, the man he basically all but killed just two days prior? Was he prepared to face that particular ghost, blue eyes still sharp with life at the back of his own memories? The vial was probably meant for Lupin, after all.
“Apparently he swears to Merlin every now and then. His Muggle boyfriend finds it hilarious.” Draco replied, wondering if the other wizard was going to be shocked at the news.
He had always believed that his last day would taste like longing and regret, but all he could feel on the tip of his tongue was a tender ache and burnt coffee. As if the elves knew it would be his last and messed it up, just this once.
“She said that of course men don’t marry other men, but all little boys have a celebrity hero, it was simple like that. . . That you were too young to understand what marriage meant, and you would, once you met the right woman”.
“I guess I’ve never actually considered it like that, but I have a lot in common with Arthur. My parents died when I was too young to actually remember any different, and I was given to my mother’s sister. She - they… They never actually wanted me, and I was raised pretty much as a nuisance. I think that, for some reason, they literally hated me. So I had to learn pretty young to do my part and keep my head down or… Anyway, they are probably the main reason why I came here, and at least I can cook.”
Draco, that was thinking of choices and what would have been if he had chosen differently, if he had been like Snape, interrupted the babbling.
Draco stopped his perusal of the shelves for anything edible and yelped “What? Absolutely not! I think you need to think again when you are clearly not high on wolfsbane”.
A twirly, lavender font that stated “Le Parfait Paris” took over most of the car’s side, and Draco noticed that there weren’t any back doors, like the taxi had. He resigned to slide in the passenger seat, fasting his seat belt as per Lupin’s instructions. He was aware that this particular Muggle’s job qualification didn’t encompass driving, and he couldn’t help feeling a slight unease, like mounting behind someone else’s broom. The boy looked to be in his late teens, maybe a couple of years older than himself, but Draco couldn’t recall for certain when people started learning how to drive. Both the bus and the taxi drivers had seemed much older, and he hoped this guy knew what he was doing.
He found Theo on the left one, twirling a red Chrysanthemum in between his fingers while he stared at a point far away. It was drizzling lightly and his hair was plastered to his forehead, his eyes squinted.
They had been blond toddlers, but Wendy’s shade had gotten progressively darker and, as an 11 years old, she sported long brown curls. Messy and wild, a little bit like her. Jack, for some reasons that were probably his mother, was still blond, albeit not as fair as Draco. His locks had a gentle wave to them. Lucius, to his son’s puzzlement, had said that Jack looked just like Draco. To Draco the boy was so much the spitting image of Luna that he didn’t want to think of the implications of his father’s statement. The truth was that Lucius had never been the same after the war and Draco was ok to let him have his harmless beliefs. His mother and Molly doted the children with the pure love of grandmothers. He hadn’t been that surprised of his parents acceptance, at the end the Malfoys had valued family above all.
The year started with a very muted version of the Sorting Ceremony, far from the exciting occasion it used to be under the guide of Dumbledore. Even in the last years, when the Hat had sung about the uncertainty of the future and the dark times ahead, the student body was buzzing with excitement, stomachs growling at the anticipation of the sumptuous feast to come and little 11 years old hearts thumping with the hope to be sorted into that particular House. But this time the atmosphere felt suffocating and heavy.
No one had given Draco the option of the ocean. No one had set him free in the way this man, a man without any blood obligation, had done for Potter.
It was a container of some sort, probably hard plastic; it was honestly baffling the obsession Muggles seemed to have with the cheap material. On the front, it depicted a drawing of a blond boy with a ridiculous hairstyle and a pointy chin that definitely didn’t remind him of himself, holding onto the hilt of a sword. Draco observed the cover for a little longer, before turning it to read the synopsis, as he would have done with a book.
Having a free period after Defence, Theo and Draco sent Blaise on his way to Arithmancy and decided to take advantage of the good weather. With the sun kissing their cheeks, they discarded their robes and walked towards the lake. “Perfect” Theo sighed in contentment, plopping his satchel unceremoniously against the trunk of a three. Around them, quite a few other students were enjoying the late September day. The scent reaching them from the Gardens was delicious, and Draco let his body melt to the ground.
“Are you two a couple?” He blurted out, hoping that his shock didn’t pass for disgust because, well, that would have been a bit hypocritical. He had never exactly hidden his own sexuality, but at the same time it was something he didn’t flaunt around, keeping his and Theo’s escapades exclusively between the boundaries of the Slytherin dungeons. He had definitely never considered that the Gryffindor could share his same inclinations.
“No, of course. There is a small toilet just to the right of the staircase. I. . . Uhm, I need to warn you there are anti-apparition wards in the house, so you know. . .”. His eyes drifted awkwardly to a spot just a few inches away from Draco’s left hand.
In that moment, Weasley’s baritone voice resonated from somewhere in the proximity “Harry! Merlin be damned, I am not going to look for you all night”.
In that moment, one glimpse at Harry, looking lost and still too addled to even notice the Patronus, was all it took.
“Eves, this is Dean. Dean, Evie. Or, Eveline- ouch!” Scott interjected, rubbing at his calf where Potter had landed a kick. “He is here for Allie’s room.”
“You know, I keep thinking am I allowed? That I will go there. . . and people will think who could he have lost? All I could hear the other day was I don’t want to be with the Slytherins. . . That we are never going to be more than what someone from our House has defined us to be. Someone like my brother. And still, I miss him, and wasn’t he a victim of the war, in same way? The Patils lost their best friend because of someone like Stephen, but he was my brother and I don’t know if I have the rights to remember him. . . If my reasons for grieving are as valid as theirs. As the ones of people like Potter that lost so much. . . After all, Stephen brought this upon himself. . . But I know my pain is. . . And I’m not sure, I guess I’m just trying to fit in and make them see that I am like them. . .that I never wanted this. And that maybe I can be suffering too?” Theo paused, to blow his nose. His face was all blotchy and he looked like a lost child. “Is it stupid, that I want to do that? That I still love my brother and want to commemorate him in the same way of the ones killed by people like him?. . . Maybe it’s just stupid that I still love him, because he was like them.” Like me, Draco thought. “I was angry with him. . . Blaise knows, all I could talk about was how angry I was. But now I am just sad, and my family is gone too”.
When Professor Burbage had fallen lifelessly in front of him he had been horrified, marking his passage into adulthood, where things weren’t always nice and cottoned. But with Vincent’s death, by his own heedless hand in the pursuit of a glory Draco once thought he wanted too, he never felt younger. Unprepared. Once again he realised that this was real, that he was alive but people were dying and will die.
With a laugh, Harry kicked his legs and sped away in the air. Draco stared for a while at the way he graciously looped and turned like he was born to fly. Yes, he was afraid. But it was a new, exciting kind of fear.
He was still staring when someone was abruptly there, cradling Potter’s corpse in their lap. Draco felt the compulsion to shout “Get off him, get off”.
Draco wanted to reach out, to touch Theo too. But physical contact between the two of them had only ever been adolescent fumbling in dark corners, while Draco had set rules and kept his mind half alert, afraid to be caught. And while Blaise stroke his hair naturally, as a friend comforting another, Draco didn’t know where his boundaries with Theo laid. Where a touch would be uncomfortable rather than soothing. So he just talked instead.
“Yeah. . . ” Lupin lingered, as if trying to express something else with the silence. When it stretched almost too long, he pressed the bundle of clothes into Draco’s arms and looked away. “Goodnight then, we’ll talk tomorrow”.
When his bag disappeared inside the small, beeping tunnel, his hands spasmed with the need to reach out and snatch it back. He tried to regain composure, glancing around to see if any of the burly men in uniforms around him had noticed his “escaped from Azkaban” act. The guy sitting at the desk simply looked bored, eyes fixed on the square metal box in front of him wistfully. The other two guards were engrossed in a nonsensical conversation about someone’s neighbour Bill and what sounded like a goat. Even when Draco hurried suspiciously fast under the security arch, rubbing his sweaty palms against his jeans and aware he must have appeared for all intents and purposes like someone with a secret, they barely spared him any attention. And yet, he couldn’t shake off the feeling that all eyes were pointed on him.
“Nonsense. I am sure the travel agency will help and you’ll be all set to go within a week.” He smiled, forcing the weight of the lies to drop back into his stomach.
“Boy never sleeps, I swear. Isn’t the new guy for Allie’s room coming today? How is it handling it?”
“Stephen told me she was funny. I used to be jealous, but now I know it wasn’t his fault I didn’t remember. . . I think that’s actually why I’m rarely sad about her, so at the end I’m the lucky one. The one without memories to be sad about.”
Weasley was shaking his head, laughing “Well, as long as you have stopped going after my family. That’s all I am saying”.
Dumbledore's voice wavered “You cannot possibly mean. . . No, it’s impossible, I would have known. You are a child, Draco.” The last sentence sounded like “monster” to Draco’s ears.
Potter grabbed two mugs, filling one up from the tap. “Sorry, we never actually got around to buying glasses. Are you sure you are okay with just water?”
As soon as the cab left him at his destination, though, his good mood plummeted. In front of him was a shabby two storey building that didn’t even seem to warrant a name but for a broken red light languidly flashing “MTEL”.
“Mmhm?” Draco hummed distractedly, pulling at  the cotton of his shirt from where it had moulded against his stomach as the heath of the morning enveloped him, damp and heavy. He really should have worn something lighter, he thought belatedly, tugging at the collar that felt more like a noose around his neck. His wand buzzed against the pulse point of his wrist, and he was seconds away from considering risking a cooling charm in front of a Muggle when a hand wrapped gently around his other arm, halting him in his steps.
On a last note, I confess I have been writing all of this fiction only to finally get to the point of writing this: A couple of hours later Draco was slouched on the sofa, Ron happily sleeping on his stomach.
“I suppose” Draco repeated, unthinkingly, but blinked furiously at the other boy questioning smile and scrubbed his eyes, willing his brain to start functioning.
Draco wanted to ask, wanted to swear and cry and scream. Wanted to say Harry was dead and Harry was never alive and they were all crazy.
It was impressive how most Muggle were able to unconsciously dodge crashing into one another or getting their feet flattened by a stray wheel, all the while looking every-fucking-where but in front of them. Draco had yet to master that particular skill, his toes still aching as a result of a couple of close encounters with heavy luggages and their apologetical owners. It had taken all his self control not to Avada the wankers.
“Not many would have done what he did. He was a brave wizard” he said, to validate the boy’s actions. The young wizard’s last act. And he was killed spinelessly by a coward, likely a pureblood that felt superior but couldn’t even look a child in the eyes when striking, he wanted to add. He was angry.
Draco gestured at the open cut on the sleeve of Longbottom’s robe, where the curse had reached the skin. The fabric was soaked in blood.
Draco was surprised and oddly pleased, so he resorted to sarcasm “I didn’t know you were capable of praising me, Weasley”
Draco was so lost in thoughts that he barely noticed his former Professor’s lips twitching into a small smile, but had to look up at the humor in his voice, almost fond “Sirius was the same”.
And then he dies, Draco avoided clarifying, confident that badly written romances didn’t end like that. And wasn’t real life just splendid!
“What can I say, I am a keeper.” He didn’t really mean to say that, so he added quickly “Come on, those horses are not feeding themselves”
The contrast between Snape, who was dressed in unfitting and dirty clothes, and the pristine girls he was spying on was great but, despite his state, he was bold when he addressed the youngest of the two.
He let go of his responsibilities and burdens. Of his worries and the soul crushing task of being the messenger of Death. For a brief, too brief moment, in a Muggle bus, Draco let go of magic, imagining he was just an ordinary boy going to discover the world.
Weasley’s eyes widened in horror and Granger squeezed his hand, tears trailing down her cheeks “Oh, Harry . . .”
The other boy was shaking his head, sobbing. His light brown curls flopped in his eyes, eerily messy like Potter’s, and for a mad minute Draco thought they looked like brothers. But Theo’s eyes weren’t bright, sharp. Deep, soul sucking. They didn’t kill, the same colour of forbidden spells and green, lively forests.
He rolled him gently to the side and although the boy wasn’t wearing any House colours, his face was familiar. He was one of the Gryffindors in Potter’s fan club, his mousy hair sticking on his pale forehead covering partially the eyes Draco was used to see behind camera lenses. He couldn’t remember the name but he was sure the student was one or two years below his own, despite being small enough to pass for a fourth year. He must have sneaked away from the crowd of evacuating pupils in the same way he and the other Slytherin did, just to die alone in a corridor.
Draco waited until the last day. Part of him knew it was idiotic, maybe he was waisting his time. Time that he could have otherwise occupy in more pleasurable ways. But rejection was a possibility and he had convinced himself that waiting until he didn’t have to see Harry every day would only minimise damage. They had all been busy with the NEWTS anyway. Now, though, he was running out of excuses. Draco had always thought love to be easy, and had used to be cocky about his chances. But he really wanted this to work, and what if Harry didn’t? They were friends now, and Draco thought that the other boy laughed as hard as he did at his jokes. There was something about their personalities that fitted like puzzle pieces. The way Harry would call him out on his bullshit, without second thoughts, but lacking the malice of their childhood years. Draco liked that, Harry’s attitude towards his own beliefs, the fire in his voice, the fight for what was fair. And he liked to think that his own confidence and unwillingness to mollycoddle the other boy did good for Harry’s insecurities. He just hoped Harry saw it too.
Draco tried to think only of Theo while he forced the Gryffindor to bend and kiss his shoes. Better me than Theo. His wand trained on Longbottom, he didn’t look at the other boy, letting the prickling feeling of Dark Magic flow from his hand. He had used the curse before, but the uncomfortable sensation under his skin never faded. Better me than Theo. “Get up, Longbottom. I’m done”.
“Close.” Dumbledore admitted sadly, “But that poor girl, Katie, is doing much better. It was a dangerous game, Draco, but it’s not too late.”
“I’ll have you know that I could be lots of fun if I wanted” he replied, trowing a squashed raspberry at Draco’s head and missing by a foot.
“Honest to Merlin, that actually sounds very interesting. You surprise me everyday, Potter” Draco commented affectionately.
I’m sorry this is taking forever but I had zero to no time and this chapter just didn’t want to write itself. How rude.
But Draco was the enemy, a pathetic one at that, in the grand scheme, but one nonetheless. An unwilling one, he wanted to shout. A stupid one, please see that, read my mind, look at my heart. Red. Guilty, wrong. But not black.
Potter’s “telly” was about ten time the size of the ones on the airplane, bulky and rather ugly. The boy himself was crouched down in front of it, pulling several rectangular boxes that, at first glance, Draco had thought to be books, out from the wooden cabinet that doubled as a stand. His blue t-shirt rode up, revealing two dimples at the base of his back and a small birthmark the colour of a coffee stain.
He changed out of his sweaty clothes and took a short and uncomfortable shower, trying to keep his naked skin away from touching the tiles. It was a rather difficult task, seeing how the entire fucking cubicle was only about 3 feet wide.
He raised his head slowly, letting the cranes crash around him for effect, and quirked an eyebrow. “Yes?”
But it had all happened so quickly. One minute Longbottom was fighting for his life, the next Hell had broken loose. The silencing charm Voldemort had casted upon the crowd had been lifted and people had started yelling  while the Earth trembled under the weight of the giants. The Gryffindor had taken advantage of the chaos to free himself, pulling an impressive sword out of the Sorting Hat. Draco had watched in fascination as, with a swift motion, the head of Lord Voldemort’s horrible pet had been cut clean, rolling onto the ground.
The unruly hair, ink against pale skin, just a hint of dotted freckles across the bridge of his broken nose. The slight asymmetry of his upper lip, fuller on the right. He was taller now, while still somewhat too skinny, his body had stretched over half a foot during summer, catching up with the distinguished height of the Potter’s lineage. He was almost a man, yet still a child. So goddamn young. Each trait a stabbing reminder of whom had once been just as young, just as lively.
Dumbledore sounded mildly impressed and Draco felt his confidence raising. “Right under your nose and you never realised!” He taunted.
His initial plan had been to reach the sea and he stood, conflicted, looking at a tall sign stating he was just half a mile away from his destination. But the sea could wait, a little voice said from inside his head. It sounded very reasonable, his throat was dry and it was getting extremely hot. He looked around for a small shop or anywhere he could buy some water and it was then that he noticed it.
I’ll try to keep the notes short, so to spare you all my ramblings. As probably everybody else, I do enjoy to hear your opinions, so feel free to tell me whatever is on your mind 😊 thanks for reading
Also, I am technologically impaired, so unfortunately every time I write something in italic this website reformats it to just plain text, and I had to use “” instead. I hope it’s ok anyway.
The man gasped from his place somewhere mid-table and hurriedly left, apologising. Draco was disgusted to see a grown man reduced to a whimpering puppet, but were they not all like that, the followers of the Dark Lord? Made to serve, expendable. None of the glory and power his father had talked about, just men driven by their instinct of survival and a sick compulsion to please their leader. Oh how his father had been wrong, and now that he wasn’t in the graces of the Dark Lord any longer, Draco knew he was starting to see that.
Therefore, when he stumbled across an invisible barrier, right in the middle of the worn out floor of Compartment I, it was just too much.
He suddenly remembered the owl necklace, a faint glint disappearing under Potter’s hastily worn t-shirt. His eyes widened and he wished he could witness Lupin’s discomfort when he asked what stuff his former Professor had unintentionally witnessed his precious boy doing.
Imagining it was his mother’s arms around him instead, Draco felt impossibly young. His fingers toyed with the zippers of the bag until they clutched the journal, caressing blindly the rough paper. His magic could sense the incantation binding Narcissa’s name to the pages, and he allowed the sensation to pervade his mind. The buzz of the charm sounded similar to a lullaby, and it was grounding and familiar. He wrapped himself in it like a blanket and emptied his mind.
They had considered Weasley’s words and came up with a project that had left the group the most excited.
Ketchup, aside from sticking to his fingers and at the corner of his mouth, turned out to be most definitely the food of the Gods. Draco ordered a large serving of fries drenched in it, before thinking that maybe Muggles life wouldn’t be so bad after all.
“I do not, care to enlighten me? I am sure you don’t mind”. He feigned innocence, looking for an outlet for his own increasing ire.
He was right, the battle still hadn’t reached the seventh floor and, in between the sounds from the fights below, they could hear chatter coming closer, from the direction of the Room of Hidden Things. Their voices were so familiar. Potter was yelling at someone frantically, but what caught Draco’s attention was Granger scream of delight. He emerged from the alcove, making sure to stand close to the wall to maximise his coverage, and looked incredulously as Granger jumped on Weasley and kissed him full on the mouth. It was strange, people doing something as mundane as kissing when the war was blowing around them, but it felt oddly right. They still had hope, still had good things to hold onto. Maybe it was easier not to die if you really wanted to see what there was to live for.
“I don’t care how you do it, but these are my terms. Take or leave it”. He said, bolder than he was feeling.
He thought he had lost them, for a moment, when he had turned a corner and they had suddenly vanished. The light bouncing oddly off the steps and the shift in the air had given away their poorly performed Disillusionment charms, although the one he casted on himself with his mother’s wand wasn’t much better. He was aware that only the chaos happening around them had made it possible to go trough the castle unnoticed.
“Technically we are not open until 7.” She told him, glancing at the huge clock with no numbers as if it would confirm that it wasn’t 7 yet. Draco had no idea of the time, but his stomach rumbled quietly and she chuckled. “Nevermind, what can I getcha? I was just whipping the first batch of pancakes batter back there, or you can wait for Scott with the deliveries. Still warm from the oven, I’d bet.”
He and Harry had been staying at his grandparents’ old place in Cardiff, a quaint two bedroom that was the only remaining link to his Muggle heritage. For once, Wizards’ complete disinterest for all things Muggle had played in his favour and he was certain that no one, or at least no one alive, knew about his property.
This chapter took a while and I’m not really happy with it but I am not sure how to change it and i want the story to progress.
Hello, I’ve realised that Ive been using the chapter summaries for notes so I am trying to correct that from now on. Well, the battle of Hogwarts has begun. I reckon a couple more chapters before we go into completely unexplored territory but I think this chapter has only new stuff. The next two should have the room of requirements scene and Voldemort’s death. I really really want to write a scene that I have in mind that I think has never been done and I’m quite excited about but I think it would still be quite a few chapters. Harry into the next though.
The train was emptier than ever before, and Draco wasn’t in denial. He knew that lots of student were sensible enough not to return. Hogwarts was’t welcoming for Mudbloods any longer, and most likely some of the other parents didn’t want to take a chance with their children’s safety. The somewhat tamed group of people on the platform, still significant but far from the chaos of the previous years, was telling enough. He had heard a few of the other students struggling with their parents, insisting to go, that they didn’t care, that it was their school. He had seen the supplication in the resigned faces of the older people, watching their children grow out of their protective arms, the pride for seeing them stand up for themselves mixed with terror and worry. Parents worried, like his mother, wanting to shelter their loved ones in the safety of home. His mother, though, was relieved to see him go, as their house was no shelter anymore, nor safe. But People didn’t know that, they believed all was good for him, and Draco could still feel the prickling of distrusting, maybe even hateful, eyes on his back while he walked down the carriage to find a free compartment.
Draco almost lost his footing again. He wheeled around, eyes darting between the other boy and the cat. The cat looked back, his head tilted in judgment.
He suddenly stopped laughing to look at Draco with defiance, as if waiting for him to make a snarky comment.
The other boy must have read into his silence, because he hastily added “Not that we have to, if you rather not. We could discuss the living arrangements further, or if you want to have a walk, go to the beach. . . I don’t know. Or leave on your own and come back later this afternoon. Up to you, but I thought that, since you are jet lagged, we could just chill and watch something. It’s not my personal favourite, but it’s still quite good. . .”
No resistance. “How? With so little time and strength, why put all this effort in keeping the others out?” Draco found himself wondering while he felt his body slipping from reality, a cold shiver travelling from his hand right through his core.
On top of being a passable student, the bastard was obviously more than skilled at Quidditch. Half blind, and really, where were those damned spectacles, he had never failed to spot the snitch just that second before Draco regardless. And he had made sure to make that second count every fucking time. He was athletic, had been even as an 11 years old too skinny and short to pass for anyone older than 9. Fast and just competitive enough to be a problem that Draco’s father had never allowed him to forget about, as if he wasn’t obsessed over beating the other seeker enough on his own.
He remembered his own sorting, the smugness at being appointed to the house of Slytherin and to the honours he associated with it. He was were he wanted to be, with the people he saw as his equals above the others. No doubts in his 11 years old mind that he wouldn’t want anything to do with the children that just a minute before he had scanned in search of potential friendship, but that were now part of something different. Marked as different.
Potter shook the box a couple of times, but the ginger cat gave him an unimpressed stare before rubbing his head against Draco’s calf in invitation.
“Stephen knew what he was doing” Theo’s tone was glacial and Draco saw the confused expression of the Death Eater. Before Amycus could understand that Theo didn’t wanted to do it, before the consequences of said revelation, Draco heard his own voice saying “I’ll do it”. Thirty heads turned in his direction. He felt his heart race, the cold trail of sweat on his neck. Better me than Theo.
“You are nothing like your brother” the older Nott spat, looking at his only surviving child with mixed emotions.
“I missed it, as well. You’ve always been part of my life, and I can’t imagine it any other way”. He said, meaning every word.
Luna had crouched next to him and was softly caressing the boy’s hair away from his face. “Goodnight, Colin” She murmured. The Hufflepuff with her came closer, looking around nervously.
Since starting Hogwarts, summer had always been a bittersweet time for Draco. The Manor was huge, richly furnished and the grounds were stunning. Draco knew well that most of his peers envied him and during the school year he would often boast about his home with whoever would listen. The truth was, though, that after months in close quarters with people his age and with a freedom that only came from being away from the watchful eyes of his parents, he missed Hogwarts. The Manor was ancient and beautiful, not unlike his school, but there were no young voices populating the corridors, no one to share secrets and mischiefs with and, having no siblings or cousins, it felt empty and lonely. Even with his claims that Hogwarts was a second quality school, where the education level was somewhat lacking and where people less worthy were allowed to live and learn side by side with the more deserving ones, he considered the castle his second home, as it often happens when boarding.
His second thought was that the speccy git wasn’t speccy any more. His awful round glasses were nowhere in sight, leaving his very green eyes unframed but for black, long lashes. A dusting of faint freckles covered the top of his cheeks and the bridge of his nose, with a couple of stray ones darker against his lips. Suddenly Draco had to look away, aware of just how long he had been staring in silence. It wasn’t like he could explain his lingering gaze with the truth. He was just taking in the changes a year had made to someone that used to be so familiar, but to the boys in the room he was just a stranger raking his eyes over one of them with perplexing interest.
He looked at the tiny wizards and witches, in line for something more than simple grouping, and he knew that single instant sitting on the stool, so little and unprepared, would define them for the rest of their lives.
“Do you think that we could start again? From the beginning, that first time we met?” Draco hurriedly added.
A family, Harry had been deprived of one for so long and, as an adult, wanted the biggest one he could fit in his heart. Draco had felt guilty because Harry could have been with a woman, and wouldn’t that have been simpler? He knew Harry hadn’t cared about the way his children would come into his life, but Draco had wished him to have the easy way, for once. Then Luna had come along and said she would carry their child. Draco was relieved, but most of all grateful. Because, if he had learnt one thing during the war, it was that some people were kind, some people were selfless, and those were the people he wanted in his life. Harry had been ecstatic and wouldn’t stop grinning for a month. He had said it didn’t matter if the baby was biologically his, Draco could be the donor since having a proper heir was more important to him. Draco had said no, because it wasn’t, not anymore. He had stopped believing in the importance of blood a long time before. Or maybe he believed Harry’s was purer than his, just differently. He had know the child would have been his, even with Harry’s blood, or even more so. Then,  a sunny evening, Luna had arrived at their house in Hogsmeade bearing a tiny pair of ridiculous knitted socks with what looked like miniature radishes dangling from the strings: the baby was on the way.  The babies, as it had turned out. Luna had said twins run in her family. Draco knew it was most likely the fact that medically aided pregnancies had higher rates of multiples, but she had later birthed twins boys of her own, so maybe it was true. Their children had been born at the beginning of a really rainy march, and it had been splendid. They had been mostly bold but for a little tuft of light blond hair, to Harry bewilderment and Draco’s badly concealed triumph. He had asked Harry if he wanted to name them after his parents. Harry had said the past was in the past and as much as he could love people he never truly met, he wanted their children to have a fresh start and identity. He had somehow really gotten into muggle fairytales during Luna’s pregnancy, the two of them often found sitting shoulder to shoulder with mugs of hot chocolate and a book. Draco had blamed it on Hermione.
Draco knew he had to do something but all he could manage was a small tilt of his head in the Dark Lord’s direction, trying to avoid eye contact.
“I left something behind,” he shrugged dismissively, and began perusing the selection of food set before him.
The new Potter was clearly an enemy as much as the old one had been, because he merely laughed harder.
The other boy remained silent, listening. Draco continued “He was the only Professor I admired. Probably the only adult, beside my parents. It didn’t fit his character. . . Don’t get me wrong, he was a bastard. But I’ve always wondered. . . Last year, with the Carrows, I think sometimes I’ve even doubted . . . But I was never sure.”
The war was over. From his little corner where the world belonged only to him and his parents, Draco had heard the muffled sounds of the battle still going on. They were wandless, but it didn’t matter, they were together, one way or another. But it had been quick, and between whispered conversations with his mother, he had listened to fragmented pieces of the one happening between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort. Potter had been calm, levelled, powerful. He had talked about wands and about love. He had even talked about Draco. And the other man arrogance had killed him, at the end. Potter had stood there, untainted. Tired, exhausted, wand still raised while the crowd had slowly realised what had happened. Then reality fell on them like rain, refreshing, cleansing. They had won, the war was over. The remaining Death Eaters were apprehended and Draco felt inadequate, but nobody spared more than a few glanced for his family. The Great Hall was cleaned, the bodies moved and the injured sent to the infirmary. The tables were put back in place and food started to arrive. People were everywhere, laughing and reuniting with their loved ones. He and his parents sat closely together at the more secluded end of the Ravenclaws table. Draco wasn’t hungry but his mother pushed some bread into his hands. He was just starting to break it apart when a shadow fell onto the table. He raised his head slowly, afraid it was someone coming to tell them they weren’t welcome, but he met green eyes. Draco’s own widened in surprise and Potter held out his wand “This is yours, I don’t need it anymore. I am not sure it will work as well as it used to, but it’s your wand”.
A small part of Draco still wanted to say something crass, if only to see if there was any jealousy left in the other wizard, but his stomach twitched in discomfort. “In a ditch” he spat, finally.
“Well, at least those are good ones” and with the sound of Harry’s boyish laugh, Draco finally let himself smile.
Draco shook the feelings away and looked around. The slight desaturation of the colours was the only sign that something was amiss, the washed out tones serving as reminder that this was not reality.
I am starting to realise how long it actually takes to write down something that seems so simple in your mind.
He patted the front pocket of his jeans, tracing the firm contour of his passport a few times in assurance. Then, just to give his hands something to do, he fumbled with his backpack and searched for the bottle of felix felicis, letting go of a relieved breath when his fingers found glass. It was a stupid fear, thinking that someone could have taken it. To be extra safe Lupin had charmed it to look like a small tube of hand cream if any Muggle was to find it, but Draco couldn’t help the compulsion to check anyway. He flipped it over, to make sure once again that it was properly sealed.
He could have loved Theo, maybe. In another life, when he was a week past his 17 birthday and allowed to be just a boy that thought with his dick and his heart. They could have conquered the world, the three of them, with Blaise’s charm and Draco’s poise and Theo’s quiet and sharp wit. The Slytherin’s throne, in the worst case scenario.
“No, you can’t,” Draco replied, his wand hand shaking very badly. “Nobody can. He told me to do it or he’ll kill me. I’ve got no choice.”
“Where. . . Ahem. . . Where’s the bathroom?” His voice sounded raspy and feeble but it hit Lupin as if he had shouted.
Christmas wasn’t merry, and didn’t feel like Christmas at all. But his mother was there, looking thin and strong, and they hugged by the tree. When his house elf, Splinter, packed his trunk to go back to Hogwarts he said thank you without thinking.
Greg was stunned, his body falling ungraciously at Draco’s feet, who had just enough time to register it before Granger screamed. Like in the Manor. High, loud, terrified. Draco saw the flames before the two boys running away from them. They were huge, red. Hot. The room temperature grew quickly, suffocating. The fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts: Flaming serpents, chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and rose again, and the detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up in the air into their fanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet, before being consumed by the inferno. Fiendfyre. Draco cursed. Then he looked at Greg’s unconscious form, and he knew he had to run but not like this. Not with Greg burning because he wanted to live. So Draco dragged him along, desperation making him stronger. He was still so slow. Too slow. Vincent had vanished and so had the Gryffindors. That’s it, Draco thought while he pushed Greg on top of a pile of desks, an useless attempt when the flames where so close he could feel the ground burning the soles of his shoes. That’s the end. Not what he had imagined, not what he had hoped. But death never is, a hope. Draco held Greg tighter and breathed in air and smoke. He opened his eyes to a hand dangling in front of his face, Potter hoovering in the air on a broomstick, looking determined. The grip was weak and sweaty and Greg was heavy. Draco knew it was pointless even before his hand slipped away, but still wouldn’t let his friend go. Death, a terrible one, but he wasn’t going to leave Greg to save himself. Not this time, not when it was the last thing he would do after fucking up so many times before.
