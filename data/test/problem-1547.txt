he'd said to himself, as he went his second night on a grand total of around six and a half hours sleep.
be doing if her life depended on it. She barely tolerated his taste in conversation let alone in pureblood interior design, and besides he wasn't in a 'Narcissa Malfoy' mood right now. He wasn't in any sort of Malfoy mood at all actually.
As if on cue, Malfoy sauntered into the great hall, Theodore Nott trailing along beside him. That was a new development as well. Nott and Malfoy, being all chummy. Most of the Slytherin 7th years hadn't returned this year - but apparently Malfoy's attendance, and completion, was a mandatory part of his sentance. He'd narrowly escaped Azkaban because of his age, and Harry's testimony. That was probably what Draco meant when he was talking about
"Remind me; what is today's date? All of it I mean, year and all. Must check I don't have any disorientation from that incident." He drawled as if it didn't matter, as if he weren't absolutely drowning in fear. She looked worried, still afraid of retaliation he supposed, eager to atone.
Harry's insides burned again and he felt awful, and he didn't understand why and his breathing picked up again, and-
So he took a deep breath (it tasted musty and as old as he felt) and pushed open the heavy double doors to the gallery.
"I promise Malfoy, please just believe me? I haven't slept in days and I'm just exhausted. And I'm not a shitty person okay? I don't care that you're...you're." Oh no, why now? Why couldn't he just say it? Was he actually a bit of a shitty person after all?
on the tip of Malfoy's tongue but he thought better than to point that out. Besides, he actually was curious. Why would
Malfoy had cornered Harry after lunch, told him he had something pressing to discuss with him, alone. Harry had briefly considered saying a flat out no just out of spite, but Malfoy had really been keeping his head down since they came back for eighth year. He'd been barely present at all really, and Harry had caught himself wondering, more than once, as Malfoy spilt a cup of coffee on himself at breakfast or politely excused himself if a Gryffindor entered the library, if that was by choice or by not so gentle coercion.
The point was though, he thinks Malfoy believes him now at least. He really had no clue that Theo was being bullied for being,...that way inclined.
Is this really what people thought of him? Some hot headed arbiter of justice or some nonsense like that? Or worse, someone who judged people based on ... things like that? Hadn't he just won a war over that sort of shit? What more did he have to prove?
The pompous tosspot shrieked about 4 octaves higher than Harry thought possible for human recognition, and he thought that a little fire now and then was perfectly fine actually, if you asked him.
He was too tired to figure out Draco bloody Malfoy right now.  Harry doubted he would ever have enough energy for that.
"You think I'd be a dick about it?! Hermione!" He was genuinely hurt that someone he cared this much for would expect that little of him.
want to get obliviated anyway? He really hoped it wasn't gruesome. He'd had enough of gruesome, but now he knew that there was something
Malfoy flinched a little. Which made Harry even angrier. Because look at Harry . Being a dick to him. Like he was warned against. But not for that! He assured himself. Maybe he was supposed to assure Malfoy...?
He risked a glance at where he knew Ginny was sitting with Dean & Seamus, hand resting on Dean's forearm, an easy smile on her mouth. When had that started? Harry can't remember the last time smiling felt easy.
"So, yes. And don't argue, I'm looking for absolutely nothing from this, I expect nothing at all will change for me. I'm well aware that for you it won't repay all that much, but I think you can appreciate Potter how absolutely damning and horrifying this admittance is for my already shattered reputation."
that told Marcus? And what - egged him on? This was really shaping up to be at the top ten in Harry's worst weeks at Hogwarts, and everyone knew he'd had some cracking competition there. He was so shocked he just sort of sat there, gaping at him. Returning his shock with incredulity and not a little pissed-offery on the side.
Until he caught those piercing grey eyes like a storm looking directly at him, momentary shock hung about his face. As though somehow Harry was to blame for...
She only called him Harry Potter when she was trying to 'course correct' as she'd been calling it lately. A lot. Hermione had really gotten into correcting people's courses this year. A little evening lecture here, a little
He always sounded bored when he asked that, always like he didn't care what the answer was. As though they'd been playing a childish game of emotional chicken, waiting for the other to cave.
Draco let out a derisive snort, but was trailing his fingers along the dusty floorboard by his knee, not meeting Harry's eyes.
Then there was only white light and a deafening scream: some other mother this time. It was somehow so painful that he couldn't really feel anything at all. Think anything at all.
"So I thought what am I good at? Keeping secrets I suppose. What could I possibly give you that I care about, my pride?" He contined on, making absolutely no sense to Harry, but what was new? He seemed very strung out though, jittery and dark under the eyes. Harry realised then that he hadn't seen him this close up since they came back.
He vaguely wondered if they all actually knew about each other's silent conversations, and just gave one another the illusion of privacy.
He went towards the direction of the horrid old Gallery full of horrid old Malfoys, following the tell-tale trail of destruction. He was so damn tired. What time even was it? He didn't suppose that it mattered. He was supposed to have clocked out at 2am. Was it 2am? Or much later? He would just like to know whether he was late or early once in a while, feel a little less like there was something he was missing.
"It's quite all right, I assure you, I've had worse." He tried for a kind smile, but he was worried and confused and not sure what in Salazar's balls was going on here.
to shove him. To be pety and pretend not to notice that Malfoy was a bit shaken up. Like he was preparing for an onslaught of slurs around any corner. This corner in fact, as he tried to be subtle about checking for passers by.
As he fell, he reached into his trouser pocket, and absently traced three silver letters before he finally gave in to sleep.
"Potter? I don't know Malfoy, I suppose he's in Herbology...with the rest of the Gryffindors. Are you quite well in the head?" The boy spoke as if talking to a troll, and Draco instantly wanted to dunk his head in the cauldron beside them.
He handed it to Harry, which was rather nice probably, wasn't it? Manners or something? He wasn't used to a Malfoy with manners. He should probably take it right?
"Potter." Malfoy gave a tense upwards nod of acknowledgment, and gracefully manoevered around the ragged mess that was posing as Harry today.
She looked ashamed, and was doing the quiet sad thing again. Harry considered briefly that he was being a bit over the top, blowing it out of proportion, but he didn't care right now. Didn't want to anyway.
"Am I? Really Potter? You have the gall? I know I said do what you will, but there's no need to rub it in! especially with collateral. You had no right to bring Theo into this, he didn't even fight on our side." He was so venomous. Harry knew it was coming from a place of pain, of protectiveness this time so he couldn't even bring himself to bite back. How could he? This was so fucking unfair, and he'd already been made to feel like an ignorant child today and he was really really-
Harry had not stayed long after that, he needed to just, exclude himself from any meaningful social interaction for a while. Until he could, er, stop weeping and snapping at people?
Wait, weren't tokens the thing that ladies gave to the knights or something? He must be remembering that wrong. Ugh. Either way he needed sleep.
He loved that they loved each other. He'd gotten over the whole 'third wheel feelings' from the beggining of term pretty quickly. For many reasons really, but most privately because he'd never been loved by two people so unconditionally who cared so wholly and obviously for one another. At least, not that he could remember. It was something Harry wasn't entirely comfortable with feeling, if truth be told he felt a little ashamed. These were his friends, his
"Where is he?" Harry barked at a worried looking little house elf who he vaguely recognised. Maybe her name was Gertie? Greta?
"Mione?" He barely mumbled, suddenly struck with an emotion deep in the back of his throat, that he was quite sure no amount of scourgify would loosen.
And suddenly Harry found he didn't give much of a shit for melancholy introspection as he cast a swift Incendio at
"Alright mate?" Ron rested his hands on his now pajama-ed  knees as if ready to spring into action whenever.
"I'm always here." He said, ignoring the Malicious Muttering Malfoy Mural he had well and truly turned his back on. He had wished, and not always kindly, that it was that easy for Draco.
"Lay off him a bit 'Mione." Ron said biting into his (fifth?) sausage, nodding at Harry with a concerned look. He was very grateful to have him in his corner, even if he had gotten the wrong end of the stick. Actually, come to think of it, probably
"Yes. Well. There you have it. Good day Potter." And with that he promptly turned away, leaving Harry to stare off after him, completely dumbstruck.
"I wasn't trying to humiliate you or whatever you expect of me Malfoy." Because he just didn't have the energy to stay angry very long anymore. Right now all he felt was sad, and a little bit lonely.
She still looked determined, and was talking in hushed tones with Nott - who Harry had now noticed was shaking. Malfoy was standing just off to the left, seemingly giving the two some space. Now glaring not-so-subtle daggers in Harry's direction.
not that you or your little friends would care about our lot." The blonde scoffed, but he did look distressed. Ruffled.
"I'm really sorry." And he meant it. About a lot of things really, not even to anyone in particular, and that realisation made him sadder than he'd ever remembered feeling all at once. Like maybe his body was just waiting for him to be able to carry it.
Draco let a tiny smirk pull at his mouth as he traced a lightning bolt in dust with his fingertips. He was such an insufferable shit, and everything was a dig that could also be an act of fondness. Of affection. Draco Malfoy was a one way street that constantly changed signage whilst you were still passing through. He scolded you for crashing just because you didn't react fast enough, but Harry fucking loved being thrown off course.
"Of course, I'll see you at lunch?" He made sure to sound cheerful, to convey that he didn't want to fight anymore and hopefully that he was sorry too.
"What do you think I would say?" He tried again, hoping a more direct line of questioning would be easier.
"Oh for goodness sake-" Malfoy placed the palm of his hand over his eyes and forehead, seeming to wipe his frown into some sort of stoic hardness.
." Draco spat without much force. More like an irritated dribble. Harry shook that thought away from his sleep deprived mind before he accidentally
He'd stopped her after class had been dismissed (early, with Marcus sent to the hospital wing and five points from both Hufflepuff and Gryffindor).
Hermione looked completely unperturbed, still staring, disappointed and furious, back at Marcus - who was now hiccoughing, creating oddly shaped bubbles that drifted around his head. He looked green.
and-" Hermione's eyes were wet from recent tears,  he almost offered her his new hankie, but thought better of it.
"I'm a what Potter?" Malfoy had that look he always had when he was challenging him, when he thought he was going to win, that Harry would back down. It only struck him now that maybe...Malfoy never wanted him to back down at all.
Harry greeted the stupid over-the-top shoe rack with his shin, as he stormed through the hallway; half out of breath and run ragged. It still felt ridiculously out of place if you asked him, like something out of a garish pureblood version of IKEA. It would make a lot more sense, and far less bruising, to just get rid entirely if you ask him - which Narcissa Malfoy definitely would
Speaking of, contact wasn't always advisable. He faintly wondered when he'd started being careful, alongside being everything but. Probably the same time he'd realised he wanted to
But that joke didn't land right with him, and his eyes prickled, and his breathing evened out to a dull rattling in his chest, like a toy missing half it's parts. Wound up to keep moving until it walked straight off the edge, because, why not?
Harry was even more curious now. He wondered what could be so unsettling for the other boy to share - The entire Wizarding world knew Draco Malfoy's misdeeds by this point, what more could there even be? An odd little prickle under Harry's skin informed him that he didn't actually want there to be anything else about Malfoy. He didn't really understand why it felt wrong, but it did. He felt a little bad that it was causing him such distress but Harry supposed that was the point, like Malfoy had said. Which really was ridiculous, but before Harry could start to protest again, albeit feebly, Malfoy finally spoke up-
Malfoy was looking up at him intensely now, from a few steps below. It made Harry squirm, like a pool of hot treacle was rolling through his insides. Fucking Malfoy could ruin anything. No dessert was safe.
"Ah." He said "-And who am I?" He had an inkling of course, given the date. Yet he held onto some flimsy idea that he had at least carried through a fragment of his own reality into this glimpse of the past. He had remembered catching sight of his orange speckled reflection in the girl's cauldron, and he seemed to be himself. Until-
crush!" Harry exclaimed, completely fairly. It wasn't his crush. He ought to get one thing straight at least...so to speak.
"Don't worry about it, I'm just tired. Just going to bed. Night Hermione." And he headed up the stairs, feeling both attacked and guilty all at once.
What on earth was their problem all of a sudden? Did they think it unreasonable that he wouldn't reciprocate this attraction? That seemed ridiculous, especially considering he was pretty sure that they both wanted him and Ginny to work out long term, they'd hinted as much on numerous occasions.
Apologies for how short this chapter is but I've been stuck for a while and I wanted to get what I had out there! Hope you guys enjoy :)
"No! Stop guessing Luna! It's still not Luna! In fact, please stop guessing entirely." Harry flopped back on the sofa, arm flung over his face like some woeful maiden in an old painting.
"I always come back."  He tried for softly but it came off condescending, as soothing attempts are wont to when hindered by exhaustion.
The girl offered a reluctant hand, she seemed nice enough - but Draco couldn't tell if it was himself or the pus she was reluctant to engage with. He took it nonetheless, one cannot be too picky at offers of assistance when one is covered in a fluid that brings about an entirely
he luckily didn't say out loud this time. Thank Merlin for Pepper-Up. Unless one of the side effects happened to be sudden and very out of character bouts of weepiness.
"Malfoy have you been sleeping? Like at all? You sound mental. And I don't want anything from you, it's fine."
"I love you." He said delicately, like passing a rose made of glass and hoping that Draco didn't fancy smashing it today.
Harry rubbed his eyes, exhausted. Everything always hurt more when he was tired. The dark sad stuff felt weightier, less manageable. Especially if he was fighting with someone he loved.
me. I hate bullies!" The language sounded childish though, and he felt small enough to match it. Something clawing at the inside of his stomach. How could she think he'd pick on someone like that? After everything they'd been through together.
"That's why I've got you." He smiled. A dark little in-joke they'd started falling back on a while ago. The script remained the same, but the tone rarely did. It was all thin lines from here whilst Harry tried to bridge the gap with whatever was at hand.
Fainting. Can check that off his damsel in distress list. Brilliant, he had the whole set. And his head
Malfoy had looked stunned though, it was almost worth pretending it was intentional before running off with his tail between his legs.
She looked altogether uncomfortable, turning her bushy head towards the fire, letting out a soft hum.
"You want to do this here then Potter?" But it sounded...defensive? His facial expression sour and like an animal about to defend itself.
Harry shuddered, feeling the familiar unease of what he reffered to (tamely he thought) as the 'Haunted House' when he and Draco would partake in their annual Christmas Argument.
He started coughing messily, dribbling all over himself as soap suds filled up his mouth and poured onto the floor.
know there was no way this wouldn't keep him tossing and turning for the rest of term if he walked away now. And he could never really say no to knowing what Malfoy was up to could he?
Harry wondered, mortified, for a second that Hermione may have somehow guessed correctly who the person was without letting on in front of Ron. Why else would she warn him not to be cruel?
"Shall I take you to the hospital wing?" The girl piped up. He supposed getting out of this class would be helpful, there had clearly been some ridiculous mistake and he needed to find Harry. Make sure he was alright. He supposed he could just
Harry bridged the gap. His fingers slid into Draco's hand halting his dust doodles. Breaking his distraction. Risky, but that was hardly new.
"S'okay, actually I wanted to ask for your advice. Something on my mind." He aimed for a kind, but nervous smile. It seemed to work out how he'd intended it to because Hermione perked up immediately.
The Winter ball was all anyone seemed to be talking about the next day, and on 3 hours of sleep Harry was already sick of it by 10am.
And now Hermione was hugging him, so, so carefully, like he was worth handling with care. And he was
"It's just that some boys Harry, some boys aren't very nice about things like this." And her voice was so delicate and measured, as if she was talking to a child. A
shoulder now and it definitely felt wrong. Which it shouldn't, because they were friends, and this was ridiculous, and Harry thought that he's new 'fainting at the first sign of danger' ability would come in very handy right about now.
To his credit, the Slytherin wasn't blowing up at him. Or reacting much at all. He just looked, expectant. Like he had at his trial. Waiting for a verdict.
Draco turned twenty two in just a month and he was quite done with schoolboy hierarchy thank you very ...
"Queers." He'd gone and said it. Right to Malfoy's face (and Nott's). In front of Hermione, and basically the whole of Transfigurations class.
He needed to get a grip. Or some sleep. Whichever came first, he thought as he dashed out of the room, apparently not fast enough as he felt another, less friendly, grip on his arm.
Ron had put a comforting hand on her shoulder that she seemed to relax into, halting her flow. "Give him a chance to breathe yeah?" But he squeezed her hand and smiled so fondly at her.
Harry was mortified. He hadn't even noticed. It can't be that much, he wasn't that out of it was he?
He realised after a minute that they were just...staring at each other in silence. It was all of a sudden very unnerving. Especially when Harry remembered more reasons why that could be considered uncomfortable. He felt himself go red, and silently, desperately tried to non verbal himself into a toad. Crying, blushing,
of Malfoy's confession. He thought it was very impressive of him indeed, as he didn't have the best track record of ignoring any sort of implications about his school rival.
It was all over the school that Harry Potter; saviour of the wizarding world, vanquisher of dark lords, had almost died.
"Harry?" Hermione said softer now, look of gentle worry in her warm brown eyes, and his heart settled a little.
But Harry knew better by now. Knew how scared Draco was of Harry rejecting him again. How underneath that fear he really did want to make Harry pay for ever having made him feel unwanted. Even if he deserved it sometimes.
Hermione was rubbing his back, gently again. She'd never done that before, no-one had ever seen him like this before. He hadn't been like this since...As long as he could remember.
Harry felt like such a wimp, but it meant the world to him that they were always there when he fell. Always came back.
Nott really did look in a bad way. And he felt like he was imposing on a very private moment. So he nodded briskly.
"Yes well. It's your information to do with as you wish. Feel free to get promptly obliviated Potter by all means, I encourage it, but I
To when, all of a sudden, the most terrifying thing he'd ever dared to do had been to hold Draco Malfoy's hand. He closed his eyes for just a second and let the memory wash over him.
The blonde Ravenclaw girl vanished the pus. The brunette looked like he'd been made to eat it. Draco was used to this, he'd dealt with it all eighth year, and on a much larger scale. Until Harry...
Maybe it's time he stopped letting Hermione fight everyone else's battles alone. He wished he'd noticed properly. That in the background to her own war, Hermione fought for people less fortunate than even she had been made under Voldemort's reign. Because it was
Hermione snapped her fingers in front of his face "Harry you're not even listening to me are you? Harry?"
"Aren't you?" Harry held his breath and tried to pretend he wasn't. There were so many ways it could go with questions like that, and he wasn't sure how many of the bad ones he had the energy for anymore.
So Harry did something else. Because he was fucking tired, and honestly a bit sympathetic right now.
He was struck with a pang of jealousy for the wrong reasons and decided to very much not think about that right now. He wants things to be easy for her, of course he does.
Harry had never heard Malfoy say 'um' before. Not in almost seven years of knowing him. He'd never seen him blush before either, neither really suited him. His face seemed to agree with Harry because it was scrunched up into some very angry pinched sort of thing. Much more Malfoy. This made Harry relax a little more at least. He didn't really want to make him feel like shit after all. Anymore. Mostly.
“I really wished more students would complete an internship before starting their training at St. Mungo’s,” Draco said wistfully. “Some of them are just not cut out for Healing.”
Potter groaned, which he took as a good sign. Conscious and not overly hostile – he could work with that. Draco put a hand on Potter’s shoulder, testing the waters. He flinched slightly, but at least Draco got to keep his hand.
Strictly speaking, this was a case for the Potions Ward. But since this happened on such a regular basis and the cure was fairly easy, Trauma usually just handled these cases too. Easier than listening to the Potions people bitch about the transfers.
“You can’t go inside in your scrubs, that’s not very festive,” Blaise argued. “Just reminds people of their elderly family members who they haven’t visited in forever.”
One of the beans bounced off Draco’s forehead and landed in his mug, sending a thin jet of hot chocolate upwards and back into the mug via a perfectly linear path.
The match was brutal. The Falcons were their usual reckless selves. Dayal and the Harpies’ Healer had their work cut out for them as players were Bludgered left and right or just plain barging into each other to clear the way. Potter, obviously in high spirits due to McCarthy’s dismissal from the line-up, was in top form. He seemed to evade everyone and everything effortlessly, a perfect unity of flier and broom.
December was ‘Harry’ assembling a snow man. As far as Draco could tell, he was completely naked. One of the snow balls was hovering in front of his private area. He was also wearing a red hat and scarf, but Draco didn’t count those as clothes. July had ‘Harry’ posing on a broom in just his pants, which were also red, of course.
He wished there was a way to speed up the process, but messing about with potions was something only an
Potter chuckled, which had Draco thinking that he may have anticipated the question. “It’s a Muggle sport. Two teams with eleven players each, but just one ball and one goal per side.”
Finding Potter’s friends wasn’t hard at all. As soon as they entered, several people at a huge table in the back cheered. Potter waved at them eagerly and then took Draco by the arm and dragged him over there. As if Draco would flee if the opportunity presented itself. Which, admittedly, he was still thinking about.
“Yes, thank you,” Draco smiled back almost effortlessly. He was definitely getting there. This was progress. “I’m
“Didn’t you get the DVD for Christmas?” Olivia said in a judgemental tone. And then, thankfully, she stood up to stretch her legs in what was probably a yoga pose.
Draco was about to go insane from the way Harry’s warm hands worked their way up and down his arms, from the feel of his lean body pressing him into the mattress, from the taste of his tongue.
Well, going up there and presenting his findings, and seeing all these internationally renowned professionals actually
Had Draco had a choice, he wouldn’t have tried it anywhere near Harry’s heart either, but he didn’t say that.
“I don’t know if I want to support a bigoted establishment like that,” Harry joked, taking hold of Draco’s arm.
“Hey!” The sight of Potter’s shoulders jerking with laughter spurred Draco into sprinting the few steps to catch up. “Potter, you can’t do this to me. It’s driving me crazy! I can’t concentrate! Granger had to save me from public humiliation today!”
“Wanna play Kottabos?” said Harry suddenly, as if he had somehow read Draco’s thoughts and decided to distract him from them.
Several of the girls opened their mouths at once, when suddenly the wall slid open, revealing – absolutely no one. They all stared at it in silence for a few seconds.
“Do you think me capable of something like that?” Potter said in his ear. “Just taking something from you as important as your wand?”
Harry kept staring at him imploringly and Draco made the mistake of looking back. Harry didn’t show him much, but he also didn’t
Draco carried Potter up the stairs, all the while complaining under his breath. Potter might have been small and lean, but Draco was not exactly muscular and definitely not used to doing heavy lifting without using his wand.
They watched the match in companionable silence until Harry returned a few minutes later, bundled up in a coat, scarf and gloves. He had pulled a wool hat over his now-wet hair.
And secondly: he knew that wasn’t what Harry wanted to hear. And what Harry wanted to hear, Draco couldn’t tell him.
“Thank you,” Granger said gratefully. “They should be down in the cafeteria. And if Samantha Huxley's there too, would you please tell her to issue a short press release? Just enough to get the Prophet off our backs.”
Draco laughed. “Where do I even begin? How about all the glamours and the Polyjuice and the Cloak? Ready to quit them?”
It was all just too much – the attack and then the realisation that Harry wasn’t his boyfriend anymore, after thinking for a good two minutes that everything was fine between them.
Harry took one look at him and lowered his wand. His spatula dropped into the pan he was frying eggs in. The easy smile on his face died instantly.
This seemed to confuse the lady for a moment, because she hesitated before handing both of them a pair of tickets. “Oh, I thought
“You’d have known too if you’d have seen them,” Harry said, supressing another laugh. “And then there was that Prophet article, just the day after I stood her up.
Draco smiled mildly and tried to free himself from Harry’s grip with minimal force. “Okay, I will take care of it. But you have to let go of me so I can find a vessel.”
He assigned the letter to Pig, who gently nibbled at his little finger before taking the parchment (
“Not out loud, maybe. But in his head? Who knows how much these animals understand? Enough to follow instructions, that’s for sure.”
The hands were like lead on his shoulders, weighing him down. And Draco couldn't stop screaming, but if he didn't, He would surely punish him too. Draco mustn't show weakness. But how could he not, when weak was all he was?
He was almost there when he suddenly noticed the sound of footfalls behind him, mostly covered by the rain. But when he looked around, nobody was there. Draco gripped his wand tightly and turned around to face the deserted street.
When Draco woke up on the first Sunday morning in April, he felt pleasantly warm and comfortable. Sunlight was tickling his face through a gap in his curtains and warm arms were slung around him from behind. Draco breathed out contently and snuggled up closer until his entire back was pressed against Harry’s chest. He felt him move slightly, and then soft lips pressed lazy kisses against Draco’s neck and shoulder. Something stirred inside Draco, and he –
“Alright,” Potter said, putting the empty map down on the coffee table. “I need a quill. Did you bring one?”
“You will learn to produce a Patronus.” Harry said it as if that was the most logical thing in the world. He looked mighty pleased with himself.
H- … Potter (!) probably would have spontaneously combusted if he had cried in public. They were pretty much alike when it came to showing emotions in public.
Draco mulled it over for a few seconds. Then he said, carefully, “Would you like me to tell you about them? I know about all the ancient families, not just the Sacred Twenty-Eight.”
“Stewart Ackerley, in favour.” The boy cleared his throat and glanced over his shoulder to check that the bewitched blackboard behind his podium was ready to put his argument into writing. “My girlfriend is a Slytherin student. Since I am not allowed in the dungeons and she’s currently not allowed in here, we can only meet up in public places. It is frankly inhumane and absolutely unacceptable. As a resident of Ravenclaw Tower I should be allowed to bring my girlfriend here just as much as anyone who is dating a fellow Ravenclaw or a Hufflepuff or a Gryffindor.”
“Of course you do.” Draco thought for a moment and finally held out a hand, palm up, flapping it open and closed repeatedly. “I want your backpack.”
. He took enough sleeping potion to be out of it for another five hours. I’ll be long gone by then.”
of things. On the other, he was buried underneath one of those extra-large down pillows Draco’s mother always sent him at the start of a school year. It was a very good noise barrier, provided Harry hadn’t gnawed his way through it yet.
Potter pushed himself into motion and forced Draco to step aside in order to avoid getting kicked in the face.
a massive bitch. If it had been her call, Draco never would have been allowed to step so much as a toe into the hospital, much less start his training.
Harry flushed, he had forgotten that. The longer he spent with Draco the more difficult it was to remember his past, what he had done. “Oh, right.” Harry chewed the inside of his cheek. “Can you side along?”
Draco’s lip was bleeding and a small, poppy bruise was blooming on his cheek, dark under this light. It stood apart from the rest of his alabaster skin, glaring at Harry. Draco’s hands were tied to the chair and his hands were clenching and unclenching, continually pulling at the restraints. He was shaking his head in answer the questions being thrown at him and Harry someone knew him well enough now to understand he was more or less telling the truth; brows clenched together and lips downturned. He shook his hair out of his eyes and it seemed to wake Harry from his stupor.
Harry paused for a moment and his laughter dying out. “Yes. I think I can, Draco.” The name seemed to melt on his tongue and he tasted it. It was softer, sweeter somehow than saying ‘Malfoy.’ Harry found he preferred it.
They moved slowly in the beginning, gentle and soft. Harry crowded Draco against the bedroom door, the wall and eventually to the bed. His hands were anchored to Draco’s hips and his lips to his throat. It was too much and not enough all at once and Harry couldn’t remember a time when he had felt so many things simultaneously.
“And…and you want me to go there? And figure out what nutter is talking to the muggles about goblins.”
“Terms of my banishment remember. No longer allowed back in wizarding towns…can’t Apparate…use spells above that which a fourth year could do.”
Two men, large and burly were leant against one of the shelves grinning at the scene before them. The leader, Harry presumed from how the rest of them continued glancing at him, as if waiting for their next command and there, in the middle of it all, was Draco.
“What am I doing? What the fuck does it look like? I’m working, earning a living, pouring pints.” The last was said with a flap of his arms. “Well not really pints as such, more cocktails and things but I do have lager, lots of it. Oh, Christ!”
Red robes littered the streets of the small, quaint wizarding village. The press were being kept at bay, like a huddled group of vultures they strained their necks to take in the scene. They had clearly been tipped off, no way that word of mouth could have travelled this quickly, despite them circling overhead of every misdeed the ministry partook in.
Most of the regulars came and greeted him like a friend; updating him, albeit at a high volume due to the music, about their love lives and local town gossip. He listened carefully intoning ‘oohs’ and ‘ahs’ at the correct moments. This was one thing he didn’t expect to enjoy about the job when he took it on. He found he actually enjoyed talking to people and seeing their face light up when he asked about their mothers or their children and how their dog got on at the vet. At first, he did it as it was a wise business move. His father always taught to be amicable and gracious when it was needed. The second part of the advice, the part where you take the information people entrust you with and use it for your own benefit, Draco ignores nowadays. But the conversations remain.
She huffed and began to pull drawers open in search of the envelope. “Fine. Here! Make poor choices.” She thrust her hand into the fire and snapped the letter from his hand and stuffed it the envelope.
Draco spent the next two hours convincing drunk muggles they had had enough to drink and, surprise surprise, Scourgifying the toilet. He was going to positively murder Bernard the next time he saw him.
A fish and chips shop were the town’s pride and joy as it apparently had the best fish and chips for twenty miles. Harry couldn’t even imagine another village being close to here, it felt so cut off from everything and everywhere.
“Lovely for you to have the company, keep you entertained. Such a man as well! Ha! Right, I best be off. See you later, darling.” And then she was gone in a flurry of kaftans and weird perfume.
With that, he turned on his heel and stomped toward the door that led back inside. He could hear the cogs in Potter’s brain turning slowly from a clear lack of use and then blundering after him like the catastrophic asteroid that he was.
The breath that was held in his chest found its way out, cracking halfway. It was like opening a dam from inside him. He was aware of the mild shaking of his shoulders and the way his chest ached, as if it had been stamped on.
Grey eyes finally met his and they held more feeling than Harry would have guessed. “I’m not asking to be forgiven, by the way, I don’t think I should be.”
He started by levitating the chairs and tables to their places and transfiguring the glasses into their needed purposes. They always looked so dull when they eventually popped back to their pint shaped forms; Draco much preferred them with their long stems and shallow tops.
Resolve firm in his mind he shrugged on a hoodie and jogging bottoms. If his prissy younger self could see him now he’d die of shock.
A blackbird sang in the distance and from the street a child’s bicycle rang its shrill bell, an accompanying laugh in the background. Voices from the front door finally reached him and he heard someone call his name. His smile was heavy with those who couldn’t share the moment with him but it was a sadness that only lingered in the corners, watching from a distance.
He was warm, deliciously so. The mattress was soft and the covers smelled sweet, like lavender. Sunlight gentle on his face, he could feel the heat of it. His hand moved to feel the weight on his chest and he came across soft skin.
He had pondered everything from retribution, squibs unhappy with their lot to a resurgence of death eaters trying to manipulate muggles. For now, that didn’t matter. For now, he simply needed facts.
There was the familiar swooping feeling in his stomach, pooling and sucking at him through what felt like time and space until there wasn’t. Thudding into the ground beneath them.
A slow, unsteady breath left him; leaving the feeling of his lungs twisting in its wake. The watch on his wrist told him it was just after midday. He could do this. Close off his thoughts, smile, breathe, move on – only six more hours to go and then he could be free. Could sit in his kitchen by himself and take in his first real breath of the day. This he could manage.
“Right, I’m going to head.” Draco looked up to see Tempy picking up her jacket and walk towards him.
Draco stirred something in a travel sized cauldron. “No, not that I can think of. Seems like normal happiness to me. And anyway, why would someone go the bother of slipping something into people’s drinks that made them happy? What do they get out of that?”
A silver glow bounded through the door and into the office. It was a Patronus Harry recognised but couldn’t put a name to whom it belonged to right away. It looked like an eel, beady eyes staring intently at Ron as it delivered a message in what appeared to be Smith’s voice.
“Fine! My friend, fuck – this is ridiculous. I…you were the one that made me realise that I was, how did you put it, ‘not straight’.”
“No, I don’t think that’s it. Perhaps he can’t use a phone because…he’s a wizard and hasn’t ever had to?”
To him, it was humiliation of the highest kind. He wanted to help, to do something, to be…needed. And instead he was desked the majority of the time and only brought out to arrest suspects when the press were there and claim victory for once again triumphing over evil. He wished he were numb to it as the situation didn't seem as if it were going to change anytime soon. For now, however, it was something to be endured.
Harry had a hard set to his jaw. Kingsley nodded slowly. “Alright. But you’re not finishing this investigation on your own. Whether it is fair or not, you don’t have the experience and others do and they will be conducting the investigation in full. I will, however, allow you to remain on the case to assist since you know the town well by this point.”
“Tell him that a wizard is living here pretending to be a muggle, has definite skill with potions, has a history of disliking muggles and most likely is up to something nefarious…I wonder who they’ll want to investigate first?!” Draco marched ahead, leaving Harry to catch up.
“And his arse apparently,” Draco muttered under his breath. “He’s…a friend. Just visiting for a while.”
Draco seemed tireless, however. He continued serving with an easy going attitude and unwavering smile that Harry did not think was possible for him. Charm unwavering, he poured drink after drink, offered a smile, and explained the bizarre menu to newcomers. ‘No, it’s called a Lestrange Liquor. Think Pina Colada but with more rum and extra fun. You want two?”
“Do you know that this forest is directly connected to the Forbidden Forest? You understand all of the weird and not so wonderful things that live there and yet you’d rather stay?”
The winter sun was beating down on them and Harry insisted on ice-creams which Draco indulged. Walking past the rugby club, they stopped to watch them practice for a while.
“No, it’s nothing like that. I was going to send some of the younger recruits out, those that are muggle-born at least. It’s a muggle village, see. Weird stuff going on.”
When the tent was finally erected, he sat huddled around the small fire he had made and looked over the paperwork Kingsley had sent him.
“Yes, well it’s been a while you see. I don’t sell anything as half as good as this to those muggles. They’d hardly appreciate it.”
Harry felt his face heat. An anger that never seemed too far away came back suddenly and made itself at home in his chest.
Draco was pulling a t-shirt over his head. His hair was mussed and curled slightly from the humid temperature of the pub. Harry saw the slightest glimpse of a hip and almost poured the tea all over himself.
“Shut it, Potter! Honestly, you know that it’s always four limes in the Dirty Draco.” He smirked, finding it difficult to remain serious after saying the drink he had named after himself.
He thought of holding Draco between his hands the other night. His palms damp from tears and heart confused but delighted. “Expecto Patronum.” The stag erupted from the end of his wand and people screamed.
“No, stop. I just…” He ran his hands through his hair and it fell perfectly back into place, Harry decided not be annoyed at this. Draco’s voice fell almost to a whisper, “I want to help and I don’t want you to go but I am terrified of having to go back to Azkaban, even for a week.”
It had a mixture of different liquors in it that shouldn’t go together but Draco’s alcohol addled brain thought it was brilliant and he was going with his instinct.
Harry looked around wildly for him but when he spotted him he was holding down of them men and gesturing wildly away from himself.
“Sure. Grab those two glasses. No, the ridiculous ones with the big heads– there’s a theme here, you must understand.”
Draco laughed sarcastically. “Yes, it’s really such a shame for me. I really have turned things around now that I’ve stopped trying to murder people. Why can’t everyone be like me?”
After his Auror training he had agreed to do some work with the press to provide some assurance to everyone, ensuring them that they could trust in their ministry and their Aurors again. After all, he, Harry, was there so no-one needed to fear. It had worked too well, however, and he had found himself spending more time going to photo opportunities than doing any serious work in the field. Robards had refused to listen and maintained his mantra that being a successful Auror was to use your best skills and attributes. And Harry’s best attribute was his name and his reputation. After a while, it felt like he couldn’t say no, it was too late. He had missed his chance at helping people and was instead a celebrity wearing Auror robes.
“Yeah…yeah, fine. Excuse me.” Harry nodded and headed towards the door. Alarms screamed all around and a security guard stomped over red faced and nasty looking. He began barking questions at him and everyone in the small shop was staring, clearly enjoying the show.
The quills and parchment shuffled themselves over closer to Harry as he put the receiver to his ear. It was difficult to follow the conversation to begin with and jarring to hear not only Draco’s voice but Fotheringham’s silky tones coming through as well.
“You mean to check whether I’m slaughtering drunk muggles as a past time when I’m not deliberately breaking the Statute of Secrecy,” Draco asked.
Harry went along with the teasing, intrigued by this side of Draco he had never met before. One who could tease without taunt.
“And then…and then he might accept and even come to terms with and doing something about the fact that he’s not…straight.”
“Enough of your cheek, love or I’ll order two!” Bernard’s face split into a shit-eating grin and Draco knew the bastard was serious.
The minutes ticked by as he waited for Ron to come back and give him some kind of news. He had made for the door twice to burst in and demand what was going on but feared it would distract them from whatever was happening and put Draco in danger.
Robards rounded on him immediately and began explaining the situation as one would to a stone cold idiot. “Right. The two suspects are being arrested on numerous accounts, the main being suspicion of impersonating members of the Wizengamot, providing false testimony and illegal use of Polyjuice potion. You are to escort them outside the front door, read them their rights and take them towards the Ministry portkeys. At this point, these two here,” he gestured to the other Aurors in the room, “Will take the prisoners to the holding cells and you will pose for pictures with the press.”
“Really? You need to ask me that? I came to you – years ago – and told you that what they were having me do was ridiculous and you said it would be temporary, Kingsley and temporary it bloody well was not. I mean it’s pathetic. Surely you must see that. The embarrassment of it. Of being paraded and handed round for photos, not able to properly do the job I wanted, was good at and trained for. But, no, you told me to hang on, for you, to help you out and I think I have done that and I am not doing it any longer. Its humiliating. After –“ He felt his throat catch dangerously and he tried to reel himself in. “I think, given my history, I should have been treated like the Auror I wanted to be, could have been…but I was never given the chance. And I’m not saying this to make you feel sorry for me or anything like that I just – I want it to stop. Now.”
His thin lips parted in a delicate but delighted smile. Hips swaying to the music, corny as it was. The muggles behind the bar couldn’t see some of the intricate footwork he was managing but Harry could. Long legs spinning, twisting, and turning. His hands threw bottles in the air, behind his back and he made a spectacle of only catching it at the last moment. Seeker’s fingers outstretched for their victory. The shouts from the patrons, thud of the music and flashing lights of the room did nothing to detract from him.
As he turned to look away, he caught eyes with one of the women whose gaze was turned towards him. A small smile brightened her face as she looked between himself and Malfoy.
Of all the fuck-ups he had managed in his lifetime this had been the one that was the most ridiculous. He had made a drink that took the piss out of Harry Potter and had stupidly given said drink to Harry Fucking Potter. It seemed he was certainly atoning for his past sins, one painful, cringing moment at a time.
No, he would fix this. He would talk to Potter. Convince him that the drinks were just fun and perfectly harmless and then he could get back to his life the way it was before. He had worked too hard to throw this away. This little treasure of a place with its weird shops and weirder inhabitants. It was home when he had been banned from his previous. It was his. He belonged here. And if it took making nice with Potter in order to stay here then that is what he would do.
He struggled with what to say. He couldn’t make the situation better and certainly did not want to make it any worse. Instead he settled for saying anything that would remove the pensive and contrite demeanour that had overtaken Draco. “Just as well you’ve got those long legs of yours then, eh? Or, you know, you could fly. You were fairly decent at that if memory serves.” He grinned up at him from his position on the floor.
“Draco you didn’t do anything.” Harry could see his sharp features even in the fragments of light left in the room.
“Right,” Patil said, “We’re going to Apparate him there, I can’t stabilise him more than this and waiting will only put him in more danger -  Harry hold my arm.”
They had been careful with each other this morning. Not distant but polite and wary as if waiting to hear blame or admonishment from the other. It pained Harry. He wanted it to be simple. To come out and say,
She busied herself behind the counter and Harry had a closer glance at some of the products on the shelves but nothing else particularly jumped out at him as being suspicious.
The nip at his ear was less comforting and seemed to send an alert to this brain to wake the hell up. He grumbled and cracked an eye open. A round, amber eye was peering back at him. An owl was sitting on his chest and staring down at him with a look that can only be described as disappointment.
“Wait, wait, wait – will you ask me lots of questions and wait for me to come up with the wrong answer –“
He finished sorting the tea and they drank in silence, leaning against the counters. He wondered if Potter found it strange that Draco knew how he drank his tea. Potter didn’t say anything but Draco wondered all the same.
Harry, again busying himself with the tea, faffed with the cups and added sugar to Malfoy’s and milk to his.
After he had been walking for a couple of miles he had grown frustrated and tired from tripping over god only knows what. He sighed gruffly hands on hips and surveyed the area.
Standing under the hot shower he replayed the conversation they had. He really should be more careful. The last thing he wanted was to be in front of a committee for being weird with muggles, his record was bad enough that they would ship him off to Azkaban right away.
He stepped in further, cautious and trying to be quiet. Draco’s hair was the first thing he saw and then his face. The cuts and the bruise had healed and he was awake somehow.
“So…Harry – what the hell are you playing at?” Kingsley was always straightforward. Harry had not expected him to be this straightforward, however.
Harry’s mind was reeling as he staggered out of the shop, shock coursing through him. Regular muggles in this tiny town talking about things they should have no idea about and in an entirely blasé manner. As if it was normal.
He was halfway up Main Street now and decided to drop into the shop for something to eat. Exhaustion creaked in his joints from walking about all day and sleeping in the bloody tent with the terrible mattress, if you could even call it sleep. He seemed to toss and turn for hours and then when he did drift off it was to dreams of horcruxes and snakes and black, swirling robes.
Shame prickled down his spine at the mention of it. “I’m afraid I am not permitted to miss Hogwarts. Not anymore.”
He leaned over, hands on his knees and tried to focus on his breathing, in and out through his nose the way the therapist that came in sometimes had told him. He supplied her with drinks in an array of colours and glasses and she gave him tips on how to remain stable.
Potter was clad in peculiar pyjamas. A disgustingly orange Chudley Cannons shirt and bottoms that were  tartan and downright hideous.
Two hours later found Harry with the tent packed and shrunken in his pocket and receiving a bizarre tour of the village. Malfoy was talking animatedly. Gesturing wildly at the various shops and crazy things he had experienced while living here. People stopped him on the street. Greeted him like an old friend.
As Draco was determinedly cleaning a glass and ignoring Bernard’s pleas for ‘no more fucking Dolly Parton’ on the jukebox ,someone approached him at the bar. Draco looked up and dropped the glass onto the bar in front of him.
Draco started babbling incoherently, arms wrapped around himself. “…couldn’t get him out. The fire…can’t go near the fire…he was there…that fucking snake…terrible things…I did terrible things…”
Draco found mixing cocktails akin to potions; precise, occasionally experimental and if done incorrectly can cause the drinker to become violently ill. Judging by the sheer amount of alcohol in some of them it often seemed as if this was the primary purpose. The skills from potions was merely practically but the names he created became a creative outlet almost. It was a silly thing he did when he started the pub. His extreme lack of muggle knowledge meant that he was truly and utterly clueless when it came to muggle culture and had thus overcompensated.
“Third year.” He smiled and looked at him and suddenly Harry felt terribly fond. “You were flying. I was on the ground dressed as a dementor, you may remember that time I was a massive wanker, and you thought it was real and shot a Patronus at me.” He chuckled softly. “I remember being terrified and humiliated and furious and so in awe. Anyway, I’ll never forget how you looked. Just all fierce and daring and so powerful at that age. And I remember thinking, I’d do anything to be near someone so powerful, so beautiful.” The words swirled around them. Fierce and lovely and terrifying circling above them like mist. “But I was such a prick and you hated me so the only way I could get a taste of you was to be an evil little swine and have you turn the power on me. And you never failed, Harry.” The smile was sad this time and Harry’s ears strained for any sounds Draco would make. A breath, a word, a heartbeat. “What will you do now?”
The camping shop was bustling with a mixture of tourists and locals picking various…well camping equipment he supposes. There isn’t anything he particularly needs but finds the tools they have to offer quite interesting. He scoffs at how useful some of them would have been on his previous camping trip.
Harry moved onto his knees in front of him. “Draco, please wake up. It’s a dream. It’s just a dream.” His voice was pleading, panicked.
Harry amused himself by talking to the cat that was perched by the shop’s windowsill. Draco was now entertaining both the girls and the shop owner now and all three were clearly beholden to him. Harry shook his head conspiratorially at the cat. She ignored him and stretched luxuriously, paws soaking up the last of the afternoon sun.
“You’ve changed, Malfoy. It’s…good. ” He rolled over, back to Draco once more and Draco stared at his back, the curve of his shoulders. “Goodnight.”
Harry leant back on his hands. “Sorry, did you say something else? I was still thinking about just how decent your arse is.”
“No can do – banished remember? Come on, my arse is freezing. Grab your stuff, you’re staying with me.”
“Decent my arse, Potter. I was excellent. It wasn’t my fault that you were like a niffler in a jewellery shop when it came to the snitch.”
No, he would continue to hold Kingsley off and investigate further. There had to be something else. His gut rarely failed him but he had neglected for so long he worried he was misreading the signals.
Harry’s heart stuttered and he had to reel himself in, otherwise he would go charging into the they middle of the fray. Perhaps a couple of years ago, he would have. But a couple of years ago he may not have thrown himself into this mess to save him. That’s a lie, he would have but if Draco got banged up along the way then so be it. Now, however…now when he took in the sight of him it made his heart clench. The way his eyes were fixed on the thug’s wand that was poking into his neck. The way he flinched when a hand was brought to the side of his face in a hard tap. Not enough to be painful but more than enough to threaten.
“Oh yes. I fled to America for the war, you see. But I kept abreast of the situation here at home. It really was something.”
Ron ushered them all into the side of the building and out the sight of potential passers-by. Harry was impressed by his easy command of the team, his confidence putting everyone at ease. Well, everyone besides Harry would not be calm until Draco was safe and in his hands where he…he wanted to say ‘where he belonged’ but he wasn’t sure that was true.
He made the split decision to run for him, shield him from the spells that were coming everywhere when a shout tore through the air.
Harry sensed that the thug’s grasp on his temper was finally the brink. He motioned to Ron, now crouched at the other end of the container, that he was jumping in now. Ron nodded and indicated that he would take the loose ends and Harry was to go for the main threat and get to Draco.
Harry didn’t say anything and continued grin lopsidedly at him. Draco, who could never back down when it came to Harry looked smug that he had no retort. “What?” he said haughtily. “No comeback?”
The gravel crunched under his feet as he cleared the last part of the path and walked up the aptly named ‘Main Road’ into the heart of the town. He found its name amusing as it was pretty much the only road here, not just the main one. It was the most direct route from the small cottages littering the coastline to the busiest part of the village with the community halls and the shops and pubs, but it was comical how tiny the place was.
The flat was warm and inviting and held more alcohol, for which Harry was certainly glad of. Draco lit the lights as he walked from room to room.
Harry laughed properly this time. “I’ve had better. Some blond git had me terrified and pacing in a hospital waiting room.”
Patil and Jackson (at least Harry now knew Henry’s last name now) headed off round the side. Ron suggested that Harry do the wards as he had more heft when it came to adding weight to spells. Harry was still shit at spells that required any kind of finesse. To him it was the difference between picking a lock to open a door or blasting it off its hinges; he could throw most spells hard enough to make them stick.
When he was sure he wasn’t going to be arrested for stealing a camping cooker he made his escape swiftly, ears bright red and head ducked.
“Accio Order of Merlin.” His voice thudded dully off the walls of his small office before the black leather box flew to his hand. Calloused fingers wrapped around it, cool and heavy in his palm. Flicking the clasp the box snapped open its jaws and his eyes took in the medal within. The medal that he was continually instructed to wear at these events and, even long after he had taken it off, could still feel the weight of it, pinned to the fabrics of his robes or, as it truly felt, through the flesh underneath.
The room around him was in upheaval. Patil had sent a Patronus to Ron and Smith was looking through some type of manual like the useless prick he was.
“Ah, that.” His shoulders relaxed and he slipped back into his imperious tone. “Yes, Potter is currently living with me. He’s investigating apparently. Entirely clueless, I tell you, thick as he ever was.” Draco took delight in verbally bashing Harry a little and Fotheringham nodded along serenely. “Anyway, he’ll be on his merry way before long.”
“I am making pancakes, as if that wasn’t obvious and stop talking about how weird it is. You’re making it weirder.”
When he had counted twenty minutes passing Ron finally came through the door looking very grim. Everything in Harry was calling out in fear. He knew. He just knew something had happened.
Withdrawing the parchment and quill to write to Pansy, he resigned himself to the heavy feeling in the pit of his stomach. He smoothed the parchment with his fingers, enjoying the cool feeling on his palms. Picking up his quill he thought about the best way to respond: to grovel or not to grovel.
“Someone’s talking to muggles about Gringotts? Of all the things they could tell muggles about they chose the bloody bank?” Ron had paced around the room as Harry had checked the tent.
Zacharias Smith was standing in front of Draco and firing a number of questions at him. He was stood only a few inches from Draco, far too close to be appropriate in Harry’s opinion. Smith had a couple of inches on Draco and seemed to enjoy using this to his advantage. He was smiling cockily as he asked him questions appearing to delight in Draco’s hunched shoulders and downturned gaze.
Hermione found him in the waiting room outside where they were working on Draco. Every time a healer walked past, lime green robes billowing behind them, he stood and tried to get some information but they ignored him.
Extinguishing the light, he clambered onto the bed trying very hard to not touch Potter lest he be on the receiving end of a fist.
Forest. A forest was where they had sent him. He could hear the distinct sounds of humans nearby and was reassured that he had arrived at the correct place.
“Really taking the piss now…” But he was smiling, as if there was no other response to have to Draco’s mild teasing.
Morning brought a cool breeze and thick clouds as the sky awakened, casting them all under her shadow.
The man blinked dumbly and then the corner of his lips turned into a smile. “What would you recommend?”
Harry was shocked at his candour. His mouth opened and closed several times until he simply nodded, accepting the statement. Draco nodded in turn and began to walk again. They didn’t speak until they reached the pub.
“You have to be in the right frame of mind to be a decent person? Most people try it from birth you know.”
Their conversation moved on to other things until Kingsley’s Patronus interrupted and requested his presence, he hugged her tightly as he left.
Ron nodded slowly. “Patil, you’re going with Harry. Apparate somewhere conspicuous – flat would probably be best. I’ll be along in a minute after I talk to Kingsley and Robards. Go.”
Tempy grabbed her coat from the pathetic looking coat stand and with a wave back at the bar stomped out the door.
The fireplace was small and had a fire guard that was black with gold trimming, pink flowers painted on the front. It obscured most of the view of the fireplace itself and Harry wondered whether Draco had consciously meant to conceal the fire with it, perhaps in order to resist the temptation to use it. The thought made him want put his hands on Draco and simply hold him. Admittedly, he had established that this was something he wanted to do all the time.
The pub that night was the busiest Harry had ever seen it. People were jostling each other at the bar, two fights broke out in which he had heard the filthiest things come out of Draco’s mouth in his clean, crisp accent. Overall, it was a shitshow.
Stepping gingerly over an empty bottle of something that was oozing green sludge, he went into the smallest bedroom of the cottage.
“What?” Harry said, supressing a groan at how red his face most likely was. “You’re looking at me like…”
Draco slowly pulled his hands away from his face and gaped at him. “That’s why you’re here? To talk about the names of the drinks? You nearly gave me a bloody heart attack you stupid prick I thought you were carting me off to Azkaban?”
“I am not predictable, Hermione. I am, in fact, very mysterious.” He smirked at her; in for a penny, in for a pound. “Draco said so.” This only caused her to laugh louder.
“Connections? I’ve told you, I  have no fucking connections. I went to Azkaban, I’m on parole, I’ve lived here, with no one since it all happened. I barely speak to anyone from home. Jesus, do even read the newspaper? My father is in Azkaban, my mother barely speaks to anyone and the rest of them, the whole stinking lot of them are in Azkaban – where they should be. So you’re going to have to elaborate when it comes to asking me about my current connections.”
“I can’t believe we’re having a housewarming. You and me. Mad isn’t it?” Harry asked, smiling as his hands tugged on Draco’s hips.
“…No. I don’t.” Draco made a gesture that indicated there was not much more to be said on the matter.
Dark wood covered almost every surface of the room, from bookcases, to cabinets that held all types of curiosities and a large desk with an obscure paper weight on it. Harry hoped it was purely decorative because the thing was completely ridiculous.
Draco’s body seemed to move without his permission. He scrambled back from Harry’s touch, breaths hitched and coming quickly.
“Hello? Sorry? I can’t – why are you muffled? Turn it around. No, you’re speaking into the wrong bit.” He rolled his eyes, lip curled in impatience, appearing remarkably similar to fourteen year old Draco. “Ah, Fotheringham. What can I do for you?” Draco looked over at Harry, his mouth tight.
Holding his wand high above his head, Lumos shining brightly and illuminating the mass of trees above.
It was creepy in here. The roots of the trees, raised in protest, made the path almost untenable and every unknown noise had the hairs on the back of Draco’s neck standing on end.
“What a beautiful office,” Draco remarked, “Much like one my father had, if I’m being honest.” Draco’s tone of voice was strange and not unlike one he used as a teenager when boasting about something.
Harry felt endless. Endless as Draco stared, heavy lidded, up at him and free as he moved his hips in time with Draco’s breaths.
Unfortunately, Harry had learned the long and hard way that governments are forever falling out of favour and that he would be brought out as a puppet until retirement or until people lost interest in Harry Potter.
It’s busy tonight. This is mainly because he said last week that all green drinks were half price. And most of his drinks were green, being that old habits die hard and such.
As he gave the girl her drinks, she smiled ever so sweetly at him, and he gave her his best ‘darling-if-you-had-a-dick-that-smile-would-definitely-work-but-those-tits-would-be-an-obstacle-for-me’ smile and rang up her total.
Harry was scanning the front pages of the local papers in an attempt to keep tabs with whatever mundane activities were happening in town, only vaguely aware of the conversation going on next to him.
“Okay, firstly, you need to stop reading Sherlock Holmes and watching ‘Clueless’ at the same time – you’re getting them confused. Secondly, I have notorious bad luck, if you’ll remember every one of my years at Hogwarts ending in disaster.”
Potter’s mouth opened and closed several times and he finally nodded. Draco nodded too and reached to the top shelf for the tea. He shook it in front of Potter. “Is this okay?”
“And for him? If we decide that we want to be together then he’s going to get the brunt of the shit from people.”
Harry’s mind was reeling. For one thing, Fotheringham was definitely a wizard and Draco clearly had him on side.
“Because fuck you that’s why.” Potter bristled in confusion at this. “Well, if I’m being honest not just you but what you represent.”
Harry began his slow walk back to the tent, deflated at having found hints to something but not anything concrete. He walked past the newsagents stand and saw the headlines for the local sports team decimating the town’s rival club. The locals seemed pleased. Flags and handmade signs could be seen in some of the windows on his various hikes across the town’s many hills that day.
They hadn’t turned the soft lamps off yet and instead lay on top of the covers exhausted and relieved both.
“That is the only thing I do in front of them, and they barely even notice. You can check my wand if you’re so concerned. Christ, question me under Veritiserum if you have to just don’t make this into something it’s not.”
“I’m going to head then.” He slapped his thighs and stood up, heading for the door. “Let me know if you change your mind.”
He decided to chance his luck and speak to Draco through is ear piece. Gingerly, he picked up the bottom of the device and held it close to his mouth, palms sweating. “Draco, it’s Harry.”
Harry touched his hand where Draco had held it, warmer than the rest of his body, and caught up with him.
Harry had continued to be gentle and considerate all morning and neither of them mentioned the kiss, despite the fact that it was running on a loop in Draco’s mind.
“Potter…I know we’re…that’s just…we’re not that far from the fucking Forbidden Forest and you’re camping in the bloody woods.”
“Knock yourself out,” he replied blandly. “Feel free to take that literally.” Potter smirked at this, and Draco’s stomach flipped. “I’d recommend staying at the B&B at the bottom of the road, it’s the nicest and the breakfast is excellent. So, I’ve heard.”
After pulling at his hair for what was the first of many to come after it, he made his way upstairs to get himself ready for the shitshow that would be the rest of this day.
There was spluttering down the end of the receiver, he could hear Fotheringham asking Draco if he was alright.
Kingsley nodded and laughed kindly. Harry was aware of Draco sitting uncomfortably at the edge of the sofa, attempting to remain out of view from Kingsley.
She marched right up to him and held him. “Oh, Harry. Are you alright? Ron told me what happened, said you’d be here. Have you heard anything?”
Potter rolled onto his side away from him and Draco felt a small part of his heart twinge at the sight. Rejection from this man was a familiar hurt for Draco and he had never learned to just accept.
He laughed breathlessly at the true absurdity of this moment. He was in Draco Malfoy’s muggle apartment, holding his face thanking him for being brave and questioning some wanker who was giving potions to muggles. It was one of the most bizarre moments Harry had had in his life thus far and a half-giant had once told him he was a wizard at eleven.
“This is ridiculous,” Robards spat. He turned to Kingsley, his hand still on the vials. “Potter here, seems to think that Malfoy, a Death Eater, is working for the Aurors! He is doing anything to save his skin no doubt. That’s what he’s doing, they’ve not changed you know.”
Harry just stood there, wanting desperately to know anything, but only if it was good news. Otherwise, he would take the waiting. Would endure the interminable waiting and the white walls of the hospital to hold on to the possibility that all was going to be okay.
Before even stepping in front of the mirror, it began to spew vitriol at him. Its ornate frame was shuddering from the intensity with which the glass was chastising him from abandoning his skincare routine last night.
The promise of what tomorrow could bring was something to be hopeful for and Harry felt a contentment settle deep in his bones.
Fotheringham looked delighted at this turn of events and clapped his hands together twice. For a second Harry panicked that he himself had been tricked and Draco was somehow more familiar with this man than he had let on.
When Harry apparated into Draco’s apartment, Patil gripping his elbow, he immediately began looking for Smith.
“Things worse than you have tried to kill me and not manged to make it stick. Forgive me if I can tolerate being around you, Draco.” Harry rolled his eyes and stared up at the ceiling.
Draco returned Potter’s imperious look which was much more effective: he’d had far more opportunity to perfect the act of being a twat.
Harry reached out a hand to his shoulder in an attempt to wake him. “Draco? It’s okay. You’re okay, wake up.” It seemed to only disturb him further as the shaking doubled and wet, cries were being shaken from his chest.
“Yes, I’ll bet. Well, my friend would be happy to talk to him about it. As he is also…not straight. Far from it actually.” He smiled nervously, eyes flicking to Harry and then away again.
Draco shook his head and then marched back up the street to continue arguing with the shite-van man.
He sucked in a breath and allowed himself to succumb to the familiar plunging and sucking sensation until he was finally transported to his destination.
“Someone is breaking the Statute of Secrecy…by talking to muggles about wizarding things…but nothing else? No magic being used, or anyone being hurt?”
Harry’s heart stopped dead and he whipped round to look at them both. The two were none the wiser and continued with their utterly baffling conversation.
By this point, Patil had jumped off his desk and paused when she reached the door. “Sorry, one last thing – you’ve to wear the Order of Merlin. It’s a big one today and they need the press distracted.”
He really was doing an excellent job at this. Smith seemed to be thinking the same as he looked very smug all of a sudden. Prick.
It was dark but they could hear voices near the back of the warehouse, too muffled to hear any one of them distinctly. There were crates everywhere, piled high and ready for shipping, their destinations scribbled across them carelessly.
“Ah, they really are quite magical.” He winked and Harry felt something shift uncomfortably inside him. He simply nodded as Draco said his goodbyes.
It felt rehearsed to him as his descriptions left his mouth. Only half of his mind was present, the rest being with Draco. When Ron declared the inquisition over everyone began to head back to their offices.
“Tonight, I thought it was over. My life here, my life after sentencing, just my…life. I thought they would arrest me, even if I hadn’t done anything.”
Draco’s breath was hitched in his ear as Harry removed his clothes, peeling off every layer with a hunger and curiosity. Harry sighed as he felt Draco underneath him, this sea of skin that met his.
Harry had never been one with words. Ever intense and impulsive. And that was why, without much thought behind it, other than to give Draco some sort of port in the storm that was brewing within him, he pressed his lips to Draco’s forehead. And cheeks. His nose, his chin and finally, when the sobs had lessened and the tremors were distant, his lips.
He found them in the living room, cramped around what appeared to be a small speaker. Voices could be heard coming from it indistinct at first to Harry’s ears. Smith was sitting on the floor and holding some sort of old looking telephone. One part, connected by a black wire, he held to his ear and the other to his mouth.
“Yeah…” Harry frowned at the scene before them. One half of the team appeared to be normal and the other half were incredibly lucky at every turn. Lucky...
“I see,” Draco began slowly, “Well, now you know how I feel.” Then he smiled. And it was the best thing Harry had ever seen in his whole fucking life.
Malfoy was pointy and sneering and a right git. But this man? Face soft and dreamlike from bright sun throwing its warmth from the large window. Fair eyelashes cast shadows on his cheekbones that didn’t look quite as sharp in this light just…delicate. His nose was still pointy but in a way that added a childlike look to him. Thin lips pressed together in a pout which was the closest feature this person had to Malfoy.
“I don’t want to hear about your arse, thanks. What are you going on about anyway, I’m not going anywhere with –“
At the top of the stairs was a small landing filled with rubbish, a far cry from the pristine rooms downstairs. Empty potion bottles, cauldrons and other debris was scattered on the carpet. A smell of stale booze and possibly piss hung in the air. Harry’s nose wrinkled.
“I know, I heard. I’m dealing with it.” Ron cut him off and gave him a look that eventually quieted him.
Dragging himself to the fireplace he threw in some floo powder and waited for the green flames to lick up the side of the dark brick.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Draco, I’m not sure many of our guests are going to be willing or able to drink that amount of alcohol,” Harry said, trying his best to sound reasonable.
“Draco! Aha!” His smile was too wide, as if painted on for effect. A suit decorated entirely in a paisley pattern, which felt a bit like an optical illusion to Harry, was tailored to his long body.
Fotheringham’s voice was closer now, his breath could be heard in Harry’s ear. Almost as if he was there in person.
“Nothing sinister we don’t think. But basically, it seems like someone is breaking the Statute of Secrecy – muggles are talking about things they shouldn’t know about is the gist of it.”
At one point, Draco had upped his antics with his bottle tossing and Harry was impressed with his ability of wandless magic. When he mentioned this to him, mouth close to the flesh of his ear, he had received a ‘God, Potter, stop talking about my wand so much! Seek help already, it’s an addiction!’
The sound of the gathering crowd buzzed in the streets and the back of Harry’s neck pricked with sweat. At the bottom of the stairs the suspects were unceremoniously handed over to Harry and the door was open.
“R-Ron what’s going on?” Ron looked seriously at him as if contemplating what to tell him. “Please just tell me.” His voice was verging on pleading.
Harry was escorted around the back, still unspotted. The Auror leading him walked briskly and he strained to keep up.
“Will you calm down? He wouldn’t listen and then got the van wedged – I know, like you said it would – and then I did a little memory charm so I could get it back out for him.”
As soon as he finished he was moving again and directed the men toward the portkey. Robards was waiting there, a look of mild satisfaction flooding his face. He had done well today. His Aurors had performed well, the press were pleased and his performing monkey had obeyed every instruction. It made Harry hate him. It was his fault Harry was in this ridiculous situation. It didn’t matter how much Harry had protested, tried to become more involved, threatened even, Robards was unmoving. He saw a chance to improve the reputation of his department and he took it.
Draco’s pale brows knitted in confusion until he remembered the reason why Harry was perhaps being so gentle with him this morning. Blood rushed to his face and he groaned inwardly.
The most basic things he thought he would need was stuffed into a rucksack and he had made a short trip to Ron and Hermione’s to borrow the tent that had been both a blessing and a curse during their horcrux camping trip around Britain.
It was Fotheringham, obnoxious as usual, who came striding in and demanding all attention on him. Harry did roll his eyes now, a much more worthy cause, as the man threw his arms wide and greeted the shop owner. He reminded Harry of a peacock, sauntering around the room slowly, as if to give everyone the chance to admire him fully. Feathers on full display and dark eyes that didn’t give much away, he was a peculiar picture altogether.
Malfoy’s long fingers were in the middle of spooning some blueberries onto his plate when he stopped suddenly, hands in mid-air, staring at his tea.
Thankfully, he wasn’t there long and seemed to be wrangling the older woman into a business deal. He flounced to the door and held it open for a couple of teenage girls who giggled while coming inside. They exchanged silent, unreadable glances with each other and Harry wondered how he had ever held a conversation with a woman in his life,  they seemed to be capable of far more complex thoughts than he was.
Draco hadn’t said much. Had instead busied himself things around the apartment but Harry knew he was worried. People were coming into his home and looking for evidence on a criminal, it was understandable that he was paranoid about himself.
The library was helpful with its various books on the artistry of mixing drinks, but he didn’t understand the references of their names, so he made his own; spending hours reading books on cocktails and eventually making his on concoctions. His main source material turned out to be a film aptly named ‘Cocktail’ with a famous muggle actor called Tom Cruise. Muggle Tom spent the entire film making impressive drinks and showing off by throwing the bottles and glasses in the air.
The final pub was the farthest away from the rest of the town, hence why he had left it until last. His eye could just catch it at the bottom of the dark street, not even the streetlamps touching it with their hazy orange glow. Harry could hear music faintly emanating from the windows that were cracked open.
When the trails emptied around lunchtime, he wandered down the street and popped into some of the shops, filling his back with random fridge magnets he wouldn’t use and shortbread he wouldn’t eat.
“Aye, that’ll do it. Need to get yourself fed and watered I suppose and then something to put you to sleep for a while. I recommend a large dose of Skele-gro. Disgusting, but gets the job done.” She laughed heartily while Harry stared at her. “Well, if you’ve been round these parts a couple days, you’ll know what I’m talking about. Have a nice night, son.”
Was he flirting? Was he really flirting with Draco Malfoy? Not only two days ago, he had thought Draco a pretentious git who was easily led, if he ever thought about him. And now? Now he was flirting with him while supposedly on the job and blushing while he made muggle cocktails. Merlin’s arse, what was he doing?
“No, you’ve to report for the Portkey room and then await further instructions. I think you’ll be travelling with someone too.”
An hour later, Harry was in full swing of feeling sorry for himself. He went over the day in his head, the humiliation of it. Head tilted back on the arm of the chaise he pressed the bottle to his lips. He had had enough. It was ridiculous.
To have a drink called ‘Finnegan’s Fireball? Sure, it wasn’t that uncommon a name but paired with the other weird shit going on? If Harry found out Seamus fucking Finnegan was serving drinks and naming them weird shit, he would honest to goodness kill the bastard.
It strikes Harry how different the people are in here. This pub seems to cater to all demographics. There are couples, the elderly, teenagers of dubious drinking age and everything in between and all are holding…the most bizarre drinks he had ever seen in his entire life, and he once drank wine made by elves.
They had moved into the cottage three months ago. It was quaint, like something painted onto the side of an old British biscuit tin. Ivy covered brick walls surrounded the building which itself was losing a fight to the climbing roses who appeared victorious in their attempt to climb in through the windows.
They huddled around the portkey, Ron to his left and Patil to his right. Smith was not coming thank fucking goodness as Harry’s temper could only withstand so much.
Traipsing into the kitchen the lights turned on, a dim glow casting shadows on the round kitchen table.
A couple of months ago Ginny had taken him aside and said that if he ever wanted to touch a pair of tits again then he better get his act together and do something about it. Her idea of him ‘doing something about it’ was to demand he grow a beard, never wear trainers again and buy jeans that didn’t hang off his arse. She was right, he did look better but he wasn’t sure he was doing it to see more tits per se and more to appease her.
As he approached, apprehension filled his gut. The pub looked welcoming; window baskets decked in flowers that he didn’t knew even grew this time of year and condensation dripping from the heat and no doubt bodies crammed inside.
“Oh, morning. Hope you don’t mind,” he gestured the magazine, “I just didn’t want to move and wake you.”
! As Odysseus. I thought he’d sent him to tell me off, but he really was just watching how it all played out with Olivia. He
Then he slipped one leg between Draco’s and put his head on Draco’s shoulder, resting their foreheads against each other.
She sterilised her scalpel while Draco snapped a few photographs of the scar and Harry watched both of them, bouncing his legs nervously.
There was no use sugar-coating it. Harry would only start imagining even worse scenarios. Draco just said it outright. “Chang’s at Mungo’s. She’s alright now, but somebody attacked her a few hours ago. They got away.”
And then Potter stepped into his field of view, green eyes locking with grey ones. Their feet were almost touching, Draco could feel warm breath fanning against his throat. Potter reached out for his face slowly and, Merlin, was he going to
Harry was directly behind him as they exited the study space. He seemed slightly surprised when Draco turned to him and pushed his stuff into his arms as they reached the lockers.
without work? Nowadays it was probably his sole purpose in life. Why should he even get up in the morning? How was he supposed to pay off his
“You got suspended for three games. That’s quarter a season,” Draco said irritably. “Who knows if Greyson will let you play again?”
It was Harry’s reserve Felicity McCarthy, who (despite belonging to the winning team) didn’t look all that happy. Her mood soured further when she spotted Harry.
to do it quietly for once), and Adonis put a hand on his lower arm (presumably to shut him up) when people at surrounding tables gave them dirty looks.
Draco was just debating whether he would be able to kick Potter’s shin from his diagonal position on his first attempt, when the tapping suddenly stopped. Holding his breath, Draco strained his ears for the slightest hint of a direction, but the squeaky sound was gone as well. The sound of Potter turning a page was overly loud in the sudden silence and then – Potter was quietly whistling some kind of tune, five notes repeated two times. And then he started humming again, and Draco had a sudden suspicion.
“What’s that?” asked Theo and Draco snatched up the tie in a flash, stuffing it underneath his mattress.
All of them turned to look at him. Weasley seemed dumbfounded. Pansy looked slightly betrayed. Draco leaned forward so he wouldn’t have to see it anymore. The fourth group was in the air already, and three of them were actually not all that bad. In the end, nobody commented on the fact that Draco had just talked to Granger, and they were silent for several minutes.
But when Draco was lying in bed later, it wasn’t sex he was thinking about. He couldn’t help but think how nice it had been of Harry not to compare him to the movie’s villain in retaliation. The resemblance was certainly there – rejected by the hero and subsequently acting against him because of it. Had Harry really not seen it?
Harry grinned, which certainly wasn’t an appropriate reaction to assault. “In that case, I’ll even buy you some ice cream afterwards.”
he get in?” Draco just couldn’t make sense of it. “He Apparated directly into your house; he shouldn’t have been able to do that.”
Potter didn’t even react and went right on doing it, so Draco picked up the Chocolate Frog card he had used as a place marker last time and propelled it across the table. It slid right under Potter’s arm and got stuck there.
need to be nervous about? Brilliant. Not even twenty-four hours after their first kiss. (And also their second, but Draco was trying to erase that one from his memory.)
He turned back around, but Dumbledore was gone. It was Harry who was kneeling at his feet, and he was wearing the emerald shirt, which was slashed to ribbons and stained with his own blood. And all around him the blood seeped into the joints between the stones, snaking its way outwards.
Harry punched his arm with considerable force. “You didn’t tell me you are such a player.” Harry raised one eyebrow suggestively. “You can call me Enrico if you want.”
” Draco exclaimed, plonking himself down on Aurelius' other side. “You're a fairy friend! No, that's not right ... a fair ... something.”
He turned around, heart racing, and saw the least likely person standing in the exact middle of his sitting room, as if she was trying not to touch anything.
All eyes were on him – only Ginny and Blaise, who were still shielding him from the Aurors, didn’t turn around to look at him.
remembered was talking about Potter’s Muggle ex-girlfriend – the one the Prophet had written about last year, earning their editor-in-chief a shrunken head courtesy of Potter – and then some stuff about old Italian women in yoga pants.
Draco pulled himself together with massive effort and turned Anastasia around so the on-lookers could only see their backs. His wand was already in his hands and it didn’t take him much effort at all to cast the curse.
“Don’t sell yourself short,” Draco said in his most condescending voice, “You are worth at least seventy percent of the average friend.”
“Just demonstrating how easy it is to break into your house,” said a rough voice right next to his ear, warm breath tickling his neck.
… but maybe something … not teen-girly, if he could help it. This was his first shift since the article, after all. He was expecting at least some kind of trouble.
“Right. Reasonable,” Potter said earnestly, which of course meant he didn’t believe a word of it. “Anything else in here that Parkinson might want to burn?”
“Not half bad,” was what Draco settled on. “And I’m definitely not telling you his name. You’re way too nosey.”
Draco drew his own, new wand and pointed it at the hawthorn one, encasing it in a wooden frame and then sealing it with a pane of glass. He plucked it out of the air and used his wand a second time to fix the frame to the wall right next to the fireplace. As he sat down on the other arm rest, he felt oddly light, like he had solved a problem he hadn’t been aware of until now.
Harry rolled his eyes but still looked over his shoulder to make sure that Kreacher wasn’t lurking. “Sirius’ mother did it plenty of times. He probably loved it.”
(Draco suspected that he was missing a rather big joke). Hannah Abbott, who was apparently dating Longbottom (who would have thought he had it in him?), had volunteered to play as Keeper. The oldest Weasley (was that Charlie?) was talking Chaser strategies with Potter’s Weasley. Angelina Johnson, who had joined them after lunch, took up a bat.
And really, he should have guessed it. Because which person with actually functioning eyes wore pink jeans with a turquoise sweater and multi-coloured fabric bracelets?
There was no time to ponder the question or even to decide which one of them was the one with the problem, because then there was a
In the few seconds it took Draco to pass the cafe’s window front and open the door, Harry had turned around three times. He seemed nervous and twitchy, and he noticed Draco almost immediately, which resulted in a relieved expression upon his face.
He had originally expected Harry to leave before midnight, but there was no way that Draco would risk staying just to realise that Harry was staying as well. Safer to make his exit while he still could.
Draco could imagine the toll it took on Harry. He’d been banned for months, then he’d been gravely injured and unfit to fly for another two months, and just when he’d managed to get back on the broom, they
If it kept going on like that, it would only take him a week to gain back all the weight he had lost in the last month.
“Here’s a tip,” said Liam gravely. “Check to see that you haven’t got any important things still lying around his flat before you break up with someone. Like the only copy of a paper that took you three weeks to write.”
Confusion was written all over Harry’s face, but he wasn’t stupid enough to object. Jian actually clapped her hands. “How wonderful! Congratulations! What can I get you?”
There was a silence during which they just stared at each other while the Healers worked on quietly.
No sense in trying to get out the full sentence in one go. Draco felt like he would never be able to stop laughing. Maybe it was a side-effect of Potter’s Walkman; that would be just like him, to not tell him about the dangers.
Harry was getting louder now. “Gee, I don’t know, Draco! You might remember that I also trusted Cho not to stab you!”
“I bet that’s what it’s all about,” added Blaise after a few minutes of silence. “Whoever signed you up is trying to ruin you completely by pitting you against him.”
“Still your parents trusted him with their lives,” Draco pressed on. “You have to consider every possibility.”
Draco hadn’t initially known what to make of Davenport, who was the first female Slytherin player in almost two decades and the first female captain since there was Quidditch at Hogwarts. But it seemed that she was ready to make short work of anyone who wasn’t up to the task. They were barely three minutes into the trials, and she’d already weeded out one-third of all applicants, half of which were on their way to the hospital wing now.
McCarthy glared at her now, obviously hurt that both his team mates would just undermine him like that.
Harry caught the Snitch!” He grinned at them. “Do you want to join us? After all, it’s due to you that Harry could play.”
“We’re so close! If we keep this up, we’ll crack the speed problem before New Year’s!” Blaise said enthusiastically while Potter mumbled something in agreement around a full mouth.
Draco thought about casting a mild repelling charm around himself, but ultimately decided against it. Those only really held when it wasn’t raining too much and the wind stayed reasonable, which it was and didn’t. Draco couldn’t cast a stronger charm, either. He needed to reserve enough of his magic for emergencies.
His blanket embrace felt completely wrong all of a sudden, so Draco focused his attention on trying to unwrap it as quietly as he could.
.” Potter shrugged. “Guess now’s the time to tell you that I’m not interested in that, isn’t it? I’d rather sit here and do all the work alone than have to fight anyone ever again.”
Draco's mind was racing. Not-Potter had kissed him. He had been kissed. He had a crush on Harry fucking Potter, which was a total fucking
Theo’s shoulders dropped significantly. “Wow, that’s stupid. Do they even know that Moaning Myrtle’s
– and the rest was gone entirely. It was a really terrible line to repeat to yourself all day, especially if – how to put this? – your family just lost a war. Even if Draco didn’t necessarily see the end of the war as a personal loss. That was the image other people had of him.
The words had barely left his mouth when Harry brought up both arms in between Draco’s, slammed his elbows back down into the crook of Draco’s arms, breaking Draco’s grip on him, and then grabbed one of his arms, twisted it onto his back and pressed him against the door face first – all in under three seconds.
The Medi-Muggles let go of him and one of them went straight back to the car, having apparently decided that he wouldn’t be a problem any longer.
Draco knew both McCarthy siblings from his time at Hogwarts. Timothy had been the Slytherin prefect during Draco’s first year and fiercely protective of his sister, who had been sorted into Slytherin at the start of Draco’s third year. Draco rather feared for Potter’s safety. McCarthy was clearly out for blood, probably blaming Potter for his sister’s concussion three weeks ago.
“He thinks he’s better than us,” she said matter-of-factly. “It always felt like he was looking down on us.”
. His Trainee Healers kept talking about it as soon as he turned his back on them (because he gave them very pointed looks whenever they did it in front of him). Patients were reading it and speculating with each other.
had told Draco was that Harry had walked into the forest all alone and unarmed, and that the Dark Lord had used
“When have you ever shut up during a movie?” Lauren tossed some popcorn at her, which got intercepted by Harry’s mouth.
He also didn’t mention that Harry was a highly unusual subject, due to the aforementioned dying, and that Draco needed to make sure that normal people reacted the same way he did.
“I’m …” Potter pushed back his chair, creating some more distance between them, and tipped his head back. “Look, I’m just …”
have been avoiding him a little bit,” Draco admitted reluctantly. “But I’m not really looking forward to what he could want to talk about, especially when he is that drunk. He probably has some kind of speech prepared, about how he forgives me for my sins, because he is just
Draco wasn’t sure how much time had passed since his shift had ended. It seemed like hours ago, or maybe just seconds.
And then something grabbed his leg from behind, yanking him back to the ground in one brutal stroke, and ropes wound all around him, tying him up tightly, locking his legs together and squeezing his arms against his chest. It felt like there was no air left in his lungs.
“She’s unconscious and we have to cut her out. There’s no telling yet, I’m afraid …” The Medi-Muggle tried his best to look sympathetic while also blocking his way to the car. “If you’d go over to the ambulance, you could help her immensely by telling my colleague her information, anything you know that could be important –”
“Well, you definitely had a fever,” Draco said. “No wonder, after waiting a whole week before coming to the hospital.”
“Did you listen to what she was saying?” Harry laughed. “She asked you out on New Year’s Eve. That’s a date.”
Harry seemed somewhat reluctant at first, only kissing back half-heartedly, but then the song changed from ‘Daydream Believer’ to ‘Hey Jude’ and Draco sat up on top of him and dragged the toga over his head before he could change his mind, and Harry’s hands reached for him automatically, roaming over his chest, his stomach, the two long scars slashed right across.
