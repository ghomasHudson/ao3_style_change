“I’m just here to dance,” I say back, and, upping the ante a little, lick a long stripe along the cord of his neck before I pull my head back to look at his face again.  His eyes widen further.  He’s delicious, just sweaty enough to taste a hint of salt.  He smells like something…a tree, or a fruit, or…I can’t place it, but I like it.  His hair is blonde, a little long over his eyes, but short at the back.  My hands drift from his waist to his arse, which I squeeze, and one of his own hands grips my neck possessively, while the other cards through my hair.  There’s something about his eyes.  Maybe it’s just the lighting, but I’d swear they’re silver.  He’s still looking at me like there’s something he’s trying to figure out, so I stare at his lips to help him along.  They’re a little thin, his lips, but one side of his mouth is quirked up in a sexy little smirk, and I hope that he’ll figure out the answer to whatever question he’s asking and just kiss me already.
It galled him to have to ask, but, with a little moue of distaste, he said, “I don’t know much about Cass’ routines, her likes and dislikes.  Anything I should be aware of?”
“What do you mean, unconscious mind?” I ask.
“Of course,” he said icily.  “Yes, how silly of me.”  He stood, a bit shakily.
“That’s fine.  Kreacher will be thrilled.  Speaking of, how come you didn’t tell me I had a house elf?”
“Er, yes.  I’m sorry?  I can take it back.  Well, I don’t think I can, actually, that man didn’t seem like someone who’d give refunds, but I can keep him.”  Draco reached out to take the puppy back, but Harry clutched it tighter.
“Yes, he lives with Andromeda right now, but I spend a lot of time with him.  He’s lovely, and it would be nice for you to see your Aunt, wouldn’t it?”
“Can you take the snake to Luna?  Actually, fuck that?  Draco?  We have a snake now.”
“Perhaps.  Why did you never tell me that you were seeing him?”
“Oh, um, she couldn’t make it,” Harry said.  “D-dragon flu.”
“And, not to be indelicate, but that’s like, a lot of money.  More than I could probably spend in a lifetime.”
So I do.
“I mean it Draco.  I just…I don’t understand why.”  His voice wobbled a little on the last syllable, drawing it out in a shaky tremor.
“Who?”
“Why would they call you over something like that?”
“Very well,” she says.  Draco’s features are suffused with relief, and then a single moment of loss.
“Mother, he hates me.”
“Thank you.  You didn’t have to agree to help me, especially when you found out that I betrayed your best friend.  I appreciate it.”
He smiled weakly.  “Maybe a four.  This isn’t my favourite vacation, but I’m fine.”
There was one email in her inbox, and it was clearly from her dad.
So great was his shame, Harry found himself unable to leave the lovely bedroom.  He sat on the edge of the bed, trying not to mess it up, and wallowed in his misery.  A knock at the door interrupted his self-flagellation.  “Dad?”
She pours a clear liquid into a glass, followed by another, carbonated clear liquid and plunks a lime wedge in.  “There you are.  Gin.  Soda.  Perfect for a night of dancing.”
“No, please.  I insist. I’ll take the couch.  I just want to have a cup of tea before bed.”
At midday, Ron and Hermione appeared, Ron disappearing upstairs to play with Harry, while Hermione pored over his notes.  “Draco, this is excellent,” she said, after she’d made her way through the parchments.  “I truly think you’re on to something.  It’s the Valerian from the blood thickener, the Monkshood and the Sage from the inflammation potion, and the Ashwinder eggs from the love potion.”
“I don’t think I’d like to be alone.”
Draco’s footsteps pound up behind me.  “What’s your problem?”
I wanted to say thanks so much for reading, and for your lovely comments and kudos.  It's really been so wonderful to see that you're enjoying this story as much as I enjoyed reading it.
I’ve grown accustomed to Luna saying things that I don’t understand, and, although it initially took me some time to accept the futility of trying to gain an explanation, I’ve learned to roll with it.  Draco, however, is sending me panicky eyes, as though the ensuing newspaper article will make us all seem mad.  It might, I allow, but my instinct is telling me to trust Luna, and so I merely smile reassuringly back at Draco, and try to haul Luna back to the point.
“I don’t know,” he’d said, a little frantically.  “I want to hide somewhere and have this baby, and keep it safe.  The media...and Draco...I just wish I could be safe.”
Harry was just about to excuse himself to his borrowed bed, when Draco said, “Harry?”
Harry grinned at Draco.  “It’s bedlam here, sorry.”
Draco looked at him in surprise.  “That was…well said,” he marvelled.
“Harry, I don’t think that’s wise.  You and Malfoy have a bunch of really bad history.”
“Yes…”
Draco removed his hands, and gave him a half-hearted glare.  “Does anything about our lifestyle suggest that we have any contact with the Magical world?”
“Yes, Papa, thank you!  Mama, I’m getting a broom of my own!” Scorpius called out excitedly.  Cass was grinning at her brother, clearly excited for him.
“Aw, don’t be mean, Draco.”
This is deemed acceptable, and she curls up on my windowsill with her notebook and a quill.  “She’s awesome,” I confide in a low voice to Mill.
Kingsley looks startled.  “Harry, why is my intuition telling me that you’re reconsidering this job offer?”
“Yes, of course, Cheri.”  She rolled her eyes at him, and he gestured helplessly back, unsure how to fix anything.
The pizza arrived, and soon, they were sitting at the table.  Cass had outdone herself with pizza ingredient selection, and Harry was looking at it in consternation.  “What are these little strips?  Why do they look like fish?”
“Thought you were going to be an Auror.”
“Sorry.  Head Auror Robards.  Your boss.”
“Thanks, Ron.”
“You’re barking,” George said with a grin.  “Little Ginny?  I don’t believe it.”
in bad shape.  Can you come?”
“Remus?  I’m frightened,” I say.  Then, I realize.  “Oh!  I’m frightened.  I haven’t felt that since…”
‘What’s a potion?” Harry interrupted.
“Try again.”  Harry didn’t recognize the voice.  He tentatively opened his eyes again, and noted that whoever it was, they’d spelled the lights lower.  He blinked myopically and, when he realized that he was lying down, tried to struggle to a seated position.  He suddenly realized that he had no idea where he was, that a stranger was talking to him, and he couldn’t remember much from before he was here.  He stiffened, and felt a cool hand on his arm.  He felt his glasses being placed gently on his face, and though he flinched, at least he could see a bit better. “Harry,” the stranger, a woman, a British woman, he realized, said.  “You’re safe.”
“Snape?  Why would he do that?”
“Listen,” I say softly, trying to diffuse the situation, but all the time I’m thinking that I’m going to go truly mad if I stay in this insane society.  “I appreciate that you’re trying to help me, I really do.  But you can’t just expect me to supplant my own thoughts with your opinion, right?”
“You really are the smartest witch I know.”
Hermione and Draco exchanged amused little smiles, and Draco thought,
A tired looking resident looked up at his arrival.  “Room four,” he said.  Harry nodded gratefully, and carried Scorpius into the healing room, gently depositing him on the bed.  The resident followed him, and Harry quickly explained the situation.
“Of course I didn’t, Grace.”
“Their animosity at school was the stuff of legends.”
.  The month after that, it simply says,
right though.”
“And your plans to achieve that?”
, he thought.
He seems to have lost most of the prickly formality that he was wearing like a cloak.  Emboldened, I continue, “So that’s where you come in.  I want your help in removing the curse, Draco.”
Cass watched, and listened, and learned, and finally decided that enough was enough.  She counted back in her head, and realized that it had been five days since she’d heard from Dad.  And Papa was never going to help her unless she forced him to.  She waited until she knew that Papa was tucking Scorpius in, and with a few minutes to spare before he came to check on her, she set the scene.  At first, she considered the pathos of hiding in her closet, but it was too much of a slap at her dignity.  Very well.  Thrown across the bed, then.  She artfully arranged her limbs, and concentrated.  At first, it was difficult to muster any tears at all.  Cass simply wasn’t much of a crier.  She thought of the saddest things she could, and found, to her surprise, the moment she thought about how much she missed her Dad, the tears came of their own accord.  She’d been holding herself together, because she hadn’t seen another choice, but the moment she gave in to her loneliness and worry, it was like unstoppering a vial.  Cass wept, and the tears felt good.
“Alright.”  Mister Fortesque looks a bit wary, but he’s such a friendly sort of man that even wariness looks good natured.
I half-heartedly consider coming on to him, but I’m tired still, and he looks exhausted, so I just snuggle into the curl of his arms and lie there, languishing in how warm he is, and how comforting he smells.
A sigh.  Rolled eyes.  A hint of the inevitable attitude to come as Cass approached her adolescence.  Then, a sunny smile and a little squeeze around his middle as she disappeared into the kitchen.  “Insufferable monster,” the deep voice said.
“What’s changed?  I know you’ve been working hard with Lara, but you seem so different.”
Harry stood too, wanting to allow Malfoy some time with his son, but Scorpius stretched out his hands in Harry’s direction. “Mr. Harry,” he said, his voice wobbling.
“Nobody would care.
“I suppose so.”
“Harry.”  Hermione says.  I still can’t look at her, but the way she says my name is terrible.  As though she’s ruined my life.  Which, maybe she has, but I’ll be damned if we’re going to have any
“Potter…”
“That’s terrifying.”
“You’ve got this.”
“I don’t love you.  I love…well I don’t love you, that’s for sure.  Besides that, nobody’s cursed me, but you’ve assaulted me.  I know all about the stupid potions.”
Hermione places three drops of the liquid onto his tongue, and asks, “What is your full name?”
“Or-"
“Tori, Cass got her wand while we were in Diagon.”
“‘kay.”
“As much as I ever do.  Do I need to do anything to help things along?”
“Dudley and Uncle Vernon,” Harry said distractedly.  “Can I look at my robes?  And my wand?”
Harry looked up.  He’d wondered if John had been flirting with him the last time he’d been here.  His work meant that he visited Mungo’s fairly often.  He was a nice looking man, with sandy brown curls, and dark eyes.  He was quite a bit taller than Harry, and broad in the shoulders.  And he was a decent bloke, easy to talk to.
Harry blinked at Ron for a full twenty seconds.  “Well, it was fairly easy,” he said, “because kissing her made me feel scared and grossed out, and, messed up as I was then, even I knew that wasn’t supposed to happen.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, scrubbing his hair back from his forehead.  “This is going to prompt all sorts of speculation.  About me, and whether I’m unhinged.  About Draco, and what I’m covering up for him.  About Cass and whether she’ll be the first female Dark Lord.  But I just…lost my temper.”
“I think so,” Cass said thoughtfully.  “I feel something, but I don’t know how to describe it.”
“Sorry?”  Harry asked, choking on the peanut he’d just tossed into his mouth.
“You’ll do no such thing!”
“So you’re a real catch, then?”  Harry’s smile is so fond that Draco wants to cry at the sight of it.
“But didn’t my Dad help win the war?”
“It should be no problem, but I’ve never tested the combination of these two potions.  They’re both harmless on their own, but one can never be sure how one potion will interact with another.”
“I’d expect nothing less, Slytherin,” Harry says, without bite.  “You coping okay?  Need anything?”
“Mmm, yeah, you’re probably right.  He had that bedroom voice and all.  Plus, I bet he was into right kinky stuff,” Harry mused.  “Right then.  Fuck Snape, marry Flitwick and kill Sprout.  Poor Professor Sprout.”
He stands in that spot, his memories of a younger, more hopeful self bright in his mind.  He remembers how he was relieved, that, if nothing else, it was going to be
“Snape came and woke me,” Draco says, his tone amused.  “I’m not sure if you’ve ever been woken by Severus, but even in portrait form, he’s a lot to deal with.”
“Do you have any concerns with the way that Gringotts has been managing your accounts?”
to the ways in which I am fucking this up.”
The parchment turns out to be a map, and Hermione and Draco study it, both of their heads bent over the table.  Hermione races back to her bag, and pulls out a battered book called “London AZ”.  Draco eyes it in confusion.  “It’s a street map,” Hermione explains, and she quickly flips through the pages.  “I’m nearly certain…”. She carefully examines a page, and refers back to the golden parchment, her eyes flicking back and forth between the two.  “Malfoy,” she says evenly, “do you care to explain why your son is at the Ministry of Magic?”
“Where do you want to go next?” Draco asked, once Scorpius’ broom had been wrapped up and they were again in the Alley.  Scorpius was dragging his mother in the direction of the Magical Menagerie, and Draco knew that they’d be there until his son’s fatigue ended the outing.
Harry instinctively stepped back, and Draco gaped at him for a moment.  “What are you doing here,” he finally asked.
ended.  “When?” Harry asks.
“Yes, you’re at Hedwig House in Cornwall.  It’s a long term care facility for those who are suffering from issues related to the mind.”
“Everyone for herself on the pitch,” she said, raising her eyebrow in a characteristic Malfoy gesture.
“What sort of discipline?”  I think I can imagine the answer, but I ask anyway
Scorpius’ eyes widened. “See Papa, I told you that Cici was a Vampire,” he said, but he obediently presented an arm, and Dean quickly spelled six vials full.   As he left the room, Healer Cici Clarke ducked around him as she entered it.  She was in her mid-forties, and Muggleborn, with long dark hair that she wore in a braid, and sparkling blue eyes.  When Scorpius had been referred to her, Draco was unsure about her objectivity (there were still Muggleborn shopkeepers in Diagon Alley that refused to serve them), but Cici had been a gift from the Gods.  With joint Muggle and Wizarding degrees, she was the most knowledgable specialist available, and Draco and Astoria trusted her explicitly.  More importantly, Scorpius adored her.
“What do you think that Papa saw in you?”
So I'm sorry.  Truly.  I swear though, if you've stuck with me this long, I really hope that you'll stick with me to the end, because this is a shitty place to abandon the story, and your trust will hopefully fully pay off.  But yeah.
Draco stood, placed his napkin on the table, and made his way into the family room, where Harry was tidying the soot from his daughter’s robes.
someone, but that didn’t mean he didn’t wish for it.
“Git.”
“Were you born into a magical family?”
But there he was, his wild hair surrounding that beloved face, a tiny hopeful smile on his lips.  Draco hadn’t bothered to dry his hair and a line of cold water dripped off the ends and down his back.  He shivered a little and simply stood there.  This was Harry’s mission, and Draco could only stand stupidly, waiting to see what happened next.
“Yes, well, we ended up having a screaming match in the middle of the Atrium.”
“No thank you.”
She continues, “The outbursts weren’t improving.  The Psychologist put you on a regimen of meditation and therapy.  The Ministry was getting panicky.  They needed you to be this vision of the future, to publicly be the calm, strong hero that people could trust, and privately, be able to point you at whatever they wanted destroyed.  They started to pressure me for results more quickly.”
“Of course.  Certainly you’ve heard of the Rotfang Conspiracy?”
“It concerns Draco Malfoy.”
Astoria was waiting for them in a wide, spacious family room.  “Harry,” she said warmly, kissing his cheek.  “Thank you for coming.”
“I’m irrevocably gay,” he’d said.  “I know that my parents insist upon an heir, and I’m willing to do my duty to the family, but I won’t lie to you and tell you that we’ll have a normal marriage.”
He was just about to step through the floo when Draco said, “Potter…”, but Harry couldn’t bear hearing whatever came next, so he simply continued through the floo and spun off within the flames.
“That was nice,” Hermione whispers in his ear, a little later.
“Do you regret it?”  The question was stark, and it took Harry aback for a moment.  It shouldn’t have, really.  He’d asked it enough of himself, when he was half-starved on the Horcrux hunt, or attending one of the endless funerals after the war, or when the press was lambasting him for what they saw as one of his transgressions.
sighs.  “Your Dad grew up without a family, and so he didn’t have the experience with the overwhelming sense of duty that comes along with one like mine.  It only stands to reason that you’d be the same.  Don’t get me wrong,” he said hastily, when it looked as though she were about to defend him.  “Your Dad is the most unfailingly loyal person I know.  This is different.  A family like mine is like a chain around your neck.  It keeps you tethered.  It keeps you secure and safe, yes, but when you’re raised as I am, the first lesson you learn is duty.  There is no pride in failing the family.  Through all my formative years, the responsibility of being a Malfoy was foremost.  It is…was, a difficult paradigm to overcome, especially in the midst of realizing how wrong my beliefs had been.”
“Is that how it makes you feel?” Draco’s voice is unexpectedly gentle.  Harry shrugs, then nods, then shrugs again.  “I bet that a lot of your friends would be surprised to hear that.”
“I love you too, you big monkey.”
“I’d help, but I’m the defence council at the same hearing,” Hermione said.
“Your mum asked me to come by,” Harry answered, still feeling panicky and detached from the throb of loss he’d felt, imagining how his life might have been.  “Draco, I’m so sorry.  I…Merlin, I can’t even count all the ways that I’ve fucked things up, but I really outdid myself at the press conference today.  Cass and I will keep a low profile, stay shut up in Hogwarts until the transplant, and then I’ll be out of your hair for good.”
“So,” Hermione starts.  She's wringing her hands and won't meet my eyes.  “The Psychologist and I worked together to bridge the gap between what we know about Magical theory and mind-healing and Muggle psychology.  It was easy to identify the trauma that you’d experienced, and how damaging that had been to your overall mental health.  It took longer to map that lifelong trauma to your magical outbursts.  We spent ages trying to figure out why it manifested when it did, and whether it could be resolved.  The Department Head supervised my work, and I had to report to Kingsley every month.  The entire Ministry was interested in understanding whether you presented any danger to society, and they certainly were interested in how they could use you as a weapon.”  She puts her head in her hands for a moment.  “That was where it all started to go wrong.  I started to, very carefully, downplay the situation.  I was trying to protect your privacy, and keep you from being locked up in somewhere.”
“But why didn’t I speak for the others?”
“Not necessarily,” Draco said, “but I can’t think of a single potion that could contain Ashwinder Eggs and provide a hallucinatory effect.  If the testing supports my theory, I think we can safely say that someone dosed Harry with a love potion.”
“You are?” Draco felt astonished and disappointed all in one go.  He hadn’t ever expected to have a chance with Harry, not since he had realized that his distain for Harry-bloody-Potter was a thinly-veiled front for a very different set of feelings.  Still, it was unpleasant to have the rug pulled out from under him, and he felt his face pull down into the blank expression that had kept him safe for most of his life.  “How nice for you.”
“You could,” Harry hedged.
The words hit Harry like arrows.  “Well, it’s old history now, I suppose.  There’s no sense in dredging it up.  I’d rather think about how we go forward.  I don’t suppose there’s any way to gain your forgiveness for what I did?”
Cass grinned at him.  “That’s a fancy name.”
“I don’t think that Dudley will be able to beat me up.”
“Mill, that’s…”
Harry bit his lip for a moment, and gathered his thoughts.  “When we were together, my love for you was all-consuming.  It was the definition of my life.  You were the sun, and the moon for me.”
“I’m fine.  You worry about you, okay?  Get strong and healthy, and enjoy getting to know your family, and think about what you’d most like for your birthday.”
“Do you think my mum raised Fred and George to adulthood without recognizing bruise salve?”
“Not in the slightest, Scorpius,” Draco replied.  “I do my best, and I try to make good choices.”
Ron and Hermione both are looking at me expectantly, and I realize that I’ve been off with the fairies a bit, contemplating my weird relationship with them.  It hardly seems prudent to admit that, so I do what comes naturally.  “Er, sorry.  Was thinking.”
“So you think that I should get them back?”
“If you keep interrupting me, you’ll never get to the good part,” I say, stalling for time, because I haven’t the faintest idea what to name the fictitious dog I’ve just invented.
“What on earth were you thinking?  I know you’re not a stupid man, Potter.  You somehow managed to defeat a Dark Lord.  You’ve raised a lovely child without her being eaten by a Hippogriff or something.  What could possibly have possessed you to assault a member of the press in front of
The great piss-ups continue each month, with an ever-rotating list of attendees.  Harry realizes, at one such occasion, as he sits across the table from Draco Malfoy and Greg Goyle, that
“I am.  Either help me, or leave me alone.”
“But, wouldn’t I have more privacy at Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunias?  They don’t even know that magic is real.”
“It’s your choice, of course, but I had to promise Pansy that I’d hide out in the Castle for the next few days.  If you were with Papa, you could go to Diagon Alley, spend some time with Scorpius.  Maybe he’d take you flying.”
“I don’t even know who my friends are right now,” I grumble.  “I’m not sure who to trust.”
Ron and Hermione left reluctantly about a half hour before the Malfoys were set to arrive.  Hermione promised to owl Harry with the name of a good PR rep, and Harry said he’d floo them later.
“Astoria, Draco, I know that we didn’t get the results that we were hoping for today, but please don’t lose hope.  I promise you that I will pursue every opportunity to help Scorpius get better.  I’m not giving up on him.”
I pass the letter over to Draco, who reads it while I do a terrible job of trying to clean Scorpius up.  A house elf pops into the room, gives me a pitying look, and takes him away, presumably to succeed where I have failed.  Draco holds the parchment for a long time, longer than it could possibly have taken him to read it.  Finally, without even a glance in my direction, he stands.  “Excuse me,” he says, and leaves the room.
most recent hit stuck in his head for the past three days, and his kitchen had taken violently against his coffeemaker again, but on the whole, things were good.  He had a job he loved, he had friends who truly cared about him, and nobody had made a credible attempt to take his life in over ten years.  Harry felt like he could finally say that he was in a good place.
“Ah, I see.  Does that mean that you feel tired a lot?”
“I do too, Draco.  Thank you for taking care of me and stuff.”
The next morning, the sun assaults them through the big window and Harry feels like he’s been trampled by Hippogriffs.  “My mouth tastes like owl shit,” he whispers to Hermione.
I have no idea how I would deal with a crying Millicent, so I just say, “Listen, old me would have gone into the Ministry, caused a fuss and gotten you your job back.  And then rode away on a Chimera or something.  I have no desire to do that, so just take some stupid money and let’s not ever talk about it again, okay?”
Draco felt his head tilt to one side.  “But you hated me.”
“Pansy.  I think I fucked up.”
“Did you win?” Draco asked.
“Are you sorry?”
“What do you want?” Harry asked, his interest evident in his whispered reply.
“At some point, Draco, you need to trust yourself.  I don’t for a moment believe that you harbour inappropriate sexual feelings for the five-year-old child in your care.  All of my reservations about you caring for him have been the impact that it would have on your recovery.  His safety has never, in my opinion, been at risk.  Let me put it to you this way…Have you ever wanted to hex Harry?  Either in school or since then?”
“Indeed,” Draco said, a little embarrassed.
love, they say,” Draco says contemplatively.  “I read somewhere that he was conceived under a love potion, and as a result, he couldn’t really feel complex emotions.”
“That is weird, mate.  It’s almost like you’ve been-”
“No need, Mrs. Weasley,” Harry says, and when she makes a little annoyed cluck with her tongue, amends, “Molly.  I’ve got some things to put away for you, I’ll put the kettle on when I’m doing that.”
His wariness was confirmed when Greg shrank away.  “Cass, let’s see if we can get some pumpkin juice.”  The two of them left, leaving Harry alone.
“I’ll explain that shortly.  Let me fill in some additional information, first.  My name is Miriam, and I’m your Healer.  You and I will work together to help you get well.  At first, we’ll focus on regaining your physical health, but I’m also here to assist you with regaining some emotional strength.”
“It’s not like that, Cass.  In the morning, I woke up with a cooler head, and I had changed my mind.  The lawsuit didn’t enter my mind again.  I focused on getting to know you, and making sure that Scorpius got better.  I didn’t even think to tell the solicitor to stop working on it, and I completely forgot what I had said until some time later, when Harry brought it up.  When he did, I told him that I had no intention of proceeding with it.”
When they said goodbye to his Mother, Harry hugged her without hesitation, and she placed a kiss on his forehead, her eyes warm as she looked over at Draco.  With a sense of impending doom, Draco took Harry through the floo, and they were home.
“When your Dad brought you back to England, I was very upset.  I was hurt that he’d left, and angry that he hadn’t told me about you.  The day that I saw you both at Hogwarts, I told him that I would sue him for full custody of you.”
“Bertram Higgs, yes.  He’s been working with Scorpius for a little over a year now.  I think you’ll like him.”
“Yes, she was.  She doesn’t see Scorpius, though.  She moved to Austria after he was born.  She’s not really the…maternal type.”
Harry smiled wider.  “Of course they would.  I haven’t told anyone that I’ve been in touch with you, not Luna, who’s taking care of Malcolm, or Ron or Hermione, but they trust me.  It’s been a long time, Draco.”
“Oi,” Scorpius said.  “I’ll always be the superior younger brother.”
Cici explained the testing, and what would happen if the children’s blood was compatible.  When she finished her explanation, Harry cleared his throat.  “Would I be able to ask a couple of questions?”
“Is it dangerous?” Weasley asked, the first thing he’d said since arriving. “What’s on Harry, anyway?”
“Oh no.  What do you mean, distress?  Why don’t I remember this?”
“You knew him,” Cass answered.  “Professor Snape.  He lives in our portrait, mostly.  He teaches me, and he’s Dad’s best friend.”
“That’s dumb.”
She isn’t ready to be touched, so Harry just stands there, as her breath comes fast and harsh.  Finally, she says, “It was over, Harry.  We won, and it was over, and we were going to get to move on.  We were going to stop
I sit for a moment, thinking over everything she’s said.  I believe that her motives were pure enough, but something niggles in the back of my mind.  “Did you tell me what Kingsley had planned, stripping my magic and using me as a puppet?  Did you give me a choice about the memory experiment?”
“Well, criminals don’t generally trouble themselves with informed consent.”
“Mmm,” I agree, placing a gentle kiss on the end of his nose.
member of the press in Great Britain?  What could have been a page 3 public interest story is now going to be talked about for months.  Months, Potter.”
“No.”  Harry placed a hand on her arm.  “He doesn’t.  I have a lot to answer for, in terms of not telling him about you sooner.  But I don’t need to justify the way that I’ve parented you.  Not to Draco, not to anyone.  Look at you, Cass!  You’re exceptional.  You’ve the best of Draco and I both, and I won’t argue about this.  Your Papa might choose to do things differently when you're with him.  That’s his right, as your parent.  But I won’t, for a single second, apologize for what a miracle that you are.”
It hurts him, Draco notes.  He watches the light disappear from Potter’s incredible eyes, and his jaw tighten, and his shoulders hunch a little.  “Oh,” Potter says quietly.  “I didn’t realize.”
She laughs.  “You’re entirely too trusting.”
“What do I get for being right?”
“I’m glad you didn’t change the name,” Draco said.  “Ollivander’s is a bit of a fixture here.”
“Well, we don’t have to decide right now.  How about this…you have a birthday in a week.  We’ll stay until then, and we can decide what our plans are after that.”
It’s incomprehensible to me.  As fond as I am of Draco, I couldn’t imagine making a sacrifice like that for him.  Maybe it’s different with someone’s child.
It didn’t take long for Draco to shower, dress, and brew a strong espresso, which he carried with him to the sunny room where his yoga mat had pride of place.  He sat crosslegged on the mat, and was about to set his wand to count down the ten minutes, when he stopped.  Feeling a little shaky, he set his wand down, and started to breathe.  He was midway through his twentieth exhalation, when the anxiety became too much.  Opening his eyes, he set his wand for nine minutes, twenty seconds, and resumed his practice.  When the wand buzzed again, he summoned his journal, and noted the occurrence.  It wasn’t success, but it was an attempt, and it would give him something to discuss with Lara on Wednesday, anyway.
Harry beamed, and then Draco’s mouth, free of any intervention from his brain, said, “Well, of course she is.  She was raised by someone who didn’t know what it was like to be a child.”  The chorus of gasps around the table was Draco’s first indication that he hadn’t expressed himself well.  He cringed, unsure how to recover from his faux pas.  Harry’s childhood was very firmly not spoken of.  It had taken many nights when they were together, complete with vast quantities of Fire Whiskey, and full body snuggling on Draco’s part to pry the story from a tearful Harry.  Draco had merely been remarking upon Harry’s unique parenting style, that of raising a self-confident young woman, but clearly he’d phrased it badly, as a criticism.
“No!” Hermione’s voice was shrill.  “No,” she amended, more calmly, “let’s see how you and I do first.  Ronald, could you keep Harry entertained?  Maybe he could use a bath after he’s done eating.”
“Despite my limited understanding of my history, I can’t imagine why you’d think that.”
“You’re okay,” he said mildly.  “You’ve come a long way.  Do you have something more you need to say to me?”  It was killing him to be this calm and detached.  He took another long swallow from the bottle.
“Really?”
“I’m just saying that you’re a bit…emotional, Harry, and it would be wrong of you to let some schoolboy grudge break apart a family.”
“So if we were to, say, take Pansy’s story to the press…”
“Yes, little duck, Scorpius is fine, and you’re awake, and even though I’m sure you took years off our lives with how worried we were, your Papa and I are awake too.  It’s okay.”  As Draco squinted through the gloom, he could see Harry frantically stroking her face.
“Thanks, Hannah,” I say. “You’re lovely, you are.” I lie my head down on the bar.  “Just going to have a little nap while I wait for Draco.”
“That doesn’t seem right either.  What the fuck is wrong with this place?”  I’m starting to get upset, and I can feel my magic rolling off me in irritated waves.  “Why the fuck did I bother winning a war?”
“No, I’ll firecall Blaise in a moment.”  As Harry starts to leave, Draco says, “I’m glad you’re here.”
“Not at all,” he argues, but his face says
I shrugged.  “I just don’t see it.”
As I leave the bank, a spring in my step, I recall that my closet is woefully unprepared to woo someone as fancy as Draco.  Fortunately, the salesgirl at Twilfitt and Tattings delightedly assures me that she can help me out.
Narcissa gasped for breath, the effort of speaking taking its toll on her.   As her breaths quieted, she finally said, “Since your Father has gone, I’ve been able to reflect on what meaning I wish to have from my life.  You are my legacy, darling.  I want you to have the life you deserved.  You’ve paid your penance, Draco.  You deserve what you want.  You have my blessing, should you find a way to work it out with Harry.”
“Oh, Christ, Draco, I really am terrible at this, but in my defence, I don’t have a lot of experience with…well, anything, I suppose.  Look, can we just pay the bill, and then take a walk somewhere, where I can just talk to you?  I don’t want to embarrass you, and I am clearly saying the wrong things in front of these horse-people.”
“You could pay any curse breaker.  Why me?”
“Unspeakable, of course you know that I can’t share any knowledge of what I’m working on.  Particularly not in front of civilians.  It’s most inappropriate.”
As he stood and kissed her upturned cheek, she gripped his arm, stood, and then pulled him into a hug.  Save Molly Weasley, Harry hadn’t really felt the touch of a mother.  For a split second, he allowed himself to imagine that things had been different.  That he and Draco had been together, properly together, and that this was his Mother-in-law.  The sensation of loss was so great, that it was all Harry could do to endure the embrace.  When she pulled away, he gave her a weak smile, and headed directly to the floo, unable to wait for a house elf to lead him.  He was just reaching for the dish of floo powder, when the flames blazed green and Draco stepped out.
“I joined a local league,” she supplied, after a moment, during which Draco’s stomach churned.
“It’s Harry Potter.”
“Do you think you should?”
“Where did it go?” Ron said, frowning.
Because, it’s clear, I’m a member of this family, if a foundling one.  The second I stepped through the floo, the matriarch, who keeps insisting that I call her Molly, enfolded me in a hug that just dripped with love.  She squeezed hard, as though trying to keep me from pulling away, and I felt so
felt like that, it explained a lot about why coming home would be hard for him.  Suddenly, she realized, that although her Dad didn’t have Family, that didn’t mean that he didn’t have
Her words hurt Draco terribly.  He tried to keep his voice still and even, but he could tell that it sounded young, fragile.  “Well, Aunt, I appreciate your opinions.  How kind of you to look out for your family.”  He did everything he could to infuse a sneer into the statement, but it fell flat.
“Of course not.  Let me just go tell Cass what the plans are.”
“Bullistrode,” Hermione says evenly, and it’s the closest I’ve seen to her being rude.
With a bark of laughter, Ron said, “Harry hates everyone right now.  He hexed me yesterday when I told him to get his smelly socks off the coffee table.  He’s a monster.  That’s what happens when you’re fifteen.  Honestly, I wish you’d take him back.”
“I work for the DMCA.  I’m an integration specialist.  Normally, I go ‘round telling little First-Gen wixes about Magic, and help prepare them for Hogwarts.  Sometimes, with kids like Scorpius, I help with frequent magical outbursts.”
As I sit in my flat, feeling a bit sorry for myself, I resolve to go out, get blinding drunk, and sleep with the hottest man I can find.  I war with the ennui that comes of being so disappointed and the motivation to lash out and hurt the one who hurt me.  It’s a fool’s game, though.  Draco obviously doesn’t care if I sleep with someone else, and he’s the only one I want.  A knock at the door interrupts my brisk bout of staring out the window, and as I stumble to the door, I’m surprised that it’s already getting dark.  It seems that I’d spent a lot more time than I expected, lost in my thoughts.
“Yes, of course you may,” Cici said.  Draco helped his son down from the cot, and kissed him on top of his silky white-blond head.  Scorpius rolled his eyes at Draco, and bounced out of the room, making dragon noises as he went.
Harry’s eager to comply, his beautiful, talented mouth licking and sucking his way down Draco’s torso until his mouth is on Draco’s cock, engulfing it completely, his wicked tongue causing Draco’s breath to catch in his throat.  Harry’s fingers are caressing his balls, and he’s wordlessly conjuring a handful of lube.  As Harry’s finger penetrates Draco’s hole, Draco whimpers.  “Yes, Harry.  More.”
“I expect another half hour at most,” Cici said.  “They did very well, we’ll know that Scorpius is accepting the donor marrow by tonight.”
“Oh god.  Oh no.  Poor little duck.  Is…is she upset?  Can I go to her?  I need to make it better!”
“I don’t know if I can do it,” Harry confesses.  “I’m so unsettled.  I don’t want to risk causing a scene.”
Harry doesn’t say anything, because there’s no suitable response to a situation like this.  He clings tighter, gently running his hands along the plane of a thigh, the shell of an ear.  Memorizing body parts that he already knows better than his own.
“Please, dear, sit.  Would you like tea?”
“Every time?”
“My name is Scorpius Amicus Greengrass-Malfoy.  It’s nice to meet you, Mrs. Nott.” he replied.  Draco tensed.  The Malfoy name had recovered some since their disgrace, but Draco still feared that someone would shun his child for the misdeeds of his ancestors.  The Notts hadn’t been convicted as Death Eaters, but they were Slytherins, he remembered, his mental calculus suggesting that this could go in any direction.
It wasn't right, what Harry had done.  But Draco couldn't honestly say that he would have done anything differently.  He didn't forgive Harry, he concluded.  But he thought he might understand, at least a little.  After all, Draco's reasons for breaking up with Harry were little different than Harry's reasons for leaving.
Harry,
“Do you want to sleep here?”  As he said the words, Harry seemed to freeze, as though he regretted them.
“Please, Papa, Mr. Harry is my friend, and my dragon likes him.  Please?  Please Mr. Harry?”
“That’s what I’ve been standing here trying to sort out,” Harry answered.  “Draco, you know I’m crap at expressing myself, right?”  When Draco nodded stiffly, he continued, “Well, I can’t figure out if I just did a bad job of telling you how I feel, or if you did understand, and you’re angry with me.  Draco, would you look at me for a second?”
“No hits.  We don’t hit anyone here, Harry.  Nobody is going to hurt you here.  And if you get scared about something, it’s okay to ask.  You’re safe.  I don’t make promises easily, Harry, but I promise I’ll keep you safe.”  Harry considered this, but continued to watch Draco warily.  “I’d really like some company while I eat my lunch.  Do you think you could show me how well you eat?  Do you think you could eat two chicken nuggets?”  Harry finally nodded, and awkwardly climbed into the chair again.  He eyed his plate skeptically, and looked to Draco, but when Draco simply took his knife and fork and started to eat, he carefully reached out and took a chip.  He examined it for a long time, and watched Draco some more.  “It’s good.  I’d like you to try it,” Draco said conversationally.  When Harry finally started eating, Draco considered it a victory, even if one tiny hand gripped the edge of the plate as though afraid someone would snatch it away.
“I’m sure, Papa.  I’ll explode.”
“Harry, please.  Can we go to your place?  To talk?”  I’m about to say no, but I hesitate.  I’ve been watching for an owl from him for days, even as I was telling myself I didn’t care.  He isn’t looking at me; his feet are obviously fascinating.  He looks vulnerable.  There’s no future for us, but I wonder if there will be some sort of satisfaction in confronting him.  I just want to know why he thought it was okay.  Did he think that I’m the sort of person who’d enjoy being a bit on the side?  Even though I’m a bit nervous about being alone with him, I finally nod, but he’s still not looking at me.
he chided himself.  Even as he accepted that he'd been foolish to make such a rash decision, he wondered what the cost would have been, sharing Cass with Draco.  Harry always cared too much.  It would have hurt him awfully to feel that he was on the fringes of a family.  But Cass…Harry mourned the easy security that Cass might have had if she’d known two stable parents, who both loved her and put her first.  He'd ruined everything.  His thoughts whirled.  He knew, deep down, that he should have done the adult thing, for Cass' sake.  For Draco's sake.  But how could he have managed, being so close to Draco, being forced to pretend that he was satisfied, going home to his lonely bed, being reminded that he hadn't been enough for Draco?
“Potter.  This child is a perfect combination of you and Draco.”
Draco had stroked his cheek, just once and said, “I don’t think you’re stupid, and I find it really freeing that you don’t insist on obeying every single Pureblooded social convention.  I pick at you because I’m a stuffy spoiled control freak and sometimes I’m terrified that you’ll realize that I’m not good enough for you.”  And, just like that, Harry had been in love.
“Anyway,” I say, not all that interested in deconstructing my life with anyone, even people I’m pretty sure I love, “if I get my memory back, and realize I’ve made a huge mistake, Ginny and I can talk.  If she’s been unhappy, then clearly there was some stuff we needed to work through.”
Snape’s painted forehead creases for a moment and he regards Harry.  “So you have grown up.  I’m impressed, Mister Potter.”
“You met me, as far as you remember, a short time ago.  And you see me as you do, and accept me, and I’m so happy about that.  It’s just that, I still have all of this unresolved history with you.  It makes me feel as though I’m cheating, somehow.  Like, if you got your memory back tomorrow, you’d be horrified, and feel like I’ve tricked you into being with me.”
“Mr. Harry is right,” Malfoy said, an expression on his face that Harry attributed to his discomfort with agreeing with Harry Potter.  “All of that can be addressed later.  For now, I want you to rest comfortably.”
Harry looked dubious.  “I…”  He looked at Draco, and said, “Would you take me to your house?”
The tears spill over and she reaches a hand toward me, but I step backwards.  I watch her in silence, until her head falls in disappointment, and she walks slowly to the floo.  She looks at me, just before she throws the powder, her face awash with tears, but I just watch her, expressionless, until she disappears in a flourish of green flames.
“Malfoy, actually,” Draco replied, stiffening a little, as though he was anticipating John’s reaction.
“Mommy will never let me have two.”
The queue is lengthening behind us, but Louise ignores them.  “That’s awful!  What are you going to do?”
“Harry, we don’t know exactly.  She might wake up in ten minutes.  She might sleep longer.”
Harry had sat under the tree next to the lake, the place where he, Ron and Hermione had studied, and gossiped and laughed.  He wanted them now, but if he told Hermione, she would insist that he tell Draco.  Maybe she’d insist that he give him the baby outright.  Hermione had always seemed to know what was best, and she wasn’t shy on giving him advice, something he normally appreciated.  But Harry knew that he wanted this baby, and all of his insecurities had screamed at him that Hermione would tell him that he wasn’t capable of being her father.
I shrug.  “I don’t think you’ll steer me wrong.  Either way, I put myself entirely at your mercy.”
Harry’s own shoulders stiffened at the words, ‘you people’.  It reminded him too much of his Aunt Petunia.  “You could,” he said quietly, not mentioning that, now that they had Violet’s magical signature, they could find her, no matter where she went.  “Violet would still be a little girl who had magical abilities, though.  And she’d be in a place where she didn’t get any support or education on how to use her gifts.”
Draco looks like he has a lot more to say on the topic, but a house elf pops into the breakfast room and announces that Luna has arrived.
“So, any nosebleeds lately?”  Scorpius nodded.  “Do you feel more or less tired than usual?”  Scorpius shrugged.  “When you’re playing with your friends, do you sometimes feel out of breath?”  Another nod.  “Okay, thanks for telling me that, Scorpius. Do you mind if I ask Mama and Papa some questions?”  When Scorpius shook his head, she turned her attention to Draco.  “Can I see his journal?”  Wordlessly, he passed it over.  After his diagnosis, Draco had begun to keep meticulous notes on Scorpius’ day to day occurrences…his energy levels, any illnesses, or new bruises.  As the primary caregiver, it helped him keep Astoria up to date, and made conversations with Cici more valuable as well.  “Lovely, thanks for that.  I’m just going to pop along and see after Scorpius’ blood samples.  Back in a tick.”
“But why me?  We hated each other.”
“I don’t know.  Uncle Professor just says, ‘it’s complicated’.  If you want to know, you should ask Dad.”
“And the potion smuggler cast some sort of hex on him.  He was found unconscious and taken to Mungo’s.  When he woke up, he didn’t have a clue what was going on.”
“Draco-”  She puts a hand on his arm, and he shakes it off.
“I don’t care about that.  I just want Cass’ privacy protected, and Draco’s.”
together.  I just want to know what’s happened.
“Your dad doesn’t do anything by half,” Hermione said, looking on in awe.
Draco stared.  Since his compulsions had started, in the horrid seventh year at Hogwarts, those who were victims to his time-consuming rituals had reacted with varying levels of impatience.  Pansy had initially laughed at him, and then had increasingly flounced from the room when the rituals had started to interfere with everything.  Goyle had been slightly better, but even he kept his distance when Draco was in mid-ritual.  Blaise had acted as though they didn’t happen at all.  His Mother had been initially concerned, and then had taken a page from Blaise’s spellbook.
“You could fool me.”
“Merlin, Potter, I hope you’re not this trusting of everyone.  Can I do so now?”  I shrug again, and he positions me in one of the big armchairs, kneeling in front of me so that our eyes are level.  “Legilimens,” he intones.  His eyes are locked on mine, and they’re so pretty, and his position, kneeling in front of me, causes me to imagine those red lips put to use.
“Good morning, Cass.  Potter.”
“And the fact is that the reason they’ve been able to do it all is because they've used secrecy, blackmail, and vague laws that people don’t understand.  So what if we remove the secrecy?”
“Okay.”
“I don’t think it’s fine.  Harry,” Draco’s voice is so serious, so tender, that it startles Harry into looking over.  He doesn’t think he’s ever seen him look so sad.  “Has anyone ever taken care of you?”
“No.  It isn’t.  But you and I have been together a long time.  When we first got together, in school, you were never interested in anything physical.  I thought that you were just immature, or maybe just stressed because of the war.  But then,” she says, and she’s playing with her hair again, “afterwards, when we got back together, you still didn’t want to.  I have to be the instigator, every time.”
She looks at me with pity, and I hate it.  “Can you call Malfoy?” I finally ask.
His smile grows, and two tiny circles of pink appear on his cheekbones.
“I will.  Not today, but I promise.”
“Harry, dear, if I had a galleon for every time Draco left the breakfast table in a temper,” Narcissa said with a laugh.  “And every time, he was just waiting for someone to come after him and tell him that it was alright.  She’s reaching a difficult age, and her emotions are likely to surface more frequently.  She’s upstairs, by herself, struggling with, if my guess is correct, anger, and guilt, and embarrassment at being caught out.  She needs her dad.”
“Okay,” Harry said.  “It’s fine.  I wasn’t kidding about having to go back and settle some things.  We left in a bit of a hurry, and I need to make sure the house is still standing and find someone to take care of it, finish a few wands that I’ve promised to clients.  Would you be willing to be here on your own for a little bit?”
“They’d be foolish if they didn’t want to see you.”
“Of course,” Draco said, and then, worriedly, “is Harry alright?”
“Well, perhaps some of the less savoury elements of her other father’s past?”
“I don’t understand how I got here, but I was wondering if I had my laptop with me?  If it’s been a week, I think that I’ve neglected to send my daughter an email, and I don’t want her to worry.”
To those of you who thought that Harry was a massive pushover who just needed to STAND UP FOR HIMSELF FOR ONCE IN HIS DAMNED LIFE, I hope that he manages to do just that for you.
He does, and I suck him off under the stream of hot water, and he lingers at the doorway of the bathroom to kiss me.  “Lunch tomorrow?”
“It’s done nothing but get me hurt, though.  It makes me emotional, prone to overreact.”
“It means that my blood works funny, and so I get sick sometimes, and tired.  And I have to take potions.”
“Darling, don’t you want to stay home with Mama?”
Molly looks at him as though startled to see him.  “Oh yes, dear, of course.”  She continues sitting, staring into the flames.  Harry gives Ron a look.
“Potter was becoming increasingly unstable.  He was a danger, but had great potential to serve the Ministry.”
Defeated, Draco climbed the stairs, and found Kreacher and Harry in the kitchen.  Kreacher was happily preparing food and chattering away in his gravelly voice.  Harry was babbling back to Kreacher, his voice resembling a dolphin.  None of these things were unexpected, but Draco was truly surprised to hear a third voice.  “Good evening, my Dragon.  Perhaps you might like to tell me why you have a baby who looks remarkably like Harry Potter in your kitchen?”
“I don’t know.  Life my life, I suppose.  A real one, if I can manage it, one that’s not hidden away behind wards.”
“Pansy  Parkinson?”  Mill nods. Hermione looks at me strangely.  “You want me to help Pansy Parkinson?”
“Merlin, Hermione, give everyone else a chance, would you?”  Hermione laughed and moved inside.  Harry stepped back to let Ron and his parents in.  Ron looked at him appraisingly, and said, “You’re still a shortarse, Harry, but you’re a sight for sore eyes.”  He gave Harry and equally bone-crushing hug, and whispered into his ear, “I know you had your reasons, mate, but I missed you.”
“Then let’s go,” I say.
“It does happen,” Ron said mildly, smirking at him.  How had Draco gotten here with this room full of people, just…accepting him?  With a pleased little smile, he turned his attention back to the telly.
“And will I meet Grand-Père?”
Scorpius’ long eyelashes fluttered, and he started to cry.  “My Papa,” he sniffled.
“Yes, Scorpius?”
Cass was reading when he entered their chambers.  She looked up from her book, her curls a mess and her eyes looking sleepy.  “What did Grand-Mère want?”
Relieved, that is, until we arrive back at theirs, and Ron turns on me the second Rose is encouraged to go play in her room.  “What happened?” He demands.
“It’s different, I’m sure.  Obviously, I never attended a Muggle school, but a tutor will work with you on subjects that interest you, tailor the learning to what you want to focus on.  Of course, he’ll make sure that you have the fundamentals covered, language, arithmancy, that sort of thing, but Bertram would be qualified to instruct on anything from Pureblood magical rituals to Defense.”
“Dead?  No, Harry, no.”
“I’ll miss you, but not too much. I want you to get to know your Papa.  You have a lot of his mannerisms, you know.  You need some time to get to know him.”
At the same time he said that, Cass was saying, “Just as long as I don’t sort Hufflepuff.”  They laughed, and Draco tentatively put a hand on her shoulder.  She looked up at him with one of Harry’s guileless, happy smiles, and Draco’s heart clenched.
Ron looks a bit chastened at that, and again, I’m pleased that my instincts are, again, serving me well.  “I got the impression that we’ve stayed together because it was expected of us.  Ginny couldn’t really produce any compelling reasons other than a mutual affection for Quidditch and a first-year crush. Then I asked her if she’d ever suspected I might not be into women, and she seemed relieved that I’d figured it out.”
“They weren’t crimes.  They were an act of mercy.”
“They’re a lot alike,” Harry said.  “I’m glad.  They deserve this.”
“See?  That’s the sort of job I should have.  Something a bit fun.”  I feel restless.  “Hey, let’s go to Diagon.  Also, why would I remember Diagon, but not the Ministry?  Why don’t I remember Hogwarts?”
“Kingsley knows I’m handling the problem.  He doesn’t trouble himself with the trifling details.  Plausible deniability and all. But rest assured, if the Ministry is turning a blind eye to Department of Probation and Rehabilitation, they won’t be any quicker to step in on the good work I’m doing.”
“Three weeks?  If you don’t take it, we’ll have to find someone else who’s suitable, and time isn’t on our side.  But Harry, there’s
“Rarer,” Cici said.  “Please don’t panic, just yet.  Let’s just see how the afternoon goes.  She may wake up at any time.”
Harry’s cheeks flamed, and he seemed a little overwhelmed.  “What first?” Draco asked.  “We could have tea, or I could show you around inside, or we could look at the gardens.”
“What do you mean?”
“It’s late, and I didn’t mean to intrude.”
“No,” said Harry immediately.  Draco nodded, and returned to watching the sparrows.  It didn’t take long for Harry to say, “Gin’s mad, you know.”
Her face falls.  “I understand.”
She tilts her head and looks at me appraisingly.  “I suppose you don’t, for all that.”
“So we just need to figure out how gradually,” Draco concluded.
“You don’t make the,” Harry’s voice dropped to a whisper, “elves do them?”
“I didn’t mean to make her cry.”
The hawk has gone as well, and the stillness and peace outside are at odds with my tumbling thoughts.  Why should I be burdened with my past?  What could possibly be worth it?  I’m content now, with Draco, and free of the responsibilities that old Harry had.  Why would I be so foolish as to risk that?  And for what?  A few moments of happiness, memories of people who are long-dead and can’t bring me any joy?
“Off with you,” she waved a hand impatiently.  “I’d like to know exactly what you’re feeding my Goddaughter.  She’s so tall!”
“Kreacher thinks he hears an owl,” the elf said quickly, and with a snap of his fingers, disappeared from the room.
Draco felt his heart stutter.  “I…I didn’t…” he stammered for a moment, feeling completely wrong footed.  “I don’t understand.”
“Well, it’s okay.  No apologies necessary.  I have to go now, though.”
He remembered the first few days after Cass was born.  Poppy Pomphrey had been his healer, the only medical professional Harry trusted, and she and Minerva had stayed with Harry until his incisions had healed and he’d caught up a little on sleep.  They’d wanted to stay longer, but Harry knew they had responsibilities at Hogwarts, and he felt he needed to prove he could do it on his own.
Draco sighed.  It felt like this conversation was nothing
“Alright.  I’d rather fuck you anyway.”
“Draco, I’m fine, don’t fuss.”  Draco settled him down with a tea tray by the fire, and raced upstairs.  Under the punishing needles of the showerhead, he tried to figure out just what the fuck had happened there.  Ten minutes later, he was no closer to an answer, so he turned off the taps, spelled himself dry and dressed.
Two days later, I’m surprised to see Luna sitting at the breakfast table.  I hadn’t heard Draco get up, and from the looks of them, they’ve been there a while.  Luna smiles brightly at me.  “Hello, Harry.”
“And Robards is…”
Abruptly, many things changed again.  There were a lot more voices and grabby hands, and he was ripped from Safe and it was bright, and loud, and the opposite of what he needed.  Harry was screaming, and screaming was Not Allowed, and Harry had to Focus.  He had to Focus, and he had to Get It Together.  He wasn’t Getting It Together, though, and he wasn’t Focusing, and then the grabby hands were lifting him, and he heard the familiar voice again, and then it was getting Darker, but it wasn’t Darkness, it was different, and then he didn’t know anything at all.
Unsure whether it was the right thing to do, but deciding to take a risk, Draco reached for Harry’s hand.  He looked startled, and his wide green eyes met Draco’s, but he didn’t pull away.
Cass shrugged.  “I’m sad for you both.  I wish that things had been different, but if they were, you wouldn’t have Scorpius and Astoria.”
“I do not!”
“Pity,” she says.  “Did you give him the biscuits I made him?”
Hello my lovelies!  Thank you for the kind comments on the last chapter, and for sticking with me, week after week as I posted this angst-fest.  This is the last chapter, with a short epilogue to follow next week.  I've loved writing this story, and I've especially loved talking some of you down from the ledge as you navigated the complicated twists and turns of two damaged men who did crappy things to one another, but were still, ultimately, deserving of a happy ending.
He was surprised when he heard a familiar, abeit weakened, voice saying, “Well, Mister Potter, I did not expect to see you here again.”
“Her admission papers didn’t mention that anyone in the family has had a reaction to this potion.  How have you reacted to it?”
“I was right, though, wasn’t I?  The worst thing Harry’s done since he lost his memory was shag you!”
“Oh, okay.”  Ginny thinks for a moment.  “Well, we both like Quidditch.  And I’ve had a crush on you since first year at Hogwarts.  And you’re quite handsome,” she says, and I raise my eyebrow at her.  That’s it?  That’s all she can come up with? “Yeah, alright, you put me on the spot,” she mutters.  “It’s hard to quantify, Harry, we’ve been together a long time.”
“I know that you and Ron were right by my side, fighting Voldemort, but I don’t think I’m completely incapable of taking care of myself.”
He looks as though he’s about to tell me something more, but Pansy makes a strangled noise, and they exchange a conversation conducted entirely through glares.  He sinks his head into his hands.
“Well who?  One of the Weasleys?”
“Yeah.”  I bite my lip.  Pansy’s abrupt release just makes things seem even more suspicious.  But, Draco asked me not to intervene, and Pansy’s out anyways, and even though I’m not certain that Hermione will manage to go a day, let alone the rest of our lives, without bossing me, maybe this is one of those things that a smart man would leave be.
“Yeah.  Through a bunch of circumstances, I ended up with Draco’s wand during the war.  Afterwards, I gave it back, but wands are funny, you know?  They have strange loyalties, and Draco’s wand never worked properly for him afterwards.  It would do basic spells, but as your Papa started doing more complicated magic, it was letting him down.  I dunno.  Garrick said that it was because Draco was a different person after the war.  At any rate, that’s how he ended up in Ollivander’s one day. I was still early on in my apprenticeship, but Garrick had me help Draco find his new wand.”
“You’re an idiot,” Cass said flatly.  “You tell yourself that because it’s easier.  Don’t you understand?  He has nobody now!”
When Minerva arrived at his doorstep the following morning, having been summoned from Hogwarts by a concerned Snape, he sobbed.  “I can’t do it,” he wept.  “Can you take her?  Give her to someone who can do this properly?”  She’d sent him to bed, and, when he’d awoken four hours later, patiently helped him get Cass on a proper sleep schedule.  It had gotten better, but he still remembered the feeling of being utterly alone, with no clue how to cope.  It had taken him years to stop doubting whether he was capable of being Cass’ dad.
Harry was suddenly reminded of a time, long ago when Mrs. Figg had been busy, and the Dursley’s couldn’t find anyone to watch Harry while they went to church, so he’d been dragged along, and warned of certain death if he didn’t behave.  It had all gone fine until he’d sneezed.  The way that Vernon and Petunia had whipped their heads around in unison and glared at him had struck him as so unexpectedly funny, that, despite the impending punishment, he’d gotten a fit of the giggles.  As their expressions grew increasingly furious, he’d giggled harder, until tears were rolling down his face, and he was frantically biting the inside of his cheek to try to stop.  The beating and subsequent week-long exile into his cupboard had been a trial, but since then, Harry had always had a hard time suppressing giggles when in tense situations.
“There’s a ritual I read about.  It’s very old.  Dark Magic.  Blood magic.”
.  There were no potions smugglers, no unnamed suspect who eluded capture.  And Hermione knew about it, maybe planned the whole thing.
“A dog?  No, I don’t," Draco answered, a little mystified at where the conversation was going.
“But don’t you want people to make it right?”  Having replaced his glasses, Harry could see that there was a deep furrow of confusion between Draco’s golden eyebrows.
Draco’s legendary poise has returned, and a grimace that nearly passes for a smile crosses his face.  “You’re unlikely to be any help at all with planning a Pureblood funeral,” he says wryly.
I feel a twinge of disappointment.  Draco has responsibilities.  He has a son.  He has to go.  “Shower with me first?”
“You never said.”
Draco
Ron was saying, “…tea later, Mum, we just need to go check on something beyond the orchard.”
The Dark Mark, less dark these days, still stood starkly against the pale skin of his left wrist.  He’d once thought of trying to remove it, to shear off the skin, or to brew a potion that would bleach it away.  Instead, he’d left it, a constant reminder of his inability to tell right from wrong, a brand that told everyone that he was someone who allowed others to be hurt.
“Draco Malfoy, don’t you dare start that shit again,” Astoria said fiercely.  “I know what you’re thinking right now, and I won’t let you.  This isn’t your fault, you’re not being punished, and our baby is not going to die.”
“Am, I suppose.  But probably less so, since I don’t remember anything.  I mean it though, how did I even
Draco snorted.  “What, you think I’d throw my chances at playing away because I couldn’t play on a green and silver team?  I just wanted to join a team at this level.  I wouldn’t care if they made us play in lion costumes.”
“Yes, that’s him.  And then there’s Rose and Hugo Granger-Weasley.  She’s six, and he’s three.”  Harry carefully watched Draco’s face, and was satisfied that his expression didn’t change at the surnames.  “And then there’s Violet Powers.  She’s seven.  Muggleborn, just learned about magic a few weeks ago.  I think she’d be a brilliant friend for Scorpius.”
“But how can I help him?  If I wanted to, I mean.”
“It’s as if the magic is too much for them.”  She got up, paced the lab a moment, and then said, “Draco, do you suppose that the quantities are just too much too soon?”
“I don’t know,” I snap.  “It’s like I
“I know, Harry.  Minerva’s right, you know.  No one will judge you if you decide to ignore this information.”
“It mattered.  It was everything.”
“Well, it’s just weirdly convenient.  Anonymous tip, the wards kick everyone but me out, I remember oddly specific things.  What if I’d figured something out?  About the Slytherins, and the probation.”
wanted him.  Draco hasn’t acted like a cruel little twat since he was a lot younger, but as he hits his breaking point, he reverts to old habits.
“No, they don’t.  I guess I’m tired of apologizing for how I am.  I had the most evil man I’ve ever met living in my head for my childhood, using every emotion I had against me.  It isn’t so simple for me to change how I am, just for them to accept me.  I love my friends, and I miss everyone when I’m away, but I’ve been alone before.”
“I don’t know.”
“Replace it.  Replace anything I damaged.  Release a statement that condemns the reporter’s inflammatory comments, but apologizes for my behaviour.  Will I have to serve jail time?”
“Listen, Weasley, I’m getting the impression that Potter’s not interested in going along with you, so maybe you could let us get back to what we were doing.”  I can hear his voice more clearly, now that we’re out of the club, and it’s a bit plummy.  Rich
The pensieve is an enormous basin, made of ancient-looking stone.  There are carved snakes along the outside, and it sits on a stand of weathered copper.  It’s in a room I’ve never been in before, and the stone walls dim the flickering torches.  I lift the vial, and admire the silvery strands within.  “Ready?”  Draco’s hand is a bit clammy as he takes mine.
He must have fallen asleep, because the next time he’s aware of anything, it’s warm, and sunny, and someone’s talking to him.  For a moment, he is hopeful that it’s Draco, but the voice is wrong, a tenor instead of a baritone.  Ron.  He squints up and Ron’s face is a solar eclipse, his red hair a flare of brightness.  He’s still talking, but Harry doesn’t really know what he’s saying.  The voice sounds kindly enough, though, so at least he’s not in trouble.  Ron is holding out his hand, and Harry blinks at it stupidly, unsure what to do with it.
“Even if he doesn’t want me anymore,” she whispered, and a fresh storm of sobs took over.  She’d tried not to think it, and certainly hadn’t said it, but admitting that her Dad had so easily left her with a near-stranger hurt more than she could say.
“Oh my,” Mrs. Fortescue says.  “That’s very generous of you.”
“Excellent.  Draco, to begin with, I want to thank you for joining us today.  It can be very helpful for those who are close to us to join in our sessions from time to time.  I’m sure that Harry appreciates your support.”
I wonder again what foolish, hero Harry Potter would have done.  By every indication, I would never have let this baby Death Eaters thing go.  I would have had an enormous fight with Draco about it, and then I would have made Mill uncomfortable by all of the publicity over her sacking.  I can’t say that what I’m doing now is better…it’s certainly not helping people like Pansy Parkinson, but I don’t even remember her.  Why should I lose things in my life, things I like, for the sake of people I don’t even know?
The food is excellent, and as I’m looking around at the open friendly faces, I think I’m starting to understand why old me might have been reluctant to open up about my sexuality.  Ron and Hermione have told me, in brief, that I don’t have parents, that they died when I was small.  It’s quite a long story, they assure me, and, given their faces when they said that, I expect that it will be a treat, once we find the time.  They’ve also told me some alarming things about my Muggle relatives, and something about bars on a window and a daring nighttime rescue in a flying Anglia.  So I don’t have anyone, really, not proper family.  No doubt that’s been tough on me, and if I was worried that their acceptance was conditional upon my marrying their only girl, maybe the lie would be worth it.
“I know, okay?  He’s alive, and he’s going to live, and be fine.  I know that.  But just give me one fucking second,” he says, sounding furious, “to mourn that he’ll never be able to have a child of his own.”
“Ah, I see.  So you have no desire to see him again?”
“I see it, Score,” Cass said, giving her brother a tight hug.
“Not yet.  Any minute now, I’m sure.”
“Yech, what’s that whiff?” Weasley asked, when Draco had opened the floo for him.
“I know.  It sucks to have choice taken away from you.  But you choose what happens in the next six weeks, Draco.  If you want to come to me, I’m here.  I will welcome you into my bed, and I will love you.  If you want to go now, and never see me again, I will accept that, and wish you well.”
“Doesn’t matter, I suppose,” Draco replied.  “I don’t mind.”
“Certainly.  Ben.  I’m getting the impression that Mrs. Powers has more than a few concerns.”
“Nice girls don’t go down on their roommates,” Harry said with a grimace.  “It shattered her.  Blaise was all she had left.  She was homeless and broke, and it was rather difficult for a disinherited Slytherin to find employment, especially one with the dubious honour of having suggested they throw the Chosen One to the Dark Lord during the final battle.  Pans had a tough time, and, what can I say?  I’m a sucker for someone who needs saving.”
“I wouldn’t ever, I told you that, Harry.  You can stay here as long as you like, and if you wanted to leave, the Weasleys would take you in a heartbeat.”
Harry laughed.  “I was so far from ‘fine’, it was a joke, but I do appreciate you being there for me.”
“And what was your involvement in the crimes perpetrated against Harry Potter?”
“Potter, we’ve been partners for three years.  That’s like, an average morning for you.”
“I’m not sure, Dad.  I don’t know if I’d want to be here without you.”
“How long will we be asleep?”  Cass asked.
“Draconus, you know that this is your duty to the family.  You must marry, produce an Heir, continue the line.  This has never been up for discussion.”
“Ginny,” I say, and I can’t imagine how she must be feeling.  She’s, objectively speaking, beautiful, and this must be a nightmare for her self-esteem.  “That doesn’t seem fair to anyone.”
“It’s the story I want.”
“But he wasn’t imprisoned,” I say.  “You told me that everyone who’d been really awful was in…thingy.  The prison, with the black ghost things.”
“But you don’t have anyone making you do it.”
I can’t argue with that plan, so I content myself with breathing in the scent of his hair until I drift off.  When I wake up a short time later, I’m starving, and I have to pee, and the come has dried all over us so I’m itchy and feel disgusting.  As I wriggle out from under him, I wonder if I can entice Draco into the shower with me.  “No,” his voice is adorably sleep rough.  “Stay.”
The next thing that happens, starts out relatively small.  Just a few potions vials, jittering in their stands, the clinking noise as they collide with one another sounding loud in the silent room.  The edges of my vision are starting to turn grey, and the room’s grown unbearably cold.  I haven’t got the slightest clue what the fuck is happening, but my desire to grab Draco, Pansy and the baby and get the fuck out of here is turning into a panicked imperative.  “Draco,” I say, and my voice sounds different, deep and guttural.  “Bring Scorpius and come here.  You too, Pansy.”  I’m operating purely by instinct, and I register mild surprise when they immediately obey.  I grab their arms, intending to shove them behind me, and the air displaces with a crash, and we’re experiencing the sucking, twisting awfulness of apparation.
And that had been it.  They hadn’t said another word.  Cass had finished her exam, and been pronounced fully fit to proceed with the bone marrow transplant.  They agreed upon a day in a week’s time, and Harry and Draco promised that both children would be there at the appointed time.  They, very politely, spoke through Cass until they could part ways at the floo, and there had been no further contact until Draco had shown up this morning.  When they had entered the room where Harry and Cass were waiting, Draco had ignored Harry, but hugged Cass.  Astoria and Scorpius had hugged both of them, and then they had withdrawn to their respective corners until now.
“Astoria is lovely,” Harry said.  “And so is Scorpius, but don’t write Draco off completely.  He made a terrible first impression on me too, once.”
“Very much so.”
“Yes,” Draco sighs.  “I remember.” Harry doesn’t say anything for a minute, and now Draco isn’t sure that he’s dating Dennis after all.
They fight then.  Draco calls him a doormat, asks him how Draco can mean so little to him.  Harry calls him a git and tells him that he’s trying to make it easier for him.  Harry ends up standing in front of him, breathing heavy, eyes flashing.  “I love you, you stupid prat.  Don’t you dare tell me that you don’t mean anything to me.  I love you enough to let you go, you arsehole!”  Draco launches himself at Harry and their kisses are frantic, desperate, a clash of teeth and tongues and Harry’s glasses are crushed against Draco’s face, but he’s desperate to taste and suck and touch every inch of Harry.
“I wish-"
Draco is looking at him as though he’s speaking Parseltongue, but he’s pretty sure he isn’t.  He waits a moment, but Draco doesn’t say anything, and Harry literally wants to die.  He thinks he might just get up and leave, and then go cast the Killing Curse on himself.  But he wants to be sure, so he tells himself to be brave, and says, “Did you?  Have interest?”
“Course,” Harry said.
“Nope, still baffled,” Draco said.  On Hallowe’en, an owl had arrived, with a strange old-fashioned Muggle postcard held in its beak.  The postcard depicted a hilly scene, and in the forefront was a man, riding a chicken with a woman’s face. Bold red print along the top said ‘you can’t drive the chickens here’.  The opposite side had no message, other than a hastily scrawled ‘Harry’.  It remained inexplicable.  For a while, Draco had wondered if there was some type of cryptic message.  Was he calling
A few days later, Draco recognized the Weasley’s tiny, strange owl again, and there was another note from Harry.
“You think you have to protect me from everything.  But I know you, dad.  When you’re upset, I know it.  I feel it.  And I could help you, if you let me.  But you insist on doing it all by yourself.”
“Hear me out,” she urges.  She reaches into her pocket and pulls out a small vial filled with silvery liquid.  “These are memories.”
“Alright.” Harry looked pleased.  They apparated to the Leaky, and it was…nice.  Awkward as hell, of course.  But Harry was funny.  And yes, he was still the honourable Gryffindor who couldn’t be catty if his life depended on it.  But he was smarter than he’d seemed.  And, despite everything, he was so fucking hopeful. As though this fresh start were all that was needed for the Wizarding World to put aside old grudges and start anew.  Draco supposed that dying and coming back to life would do that to a bloke.  But somehow, listening to Harry talk about his hopes for the future, the ale sloshing out of his pint glass as he gestured, Draco could see why the world followed his lead.  He wasn’t arrogant, as Draco had once thought.  In fact, when people came and gushed over him, he turned crimson and became nearly inarticulate.  But he had a special kind of magnetism, and Draco felt that, even though he personally didn’t have any hope for the future, he might be able to borrow some of Harry’s to tide him over.
“I’ll just give you a moment,” John said, catching Harry’s eyes as he backed out the door.
“Um, sure, okay,” Harry answers.
Draco found a spare pair of skates, and knelt at Harry’s feet.  He removed Harry’s trainers and shoved his socked foot into the first skate.  His eyes flicked up to Harry’s to check his comfort, and for a moment, he was remembering.  Green eyes, pupils dilated with lust as Draco nestled between Harry’s legs, taking Harry’s cock into his mouth.  For a moment, Draco’s eyes lingered on Harry’s crotch, then he stopped himself, and remembered.  Harry wasn’t his anymore.  Draco breathed.  Waited until his thumping heart had reached a reasonable pace again, and then said, “The fit okay?”
“Mister Potter, we cannot allow any outbursts from witnesses or the public-” Madam Marchbank begins, but I pay her no mind.
“I tried to crucio him the night he nearly killed me.”
“Unrequited?  Are you sure?”  Harry can’t bear the idea of Draco being lonely.
“No, but I mean, like, unrelated to the potions smuggling thing.  Do you think I was set up?”
As the hours passed, Harry fell into a fitful sleep, but Draco stayed awake.  Harry was clearly dreaming, and at one point, he issued a single, heartrending sob, but didn’t wake.  Draco considered nudging him out of the dream, but dismissed the idea.  Things were too fraught, Draco’s emotions too tangled, to risk any further emotional exposure.
“Right, yeah,” Ron replied pushing his hair out of his eyes.  “I guess it’s different.”
Draco eyed the plate.  Three bites.  They’d been sitting there for nearly an hour, and his birdlike child had eaten precisely three bites of his pancake.  “Are you sure you can’t eat a little more?”
, needs him like air, and sunshine, food.  Deciding that this isn’t a productive line of conversation, he finally shakes his head.
“Alright Cass, we were right that Auntie Min had news for me.  It’s kind of a lot, but if you want to know about it, I’ll tell you.  And if you don’t want to know, you can trust me to take care of it.”
Harry looked to Malfoy.  “I’m certain that you can safely see Scorpius home, but I’m also more than willing to accompany you.  I think we should begin discussing some additional supports to keep Scorpius’ 'dragon' in line.”
Tea is served, and Draco is introduced to Teddy, who is sweet, and beyond excited at meeting a new cousin.  His hair immediately morphs white-blond, and he insists on sitting on Draco’s lap until he suddenly, in mid-babble, falls asleep.  Andromeda chuckles.  “He’s just like his mum,” she observes fondly.  “Nymphadora used to crash out just like that.”
Cass’ returning smile was breathtaking.  “Thank you.  And thank you for being my dad’s family.”
At first glance, it looks like a pretty standard office, with desks, and bookshelves, and a battered looking plant standing by the spelled window.  But Hermione puts her hand on a book, and the room shimmers for a moment, before it disappears completely, replaced by a hallway.  Hermione grimly stalks down it, the rest of us close behind.  She opens a few doors, but after looking inside each one, she turns away.  Finally, she reaches the door at the very end of the hall, and we step into what looks a lot like a hospital room.  There are beds with curtains around them, and it’s brightly lit.  A series of cabinets along the wall are closed tight. There’s a faint sound behind one of the curtains, and Hermione draws her wand before pulling the curtain along its tracks.
Summoning an elf, he commanded it to deliver the missive to Harry Potter, and sat back to wait.  He was still disgustingly unbathed, a night of dozing in an uncomfortable chair taking its toll, but he was unable to leave the room to go shower.
“My Mama,” Harry echoed.  Draco wasn’t sure if Harry was agreeing with him, or inquiring after his own mother, but he edged closer, and petted Harry’s hair back off his forehead.
“That’s discouraging.  I dunno how these sort of things work, but shouldn’t I have had to…I dunno sign something?”
“Well, it’s not completely altruistic.  I’ve recently found myself with a bit more spare time, seeing as how I’ve parted company with the Ministry.”
His return to Lara was better, and worse than he’d hoped.  She didn’t tell him “I told you so,” but she was a little
“I always thought that you were a product of your past.  Your shit childhood, and Dumbledore’s manipulation.  I thought they’d raised you to be self-sacrificing.  You’re different now, but not completely different.  It seems like some things are just how you are.”
“That’s okay, little one,” Draco said.  “Something upset you, and then what happened?”
“I’m sure you have lots of questions, and I’m ready to answer them.  I don’t know whether you want Scorpius to stay here with us, or go have hot chocolate with the house elves.”
Hermione, who was deeply entrenched in some writing something for presentation at the Wizengamot, emerged from her study to get a cup of tea.  She produced some biscuits of dubious origin, and they spent an enjoyable half hour exchanging the latest gossip about their Ministry Co-Workers.  “…and that awful Romilda Vane, you remember her, right, Harry?”
“I shamelessly eavesdropped,” Draco confirms, and a ghost of his normal grin appears.
“Okay, thanks,” Harry said.  “Cass, it’s your decision.  Would you like to proceed with the testing?”
“But he could do himself a danger!  Weasley, you can’t play around with these sorts of things.  What potions is he on?”
“I wanted to try to do a loop,” Harry protested.
Harry isn’t sure what will happen with everyone else, whether he’ll ever regain the open trust they once had, but he knows that he and Ron are okay, and for now, that’s enough.
“Like what?”
“They aren’t,” he bites out.  “They aren’t members of our society.  They lost, and once we eliminate them, only decent people will remain.”
“You really are just like this,” she says, a funny look on her face.  It’s similar to what Draco said to me before.
“I’m not really interested in doing things the normal way,” she’d said, tossing her head.  “I don’t mind producing one child, if that’s something that you want.  I will love him or her, and I’ll be involved, but I want a career more than anything.  If you want to discreetly divorce after the baby comes, I wouldn’t fight you for custody, just visitation when schedules allow.”
“I know.  I remember last time.  Did you come with me when I got my wand?”
“Yeah.  As you might recall, I got rather a lot of attention as I was growing up, and I fear my return to England is going to prompt the same treatment again.  Normally, I wouldn’t give a fig about what the press says, but I’m not here alone, and I’m very protective of my travelling companion.”
“No,” Draco says thoughtfully.  “I’m too much of a romantic.”
On the afternoon of Harry’s second day being nine, Hermione and Ron arrived, with a cheerfully screaming Rose.  Harry had agreed to another round of Exploding Snap with Ron, and Draco noticed that he seemed a lot more comfortable around his soon-to-be best mate.  They spelled a safety barrier around Rose, and left her with some toys, and then Draco and Hermione disappeared into the lab.
“I beat my Dad to the snitch about once every dozen games.”
“What about your people?  Your family?”
The next newspaper addresses the problem of the Minister for Magic.  Kingsley has been ousted in a non-confidence vote, and will also serve a forty-year sentence in Azkaban.  The paper seems much more interested in who will take his place.  The Undersecretary has been sworn in as Acting Minister.  I note with interest that Percy Weasley now holds the title.
Harry looks like shit.  It’s only been a week, so he
“She was right, as it turns out.”
“What’s wrong?”
He was crying harder now, his body shaking with sobs and his words nearly incomprehensible.  “So
I sigh.  “Surprisingly?  God, Draco, was I a complete idiot?  Hermione won’t say, but I think I might have been.”  It’s disappointing.  I don’t
“I don’t know, Malcolm.  Probably not tonight, because it’s actually quite late.”
The owl returned more quickly than Draco would have imagined.  Harry likely wrote his response the moment he got Draco’s.  Anticipation roiling in his chest, Draco felt weak as he unwrapped the parchment.
“Dray?”  Draco’s back may as well have been a mountain range, so stiff and unmoving was it.  Harry jumped out of bed, and went around to Draco’s side, crouching at the edge of the bed so that their faces were close.  “Baby?  I wasn’t laughing at you, I promise.  I just was thinking about how much I love you, and then I was trying to stay quiet so that I didn’t prove you right about how stupid I am at bedtime, and the tension kind of made me giggly, and then I couldn’t stop it.”
funny, until he murders me in my sleep,” Harry grumbled, yelling his goodbye to Teddy and apparating directly from Andromeda’s kitchen directly to his own.
Harry had a bouquet of flowers, which he presented to Astoria, and a little vial of rosewater for Narcissa, both of whom practically cooed at him as they thanked him.
“Darling,” Papa said, and his voice sounded so hurt that she looked up.  His pretty grey eyes were filled with tears.  “Darling, no.  That’s not true.”
“Dad, I want to stay a bit longer.  I want to spend more time with Papa and Scorpius, and I want to go to the Weasleys’, and…I’m not ready for it all to be over.”
“I thought maple syrup was their finest export,” Dean mused.
“Yes,” Draco says, and he has this stubborn, porcelain set to his jaw that makes me want to hit him.  Or bite him.  “I’m sure it happens in the Muggle world as well.”
I consider saying something that would force him to clarify that it is Kingsley himself who so carefully guards my best interests, but he hasn’t done anything to alienate me…yet, so I murmur, “Alright.”
As they approached the ice, Draco inhaled deeply.  The sharp, crisp smell of the ice always filled his senses with excitement.  He’d conjured some dummies who would approximate opponents, and, although they weren’t like playing with team members, at least they’d provide a bit of a barrier to get around.  And these ones weren’t spelled to slam him into the boards, so this practice was already guaranteed to hurt less than a usual one.  He got Harry settled on a bench with a warming charm, and stepped onto the ice.
I throw him a grateful look, and say, “Yeah, alright.  I’ll just…” I wave vaguely at the direction of the spare room, and go throw on a pair of trackies and a t-shirt.
“Mm, really?”  He’s kissing down my neck and it’s distracting as hell.
He smiled at Scorpius, “That’s amazing.  I can see that you’re really proud of what your Papa does.”
“As you wish.”  That was when Draco realized that he wasn’t here on a social visit.
“No,” Draco sighs, when it becomes obvious that Potter isn’t going to leave until he answers him.  “I was out.”
Draco grabs his arm, and they’re both crying and kissing.  With a little giggle, Harry pulls away.  “Baby? Your mouth tastes awful”  He casts a freshening charm, and they’re laughing and crying.  Draco pulls Harry down onto the bed.  They’re frantic, clothes being tugged off with urgency and still they’re kissing and tasting and biting.  Draco tries to remove Harry’s t-shirt but it gets tangled around their heads and even still, neither can bear to allow their lips to part, so they leave the shirt tangled around Harry’s neck while they pull off pants.  Harry’s lying on top of Draco, elbows propped around Draco’s head on the pillow.  It’s all he can do to make sure that their skin is touching as much as possible.  He grinds his cock against Draco and he releases a strangled sound through their entwined lips.   A few moments of desperate frottage, and they’re both coming.  Harry howls as his seed flies all over Draco.
Draco liked hockey because it felt like flying.  As he quickly skated the circles on the rink, and then did the whole thing again backwards, the way the breeze ruffled his hair reminded him of November games on the Quidditch pitch.  As he darted after the puck one of his dummies had shot into a corner behind the net, it might as well have been the snitch.  Draco loved hockey, because, even in the Muggle world, he had a chance to remember what it was like to be a wizard.
He nods.  “I need…I don’t know what I need, but I don’t think it’s here.”  He looks so terribly sad, and so heartbreakingly young.
“What is it?” His voice was sharp, but in his defence, his heart was pounding, and he’d whacked his elbow, hard, against the doorframe as he’d flown around the corner.
Harry blushed a little.  “I sometimes get a bit carried away.  Last year, she had twelve girls over for a slumber party.  I don’t know if you’ve ever had that many nine year old girls in a small house before, but they nearly deafened me.”
“Honestly, Ron, you have no sensitivity,” Hermione hisses.  Her tone wakes the snake, who has decided to come along and keep Harry company.
“How did they manage to keep that a secret?” Hermione asks.  “You’d think they’d want the public to know that they were taking definitive action against those who were Dark-aligned.”
“I’d say it even if I weren’t.”
“Of course,” Draco agreed.  “Take his potions, just in case.  Will you join us for dinner at the Manor?”
“Mister Potter, why did you keep Mister Malfoy from his daughter?”
The question mortifies Harry.  He feels exposed, worthless.  How pathetic he must seem!  He wants to run away, or push Draco enough to make him mad, but Draco is his friend, and he’s hurting, and Harry won’t make it worse.  He settles for shrugging, and mumbling, “I’m sure my parents did.  And Ron and Hermione.”
Harry had the next couple of days off, so he spent the time lounging on his couch in his pants, eating biscuits, and arguing with Kreacher about cleaning the kitchen.  He bought a new coffeemaker, and begged his semi-sentient kitchen to accept this one.  He visited Teddy and took him for a fly, and then topped it all off with another visit to the Granger-Weasleys.
Draco stared at her.  She gave him an angry little smile, and said, “I know you’re mad at him.  We
Draco watched her go for as long as he could stand, before saying, “Wait.”  Narcissa stilled, but didn’t turn around.  Her back tensed, as though she was awaiting further criticism.  “I could use some advice, if you have time.  I don’t know the first thing about baby care.”
“So polite,” she said approvingly.  “Your Father said that you were going to the canteen.  Do you think that you could eat five bites of whatever he puts in front of you?”
“I’m good, Harry,” Draco said, suffused with relief.  Harry was okay.
At first, Draco couldn’t understand what the problem was.  Without question, he’d been stupid and thoughtless, at the dinner table, but why would Harry be upset about taking his daughter to Diagon Alley?  Why would he begrudge Draco one moment of his child’s magical upbringing?  Stifling a groan, Draco rephrased the question in his head.  Why would Harry Potter, wandsmaster, be offended that Draco had taken away a moment that he’d likely dreamed of his entire life?
“It’s very likely that she will, Draco.  It’s an incredibly rare side effect.”
Harry stands there, a massive snake licking the tears from his cheeks until nearly morning.
“How do you guys do this?”
This Chapter, although short, is told from Harry's perspective, and, as you'll see, he's a bit of an unreliable narrator.  I've been thrilled by all of the super-interesting commentary on both Harry and Draco's motivations and actions throughout this story, and I fully expect that this chapter might raise more thoughts.  If it seems like he's all over the place, that's because he is, and I'll ask for your patience and indulgence for a few more chapters.  I promise I'm going somewhere with this!
“Not here,” she says.  I take her arm, and lead her to the lifts.  We end up in the cafeteria, and she casts a privacy spell.  “It’s Pansy,” she says.  “They’ve arrested her for breach of probation.”
Finally, the guests go home, and Harry and Draco decide to walk back to their cottage in Hogsmeade, Scorpius bundled up snugly in Harry’s arms.  They stop at the gates, while Harry says goodnight to the winged boars that guard the Castle.  After he pats each on in turn, he turns back to Draco, and says, with a blissful little smile, “Alright?”
Scorpius changed the subject to discuss the nearby park, with its brilliant climbing structure, and Harry made his excuses, arranging a time to meet in the next few days.  He logged his paperwork, and, since it was still early enough in the day, sent a Patronus to Andromeda, arranging to pick Teddy up from school.
“Oh,” Draco said, nonplussed, “then I suppose you must call me Draco.”  This earned him a wry little smile from Ron, and and approving nod from Hermione.  “I didn’t know you had a baby of your own.  Congratulations.”
“You’re borrowing trouble, Harry.  No one has suggested that you’ll lose her.”
“There you have it.  You seem to have no trouble in separating the child who needs protecting from the man who draws conflicting emotions.  I honestly don’t think you need to worry about this, Draco.  That’s my professional opinion as well as my personal one.  I still think that you’re needlessly making your recovery difficult, but I trust your judgement.  If this is the right thing for you, then I support you.”
“Thanks,” Draco said.
I laugh, but it’s a hollow, empty sound.  “So Hermione actually pushed me closer to being a Dark Lord.”
Draco’s Mother has been told, and her grief is wilder, less contained, but she’s also angry, murderously angry.  I don’t have any memory of Narcissa Malfoy, but she’s a formidable witch, and I’m glad that her fury isn’t directed my way.  She seems ambivalent about my presence at the breakfast table, polite but distant.  I'm thrilled to ignore her, as all of her pent up feelings make me nervous.
Harry’s eyes are dancing.  “‘Mione?”
Draco’s face was unreadable, but he said, “Potter,” before Scorpius came tearing into the room, and ended the conversation.
“What did he say?”
“Right,” she says.  “Unspeakable, after conducting your research,” (this word is sneered so hard I think her face will stick that way), “what recommendations did you make?”
“Harry, this is…I’ll never be able to repay you,” she says, her voice wavering on the edge of tears.
Harry was led to a comfortable library, where Narcissa was reading by the fire.  She stood, and presented her cheek for kissing.  “Hello, Harry.”
Draco insists on stopping by my flat to dress me in one of the dress robes I bought during my shopping spree.  He fusses with my hair for an inordinate amount of time, which I find annoying, but he gives me a lust-filled once over that makes up for it.  “Acceptable,” he sniffs, and I spend the floo journey to the Ministry imagining all of the things I’d like to do to wipe his smug little sneer from his face.
They get spectacularly pissed, dancing to David Bowie records that Sirius left behind.  As the night winds to a close, and they create a little nest on the couch, with blankets, and a bucket just in case, Harry whispers to her “I loved him.”
I don’t remember flooing home, but I must have.  I don’t remember whether I gathered my glasses and my wand, or my clothes, but they’re sitting on my lap, so I obviously did.  It takes me a long time to realize that I’ve been sitting for a while.  Long enough that I’m cold.  I crawl into my bed, and pull the covers around me.  I lay in the dark for a long time, the plaintive wail of a baby echoing through my head.  I don’t know much about baby ages, but certainly the child isn’t old enough to talk, right?  Otherwise, it would call for its Daddy.  Or Mommy.
And then the Healers came back, and Harry, Draco and Astoria were standing outside the room where their children lay, asleep and still and so, so small in the beds.  Harry was paler than Draco had ever seen him, and his eyes were wide behind his glasses.  He seemed to be barely breathing, and Draco knew exactly that feeling, the terrible realization that your child was solely in the hands of others, that you could do nothing to protect them.
“No, it’s stupid, do whatever you think, design-wise.”
“That’s amazing to hear.  I think it’s important for kids, especially girls, to be confident in their own autonomy.”
“Maybe that’s what he wants.”
“We’ll figure it out.”
him.  An intriguing little blush colours his cheeks and my smile widens.  “Come on, Draco,” I say, “I’d owe you a favour.”
“Nuh-uh,” George said, his grin widening.  “I’m going back to the store.  I’d suggest that you get in touch with Bill.  He can arrange a solicitor for Gin through the bank.”
Harry reached for Cass’ travel bag, and his eyes narrowed as he spotted a thin box on the top.  It was as though he’d had the wind knocked out of him.  He swayed a little, and devastated green eyes met Draco’s.  “You took her to get her wand?”  Draco had only heard his voice sound so little, so lonely, once before.
“I know.  We’ll have a better day tomorrow, I promise.”
Harry was waiting for them in the visitor’s lounge, standing in the corner, bouncing a little on the balls of his feet.  Draco scanned his face, looking for progress, checking to see if the tense, drawn look had receded any.  Harry smiled nervously at the sight of them, but waited for them to cross the room to him.
“Yes,”
Draco huffs and returns to his work.  The bell on the door rings almost immediately afterward, and Draco shouts, “I said go away, Potter!”
“Well, he can take it up with me.  Now, please don’t be rude, and thank Madame Lefebvre.”
“Thank you,” Harry said.  “I’ll just go have a little chat, then.”
“Hullo, Luna.  Nice to see you again.”
After Harry is satisfied that Hermione is safely at the Burrow, he throws on a shirt, and apparates to an alleyway outside Blaise’s building.  He can hear Dean from the hallway, and he knocks on the door to be greeted by a wild-eyed Blaise.  “I don’t know how to help him,” he whispers.
This morning, he was roused, not by his usual alarm spell, but by an urgent little voice in his ear saying, “Papa.”  His eyes flew open, and he stared, a little blearily, at his four-year-old son.
“You should be loyal to your family because of love,” Cass insisted stubbornly.
She sighs.  “I think that you’ve been done a disservice.  You’ve been given the story of your life, in broad strokes, but none of the context.  Tell me what you know of the war.”
on my own.  I have lovely friends, and I’m more grateful to them than I can ever say.  But I don’t really have anyone.  I have to make a decision, and I have to make it on my own.”
“Well, it’s not bad, but a little unexpected.  Cass is a bit bigger than Scorpius, and I’d expect her to metabolize the sleeping draught more quickly.  She’s never had one before, correct?”
Harry felt a wave of sympathy for his oldest friend, who still couldn’t muster up the slightest bit of emotional intelligence.  “I don’t think that Ginny and I are what’s bothering you.”
“But she’ll wake up soon, right?”
I shrug.  Undaunted, he continues.  “Hermione isn’t herself either.”
“I don’t see the connection,” he says.  “Wait.  What baby Death Eaters’ probation?”
Cici re-entered the room, and Draco couldn’t read her expression.  She sat behind her desk, and opened a file.  “I have Scorpius’ results.  The numbers aren’t where I’d like them to be, not by a long shot.”  She pointed out the comparison between Scorpius’ previous white and red blood cell counts.   “His white blood count is significantly lower, which tells us that we’re entering a different stage of the disease.  This means that the Androgens that we’ve been using to treat Scorpius aren’t going to help him any longer.  And it explains why Scorpius is seeing more infections, bruising and nosebleeds.”
“Harry,” Draco warns, “leave it.”
“Hello, ma’am.  I’m afraid I’ve had some spell damage that’s affecting my memory, so I apologize if we’ve met before.”
“Because,” Harry looked at him as though he were very stupid.  “A dog would keep me safe.  And, I could talk to it, and if I had a bad dream I could stroke it.  Why
“Until you got in a giant strop one day and your accidental magic went after the lot of them!”  Ron seems delighted at the memory.  “They’ve left you alone since then, unless you do something really noteworthy, like shag a Malfoy, but I imagine that if you took this to them, they’d ignore the bigger stuff and instead write something about how you’re a conspiracy-theoried nutter.”
“I brought gin.”
“You still think it’s more important to protect me, then to tell me the truth and let us deal with it together.  Draco,” Harry said, and then he gave a frustrated wave of his hands, and apparated away.  His name on Harry’s lips sounded so hopeless that Draco knew he’d chosen wrong.  In his efforts to do the right thing, he’d lost Harry completely.
Draco cast a wild look at Hermione, who was staring back, equally baffled.  “Kidnapped?  Harry, nobody kidnapped you.”
“Harry, for Merlin’s sake, if we’re late, I’ll-”
“Cass, please.  I’d really like to tell you, to try to explain,” Harry began, his hand outstretched pleadingly.  The look she gave him was her answer, and Harry faltered slightly.  “Okay then, we’ll give you your privacy.”  She was nearly at the stairs when he said, “Cass?  I love you.”
“I’m fine,” Harry said.  “I just need a bit of time to myself, Kreacher.  No need to make dinner tonight.”
“Well then.”  His smile grows wistful.  “I think you’ll be waking up soon.”
Tears pour down Draco’s face.  “Please, Harry.  Please, please, please don’t do this.”
“Marrying a lovely, beautiful witch will hardly doom our society to ruin.  I do hate when you’re dramatic.”
“So that’s what’s happened,” she says, ignoring Ron and concluding her confession, in a wooden, empty voice.  “When you awoke at St. Mungo’s, your mind was, essentially, just id and ego, a blank slate.”
“I will.  I’ll never forget that, I was so scared.”
“Is this why you left?”
“He should be up from his nap shortly.  Shall I make tea?”  Without waiting for an answer, she swept from the room, and Harry and Draco made themselves comfortable on the sofa.  Harry squeezed his hand and snuggled against Draco.  When Andromeda returned with a tea tray, she paused for a moment, eyeing their closeness with her sharp, dark eyes.  “Well, this is unexpected,” she remarked.
“Those are all very noble goals, and something that you can work towards, Draco.  But, I want to tell you about Muggle airplanes.”
Draco groans.  Harry slides down his body and takes Draco into his mouth.  When he’s sucked him to near-climax, he parts Draco’s legs, finds the rosebud pucker and encircles it with his tongue.  Draco’s whimpers are delicious.  “Harry” he begs.  Harry’s tongue is determined, plunging inside Draco’s channel, his mouth hot.  His tongue teases, so close to Draco’s prostate, but not touching.  Draco writhes.  “Fuck me, Harry.”
“Oh Harry.  Oh no.  Oh no no…” Draco was babbling now, his panic rising.  “Please tell me that this is your revenge, that you’re saying this to fuck with me.  I know I deserve it but please Harry, please tell me that you’ve been happy this whole time.  Because if this wasn’t worth it, why did I-”
Harry continued talking quickly, obviously not ready for a repeat of all of the feelings of their last visit.  “The Slytherins came a bit later.   Blaise and Hermione got to know one another in Unspeakable training, and with his Mother gone, he was looking for somewhere to stay, so he was next.  He’s quiet, you know, it didn’t seem to change anything.  That’s how we met Pansy.  It seems her parents didn’t really appreciate her…lifestyle.”  At Draco’s raised eyebrow, Harry continued.  “They flipped shit when they realized that she and Daphne Greengrass’ slumber parties weren’t quite as innocent as they let on.  They cast her out.”
“If I leave this up to you, Harry’s going to reach his proper age on his own, through passage of time, while you ‘check your numbers’, Draco.”  Hermione’s voice was filled with laughter, but her face was serious.  “Why are you so hesitant?”
“The edges of what?”  He hates this.
“Who’s telling this?” I demand.  “I’m undercover, obviously.  Actually, now that I’m thinking of it, why would Aurors wear red robes?  That just seems poorly thought out.  I suppose they have a great big target painted on their hats as well?”  George laughs, and I continue.  “I digress.  So, I’m sneaking along, my trusty canine at my side.”
“Why would I return to a school full of dunderheads when I have a willing and capable pupil here?”  Severus’ voice was cantankerous, but he looked at Cass proudly.
He was relieved when 8:00 arrived, and he could step through the floo to the Malfoy’s.  He looked around quickly, his heart settling a little when he spotted the familiar blonde curls bent over a chessboard.  Draco was sitting opposite her, watching her as she contemplated her next move.
“I know.”
“I’ve come to a dead end, with nothing but a bunch of dead rats to show for it,” Draco said, when they’d dispatched Harry to bed, and had settled in the lab.
“Yes, of course.  Anything I can do to help.”
Molly is at the kitchen table, sitting across from George, holding one of his hands with both of hers.  She is speaking quietly, and George is nodding, tears flowing unchecked down his cheeks.  “Molly,” Arthur says, trying to summon some of his usual good humour.  “Look who’s here.”
“I imagine it is,” Narcissa agreed.   “Tell me, is that Harry Potter being tended to by my Auntie Walburga’s house elf?”
Clean, still allowing his mind to tick through the calculations he’d noted, he climbed the stairs to find that Kreacher and Potter were in the sitting room.  Kreacher was levitating some priceless eighteenth century china cups in an elaborate ballet, to Potter’s riotous amusement.  The baby was laughing enormous belly laughs, and, despite his fear for the china, Draco found himself smiling.  Potter reached starfish hands towards Draco, and Kreacher, a little shamefaced, quickly directed the china back to its spot in the cabinet and bowed low.  “Master Harry Potter has been changed and dressed for dinner,” he said in his gravelly bullfrog voice.  Indeed, the baby had been dressed in very old-fashioned formal dining robes, which, while rather fetching, seemed a bit overdone for the occasion.
“Why are we standing at a gate in the cold?”
“Mm,” I say, distractedly, as a man I don’t know steps through the floo.  “That needs watching, I’d say.”
His mind idly recalled the loving faces around Harry’s kitchen island.  The boy who’d had nobody, no parents, no proper upbringing, had built a strong family who loved and supported him.  If Harry were sitting by a deathbed, he’d have people there to with him, to make him eat and sleep and shower.  Draco may not have done things right, but at least Harry had people.  Draco had three mad house elves who he’d need to free once this was over.
“Stay where you are,” Draco commanded, his voice wavering a little, which caused Potter to still momentarily and examine Draco’s face again.  Whatever he saw there didn’t deter him, and the baby continued steadfastly crawling towards Draco, who squawked in surprise and took a step backward.  This seemed hilarious to Potter, who chuckled in glee before redoubling his pursuit.  “Stop, now, Potter!” Draco could hear the thin edge of panic in his voice.
He could hear Cass chattering away from the living room, and the deep voice answering.  He stood in the doorway for a moment, watching as Cass demonstrated how high she could kick, and did her best to show her Uncle Professor where his vulnerable bits lay.  “Can you set the table?”
The Resident nodded, saying they’d need to fetch a Healer anyway, and Harry went into the Hallway.  His mobile wouldn’t work in the hospital, so he descended the stairs and exited to the street below.  He quickly dialled the number and waited.  “Draco Malfoy.” The voice was crisp, businesslike.
“I could have sworn that you were interested.  You never actually told him that you weren’t.  It seemed like you were playing hard to get.  And if you didn’t want to date Harry, I thought that you at least were friends with all of the Gryffindors now.”
“I don’t.  I don’t know if he’s well, and I have no idea where he is.  I’m sorry, I wish that I did.”
“Really?”  The tiny hint of emotion in Draco’s voice brought tears to Harry’s eyes.
Ginger was back quickly, and Harry called for Cass.  She emerged from her room looking a little sulky, but, knowing that the next few days would be difficult, Harry wasn’t about to revisit the previous conversation.  “Cass, I know that you’re excited to see the castle, and I have to stay out of sight here in my rooms for the time being.  I was wondering if you wanted to explore a little?  Ginger, I know that I can trust you to keep Cass safe, and out of sight from any of the students or teachers?”
I’m nearly at the lift when someone grabs my arm and pulls me into a nearby supply cupboard.
know that you're mad at him.  I get why you're upset.  But you don’t get to use me as some sort of stick to hit him with.
“Yeah,” I whisper, and stand, pulling him to his feet, and leading him by the hand to my room.  The minute we cross the threshold, he pulls my white t-shirt over my head, and his hands move  to my belt.  I let him remove it, unbutton my denims and pull them off, along with my pants.  He seems to like the way I look naked and I want to say something cool and suave like I did before, but words fail me.  I gesture to his shirt.  He nods, and I say, “Lie down for me, beautiful.”
“I can work with that.”
He found himself returning again the following week to drink tea, and discuss wand lore.  And the week after that.  And before long, Mister Ollivander had become Garrick, and Harry had become Harry, and they were drawing up an apprenticeship contract.  For a time, he’d been blissfully happy.
“Yes.  He did.  But, darling, my parents didn’t.”
Harry inwardly rolled his eyes at the ‘Mister Potter’ but school rules were what they were, and he dismissed the girls with high fives, fist bumps, or waves.  He watched as Sarah checked each girl out with their associated picker-upper, and made sure that nobody had been left behind.  Except Cass, of course, who was dragging the dummy into the storage room.  He was headed over to help her when a voice said, “Mister Potter?”
He considered calling Lara, but he knew what she’d say, and he wasn’t prepared to defend his choices to her.  (Perhaps somewhere in the depths of his mind, he acknowledged that he wasn’t being fair to his therapist, who had proven beyond question that she was his staunchest supporter, but he wasn’t interested in being fair, he was interested in fixing his stupid, broken mind, and going to see Harry.)
