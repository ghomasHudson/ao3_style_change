"He's right," Hermione says, coming back from her tour of the bedrooms. The landlord is starting to look a little peevish, like perhaps he didn't sign up to moderate Harry's career demolition conversation. "Harry, what do you think of the bedrooms?"
"It's less like curse breaking and more like magical cleansing. The furniture in the Manor was all very traumatized. I'm sure you can imagine why."
"Er, do you mind if we go up to my flat for a moment? Just to drop off the bags?"
"We'll finish up here and then I'll treat you to lunch."
Harry can't really summon the energy to care about being assigned to Malfoy, just like he can't summon the energy to straighten up the mess of files in front of him. He can barely summon the energy to blink. He shrugs again and then says, "S'just another job."
Malfoy steps closer and lays his hand on Harry's forearm. "I've got an idea," he says.
"The secret is you sprinkle each side with a little sugar. That way the exterior chars quickly and the interior doesn't overcook."
“Very much so,” Harry said, getting out his wallet. He laid down several Galleons beside their finished dinners. “Thanks for today. I’ve had a really good time. Not just the
"What the hell? Just ask me if I want a bloody crepe."
And they kiss, naked bodies pressed together, hands resting comfortably on hips, and shoulders, on the crook of the other’s elbow, or knee. Their lips follow the shape of the other’s own, and Harry wonders what it’s like to know another body as if it’s your own.
The walls were light, covered in a wash of creamy paint. The Muggle television was stupidly vast, and the settee in front of it was ludicrously squashy. It was covered in patchwork blankets of a similar design to those he’d seen on the Weasley bedcovers, and there were books and magazines and knick-knacks everywhere.
It's not just the sweatpants that's changed. Malfoy's hair is much longer, down to his shoulders, but instead of making him look stiff and austere like Lucius, he looks more like Narcissa, sort of feminine… it almost suits him, Harry thinks. Then he realizes he's thinking about Malfoy's hair and shakes his head to clear it. Just because Harry's only been around grizzled middle-aged Aurors and Ron since he started thinking about men doesn't mean he has to notice the first boy he sees, especially since that boy is Malfoy.
"Maybe that's just because I hate being an Auror," Harry says, but he knows that's not true.
Like he’d promised, Harry was there. Unobtrusive, unassuming and understated, but there nevertheless.
“Do I want?” Draco asked, wonderfully disjointed. His body felt lax and loose. “I want you,” he answered, revelling in the unabashed truth of it. “I want you, Harry. I’d love it if you fucked me. It’s been ages.”
Malfoy picks up a half dozen eggs and sets them and his packets of yeast on the counter, smiling at the man like he might bite off Malfoy's fingers.
On Sunday they get another visitor. Luna Lovegood floats into Malfoy's hospital room, looking round with curiosity like she's in a museum.
"The fighting."
"Navy and cream are a classic combination. You obviously know nothing about fashion."
Harry looks up at Malfoy's grey eyes and his small smile and feels… relieved, almost.
"Well if you insist."
“Braxton-hicks,” Harry said, never pausing with his touches. “Your uterus is relaxing and contracting. It’s really normal, Draco, promise. I read about them in my book,” he explained, his palm coming to rest on Draco’s nape. It felt so warm, and solid, and safe that Draco couldn’t help but melt into it. “Was your nightmare a bad one?”
Harry makes it to the weekend without anymore semi-romantic spontaneous trips to Italy and semi-romantic wine soaked picnics with big gay reveals to muddle his head.
Draco must have sat there for eight, ten minutes before he made a decision. There was no way on God’s green Earth that he was going to meet Harry outside of St Mungo’s, like some wilted witch in need of a chaperone.
"I don't know if that's true."
"Fine," Harry says. "Tea?"
Circe, but Draco wanted Harry so much, and he’d been so good. He’d tried so hard, for so long, but suddenly he couldn’t help himself. Draco let himself surrender, let his defences crumble and fragment. Slowly he leant forward, closing the tiny space between them.
"What're you making?"
Draco wasn’t sure how to say the words. It seemed like, all of a sudden, all he could think about was how badly this conversation could go.
since you and I were last in acquaintance. Please do make the effort, Draco, for one is beginning to feel your absence rather keenly.'
"So?" Harry asks. Malfoy loves tomatoes, he talks about them all the time.
Draco halted just as they were about to step into the immense fireplace and pulled Harry aside from the milling crowd.
"We were thinking just friends. Having mum and the family over will be a whole thing and I'm not keen to feed my whole family on my Sickle."
A whole two years away.
That was something Harriet hadn’t quite got a grasp of yet.
Niceties had nothing to do with it.
“I’ll meet you right here at nine, don’t be late! We have a late dinner with the Greengrass’s and it’s the ideal occasion to sidle up to their eldest daughter and get some intel! Cedric! Cedric?"
“Are you fuck!” Greg replied amiably. He played with loose thread on the hem of his tee-shirt. “You don’t suddenly get allergies aged twenty-four Draco. That day we lost against the Harpies, and you and Potter… What was it? Six weeks ago, and- “
"I don't know. Since I lost my mind in this itchy and forsaken bed."
"Ahh, yes, of course. That extract," Harry says. "Everyone's got a bit of that lying around."
-scary?
"There's a lot to choose from," Harry says.
"Babcock."
Rolling his hips, Draco met Harry’s cock with his own, frotting him, and enjoying the delicious friction. His mind went a little fuzzy then. Their touches were too much, and too little, and all Draco could think about was what was coming next. He let his hands wander, squeezing the curve of Harry’s arse and the heft of his thighs. Draco wanted to commit Harry to memory, wanted to know every line and muscle of him forever. If this was the only chance he’d ever have, Draco wanted to enjoy himself. Everything felt so brilliant.
"No, I can't," he says. "Luna said he likes rock cakes! There have to be rock cakes!"
The gate swings open as they approach and Malfoy starts shouting something of which Harry only catches the word "gate" in between the yaps and shrill cries of the peacocks now waddling with a purpose toward Harry like absurd guard dogs and Harry's too startled by the beady red eyes of the advancing peacocks to pay much attention to Malfoy's continued shouting, snatching his wand from his pocket and training it on the peacocks only to freeze when he realizes he has no idea what spell to use on
Petrol hops off the sofa and comes closer to Harry, still lost in this album, in the sunshiney pictures of Malfoy alone and the many more of them together, selfies below deck in a white bed (the thought of them together in a bed makes Harry blush and he flips those pages as quickly as he can) and against bright blue skies; others posed with wine glasses in hand, bright smiles on both their faces. The cat watches him inquisitively, as if asking why he is so different to the Harry it knows, or perhaps asking why he is such a nosy bastard and won’t stop going through what isn’t really his.
Harry groans, but it's half hearted at best. It's hard to be grumpy with a belly full of soup.
Harry cleared his throat, and when he answered, his words were softly spoken.
“Right,” Other Harry starts again, wooden spoon waving in the air as he speaks. “This is awkward as fuck, but we both need it. You hate your life, and I love my life, and the only way for you to stop hating your life and to get from where you are to where I am is through me saying this and you hearing it.” He stops stirring, and wipes his hands on the checkered apron on his front, before his left hand dives into his pocket and brings out a very old, folded many times over, piece of paper. “Merlin, this is dumb.”
"I didn't know—"
Worse, Draco knew that a visit was more than a little overdue. He’d told Narcissa the same fib that he’d given to the other Puddlemere players – a Muggle virus – and he had sent Orpheus flying over with a dozen messages about his slow recovery.
The place was scruffy, and mismatched, but that didn’t matter. Draco could see the potential of the place immediately, and could see how he’d slot in within its walls.
and he can't very well ask him to wait on the pavement because technically it's Harry's actual job to watch him.
Harry is struggling with the tie on the bread bag and it takes a moment for Ron's words to register.
Then, once he’d frightened himself with everything he could expect in the following few months, Draco felt exhausted. A short nap sounded like just the ticket, so he lay down on his bed and proceeded to snooze most of the afternoon away.
The croissant was a taste sensation, sumptuous and buttery, and it vanished into Draco’s mouth as efficiently as any
He won't ever get that drunk again, he decides, shuffling into the kitchen in search of a large stack of buttered toast.
Harry might walk out and refuse to speak to him again. He might call Draco a fantasist or a fool, or say that a Malfoy with a Dark Mark wasn’t a fit parent for anyone. Maybe Harry would demand proof or refuse to believe that the baby was his. A heavy feeling washed through him. Maybe Harry would try to take their baby once they were born.
“Salazar’s fucking eyeball!” she cried out; feigning being scandalised but blatantly enjoying herself. “You’re not fibbing are you, Malfoy? You dark bloody horse! Oh my
Harry wasn’t fazed by Draco’s question. “Because this is the biggest, brightest room in Grimmauld Place,” Harry answered, “and when I said I wanted you to have the best I wasn’t kidding. I can sleep in Sirius’s room. It’s only across the hallway, so if you needed me, you’d only have to shout.”
couple. Even if we had both had our parents around showing us what healthy relationships look like they still wouldn't look like a queer relationship."
"No Romania," Malfoy says, eyes closed.
"Good isn't it? We should get to feel good, Potter. We should get to feel all the good things now."
Draco made no attempt to hide his curiosity about this home that was so utterly different to how he’d imagined it. He cast his eyes around, thinking just how incredibly
"Let's say it was a bit sloppy," Malfoy says.
"Well if you'd let go of my wand arm."
Draco folded his serviette into his lap, imagining Harry sat with his friends in Fratelli’s, gossiping and laughing.
Harry can feel Malfoy's breath against his forehead.
Draco has never cooked with rhubarb before but he's been eyeing a rhubarb and frangípane crumble in one of his cookbooks for going on six months. He'll serve it over creamy vanilla yogurt with a few of the strawberries for a garnish. He fetches some almonds from Harry's pantry and gets to work.
"You gonna do anything about that?"
"Oh, er." Harry doesn't know how to tell Neville that actually he feels like shite. "Fine," he says.
Forcing himself not to glance back, Draco walked out of the door.
Malfoy smiles, and Harry can’t help but feel like it’s an inside joke, like maybe this isn’t an unusual evening for them. In lieu of answering, Draco finally tilts his head up for his lips to meet Other Harry’s in a short kiss.
September was always an odd time of the year for Draco anyway, and even when he hadn’t been expecting, the month always felt suffused with melancholic memories of Hogwarts and his childhood. He’d always detested leaving the Manor to return to school, and having to reaffix the cold, unfeeling Malfoy sneer onto his face and live according to Lucius’s expectations.
"Definitely. How're things with you and Ferret?"
His new home was a busy, chaotic place, filled with piles of books, mismatched furniture and magical curios from all over the world. He could only wonder what the place would look like once their baby was born. Perhaps they’d need to add extra rooms like the Weasleys had done. Mummy would disapprove at the bijou busyness of it all, but Draco didn’t think she’d disparage Grimmauld
"No I didn't," Harry says on instinct. Ron squeezes his shoulders, looking like he's trying not to laugh, and then goes to stand by Hermione, the pair of them far too amused at Harry's expense.
Harry's not ready to have sex but that doesn't mean he's going to pass up the opportunity to kiss Malfoy in his fancy silk pajamas. Harry reaches out to touch said pajamas and bites back a moan. They feel so good and Harry can't resist running his hands all over Malfoy's chest and back.
Things weren’t any clearer in the morning. Indeed, everything felt worse.
That was the sort of comment that would normally have had the pair of them in stitches. Draco hadn’t even told Pansy about his makeshift brassiere, but for some reason, Greg didn’t seem to think Draco’s anecdote was all that hilarious. He chewed the crust of his chicken sandwich thoughtfully, and covered up the smallest of burps with the side of his fist.
“And the last thing I said was my dad’s old catchphrase, the one you reminded me of,” Draco said ebulliently, “Malfoys only settle for the very best. That's what Harry says he wants to be for me. Merlin, but he was even talking about us taking the bond. He wants me to give the pair of us a chance.”
"Well he's not turning blue like he was yesterday."
Neville shakes his head. He's leaning against the kitchen counter with his shoulders slumped and arms crossed over his chest. "I think I might leave," Neville says.
"Are we back to basic observations? I thought we'd gotten past that."
Greg rolled his eyes and stepped into the fireplace. “Then be careful,” Goyle finished, before disappearing into the flames.
Malfoy puts on a floral oven mitt and pulls the scones from the oven. He sets them on a rack to cool and starts slicing the strawberries. Harry stands at his back, resting his cheek on Malfoy's shoulder and winds his arms around Malfoy's thin stomach. Harry can't stop touching him.
The Paternity Department wasn’t anywhere near as dreadful as Draco had feared it might be. The walls were cream and calming, and the paintings on the wall were all splashy modern art. A large bouquet of begonias decorated the Receptionist’s desk, but they’d been magicked to have no fragrance and Draco was profoundly grateful. He leafed through a copy of
"Only superior taste, texture, and nutrition."
"I've never had dal makhani before. That's the problem."
"These—" Malfoy says, pointing to purple iced cupcakes with a plant sprig, "are earl gray cupcakes with lavender swiss meringue buttercream. And these," he says, pointing to pink cupcakes topped with raspberries and pink sprinkles, "are rose and pistachio with raspberry swiss meringue buttercream." Malfoy moves to the other side of the table, "These are coffee cupcakes with a passionfruit curd filling and chocolate biscuit crumbles."
As soon as Malfoy leaves Harry starts worrying about if he sweats in his sleep and whether or not he should wear a shirt to sleep even though he usually doesn't, and are his sheets clean? He's in his pants smelling his sheets when he hears the floo. Harry throws on one of Dudley's old shirts that's still four sizes too big on him and goes out to meet Malfoy. Malfoy, who's wearing a long pink nightgown and a gray dressing gown with matching gray slippers.
"You know when you said you don't know what relationships are supposed to look like?"
"Why would he cry?"
"Ron," Harry moans.
Millie gave his hand a small squeeze. “Well, I’m excited,” she declared. “A baby Malfoy! The world won’t know what’s hit them. I can’t wait to meet a mini-Draco. They’ll be hilarious! They’ll be telling us all off before they can walk.” With that, she stepped towards the doorway. “I think that Greg and I need to open another bottle of red, and make a toast to the future Slytherins of Hogwarts. Not you though. You get another Pumpkin Juice.”
Harry stares at him, trying to will himself to think of something, anything to say.
Harry casts on their shoes and clothes and does a warming charm for good measure and as he tucks his wand away Malfoy tugs him toward the village.
The cake is made and eaten, the dishes are washed and dried, there's nothing left to do but kiss Malfoy.
Harry made a small, surprised noise but he didn’t seem to mind Draco’s action and he kissed back, taking his time, and drawing himself in close. His embraces were soft and very sensual, not deep at all. “Is this alright?” Draco asked, pulling back, breaking their kiss.
Ron nods once at Malfoy, and again at Harry. "I'll see you at home, mate."
"Potter, put that pan down. It looks like it went through the war. Where did you even get that pan? It looks like it's been cursed to burn your food. It looks like one of the Horcruxes you destroyed."
“That’s why we needed to talk,” Draco answered. “Mediwitch Hayes – she’s my St Mungo’s specialist – wants to have a chat with you. Wants to take some family history, measure the strength of your magic, that kind of thing. Later on, I might need potions, and they’ll have to be accurate…”
the remote, the flick of his wand and the tickle of his magic awoke him. “I’m sorry,” Harry whispered, moving to sit up a little straighter. “I wasn’t going to wake you, Draco. I was going to get you a blanket. You looked far too gorgeous asleep. Like a blond, expectant Sleeping Beauty.”
The largest of the 'peafowl' struts into an invisible barrier at the door and gets bounced back, its long feathered tail slipping right under Harry's next step. The seconds that follow feature more squawking, some hissing, and a fair amount of lunging from all involved parties, the peacocks nipping at Harry's fingers and Harry in effort to escape. Harry tumbles through the magical barrier at the door to find Malfoy smirking down at him.
"At least six."
The landlord clears his throat loudly, so loudly Harry wonders if he'd tried several smaller coughs previously.
"You seem different," Luna says. Then without waiting for a response she turns to Malfoy and asks how he's feeling.
Mentally, Draco shook the thoughts from his head. This was old news, and nothing he hadn’t already accepted. Harry and he were making it work, and both were being terribly adult about it. He must have been pulling a curious face, because Mediwitch Hayes looked at him with apparent concern. “So, just to clarify, that means I’ve no concerns whatsoever about later complications with their magic, as can be the case in a small number of wizard-wizard births. Please don't fret. There really isn’t anything to worry about.”
“I’m going to grab you a drink and put the pie in the oven. Can I get you anything else? Do you want me to read to you?”
In the end, Draco chose a soft grey cotton shirt that skimmed lightly over his middle, and a pair of his new pregnancy trousers. He examined himself in the mirror and frowned at the reflection. His bottom was definitely a bit softer and rounder than it’d been pre-pregnancy, and his hips looked like they’d spread a little. Perhaps, in the cold light of day, Harry would regret their kiss, but Draco could only hope that wasn’t the case.
The two of them got to their feet, and followed the Mediwitch to a different room from before. This was painted a very pale mauve, and Harry and he were shown to comfortable seats in front of an imposing desk. Mediwitch Hayes sat down before them and spent a moment perusing her notes before she looked up at them both.
vanished. Draco pulled down his jumper. He couldn’t afford to think about Harry or the aching, empty feeling that he experienced every time he thought about their night together. Right now, he had to think about himself, and exactly what he wanted his future to look like. Draco couldn’t afford to be petulant or to hide his head in the sand. He had to be the adult; be the big, grown-up wizard that he spent his life pretending to be.
"Of a sort," Malfoy says. "Porridge is on the table."
Now that he's seen Malfoy, held him for a bit, he's starting to notice things like his stomach is grumbling and he smells like stress sweat. He takes off the cloak in the loo and then Floos back to the flat. Ron and Hermione are at the kitchen table just like last night, only instead of beans on toast it's Wix Wheaties now.
Malfoy's knife moves over the parsley with quick angry chops. "And pray tell, Saint Potter, how does one 'take responsibility' for one's actions?"
that baby book, but some parts of it are worth reading. And it said that, for some wizards, the move to wearing pregnancy clothes can be really daunting. It’s that feeling that you’ve lost control of your body, and that there isn’t much you can do about it.” Harry leant over and pressed a small, chaste kiss into Draco’s hair. “Not to mention the increased levels of hormones in your body, and the extra strain on your magic. This is a really tough time, but you’re doing really well, Draco. Every day that passes I feel prouder of you.”
a quill, ink, and paper, Draco began a reply.
Malfoy twists his hands together. "I didn't know how many people would be in attendance. Potter neglected to tell me."
Other Harry bends over, lower, and lower, until their faces are nearly touching and Malfoy
It took much less than five minutes to drop off completely. Unfortunately, Draco’s dream – some sensual nonsense that involved Harry and he eating ice-cream in the bathtub – was disturbed before it successfully managed to get interesting. Harrumphing, Draco got up, and made slow progress over the window. He’d been woken by the tapping beak of an owl delivery – likely the potion refill that he’d ordered from Frobisher’s earlier that morning – and Draco pulled the curtains aside, anticipating the sight of their usual Apothecary bird.
Draco nodded, pleased both that the Mediwitch had taken his worries seriously, and that his tiredness wasn’t anything out of the ordinary. He was floating on cloud nine from the
That answer didn’t suit the witch. “It shouldn’t be!” she said, not caring that the whole room had fallen silent. “It’s that cockroach Rita Skeeter,” she clarified, finally relinquishing the dreaded rag. “She’s written a so-called exclusive! I’ve a good mind to Apparate to Barnabus Cuffe, and hex him until he sees sense! It makes me sick, Harry!” she said, her brow furrowed. “You saved the wizarding world! You ought to be allowed to live the life you wish. Why does yours and Draco’s private lives have to be a matter of public property?”
Draco looks around the room as if looking for something he’s lost. Harry wonders if he accidentally misplaced something.
Harry finishes his bowl of polenta without saying more. It's creamy and filling and the oranges are tart and juicy. Malfoy takes both their bowls when they're finished and brings them over to the sink to wash. Without looking up from his scrubbing he says, "Bill Weasley is coming by today."
finally revealed one that’d got lost in the detritus of his drawer. It might have been left there a while, but that wasn’t any of Harry’s business. Throwing them in Harry’s direction, Draco sprawled back on the covers. Fuck, but he needed this. There hadn’t been anyone since he and Cormac had ended acrimoniously, over six months before.
"How come Lord Yipslington's got a name but the cats don't?"
Harry’s first owl message arrived the very next day.
“Merlin,” Draco managed, releasing a long, shuddery breath. “Don’t stop, please.”
Then the timer rings for the cake and Harry jumps.
"Merlin help us, the Gryffindors are ordering safe sushi. What's become of this once noble house?"
Draco looked at the cribs, glowing with magic and the choice on offer suddenly felt like too much. He’d have to come back another day.
And if he's setting the kettle out he'll of course need to brew some tea—a quality assam because Harry Potter probably isn't drinking a good Sumatra. Though he should be, he thinks, fetching the cream from the cold cupboard to fill the pretty floral cow creamer.
Harry gets up and goes down the hall to the kitchen where Malfoy, upon seeing him, runs over to put his hands over Harry's eyes.
Around nine there's a booming knock on the door and Malfoy sits bolt upright breathing hard. "What in the name of all that is magical—"
It was Draco’s turn to scoff. “The only afternoon delight that I’m currently partial to comes in a bag from the The ‘Elfy Bakery,” he fibbed, feeling his face begin to flush pink. He needed to douse the stupid torch he was still carrying for Harry, and comments like that only fanned the flames. Draco didn’t think that it was healthy for his little one to feel his heart race the way it so often did when Harry was around. “But yes. You’re right. We do need to start telling people. A baby isn’t the sort of secret we can keep forever. The first person definitely has to be my mother,” Draco said, pausing at the side of Flourish and Blotts. He pretended to look in at the window display, but really, he was looking at the reflections of Harry and him inside the glass. “Suppose I’m just nervous. Mother is traditional, and a baby without a bonding ring is anathema to everything she was brought up to believe in.”
. Draco shook his head. “What happens next?” he asked. He directed the question at Greg but really, he was asking himself. “What do I do now?”
Harry looks over his shoulder at the door. "The Healer could come—"
A drawer in the entrance hall cabinet is filled with a peculiar assortment of things: a flyer for an exhibition at the Tate Magique, an embroidered handkerchief with the initials D. L. M. (of course, even in an alternative universe, Malfoy is the kind of poncy twat to have his initials stitched on a handkerchief), a deck of cards made of Hearts and Spades only, and a crumpled up recipe for a breakfast potato hash written in oddly familiar handwriting standing out to him.
Draco didn’t think that anything was going to be alright, not for a very long time. He was pregnant. He didn’t know anything about babies, and yet here he was, with one growing inside of him.
"No? Let's try a little experiment then, hmm? Potter, I'm sorry I was a horrible little shit to you for six years." Malfoy waits for a beat. "Do you feel better?"
"Thai green curry with tofu and brown rice."
"But they're a set," he says, pouting.
“It’s going to be alright,” Greg said. He didn’t make Draco say the words, and for that Draco thought he would be eternally grateful. “I know it doesn’t feel like it now, mate, but it will be. Swear it to Salazar.”
"Which kind? You've got five, no six different kinds. Who needs that many olives?"
The Burrow was eerily silent as Draco made his way downstairs, using a Point-Me spell on his wand to guide him through the maze-like corridors. He wondered wherever everybody had gotten to, feeling a bit like an intruder as he stepped into the now-empty dining room. Hearing a chink of crockery from the kitchen, Draco stepped inside, following the noise.
decor. There are no fancy end tables with thirty Galleon floral arrangements or gilt frames of illustrious ancestors. There aren't even curtains on the windows. Many of the rooms they pass don't seem to have furniture, though Harry can hardly get a good look trying to keep up with Malfoy's fast pace. Their steps echo in the cavernous empty corridors because there are no plush expensive rugs on the floors.
The witch was even pleased with his small weight gain, and told him it was exactly where it ought to be. “I’m happy with everything that I’ve seen today,” she said, ending the spell with a
Harry liked the encouragement. He swallowed even deeper, and then he lifted Draco’s legs onto his shoulders.
"What?"
he kissed back? Hermione said it was more of a snog so he must have kissed back a little, unless Harry mauled Malfoy with his tongue. And what was Malfoy thinking when he kissed Harry back? Was it the confusion Harry feels?
Harry may or may not be moving on but the morning moves right on without him and he has to go to Malfoy Manor with the knowledge that his and Malfoy's tongues got well acquainted last night.
tomorrow."
tense and angry. Maybe you didn't notice but—"
In twenty-four years, Draco’s name has blazed in the front of the
"I don't get it."
In his mind’s eye, Draco could see Harry frantically Firecalling Granger, wondering what Draco wanted, and how he could possibly get out of it. Maybe he’d pretend he was poorly. Draco snorted at that. More likely he had a hot date that afternoon with some good-looking hunk.
"A reduced puttanesca sauce, perhaps? With a generous handful of parmesan I think. Potter, go get the olives."
“That’s all your daughter’s doing, making me grumpy,” Draco said, doing as he was asked. He got the juice out, and placed it on the table. “She’s a hungry little blighter who makes me crave sweet things. I think she inherited that from you.”
"I still think guilt isn't nearly as productive and all-righting as everyone seems to think."
"That's not—"
"It's mascarpone mixed with icing sugar."
Harry continues. "And like, I do think he's different now. Which is bizarre, but I do believe it."
"Well you've paid me for it already."
The weird siphoning empty ache on Harry’s chest comes back when Other Harry mumbles a, “Love you,” in the vague direction of the bedroom door as Draco Malfoy leaves.
“You weren’t this studious back at school,” Draco ventured, knowing his comeback was feeble. “Whenever did a thickhead like you get so well-informed?”
"And the biscuits too. I didn't think I'd like chocolate buckwheat biscuits."
Harry retrieves the butter and then tries to hand it off to Malfoy but Malfoy pushes it back at him.
Malfoy closes his mouth and then spends an inordinate amount of time brushing invisible crumbs off his face and lap.
"S'not that interesting. Ginny joined the Harpies, realized she was a lesbian and that was that."
"Yes. Well."
with thinly sliced
Harry reaches for Malfoy's hand. Harry thought his first trip back to Diagon would be filled with looking over his shoulder and keeping his head down, but Malfoy is so ridiculous he takes all of Harry's attention. Malfoy pays at the Apothecary and they leave Diagon, still holding hands.
The next night Hermione brings home several stacks of books she's managed to pry from Madam Pince's skeletal grip and Malfoy brings a bag of groceries and another bottle of wine. Hermione wants to present an alternate history curriculum to the board of governors, one which includes more Muggle and creature history and, Malfoy, while agreeing on this point, argues with her.
"Maybe we can order a few pizzas," Harry says.
Draco thought that he probably shouldn’t. Eating in a restaurant with Harry felt entirely too date-like, and he knew it probably wasn’t the best idea to be indulging in such behaviour. That being said, Draco knew he had to get over his Harry-pash, and get accustomed to the other man’s touches, kisses, and smiles. Platonic co-parenting would end up a big, terrific mess otherwise.
Ron shrugs. "Mum would combust if she didn't offer to feed someone as soon as they came over."
Gentle, questing fingers found their way between Draco’s cheeks then, and though they made him jump, Draco leant into them eagerly. He dropped down to lie amongst the pillows, letting himself enjoy the experience. Draco felt the bliss of Harry’s pleasuring him and his careful fingers moving over his entrance.
"Oh never mind. Just make your rock cakes."
"I didn't mean—" Malfoy says, still staring at his hands. "It was just an expression."
Harry nods, letting Ron stir him out of the tense maelstrom of Aurors at work and back to the elevator. Harry leans heavily against the elevator wall until they reach the right floor.
"I'm not sure why you're stating the glaringly obvious. Have you been hit by a babbling hex?"
Harry focuses on the room around him, to stave off the panic building inside his chest: the white tiles of the backsplash, the fruit bowl on the counter, the plant on top of the fridge. All the cast iron pots and pans on the shelf above, the wood of the table.
"I do."
"Yep."
And that’s when Harry first sees Other Harry fully naked, noticing a few scars on his torso he doesn’t recognise, and a few new tattoos that make him smile. Other Harry climbs into the bath and sighs, contentedly.
They Floo from Harry's to the Manor, coming out the grate in Malfoy's cold, dark and cavernous drawing room. Their steps no longer echo, given the richly carpeted corridors but the Manor still feels cold and lonely to Harry. He doesn't know how Malfoy can stand it.
It's too big a revelation to look at straight on, so Harry looks at the cookbook instead, finding other Punjabi recipes in between Malfoy sniping at him to stop turning the page.
The only thing Harry can think to contribute to the conversation is his surprise that it's happening at all, but Hermione and Malfoy are so deep in a rapid fire exchange about each Governor's political leanings that Harry couldn't get a word in edgewise even if he wanted to.
“I’ve already missed the whole afternoon yesterday. You can’t expect me to stay at home when you’re not even ill,” Draco says.
Draco listened to all the sounds of Café Quendryth. There was the chink of china, the sound of muted laughter and of Sickles being placed in the till. It seemed bizarre to Draco that Harry and he were sat there, having a life altering conversation whilst the rest of the world carried on with their lives.
"Sloppy?" Harry asks, his throat suddenly dry.
"Your aunt and uncle you mean?"
"And what's this? A tent?" Malfoy asks, coming closer and plucking at Dudley's shirt like it offends him. To be fair, Dudley's clothes are fairly offensive. This particular shirt has a hole in the armpit.
Harry picks up Yip and holds him away from his face, where Yip had been trying to excavate Harry's nose. Yip weighs approximately an ounce more than a feather, seeming to be made up primarily of hair.
Malfoy does stop talking. He doesn't stop sucking a series of purple bruises across Harry's neck and clavicle that Ron will tease him mercilessly over for the next week.
He had to resist the temptation to snatch it out of the elf’s hands and dig in his spoon. The moment their waiter had Apparated away from their table Draco did so. The two of them ate in silence for a minute, surrounded on all sides by the hum of other people’s conversation and the bell above the door.
Sitting in the sunshine he starts to doze, listening to some bees busy in a sprawling purple flowered bush. He's getting
Draco paused, his words drying up in his mouth. Harry and he hadn’t planned this part of the conversation. Before they’d had sex, their friendship had been based on booze and laughter, nightclubs and dancing.
"Yes, of course. My apologies for the
“She’ll love them unconditionally,” Draco answered, stepping forward and away from the book emporium. “Well, she will eventually. Once she’s gotten used to the idea of them. Mother is still rather tied to the old ways. She’d have been cast out of the House of Black forever for bearing an illegitimate baby. Her own family would have cut her off from her vault and changed the Wards to forbid her ever returning.”
Harry’s hand curled around the bump, delighted and reverential. “I can’t believe you’re here. You, and our baby. I love you, and I’m going to keep that promise I made. I’m going to be the best – the best for both of you. Thank you for coming to Grimmauld Place, Draco. Thank you for being here.”
The conversations around them continued apace. Charlie, a wizard much older than Harry, was keen to talk about his own ‘babies’, which turned out to be a pair of recently-hatched Horntails that he’d been feeding by hand. Percy, a wizard that Draco recalled being terribly cheeky to at Hogwarts, talked at length about his Ministry job, and how proud he was of being close to the Minister. Mr Weasley – a man that looked precisely how Ron might, had he have taken an aging potion – was quiet, but he looked on proudly at his family. For the life of him, Draco couldn’t understand why his father had vilified this mild-mannered, easy-going man to such a great degree.
Malfoy squeezes Harry's hand feebly. "Hi," he says.
"I know more about cooking," Malfoy says, a small pout on his lips.
Other Harry continues, “You know, you could stay home with me? Bedrest and all that. Anything to stop you from spending any time with that dickhead coworker of yours.”
"Nah, he needs something to get the taste of Ferret out of his mouth."
Draco felt a sudden wetness on his cheek, and it was only then that he realised that, quite unbeknownst to him, he had begun to cry.
come say hello on tumblr! @babooshkart and @bigblackdogfic
"Why?"
"Hopefully," Harry says faintly.
"Come off it, Malfoy. It's always been about showing off. Always a little performance to get what you want. And what you want now is to be back in everyone's good graces."
He's very quiet as he puts Lord Yipslington in his little pen and extinguishes the oven and follows Harry outside to a gray and cloudy day.
Of course, Draco couldn’t tell Judith that he’d turned his mind against it the moment that they arrived, so Harry and he proceeded to follow her though the elegantly decorated rooms.
Hermione comes in with her bag and Harry takes a pinch of Floo powder with shaking fingers and Floos back to St. Mungo's. The waiting room has emptied out and it's just the three of them. Harry resumes sitting restlessly on the hard waiting room chair he's been sitting in all evening. Ron says he'll go get Harry a tea from the cafeteria and Hermione sits down next to him holding his hand.
Malfoy is already getting down another bowl and grabbing butter from the cold cupboard.
"Yes but it's still scratchy so could you bring one of mine from home tomorrow?"
Harry didn’t answer. All he did was look at Draco, very intently, and perhaps a little nervously too. Draco didn’t know whether or not to kiss Harry again, although he really, really wanted to.
"Only caramelized onions with a touch of red wine vinegar? You ran out of gold leaf potatoes?"
“Alright,” Draco said. He knew a moment like this ought to be marked with grand words or a majestic gesture, but prolonged Harry-exposure tended to make him tongue-tied. “Alright. I’ll move in with you, Harry Potter. Only because of the Mondrian, mind you. No other reason at all.”
"You do the dishes?"
"Retribution. We're going to duel to the death, presumably mine since there's still a trace on my wand."
"At least?" Harry says, unable to really process anything.
He climbs up the stairs and stops on the landing, unsure about what his next step should be. His back twinges with pain just as Petrol comes dashing through his legs and jumps onto the unmade bed in the bedroom.
These are the things that stick out to him: there are two sets of uniforms in the wardrobe, and neither of those are the Auror Department’s familiar deep burgundy. Instead, there is a row of midnight blue robes with the requisite ‘D. M.’ from Mysteries embroidered on it in gold, an Unspeakable, and a row of bright lime green robes, the slighty lighter pastel of a Healer in training.
Meeting him at the entrance to the lounge, Harry took the plates off Draco before placing them tidily on the table.
“Just you,” Draco said, and he took Harry’s hand.
"Why? Are you still struggling with wanting to kiss Malfoy?"
Draco read as he unrolled the small piece of St. Mungo's headed parchment across the wood.
Malfoy is standing very close and Harry thinks they must've stood this close when they kissed. Close enough for Harry to see the white tips of Malfoy's blond eyelashes. He feels a little breathless himself.
"What is this? Parfait?" Harry asks.
In the attic, the most curious item he finds is a painting of someone in an Auror uniform, slashed up so badly Harry would be tempted to described it as Sectumsempra’d, if that wasn’t a ridiculous idea. He can’t recognise the face but the painting makes him feel weird in his chest so he leaves the exploration of the attic for a later time.
If someone did come to the Manor to attack Malfoy, Harry seriously wonders how they would get in and back out without getting lost. Harry uses a spell he learned in the Aurors to detect a human presence in the rooms he passes without much  hope—there are probably secret passageways and trapdoors in an old wizarding house like this.
"Won't take half an hour, table's right here."
Draco really hadn’t meant to kiss Harry, and now, looking into the other wizard’s wide green eyes, Draco wanted to curse the fool he'd been only one minute before. Draco wished for Merlin to strike him down where he sat, or for Potter to
Ron picks up one of the vegan chocolate cupcakes and swallows half of it. "These vegan ones aren't bad," he says, stuffing the other half in his mouth. "Who knew Malfoy'd be a good cook?"
Malfoy appears at the end of the aisle and Harry, without even thinking about it, steps in close for a hug. He wants to be held and Malfoy does just that, setting down the basket full of flowers he's holding to wrap both arms around Harry and rub his back.
Beside him the sheets were cool, and they didn’t have the slightest hint of Harry’s body heat. He peeked over towards the en-suite shower but that was silent too. For a moment Draco felt the race of his heartbeat, and he remembered another morning like this one, five months before. It was time to
Adrianne would be naught but Mother’s spy, but she’d always been his favourite elf, and would have followed him to Half-Moon Place before now, had Draco only have asked.
It’s almost too much.
“Honestly, I had my doubts, but this is an amazing place,” Harry said, looking out across the sands. “Whitsand Bay. It’s a long way from London.”
“And the sort that Harry and I shared was definitely the latter sort,” Draco smirked. “Bloody hell, but it was brilliant. The best snog ever. It felt like somebody had cast a Jelly-Legs on me. I'm only glad I was sitting down.”
"I don't know what to say. I mean, of course I remember it."
“Your next appointment is your official halfway point,” Hayes answered, closing Draco’s file, “and that means that you’ve got a decision to make before I see you next. Have you thought yet about finding out the baby’s gender?”
“Wish me luck,” Draco whispered to his baby, before knocking sharply on the green wood. It was time to fly, or get off the broomstick. Brew the potion, or douse the cauldron. Time to tell Narcissa Black-Malfoy that she was going to be a grandmother to Draco’s illegitimate, part-Potter baby.
"No power on this earth can do that, but I'll make biscuits for tea."
"What about you?" Harry asks.
It was the early hours of Sunday morning when Draco awoke.
"Utterly boring."
Harry chuckled at that, and Draco watched as Ron threw his arms around Harry, clapping him on the back, the pair of them laughing at their shared joke. Draco stood, uncomfortable, his hands wrapped around his middle in a very defensive posture, feeling like a Pygmy Puff in the den of a dragon. Usually, he was a fairly self-assured person, who owned the mistakes that he’d made as a child and strived to do his best he could. Now though, all of his confidence seemed to have deserted him.
"Are you not sure?"
“It can’t be
“Behave yourself, Potter.”
Restorative justice does sound complex, almost as complex and difficult to understand as Harry snogging Malfoy.
Harry's still setting the table when Luna Lovegood lands in the garden on the back of a Thestral. As she touches down, several more Thestrals of all different sizes follow. They stand with their unblinking white eyes, scenting the air and pawing nervously at the ground.
Ron shrugs. "I don't know. He was always good at potions."
He wanders over to where Malfoy is standing, staring angrily down at a bowl of flour.
“I’ll talk to him this week,” Draco finally answered. “He’s- he’s a good person. Honestly. Even if he doesn’t want to be involved, I’m sure I can get him to come and meet with you.”
Twenty minutes later Malfoy walks in with a tray set with breakfast and tea and even a little vase with a flower. Harry is actually speechless. Aunt Petunia used to make up a tray with soup and tea and biscuits for Dudley when he was sick and carry it to wherever he was watching telly. It goes without saying Harry got no such treatment when he was sick. And here's Malfoy bringing Harry a breakfast tray and he isn't even sick. It's breakfast in bed just because Malfoy
Indeed, the inevitable had happened only that morning. Harry had Apparated early to Grimmauld Place, planning to share a pot of tea before leaving for St Mungo’s. Their sixteen-week appointment was that morning, and Draco had felt eager to see their baby once again. They were the size of an avocado now, and their flutters had gotten a tiny bit more pronounced.
Draco arrived to the Manor doors exactly as he usually would, a prompt twenty minutes before lunch, and as always, he collected a large bouquet of fragrant hyacinths.
"Sure we do. Knock before you barge into our bedroom, yeah?"
Pansy smirked. “Narcissa Black-Malfoy is a wise witch and I’ve never known her be wrong about anything to do with you.”
"I don't hate it."
. He heard the small creak as the door opened, and he felt the press of Harry’s hand into the small of his back, encouraging him to step forwards. He took two steps, and then Harry took his hand, all warm and steady, radiating with care. “Okay,” Harry instructed. “Open them.”
“Merlin, no,” Draco cut in, wanting to cut Pansy off from that line of thought. “I wouldn’t touch McLaggen again with a ten-foot broomstick,” he said, wishing that his best-mate thought he had better self-esteem than to go chasing his foul, egotistical ex. Draco wanted Pansy to take him seriously. “The baby is Harry’s,” he said. “Harry Potter is the other parent, Parks. My baby is going to be a little Chosen One, Pans. A baby Saviour.”
Cedric reached up and ruffled his auburn curls back to a mess, despite his father groaning at the action.
Like Sirius and Remus.
“One day kid, you’re going to pick a fight with the wrong guy, and you ain’t going to get up from the floor he puts you down on. Not everyone’s your enemy.”
“I can’t believe you can’t get me out of this preposterous thing. It’s absurd. Saturday? The second Saturday of summer break? Who in their right mind schedules detention
Neither saw the glass of butterbeer lifted from the table.
He wasn't brave enough to do that.
Do that, Cedric.
Her father barked, head jerking to the side.
Like Albus and McGonagall.
Tock.
Never forget to smile, Cedric!
The type of frowning that came with a kiss from a fist.

Sneering, Lucius Malfoy indignantly brushed his shoulder with the crown of his serpent headed cane, swiping off imaginary dirt, as his son, Draco, frowning deeply, lip curled as he took a gander around him at the soot clogged stone, and the rusted signs.

doing what they promised. Then they turned their back and pretended to be deaf. Or asked how much it was to shove a grubby hand up your shirt. That was life, Harriet thought. A never ending trail of broken promises and lies.
“You’re a cunt, kid. A real bloody cunt.”
It was barely enough for this shingled roof over her head and a pair of socks.
However, that evening, the second Saturday of the summer holiday, brought only silence. The winding halls were empty. The countless paintings slumbering. The beds in the dorm rooms unslept in. No taps or baths burbled in the bathrooms. The Professors and students had left, homeward bound, far away from schoolwork, exams, lesson plans and studying.
Tock.
Simple.
Tick.
“You heard your mother. Well, go!”
“Bite me, bastard.”
She didn't need them.
It struck him then. Struck him like lightning strikes the ground, sizzling outward, zapping with a
Theodore checked his pocket watch.
Apart from one.
His father didn’t say goodbye.
Hermione Granger sat inside her father’s Volvo hatchback, hunched and huddled in the soft padding of the leather seats, staring blankly at the meandering road before them. A broad road that would lead Hermione up through Hogsmeade and to the castle on the cliff. Hogwarts, where she would spend the next nine hours.

With him.
Savagely, she bit into the pasty, grinning brightly with a piece of apple sticking out between her teeth, at the haggard man before her.
He turned to look, finding nothing and no one behind him, and missed the gloved hand sneaking to his plate, snapping away with his apple pastry.
“Oh, Abe… Are you getting soft on me? Are you really a sweetheart underneath that malingering tongue? That great big bushy beard? Someone call Rita Skeeter; I have a five pm headline.”
Draco swallowed down the lump forming in his throat. He didn’t really care about the detention, not as much as he had wined about in the last few hours, but-
Harriet didn't need

Draco hazarded a glance to his father, but Lucius, as always, didn’t meet his eye, much too entrenched in primping his pristine tailored robes from the short train ride. Merlin forbid there was a lock of hair out of place, or a bit of flint on his cashmere jumper. The world would end, surely, if a Malfoy was anything less than perfect.
Linda cocked a high arching brow at her through the rear-view mirror, cheeks flushing an irritated pink.
Even here, after ruining his perfect reputation with a detention, a black mark on the Malfoy name, something utterly

Linda Granger’s hands tightened on the steering wheel. Wringing.
His broken nose had been worth the split knuckles.
“I’ll make it up to you when you get home, son. I’ll leave some Galleons for shopping with Twinky. You can go get that new potion set you’ve been eyeing. However, I have to be in the Ministry in the next hour. I have no time to waste. Off you go. I’ll see you soon.”
Harriet threw her middle finger up as she left.
This pub, with all it’s noise, its shadows and dust and half-drunk dreams, was her home.

It was hard, so very hard, to understand which one he fell into some days.
Smile, Cedric!
With the Potter trust fund as tied up as it was in legalities, she didn’t have a single sickle to her name until she was eighteen.
Right
Amos shook his head.
Perhaps this is what he deserved, after what he did to that poor kid in the changing rooms of the Quidditch pitch. The scream, high, shrill…
And wasn’t that the sad truth?
Yeah, everybody acted the saint until it came down to
"How can you not know?"
“See,” Harry said, his breath ghosting over Draco’s neck. “Nothing to it. A bit like a potions lesson, but rather less deadly when you get it wrong. I think it’s about ready for serving, don’t you? Smells scrumptious. Good enough to eat.”
When they finish their morning cups Malfoy insists they get dressed and go shopping for pajamas, candles, vases, and flowers, in that order. Harry wonders if Malfoy will ever come over and not think of ten more things to buy.
"And the thing is," Harry says, on a roll now, "That hurt doesn't go away just because he's nice now. And a really good kisser. He's right that apologies and even changing and whatever else a person can do to be better, it doesn't actually take the hurt away."
Draco didn’t have an answer for that.
It's Harry's turn to look confused. "But they're all—" Harry waves his arms as if to say
where the shelves are covered in books — new and old, broken spines on most of them. Harry pulls a smaller story out, curiosity coursing through him, opens it to the dog-eared page and wonders if it’s his Other Self or Malfoy who has a penchant for reincarnation love stories.
"There's no Death Eaters here," Harry says, still feeling thick with sleep. "S'too nice."
Harry might have to confront the idea that Malfoy has been kind since Harry got here. That all the porridge and soup and biscuits and scones he gives to Harry aren't just obligatory meals because they're stuck together, but generous gestures. Malfoy might even enjoy these gestures. He might enjoy… caring. For Harry.
"I did not say

Ron gleefully takes a huge bite of the slice the moment Harry shakes his head no. Harry summons a couple butterbeers and they sit back with full bellies talking about Quidditch for the rest of the night. Harry doesn't have an answer to the Malfoy question but he does know he loves his best friend.
sound like that.
. This was going to take a lot of getting used to. His and Harry’s baby. Draco absentmindedly rubbed his tummy, just like he’d begun to do, occasionally, in the evenings or when he was wrapped up in bed.
Ron was up on his feet in moments, kissing his girlfriend and taking her coat, and Draco felt his happy mood drop a little. True, the Weasleys had been the epitome of kindness, but he’d been truly foul to Hermione Granger in the past. He was surprised when the witch didn’t go and sit with her partner. Instead, she marched over to where Harry and he were sitting.
Harry washes his hands and gets to work slicing crusts. After a thorough inspection of Harry's crustless slices, Malfoy asks him to peel the cucumbers. And after inspecting the skinless cucumbers, Malfoy apparently comes to the conclusion that he can trust Harry with basic kitchen tasks and supplies Harry with a steady stream of small tasks. Malfoy seems steadier now, in his element, and his directions to Harry are direct but not terse. Save the bread and cucumber scraps in this bowl, wrap the bread so it doesn't dry out, zest this lemon.
"And throw pillows."
“Bloody hell,” Harry laughed, jumping to attention and grabbing his wand. He slashed it through the air, casting a
"So? I was pretty happy for you when you got together with Gin."
"What about these? They're pink, I know you love pink."
"Who?"
"I had a few small trysts at Hogwarts before…"
"It's traditional."
He was still pondering Hermione's career over a second bowl of strudel – he
"Malfoy, huh?" Ron says, not looking up from the paperwork for three separate cases he's filling out simultaneously.
Draco rises early on Monday, eager to get to the kitchen. Today will be the first delivery of produce from the farm and Draco wants to sip his coffee and arrange fruit in bowls and smell every vegetable without Potter around to watch him. Not that he minds Potter in his kitchen, unfortunately it's quite the opposite, but he doesn't fancy being accused of fondling the cabbage.
“It’s referring to the baby,” Draco concluded. “Pretty gigantic bloody surprise, that. I’ve been thinking, and yes. I’m going ahead with the pregnancy. It’s entirely fucking terrifying, but there we are. At least I’ve got a few months to get used to the idea.” There was a moment of shocked silence, and Draco watched his two mates school their faces in a very Slytherin manner. Draco supposed that he had surprised them both, coming out with it like that without any warning. “Not even first in the gang,” Draco joked nervously. “Pans and Theo beat me to it. Parkinson will be vexed that I’ve taken the shine off her.”
"Never thought I'd see the day," Hagrid says. "Young Malfoy, servin' me tea."
"No," Malfoy says. "I won't be pursuing legal action."
"Fine," Harry says, defeated. "Fine, you should come. Just don't get mad at me when it's a disaster."
"Do you need help with anything?"
"No, git, why do you soft boil them?"
"I am not suggesting antiques, that would look absurd in a modern era flat. You need a throw blanket."
Harry laughed, a handsome sound. “That’s precisely the point.”
hadn’t shown Harry and him a pulsing dot. Instead, the spell had shown them a real baby – their real baby – who was changing and developing with every second that passed. This was real. This was as real as anything Draco had felt so far, and he couldn’t help but marvel at the miracle of it.
"Oh," Harry says again, not knowing what else to say.
Draco acknowledged her words, nodding his head low to show his respect and thanks, and the elf vanished with a click of her fingertips. He walked down the parquet floor, the clicking of his heels on the ancient wood still familiar from his childhood in this gilded, luxurious cage.
exclusive about Harry and he that she’d dropped her wine glass. Mrs Zabini had been visiting, and the dignified witch had fixed the smashed glass with a Reparo, whilst chastising Millie’s mother for being “so frightfully provincial – all the young people are scorning life bonds nowadays”. Greg snorted with laughter. “Of course, neither Mils or I had the nerve to admit that we already knew.”
. Fuck, but he missed Harry. Draco missed his tuneless voice, and his artless, warm sincerity. Silence was overrated. Silence could be dashed to hell.
Harry finds Draco in the kitchen and he seems to be in an especially good mood as well, that pleased little smile of his hardly leaving his face. He asks Harry if he wants coffee and Harry declines so he makes Harry tea. Then he sets two bowls of unfamiliar yellow mush on the table.
There are self-cleaning placemats and waterproof picnic blankets and ever-softer scarves and stain-resistant Egyptian elf linen kitchen towels and Himilayan dyed yak yarn sheets and of course, throw blankets. Blankets that promise ever-increasing softness and self-heating blankets and even some that are "smell resistant" which makes Harry wrinkle his nose thinking of what smells need to be resisted.
He was anxious about not to be sat around for too long in the waiting room, and potentially being recognised. He wasn’t naïve. His pregnancy would be outed eventually, but right now the last thing Draco wanted was his face emblazoned across the front of the
"These are pretty good. What poison did you use?"
“Let me hear you,” Harry demanded, voice urgent, and so Draco let himself be noisy. He made a sound that was too loud, too eager, and he felt himself blush all over.
onto the floor with casual abandon.
In the afternoon Malfoy gets an owl and starts arranging a full tea service. All the sandwiches and scones and tiny Lemon Cranberry Tart Tarts get set on tiered trays and Malfoy stands looking round the kitchen for a moment with his pleased smile until he catches on one last open cookbook.
It seemed like only a minute before Adrianne Apparated into the room.
The corridors are quiet as Harry slips through them looking for the long term care ward. Luckily the doors are labeled with patient names so Harry doesn't have to be a creep poking into other patients' rooms. Malfoy's room is at the end of the corridor. He sets a spell he learned as an Auror to alert him of approaching people and quietly ducks into the room.
Harry linked their fingers together on his hip, and Draco squeezed hard on to them, hard enough to hurt, but Harry was relentless. Fuck, but it was wonderful. Draco was sweaty all over, and he could hardly breath with the intensity of Harry’s unyielding rhythm. He bit his lip, not wanting to cry out, but Harry caught onto what he was doing.
“It already has,” Harry answered, reaching out to lay his hand on the jut of Draco’s belly. “Our magic is already combined in the most momentous way possible! Maybe we’re just running to catch up. Give us a chance, Draco,” Harry urged, looking at Draco with those big, too-honest green eyes of his, and Draco found that he couldn’t look away. Merlin, but Harry Potter couldn’t be good for Draco’s heath. His tummy flipped over and his head felt light. Raising his hand, Harry cupped Draco’s cheek. “Give me a chance to be the man you deserve.”
For his part, Bill looks totally relaxed (and unfairly hot, as usual). His hair is loose and his robes are unbuttoned, tight jeans on underneath, and he's got his hands in his pockets. He doesn't seem at all angry, like being around the mini Death Eater who let Fenrir Greyback into Hogwarts to maul him doesn't bother him.
"You should come, Malfoy," Ron says.
"Do you not like cooking it?"
Malfoy narrates his every thought while reading the menu, reading each dish description aloud and exclaiming over it.
“How do we do this?” Harry asked, voice low and eager. “I’ve never had to work around a bump before.”
"And I know you would never leave anyone to needlessly suffer."
"Hi," he says, blushing.
A couple of cloves of garlic follow the onions and then Other Harry is looking around the kitchen, eyes stopping on Harry. Harry knows he can’t see him, but it still makes him feel antsy. Odd. Watched. Just like earlier.
"I reckon you've done enough."
It’s not until Draco switches them around so he’s on top, kicking the duvet onto the floor as he does, that Harry is way too uncomfortable not to move from his half bent position. Carefully, (not that the couple on the bed would notice, the way they’re engrossed in each other) Harry slides the Cloak down until the edge touches the floor, and places his feet right behind the curtain of sparkling fabric.
"I had them custom made. I know a wonderful little potter in the Cotswolds."
, or whether the magical folk of Britain were just more forgiving than he’d ever expected. Either way, Draco felt humbled.
"Er—" Harry says. The truth is, he's not really sure. Harry doesn't usually take the time to think of how he is. "To be honest, I'm not sure."
"I told you it would take forever. It's a Friday night, Harry."
Harry waits a beat but Malfoy is silent. "Tell me their names then."
. I saw the hurt on your face, even though you hid it well from the Weasleys. I thought we’d ride it out, but when it came down to it, and I saw the words in print, riding it out wasn’t what I wanted. What I told Cuffe, I meant; you, and our baby are my family, and that means you come before anybody else.”
"Oh, hello Potter," Malfoy says. "I'm making porridge."
Malfoy smiles too. "Yes, alright. I want to try Muggle sushi. Can we do Muggle sushi? I brought paper money."
a stupid, hot-headed git,” Draco told the other wizard, “and yes, asking would have been the good-mannered thing to do… but they’re your baby too, Harry. Every bit as much as mine. I think the no-touching rule only applies to ancient old aunts, and interfering Diagon strangers.” He quirked a half-smile in Harry’s direction. “I don’t think it applies to the co-parent, as you called yourself a minute ago.”
"Not even a snog?"
Draco wasn’t a foolish wizard. He was sure that they’d been clocked the moment that they’d Flooed to Diagon Alley, and the milky-pink potion that they’d collected from the Apothecary hadn’t helped matters. The witch behind the counter had said, very loudly, that there wasn’t anything better for a wizard ‘in the family way’. Draco supposed that they’d have had their photos taken by now, and that it was pointless trying to cover himself, but he didn’t want to give them any more material than he had to. Harry noticed the paparazzi too and he moved closer, immediately protective and wary.
Be this, Cedric.
Destitute.
The meager throng of the Hogshead pub wearily eyed the teen who came tumbling down the stairs from the upper floor rooms for rent. Her clothes were tattered, second hand three owners ago, and swamped her in layers of scraps and ribbons of fabric crudely tied and stapled together. Her big black boots, scuffed at the toes, which looked kind of funny on such spindly legs, thudded on the unsteady parquets.
Homeless.
swinging.
Stop.
Aberforth shook his head, gruffly scoffing.
He hardly noticed Draco was gone.
Theodore spun to his parents, palms suddenly clammy, mouth opening, only to see them already turning, strolling away. His mouth shut with a click of clenched teeth. There was no point calling to them. They would only ignore him. They’d done what they saw as their duty, seen him, relatively, safely to school grounds. As far as they were concerned with their broken son, that was enough.
The train chugged to a stop in Hogsmeade station, the doors parting with a pop and a slap of metal. The two platinum blond heads glinted harshly under the morning sun as they stepped off in tandem, right into the deserted platform.
. Learn to lie once in a while, Cedric. It will take you far.”
Leave her like her parents.
that bounced around his skull. What if there were only seven seats in the library? Or three tables? Or only nine people? What should he do if there was-
Not so much.
He plucked it up, the parchment rustling in his grasp as the quill rolled on the table. Thrusting his glasses up his slanted nose, Flitwick read on, the flutter of his lips shifting with the words.
An essay.
Draco scoffed and turned away, sauntering off down the station, through Hogsmeade, to the castle waiting for him to spend nine hours of his life in the library.
He knew, just knew it, as he finally made it to the library, a little sweaty and out of breath, where his Saturday detention was going to be held, a whole thirteen minutes late, the worst, most terrible number there ever was, that day was going to be a bad, bad day.
Not until the muggle police had arrived after receiving a call from a worried neighbour rambling about the noise coming from next door, Petunia screaming, and hauled her into the back of their car, spitting and hissing like a pissed off alley cat. When they found her cupboard after a, once again, far too late welfare check by a paisley wearing social worker, that had been that.
He couldn't be both, surely?
Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry was a looming smear on the horizon of the Highlands, like a smudge of ink hastily swiped from a first year's end of term essay. Easily mistaken for a frustrated teardrop. A brute of brick and battlements, the seven-story high tangle of towers and parapets, which often resembled teeth and claws at dusk, was an ode to Wizarding might. Crumbled and nothing like it had been four centuries passed. Inside set forty-two staircases, swishing and twisting, and its bowels, where its dank dungeon laid like a gaping maw, burrowed deep into the earth.
Hermione scrambled out the car door, slamming it on her way out. She never, not once, let go of the throttling grasp on her satchel strap as she trekked the lonely muggle road to Hogwarts.
A quick nod from her father was all she got for the parroted line, something Hermione Granger was great at doing. A little crumb of recognition for a mimic. That's what she was. A copycat. An imitator. A two-bit impressionist. Nothing she knew, nothing she said, not even her thoughts, were ever truly her own, she believed. Always plucked from the pages of a book. A cheap fraud.
Harriet Potter stopped by the bar, butterbeer in one hand, pastry in the other, and a purple bruise blooming on her jaw from last night’s bar fight.
“We’re not allowed to use the time to study. The letter said so. We have to leave our wands at the reception desk of the Library for Flitwick, and take our seats and-“
“I told you if you keep that up, you’re out. I won’t have no trouble in here, even if my brother pays your room fee regularly.”
Orphan.
Perhaps one day he would shave the entire lot.
Cedric Diggory ducked back from his father’s wandering hand, as it went to,
“The last.”
What always came next.
“Yeah, mum’s already chewed my ear off, alright? I get it already.”
Cedric Diggory was a boy who already had his life planned out. He would finish school and start an internship at the Ministry, aided by his father’s contacts. There, he would slowly climb the political ladder. At twenty-four, he’d have a wife and a modest home. By thirty, two shit brained kids, one boy, one girl that he could bring out for the Yule postcards and forget about as soon as they were back out of sight. By forty, young for their kind, he would be the next Minister of Magic.
wrong.
“Is this the first or the last time that I will have to do this, Hermione?”
But no.
Like everybody left her.
"Kids."
Had been for the last six months, at least. Since she was kicked out of the Dursleys, after, so many years late, she had swung back at Vernon.
Stop.
Life was a drawn-out game of survival of the fittest.
Six was good.
Everyone always forgot that Honey Badgers were the only creature plucky enough, when prodded too far, to rip a bloody lion's balls off with their teeth.
Typically, Hogwarts was alive with sound. The hum of chatter buzzed off the towering stone walls in the corridors as students rushed to their next lesson in roving bands. The odd clang of a cauldron exploding adding to the beat. The bass the drawling scorn of Professor Snape tearing down another dithering student while staring down his hooked nose. The pitter and patter of house elf feet puttering in the kitchens, rushing to finish the evening feast. The bubbling of old copper pipes pulsing. The bellow of teachers standing in front of lecture halls trying desperately to keep the waning attention upon them. The click of laughter as a prank was played. Generally by some nameless Weasley in a long line of redheads.
"The light one is Bechamel and the dark one is Roux. Hello Mr. Weasley, thank you for coming," Malfoy says with too-stiff politeness.
Other patients come and go with various ailments, but Harry hardly notices. He's watching the door Malfoy went through and waiting for someone to tell him anything. He feels so stupid, thinking about how he sat next to Malfoy all day without noticing something was wrong. He should have taken him to the hospital this morning. He should have realized.
Take out decided and ordered, Harry wanders around the flat looking at the several bouquets on shelves and tables around the flat. Malfoy told him the preservation spells will last at least a month as long as Harry keeps the vases watered. Harry feels pretty indifferent to the ceramic casserole dish and measuring spoons Malfoy made him buy but the flowers feel both soothing and celebratory. A special treat he gets to wake up to every day. And Harry will never tell Malfoy but the rug does look better pulled out from under the bed more. Harry's whole flat feels peaceful and homey and
Harry leaves the store with a handful of shrunken bags, a mattress delivery time, and a delighted Malfoy who seems to have been greatly energized by the whole affair. Malfoy chatters about redecorating his bedroom now that he's no longer a "Wee Slytherin lad," (a phrase that sounds ridiculous in his posh accent) as Harry walks two blocks over to his new flat without thinking. As he comes to the building entrance he realizes he's just brought
"How do you know about buckwheat and kale, anyway?" Harry asks.
"You're right. You know, when I go to sleep at night I think, I should really be nurturing my hatred of Malfoy more."
Harry laughs, because it's true, Malfoy does throw his money around, but also because Malfoy apologized and Harry didn't even realize how much it meant to him that Malfoy make that effort. Neville can do whatever he wants with it, Harry doesn't need them to be best friends now.
"Let's get this straight, Potter. I have thought a great deal more about this than you ever will. You show up here demanding I look pitiful enough to satisfy your Gryffindor sense of fair and just retribution—"
"Did you make it?"
Harry laughs, breathlessly. "How about I just Disillusion myself and when the Healer walks in he'll just see your naked dick standing at attention."
“It does with me,” Harry replied leaning forward. Harry pressed his face down into the curve of Draco’s belly, giving their bump a kiss and making Draco gasp. It was an emotional moment, though it ended before it ever began.
"This is literally about justice," Harry says, throwing his hands up.
Draco pondered Greg’s answer. Goyle was the first to whine when he got a poorly belly, but the git was infuriatingly upbeat today. Draco lay on his side, trying hard not to think about chicken, potatoes, or any other kind of food. It was bonkers. Half the time he was ravenous, and the rest of the time he was sick to his stomach. Perhaps he had some strange Muggle bug, or maybe he’d caught the tail end of a hex without realising it. Draco promised himself that he’d go to the Healers at the end of the season, and he yawned, a new, sudden tiredness making his eyelids heavy.
"I want something cheesy. Like pasta."
"That's not what I said! I just wondered if your family made Indian recipes. That's not a completely illogical association to make."
Harry didn’t seem to understand Draco’s reluctance.
“Harry, I-” Draco began, trying to cut in.
"That is what I just said, very good Potter."
Harry was wearing the same jeans and purple Weasley jumper combo that he’d worn for Sunday lunch only the day before, so it was likely that he’d Apparated straight over there after dropping Draco back at Half-Moon Place. Harry, it seemed, had decided that he wanted to know the whole of magical Britain to know how ecstatic he was about their baby.
Harry thinks it looks best in the morning, with the sun shining through the gauzy golden curtains but Harry made sure to turn on his abalone Hedwig lamp and Malfoy stands in the middle of the room in the soft lamp light with his hands on his hips, nodding approvingly.
He smiles at Harry, that soft
Draco was scared, and he was overwhelmed, but in that single moment had known. He was going to go ahead with his pregnancy. That day, for the very first time, Draco had dared to touch his still-flat belly, and had dared to imagine the baby – his baby – that was growing within.
Amos Diggory huffed as Cedric shouldered passed, storming away, hands shoved deep into his pockets.
The woman about to take a sip from her butterbeer spluttered as her chair leg was kicked, slamming down the foamy glass to yell at the man behind her, who was balancing on the back legs of his own chair.
Eat this, even if you hate it, Cedric.
Too Hufflepuff, his father always complained.
Yell at him. Ground him. Take away his broom. Perhaps even clap him up the back, talk about all the times he had detention when he was in school at Draco’s age, or… Or… Just be
Harriet propped an elbow on the bar, bowing over to Aberforth who diligently wiped down his glasses with a dirty rag.
Worst still was that word.
So did knowing when
odd and even.
He stood there, alone, in the frigid breeze, staring at the white face until it struck a minute later. Then he rushed all in one, determined to get to the library, or as far as he could, before the odds came back and ruined everything and made him late and-
He argued back, mouth full of breakfast, spitting bits of toast.
From the backseat, Hermione’s head dropped, sagging, as wilted as her voice.
In Theodore Nott's world, there was no grey.
Professor Flitwick smiled.
He sloped through the tables, around the lofty stacks of books, dipping through the alcoves of the grand library, where, sitting innocently on a desk, he found what he had been searching for, though the other four were missing.
, can’t you talk to Flitwick? Explain this is some sort of mistake? Do… Something.”
“Hey, don’t be like that, Cedric. I messed around when I was younger too. Many kids do. Except you got
, right now, this second. You waste that, and you have no hope of ever becoming Minister of Magic, as you should. The kids alright, a few bruises and scrapes, nothing Pomphrey couldn’t heal. However, what won’t heal so easily is your reputation. You need it
Aberforth scowled at her.
The problem was she hadn’t
“Well, when you get there use the time to study. You have seven exams next year, and two in foreign languages I signed you up for.”
6:27 am.
Some days, it felt like his chaotic hair was the only thing he
straighten out the rambunctious curls on his head, squashing them down to strict, perfect order.
Theodore Nott stood beside his parents outside Hogwarts courtyard, thumbing the silver buttons on his new blazer. Six buttons. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.
Nevertheless, her mother, as she was prone to do, picked up where her father left off.
The fucker hadn’t taken to losing his hand of cards too well.
