"You're not wrong," Snape responded dryly. The sound of feet scrapping in the hallway signified that they were out of time. Standing, he moved to unlock the door to the classroom. He could see the question in Draco's eyes as he moved passed him and he responded with a nod. He would continue to search for Narcissa and pass on any information that he found.
"It's not just some bond, Harry," she responded with a sigh, taking the spot beside him. Someone had to tell him what he was getting into and if the High Lords wouldn't do it than she supposed she was just going to bite the bullet, as they say. "You'll never be bonded to anyone else. You and your friend will share two halves of one soul. He will take on some of the Elven traits until he's fully bonded to you. His ageing will slow. His senses will gradually increase. When this is all done and over with, Draco will be your Mate. He will be the submissive to your dominant. Forever."
Harry nearly choked at the word "mate" and his gaze snapped from Hendrik to Gabriel to Draco, whose jaw had tightened to the point Harry thought it might shatter. What he wouldn't give to have the floor open up and swallow him whole. "He's not-" Harry stuttered, making a waving motion with his hand that really didn't have any distinctive meaning. "Draco. Just call him Draco. Or Malfoy. Or whatever he wants." Snapping his mouth shut, he jerked his eyes away from the obvious disaster and focused on the table in front of him.
"Then I'm afraid you will have nowhere to stay as this is a school and we are not equipped to offer you a palace of your choosing."
From behind him, Draco could practically hear the wolf's claws digging into the earth as it pushed itself forward into a run. It had no intention of allowing its prey to escape. Unfortunately for Draco, there was very little he could do to change its mind. His only saving grace was the closely knitted trees. Had the creature been able to run full out, Draco would have already felt the sharp sting of teeth ripping through his skin. Of course, by keeping to the most obstructed path through the forest, Draco was also finding it harder and harder to keep his own speed.
Harry had received the summons that morning, arriving somewhat sullenly to the library where he was to meet Soren. The older elf's sigh was laced with exasperation at the sight of the bruises and cuts, but didn't say anything. They'd already spoken on the matter and changing Harry's mind on being healed wasn't a battle that he was going to win nor did he really have the time for it. Short of tying the boy down, he knew there was little that could be done. There were more important matters to be dealt with; matters like the Werewolves. The Alpha had returned the day before and the continued procrastination was starting to deteriorate the situation even more.
"That's a shock," Harry responded, his own tone dry, earning a raised eyebrow from Soren that he chose to ignore. Perhaps it was still some lingering anger over the attack on Draco, but Harry couldn't find it in himself to like the man sitting across from him. He could respect the man's authority among the pack, given the loyalty his fellow wolves showed him, but that was as generous as Harry wanted to be. "Ask."
Moving further into the room, Harry met the eyes of each Council member, offering them each a nod in greeting before taking his own seat. Lothair, Soren, Ilaria, and Draco were already seated, which left Gwynn to take up the position behind him. She had originally attempted to remain in the hall, but Harry had refused to allow it. If nothing else, she was a calming presence that he was going to use in order to get through this meeting. She was a calming presence that he had no intention of doing without from the remainder of his time here. As she took up position, Ilaria raised a delicate eyebrow and glanced in his direction. It wasn't surprising that she had picked up on the significance of her position, she was the one who assigned members to the guard; the only ones who stood in that position. Offering her a subtle nod of his head, he answered her question. He was sure they'd have a discussion about it later. He wasn't naive to think he hadn't stomped over a wide variety of regulations in this bout of selfishness.
He wasn't sure what made him think of it, but an idea started to form. "But, I think I have a better idea," he muttered, changing directions and motioning for the others to follow him. It was an insane thought, but it had potential. No one, save a small collection of people, were aware of it and only two people could freely access it. One of them was Voldemort, but Harry was willing to bet someone would notice him before he got there.
Harry frowned. He was really tired of getting the third degree about this. What else was he suppose to do? Let Draco die? He'd never be able to live with himself if he didn't do what he could to help. He didn't understand why it had to be him to supply Draco with the needed blood, but if that's what he had to do than that's what he had to do. Hell, he didn't even know why he kept calling him Draco. "I'm saving a life, Gwynn. What more do you want from me? He needs my help."
"Because you've been here before. You have a connection to this place," he commented. "Furthermore, your magic contains traces of humanity, dragon, and royal elf."
"Nothing," Harry responded, wiping the grin off his face. He wasn't going to point it out to the blonde. He was sure he'd be more annoyed when he discovered it himself.
The dry tone didn't go unnoticed and Harry glared at him. "I want you to ensure that there is someone in the guard who we can trust to fulfill ... covert assignments."
For a moment, he just watched her. Saeya. Her hair was a deep red. Not the Weasley's sort of red but like a wave of blood pulled back from her face into a long braid to reveal the pale skin of her neck where the tip of a scar showed above the collar of her jacket. The mark itself was roughly an inch wide and looked as though the wound had been jagged. He wondered idly what could have happened, barely registering the fact that she'd turned her head to return his stare.
"Remove the sleeping spell you placed on him," Lothair instructed, glancing at Akkar. The other Elf nodded and switched places with Saeya who had been at the head of the table. With a glance up to make sure the others were ready, he placed a hand back on Harry's forehead and removed the spell. The moment the magic faded away, the screams started again.
Draco's heart was racing and he barely heard her words, his eyes still focused on the sword in his hands. He'd never felt anything like that. It had felt powerful and his skin tingled with excitement at the thought that what he'd felt was simply the swords own strength. He had yet to add his own strength to it.
"There are seven elemental bases in natural magic. Earth, Wood. Wind, Fire. Water. Ice. Lightening. Every creature who draws on natural magic has a core that stems from one of these bases. Earth is the most common with Lightening being the most rare of the six. Earth connects us all, while lightening is hard to control and unpredictable," Lothair explained, the way he spoke told Harry that he'd gone over this a million times in the past and he found himself wondering what exactly Lothair did in the Realm when he wasn't hunting down ignorant Dark Princes in the mortal world. "Each Element has a weakness and an advantage."
Draco briefly met Soren's shrewd gaze before dismounting and making his way across the gap between them to meet with Snape.
Daemeon nodded in agreement, flicking considering eyes to Harry. After a moment, he pushed away the counter and moved to one of the display cases. After a moment, he returned with a sword in hand. Just by looking at it, Harry could tell it was well crafted. The metal gleamed even in the low light and he didn't need to touch it to know the blade was sharp enough to split hairs. When Daemeon held it out to him, Harry glanced briefly to Ilaria before taking the weapon in hand. It was different than the shortsword they had been using in training. It was a bit longer and somehow lighter. Despite the fact that he had never held the likes of it before, it felt strangely comfortable in his hand.
"Where did you want to go then?" Harry asked, somewhat gruffly. He really hadn't been expecting anything more than that, but still a part of him had half hoped it'd be something a little more meaningful. He'd clearly lost his mind, since this was Draco Malfoy he was talking about.
"Now, now children," Lothair snorted, leaning forward on the table and resting his chin on the palm of his hand. "Let's have a grown up discussion shall we?"
With a hesitant look to Soren as he rolled up his sleeve, Harry climbed up onto the spot beside Draco. As he'd assumed, the spot was not nearly as large as he'd been hoping. As he settled back against the pillow, his left shoulder was flush against Draco's. With the changes his inheritance had created in him, Harry noticed that rather the two of them were now roughly the same size. Before Draco had towered over Harry's smaller stature and now the only difference between them was the slightly wider set to Harry's shoulders. As he settled a part of him hoped that Draco's appearance wouldn't change too much. He didn't want to go back to being inferior. He liked the idea that they could be equals both mentally and physically.
"Yep." Harry nodded, as Draco began to put the pieces together. As they reached the end of the corridor, it opened up into a huge room. The last time he'd been in there he hadn't noticed the sheer size of the place. He'd been much too busy trying not to get himself and Ginny killed. "Welcome to the Chamber of Secrets."
For the first time in two days, Harry showed an emotion other than indifference. "Wait," he frowned, "I'm not going to have to wait for another century, right?"
It was a good question, Soren had to admit to that. He had watched the Elven heritage skip over generation after generation only to surface in the most unlikely of characters. There was no rhyme or reason to its pattern. The Fates themselves choose who would inherit and who would continue to live among Wizarding kind. Their reasons were their own. "It was your destiny to be where you are now."
Lothair shot the blond a dirty look and Harry was slightly glad that he wasn't the target for once. He did, however, have to admit that he was curious about the elements. The sword was still clutched in his hand and he could feel the cool kiss of the wind against the back of his hand. The sudden urge to fly was tugging at him and he had to force himself to focus back on the conversation at hand.
"The swordsmith," she grinned, turning on her heel and heading for the door as thought that was all the answer he really needed.
It was a simple statement of fact, but it made Harry bristle slightly. "I'm not afraid!" he responded, immediately. The moment the words left his mouth, Harry knew it was a lie. He was terrified of what was going to happen. He was afraid of the repercussions. No one could assure him that everything would work out for the best, though they tried to do just that through their smiles or quiet comments. They were all just as worried about this as Harry, himself, was. All except Soren. He was the one pillar of assurance standing within the storm of Harry's raging emotions and doubt.
Harry raised an eyebrow. Now he wanted to know about weapons? Those injuries must have damaged his brain. That was legitimately the only plausible answer. "Why do you need to know where the armory is?"
"Well, you are certainly not a complete loss," she finally responded, her gaze moving back to his. Despite what could have been perceived as harshness, there was a certain tenderness in her eyes and smile that cushioned her comments. "He's a bit spindly, but I'm sure I can whip him into shape in no time at all. He has excellent balance, I'll give him that much."
His jaw clenched tightly at that, but he nodded his understanding. Severus was correct. If her body hadn't been produced, chances were he was keeping her alive.
Draco bit back the curse. Dumbledore was a bigger manipulative fool than Draco had previously thought. For whatever reason, he guessed that the old man had an idea about why Draco was in the company of the Elves. He probably didn't have the whole picture, but enough of an idea to try and use it to his advantage.
"Have you not accepted your responsibilities as the heir to the throne?" Faelyn asked, long silver hair braided loosely and hanging over a delicate shoulder, her lavender eyes piercing him. Under the weight of her stare, Harry felt like he was being exposed.
Reaching the main room again, he put out a call to draw back the rest of the guard before heading into the kitchen. Draco had Harry laid out on the table, the few items that had been on there now scattered across the floor. Not for the first time did he regret having made this ridiculous trip.
With that the serious look shifted to amusement and for a moment Harry felt himself relax. It didn't last long, however, as the man straightened from where he'd been leaning casually against the counter. He had to be well over six feet and three times as broad as Harry. The definition of his arms told Harry all he needed to about whether or not he could use the weapons he created. Aside from his size, Harry noted the long dark hair pulled back into long braid, a common fashion, but he could have sworn it was blue. A deep, deep blue.
Many of the visits to Poppy had been a direct result of the blond laying in the next bed. Whether it be hexing each other or full out physically fighting, the two of them were forever being sent to either detention or the Hospital wing in direct consequence of their actions and short tempers. This time, however, Harry couldn't pretend that it was just another day. He couldn't pretend that they would be all healed up and sent on their way. He couldn't pretend that things were going to simply go back to the way they'd always been once this was all over. Things would change and Harry just hoped it would not be a change either of them would regret.
"Damn it!" he cursed, his hands coming up to catch himself, effectively scrapping his palms on the rough stone beneath him.
Before the situation could deteriorate further, Dumbledore took a step forward, breaking the Auror's focus on her cousin. "Greetings. I'm pleased to see both Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Potter are in good health. Their absence from their respective communities have been strongly noticed."
Dragging Gwynn along with him, despite her continuous blushing and stammering that she was not allowed into his private bathing room, he'd led her back through the manor. Asking one of the servants to find something for Gwynn to wear, he left her in the woman's capable hands before disappearing into the hot spring. It was beautiful really. The moment you stepped into the room, it felt like you were outside with the sun shining down on you, warming your skin. Rocks jutted out from the far wall, as though the entire room and been built into the side of the mountain, and cascading down in layers. Trees grew without a care to their surroundings, providing some privacy and a feeling of tranquility as the water was circulated and filtered through three levels. The lowest level had a large pool of water, starting shallow before deepening gradually. A small rock cut lined the far side, providing a ledge for individuals to sit or jump off of, if the need arose. The second level contained three smaller, more personal, size pools. Each was separated by space and foliage that they granted the user some semblance of privacy. The final level was Harry's favourite. There was only one pool located here and hidden by falling water, that cascaded from the top of the rocks to fill the pool just below it before trailing down to bring fresh water to the pools below. It was gorgeous. With falling water on one side and gleaming stone on the others, it was the perfect retreat from the world.
He could vaguely hear Lothair laughing and Gwynn's concerned tones asking if he was alright. Pushing himself up into a sitting position, he sat there for a moment taking stock of himself. He was pretty sure this was what it felt like to be electrocuted. "Yeah, I'm fine."
"It's been four days since we were brought here, Soren. Nothing has been accomplished. Your pup doesn't even have the common courtesy to set aside time for us. It shows little respect for the alliances between us."
"We'll take these two," he snapped, taking the leads from the hand of the very startled stable hand, the snapped words sounding much more like a demand then Gwynn, or anyone else for that matter, was used to. He hadn't spent much time outside of the Manor and when he did, Harry was usually in the company of one of the three High Lords.
Harry almost sagged in relief. None of this would work if Lothair didn't agree to help him. "Once we're back in the realm, we'll go to Gringotts-"
He could barely get the air into his lungs as he forced himself to keep running, his lungs burning as they desperately tried to fill. The water was much louder now, the sound almost deafening. Nothing, however, was going to drown out the sound of the creature behind him. The pounding of paws against the earth, claw scrapping, and a sound far more terrifying then anything he'd heard yet: the howl of the wolf. If there were others in the area they would be on their way. Even if he managed to escape one, there was no way he was going to outrun more of them.
It would have been wise not to answer, one might suppose, but in this case it didn't really matter. The unlucky messenger faced the entire ire of the Elf alone and cowered beneath his own fear and the dark look in his Lord's eye. It did not bode well for his survival. "He wasn't alone. The High Lords arrived only minutes after he did, with the full extent of the royal guard. Lothair, particularly, looked enraged by the whole of it. It's not unwise to choose your battles and that was one we would not have won."
"Harry is more than welcome to come and go as he pleases. The borders of our lands do not keep him confined. Should he wish to see those he cares about, he has the freedom to make that decision."
For a moment Rosalind pondered on how best to approach this topic but it was soon clear to her that honesty was the best course of action, particularly since they would not be informing him of the nature of the bond he'd be creating. When things came to light, it would be better if only a small portion of information had been kept from him. "Unlike yourself, his changes are not going to be spread out over the course of weeks. He'll experience everything rapidly, which will go hand in hand with physical discomfort and pain," she admitted, though not giving him a moment to protest before she continued her explanation, "In his unconscious state, however, he should not be aware of it unless he regains said consciousness. It is, however, highly unlikely that he will. I don't expect him to awaken for several days after the procedure. His body will need the time to heal and stabilize his magical levels."
"Now that we're all friends," Draco drawled, turning away from the table and heading toward the door. "I'd hurry up, Potter. You have potions first thing!"
Ahead of him, the entire group turned to look at him with varying expressions. Crabbe and Goyle gave him what he was sure were supposed to be a threatening glare, Zabini was eying him curiously, and Pansy ... well, he didn't really want to think too much on the look she was giving him. Draco, however, just looked bored.
Gently taking the letter from her, Harry scanned the front immediately recognizing the handwriting. Ron. He very nearly groaned at the recognition. He had expected something like this sooner or later, but he had not expected it to come in the middle of the day while he was suppose to be sleeping soundly. Setting the letter aside, Harry flopped back onto his bed. Having left the window open, Harry could feel a light breeze drifting into the room and bringing with it memories of his earlier dream. The dreams were getting more vivid as the days passed. He had been so close this time. The name had been right there, just out of his reach. With the interruption of Ron's letter Harry was now back to the beginning with nothing other than a few hours of missed sleep.
"Also," Lothair continued, "Keep in mind that these bracelets only conceal your magical abilities. Your physical abilities are still quite present."
Coming up them, Harry gave a wave and a quick "Yo!" before plopping himself down unceremoniously at the work table. Propping his chin on a hand, he glanced between the two of them with a curious look.
It would not be difficult to buy the man some time. With everything that had happened since the attack in the forest, Harry's thoughts would be far from them. The boy had a lot on his plate and even more ready to be placed upon it. Deep down, Soren knew that Harry wasn't the sort to relish in pain caused to others. He would understand, if not like, the need to put this on hold. For the next little while, Draco would be his immediate concern.
There was something like pain that flashed through Harry's eyes at Draco's words and despite the satisfaction he assumed he'd feel at the win, the feeling that clawed through him wasn't satisfaction. Far from it.
"The swordsmith?" he asked, moving to follow after her, his curiosity peaked. "Why do we need to go to the swordsmith."
human," he responded, his voice taking on a hard edge that left absolutely no room for argument. It was a tone that one might expect from the ruler of a Kingdom, but sounded strange coming from Harry's lips. "And you will do well to remember that." Harry was slightly horrified by the declaration.
The force of it sent everything around Harry shooting backwards, Draco included. He hit the floor several feet back and rolled. With the initial impact he'd released the hold on his own sword, It landed several feet to Draco's left. Any clatter it might have made was drowned out by the roaring in his ears. Instinct had him rolling into a defensive crouch in case Potter had anything else to throw at him. It took a moment to spot the brunette through the dust still floating in the air.
"You don't think the wounds will heal, do you?" he asked, looking away from her and back to the prone form on the bed. Could that be the truth? Was Draco going to die after all, despite their efforts? Was he going to have to stand there and let it happen?
Gwynn just blinked in response. That was the second time he'd said that and she still couldn't wrap her mind around it. Harry said it as though it was something that happened everyday. Sure, perhaps blood transfusions in the Wizarding and Muggle world were no big deal, but this wasn't either of those places. There blood wasn't the same as Wizards and Muggles. There was so much more to it and she was positive that Harry didn't understand what he was doing. "You've got to be kidding me? Soren agreed to this? Rosalind agreed to this?" It just didn't make sense. There was only one time in an Elf's life that they shared their body or blood and this didn't exactly seem like a bonding ceremony … at least none of the ones she'd witnessed. This was just … wrong.
Harry barely had time to get the sound of Soren's name from his lips before the Elf had raised a hand, apologized for a third time and disappeared down the hall, leaving Harry standing alone in the overly large hall looking just as small as he currently felt. "Well that went well, didn't it?" He muttered, more than a little sarcasm slipping into his tone. Taking a moment, Harry glanced around taking in his surroundings. There were several doors leading in various directions. He had no idea where any of them went and he certainly had no idea where he was suppose to go. Soren had said that he could go wherever he pleased, but Harry still felt slightly like he was trespassing. As it were, he figured he had two choices. The first was to stand around looking ridiculous in the entrance hall or move forward into the Manor. At least with the second option, he didn't think he'd look as awkward as he currently did. If he was honest, he was a bit hungry. Perhaps if he wandered he might stumble across the kitchens. He hoped he didn't have to tickle a pear or something equally as ridiculous. The last thing he needed was to have Lothair find him tickling various paintings.
"A pleasure as always," she commented, her tone somewhat dry as she stared at the slightly open door.
you walk away?" And that was the real question. She may not have know Harry as long as others had, but it wasn't difficult to see the answer to that question. Not with the continued presence of this Voldemort fellow in Harry's thoughts. He couldn't walk away from this world, just as he couldn't walk away from that one.
It seemed Harry's emotional core was linked to his emotions. He really shouldn't have been surprised. Potter had always been emotional. With that last taunt, it was like a window had been opened to let a strong breeze. The loose stones and dirt on the packed down training area seemed to shudder as the air rolled over its surface. Draco wasn't sure how Potter was going to manipulate his element, but it was building rapidly around them. Nothing seemed to be happening with his sword, but that didn't mean a damn thing.
Harry's screams hadn't stopped and Draco could barely hear her over them. When she repeated it, he nodded and tried to pick him up. The moment Draco touched him, his screams increased. "I can't move him!"
Draco dismounted beside them, shooting Gwynn a dark look. "Leave him," he snapped, unable to control the irritation that was suddenly swelling up inside of him. "It's his own damn fault he's sore."
It had grown even more complicated when he'd read over the papers for the vaults. There had been regular withdrawals from one of the smaller vaults for the past six years. The first one coming from the date he'd started Hogwarts. He'd never been told whether or not he had to pay fees in order to attend Hogwarts but given the frequency and amount of the withdrawal it seemed off. He'd wanted to ask Draco about it, but had refrained. He couldn't bring it up to him just yet. It was too soon.
Said storm, however, didn't so much as stop to notice the difference. Without a word or a backward glance, Harry continued his walk forward, turning down the corridor that Draco knew would lead him back to his own suite and disappeared from sight.
"What are your plans, Lord Soren?" The owner of the deep voice was a man with which Soren was very familiar. Avery was but one of the High Generals. He was a man that Soren, himself, had appointed to the position and one Soren knew would rather die by his own sword than betray the realm. Such loyalty was difficult to find, but quite easy to trust.
"Spindly?" Harry asked, his eyebrow rising, His indignation went unnoticed, however, as Lothair's voice cut across their conversation. Lothair had just stepped back into the room, which was a surprise in and of itself. Only a moment ago Harry could have sworn he'd seen the other Elf standing beside Soren.
"But if you were to take a guess..." he trailed off, hoping for some sort of insight. Honestly, he had no idea what to expect. The only interaction he'd had with werewolves was the brief interaction with Remus when he'd transformed in third year and that wasn't exactly the best memory he had.
After a moment of collecting his thoughts, Harry tried a different route. "Are you positive that there is no other way to save him?" If there was some way that didn't involve taking Draco's choice from him, Harry would gladly accept. Who else would know of the possibilities if not the elf standing in front of him. Like Dumbledore before him, Harry looked to trust him implicitly. Perhaps it would turn out to be a mistake in the end, but Harry needed that assurance if he was going to find within himself the strength to face all of the responsibilities and obligations that were facing him not only in this current situation, but also his role as ruler. He needed to have someone to trust in when everyone else was looking to him.
"What?" Harry gaped. Even without looking at him, Draco could feel the questions burning into the back of his head. He had, after all, basically said the opposite back at the Manor. If truth be told, he didn't give a shit about continuing his education, but this was the opportunity he needed to find out the truth and he was going to take it. Ignoring the brief flash of guilt from his actions, he continued.
Never had he considered the possibility of finding a place more beautiful than Hogwarts. To him, Hogwarts represented far more than just a pretty landscape and architecture. It was the first place he had truly felt at home. It wasn't until Hagrid had taken him from the dismal life of a despised Muggle had shown him a world of magic and wonder that Harry had first felt like he was coming into what he was truly supposed to be. He was meant for more than being a servant. He was meant to have friends, family, and he was meant to feel loved. With all the emotions and wonder that had been tied to his very presence at the school, Harry had never thought that anything could challenge it's hold on him, but the moment he had stepped through the entrance of Jade Manor he'd known he'd been mistaken. He was well aware of the fact that he had never before stepped foot into this manor, but as his footsteps had echoed and bounced off the stone walls Harry had felt a strong sense of familiarity fill him, pulling at his very soul and wrapping him firmly in a warm embrace.
With just that little thought, he could almost feel the blood from his dream coat his hands. He could almost imagine it dripping from his fingers to stain the pristine tiles beneath his feet.
With the mystery of the first door solved, Draco moved to the left, stopping at the door in the center. Reaching out for the handle he found this door also unlocked. With a slight twist of his wrist the door unlatched and he easily swung it open.
A snort of derision escaped Severus at those thought. Hogwarts wasn't safe. He'd made the mistake of believing otherwise and had ended up under the control of two separate individuals intent on doing anything necessary to get what they wanted. For the youngest Malfoy it was, unfortunately, him that they wanted. The silver lining to this new rain cloud was that Severus now had the ability to focus all of his energy on finding Draco. He refused to believe that his potion had failed. He hadn't failed to brew a potion since his second year. It was incomprehensible. His potion had worked exactly as he'd designed. It had fused with the boy's body, making him a temporary port key. What he'd miscalculated was what destination Draco's subconscious would choose as the safest. Wherever it was, Severus had been unable to locate it. He'd known the boy since childhood and still he couldn't track him. It was both a relief and a worry. If he couldn't find him, than both Voldemort and Dumbledore wouldn't be able to either. However, having been the one to administer the boy's blood replenishing potions, he knew exactly what Draco faced without them. The boy was loosing blood faster than his body could naturally replace it. His injuries did not bode well for his survival. And that did not bode well for Severus Snape's sanity.
Draco only smirked, his eyes still on the sword. "How do we imbue it with our own magic?" His thoughts were already turning. He wanted to wield the sword as it was meant to be wielded. He could feel it vibrating through the steel, the desire to be swung.
He had barely processed the fact that Gwynn was worriedly calling his name, a hand placed on his shoulder. She sounded far away, muffled and distorted. The images were gone as quickly as they had come, but two aspects were clearly burned forever into his senses: the smell of oranges and blood.
He sat for a moment, letting the information settle. If Lothair had gone that meant Soren and Ilaria would take the time to mobilize their defences accordingly. With the Prince gone, the coronation would be put off and the protective wards of the city would remain penetrable. That was good news on its own. Made things much easier.
"I apologize for keeping you all waiting," Soren greeted, nodding his head to the Alpha before moving to take a seat to the left of the last empty chair.
Lothair raised an eyebrow as Ilaria laughed and slung an arm proudly around Harry's shoulders. "You're not as dumb as you look, after all."
Harry winced, noticing the flare of anger immediately. So he'd been right, Draco was angry about the changes. "You were hurt. I had to do something otherwise you would have died!
Harry frowned. This felt like a bad idea. Even if he somehow managed to do what they needed to be done, Dumbledore was sure to know about it and he was hesitant to let the man know their full capabilities. Lothair had already demonstrated that they could bypass his magic, which was telling enough. It was best for all of them if they kept the truth of their abilities to themselves.
For a moment McGonagall looked confused before she shook her head. "Not that I'm aware of." She was going to ask why he thought there might be but some sort of cloud seemed to pass over his face before he was gone.
Sooner rather then later, he was going to receive a summons he simply wouldn't be able to refuse. As it turned out, sooner was far earlier then he'd ever expected.
"Unacceptable!" Ilaria barked, the familiar authoritative tone dripping from every word. "As future members of the Royal Guard you are under oath to follow through on the orders given to you by your superiors. While the Prince is in this training environment he will be treated like an equal member of the guard!"
Prying his eyes away from his own sword, Draco found that Harry had moved to the other side of Lothair, his own dark box sitting on the top of the wall. He hadn't opened his own box, instead watching as Draco had opened his. Only with Ilaria's urging did he make a move to lift the lid. A part of Draco thought he was almost hesitant to do so, which earned a frown.
Gwynn was hard pressed to imagine any of the High Lords fawning over anyone, let alone some recently turned mortal. The thought would have been entertaining had it not been the serious look on Harry's face. His insecurities were surprising. She had assumed that he'd moved past it, but perhaps all he had done was hide it within himself. She watched him for a moment before she rolled her eyes, reached out, and smacked him upside the head.
Harry watched as the blond disappeared through the door, a slow grin spreading across his face. He'd take that as an acceptance.
As though sensing his glare, Draco glanced up meeting Harry's eyes and smirked. Refusing to stare at the idiot any longer, Harry glanced away to glower murderously at Ron's tie. Sometimes, Harry really just wished he'd left the idiot floating in the river. Of course, whenever, he thought about such things, the pressure in his chest intensified so any pleasure he got over it was quickly erased.
Soren took the opportunity them to speak, but Harry wasn't listening. His thoughts had drifted inward. On one hand, he had these new agreements to contend with. Both those made to Oriss and Faelyn had the opportunity to become something much worse than Voldemort. As for Kolvar, Harry still wasn't sure what to make of him. What would the Dragon's be getting from all of this? Even with all of this running through his mind and all the dangers it could pose to both himself and the realm, Harry's thoughts went further into himself to poke at this new sense of magic within him. He'd broken into Ehlark's mind. Not only that but he'd influenced his decision. He didn't know how, exactly, but he had done it.
Reaching the appropriate corridor, Draco indicated the doors further down. "There's several suites further down the hall," he instructed, not really caring about which one the wolf would choose. He had enough things to worry about without adding the man's living arrangements to them. "None of them are occupied, so take whichever one you want. If you need anything specific, just ask a staff member. They'll get it for you."
Harry didn't have to lift the arm from his face to know who was standing at the foot of the couch. After the embarrassing scene in the conference room, he'd bolted back to his own suite and was currently sprawled out on the sofa with a rather prominent air of disgrace. He figured someone would show up sooner or later. "Go away."
Dumbledore's eyes shifted from his internal planning to settle on his headmistress, Minerva McGonagall. An old friend, but one he could not necessarily trust. She had grown fond of Harry and any threat to him would set her firmly at the boy's side. A disappointing outcome, but it was one that he had foreseen. His own plans were best kept close to his heart until he no longer needed her services. It was a dangerous game he was playing, but it was one that he fully intended to win with as little damage to himself as he could manage.
"Damn it," he groaned, his good arm reaching out toward the nearest tree to brace him self. His panting breath echoed loudly in his ears as he closed his eyes, attempting to gather up the strength he knew he didn't have. Perhaps if he rested, just for a moment-
The sudden stop of the wolf beside him had Draco's limited attention focusing on him, a raised eyebrow and an impatient look shot his way.
Despite all his efforts, Draco stumbled again, hitting the dirt. All his hope instantly drained out of him. He couldn't force himself to get back up. Curling in on himself, Draco waited for the pain he knew would be coming. The creature would only take seconds to reach him. When nothing happened, Draco tensed all the more. Turning his body, Draco found the creature standing a foot away from him with saliva dripping from its open mouth as its nose sniffed the air and its ears twitched. After a moment, it's attention returned to Draco's bleeding form, a deep growl reverberating through its chest.
Draco wanted to protest. He wanted to deny the fact that he needed any of their help, but the fear of what might still be lingering from his experience with both his father and the wolves lingered at the back of his mind. He knew his Father had not dared do anything too drastic to him, lest he be killed before the Dark Lord could have his fun. This did not, however, apply to the wolves. They frightened Draco the most. He'd felt his skin tear beneath their sharp claws, the memory fresh and agonizing. He could not be sure that he had not been bitten. The image of a rather shabby and tired looking Professor Lupin appeared before his eyes and Draco relented, nodding his consent.
Harry noted that he had only mentioned exports, but kept his irritation in check. It didn't really matter what the lot of them currently thought about the Wizarding world. For the moment, they had gotten what they had needed out of them and that was enough. "Of course," he nodded his agreement. He doubted that agreement would prove to be as harmful as the earlier one would be.
Now that they had all been seated, Soren took the opportunity to begin. For several long minutes, Soren went about the process of formally introducing those sitting around the table. Harry, for his part, nodded in respect and did his best not to shift in his seat impatiently. It was a trivial moment and done for no other purpose but to say that it had been done. They knew who he was. He knew who they were. Hell, with the way Faelyn's eyes focused solely on Draco as though dissecting him where he sat, he was going to go ahead and assume that they knew absolutely everything that had occurred since Harry's own arrival in the realm.
For a moment there was nothing but a thick silence, Lothair meeting the eyes of both Soren and Ilaria respectively. Ilaria nodded immediately, something in her stance told him that she already knew of what Lothair was referring to. Perhaps it had started before they had arrived or perhaps she simply could read the other Elves far better than Harry could. He barely knew them after all. Lothair for his part held out longer than his female counterpart. After a long moment of silence he nodded as well, an impatient sigh slipping from his lips. He didn't like being interrupted. "Very well, then."
"Why didn't you return to school, Harry?" This time it was Remus. He didn't bother looking toward any of the Elves surrounding him, his eyes went straight to Harry. Draco, despite not having any affection for the man, could at least appreciate his need for a response directly from Harry.
"They offered me a towel." She snapped and Harry was surprised to see a bright red flush spread across her irritated features. "Just a towel!"
"Even she won't be able to fix this," Lothair scoffed. Ilaria had her ways but he honestly doubted her ability to create something that simply wasn't there. It was clear to him that the Potter boy did not want the responsibilities he had been given. Nothing, not even Ilaria, was going to change that.
"They're barking at our borders," Hendrik snapped, his attention focused on Soren as he waved his hand in Harry's direction, "Demanding we bring the boy."
"Scared," Ilaria taunted, twisting her wrist and letting her hand slid down to the end of the lance before sweeping it quickly out in front of her and sending a blast of hot air at Lothair, who barely managed to block the worst of it with a string of colourful curses.
"A wizarding war," he sneered, using a lazy motion of his hand to wave off the threat, "Inconsequential."
By the time Harry made it to the great hall for dinner, he was still fuming and cursing the blonde idiot he'd bound himself to for all of bloody eternity. Well, maybe not eternity. That was a bit dramatic. They weren't immortal. They could die. They would die ... eventually. Eventually seemed like a very long time right about then.
There was a surge of confusion that came up and wrapped itself around Harry's irritation. Realizing too late that the confusion wasn't coming from him, Harry pulled back quickly, releasing the hold he hadn't realized he'd had on the other Elf. He'd influenced Ehlark. The look of surprise and slight horror that flickered across his face was enough to tell Harry that he had hit the mark.
Harry didn't respond to Ron's shout, but Draco glanced briefly in his direction with an annoyed look. Things were already tense without that brainless oaf jumping in. At the arrival of the Gryffindors, Crabbe and Goyle moved to block their way, which had the redhead drawing his own wand and pointing it at them.
Draco hadn't cared one way or another about what Lothair was saying to Dumbledore, his eyes had immediately scanned the head table for the Potions Master. Finding him in his usual seat, their eyes bore into each other. Draco's demanding answers to a million questions but getting nothing in the way of answers. He wasn't hungry. He wanted to speak with Snape. That was the whole reason he was there.
Unbothered by the darker atmosphere, Harry moved along with ease until he came upon the group in question. "Malfoy!"
Pushing aside those melancholy thoughts, he stood, sticking the wand into the pocket of his sleep pants and tugging on a t-shirt. Heading out of his room, he wandered down the hall into the main common area. It was still as empty as it had been the night before but he wasn't overly concerned about it just then. Hearing some noise from the kitchen, Harry headed in that direction. Pushing open the door, he found everyone else inside the large space.
Harry wanted nothing more than to turn and taste the lips that tortured him so expertly. He'd never wanted anything so badly and yet he simply couldn't make his body move. The touch of those hands on his hips had secured him firmly in place, leaving his desire to burn helplessly within his chest.
Harry groaned deeply at that suggestion, momentarily forgetting his discomfort. "We're not in the middle of training!" he grouched, crossing his arms over his chest petulantly. He might sound like a brat, but he was
Besides, he wasn't entirely stupid enough to wake someone up in a pitch black room he wasn't suppose to be in. Even Potter (or maybe especially Potter) was likely to hex first and ask questions later. Draco wasn't entirely looking to have a hole blown through him all because he'd decided Potter needed to be useful for once.
Things were not falling into place as they should and his patience was being strained far past the point of safe return. Since the Potter brat had arrived within the realm, his plans had been gradually going astray. First the outburst brought forth by Lothair's barbed words, then the disobedience of the wolves, followed by the failure of destroying the beasts. Slowly, things were falling into place for the High Lords and their wayward orphan. The entire thing only served to boil Roland's blood.
Reaching his horse, he silently mounted and retook his place in line. He would offer no comment here. If Harry wanted to rant at him, he could do it later. It didn't matter now.
Harry might not have believed her words, but Gwynn stood by them. They were the truth. It didn't matter how irritating this Malfoy was or how much he didn't want to be a member of this realm. He was there now and he would have to fall into line like the rest of them. That was all there was to it. "Come on," she urged, hopping down from her own position on the wall, "I'm starving. Let's go to the kitchens before all the good stuff gets put away for the night." Despite living outside of the Manor, Gwynn was quickly becoming accustomed to meal times and the access Harry had to the kitchen. Food here was just so much better than the stuff her Mother dared to cook.
"Oh that," Draco smirked, "Well, that's simple. No one knows I have enhanced senses and physical abilities that surpass the ordinary student ... at least more than usual."
"We apologize for interrupting your meal," Lothair greeted, lowering his head slightly in greeting once he had stopped in front of the Head table. "We had planned to arrive earlier but we had some unexpected delays."
Even from where Harry sat, he could feel Lothair's exasperation. "You're such a freak," he muttered, summoning his own weapons; twin single handed onyx battle axes. Harry started at the sight of them. They were beautiful. Across the black steel were flowing silver lines and the handles were covered in braided dragon hide. They looked heavy but Lothair held them as though they barely weighted anything.
"It's not difficult to get sensitive information if you know how to listen, Harry." Gwynn responded, sending him a smirk through the strands of her hair that had been caught up in the slight breeze.
Lothair straightened, lifting an arm to brush off his forehead. Whatever they had done had taken a toll out of them. All four of them were sweating and breathing heavily. "What the hell was that?" Draco asked, pushing off the wall where he'd been standing.
Ilaria sighed, drawing their attention. "There's a darkness in the Prince," she started, letting her mind move through the images that rose to the forefront, "I've seen it rise up during his training only for him to force it back down. For the moment, he's been successful at keeping it controlled, but I can't say he'll continue to be so. There's something preventing him from facing it completely. He forces it down and ignores it. If this boy is what he needs to final take control, then I agree with Soren. The transfusion is needed. If he continues as he is, I'm afraid that darkness will overtake him and all will be lost."
"Molly Weasley is beside herself with worry. Would you deny her the opportunity to see that he is safe from harm?"
The question caused Harry to pause in his thoughts of Draco. What did it mean? It seemed to transfer over boundaries. No matter where he went, he didn't seem to be able to avoid it. "It means he comes from a family of Wizards. His bloodline has never been mixed with a non-magical bloodline." He wondered if this would be appealing to her, to the others here. Was he the outcast because of his Mother's bloodline. They all seemed to condemn those like Roland because of their mixed bloodline. Would they do the same for him if they found out. His eyes sought out Gwynn and he watched her take that in. No disgust or pleasure flitted across her face and for that he was grateful. He didn't want to have to defend Draco against the only friend he really had in the realm. In fact, she really didn't look all that interested in the matter.
Harry nearly jumped out of his skin at the weight of Soren's hand settling on his shoulder. Returning his slightly widened eyes toward the Elder, he found an understanding smile on the face of the other elf. "To every good there is a negative. That is what balances the world around us," he responded, giving Harry's shoulder a reassuring squeeze before releasing him. "It's the weight that goes with every significant decision we make. What you have to decide, Harry, is whether or not the good outweighs the bad. Perhaps he will respond negatively to what we've done, but is that enough to change your mind? Is that enough to make you decide that he is better off left to his fate?"
Dumbledore smiled at them as they entered the room, his twinkling away as they usually did. There was no sign of anything out of the ordinary but Harry couldn't help but tense up. What he knew and what he thought he knew was at war and it was difficult to keep the tension from building.
The longer he stood there, standing in front of the full length mirror that Rosalind had been so kind to bring him, Draco was finding it harder and harder to find himself. He didn't recognize the image reflected back at him. After Potter had stormed out, the High Lords had taken their leave as well with the promise to return at a later hour to continue their discussion. In that time, he had tried to gather himself. With Rosalind's help, he was given new clothes to wear. Gone were his wizarding fashions. Even if the tears in them been reparable, they still would not have fit his new frame. Instead, he was dressed much the way Potter had been. Dark trousers, the material soft and light as they seemed to comfortably take the shape of his hips and thighs before falling down to pool at his feet. The tunic covering his chest was a light blue and felt strangely soft against his skin. A corded belt had been added at his hips. He had been given boots as well, but Draco felt strangely more comfortable with his feet bare. These clothes were not his. In fact, he didn't know who they belonged to and, yet, he felt strangely comfortable in them.
Even Draco was caught a bit off guard, blinking stupidly at Harry before he managed to shake off the daze. Sheedra, however, seemed to be completely immune to it as she just continued to glare at them. After several long moments, she finally uncrossed her arms and went to retrieve three plates. Setting them down, Draco didn't miss the fact that Harry's plate seemed to have a good deal more heaped upon it.
Harry ignored her, eyes closed and listening. There was something wrong, he could feel it. He just couldn't pinpoint it. His eyes snapped open when there was a sudden point of pressure before it was released directly at them. Reaching out, he shoved Draco back as whatever it was hit him square in the chest.
Unlike her normal collected self, Gwynn fidgeted anxiously in place as she watched Harry turn his mount toward the exit with a sense of experience she knew he didn't have. She had two options. She could either take Ilaria's horse to follow Harry or she could not take Ilaria's horse and let Harry face whatever he was rushing toward on his own. With a frustrated huff, Gwynn pulled herself up and onto Nyx's back, urging her to follow after Harry and Erebus. If nothing else, Nyx would be able to successful keep up with the powerful strides of her brother.
This time it looked like Lothair was trying to restrain himself. Harry highly doubted anyone had spoken to the Elf like that in years, if ever. As it stood, Lothair was still one of three holding reign over the Kingdom and, as such, deserved respect, but Harry just couldn't find it in himself to offer him any. He realized he shouldn't have run off, but they'd barely gotten there in time. Hell, he wasn't even sure if he had gotten there in time. Rosalind and Soren had taken Draco into the other room and had not come out since. He had no idea if the blond was alive or dead. It was a horrible feeling not knowing. He felt like he was balanced precariously on the edge of a knife, just waiting for a strong wind to push him over.
"Deal." Faelyn responded, before Harry could counter the argument. Leaning back in her chair, she smiled. The look was serene, but somehow Harry still felt as though they'd somehow lost the battle. For a moment, he thought about trying out his new found ability to see what she was thinking, but unlike the rest of the people sitting around the table, he couldn't hear the faint whispers of their thoughts. Not even when he focused solely on her could he hear them, which meant she had some sort of shield up to protect them and the slight sense of danger tugging at his awareness told him that she'd know the moment he tried to prob any closer.
Never before had his Mother mentioned the prospect of him becoming a Death Eater. When his Father had discussed it with him, she had always been a silent figure in the background: never agreeing and never disputing. With her voicing his own fears, Draco could feel the emotion building in his chest, a lump forming in his throat and his eyes smarting as he realized that she meant to say good-bye.
If his hands weren't otherwise occupied, Draco was pretty sure he'd have taken the time to offer Potter a particularly rude gesture. As it were, however, his eyes scanned his opponent, taking in the details and calculating his potential movements. He wasn't going to assume that Potter wasn't doing the same thing and, frankly, he didn't have much interest in losing to the Gryffindor.
Harry watched the two, completely dumbstruck as Draco seemed to relax under her attention, even going so far as to look pleased by her praise. Instantly, Harry's irritation returned. How dare she be so easily accepted when he'd been the one to rush head first into danger. He'd been the one to pull him out of the river. Glowering darkly as he watched the two, he failed to notice the darkening of his eyes or the brief flicker of the lights as his energy spiked angrily before settling back down.
Harry really wasn't entirely sure what had happened, but the way Lothair had said "human" sparked something inside of him that immediately reacted to the other Elves words. Lothair had spit out the word as though it was the most vile thing to have ever left his lips. A part of him that Harry hadn't even been aware of rose up angrily. It was a protectiveness that he'd never felt toward anyone and he couldn't even begin to fathom why he was suddenly feeling it toward Draco Malfoy, of all people. Whatever it was, the look in Lothair's eyes and the words that spilled from him had Harry classifying him immediately as a threat and there was an almost animalistic urge to destroy that threat. He could feel his teeth elongating and digging into his bottom lip. He might have actually taken a swing at the other elf had the growl that rumbled through his chest not snapped him out of it. He hadn't been expecting the sound and it was enough for him to grab a hold of his senses and hang on. A corner of his mind told him that it shouldn't be humanly possible to make that sort of noise, but he pushed the thought aside. His anger was still there, burning hotly beneath his skin, but he'd lost the desire to tear Lothair to pieces. It was still difficult to think that he wasn't exactly human any longer.
Silently they moved forward until they reached the tree line blocking the borderlands from view. Carefully, the group spread out to move through it, the three High Lords ahead of Harry, Draco, and Gwynn. The rest of the guard fanning out on either side. They made their way forward, through the dimly light woods until they breached the edge, stepping out into the murky light of dusk and into the sight of the five Wizards awaiting them.
"There was a mortal," he stuttered, his haste to please the murderous Elf in front of him evident in the slight shake of his hands. "A boy. The Prince chanced the river in order to save him. He barely paid any attention to the wolves or what was happening around him. Word in the forest has it that the boy was taken to the castle and the Wolves second in command is there as well, by order of the Prince. The Prince, apparently blames the Alpha's pack for the condition the boy was in when he was found."
"It is my responsibility to ensure their safety. Having them isolated on either end of this castle may be convenient for you, but it is not for me."
Draco had every reason to hate him for what he'd done so there really wasn't even an opportunity to feel sorry for himself. He'd deserved the beating and because of that he had refused to go to the infirmary and have his wounds healed. Two days later, the dark bruising on his face was still present. This, however, did not keep the wheels of the manor from turning. While the halls seemed to whisper about the attack on Harry, there were still whispers of the Manors unexpected guests. The Werewolves were still present and Soren could no longer by any more time.
"I've been searching the Manor bit by bit," he admitted, with a tense glance to the blonde, "but I haven't found or heard anything that might lead me to believe that she's there."
It was simple. Harry would return even if all three of the High Lords pressed for him to remain in the Elven realm. The boy would return because everything he had grown fond of he had found within Hogwarts and the world of Wizards: his family, his friends, and, most importantly, his responsibility.
"Why does the Wizarding world not talk about it or even acknowledge it? This is the first time that I've heard such a thing."
"I didn't mean to startle you," he insisted, quickly holding his hands up to show that he wasn't armed and had no intention of harming them. "Honestly, I was just-" Harry's voice trailed off when their eyes shifted to a spot over his shoulder. He watched as recognition flared in their eyes and their weapons were lowered. What surprised him most was that all three immediately dropped into a position of submission, their heads bowed and their arms crossed firmly against the smalls of their backs.
After another moment, he nodded, pulling up what little courage he could muster, and said, "Alright. What do I have to do?"
Ginny chose that moment to slip into the spot beside him at the table, leaning in to murmur. "Ron asked Hermione out when she was staying with us," she responded, the amusement more than evident in her tone, "but Hermione didn't feel the same way."
"You have your own agenda," Harry shrugged. "And it's obvious that your presence here is hindering that agenda."
Harry had to bite back a laugh at the disdain in Lothair's comment. Clearly, an hour or so spent at the Head table had not changed his dismal opinion of Wizards. Draco, however, didn't bother to hide his smirk of amusement and for a moment he was irritated that Draco seemed to get along with Lothair better than the blonde did with him.
At this, for the first time in years, Severus felt a tendril of fear wrap around him, "Without assistance, Draco won't last the night."
Rosalind remained silent for a long moment, considering her answer. "I honestly can't say for sure. If any of the wounds were caused by the creature's teeth there is no way to prevent it. From what I can tell, the wounds on his back were all made by claws, however, I cannot be certain that no saliva entered into his blood stream. He's much too weak to run the necessary tests to find out." She paused again turning her eyes back to Harry and offering him that same small, hopeful smile. Even with the reassurance, Harry couldn't help but notice the hint of sadness around the edges of her eyes. He'd never been the most aware person out there, tending to be quite oblivious to things sitting directly in front of him, but he couldn't mistake that look. He'd seen it often enough to take it for what it was.
It was all but impossible to see Roland's movements with the naked eye and even having the enhanced sight of a werewolf didn't allow the messenger enough of a chance to block the silver dagger that flashed toward him. It's blade easily sliced through the thick cords of muscle and skin of the wolf's neck with a hiss of burning flesh, the smell fouling the air around them and the last lingering cry of the wolf as it's eyes glazed over with death. "I will choose your battles!" Roland sneered, jerking the knife from it's victim with a sickening sound. He wasn't nearly satisfied with the kill and it only took a second for his eyes to snap to the messenger's second, narrowing at the sight of the much smaller wolf. "You! Tell me how the Prince knew of your location."
"Whatever it is you're accusing me off, could you knock it off?" Draco asked, his tone bored. He hadn't even bothered to look over as he'd said it. He hadn't needed to. His increased senses were screaming at him that Harry was glowering at him and he could practically feel the accusation in the stare. What he was being accused of, he didn't know, but he was sure it was bound to be something stupid given who it was silently accusing him. "It's irritating."
Prior to the change of his body, he'd always felt a rush when he held his wand. It'd been alive and now ... now it felt like deadwood in his hand. There was the tiniest thrum of magic at its core but that was it. It was sad, really. It had been his companion since he was eleven. Hell, it was the first thing he'd ever been given that signified that he was someone special. Now it was nothing.
"This is ridiculous!" he grumped. "I've only just got here. I couldn't possibly have done anything yet to warrant being kicked off the team."
"Come on," she urged, reaching for his arm to haul him back up into a standing position, "You just need to stretch your legs a bit."
Grinning, he took a big bite of his eggs before he realized the other two were looking at him. Glancing up, he found both of them glaring at him. "What?" he asked, raising an eyebrow.
If nothing else, Soren was glad to see the sullen and gloomy look finally leave Harry's face ... even if his anger was only a frustrating complication to the situation. "True, however," he countered, "we were all unaware of your connection to Draco until after the fact and, despite any dislike you have for the situation, the wolves are allowed to hunt any creature who enters the realm without permission, humans included."
For Molly Weasley, the letter her eyes were now scanning was not what she had been hoping for when Dumbledore had stated he had received word on Harry. She could hardly make sense of the sentences she was reading. Surely, this was nothing more than a silly prank. It had been almost two days since Harry had first disappeared from his Aunt and Uncles and those two days had been some of the longest she had faced in quite some time. She may have only six biological sons, but Harry had become the seventh the moment Ron had brought him home. It was only natural to worry about the poor dear. Of course, that wasn't the only thing she was currently finding herself worried over. She had spent the last several days doing her best to keep her biological children out of harms way. Harry had built a connection with her four youngest and every one of them wanted to run off to look for Harry. The very last thing she needed was to have all five of them missing. She really didn't think her heart could handle it.
Gwynn moved to reach for his hands, but Harry pulled away, tucking them into the sleeves of his tunic. "It's fine," he commented, a cord of steel in his tone that left no room for argument. He didn't want to talk about it. Not his hands or Draco. Whether Gwynn recognized what had happened, he didn't know and he wasn't keen on finding out. "Let's go."
Gabriel nodded at his instructions, his bouncing between the doors in his line of sight. After a moment, he turned his attention back to Draco and smiled brightly, catching the blond off guard. "When I first met my mate, she kicked my ass too," was all he said before he sauntered off down the hallway, leaving Draco to stare after him. The comment his to make of it what he would.
Harry hadn't glanced his way. Not once. Draco had expected him to explode the moment Dumbledore and the Order were gone. Hell, half the Elves with them had probably expected it. That's what Harry did. Instead, he'd silently turned his horse around and started to head back without so much as a word. Gwynn had shot him a look that he hadn't quite been able to read before following along, leaving Draco to fall into position beside Ilaria. She, at least, didn't look like she was going to try and kill him. If anything, she looked as though the entire meeting had not bothered her in the slightest. Of course, that really didn't mean anything. He had the feeling that if she wanted to kill someone they'd be dead before they even realized that they were in danger.
It was his sense of smell that returned first, filling his nasal passages with the nauseating stench of blood and causing his stomach to clench and roll violently in an attempt to expel what Draco knew wasn't there. The sharp movements caused by his body's dry heaves served only to remind him of his injuries as pain flared through his shoulder, a low groan escaping through his abused vocal cords. Through the haze of pain, he did manage to do a quick inventory of his injuries and was relieved to discover nothing he hadn't already been aware of. His location, however, took much more time to determine. The last thing he could remember was Professor Snape forcing potions into him. There had been a certain level of pain moving through his body, but he couldn't be sure that he could associate the pain with the potions. He'd been in pain prior to ingesting them.
Tightening his hand around the hilt of his sword, a light breeze ruffled his fringe and Harry smiled, that nervous energy shifting into a sort of calm. Like the first moment of a Quidditch match. It was the sudden quiet as you push off from the ground, the wind whipping around you and the sound of the crowd fading away as you waited for the whistle to signal the start of the game. "When have I ever been frightened of you?" he shot back, the sword in his hand felt comfortable even as he dropped slowly into a defensive position.
If he had to describe it. It was like touching a bubble. For a moment, his magic settled against the surface, electricity skittering over the edge for a tense moment before it seemed to pop and magic flooded out and around him. It wasn't anything like what he'd felt the first time. This was warm and swirled around him like leaves caught in the wind.
for pressuring me to write more...well, to be fair she hasn't pressured me yet, but if I start slacking I know she will. On a more serious note, I'd like to ask all of you who read this story to keep their eyes out for any discrepancies. A lot of the story was written over a long period of time and it's difficult to remember details I mentioned in earlier chapters. I have gone back and reread up until this point, but that doesn't mean I won't miss anything. Lastly, don't forget to review and let me know what you think. I appreciate constructive criticism.
Draco glowered at him. "It'd be sneaking if you hadn't practically invited people in with all the unlocked doors. Furthermore, it's not the middle of the night. It's morning. Therefore, I'm obviously here to get your lazy arse out of bed, so get up!"
The sudden surprise, laced with a hint of fear, that sparked in Potter's eyes when he noticed Draco's presence sent a flash of approval through the blonde. The approval mixed with a flash of guilt at the sight of the still rather prominent bruising on his face. Any emotion he'd been showing quickly turned into a scowl when he realized he was actually feeling guilty. The prat had deserved it. He shouldn't be feeling sorry.
The moments passed at an agonizingly slow pace as they made their way back to Jade Manor. The thirty minute trip felt like eons and not once did Harry lose that closed off look. Not once did he unleash whatever storm was brewing behind that new stony mask of his. If it didn't frustrate him so much, Draco might have actually been impressed.
The image flickered out as Roland moved to glance over the maps spread out on the table in front of him. Things were progressing nicely. Soon enough, they'd be ready to move.
"I was under the understanding that you had received my earlier communication," Soren commented calmly, as he dismounted from his horse. It was a means to show respect by putting them at a more even level. The rest of the group, however, remained firmly on horseback. Even Harry kept in his saddle, though he looked like he wanted to hop right down and run over.
Harry briefly considered whether or not he would classify that as a dig at his less then satisfactory defensive skills. He didn't, however, get much of a chance to decide. When he finally opened his mouth to respond the only thing that slipped past his lips was a loud gasp of unexpected pain. A white hot stab of pain shot through Harry's entire body, bringing with it a flash of images Harry barely had a chance to process, leaving him with such a strong sense of panic coursing through him that it left him struggling to draw in his next breath.
A small, amused smiled pulled at Rosalind's lips. The rivalry that was between the two of them was something that amused her. It reminded her of just how young the two of them were. They might have been of legal age in the human world, but within this realm the had much more to see and learn. "I cannot speak for the Wizarding world, but in this one, Harry is of great importance to us all. It is not what he has done that earns him our loyalty. It is the promise of what he could be that allows us to hope, but we'll discuss this at a later time. For now, I'd like to discuss the markings on your back."
"That depends," Harry's eyes had remained downcast but when Soren spoke it drew them upward to meet his own. "What is a failure but a lesson learned?" Since they had entered the library Soren had remained relatively quiet, which Harry had assumed was a means to give him some time to digest the information he was being presented with. As Soren reached for another volume from the shelves Harry realized that he had arrived at the wrong conclusion. "I am under the assumption that you have never before heard the name Alethea Caroline Durham, am I correct?"
I will 100% admit that Harry's being a brat. Lol. He has a tendency to do that from time to time. Though, in his defense, I will say that his emotions are being influenced by a bond that neither he or Draco really understand at the moment. Since it wasn't activated the normal way, the two aren't completely synced just yet and it's causing a wee bit of chaos. Hang in there for a little longer.
"Alright, you two," Ilaria clapped, motioning them toward the middle of the training area. Harry glanced back feeling somewhat wasn't like he hadn't trained with other people. He trained with Gwynn all the time and Ilaria let him join in on the training sessions for the younger guard members. It was just that ... well ... he was a little nervous to be facing off against Draco when the other had a sharp object in his hand. He couldn't ignore the fact that Draco had a much longer reach and a drastic advantage when it came to physical strength. While Harry had gained a more wiry strength, Draco had gained strength beyond that.
tired of waving around a series of ridiculous weapons. "Can't we do something other then training? No swords. No Bows. No discipline. No Orders. No training! This is suppose to be our leisure time and you've got us out here slashing away at each other with sharpened swords." He held up his hand to show her the small cut on the back of her hand, as though that alone should make up her decision. "Don't you ever just relax and have some fun?"
He watched as Draco and his group of Slytherins moved toward the door, having already finished their dinner. In comparison Harry had barely touched him. His appetite had suffered beneath the weight of his emotional turmoil. As they slipped through the door, Harry's body tensed enough that Hermione took notice.
"Tell me," he muttered, watching them from within the shadows with cold eyes, "did you bind her to you as well? Is that the plan? Create your own little shield of people who can't escape?" It was an unfair accusation, he realized, but he was beyond rational thought just then. His life had changed so drastically in such a short time and his anger had grown so rapidly that he latched on to the first opportunity to lash out.
Draco's amusement was put on hold instantly, as the presence of four unfamiliar individuals was noticed. His eyes swept over them, looking for any signs that they meant to harm him. None were familiar. They weren't the Order and Draco automatically glanced past them to look for Dumbledore. It didn't make sense the old man wasn't around there somewhere. He'd never let his precious Potter out of his sight. The nervous look in his eyes may not have been noticeable to most, but Soren could see it as though the boy had verbally admitted to it.
"I'm sorry, Potter, but the decision has already been made," McGonagall commented, offering him an apologetic smile. Like Harry, she was also a fan of the sport and she understood the disappointment he was feeling. "If you have any suggestions on who to promote as Captain, I'll be more than happy for the input."
"Oh for the love of Merlin, Ron, they never said when they would be arriving. They only said that they would be," she hissed at him. "What am I supposed to do? You're already sitting here whining about it. No point in us both doing so!"
Harry had experienced the Cruciatus curse before, but this was something else. This was much worse. He barely registered the fact that his screams were echoing off the stone walls of the corridor. He barely noticed Draco leaning over him, calling him. It felt like every nerve ending in his body was being stripped bare and lit on fire.
Ilaria shrugged, unconcerned with Harry's slight embarrassment. "Consider it a very practical coronation gift."
"She is part of your history," Soren explained, turning from the window and the dark view of the horizon to focus back on Harry. "Had you been raised under Elven law as is custom, Lady Alethea would be very familiar to you. As it were, this portion of your education has been sorely lacking. To put it simply, Lady Alethea is, by Elven Customs, your Great Grandmother."
As if to respond to that statement, Gwen easily danced around Harry's sudden thrust, smacking aside his blade with the flat side of her own and throwing off his balance. It was easy from there to use a foot to tangle up his own, sending him sprawling forward into the stones.
In all fairness, Harry thought it could have been a possibility. How was he to know that Hogwarts didn't have a mouthpiece? A moment ago he hadn't even known there were different types of magic in the structure. Shooting Draco, a look of annoyance at his snickering, he turned back to the statue and closed his eyes. It took him a moment but he managed to drown out the sound of the others around him and buried his consciousness into his core, finding his own pool of magic. He and Soren had been working on this briefly but it hadn't been to rearrange a magical structure. They'd used it as a means for him to become familiar with his own magical core.
When he opened his eyes, everyone was staring at him. "What?" he asked, glancing down at himself to see if he'd done it wrong but didn't find anything strange or out of place. Glancing back up, his eyes met Draco's and there was something there that he couldn't quite read.
"And why would a property in the Wizarding world be of any use?" he asked, arms crossed over his chest and looking no closer to being on board with this than he had when Harry had first started talking.
The two of them, Soren and himself, were currently sitting among the rather impressive shelves of Jade Manor's library. Harry had never held much appreciation for the written word but even he could not ignore the sheer mass of knowledge that currently surrounded him. It was a dream taken straight out of Hermione's subconscious. The rich mahogany shelves ran the entire length of the room, jutting out from the walls to circle the heart of the room. Each set of shelves stretched from the floor to the vaulted ceilings. Every title imaginable – including several Harry decided weren't – lined the heavy wooden columns. Wizarding, Elven, and Muggle authors rested side by side in a continuous collection of knowledge. The single book that had drawn Soren's initial interest had been located at the very heart of this massive collection, resting safely on a thin marble column. The leather bound volume was by far the largest book Harry had ever laid eyes upon and contained within it the answers to all the questions that had been tugging at the corner of his mind. His entire family was in that simple volume of bound paper and leather. He'd struggled with his lack of family for so long that the description of what it was like to have all the answers laid bare before him was beyond what he was capable of.
Surprise spread quickly among the group, but Harry let out a breath of relief. "Remus. It has to be."
Given their late arrival, there weren't any desks left together and the three of them separated. Ron immediately took the spot open beside Dean, which left Harry and Hermione to find seats with the Slytherins. Given Snape's favouritism for his own house, most of the seventh year Slytherins had taken the course. In comparison, not even half of the Gryffindors had followed suit.
It was strange to feel so comfortable sitting on bed in a hospital wing. There was a great difference between Madam Pomfrey and Rosalind, but the similarity of the two situations had a strangely calming affect on him. How often had he sat in the Hospital wing at Hogwarts? The place had practically become his home away from home. Most would not find the smell associated with a medical ward comforting, but to Harry it was. It meant he'd survived...even if it only for a little longer. It was about as close to being safe as Harry had ever felt, which was saying a lot about the state of Harry's life up until then.
"No," Lothair murmured, his thoughts drifting as he walked, "The castle offers far more protection, even if it isn't perfect."
The comment earned a sharp look from Draco that had Gabriel holding up his hands. "Already mated," he chuckled, "I was just saying. He has a lot of free energy. That's a rare thing in these parts."
The melodic laugh that escaped the small Elf was not the reaction Harry had expected. He'd expected an argument. He'd expected Soren to insist or Lothair to demand it.
Harry lay there, listening to the sound of Draco's retreating footsteps, the blond's question still rolling around in his thoughts. Why had he forced this on him? Had their been a real reason or had he just acted on impulse? Gwen had dropped to her knees beside him, asking him if he was alright, but he just laid there. Lifting an arm, he dropped it over his eyes, blocking out the bright stars above him.
From somewhere behind him, he could hear that woman screaming at him; pleading for him to stop. Harry lay underneath of him, his arms limp at his sides. He was a mess; nose broken for a second time, right eye already swelling and bruised, split lip, and more blood than Draco wanted to admit spilling. A part of him was shocked at what his own reaction. He hadn't meant to take it as far as he had. He'd just ... the anger had just taken hold of him and he had lost himself to it.
His snotty insistence that he could take care of himself had been greeted with full blown laughter. Apparently, it wasn't every day that the Commander of the realm's army laughed so loudly. Every single Elf within earshot had heard her and come to see what was going on. As a reward for their curiosity, they were able to witness her completely thrash him in hand to hand. Those who stuck around even longer got to watch him practice with a sword heavier than his Mother's grand piano until his hands began to bleed.
Harry felt the flutter of magic around them, pooling around the door. Dumbledore was trying to prevent them from leaving. Lothair too seemed to have reached the same conclusion if his narrowed eyes were anything to go by. Lifting a hand, he placed it on the door. Harry felt a bit of tension and then it was all gone and the door swung open. Without saying anything, Lothair motioned for them to go through before following them out and leaving Dumbledore sitting in his office.
Lord," Draco responded, spitting a bit of blood that had strayed from the recent cut above his eyebrow. A well-placed elbow had certainly done its job in splitting open the sensitive skin. It felt particularly deep and a sharp burst of pain would move through the spot when he tensed his jaw. "He was
"The Prince," the hushed whisper seemed to echo off each stone that encircled the courtyard, excitement clearly evident in its tone. "They've found him."
"Oh, please, Sheedra? Please?" Gwyn begged, clasping her hands in front of her, "Your cooking is so much better than my mother's. I'll simply starve if I have to continue eating her cooking."
There were other reasons why an Alpha would not wish to be cooped up within Jade Manor and Soren looked to appease these concerns to better create a foundation to handle the entire situation. Harry had demanded that the second remain under their care until the event had been thoroughly examined. He had not said anything about the Alpha. His presence here was of his own doing, out of concern for one of his. He would have been a lesser man in many eyes if he had turned his back on a member of his pack.
"He is not fully healed," Soren responded, rising to his feet once more, his voice remaining calm and soothing. It had been the first time since their failed lesson that he'd had Harry's attention and this certainly wasn't the way he'd planned it. He was not impressed with Harry running out into the realm without proper planning, but given the circumstances, he could understand. Perhaps putting off his training of the realm hadn't been the best decision. Harry's was already starting to show signs of his dominant nature and the boy was completely unaware of it. It could very well be a dangerous mix. "He is breathing and I have stabilized him. It will give us enough time to get him to the Manor where he can receive proper medical attention so long as we are not detained."
Harry glowered, catching Draco's amused look from where he sat comfortably at a desk in the front of the classroom like the little suck up that he was. Sometimes he just wanted to smack that smug look off his lips ... at other times he wanted to do something else entirely, which made him feel an awful lot like he was suffering from whiplash.
Harry followed behind Soren, focusing on where he placed his feet and how he maneuvered Draco's form through the dense trees. For all his precautions, however, Harry very nearly dropped him as they emerged from the trees to find the injured Werewolf he'd left for Gwynn sitting safely between two others, Ilaria and two of her guards stood with him. A deep growl worked its way up from his chest at what appeared to be a conversation between one of the Wolves and Ilaria.
Harry watched unnoticed from the doorway as the one named Gwynn flushed with annoyance, her knuckles turning white with the tight grip she had on her bow while the quiver on her make shifted as she tensed. "You know full well that I can make that shot, Terrak. I've done it a million times before!"
"I wouldn't be worried about me," Ilaria grinned, moving further into the room, "He's the one who said you were unoriginal."
The re-entry had him stumbling to catch his balance, wide eyes focusing back on Draco, whose face had paled. It hadn't been subtle this time. The look on the blond's face told him that he'd felt the intrusion. The wall he'd envisioned slamming down had been Draco's way of protecting himself.
"Not this human!" Harry snapped, the sound almost as terrifying as the growl of the Wolves. "This human has my protection! While on my lands you will NOT hunt humans nor will you harm the Elves!"
Draco's head snapped up at that, feeling some of the tension within him drain at the recognition. He'd never thought the sound of flowing water would sound quite so beautiful. It didn't matter if it was a stream or a river. Even in the Wizarding world habitations were almost always built within a short distance of fresh water. Hogwarts had its lake, after all. If there was water near by then, as long as he kept moving, he was bound to find someone. The longer he spent alone within the forest the more his unease grew. He wasn't supposed to be there. He didn't know why, however, but the feeling was too strong to disregard.
"Soren, this is not the way," Rosalind responded, her tone angry. Harry hadn't even really had the chance to process that there might yet be a way to save the blond before Rosalind was moving behind himself and Soren, acting almost as a physical barrier between the Draco and the remaining occupants of the room. "You know better than to mess with things such as this. It must be entered into willingly by both parties. If not it will upset the balance and there will be nothing left to save. The choice is not there for the injured party. The Mother only knows what will become of the bond because of it."
Draco, as he had sat and watched events unfold before him, grew more and more frustrated with how little of the situation he knew and how very little sense the entire thing made. He was alive, stuck in the same room with Potter, his hair was girlishly long, and he had three intense pair of eyes focused on him. "I'd hate to interrupt but could someone please tell me what the BLOODY HELL IS GOING ON?" As he spoke, his voice rose until he was shouting.
"Well, oh fearless leader," Draco drawled from behind him, "If we're not staying in the castle where are we staying? I am sure as hell not staying at the Three Broomsticks."
"You've been filling this room with some sort of energy for the past half an hour! I could barely fucking breath beneath the weight of it. Then all of a sudden it's gone and no one's the wiser?" Draco responded, raising an eyebrow. "And don't think I missed the sudden approval from that prat Ehlark, either. What did you do?"
Marking their current location, Draco guided them into a second corridor that led back to the wing he was currently residing in. Given the fact that Gabriel would be working mostly with him, the older Elf had suggested he find a suite in the same general vicinity. Draco, naturally, had taken the largest in the wing, but there were four other smaller suites that he felt would be suitable. The rest could be taken care of by the staff, if it hadn't already.
The almost instant chorus of disapproval and downright refusal on both Draco and Lothair's parts had Harry rolling his eyes. "I'm not a helpless child!" he snapped, "Don't think for a second they're going to back off if I'm not there. It'll only look suspicious and they'll only press all the more."
Sure enough, when Harry dragged himself to the training room the next morning, he had found himself facing two regimented lines of fifteen young Elves. After their initial respectful greeting (which Harry still wasn't comfortable with) Ilaria had instructed him to take his place among them. He wasn't just going to make a fool of himself in front of Ilaria, which happened on a regular basis, Harry was now going to be making a complete fool of himself in front of fifteen of his peers. He didn't like thinking of them as his subjects. The concept was just far too surreal.
The sound of Draco's jaw cracking beneath the pressure of Lucius' fist was the only reprimand he received for outright refusing the Dark Lord as his master. Even the numbing of his senses wasn't enough to block the abrupt pain from clouding his vision as he struggled to breath through it.
As much as these thoughts had been plaguing Harry's mind as of late, he couldn't hold on to them once Gwynn lunged forward with Ilaria's nod of acceptance, her sword held firmly in her hand and dangerously accurate. Harry's mind was now focused only on not falling prey to sharp bite of Gwynn's sword. His own weapon, after several days of intense training, had finally started to feel comfortable in his grasp, but it certainly wasn't wielded with as much skill as his counterpart. Having had barely enough time to defend against her attack, Harry hadn't been able to retaliate. All he could do was continue to block her attacks and hope that her strength would wane and put an end to the strong vibrations that ran through his arm with each blow.
Offering him a calming smile, Rosalind made a deep, two inch incision down his wrist. Harry expected to see blood instantly bloom, but was surprised to find only the vibrant red line marring his skin. Pulling his eyes from his wrist, Harry watched her repeat the action on Draco's pale wrist, only to receive the same result. With both wrists now prepared, Rosalind first took Harry's before placing Draco's over top of it, their skin pressing together. Harry was surprised to find the cool quality of Draco's touch and worried eyes shifted to Rosalind. Any questions he might have asked were put on hold as a draft ruffled the fringe of his hair and Soren appeared beside Rosalind, a white strip of fabric in his hand. Taking a moment to give Harry a reassuring nod, he began to wrap the fabric around their wrists, binding them together as Rosalind began to speak in low tones, the language unfamiliar to Harry's ears.
It was an interesting concept, that was certain, and the longer he spent thinking of it the more Harry began to see just what Soren was referring to. It was obvious with the moving staircases and the knowledge of the Room of Requirement. It all seemed to make much more sense when looked at through Soren's eyes, but there was still an aspect that he was unsure of. "If Hogwarts is alive than what about Magic? I always thought Hogwarts was the way it was because of magic."
Draco taking the silence for what it was, spoke again. "Can I trust you?" he asked, frankly. He would give the older man enough credit not to beat around the push or try and play word games with him. His blunt question, he knew, would earn him some sort of respect and he hoped that was enough to earn him a straight answer.
The familiar words rattled around Hermione's brain as Ron once again repeated his concern, turning in his seat to scan the Great Hall. The Professors were all sitting at the head table, chatting quietly among themselves as the students filled their plates below ... just as they had been doing the last fifteen times Ron had checked to see if anything had changed. What he was waiting to see was beyond her, but if he complained to her one more time she was going to smack him with the ancient runes book she was currently trying to read.
Harry remained silent, his eyes trained still on Draco's face. A bond? There was a bond between him and Draco? It didn't make sense. There couldn't be a bond that strong between them. There just couldn't be. On the other hand, could he risk saying no? What would happen if he did? "He'll be alright, then?" he asked, turning his head back to look back at Soren. "If I do this?"
Thoughts, Harry realized. The murmuring had been Ehlark's thoughts as they moved through his mind. What Soren had said was true, then. The Elf would side with Aranel regardless of the outcome. Another spike of frustration. Why the hell was he even a counselor if he was incapable of making a decision on his own. If he was just going to mimic the man sitting to his right, what purpose did he really have?
Draco woke, the last of his shout lingering on his lips as he jerked awake. Caught between reality and dream, his eyes searched for the horrifying image his mind had conjured for him in sleep. Even his thoughts, it seemed, betrayed him. As the remainder of the dream faded and reality took hold, he lifted a hand to drag over his face. It had been a long time since he'd had dreams like this. When Voldemort had first returned, Draco had experience nightmares, but eventually they had faded as he'd grown accustomed to the tension and terror in his life.
Turning the last corner found Harry standing in the entrance way to what appeared to be a rather large courtyard. The sounds that had drawn his attention were the collective voices of three young Elves and the sound of taunt bowstrings being pulled and released. Even at such a distance his ears quite easily picked up the rush of air that modeled itself around the shaft of the arrow as it was released.
It didn't help. The warnings, the worry, nothing helped. It still came down to the fact that Harry couldn't just let him die. He felt responsible. He should have gotten there sooner and none of this would have happened. A brief stab of anger burned hotly through him as he thought about the Wolves. They were resting somewhere in the castle and that bothered him greatly. Soren said he needed to speak with them, but had refused to tell Harry where exactly they were staying. He'd never been a violent person but at the moment all he wanted to do was rip the lot of them a new one. After a moment he sighed, offering her a small shrug. "I don't have another option," he admitted, more of his fear slipping into his tone than he would have liked. It wasn't fear for himself or what being bonded to Draco would mean for him. He was worried about what all of this would mean for Draco. It would alienate him from the world he was used to. He wouldn't be just a wizard any longer. At a moment like this, Ron would have insisted that the blond was the next in line for the dark mark and what if he was? What was going to happen then? Would the bond cancel out any desire Draco had of selling Harry out to Voldemort? Everything was far too complicated.
Harry shook his head. This made no sense at all. Why the bloody hell did it have to be his? He and Draco had nothing in common. Hell, Lothair was just as much of a git as Draco was, why couldn't it be Lothair's blood he needed. "There's no connection between us. We're rivals … enemies ..." Harry made the mistake then to glance over at the profile of Draco's pale face, the colour making the bruises on his face look all the worse. Were the enemies? He was pretty sure an enemy didn't make you feel this way. Becoming an Elf and joining this realm was suppose to help him find his place, but he was even more confused than he'd been living outside of it. He wasn't entirely sure what he was suppose to be doing now that the past and the present were trying to fuse together. Was there room in this new life for slivers of his old? More importantly, did he want Draco to be one of the few sliver's he was going to allow in?
"It is their only chance, my love." Soren's eyes released their hold on Harry and softened as his attention shifted to his mate. For a brief moment, Harry felt as though he was intruding on a private moment. He had a ridiculously strange urge to look at Draco, all of a sudden, and it took nearly every ounce of strength within him to fight that off. Had it not been for Soren's voice continuing, he might have given in under the incredible pressure in his chest. "There is much more at work here than just a bond. You know what will happen if the boy dies. As much as I wish I didn't have to say this, it's not just about them. This is about all of us."
"I don't care," was all she got for her efforts as Harry focused on the path he needed to make it back to the Chamber. They still had some time before dinner, so he was pretty sure Malfoy would be down there. It wasn't exactly like he could go and hang out in the Slytherin common room.
Harry's attention returned to the large wolf. There was a hard look in his eyes that Harry had seen plenty of times before. It meant that, like it or not, he would be housing three wolves instead of one. "It's your funeral."
Harry instantly stumbled under the weight of his surprise. His eyes wide as he watched her shrug it off and continue on her way. After a moment, he forced himself forward again, shouting "Have you been living under a rock?" as he hurried to catch up with her.
"Do you notice that every time you infuriate him, he hates me all the more. I haven't even done anything!"
Soren sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. "You'll both go." Harry looked like he might argue, but Soren continued. "But we'll take precautions. The Guard will go with us and the two of you will be charmed to appear as you were when you last resided there. I'd like to keep our hand to ourselves until we know the full extent of their plans."
Internally, Draco was still fuming over that ridiculous mess in the conference room. What the bloody hell had that been? There were so many things to be annoyed with that he couldn't quite decide where to start. Instead, he'd just focused on Potter. He hadn't needed the idiot to speak for him and he certainly didn't need him to defend him or try to explain his presence away. Hell, he wasn't even sure he could call that freak out an explanation. Then, to top it off, he'd just bolted and left Draco to deal with the fallout as though he couldn't stand to be in the same room.
There was a moment when Soren truly felt a sliver of disappointment but it was immediately brushed away by the seriousness of his task. There was no point in feeling disappointed. The error could and would be corrected. "I suppose this is but another example of the inadequacy of Wizarding education," he sighed, the main focus of his attention turned to flipping through the pages of the second book. "They will teach you how to levitate a feather but when it comes to truly important aspects of this world they are sorely lacking." It took another moment before Soren made a pleased sound and his hand stilled. Shifting forward, he turned the book and placed it over top of the first volume. "Alethea Caroline Durham. This is where your story begins."
With nothing else to say the three of them scurried down the hallway, just making it into the classroom before the doors closed on them.
The two of them watched in silence as the High Lords continued their dance. Finally, as Ilaria brought down her lance, Lothair blocked the blow with one of his axes, spun around and brought down the other on the spot where Ilaria had been standing only a second before. As it hit the ground, light exploded outward, the crackling sound of the energy he'd released singed the air around them.
Harry had just placed his hands back on Draco's chest, when the light sound of a footfall directly behind him alerted him to another presence. Wishing desperately that he hadn't stupidly left his sword stuck in the side of that Werewolf, Harry's entire body tensed as he spun his body around, keeping it protectively in front of the prone form beside him. Had he been thinking of anything but protecting Draco, he might have noticed the slight elongating of his eyeteeth. Soren, on the other hand, did not fail to notice. Nor did the much older Elf fail to notice the way Harry's eye's had darkened with just a hint of red appearing around his normally green iris' as his skin paled drastically. It was something that surprised him greatly, but given the circumstances, he could not pursue further.
Without a sword, Gwynn was at a serious disadvantage. It was a disadvantage that Ilaria continually warned against. It was a disadvantage that left Gwynn with but one option: handicapping the opposition. Before Harry could understand what was happening, Gwynn shifted into what could almost be considered a crouch, her muscles tensing before she stepped into a forward movement, the heel of her palms connecting forcefully with the center of Harry's chest, forcing the breath from within him and sending him backwards. When his back hit the floor it was with a now very familiar sounding thud that left him struggling to regain the use of his lungs.
Sensing Harry's confusion, Soren continued the conversation by making the obvious but necessary introductions. "Ilaria, I'd like to introduce you Harry James Potter, Dark Prince of the Elven Realm."
Gwynn shook her head. "You matured in your human state. If you had matured as an Elf, you'd still be a child." The relief that clearly flooded through Harry's eyes at that revelation had her rolling her eyes once more.
"You can enter the Realm through any point in the mortal world if you know how to manipulate the magic that keeps us separated. By opening the barrier, we can come out within a relatively close distance of our destination. Because the school has a heavy barrier or her own magic, we won't be able to get as close as we normally would have, but it will be close enough."
There was silence around the table for several long moments, each of them lost in their own thoughts. Rosalind, for her part, still did not agree with the situation one hundred percent, but there was little that she could do to prevent it. She couldn't heal the boy without the influence of Harry's blood and unless the boy was conscious, the two could not form the bond naturally.
He was positive that the old man was up planning something big, but no matter how much he thought about it, he simply couldn't put the pieces together. Albus had never been interested in the plight of Draco Malfoy, at least not until recently. It was this interest that had tipped Severus off. Normally, the Headmaster was focused solely on that Potter brat, but since the boy had escaped the hold Dumbledore had on him, Albus had redoubled his efforts to bring Draco within the protection of Hogwarts. The man seemed to have a rather intense interest in keeping one or the other under his control and Severus was missing the part of the equation that balanced it.
Harry only raised an eyebrow and turned away, moving to head back toward the inner halls of the Manor. "You may not have any regard for your own life, but I certainly won't let you kill the both of us."
"Yeah well, you only have a room because I asked Hogwarts to make you one," he commented, eyeing the image of the Forbidden forest that was portrayed through Draco's window. The fact that Hagrid's cottage was nestled in at the base of the forest made Harry grin.
If he hadn't known any better, Harry would have assumed that everything was right as rain over at the Slytherin table. Pansy was in her usual spot attached to Draco's side and they all seemed to be having a mighty fine conversation. The only sign that there might be trouble was the placement of the group. Rather than sitting in the middle of the table for the most attention, they were located at the end, Crabbe and Goyle acting as buffers between the remainder of the table.
Harry couldn't entirely come up with a plausible answer to that. He'd tried to assume it was because he simply didn't want to be responsible for another death. His error had killed Sirius. How many others had died because he had yet to stop Voldemort? Draco, perhaps, was merely his chance to actually save someone instead of putting them in danger...though, he was pretty sure tying Draco to him was only putting the blond in further danger. It would be a weakness that Voldemort and even Roland wouldn't miss. Still, the excuse did not sit well with him and he had no other explanation to try.
Ahead of them, Draco was still fuming, though he'd quickly reigned in his magic after speaking with Soren. The older elf was right, if they went into this meeting with him blasting his magic every where they'd take it as a sign of hostility. Still, it infuriated him that every one else seemed to be taking this meeting seriously and that Gryffindor idiot was flirting with his little girlfriend. He'd been the idiot to insist on this damn meeting in the first place! Every inch of him wanted to smack that smile right off his stupid face. The only thing keeping him from doing so was the fact that they were rapidly approaching the border and the arranged meeting and he had other things to worry about.
didn't see hide nor hair of me," he repeated, offering him a shrug. "Doesn't mean others saw the same."
If Dumbledore was trying to manipulate them, he'd be sure to drop tidbits of information for them to find. Once he did, it'd be easier to figure out his intentions. Until then, he'd keep what he knew to himself. It wasn't that he didn't trust Ron and Hermione, but he didn't know how deeply Dumbledore had set his traps. Besides, finding out what the old man was up to wasn't his only objective.
"Well," Draco sighed, crossing his arms. "Let's get a move on, shall we? I'd rather not stand around in this sewer for the foreseeable future."
The comment surprised a snort of amusement from him, releasing one of the many knots in his soul and lightening his mood even if just a little. "That's a fair point."
Two low warning growls came from the two other wolves as they moved to step in front of their injured companion once again. A month ago, Harry would have been scared to death at the very sound, now it only had him anticipating a fight. "If I catch you hunting on Elven ground again, you will become the prey," Harry returned, his voice low and dangerous. "Do I make myself clear."
His first instinct was to deny the claim, but he held his tongue, biting down on the inside of his cheek to quell the desire. Soren had warned him against rash comments and he forced himself to think about it. "There are things left undone in the Wizarding world," he started, "things that if left unchecked could influence the peace in the Realm." During their discussion the night before, Soren had made it clear that his best bet was to paint his argument in the best light for the Realm.
Draco had managed for over two months to keep himself out of the Death Eater ranks. His friends had their own marks to contemplate, many of them still looking forward to being initiated. He simply couldn't trust them enough to turn to them with his own concerns. He couldn't turn to his Mother, Lucius would never forgive any transgression from his wife and Draco couldn't risk her life. He may not appreciate his Father, but Draco did, in fact, love his Mother and he would never ask her to trade her well-being for his own. Turning to Dumbledore was laughable. There was absolutely no way the old man and his followers would accept the son of Lucius Malfoy into their folds with open arms and he wasn't going to beg in order to be granted sanctuary. Ultimately he was alone and he was running out of excuses. The Dark Lord was not a patient man.
"Harry," the hissed comment came from behind him where Gwynn was still under a glamour. "You're moving too quickly. You're gathering attention."
"They'll kill you for this," he whispered, terrified not for himself but for her. If Lucius didn't, Voldemort surely would.
The sound of his Mother's voice resonating through his mind only made Draco's stomach churn violently with guilt. She'd instructed him to trust the man in front of him, but even with no other fragment of hope left, Draco found it extremely difficult to follow through on that. What if his Mother was wrong? What if Snape couldn't be trusted either.
Harry's eyebrow shot back up in surprise. It wasn't so much the fact that Hermione had turned him down that surprised him if he was honest. He was more surprised that Ron had gone through with asking. He'd been well aware of his friend's feelings for the brunette, but all he could think about was the time he'd asked Fleur Delacour out and he had to bite back a laugh as he imagined it.
Harry dared a glance to Gabriel to see his nod of acceptance. "Right, well, anything further questions can be directed to Soren." Frankly, he was pretty sure the Elf beside him was more qualified to deal with the entire thing. Pushing back the chair, he stood. "Excuse me." Before anyone could say anything else, he moved to the door and disappeared out of it, leaving the rest of them to stare at the spot he'd just vacated.
"Rules have never stopped you before!" The challenge in Ron's voice was particularly clear: misguided, but clear.
It was still relatively early and only a handful of bleary eyed students sat in the Great Hall trying to find the energy they would need for the remainder of the day. Hermione was quite used to the early hour. It wasn't often that you couldn't find her in the hall at this hour. She enjoyed the quiet before the regular bustle of students shuffled their way in. That morning she had several Arithmancy books spread out about her. Her quill flew over her parchment, pausing only when she stopped to check a reference. She had a lengthy essay due at the end of the week and she wanted to have it finished with enough time to allow for any last minute edits she would need to make.
Draco debated the information, his eyes scanning the land ahead of them. From their current vantage point, he couldn't see them. If there was five of them, Draco could only take a guess as to who Dumbledore would bring along. Moody, was likely. Maybe Lupin. Severus was a possibility, but there was still too much unknown about Snape's involvement with Dumbledore to know for sure. Was he trusted enough to be brought to a meeting such as this? Was Snape ambitious enough to try and talk his way into the meeting if Dumbledore didn't trust him completely? They were all questions he didn't have a sure answer to and only seeing those gathered for himself would begin to answer them.
I do not own Harry Potter or anything related to the HP verse. This story was created simply for my own amusement and no monetary gain has been acquired due to it's publication.
The three High Lords shared a worried look as Harry left with Erebus. The bond was starting sooner then it should have and Harry's mind would now have to balance the bond and the darkening of his personality. It was a balance that Harry would need to find immediately and none of the High Lords were entirely sure what would happen if he didn't. The Realm had waited five generations for a leader. It couldn't wait any longer. If Harry fell before an heir was produced, the royal bloodline would end with him, throwing their world into chaos.
The remaining walk to the library was silent save for the sound of their footsteps echoing off the walls. Harry didn't notice. For those last few minutes, he focused inward, building up a prison for everything that had hit him so suddenly only moments ago. By the time he stepped into the library, he was back to being calm. The ache in his chest dulled only slightly, but it was enough to allow him to focus on those who were already occupying the room.
"I suppose that would explain why they were able to find the border. Even one who was turned would have been able to scent the division if they looked hard enough," Lothair commented, his eyes turning to Soren."
"Uh…thanks," he muttered, a hand automatically moving to awkwardly rub the back of his neck. A nervous habit he'd adopted.
Harry wasn't entirely sure whether or not he should be insulted, but Ilaria was nodding her head in agreement. "I was thinking the same. He'd never be able to wield anything heavier for a long."
lurking!" Draco shot back, a slight flush on his pale cheeks. "A Malfoy doesn't lurk. It's not my fault you sleep like the bloody dead."
Draco was pretty sure a whimper escaped his lips as he attempted to inch himself backwards away from the approaching threat. As the wolf crouched lower, it's muscles tensing as it prepared to spring, Draco froze as a deep sense of horror enveloped him. He wasn't going to escape this. Just as he was about to close his eyes, both his attention and the attention of his attacker were torn away by the sound of heavy footfalls. Beneath him, he could swear he felt the ground tremble. He wouldn't have believed it had the trees to the left of them had not started to tremble.
It wasn't until he felt eyes on him did he realize that he'd been idly rubbing the spot on his chest where the ache was gradually growing. Glancing up, he offered only a shrug to Draco's suspicious look and walked past him. Now wasn't the time to think on it. They had other more pressing matters to deal with and when Draco didn't stop him, Harry pushed his thoughts and the ache aside and continued on.
Slowly things began to click into place. The spark of guilt or pride when he'd considered Potter. The weight on his chest that had appeared when Potter had stormed from the room. They were bonded. He was bloody bonded to Harry bloody Potter, the boy with the biggest bloody target on his forehead.
Draco growled at that. Lucius Malfoy. Never before had Draco felt such an unbridled anger at the man. He'd spent the majority of his life looking up to Lucius and doing his best to be everything the man had wanted in a son. In the end, he had gotten nothing but hatred and pain for his efforts. The way he acted, the relationships he developed, the way he carried himself, all of it had been an attempt to please his father and now those aspects were what confined him within that position. He'd alienated anyone who might be willing to help him out of the mess he'd found himself in.
Across from him, Ron seemed equally upset. The news hadn't been announced to the rest of the team yet so they couldn't exactly talk about it ... or rather, Ron couldn't complain publicly about it. Harry had given them some excuse about wanting to keep him protected because the order thought Voldemort would be stepping up his movements now that Harry was back. It was a load of crap, but they both seemed to buy it.
When he appeared at Draco's side, he reached past him and placed a hand on Harry's forehead and began chanting something Draco couldn't quite make out. After a moment, Harry stilled, the silence ringing out eerily after the echo of screams.
Rolling her eyes, Gwynn reached out and slapped him upside the back of the head. "You idiot. Do you even know what this means?"
A brief flutter of eyelashes had Harry leaning in closer. "Draco?" he called, hoping the blond would wake so that Harry might be able to determine whether or not he was alright. When nothing happened, he tried again, "Draco?" This time sounding more firm. It took another moment before grey eyes now flecked with the same startling green as Harry's opened, causing Harry to draw in a surprised breath.
Harry had continued to ignore him since they'd returned and Draco's mood hadn't improved either. Gabriel had taken it upon himself to ask why he was so irritated. No one else had bothered. In all honesty, he should be pleased. It made things easier for him if Harry was ignoring him. He wouldn't have to worry about the other Elf getting in his way. The problem, of course, was that he wasn't happy. He was down right pissed off that he was being ignored. Gabriel had only smiled at him with that knowing grin until Draco had threatened to rip it off his face.
"There is another way to save him, Harry, but it is not easy and will come with lasting repercussions."
Gwynn, who stood with the horses, winced as the forceful sound left Harry's mouth. She wasn't entirely sure Harry knew of whom he was speaking to. Not many would use that particular tone of voice to the Alpha. More importantly, not many would use that tone with the Alpha and live to tell about it. What surprised her more, however, was the dark look that had passed over Harry's face just before the Alpha and his general stood aside. She didn't know who the blond in Harry's arms was, but she did know that he seemed to be pivotal to what was happening.
"Merlin's beard," Harry grumbled, having finally managed to stop the bleeding. His nose was still crooked and looked a right mess beneath the instant bruising and dried smears of blood, but he wasn't overly concerned. "You could wake up like a normal person, you know? Not jumping around like the hounds of hell are on your heels!"
"Yes, we were informed of your intentions for Harry," Dumbledore nodded, acknowledging the previous letter, "But I'm afraid you don't understand Harry's importance in our world. He has a duty to fulfill that was put into place by his parents before him."
Hendrik seemed to see the truth of the situation in Soren's dark eyes, for he nodded his understanding and his gratitude. It was not everyday that a High Lord made an offer to prolong an interrogation ...and that was exactly what it was. Hendrik was not a fool. He had seen the dark look in the Prince's eyes. When he had ordered them back to Jade Manor, it had not been for a brief conversation. He'd been seeking retribution for the wrongs done to his mate. Even with the assurance in Soren's tone, he could not be sure that the Prince wouldn't still be seeking such retributions. "Three days is all I need," he informed the Elf as he stood. He did not offer a hand to be shook nor did he bow his head. He merely nodded, an understanding between strong leaders. "I shall inform Samuel of the change and then be on my way."
It wasn't a suggestion and a part of him bristled at the command that was clear in the tone. Given the tension in the room, he had a feeling that he had not been the only one. Shifting his glance to the left, bright emerald eyes met a muddied shade of the same colour.
Harry's eyes took in the complete sight of his rival. They'd spent years hating each other. They'd said and done all manner of awful things to each other and yet, there he stood, feeling absolutely horrible about the whole thing. He would have thought he'd feel a little pleased that Draco had gotten some of his own back, but he didn't. It was quite the opposite. Harry was sure that if he could switch places with him and take the brunt of Draco's wounds, he would. No questions asked. The thought made him frown. Perhaps he really did have a hero complex. Whatever complex he had, however, it did nothing to relieve the overwhelming feelings moving through him; feelings that only continued to confuse him.
The moment Harry had slipped from the room, the remainder of Soren's anger vanished with an aggravated sigh. He had spent many moons helping those who, like Harry, had found themselves unexpectedly thrust into an unknown world and he had never before lost his temper. Things were not working out as smoothly as he had initially hoped. While the majority of their time was spent on preparing Harry for his role as Dark Prince, the Kingdom around them was crumbling. Roland had yet to make a move and his presence at the borders was making the entire realm nervous. They were currently playing with fire and the entire castle seemed to understand that. Their Prince was unprepared and discontent threatened to destroy everything they were working so hard to protect.
The two continued to walk in silence, Harry leading the way and Draco taking in every detail of the trip so that he could recall the location in the future when he didn't have someone to guide him. He couldn't keep asking for assistance. It took a few minutes, but eventually they made it to the kitchen. Draco wasn't sure what exactly he'd been expecting, having never really ventured into the kitchen at Hogwarts or even at the Manor. When he had wanted food, he'd simply called a house elf. He had not, however, been expecting the bustle that had seemed to erupt in the large room. Everyone else may not be getting out of bed for another hour or two, but it looked like the fires had been stoked a while ago. The scent of freshly baked bread was already filling the space and the warmth that circulated the room wrapped around them tightly.
, he thought with a sneer. He had no bloody way of contacting anyone so it really didn't matter if he was alone. If he wanted to start doing things for himself and not his father, he was going to have to start with finding his way out of his current mess. If he managed to do that, perhaps then he could make bigger plans for himself. If those plans happened to focus around avenging his mother, then so be it
When nothing came from his quick scan of his surroundings, Draco continued on, doing his best to calm the growing panic in his chest and quicken his movements. As he continued to move, a new sound began to mix with his heavy footfalls. Stopping again, Draco tried to make as little noise as he could. His heart, however, was still beating loudly and he struggled to hear over the sound of his heart echoing in his ears. As he struggled, Draco slowly became aware of a new sound growing in the circle of his awareness.
Movement on the other side of the room drew Harry's attention and he glanced away from Hermione. His eyes landed back on Draco and the good humour he'd been feeling started to drift away. The angry slowly returned and the weight on his chest seemed to press down harder. Was this what his life was going to be now? Any happiness he might feel forever doomed to be crushed under the weight of this bond? He didn't regret his choice. He couldn't. That knowledge, however, didn't make it any easier to adjust.
"What could be causing it?" Harry asked, confused. The only werewolf he knew was Remus and he'd never mentioned anything about inflicted wounds not healing. In fact, he didn't even remember reading anything about it when Professor Snape had assigned that paper on Werewolves either. What was even harder to understand was the fact that nothing she did seemed to be working. Surely there was some sort of spell to remove the bloke. What was stronger than the Elves magic?
What troubled him even more, however, was that they hadn't spoken about what had happened the last time they had been together and Harry was sure that Draco was still seething about it. His lie had been flimsy when he'd said that he hadn't seen anything in the blond's mind and it was unlikely that Draco had bought it.
"Who is supposed to appear?" he asked again, sinking down in the spot beside Hermione and reaching for the chicken ahead of him.
Draco had already broken away from the group to go and investigate the various doors. Opening the first door, he glanced inside and let out a low whistle. It was a large room full of every sort of weapon he'd ever heard of and probably some he hadn't. Turning away, he glanced back to Harry and raised an eyebrow. "What in the hell were you imagining that included an armoury?"
None of the Elves had heard him approach. It was only the smallest portion of a moment before he found himself under the aim of three bows, arrows pointed at different vulnerable sections of his body: his chest, neck and sides. He had forgotten about the time difference. Given the current position of the sun, it was very and no one in the Manor, save the High Lords, was familiar with him. Thinking back on his actions, he could agree that it probably hadn't been the wisest decision to approach three unknown, armed Elves.
After taking another moment to suspiciously study him, Lothair turned away and headed back inside, leaving the door open for Harry to follow suit. Closing the door behind him, Harry moved further inside, his eyes scanning his surroundings. If he was honest, he hadn't been expecting the open and light atmosphere of Lothair's suite. Unlike the green and beige of his own suites, Lothair's spoke less of the forest and more of the sky. Blues, whites, and silvers created a light atmosphere that didn't fit the image Harry had of him. He'd expecting much darker colours and a more intimidating atmosphere.
"Two days." Soren replied. Two days was enough time to get everything organized and put the precautions in place. "Tell them we will meet them in two days time at dusk."
Slowly, Severus nodded his head and Draco's attention broke away. Potter was already moving toward the Gryffindor table and he glanced toward his own. Unlike Potter, he wasn't walking into friendly territory. Some friendly faces might remain, but he wasn't naive enough to think that word had not spread of his apparent betrayal. A part of him was particularly glad for the protection at his back. It would certainly make things easier.
For whatever reasons, he hadn't been expecting a woman. Why? He couldn't say. Ilaria was a woman and she led the entire army, for Merlin's sake. He had spent enough time around Hermione these past six years that he felt like an idiot for being surprised. Perhaps it was because of his internal embarrassment, but he hadn't spoke with her yet. Frankly, he wasn't brave enough to go over. He was sore enough as it was and he was pretty sure that if she didn't like what he had to say then she was quite capable of making it worse.
Harry's eyes narrowed as Draco passed, storming off down the hall and leaving him alone with Gwynn once more, not hat he even noticed her presence. All of his attention was focused on the disappearing figure down the hall, with each step Draco took the pain in Harry's chest tightened. If nothing else, the insufferable git had made one thing clear to Harry and it had nothing to do with Draco's distaste for him.
"It's not you they're looking for," he snapped, realizing his mistake when Draco's eyes hardened. "I just meant-"
The last glimpse Draco had of his home was filled with the image of a single tear trailing down his Mother's pale cheek and as much as that image caused his entirely world constrict, Draco couldn't help but take notice of his Father's silhouette in the broken doorway. Nor could he ignore the look of pure, unbridled fury etched into every line of his face. His mother would not survive her transgression, of that Draco was positive.
"It is of utmost urgency," Lothair insisted, a hard edge back in his voice and a meaningful look in his blue eyes. Whatever it was, Harry had the distinct impression that he was not to be included in the matter. He could tell by how hard Lothair was trying to get his point across without actually divulging what the situation was.
"It's a legit question!" Gabriel countered, running to catch up with the blond. "Besides, it couldn't hurt to go out and meet some other people. Let off some steam, so to speak."
That was a big thing to place on someone who really didn't have a say in the matter. Who knew if Draco would wake up in time to ask him, nor did they know if he would be able to honestly understand the gravity of the situation. It was human nature to fight in order to survive. Harry, himself, was having a hard enough time looking past the fact that Draco might be dying to fully grasp what Soren and Rosalind were trying to tell him. They acted as though it was a choice, but it really wasn't. If he said no and Draco ended up dying, he'd never be able to move past that. Draco's blood would be forever on his hands, unable to wash off. In the back of his mind he'd always blame himself. On top of that, who was he to decide whether or not Draco lived. Sure, the thought of watching him die made Harry physically ill, but so did taking such a choice away from the Slytherin.
Harry just sighed and waved it off. Sitting up, he pulled his sleeve up and showed her the angry red marks. "Apparently, I will survive." He was pretty sure if anything was going to kill him it was going to be the length of this day.
. His family – or what was left of it – considered him a freak for the very abilities that classified him as a hero in the eyes of the general Wizarding population. This sense of heroism had always been based on an action he could never claim as his own. This new possibility granted him the ability to step outside the ever-frustrating circle of misrepresentation and prophecy that had, for the past six years, surrounded him completely. His role as Dark Prince was something that he could embrace honestly. No matter the outcome he was responsible for crafting this new image of himself. He was alive because of his Mother's selfless act but the legacy he would leave behind was finally of his own making.
Soren must have been able to read that thought in his eyes because his usually thoughtful eyes darkened immediately, offering Lothair a rare look of hostility. "Be very careful, Lothair. There is more going on here than even you know." He wasn't really worried about what Lothair might or might not do. With the Werewolves in the Manor and the development of Harry's bond there were far more important things to worry about and he knew Lothair would not dare do anything while the human boy was in the Manor and under the care of Rosalind. Harry, he was sure, wasn't going to be leaving the Manor again for a while and he was equally sure that he wouldn't permit Lothair anywhere near it's new ward. There was nothing the Elf could do at the moment.
The first potion was familiar. The heavy texture and oily taste were clearly characteristics of a blood-replenishing potion. If Lucius wanted to keep him alive, then Draco needed to have the blood he'd already lost replaced. It did nothing for the pain, nor did it heal him, but it served its purpose in sustaining Draco's current existence. The second potion, however, was strangely unfamiliar. The slight numbing sensation that spread through his fingers explained why the pain he'd been feeling was dulled. Whatever the potion was it was laced with a mild pain relief. It took the harsh edge off the pain without signalling Lucius as to its effects. What baffled Draco the most, however, was the slight hint of carnation and comfrey; the former symbolizing protection, strength and healing, while the latter symbolized safety during travel. No matter how hard his feverish mind worked, he simply couldn't formulate a potion that acquired both of those ingredients. Separate potions, yes, but not one that combined the two.
"Where the hell were you last night?" Ron asked, gruffly. "You just got back, disappear after dinner, and never return to the dorms."
Harry narrowed his eyes. "You're not supposed to look like an entirely different person! You're just going for attention!"
He had only just started to accept the idea that he was no longer simply a member of the Wizarding community. He was now much more than that. While a part of him was tied to the world of Wizards, there was another part of him that was even now being drawn further into the Elven realm and further from the world he had come to know. "What do you mean?"
"To split one's soul in half..." Faelyn murmured, shaking her head, "It's too much for the soul to bare."
"An explanation is needed, I agree," Soren started, taking the initiative to diffuse the clearly tense situation. A better awakening might have prevented the problem, but it was much too late to be concerned with that. Now, they would gradually have to bring him to realize the full extent of the changes he now faced. "However, before we do so, please allow Rosalind, the resident healer of Jade Manor, to ensure that your wounds have been healed completely." Appealing to his self-interest was the easiest way to move the situation in the direction needed to be taken. The wounds on the boys back were still spots of confusion for most of those in the room.
Harry supposed he could see what she was getting at. In his defense, however, he didn't think of this place as a bathing room. To him it was more of a swimming pool. He'd just assumed that if he couldn't share it with the family he was suppose to have, he could share it with his friends...or at least the one he currently had. "No offence, Gwynn, but you're definitely not my type," he offered, an amused smile flickering across his face at that.
"You think?" Ilaria asked, honest surprise on her face before it shifted into consideration. "With all that darkness swirling around him, I thought Hades was apt." Her eyes returned to his then and she smirked. "You do have the whole Persephone thing down."
"He's trying to force a confrontation," he muttered, running a hand over his face. Frankly, none of them were ready for such a thing just yet ... even if that could provide him with enough of a distraction to slip back to the Manor and locate his Mother. The idea of using Potter as a distraction left an empty void in the pit of his stomach, but he ignored the pressure from the bond. "By drawing me out, he'll force that four-eyed dumbass out as well." For what purpose, he wasn't entirely sure.
Harry's eyes moved to meet the Alphas and the two glared darkly at each other, neither one of them wanting to be the one to look away.
Beside Draco, Akkar turned his head to glance at his charge. "Did you not resign from this Quidditch earlier?"
Harry blinked for a moment, surprised by the blunt response. After a moment he chuckled, and rubbed the back of his head. "Yeah, I suppose I am," he smiled. Her honest and point blank attitude put him at ease. "Still, I appreciate what you're doing and apologize for the danger it's going to put you in." His smile faded slightly then, his tone more serious. "Once we get to Hogwarts, things will move quickly."
"It's a good plan, really," she nodded, "you'll never have to worry about the servants fawning over you."
Draco rolled his eyes. "Those two," he pointed at Ron and Hermione, "Already know about Harry's heritage. I think erasing their memories is a bit much!"
Even before the rustle of fabric could alert him, Roland had known the exact moment when he was no longer alone. The sound of blood pumping through thick veins and the smell of sweat and fear lingered heavily in the air around him, causing within him a certain desire to still that beating heart. Just beneath the scent of the Elf, there was something altogether less satisfying, lingering in the strong threads of the travelling cloak haphazardly slung over broad shoulders. Lichen: a never-ending nuisance.
"Nothing," he whispered, his voice hoarse as though he'd been screaming. Maybe he had? He couldn't tell. Whether or not Draco believed him, Harry didn't give him the chance to voice it. Turning, away from the blonde, he hurried toward the door and disappeared through it.
Groaning, Harry dropped his arm from his face and sat up. He knew better than to argue. It'd just give him a headache and Ilaria would still get her way. "Where are we going?"
As lead Healer, Rosalind had the advantage of having more than just a simple office. Once through the door, the space widened out to include her personal office, medical storage, a lab, and a conference room. It was not uncommon for her to have trainees working in the lab or fellow healers converging in the conference room. That day, however, the space was wonderfully silent. Reaching the appropriate door, she ushered the three High Lords through. Taking a moment longer, she moved to her office to gather what notes she could on the procedure and returned to the others.
"It is true that Lady Alethea entered into this world at that time and there has been many descendants between the two of you, but you have to keep in mind that we are not discussing your human ancestors," Soren responded, taking a moment to explain the connection. Lothair would be covering the finer points of Elven ancestry over the course of the next few weeks, but for the moment a brief lesson was needed. "In our world it is only the Elven ancestry that is calculated. Lily and James will always be your parents but once your body accepted your Elven heritage it connected you to your Elvin ancestors."
Roland's hand shot out, instantly grabbing the rough shirt of the Elf closest to him. Given the current predicament, Roland just barely managed to contain his fury. The last thing he was going to tolerate was a slip up in his plans. He would kill them all before that happened.
Harry's took a deep breath before he could put another foot into his mouth. "The last time you were in the Wizarding world, they'd tried to kill you."
Everything inside of him told him to run, but his body was rooted to the spot. If he ran then the chase would be on. He couldn't outrun a bloody werewolf when he was completely healthy let alone when he could barely shuffle one foot in front of the other. He certainly couldn't climb any thing; his shoulder wouldn't hold his weight. His frantic reasoning, however, did not hold up against the feral snarl that ripped past the creature's lips. Draco's eyes widened at the terrifying sound. Without a second thought, he turned and forced his bruised and bloody body to run. The pain was excruciating, but the fear taking over him was worse. The pain didn't matter. He just had to keep running.
Reaching the second floor, they came to a stop outside of the girl's lavatory and Draco snorted. "Your bright idea is the girl's toilet?"
No. Not wide open. The doors had been ripped off their hinges. It hadn't been anything Draco had felt before. Usually, it felt like a subtle probing that left an almost oily sense in its wake. Thin little tendrils of another's mind trying to press their way in. Potter had been a blast of light that had ripped away the curtains, leaving his mind to wither in the unyielding sunshine. The images had flown so quickly between them that he couldn't make all of them out. Furthermore, it hadn't just been one sided. There had been images that did not belong to him. Potter as a child. Big eyes and sad smile.
Had Soren not been so quick to move, the speed by which Harry arrived at Draco's side would have surely knocked him backwards. The moment Draco's chest heaved for it's first breath Harry was leaning over him, his worry receding only when Draco's eyes flickered open. "Malfoy? Can you hear me?"
Finally opening his eyes, it took a moment to blink away the haze. As it faded, Draco found a pair of startlingly green eyes filling his vision. The colour seemed to swirl in their depths, mesmerizing him for a moment before a tendril of recognition wormed it's way through him.
As the desire continued to build, another of Harry's senses kicked in. It was as though someone had thrown open a window, allowing a warm breeze to wrap around the two of them and further teasing their heated skin. With that breeze came a familiar and delicate scent of oranges. As the sent registered, something in his mind changed. There was a name. It lingered at the edge of his awareness, teasing him with its presence. No matter how he tried that name prevented him from dragging it into the light.
Whatever Harry had been expecting it hadn't been to just walk right in the front door and straight into the Great Hall in the middle of Dinner. They were supposed to be keeping a low profile, weren't they? This was the exact opposite of a low profile. When Lothair had flung the doors open, hundreds of eyes had turned to look at them and he was suddenly very appreciative of the glamours they'd been made to wear. Even Lothair had worn one. His pointed ears were gone and his hair had been shortened in a style similar to Draco's and his clothes had been changed to standard Muggle wear. Had he not seen the change, he wouldn't have believed the Elf even knew what casual was.
"Shakespeare was not the only individual to find her enchanting," Soren smiled, his tone was one of fondness and respect. "She was an amazing individual, powerful and very wise."
Draco didn't feel all that interested in heading inside. Once they arrived, he would have to listen to their complaints and face the repercussions. After that ride back, he just didn't want to deal with it. Before he could change his mind, the doors of the Manor's front entrance were already closing behind them. He vaguely noted that the entrance hall appeared darker than he remembered it and he smiled wryly to himself. Even the Manor was responding to the growing storm.
"I, for one, would like to know more about how this man has split his soul," she continued, turning her attention back to Harry. "If I agree to this venture, I expect to be fully compensated with the knowledge of this Voldemort, individual."
"We've picked up some movement all along the borders. The initial presence started in the Northwest and has been steadily moving in both directions. We've already sent envoys to the neighboring lands, but the Vampire Coven and the Lichen have claimed that it is not their forces. The Fair Folk have yet to send word. We do, however, have reports of the Lichen congregating on the west side of our lands, but there's simply not enough of them to have been the cause of the ward disturbance."
"With only two days until you leave for the Wizarding Realm," Ilaria went on, interrupting Draco's thoughts. She'd had them both dragged down to the training grounds for what he was going to assume was either a lecture or some self-deprecating form of training. Those were her favourite, after all. "You two are going to do some final, high intensity training. Since I have not been permitted to go with you-" here she shot Harry a dirty look "-I'm going to spend the next two days making sure you're ready. Lothair will be observing so that he is aware of where you are in your training and how to proceed. He will also be discovering your element."
Harry's eyes shifted to the blond who rode next to Lothair, his mounts coat a deep chestnut with a mane as dark as Erebus'. Much to Harry's growing irritation, the git moved with ease as though he'd been born in the damn saddle. Just another thing the pompous git was better than Harry at.
"I love you, Draco," she responded, as he felt the very familiar tug behind his navel. "Don't let them catch you."
Draco shot him an annoyed look. "I'm not alone, you idiot," he commented, pointing to the Elf on his right that Harry hadn't even noticed. He'd been too busy checking out the new fit of Draco's clothes to be concerned with the man's presence.
"Alright, this is the easy part," Rosalind's voice interrupted his train of thought as she came to stand beside the bed. Reaching out, she took first Harry's wrist and applied a cold, oily substance to the skin there. Draco's soon followed and a moment later, a numbness began to spread through his wrist and forearm. Next Harry watched as she placed a small but deep incision on both his and Draco's wrist. Whatever she had applied to his skin seemed to have worked as Harry barely felt the knife pierce his skin. Once their wrists had been cut, she placed Harry's over Draco's, their wounds lining up perfectly as Soren stepped forward to bind their wrists together. With Draco laying on his stomach, their bound wrists lay comfortably between them.
"About Harry! Do you really think that he's some sort of Elf? I've been thinking about it and it just doesn't make any sense."
Harry stiffened at that. He didn't want to tell Lothair the full extent of it. Not just for his own sake, but for the sake of others involved. He'd seen a great deal of things in Draco's mind the other day and he understood more than he had prior. If he could end this before any real danger came to them than that would solve quite a few problems on their growing list of them.
"Alright, Harry," Rosalind's voice drew him from his musings, his green eyes moving to hers as she continued, "I need you to roll up your sleeve and lie back. I'm going to push the beds closer together so the distance the blood has to travel is minimal. It will speed up the process and your closeness to Draco will aid in guiding the magic."
Draco glanced down the table to Crabbe and Goyle, nodding his head in recognition. They glanced at him for a moment before nodding in return and going back to their meal.
At the dismissal the three Elves immediately straightened and disappeared from the courtyard. The presence of a High Lord and several commanding officers of the Royal Guard was enough that the courtyard was currently not the best place to be. A High Lord rarely sought out the young and if they did it certainly wasn't because you were doing well in your studies.
With a disapproving 'tsk' Rosalind moved to distract Harry from attempting to harm the older Elf. After drying his clothing, she took Harry's face in her hands and studied the damage done to his nose. "I leave you alone for a moment and look what happens," she responded, though her words were serious, there was a smile on her lips, which made Harry feel slightly sheepish about the state he was currently in. Lifting a hand, she carefully pressed the side of his nose, earning a wince in return. "This might sting a little, Harry," she warned, taking a moment to watch for the nod of understanding before she pinched the bridge of his nose and snapped it back into place, Harry's strangled gasp of pain was followed by Ilaria's light chuckle.
"Ah, I must do a better job of recalling that you were raised in the Wizarding world," Soren responded, frowning as he made a mental note to do just that and removed his riding cloak. The moment the fabric was in his hands, an individual, whom Harry had not previously noticed, stepped up to take it from him with a respectful bow of his head. "There will be many things that you will need to learn, but for now you must remember that everything has a life force."
"Seriously, Harry!" Ron whispered, loudly, "Where the hell have you been. Dumbledore gets some crazy note about Elves, you disappear for weeks, and now suddenly you're back with a bloody make-over!"
Furthermore, I decided in the end to use the Horcruxes since it fit in well with where I was taking this story. Keep in mind that this is an AU story and Harry's acquiring of the Horcrux knowledge will not be in the same method as in the books.
Harry glared at her, a hand rubbing the back of his head. For being a girl she certainly had an arm on her. That had bloody well hurt. "Of course, I do. Rosalind said it would bind us together. Connected. Forever. I get it."
The soft brush of fingertips across his feverish skin was the first thing Harry's muddled senses had registered. The second was that the pleased moan that had seemed to echo loudly through his mind had escaped from between his own lips. For as hot as his skin burned, the touch of those fingertips over his stomach left lines of icy relief in their wake. Those cool touches only made it extremely difficult for Harry to keep his breath from rushing past his lips in small gasps of surprise and pleasure. The arms that slowly snaked around his waist held the same icy touch but it was the strong chest pressed against the warm skin of his back that nearly broke the hold he had on himself.
For several long moments, the two just held their positions watching each other. The silence lingered heavily around them until an exasperated sigh from Lothair seemed to urge Harry forward. Draco's eyes widened slightly at how quickly Harry moved. Despite knowing that their Elven blood gave them increased senses and abilities, he hadn't really explored anything other then the strength he had in his own body. Unlike his human body, the weight of the sword in his hand was nothing. Speed, however, had not been his focus and the smirk on Potter's face told him that the Gryffindor knew it as well. He quickly stepped forward, point of his sword digging into the ground as he forced the handle upward, using the flat of the blade to reflect the blow from Harry. Twisting around, his sword followed him, forcing Harry who had darted behind him to back off and giving Draco the moment he needed to adjust his stance.
"Don't you 'yo' me!" the woman turned, pointing her finger at Harry in a manner that was far more threatening than Draco thought it out to be. "First you bring this ruffian-" she took a second to jerk her thumb in Gwen's pouting direction, "-into my kitchen, always putting me behind in my work to beg for more food and now you're just wandering in with another stray!" She shot a pointed look at Draco, daring him to ask her to make him something. "Without even so much as a good morning, Sheedra."
Anger flared again and this time there was no confusion as to who it was directed at. That manipulating old fool knew about his Mother. How much, Draco couldn't be sure, but it infuriated him all the same.
The sound of another approaching signaled the end of their conversation as they both glanced in the direction it was coming from. Gwynn approached from the left. "We're getting ready to head out," she commented, her eyes glancing briefly between them.
Hermione huffed at that. "Of course not," she responded, "You'll wait till the night before and then beg me to help you!"
Rosalind sighed and moved to sit behind the desk she often allowed her students to use. It was the only one in the room and she would not leave the boys unattended while they underwent the current settling of their bond. "It's too late for that, Soren," she responded, meeting his eyes. "What's done is done. I'll take the first watch. Go, get some rest. It will be a day or so at best before they wake."
"What does he mean it isn't important?" she asked, her voice interrupting the quite drone of surprised murmuring that was currently moving around the old wooden table, causing fourteen pairs of eyes to focus on her. "Of course he's coming back. He needs his education."
His eyes drifted from his notes to the blonde sitting two rows ahead of him. He supposed there were other reasons to stay in the class. He didn't have a full understanding of how the dynamics in Slytherin had changed after the events of the summer, but he figured it was better to have more eyes on the situation. Though, he thought irritably, if worse came to worse Draco could always use Parkinson as a shield. She was continuously draped all over him anyway. Might as well be useful.
Gwynn shot him an amused smirk before releasing his hand, which Harry hadn't even realized she had been still holding. The scowl remained on his features as he watched her disappear into the rows of students. He still wasn't entirely sure if Gwynn was making fun of him or actually being genuine. He had the feeling, however, that she was one of those individuals who could smile, tell you that you were completely useless, and you'd still think it was the best compliment you'd ever received.
It was an unknown voice who had spoken the question. Sitting the furthest from Harry, a small Elf was perched not on one of the chairs around the table but on a stool. How or when it had appeared in the room was beyond Harry. The Elf had the palest hair he'd ever seen. Hell, it was lighter than even Draco's; bordering on silver. Bright blue eyes stared at him curiously, waiting for an answer.
This time it wasn't one of the Councillors who spoke, but Ilaria. "What sort of force does this individual maintain?"
Harry couldn't argue with that. Was that not what the entire Wizarding world was about at the moment? Everyone was caught up in one side of the war. Hell, people flocked behind his name alone and it didn't matter what he did, right or wrong, so long as he stopped Voldemort. The end justified the means. There was one thing that bothered him about her answer. "Draco crossed the border."
It wasn't the first time he'd experienced it. He'd been having them every night since he'd arrived in the realm. He didn't know whether it was a side affect of what had happened to him physically or if it was just another consequence of his mental state. Frankly, he wouldn't be at all surprised if his sanity was slowly slipping away from him. Most of his life would make sense if that was the case.
Ron muttered something under his breath that sounded distinctly like the word "stupid", but Harry didn't comment on it. It didn't matter if he didn't like it, so long as he accepted it. He felt bad about lying to them, but it wasn't just his arse on the line anymore.
Rosalind blinked for a moment at the promptly given name. For whatever reasons, Harry felt that she should know his given name, which in and of itself was a good sign. If there was a more personal understanding between the two then the bond was less likely to adapt an unequal standing. She did not wish to bind one in a lower position than the other. In order for this to work, they would need to be equals. "Given the state of Draco," she tried again, inserting the boy's name with a light smile, "ingesting the blood is not an option. What we'll be doing, instead, is very similar to what the non-magical world would refer to as a blood transfusion. I'll be directly guiding your blood into his system. Once his health has stabilized, I then will transfer a small portion of his blood into your veins. With your recent consumption of Dragon's blood, you should easily destroy any lingering werewolf DNA still clinging to the blood. Understand."
Stuffing his hands into his pockets, he began to make his way to the other side of the Manor where he could slip out into the training yard. Given the hour, he doubted there would be anyone out there, which served his purposes just fine. Flexing his fingers, the dull ache of yesterday's blisters reminded him just why he didn't enjoy training with an audience. Ilaria had decided that since he was hell bent on heading out into the world, she might as well make sure he could protect himself.
Turning from where she was watching a passing group of soldiers, she raised an eyebrow. It was odd that he asked first. It was even more strange that he seemed to be nervous about asking. "Why is it that the Elven realm has no contact with the Wizarding?"
"I hope you've been able to consider the situation thoroughly," he said, glancing toward the shorter elf, "As I've said the presence of the pack is a beneficial situation for both them and ourselves. They are a key element of our defensive structure."
The memory had him frowning and his eyes flicked to the blond in question. Draco was currently astride his own horse, looking for all the world as though he'd been born there. The git. His horse rivaled Erebus for size but rather than the dark black it's coat was a pale grey, small spots of white blended through. It was beautiful. Arion was his name and Lothair had claimed he'd been bred for war. Given where they were going, Harry thought it might be more a bad omen than a horse, but Draco had glared fiercely at him when he'd admitted it.
No matter. He would see things return to the proper order. He would see the fall of the Kingdom he so hated. He'd watched each of the High Lords fall. He'd make sure Soren was saved for last. Let him watch his fellow High Lords succumb to death and then let him see the royal bloodline finally snuffed out. It would happen. He would make sure of it.
As though in response, Draco felt the draw from his own weapon. In contrast, his own core seemed to respond to the lack of his own emotions. That cool calm that spread through him was what drew his element to him. As it spread through him it added a chill to the wind that was curling around his frame. The cold emanated from him but it didn't bother him. He barely felt it. The fact that Lothair had been able to contain his own elemental magic and build it up was something Draco couldn't contemplate entirely. His own had just started to move through him and the pressure was already immense.
The two glowered at each other for a long moment before Harry looked away, glancing toward the windows. "Morning?" he snorted, turning to shoot Malfoy with an irritated look. "It's still two hours to morning." If there was one thing he hated, it was getting up early.
Harry started at the sudden sound of Gwynn's voice as it's irritated tones echoed off the stone around them. Jerking around, he found her standing on the edge of the pool, her hands on her hips and a dark look pointed directly at him. It was strange to see her out of her training gear, but it was not an unpleasant experience. It appeared as though the servant had found her appropriate clothing, if the tightly fitting short and tank top were anything to go by. "Uh...sorry?"
Like Harry's, Draco's hair had grown long past where he normally kept it. Someone, Rosalind he assumed, had untangled the long lengths but it remained loose at his side. Harry knew, without touching it that each strand would be as soft as it looked. The colour too had changed. Though not drastically, the blond locks had lost some of the golden quality, further lightening the strands to almost platinum. This might have drawn his resemblance closer to his Father had it not been for the other physical changes Harry was seeing.
Harry's eyes flickered to Draco's. He had a feeling he knew who they Alpha was referring to and by the look in Draco's eye he knew as well.
Draco moved around the table to put himself between Harry and the quick exit he was trying to make. "Don't fucking lie to me!"
Harry's eyes flickered to the Head table where Dumbledore was speaking to Lothair. About what, Harry could only guess. He was curious to know what the old man was up to behind the closed doors of the order. His thoughts briefly drifted to the information that Saeya had uncovered already.
"Gladius then," he nodded, offering a hand to take the sword back from Harry. "30 inches should do it." The one he'd given the boy had been 33, which had shifted his center of balance enough to be a problem. Turning his attention back to Ilaria, he asked, "Any specifications?"
With the lid gone, Harry's sword was bathed in the light. It was much shorter than Draco's and darker. The blade was deep obsidian, flashes of silver flickering across its surface at the spots the light hit it. It was edged on both sides, like Draco's, but it did not have the same markings across the blade. In a way, Draco felt any markings to the blade would tarnish the perfection of the blade. The hilt was another point of difference between the swords. The hilt of Harry's sword was not beautiful in its simplicity. It was beautiful because of its intricacy. Vines spread out across the cross section, before winding up over the grip to create a nest where a large emerald lay, the ends of the vines reaching up to hold it securely in place. The entire thing was darkness given physical shape and Draco found himself thinking it was particularly apt.
"Think about it logically, Ron! Before Harry, the Potter bloodline was believed to be as pure as your own. Having mixed blood would not have been something freely talked about, particularly if they had not benefited from the Elven blood. James Potter, more than likely, didn't know."
"Don't you see?" Soren asked, a smile lingering on his lips, as Harry pressed closer to the truth. Teaching did not consist of merely informing a student of the answers. True teaching came when the student was able to find the answers for themselves. "It is because of magic."
All eyes in the room seemed to shift as one to land of the blond sitting at the end of the table, silver eyes flashing for a moment before settling into bored acceptance. "He's an idiot. You'll get used to it."
Draco merely raised an eyebrow at Harry's continued glowering, but when an argument didn't come, he returned the look with a smug smirk.
A small tired sigh of relief slipped from Rosalind's lips as the blond's wounds began to heal, first with any lingering internal injuries before proceeding to the others. As the magic approached the wounds inflicted by the wolves, Rosalind watched as the skin around the edges began to repair itself. For a moment, it looked as though the wounds would heal just as the other had, but only for a moment. As the new, repaired skin moved forward to close the wound, the boys body began to jerk in retaliation, their combined relaxed state instantly began to fade. Stepping forward, Rosalind focused her magic toward healing the wounds, calling Ilaria to join her element of water with Rosalind's. The other two would continue to stabilize Harry.
"It wasn't a random Elf. Dumbledore said it was one of the three High Lords of the Elven Realm. The letter was accompanied by an authentic seal."
"That easy, huh?" Harry snorted, resigning himself to the battle ahead of him ... cause it would be a battle. The look in Draco's eyes as he watched Harry move forward was predatory and the sword in his hand seemed almost impatient.
His screams were like nails digging into his skin and Draco had to force himself to remain where he was. He watched silently as the four elves held their hands out over Harry's spasming body. They began chanting quietly at first before their tones gradually rose over the sounds of Harry's screams. They continued this for what felt like hours before Harry's screams were cut off and his body stilled.
Dumbledore nodded, "You'll be provided with a suitable room in the Professor's wing," he started, indicating Harry and Draco, "and the boys will return to their dorms."
Ilaria laughed and leaned over to smack his feet off the sofa. Taking their place, she propped her own feet up on the coffee table ahead of them. "I suppose, as far as negotiations go, it wasn't the worst one I've ever seen," she offered, taking perhaps a bit of pity on him.
