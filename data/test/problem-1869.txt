Harry leaned back a little bit and smiled. Draco smiled back and kissed him again. For the first time in a while Harry couldn’t talk because of something pleasant.
Then his expression changed to a brokenly determined one. "How is this that the one single thing you know is a lie anyway? It's ironic, don't you think? And so pathetic, really."
“…know that. Scum, that’s what you are,” a disgusted voice was saying and Harry froze. He didn’t recognise who it was but judging by the laughter of approval the speaker was not alone. Harry gripped his wand tighter.
As soon as they walked into the Great Hall, the sick feeling rose to the top of his stomach and the ringing in his ears grew louder. Everything went fuzzy and blurred, and Harry kept his head low, keeping close to Ron and Hermione. The Great Hall was all in warm colours, but Harry shivered. Everything seemed so familiar, but he wanted to be out as soon as possible. Everything was home except Harry was going to throw up.
we’re talking about!” Ron sounded angry. “Do you think he helped out Harry out of the goodness of his heart?”
Then the green flames swallowed her away, and Harry was allowed to stare at nothing in particular for as long as he wanted and no one would ask him if he was listening or not. He let his thoughts wander.
He shot a look at Harry and smirked softly to one side, right where the little line was. His eyes seemed even darker now, Harry never noticed them being this dark.
"Uh, er... yeah?" Harry felt like an idiot. Ginny was eyeing him in confusion. He couldn't take his eyes off of Malfoy to look at Ron or Hermione.
The rage he felt earlier didn’t disappear, but now he wasn’t sure what to do. He didn’t think Malfoy would thank him for a trip to the Hospital Wing and raising questions from Madam Pomfrey. Harry suspected no one knew about this. Zabini didn’t seem worried earlier when Malfoy flinched from almost every movement. He was more than sure Malfoy would not like to find out Harry now was the exception. But when had Harry ever cared if Malfoy didn’t like something?
“Mr Potter, she won’t be arriving just on your behalf, you have to understand. We had a chat with Headmistress McGonagall and she decided it would be good to have therapy available for any student in light of recent events… You just made us notice and act on it.” She smiled.
Harry didn’t even try this time and gave the most reassuring nod he could master. Ron came up behind Hermione.
“I remember the fields rolling as far as the eye could see, green and all soft-looking. Never liked them much, though. One time Mother took me to see the stars in the middle of the field and I got dizzy looking at the sky, it was so vast and high, I felt like I was losing the ground underfoot.” Malfoy smirked. “I got scared by the night sky, Potter. And I’m named after a fucking constellation.”
They didn’t see a lot of Malfoy. After a few days it became apparent that he tried to spend as little time in the room as possible, waking up at sunrise and coming in the evening late as they slept. It was impossible to tell that he lived here at all if not for the trunk half hidden under the bed and his name written on the parchment near the door. Harry knew he was here though.
And now Harry was hurrying to the library because Hermione wouldn’t be at all amused if he ended up late with all the essays they should write for tomorrow,
“Some of you are hurrying,” Harry whispered to the trees. His throat felt strange, he couldn’t remember the last time he’d spoken out loud.
he thought distantly. Harry turned to the sun and closed his eyes with the bliss, letting warm red shapes dance under his eyelids. He listened to the clock, with his luck there was very little time. But for now, he let himself to relax, feeling the tickles of the grass on his wrists.
I know you don’t now, I’ve been looking enough to notice. How dare you not wanting the privilege I do not have? How dare you being a star when I should’ve been it.
For example, what do you do with that stare of yours? Looking at me like that from across the room full of people. Me looking back is purely incidental because I wouldn’t like for you to set my neck on fire with that stare would I be turned away.
"What the fuck did you do, Malfoy?" Harry whispered, Draco flinched and something like panic flicked on his face for a moment, disappearing instantly under the familiar frown, "I mean, when you—" For some reason, Harry wanted to explain, "When you tugged my hair, that felt... Familiar."
“Harry!” he exclaimed and threw a weary glance at Malfoy. “I don’t know why you won’t tell me what he’s done, but it’s fine, now it’s the two of us and—” He scowled darkly at Malfoy, shifting to Harry while still facing him with a raised wand.
“Nothing,” Harry said quickly, turning his head down at his forgotten parchment with hardly any notes on it. “It’s snowing.”
The platform was as busy as ever. Harry found it suffocating. He tried not to look at his friends. Ron was visibly exhausted but tried not to show it. His freckles were a wild spattering of paint stains on his cheeks and nose, his back was rounded as if he carried a heavy weight on his shoulders, which was all more noticeable because of his height. Hermione appeared strong and collected but Harry couldn't help but notice how she leaned closer to Ron, either in support of him or in an attempt to find solid ground herself. At least they didn't talk. Harry wasn't sure if he could manage a steady voice.
Harry’s heart slowed down only after he landed on the snow some fifteen minutes later. It was still snowing in the evening and he couldn’t stop watching the Slytherin table.
“Sorry,” Harry mumbled and looked down at his own wand. After a moment of hesitation he held it up to Malfoy. “I’m not good at healing spells, so you could borrow mine.”
I want to get closer to you, always had, I admit. I want to be something the star looks at. And then I could be above you, above you,
Cold air hit him square in the face and snowflakes seemed to become more savage than usual. The weather was becoming worse with each day and the layer of snow was almost coming to Harry’s shins. It was a good thing he could take off from it at any second. Which he did.
He couldn’t look away from the entrance to the passage. His heart was beating so fast but he felt cold all over. There was a child… They possibly had tried to hide in the passageway. Had they been found dead already? There was a lot of old blood, so much…
Hermione abruptly stopped and shot a quick almost apologetic glance at him. Harry could feel the irritation rising from the deep of his throat. He knew she meant well, but he didn’t need her careful handling. He was strong. He’d killed bloody Voldemort, hadn’t he?
He was glad for his best friends but now he threw the second book aside because he couldn’t concentrate. He sat back in the chair near the fireplace and looked out of the tall window of the Gryffindor tower. All he could see was the white sky. He sighed and got up. Harry was never the person of cosy reading anyway.
After longer than necessary and absolutely not enough time in Harry’s opinion, Malfoy pulled back and, taking Harry’s arm, pulled him in the direction of the Hospital wing. Malfoy didn’t look at him once all the way down.
After several long seconds of stubborn silence Malfoy looked away, frowning deeply. Harry didn’t mind the silence that much, he just had a feeling that Malfoy did. Finally, after another bit Malfoy sighed irritably, grimacing.
Harry stepped inside, trying to keep his movements slow. These fucking bastards… He heard some movement beside them that caught their attention, and in the next second the taller one shot Harry a relieved grin.
Anger flared in Harry. Ron thought he was doing this for his sake, but Harry couldn’t help but suspect that Ron was finally spilling out years of hatred. It made something shift deep in his stomach.
Harry nodded, not at all listening to what Hermione was talking about on their way to the castle in the carriages. His mind was dizzyingly empty, flitting from one thought to another. Some trees were damaged. The blue twilight looked cold and beautiful. The thestrals looked the same as ever — a little bit dead, a little bit mournful. The sound of the squeaking carriages soothed his raw nerves. Harry was almost certain Hermione’s voice was part of it.
"What? Tell me, come on, or–" Harry had no idea what he would do but Malfoy didn't need to know that.
Harry nodded. Vague anxiety stirred in his chest, he was constantly thinking these days that he was going to be late. He wondered how it far the Ministry would be from here if he took a taxi?
He often couldn’t sleep for hours and then at some point the door would open silently and there would come soft footsteps as Malfoy made straight for his bed and shut the curtains. Harry stared into the inky darkness above, breathing deep as his thoughts buzzed. When Malfoy came and his breath went quiet with sleep, everything would become quiet in his head. Harry could finally sleep.
Harry heard steps behind him. He opened his eyes but didn’t turn. The steps hesitated and then moved to him confidently. As they reached Harry’s side, Harry looked to his right and up.
Harry carelessly shrugged. “Who knows. It is often in my nightmares but now it seems rather nice, doesn’t it?
"Who do you think I am, Potter?" He moved closer, "Some kind of a fan of yours? Some ponce? Faggot?"
Harry watched an empty seat at the Slytherin table for the whole duration of lunch, something tight in the pit of his stomach.
He kissed Harry again, but this time it was just a peck on the lips as if just to support his words. It felt more intimate than the thigh pressing between his legs.
He felt slightly sick of himself for lying about such small things to his friends just so he could then go and be alone for a bit. They would understand of course but he didn’t want for them to think he’s trying to get rid of them or anything. They already saw when he was disappearing without any excuse.
“W-we’re sorry,” the taller said, still holding a hand to his chest where the Stinging hex it him, “we were just—”
“Then… I’m sorry, Harry, I know we told you we'd understand if you didn’t want to talk about what happened, but…” Hermione continued and Harry stiffened, his heartbeat quickening. “Harry, you don’t talk at all! And we’re worried, Ron and I, we’re really worried about you.” Ron was nodding seriously. “We— I don’t want to push you, but you have to understand, it’s hard, not being able to talk to you…” She broke off, brown eyes shining.
Malfoy stopped so abruptly Harry nearly bumped into him. He finally turned to Harry with the most strangest expression on his face that Harry had never seen before. It was strangely determined and serious but uncertain and a bit flushed. Harry stared back in wonder.
Harry went down the main stairs, managing not to get the ones that felt like moving today, and rounded a corner. He got to the tapestry with a dreary Scotland landscape and moved it to the side the way he vaguely remembered it.
Harry stared. He hadn’t even realized that was a thing. He felt vaguely ashamed that the thought of returning the hawthorn wand hadn’t even crossed his mind. He gave it to the Ministry for safekeeping without a second thought, since he already had his own wand and all. More than anything, he didn’t expect this revelation from Malfoy at all. And judging by the faintly terrified look on his pale face, Malfoy didn’t either.
Harry went for the kiss fist instead, swearing in his head. He was already addicted, it seemed. The intoxicating heat and sweetness were everything he wanted. And the fact that it was Malfoy... Harry moaned as the tongue slipped into his mouth hungrily. Harry's back hit the wall again, and this time there was a knee shown between his legs. It was almost too much. His hands found silky hair on their own accord. Harry gasped as the thigh pushed into his crotch, all his thoughts begun to flee. The kiss was so consuming, so hungry and desperate, it was so hard not to fall into it completely until nothing was left...
Harry walked in the late sun that gave more blinding light than it did warmth, looking at the trees in the distance and at the yellowish grass under his feet. Draco walked at his side, unusually silent today. Harry knew it had been Draco’s first session with Mrs Wright today. Harry so far had had two. He’d learned a lot about PTSD and Reactive mutism and had trouble placing all of that on himself. But… It felt better than not knowing, anyway. And he was determined to speak again soon for the sake of Ron and Hermione.
Trees whispered at them from the distance and the sun was beginning to turn orange, everything went warm under Harry’s closed lids. He’d forgotten that under his closed eyes there could be light too.
Draco just grimaced and averted his eyes, looking into the forest around them, even more dark and unfriendly. It was getting cool, the ozone cracked in the air, the sounds around died down again, giving way to heavy silence before the rain. The clock pounded louder with every passing second, painfully pressing into the head. Harry felt that he would wake up soon, everything began to slowly blur along the edges. He stubbornly looked at Draco, absorbing every detail, swearing this time to remember everything, but he knew this was doomed to failure.
“Anyway, so I actually like the night sky now, I’m not afraid of it.” Malfoy looked away from Harry and started talking again. “I mean, what idiot would be scared of that? I’m actually taking Astronomy as a NEWT this year, I could draw a map of all the constellations in my sleep for fuck’s sake. Did you know the brightest star in my constellation is called Eltanin? A nice name if you ask me. Also…”
That someone yanked his hand hard and Harry startled, looking at them automatically. He couldn’t see much but it was Malfoy. Harry absently thought that it was weird he was here, but felt too frozen to even blink at him. His throat was constricting dangerously and he thought he was shaking but it was hard to say. There was only one thought loud enough in his head.
Malfoy was staring at his wand with wide eyes and mouth a bit open. He didn’t make a move to take it and after a few seconds Harry was starting to feel awkward. Right, so he didn’t need any help, did he. He lowered his outstretched hand a bit. At the movement, Malfoy shook himself minutely and took his wand with a quick movement, as though afraid Harry was going to change his mind. Harry let go and looked Malfoy in the eyes. Malfoy was appraising the wand with a somewhat dumbfounded expression. He dragged his eyes to meet Harry’s and aimed the wand at him with this curious tilt of his head. Harry didn’t flinch. He knew enough about wands to know that his own wouldn’t hurt him. And Malfoy wouldn’t also.
“I’m nearly done,” he wrote it all already but he needed some excuse to disappear today at lunch break if he wanted to go flying.
Harry was grateful she didn’t ask much. Even Ron wasn’t asking him much, he just chatted away on a neutral theme, engaged Harry in the endless rants about how unfair it was not to let eight years play Quidditch, a hot topic right now in their common room. Harry felt a vague disappointment about not being able to play in a team, but he understood why that was. Hermione told Ron the reasoning behind this decision at length, but he just waved her off fondly saying she didn’t understand Quidditch. Then they began bickering as they always did, somewhat good-naturedly and with a high risk of snogging at the end. Harry just rolled his eyes at them fondly and said nothing.
Harry watched him go several steps further in the snow. It was beginning to darken as the evening was close and the snow intensified. Harry shivered from the cold. Maybe he should ask Hermione for good warming charms, the ones he knew weren’t that strong.
Harry felt interest in spite of himself, looking at her again. Mrs Wright leaned back in her seat and offered him another smile.
Draco blinked and realisation flicked over his face, followed by more panic. He made a step backwards.
“Rain is coming,” he muttered distantly. As if in response, silvery clouds rumbled approvingly distant peal of thunder somewhere in the depths of the sky.
Of course, he became more beloved by everyone than ever when he returned to Hogwarts. He knew what would happen but he didn’t. Students loved him (except some Slytherins, of course, but that was expected), even some teachers weren’t hiding their fondness very well. And soon Harry started to feel sick of it, of the constant attention and pressure. Nobody pushed him but there was always some whispering around, following like a cloud. And then he flew away from it.
Harry looked to the passageway again and felt his throat tighten and his mouth watering. He just managed to turn to the other side before he threw up.
Something changed after a couple of weeks. Harry didn’t notice at first, but as he lay in bed with no desire to sleep, he sensed the night stretching. The door did not click open. He didn’t think much of it; it wasn’t like he had a clock and a right time for Malfoy to come. And the night moved especially slow. He lay there and thought of the darkness beyond the room.
Snowflakes hit his face in quick, cold little bites and his glasses soon were covered in water drops. He slowed the broom a little and cast Impervius absentmindedly. The world became clearer and Harry took a second to look up at the sky. The usually invisible air was filled with snowflakes, lazily flowing towards the ground. All this air, waiting to be flown in. Harry smiled and aimed the Firebolt up, speeding in quick succession. A feeling similar to the one of falling tugged at his guts and then transformed into excitement. Harry was free to go in any direction he pleased, just turn the handle. That was familiar and dear to him, the only time when he really could let go of the concerns, fears and thoughts as a whole.
He would come back later and investigate. He felt a rush of excitement and curiosity at the possibility of having something to investigate. Ron and Hermione didn’t ask as they continued the way.
“I really don’t know how hard it must be for the younger children that witnessed the battle last May...”
They have spoken about this many times. Draco could not remember where he was or what he was doing before falling asleep. When they tried to touch, Harry was waking up sharply and dizzy. Memories of a dream unfolding a second ago slipping through his fingers. And after a minute Harry couldn’t remember any words, events, or images. Only stole scratches of emotions swayed in the head, suffocating him in the middle of the night or the early morning. The day after that Harry always would be spent with something elusive deep in consciousness with a clear sense of wrongness. So they did not dare to touch.
Draco twists around to gaze at his sleeping cat and Harry removes the tissue paper from the box to find it stuffed full of extra gifts. There’s a set of scarf and gloves for each of them, one in green and one in soft slate grey; a selection of biscuits that smell like warm spices; a hand-written list of the best spells to ward off cold weather; a battered set of Omnioculars; a collapsible teapot, and, perhaps most telling, a pair of guidebooks—one to Iceland in general and one to Reykjavik in particular.
“Is that you, Harry?” Shan calls, and he finally locates her at the top of the stairs, poking her head around the door.
He scuttles back and forth in pure joy, spinning in circles and skidding from one end of the hearth to the other, tacking quietly but almost continuously as he skitters onto a sheet of parchment, decorating it with blue and purple footprints. Apparently thrilled with this achievement, he runs back to the point where the four colours have swirled together and then scuttles back onto the parchment at speed. When he looks up at Harry and flaps happily, he covers his laughter with the back of his hand and knocks several of the horrendous essays into the beetle’s path. When Stanley immediately resumes his splashing and printing, Harry allows his inevitable twinge of guilt to be washed away in the rebellious rush of it. If Sunday afternoons can’t be for Quidditch, they should at least be for mischief.
“Right,” George says grandly, banging on the table to draw attention to himself. “Here’s the thing.”
“I blew up an oven once,” Otis says matter-of-factly. “It’s probably better if you haven’t done something like that.”
Harry rolls his eyes and searches his pockets for coins. For some reason, the ‘buy it yourself, you cheeky bastard’ just doesn’t come, and he purchases two steaming cups and follows Draco and the ladies over to a set of benches next to the duck pond. Danica produces an enormous loaf of bread from her tiny handbag and passes it around. Within moments, they are surrounded by ducks, geese, and a pair of very determined swans. The racket is incredible. Harry has to lean right in to Draco to make himself heard, finding out in less than a second that he smells clean and citrusy and that he has a small piece of leaf stuck to his left eyebrow.
The sea-green glow around Draco looks almost exactly like it does when he’s with Harry, swirling and flickering with a mixture of intense pleasure and anxiety. There really is something about the way he moves that makes her wonder if…
He doesn’t need to be in love with anyone, he tells himself firmly, tasting raindrops as they drip from the ends of his hair and into his mouth. He has tried, he has failed, he has created disaster after unmitigated disaster. And yes, Draco is surprisingly kind, interesting, and good with children, but that doesn’t mean…
Harry nods, but as he looks around the shop, he can’t help thinking that the thief has done a pretty good job of trying to upset Mr Borteg. The whole place is in disarray, hampers thrown around and so many bottles smashed that the air is thick with the smell of alcohol. The abandoned Christmas tree lies on its side and all of the presents and baubles are gone.
Amused, Harry decides to leave them to it and head inside to eat his bacon sandwich while it’s still warm. When he reaches the shop, he is surprised to see a note attached to it. He takes it and opens the door, unfolding the note as he walks.
“Mother didn’t mention you the last time we spoke,” Mr Borteg says, looming out of the back room and turning his parchment face to the customer. “Then again, she was…
Harry doesn’t know what to say about any of that, least of all about Draco being listed along with his previous boyfriends, so he just hugs Rose and tells her to choose anything she wants.
… my nephew had it,” Harry manages, opening one eye. Feeling renewed sympathy for the little boy who had had no idea what was happening to him, he struggles into an upright position. “Has anyone got any Pepper-Up?”
“Why don’t you start at the beginning?” Molly says gently. “I’ll make another cup of tea and you can tell me all about it.”
By the time they step into Diagon Alley, the sky is almost dark and the lamps illuminate the cobbles in warm, creeping pools. They wind in and out of late afternoon shoppers and point out the windows and storefronts that have already been decorated for Christmas.
He looks around at the stall, taking in the rows of gleaming, spiralled lollipops, the sugar-coated snakes hanging from the roof, the intricately decorated snowflake biscuits and the pile of fruit just waiting to be dipped into a steaming cauldron of caramel. Harry breathes in deeply and tastes ginger and sour sugar, and when he bites into the fudge, the combination of warm orange and clove soothes his rattled senses.
Perhaps there’s no such thing as a life in perfect balance, he thinks, and perhaps that’s absolutely fine. Even Elegua cannot tell him what his future holds, but he’s walking towards it with Draco at his side, and he can’t imagine a better way to travel. Needle stops wandering around the kitchen and sits on Harry’s feet, pulling gently at his trouser fabric as if to remind him that he, too, is a vital part of the picture.
“I’ll send her a letter,” Florean assures, leaping back into action when the door opens and several market workers spill into the shop.
Unsurprisingly, given the choice of a bucket or a set of utensils, the children have gone for the noisy option, so the staff are carrying most of the buckets. Sam has three all to himself. But it’s alright, she thinks. She just has to find the right words to motivate them.
“I didn’t,” Harry concedes. He turns to Rose, deciding to offload the decision onto Draco. “You see that man there? With the dark coat and the blond hair? If you want to see the bus, he’s the person you need to ask.”
“What dress?” Neville asks, adjusting his antlers and leaning one elbow on the table with great dignity.
“The thing is, guys,” he mutters, addressing the stick pictures of Ron and Hermione he is now drawing on the window, “It
“Can’t we stay in?” he mumbles, shifting on the bed behind Harry. “We’ve got all that stuff from William.”
“Because he chucked me?” Felicity cries. “My god. That man is jealous and petty and… you know why he ended things? He thought I was having an affair.”
“Christmas Eve?” Harry smiles slowly, meeting Draco’s eyes and feeling his heart give a resounding thump. “That’s… that actually sounds really nice. So, me, Ron and Hermione?”
“More than I’d like,” Draco mutters, dropping to his knees on the wet path and levering himself under the back of the bus. “I’ve learned to fix most of the things that go wrong, but sometimes…”
“You brought him with you?” he asks, gazing at Hugo and then down at Harry’s feet. “Do you know you’re not wearing any shoes?”
“I loosened them,” Harry corrects. “Stanley wanted to be an artist and he needed some help. Everything else he did all by himself.”
She runs behind the counter and hugs him tightly before hurrying after Florean, already telling him about her favourite flavours as the shop door swings slowly shut behind them.
“Well, as I understand it, the originators of all of this come from the United States—Louisiana, I believe. In their town, there would always be a bonfire on Christmas Eve, and when they settled here, they decided to keep the tradition going,” Draco explains.
“Harry,” Draco says suddenly, and he turns. “Please don’t stay away. We all liked having you here. I shouldn’t have ruined it.”
“Your feelings,” Harry says. “I didn’t even know that you had feelings until that... well, I knew you had feelings, but I didn’t know you felt that way, and then you said that, and it was like the whole thing just hit me in the side of the head.”
“Where did you learn that?” Hermione asks, kissing the cheek of a delighted Rose and straightening up to look at Harry.
“And what time do you call this?” he asks, scrutinising his list of records for a suitable Song for the Shower—or perhaps an unsuitable one.
“His father will hear about this,” Fred adds, and Harry laughs with the others but can’t quite suppress a twinge of guilt for doing so.
“Cheese toasties,” he tells himself, turning around and heaving his bags back up to Sage. “I’m not scared of Narcissa Malfoy.” He grabs the door handle. “Maybe a bit. But cheese
Draco shrugs, accepting another leaf from Juno. “When you get to their age, none of that rubbish really matters.”
With the help of food, caffeine, and a gulp of hangover potion from the back of his bathroom cabinet, Harry makes it onto the bus by mid-morning. Despite his hot shower, the scent of Draco’s hair and clothes lingers in his nostrils, catching him unawares at regular intervals and making his heart skip.
Rose nods, eyes trained on Florean, who is now gliding in slow circles, wand arm outstretched to leave a trail of shimmering snowflakes behind him. Ever the showman, he seems to pull every eye to him without the slightest scrap of effort. Harry has no idea what sort of magic he has used to create a perfect ice rink in the middle of Diagon Alley, but he has done a wonderful job.
“Almost perfect,” he pronounces. “Just this word here—I think you mean C-U-S-T-O-M-E-R-S. Costumers are people who make costumes.”
Harry chews his lip thoughtfully, watching Danica stepping to the head of the queue and the others, behind her, digging in their purses for coins.
Harry glances at Rose, who is eating steadily and paying no attention to her parents’ disagreement. With a clear conscience, he drinks his tea and enjoys the show. Ron and Hermione rarely have proper fights—the kind where insults and or bits of crockery might be thrown—but they can bicker for England. Harry hasn’t got anyone to bicker with, and he’s pretty sure he’s fine with that, but from time to time he does enjoy a pointless argument in a nice warm kitchen, especially when he can watch from a safe distance.
Draco jumps and extricates himself from Harry, but he, too, is still smiling and breathing hard. Secretly, Luna is rather relieved not to have gone for the extra strong charm in the end; they might have laughed themselves to death, and that would have been no good at all.
“Ah, don’t make a fuss,” Gertie says, waving a dismissive hand. “Youse’ll no be saying thanks when ye see that garden.”
Needle continues to trundle around the distillery in search of adventure, tapping at the stone floor with his beak.
“Business as usual,” Pansy says, voice joining his on the airwaves and creating a fluctuating pattern of green light in the air in front of her. “Now, while I needle Draco for a few minutes, why don’t you enjoy today’s Song for the Shower. Turn it up loud and make sure to wash behind your ears.”
“Harry Potter is very angry this morning,” Draco murmurs into his omnivox, just as the usual grumpy owl swoops into the room and drops the Daily Prophet onto Pansy’s desk.
“Sorry to interrupt, but I have to run out to the market,” Harry says, and both men look at him as though startled to see him standing there. “Does anybody need anything?”
“It does,” Ida says, leaning forward to beam at him. “But it’s Draco’s magic, too. His magic and the bus’s magic are linked. It’s all very clever.”
“Draco,” Luna warns, and they both turn to look at her as though noticing her presence for the very first time.
Draco pushes away from the sculpture and falls into step beside him, stomach grumbling fiercely as if woken from a long hibernation.
Puzzled, Draco gets up to take the proffered paper. It doesn’t make sense. Harry hasn’t seemed the slightest bit concerned with any of the idiotic things the Prophet has printed about him recently. It doesn’t follow that he would...
“No, no, no,” Corrie sighs, waving her hands as yet another attempt ends in failure and giggling. “Where’s your rhythm? I know you’ve got it!”
When she emerges, they are pouring cups of juice for the children and shooting curious little glances at each other. Intrigued, she busies herself at the nearby blackboard and waits. There’s always time for another Cheering Charm, she supposes.
To his astonishment, Draco reaches out and touches the back of his hand to Harry’s forehead. The contact makes him shiver and he takes a step back, pretending offence.
“It was brilliant. Mum and Dad had some, and Angelina’s parents,” Ron says, grinning. “You two had yours and started having this weird conversation that nobody could understand. You kept pointing at each other and mumbling about glitter.”
Harry opens his eyes, staring at the small clock on the bedside without really seeing it. Until he does see it, and a jolt of panic makes him sit up straight.
“You said you didn’t know what you were doing,” Draco says, eyes narrowed in suspicion as he peers up at the place where the hole had been. “Did you use magic when I wasn’t looking?”
“No, Dad,” Luna concedes. “But it’s not really the done thing to turn up in the clothes you wear to bed.”
“I know, but I’m not going to see you on Christmas Day, so I thought perhaps I could give them to you now,” Harry says. “You can open them when you want.”
The deck clearly benefits from some extension spells, but it remains a charming, astonishingly cosy little place. At one end, a large, brass-framed bed much like the others sits under the curved roof, layered up with soft, cream-coloured quilts and blankets and looking so inviting that Harry wants to kick off his shoes, pick up a book from the pile on the bedside and climb in for the afternoon.
Harry walks out of the dormitory before he can finish. That night, he and Draco sit by the lake in silence, fingers tangled and holding on tight.
“Rose, my main concern is that you don’t end up with frostbite,” Hermione says without looking up from her rummaging. “Castles are cold and we won’t be able to use any magic.”
As he passes the fountain, he realises that the water has frozen completely, leaving the surface solid and the spray caught in mid-spurt, ice arcing gracefully as though captured in a snapshot. There is no sign of the swan, and Harry’s curiosity gnaws at him unhelpfully. Had the little bugger really followed Draco all the way back to his restaurant, and, if so, where the hell is it now?
Harry opens his mouth to suggest that they retrieve their map when Draco taps him on the shoulder and points into the opposite corner of the distillery. Mr Borteg has been busy, it seems. Their parchment map is now tacked firmly to the wall, and beside it sits a desk, two chairs, and a pewter mug full of pens and quills.
“I must buy you a gift,” Miss Lister blurts, making everyone jump as she dashes for the shelves, scanning for something with such focus that Harry daren’t interrupt to offer help.
“Thank you, Rose,” Shan mumbles, and everyone gathers to watch as she lays out the pearls on the counter, stretches out the string alongside them and draws her wand.
“Take a breath, Harry,” Esmee reminds him, and he obeys, dragging in as much air as he can and letting it out slowly.
“Such a clever idea, putting the chocolate in the middle,” Danica agrees. “I’ve never thought of doing that.”
“Behave yourself, you’re going to get us thrown out,” Draco mutters, but he, too, is smiling, and all of them manage to make it to the end of the performance without another word.
To his surprise, Draco pulls the bus onto a broad grassy verge and stops completely. He leans over and takes the picture, examining it with lips pressed thin in contemplation.
Harry grins. Ida leans over and shushes them both. The curtains rattle open, and Harry shares an amused glance with Draco before giving the play his full attention.
“We already thought of that, Harry,” Hermione says, picking up the teapot and pouring. “Ron checked it out. It has to be an independent memory, which means not mine or Rose’s.”
“Well, once,” Ron admits. “You said ‘goodness, look at all those candelabras’ and then you laughed and started snoring again.”
“Yes,” Harry tells Mary Ann, and beside him, Draco is heaving a beleaguered sigh. “I had to make sure I got the best band for the job, didn’t I? It’s not my fault they’re always taking my picture.”
“The best mulled cider I’ve ever had,” Draco says, seeming to read his mind. “We should go if we have time.”
He walks up the stairs slowly, half-listening to the ladies’ conversation above the pounding of blood in his ears. When he steps onto the top deck, he finds Draco standing at the window, gazing out into Grimmauld Place and winding the last of an enormous ball of rough brown string into place.
“I’m okay,” the person in the fire assures, and when Draco steps quietly to one side he sees that the voice belongs to Granger. “It doesn’t matter, Harry. I don’t care what they say.”
“It’s... it’s to wrap around things that are fragile for when you want to move them around, like if you’re moving house or if you’re sending them through the post,” Harry explains, trying to keep his voice down. He has the feeling that gossip spreads quickly in a place like Strath Kinna, and he doesn’t really fancy being known by all the villagers as ‘those two lads who don’t know what bubble wrap is’.
A second, riled by the group, takes out her wand and attempts to disarm Draco. She fails, partly because Draco’s wand is tucked away in his pocket and partly because her command of the spell only allows her to produce a brief flash of red light that makes her squeak and run away.
She looks, and he’s right. “That’s what I get for walking down by the stream first thing in the morning,” she says, drying them with a charm and then looking up at him, frowning. “You’re here early.”
“Fuck you, Malfoy. Tell me what you’ve done to him or I swear I—” Ron choked off. Harry could imagine his friend being red from fury.
“Good, I don’t see any reason for you to stay here any longer, I’ll give you some calming potions for sleep and you’ll be ready to go.” She turned to Malfoy. “I presume you’re out of the calming draught I gave you earlier?”
He nodded and stood to walk her to the Floo, feeling exhausted and stiff with regret. Their tea hadn’t even cooled yet.
Harry forgot he’d agreed to meet Hermione in the library that day. It was a Sunday and he’d spent too much time on chess with Ron. It was raining today and the common room was entirely too comfortable with the crackling fireplace. Ron had been sleepy all day, he wore a lazy smile after spending the previous evening with Hermione. They were so obvious when they spent time together, smiling at Harry more than usual afterwards. He didn’t want to think about what they were doing, really.
Harry was sick of it. He simply couldn't do it anymore. And he knew it wasn't doing him any good but, against his better judgment, he just wanted everyone to back off. He was sick of the "you-need-to-talk-about-it"s and the "you-should-share-with-us-Harry"s and the "we're-your-best-friends-don't-you-trust-us"s. Of course he trusted them. His two best friends meant a world to him; they’d literally gone to hell and back together. He trusted them with his life. But just couldn't bring himself to say a single meaningful word.
“I’m a dragon as well, you know.” Malfoy smiled a little, eyes glistening. “You shouldn’t have saved me.”
Something sharp went through his stomach at the realisation when he looked closer. It was blood. Old, faded blood. There was a shape on the wall near the main stain. Harry thought in a strange haze that this was a print of a hand. Quite a small one. He stumbled out with such force that he hit the opposite wall, his legs instantly giving out, and he slid down to the cold floor.
Harry watched the map closely every time he had a minute. Of course, he tried not to let Ron notice to escape questions and that made it harder. But every time he saw Malfoy either heading to the Quidditch Pitch or already there, Harry would hurry there too if he could.
“The mind healer arrived some time ago and would like to talk to you,” she informed him. “The session will be for about an hour.”
Malfoy was looking up at him the weirdest way, painfully open but Harry still couldn’t decide what it meant. After a handful of seconds, he started to become more aware of how close they were. Harry moved to let go but Malfoy gripped his wrists.
He stood abruptly, gasping for air, and turned to the exit from the Hall. Ron and Hermione both called after him, but he couldn’t take more of that. Of Hermione’s pleading eyes and Ron’s confused but loyal expression, as though he was waiting for Harry to confess that he had been attacked or something. Fuck, Harry couldn’t take it.
"A word?" Malfoy's tone was cold and slow as though he talked to an infant. But it sent a shiver down Harry's spine nonetheless. He wasn't used to hearing it. His mind unhelpfully recalled the way Malfoy had said 'I hate you' in his dream earlier.
Harry moved as close as possible without touching Draco. He wanted more time, just a few more seconds. The clock pounded mockingly in his ears, hurrying. Draco looked at him, his deep grey eyes floating threateningly.
Harry felt something heavy in his chest. He opened his mouth to say something, to reassure his friends (he could speak, he had no problem speaking when he was alone), he wanted to say that it was fine and they shouldn’t worry and he was
Malfoy’s blond hair glowed faintly under the line of light seeping out from the slight gap between their door and a wall. It was golden.
Malfoy opened his mouth to say something, then closed it. He looked up the corridor and then again at Harry for a second and again forwards.
Ron muttered something as he stormed into the room. Harry breathed in deep and went after him, thinking, ‘What the actual fuck?’
“I meant— Er, you know, I fly, sometimes I mean, not in general,” what was he doing fucking hell, “and, you know, McGonagall said we aren’t playing Quidditch this year and— It helps me to clear my head sometimes. I mean, when was the last time you flew on a broom?”
? Who I am? I feel equally undeserving and greedy for your attention for a second. And the next: the last part wins. I always felt entitled to your attention, and so far I haven’t been proven wrong, have I?
Malfoy just smiled at him with the corner of his mouth but there was a deep sadness in his expression. That was so unusual to look at and Harry didn’t like it one bit. He wanted other unusual Draco Malfoy, the one who laughed without any other meaning except joy. So he scooped up some snow and went straight for the sad face.
“It will rain. Rain! Right, because rain will pour out of my grey eyes, Potter!" the bitter laugh was more like a howl, Harry’s throat clenched painfully. Lightning flashed.
Harry went flying the very next day. It was Saturday, and by the early afternoon, he was restless and jittery. He wanted to find Malfoy again to ask him about anything really, he was bored out of his mind. Saturdays Ron and Hermione spent together at Hogsmeade, all eighth years were allowed to visit the village every weekend. At first, they suggested Harry go with them but it was clear they wanted to be together for a bit, so he always declined. Soon they stopped asking him.
When Harry caught up with the words and the meaning, he felt a sharp ping of sympathy and ache. The last time Malfoy went flying. Harry was an idiot.
Some birds were making a distant conversation, Harry listened to them sing. The wind rustled softly through the trees surrounding the lake, making some leaves take off.
Harry turned to Malfoy standing some feet away and already looking irritated. Harry couldn't quite believe he called him. The silence was stretching. Draco lifted one eyebrow in exasperation.
Harry had no idea how long he had been lying like this, unmoving and wide awake, swimming in self-pity and being angry with himself for it. But suddenly he heard the heavy main door of the hospital wing click open. Harry startled a bit, not sure if his mind was playing tricks on him. The entrance was right in his line of view so he looked in that direction, not moving. It was pitch-black in that corner but soon Harry saw a slim figure appear in the square of dim yellow light from the corridors. He thought it looked familiar and frowned.
Worried that he is about to be reprimanded, Draco is quite grateful for the return of their waiter asking if they’re ready to order.
He had to pull himself together. Harry was NAKED. And Draco was the one feeling awkward. Go fucking figure. Harry was the brave one after all.
But Harry can’t give the game away that easily. He has to at least TRY and fight for his dignity, even though it has been dragged straight through the mud and then run over by a Thestral. He takes a breath and says in a pitch higher than he’s ever fucking reached before (because of course it would be now that his superior vocal range would be revealed): “What?”
“Don’t pretend you don’t know exactly how I feel about you, Potter,” Draco spat, his voice as loud as ever. He either didn’t care or hadn’t noticed the students milling from the Great Hall to watch the showdown.
Harry laughed at Draco’s pouting face. “Is that why you’re wearing the sweater you told me you’d never be caught dead in? The one you suggested we use as a foot towel?”
And then something strange happened - Potter sighed, releasing a long drawn out breath - and when he spoke, it appeared his previous anger had vacated in the same air. “Have you tried coaxing it out with something else valuable?”
Professor Slughorn gestures for Harry to approach, then address the rest of the class. “Did I tell anyone else to stop working? Eyes on your own cauldrons please.”
“Chess is boring.” When Ron introduced him to Wizard’s chess, Harry loved it. But the novelty of the pieces destroying each other wears off eventually and then you’re just left with chess. Which is boring.
The restaurant was a dead giveaway, even if Harry hadn’t seen the box. It required reservations months in advance - which Draco had made (!) - and cost more than Harry’s monthly Head Auror paycheck. It was far from a regular Saturday night dinner affair.
There was a short silence and then a whisper in Draco’s ear, meaning Potter was a lot closer than Draco realised. “Come with me.”
“Why didn’t I just wait around for you, you mean?” Harry counters, bitterness leaking into his tone. He’s mad and he wants Draco to know it. It’s not fair for Draco to play the scorned lover. Not when the part is rightfully Harry’s. “Why didn’t I follow you halfway across the world, or wherever the hell you went, like an obedient little house-elf, you mean?”
“Oh, of course,” Malfoy said, his face softening and the smirk returning. “You’re quite partial to Weasleys, aren’t you? Ginny. Charlie. Or is it just redheads you like? How very Gryffindor of you.”
Okay - his nerves still had a little bit of a say. He didn’t pull his pants down, but he did slip a hand beneath the waistband of his underwear and grip his now ridiculously hard dick. And he definitely didn’t imagine the hitch in Harry’s breathing at the action, despite the fact that Harry couldn’t be getting much of a view at all.
“Not if you don’t apologise,” he teases, picking up his broom and backing up, preparing to head back to the castle, expecting
Draco was already pulling his briefs down, and grabbing a hold of his own cock as soon as it was exposed. He listened to the slick movements over the speaker - Merlin, just the thought of Potter with a hand on his dick! - and timed his own movements to match. With the sound of Potter’s laboured breathing filling his bedroom as well, it was almost as if Draco was the one stroking Potter. Almost.
Malfoy’s face was bright red now and there was no mistaking whose magic had caused the switch-up. But it was Harry who had the power to fix it.
. It’s you. I like you,” he confessed, slumping under Harry’s gaze. “Now that you’ve humiliated me, can we please ignore each other for the rest of our existence?”
He supposed it was rather bold, but it was just as bold of Potter to give Draco his phone number the year before. A tidbit Draco had worked out months after the fact, thanks to Pansy being nosey (as per usual) and discovering the number in his contacts.
Harry tucked Teddy into bed while Draco saw his friends off. He figured he’d quietly slip away and avoid any awkward encounter with Draco - from what he’d overheard Draco was quite tipsy. With one last kiss to Teddy’s forehead, Harry turned to make his quick exit.
“Oh, Draco!” Narcissa says, her eyes dangerously wet as she pulls Draco in for another hug. “Of course, of course.”
“Fine.” Harry triumphs internally. Malfoy takes a few steps backwards. “But tonight. After curfew. I fly better in the dark.”
Harry whirls around to face the voice in the darkness. He finds Draco laying down in bed but clearly not by choice. Thick streams of dark red smoke twist around his body, keeping him pinned in position, his hands helpless at his side. Harry runs to him immediately, reaching out to the smoke, as if to rip and tear it away, but it burns his hands and he springs back in surprise.
“How do you– that can’t be legal, Potter. I’ll have you–” The charm activates in Harry’s pocket a second time and then a third before the pings are so fast, he loses count. Malfoy’s face changes. “Get your wand out,” he says.
Draco played with his hair in the reflection, pulling it back so it was slick against his head and wishing he had gel or a hair tie on him to keep it in place. Even that would make all the difference and make him somewhat presentable. Then there was the open necked shirt. Clearly, that was a mistake. And there was no quick fix for it.
Either way, the result ended up the same. Every November 3rd, the universe seemed to grant Draco Malfoy a chance with Harry Potter. A chance for what exactly, it wasn’t always clear. But something more than their rivalry. Something more than the empty words they shouted at each other across the schoolyard. Something that grew into a little bit more
“I won’t answer that,” Draco interrupted. His lips quirked upwards. “At least, not without Veritaserum.”
Inside, the room was hushed as people looked up to the stage where a woman stood tapping on the microphone with poorly disguised discomfort. She had thick bushy hair that framed her warm brown face. She smiled awkwardly at the crowd revealing a slight overbite and large teeth. What most took Draco’s interest, however, was the tight black velvet dress she wore. He searched the crowds to find Pansy – it wasn’t hard, the peach stood out amongst a sea of black and navy. She was staring up at the woman onstage with rapt attention.
Harry takes a seat in the corner of room, and readjusts his cloak so that it covers him completely. He can’t have Malfoy walking in and finding one of his limbs dangling. He pulls out the Marauders map and scans the castle for Malfoy’s name. Harry has no idea where he would be, so it’s no easy task filtering through the hundreds of students and teachers, the endless passageways and secret rooms. No Malfoy. But he
Zabini frowns and pulls his arm away. He speaks in a low voice that Harry can’t catch across the length of the classroom no matter how far he leans forward. Malfoy’s absurd smile drops and he whispers back. Perhaps Harry would have been better off brewing Felicia Falcon’s
physically. But mentally it’s a whole different rollercoaster. When your brain is so convinced you’re dead despite your body waking up, there is a bit of a delay before you feel anything like yourself again. And Harry’s brain has been told it’s dead twice in one night. It’s a bit much.
And Harry wonders what’s he supposed to make of this. Is he supposed to…er…how to put this…take this as an invitation to fuck Malfoy? Because he’s not so sure that he’s ready for that. And he isn’t too sure on Malfoy’s intentions either. Fuck, this was so much easier when it was a dream, or at least when Harry thought it was a dream. Now, every embarrassing thing he does or says or doesn’t do or doesn’t say is as embarrassing if it happened in broad daylight. Because this is real. He’s with Malfoy for fucking real. And it’s terrifying.
“Does this feel good?” Harry asked, starting a gentle hand at Draco’s neck and slowly trailing his fingers down Draco’s chest.
Potter was being difficult. Even more so than usual. There was a smugness to his attitude that Draco couldn’t bear, especially after the stunt he'd pulled last night.
Malfoy turns to Harry with a laugh. “You’re so uncivilized,” he says. It should be an insult but it’s not, not when Malfoy’s face crinkles at the edges like that, not at all.
Harry couldn’t tell if it was a genuine question or a jibe. He wished Draco would give him some clue. “It’s not that I’m lying,” he answered carefully. “It’s just that I’m not always telling the full truth.”
“But you’ve thought about it. I’m quite a talented Legilimens, Potter. You have to be careful what you let sit at the surface of your mind.”
couldn’t possibly resist a cry for help. Didn’t you wonder why my own mother had me restrained? I guess your pathetic lovesick brain is a little confused.
Potter stepped in front of Draco, making avoiding eye contact practically impossible. His eyebrows were drawn and there was a hardness to his face Draco hadn’t noticed before. “And that matters how?” he asked, obvious anger in his tone.
“Yes, you are! He’s chosen you. That’s all true love is, make the choice and magic will bind it. It seems like the cure didn’t work because
Despite no longer having a justifiable need to room together, Harry still hadn’t moved out of Draco’s dorm. Draco wasn’t complaining but it was only a matter of time before one of the teachers said something. They weren’t exactly being subtle about their affection. Harry seemed to have a malicious goal to make Draco as uncomfortable as possible in class with adventurous hands under their desk. Of course, Draco encouraged it enthusiastically but that didn’t mean he was above blaming Harry for it later.
Now now, Potter,” interrupted Malfoy, “no need to get so aggressive. Is it really my fault that you’re so easily distracted? It’s simple strategy. Nothing in the rulebook against using your opponent’s weaknesses to your advantage.” He paused to yank off his shirt, and then returned his gaze to Harry with a smirk. “And you had no problem employing the same tactics yourself.”
Draco cleared his throat. “Brilliant disguise, Potter,” he said sarcastically. “How could anyone notice the glasses or the scar when you’re wearing a green tie?”
There was a silence in which Harry could feel Draco staring down at him, eyes boring into him. He didn’t dare look up. “You feel
Potter coughs and carries on. “I mean, it’s been a while since I’ve seen…I didn’t realise…er…it’s good to see you, Malfoy.”
“Out with it, Potter,” Malfoy snaps between whispered incantations. “You’re making me lose my concentration.”
Draco’s mouth was dry. “Did you swallow it?” As soon as he’d asked it, he wished he hadn’t. It sounded childish. It was a stupid question. Potter must have thought so too because he didn’t answer.
“You really are something. Alright, I’m going to make this easy for you. I’m going to talk to you and tell you what I’m doing, and I’m sure you will hang up because I’ll be very,
Draco almost agrees to the “date” but then he remembers. Pansy. “I’m seeing Pansy tomorrow night. She’ll hex me if I cancel on her.” He’s not lying. Standing up Pansy is something you only do once in your life.
“I don’t agree with that either, obviously,” Hermione says, “but letting Malfoy get to your head is not helping.”
Draco shrugged, his hands playing with Harry’s shoulder straps. Merlin, Harry looked good in his Quidditch uniform. “Well, I have been learning from the best.”
Potter rolled his eyes. “I’m glad that I’ve been privy to this insightful analysis of Draco Malfoy.”
responsibility. I can’t just sit in my dorm like a good little boy and forget that I did this to him. And he’s sad, Hermione. So sad. I can see it. I want to…no, I
“No,” Draco lied quickly and immediately regretted it. Denial was his go-to strategy for many things but in order for it to work in this instance, he’d have to convince Potter to believe his word over his own eyes, and Draco wasn’t that good of a liar.
“So, I can see how bad it is,” Harry explains, rolling up his sleeves. Malfoy’s eyes follow the action. “
Harry’s hand dropped and Draco wasted no time in closing the curtains. His had no choice but to release his glamour, the strain too much on him, even before he’d casted any privacy spells. There were tears spilling out of his eyes. An involuntary sob escaped his throat.
Harry considers lying. He’s spent years keeping things to himself, letting dark thoughts grow and take hold within his head. But he doesn’t want to feel like that again.  “I’m worried -” he starts, bracing himself for Ron’s reaction to the next part: “-about Malfoy.”
Malfoy stands up too, but much slower. Harry can see a wince flash across Malfoy’s face before he quickly hides it. “Are you that thick, Potter? If I turn up at St Mungo’s with a wound like this, it’s only going to add fuel to these rumours about me. To this investigation you’re running, or did you forget?”
creaking floorboard by Blaise’s bed – he usually avoided it but the early starts had started to make his brain a little foggy.
Of course, Draco Malfoy would turn up at Madam Puddifoot’s of all places right when Harry was to meet his soulmate for the first time. Now, if he really got stood up, or rejected, the humiliation would be that much worse. Malfoy would surely never let Harry live it down. It would be his fuel to tease Harry for the remainder of their eighth year.
Draco decides to give Potter a pass for now. He isn’t nagging him yet, although it’s probably only a matter of time. All his friends do it, and he supposes Potter is almost at friend territory. Almost. So he calls him out on something else entirely. “So, you have strangers in your house regularly, then?”
, you pay attention to me,” he mumbled. He tried to steal the glass back, but Draco held it out of his reach.
“No,” Harry clarified into his pillow, “I just don’t see why I should have to be inconvenienced because of your paranoia.”
“No, you’re not. Because I want nothing more than to slam your head into the ground over and over again. Which means you’re affecting me. And if you’re affecting me, I’m affecting you.”
Harry takes a breath. Surely the boy who lived (and died!) can handle Blaise Zabini. “Hi,” he begins, discreetly rubbing his sweaty palms on his trousers. “Is Malfoy okay?”
How long did it take to leave a hickey anyway? There should have been a mark by now. Except Potter was moving his mouth around quite a bit, not committing to a single area, and clearly dragging out the process. It had to mean he was enjoying it too. It
“Ah.” Draco hasn’t even opened the menu. He doesn’t suppose there’s much point now since he seems to be having issues with his vision. It was probably that green mush his mother made him eat a couple of nights ago. He’d only had a spoonful, but he knew it couldn’t be good for him. “Whatever you’re having.” Draco says dismissively. At least he won’t have to think about it now.
“Did you get them?” Draco asked, without looking up. He hadn’t torn his head from the screen all day. Not since Harry had introduced him to “viddy” games, as Draco was calling them.
When he comes back to, whether minutes or hours later Draco has no idea, he is lying down on a cold hard floor, and there’s a panicked voice at his ear.
“He’s…a little difficult,” Tonks explained, “But he’s my cousin and I promised his mother I’d get him a job. I’ve been trying to teach him but he’s testing my patience. Can you please take him off my hands so I can do some accounting?
All in all, it’s a successful night…of building trust of course. Even if Malfoy still won’t tell Harry what’s going on when he asks again. Obviously, trust takes time, so obviously Harry will have to keep spending more time with Malfoy. It’s the only solution.
Seconds from collision, Harry jerked his broom up, halting his trajectory as Malfoy did the same. They ended up, faces barely an inch from each other, their gloved hands brushing each other’s knuckles where they gripped their brooms. They stared at one another a moment, both panting, until Malfoy broke into a grin.
Draco wasn’t so certain how he felt about November third anymore. He’d come to terms with his unconventional feelings for Potter, or at least as well as anyone could, in the middle of a brewing war, when you liked the opposing side’s saviour. But that didn’t mean he could act on them. What it really meant was that every small bit of hope he held onto to left him even more thoroughly fucked.
Harry stares across the tables at Malfoy during lunch, feeling very much like they’re back in sixth year. Harry’s throat constricts in his throat as he watches Malfoy laugh at something Zabini’s says, leaning into Zabini’s body as he does. Malfoy’s eyes flicker up across the room and land on Harry mid laugh. Harry stares back, frozen, as Malfoy’s face tightens. And then those eyes flicker back down and ignore Harry for the rest of lunch, as if nothing has happened.
, eyes tracking the graceful stranger in and out of the pale light for what must be hours but passes as if seconds. When the sun finally rises, for the first time since his transformation, Harry wishes for the moon’s return.
Draco had already decided there was no way he was choosing truth. That no matter how awful a dare, there could be nothing more awful than being forced to reveal the truth of his feelings. Because that was the only question anyone ever asked in these stupid games. And Draco wasn’t a fool.
Draco just stared at Potter. He had no idea how to respond to such a suggestion. He wanted to ask why but the words never came out. Potter seemed to understand regardless.
For a second Draco considers lunging out of bed and yanking the phone from Potter’s hand but then the conversation reaches his ear and he relaxes. It’s not the hospital at least.
Now Potter only ever spoke to him if he wanted something. Like the time he needed to borrow Draco’s laptop to submit an assignment when his started freezing right before the midnight deadline – Draco deleted his history quickly before sharing. Or the time he asked for Draco’s Netflix password – Draco shut that down quite quickly, lest his obsession with romcoms become public knowledge. Or the time he wanted Draco’s advice on what to wear to a party across the hall  – if Draco couldn’t decide and Potter kept switching between shirts in front of him, then that was neither here nor there.
“Maybe you just need to remember how it feels for someone else to touch you like he did,” Potter continued, his voice back to a whisper.
“Because -“ Draco started, reaching for an excuse. “Because - because that’s unethical,” he landed on. “You’re a patient!”
Draco extracted his hand from his trousers, cast a quick cleaning charm on himself and Harry and zipped himself back up, suddenly feeling self conscious again.  Harry sat up a little straighter on the desk and closed his legs, but didn’t seem as concerned about dressing as Draco. Of course.
Immediately, the room buzzed up again, with chatter and wolf whistles, courtesy of Blaise - and did that one come from
Draco turned back to Potter and fixed him with what he hoped was a murderous glare. “If you really don’t know, Potter, then maybe
He looked back up at Harry whose eyes were fixed on his erection, it would’ve hardened under that gaze if it wasn’t already as stiff as a board. Why wasn’t Harry fucking him already?
Malfoy stands up abruptly, the chess board falling back to the bed from where it levitated between them. “You should go now. They’ll be serving dinner.”
Malfoy’s lips are surprisingly soft, but certainly not unwelcomingly so. Wet too. But Harry hardly notices the sharp pelts of rain anymore, his sensations fully focused on Draco Malfoy before him, and more specifically, Draco Malfoy’s delicate lips.
Draco didn’t want to play. But it was an hour until November third. And he knew something was bound to happen with Potter anyway. Better it be under the disguise of a game than something with more weight. They’d never addressed their unconventional conversation the previous year. Understandably, it had been lost amongst greater concerns, what with Harry Potter saving the world and all, not to mention Draco’s life.
Harry lifted his head from Draco’s chest, gripped Draco’s hips for support and pushed himself up on his toes to gain the height required to play tongue-hockey with his husband. But he didn’t get further than a small peck before Draco was pulling away, giggling.
Potter was already flying high, scanning the pitch from above Draco. How he saw anything with those ridiculous muggle glasses was a mystery. Which gave Draco an idea. He waited until Potter was facing the other way and pulled his wand from his robes, casting a quick vision charm on himself. It was a charm his mother always performed on him when they watched professional Quidditch games. It allowed him to see more than regular sight allowed, to catch movement that was usually too fast to focus. He’d never tried it himself before but he was relieved to find it worked straight away, although perhaps not as well as when his mother did it.
Draco could tell Potter was close because he had picked up his pace and his pants had become heavier. His dark eyes were on Draco’s as he rocked back and forth, his expression alone egging Draco’s own orgasm along. But it still seemed like Potter would be the one to get there first.
They were the silent this time as they danced. Which was good…and bad. Good, because Draco had a reason to stare at Potter unabashedly.  Bad because Potter was looking right back, and Draco wasn’t sure exactly what his face was revealing. Something pathetic probably. Something sappy.
Alarm bells ring in Harry’s head. Is someone forcing Malfoy to keep quiet? Are they hurting him in some way? “Is everything okay?” He asks, forgetting for a second that he is Harry Potter and this is Draco Malfoy.
Malfoy smirked and ran a hair through his dyed hair. It was Gryffindor red. “I hope that wasn’t meant for me, Potter,” he said, eyeing the cupcake in the grass. “It would hardly be sporting to throw away your gesture.”
And Potter noticed. When he turned back from the chair, he was facing Draco, and his eyes swooped down immediately. Draco had both the urge to hide himself and start stroking himself under Potter’s gaze. He didn’t end up acting on either, opting rather to wait on Potter’s next move, which he couldn’t imagine would be displeasing after the start to the night.
All too soon, Potter was pulling back, leaving a cold spot on Draco’s neck. Draco opened his eyes to Seamus approaching - inspecting his hickey far more closely than necessary. Potter was already walking away, back to his spot on the far side of the circle, which was probably for the best. What were they going to say to each other after
Draco felt warm breath first and then Harry’s lips, as gentle as their owner, leaving a trail of light tingling kisses across every drop of ink. The sensation sent goosebumps above Draco’s skin and a warmth beneath it.
“I’m a Death Eater,” Malfoy repeats, louder this time. “Denial is useless, Potter. It’s a temporary solution.” And then quieter: “I would know.”
He leaned in and kissed Harry exactly as he knew his boyfriend liked it, hands gliding up Harry’s neck to rest in his hair, lips moving effortlessly.
“Fucking Christ, Malfoy,” Harry yells – because Malfoy’s right of course – “Can we just have a proper conversation for once?”
Harry had already decided he wasn’t going to choose truth. There were too many questions he didn’t want to answer and right now his mouth would readily betray him. Dares would be easy. He wasn’t too fussed about stripping to his underwear or skinning dipping in the Great Lake. Obviously, they weren’t his favourite 1am Sunday morning activities but if it was that or telling the truth, the choice was simple.
And when Harry leaned in and kissed him, so gentle, without hesitation, without even flinching at the scars all over Draco’s face, for the first time, he really did believe it.
Both Harry’s wand and his attacker’s roll from Harry’s hand as he hits the floor. The attacker goes for the wands, but Harry twists the both of them in the opposite direction, holding the attacker down. Now, if he can just free one of his hands to pull off the mask–
his interest,” she says as if it’s the easiest thing in the world. “You’re not going to Azkaban, Draco.”
It’s not the first time Harry’s died. In fact, it’s the third time the lightning green bolt of Avada Kedavra has hit him. So, he shouldn’t be so surprised when his brains flickers to life again. But, he really thought this time was it. In the split second he had to comprehend what was happening before the green bolt hit him, all he could think was
That’s when the sound hit him: Potter’s laughter. Except this time he was right here with him and not only that, Draco was causing it. And it didn’t sound cruel, or mocking. It didn’t sound like Potter was laughing at him at all. No, it was bubbly and bright and basically what Draco imagined sunshine to sound like.
A loud eruption from the stadium prompted Harry to open his eyes.  Malfoy’s face was still there, centimetres away from Harry’s, a wide smile plastered all over it. But there was something about it that Harry didn’t like. Something all too smug. He jerked his head back to take in the full picture, just as Malfoy withdrew his arm from where it must have shot up above Harry’s head.
Potter raises his eyebrows and turns around, gesturing for Draco to follow him in. “I’ll give you a tour later if you like. But right now, I’m cooking.”
As Draco continued to stare at his ex, a short, deliberate cough reminded him he wasn’t alone. He turned his head to find Potter watching him with an amused expression. As charming as it looked on an admittedly handsome face, being laughed at irritated Draco.
Harry wants to yell at Malfoy to stop calling him that, but he can’t. For once, Malfoy isn’t provoking him, well not purposefully at least it seems. He can’t fight someone speaking so calmly. If it weren’t for that smile, he would have thought Malfoy was teasing him, but he’s not. He’s asking him a genuine question.
“Is this okay?” He asks, looking back to Malfoy’s face. The tears have stopped but his eyes are still red.
Potter took Draco’s cock in his mouth and started a fast rhythm quickly, one that was bound to have him coming soon. Potter enthusiasm for Draco to come on his face was obvious. And hot. Did he mention hot? And now Potter was making noises that Draco could feel from the tip of his cock to the back of his neck, and -
Malfoy’s still pottering around in his makeshift Potions lab well past midnight. Harry keeps himself busy for as long as possible, but finally when there’s no more paperwork to complete, he grabs his coat and heads back down.
“Are you surveilling me? Or just hoping for a repeat performance? Who knew Harry Potter was such a sadist?”
When they arrive at the Gryffindor table, Ron immediately bursts out laughing, freckled cheeks pressed into his eyes.
Or the time Draco had taken Teddy on holiday and returned a day later than expected, and Harry said, “That’s okay, Draco, I’m glad you’re both back. I’m sure Teddy had a great time,” but what he’d really wanted to say was, “I thought you were both dead you selfish jerk, you never thought to owl ahead to let me know?”
The basic idea here is that Harry is losing his shit over some PG-13+ through the underwear stroking, okay fine M rated if you want to be picky about it and spoil the drama. And then – Harry nearly faints at this – Malfoy says and I swear I’m not lying, “Like what you see, Potter?”
to know you mean.” Hermione sighs, too tired to protest. “Fine.” She pulls out her own wand and completes the transfer. Harry feels the distinct weight of the spells entwining themselves with his wand.
Potter agrees although he’s clearly not happy about it in the slightest. In compromise, he insists on spending the night. At first Draco is a little confused by the negotiation. Surely Potter knows he is far too exhausted to…
“Almost!” Draco let off some more smoke and rolled over to his side, facing Harry. He winked and then: “Riddikulus,” he shouted as a flash of light filled the room.
Malfoy looks up from the knife and shoots a wide smile at Harry. In this context with a knife in one hand, wand in the other, approaching Harry, he looks positively frightening.
Malfoy laughs again but it’s only a single syllable, as if out of surprise rather than actual humour. “Don’t,” he says. Harry wonders if that’s now Malfoy’s favourite word. He almost misses the next part: “Neither did I.”
