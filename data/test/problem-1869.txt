“Fuck!” she says, walking right up to Draco and sweeping her hand right over her head to find the top reached the middle of his chest.
There’s silence for a few minutes then finally a message.
“Enough talking. Help me or I’ll slit my poor nephew’s throat,” Bellatrix said with a wicked grin.
Draco covered his mouth while Harry finished up. Harry pressed a towel to Draco’s abdomen and said, “Hold this. It looks like the bleeding has mostly stopped but just in case.”
“My mom is a hippie. My dad not so much. But they were more strict than you think.”
The woman, who had turned out to be their leader, stepped up to Pansy.
“Never,” Draco replied.
This town was hit first because people knew about
“Do you like it?” Draco says, putting an arm around Harry’s shoulders.
“Yes,” Draco said, unwilling to divulge the details.
“Well, we’ll just have to find it again. It exists somewhere,” Harry said.
“What are you doing here?” Draco asked.
“Pizza?”
“Pansy isn’t a very nice person. Less nice than me, and that’s saying something if you’ll recall. But she always had a good heart underneath it all. But then she got turned and… Pansy, the things you said…”
Draco is starting to feel buzzed. It’s not as pleasant as being high but it does help with his irritation at having caught up to the others so quickly.
“We could order a pizza. I didn’t see anything on the walk here but churches.”
“Charlie… it’s not what it looks like. Really. It’s not. I just met her,” Darlene said.
“How was that?” Harry asks.
“I’m sorry, Draco,” Harry said.
Pansy sat alone in Darlene’s house, unsure of what she should be doing. The sun had finally set. She supposed it wouldn’t hurt her anymore. She’d convinced Darlene not to tell the ambulance about her when they came. It wasn’t hard. They both knew that things would go badly if that happened. If people threatened her she didn’t think she’d be able to stop herself.
“Ok. Stop. Stop,” Draco says and Harry lets it go, smiling as it thuds against Draco’s body.
“Oh. You found my vest! Thanks,” Pansy said, walking over to grab it.
“At this point, I would settle for just having someone I’m dating.”
“Drive where?”
“No, really. With our history?”
“That one was a total joke. I can’t believe it,” Ron says.
Astoria took a deep breath and opened her front door. The figures standing on the perimeter of her front yard moved quickly. Astoria raised a golden hand, blasting them all back, each of them screaming. She would not be stopped. She started to run, one of the figures, obviously a vampire was at her heels so she stopped, summoning her golden energy into a lance, piercing his heart as he exploded into blood, ash and fire. The other one dove at her so she removed it’s head much to the same effect.
“We found this,” the third woman said, holding up Pansy’s vest that she had stupidly left at Darlene’s.
“Oh. You wanna be one of us? Uh… I mean I guess I could. I’ve never done that before. But you seem nice. And I’ll be a real good maker. I’ve heard some horror stories about bad makers,” Pansy said then sunk her teeth into her wrist, her blood pouring out of the wound.
“The Death Troopers,” Draco said.
“Whoa,” Harry says as Draco sucks with a purpose.
“This is a judgment-free zone, Harry.”
“Brought her back as what?” Harry urged.
Draco bit his lip, tempted to reply in a very lewd fashion but he somehow found restraint.
“What do you think Draco? You know her better than I do,” Harry said.
“Yeah. Guess so,” Draco said, walking over to pick up the bowl.
“Are you all right?” Harry asked, coming around and kneeling near Draco.
Harry stalks to balk but then he sees the prices. Way more than he would spend on a first date, that was for sure. Harry orders filet mignon, a rare treat. The waiter takes their menus and Harry realizes that now the two of them have to talk.
It’s Ginny.
At least I don’t think so. I don’t know what happened to him. I hope I see him again someday, though. He’s kind of a snob but really great in the sack,” Pansy said then quietly left the room.
“Ow. Shit. What the fuck?” she said, standing up.
“Yeah, my new friends said they were working to free the Dark Lord’s servant,” Pansy said.
“Harry… lately. Have you felt like you’re losing faith?” Draco asked, walking over to Harry, leaning against a counter.
Privately he prayed that Penelope he made it out of town as soon as possible. He had a bad feeling about tonight.
All three of them have nearly empty glasses. It won’t be long now.
“Harry, your boyfriends sounds like fun,” Ginny says from the floor.
“Makes sense. But the magic on her was strong. Even if you could break it… there’s a trap on it. I’m not sure what it does but… it would be really bad to try and break it,” Harry said.
Good night.
Draco’s lips clumsily kissed Harry’s neck while his hand slowly stroked Harry’s cock. He knew their time was limited but he wanted so much to savor this moment because he knew what might happen next.
“I want you naked,” Draco says then adds, “Strip for me.”
“Checking Twitter.”
“Salem. Not the one with the witches. That’s the other coast, unfortunately.”
“I don’t know. It can be.”
“Draco… I know how you feel about Harry. And beyond that, if we are ever going to stop the Dark Lord we have to save Harry. And then we have to find the others. Luna and Hannah disappeared ages ago. We’ll need all four of us. Meghan believed it and I believe it too,” Astoria said.
Draco quickly sped up his hand. Harry let out soft, rhythmic moans as his body rocked, grinding his ass into Draco’s groin. Draco’s boxers were damp from arousal and he felt like he could nearly come right then if he wanted.
Draco laughs and says, “I’m right there with you.”
“Your turn,” Draco says.
Draco instantly feels some of the fury inside himself dissipate. He closes his eyes and takes a deep, slow breath then exhales.
here. They knew who he was… who he really was. And they knew things about the other world, whatever you wanted it to call it. Miracles. Magic. The supernatural. The sort of stuff that let dead ex-girlfriends come back to life.
Draco grins and says, “Yes. Big men. Strong men. Smash!” then turns to the woman at the front desk and says, “We’ll take the single bed.”
.” Draco says it with his typical smugness but since he was paying Harry a compliment he can’t be mad.
Ron takes a drink and gives them all the finger.
Draco makes a happy sound as Harry’s head lolls back, helpless to the pleasure.
“That’s fine. You can just listen. You’re on the wrong side, boy. Don’t know who you are? Don’t you know what’s in your blood? It’s the same blood that flows through me,” Bellatrix said, grabbing Draco’s hand and placing it on her wrist, forcing him to feel her pulse.
“So, is this what a party is?” Draco says into Harry’s ear.
“Sounds easy enough,” Draco says, thinking he’s done so little that winning should be a cinch.
Harry wasn’t sure why he had come back to the Hollow. Perhaps it was loyalty. He knew he should go back to Seattle to live in the house that Remus and Sirius had left him. They had both disappeared too. Possibly into the dream world. He wanted to go after them but he couldn’t be sure that’s where they were.
“I want what everyone wants. Happiness. Security. To be fulfilled.”
“Sorry, I guess,” Harry said and leaned up.
“This is all so strange,” Draco said.
“Let’s just get the single bed. I don’t think either of us wants to sleep in a kid’s bed. We’re big men,” Harry says.
It was an accident. Sort of.
In a town called Garibaldi, a quarter of the way down the coast Draco finally stops for gas. Harry goes inside and comes back out with two bottled teas. He hands Draco his bottle with a kiss, only a quick one, like a thief. Draco likes that. He likes that
“Not much I can do with a Bachelor’s as evidence by my current pet store occupation.”
Harry wouldn’t speak but he stood up. He looked as if he had seen a ghost.
“I don’t know how to play,” Draco says, taking a glass.
A burst of excitement coursed through Harry. He hadn’t had this thrill of excitement for a very long time. Recent cases that had come through weren’t very fulfilling and Harry thought that he was wasting his time. But now, he felt that every boring case has led to this one. Only Seamus stood in his way but he would probably say “Sure, go ahead.”
"Draco, do you remember what happened before I left for the stakeout?"
"I love you so much, Draco" Harry kissed him, one hand coming to rest on his baby bump. At the touch of his other father, the baby in Draco's stomach kicked. Draco smiled up at Harry.
Suddenly, Draco felt a twinge in his bladder. He frowned. Did he need to pee
"Can I see him?" Draco asked, while discreetly placing a hand over his crotch. He was glad the tablecloth could cover him.
"You're the best, Hermione!" Harry gave her a hug.
Harry glared at Draco and made to say something, but was interrupted by James who heard the commotion and ran towards his dads.
He strode into the lift, avoiding the puddle of pee and staring at Draco.
, he thought.
???" Harry questioned Draco the moment he got home.
Surprisingly, Draco enjoyed himself, even in the presence of Muggles. He found out (probably a little too late) that Muggle clothes enhanced his lithe body and toned arse, and he was free to be himself here since nobody knew who he was and what the Dark Mark on his arm meant. He'd gotten himself piss drunk at the bar with Pansy, and was now writhing among the mass of bodies on the dance floor, hoping to get laid for the night.
Draco flew towards a far corner of the field, straining his eyes for the damn Snitch. Where was the blasted thing? He wanted to catch it quickly and hurry to the bathroom as soon as was allowed. If he gave up now, Potter would get the snitch! That wouldn't do at all. As if seven years of being humiliated in front of Potter wasn't enough.
"Nobody'll miss you," Harry replied instantly, but at the murderous look on Malfoy's face, he quickly added, "Look, if you don't turn back after an hour, I'll go find Dumbledore."
After several flights of stairs, they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.
"Level 9," Draco muttered, avoiding those famous green eyes. He looked down at his shoes, and vaguely saw Potter pressing the button. The rest of the journey was spent in awkward silence, and when the lift reached the Department of Mysteries, Draco quickly walked out.
"Yeah, it's from a car accident that happened when I was a baby. My parents died, and I was the only survivor." Harry didn't know what it was about Draco that made him want to talk about his past. He usually wouldn't reveal so much personal information to a stranger, but everything came out naturally in front of Draco.
When Harry and Draco pulled away, there was a thin strand of saliva connecting their lips together, and Harry gazed at the blond in awe. Draco was already looking like he just got shagged, with his hair in a mess and his lips red and swollen. Harry wondered what Draco would
potions? Are you sure that's safe?"
Before he knew it, a silly grin was spreading on Harry's face.
“No. No need to alert anyone to our presence,” Draco said.
“Dammit, I want to find all the tasty morsels and rip them apart,” a long-haired man said.
Draco sighs and shrugs, “Would I be here with you now if I had? Wait. That came out wrong…”
Draco wondered what Harry meant but was afraid to pry and be forced to give up his own secrets in return. He had promised Hermione he would’t tell Harry.
“Sorry. If it was anyone else… I’ve never been shy with people I liked. Just you. I hated you because I thought you were cool and then I loved you because I
“Dammit. I never would’ve thought of radio,” Draco said with regret.
“It’s beautiful at night.”
I’ll come over right now if you’ll have me. I don’t have to work tomorrow.
“Come on.”
“I get off in half an hour. Let’s talk. Privately,” Harry said.
“The Malfoy family household does not now nor has it ever owned a TV.”
“Are you a cop?” the woman asked, offering a hand as she guided her inside.
“Harry, if you keep that up I’m going to blow my load right down your throat,” Draco says, sounding in dire straits.
Harry turns off his phone and sets it down. He wants to jerk off pretty badly. Maybe even look at some porn and fantasize about Draco but he really needs to get to work. He doesn’t think he’ll hear from Draco for a bit. With frustration, he forces himself to get moving.
Hermione and Neville drink and Ginny raises her hand.
“They found his body. They don’t know what to make of it. Christ… I can’t believe you killed my husband,” Darlene said, looking disturbed.
Pansy stopped realization dawning.
“Thank God,” Darlene said.
“No, I’m really not. You’re just… so tall.”
“That’s so odd. How do you keep dating someone you started dating at twelve?”
Harry thought maybe Draco was a little aggressive in bed but he didn’t know he was this intense about it. And the strangest thing is that… Harry’s kind of into it? Or at the very least he’s not opposed to it. He’s been pretty vanilla in his sex life so far. He’s been thinking the most he was going to have to deal with is trying out anal sex.
With his smug smile back on Draco says, “That remains to be seen.”
“So, you put a pin in it?”
“It’s easy. One of us will say a thing they haven’t done. All of us who have done the thing they haven’t done will take a drink for three seconds. Then the next person in the circle says something they haven’t done. Whoever ends up being the last one with vodka in their cup wins.”
“I know.”
“Welcome to the team, I guess,” Draco said, reaching over to shake Pansy’s hand.
“Fair enough,” Harry said, having no means to argue.
“You thought I would come with you. I’m… sorry,” Pansy said.
Harry sighs. Tinder is so fucking useless. How does anyone meet anyone on this thing? No one looks interesting. Most dudes don’t put much information about themselves and they’re the ones he’s more interested in at the moment. Within a month he’s gone from realizing he’s bisexual to looking for guys on dating apps. His friends say Tinder is just for hookups and given the vast amounts of people in various states of undress he is beginning to suspect that is the case.
“All right. I won’t make you ask. The answer is two and a half.”
“Shit. I can’t drive yet,” Draco says.
“Uh-huh,” Ron says, skeptical.
“We started out strong. Lots of passion but it fizzled fast. I think we both still loved each other but… we just couldn’t make it work. So I called it off.”
“I’m fine,” Draco insisted.
“Yeah. Do you want ‘em? You can have ‘em for all I care,” Pansy said.
“It’s not like the alternative is much better.”
Draco snorts and says, “Apparently. If you’ll have me.”
While this isn’t a hard trail it certainly is a long one. Draco doesn’t complain, though. Maybe the dick is too full of pride. Or maybe he’s really not bothered.
“Living in a dream? That’s not comforting,” Harry said.
Draco looks dazed like he just woke up from a very long nap. He smiles at Harry and says, “Bring it here.”
“My hair looks like I just got laid,” Daphne said.
For the last couple of hours of the drive, Draco has noticed something odd about the car. He can’t put his finger on it. It seems a little sluggish. Instinct tells him he should immediately stop somewhere in Salem to get it looked at just in case but he doesn’t want to ruin things with Harry so he pushes on.
“Yeah. Or you could sit with me. I can’t sleep so I was going to watch Netflix,” Draco said.
Harry propels himself off the wall and strides over to the car, looking gorgeous in the morning sun. The bastard doesn’t know how beautiful he is. It’s infuriating. For all his insecurities Draco never loses touch with his worth and knows when to flaunt it.
Bellatrix started to rise up.
“Well, that’s one thing we actually have in common.”
“Hey. Sorry, I didn’t think you’d be up,” Draco said, presumably referring to his current shirtless state.
They are both quiet for a minute. Harry breaks the silence, saying, “I can’t believe I called you daddy.”
“Harry, if there’s one thing I can promise you it’s that I will never come up short,” Draco says, looking very pleased with himself.
“Just be yourself and you’ll be fine.”
“It’s the agreement we made. I’m OK with it as long as you are,” Pansy said.
The Hollow seemed quiet. Too quiet, Harry thought as he sat on the front porch of his parent’s house. Riddle had been saying a lot of disturbing things. Stirring up fear, sowing divisions. He was planning something. He made vague references to potential terror attacks. Harry knew that if things went south, his number would come up. He wondered where Hannah and Luna were. At least he knew Astoria was safe with Draco. Harry laughed. He had that backward: Draco was the one safe with her.
Draco sighed.
“I bet you are. Aren’t guys supposed to brag about their huge dicks, anyhow?”
I just wanted to let you know what a great time I had. Don’t feel bad about the car troubles. At first, I thought this was kind of crazy, you and me. But I don’t know. I think I was wrong.
Harry laughs.
Harry glances and realizes what Draco has noticed. Harry grabbed Draco’s hand without even thinking about it. Harry smiles and looks away, feeling a little embarrassed. But Draco squeezes his hand harder so Harry squeezes back.
“No. I’ll be fine. I can’t sleep and if they come back…” Harry trailed.
The first time Draco set eyes on Harry he was instantly attracted to him. It had only taken a few weeks. Whoever Draco really was, he had money. He still seemed to exist. He was able to get a hotel room while he searched for Harry Potter. Found him on Twitter of all places. Tagged himself as work in a cafe. Draco didn’t want to seem like a creepy stalker but he’d written the man’s name down a lot. They probably knew each other.
Draco had fantasized about all sorts of other people while having sex with Pansy, especially Harry.
“So, let’s assume I know what you’re looking for in a guy,” Draco says, gesturing at himself then continuing, “What do you look for in a girl?”
Draco thinks and shakes his head.
“Left.”
“I don’t know them. Jesus, how did we not smell anything?” Harry called out.
He stared at the name, typing it into his phone without removing his eyes. He hit enter and looked at his phone. The search gave him nothing. Nothing at all.
“Well… now what do we do? The whole town is dead or gone. Or both,” Draco said.
Harry doesn’t seem bothered and gives Draco a kiss.
Harry shakes his head.
“I must need to clean my ears out or something cause I can’t grasp what you’re sayin’,” Pansy said, exasperated.
“Sorry. I mean… no. I’m not. He seemed like a piece of shit. But I’m sorry if you’re sad about it,” Pansy said.
Neville is one of my roommates now. And I only kicked you in the balls because I knew he wouldn’t.
It’s the truth. He does love it, a fact the pre-come dripping down his own dick can attest to.
Draco gives Harry a wide-eyed look and Harry smiles and shrugs.
Neville and Cho both drink. That’s the end for Cho. She sets her glass down then wanders off to the bathroom. Harry, Ron, and Neville are running low. Draco still has most of his.
When Draco gets back on the bed Harry can’t tell what he has. Then the sensation of what Harry believes is leather hits his upper back on the right side. Harry blows out air, taken aback by the sharpness.
“What?” Harry said.
Harry suddenly feels hot, thinking it must be the wine at first before remembering they hadn’t ordered any. No, it was just Draco and his curious gaze.
I can’t wait for Sunday.
The man just stared, looking angrier by the second.
Harry yawns.
“So, now what?” Harry says.
“Never have I ever came first then refused to help the other person finish,” Draco says.
“Whatever you want, daddy,” Harry says.
“That I’m bi? Yeah. I can tell her anything. She’s bi too. She has a girlfriend. Maybe two girlfriends, actually. She’s OK with me seeing other people but there’s only been one other person I’ve been interested in.”
“I’ve got a big mouth, I’ll be fine. Can I get it down my throat? I’m skeptical,” Harry says, tilting it forward as he leans down, opening wide and sliding down.
Harry tossed his shirt aside and Draco forced himself not to look. He must be polite and courteous. Harry slid in bed and laid there quietly. Draco found it difficult to remain still. He was coping with the new reality and talking to Harry about Pansy had helped but now he was faced with the knowledge that Harry knew how Draco felt about him. Why had he told him that? Well, he supposed Harry must’ve known part of it. But Harry didn’t have the full picture.
And then Draco had fallen for Astoria. He loved her more than he had ever loved anyone, maybe even more than Harry, only with Astoria he lacked the painful history he had with Harry. Astoria was a good person, a better person than Draco had ever known, despite her own dark past. She hadn’t made Draco get over Harry but she at least numbed the pain of not being with him.
“Oh. I don’t do social media.”
Draco chuckles, turning red.
“I liked it better when you were telling me to do it,” Harry says, sitting down.
“My name is Draco Malfoy. Are you Harry Potter?” Draco asked with a smile.
Draco pulls back, less than an inch from Harry’s face and says, “I want you so bad.”
“Me too but that’s not what I meant and you know it. Run off with me. These ladies don’t need us. They’ve taught us everything we need to know. We know all their contacts. We can survive. Help me. Help me find my sister,” Daphne said.
“Hey. Where’d Daphne run off to?” Alicia asked.
Babe? That’s new. Draco feels a little flushed as Harry inhales then passes the joint over to Cho who is reaching over.
new reality.
“I’ve told you the sort of things I like to do.”
“It’s not too much?” Draco asks.
“Well, we are definitely getting your ass stoned,” Ginny says, sitting up and pulling out a bag and a lighter from the back pocket of her jean shorts.
“Hey!” Pansy said.
“How many people did you kill? Did you kill anyone I know?” Harry growled.
“Leaving? For her sister?” Alicia asked, sitting up and setting her book down on their glass coffee table.
“What did they say?” Harry asks after Draco heads out from talking with the mechanic.
“Never have I ever had sex in a church,” Neville says.
“Yeah, who’s asking?” Pansy said.
“Good. Let’s go,” Draco says, standing up and removing his jacket from the back of the chair.
“Vampires run cold. Don’t worry, once you have some blood you’ll feel better. And then we head to your home town to raise some hell,” the man said, popping his knuckles.
“That’s odd. And also makes it even more likely that us both losing our memories at the same time is related,” Harry said.
“I sure haven’t.”
“It’s cold in here,” Draco said.
Draco glances at Harry then looks down at the ground and says, “Maybe.”
Ron laughs hard but Hermione and Cho both drink. Ron looks stunned at Hermione.
“Of course I have. They don’t know… They don’t know the things you’ve done. The sacrifices you made. I do. You nearly died to save Hermione. That means a lot to me,” Harry said, placing a hand on Draco’s shoulder affectionately.
“I mean, I guess we can pee outside. What’s the worse they can do to us?” Harry said.
“Why don’t we set it on fire?” Pansy asked.
Draco gives Harry a sharp glance, tilting his head as if to say, Don’t test me. Harry shrugs and says, “That’s what I think, “ then shrugs again.
Draco grabs his balls and pulls as he slides the toy back to the head.
“Yay,” Pansy said, clapping.
Draco sighed. So much for trusting Harry’s judgment.
“Your chili is getting cold,” Harry said, realizing he still didn’t have the courage to make a move.
“Oh, Draco, I hope you’re ready. Ohhhh,” Harry moans, heat filling his body as his insides become impossibly tense then release, the first spasm almost painful as he shoots down Draco’s threat.
He stayed for five.
More silence. Harry needs a shower and then to head to work. He rushes a little through the shower, getting out and grabbing his phone, still naked.
Harry: “Never have I ever thought about my best friend in a sexual way.”
“That’s disgusting, Ginny,” Ron says.
Draco wasn’t sure how long they waited in the closet before finally coming out but it had felt like an eternity. He collapsed onto the bed and said, “Her voice. I recognized that voice but…”
“I didn’t have any choice. I had to do it. I had to do it alone,” Draco said, his eyes feeling hot.
Draco shuddered at the mention of his name.
Pretty good night, Draco thinks, pulling out of the parking lot and heading home.
“Of course I have. But I just… never thought of myself as the sort of person who eats it deliberately.”
“That’s what happened to my friends. When we first bound you. The magic bounced back and… they were gone. Like they never existed,” Harry said.
Pansy was latched on hard, Bellatrix screaming as she threw her head back. Harry ran forward as Bellatrix elbowed Pansy off. Harry swung with his golden light, knocking Bellatrix back into the side of the mausoleum, cracking the concrete. Bellatrix hit the ground, not moving.
Man hiking with his dog. Woman with a gun. Uncomfortably close selfie. Another uncomfortably close selfie. Guy who looks like a serial killer. Jesus.
Pansy shrugged.
Bellatrix ignored her, her dark eyes glaring at Draco.
He awkwardly frowns.
Neville is next, “Never have I ever ran a red light.”
“What? You’re looking at me like I just suggested we have cow’s balls for dinner.”
Draco shakes his head.
“Yep.”
Draco gets up to go to the bathroom, everyone else debating the next game. Once he’s finished his business, he stands in the mirror, attempting to fix and adjust himself. There’s a knock at the door.
“Please tell me you aren’t about to start singing The Smiths,” Harry said, standing up.
“I’ll take your word for it. I think I’m just hungry.”
“Yeah. And now I owe you a hike,” Draco says, turning to smile at Harry.
“Darlene. What smells like burning? Who the hell is she?” the man asked, gesturing at Pansy looking angry.
“Not really. I was like sixteen and we barely dated,” Neville says.
“Everything is better when you’re high. Everything but operating heavy machinery. Or mixing dangerous chemicals.”
“Oh. Well.”
Draco pauses to imagine Harry showering, the water rippling down his lean and toned form, down his back, and right over his perfectly sculpted-
“Can anyone help? I’m trapped in the cemetery. I’m afraid to leave!” the woman pleaded.
Draco admires her tenacity and ability to take charge. Ron is already pulling a game off a shelf in the living room and carrying it over to the dining table right next to the bar. Draco gets off the barstool and immediately feels a little lighter like there’s helium in his blood. He’s warm and loose. It’s nice.
Harry looked scarily intense. Bellatrix could barely move against the strength of his light.
“They’d say,
No one else seemed to know Draco. It was funny. It was like… he existed but no one cared. He had money and seemed like he owned some property out on the east coast. But searching for himself yielded nothing. He paid a detective to find any evidence he existed and there was nothing. He existed but only sort of.
“You can have tonight,” Draco said, moving his mouth to her throat, making her gasp.
“So, now what? Want to watch TV?”
“It doesn’t. Puked my guts up. It was horrific. Gotta believe I spent the rest of the weekend scrubbing every surface in the house. And I never told anyone because I was so embarrassed.”
“What’s your name? Do you want me to call an ambulance? It’ll take them a while to get out here,” the woman said.
“That means we’re stuck here. Fun.”
“So, what do you think someone from school would say if they saw the two of us right now?” Harry asks.
“I… I’m sorry,” Pansy said, brushing Daphne’s hair affectionately.
“Sure,” Harry said, realizing he wasn’t sure who the president was.
“Huh?”
“When I have I ever caused you guys trouble?” Pansy asked, wildly swinging her sword at Alicia who dodged and parried every time.
“She is kinda cute,” Alicia said, making Pansy smile until she finished, “But I still think we should stake her.”
Draco kisses him then steps back, putting his dick back in his pants and zipping up before leading Harry to the bedroom. The more confident and aggressive Draco gets the more Harry wants him. His whole life Harry has always felt the pressure to be in charge and lead the way. It’s good to surrender power.
“Hmm. Never have I ever… never have I ever forgotten to leave a tip,” Harry says.
Draco’s bladder was feeling urgent but there was no way he could take a piss next to
“So, aren’t you gonna ask me why I’m not dead? Well… I mean… I am dead. But not
“Of course it’s related. It has to be,” Draco said, the light changing, allowing them to cross.
“Oh.”
“That sounds gross. I must be a vegan,” Pansy said, crossing her arms.
“I told you. I told you a thousand times. Not another woman. And Christ, Darlene, this one looks half your age,” Charlie said, sounding disgusted.
“I think you are. You’ve been great. And think of how lonely I’d be,” Harry joked.
“Better not leave Harry waiting too long. I might steal him back,” Ginny says.
Draco sighed. He could tell him now. What was the harm? The world would be over soon. What did anything even matter anymore?
Draco hoped Harry was right. He had never gotten along with the Weasley family but he meant them no ill will… and that they mattered to Harry was good enough.
At bed Draco went down on her for a good long time, losing track of how many times she came. She returned the favor and then they finally fell asleep, Draco holding her tightly, fearing what the coming days would bring them both.
Draco desperately tried to turn but he spun out a little, screeching across the pavement. He realized he should’ve gotten a better rental as he drove fast in the opposite direction, heading towards Harry’s neighborhood. Gunshot blasted his back window, shattering it.
“If she’s out of the pocket dimension the trap has already been set off. Some sort of failsafe to keep her from ever leaving the town. I need to get her back in the pocket dimension,” Harry said, stepping forward, trying to guide her back into the mausoleum.
Draco shakes his head.
“How do we know you’re not still working for
“Me too. One of us should get some rest. I guess you since you’re injured,” Harry said.
“Cho. Sorry,” Harry says, coming over to her Draco casually following in an attempt to seem friendly and personable.
“I didn’t have much a choice! I was naked and covered in ashes and really freakin’ hungry. Look, I could’ve let them kill you last night. Or I could’ve woke up and set fire to this house while you both slept. There ain’t nothin’ for me out there. No one gives a damn about me. The Dark Lord don’t care about me. He’s got tons of vampires working for him. He doesn’t need me. You ain’t got nothin’ to lose!”
“A name’s just a word,” Alicia said.
A door that lead to a bathroom was open and Pansy stepped inside, looking at herself in the mirror.
“Well. More for me, I guess,” Harry says.
“Understood.”
The car isn’t ready until three in the afternoon, Draco and Harry having wandered all around the town. It is a nice enough place but there isn’t much to do. It also rains intermittently and neither of them have umbrellas.
“I wouldn’t be too proud. That’s not how we roll. Now listen, Pansy. Something big has just gone down. We know for a fact that Death Troopers were deployed for a town called Godric’s Hollow. We know that the Death Troopers left. Now, the trouble is that Godric’s Hollow? It’s gone. Poof. Have you been there?” Angelina asked, walking closer to Pansy.
“Oh god. Shit,” Harry moaned as his cock continued to spasm in Draco’s hand.
bad. What was she even doing out in the woods? She couldn’t remember.
“Are we going to spend all night rehashing the past?”
“It’s good. For what it is.”
“Yeah.”
“Relax! I’m not playing dumb! I’m telling you! I can’t remember what you keep saying. The place. I know you said the name of a town but I can’t remember it,” Pansy said.
“Thanks. Thanks. Have a nice day,” Draco said with a smile.
“Thanks. I tried,” Draco says.
Draco smiles and Harry realizes he’s coming to love that already.
Harry wonders if his parents would’ve been supportive. He supposes he’ll never know.
Harry sighed.
“Oh,” Harry moans, dick twitching between them.
“Well, she’s back now. And you saved Hermione’s life. You did do the best thing. I suppose if I’m being honest, I might not have gone along with that if you’d asked me. I don’t know. I’m glad it’s not a choice I had to make,” Harry said and he placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder again.
Harry sucked hard, his green eyes looking up at Draco, seeming pleased with whatever reaction he saw. Draco was ready to explode but everything in him still wanted to stretch this moment. He wanted to drown in his lust and desire but he knew it wasn’t practical.
“Still. Might be good to have something just in case,” Draco said.
The hum in the basement was still loud and present but Harry had learned to tune it out. Once he had near sleepwalked downstairs in the middle of the night. After that, they started keeping it locked. Mercifully the TV volume also helped to tune it out.
“So, we’re thinking… Godric’s Hollow has been like… wiped off the map. But how come we can still remember it?” the shorter black woman said.
Draco does the other cheek but Harry is ready that time. Draco repeats with both cheeks, harder and faster. It’s nothing.
“I needed that. This werewolf hunt is wearing me out,” Pansy said.
The inside of the house they had found had a limited amount of furniture. There was, thankfully, a bed upstairs so they would have somewhere to sleep. They placed their newly obtained backpacks down on the floor and sat down on the bed. Harry futzed with the radio while Draco pulled a bag of trail mix and a bottle of water from his pack.
“What the hell?” a vampire said as Angelina removed his head from his body, his body turning to ash in seconds.
“As long as she doesn’t get us killed,” Katie said with a shrug.
“You’ll be fine. You’re a big boy.”
“Nearly ten years. We broke up here and there but it was pretty steady.”
“Pretty good. I think you were a big hit,” Harry says, gazing lovingly at him.
“I don’t know. I’m not looking for a girl right now. I’m not looking for anyone else right now. I guess all the same things I would want in a guy. Good morals. Cares about people. Active. Likes sports. Hot.”
“Whatever. You know what I mean,” Draco says, a little flustered.
They blew through Downtown and finally ended up in Queen Anne, parked up on a big hill overlooking Downtown. Draco turned off the car and exhaled.
Harry smiles and chuckles.
“Yeah. Though I suppose he was right. It did toughen me up.”
“Next one is going in your head,” Pansy warned.
“You’re so fuckin’ big,” Harry says.
They carry on, turning inland. Draco has no idea where they are headed now but he thinks maybe they are looping back up to Seattle. It’s two in the afternoon now. Draco’s expected more complaining from Harry but he’s seemed nothing but delighted this whole time.
“No. I don’t want to die. My sister. I need to find my sister,” Daphne said.
“Yeah. I know. I was new. You don’t understand what bloodlust is like, Draco. You can’t ignore it. I mean… you can learn but my maker wasn’t exactly so inclined. Asshole. Anyhow, I was starting to learn to ignore it… then
“Who the hell do you think you are, girl?” Charlie said, raising his fist to hit Pansy.
Feigning mediocrity? What a dick. Harry laughs.
Being vulnerable isn’t the easiest thing for Draco. Being vulnerable and letting people in is a recipe for getting hurt when they find out that deep down inside he’s fundamentally broken. If they see his damage… if Harry sees his damage he won’t be interested anymore.
“I believe you,” Harry said.
. He runs through everyone he knows but every suggestion is worst than the last. It’s no use. He’ll have to brave it alone. Who knew the biggest dick Harry has ever known would have the biggest dick he has ever seen? He’s been calling him the dick all this time. How appropriate?
Harry slid his hand gracefully up and down the long shaft. Harry smiled at Draco’s cock like it were a nice painting hanging up at a friends house. He then pressed his full lips to the head and sucked down. Draco didn’t realize how sensitive it would be. Harry’s lips sucked up and down the head of Draco’s cock while his hand stroked the shaft, almost like a tightly functioning machine. Harry was experienced and it showed.
Once he’s home and in his apartment, he checks his phone. He has a couple of messages from Harry on Tinder.
“No. I don’t know. Maybe we have heat vision or something. I haven’t been a vampire for long. I think,” Pansy said.
“This,” Draco says as he places a hand on Harry’s face and leans over to kiss him.
The shirt is off and he turns around, working his jeans down little by little, followed by his underwear, showing off what Ginny insisted was an amazing ass.
“So?” Ginny says, lifting her glass at him.
But when Harry looks at Draco he thinks he could work with anything. The more time he spends with him the more impossible he finds the idea of not being around him. At first, it was just that he was hot, exuded confidence, and was a great kisser. But now it’s all the little things. His laugh. His smile. The innocence in his grey eyes. The moments of vulnerability that don’t seem to harm his confidence.
“That’s a nice thought. I hope I had friends. I like having friends. All of you… have been so good to me,” Pansy said.
Draco throws his arms around Harry and they kiss. Harry’s lips are very pleasant indeed. People think kissing is odd but Draco understands it. The lips are quite possibly the most sensitive part of the human body. And they are soft. The feeling of something so bounteous and supple as Harry Potter’s lips sliding against Draco’s lips is a sensational delight. Criminal in its decadence, making Draco feel like a man who is getting away with something. Anything this good should be illegal.
Harry didn’t say anything. He didn’t react at all.
Just then the front door opened. Pansy whirled around, seeing a tall, bearded man standing there in overalls.
Harry opens his mouth then shuts it, grinning, his eyes fixed on the ground. Draco laughs.
“All right, I guess they were pretty relaxed.”
Harry can’t believe his eyes. Draco Malfoy is asking him on a date.
Draco can almost hear Harry’s indignation. He feels guilty that he likes making him so frustrated.
“He doesn’t. But I do,” Pansy said, appearing behind Bellatrix and burying her teeth into her neck.
Draco smiles. “No.”
“Is that blood on her face? Oh my God. Pansy. You didn’t!” Alicia said, sounding horrified.
“I’m not sure. Make sure to drive safe,” Harry said, waving as she and the dog walked away.
“Jesus.”
“Wait, so you’re telling me you have never seen any movies or TV shows? My mind is breaking right now,” Harry says, sitting cross-legged next to Draco.
“Jesus,” Pansy said and pulled her sword back, swinging it against the vampire’s neck.
Draco chuckled.
“The president. Pansy started working for her maker and her maker worked for him. Then Riddle got elected. Still doesn’t make any sense. All those things he was proposing… He never hid who he was and he still got elected…” Draco said, feeling his anger rise.
“I’m not such a big fan of guns either,” Harry said.
Harry relaxed and Draco removed his hand from Harry’s cock. He kissed the side of Harry’s neck some more and Harry made some happy sounds. Draco wasn’t sure what would happen next but his cock was begging for attention. His balls felt heavy and achy.
“I grew up sheltered. My parents had all the money in the world but they kept a tight leash on me. The only things that were approved were based on what they wanted for me. My father wanted me to play sports so I played sports.”
Oh no.
“No, he didn’t suspect a thing.”
The music seemed to be louder tonight. Harry’s heart was beating rapidly in his chest. Yes, he was nervous. Even under the protection of polyjuice, he had to be cautious. He had enough to get him through the evening, but only just. Seamus had made sure that the bottle he gave him was only enough for one night, no more. This did annoy Harry but at least he would be able to satisfy his own curiosity.
Suddenly feeling a bit bolder, Harry grinned at Draco. "Maybe he's wrong. Maybe I am a pervert."
Harry stroked his fingers over the marks on Draco's neck. "You're starting to bruise," he panted. "Fuck, Draco, your skin...."
Harry was a bit shy when he first met Draco, and Draco worried they wouldn't be able to work well together. But all it took was a bit of subtle flirting on Draco's part to make the raven haired man more comfortable around him.
"Yep. Everything's ready and I've started recording," Harry replied. "But before that, I want to do something."
"I'm sure you're all excited for the winner of my little contest," Draco smiled at the camera. "I've read through all your comments, and they're wonderful. But one comment really stood out to me," he chewed his bottom lip thoughtfully.
"Why do you ask?" Hermione looked at Harry curiously.
Pansy was gaping at them both, for once unable to think of something to say. Draco snatched his hand away from Harry, blushing. Terry smiled.
"Wait. Your department uses
Harry was surprised to find that he was hard, but even though he felt like a pervert, he couldn't look away from the sight. He watched as Draco's trousers grew wetter and wetter, his pee dripping steadily onto the ground, not unlike rain. After a few seconds, the blond must have realised what was happening to him. He looked down, blushing and covering his crotch, and looked mortified when he made eye contact with Harry.
"Er... Malfoy? Did you.. er... that is... er..."
annoying!"
Every time he flew, the movement made the pee inside him slosh around. This was bad, Draco thought. He really needed to go soon. He wiped his palms on his trousers and adjusted his position on the broom, pressing his thighs together. It didn't help much.
It was Draco's 18th birthday. His house arrest had just ended, and his friends decided to bring him out for a celebration. So here he was, at a Muggle club in London, having the time of his life. At first, Draco had sneered when Blaise asked him to come in Muggle clothes, to which Blaise retorted and asked if he'd rather go to a Wizarding club instead.
After what seemed like ages, Harry
"FUCKKKKK!!! POTTTERRRRR!!"
"Coming!" Draco said. He turned around, making sure to let his arse sway enticingly. He could feel Harry's eyes on him but he didn't care. "Accio pasta," he called and Harry's food came flying into the room.
, you arsehole" Draco huffed, rolling his eyes and giving Potter's firm chest a shove. "Well? Aren't you going to laugh at me? Sell my story to the
He attempted to send a private message to Draco, but his hands were still too shaky and the phone slipped from his grip again.
my lunch appointment. So please see that it's fixed as soon as possible," Draco used the imperious tone he learned from his father, although it probably didn't have the desired effect while he was clutching at his crotch with one hand and trying very hard not to wet himself.
"Fine," Harry shook his head and wrapped his arm around Draco's waist, placing a hand on his bump while Draco hobbled along the shore, one hand holding onto his crotch and the other on top of Harry's.
"It's alright, you didn't know," Harry's fingers grazed the pale skin of Draco's wrist.
"Need to.. peee.." Draco shook his head and tried to wiggle away. He glanced up desperately. The fucking restroom was on the other end of the club! Draco knew that if he'd wanted to make it there on time, he'd have to start pushing through all the bodies on the dance floor. Now.
. He supposed he was about to find out real soon.
Draco sniffed again, wiping his tears on his sleeve. "You'd better make good on your promise, Potter."
To his surprise, Draco was the one to reach out, attempting to neaten Harry's hair. He could smell Draco like this, an enticing citrusy scent he couldn't get enough of, and his scalp tingled at every touch from the blond. If he didn't know better, he'd say Draco was flirting with him.
"You have such an interesting scar," Draco's brow furrowed as his hand brushed across Harry's forehead. He traced the faint lightning bolt shape and Harry suppressed a shiver.
"It's alright, we'll learn together," Draco fluttered long, blond eyelashes at him and Harry's heart melted. He ran a hand through his hair, partly out of habit and partly to distract himself from reaching out to touch Draco.
"No, I can't imagine what it's like to not know your parents. I get annoyed at my father sometimes, but at least he's alive, you know?" Draco said. "Mother's the one who taught me baking. She spoils me, but Father is stricter. He wants me to take over the family business someday, although I'm not too keen on it," he shrugged.
Draco was about the leave the toilet when the door opened and Harry stepped in. He looked relieved once he saw Draco.
inside and didn't even wash his hands!"
The man took in Draco's crouching position and crotch holding to mean he was free to grope Draco's crotch as well. As the man's strong hand slid down his body and gave a squeeze, Draco's bladder cried out in protest one last time and let go.
"-he'll never rest till he gets what he wants," Ron finished for her.
"Well if that's all, I really have to go." Draco took a step back. Being in close proximity with the Man-Who-Lived was doing funny things to Draco's stomach. He couldn't recall the last time he stood so close to Harry without some sort of argument going on. At this rate, all he could see was Harry's bright green eyes and tousled, just-shagged hair. Draco swallowed, steeled himself and made to walk away.
He couldn't help it. Once he started to pee, he tried to hold it in but it wouldn't stop. The stream of piss was never ending, and Draco could feel his underwear, jeans and expensive shoes totally soaked through. He began sobbing, thinking of how the mystery stranger would call him a freak now, when the man's beefy hand brushed away some hair from Draco's forehead and turned the blond around to face him.
“What I’ve been told is that the president is about to launch a new secret project. Death Troopers. Some sort of elite supernatural force. They are going to take out targets the president deems threats. Keep other supernatural forces in line. It’s been brewing for a while,” Draco admitted.
“Very funny.”
“Sociology,” Harry says, slightly embarrassed.
“We’ve done all we can. Our witches are working to free the Dark Lord’s servant from her binding. Once that happens… none of us are going to want to be here,” the older male vampire said.
“Oh, I bet you do,” Draco replies, wondering what else Harry was good at.
He was facing away from Draco, towards the end table that held the radio. The sheets only covered as far as his waist, his bare back fully exposed. Draco rolled over, convincing himself it was just to make talking to Harry easier.
“He’s not a vampire if that’s what you’re wondering.
“Did you hear the news this morning? Liberals are saying the president has some dark project he’s working on. Wiping out towns. Typical liberals. Always acting like fuckin’ martyrs. There’s this website saying that he’s evil. Like literally evil. As a Christian I find that insulting. The president is a god fearing man,” the man said.
“I suppose we did.”
“Ex-excuse me?” Darlene said, backing up.
“How did you figure out you were bi? Saying you started being honest with yourself isn’t an answer.”
“I could get on board with that. I rarely stray from Seattle.”
“I didn’t feel it would be right to… Well, to go any further without making my peace. I know I’m a piece of shit. I know I don’t deserve your forgiveness.”
“Two and a half? How can you kiss half a person?” Harry says, skeptical.
By the time the battle outside was over and the other girls found Pansy in the barn, Daphne’s wounds were fully healed. Her body seemed fuller and stronger, her frailty disappeared. She was deep asleep.
“We should take her in the house. It’ll be morning in a few hours. This barn won’t be safe,” Angelina said, coming around and scooping Daphne up in her arms.
“I didn’t kill nobody. I did feed off some of the corpses. But these guys use guns and I never really cared for guns. So loud,” Pansy said, touching her eyes and cringing.
“They’ll probably come looking for us anyway. But at some point we’re going to need to escape. I found some supplies in a bathroom upstairs. Come on,” Harry said, grabbing Draco’s hand then lifting him gingerly.
“Harry and Draco tied but really I say Draco won,” Ginny says.
“Hello. Oh my goodness. You’re burned,” the woman said, putting a hand to her nose.
“No. It’s you. You’re all I can think about.”
Ginny drops to the ground, sitting on the concrete sidewalk outside the apartment. Draco looks down. She looks impossibly tiny.
Nothing felt real. Nothing was right. The world was ending all around them and yet outside of this town everyone was going on with their lives. Draco frowned at himself and looked for his shirt while Harry left the bedroom, heading to the bathroom, reminding Draco that his bladder was full. Draco heard Harry pull back the shower curtain then shout.
“No, no, you don’t have to apologize. I’m just so confused,” Cho says.
“You’ll get used to them,” Harry says.
Draco tips his glass at Harry and drinks. Almost done. Hermione raises her hand, looking annoyed but smiling.
“How the fuck do you think it went? I was into it. Really into it. But I kept having sex with Pansy, hoping I could work it out. I just needed to fuck the gay out of my system. But all the time I was with her I was thinking of-“
“I miss you too, Ginny. Oof,” Harry says and she lets him go.
Harry thought of Ginny. Of Ron and Hermione. Neville. His friends had disappeared thanks to the big mess with Bellatrix a couple of years ago. He didn’t know where the hell they were. He need to track do Meghan. She was the key. But she hadn’t been around in ages.
“Hmm.” Draco’s internally trying to calm himself down.
“Probably. I hope,” Harry said.
I’m about to leave, Harry. I hope you’re ready.
“You can pull it out if you want,” Harry said, then clarified, “I want you to.”
Quickly he realized his rear driver's side tire had been shot out. He had barely arrived near Harry’s neighborhood before he lost control, crashing into a pole, the airbags saving his life.
“You’re hot and I had to know.”
“We need a safeword,” Draco says, his voice one of realization.
“Oh. That’s bold.”
“Everyone’s built differently. I guess. It doesn’t matter. There was nothing wrong with her. We just weren’t compatible,” Draco says.
“When I watched porn I spent a lot of time looking at the guys. If I didn’t find the guys and the girls attractive I couldn’t get into it. You know I’d look at them. Check out their dicks. How cute were they? Did they seem like the type of guy I’d want to… Well, you know.”
“What are you gonna do? It’s dark and if we make too much noise
Draco scoffs.
“When are you leaving?” Pansy asked.
She then went around and found a hole in the barn she could crawl through while her friends continued their fight. The sounds seemed to be coming from a stall where Pansy thought you would normally keep a cow, though she wasn’t sure exactly.
-dead. More like alive-dead. Ex-dead-dead, currently alive-dead,” Pansy said, sounding amused.
“Something like that. She said it was too big. And she was right. We had… a lot of trouble. And it was really frustrating. For both of us. I was always gentle and we tried lube and foreplay and it just was never comfortable for her,” Draco says.
“Oh. OK. Sure,” Harry said and followed Draco into the living room.
Ron: “Never have I ever asked someone to call me daddy.”
“So, how’d I do tonight?” Draco asks.
“Feels good, doesn’t it? I use it on myself all the time just to see how long I can last.”
Oh, nothing he told Harry was a lie but it was very much only half of the truth. Pansy was the one who had suspicions going back for years. Draco, as he had confessed on their date to Harry, had thought Harry was attractive for a long time, though he had not been consciously aware of it. Not even after his first wet dream. But Pansy picked up on it. She’d picked up on his obsession and the way he asked her if she thought Harry was hot, despite her having made no indication of such a thing.
He’s not wrong. Harry feels it twitch in his mouth, a warm, salty stream splashing onto his tongue and down his throat. Harry swallows in time for another blast and then another all while Draco lets out a long, groaning moan of ecstasy. Harry doesn’t stop sucking, using his hands to squeeze it all into his mouth.
“Don’t ask me to explain why I like it. I don’t know. But I do.”
“I’m going to live?” Draco asked pathetically.
“What the hell are you two conspiring over there about?” Ron asks, pointing at them.
“Why would I have money if I was homeless?” Harry asked.
“Hello?” Darlene called out.
“Have you?” Draco asked.
“Boyfriend?”
“I live in Capitol Hill. I just like this spot. I didn’t really know where I was going, I just knew I would know when I was there.”
“Fuck. Fuck!” Harry shouted then came into the bedroom and fell on his knees, shaking.
Draco sighed and walked downstairs with trepidation. The more things seemed quiet the more Draco feared another sudden surprise, just like in the movies. The front door was still open from when the troopers had bashed it in the night before.
She hopped off the bed, undressing before him. Draco removed his belt, then quickly undid his pants, pulling them down and kicking them off at her feet. He removed his underwear while she went over to grab the lube. She climbed onto the bed, covering his cock with the lube then getting on top of him. Draco felt stupid still being in his button-up shirt but quickly got lost in Astoria riding him, his hands drifting up to cup her small breasts.
“Rome.”
“Maybe. It was a pretty small town. If you lived there I probably knew you,” Alicia said.
“Your sister doesn’t exist anymore, friend,” Pansy said.
“Well… I’m glad.”
Harry thinks. He knows what he wants to say. He tries to think if there’s any good reason not to say it. Nope. None at all.
Around a year ago his relationship with Pansy had deteriorated. They were barely seeing each other. The bad sex had finally ceased and Draco found himself thinking of his feelings for Harry. He needed to know if this was just some weird fixation or if he really was attracted to men. So, he did what any horny and desperate newly twenty-one year old would do and went to a gay bar. One night was all he needed. He didn’t take anyone home but drowning in a sea of gorgeous men illuminated the lost secrets of his soul. He was bisexual.
“Yeah. I just needed a minute. Ok. Here it comes… are you ready?” Harry says, leaning in.
The vampire gulped and said, “Just one.”
and more
“OK. The ayes have it,” Angelina said, walking over to Pansy to shake her hand.
Together they walked down the sidewalk, heading to nowhere in particular as they talked.
I told her I was bi and we broke up a few days later. She didn’t say it was about that and I know that things hadn’t be good for a while. I’m not sure what happened. We haven’t spoke in nearly a year.
The girls made quick work of three of the vampires, the fourth running off so Pansy chased her. She ran around a barn and Pansy threw her sword, impaling her into the sword of the barn.
“I’m headed to Seattle,” the man said.
Harry looked grim and sighed.
“I want you so bad it’s starting to kill me,” Harry says, hands all over Draco’s back as Draco kisses Harry’s neck.
Pansy struggled to get to sleep. She already missed Daphne. She thought of inviting Alicia into bed. Not for fun things like all that. Just to lay and talk. She’d enjoyed the fun things with Daphne but mostly she enjoyed what came before and after. Just talking. Bearing their souls. Trying to fill the emptiness within. It was all… so much. She missed the sun. Which was strange as she’d never known it.
When it seems like it’s getting out of hand again, Draco pulls back and says, “Ok, ok. I’ll let you go.”
“For you? Always.”
“Your cuts have healed. We both might want a shower. No telling when we’ll get another chance,” Harry said and stepped out of bed.
Draco replies with an address and nothing else. Harry exhales and heads to the shower. It’s the hottest most thorough shower of his life. This feels insane but it’s everything Harry wants. Emotions. Hormones. The lines have become blurry. All he can think about is being with Draco in every way possible.
“I know,” Draco says, very amused.
They arrive at the trail and get out of the car. Harry inhales and listens to the faint sounds of the woods. Stillness. The sound of the river not far away. Cyclists up the path from them. He straps his pack on, surprised to see that Draco has somehow already done that and is waiting in front of the trail.
“You remember what I said about Pansy being dead?” Draco said.
“Are you all right?” Draco asks.
“I’ve been up for nearly two days and I can handle myself,” Harry admitted.
“So, that’s how it’s going to be?”
She looked down, realizing she was wearing some sort of bulletproof vest.
“Oh, oh, oh. Oh god. Draco, I…” Harry said, his breathing heavy and ragged.
Bellatrix slung his hand back.
Draco smiles and says, “I’m not saying anything.”
“I gave back as much as I got.”
“Right. Yeah.”
Harry laughs a big belly deep laugh that warms Draco’s soul. It’s the most wonderful thing Draco has ever heard.
At Longview, Draco heads west towards the Oregon coast. It’s just past noon, having hit the road three hours before. At some point, he needs to stop for gas. He can’t remember when he last filled the tank.
“Draco Malfoy is into guys?”
Ginny laughs and says, “Don’t freak out, grandpa.”
“Be serious, Draco.”
Pansy Parkinson was reborn screaming, a flurry blood and ashes restoring her. She opened her eyes. Every part of her hurt. She was naked and in a dark, candlelit room, several other people standing and watching.
your hobbies? What does Draco Malfoy do for fun?”
“Dammit. What is it?” Astoria plead.
But Astoria wasn’t here to numb that pain. She was back east, hopefully safe. Instead, Draco was alone with the object of his desire and he was filled with confusion. He was angry at himself for wondering if Harry could ever return those feelings. He darkly wondered what sort of a God would fill his creation with unwanted love but he supposed that given the state of things that God was no longer on the premises. God was gone and they only had themselves now.
“But that’s the thing. Pizza is always good but it’s always pizza. You don’t go into pizza expecting something amazing. Pizza is… reliable.”
“Yeah, I feel tired now too,” Harry said and Draco felt himself slip away, Harry sliding in next to him, Draco’s arms wrapping around him.
Ron says this looking at the TV screen, not Harry.
“Fuck,” Harry says softly, adjusting himself in his pants.
“Harry, what do you want to do tomorrow?” Draco asks.
“No. But you like to pretend you are. The truth is you might be the kindest man I’ve ever known. But you talk shit real good and I don’t know what it is about that but it gets me worked up. Makes me feel like letting go,” Harry says, Draco putting his other hand on Harry’s hand that’s resting on Harry’s thigh.
“Huh? No, of course not,” she replied.
“Harry, no! You know what happened then,” Draco said, grabbing Harry’s arm.
Hours later Draco replies with a day and time and the address for the West Seattle restaurant. The dick doesn’t even ask if 7 on Friday is all right. He just assumes. Luckily the time is just fine. Harry gets off early on Fridays.
He was breathing hard and sounded urgent. Draco felt no compulsion to prolong Harry’s suffering and fumbled with the button and the zipper of his jeans for just a moment before he slid Harry’s shaft out of his boxers. Harry moaned softly as Draco wrapped his hand around Harry’s thickness, barely able to get his fingers around it. It felt so hot and hard and Draco could feel Harry’s pulse.
Just got out of the shower. I’ll be ready.
“I’ve been six foot three since high school,” Draco says.
“Maybe next time.”
“Oh?” Draco says.
“Not really. But we’ll play some games and stuff later. Maybe smoke some weed.”
“You don’t recognize me, Draco?” Pansy Parkinson said then stepped closer to the bed.
“Harry, can I ask you something?” Draco asked.
“It sounds good. I guess it feels sudden.”
Pansy sighed, rushing over to scoop it off the floor. Three months had passed since Pansy woke up in the forest without any memories. She still didn’t really get along with her new friends but at least they kept her around. And they helped her get food. Blood was obtained in generosity or in exchange for favors. Pansy hadn’t had to give anyone any favors yet but she was kinda looking forward to it. It was like having a job. A job where sometimes you had to kill monsters.
Getting the vest off, revealing she was just wearing a black tank-top underneath.
Three big slices later Draco thinks he must’ve been very hungry indeed.
Draco cringes and Harry laughs, patting him on the back. Draco isn’t sure what happens now. Harry closes the door and Draco glances around. Ginny is over chatting with Cho. Hermione is talking to Ron. Neville is still engrossed in his game. This isn’t exactly what Draco imagines parties look like. Growing up his version of a party was getting to have one friend over and it had to be a friend that both of his parents approved of, which weren’t many.
“No,” Draco replies, so softly it's doubtful Harry can hear it.
“Nothing,” Harry says, shaking his head dismissively.
“What about you? Did you go to college? What are you doing now?” Harry inevitably asks.
Draco is stunned. He sighs and takes a drink, along with Hermione. It tastes terrible and he grimaces. Ron bursts into laughter.
“Put our notes together. See what we can piece. Draco… I want to show you something…” Harry said and ran upstairs.
“Don’t be. I just wanted to make sure,” Harry said then rolled over to face Draco with a smile on his face.
“They might return. Maybe we should try to rest just in case of an attack. We can be more ready than we were last night,” Harry said.
“There’s nothing for me on there.”
“I won’t,” Harry says softly.
“I don’t think so. I mean we can’t take Bellatrix. But we can’t just leave here without at least finding out if she’s been freed,” Harry said.
“You think so? Not too big?”
“Look, I know it’s stupid…”
