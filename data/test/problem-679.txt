‘Erm I was wondering what you guys were talking about’ and then as if suddenly remembering, ‘and what the bloody hell happened with Malfoy?’
They’d left the invisibility cloak at the top of the tower.
Neville stared open mouthed at the beds, ‘I don’t know Harry, I asked for a place to stay with my friends tonight.’
Ron’s eyes grew wide and his face turned red. Harry watched this exchange in shock, what an overreaction, okay so Draco had a tough guy persona to uphold but there was no need at all for that. That was bullying, plain and simple, Harry had enough bullying in his life he didn’t need or want anymore.
Harry felt Ron slide silently down onto the wardrobe floor beside him.
Harry had eventually worked up the courage to ask Ron about his song, hoping that if his, often oblivious, friend shared how he had worked it out then it might be easier for him. At first Ron had been unsure of how to tell his story, he hadn’t wanted to take away from the importance of it, the feeling of pure ‘rightness’ he had felt but he did want Harry to know.
Before Harry could reply Neville spoke up, ‘Of course it’s not your fault Malfoy, Ron is an idiot plain and simple, Harry did the right thing defending you.’
‘What was that about?’ Harry asked with amusement
‘Mione, what if he hates me?’
‘What fire? Is he ok? Is he alive?
Hermione noticed the change in her friend’s demeanour almost immediately. The haunted look he seemed to favour was gone; in its place were bright, wide eyes and an inviting smile. She looked up at him, ‘You seem chirpier,’ a hint of inquisitiveness in her voice.  Harry smiled as he sat down to her left, Ron leaned forward around his girlfriend, toast in mouth, to see what she was talking about, eyes widening at the blinding smile Harry offered him.  He nodded in acknowledgement, leant back and continued his mastication, seemingly nonplussed by the changes. Hermione rolled her eyes and turned to face Harry once more as he replied, ‘ I’ve decided to have a positive outlook on it, it will happen,’ he looked searchingly around the room, ‘somewhere in here could be the person that makes me as happy as you make Ron.’  Hermione couldn’t help but beam at that as tears filled her hazel eyes.
‘Half past eleven,’ Harry thought. ‘I’d better go.’
Harry stared open mouthed as Draco rambled on trying to process what he had seen. Draco stopped, realising that he had no audience, ‘Harry, Harry what is it?’
I have to help him.”

Once upon a time, an old beggar woman came to the castle of a young prince and offered him a single rose in return for shelter. The prince was spoiled and unkind, and he sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away. At his rejection, the old woman's ugliness disappeared in a burst of magic, revealing a beautiful enchantress. The prince tried to apologize, but it was too late, for she had seen that there was no love in his heart. As punishment, she transformed him into a hideous beast, and placed a powerful spell on his castle which would erase it from the memory of all his people.
But Madam Umbridge had overheard the incident from a table in the back, and she thought of a cunning plan.
silence, longing to join him.  But having never had any real companions, did not know where to begin.
Seeing that the beast made no move to attack, Harry said,
And the people were delighted to have two young rulers who were unselfish and kind, and who led them into a time of peace and great prosperity.  The kingdom’s magic became known for its great power throughout the world.
Madam Umbridge immediately cast a spell to immobilize the beast, her followers swarming into the room like ants casting hexes and curses in rapid succession.  The beast simply groaned and closed his eyes, and made no attempt to break free.  He felt himself drifting out of awareness, when he heard someone yell above the din, “Expelliarmus!” Madam Umbridge’s wand shot across the room into the hand of Harry Potter, who was rushing to his side, as Sirius Black cast a powerful protego around them.
he received a nod of acceptance
Harry pushed away his plate and stood up from the table.  “He was hurt.  He would have died if he stayed imprisoned like that.  Sirius is my godfather, and I love him.  I’d do anything for him.”
high window, and when he saw that their leader was carrying the mirror, he was sure Harry had betrayed him.  No one had ever cared about him before- why had he thought Harry was different?  What was the point of escaping from these angry villagers Harry had sent to destroy him?  He did not want to remain a monster, alone forever.  He listened to them breaking down the door and simply waited.  He hoped they’d kill him quickly, as he wasn’t much for pain.  And as he stroked a claw down the glass cover, the rose dropped its next to last petal.
[Image description- a clawed reptilian hand rests on a clear class dome covering the enchanted rose, which shines dimly with only one single petal left on its stem.]
Suddenly, Harry heard a rumbling growl, and as he and Sirius turned toward the noise they saw a great beast, looming over them, large and threatening. Harry knew he could not easily defeat such a monster in combat, especially with his wounded godfather to protect.
Then a blinding light sparked briefly and painfully, as though lightning had struck the castle, causing all present to shield their eyes and drop their wands.
[image description- Harry has rolled onto his stomach and is bracing himself on his hands.  He looks forward in shock and alarm.  He is covered by the beast, who crouches low over his body, with his wings outstretched and poised to attack.  The dinosaur-like bony spikes and ridges around his neck and down his spine are aggressively on display.]
“Harry Potter, held prisoner by a beast in a castle?
“Why should I want to kill you?” he asked sincerely.  The beast eyed him closely.  “What is your name?” he asked, finally.  “It’s Harry.  What’s yours?”  The beast hesitated, as if trying to remember a word that had been long unused.  “Draco,” he said, finally.  Then he withdrew from the room, into the shadowy hall beyond.
Harry stared at the floor but he knew Ron was right, he knew Draco would follow him if he went, and he wasn’t sure if he wanted to drag Draco in to more trouble than he already had, ‘But it’s for Hermione,’he tried one more time.
‘Did you speak clearly when you stepped in to the floo?’
Harry stared at the words on the page trying to take in what he was being told. He re-read the passage and looked up at his friends, ‘Mione this isn’t right, it can’t be what is happening to me,’ Harry shook his head sadly, ‘I’m almost 18 and this is definitely the first time I have heard this song.’ Hermione smiled and leaned forward, she drew his attention back to the book turning the page as she did,’ keep reading.’
......
Hedwig dropped the letter on Harry’s plate. Harry tore it open at once, ‘Brilliant!’ he said and scribbled a reply before grabbing his bag and heading off to Potions with Ron chattering by his side.
‘Mr Malfoy you can leave for dinner if you like.’
The castle felt unusually still as the two boys walked hand in hand through the long stone corridors,it was although it didn’t want to disturb them on their travels, almost like it was ensuring their privacy. Occasionally Draco would glance back at Harry to find the other boy resolutely staring at the floor, although his grip on Draco’s hand was still as firm. Words still failed him; Harry deserved more than ridiculous platitudes. Draco had an idea that would both afford Harry the absolute privacy he desired and also show the Gryffindor that he was there for him, no matter what it took.  He swallowed and squeezed Harry’s hand tighter.
Draco closed his eyes as the day's memories washed over him. He had never felt fear like it,
Scowling, Draco quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table. ‘Just looking,’ he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.
‘Harry, I don’t think that boy could hate you even if he really wanted to.’
‘Yes,’ Harry said patiently in a way that suggested he was about to explain something very complicated to somebody very stupid. ‘but that is ordinary Treacle Tart, this is the best Treacle Tart ever, in the whole world ever, it’s exquisite, homemade, mouth watering, to die for...’
Draco mumbled something that sounded suspiciously like ‘sugared hippos,’ and snuggled closer to Harry. Harry chuckled softly.
Progression.
Draco was in the middle of a deep conversation with Moaning Myrtle, buttering her up enough to convince her to share the details of her death, she was just pointing out the exact sink where it happened when Harry burst in to the bathroom followed by Ron and Neville, who, inexplicably, were dragging Professor Lockheart between them.
Hermione gave a small chuckle, she was finally getting to see the other side of this friendship and by the pink tinge slowly creeping up Draco’s neck she felt she was justified in her thoughts on it.
‘I spotted it and it just reminded me on you so much.’
‘Draco!’ a familiar voice shouted. Suddenly Draco found himself with arms full of bushy haired Gryffindor. ‘Draco,’ she sobbed as she wrapped her arms around his neck, ‘What,? How? Why?’ she said in shock. Draco place his hands softly on her shoulders and gently pushed her back, this gave him the opportunity to take in her appearance. There were cuts, bruises and dried blood all over her skin, her robes were torn and hanging off her slight frame, her eyes were blood shot and she was trembling, ‘ Mione,’ he whispered, using the name he had heard Harry use for his friend, ‘what happened?’
Harry looked, wide-eyed at the serious faces of his friends, ‘Some people never get one?’ Hermione’s face took on a sombre tone, she shook her head sadly, ‘No, not everyone is destined to find the one that complete them.’ Harry hung his head , ‘and you thought I was one of those people?’ he asked, so softly that Ron and Hermione had to strain to hear him. Hermione decided to be honest, ‘We did worry Harry. Honestly, we talked about it a lot and I’m sorry that we did that but, well we just couldn’t bring ourselves to talk to you about it with you, just in case…’ ‘Yeah mate,’ Ron interrupted , ‘and what with old moldy pants…’ before Ron could continue he was stopped with a sharp dig in the ribs from Hermione’s elbow, but it was too late. ‘Voldemort, what about him?’ Hermione sighed and shot Ron a dangerous glare at Ron who merely shrugged in response. ‘You see,’ Hermione began, ‘It was widely believed that Voldemort never had a song, causing what sould he did have, to be destroyed and well, you know the rest’. Harry’s eyes  widened as he realised the implications of what they were saying, ‘You thought I was the same?’ Ron decided to answer this time, ‘It was the connection mate, we were worried, there was no way to tell what it had done to you.’ Harry nodded slowly understanding what they were saying although it did hurt. Hermione reached out to touch his arm gently, ‘The pint is, that no matter what we thought it’s not true is it.’ Harry looked in to the earnest brown eyes in front of him, ‘Do we though. I mean how do we know I really havn’t just got a song stuck in my head and this time tomorrow it will be gone and forgotten . Once  again it was Ron who spoke up, ‘Tell me a bit of the song mate.’ Harry looked at his friend, ‘What?’ ‘Go on’ Ron urged, ‘see if I know it, maybe I can help.’
......
Now Ron was many things but stupid was not one of them, in fact he was quite intelligent and very observant, he noticed the things that were going on around him, he just often chose not to comment and watch from the sidelines instead, and this was how he knew that Neville had a way of contacting Malfoy even if he wasn’t meant to.
Harry could tell that Draco was holding himself back for some reason, he really didn’t want him to, he wanted his boyfriend to enjoy this as much as he was. Without stopping to think of the consequences he placed his hands over Draco's and removed them from his waist. Draco broke the kiss in confusion. Without breaking eye contact and face flushing scarlet, Harry lowered Draco's hands and placed them well below his waistline pushing hard as he did hoping that Draco understood what he meant. There was a brief moment of nothing causing Harry to panic that he had pushed Draco too far too soon but then Draco gave an experimental squeeze causing, what felt like a bolt of lightning, to shoot through Harry. The smaller of the two smiled at the sensation and lifted his hand to cup his boyfriend’s cheek, and then he leaned down to kiss Draco once more.
‘So?’ shrugged Ron, although he did look a bit uncomfortable. Harry ran after Hermione but she had already gone. Harry spent the rest of the afternoon looking for Hermione, she had not been in her lessons, so Harry was not surprised to find Hermione was not there at dinner. But she was momentarily forgotten as he entered the Great Hall, he was amazed by the Halloween decorations, he had never seen the hall look this way it was amazing. The candles floating above their heads were black and glowed with green flames whilst bats flew through the hall high above their heads. Each table had its own family of giant carved pumpkins, Harry was amazed and stood for a second taking the grand sight in.
Draco opened his eyes once more, ‘You must have an idea though, something made you say that.’
Just as Draco was trying to think of a scathing reply to the little weasel  he noticed Harry trying to catch his eye. Why was it that this boy could alter his mood some completely. He could quite happily thump the weasels big red face but he didn’t want to disappoint Harry, although Harry knew the real him he knew he could only push him so far.
As they approached the entrance hall they noticed that Filch was already down there – and so was Draco.  Harry gave him a small smile and was visibly relieved when it was returned.  Harry smile grew as he saw his friend smiling back at him. Perhaps he didn’t hate him after all. Just then Filch spoke;
Harry Potter was the cause of all his problems, he was sure about that, those stupid green eyes that twinkled when he laughed and that adorably messy hair that Draco longed to comb his long fingers through, and the day had started do well.
‘Potter, Harry’
‘Mmmm.’ Came a muffled sound from the other bed.
It was Hermione’s turn to blush, ‘Not yet, he understands there’s no rush.’
......
Draco leant closer to Ron in a menacing way, foreheads almost touching, he felt the anger bubbling up inside him, ‘I care,’ he hissed at the Gryffindor, ‘Harry is my friend and when you hurt him you hurt me, you should bare that in mind in future Weasel, today was just the start of what I am willing to do for that boy so take that as a warning.’
‘A muggle game?’ Draco asked sounding only slightly affronted that he had been asked to play a muggle game.
Hermione was still up waiting for him,
......
As Draco woke he noticed Harry’s arm wrapped tightly around him. Harry was in his bed, when did that happen? His curtains were open, had he not closed them? He looked at the room around him from his vantage point in the corner. The others were beginning to stir and Draco began to panic, he felt his heart racing and his hands grew clammy as he struggled to catch his breath. What would they say if they saw Harry? He dreaded to think what Harry’s friends would say, what the hell would Blaise think? He looked over and saw Weasley looking at him from his bed, he looked concerned, he was for it now. Draco’s panic attack began to worsen, ‘Harry!’ Weasley shouted, Draco flinched, this would not be good, he heard Harry grumble behind him, ‘Harry!’ Ron shouted again more urgently as he jumped from his bed. Draco was slowly losing the ability to breathe and he panicked more and more, the lions around him were rising, he was dead, what had Harry been thinking?, ‘Harry!’ Ron almost screamed again, Harry shot up, ‘Now he’ll see ,’ thought Draco, ’he’ll be mortified,’ was the blondes last thought as he began to hyperventilate. ‘What Ron?’ Harry asked grumpily.
Ron awoke to hushed voices whispering around him. He was lay on his stomach, face buried in a pillow that was just a little bit too hard for his liking. He prised his eyes open and stifled a groan at a twinge in his back, quickly reminding him of where he was and, more importantly why he was there. One glance determined it was either the middle of the night or he had gone completely blind, Ron decided he would cheerfully hex whoever it was that stood over him, Madame Pomfrey or not, after all, who in their right mind would wake an injured boy form a lovely dream about a house made of Chocolate Frogs. He was about to turn his head and ask just that question when the sound of Draco Malfoy’s voice froze him in place.
Harry smiled up at Draco to let him know he was grateful for the information, then moved to share the information he had ‘overheard’ to Ron.  Harry was surprised when Ron appeared concerned about Hermione.
The other students in the room watched this with rising interest and more than one pair of eyes widened when Harry had climbed in beside Draco. But the blonde had stilled when he felt Harry’s touch, the other’s, especially Blaise, were shocked but after a while Luna and the Gryffindor’s settled back to sleep. They knew Harry, they loved Harry, Draco was obviously important to Harry so now, without question, he was one of them. Blaise stayed awake a while longer, staring at the sight in the bed next to him, it was beautiful, blonde and brunette lying together in the moonlight, breathing deeply as they slept. Draco looked content in stark contrast to the screaming that had only been minutes ago but now seemed like hours ago. If Potter could make Draco look like that who was he to complain? He had always secretly had a bit of a soft spot for Harry but would never admit it. Oh well, Draco had him now, Blaise sighed and lay back down, wondering naughtily if the Irish lad would be up for a bit of fun with him.
Harry stopped short at the word ‘space’ HIs mind began to run a mile a minute, ‘Space? Draco needed space. ’What did he mean space? Space from him? Instinctively Harry took a step back, his sudden movement did not go unnoticed by Draco  who quickly reached out the grab his hands, ‘not from you,’ he said with a sigh pulling Harry so that he came to a stop between Draco’s knees. ‘I meant just space from my house mates. You and your escapades are driving me crazy and I'm not sure how confident I feel about holding myself back in front of them when I learn what exactly it is that you have been up to today.’
Harry pushed open the door and took a look around the room that he now found himself in. The trophy’s lined every wall and glittered silver in the moon light. Harry was mesmerised as he stood staring at the magnificent sight and he did not notice Draco in the corner of the room.
‘I am now Drake, thanks for coming.’
‘It’s ok Parkinson,’ Neville said with a small smile,’  I was the same when I first discovered it, come and sit down, let’s talk and figure out what we are going to do.’
With a sigh, Harry picked up his quill and scratched out his response.
After the return of Sirius and the unearthing of many truths, he had rekindled his relationship with Remus, one that had ended far too quickly during its early months at Hogwarts because of secrets, lies and deceptions and Harry had been part of the package. First, an uneasy truce had formed between the two, mainly for the benefit of the fragile werewolf, followed by a grudging mutual respect. The relationship had steadily grown in to a deep affection which, safe to say, had taken them all by surprise, none more so than Remus who had gone to great pains to ensure the happiness of both his partner and the boy he now called son.
‘For not wanting to be seen, it’s just...’
‘What would your girlfriend say to you about you getting a gay man to take his shirt off for you?’ Draco asked, trying not to show how affected he was by that statement.
‘Hang on.’ Said Harry from his position on the common room floor. He was sat cross legged leaning against one of the over-stuffed couches, ‘I don’t understand the problem here. You should be happy we made up, happy I’m happy, you have just said that you are my best friend after all, surely you should be happy it’s sorted.’
Harry spun around as the door creaked open, the three Gryffindor’s had only just arrived and had barely shrugged off the cloak when the Slytherin’s entered the room.
‘Mr Weasley, never in all my years, what is the meaning of this ?’
‘Ah Mr Malfoy!’ The hat said as it was placed on his head. ‘Now this should be easy , but wait, what’s this? A conflict? You are destined for great things my boy, great, great things. Your head, well your head knows Slytherin, it is all it knows, but what of your heart boy mmm? What does your heart want?
‘What proof do you have he’s not?’ shouted Ron, fists now clenched down by his sides.
‘Mr Potter, calm down Mr Malfoy is fine he just needs to rest and take care of himself.’ Just as she was about to continue a first year was carried in by Madam Hooch, ‘I will be right back,’ she said and rushed over to the injured child.
‘Draco?’
‘Fine.’ She said as she brought her hand to her face in the pretence of admiring her new manicure, ‘Hmmm I wonder how Potter will feel if someone lets him know that you two disappeared and spent to the night off together somewhere. All alone.’
Draco’s eyes snapped open and met startled green ones, Harry had obviously thought him asleep when he had confessed his love for someone. Draco’s stomach was churning, he felt sick, he had to swallow to stop the bile from rising, the last thing he had wanted to hear, on Christmas Eve, cuddled up in bed with Harry was that he loved someone else. He was young, he knew that, but he understood what love was, he had heard Pansy whimper on about it enough, she had explained how it felt from Veela romance novels she had read and all the girly magazines that he had stolen and read in secret, he wanted Harry to feel that for him and not for some other boy. He swallowed hard and decided that he needed to know, hoping that Harry wasn’t talking about Weasley or even that Creevey kid, ‘Who?’ he asked, wincing as his voice cracked slightly.
‘Nev,’ Harry yelled, causing the other boy to jump, once again, ‘You’re a genius. I've got to go.’ with that Harry grabbed the map and his cloak and ran from the room leaving a very perplexed Neville sitting on his bed.
Soon enough it was there turn to bow to the Hippogriffs. It was going so well, well until Pansy turned to him, completely innocently and said ‘oh Draco aren’t they ugly.’ Before he could formulate a response, the beast before them reared up on to it’s  hind legs.  Before Draco had time to react a streak of red flashed across his vision. It all seemed to happen so quickly, the Hippogriff took a swipe at Pansy with its huge talons, but somehow Ron had got there first. He pushed the girl to the floor, covering her slight body with his. Ron roared with pain as the talons landed on his back carving out a huge gouge in the flesh. Blood spurted   from the wound, someone screamed and Harry raced to his friends side. Hermione was stood still, face ashen in shock, taking in the scene before her. Draco could clearly see Pansy, still lying beneath her saviour, tears were string down her face as she reached forward to wipe a tear from Ron’s face. The class were whispering around them , completely confused by what they had just witnessed.
Harry smiled at this as he remembered what had happened but then he filled Ron in on the stry that Draco had come up with.
‘Really? I know how you felt about being left alone.’
Draco was startled, ‘What?’
;Do you think it as guarding something?’
Her response came instantly:
Slowly Harry came back in to focus and realised he was still staring in to the eyes of one of his closest friends, all other emotions in those liquid silver eyes had been replaced with concern, he could still feel Darco’s hand resting gently on his cheek and couldn’t stop himself from leaning slightly in to the touch. He let himself have a moment there, enjoying the comfort Draco's touch brought to him, after a minute he swallowed hard before pulling away.
‘No sir?’
......
‘Oy, you! ‘Arry Potter!’
‘No way, when?’ Neville swallowed, ‘The first time was on the first night back after the summer holidays when we met up in the Room of Requirement.’ Harry’s eyes grew comically wide as he mouthed ‘The first time’ back at Neville. Neville nodded as Harry leaned forward excitedly, ‘How many more times?’ Neville leaned forward to meet Harry and whispered conspiratorially, ‘six.’ Harry leaned back and let out a low whistle, ‘so good then?’ Neville groaned and threw himself back on to Harry’s pillows, ‘sooooooo good,’ he almost moaned out. He barked out a laugh of surprise at his friend and moved around so that he was lying side by side with Neville, their brown hair mixed together on the pillow.
......
......
The three others stared, open-mouthed at Draco’s outburst.
‘They are plenty big enough for two I don’t mind sharing.’
......
Draco started, completely taken aback by the statement ‘What? No, of course not. Harry what on earth is going on?’
Draco lifted his hand to run through Harry’s sending shockwaves right through the smaller boy’s body, ‘Well he sounds delightful.’ he said causing a snort to sound from the smaller boy. ‘That’s one way of putting it.’ Harry had to close his eyes at the feelings Draco was causing just be simply massaging his head, the boy was going to be the death of him. They were still taking things slowly but Harry was being to question what exactly he was waiting for. He looked across at Neville, he really needed to have that conversation with him.
Remus was the first to recover, he reached down and pulled Harry up in to a bone-crunching hug, wrapping two strong arms round his shoulders he buried his head in to the messy raven locks. Harry brought his hands up to rest on the Defence Professor’s shoulder blades. He stood like that before he realised Remus was trembling in his arms, ‘Pops,’ he said gently, ‘Are you ok? Did I do something wrong? Was it too much?’ He turned worried eyes to Severus and was surprised to find tear-filled dark eyes meet his own. Remus lifted his head and placed a hand on each of Harry’s shoulders, stepping back so that he could take a good look at Harry. After a moment he glanced at Severus, Harry missed whatever passed between the two but suddenly he found himself enveloped in another pair of strong arms. ‘Harry,’ whispered Severus,’ Thank you for accepting me, it will be an honour to be called father by you.’
Harry smiled at the blond, ‘I know and I’m grateful nut I’ve definitely done enough killing for a lifetime,’ Harry continued before  Draco could react to that,’ I wouldn’t be averse to some good old Slytherin plotting and  revenge though if you’re up for it? I was almost sorted in to Slytherin you know.’
‘Did you see his face?’
Pansy sauntered in to the Great Hall and over to the Gryffindor table with an air of confidence about her making a beeline for Harry.
......
‘So shut up then.’ Draco said with a smile giving Harry a playful nudge with his elbow. Harry grinned and stuck his tounge out at Draco again.
Sitting against his headboard, knees pulled up, reading his Charms textbook was the student who was fast becoming the bane of his life, Theodore Nott. Theo chose that moment to look up and the two boys locked eyes. Draco offered a curt nod, which was returned with a smirk, before he walked over to his bed. Pulling his curtains round him Draco opened the parchment and attempted to dampen the panic that began to rise within him as he read the untidy scrawl before him. Not even his boyfriend could get in to that much trouble alone in the castle for a few hours surely.
There was a murmur form the Slytherin table and whispers. The Malfoy name was well known and revered in their circles, Slytherin was a done deal, what was taking so long?
Draco faltered when he realised he still had Harry in his arms, bloody hell, he thought, the only person he had ever held like this was his mother after another of his father’s drunken outburst. He slowly removed his arms , ‘so... erm... yeah... I’m made up for you I really am and don’t worry friends don’t tell.’
It had been a long night, Draco had not slept and had been snapping and sneering at anyone who dared approach. Blaise and Pansy had long since given up trying to reason with him, being Draco’s childhood friends they had stayed over at the Manor many times and they each had a room that they could call their own in Draco’s own wing of the manor. Tonight they had forgone their usual comfort on favour of staying to support their blonde friend, though each vicious remark made them regret their choice more and more, however they stayed, they knew and understood that he was worried but it did not stop them wanting to hex him in to oblivion each time he opened his mouth.
‘I knew you would want to know, we are not allowed to see him yet but we are going back up to hang around until they let us, I could pass a message on for you,’ she said with a smile.
‘Mmm?’
The scream pierced the still night air waking all but one of the inhabitants of one of the 8
Draco’s head jerked back in surprise, his cool demeanour shattering in an instance ‘Harry’s devastated ? Surely he is just upset that he’s been caught out?’
‘How long as he been there?’
Ron had looked at Harry and then at where he had been looking. Ron shook his head, ‘No’ he said  and pushed the thought out of his mind as he had followed Harry out of the hall.
‘Sorry,’ whispered Draco, hanging his head. Harry looked at him, ‘why?’ he asked, confusion evident on his face.
This is exactly what Harry had hoped would happen.
Draco really wished that he could see Harry himself but supposed that this would have to do for now. He thought for a second, he knew Ron would be there but needed Harry to know that he was thinking of him, ‘I have no message,’ he said finally ‘but there is something that you can say to him for me.’
‘What?’ asked Draco confused.
Harry shrugged, ‘I like it, think it suits you, you ok?’
years clung to each other as nobody else quite understood what they had had to endure to get to where they were today, they silently understood each other and that was all that they needed, like the shared dorms, the table was a silent barrier from the rest of the world.
When Draco had gone Ron looked at Harry,
(See the end of the chapter for
The booth was small but not too small for them to both sit comfortably side by side on the small white bench that ran along one end of the booth, Draco sat and stretched out his long legs in front of him, Harry watched in awe as Draco’s feet brushed against the opposite wall, he didn’t even attempt the same knowing his own legs will fall far shorter. Draco shifted slightly appearing to be seeking comfort and Harry swallowed as he felt the blonde’s firm thigh pressed up against his own, he could feel the heat through his jeans and imagined what it would be like to be at the mercy of those strong thighs. . ‘So’ Draco started, pulling Harry from his fantasies, ‘You want to talk?’ Harry swallowed, his earlier bravado leaving him in one breath, ‘tattoo,’ he mumbled inwardly berating himself at the randomness, ‘Pardon?’ Draco asked, turning his head slightly so he could get a better look at the man at his side, Harry swallowed and looked back, ‘ I noticed it when you were dancing, I mean not that I was looking, I mean obviously I was, I couldn’t help notice, I mean…’ Draco took pity on Harry and put an end to his rambling, ‘Ok, so I have a tattoo, what of it?’ Harry rubbed his damp palms down his thighs, ‘Can I see it?’
Harry slowly began rubbing small circles on the Slytherin’s back,
‘No listen. As I said, I know why you didn’t and I know that it was more about you than me, but don’t you understand you accused me of cheating, of lying, are you going to think that again? Next time I talk to someone, what if someone spreads a rumour? Can you trust me? Can I trust you not to accuse me again?’
Hermione was visibly shaking, she mumbled incoherently, Draco could just make out the words potions and fire. Draco felt the bile rising in his throat, he grabbed the girls shoulders and shook her, she looked up at him, eyes wide and full of tears,
‘Hi, yourself,’ Harry replied and was rewarded with a smile from the Slytherin.
‘Harry,’ Draco said as he wrapped his arm around the small boy, ‘I believe you.’
‘Why should I believe you?’
‘About what Severus?’
‘He’s a Gryffindor love, he would do that for anyone.’ Draco comforted.
‘Here you go Harry.’
‘So what?’
Draco looked up at the Gryffindor in front of him with a small glint of respect and surprise in his eyes, Harry had badgered him to get something for Neville and now he was exceedingly glad that he had done.
Harry nodded, releasing his grip on Severus’s arms. A slow smile spread across his face as he looked up in to the dark eyes, filled with ill-concealed shock above him. He nodded once more to emphasise his point. ‘Does it bother you?’ Before the elder of the two could reply, a large oak door to Harry’s right was pulled open and Remus entered the room followed by a billowing cloud of steam. He was rubbing vigorously at his head with a towel and missed the presence of his’ pup’ (his little wolf joke). ‘Hey babe I thought you were going to join me?’  Harry smirked as the snarly Slytherin before him coloured a very interesting shade of pink, he snorted at Severus’s steely glare causing Remus to pull the damp towel from his head. ‘Hey pup,’ he smiled, not a trace of embarrassment evident as he stretched over with one arm to ruffle Harry’s already untidy hair, ‘to what do we owe this pleasure?’ Harry looked up at Severus with a small, shy smile, ‘Well Father and I …’ Harry was cut off, mid-sentence, by a soft gasp from Severus and a strangled sob from Remus. Harry’s eyes flicked between the two, he waited anxiously between the two, hoping desperately that he had not overstepped the mark.
Draco’s head snapped round as he watched the boy take the stage. Whispers had broken out all around him like hissing fires;
Draco could not life his head, Potter had seen him at his weakest, there was nothing worse. But hearing him use his given name had made him catch his breath. He felt a stirring of something deep inside, something long forgotten.
Draco removed his hand and watched as Harry scuffed his toes on the floor, ‘So, I take it you have no idea where you are then?’ Draco whispered with a glance over to his father who luckily was still very much occupied, ‘You’re in Knockturn Alley.’ Draco stated and then waited for a look of horror to cross Harry’s face. After a second, when no such look had happened, Draco seemed to remember who he was talking to and sighed, ‘It’s a bit darker around here than what you are used to, and you should not really be seen around here.’
......
Harry walked back to his common room in a daze. He had never been stood up by Draco before and he didn’t know what to do.  He felt a hot tear escape and roll down his cheek as he climbed through the portrait hole, he had obviously done something wrong but he couldn’t for the life of him figure out what. He rubbed furiously at his cheek and ran up the stairs to his room, he threw himself on his bed not caring whether or not he disturbed anybody, and he grabbed the parchment from under his pillow. Nothing, not one word, what the hell had he done?
......
......
Harry watched Draco as a look of realisation crossed his face, he put his hand in to his robe and found a rolled up piece of parchment, looking around him Harry took the parchment from his pocket and carefully unrolled it,
Thanks so much for the love and patience on this one. Here we are at the end finally. Our boys got the happy ending they deserve.
‘You can. We can.’
“Well, for starters we need to be honest, you are clearly the best-looking guy at Hogwarts hands down.
Pansy walked forward and placed a comforting hand on Ron’s elbow, ‘She’ll be ok you know,’ Ron looked down at the small Slytherin and gave a weak smile, ‘I have to believe that,’ he looked back up at Draco, did you speak to Myrtle? How do we find her?’
After a few minutes of stares and whispering the decorations in the Great Hall changed so that they were equal parts Slytherin and Gryffindor, Draco was mostly forgotten as students and staff alike began to turn their attention to the fest that was before them. Draco chanced a look at Harry who was staring open mouth at him whilst Hermione whispered in to his ear. It was obvious to Draco that Harry was only now learning of his involvement.
Draco reached out and clasped Harry’s free hand, noticing how clammy it felt; the group walked on in silence.
‘Ok,’ said Harry, ‘I’m going to spin my wand the person it points to gets to ask first ready?’
Draco felt like he was going to have a heart attack, he couldn’t breathe, it was all he could do to stop himself screaming out to his friend.
‘But this didn’t feel like magic. It felt a lot older than that. It felt like music.’
‘Yep sure does,’ she smiled as Draco just got redder at this,’ I have had to shut him up many times before Ronald hears.’ She smiled at Draco. Draco felt the heat in his face, he smiled back and then quickly changed the subject;
‘Okay, but be careful without your cloak.’
‘I know what you mean,’ she replied quietly, ‘Summer and sharing a common room has turned us in to quite the little family.’
.....
‘Neville, what is this place?’
‘You are joking right? He actually wants us to follow spiders, Not happening, no way.’
‘Of me?’
Harry’s grip on Draco’s hand tightened  as he looked in to Draco’s silver eyes he was trying to say that he understood, he understood so much more then the Slytherin could know. Draco felt Harry’s hand squeeze and was immediately glad he had shared. He squeezed back as he looked in to Harry’s eyes, unknown to the small boy he had seen his bruises and he knew that Harry understood.
Harry threw an arm on to the back of the sofa, joining the pale freckled one that was already there, he lazily ran his thumb across Ginny’s forearm, drawing imaginary lines between each freckle as he had done many times before.
Over in the Slytherin boy’s dorm a significant look was exchanged.
Harry barely restrained himself from actually growling at Neville before following the direction Neville was pointing. It took him a minute but then he saw, or, more importantly didn’t see what Neville was getting at.
Draco was sat waiting for Harry with his back pressed against the cold stone wall of the Trophy room, legs bent at the knees and elbows resting on them as he traced the arc of his pendant as it moved across the floor following Harry’s movements throughout the castle. He had been watching it’s movements for a few minutes when, suddenly the pendant stood on end and Draco jumped to his feet, grabbing the pendant as he did so eyes darting all around but not finding Harry, ‘Harry are you here?’
Harry swallowed hard and looked in to the dazzling silver eyes before him;
Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. Harry’s heart sank, ‘Draco’ he thought, ‘please come on you are better than this. Harry looked up and caught Draco’s eye, he felt a heat rising in his face, ‘damn it’ he thought ‘ what the hell is it about that git and his bloody silver eyes/’
Harry chuckled as Draco continued, ‘I’ll be going up against you, I can’t wait to beat you to the snitch.’
‘That’s sounds good to me.’
........
‘Mmm’ Harry mumbled as though he was half asleep, ‘Yeah, yeah of course.’ Draco smiled down at the small boy, ‘what that’s settled, we should stay in here.’
‘I know why you’re doing this Harry.’ A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink dressing gown and a frown. Harry looked at her, he couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering.
There will be quite a passage of time in this chapter obviously the Polyjuice never happened, but, during this time, Ron and Harry find the diary as happened in canon  (Myrtle’s flooded bathroom) Also this is quite a short chapter but I feel that it needed to end where it did so sorry about that 
………………………………..
‘Forgive me Potter but I was pretty sure that that was what we were doing,’ Draco fought back a small smile as he noticed a blush start to creep up Harry’s neck. The man in question looked down at his feet then, after seeming to steel himself, looked up and locked eyes with Draco, ‘I know, I just, I mean somewhere quiet, you know, just us.’
‘Very well then my boy have it your way follow your head ... for now ...
Harry had found him, Draco Malfoy was his soul mate, his eyes locked on steely grey but before he could speak Malfoy got up from his chair, turned and ran. He didn’t look back once.
Neville dug around in the pocket of his robe and joined his friends on Ron’s bed, he crossed his legs and smoothed the parchment on his knee as Ron turned and watched him with increasing interest.
Draco slumped back in his chair and lifted a hand to run it through his hair, ‘So that’s it really, what in Salazar’s name does the Irish twerp have that I don’t.’
Hermione slowly approached Draco and cautiously lifted a hand to his arm placing it gingerly on his elbow in a show of comfort. Draco raised his head to look at her when a very familiar sound caught his attention, the sounds of a very soft, delicate piece of material falling to the floor. Draco whipped his head round and his eyes met wide emerald green ones that were shining with tears. Draco swallowed and spun on his heel ready to storm from the classroom when he felt Blaises’s strong grip on his forearm; ‘Wait Draco..’ Draco snapped back around, ‘Wait? What for? To hear his lies? I CAN’T BELIEVE THAT YOU SET ME UP, I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS’ Draco’s voice broke as he tried to wrestle his arm form his friends grip.
......
‘I can’t Ginny.’
The potion’s master merely raised an eyebrow and stood to one side to allow the young man access. ‘Is Professor Lupin about?’ Severus, once again walked across the room and sat himself on one of the two armchairs that were before the fire, he straightened his robes across his knee before speaking, ‘Remus is currently in meetings, is it him with whom you wish to speak?’
‘You did what? Draco I can’t believe you, why can’t you let yourself be happy?’ Pansy sat heavily down on the green, high- backed sofa next to Draco.
Seamus licked his lips and tasted the salt of the sweat that lined his top lip. He pushed a hand roughly through his dark hair, damp from exertion, and let out a growl that curled up right from the pit of his stomach.  He slid his hand up the slick back beneath him and wrapped his fist tightly in the nest of dark hair, ‘fuck,’ he whispered and thrust forward in to the pliant body beneath him, ‘you’re fucking perfect.’ The Gryffindor beneath him let out a low whine and pushed back, ‘you’re not so bad yourself Shay.
‘Yes, er, sorry it just sort of came out.’ laughed Harry.
‘i’m not you’re just being ridiculous, he is not the heir of Slytherin.’
Something had made Draco sit up and take notice.
‘Come on Harry, time for bed.’
‘But I got him in to trouble, I don’t want him to hate me, but I know he will.’ Harry whined.  Hermione looked to her friend and noted the anguish on his face. She took pity on him and wrapped her arm around his shoulders.
Ron leaned forward and looked around Harry at the blond sitting on his other side, ‘Malfoy you said you had a hunch?’
His foul mood was back, if he had sat and thought about it then he would have realised, that of course another Weasley was bound to end up in Gryffindor, but to hear it confirmed to him that the little Weaselette would be sharing a common room with Harry had set him in a rage so he dutifully began murdering his breakfast once more.
‘Spit it out Ron,’ Harry sighed.
Summer had been  lovely but Draco knew it was a lost cause, Harry was dating Ginny, or well he had been, but he had talked to Draco about making it work, about building bridges after the war, Draco had sat nodding wisely and listened, all the while crumbling a little inside, he knew Harry liked girls, was making headway with Ginny and that was ok, he had accepted he would never be with Harry for these reasons and was learning to live with that, but now this, this changed everything.
Hermione was busy apologising to Neville and he was busy reassuring her, Blaise poked him in the arm, ‘Your turn Nev.’
‘What is it with you Harry?’ Ron shouted back, ‘Why do you care so much about rat face?’
Draco’s eyebrows rose towards his hairline, his eyes grew wide as he suppressed a small smile but not before harry had seen  the slightest twitch in the corner of Draco’s mouth.
Take your past and burn it up and let it go Carry on; I’m stronger than you’ll ever know.
‘Ron’s hurt, Norbert bit him,’ Hermione whispered, ‘we can’t move him alone.’ Harry looked at Hermione, ‘ Fine..... I’ll ask him tonight.’
Pansy had insisted that they go bare foot and Draco felt the chilling coldness of the castle’s stone floors with every step, but she was right of course, the three children hardly made a sound as they crept through the shadows. Each of the Slytherin’s had a dark hood pulled down over their faces and were almost invisible to the naked eye. The moonlight left bars across the floors that stretched like long fingers up the walls of each of the long corridors; these were avoided at all costs.
Harry whirled round at the sound of the voice he had been most wanting to hear and stopped in his tracks, his mouth dropped  as he took in the sight before him. Draco was stunning, Harry did not know where to look first, Draco’s soft, white-blonde hair was not gelled back but hung loose around his eyes in a way that framed his face perfectly, he seemed to fit his long limbs better now, looking more athletic than gangly, looking more like the man he was turning in to than ever, but what was most noticeable was his height, he was now more than a head taller than Harry, who hadn’t grown at all over the summer. He was still staring as Ron elbowed him sharply in the side, he glared at his best friend who whispered heatedly, ‘Quit drooling.’ Harry felt the tips of his ears heat up as he looked once again at the Slytherin, he was met with a smirk and an eyebrow raised in question, ‘Ha’, Harry thought as if I’m telling him, his head is big enough as it is.’
Ron gave a sharp nod of the head and followed Hermione up to the boy’s dormitory.
‘Hey Drake,’ he said, offering a smile to his friend.
. Narrowly missing Draco’s reply;
Neville was well used to Draco’s abrasive manner by now and merely chuckled at Draco’s impatience which caused the Slytherin in question to huff and fold his arms across his chest in a very un-Malfoy like manner.
‘Ron’ he said ‘she heard you.’
Draco had no clue what to say, he’d told what he knew and watched as Harry had fallen apart before his eyes. He was destroyed knowing that he had done that, that he had been the one to make Harry look that way. He shook his head, no Finnegan was he reminded himself and Finnegan would pay even if it was the last thing Draco ever did. He had leaned forward and rested his hand on Harry’s arm, unsure of how welcome it would be but needing to do something, anything to let the other boy know he was there for him. Harry hadn’t pushed him away, so he supposed it was welcome, he couldn’t find the words to comfort Harry, especially when he strongly believed that Finnegan wasn’t worth the tears. He watched as Harry moved his hands and his heart sank at those beautiful green eyes that were red-rimmed and full of pain. He squeezed Harry forearm gently still too unsure to speak.
Draco’s heart sank. He had to be kidding,  did this boy have a death wish?
Neither boy noticed the click of whir of the photo booth’s camera coming to life behind them.
Draco sat up abruptly and stared at Pansy as though she had just declared undying love for Ronald Weasley, ‘What do you mean?’
......
Draco stood frozen to the spot for a minute until a burning sensation  in him palm reminded him why he was here. Harry. He had to get to him, he put his pendant back around his neck and without a second thought he ran in to the room and jumped in to the open trapdoor just as the large dog took a swipe at him with his huge meaty paw.
He watched as Hermione led Harry away and the class began. The Hippogriffs were beautiful birds, majestic and proud. They stood surveying the students before then with mild disinterest as Hagrid explained how to approach them. Draco leaned against a nearby tree and crossed his arms across his chest, he noticed that Pansy wasn’t paying any attention what so ever, it appeared that she was far too busy staring dreamily at someone. Draco followed her line of site and wasn’t surprised  in the least to see it ended with Wesley,  the ginger boy did nothing for him but his friend was clearly infatuated with the, unfortunately, taken Gryffindor. With that thought in mind he risked a glance at Hermione and noticed that she was glaring in Pansy direction. This was not going to be pretty.
Harry woke early on the Saturday morning and lay for a while, thinking about the coming Quidditch match. He was nervous, he had never wanted to win so much, he had never wanted to beat Slytherin  so badly, he was looking forward to racing against Draco, to fly side by side with him, in competition with Draco to see who could get the snitch first, it was exciting  but he did not want to look stupid in front the Slytherin. Harry looked across the dorm at the slumbering form of Ron and sighed, they had not spoken a word to each other since that night in the common room and, despite everything Harry missed him. Harry had spent the last few weeks discussing the possibility of The Chamber of Secrets and it’s possible location with Hermione and Draco, occasionally bringing Blaise and Neville in to the mix, they had not got very far, but even so he still missed Ron’s input. Harry stopped himself and frowned as he realised that it had been Ron’s somewhat unwanted input that had caused their fight in the first place, Harry huffed , jumped up and got dressed, he headed to the Great Hall without a backwards glance to join the rest of the Gryffindor team around the table.
Draco snapped grey eyes on to his bushy haired friend, ‘Excuse me?’
‘Wait let me..’ Draco began rummaging around in Harry’s bag, he pulled out a quill and thrust both at Harry, ‘Write something.’
Ron had appeared for breakfast and sat in his usual seat across from Harry and Hermione, all his favourites piled high on the plate before him, he picked up his fork and pierced a sausage before risking a glance at Hermione. The girl in question looked tired, her eyes ringed with dark circles, Ron knew without asking that it was because of him, there was no coming back from what he had done for Pansy yesterday, he could argue that he would have done the same for anyone but Hermione would know, she would know it was a lie, she knew him like that. Hermione was clever, really clever, there was no point trying to lie, to talk his way out of it. He doubted she would even talk to him, but he needed to try. ‘Mione’, he said quietly across the table, just loud enough to get her attention. Her eyes snapped up to him glaring at his audacity to actually speak to her, he watched her knuckles grow white as her hand tightened around the fork in her hand. Ron opened his mouth as if to speak again and Hermione slammed her fork down, grabbed her bag and stormed from the Great Hall. Ron’s eyes dropped to his unfinished breakfast, he couldn’t leave this any longer. With a sigh he put down his fork and made to follow her.
Draco had come early to class, there was another thirty minutes until the start but he didn’t feel like being around people right now. He lazily drew lines on the desk in front of him with one long index finger, his chin was resting in his left hand as he heard the click of familiar stiletto heels on the stone floor of the classroom.
‘Where were you both?’ Pansy hissed across the table as she sat down across from her two best friends who seemed to be resolutely ignoring her.
The two boys had spent a leisurely half an hour whispering to each other and revelling in their new found relationship when they heard muffled talking from the next bed. On hearing this Draco sat bolt upright in bed and shouted across; ‘Morning, Merry Christmas, can we open presents now?’ Harry laughed as a pillow was launched across the room and hit Draco squarely in the face. ‘Hey’ Draco said indignantly huffing and hurling the pillow back,’ come on its Christmas I want to open my presents, I want to know what I got.’
‘You, you did all this ?’ Draco looked up questioningly, too startled to get up from his knees. Harry slowly lowered himself so he was knelt facing the Slytherin, he gently nodded his head watching the silver eyes intently,
‘I know Seamus but we can’t do this to him.’
years would all share. This is how Draco found himself sharing a room with the Gryffindor’s and Blaise. He was not surprised that no other Slytherin’s had returned but was secretly very glad about this. The dorms looked just like their house dorms, the seven beds spaced evenly around the room, each with their own pale blue curtains, the house colours of their two houses were intertwined in pastels in little touches throughout the room. Draco settled for a bed in the corner of the room across form Harry’s and began to unpack his trunk. Since the majority of the 8
‘What can Dobby do for Masters and Miss?’
‘I will forgive you calling me Severus during school time this once, but Draco you are aware that I am not and never have been prone to bouts of idiocy or stupidity and, as far as I am aware neither have you, so kindly refrain from acting so, I fully expected to find those three hot headed arrogant Gryffindor’s  believing that they can single handedly save the universe, but, imagine my surprise  when I found my Godson amongst them and coupled with your obvious concern for Potter I believe that there are some things that you have neglected to tell me.’
‘I know why you want to see Malfoy.’
......
‘Yes it’s a no, it just , you know, doesn’t feel right yet.’
‘Yes you bloody will’ thought Draco.
Draco raised an eyebrow, he released one of Harry’s arms and led him over to their usual spot in the corner. Draco sat gracefully, crossing his legs and leaning his back against the wall, never letting go of Harry’s wrist, Harry slid down the wall next to Draco, freeing his wrist, only to lace his fingers through Draco’s. Draco looked at their joined hands for a second before Harry spoke, ‘So?’ he asked quietly,
‘Hey,’ she said looking around nervously in case she was being ambushed, ‘ What’s up Draco?’
Harry looked nervously at Draco and answered ‘ Dare?’ although it came out as more of a question than a statement. At his answer Blaise’s smirk grew wider, ‘Ok, let me see, I dare you to sit on Weasley’s knee for the next four questions.’ Blaise said this without taking his eyes from Draco and witnessed the dangerous look appearing in his friend’s eye at the dare. Blaise did not mind, he could handle Draco.
Draco could not answer for a moment, The heir of Slytherin, were they insane, parseltounge was unusual , ok so it was rare, very rare,  but these people were clearly insane , before he could reply Blaise wandered in to the common room, he caught the Italian’s eyes and glanced down at the parchment on his lap in what he hoped was a meaningful way, Blaise nodded in acknowledgment and climbed on his bed pulling his own parchment from beneath his pillow. Within a minute Blaise’s elegant cursive had appeared at the parchment.
‘Blaise’ he answered, ‘Truth or dare?’
Draco fought back the tears that had gathered in his eyes and re-read the note, someone had gone to a lot of effort for him someone who obviously knew him well, who was his mystery gift giver, he figured there was only one way to find out he carefully placed the rose back in the box and stored it carefully in his bag, leaving the Great Hall he made his way to the greenhouses.
Harry looked at the blonde Slytherin and believed him. ‘Okay,’ he said and told him his news.
‘So how do you want to do this?’ Blaise asked the room in general.
‘Nope no way, you know how I feel.’ Ron shuddered visibly and Harry felt the pangs of sympathy for his friend.
Draco laced their fingers together and sighed, ‘It’s natural’ Draco closed his eyes and swallowed, mentally preparing himself for what he was about to do. Before he could second guess himself he pulled Harrys hand towards him and placed it gently over his answering hardness.  Harry snatched his hand back, not sure how he was supposed to feel, he felt his cheeks burning and noticed Draco’s were too, ‘Sorry’ Draco said, running a hand through his hair and taking a step back with a sigh. ‘I know it’s too much, too soon, I’m sorry if I scared you, but I wanted you to know you weren’t alone in what you were feeling.’ Draco hung his head and once again ran his hand through his hair, Harry took a step towards him, ‘You’re right, ‘ he whispered, ‘It is too much but I’m glad you did it, ‘ at this Draco’s head snapped up, ‘What? Why?’  ‘ I was embarrassed and ashamed,’ shrugged Harry, ‘Now I know it wasn’t just me.’ Draco gathered Harry in to his arms, ‘It will never be just you Harry.’ Harry smiled and snuggled in closer, feeling the happiest he had felt in a long time.
‘Sorry Ginny, I’m just thinking you know.’
Harry chuckled as he basked in Hermione’s enthusiasm. Ron was staring at the exchange with a look of complete confusion, he thought that they hated the know- it- all, his forehead wrinkled as he tried to figure out what was going on and what exactly he had missed. Then suddenly he snapped to attention, he had just remembered what he had missed, the fight between Harry and Malfoy. Ron glanced at the Slytherin table as he sat down, the blonde didn’t look bruised or bloody like he expected, in fact, Ron thought he looked really happy. This thought filled Ron with dread as he turned to look at Harry who was still whispering with Hermione he realised Harry looked really happy too! Ron’s confusion spread and he could not stay quiet anymore.
‘Well, actually, the thing is.’
Draco watched as Harry was evidently thinking things through in his mind. He’d had to tell him but now, now he’d lost him, he knew he had, his father had ruined the best, and probably the most real friendship that he had ever had. He couldn’t take it anymore.
Harry pressed his forehead against the taller boys and clasped a hand to the back of his neck, ‘because I don’t want to you git I just needed you to know how much you hurt me, how could we move on if you didn’t know?’
Heat rose in Harry’s cheeks, he stared at the floor and suddenly found his feet really interesting;
.......
‘Draco, I have thought of nothing but you since the day I met you,, at first I was confused and then after time  I recognised it for what is was. When I was away, for seventh year, all that time, is was the thought of you that made me wake and start each new day, I fought to come back to you, when you denied knowledge of me that day at the Manor I knew I wasn’t wrong about you, that I had never been wrong.’
‘Well you are, you know me, would I be here if I didn’t want to be?’ Harry raised an eyebrow trying his best to imitate the patented Draco Malfoy look, ‘and as for Ginny, she’s Ron’s sister, just a little kid,’ Harry shrugged, ‘I mean she’s ok and all Drake, but well, she’s not you is she.’
‘Yes,’ Draco was beginning to get furious at Harry laughing at him.
Earlier that day..
Draco glared at Ron and accepted the challenge, ‘Truth’ he said in a dangerous tone which Ron duly ignored.
Ron watched, expecting embarrassment, denial, violence and perhaps even pink hair but what he got surprised him. Slowly Draco got up and took the three steps he needed to cross the circle, he squatted in front of Ron so they were eye to eye, he turned his head slightly to Hermione and smiled sweetly, ‘Am I right in thinking that was four questions.’ Hermione  inclined her head slightly to say yes, watching the Slytherin warily. A small smile appeared on Draco’s face as he turned, once again, to look at Ron, ‘Good,’ Draco said with a smile ‘Weasley would you mind ever so much getting your sweaty paws from off my boyfriend?’ Draco asked politely with a somewhat sinister smile. Ron’s mouth dropped open,  he looked at Harry hoping for, well help or denial or anything really, but got nothing in response, meanwhile Draco had stood and was holding his hand out to Harry, Harry turned and offered Ron a somewhat guilty smile and accepted Draco’s hand. As the couple walked back to their spots in the circle, Draco looked over his shoulder at the, once again, red-faced, lost for words, Weasley;
Blaise wrote.
‘Drake?’
‘Of course not, I’m just sure I sound pretty insane that’s all.’ Harry shrugged again,
years would ever take at Hogwarts and so a party was quickly organised; illicit stashes of Firewhiskey and Ogden’s finest were pulled out of secret hiding places throughout the castle, and the 8
Neville gingerly handed the parchment and quill to Ron, Ron glanced at Harry and then wrote quickly before the smaller boy could stop him;
‘I am simply congratulating Potter, although,’ she said, looking back at Harry and placing a hand on his shoulder, ‘ I’m sure if Potter wants me to congratulate him in private I can think of a place or three that can become a
Draco had been lost in his own thoughts, he had not noticed the shadows creeping silently across the floor marking the passage of time. A bat flew by the window causing a large shadow to be cast across the book in Draco’s lap, this was enough to rouse him from his thoughts. Using his wand, Draco checked the time. The digits that were projected in to the air in front of him surprised him, he had been sitting, lost to his own thoughts, for almost an hour and worryingly there was still no sign of Harry.
Draco barked a laugh in Harry’s face, grinning widely he said; ‘Ok, ok, so tell me about this diary then.’
Blaise growled lowly and stole a glance at Neville who simply smiled sweetly at him, Blaise sighed resignedly ,’Snape,’ he said in a low voice as he felt heat rising in his cheeks, ‘as well you know Draco.’
If it had been at all possible, Draco believed that he would be physically glowing at this point. He fought hard to reign in the smile that threatened to spread across his face but a little smirk managed to break through.
‘Hey scarhead why are you hitting yourself,’ he sneered across the Great Hall. Harry stared at him and Draco noticed the pleading look in his eyes, he needed him, Draco needed a way to get to Harry.
‘Weasley where’s your pants?’
Before Harry could answer the door swung open admitting the two Slytherin’s , Draco glanced approvingly around the room before making his way over to the boys and pulling Harry in to his arms for a hug. Harry smiled and allowed himself to be embraced as he waited for them to notice the unusual sleeping arrangements that the room had decided for them. Blaise noticed first and raised an eyebrow; ‘Two beds?’
‘I have no idea what I would have done if anything had happened to the two of you.’
The ideas for this story has been running around in my head for weeks now and I just have not had one minute if peace to take the time to get them down. It’s gone ten at night and I’ve just sat down, I have to be up at 6.30 for work but I just can’t have them rattling around in there anymore.
Suddenly, a strange noise started echoing throughout the chamber, 'Wheeeeeee, whooooo wheeeee.'
Draco inclined his head which the centaur returned.’ ‘Firenze.’
‘Ginny Weasley,’ said Professor McGonagall.
When Pansy didn’t speak Ron cleared his throat and tried again ‘hey?’ Pansy snapped out if her trance like state and replied ‘hello is there something you need?’ Ron rolled his eyes at the formality if it all and took a step closer, he gingerly raised a hand to place on her left forearm wincing when she flinched away from the contact. Ron closed his eyes and took a deep breath, moving his arm back to his side, he was acutely aware if the scrutiny they were under and now he could hear his brother barking orders to the other Gryffindors behind him. He lifted a hand to the back of his neck and lowered his head slightly ‘so um I thought you’d be interested in what’s been gping on tonight,’ Ron was sure he didn’t imagine the almost imperceptible stiffening of Draco's shoulders or the small step Blaise made towards him before checking himself. His  friends were very lucky to have people that cared this much. Pansy nodded and spoke quietly looking at Ron though her thick lashes ‘Please’. With that one word and the way she was looking at him Ron knew he was a lost cause. He swallowed thickly and inclined his head slightly ‘we got back to the common room earlier and the Fat Lady had disappeared...’ before he could continue Pansy interrupted, ‘who is that ?’ Ron summoned some courage from his seriously depleting reserves and placed his hand back on Pansy's  arm, relishing the comfort it brought after the evening he had just had.
Severus merely raised an eyebrow.
“Well I mean there are way around that. I mean if I really wanted to flirt with someone’s boyfriend without risk of retaliation, I would make sure I did it in public, the more witnesses the better, preferably teachers, I’d also make sue Pansy never left my side. That is bound to work.’
Draco rolled his eyes at the obvious statement and, although it felt strange to write to someone in the same room he wrote his reply.
Malfoy cleared his throat as the Gryffindor continued to stare in to his eyes. Harry shook himself, feeling a heat rise on his cheeks. ‘Malfoy?’ he said, a question in his tone. Long, pale fingers lifted to sift through blond hair, Harry followed it with his eyes as it fell back on to the pale face. Malfoy looked around; ‘can we go somewhere to talk?’ Harry then took a moment to glance around, they had gathered quite a crowd, people watching in awe as the ice price had approached the golden boy, they were obviously expecting a fight. Harry rolled his eyes, ‘come on’ he said, walking in the direction of the staircase, he didn’t look around but he could sense that Malfoy was following him, he kept walking, wondering where to go, wondering what it was Malfoy wanted to talk about. He knew they couldn’t go to the Room of Requirement that would be disastrous so he turned left abruptly, instead of walking up the stairs he took the smaller set leading down to the basement; he wondered, with a chuckle, if Malfoy knew exactly how close they were to the Hufflepuff common room.  He came to a halt in front of a large paining of a bowl of fruit and turned to see if Malfoy was still there. The man in question raised an inquiring eyebrow but remained silent as Harry leaned forward to tickle the pear.
Since the kiss Draco Malfoy had thought of little else. The feel of Harry pressed against him as he wrapped his arms possessively around the boy. He had been caught daydreaming on more than one occasion, inducing more than one teasing session from his fellow Slytherins and had practically skipped to the Trophy Room that night, well he would have done if Malfoy’s skipped, but he felt like skipping.
Harry shrugged, ‘I have no idea and I don’t think I want to find out, come on, we need to move.’
‘Yes of course, but why on earth are you asking that question?’ Let me guess, Trelawny predicted your death again.’ Draco said with a small smile.
‘Ok,’ Draco took a moment to pretend to think, ‘ so which of the professors do you think is nice looking?’ Draco asked with a smirk.
.......................
Draco was taken aback slightly by the response; he had known all too well exactly what Harry felt about having to be left alone in the castle today. While he strongly believed Harry was in no danger from Sirius Black it wasn’t a good idea for Harry to be anywhere near the Dementors if he could help it. Was he being sarcastic?
‘Go on.’Draco swallowed.
‘And you want to go further?’
......
Draco shoved Ron rudely to the side as he pushed his face flat against the dirty rock wall, squinting through the smallest gap in a vain attempt to see his boyfriend.

‘Malfoy’ the professor shouted signalling his turn at the wardrobe. The blond boy swaggered forward, indifference oozing from every pore, mask of ice firmly in place but, a certain eagle-eyed Gryffindor spotted a flicker of apprehension in the silver eyes he knew so well. ‘Ron’ he hissed elbowing his red-headed friend sharply in the ribs. Ron glared at him from the corner of his eye, ‘What?’ he hissed. Harry shuffled a little closer to his friend, leaning close so that he could whisper in to Ron’s ear ‘I can’t let Draco do this, he can’t face the Boggart, he can’t let the others see his biggest fear especially if it’s what I think it is.’ Ron glanced over to the Slytherin in question and thought he saw the boy falter, it must be something really bad if his mask was slipping. He didn’t know what Harry was worried about but he could see concern etched  on every inch of the smaller boys face and, against all odds, he found himself becoming firm friends with the blond-haired Slytherin. Without a second thought to his still tender back he strode across the room and shoved the other boy to the floor.  He flinched as Draco hit the floor silently praying that he would understand, but had no more time to react before he was faced with a six foot spider baring down on him, vaguely he registered Draco in the background ordering Crabbe and Goyle to leave him to the spider. He whimpered at the thought and tried desperately to remember the spell to end his torment.
The blond carded his hands through his hair with a sigh, ‘I found my soul song.’ The hurt and desperation evident in the younger man’s tone momentarily confused Severus, surely this was a happy occasion? He looked over at his young charge and voiced this thougth; ‘My apologies Draco but I always assumed that this was a happy event.’
‘That’s ok I want to give Blaise his last anyway.’
When Hagrid was sure Filch was out of hearing he turned to the three students:
‘Follow me.’ Neville said and left the room. He led the boys up to the seventh floor corridor and asked them to stand still for a moment, ignoring Draco’s muttered complaints about having to climb copious amounts of stairs for seemingly no good reason. Neville’s audience watched with varying levels of interest and confusion as the small boy paced backwards and forwards along the empty corridor in front of them, then suddenly, jaws dropped open and eyes grew wide as a large ornately carved door appeared on a previously blank section of the wall before them.  With a grin, Neville placed a hand on the door and gently pushed it open, he turned to the boys behind him, ‘Welcome to the Room of Requirement.
Draco folded the parchment with a smile and placed it carefully in to the pocket of his robes, he looked up and gave an almost imperceptible nod to the green-eyed Gryffindor who was watching him intently. They really were going to have to talk about subtlety.
Looking a little insulted, Harry went to remove his hand from Draco’s, Draco quickly gripped the hand, suddenly afraid that if he let go he would never have the chance to hold it again. He pulled on Harry’s arm and pulled the man in to his embrace, ‘You imbecile, even I wasn’t a fully-fledged, card-carrying homosexual myself, you’re one of my closest friends in need of comforting, of course I don’t mind.’
Harry took a moment before replying, 'it felt nice, different, but nice, that's what made me do it again.' Draco nodded, again he was unsure of what to say that would not break the charged moment they were both sharing.  During the conversation the hardness in his trousers had almost gone but then Harry moved again, that one tiny movement sent a spark straight to the tip. It was not lost of Draco that he was rock hard and his dick was pressed against the firm buttocks of his boyfriend. He knew if Harry continued this would only end one way, 'Harry, if you carry on, there is a chance I might, you know?' It took Harry a second and Draco saw the moment that it hit him, the look of realisation and even a little fear crossed Harry's face. 'Ok, so erm,' Harry looked down at his fingers, 'so do you want me to stop?' Draco shook his head and took hold of Harry's hands, he swallowed hard and looked Harry in the eye, 'if it's ok with you it's ok with me?'
......
Draco was lay curled on his bed sobbing, being in the dungeons there were no windows so it was an enchanted sunrise that washed over his face. Draco sniffed and sat up, every available surface around him was littered with presents wrapped immaculately in silver and green. Draco didn’t want presents he just wanted his mother, but, just then he spotted a present that was not like the others  on his side table, buried under a pile of other presents was a very messily wrapped present in blue paper covered in jolly snowmen wearing top hats. Draco hurried over and grabbed the present causing a cascade of presents to fall from the table, he didn’t even wince as he heard the shattering of glass. Draco jumped back on his bed, all tears forgotten, he crossed his legs beneath him and stared at the badly wrapped present on his lap. He was eager to know who the present was from and turned over the label, which simply said;
Draco remembered the relief he had felt as he had seen Harry walk in to the trophy room that night. He had not even thought twice about hugging him and he had not even been embarrassed about it, he didn’t acre he just wanted Harry to know he’d been scared. He’d not let Harry know he’d run to the bathrooms, that was the only thing that embarrassed him, he had just acted instinctively, luckily his fellow Slytherin’s had assumed he was just going to have a good laugh at the unlucky Gryffindor’s.
Anyway it's been too long, I'll shut up we need to see how Draco is faring being stuck on the other side of the rock fall.
I have wanted to sit and write I just didn't have time. There were genuine reasons keeping me away but I am still sorry,
‘Do you think that’s a good idea?’ came the bored voice of Pansy as she and the others pointed their own wands at the red-head.
‘Look in it properly, stand where I am.’
Myrtle somehow managed to kept her eyes on Harry and pointed vaguely in the direction of the sink in front of her toilet, ‘Somewhere there.’
Song : Calum Scott – Dancing on my own.
Draco was excited as he made his way over to the pitch for his first ever Quidditch practice as part of the house team, to look at him  you would never guess how excited he actually was, his features were schooled in to indifference, however a smirk had been allowed to play on his lips. He looked up as he heard his captain grumble;
Harry watched as the blonde’s face changed from shock, to happiness then to cold indifference. Harry’s smile faltered. He had hoped to make some friends before school started, this was going to be harder than he thought.
‘a century,’ finished Harry.
Harry shrugged and said, matter of factly, ‘Well not me,’
Harry had decided that it would be a good idea to go and find Justin and explain the truth behind the whole snake situation. This is how he found himself in his current position, in the library surrounded by a group of shaken Hufflepuff’s who evidently believed that he was the Heir of Slytherin and that he was out to get all Muggle borns regardless of how vehemently he denied it refusing to listen to any explanations that he offered. This was how life had been for him, every where he looked people were whispering and staring, some even visibly shying away from him in the corridors. It was ridiculous, no matter what he said no one would hear him out. He attempted to continue the argument with the Hufflepuff’s before realising that it was fruitless and giving up and storming out of the library. He didn’t see the point it wasn’t like they were listening anyway. Harry bumped in to Hagrid swinging a dead rooster around and couldn’t quite believe the bizarre turn his life had taken. His last thought before he turned the corner was ‘how could it get any worse?’
Draco sighed and shook his head, a long strand of his white blonde hair falling in to his eye as he did so, ‘What’s the point?’ He sighed reaching up to tuck it behind his ear.
AN : We left our hero’s in the Chamber of Secrets patiently awaiting their lift from Fawkes, from then on everything with Lucius and Dobby happened and Harry’s summer remained the same, including te Aunt Marge incident and The Knight Bus.
Hermione meanwhile was trying, once again to continue the game, ‘So Harry’ she said, fully aware of the dangerous game Ron was playing, who are you going to ask ?’
‘What’ Draco snapped, ‘of course I fucking am idiot.’ With that he sloped off. Goyle stared at Crabbe who just shrugged and followed in Draco’s wake.
Ron shrugged, ‘Yeah I guess, and I’m really sorry for hitting you , it was a reaction, I didn’t mean for it to happen, god I’m sorry Harry, I didn’t realise how much it affected you, I shouldn’t have done it.’
.......
Harry stared open mouthed at Draco, ‘Could a house elf do that?’
After the battle he had found her. She was grieving for her brother and didn’t want this conversation but knew she had to, knew it needed saying; he had sat down next to her, taken her hand, taken a deep breath and ‘I’m gay’ were the next words she had heard. To say Harry had been shocked by her laughter was a slight understatement. That was her immediate reaction, a short, sharp burst of relieved laughter. Apparently long, lonely nights in a tent with nothing but his thoughts for company had helped him come to the realisation, he said he couldn’t have waited any longer to confess. She had in turn confessed, telling Harry all about Neville, there had been no resentment, just relief on either side. The conversation and hug that followed had cemented them as best friends. Neville was nervous about the closeness at first until Harry came out to him, eventually he started to relax, now he didn’t bat an eyelid when walking in to the common room to find Harry with his head on Ginny’s lap as she twisted his unruly hair in to tiny braids.
Draco noticed Ron's voice catch when he mentioned his friends name, he glanced quickly at the red-headed Gryffindor and notice the pink tinge cross his cheek bones fleetingly, he registered the thought but for now Harry was a top priority.
‘It didn’t work,’ Harry said finally looking up, ‘ It didn’t stop the pain, it only works when you do it.’
‘Mione how will I even know who it is?’
The next morning Harry sorely regretted staying up talking with Draco until the early hours as he was shaken awake by a very agitated  Oliver Wood demanding he get up for Quidditch practice,
‘Blaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiissssssssseeeeeeeeeeeee.’ Whined Draco, ‘C’mon,it’s Chrriiiiiiisssssssssssttttttttmmmmmmmmmaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssss.’ Draco dragged the word out as he stuck out his bottom lip, ‘ I want my presents.’ Harry couldn’t help but chuckle at the perfect picture of a spoiled brat his new boyfriend was making. However he also wanted to get to the presents and knew what would get Neville moving, the delicious selection of baked goods that were a sure thing from Ron’s mum, ‘Nev you ‘wake?’ he said to the other lump in the bed.
‘How does it work?’
‘Weasley.’
‘I can see them,’ he whispered, ‘can’t you?’
It was about half way through the lesson when Draco decided to act, McGonagol was busy revisiting theory with a group of Slytherins who knew Draco needed a distraction. Slowly Draco slid his wand off the table and pointed it in the direction of his bag, he whispered an incantation that Pansy had looked up for him, with a quick glance and a smirk he noticed that the charm was working as planned so he sat back to enjoy the show.
‘I want to save Harry’s until last.’
‘Maybe he hoped Draco would tell you..’ Hermione started.
Draco shrugged and brought a hand to his face closely examining his finger nails. ‘Surely that is my business, Blaise, you know I am not one to gossip and talk about private affairs.’
‘I can’t see anything at all.’
Harry turned slightly to his side so that he could see Draco’s face better, his fringe was falling across his face and into his eyes. Without thinking Harry reached out and brushed the blond hair back from Draco’s face.
Harry looked up in to those silver eyes, ‘He was calling you names, I told him to stop, he wouldn’t, he wanted to know why I was defending you, I’m so sorry Drake.’ Harry mumbled in a small voice
‘What?’ Draco asked, shrugging his shoulders, ‘Just telling it how it is.’
‘Why were you in my bed, are you mad? Your friends are going to kill me.’
......
Draco couldn’t resist a smirk as he pushed open the large oak door.
Ron Weasley was bored and lonely, it had been weeks since he had lost his temper and punched his best friend, people were slowly starting to acknowledge him again but no one, not even his brothers would speak to him. His friends were avoiding him and even Hermione only stayed by his side so he was not left alone. It had been made worse by Ron’s insistence on not telling anyone the reason behind his outburst, he strongly believed Harry and Malfoy’s friendship was a whim and Harry was just dancing on the dark side, Ron believed he would get bored and it would end and Harry would come running back full of apologies, after all it was Malfoy who would want to remain friends with that slimy git. Ron plonked himself down at the breakfast table and threw a glare in the Slytherin’s direction for good measure, blaming them wholeheartedly for everything that he was going through, however Ron was most disconcerted to find Draco waving and smiling at him, Ron’s head snapped round looking for the real target of Draco’s attention only to find he was alone, what was the Slytherin up to, Ron furrowed his brow and decided to ignore the pretentious git, friend of Harry’s or not he would not let him get to him, he had a day full of him and the rest of his bloody house so he needed to control his temper and just enjoy his breakfast.
‘Why are you crying?’
Harry found Draco pacing, he walked right up to him and wrapped his arms around him, trapping his arms to his sides,
‘We will know soon enough, here’s Flitwick with our timetables.’ Interrupted Blaise from his left side.
‘I didn’t know how to top last year.’ Harry started as he handed the messily wrapped parcel over to Draco. Draco smiled, ‘I don’t care, all presents are great and presents from you are even better,’ he then began pulling the paper off. His eyes grew wide as they fell on the hidden treasure within, Draco was lost for words, this was something that he would have never thought to get for himself, he had never owned anything like it in his life. In his lap lay a stuffed toy, a stuffed toy that was a snow-white lion cub, a perfect replica, apart from the eyes, the eyes were a piercing Emerald Green, an exact match to Harry’s, Draco stroked the head of the small lion and his body filled with warmth. Harry worried his bottom lip as he watched Draco with his present, ‘Do you like it?’
Although he was annoyed Draco couldn’t suppress a smile upon hearing his friend’s voice. Harry visibly  relaxed as Draco smiled.
‘No need to ask how you are,’ sighed Draco.
Draco swept grey eyes across the hall once more and felt bile rise in his throat where the hell were they? He brought his hand up to his face just as Pansy gave an extremely undignified squeak. He turned and looked in her direction and immediately spotted the reason behind the squeak, walking nervously towards her was the ginger haired object of her affections.
It was a suggestion of a spell that they could use against Snape if he tried anything on Harry again. Hermione thought about it, she’d read about it somewhere, the leg-locker curse, that could work she thought . Hermione looked across the hall at the Slytherin table and managed to catch the blonde’s eye, Hermione nodded once then turned to Harry and Ron and explained the curse that she had just read about and how she thought it would be helpful to protect Harry from Snape.
Harry sighed and ran his hand down his face, rolling his eyes as he did so. He did love that boy, but he was such a drama queen, ‘You're right it was me. Where did he go?’
Draco was tired, he ached, he wanted to shower and to relax, he wouldn’t sleep, sleep never came anymore, he didn’t deserve it. He only had to look at the mark on his arm to realise that. He reached his room and pushed the door open, the room was bare, like a cell, that was how he wanted it, no more than he deserved. He pulled his shirt over his head and heard his body crack in protest as he did so, he approached the bathroom with practiced determination. Once in there Draco took hold of the muggle razor blade and dragged it deeply across the mark that marred his skin. He hissed at the puncture and bit his lip at the pain. It hurt like hell but the most important thing was that he felt it, he felt every moment as he sliced his skin, he watched the bright red of the blood hit the white basin then stood in shock as a tear fell diluting the red pool in front of him.
‘Seriously though Draco, is he just ignoring you?’
‘Can you think what the mirror is showing us at all Harry?’
.....
Draco did not see it coming, he was flat on his back in The Great Hall before he knew what, or who, had hit him. He raised a fist to his stinging cheek and tried to make sense of the chaos around him, he felt the strong arm of Crabbe hoist him to his feet as his counterpart, Goyle, was seeking retribution. He looked around at the mess of red and green as Slytherin and Gryffindor fought and argued around him. He caught the eye of his red-faced boyfriend who in turn glanced nervously to his left. Draco followed the gaze and met the smug grin of Ron Weasley. The Gryffindor was nursing his fist with pride. Draco and Ron locked eyes, there was a scuffle in the space between them as Goyle tried to get at Ron but Draco just watched, he knew what the punch had been for and knew that it was well deserved. He nodded in acknowledgement at the red-head, he received a nod in return, Ron felt that justice, for now, had been done.  Draco walked away taking his surprised housemates with him, feeling, as he walked away, a growing respect for his boyfriends best-friend.
The gossips had almost fainted with glee the next day as news spread of Ron's daring rescue, and then,  when the break up with Hermione was made public the gossip went in to overdrive, despite Pansy and Ron not being seen together since the incident it continued to so spread like Fiendfyre. It was the scandal of if really a Gryffindor with a Slytherin, a Weasley with a Parkinson, Draco Malfoy's best friend with Harry Potter's. The last one had made Ron laugh so hard he had snorted milk out of his nose, imagine when the gossips found the truth about that one out. However, that wasnt the priority now, Ron had seen the Slytherins arrive and  he'd caught the ashen faces of his three Slytherin friends as soon as they had entered the hall. He could tell just from looking at them that they were worried as much as they tried to conceal it with masks of indifference and disdain. He could also see from his vantage point that they clearly hadn't spotted them, the eyes of all three of them never stilled as they roved across the crowd before them. It didn't help that Harry , Neville And Hermione were hunkered down behind the crowd of Gryffindors furiously whispering about the evenings events not a second thought to certain students that would be worried sick once they heard the truth of what had happened. Ron chanced another look around the hall and spotted his brother Percy puffing himself out importantly , he knew he had a matter of minutes if was going to do what he had to do, the lot of the gits better really appreciate it.
‘I’ll ask her’
‘Yeah c’mon Wood I’m wasting away here.’ Grumbled George Weasley. Just then Colin Creevey joined them on the pitch,
‘Yes of course,’ said Hermione shutting the book in front of her.
‘What did you do?’ a voice hissed in his ear.
Ron turned his fear filled eyes on his brother, ‘S – p –pppp – pider.’ Ron managed to get out from between trembling lips, ‘On my hand’ he whispered as though it may be able to hear him.
‘Yes.’
‘Brilliant,’ sighed Draco as he let his head fall in to his hands ‘just brilliant.’
Harry had been so grateful and felt honoured that he had been allowed to see this, ‘I don’t remember you singing that day,’ he paused as though thinking back, ‘ in fact nothing much seemed to change, it didn’t feel any different.’
Harry pulled off the cloak as he and Draco ran down the corridor laughing at their brilliant escape, just then they heard voices up ahead. Draco grabbed Harry and pulled him in to the nearest room. The voices walked straight past and Harry leaned against the wall breathing deeply listening to the footsteps fading away.
Ginny had watched Harry with interest since her realisation, hoping against hope he would Gryffindor up and get on with being happy. They were best friends, how couldn’t they be after everything they had been through together. There was a moment, right before the war when it looked like they might be together, then the war had happened and her 6
Harry steeled himself, it was now or never. ‘Have you and Blaise, you know, done things?’ Harry felt that the atmosphere in the room doubled in thickness. The room was filled with silence for so long the Harry thought he had overstepped, he turned to look at Neville to reassure him that he didn't need to answer him, but what he saw him stopped him in his tracks. Neville's face was covered with the dopiest look Harry had ever seen on the boy, his eyes were glazed over, clearly lost in some memory or other and his grin was so wide it was almost splitting his face in two. ‘Nev’ Harry prompted, Neville blinked slowly and turned to aim his grin at Harry, ‘I guess I have my answer then,’ Harry snorted, ‘Are you ok discussing this or would you like to keep it between the two of you?’ Neville nodded, ‘Obviously there are some things I’d like to keep to myself,’ Harry nodded, ‘But I don’t mind discussing this with you at all. Why are you asking? Have you and Draco?’
Harry smiled at his friend as they continued opening their presents sitting under the gigantic Christmas tree.
Ron spluttered indignantly and turned an interesting shade of post box red and, before he could stop himself he answered, ‘No.. what? .. I mean, of course I don’t it’s Mione.’
‘Father, I am off to choose an early birthday present.’ He said looking over his shoulder at the tall blonde wizard who had followed him in to the shop.
The room itself was simplistic, but beautiful in its simplicity.  There was a pine side table that held a few books and a lamp, this stood to the side of a large lumpy, but comfy looking sofa that took up most of the small room. There was no fire, not even a fire place and for that Draco was eternally grateful. He reached behind him without looking and gently took Harry’s hand once more, he wondered what the other boy thought of his actions but still he kept hold and they walked across the room and sat gingerly, side by side on the sofa.
The red-head  ran a hand through his shoulder length hair, ‘Mate, Hermione told you, no one else can hear it the first time and plus’, he said with another shrug, ‘we were so stressed, there was so much going on we didn’t even kiss until, well you know.’
A million thoughts went through his mind, this bloody muggle-born, too nosey for her own good. God, she’d relish telling the whole world just to make him look like an idiot.
‘What?’ Ron spat, ‘I know it was you, so why don’t you just admit it?’
Harry’s head snapped up at hearing his name from Ron, ‘What?’ he said cautiously.
‘Draco,’ Harry said, as he stopped laughing, ‘ They all knew I was in your bed already, they watched me get in.’ Harry said to the astonished Slytherin.
Hermione considered this for a moment,
Harry sat up with a start, he turned his head to glare at the blond at is side ‘C’mon Drake you know full well that he does he can’t stand the sight of me.’ Harry huffed and crossed his arms across his chest as though in an act of defiance, Draco smirked and reached out with his left hand and pulled Harry back in to his arms by his collar, he wrapped his arm around the smaller boy pulling him back against his chest;  ‘Behave Potter, you are not a child.’ This caused Harry to huff and stick out his bottom lip, ‘actually Drake I think you’ll find I am,’ Draco laughed at the petulant display, after a second or two Harry relented and gave Draco a little dig with his elbow before continuing; ‘ seriously though I grew up as a muggle, I have no bloody idea what these subjects are, Divination, what the hell is that?’
‘Harry?’
‘Well I sort of named it that, let me explain.’
‘Oh wait, it gets better,’ and with that he leaned over , picked up Draco’s pendant and touched it to his own, Draco gasped , before his eyes the snake started to move, while he watched the serpent protectively wrapped itself around  the sword, finally laying its head on the hilt of the sword. Draco’ mouth dropped open.
“Now that,” Draco thought, “Is the question.”
‘Fuck’ he thought , ‘now I really need to speak to Harry, or (he swallowed ) bloody Granger’.
Draco dropped his hand and stared at Harry before he stomped out of the compartment. Shit! He thought shit, shit, shit.
Harry pulled back from the Pensive and looked in shock at his best friend, ‘Thanks for sharing that mate,’ he said quietly, still in awe of what he had seen. Ron merely shrugged seemingly too caught up in the memory to speak for the moment.
‘No Ron, it’s never too late.’
‘Maybe Draco, I don’t know, it just feels, you know, different around him.’
‘Harry swallowed hard, ‘Have you, you know? ,,, Oh Merlin this is so bloody hard, not to mention ridiculously embarrassing ,’ Harry groaned and flopped dramatically back on to his bed flinging his arms across his face. He stared at the ceiling and willed his courage to not dessert him completely. He felt the bed move next to him and looked around to see that Neville had joined him, the other boy slowly lowered himself until he was lying side by side with Harry. ‘Is this any easier?’ Neville asked, his own eyes never leaving the ceiling, ‘You know, now you don’t have to look at me and it might be easier to ask what you want to ask,’ Harry huffed a laugh in response, ‘Yeah I think that he might be.’
The portrait swung open and Harry threw himself in to the Gryffindor common room, every head in there turned to stare at him, he heard the whispers following him as he raced up the stairs toward the dormitory taking them two at a time, he swung around the door frame in to the dorm and stopped dead at the sight that greeted him, the dorm room was covered in almost everything that he owned, pages of his homework and text books littered the floor, even his clothes had been pulled from the trunk and were scattered haphazardly throughout the room. At that moment Harry had never been happier that Draco had borrowed the invisibility cloak, with that thought he glanced at Neville raising a questioning eyebrow, Neville caught on to the meaning of what was being asked and glanced quickly towards a seemingly empty corner of the room, Harry felt his shoulders relax knowing that Draco was here in the room with him.
‘EEEEEEEEEEWWWW,’ whispered Harry, ‘Trolls Ron, really?’
The blonde watched the smile leave the other boy’s face  and a feeling of sadness swept over him. He steped down from his stool and walked towards Harry;
‘Almost dinner, he brought you here before breakfast, you were having a severe panic attack Mr Malfoy can you remember what happened?’
Draco fidgeted in his compartment, what on earth was wrong with him? Why couldn’t he relax? He;d been the same way since watching Madam Malkin’s that day over the summer. What did the boy go home to? He wondered, and, actually, why the hell did he care?
I apologise if anyone was offended by this :( I don't necessarily agree with Draco here and I certainly wouldn't use a phobia to get my revenge, but, in trying to think of a revenge I realised that that is exactly what Draco would do, he would exploit a weakness of his enemy and use it to his advantage. I was thinking like Draco. Sorry :$

When Sirius did not return by evening, Harry became concerned. He employed a tracking spell, which allowed him to follow Sirius’ trail. Eventually it led to a secluded castle hidden deep among the trees. The spell directed him through the gates, and Harry entered cautiously.
Harry pulled out the mirror and held it aloft. “He’s telling the truth, and I can prove it!
“This is all my fault,” groaned Harry, as another failed spell bounced back at him from the cellar door.

And as he looked into the bright eyes of this determined stranger who was risking his own life to help another, he felt astonishment and curiosity outweighing his anger at being intruded upon.
AND HARRY AND THE PRINCE LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER.
Nearby there was a town governed by the calculating and cruel Madam Umbridge. There were whispers amongst the people about deposing her, and replacing her as their leader with local war hero Harry Potter - a young man who had defeated a dark wizard and was well known for his just and unselfish nature. Madam Umbridge knew that to remain in power she would need Harry’s unequivocal support. However, he rebuffed all her attempts to approach him on the matter, and she was filled with desperate anger at her repeated failures.
And thus the kingdom was restored to its rightful state, and yet it was better than before. Madam Umbridge was stripped of her authority and could no longer trouble anyone.
I think you lost a few marbles in prison, Sirius!” one of them sneered. Several of them grabbed ahold of him, and they threw him out of the pub into the snow.
Harry yelled in confusion and jumped back, as the beast lunged, snapping his teeth at Harry who was quickly backing out of the room.  Harry stopped and stood in the doorway observing that the beast was too much of a coward to actually attack him. He shouted back, “How could I destroy you with a rose?

He was ready to dispatch the monster with a spell, when a devil’s snare entangled him and dragged him to the ground.
Prince Draco looked at his human hands in surprise and then back up to the crowd, searching for only one person. “Harry,” he said. Harry, in his confusion, bowed. The prince furrowed his brow then laughed and gently put his hands on either side of Harry’s face and raised him back up to his feet. “Harry,” he said again, “you have saved me.  You have shown me what it means to truly love, and be loved in return.” And he drew him into a soft kiss.
One day dawned cold and clear, and Harry said, “It would be a good day for flying if I had a broom.”  He gave the beast a playful look, and the beast crouched down, spreading his

His face is tilted up, looking at something not shown in the image.  His eyes are tense behind his glasses.  His scar shows on his forehead where his bangs are pushed aside.]
His glittering scales were melting off his form like butterflies in flight, revealing a smaller form underneath- a human form.
But as he left, he swore he would come back for Harry as soon as he recovered.
[Image description- close up of Harry’s face, turning to look back over his shoulder, his mouth slightly open in surprise and alarm.]
The beast gazed up at him and said in a wondering voice, “You came back.”  Harry choked back a sob as he took in the beast’s injuries, and returned, “Of course I came back, you great berk.”  The sparks of curses sizzling into the shield charm around them registered dimly in Harry’s mind as the beast said softly, “I’m glad I got to see you one last time ...so I could tell you ...that I love you.”
“My godfather is unwell and I must take him home with me. Please let us go.”  But the beast replied with a sneer, “He has trespassed on my land, why should I not keep him here as my prisoner?”  Harry thought quickly.  “Let him go, and I will remain in his place.”
“Alright,” said Sirius, “Stand back.  These wards are only meant to repel humans.”   He shifted into the form of a large black dog, and after flinging his full weight against the door several times, was able to jar it open and destroy the spells.  He raced into the woods, tracking the mob, and Harry rushed after him.
Sirius Black was angry that the townspeople wouldn’t help him rescue Harry, but he remained undeterred.
Harry knew immediately that his decision had been rash, once he looked around and realized he had no supplies to face the dangers of the forest.
Ashamed of his monstrous form, the beast concealed himself inside his castle with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world. The rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose, which would bloom until his twenty-first year. If he could learn to love another, and earn their love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time. As the years passed, he fell into despair, and lost all hope, for who could ever learn to love a beast?
for a farewell gift, Harry told him, “Thank you for understanding how much he means to me.”
Let’s get you back to the castle.”
And the beast could think of nothing to say in reply because the pain he felt was too great.
[Image description- a wide view showing the forest and a path winding through it, which Harry and the beast are walking on.  They are walking away from the viewer, and seen in silhouette side by side.  The beast’s tail and wings droop sadly along the ground as he tags along slightly after Harry.]
We all heard him raving like a lunatic about a beast who lives in a castle!”
“If no one will help me, I’ll go back myself,” he muttered as he packed his gear.   Sirius had always been a little reckless, and he shouldered his pack and headed into the forest thinking only of his godson, heedless of his own safety and the dangers that awaited him.
“You’re not going anywhere,” Harry replied through his tears. But even as he spoke, the beast’s eyes had already rolled back and his breathing stopped.  Harry wept against him saying, “Wait! It’s not fair! I love you too...” And inside the glass case, the last petal fell off the rose.
But Harry assured him quietly that once Sirius was safely away, he himself should have no great difficulty in defending himself if necessary.
brandishing the mirror.
[Image description- close up of the face of a roaring wolf-like monster with horns on its head.  It is covered in fur and its mouth is gaping open to show its sharp teeth and long tongue.]
Show them the beast!” The mirror sparked to life and the crowd gasped in horror as the image of the terrifying beast filled its silver frame.
Finally, Harry broke
the silence. “Thank you Draco.  For saving my life.”  The beast looked at him directly and said, “you’re welcome.”
to Sirius’ side straight away.
A mist arose about the beast and bore him up into the air, and Harry slid from where he was leaning against the beast’s chest down to look up at him in amazement.
Not The-Boy-Who-lived ... just Harry ... and he still cares about me.
[Image description- a young man with short, fair hair is floating in the air on his back as though suspended in water, his head back and his eyes shut.  There is brilliant light all around him and he glows with it.]
[Image description- Madam Umbridge stands behind Harry with her hand tightly gripping his shoulder and a crazed look in her eyes.  Harry looks back at her in disgust and alarm.]
But the beast made no move to attack.
He trudged on quietly, but it wasn’t long before he heard the snarling of a warg pursuing him.
He commanded the magic mirror to

He laid his chest upon the beast’s back and felt the rhythmic beating of their hearts match up.
[Image description- Harry’s booted feet are visible as they walk along the floor with the edge of his cloak covering his legs above. The boots could be leather, they sit above the ankle and have many straps and buckles fastening them.]
Back in town, Sirius burst into the local pub, begging for help to rescue Harry from the beast.
The beast narrowed his eyes.  “It doesn’t make sense, to be willing to do anything for someone.” he returned.

Sirius grudgingly agreed it was the only way, as he was exhausted and injured from his confinement.
in return.
The warg stood over him, growling in triumph and ready to strike. Harry could only brace himself for the blow.
The beast watched the approaching mob from a
She simpered at him, “Oh this is a dreadful business Harry, and I think I could use my influence to help your poor godfather, if only you would see reason and agree to support me.  I’d even give you an important government post.”  Harry snarled, “I don’t want a post in any government run by you, and Sirius isn’t insane!”
As the spell undid itself completely, the castle was bathed in a warm sunrise glowing golden and yellow, changing the dark and cold interior to one of warmth and light. Then, the townspeople’s minds were cleared of the enchantment and they remembered their young prince, now grown to manhood, standing before them. “It’s the prince!  Prince Draco is alive!” they exclaimed and fell to their knees as Madam Umbridge looked on in shock.

The forest that bordered the village was dark and vast, and inhabited by dangerous creatures. Most people avoided it at all costs, but Sirius had been made odd by his imprisonment, and preferred the trees and wild animals to his fellow villagers. He liked to go into the woods for hours at a time, but was careful always to be home by nightfall. He was wandering off the beaten path one day, when he realized he’d lost track of the time and the daylight was disappearing. When he made to turn back, he found the way blocked by a thick and ominous looking hedge that he could not recall seeing before. Unable to find his bearings and with night closing in around him, he began to look for shelter.
