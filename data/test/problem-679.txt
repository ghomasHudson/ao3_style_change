“Well done.” Harry beams, slightly out of breath. Draco can feel Harry’s chest rising and falling against his own. He can feel Harry’s body, all of him, beneath his own body and it’s too much and not enough all at once. Draco pulls back.
"We're cleared for surveillance now, and entry if we spot any sign of him." Luna piles her hair on the top of her head in a loose bun, which she holds in place with two wooden chopsticks. "I'll work on the house's layout and our positioning."
Carys nods, but she’s still looking through the window, out toward the sea crashing onto the beach and the tall landmark in the distance.
Draco’s fingers wrapped tightly around Harry’s and he smiled back, slow, and then stretching out into forever.
Potter raises his eyebrows, but his lips twitch at the corners, just a little. “What an incredible coincidence,” he says dryly. “What kind of trip?”
“At fixing things,” Harry said. Malfoy blinked. Something in his eyes went sort of soft, and from that moment on Harry would never be able to think of him as anything other than human, and ever-changing, and breakable.
It’s just that Granger comes loaded with a lot of baggage he’d rather forget, and doesn’t know quite how to deal with now. He’s apologized to a few people, since the war, with varying degrees of reception, but he’s never been able to bring himself to apologize to her. To bring up the time he’d watched her screaming and bleeding on the floor of his drawing room. She’s warmed to him, over the years they’ve worked together, from painful politeness to cautious friendliness.
Draco’s not a First Team Responder, but it hardly matters right now. Alarms are only rung for very serious emergencies: large-scale hostile takeovers, city fires, terror attacks.
It was a strange way of looking at marriage, Harry thought. Too cold for him, too pragmatic. Too neat, somehow. “I don’t know what I’m doing, to be honest,” he suddenly confessed. “I don’t— I wasn’t supposed to
Potter sounds so tired. “Work. Ginny— you know we broke up last year? Yeah, it was all over the damned papers. This house.” He throws a look over his shoulder, then turns back to the rather gloomy garden. “Sometimes it feels like the only thing I’ve done right is dying.”
“Malfoy.” Potter rubs the bridge of his nose. “I’ll see what I can do.” He looks at Draco for a moment, and then past him. They can hear the train pulling in on the platform below, slowing down until the doors slide open and people start to get off, and then more people on again. Coming and going, coming and going. Draco thinks about going often, truth be told.
“Of course.” He tugs, affectionate, at the ends of her red hair. “Jars of it. Won’t taste exactly the same, probably. Different location, different flowers.”
Harry looks up, into the face he’d once memorized, and still knew, somehow. “There’s something to be said for timing, I guess.”
feels vaguely threatening again, a tenuous, reversible kind of promise. He hasn’t felt like this since the War ended.
Potter does, and it only takes one more stop at a hardware shop on the way back, plus shelling out about a hundred quid, to purchase some peace and good will. Not a bad deal, in Draco’s opinion.
Draco’s heavy breaths were starting to slow. “It only took us six Christmases,” he said, and his voice was all rough and dark and unpracticed, and Harry closed his eyes on the unexpected jolt of love and want and hunger that surged through his body. He turned his head just a little until he could press his mouth against Malfoy’s cheek.
“Guess we’ll have to do something else, then,” Potter whispers. He stretches his face up, and when his teeth close over the edge of Draco’s ear, he lets his breath out in a hot, uneven rush. Something about Potter’s touch always gets him worked up, and fast, like waking from a deep sleep too quickly, and just as disorienting.
,” Draco interrupts, and his father’s eyes flash dangerously. “It sometimes seems to me that you’ve forgotten who lost the War. And how close we were to losing a lot more.”
“I wasn’t, either,” Draco finds himself saying, and he isn’t sure why. Dudley reminds him a little bit of Greg; he can see where a bully might once have taken up all the space inside him, and he can also see that someone else had taught him how to be one.
“Good,” she says. “With confessions from McLaggen and Tom Evers, and with Pansy’s statement, we’ve got a very tight case. I’m expecting convictions for both, and the full sentencing, at least for Warrington.”
It was explosive, this meeting in the middle. This crashing into each other. Wet mouths and teeth pressing into each other’s necks and lips. Fingers pulling at hair and clothing. Malfoy let his head fall back against the bricks behind him, and Harry rested his forehead at the base of his throat. Malfoy’s hand slowed its up and down, pulling deeply, steadily.
Draco tries to pay attention to the news of the court as his father relates it, but his eyes are drawn repeatedly to the elaborate—and alarmingly high—coil of braids and fabric perched atop Pansy’s head. The headpiece is black velvet, with pearls sewn in. It matches her black velvet dress and the strands of pearls curling around her thin, pale neck like an extraordinarily expensive rope with which to hang herself.
In his room at the hotel, Harry pulls a miniature portrait framed in tarnished brass from an inside pocket of his bag. He sets it on the dresser and sits on the end of the bed. The corner of the mattress sinks under his weight and he curls his bare toes into the plush of the carpet underneath them.
Potter smiles all crooked, his eyes crinkling in the corners and his teeth showing. His whole face smiles.
Draco’s heart swells. Hope is such a strange feeling—it feels like pleasure and pain all wrapped together. “Sounds like a marriage.”
“We need you to disappear for awhile,” continues Kingsley. “Take you off the game board. It will confuse them, and also alleviate one of our concerns.”
Gray light breaking in striations of gold and the palest lavender over the Thames below. The winding stretch of concrete high rises on this side of the bank, the thick panel of glass forming one wall of his living room. London teeming outside, gleaming stainless steel and blank walls inside his flat. He breathes, the steam rising off his tea and up into his face; malty Assam, tinge of bergamot. He breathes, and imagines the hush coming in through his nose, of quiet circling in tendrils through his veins. The floor tiles are cool and smooth beneath the soles of his feet and so is he; swept bare each morning, made new with every press of dawn’s fingers. He is the thing which he builds fresh every day— layer of soft white cotton underneath, and then stiff white linen against the throat, unrelieved black of the wool uniform on top, darkness all the way from collar to polished boots.
“But you wouldn’t have heard his views on the Ministry, then,” Potter says. “Anyway, if Warrington’s out, maybe we can do a bit of snooping.”
Trophies gathering dust in an empty school and the faded memory of a crowd’s roar like the faint sound of a seashell pressed to the ear.
Blaise raised his eyebrows. “Ah, yes. And there’s nothing like that in the Wizarding world, of course.”
Malfoy knocked back the rest of the whiskey in his glass. “Pansy ended up going to France. She couldn’t go anywhere here without people calling her—“ he trailed off. “Names.”
Pansy, as always, seems to bloom under direct attention. “Don’t be coy, darling. We’ve known each other much too long for that. I can see why you find him so—“ She pauses archly. “—engaging.”
Hermione narrowed her eyes at him, but—reluctantly—dropped it. “I spoke to Jebediah Lockwood, the warden at Azkaban. Malfoy is alive. He went and checked himself, on my insistence.”
Draco nods. “It’s a high stress profession, I imagine,” he offers carefully, surprised to be included in a confidence of any kind, secret or not. Potter flashes him a quick smile and goes back to his pie.
“Yeah.” Potter looks at him a little strangely. “You can’t go too wrong with pizza, really, but the place around the corner does a really good one.”
“Pansy,” says Potter now, rubbing her hand between his and leaning toward her. “We’ll take you somewhere safe. I promise you. I’ll take you there myself.”
“I know so little about you.” Draco watches Harry closely. “Where are you from? What did you do before you came here?”
Draco sucks his top lip in, holds it between his teeth. He wonders if Blaise would be more careful, if he could go back. If he knew then what he knows now. Draco wonders if that’s why some wizards were so adamantly against divination. If we all knew every bad end, would we ever take any chances at all?
“Well, look,” she gestures with one hand, a kind of wave around her head. “This kind of mess is just not attractive on a younger witch, but it’s fantastic at my age. I’ve finally grown into it. Maybe a mole on my chin—“ She breaks off with a grin as he starts laughing, deep chuckles from down in his belly.
“Her family offered my father a portion of their lands in exchange for money. Pansy was the pretext. She’s the only child, but her father is giving the estate to a nephew instead. As you can imagine, the betrothal was not a happy one for her.”
“Everything is always about you, isn’t it, Potter?” Malfoy interrupted. “Have you never considered that not everyone wants you for a saviour?”
He feels like he’s suffocating. Like the library is a tomb and someone is throwing dirt on top of it. The fire is blazing and there are too many people inside this room, people he’s seen eating off his mother’s silver and also kneeling in the dirt before the Dark Lord, clamoring to be his best dog. He’d seen some of them do unspeakable things. He’d heard more of them say casually terrible things. There is a particular dissonance in his head, like two incongruous images being shuffled over and over behind his eyes until they begin to blend into one. Like he can’t trust which one is the present.
They meet in front of the restaurant, a little Muggle place, because Harry is feeling rather sentimental. It’s a Friday night, and there’s a line at the door, so they linger near the end of it, their bodies close and so very aware of each other.
Warrington turns toward him. “Purebloods. Families with long, distinguished lines like yours, Sayre. Our control has been loosened in other Ministry avenues; we should try and get finger-holds in wherever we can. Don’t you agree, Draco?”
Draco stares at him, and Potter reaches slowly and takes his arm, pulling his hand away from his body and turning it so that his wrist is held up between them. Potter pushes at his sleeve, pushes it up his forearm until it’s all wadded up around his elbow. When Draco looks down, the remnants of his Dark Mark are clear on his skin between them. It’s a pale gray, the outlines smudged. Some days he even forgets it’s there, for a while, until he flips on the light in the kitchen or dries himself off after a shower. Like a ghost, it haunts his arm.
There is the briefest of seconds, the slightest tremble of an eyelash worth of time, when Rowle sees his curse coming, and his eyes widen. When Draco slices through his shield like a knife through the thinnest paper. A flicker of surprise. Draco has come to cherish that surprise, from dark wizards and colleagues and random strangers on the street. It feeds him, some days; he drinks deeply from the place he keeps it, the dark well inside him.
When it’s nearly dark he stands up and takes his now empty glass to the kitchen. Leaning over the sink, he looks out the little window to the back, where an old, crumbling stone wall runs around a small patch of green. Toward the back there’s a hedge of anemic-looking roses growing, and some scrubby vines that cling to the stone and reach sad fingers over the top. There are a few flower pots on the patio, but they’re empty except for a pile of cigarette butts from the previous tenant.
The door creaks as it swings open. “Lumos,” he says, and feels Potter walk in behind him. He shuts the door after himself.
“Was it worth it?” Draco asks, and he’s walking a careful line now. “The woman who died? The dragon you maimed?” Draco moves a little closer, on an angle, the glass of the walls all around them getting closer. “Was it worth betraying the woman you loved, and both of your dead families, just to get at Iwan?”
Blaise is scrolling down an Ebay page on his lap computer, feet up on the big oak desk that takes up most of the wall where the bank of windows are— windows that remain closed, curtains and shutters drawn. He’s still the only wizard that Draco knows who uses a computer, or the small rectangles that work like a Floo call. He looks up at the sound of Draco’s knuckles rapping against the doorframe and waves him in.
His own arm finds its way around Harry’s waist, a fist against his back. Draco can feel Harry’s muscles bunching up underneath his jacket as he presses in closer.
“Oh.” The sun is almost out of sight, just a fiery trail of orange and pink left along the horizon, purple-dark dusk falling heavy over top.
Weasley sits down on the edge of his mattress instead. “So you live above a bar now? Why aren’t you at the Manor, being catered to by house elves? You’d at least smell better.”
For someone who’s done absolutely nothing besides raise a bottle to his lips for weeks, he feels so very, very tired. “What’s it matter, Weasley?”
He wonders how long it would take to swim until he couldn’t see land at all anymore. He wonders how that would feel.
They sit there for awhile, and the fireflies come out, and some frogs start to sing far off somewhere, low and melancholy.
She leans over to take a mouthful of her soup, and as her hand hovers midair the entire structure trembles atop her head. Any moment it will escape its confines and fall into her bowl. Draco glances at the back wall, where Regulus and Harry’s eyes are both glued to Pansy’s hair as well. A faint smile creeps onto her face. Finally, she takes a careful sip from her spoon and sits back again. Hair still in place.
Draco’s chest was so tight. His eyes were stinging. “I don’t know,” he said. The words poured out him. “I feel like I don’t know
“But smaller,” says Blaise. “And portable. You just carry it around with you and listen with the headphones. They’re dead cheap to get, and the discs even cheaper, because Muggles barely use them anymore.”
“If I want the opinion of a stuck-up society Death Eater, I’ll be sure to ask your mum,” he said. It felt nastier than he’d intended, hanging in the air after it left his mouth.
“What do you think she was thinking?” he asks roughly, echoing the question Blaise always asks him. Like other people were such a mystery; like the mystery meant something.
“Maybe,” says Draco. “Anyway, I should go. Save me one of the new ones, yeah? I’ll pay gallery price.”
“How did you do it?” Draco pressed on. “How did you make a life and— and make relationships with people that matter?”
He sees the little girl jump off the last step and into the kitchen, then sidle up to her mother. “Run up to the sanctuary,” Carys says, cupping the girl’s cheek with her palm. “Tell your da to come.”
“I was about to take tea with him, Mr. Potter. Now I think maybe you should take my place. He’s waiting in the conservatory.” She smiles at him, finally; it feels like a spring thaw. “You do remember the way, don’t you?”
“What I don’t want is to be sold like cattle for the good of my family estate,” Pansy interrupts. “That’s already happened. What I don’t want is to be denied the ruling of my estate because I am a woman. I would have been good at it. Much better than my fool of a cousin.”
The gin was weighing Harry down —making his limbs heavy and his brain slow and all his veins warm and pulsing through his body— and Malfoy looked so
But telling himself not to think about Potter was like telling a starving man not to think about food. No amount of wishful thinking could deter a decade’s worth of obsession.
Draco healed the ankle with a quick spell; he’d mended about a thousand ankles in training, and bone work had always come to him naturally. The thigh would be easy as well, but he’d have to repair the muscle and skin afterward, which tended to be a bit more difficult postmortem.
I stop and wrap one hand around his throat, smirking down at him. His pulse thumps beneath my fingers. He tries to kiss me again, but I pull my face out of his reach.
—but when he opened his eyes, the body, shrouded beneath it’s macabre white sheet, stubbornly remained, appearing even more stark and stiff than it had before. Too real.
He preferred to save his emotional breakdowns for the shower, where he could pretend that the wetness in his eyes had been caused by the spray. It was a ridiculous game he played with himself, as he lived alone and had no cause for subterfuge, but feigning serenity was the only way he knew how to survive.
He opens my fly, and I breathe easier now that I’m not bending to the iron will of my zipper. Hot fingers wrap around me and begin to pump a slow rhythm.
Draco went still, holding his breath. Hope. He’d never given the word much thought before, which seemed strange seeing as how hope had sustained him through the darkest times of his life.
Sighing, Draco scooped out some more salve with his pinky and dotted it on Potter’s cheek. “I’ll spend some extra time working on your face tomorrow morning to make sure you’re presentable. Anything the Skin Restorer can’t fix, I’ll hide with a glamour. Sometimes the Restorer has trouble healing cuts when the skin is ... not alive. It’ll seal it, but it leaves a mark.”
His legs are wrapped around my hips, and I rummage around on the floor till I find my wand. Tipping his knees to his chest, I perform a simple lubrication charm and smile at his ragged inhale. The chill feel of slickness makes his dick twitch toward me. Once my length is lubed, I waste no time. His fingers dig into my upper arms as I press my weeping tip to his opening.
He went back to the grey form, noting all injuries he saw, then set aside the chart and cast a quick diagnostic at the leg. A ghostly recreation of Harry’s appendage appeared in the air above it and slowly split into layers, revealing that the break had been clean through the femur and, lower down, through the tibia; the fibula was hanging on by the skin of its teeth.
Jamming the ends into his ears, he ran back over to Harry and pressed the circular diaphragm to his chest. Draco held his breath, listening as hard as he could. A lethargic, but undeniable, beat thumped in his ears, and Draco’s eyes locked with Harry’s. “Bloody hell, you’re alive.”
Harry’s lips moved, and Draco knew his name when he saw it. Leaning down, he put his ear next to Harry’s mouth so he could hear. “Yeah?”
I don’t have to listen to this. The door handle slips through my fingers as I try to get out. His hand grips my shoulder, trying to turn me back around.
“There,” he said to himself. “I’ll just get the Skin Restorer and start wrapping you up. You should be back to your old self by the morning.” He stopped short, realizing what he’d just said. “I mean, your skin—the wounds should be mostly healed.”
At least Draco assumed that was what had happened to him. He appeared fairly easygoing in the papers. The Chosen One gave few interviews, always brushing off the reporters with a small smile, as if he found their interest vaguely silly. He didn’t get upset when the paparazzi snapped his picture outside his house or followed him to restaurants. Nothing seemed to faze him anymore. Not the papers. Not the fans. Not even his stressful job.
Never again would he leave himself open to such pain. There was too much risk when other people were involved. If he wanted to survive, he’d have to go it alone, because he couldn’t take another loss like this. It would kill him.
“I always wanted a car like this when I was a kid. Bloke down the street had one just like it. Aunt Petunia though it was horrible, but I thought it was brilliant,” he continues, petting the hood in a manner that can only be described as sexual.
But all the world demanded a piece of Harry Potter; they all wanted to believe they knew him, that he was their close, personal friend. The mass delusion that Potter belonged to the people justified their invasion of his privacy.
With a sharp snap the thread ripped, and for a second, Draco stared at it, startled by the loss. He’d needed something to focus on. A lifeline. It felt as if he’d been betrayed by that bit of useless string. Disgusted with himself, and the unreliable tensile strength of the hospital bedding, he dropped it and frisked the sheet’s edge, seeking out the torn end. But unable to see through his tears, he was forced to abandon the search in favor of finding his nose-blowing towel.
His roll of gauze ran out, so Draco crouched down and rummaged around the cart’s lower shelf for more. “I guess you know all about wondering whom you can trust, don’t you? Is that why you frequent so many Muggle establishments?” He popped up and gave Potter a little smirk. “You were trying to meet men who didn’t know you were famous, weren’t you? I can understand that. I’m thinking about going on holiday someplace where no one’s ever heard of me. I need a clean slate.”
“Shit!” Stumbling over his own feet, Malfoy ran to the supply cupboard and started tearing items off the shelves, searching behind rows of beakers and specimen jars for an object he hadn’t seen in over five years—but he could swear was still in there.
I pause, mulling over his confession. My cock is obviously pleased with the idea, but I’m still angry about being kidnapped and tortured. He doesn’t sound repentant enough. “What makes you think I’d stoop to such a muggle cliche?”
Now here he sat, in broad daylight, bawling in St. Mungo’s cellar like a little girl. Because of Harry fucking Potter. Christ! Even in death that bastard could make him look like a fool.
“What do I think?!” I know I’m yelling, but I can barely hear myself over my racing heart (or that infernal motor). “I think you’re a bloody mental patient!” I cup the bulge of his crotch just to prove my point; he’s as hard as I suspected.
After twenty minutes of constant chanting and mind-numbing concentration, Draco’s forehead glistened with sweat and his mouth was so dry it felt as if he’d been sucking on a cotton ball. His muscles trembled from the prolonged exertion, and when the cramp in his shoulder got so bad he couldn’t lift his arm for the next pass, he knew he’d have to call for backup.
His grin makes my stomach flip. Before I can understand what’s happening, he’s pinning my back to the side of the car and yanking my trousers down out of his way. I’m slumped in surprise at how fast he moves. His face presses to my cock, and I feel his tongue swirling around the tip before he sucks me into his mouth. Merlin’s balls! This is going to finish me if I’m not careful. Tangling my fingers into his messy black hair, I force him closer and jerk up to meet his lips. He isn’t intimidated. The hand that isn’t fisted around my shaft starts tugging at my balls, and I feel them tighten threateningly. How does he do this to me? My control is already slipping away.
“It’s not the road I’m worried about,” I counter. The road will be fine. I’m more concerned with our ability to remain on it. Intact. Images of us roasting in a fiery heap of twisted metal flash through my head. I’m too young (and pretty) to die like this. Is a modicum of caution too much to ask? His roving hand works it’s way higher, and my cock stirs. It seems completely oblivious to the threat we’re under. Traitor. This damn silk isn’t the least bit concealing.
The tiny smile on his lips worries me. Is he so numb to danger? He takes us out to the country. When we get on straight stretch of road, he slams the car into gear again, and we pick up even more speed.
Something touched the side of his hand, and Draco glanced down to see Harry’s fingers coming to life, reaching out for him. Malfoy turned his palm up, open and welcoming, and shifted his hand over in an upside-down handshake.
“Would you relax. This car has every spell the Ministry could throw at it. We’re not going to get hurt.”
And maybe that was why he felt so adrift that he couldn’t catch his breath. The person he’d most wanted to prove himself to had gone. It wasn’t that he needed the praise or attention; he just wanted someone to see him for who he was, who he’d become. Potter, of all people, would see how much he’d changed, and he’d understand why. Because the war had changed Potter, too.
Jeans tangled at his hips, Harry bucks against me. I know he’s close, but I refuse to let him come yet. He owes me.
With a smoothing swipe, he pressed the tape over the gauze and scanned Harry’s torso for further injuries. Finding none, he reluctantly moved above the neck. He’d been avoiding those cuts, dreading the idea of being face to face with a death he wasn’t ready to accept.
Strong fingers squeeze around me, and I have to close my eyes to keep control. He can NOT just drag me to the middle of the forest and expect us to shag in the back of a dilapidated old jalopy. I do have standards. His fingers start to unzip me, and he leans closer.
Rebuilding his reputation and finding his own way had taught him a great many things about what kind of person he wanted to be, but what really kept him going, what gave him the energy to tackle his shortcomings and overhaul his life, that was all Harry. Harry-hope.
When he calmed down, he cleaned himself up and leaned his head back against the wall, studying the ceiling so he didn’t have to look at the body.
For a second, Draco’s crying swerved to a deranged laugh, the madness clawing for a foothold. He could just see Potter on his broom, glancing over his shoulder one last time and grinning when he realized he had Draco beat. A final win.
“I’m not getting in that thing! It looks as though it could blow up any minute! Cars do that, you know.”
It had all been make-believe, an imaginary world where he lived happily ever after with his boyfriend, a boyfriend who found him irresistible and funny, who loved him even when he messed up, who saw past the scar on his arm. That was a lot to ask, but Draco needed someone to counterbalance all the self-loathing and doubt he battled on a daily basis. He needed someone full of goodness to remind him what life was really about. And who else but the amazing Harry Potter had enough light to outshine the monsters of Draco’s shadowy past?
Draco breathed in deeply, and the heat flushing his face drained to clammy relief. Thank Merlin no one had seen that. Only rookies gagged, and being the most senior mediwizard in the morgue, everyone expected him to be the coolest.
“Is this for me or the car?” I sneer and yank my hand away. His grin falters, hurt flickering through his eyes.
The world passes us in a blur, and I have to grip the door handle to stay in my seat. “Slow down! Have you gone mad?”
But finding Potter under that sheet had been a shock. The kind of shock that could leave a wizard confined to the Janus Thickey ward for the rest of his life.
“Oh gods,” Draco breathed. His head spun, too stunned to think. “Blink twice if you can understand me.”
Draco had to stop and wipe his eyes. When he could see again, he looked Harry up and down, wanting to reach out to him, but the closest he could manage was the edge of the sheet, his frozen fingers trembling against the white cotton.
Part of him wished he was still naïve enough to care what colors someone wore and what common room they called home. Ignorance really could be bliss. But living in the real world was a far cry from Hogwarts. His tribe no longer wore Slytherin green; they wore St. Mungo’s lime. And the only colors he cared about were the color-coded forms he had to fill out in triplicate for each body.
His heart felt both too fast and too heavy in his chest. He rubbed at it with one hand, urging it to slow with the power of his mind. Perhaps if he concentrated on keeping his heart beating at a normal rate, his thoughts wouldn’t stray into such morbid territory.
What he needed was some real reality, someone who could help him forget himself for a moment. A lover. Or just a quick shag. He needed the physical touch of sex to feel human, but he didn’t dare become too intimate. Not now. There could be weakness in wanting something too much.
Dressed in only his boxers, Potter looked even more broken and sad. The wounds stood out in high relief, disturbingly stark against the chalky skin. Draco’s stomach gave another little hop, but, thankfully, nothing tried to escape.
“I’m really sorry, Harry,” Draco rasped. “You didn’t deserve to die like this. I mean, maybe you didn’t mind dying in the line of duty, doing what you felt you had to, but, after everything you’ve been through, you deserved more. Something good. A family. Love. I don’t know what you wanted, but it should have been yours.”
Harry replied wearily, "I'm tired of fighting. Voldemort is dead, why prolong the war?" He paused when he noticed that Malfoy flinched when he said "Voldemort." Harry added, "You shouldn't be scared. He's not coming back, you know.
He hadn’t quit shaking since the second line. Logically, Draco knew that he wasn’t going to get in trouble at work: other people had shown up on meth before. Draco quit drumming his fingers on his legs and threw his glass across the kitchen.
.          Malfoy’s mouth fell open as he pondered how to reply. Harry cringed a bit. Andromeda kept repeating herself. Teddy whined for Harry to pick him up; he didn’t seem to like this stranger. Finally, Malfoy straightened his back and looked Andromeda in the eyes.
“Eh. I think that Pansy’s neutral about most things.” Draco turned to the sales assistant and pointed to tear-drop shaped, diamond earrings. “Can I view those?” He observed the earrings for a few minutes, then asked, “Is there a matching necklace?’
Thank you for reading! I can't believe I picked up this four year old fic, but I really enjoyed getting back into it. Special thanks to iessoardin, who encouraged me. This is a short chapter, but the story is just about to pick up!
Harry smiled as his best friends spoke about their careers and studies and, well, lives. At some point, he felt a spark of envy. Then, he felt guilty. It wasn't their fault that he didn't know what to do. He was tired of feeling confused. What did he want to do for the rest of his life?
They continued to talk about Ginny’s career for a few minutes until she finally asked, “So, what about you?”
Draco took a sip of coffee, unsuccessfully disguising his reluctance to answer with dehydration. He commented, “I don’t know.”
The days passed by and it was 8 AM on Halloween. Harry hadn’t slept well and had been going in and out of consciousness since 1 AM. Finally, he decided to get up and make coffee. He put on a hoodie, turn the coffee pot on, and escaped outside for a cigarette.
By the time half the presents were opened, almost everyone had received what Harry had gotten them. The only gifts that Harry had left to hand out were the ones for Narcissa and Draco.
This year was apparently different. Harry loved Hogwarts, but he didn’t see why everyone was so arsed to get his opinion. Other members of the DA would also be there, but he supposed that that was a given. The conference was also a feast, and it was somewhat open to the public.
Harry was cut off by Andromeda’s sudden hug. She had put her wooden spoon down and turned the heat on the stove down to “low.”
I know that it has been a while since I have written, but I need to talk to you two. It’s very important. Could you show up for breakfast at 9? Teddy has wanted to see you both anyways. Thank you.
A couple minutes later, the door sang again. Ron, Hermione, and the Grangers entered. Soon enough, everyone had filed through the door. Harry went over to greet Ginny and Luna.
It was always great to have Narcissa come early because she liked to make herself busy. The first few times that she visited, Harry wondered why she helped out. After all, she'd lived her entire life with house elves at her disposal. As of late, however, Harry's come to the realization that Narcissa was now working as a waitress at a muggle restaurant. Like Harry, she used work to distract herself from her grief.
Harry cursed under his breath. This really was not going how he wanted it to. He asked, “Well, you have problems sleeping, right?”
“I know. Addressing all of these respectively, Draco, we’re different people now than we were during Hogwarts. Yeah, we basically hated each other, but that doesn’t mean we do now. It also doesn’t mean that our relationship now will be unhealthy.
"Well, I've been rather all right. Currently I'm a trainee healer for the Appleby Arrows. They reckon I'll be ready to work full-time by September," Dean said.
“Listen, Potter. I don’t know why you’re here nor what you wanted,” Malfoy whisper-screamed, “as you have the whole of the wizarding world in your pocket-“
Draco was making mental notes of what the two were ordering—simple drinks, really, so Draco didn’t know why he was so nervous when Potter suddenly added, “Three martinis.”
.          “Yes, well, I thought that it was still important to establish bilingualism in him, regardless of his blood status,” Andromeda replied. She smiled warmly at Draco. He was so fucking stupid.
“Ouch! You stupid, bloody bird. Get out of here! Go on! Fuck off!” Draco screamed at it. He glanced at his finger and threw the mail in the garbage.
After trying to steady himself for a few minutes, he retrieved his coffee mug and walked over to the couch. He sat down and opened yesterday’s copy of the Manchester Evening News. This was traditional for Draco. Every night, after work, he would take a copy home just before attempting to drift asleep. In the morning, he would reread it while drinking his coffee. Ever since he was a kid, he was always interested in muggle news and history. Something forbidden like sneaking off to read a muggle publication just filled him with adrenaline. At Hogwarts, he would steal a book, magazine, or newspaper from one of the Slytherin half-bloods. Then he’d store it in his room, reading it by wand-light while everyone else slept. On occasion, he would forget he had it and accidentally bring the copy home. The house-elves would find it in his school supplies and turn it over to his father, who would promptly punish him severely. Sometimes, he’d be beaten with his father’s cane while others would involve a short-term crucio. Other times, though he would hide the books underneath a secret, loose floorboard. He relished reading that precious literature—those prizes—alone at night. He even had a few of them still.
I have great news! The Harpies want me on their team. Can I share the details with you over lunch? I have so much to tell you about!
He groaned and looked at the clock again. Not even three minutes had passed. There was no way he could go to training like this. When he went yesterday, he had confused the Ebublio Jinks with the Biting Jinks, accidentally causing Ron’s textbook to latch onto his arm. It took ten minutes for the professor to calm Ron down enough to get the book off. Harry didn’t want that to happen again, but he had also missed the 1
Harry interjected, "And seeker. She's pretty much good at everything because of the competitions with her brothers."
Draco was smiling. He spoke again, “I never questioned my father’s rhetoric at all until I was thirteen. It was at that time that I…I started to question my sexuality. Of course, being a number of
The waiter arrived with their drinks and took their orders. When he left, Draco asked, “So, what had the Boy Who Lived been up to before university?”
Harry begrudgingly got out of bed. He wanted to fix turkey for dinner, so he decided that he might as well go ahead and begin. Following the steps that he so often took, he walked out of his room, fixed coffee, and walked outside to smoke.
“Harry James Potter,” Andromeda started, placing her pizza slice on her plate and forcing eye contact between them, “you are anything but weak.”
“Yes,” Harry said, giggling again. He put his right hand under Draco’s chin and met his eyes.  Draco tangled his fingers in Harry’s hair. They moved closer to each other until they were breathing the same air. Harry felt hot Carbon dioxide meet cold oxygen and he closed his eyes. He felt Draco’s lips on his and deepened the kiss, occasionally sucking Draco’s bottom lip. They continued like that for a few minutes until they pulled away, breathless.
.          That’s when the crying began. His entire body shook as the violent sobs rippled through his body. He clenched his teeth and started rubbing his hands on the thighs of his pants. He felt his chest grow tighter as his breaths got deeper and quicker. He lay down on the floor, feeling sorry for himself. Draco willed himself into dissociation, “Come on. Come on. Come on, Draco. Get up. Get over it. Just...
Harry pulled away from the kiss, then looked to his left where Halloween was devouring a velociraptor. Draco and Harry burst into laughter.
“How about this?” Draco asked Harry. He was holding a sterling silver charm bracelet that held three charms: a heart, an owl, and a snowman. Each of the charms was embroidered with diamonds.

Draco was very confused. In fact, he hadn’t been this confused since third year when he found out he was attracted to an older bloke on Slytherin’s quidditch team. No, this was nothing like questioning his sexuality. He just wanted to know why the bloody hell Harry freakin’ Potter had showed up at The Black Cauldron. Yet there Draco was—serving the bloke and his golden friends alcohol.
angry. She hardly knew him. How the bloody hell did she think that she could make these assumptions about his life when
Potter almost immediately hunched over and vomited on the floor. The Weasel laughed. Longbottom got over and rushed to Potter’s side.
. [I don’t have the time (wrong word used to show lack of Spanish skills) to listen to you (informal use of “you;” meant to disrespect). Sorry. Go to hell/go fuck yourself.]”
Harry’s friends chatted, some of them already slightly tipsy. This was their third bar of the night, and Ginny was definitely crossing the line from “tipsy” to “drunk.” No one seemed to mind except Ron, who had ordered her to get a water.
His therapist warned him that he shouldn’t focus on being “normal:” he should strive to be more optimistic about the “good days.” Harry normally saw Dr. Shelly once or twice a month, but they set up an emergency session on the 3
Sally brushed her fingers through her girlfriend’s afro and smiled sadly. “I personally hope that we’re not going to spend the rest of our lives in bloody Moss Side. I don’t know about you two, but I have different goals.” Draco shrugged. It was a shitty life, true. He hadn’t even had a mattress to sleep on for months, true. And the apartment complex had a new infestation of bed bugs in it every year, also true. Yet he still liked it there: it had its own personality, and he’d finally grown to calling it “home.” He cleared his throat.
.          Malfoy turned his head to make their eyes meet. He was so close that Harry could make out every little vessel in his eye. Malfoy spoke, "Are you daft? I
“Likewise,” Draco sneered. He set the book down on the shelf and wiped his hand on his pants, as if he touched something filthy. Dousselsnorf rolled his eyes, seeing through Draco’s façade.
Harry stood up right as the professor announced, “Hello, class! Please take your seats. We will begin now.” Harry sat back down and placed his bag at his feet. How did he have such rotten luck? Of
“That’s fine,” Harry replied. “You know how he gets after an hour or two of being awake.” Andromeda’s frown deepened, and Harry realized that it was not Teddy that was the reason for her frowning: it was Harry. “What’s wrong, Andromeda?”
.          “Andromeda,” Harry pointed out, chuckling a bit, “He’s practically running off.” They watched as Malfoy’s pace quickened in an attempt to leave the campus. He almost looked like a wild animal feeling a predator. Harry wondered if that’s how he felt.
Harry raised his eyebrows in surprise, then he added, “Isn’t she exiled? How was she able to come here?”
“Attention, class. I will now begin to read off of our syllabus. Our semester will cover World History 111, which means that our studies are roughly the beginning of mankind to the Industrial Revolution…”
The walk to the Black Cauldron wasn’t at all interesting until Draco heard yelling coming from near the parking lot. He sped up, attempting to get a good look at whatever was happening at the bar. He smirked at the sight of police placing Darren in handcuffs.
“Like it? I love it! It’s….” Harry stopped midsentence. He looked at it again, noting the mixture of the deep blues, light blues, whites, greys, and the black. It was elegant and subtle. It was exactly what he wanted. “It’s perfect, Luna.”
“Harry! Are you okay?” Ron asked. He went to hug his friend, but he backed off when Harry groaned in pain.
“Sorry,” the blond force a smile. “I always need a smoke after I eat.” Like Harry, he was carrying a mug filled with coffee.
The following morning, Andromeda bustled around. She was so happy that she hummed as she walked, and was cooking pancakes with magic. Harry couldn’t believe his eyes; he hadn’t seen Andromeda this happy since before Ted and Tonks died. Well, since the second war started.
The blond carefully took off the wrapping paper and ribbon. In the box, there was a sterling silver and white gold watch whose hands had alexandrite on them.
Harry blushed and was saved from replying when Andromeda greeted Draco with a bear-hug and cheek-kiss.
to believe that there’s something in everyone that can still be saved. I can’t give up on the last of my family. Even if Narcissa won’t speak to me, I can still have my nephew.”
“No,” Ron said quizzically. “It’s Obstacle Course Day. Y’know, the day we’ve been waiting for ever since we signed up for training. You haven’t been here for our preparation and review days. Are you sure you’re ready?”
“Er…” mumbled Harry. “He, um…” Harry didn’t have it in him to tell her that her son sported dead hair, a grey and nervous complexion, and a skinny stature. “Well, he…” Harry wanted to comment that Malfoy had worked hard to become sober, but he couldn’t bring himself to admit to Narcissa that the blond was an alcoholic. “I don’t know.” It wasn’t a lie.
“Didn’t you hear me? I’ve been trying to get your attention for several minutes now!” Andromeda said, her voice bordering on confusion and concern.
“Are you okay?” Sally asked. Concern filled her voice, and she moved her hand as if to check his forehead for a fever. At the last second, she must have decided that that was a silly idea because she jerked her hand away. Draco realized that they had never actually touched each other or hugged. He didn’t know why he cared.
They continued their meeting and discussed Draco’s short-term and long-term goals. Draco spoke about maintaining his job, fully furnishing his apartment, going to university, and, most importantly, getting clean. Dousselsnorf seemed less angry than normal, so Draco thought that know was the perfect time to poke the bear.
Harry practically ran to the door, but he had to stop before he opened it so that he could catch his breath. He turned the doorknob and let a smiling Draco in.
Draco made his way back to the door. Before he touched the door knob, he turned around and said, “I’ll consider it.”
It was Draco’s turn to giggle. He then commented, “I wish that we had time to do that stuff when we were teenagers.”
Ron scowled. He replied, “How come I let you convince me to paint this on my face, anyways? Why couldn’t you just charm it on? And why didn’t you put any paint on your face, huh?!”
Harry took a bite of his burger. “Maybe,” He swallowed and replied, “but I doubt I’ll have much time. We do have auror exams in June, and I hear that next year is going to be very difficult. I’ll consider it.”
Draco finished his cigarette, but didn’t go back inside. Harry took the blond’s presence as permission to continue.
He worked on the turkey and smoked until 5AM. At that time, he got out his homework. Because the semester was almost over, an air of tension was spread concerning finals week. Normally, Harry would not have cared yet and would have begun studying a few days before exams; however, all of his professors had assigned final projects that were worth about as much as the exams themselves.
Draco sighed, “Confinement to the country, twenty hours community service per year, atleast part-time employment, weekly check-ins with an officer and an auror, monthly therapy, my wand is checked…all that…”
The night droned on and Harry choked back a strange sense of nervousness. Having Malfoy visit his home wasn’t that big of a deal, was it?
“Holy fucking Merlin,” Draco mutters. “Would you please stop speaking, forever?" He hesitates, digging his fist into an eye socket. “I think— I might need help.”
Once, when Harry was in primary school, his class went on a field trip to a science museum, and they’d each taken a turn touching a static electricity globe. His classmates had all laughed as their hair began to rise and stand on end, and shocked each other afterwards with their lightly charged fingertips. Harry had been entranced with the feeling of something invisible yet impossible to ignore humming and thrumming below his palm, skittering along the back of his hand and up his arm.
Potter smiles, and for a moment Draco forgets to inhale. He is filled in with all the things he wants with Potter, he is messy and distinctly entangled.
Granger tries to send him to the Infirmary, but he can’t leave yet. He’s standing on the other side of the one-way glass, watching Tom Evers, who is slumped at the interview table, waiting to be questioned. His head is bowed, his cuts and scrapes already healed over by the mediwitch Draco waved away. Something roots Draco to this spot, some vague feeling that he might have been Tom Evers once, or in some future that didn’t occur. He wonders if that makes them the same. He wonders what it means, that he understands, somewhere hidden inside his bones, what drove Evers during the long nights he spent alone, on his cot, thinking on all he’d lost or never had at all.
Potter pinched him, right over the ribs. “Shut up. You know what I mean, tosser.” Draco threw his arm off and grabbed him by the shoulders, but Potter pivoted, and pushed, and they ended up falling on top of Potter’s bed in a heap. When he looked up, all he could see was Potter’s face above him: the green of Potter’s eyes and the way his mouth was curved up in a lopsided smile. Potter’s chest rose and fell and pushed against his.
kill Albus Dumbledore. No,” she says sharply when he opens his mouth. “You’re done talking now. Finish your bourbon and then go sleep it off, and when you wake up tomorrow I suggest you start being very honest with yourself.”
Harry decides that it began at that nightclub in Warsaw. The power had failed again across the entire block, but there were wands and maybe a hundred people saying
“It’s almost like you didn’t have her as a professor for seven years,” Potter says, looking at him strangely. “Why do you want to see Snape?”
“Muriel is dead,” he’d said, into the very particular hush that fell inside. He’d waited, and so had the silence. What would happen to the hives, he wondered. Would someone else take the bees? Would they survive on their own?
It was nothing so elegant as fucking, the first time they came together. It was teeth just a little too sharp— against a collarbone, on the right-side curve of a jaw, drawing blood from the plushest part of a bottom lip. It was the doorframe digging into the curve his spine was making of its own volition: closer, harder,
Receiving—a letter, an owl, a pumpkin pasty, a birthday present, a standard size 9 pewter cauldron, a wand, Hogwarts robes, enough to eat, a Weasley sweater.
Dudley waves around another mouthful of pizza, and Potter stands to follow him out of the kitchen. He starts back toward the front door, but Potter stops him.
The sun’s not up yet, but the darkness is beginning to shift from deep ink to a purpled blue. The edges of the beat-up dresser in the corner are slowly turning distinct and in another half an hour he’ll be able to make out Potter’s parents twirling each other around that fountain in the photo framed on its surface. He’s spent the night again, in spite of himself.
He and Ginny were “taking a break” the next time he ran into Malfoy. He’d gone to the Muggle bar because he knew the quidditch game wouldn’t be on there. He didn’t want to think about Ginny, about her long red hair whipping around behind her like a streamer and the flush on her cheeks from the wind and how great the sex was after she won a quidditch match. He didn’t want to think about the ways they didn’t fit together anymore.
Draco opens his mouth, then closes it again. He tries to push down the instinct to feel defensive and just hear what Granger is saying. He thinks about how it must feel, to see the people who championed your inferiority for so long collect the things they’d once sneered at you for now, and for some of them to expect a pat on the back for it.
Draco finally turns. “Potter,” he breathes out, his beautiful, beloved face cracking under the weight of the both of them, here, now. Like two boys breaking all the porcelain in a fancy tea shop. He brings his hand up and wraps it around the back of Harry’s neck, his face leaning down until their foreheads are touching. His hand makes Harry real, makes this moment between them something weighted.
Finally, most of the table is involved in a spirited discussion of the best summer holiday spots in Wizarding Greece, and he tweaks Millie’s elbow to get her attention.
Potter’s lips slide against his. His breath mixes in with Draco’s, and he can taste the inside of Potter’s mouth now, that slick warmth. He puts a hand on the side of Potter’s head.
As soon as the bedroom door closes behind them, Potter’s got his mouth all over Draco’s. It feels a little like he’s dreaming, and he runs his hands up and down, all over the man currently exploring his mouth with his tongue. He wants to feel every bit of Potter, he wants to taste every part of him. But there’s something not quite—
Draco’s eyes were very dark. Harry could see the line of his jaw flexing from across the room. When Draco spoke, his voice was low and carried within it a current of something that lit Harry up deep inside his bones. “Maybe anything is possible if you want it bad enough.”
“It was hard,” Harry began, and let that feeling inside him lead, “when I no longer felt like I could call The Burrow mine. I guess holidays make you think about that more than usual.”
She just smiles again, and takes another drink. Behind her a big, triple-paned picture window looks out toward the ocean, and the white-stone lighthouse framed in the distance.
The lady clucked, and pointed her wand at him. He stiffened, but she just shot a drying spell at him, probably mixed with a slight warming charm, too. It felt like being wrapped up in a hot towel just out of the dryer.
“That doesn’t explain the dragons, though,” he says slowly. The Prophet appears to be doing a bit of a brush-up job on McLaggen; the photographs all show him in a library somewhere, or rolling up the sleeves of his robes at a Care Home for elderly witches and wizards. Draco is pretty sure McLaggen has never willingly gone to either venues on his own initiative. “I haven’t been paying much attention to the Traditional Wizarding Order, but dragons are inherently magical,
Harry throws a bit of flour at him, and Draco blinks in surprise when it flies all over his face and chest. “I love
Draco let out a snort. “Well, that’s a relief, Potter. It would be exceedingly awkward if you were thinking of my father when you fucked me.”
Granger writes that down, too, then taps the end of her quill against her mouth, gazing unfocused toward her hulking bookcase. “I can’t shake the feeling that there’s something more going on with this.”
“I poured it down the drain,” Potter says behind him. Draco turns to look at him. “Before we left for the house party. You have a problem, Malfoy.”
He sighs and sits down, pulling his own stack of new files and memos to review. Reports of large quantities of illegal ashwinder eggs flooding the black market. A spate of vandalism. He squints at this one, reading down the family names who’ve filed a complaint— they’re all old Pureblood families.
The thing is, if Draco Malfoy died in Azkaban, then—in a certain light—it was kind of Harry’s fault for not doing more to get him out. He’d submitted testimony, right after the war, about Malfoy’s ambivalence at the end—his refusal to identify him at the Manor, the way he’d lowered his wand in front of Dumbledore. But he hadn’t pushed things when the Wizengamot just reduced Malfoy’s sentence to a few years. And he could have, couldn’t he? He was Harry Potter, the boy who defeated Voldemort. Everyone would have listened to him then.
“Please,” Harry whispered. Malfoy’s breath was heavy and hot against his ear, and he pushed a finger into the cleft where his cock was rubbing, whispered something that made his skin slick and warm.
Draco can hear the fake nonchalance dripping off every syllable. “Yes. Quite,” he says, playing along.
“I’ll owl you,” Potter says, and then he steps back out into the darkness and is lost to Draco’s sight.
, but the words have no sound, even though the kitchen window is open to the cool, clean breeze outside.
He also hums little pieces of songs— just long enough for Draco to almost recognize the melody, but not for him to identify the composition.
After, they sat against the wall, side by side. Potter’s trousers were back up around his hips, but he hadn’t buttoned them. He was staring up at the ceiling in the dark office they’d been in all night. Draco watch him for while, from the corner of his eye.
It was an ordinary evening when Malfoy made a water glass slide off the table. It shattered on the stone floor, and both of them froze. Slowly, Malfoy reached for a plate. For a few seconds, nothing happened when he prodded it. Harry held his breath. The plate jumped and rattled against the wood. Their eyes met, and Harry exhaled.
Harry had taken his shirt off as soon as they arrived back at the room—it was ruined, anyway, ripped and stained with blood—and the air is thick, humid with steam from the hot water Malfoy filled the bathtub with. He winces as Malfoy pulls a long, thin piece from a deep laceration in his forehead, and Malfoy rinses the tweezers with more alcohol. Harry feels very calm.
“I asked for him,” she says, waving the quill still and sitting back in her seat. “Just like I asked you to be here for this meeting.”
“What are you proposing?” Draco’s voice doesn’t sound like his at all. It sounds cold and cracked. “What are your terms?”
Granger finds him in the blast zone, looking around the rubble for anything that might provide some answers. “Go home, Malfoy,” she says tiredly. “You’ve been here all day.”
“It’s perfect,” he says to Blaise, who has just managed to pick his careful way over with the generous use of some levitating charms. He brushes at the sleeve of his sweater as if something might be clinging on to it.
“It’s just some skin,” he told Draco over pad thai. “I’m really not that bothered about looking pretty. I just wanted to get home, instead.”
“—and then I gave him the statistical analysis I ran last night, but he just said, ‘I don’t think Arithmancy is going to help us here, Miss Granger.’ But when I corrected him, he still wasn’t interested! ‘This might be helpful for a Muggle disease, but not a magical one,’ he said. As if statistics aren’t always helpful—”
“That’s— Draco, no. I don’t care about that.” He walks over to Draco, stopping just behind him. “I only care about you, and my family. And I only need you to care about me and the people who love you. I— I think I love you, you know.” He pauses, his words suddenly clogged up in his throat. “Do you think— is that alright?”
“Just sit down, Potter,” he snapped, throwing his quill down on the desk. “Merlin, you—“ He shook his head, then turned on his heel and stalked out to the hallway.
“What happens if you lose your blade?” he asks. He grips the front of Draco’s tunic and twists the fabric in his fist. His body is right against Draco’s body all of a sudden—the warmth of him so close, the smell of him filling up every one of Draco’s thoughts. The feel of him. The feel of his hands—one against Draco’s chest, down low under his ribcage, one pressed against his shoulder.
The Auror squints down at the paperwork in his hand, then at the printed badge Potter extends to him. “You’re the British DMLE representative, then.”
“I’m pretty sure I could talk to Wizarding Resources about this abuse. You being my boss, technically.”
Had part of him suspected Malfoy might show up at his door Saturday afternoon, nearly twenty years since they last spoke? Had something inside him, buried deep, wondered if the unnamed garden expert Blaise promised to send was the man he’d spent a summer with, excising grief and rage and confusion, and then firmly relegated to a locked room in his mind?
“Harry,” Draco whispers, his body continuing to fall forward into him, and he takes his thumb away to replace it with his mouth. Harry licks his way in, and pulls Draco all the way into his lap. It’s dark all around them, only the low glow of the fairy lights revealing them to each other. Under his sweater, Draco’s skin is warm and he pulls his face away when Harry moves his fingers down under the waistband of his trousers. He bites Harry’s neck as Harry wraps a hand around his cock, and they’ve done this a hundred times, but it still feels new, and urgent.
Ginny sighs, her bottom lip caught between her teeth. “I know that, Harry,” she says after a moment. “It’s just— weird all around. It was always going to be, though, wasn’t it?”
stupid.” He sat up straight, and the sound of his belt coming unbuckled filled the room. His weight left, and then came back to Harry’s own body. Harry caught his breath as Malfoy leaned heavy over him, one hand trailing along the sensitive part of his side, the other rubbing his cock along Harry’s arse. Tonight, maybe, he’d go that one step farther, the one leap they hadn’t made.
Harry treks over to the manager’s building to see if there’s a better cabin available. The man behind the desk is wearing his hair in a large bun on top of his head, and his beard is braided with tiny purple beads shaped liked stars.
"I think I'll just take the Portkey and stay with Neville tonight," she says. "I can brief him and be back in the morning."
“But why would they target Harry?” Weasley asks. “He’s definitely not one of them. Everyone knows that. And why bomb it before Harry arrived, anyway?”
Draco sits in one the severe-looking wooden chairs she’s got pulled up to the other side of her desk. She’d explained to him once, after he’d complained about how damned uncomfortable they were, that it was entirely on purpose— she didn’t want people she called in for difficult discussions or negotiations to get comfortable. There was a big, squishy armchair pushed back against the far wall, but it rarely got use. “It’s effective,” he told her, grimacing, and she’d just smiled at him, like a cat who’s already caught the bird. A hundred birds, probably. He’d been newly impressed with her instincts.
Harry shrugs. “I went somewhere much nicer, when I was eleven. I understand, though, you see.” He looks up at Draco. “About loneliness.”
Harry’s eyes widen, but he doesn’t reply. Draco feels foolish suddenly, and cold all over. He leaves Harry to trail behind him as he goes back inside his castle.
He breathes in the smell when she sets his cup in front of him— lemon balm and a complex crush of herbs— and watches as Carys takes a sip.
Her eyes skim over his Auror robes again, and she waves her wand his way, sending one of the newly-made Portkeys into his waiting grasp. Another complicated twist and turn of her wand, and the mass of them rises from the basin and begins to organize into lines, hovering ready in the air.
Potter nods. “Do my hair?” he asks, and Draco goes to him, mouth twitching into a small smile. “After breakfast,” Potter says. “We can get her alone after breakfast.”
He runs his fingers down his hardening cock, imagining Malfoy’s hands. Trying to remember exactly how they’d felt when they were moving on his body, so many years ago. He lets his hand linger along the top, pushes the head harder into his palm. The callouses there feel a little different, the skin less sensitive and more rough, and he shivers.
Draco tries to pull away, but Potter holds on tight to his hand. He traces over the mark with his index finger, gentle loops over and over, and the skin starts to tingle underneath his touch. It’s like Potter’s finger has a tiny flame, etching some strange magic into his skin. After a moment, Potter stops, and Draco can see the letters glowing there, right over top of the old mark.
Draco can’t see the magical monitoring charm encircling his father’s ankle, but its presence reverberates. He stands. “That is not my fault,” he says quietly. “I’ll go see if Mother is available now.”
“Mrs. Malfoy, I know you probably aren’t thrilled about all the press coverage,” he says. “Or the fact that I was kissing your son at all—“
“No one’s heard from you in over two weeks,” someone else says. He squints around the arm he threw over his eyes and sees Dean. “No one’s had even an owl from you. Your mum Flooed me at the gallery.”
When he leaves, she stands in the doorway and he looks at her for a moment. “It was good, wasn’t it?” she asks. “For a long time, it was good.”
Draco has been hovering in the doorway, hesitant about joining in and a little shocked to be privy to their easy, casual way with each other, but Granger holds out a pitcher of what looks like pumpkin juice and a stack of glasses in his direction now. “Malfoy,” she says. He steps forward quickly and accepts them from her. When he looks over at Potter, he nods at the table, so Draco takes them over and sets them in the middle, where everyone can reach them.
Later, when everyone else was leaving, she turned to Harry as she was pulling on her gloves. “He’s nice now, really. Malfoy.” It was just the two of them all the way back in the corner of the cloakroom; they could hear the voices of the others coming from just out in the hall. Seamus was ribbing Neville about how often he could be found sitting at the bar of The Leaky when Hannah was working, nursing the same small firewhiskey all night. Rose was shouting a mangled version of Jingle Bells with Ron’s encouragement.
“Well, goodnight then.” Potter nods, and Draco turns to go, then pauses. “Maybe I should mention,” he says, glancing at the window. “There’s a ghost that comes around sometimes. There.” He gestures at the back garden.
Harry thought it was kind of cute how Malfoy was saying that while sporting an enormous streak of dirt across his left cheekbone. Then he wondered where the
“Oh,” says Granger, going a little pink. “You know Ronald. I’d ask George that, if I were you. I don’t want to know what they’re getting up to at that joke shop some days.”
It’s made from a warm cream yarn, with bright, cheery swirls of red and burnt orange running in circles up to the slightly misshapen top, where a teal pompom is perched like a fat, startled bird.
“Draco, oh god—” Harry groans, and he runs his hands up and down Draco’s chest and shoulders. Harry looks like a dream beneath him, squirming and writhing on the floor, his lips swollen and his cock so fucking hard and leaking in Draco’s hands. “Draco, let me—can I touch you now, too? Can I—” Harry breaks off and his head rolls back as Draco presses just a little harder, takes a little extra time at the tip of Harry’s cock to smooth his thumb over the swollen skin there.
“You’re still about to lose this game, you imbecile,” Harry heard from the parlour, and then there was, again, only silence.
When their footsteps have faded down the hall, Malfoy ends the charm and climbs the stairs himself, up toward the bedroom he and Potter share.
"Worth a shot," Harry says. "We keep trailing one step behind him, losing him in a crowd. I can't figure out a pattern to his movements."
“He cares about you.” Draco tries to keep him voice neutral, but Blaise’s shoulders tense up, and he turns, heading for the door, half a sandwich still in hand. Draco waits— for the sound of a door shutting, for the inevitable silence.
“Morning, Malfoy,” says Charlie. “Nothing new.” He gestures to the door in the barn near them.  “We’re letting the injured dragon out for the first time in just a moment. Get him a bit of sunlight and fresh air, poor beast.”
“I know,” Granger says, turning her nearly-empty glass of pumpkin juice around and around in her hand. “I know. I just—” She looks up at Draco. She looks so earnest, like if she said exactly the right words he would understand her completely. “The thing is, I don’t want to share with them. I don’t want them to see our movies, or use laptops, or hear our music from an iPod. I want to keep it just ours, because pure-bloods, they— well they—“
Malfoy kept his eyes open. He stayed very still, but his mouth softened and his breath turned into a sigh on Harry’s tongue. When Harry pulled back, Malfoy’s eyes went down to Harry’s mouth, and he swallowed slowly.
They’d offered special treatments, Draco learned, after Potter was back in his flat and Draco was bringing take out by every evening, just because he was bored, of course; things had been dull at the Hit Wizard department the last week. They’d offered scar removal, but Potter had waved it off.
Draco keeps staring at the key. His mind has gone entirely blank, his mouth empty of words. A minute passes, then two. Later, he won’t remember leaving the flat. Won’t recall opening and closing Potter’s door, or if he spoke. His left boot still untied.
“Probably a good thing,”says Potter, looking at the pizza box and then over at the dishes in the sink. “I didn’t get much together.”
Greg shrugs. “Maybe they should flush your eyes out,” he says, moving back over to the desk. “Something’s wrong with ‘em if you like that thing.”
Harry looks at Malfoy standing a little off to the side, but still near. His pale hair looks like starlight, his lines and angles impossibly stark against the bright day. Harry might have conjured him from dreams and memory when he looks like this.
Draco notices that there’s a heavily-woven net hanging about six feet above the entire enclosure. “What’s that,” he asks, pointing at the fine web of strands catching the morning light.
“I’d never given much thought to the way people without magic did things. Everyday things.” Draco glances over at Granger and Weasley. Granger is nodding and Weasley still looks strangely thoughtful. It’s better than looking murderous, he decides.
“What?” Hermione stares at him, one of her hands still halfway to her mouth. “You can’t be serious, Harry! You’re Head Auror!”
, or at least mostly; where the solid brick and graceful curving pillars of the Society for Magical Historical Preservation once stood, there’s only a blackened pile of rubble and twisted metal. Part of the buildings on either side are damaged, too, and there are flames leaping through the blasted-out windows.
The kitchen is dark and somewhat messy, with old tea cups and takeaway containers littering the big wooden table. “This is the Black house?” Draco asks.
Draco closes his eyes, just for a few heartbeats, and takes a deep breath. When he opens his eyes again, he steps away from the wall, right into Potter’s path.
Harry stood, too. The air had turned kind of thin and electric, like the moments before a thunderstorm. “What else have you ever been?” he found himself saying, even though he knew it wasn't quite fair. “What else have you
“It’s very rare, as you say. That makes it very valuable to collectors. But—” He slides the money a little closer, and she picks it up and holds it in her hand. It’s a large stack of bills. “Well, you keep the cosy.”
“That she’s died,” Ginny said. “You always have to tell the bees these things. The major affairs of the house.”
On the fifth night, a light goes on in the kitchens. Luna's beetles pick up the faint murmuring of a man talking through the Floo. She sends word to Neville to trace the call, and they wait. When dawn breaks in streaks of pink and lilac across the sky, the light goes out and the house goes silent. They leave some bugs and place an alarm spell around the perimeter, and they return to their hotel for a few hours' sleep.
“I meant about my retirement. Your mother seemed to think I resigned because of the story about us.”
, with the bite of late October sinking its teeth into all the corners of Grimmauld Place—Harry looked up from his solitary contemplation of the chess board and saw a ghost.
— but tonight it’s as comforting as it is amusing. He wonders if other people felt like that, when the thing they’d always said they never wanted became what they wanted most.
Harry doesn’t look away. Slowly, he moves his hand across the stone floor until it’s just barely brushing Draco’s.
“Er, well, just the tea cosies, really. I do have a discman, too. Blaise just gave me one. I like some Muggle music.”
“I thought we were partners.” Potter’s eyes are blazing, all green fire and Draco looks away. “We were in this together, Draco, and I—“
Potter does this thing with his fingers where he rolls his thumb over each one beginning with the index fingers, cracking the knuckles as he goes. A succession of little pops, at least twice an hour. He clears his throat often, even though he hasn’t got a cold, and he makes endless cups of tea. Potter’s insides will soon float away in a wash of the stuff.
He looks away, back at the stairs down to the platform, where the announcement had just come over the speaker, signaling a train is about to pull in. He looks back; Potter is still there. The rain has made streaks on the lenses of his spectacles.
He rubs the head of his cock into the cleft of Potter’s arse, against the place his fingers have stroked and stretched, and he sucks in a breath and holds it. Pushing into Potter’s body is a feeling he never gets used to; every time he does it he is surprised all over again by the clench and the heat of Potter around his cock. How it knocks the air out of him. How good it feels to thrust into Potter’s body underneath him while Potter grabs for the headboard and gasps.
“Missed what?” Draco asks. He’d been distracted watching Potter, who is seated across the table from him and has been accosted by the elderly Madam Bulstrode. She seems to find him quite charming.
“Portrait,” he explains to Draco. “Your aunt, actually, I think. Great aunt. Anyway, go through to the kitchen and she’ll calm down.”
“We’ll never run out of those,” she says, and he reaches for her hand, bringing it up to his chest where the telephone had been. She smiles at him, bright and determined, and he loves her for it.
Hermione put on her hat and then took his arm again. They walked toward the door, where their friends were. “Merry Christmas, Harry,” she said before they crossed the threshold. “I hope it’s a happy one.”
“If you do not remove your muddy boots from the top of my desk I will hex you six ways into Sunday, Potter.”
Draco waited, but Snape’s portrait just stared back, watchful and quiet. “But?” Draco finally whispered.
Draco switches a few name cards at dinner so that he’s sitting beside Millicent again. He waits for an opportunity, and watches Potter across the table from him. He’s put on a black necktie with his dark gray formal robes, and he’d obviously attempted the hair charm Draco usually did for him, but it’s not quite as neat; some of his hair is going rogue in little waves and ripples. It reminds Draco of Potter’s real hair, black and perpetually messy, and it makes him think about getting his fingers in it while he does something else with Potter’s mouth.
Millie rolls her eyes and he flops down into a chair beside her. “These house parties are so dull after the first day or so. Why does anyone think they’re a good idea?” he asks.
“I think the hipsters have infiltrated wizarding society,” Harry announces when he gets back. Draco is sitting stiffly on the end of the nubby orange sofa and flipping through some paperwork. “Draco, we said no work!”
Before he’d left, he owled in a request for leave. In all the years he’s worked with the Aurors, he’s never even taken his allotted vacation, so he figures they owe him some time off. He doesn’t go back to his flat. He can’t be anywhere near the ghost in his garden. He asks for a room, and a girl with blue eyes and a quick, fake smile hands him a big brass key.
“Who were they expecting at their rally then?” Weasley is still a bit pink in the face, but he seems willing to let the previous matter drop for now, and he asks the question quietly.
“There are people who care about you, Draco, and you’re worrying them,” Dean says, and the sound of the window being wrenched open fills the room.
Shacklebolt offers him a polite smile from his place at the back of the room, and Malfoy nods at him. Granger is there, seated on the Minister’s right hand side, a large roll of parchment in front of her and a quill moving quickly and independently over it as she speaks. And in seats pulled up directly in front of the desk are Potter and Weasley. For a brief moment, Draco wonders if this is some kind of latent childhood punishment, some trap about to spring years later than expected. Shacklebolt waves his wand and a chair appears on the left side of their group. Weasley turns to look over his shoulder, then nudges Potter when he catches sight of Draco. Potter glances behind him, too, but his face betrays nothing.
Carys is standing at the door when he arrives, the top half open to the coming evening. She makes a strangely lonely silhouette against the brightness of her kitchen beyond.
, and still not be able to quite bear cutting ties with him? What the fuck does that make me, Potter?”
He lets his body rise up to meet Potter’s searching fingers and breathes out into the slowly brightening air, and everything is soft-edged and quiet. When Potter rolls over on top of him, one arm braced on the mattress at his side and his other hand wrapping around his cock—their cocks, pushing against each other and sliding, all skin against skin against the calluses on Potter’s palm— the familiar face above, filling up his sight, is like a drawing done in soft graphite. Shadows and bits of blue-lit cheekbones. A shape he could see even if the coming day wasn’t peering in at them with ever-widening bands of light.
The dragon’s scales are shining like gems under the winter sun, and Draco turns his head toward Potter. “Do you remember that radio program we listened to at Christmas?” he asks him.
Draco closes his eyes as Pansy chokes on the next word she’d been about to throw at him. Harry Potter, the very last person on earth he wanted to ask anything from.
"How were they?" she asks as Harry strips off his jacket and Malfoy heads for the bottle of Firewhisky on the little gold cart by the kitchenette.
“No, I do,” Draco says, and realises it’s true. “I used to believe you loved all the attention, but that was jealousy, I think. I can tell you don’t, these days.”
The bell rings and people begin to stand. They move to the big double doors, the men splitting off toward the library for brandy and cigars, and the women to the drawing room for— whatever they did there. Draco wasn’t sure. Pansy pauses, and puts her hand out to rest on Potter’s arm for a moment, looking at Draco.
“I believe you,” Hermione said immediately, and Harry felt his body relax the rest of the way. “I need to do some more research. We’ll figure it out, ok?”
Granger wrinkles her nose at him. “It is,” she agrees, after a bite. “I’m just glad to see you eating a decent meal for once, Harry. I worry about you, with the—”
“Tungsten,” says Granger, softly. Something about the building makes him want to whisper, too. “Highest melting point of all metals.”
“It’s called a rollercoaster,” Blaise says. “Muggles are so strangely inventive, really. Less to work with, and yet they come up with all these things anyway.”
All feedback is more than appreciated. Anything done well, anything that could be improved upon, please lay it on me haha. It feeds my motivation to work and better my story and storytelling.
But no matter what she did, for all her gifts, none of the other kids ever liked her. Said she was bossy, mean, insensitive. Said that she made everyone else look stupid and silly in comparison, even she was trying so very hard to make it better. To raise them up so that they could stand at her side. So they could be friends. But they never recognized her efforts.
And with a crack of motion, the figure was gone, the image of their face burned into the memory of Draco's mind, crazed, angry and terrifyingly familiar. And as Draco came to, with hands slowly sitting him up from his prone position against one of the walls of the hall, there it was again. That face.
Shaking his head and thoughts out of the mental bickering he had been partaking in. Draco gave his mother a soft sort of smile and heaved a sigh of his own. “No. I uh, I think I’m good now mother. Sorry for scaring you again. But I do feel so much better now.”
She’d never let him touch her like this before. Normally all animals hated him with a burning passion, but right now she was actually letting him pet her! Marveling at how peaceful she seemed to be, Draco couldn’t help but wonder what in the world could have changed to bring about such a difference in behaviour. Glancing then towards the other bird in the coop, quietly observing their exchange, Draco smiled.
“Oh wow. Very impressive.” Malfoy clapped, tapping his fingers against the palm of his other hand. “But my answer is still no. I doubt you have anything legitimate to teach me, and since I’m already clearly ahead, working together with you might just slow me down or bring down my marks.”
“That’s the spirit.” Came the prompt reply, his mother once again offering her hand for him to take. Without hesitation Draco took hold, glancing towards the Station proper just a few streets away. Turning back to his mother he asked.
The school was beautiful, colour everywhere and oozing character in every crack, painting and facet of design in the structure itself. The tapered ceilings added a depth and scale of height to the structure that made Draco feel even smaller than he already did, suits of armor, gleaming and on guard at every main corner and painting that moved and spoke to you, when asked or prompted, or even sometimes without prompting at all. Everything just seemed so new and exciting.
His mind supplied. But how? How could that possibly be the case here? Guilty, he was feeling guilty? For what?
Chuckling softly behind her hand, Narcissa moved to stand by her husband, observing the new style in amusement and with a critical eye. Gone was any trace of gel or mold, and instead a more laissez-faire sort of approach was used, with the long blond locks left to sweep along and frame her son’s face as they curled and coiled near the top of his head. “That makes the two of us dear. Though I am rather curious as to what exactly brought about this particular change.”
And as the Headmaster slipped away, Draco’s eyes grew wide at the implications of that statement. Harry Potter had been the one to find his body? Merlin, this was mortifying. One of his childhood hero’s first encounters with him was finding him sprawled across the floor of a train cabin, dead to the world. Somebody end him right now. How was he even supposed to speak to the other at this point? More than that, what would all of his other classmates think?
And Potter's features pinched at the very mention of the title, nose scrunching and brows furrowing before promptly smoothing themselves out. "Eh. They're going good! I'm enjoying all of them so far, but potions is definitely my favourite. It's just like Chemistry."
Trewalney nodded then. “Very well. But please just Poppy, I assure you, Mr. Malfoy will be fine. I’ll escort him back into his dorms once the worst of it has passed. Thank you Quirinus.”
"Some weekly gossip rag in the Daily prophet apparently that's been making heads spin for a couple weeks now. Written by that slimy hag Skeeter no less."
"Good." Narcissa nodded, before ushering Draco up into the train. "Now, quickly. Quickly. The train will be leaving in a couple minutes so hurry up and find Vincent and Gregory. And don't forget to write. I mean it!"
“Perfect, and I myself have no particular qualms about either for these conditions. Though, I’m personally much more interested in the topic of payment, or exchange of services. Because as much I would love to save the world with you all out of the goodness of my heart, there isn’t really much goodness left really. Mostly it’s just spite and laziness and indifference. Mostly indifference.”
“And seeing as you are perfectly fine now, and all diagnostic spells have come back clean and without issue, I’m fairly confident you should be good for Hospital discharge at this point in time.”
Clapping Draco on the shoulder, Lucius smirked. "Only matters if he ends up getting caught. Isn't that right Draco."
It was almost spooky, with the dark of the outside contrasting so starkly with the brilliant glow of the candles and sconces of the halls within, making the castle itself seem impossibly bigger and even more imposing than it already was. All Draco could hear as he made his way towards Trelawney’s office were the clicking of his own shoes against the stone of the walkways, and the fluttering of his robes billowing in the wind.
And please look out for my new Voltron Fic that'll be coming out soon. Take care all and please, let me know what you guys think!
"Weasley." Draco spoke, turning his attention back towards the text he currently had laid out before him. They were both in the library at the moment, towards one of the less popular alcoves for students to huddle up in, likely due to the relative age of all the nearby selections and the very apparent lack of windows and marginally awkward lighting.
"Indeed we are. Now, do I burn the papers one at a time to savor every moment or all at once to watch the pretty colours."
And his Godfather’s eyes moved to scan the room once again, roving over each of their forms before eventually coming to a stop upon the form of a boy directly behind Draco himself. And Draco knew suddenly what was coming.
"Don't worry son. Everything's going to be alright." Lucius smiled, placing both hands atop Draco's shoulders. Warm and stabilizing. "You are a Malfoy remember, and Malfoys can handle anything. You're  going to crush this year little Dragon."
Continuing to walk on, she made her way to the nearest junction relative to their class, a fork in the halls with a staircase to the left and branching paths to the right and onwards. Immediately she caught sight of a streak of silver at the edge of her vision and she was pushing her way forward towards the stairs. Climbing quickly in an endeavour to catch up, she spotted Malfoy dip out of the stairway into the floor above pulling what appeared to be a small parcel of sorts from his cloak. He must be making his way into the owlery, she noted, suddenly recalling that the coops were located in that general direction and on the fourth floor which Malfoy had just ascended to. Immediately, she was changing pace and moving towards a direction. If he was going to the Owlery then she could intercept him at the cloakroom stairwell.
Then without much preamble, the Slytherin Head began to speak. “As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through the human veins, bewitching the minds, ensnaring the senses...”
And Draco took a small sense of satisfaction in seeing how the redhead immediately gaped at him like a fish and how his features steadily grew to match the shade of his hair, hands balling into fists at his side. Blue eyes burned into Draco's form, an ugly snarl quickly forming upon the other boys lips, but the blond was done with this conversation and without another look back pushed passed the Weasley into the rest of the library.
“Sybill Trelawney? Why yes, indeed I am. And both of you are Draco Malfoy. Truly the world of magic is a wondrous and mysterious thing.” She spoke with a chuckle. “I’d never even imagined that at some point in my life I'd be dealing with time travel of all things. I really should thank you, the next couple years are all of a sudden looking so much more exciting because of the two of you.”
“Well that’s certainly a new look. Trying to change things up on your first day hmmm?” His mother smiled, watching him then as he bounded down the steps of the manor’s grand staircase, his luggage piled neatly at her side. Reaching the bottom, he rushed forward, his mother catching him in a hug just as he came to a stop. He laughed in her arms, before pulling away, smiling up at her as his father joined them in the main hall, the last of Draco’s luggage floating alongside him.
Immediately, there was a round of minor gasps as several other interested gazes moved to turn in their direction. Both Greg and Vinny looked floored by the news as both their eyes had grown at the new information.
Seeing his discomfort, both Narcissa and Lucius sent a glance towards each other before looking about around themselves for the briefest of moments. Then in the next, having acknowledged that there no prying eyes, both moved forward to comfort the younger blonde.
Locking gazes with Longbottom as the bigger taller pureblood touched the ground, Draco lowered his wand and spoke.
"Not one bit." Was the immediate response, taking the blond just the slightest bit aback. "It's nice sometimes yeah, but I'd really rather just be like everyone else. I don't want to be different. Just normal y'know."
The woman merely hummed in acknowledgement. “But anyway, as I was saying before. I do certainly hope you weren’t planning on using your own owl for this little plan of yours. They’ll be far too easy to trace back, especially with the amount you plan on sending in the future.”
“Ah well, that’s a thing love. We can’t apparate inside the station, only beside it, because of the wards surrounding the facility.”
In the end it seemed like Potter had stood his ground over his assigned position and both Granger and Longbottom had ended up taking spots on either side of Potter and Weasley. Granger looked pinched about the entire ordeal and Longbottom distinctly terrified. Absently, Draco noted their Slytherin partners to be Daphne and Blaise respectively and Millicent at Draco's side, partnered with Weasley. It was rather tragic though. He had been so looking forward to flying all week, and now that he was here, sleep deprived and functioning with the knowledge that there was a serial murderer waltzing around inside the castle, he just couldn't quite muster up the same level of excitement he was normally used to.
The next time Draco had a vision, it was thankfully in the safety of his dormitory late in the evening and in the comfort of his own bed. He had been trying restlessly to sleep after having finished another relatively exhausting day of classes, marking assignments for Trelawney and subtly attempting to keep as much distance as feasibly possible from Quirrel and his evil living bald spot in DADA.
And truly, Draco could only blink in response, watching as the other boy held his gaze with a truly stubborn sort of glare. And well, he guessed the fact that he was getting chummy with a couple Gryffindors was certainly out of the ordinary, even more so when one considered the fact that one was a blood traitor and the other, the slayer of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Not that he could be blamed for any of it, Potter sought him out on his own and the other Slytherins had essentially abandoned him to Longbottom in potions, so Draco was discounting any and all responsibility in himself that gave way to the given circumstances.
“What’d I miss?” Ron’s face joined Hermione’s in the Floo. “Are we still talking about that tosser Malfoy?”
Draco presses his fingers into the two points throbbing near his eyes. Is there time before he must leave to prepare his people for the long wait until next year’s crops?
Draco presses the edges of his fingernails hard into his palm, uncomfortable. “I could have done more. I could have done
He glances over, and Potter is staring back at him now. He lets out a loud burst of air, and then he’s laughing, helplessly. Potter’s whole body is shaking with it. The lighting is dim, but Draco can still make out Potter’s face, and how it breaks wide open when he laughs. He can’t look away. He can’t stop his mouth from stretching, too, into a grin to match. The air is still warm from this day that has already slipped away, and the traffic somewhere distant reminds Draco a little of the ocean heard from far off. The sweet, slightly acrid scent of tobacco lingers in the air, and Draco can scarcely believe he’s here, right now, in this slightly unreal pocket of time, laughing on a crummy back stoop with Potter.
Potter puts a hand on the back of his neck, and Draco presses his lips into the skin below his ear. He raises his head, and then he kisses him. He kisses Harry, and he puts his hands on either side of his face. It’s slow at first, and then it’s hard and almost frantic. Potter’s hands are in his hair, and he pulls it, rough. Draco chokes on the sweet, sharp hurt.
Like Potter will float away, full of light, higher and higher into a pale blue sky, if Draco lets go.
Malfoy makes a small noise that sounds suspiciously like a snort as he pours a finger of the amber liquid into a cut-crystal tumbler. Harry notices the edge of his mouth is turned up.
He takes his place in the bed while Potter is still in the bathroom this time, just to avoid the awkwardness of last night. When Potter comes out, he closes his eyes and listens— there’s a whispering sound like fabric sliding over skin, and a tinny rattle that he thinks are Potter’s glasses being laid on the nightstand.
, every bit of it. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you who I was. I just—when we were together like that, I should have told you, but I wanted you to want
“We’ve had a hell of time keeping those bandages on him,” Charlie tells them. “He just incinerates them when he’s not feeling it, silly bugger.”
“Work that bad?” Draco asks, then wonders if he’s overstepped. He’s not sure where the boundary is, after tonight. After Potter smiled at him that way.
“It’s a good thing you’re here,” Potter said after a couple more mouthfuls. “I can’t reach around my back to put the ointment on there. I could use your dexterous fingers.”
Hermione looked torn, her eyebrows wrinkling together. “That must have been very uncomfortable,” she began, and then had to stop when the laughter swelled again. “And you’re all grown men now. Ministry officials!”
Harry looks at the cabin, and decides then and there that he’s never going to trust the advertising for anything, ever again. He should have come and looked at the place first, he should have made the time to make sure it was right for—
Pansy raises one of her well-groomed eyebrows at him and pointedly sips from her own. “Anyway, darling, as I was saying, I really am put out that you missed it.”
The room was empty, with the exception of a long, rectangular object covered with a sheet that had once been pure white, standing in the far corner opposite the room’s only window. He knew it, instantly, like something knocking at his bones.
"Only that perhaps the Special Teams have run their course, Minister. While there are still Death Eaters unaccounted for, the majority have been captured. Covert operations are a hard sell to the public when they stop producing results."
He opens his eyes, and this time there’s a tall figure behind him. A man’s hand on the back of his neck, fingers curling around into sight. As he watches, the Harry in the mirror closes his eyes and leans forward under the other man’s force. He’s naked suddenly, his cock hard and flushed and his hands pressed against the glass. His breath fogging up the mirror. There’s no sound; the man thrusting behind him, into him, the smack of skin against skin and words falling out of their mouths are all silent, like a television put on mute. The Harry in the mirror reaches up and behind him, tangles his fingers in soft blond hair.
Draco shakes his head as some elves appear and then disappear again with their suitcases. “Don’t gape.”
It’s all he can think about, with his cock in his hand and his breath turning uneven. That image of them in the mirror. They hadn’t done that, back then, but he tries to imagine exactly how it would have felt. How it
Potter’s face is not entirely symmetrical. One of his ears is ever so slightly higher than the other, and that’s why his glasses are always slightly askew. He’s also got a very faint birthmark in the dip below his left cheekbone. It’s shaped vaguely like Portugal.
He leans forward, folding his big arms in front of him on the table. Even Hermione leans in, a little, as if to hear him better. Blaise was hypnotic when he wanted to be.
Tom Evers looks nearly unhinged now, still frozen in place but blinking rapidly, fingers clenching and unclenching on nothing. Draco takes another step forward.
“Maybe I just don’t like how the sound of your lungs coming up through your throat is interrupting my leisurely contemplation of my sad, sad holiday.”
“Maybe I’m done being careful,” he says to Blaise’s back. After a moment, he walks up and stands beside him.
“My department will want to verify this kill immediately,” says Potter. “You realize this man is at the top of our Wanted list? A Death Eater we’ve been tracking for seven years, since Voldemort’s death?”
Malfoy pours a palmful of soil into a little envelope and stands, peering back at the little white boxes. “How many hives do you have?”
“Yes, sir,” he says, and Robards nods. With a quick clap on the shoulder, he’s gone again, into the fray.
, Potter, and I— Look, I know I screwed up the past week. But the thing is, today I was just doing a walkthrough of a dive bar in Naples. It was supposed to be the pointless, easy run of the day. And then, suddenly, I thought that maybe the corpse we were going to meet over next would be mine, and I—“ Merlin, he was bad at this. “And I didn’t want to be a corpse before I was the guy who had your key in his pocket. Who smears ointment on your back scars, every time.”
Draco shrugs. “A word with my mother. Getting in isn’t the problem. Being trusted with information is the real issue.”
“And there,” he said against the skin under Harry’s left ear. “Right there, Potter.” His teeth bit gently and his tongue smoothed it over again.
He almost wishes he’d never noticed it, and had spent the rest of his Sunday night in a daze of warmth and pleasure. But Harry Potter hasn’t run from anything that frightened him, for a long time. As he looks at the photos tucked inside, of he and Draco outside the Muggle restaurant Friday night, he hopes that Draco feels the same. He hopes that this is worth it to Draco, too.
“Cassius?” Pansy opens a drawer in the side table, and pulls out a little silver holder and a pack of cigarettes. The silver glows, briefly, when she puts one in and suddenly the smell of fine tobacco and a touch a clove begins to permeate the room. “He’s a bit of a shit, of course, but—“
Petunia opens her mouth, and it looks like she’s going to argue. “A gift for Harry,” he says before she can, and she shuts her mouth again. “I bet there are a lot of things you could tell him about Lily that he doesn’t know, and that he would very much like to hear. You should invite him for tea and tell him about her.”
“I’d said already, if I had. We’ve had some local Aurors by the place, when someone took out a chunk of the containing wall.”
“I do.” Granger is calm, but firm. She’s got her boss face on. “Malfoy assists me in a lot of work, and has for awhile now. Years, in fact. I request him specifically. Are you questioning my judgement?”
“Look here, you tosser,” he began, but then his lips were so close to Malfoy’s, and their hips were nudging together. Malfoy was already getting hard, pressing through his trousers against Harry’s cock, which was rapidly following suit.
“Oh, uh— were you?” He shifts awkwardly on his feet. “I suppose I didn’t think about how that might come as a shock. I’ve been wanting to do it for so long, so—“
alive, though.” Harry found that any terror he might have felt before was being pushed out by another feeling—sheer bloody aggravation. “And I can think of more fitting places you belong.”
“Why don’t you come to the Manor tomorrow?” Malfoy says. “You can hear Mother’s plan, and we can go from there.”
“Work?” Dudley speaks around a mouthful of pizza, and Potter nods again. “You still having trouble with that—”
He looked back up at Malfoy, who was picking bits of wet straw off his coat sleeves with a look of extreme distaste. “Are you missing plans right now, being here?”
“Draco,” whispers Harry. His voice in the shell of Draco’s ear makes his whole body shiver and press harder into Harry’s.
“We might actually elect a man to a seat on the Wizengamot who’s running on a promise of moving backward. His party’s platform leans on severing ties with the Muggle world completely,” she says, as he skims the story.
“I know,” Draco says, and Potter blinks, but relaxes just a fraction. Draco can tell now. “Alright,” he says, giving Potter a small nod. “Into the breach, then.”
“I’d wager this one doesn’t miss much at all,” Malfoy continued. Rose clambered down, and Malfoy leaned back in his chair, looking up at them finally. “Don’t forget who her mother is.”
He closes his eyes. It had been a rough few months, with the separation. The kids were all here at Hogwarts, and he and Ginny had still spent the winter holidays with them together, as a family, but it wasn’t the same and everyone had felt it. James would be graduating soon, and then it wouldn’t be long until they were all grown, and gone.
Pansy startles, very subtly. Her spoon knocks against the side of her porridge bowl just a little too hard. “It is,” she agrees, and she offers a smile up to Potter, who she thinks is a pureblood from Ireland and Draco’s lover. When she looks back to Draco, her eyes are sincere. “I’m so glad you two are here.”
Hermione nodded. “It makes sense. And that’s not all. Interviews with the subjects afterward indicate that they can’t just go wherever they want. In fact, it doesn’t seem to be place-based at all.”
“You didn’t think I cared, did you?” he says carefully, to Draco’s back. “I mean, that people know. About us.”
It was strange, how far away the rest of the world felt, even though they were hardly hidden, in a dim alley in the middle of London. Harry tried to care that someone might walk by and see them. Might catch them, he and Draco Malfoy, two notorious wizards with their cocks out, kissing now like it was the only way to breathe, to stay alive. He tried to care and couldn’t. This was too damn
“I know. I know, Hermione. But my deputy head is strong, and she’s ready for the job. I know she is. And I just don’t want it anymore.”
Weasley is awkward at dinner. Tense. The whole situation is, really, but Granger is trying very hard and, surprisingly, so is Potter. And maybe there’s a strange sort of holiday magic that creeps out from people when you put some holly wreaths and candles up, but Draco doesn’t hate it.
Harry nods. “Neville was telling us about her lavender and snap dragons awhile back. Impressive new strains, he said.”
,” Harry yelped, and sent his mug of cocoa spilling onto the rug. His heart staggered around in his chest.
Draco Malfoy stood on his stoop—the real, embodied Draco Malfoy. He looked thinner and a little worn. His pale skin wasn’t as smooth and shining in the flesh, and there was something about his eyes that seemed bruised. He desperately needed a haircut.
“I hope—“ He cleared his throat. “I hope you’re happy with each other. I hope you have a good life together.”
“Pomona says we’ve only six months of grain left if we use it at a normal pace,” Draco says. “Not enough to see us through to next year’s crop, assuming we even have a normal crop.”
Harry snorts, and pulls them over to the low patio wall. They sit on the smooth stones and watch the other guests laughing and talking.
“Mrs. Potter?” Harry asks. “You mean Ginny? We’re separated. It hasn’t been in the papers because the divorce isn’t final yet, but that will happen soon and then it’ll be everywhere.”
The man behind the counter smiles at him, so he smiles back, and tips the change into his back pocket. Next door, he orders a croissant and a blueberry scone. There are more people out now, and he watches them talking and laughing, starting their weekend. The sun peeks higher between the buildings and casts shadows onto the pavement.
“Can’t you make the best of this?” Harry asks, frustrated. “Can’t we just have a laugh, and enjoy ourselves anyway? You are so high maintenance.”
“Bit early for a fancy dinner, isn’t it?” he asks. He’s wearing some old sweatpants and a Chudley Cannons t-shirt. “It’s only nine.”
“Greg helps Cassius keep his new stables in order and does business Cassius is too posh to go and do himself. And don’t think I didn’t notice you call him by his last name.”
“When will he summon you?” Harry asks as they lie naked in bed together. It’s near midnight and the candle is almost burned down to nothing.
“How’s the quest for your ugly tea cosy going?” Blaise asks him when they reach the library. He’s still in the same dressing gown, but he’s wearing an old pair of boots now, too, and a soft grey cashmere wrap tossed around his shoulders. He reminds Draco more and more, with every visit, of some eccentric recluse wandering around his personal museum, curator of his own strange collectibles.
Harry’s smile is dazzling. “If we’re managing the border together, you’ll need to be here. Not the capital.”
“I shouldn’t have made that comment about the hunting,” Draco says now, his voice quiet, too. “If I’d gone with them this morning I’d have more opportunity to watch him.”
“Yes. James is about to graduate, though, and then he’s off to Romania to learn about dragons with his uncle. It doesn’t seem possible. My Albus talks about Scorpius nonstop, actually. He’s a wonderful boy, your grandson.”
When the waves have stopped, he carefully pulls out each hive’s queen and carries her gently to the baskets. When he's done, he finds Ginny standing a few feet behind him. She holds out a cup of tea, and they sit down on the back steps.
“Mm.” Blaise raises his eyebrows, lacing his fingers together across his stomach. He's still in his maroon silk dressing gown. “And?”
“Hermione would like something tangible, some kind of hard proof to connect Warrington to a crime before we bring him in,” Potter continues.
“Oh, I see. Yes, asking you to plan a weekend we would both enjoy is so high maintenance of me,” Draco says, standing up.
“How do people get the things that run the discmans,” Weasley asks suddenly. “You know, those little cylinders, what are they called?”
“Even Harry Potter,” he agreed with a small smile, which Malfoy returned. He looked softer when he smiled.
A faint smile softens Blaise’s mouth, and Draco’s heart clenches in spite of everything. He wishes the sight wasn’t so rare.
“She’s doing well. You know, I wasn’t sure how we’d get on, because of— well, you know. Old history. But I quite like her. She’s very funny once you understand her tone.”
When the sun has made its way high up into the sky, he stops in at a coffeeshop and picks up two dark roasts and some doughnuts. His destination is in Hackney; a thin slice of a big building covering two floors. He knocks on the street level door, but when there’s no answer he heads down the small staircase to the basement one. It’s unlocked, and there’s a Muggle radio station playing inside, so he opens the door and walks inside.
Maybe he doesn't need to explain, though—Malfoy tightens his grip, his fingers now a steel trap where they had been silk rope just a moment before. Harry can feel the bones of his wrist shift and the joint stretch and ache under the pressure. He allows his breath to escape, low and hard. He flexes into the pain and his entire body turns warm, a flush rising up from his middle and across his face.
He knows as soon as Potter enters the square, metallic room outside the holding cell. If he hadn’t recognized him by height and stature, by the dark, untidy hair and the familiar set of his shoulders when he’s particularly tense, Draco would still have known him immediately by the way he held his head when he walked into his peripheral vision. High and straight on his neck, with the chin tilted up like a satellite scanning the area for the source of disturbance. His body turns toward Draco, but he keeps his gaze away, on the three other people in the room with them: one Auror, a representative for the Italian ambassador, and a lawyer.
Granger steps through his Floo with an enormous Christmas dinner, and her gangly husband pokes his head through warily behind her.
Harry’s hand stops moving and he goes still all over. His cock jerks in Draco’s hand, against his own cock, and Draco lets himself go, too—lets himself spill all over Harry’s hand and cock and body. Draco has never allowed himself this, has held on tight to whatever control he can manage, and now he lets it go. It takes him whole. It takes him right over the edge and drowns him on the way down.
“I can think of someone it might matter to, if you would crawl out of your self-indulgent, drunken sulk and pull your head out of your whiny arse.”
Potter starts eating— slice in hand, no silverware in sight, no mention of a plate. He nudges the box a little closer, so Draco reaches in for a slice, too. It’s too hot, but delicious. There are little pieces of pepperoni dotted across the top, their edges curled up all crispy, with puddles of delicious grease inside.
It seems to require a great deal of energy for Snape to continue, and when he does he sounds so tired, more tired than should be possible for a portrait of magic and paint.
“Why indeed,” says Blaise. “Can we just get to the point rather than repeating tiresome, circular arguments?”
Harry dropped the reins of his temper. “This is a ridiculous argument! I have no idea what your problem is.”
He doesn’t notice the manilla envelope on the front stoop until Draco leaves Sunday afternoon, with lazy coffee kisses and vague plans to see each other for lunch on Monday.
“I’m afraid that might be a problem, Auror Potter,” says Moretti, a little uncomfortably. “I don’t have clearance to release the body right now, and my department will want to investigate his identity and how he came to be in Naples.”
“Queen to G4,” came Ron’s voice suddenly, and Harry shook himself back to the present. Behind him, he could hear one of the queens on the chess set scraping across the board.
have, yes. But other people appear to be relaxing their guard and visiting family and close friends.”
Six months had turned the world frozen and then melted it into a soft greenness again. Grimmauld Place was shining softly in the late-spring sunlight, scrubbed and polished over the last few weeks. Harry had even bought a new rug for the parlour, though he moved the old one into the kitchen. The cocoa stain had never quite come out. Ron and Hermione had been over last night for the first time since the pandemic. Six doses, once a week, of the new Magical Preservation Potion and people could go out again. Tentatively, joyfully, they gathered.
“Carys Rhees.” Granger nods and writes it down. “The only structure near them is the lighthouse we saw when we Portkeyed in. She says a Tom Evers runs it now.”
If war comes, the forest will no longer be neutral ground, and the Malfoy lands will feel the pain of it first. Draco wonders and frets, and still the great, old forest keeps its silence.
"'Though the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceeding small,'" he says carefully. "'Though with patience he stands waiting—'"
“Cool it, you tweaking twink. It’ll be okay. Just, lie low. Try to stay calm. Eat something. I can call a friend if you need help coming down,” She said. She reached out to touch his arm, but she dropped her hand. Was she always this reluctant to touch him? How long had it been since he’d hugged someone? Why the bloody hell did his meth brain
“I’m fine,” Ron responded. “I was talking with Hermione a lot last night. She called me pretty late after she got out of lab.”
I will be making a sequel of this story! I hope for it to be longer and much more elaborate. (school, money tw): I don't know when I can start writing it or when I can start publishing it because I still have a lot of work to do for college (financial aid, etc) and graduation, but I intend to start ASAP. Thank you all for being so wonderful and sticking by this story!
Malfoy rolled his eyes and said with great disdain, “What in the bloody hell gave you the idea that you should tell my mother that I’m ‘not okay’?”
After he paid for the sweets, Harry went to the Hog’s Head for a firewhiskey. Even though the bar was a refuge for sketchy wixen [AN* wixen is the gender neutral and plural form for wizards/witches], he could not avoid the press there. While he waited for his drink, twelve people came up to him and thanked him for his sacrifice. Harry didn’t quite mind, but it certainly didn’t feel great to have strangers tell him about their loved ones that died in the war.
.          “Oh, well, yeah. He does. He’s very smart. Can you count to ten for Draco, Teddy?” Andromeda bounced the child,
to act like that while on the clock. When he finally reached the Black Cauldron, he promised himself that he’d shut his brain up. He clocked in and waited for the night, and the high, to pass.
[Cute, my love. You are very cute.]” Andromeda informed him, grinning. She ruffled his hair and went back to looking at Harry. “You look like a strapping young man,” she said.
.          Malfoy appeared to be doing something similar. He still had his fists clenched, but now he was rubbing his thumb against his index finger. He looked miserable and torn—confused, as though he didn’t know what to do. He bit his lip. “Well, I, um, I suppose. If you’d like. I’m living here…in Manchester. In Moss Side. Which, I suppose that doesn’t matter as owls can find someone no matter their location or knowledge of their location…” he rambled on, looking like he was thinking of something else.
He chuckled, "Yeah! Just like when I, uh…" Harry realized that he didn't tell her the full extent of the sleep-walking. "When I stopped by there one night when I got some Archie's. I really love the city. It's so different from London." He could tell that she wanted to ask about it, but she changed the subject.
Draco watched the group the entire night. He knew that he wasn’t being stealthy or sly, but then again, he never was when it came to Potter. Not really. The whole group pretty much ignored him except for Granger. She came up to the bar sometime that night and ordered more drinks.
I’ve been well-- considering what all has happened. I’ve sorry for not writing to you, but I have been busy. Yes, the rumors are true: I’m attending the University of Manchester.
Both men lined up behind their respective entrance points. They dropped their robes and took deep breathes. They ran in when the professor blew her whistle.
“Well, I, like Auror Escobar, used to be a high level auror. We were partners, and we were working on a very specific mission to figure out Death Eater business in France…”
The cold water at first calmed him, but it only took a minute or two for him to realize that the hot water heater had broken again. Being a shitty building, it was often that the residents would have to rely on cold water if
.          "Ooooh, are you using your big boy words now, Potter?" Malfoy replied. He sneered at him.
Harry felt like he was floating. He was floating down Oxford Road; he had to be. Wait, was he floating? Harry was so confused. Why was he so confused? Was he dreaming?
It was day three, Wednesday, and Draco felt like shit. He didn’t sleep at all on Monday, and it was hell trying to sleep Tuesday night because he had started coming down. At this point, Draco suspected that the “coke” was more meth than anything else. He had his final meeting with his probation officer today, and he was not going to let some damned meth ruin it. He stopped rocking back and forth—something he found himself doing a lot when he was mentally vulnerable—and got up to take some Xanax. He was hoping that the combination of the two drugs would make him feel sober. That’s what Sally told him to do, anyways.
to forgive anyone. That mumbo-jumbo therapist bullshit about how forgiving and forgetting will free you? Yeah, it's bullshit."
to him, showed off in front of his friends in front of the entire pub, was then carried out of said pub. Draco was blushing like a bloody idiot.
For the beginning of February, it was quite warm—10 degrees Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit). It hadn’t snowed for days. However, this pleased Harry. He was attempting to take a cab to the local cinema. It was 5:30 PM and the fifth of the month. While he was excited to watch
He arrived at Andromeda’s only to hear the toddler yelling and screaming. His hair was black and curly, as if he was attempting to mimic his godfather. Harry smiled. If this was how powerful Teddy’s magic was so far, he couldn’t wait to see it when the boy went to Hogwarts.
.          “I like ‘ur ‘air,” Teddy stated, somehow missing both the “y” and “h” sounds. Harry resolved to help the child with his pronunciation later on.
He sealed up the parchment. Then, he got out another sheet. If he was going to taunt his mother with his and his aunt’s relationship, he might as well respond to his aunt. He took another shot.
“Yes,” Harry said. Somehow, in a shop with Draco Malfoy, helping him pick out presents for Andromeda Tonks nee Black, the weirdest part was Draco being poor.
Ron spoke up, “I just don’t want to wait until those stupid breaks to see Hermione again. That university thing is so bloody dumb. Why go to a muggle university when you have all this experience and ability in the wizarding world?”
.          Harry opened the window to let the owl in and got out the owl’s water bowl. He took the envelopes off its leg, and he read them aloud, “Bill. Bill. Bill Weasley. Madam Malkin’s. Witch Weekly. Junk. Draco Malfoy. Junk.” He threw them onto the kitchen table, but he nearly walked away before he realized what he just read. Harry went back to the table and picked up Draco Malfoy’s letter.
of this. He couldn’t just sit around and wait for the information to pop into his head. He decided to go on a broom ride to clear his head. Grabbing a light jacket, he headed outside quickly. He rode around London for an hour or two before he got bored with the familiar sights. Harry made a conscious decision to go to the University of Manchester. It was the first time that he went there without it being sleep-flying or simply passing through. The trip only took him an hour, and it was only that long because he’d chosen to fly so slowly. When he arrived at the campus, he landed just behind the Williamson Building. It looked very different to him now that he wasn’t high. He hid his broom behind a bush and casted a concealment charm for it.
“Merci, it’s all from scratch. I was thinking that we could have candy apples— y’know, caramel, sprinkles, chocolate, cherry sauce— and red punch— kinda like a bloody color— and peanut butter-chocolate fudge, ooh! and graveyard brownies.”
“Je vais le voire. [I’m going to see him.]” Harry walked over to the playpen where Teddy was stationed. He picked the infant up.
“Yeah,” he said. Her words confused him a lot. He hadn’t dissociated since the Halloween after the war. God, he was so confused.
"I'm sorry. It's bullcrap. Now, I want you, Harry, to go to this damn tour and enjoy it. Don't place all your hopes and dreams into it or anyone else there. It's up to
“Accio key,” Harry called before he thought. He closed his eyes and braced for the worse, waiting for something like the Gringotts trap. The key flew into his hand. Nothing else appeared to happen. He walked across the room and unlocked the door. He stepped into the fourth room.
“Would you like the free nachos that are included with our happy hour? A purchase of three martinis merits a plate,” Malfoy claimed.
Harry closed his eyes and took a break from his mixing. He opened them and sighed. He poured the vanilla and the rest of the ingredients into the bowl, continuing to cook.
“Wha—? Harry! That’s just cruel. How am I supposed to have a partner that doesn’t even look after my well-being?”
“Okay,” Malfoy consented. “I’ll go first and then you can wait a few minutes and go. So people don’t think we were skipping together.”
Harry didn’t know how to start out, so he decided to let the kids ask questions for ten to fifteen minutes. He picked a small Indian boy first.
“Fine,” Ron grumbled. “A fireball. And a beer, please.” He paused, thought over his answer, and finally replied, “A Blue Label.”
. He hears it again every night when he turns off his lamp and closes his eyes. His mouth remembers, in spite of himself, how it felt pressed to the patch of skin revealed: the suprasternal notch, that small hollow pulsing wildly with Harry Potter’s breath. The sound he drew from Potter’s vocal chords with his tongue like a bruise, a smear of left-behind want.
And then he’s gone. Draco hears the door close quietly behind him, and he slides to the floor, strangely out of breath and with tears spilling down onto his cheeks. When he finally looks down, the word is gone, and his arm is the same as it always was.
A bell rings suddenly, from a room beyond the kitchen, and there’s a whooshing sound followed by a loud crash and someone cursing.
There’s a hand between his shoulder blades, and another on his shoulder, and they propel him forward, out of the kitchen and down the short hallway to his bedroom. As Draco falls onto his mattress, a small part of him knows Harry Potter is putting him to bed, but he shoves it aside.
He ignores the barb lying there, and says, “I came to speak with Mother, but I hear she’s engaged at the moment.”
The first time he and Potter fucked, he was still engaged to Astoria, and Potter had only recently split from the girl Weasley. Potter had seemed to feel more guilt about it than he did; he and Astoria liked each other well enough, but their future marriage was pure business, really. It was nothing to him if she was having it off with someone else in the meantime, and he’d damn well claim the same leeway for himself.
Outside the Ministry, he stops with his team—Malfoy, Luna, Neville—and Hermione. "Lunch?" he asks them.
to be better than that. He believed in second chances. He believed— if not in clean slates, at least slates turned over to a fresh, blank side. But Malfoy needled and pushed and—
“To look.” Harry hooks his feet around Draco’s calves before he can push away entirely. It’s very quiet; there’s nothing but darkness out the window and no one but themselves here in Draco’s room.
“No power source?” asks Granger, leaning forward. “That’s a very complex charm. I’ve never seen it work on Muggle electronics before.”
Draco smiles. He can’t help it. Potter is lit up on the inside, he can tell; Potter really does love it.
Draco knows. “Why did you invite me over, that first time?” He’s been wanting to ask. Now feels like the right time. “Why not just tell me yes or no?”
Draco blinks back a sudden rush of moisture in his eyes, and tries to get free again. Potter holds on for another long moment, his fingers wrapped around the bones of Draco’s wrist.
Draco pulls the money he’d changed over to Muggle pounds from his pocket, and sets it between them on the table. Petunia looks at it, the spell broken.
With his good arm, he reached across the space dividing them and put his hand against Draco’s chest; palm flat, fingers spread like a starfish. Draco stopped everything. Shouting, moving. Breathing.
It almost feels unfamiliar. He could almost imagine it was someone else’s palm he was thrusting into. He could almost think— when he squeezes harder, slowly down, then up a little faster, a little tighter— it was Malfoy’s grip. Just always shy of too much; always just past what Harry imagined he wanted.
That night, against his better judgement, Harry opened up a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon from the Black family cellar. He drank it from an old jam jar instead of the cut-crystal goblets on the Black family shelves. He drank the entire bottle.
“Potter,” he says. He’s older, of course. His limbs have a new weight to them, his eyes more shadows and lines. But he sounds the same. Precise and sharp-edged.
“I need to ask a favour,” Draco says. It sounds like something he’s worked at, something he pulled painfully through his teeth. It is.
The day Harry turns in his resignation, he sends Draco an owl. Now that the garden is finished, he doesn't have an excuse to get Draco to linger, drinking tea and playing that old game of who’s doing what, just like they’d done before. He hasn’t wanted to rush anything, or read Draco’s interest the wrong way, but there have been moments when he feels sure that he’s not the only one who
Blaise sits back, and picks up his firewhiskey again. “And that is my heartfelt advice for another few decades, at least. Weasley, close your mouth. You look like a codfish.”
“Is this ok?” he asks, with his fingers pressing lightly into Draco. He wishes he could say yes in every language, could scream it with every part of his body.
“Yes, yes,” says Harry. “I’ve missed you, too. It’s time to go to our new home.” He pulls up some magic, something sweet and slow right in the very middle of his body, and he pushes it out, offers it up to them like a flower offers up its sweetest abundance. The bees rumble, and they take. They leave the hives in streams and they trickle over, brushing against his skin in whispers and ripples, and pour themselves into the open tops of the coiled wicker skeps.
him, can never get enough of his sharp, wicked smile or the way he’ll look at Harry from the corner of his eye right before he kisses him. If Draco knew how often Harry thinks about him throughout the day, every day, he’d never doubt what Harry felt at all.
After awhile, it grows heated enough for Draco to realize that Harry’s leathers are in the way, and though Harry’s hand is so close to getting under his own clothing, Draco pulls back.
“Inevitable, I should think.” Lucius takes a long sip of his wine. “It’s been building for ages—this borderland has always been contested, and Salazar and Godric view the forest as dangerous ground for thieves and surprise invasions. Now that Godric’s convinced Slytherin has something to do with the prince’s disappearance, I expect we’ll be at war by the new year.”
"Oh, good morning, Harry," she says as he tries to pull the sheet up higher. "I brought breakfast. How was your evening with Draco?"
“Soon,” says Draco. “I was supposed to go with the new year. I won’t be able to put it off much longer.”
Granger shrugs. “I’ve found it best never to assume the worst is over, unfortunately. Constant vigilance, and all that.” She smiles to herself, like she’s thinking of a private joke.
Potter is still watching him, his head still propped up on his arm, but he’s smiling now, and the smile isn’t forced. It isn’t polite or unwilling or uncomfortable. Draco doesn’t know what to call that smile, precisely, but it makes him feel odd on the inside. A spreading warmth and a quiver, low in his belly. A pressure in his chest. He could get lost when Potter smiles at him like that.
“I had fun,” Granger says. “I really enjoyed showing her different Muggle clothes, and introducing some Motown into her record collection.”
Through the window, he sees Granger appear on the bluff between the cottage and the shore. He drains the last of his tea. The crockery is too dark to make out the shape of the tea leaves. “If you remember anything,” he says as he stands, “
“Dawlish told me someone from the party owled, asking for the list. Said they wanted to make sure everyone was on the same page. I couldn’t find any paper trails that show them
“It’s funny,” Granger says, after a silent moment. “My mum had a tea cosy. When I found out I was a witch, though, and started learning about spells and went to Hogwarts, I was so taken with charms like Stay-Hot. It’s never occurred to me to appreciate a tea cosy.”
"I think they all deserve the Dementors' Kiss, Mr. Potter." Finnagle isn't smiling anymore. "Make no mistake about that. But I must justify, to the public which we represent, the continued cost and the secrecy of the program dedicated to hunting them down in foreign lands, when results—captures, Mr. Potter—are fewer now, and far between."
Harry felt very strange. There was a pressure building in his head, something hard and aching behind his eyes and clutching at his throat. He opened his mouth, but nothing came out.
Potter’s lips go thin as he presses them together, and he cracks the knuckles of his index fingers with his thumbs. “Listen, Malfoy— I can’t get them to do anything in the Auror department. I just finished my training. I’m nobody there.”
“Good luck,” she yells after him as he runs forward. People are leaning out of windows, coughing and crying and screaming for help. It is only much, much later, after everyone but the Aurors and other investigators have been removed, that he realizes he’s been repeating the same word to himself, over and over in his head.
“Ah,” Dumbledore’s portrait said, giving up its pretense of privacy. “My dear boy, that is the best beginning of all.”
A year ago— even a few months ago— Harry would have heeded the note of warning in Malfoy’s voice. He would have been more careful. But care, he thought now, twisted and flowed with the change in landscape; like magic, it fed on a continual change of form.
“Well— I suppose not quite one-way. Although most pure-bloods buy from a dealer, like Zabini, who purchases items and then passes on a mark-up, so Muggle businesses don’t see the full amount a pure-blood is paying for an item.”
Potter lets out a long breath, as if he’d been holding it this entire conversation. Draco waits for the explosion, but it never comes. “Well,” says Potter. “What could possibly go wrong?”
“Something about this genuinely minuscule flat makes you look good, Potter,” Malfoy whispered against the back of his neck, and he shivered helplessly. “…Bigger,” Malfoy added, and Harry shifted, turning around to look at him.
“You know I don’t do that. I own the business. I don’t buy my own stock or bid on consignments because I am the agent. What’s the item, anyway?”
The next morning, Draco prepares himself to visit his parents. When he comes out of his bedroom, Potter stares from the newly-perfect sofa.
It occurs to him that Potter will soon be lying down less than a foot from him, if he’s estimating the size of the bed accurately. Under the same blankets, all those parts of his body warm and close to Draco’s.
“Perhaps you should figure out what happened to you before you charge in asking questions about me.” With that, the ghost of Draco Malfoy turned his head and faded out of sight.
“Could I get you a nice cup of earl grey?” she rallied. “It really is good. Just the ticket, really.”
“It’s not a party,” Pansy says, with a curl of her lips. “It’s Cassius, and a few of his cronies. He’s smart, and he knows what people like our parents want to hear. He knows what makes them feel afraid. I think he’s probably been studying them all his life, resenting all that old influence that his family’s money couldn’t quite buy.”
“Yes,” Hermione interrupted. “I see your point. But no, I haven’t heard anything. Why do you ask, Harry?”
“Malfoy,” he says placidly, holding out a fresh cigarette. He lights it with the tip of his wand. “You here about the dragon attack?”
Draco nods. The train slows to a stop, and he watches a new rush of people leave, only to be replaced. Potter clears his throat as the train picks up speed again, and Draco glances over at him.
They eat, and eye each other across the table. Draco’s skin feels too tight, as if he might split it right down the middle and emerge as something that looks more like he feels on the inside— awkward and strange and anxious.
The woman merely gave him a dismissive wave of her hand, drinking her tea now right out of the pot. "Simple, shuffle the papers around a bit. Choose one of every four or five, pass it and fail the rest. Think of it as mental training for when you eventually have to choose between who lives and who dies."
But how to facilitate such an encounter? She couldn’t just ask him. That was far too simple, and not to mention embarrassing. She would need to establish a reason for them to end up in the same general area together in some capacity. She could ask him to show her the castle perhaps? As they were both younger students it would stand to reason they wouldn’t fully know their way around and familiarizing oneself with one’s environment was always a good idea. But then how would she bring that up? Or even manage to lie through her teeth, as she had already mapped out the castle in her own time.
Thankfully, Draco had been struck with a bolt of inspiration in the middle of their conversation. And instead of simply outright rejecting her, which was what he had tragically resigned himself to do, Granger herself had provided him an even better solution. A challenge. Now he just had to play his cards right, and -
"Wha-?" Immediately, the ginger looked taken aback, the scowl slipping from his lips at the flippant tone in Draco's voice. Obviously, then redhead had clearly expected some other sort of response. Probably a fairly biting one, given the apparent ongoing feud that the Weasleys and Malfoys have had for at least a few generations now. And Draco did think about it, it certainly would have been quite the convenient outlet for all the frustration he'd suddenly found himself dealing with so far.
"The philsopho's what? Also when were you planning on telling me our Defense Against the Dark Arts professor was legitimately working with a being of the Dark Arts?"
Feeling the faintest hints of heat building across his cheeks and the sick coiling sensation of steadily blooming guilt in his stomach, Draco let out a silent internal cry of frustration as he school his features and nudged the fellow boy in front of him. Immediately, the other eleven year-old nearly jumped out of his shoes as he spun around to face the blonde, face a growing shade of scarlet and eyes wide with shock and trepidation.
“I-I-If you sa-say so, Sybill. I s-still believe Madame P-p-pomfrey should be inf-fo-formed however.”
However, lacking in sleep and awareness, he could only really pick out certain tidbits of their conversation, let alone properly fathom the words or intent behind their exchange.
That was thankfully still a couple hours away though, giving him some much needed time to calm himself down as he sought to try and find his way to the Hogwarts owlery. He’d made a good amount of headway thus far, but was finding navigating the corridors of the massive castle to be a greater challenge than initially expected. There were just so many things to see!
All feedback is more than appreciated. Anything done well, anything that could be improved upon, please lay it on me haha. It feeds my motivation to work and better my story and storytelling.
“Alright class, that will be all for today, and congratulations on successfully completing your first week here at Hogwarts. I’m glad to see you are all settling in well.” Professor McGonagall announced. “Which also means, I no longer have to refrain from assigning you all homework as you are all now well and used to being here at the castle. As such, for next class I expect you all to have read to page thirty six of your
Dear gods, the smell inside the room was beyond rancid, and the blonde could barely even see the stone beneath his feet given the sheer amount of owl droppings and pellets scattered across the ground. A frigid breeze blew through the room then, through the glassless windows that the owls slipped and flew through, cutting right past the fabric of Draco’s clothes and causing the blonde to wrap his arms tight around his middle. Well there went his good mood.
In an instant, he was on the other side, the sight of an entirely new platform greeting him as he moved past the threshold. From there, he spotted his Mother of to the side, giving him a small wave and motioning him over. Joining her there, Draco took in the bustling site of the station before him, the people everywhere, readying their things and saying their goodbyes, and the roar of the train as it slowly readied for departure.
“It's Dobby, right?” He said, absently dipping a hand in the bath to test the temperature of the water. Watching him, with its large eyes, the elf jumped as it was addressed. Surprise clear upon its features.
Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived, was on the exact same train Draco was on right now and it left the blonde almost giddy with excitement of getting to meet an actual living legend, even despite how much Lucius disapproved of him. For Draco, like with most other Wizarding youth born in recent times had grown up with tales upon tales of the great Harry Potter, and the fact that, right here right now, if Draco played his cards right, he could potentially become friends with him was both legitimately mind-boggling and practically meant to be. After all, they did have quite a lot in common, fame, money, power and though Draco was certainly behind in glory, he was certainly determined to catch up in that regard as well.
There were so many people! Everywhere that Draco looked was bustling with activity, the sound of incoming and outgoing trains echoing throughout the entirety of the building. With swift steps, and the slightest of frowns upon her features as she gazed upon all the muggles amongst them, Narcissa lead Draco further into the station, passing platform after platform until they reached a small section of wall between 9 and 10.
The next day, found Draco amongst his peers as they moved to take their positions along one of the open fields around the castle as directed by Madame Hooch. Deprived of decent sleep, the blond blearily made his way forward, shifting to stand beside his other housemates as Hooch lined them up directly facing the Griffindors.
From where he sat atop the single wooden stool, in a vast expanse of white Draco observed as the other boy, paced back and forth entirely immersed in his own train of thought, words spilling from his mouth every so often as he mumbled and murmured on about things Draco himself had no idea how to even begin considering. Statements pertaining to his current manifestation, his apparent age, the effects of magic that could somehow cause a mutual possession.
"Please, I'm sitting right here. I ask that you please don't talk about me as if i'm not in the same room as you Drake. It is rather rude you know. And yes, I can hear you. I do not know exactly why, but I believe it might have something to do with the fact that my future self was part of the botched ritual to send you back, as I've been aware of you for quite some time now."
Because he was raised with manners, Draco opted to simply shake his head in response to the question, still mid chew and in dire need of a drink to chase down his food. Taking the response for what it was, Vinny continued on in Greg's place, a gleeful smile on both their features.
A pause. "The column knew how to open your Uncle's secret room. Where it was hidden. Told the law how to find it. We all need to watch this supposed Seer closely. Because while it could have been a one off, a horrifically lucky guess, they haven't been wrong once since the papers started printing it."
Decidedly dejected and just distinctly peeved after Drake’s conversation with Trelawney, Draco set himself down in huff on one of the benches in his first class of the day: Potions. Arguably the class he had been looking forward to the most before event starting at Hogwarts given his personal fondness for making things and the fact that it was taught by his Godfather, it truly was rather tragic that he all of a sudden found himself in simply too bad of a mood to even try to look forward to it.
And as he continued to speak, Draco found that initially what started out as the mere humoring of the voice inside his head, had now steadily turned to a truly sincere sort of encouragement. Seeing the other boy’s face go slack for a moment, Draco quickly turned his attention away feeling heat gradually building across his features and up to his ears.
To be perfectly honest Harry would have to say his experience so far in this new world of magic he had suddenly found himself in was astounding, with massives highs such as meeting Hagrid and Ron, getting Hedwig and finally managing to escape the dreadful home and school life he previously had to endure while living with the Dursleys. And that wasn’t even considering the sheer beauty and, cliche as it was, magic of everything around him.
The other boy sitting across from Draco looked to be around the age of one of his Father’s interns. He had sharp angular features, with the faintest traces of baby fat upon his cheeks, sharp almost silver grey eyes and messy platinum blonde hair that fell haphazardly around his face and across his brows. He was clad in a plain white dress shirt and a pair of strange blue pants, jeans, if he could recall correctly and muggle sneakers. He looked like one of those pompous pretty boy sort of blokes he’d seen before in some of the Daily Prophet tabloids, all dark and mysterious like and completely obsessed with how other people saw them.
Rubbing at his eyes Draco shook his head, silently focusing on his exasperation with his mind-neighbour to get his nerves down to manageable levels. Then with an explosive sigh, he let himself fall back and onto the pillows of his bed again, gaze trained on the ceiling of his bunk and surrounding curtains, eyes already long since adjusted to the dim lighting of the room. Then after a moment Drake spoke up again.
And immediately Harry turned his gaze towards the front, "I- I think it’s D-Drug of Living Debt, sir." Harry said hesitantly, trying his best to recall the words exactly that the blonde had spoken. The room grew silent as all within absorbed the given answer, and once again Harry could feel the fire on his features. .
It was interesting then, that beyond Madame Hooch herself, almost none of his other yearmates seemed to have any sort of apparent concern for the other boy. The Slytherins sniggered amongst themselves while the Gryffindors seemed to be watching the entire event unfold with expressions of awe, excitement and even envy. It kind of made Draco feel just a little bit bad for the other pureblood.
"Of course I am." Came the resolute response, giving Draco pause. "And you're not. That's just facts Malfoy."
"That he is dear." Narcissa laughed. "Though let's both just hope he doesn't get into anywhere near as much trouble as we did when we were in school."
"Oh come off it Malfoy. Don't try your tricks with me. I know you're up to something. Your kind always is."
“Oh, uh-.” A little shaken by the directness of the other, Hermione took a moment to plan out her words, stepping closer as she did so till she and the slytherin were only a couple feet apart. “Well, I was thinking that perhaps you would like to work on McGonagall’s assignment together at some point over this weekend. Um, given the fact that you and probably amongst the more advanced members of the class, I thought it would only make sense for the both of us to work on it together so that we could learn more from each other than just on our own.”
"One that we should all be paying very close attention to." She said softly, as the loud chattering at the table had suddenly died down. "This was from a couple weeks back. Addressed to Amelia Bones. I suggest you read it Pucey"
Unsure of what exactly to do, buth hearing no counter from Drake, Draco gingerly placed the letter into the waiting woman’s grasp. “Fantastic.” She smiled, slipping the note in her mass of coloured shawls. “Now, while I have you both, and while I do happen to have the general idea of the plan you’ve happened to come up with, I do believe it prudent for us to discuss our distinct roles in this soon to be partnership.”
"Uh. N-nice weather we're having eh?" Potter suddenly spoke, and Draco couldn't help but let out a laugh at the sheer awkwardness of the attempt.
But Drake had pointed out rather quickly though, that doing so would only make it harder for the both of them in the long run, at least for now. He was a Slytherin, she was a Gryfinndor. He was pureblood and she was a muggleborn. He didn’t know how aware Granger happened to be in regards to blood and house politics, but it was clearly not enough to inform her that establishing any sort of relationship with Draco would only put the two of them into a totally unnecessary state of danger. Especially considering just how prolific the Malfoys happened to be in darker circles.
Standing himself up, he made his way over towards the loo, being careful not to trip over any of the scattered covers he had brought along with him on his tumble down. Getting to the sink, he stepped up on the small step ladder his parents had graced his bathroom with, and moved to examine himself in the mirror. Grey eyes. Chubby cheeks. Blond hair. Breathing a sigh of relief, he acknowledged that everything at least seemed fine. He couldn’t afford to be sick today of all days after all.
Narrowing his eyes the redhead responded. "I know enough Malfoy. You rich Slytherin purebloods are all the same. Sleazy greedy old families that toil with the Dark arts, wanting for nothing while at the same time stepping all over us smaller folk. Up in arms and raving about muggleborns for who knows what, despite all the horrible things your people have done to them. What's there not to know?" The other boy shrugged, looking almost smug as he moved to cross his arms atop his chest.
But just as quickly as the thought came, it was just as swiftly dashed, not out of any particular niceties or calls to politeness of course, but rather just due to the fact that Draco already had enough on his plate thank you very much. And making a rather bull headed, ignorant and narrowminded enemy, for the second time no less if Drake's memories held true, would just be utterly exhausting to deal with. He had Nott for that particular role already.
Right into the waiting arms of one Sybill Trelawney, the witch catching Draco right around the waist, and hoisting the terrified eleven year old right up against her chest. Had Draco been more lucid, the blond would have felt beyond embarrassed at being subjected to such a humiliatingly childlike position, but as the situation stood, all Draco himself could feel was an overwhelming sense of relief.
And the woman smiled, turning for a moment towards the entryway, before extending a hand and a shimmer of light flew from the tips of her fingertips to surround the area just beyond the doorway. Absently, Draco figured that it was likely a notice-me-not spell despite not actually being aware of what a notice-me-not spell even was; though that particular thought was drowned out by the acknowledgement that this woman had just cast a spell both wandlessly and non-verbally. The blonde immediately felt his jaw start to drop.
“Are you the one who did this?” He asked aloud, watching as the Snowy Owl stepped closer towards the two, before nipping ever so gently at Draco’s fingers. “Did you make a friend Cetus? Oh you lucky girl, you’re already way ahead of me aren’t you. So popular.”
Stopping for a moment, Narcissa bent down to crouch at Draco’s height, hand coming to rest on his shoulder. “Alright darling, mother will go first, and you just do exactly what I do alright. It may look a little strange, especially with so many muggles around, but I assure you none of them will notice and nothing will hurt you. Right, now watch closely dear, I’ll be waiting on the other side.” She spoke, lips quirking upwards as Draco gave a nod.
Glaring absolute murder towards the other first year, Hermione gritted out. “And what makes you so sure of that? You never know, I could score even higher than you in this upcoming assignment and then who’ll be the one laughing.” She scowled.
Quiet! Draco mentally growled, he was insulted now and frigidly offended. And Weasley - Weasley started it first. Besides, Draco was leaving. He refused to suffer this self-righteous sanctimonious rat for even a moment longer.
At the mention of the term, visions, Draco cut in, brows furrowed in thought. "I thought Seers were only supposed to see into the future. Why did I happen to see something that's supposedly happened already nearly a month back?"
"Now, hold on a minute. Take your time, I'm not chasing you away." Draco spoke, feeling a smile come to his own lips. "I was just curious is all."
A couple weeks after the start of classes, Draco felt that he was finally starting to get properly settled into schooling here at Hogwarts. The classes were a breeze and the experiences thus far with the rest of his new housemates has been for the most part rather pleasant. He had most of his classes with Vinny and Greg, and a few with Pansy so he wasn’t wanting for company in any capacity..
At the very least however, as the lesson eventually began, he had himself a bit of a giggle watching all his other yearmates struggle to summon their brooms. Even without Drake's help, Draco had already been flying for years now around the manor, so it was without much effort that he brought the broom to his hand and readied himself for take off.
And with a roll of his eyes and an aggravated sort of huff, Draco took off, the sounds of his fellows and Madame Hooch calling out to him in an outrage as he split from the rest of the class and towards the indicated tower as fast as he could. Stopping easily, he pulled forth his wand from his sleeve just as Longbottom appeared overhead, broom rushing onwards past the top of the tower, and the statue at its edge, as the other boy's cloak snagged itself against the spear of the figure. Now dangling perilously several meters up, Draco watched the cloak tear almost in slow motion as Longbottom hung there for a moment, dropped a bit and then fell.
Still very much staring at him, Cetus cocked her head left and right as she almost seemed to scan Draco’s form, her feathers ruffling ever so slightly, before she gingerly stepped forward and Draco took in the sight of a gorgeous Snowy owl sharing in the space of the Cetus’ coop. Pristine white feathers with almost gem like eyes; they were smaller than Cetus definitely, but given the close proximity Draco found the two in, he couldn’t help but smile.
“Haha! Marvelous, I shall go and make arrangements and let everyone know.” Dumbledore hummed happily, starting forwards on his way towards the doors. “I shall see you all during the sorting then. Severus, if you could please help young Mr. Malfoy rejoin his fellow students when the time comes, that would be lovely.”
Without preamble he felt his Mother then gingerly take his hand and begin leading him deeper into the station, weaving their way around people as they neared the train itself. The train wheezed loudly as they drew close the whining of the steam echoing in Draco's ears. Stepping up towards the nearest entrance for boarding the train, Narcissa reached forward to wrap her arms around her son, spotting Lucius as she did so quickly making his way to join them.
Besides, if rumours could be believed. There supposedly quite the celebrity on the train today, his parents had absently informed him a while ago. A fact confirmed by the near incessant buzz of excitement from all the other first-years as he made his way further towards the back of the train.
"With love, supposedly." Trelawney drawled, voice oozing a distinct fake sweetness. "Though I figure it's probably the distinct blood magics his mother died to establish. But love just so happens to have a nicer much ring to it.
"Ah yes, your mother is right Draco, better move soon else all the good spots end up taken and you have to room with some of the less dignified folks currently about." Lucius drawled, his previous warmth smoothly cooling over as he shot a glance at a family just entering the platform. Bright red hair, old worn clothes and the numbers matching their rodent like name. Weasleys, his brain immediately supplied, his lips slowly curling. Blood-traitors, ugh how disgust-.
Then as heat blossomed across his cheek Draco leapt from his bed, eyes wide and ears ringing with the resounding echoes of a deafening crack. Breathing heavily, the blond grasped at his covers in an attempt to ground himself, head still spinning from the immediate ordeal, his cheek still stinging despite being aware that no mark would or could be found.
“What!? No, oh please, no need to go to such lengths Quirinus. I know the tea Mr. Malfoy had, exotic, very strong herbal qualities, he should be fine in an hour or so. Thankfully, he only had a minor drink, or he could have died-.”
“I prefer the term proactive in this particular instance. Considering the danger we are inevitably likely to face and the chaos our little games should bring. It is to my understanding, that I am to help you with these missives and when the time comes aid young Draco here in mastering his own skills in being a seer alongside yourself. Am I correct?”
Hermione’s ears were on fire, as she took in the blonde’s words, her mouth gaping in shock and sheer indignation. Oh the nerve of this arsehole. Was he actually insinuating that he was better than she was? Hadn’t he heard anything at all about her from any of their other classes yet? “I-I only need a little more time! You saw me in class, I nearly had it at least four times before McGonagall dismissed us all.”
He had been able to catch up with Vinny and Greg and Pansy, and slowly started to integrate himself in the general Slytherin ecosystem by making inroads with some of the more prominent names amongst his fellow year mates. Millicent and Daphne both seemed fairly pleasant so far, if a bit snobbish and self-absorbed, understandable considering they hailed from similarly well connected households, while Zabini for the most part was still fairly aloof to most everyone as of yet.
In response to Draco’s reaction, Quirrel took another step closer, crouching down then to be at eye level with the blond, apparent concern written across his features. Tentatively, he raised his hands up, in a gesture of calming surrender, attempting to show Draco that he clearly meant the other no harm.
“Oh! R-Right away Master Draco!” Dobby spoke then, popping away from the loo to his room the moment the words had left its mouth, the sounds of shuffling and latches clicking open and closed wafting back towards him through the open door.
That was true. At the very least this particular experience didn't leave Draco hyperventilating horrifically and fearing for his own life. Though instead it had ended up leaving him feeling rather put out and legitimately sad over someone else's. It wasn't exactly a feeling Draco experienced very often, and everytime he did end up feeling overly empathetic it always ended up with him feeling exceedingly exhausted for not being able to make it go away as soon as he could.
Tailbone and arse practically on fire at the suddenness of the drop Draco pulled himself to his feet, just barely catching the tail end of Trelawney finishing a spell around the doorway of the room. Turning back to look at him then, she gave him a gesture of sorts, and spoke dispassionately.
“Draco. And yeah, we have. Thank you for that again by the way. Now pay attention, or Snape’ll yell at you again.”
Taking the bag, Draco nodded. “Yes mother, I will. I’d really rather not get measured again. Madame Malkins was nice, but it was soooo boring. I was sure I was going to go bonkers if I was in there any longer.”
Off to his side, and seemingly completely unaware of Draco's sudden internal screaming match, Madam Pomfrey also gave a hum of thought.
Pausing at the elf’s statement, Draco took a moment to reflect. Huh. “Yes. What of it?” He said with shrug, not entirely sure where the elf’s bewilderment was coming from. True, he hadn’t really ever been particularly kind to the family elves at any point when he was younger, but he was sure he’d at least said please and thank you at some point in the past. It was after all, the polite thing to do.
