Harry sighed. This man was impossible. He waved a hand in a dismissive fashion. ‘Yeah, whatever.’
“Stay,” Potter said, then looked bewildered at his own word.
Small/undetailed references to blood, injury, past suicidal ideation will be in later chapters
So, Harry hounded Malfoy with a barrage of questions, like, ‘How is your family?’ (Fine), and, ‘What do you most want to do when this is all over?’ (Go back to work), as he watched.
A £1099 cabinet. Along with
“Mysterious.”
Draco pulled back to get a look at him, rubbing the pads of his thumbs over Harry’s wet cheeks. ‘Do you like it?’
‘Spin the bottle!’
"I knew when you told me that you were bisexual, you'd want to try it with a man. But Malfoy? And right under my nose?"
his mind told him.
The smile returned. 'Shall we break for lunch? Oh! I suppose you haven't had fresh fish or seafood yet, yeah? That's another requirement.'
He winced. Okay, this was harder than he thought. He glanced over at Draco, and saw him write a word, pause, then write another. 'How are you doing?'
Draco hummed. ‘I suppose.’ He was meticulously running a fingertip along the lengths of each of Harry’s fingers in turn.
Shit. He was definitely blushing. ‘I …'
‘Here,’ said Malfoy, as he lowered his lashes, pinching off a pink butterfly from his wrist and sticking it to the back of Harry’s hand. His fingers were cold where they brushed against Harry’s skin. Goosebumps travelled up his arm.
'This is so good,' Draco said with mouth full.
“I meant … it’s nice. It’s a nice surprise.”
‘That’s no fun.’
'No.' Draco smiled, and the smile faded slowly into a frown. 'You know it's not you, right?'
‘They wouldn’t. They would never help me and my family,' he said bitterly.
Okay, he was probably properly blushing, then. He caught Pansy’s eye, and she was grinning at him. Well, might as well join in on the fun. ‘Oh you
Evidently, thanks to Neville’s ability to name any plant, it was a little potted African Violet, then. The thing had rings of fuzzy, round green leaves and delicate purple flowers in the center.
'Can I use your Floo? And I'll Floo back once I'm done?'
She smiled. 'I'm sure I already know, but I'm happy to hear you say it, if you're ready.'
Draco waited with mouth pinched shut.
'Draco, don't give up just when you've got everything you've always wanted. Choose happiness.' She looked into his eyes meaningfully. 'Or you'll regret it for the rest of your life.'
he wondered. Perhaps it’d been a bad idea to come. He hadn’t really thought it through properly.
“Seriously, you’d want to hear about that?”
Draco shrugged. “Honestly, I have no idea. I’m going to assume, knowing Luna, that she’s picked up strays along the way. People who needed something to do with their Christmas.”
. It’s not wrong at all.” Her expression was so loving, so gentle.
Then he went home and worked on penning a reply to Draco.
. I mean, unless you've changed your mind.'
The guest bedroom was small and simply furnished. A twin bed took up most of the space, and it had a cosy patchwork quilt laid on top and several mismatched pillows—all in earth tones. A painted seascape hung above it, with crashing waves against a rocky cliff, under a stormy sky. There was a wooden nightstand next to the bed, a matching dresser, and a single window through which you could spot a red-leaved tree.
Draco stood for a moment, just staring at the spot Harry'd just occupied. Swallowing, he felt the heaviness in his limbs—more evident now that Harry wasn't distracting him.
They seemed to be in a quiet little town. A couple meandered down the sidewalk, arm-in-arm, but other than them—there was no one else in immediate sight.
'I know you are, and I forgive you for it.'
That sounded … nice. He released his face, and put his arms through the robe, wrapping it around himself, tying the belt at his waist. His face felt wet, and he sniffed—wiping the fluffy white fabric against it.
“I—I’m not,” he protested, crossing his arms over his chest. “I’m just looking out, and they’re flying there, aren’t they? It’d be distracting for anybody—eyes are drawn to movement.”
He groaned and pulled himself up off the bed. Well. He’d better get this over with, then.
? What business do you have, shoving him like that?’ Harry demanded, searching Malfoy’s face for something. Some reaction, some explanation.
Sighing, she leant over and showed him the trackpad. ‘Here. He has loads of stupid videos. You just use this square to move the little pointer on the screen. And see those videos on the side? You select them by pressing down on the square. Got it?’
Miserably, he shook his head. “Do you?”
“His hair is as dark as a blackboard. I wish he were mine, he’s really divine.”
Malfoy didn’t appear to care. He should be mad, he should be shouting at Harry, asking how he could be so
They’d all arranged themselves in a circle, sitting on his furniture. What was left was his rickety old rocking chair, which he didn’t know why he had. He wasn’t a granny. But, Harry picked up his mug of tea from the coffee table, and sat in it anyway.
Molly burst into a wail when she found Fred’s silver hand had fallen from the Weasley clock. It was probably the worst sound Harry had ever had to hear.
So Harry scribbled in Moira’s details, then they said goodnight. He sincerely hoped that what he said had helped, even if only slightly. Harry wanted to be able to help, just as his journal-mate had already helped him.
to move on, after I was rejected. Need I remind you of that fact?'
Draco licked at his bottom lip. 'Well I do.' He did. He didn’t have a single doubt.
He asked Hermione over with his Patronus, before opening it up.
'So, Draco, what was Evan like in school?' Dave asked with a grin, before taking a sip from his red drink. Cranberry juice, perhaps.
the war? How had Draco felt at his trial, how had he felt when Harry rejected his handshake? How had he felt when his letters came back, unopened?
Their food came and Draco ate in relative peace, listening to his friends talk about Muggle politics in America, which Blaise found fascinating for some reason.
“Hello Potter,” answered Blaise, nodding. “Draco. Having a nice stroll?”
And their mouths were
Harry lowered himself onto the head of Draco’s cock. Fuck, it was bigger than fingers, but he wanted it—inside him … so fucking badly. The head breached through Harry’s arsehole, and Harry felt like he might be being torn open. In a painful but absolutely brilliant way.
He removed his marshmallow, holding it up vertically to watch the flames eat away at the white of it, slowly turning its whole surface black. Once the fire was out, Potter popped the burnt marshmallow into his mouth, and the sound it made was crinkly.
they be sex-less ones? Considering she’d had the misfortune of falling in love with a … a man who did not prefer women.
‘Draco, just one other thing … the other Slytherin’s know all about it, and, um, word travels fast?’ she said with a shrug. As if it were no big deal. As if she hadn’t just ruined his life.
Draco smiled. No way to know, he supposed. The water lapped pleasantly up his neck.
“You can find an exit, I’ll grab a bottle,” Draco said.
He unlocked room 221, and shoved the key back in his pocket. He went to fetch his book from the bedside table.
Potter finally stopped his lingering, and moved to step past Draco, before making shuffling sounds from his corner of the room. Draco chose to ignore Potter’s potential distractions.
Malfoy forked three pancakes onto his plate straight away, and smothered them in butter and syrup.
, Draco.‘ She sighed, and set the thing down on the table beside his drink. The smile returned—a dangerous smile, Draco noted. ‘Okay, this is
Malfoy pulled back from the kiss, to thrust into Harry with increased abandon.
Note: I took:
She seemed to accept that, and they went on eating. Astoria liked to dip her sandwich in her soup … A habit Draco thought was a bit unsavoury. Who wants a soggy sandwich?
‘Draco’s tea!’ she beamed.
The rest of their day played out normally. No mention of their explicit conversation. Nothing had changed, really.
Reminding himself to breathe, he took a breath. Draco's heart was in his throat. 'And to what do we, the general British population, owe the pleasure?'
“Ah, well, I had an idea. I’ll … I’ll show you once we’re in.”
Harry’s face lit up. “Okay, so, remember how you told me you love seeing what Muggles dream up about magic?”
, if you will. It was on her list, and … we went.'
Despite all that, Harry, ever the Gryffindor, whirled around and his jumper bells jingled all the way over to Draco. Draco’s eyes widened, and looked like he wasn’t sure on whether or not to smile.
Hermione regarded him for a long moment. ‘Let’s go someplace to talk.’
Draco nodded. 'Yes. That's right.'
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry was absolutely flabbergasted. This was all … like a dream. It didn’t seem real.
“Who was it?”
Draco was absolutely mental. Fuck, he loved them—they were brilliant.
Memories of the Manor from last year threatened to surface, pushing against his mind. But he wasn’t ready to let them through, not now, or he might end up hyperventilating on the floor.
Harry bumped his side against Draco’s.
When Harry’s hunger was satisfied (he’d forgot that he hadn’t eaten for 24 hours), and Malfoy was still nibbling away, Harry filled him in on the meeting with Dumbledore.
“That’s the sweetest...” Draco swallowed. “Kindest thing.”
Fuck. Amazing, really.
A glass or two later, Draco booted up his home computer. (Yes, he’d gone through the immense hassle of purchasing one from the Muggles, and setting up an internet connection.)
Oh, right, Malfoy had asked a question.
'Yeah,' Harry answered softly. He couldn't tear his eyes away from the tree.
He squinted around the room. Right. He’d better get ready, then.
And it was driving him a bit mad. He did not like it at all.
“Ah.”
‘That’s wonderful to hear, Harry.’ Her eyes squinted when she smiled. ‘How did that happen?’
His eyes wandered around the room as he nodded and ‘mmhmm’ed in all the right places (he hoped).
. Shit. Potter’s expression twisted into something horrified.
Harry choked out a laugh. ‘Bloody obviously.’ He sniffed. ‘You are so, so thoughtful. So unbelievably thoughtful, I …' Fuck, he didn’t even know what to say. So, he didn’t say anything. Instead, he kissed him.
Harry paused his spice grinding. 'Oh,' he breathed out, and looked around the flat automatically, as if picturing it. 'That'd be really nice.'
smooth skin), not to mention his glittery pale silver eyes and thick dark lashes, or the barely-there freckles on the tip of his nose. It was all easy to notice now—on the edge of the softly-lit dancefloor.
“Are you having a good time, Harry?” Luna asked, appearing out of nowhere.
He did though—he did think it was amazing—It wasn’t an exaggeration.
, about Harry’s competency in working the machine. Something about him being able to do something
Potter spoke slowly. Gently. “I get... well, Hermione calls them episodes, but I’m not sure that’s the right word. Anyway, I get them too. Where everything becomes... overwhelming.” He squeezed Draco’s clenched fists, just once. “It’s helpful to focus on what’s around you. Hermione calls it ‘grounding’. You try to focus on what you can hear, what you can smell, what you can touch, what you can see...”
It wasn’t quite enough, Harry pushed into it, trying to get Draco to keep his mouth flush against his. Harry swiped his tongue against Draco’s bottom lip—which Draco met a fraction of a second later with his own tongue.
Draco shrugged his shoulders—just once, and kept looking down at his hand on the blanket. ‘They weren’t talking to you much this year, right? Ignoring you? But now you’ve gotten their attention again, and you seem quite happy about that—it looked so normal. It just makes sense that everything would go back to the way it used to be.’
Okay. He won’t be weird and stare stiffly at Potter the whole time. He could dance.
They stayed like that for a long moment.
‘I want to know everything about you.’ It was true, Merlin, it was true.
‘Of course. So as long as you do the same with me.’
Harry and Malfoy stepped up to the drink table at the same time. Harry hadn’t planned on this; in fact, he’d been avoiding looking at Malfoy ever since he was caught staring so openly at him. But now … now they were in each other’s space, and Harry couldn’t avoid looking at him now.
Harry quickly nestled into the crook under Draco’s arm, splaying himself—and his warm, bare skin—half across Draco’s body. Draco wrapped an arm around him, pulling him close.
sent him those things, right? It wouldn’t be, say, his mum sending him weird gifts and an old diary … Okay, he was definitely just anxious. ‘You sent me …' Merlin, what was
He grunted.
“Yeah?” Harry asked under his breath, staring straight into Malfoy’s unwavering eyes.
Potter tugged on his wrist.
, not really, and certainly not overnight.’
‘I … shouldn’t.’
Draco stared at Harry, his eyes blazing. ‘That Muggle family of yours.’
It certainly was surreal, yes. And Harry wanted to dive in, head-first, and see where these feelings would take them.
Soon enough the quartet began to play, signalling that everyone should find a seat. It was time.
Harry shrugged. “Reckon she’ll be arrested?”
She nodded slowly, and mused, 'Rather fit, isn't he?'
Potter opened the door and barrelled through to the toilet. Before Draco could blink, Potter had already lifted the lid and pulled his... well, cock out and started... urinating. Fast and very, very loudly.
Draco didn't have to remind Harry he was the only one to survive Avada Kedavra—he was the outlier in his argument here. Draco exhaled slow. 'Yes, but try telling some wizards they're going to die one day.'
“Sure. Which just makes me feel weird.”
Draco blinked back at him, momentarily struck dumb by Potter aiming that grin
“Maybe they can help.”
‘No!’
So the rest of the evening passed merrily. Harry’s chest swelled up with love and gratefulness for his friends. They left his flat around 8pm, and Harry relaxed on his couch, with another glass of wine in his hand. He was admittedly a little buzzed.
“Oh. Shit.”
Okay, why was he defending Malfoy?
What would he write to Draco, though? Something like:
If you'd've told Draco at age eleven …
Draco was sat up stiffly in George’s bed wearing a shuttered expression, with a book open on his lap lit only by the light of a table lamp.
them to enjoy it. He hoped it wasn't too spicy or overcooked or anything.
“Yeah.” Ginny snorted. “Did you find out who sent it?”
“Right,” said Malfoy. “Right …” He paused to mull it over. “Ah … yeah, sure. Fuck it, right? Why not. Let’s go to fucking Spain.”
Next up was a group of people in pink fluffy onesies with little ears and nubby tails, flying in on brooms—doing flips and jumping from broom to broom.
Harry shot her a strained smile. “Thanks. Yeah.”
Ginny gripped the crook of Harry’s arm hard, too hard, when they apparated in to the wedding. She’d worn loose red robes, the shade of which clashed with her hair (in Harry’s opinion). He didn’t mind, she’d never been particularly interested in fashion, he supposed. And neither had he, really. Besides, he reminded himself sternly, they weren’t there to impress anyone.
Charity Burbage. Nagini. Voldemort... Screams. Sick laughter. Pain.
Harry released one of his hands from its death grip on the comforter; shoving it between his legs to fist at his cock. His mouth was open against the blanket, mouthing at it—Fuck if he could only kiss Draco,
‘Mm, it’s good. Change is always difficult at first, but one quickly finds variety is the spice of life, you see?’
“Er …" Harry said, watching her rush off. That was awkward.
Draco breathed out in a heavy puff, and chanced a glance at Harry again. Harry had swung his legs off the bed, and was frowning towards Draco's window. Draco wondered if he was thinking the same as him—that this wasn’t going to happen again. That this was goodbye.
Draco’s mouth fixed into a firm line, and they kept on walking.
Harry just stared at Malfoy, baffled by his confidence.
Next Harry began working on the marinade for the chicken, and Draco settled back at the table with his wine and an opened box of chocolate biscuits in front of him. They fell into an easy, comfortable silence, broken up by a few light-hearted comments or questions. It was nice.
Oh … Draco looked for the same type of strap that Harry had. Harry’d—what—produced it from someplace behind his shoulder?
really talked. And anything more would be
Draco blinked at him. ‘It was a faulty potion. Didn’t work.’
'He'd written "Evan, will you marry me?" in the sand.'
It sounded … like the exact opposite of an insult.
Harry couldn’t concentrate on anything else … he couldn’t garden, he couldn’t tidy up around the house, he couldn’t even watch a show on the telly without his thoughts straying to Draco bloody Malfoy.
. We saw loads of cool stuff, even kangaroos!’
He let a sigh escape his lips.
Malfoy looked down at his notes, then back up at Harry. ‘Arithmancy.’
And he'd dozed on the sofa at some point.
'The caterers had leftover pastries,' Draco said, placing the white box on the coffee table. 'Help yourself if you'd like.'
When they burst out the doors, the fresh, cool night air felt fantastic.
He’ll be able to say it, he thinks, eventually.
And now … now Draco knew Potter had it—had better.
Merlin … what if he was overdoing it? What if Malfoy took one look at him and decided he was trying too hard?
Draco tried to manoeuvre his way closer to the stage, but just the sheer number of people … He only managed to get a couple dozen heads back from the stage before everything was just too tightly-packed for him.
He heard a drawer open and close, from the direction of the kitchen.
‘No! What’s this all about, who started it?’
Harry captured Draco’s mouth in another wet kiss, sucking on Draco’s tongue, whilst simultaneously reaching his arm around behind his own arse to take hold of the underside of Draco’s cock—the velvet-soft skin over hard flesh—and pressing it up against himself. Letting Draco fuck between his hand and between his arse cheeks.
Just a general warning to keep in mind: there is swearing
Harry looked from one friend to the other, and back. Feeling rather baffled by this sudden intervention. ‘Truthfully, I actually didn’t think you’d notice I left, it didn’t occur to me to tell you.’
“Come on, we should go back to our room.” Draco nudged Potter’s leg with his knee a bit.
Draco swallowed. He’d never heard that before.
Once dressed and ready to go downstairs, Harry tugged Draco into another quick kiss. When he pulled back, he ran his fingers through Draco’s messy hair to smooth it, and tuck the loose strands behind his ears. Then he planted one more peck on Draco’s lips, like a stamp of approval. Draco let it all happen with a soft smile on his lips.
Malfoy kept hitting it, kept hitting that spot and staring straight into Harry’s eyes.
‘Back at school, I think I had the sense that you weren’t allowed to be yourself, or figure out how you felt about anything, on your own terms. It seemed like you had everything dictated to you, every opinion forced upon you … that you might not’ve known yourself either, like I didn’t.’
“That’s them,” Harry said, scratching his neck under his scarf. It wasn’t a scratchy scarf, he was just … uncomfortable, he supposed.
. Caught staring, Harry rushed to look at Neville, to try to focus on whatever plant-related thing he was saying.
“Mm.”
Harry couldn’t stop watching Malfoy’s face.
Someone passed near the ghost, with big bushy hair, and paused near her new friend.
“Can I...” Harry started carefully. “Could I see them? The scars?”
A warm hand brushed over Draco’s darkened skin. Over his lower back, he felt the startling shifts of soft hand passing over scar tissue to healthy skin and back to scar again. The healthy parts were electrified, breaking out in goose bumps from the gentle touch, and hairs stood on end. Draco had to suppress a shiver, so that he wouldn’t scare Harry off with any jerky movements.
And he also knew what it was like, now, being a disappointment to his family—being a gay son, being the last of the Malfoy line, and a social pariah to boot. He was unable to live up to his family legacy, all those generations of Pureblood prosperity died with him.
Draco pressed his mouth shut.
“I mean, if you want?”
It'd been brilliant.
‘Hello,’ Harry said.
Draco’s eyes caught the back of Potter’s head, his mess of black curls weaving in and out of cars. Draco’s heartrate sped up, just knowing that Potter was going to be upset with him soon.
Once passed the entranceway, Harry stopped abruptly, and Malfoy crashed into his back.
She sighed again, and waved her hand around. “Sure.”
“How much?” Hermione asked, with concern.
“Oh let him be,” Ron interjected.
And ... London.
‘I like it. Your place. It’s homey,’ Harry said. ‘It’s really nice.’
Should Draco be doing something with his arms?
‘You’re blushing,’ Ginny helpfully informed him.
He couldn’t.
Potter shifted and his hair brushed up against the back of Draco’s hand. Draco involuntarily closed his eyes and clenched his hands into fists—for a wild moment he imagined raking his fingers through those curls.
And then Harry found himself lying breathlessly on his back, with Malfoy pinning Harry’s wrists to the bed. Malfoy was breathing heavily, with dark eyes glaring down at Harry.
He’d forgotten to close the curtains, so the sunrise woke Draco up. He stretched and looked over at Potter’s bed. It was still made up. He hadn’t come back last night, then.
‘Guys …' Harry interjected. ‘He said he loves me.’
“Good.” Draco’s little smile was back.
The hallways were narrow, barren, and silent. His trainers padding against the floors were the only sounds. It was a lonely feeling.
Nodding, Harry said, ‘I’ve given it much thought. And I would very much like to be with you, Draco.’
Harry pushed himself up off the sofa, so they were eye-to-eye. His expression turned apologetic, and Draco was quite sure that whatever he was going to say, Draco didn't want to hear it.
‘I was thinking of, perhaps, covering it up with another tattoo. But I know that I deserve the Mark,’ he rushed to add. ‘I deserve to live with my choices, so I should keep it. As punishment. As reminder of all the evil I’ve done, the evil I am …’ He grimaced, and ran both hands through his hair. ‘I should keep it, shouldn’t I?’
“Uncle Harry!” She grinned up at him. Her brown hair had been tied up into two pigtail puffs of curls.
She pinched her mouth when she saw Harry step inside, and beckoned wordlessly for him to sit. The only empty seat was beside Malfoy. Harry approached slowly, and then slunk down into the chair.
‘It can’t have been real, then. This has all been … made up. Some kind of … prank on me ...' Harry shoved the journal in Malfoy’s arms. ‘Stay away from me. Please.’ And he left.
‘I think …' George started. They all stopped what they were doing—stopped eating—and turned to look at him. ‘I think Fred would want a party.’
Harry’s body moved up and down with Draco’s breaths, like a boat riding waves. And … he could feel Draco’s heartbeat. It was … quick. He focused in on Draco’s waiting face.
“Evan James”? That was the name he was going by?
He shrugged again. ‘It isn’t, though.’ And then he ate a piece of broccoli.
He couldn’t lose her. He just couldn’t.
He changed in the bathroom, while Draco changed in the bedroom. The clothes fit well—a little tight in the chest, perhaps. It made Harry wonder, though: how many times had Draco worn that very shirt to bed? Over how many years? Fifteen?
Malfoy pinched the opposite end from where Harry held it, careful not to let their fingers brush.
Astoria raised an eyebrow and smirked. “All right, darling.”
Potter pulled his shorts clean off, stepping out of them. Draco looked away quickly, but not before accidentally catching a bit of Potter’s bare bum.
Draco laughed again. 'Well okay. That's ... good?’ He leant back and held onto his crossed legs. ‘I never thought I'd be talking to Harry Potter about his gay sex life.'
‘No! Don’t—’ Malfoy called out, coming in fast to grab it from him.
'Thank you,' Harry said softly, accepting the gift. 'And Harry's fine.'
Hermione patted his arm, looking at her husband with love in her eyes.
But Malfoy didn’t want to stay soft and slow for long—he licked at Harry’s bottom lip, and then crushed their mouths together—making funny frantic sounds that weren’t quite moans but
Voldemort was dead. Most of the other Death Eaters were either dead or in Azkaban. His thoughts repeated those truths like a mantra.
Draco lifted an eyebrow. (Goddammit—why did this feel like flirting?
Draco grimaced at the butchering of the name, but grabbed the paper cup without comment. “Thanks,” he mumbled again, instead.
‘Yeah, yeah.’
Harry sucked in a breath, it might’ve been a gasp. ‘What are you doing, then?’
Harry blinked at her, not expecting that question. 'Ah. Fine. Er, thanks.'
'Oh,' said Morgan, blinking rapidly. She looked around at the others. 'We won't tell anyone, yeah?'
“Okay, okay … I’ll …"
Draco exhaled all the breath out of his lungs. He knew. ‘I know.’
‘When did you …' There was a real flat.
His toes curled against the linoleum tile.
But it felt amazing. A warm body next to him—rising and falling with breaths. And Malfoy was a nice size for him—not too tall. He fit nicely under Harry’s arm. It’d be a bit better if Malfoy relaxed into it though.
He tried to swallow the lump that’d formed in his throat—but his mouth had gone dry.
“It’s fine. Did you have fun?”
She frowned at him. "Swear to me that you don't have any feelings for Malfoy. And then swear you won't speak to him again. No more contact, no more
‘Never mind that,’ Malfoy said, waving a hand dismissively. He walked the last few paces so that they were standing close, eye to eye. ‘I want you to know that I didn’t kill him.’
“You know, we have napkins.”
After a brief moment, Mei peered around the boy. She seemed so much smaller up close.
Ron just blinked at him, and started to shake his head slowly. Harry thought he might start to protest or chastise him, but Ron clapped him on the shoulder and said, 'Well, that’s great. We just want to see you happy, yeah?'
‘You haven’t demanded to know why I’m here, or whether there’s mentally something the matter with me …'
A hush came over the Great Hall, with everyone turning to see what was going on.
Potter looked absolutely pained by that information. “Why?” he asked under his breath.
He leaned in again, whispering in Draco's ear, 'Dance with me?'
'You want me to take you somewhere?'
, Draco realised.
’ he barked out, before a sniffle, making his words lose some of their bite.
He wanted to hide.
Harry exhaled through his nose. Merlin, he felt so dull compared to Draco. ‘I have good students … I … enjoy teaching.’ He didn’t know what else he could say about it ...
Training had begun, and suddenly Li Shang took off his shirt. Draco had to clamp his mouth shut. He didn’t want to give Potter any more ammunition.
She’d smiled at him, and given them both an open invitation to visit.
Class ended, and the First Years packed up their things and trickled out of the classroom. The ones that spotted Harry greeted him.
After the last student left, Malfoy strode over to the classroom door, and held it open for Harry.
Malfoy groaned, cracking open one eyelid to glare at Harry. ‘Lie down. Tell me about it when I wake up. You bastard.’
He blinked rapidly, coming out of his daze.
Right. He was … home.
'Go ahead.'
“But what will you
Neville slumped against the wall, across from Harry, sinking to the floor. “What if she doesn’t? Then what? We have to break up?”
Potter was silent.
Draco realised with a start that he had a morning erection. Shit. If Potter were to open his eyes right now, he’d see the obvious tenting going on around Draco’s middle.
It still seemed like he was the only one who felt out-of-sorts being back. The Great Hall was full of smiling faces, conversation, and the normal taunts and teasings that came with being a regular teenager. Even the Slytherins, as dwindled in numbers as they were, looked normal. Or as “normal” as they always had been. Blaise Zabini had surrounded himself with younger Slytherin girls; he seemed to be telling them a funny story, because they were all giggling into their hands. And Draco Malfoy was deep in conversation with Pansy Parkinson, looking thoughtful. Harry nibbled a piece of toast, wondered vaguely about what they talked about, until a joke from Seamus captured his attention instead.
'Morning,' Harry answered, rubbing at his face. 'I hadn't intended to sleep with you.'
'Hello,' Harry said, flashing him a radiant smile.
Tears welled up, as he shook his head.
Harry licked his lips. ‘It says …
Draco hurriedly whipped his head back around to face forwards. He didn’t want Potter to catch him staring.
“This was a very good idea.”
'Let go and it'll reset,' Harry said, smiling in the way that made his eyes crinkle shut a bit.
'Harry,' Draco breathed out, ghosting over Harry's cheek. 'Do you know how sexy you are?'
Draco opened his mouth and closed it. He could tell Potter that he’d enjoyed it, but that was pretty close to a confession of... well, affection. And, to put it frankly, he’d rather dance with a Blast-Ended Skrewt. Probably. He took one step closer to Potter’s bed, before remembering his near-nakedness. “You didn’t...” he started. He licked his bottom lip. “You didn’t annoy me. It’s fine. Nothing to apologise for.”
Draco rubbed circles on Harry’s thighs. ‘Slowly,’ he said again.
“No, this is normal.”
'You're very welcome.'
He glanced at it—it seemed like a list of activities, things like: bubble bath, watch a favourite film, light a scented candle. Bit romantic, really.
“Ah,” said Harry, leaning back in the chair. Great.
‘I do,’ Harry said, pleased he could grant Malfoy’s wish. He turned and went back into the kitchen, pulling out the necessary ingredients from the cupboards. ‘Do you want something in them?’ he called out. ‘Chocolate chips? Or … oh, I have frozen blueberries.’
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco was never going to get enough of Harry’s mouth.
“Thanks for dinner,” Harry said, looking at them all once more.
that chastising voice in his head, which sounded annoyingly like Hermione, said. Malfoy had looked like a cornered animal, he was frightened, vulnerable.
His lips were parted a fraction, and Harry imagined himself just leaning forward, pressing his own lips to those. Just getting to see what they felt like … against his.
He refilled his cup, and took a fresh one for Potter. He tossed one last look at Weasley and nodded, and the small gesture was met with a look of curiosity. That was... better. Progress, perhaps.
” she uttered, like the sound of wind.
“Poor girl.”
‘I should … get some sleep,’ Draco said slowly, as if he regretted it.
He sighed as he glanced up. It was a bit overcast and dreary that day, making even the summer's grass more of a dull grey-green. But at least the lemonade was helping them pretend it was sunny and proper warm.
It was done. They pulled apart and Terry looked a little rumpled. He walked back to his seat in a daze.
'Draco …' Pansy said.
Draco exhaled slow.
Harry laughed under his breath, splaying himself over Draco, resting his cheek on the hip closest to him, and his hand on the other.  “
“It’s wonderful, Harry,” Hermione interposed. “We’ll be rooting for you.”
“Er, isn’t that bad? That she tried to scratch you?”
He hadn’t seen the balled-up parchment jerk away at the last moment, before the
Done with the onion and garlic, set in little piles on the cutting board, Harry fished out the frying pan, and set it on the range. Then he went to grab the butter, milk, and eggs from the refrigerator.
But now he felt drained … and off-balance. He wasn’t sure he had the energy for late night talks.
'Morgan is my right-hand woman,' Draco explained.
‘You do?’ Draco breathed.
The next photo was Harry at twelve, Draco was sure of it. So little, yet so relentlessly determined. He licked at his bottom lip, and clicked through.
Malfoy looked back at him, with bright eyes. He
“See you when I get back.”
They got up from the table and went their separate ways. Draco found the door that opened up towards the lake. Fresh autumn air hit him like a brick wall, and he breathed it in deep.
Realising he was (possibly, and only a little bit) obsessing over Malfoy again, he sighed. And made to put the invitation back onto the fridge (why was he still keeping it on the fridge?—a thought for another day, perhaps). His eye caught on the words in small type: ‘Registered at Marks and Spencer’.
'Mr Potter,
—where’d they all come from?), stuffed their mouths with food, and most looked, well, happy.
Harry smiled slightly. 'Yeah.'
The plan was to ignore it all, then? Fine.
And evidently, they’d heard him, because the two of them broke apart like they’d been caught out (which, they had) and looked back. Weasley seemed absolutely horrified to’ve been caught by Draco and Harry—his face turned a very unflattering shade of scarlet, a colour that clashed with his bright orange hair. Blaise, on the other hand, looked very suave and pleased with himself, smiling over at Draco.
‘No, no, Harry. You will want to try it. I’m quite serious.’
Harry thought about that. It sounded reasonable, but, didn’t explain why
‘Oliver Wood,’ said Ron a beat later.
Prying themselves apart, they gathered up their tossed clothes and started to dress. Harry peered over his shoulder to check out Draco’s pale, perky arse. He could probably touch that arse, Draco would let him … maybe he’d even get to bite it.
He felt positively giddy with it.
“No thank you.”
Disclaimer #1:
weird.
“So don’t,” Harry said in a breath. “Just … can you let me talk for a minute? You don’t have to say anything.”
He should really fill the window box with flowers, Harry thought. As it stood, it held soil with a few limp weeds that’d managed to make it a home.
“I got hurt, but I’m okay now.”
'It's … a more recent development.'
a former Death Eater?
Harry laughed.
Harry smiled. ‘I do.’
Ah, shit. Harry might’ve crossed a line, there. And ruined their little back-and-forth.
Harry saw him exhale slow, and his posture relax, out of the corner of his eye.
She nodded. ‘And he wouldn’t give Harry away to Voldemort, even though it would’ve been very good for his family.’
be within the realm of possibilities. You don’t really cook, right?’
“Part of growing up is un-learning what we’ve been taught, isn’t it?” Potter said thoughtfully.
Harry shrugged, like it wasn’t a big deal. “I noticed you don’t decorate much, so I thought you might like a plant.”
Harry returned with a tray of drinks, sinking into his seat. He tossed a small smile at Draco. But Draco forgot to return it, he was studying Harry's face.
‘Yeah.’ Harry shrugged, searching their faces. He didn’t understand any of this. They never seemed to care what he was up to.
He could hear Voldemort’s laughter so clearly in his mind. Draco’s fingers clenched at the linen tablecloth, bunching it up in his fists.
Draco exhaled and slumped back in his chair, rubbing at his face with one hand. (Should Harry not have asked?)
had seen Harry’s Mind Healer. And
Draco tried, and failed, to hold back a beaming smile. It made Harry's heart lurch. 'We can have a big dinner. Decorate a tree together.'
“What’s this, Potter, passing notes in class?” Draco did his best to sneer. He looked down at the note—confirming what it was. That sodding awful sonnet. How did the ghost—Potter tried to grab it back, Draco dodged him.
“What is it?”
'Excellent,' said Angelpreet. 'Now let's add our first friend. See the search bar at the top of the webpage? Start typing a name of someone you know, and options should begin to pop up. Now make sure you know it's the right person—as many people could share the same name. The profile photo is a clue, as well as their location.'
He was crying—
Draco stopped, and turned to find the concierge holding a hand in the air. Frowning, Draco approached the desk, and Harry trailed after him. 'Yes?'
‘Oi! Don’t go getting any ideas!’ Seamus joked.
The spray of the shower stopped, and Harry heard some shuffling in there, some things being moved around.
Harry bit his lip to keep from grinning too big. ‘Ah. That sounds nice.’ Then, for good measure, he kissed Draco.
He rubbed his face. Then, scooped up the letters into a pile, and tucked them into his inner pocket. He went to his quarters to grab his thick tweed cloak—since it was colder out at night lately—and promptly walked out of the castle.
His black curls bounced, eyes squeezed shut, as Potter mouthed the words to the song.
Potter smiled at Draco, like the two of them were sharing a secret, and they disappeared with a pop.
Potter’s hand, his mind helpfully pointed out. A warm and heavy weight over his.
Because … because they were both very much drunk and it didn't do to kiss. Not here. Not now. (If that was what Harry was thinking—it may
The house elf bowed, beaming, while squeaking, ‘You’re most welcome,’ before disappearing back into a kitchen nook or cranny someplace.
And then in class, he couldn’t concentrate. Sure enough, whenever he looked over at Potter, Potter looked sad. Deflated. Dejected. It made no sense.
. Are you completely insane? Haven’t you paid attention to the Muggle news at all in the last ten years?’ Draco shook his head. ‘No, of course you haven’t. You haven’t changed at all, then. Always running headfirst into things, paying no mind to the consequences.’
Potter’s mouth looked a little wobbly. ‘
Letting out a moan, Draco squeezed his eyes shut and his body arched upwards involuntarily, as he gripped at Harry’s thighs with his fingernails, raking them over Harry’s skin. Just the sight of Draco like this—losing abandon—was the most erotic thing Harry had ever seen.
Morgan laughed. 'Little weird. But cute.'
Potter placed the cup back in Draco’s hands. Draco brought it up to his mouth as if automatically, and took a sip, closing his eyes.
Draco felt Potter’s eyes on him. “I’ll save us a table.”
‘Harry?’ came Ron’s voice again, louder now, concerned and groggy.
Harry smiled against Draco’s lips.
“Me too,” Harry said, through a breathy laugh.
The only real issue might be getting meat to eat. Draco didn’t know if he could muster killing a living thing... not again.
(See the end of the chapter for
They clinked their little glasses, and said a round of "salud". Draco downed his, and found it tasted pleasantly of coconut, and didn't seem too boozy at all. It was nice.
There was one last breakfast before the Hogwarts Express would take them back to London.
She stared at him like she was trying to unravel a puzzle. “I thought Potter would’ve told you.”
He was stirring the onions, with a wooden spoon, when he registered that Draco was beside him. Harry’s heart rate sped up just at the knowledge of it. He glanced at Draco, wine glass in hand, frowning down at the browning onions.
As soon as the door banged shut, Draco set his book down and gripped the edge of the sink. He took a deep breath. What was he playing at—having lunch with Potter?
Rather than hearing him, Harry could read Malfoy’s lips, saying, “Excuse me,” to his friends, before carefully making his way over, closer to Harry.
, hmm? Tell me everything.'
Draco nodded. Seemed reasonable.
Another splash.
‘Oh,’ Harry rubbed at his neck. ‘Er, yeah. That all started when we were eleven. An old habit, I suppose.’
“Not that it’s any of your business—but they’re not like the other notes I get.”
‘Thank you,’ Draco murmured into his neck.
As usual, Harry and Hermione had settled into a couple stuffed chairs in the back corner, a bit away from everyone else. It felt private. But this time Harry had trouble concentrating on what Hermione was saying. He was trying not to stare across the room at Draco Malfoy, who was very quietly reading a thick book by the hearth. Malfoy tucked a strand of white-blond hair behind an ear, and turned a page.
This felt like an important moment to Harry. He could tell Malfoy to keep it, to live with the proof of what he had been, and what he had done, right there on his skin. Never able to forget, and, perhaps never able to forgive himself.
“Why didn’t you go to Seamus and Dean’s party last night?”
Hi ❤️
And by the time of the climax of the film—when Bill and Jo were driving directly
Malfoy just watched his eyes, in a bit of an awe.
“Harry.”
‘Leave your situations at the door, so when you step inside, jump on the floor.’
‘Good.’ She eyed him with her mouth pinched to the side, then let out a long sigh. ‘Ah, why did I even think to show you this,
Like he had just kissed Terry.
“You saved me, though, in the end. You have to realise that, don’t you? You came back for me... in the Room of Requirement. I still don’t understand why you would do that... I guess it’s thanks to your unfailing chivalry and overall goodness.” Draco huffed a laugh, and glanced at Harry, who was staring back with wet, unreadable eyes.
“Malfoy?” Longbottom had noticed him.
It was the sort of light that made you squint when you looked right into it, and cast sharp shadows on the books that weren’t in its path.
“Harry …" Hermione started.
He picked up speed, sucking Harry in and out, in and out, tentatively swirling his tongue, lapping at him, experimenting. And Harry just kept moaning, kept sucking him. The friction—perfect. Everything—perfect.
'Anyway,' said Harry. 'I think it's time for the next round.' He stood up, and eyed Draco's half-empty glass. 'Another?'
That was … that was …
Draco laughed, against Harry's jaw. 'So, about thirty minutes into our Ibizan reunion, then?'
Harry wanted to do it again. And soon.
As they neared, no one turned to stare at him. No one seemed bothered at all by his presence. Well, not yet, anyway. It was still early to truly assess.
‘Have you been to a supermarket before?’ Harry wondered aloud, as they entered the produce section. There was something odd about Draco Malfoy doing something as normal and unremarkable as shopping for groceries. But it was dawning on Harry that Draco really was a proper regular person, rather than some redeemed cartoon villain or misguided victim or posh viscount who sat up in his mansion and had everything served to him. Harry felt a nagging of guilt that he’d ever suspected Draco capable of nothing more than any of that.
A loud cry, hot liquid shooting into Harry’s mouth—and Harry swallowing it all down, letting Malfoy ride out his orgasm with Harry’s mouth.
‘I really do not want to intrude—’ Draco hissed.
As they were exiting the stairs from the Headmistress’s office, Harry swung his rucksack over one shoulder, and bumped into Draco on purpose, lightly. ‘So. Will you knit me one of your blankets? It’s always freezing at my house.’
Sure, granted, he
Malfoy had Muggle
. I had nothing to do with this scheme, I’m—I’m the victim!’
“Hey.”
A choking sound escaped Draco’s lips, before he could help it.
‘Harry,’ she said sternly, ‘did Malfoy look like he’d been having you on when you figured out the truth? Did he laugh and say, “Gotcha”?’
Fuck—he slumped back against the counter and stared at the pile of letters strewn about the table. He hadn’t mean for it all to blow up that way—he'd thought they could have a proper conversation. Though, he realised they hadn’t been very good at those for a long time.
Luna’s eyes sparkled as she clapped her hands together loudly. ‘Oh it was
And so they all ate at the Gryffindor table, and no one got in a fight or anything. It was pleasant, actually. Harry kept shooting Draco these soft, smiling glances.
Malfoy’s hands flitted over Harry’s chest—his face twisted up in pleasure. ‘Oh fuck.’
“Yes!” Harry gripped on to Malfoy’s biceps.
‘You missed a few things,’ Ron said.
Harry found it fascinating to watch, like having live entertainment during meals. For example, there was Pansy Parkinson, looking mean and saying something with a sour twist to her mouth, and then the two Hufflepuff girls on either side of her were bursting out into giggles. Pansy would smile with satisfaction, though the smile was tiny and easy to miss.
People laughed. Harry smiled weakly, and made his way back to his spot beside Luna. He was quite determined to avoid looking at that arsehole Malfoy again.
Laughing, Draco carried Astoria through the threshold of their hotel room—Astoria had insisted on it, on both those elements: being carried, and the hotel room. Something about a Muggle tradition she liked, as, rather than going home, they were someplace special for the night. They could order room service, and not have to worry about tidying up.
They walked into the hotel, side by side.
A soft breeze ruffled his hair, and it felt rather nice. He wondered if he might keep his hair natural like this. Slicked-back was pre-war Draco’s style—harsh and aristocratic. And he wasn’t like that anymore.
Astoria looked at his cock, and hesitated for a beat, then she licked it. A small lick, just a flick of her tongue, really. He held back another flinch. Salazar, he was so tense—every muscle seemed to be bracing for something bad to happen.
'The Lord of the Rings. Have you seen it?' Harry nodded. 'It's absolutely
‘Cry me a river!’ he shouted back—he was getting the hang of the song. The French girl grinned.
So many people had just died. It almost didn’t seem real, yet.
He wanted sleep. He needed to put this day to rest and start new tomorrow.
. Met a bloke who claims to be Evan's
‘Mmhmm,’ he said. ‘Snogging, for example.’
The kettle whistled, Malfoy poured the water into their mugs, and brought them both to the table.
‘Please.’
They meandered about, eventually finding themselves inside an old church,
‘Are you all out of questions?’ Draco asked, sounding amused, perhaps even … fond.
'So there wasn't much in the way of security, and Pansy thought it might be nice to have a talk with them. So we wandered around back, with me telling her I wanted to leave, as you can right imagine.' He puffed his cheeks. 'And Pansy chatted up an acrobat, then a few others meandered over. And … Rodney.'
‘Sometimes. But Draco was kind to us. He brought tea and biscuits and talked with us. He tried to reassure us, that you were going to defeat Voldemort soon and we’d all be free again.’
He flinched.
‘Alright,’ Draco replied breathily. He removed his fingers slowly, then, positioned his own cock to be right underneath Harry’s arsehole. ‘Just, sit down slowly. Try to keep your arse relaxed.’
“I … do.” Draco’s heart couldn’t pound any harder.
‘Ah—’ Draco threw his head back, and spun around in place, searching for it. ‘There.’ He pointed.
But he didn’t dare say anything, in fear of starting an argument.
people. But those people can eat dragon dung, if you ask me.’
it.” She gave a little twirl to show it off. It certainly was … bright and ridiculous.
“A ghost?” Hermione asked, her face twisting up in confusion. “A ghost is bringing Harry love notes? Well that just doesn’t make sense. Ghosts can’t write.”
Draco’s gaze snapped to him.
His thoughts switched to Draco. He realised he might like to have Draco around too. For some of those moments—holidays, events … Harry just liked talking to him. He wanted to know things about Draco—what he liked, what he disliked, what he hoped, what he feared … Draco was just so … bloody … something …
‘Match your breaths to mine.’
into Draco’s neck, panting, speeding up his hand movements.
‘This conversation could’ve been a lot more straightforward, I’ll have you know,’ Draco muttered.
Harry closed his eyes again, snuggling nearer to Malfoy’s warmth.
Maybe he was bored without Neville around. That was probably it.
He turned it over in his hands—it was wrapped neatly in brown paper, and tied with string. There was no return address or sender’s name, just a carefully written: “Professor Harry Potter at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, care of International Owl Post Office, London, UK.” It was rather curious.
'Hello,' said a grey-haired dark-skinned man, nodding around the room. 'I'm Bert, and I'm taking this class so I can learn to use the Facebook. My daughter Sara is pregnant with her first, and I'd like to be able to see all the photographs once the baby comes.'
'Who is the lady of the snows?' Draco asked softly. There was no one in sight, but it still felt as if they should keep their voices down. He wasn't sure why.
—that Draco found freeing. The tightly coiled metal chain in his chest loosened. It felt so good, he took another deep breath.
Draco bit his lip to keep from smiling too much. He chanced a glance at his wife, who was looking back at him with amusement, and a lifted eyebrow.
A lump formed in Draco’s throat, and the backs of his eyes began to sting. He blinked rapidly, and clenched and unclenched his hands, willing himself to be rational about this—and failing.
“He did.”
They sat out in chairs by the lake; Harry, Ginny, Hermione and Ron together. It was a beautiful summer’s day: the sun was shining bright amidst fluffy clouds and blue sky, it shone over the vibrant green grass, and sparkling, still lake. The merpeople sang. Someone Harry didn’t know spoke a eulogy. Dumbledore’s body was entombed, and arrows were fired into the air.
Harry sheepishly shrugged. “Ron’s co-worker recommended it—”
He turned, and found Harry behind him, lowering his camera slowly, wearing a soft smile on his face. 'Harry—'
Draco smiled. “I’ll get the door. Tell you what, if you need to get dressed, I’ll shout the code word: marmalade.”
Harry blinked, his eyes coming in to focus on the journal in his hand. He looked from the journal to Malfoy, and back again.
“Yes. The man you used to stalk through the halls. The man you’d stare at and shout insults back and forth from
They finally broke away, and Terry,
‘I didn’t scheme.’
. Well, like I said, I’m fine. And I’d like to get to work on the potion now.’
Harry stared down at the menu, then glanced up at Malfoy, who was shaking his head again studying his menu. But a small smile played on his lips. Harry bit his, just looking at Malfoy.
Harry shrugged.
'Dave's excited to meet you,' Harry murmured. He cleared his throat and fixed Draco with a serious look. 'Just remember I'm Evan, and um, I don't really talk about my life in the UK.'
And … nothing. No response.
‘Okay. Yeah. Yeah … I shouldn’t’ve come.’
,’ she said wearily. ‘And, no, you’d need an internet connection to watch your unrequited love’s videos.’
Malfoy shook his head, but said, “Fine.” And moved closer to the bins.
It landed on Terry Boot.
“Ellie!” they choked out.
,’ emphasized Neville.
Hermione shrugged. ‘Think about it. He'd been on the losing side of the war; he’d made poor choices and it nearly killed him and his family. Now he’s getting attacked by younger years, by kids? And Harry of all people, the Saviour of the Wizarding World, the person whom Malfoy once thought himself equal to, has to be the one to witness it? Has to come rushing in, ready to easily fix everything as always? It’s embarrassing. It’s a matter of pride.’
Draco rolled his eyes. ‘You weren’t supposed to
After breakfast, Harry went to the library, since he had a free period and he had nothing better to do, apparently.
'What brings you to our charity function? I thought you were on the lam,' Morgan asked.
He spluttered, 'Harry
. All this talk about him, but ... “You know, if you wanted to seek physical … ah, satisfaction elsewhere, that would be … acceptable.”
Eventually it got so late, and his essay was finished, so he closed the journal up, and went to bed.
He’d … he’d never had a kiss like this before.
Draco didn’t know what to say to that, so he opened up the letter in his hand.
Draco pushed the key into the keyhole and turned. It clicked and the door swung open to reveal his flat—just as it always was. His shoes were exactly where he'd left them on the mat, his coats on their hooks. He took a step inside, and shut the door softly behind himself.
“Can I help you, sir?” she asked cheerfully.
'Left me here for a couple hours yesterday, didn't you? I saw your CDs.' Harry smiled, but it had a tinge of sadness.
So, Draco allowed Harry to loop his arm through his, and Side-Alonged him to outside Draco's flat.
“Er, do your parents know?” Potter asked, peering up at Draco from behind his eyelashes.
Oh … 'So no grand announcement at my charity function, hmm? It'd make the papers.'
So Draco sipped his wine, and listened to "4 Seasons of Loneliness" set to repeat. He wasn't overly maudlin or anything. Well … maybe a little. But it was overall a nice-sounding song.
But just imagining it now … putting himself in Draco’s shoes …
They reached the front doors, and Malfoy pushed them open, holding the door for Harry to pass through.
Malfoy exhaled, averting his eyes, and leant back. Harry’s hand dropped from his arm.
'We didn't like each other much in the early years,' Harry stepped in. 'But we got to know and understand each other better in our senior years.'
‘Yeah.’
Smiling, Harry draped the blanket across both of their legs. It was so soft and
‘And everything I was going through, all those conflicting emotions—some of which I tried desperately to bury—combined into something very ugly … and that was Fifth year for me. Ugly anger. Resentment. Jealousy.’ He gathered pebbles into his palm and shifted them around. ‘And the summer after Fifth year, I found myself on a crash course towards … well. There seemed to be no getting out of it. I'm sorry, you probably don’t want to hear about—’
"Pansy Parkinson liked Evan James's status: New Video Up."
“Oh! Hey mate,” said Ron, flashing him a grin over his shoulder. “I’d hug you but the sauce might bubble over.”
Harry pushed his chair back. ‘I’m going to lunch.’
Malfoy’s silvery eyes stared up at him. ‘You would make an Unbreakable Vow?’
‘You were in there?’ Potter asked, eyebrows raised, nodding at the building behind Draco.
He was still a bit slow with emails, but if he went slow, he usually got the job done properly. First step was to bring up a blank email. He found the "new message" button and clicked.
“Oh, my parents are in France. It was going to be too hard to go visit this year.”
'Yeah?' Harry asked. It was nothing like an heirloom cookbook, though.
'And you've aimed high,' she said with wide-eyes. 'So. Does he like you back?'
‘Well … alright.’ Draco rubbed at his forehead, and looked around. ‘There isn’t much room in here, maybe if I move the bed a little closer to the wall …'
Astoria’s eyebrows lifted in surprise. “It seemed like you were having fun together.”
‘Ready,’ Harry said to Dave.
Malfoy pulled his head up to look at him again—eyes wide and bright. “You really want this?”
“See you down there!” Potter called out, interrupting Draco from his train of thought.
Harry was just stepping out the door with a bagel hanging out of his mouth, and a travel mug full of coffee in hand, when an owl intercepted him—landing on his shoulder.
Draco was already there, with his back to Harry, leaning up against the railing. Looking out over at the grounds below. The moon was in waxing gibbous, high in the sky, casting the right side of Draco’s body in a soft light. He wore something dark, but the lower half of his legs were bare, save for some thick, woolly socks.
“Sure,” said Harry. “And I’ll shower. You’ll wait for me? We’ll go down for breakfast?”
Salazar. This was much harder, knowing Potter would read it, knowing it was from Draco.
bad, and sent it off.
“Oh, okay.” Harry found he was relieved. He wouldn’t have to miss another holiday with his best friends.
‘Do you like regular coffee?’
Harry nodded solemnly, and took another bite of dumpling, allowing Draco to continue, if he wanted.
Harry swivelled in his chair, holding the parcel protectively to his chest. “Not
“Why are you holding a potted plant?”
Harry blinked at his best friend, frowning. Okay, maybe saying anything
It was so immediately different from the Hogwarts courtyard, that it left Draco feeling disoriented.
He leaned over towards Luna. ‘I’m really tired, I’m gonna go back.’
Draco took one look at the menu, and couldn't read it. 'Order for me?'
Kandi - Don't Think I'm Not
Harry relaxed into a compartment with Neville, stretching his legs out with a sigh. Neville eyed him.
Which was a shame, because it was waffle day and Harry usually loved waffle day.
Draco turned around. Harry could see the toes of his shoes pointing towards him. ‘Harry,’ Draco said again, lower now. Softer. ‘Is that why you won’t tell me? You think whatever it is would jeopardise our friendship? Well I’ve got news for you …' He huffed a laugh at himself. ‘I’ve wanted to be your friend for seven years. Now that I finally have you, I’m not giving you up easy.’
Harry moved carefully to lie beside Draco, letting the soft cock slide out of him slowly. Draco leaned over and kissed Harry on the forehead, and leaned farther over to pick up his wand from the nightstand.
‘Fuck,’ Harry muttered under his breath. It was all true. He’d attacked Draco, gotten detention with Snape, missed Quidditch, and kissed Ginny. All in 24 hours. He’d never even considered … He’d never thought to …
Draco was the first to say ‘I love you,’ on an unremarkable snowy Sunday morning, after coming back from a brisk walk with the castle doors just a few strides away—when Harry’s nose was red from the cold, and Draco just had to say it. Couldn’t wait a moment longer.
‘It doesn’t make any sense. This person,’ he said, lifting the journal, ‘wouldn’t fight twelve-year-olds.’
Harry slumped over, resting his forehead against the edge of Draco’s desk.
He lifted his head up, looking Harry in the eye. He looked terribly raw; his eyes bright and near tears. ‘For everything.’ He managed a wobbly smile, and brought a palm up to Harry’s cheek ‘For being here with me, through all of this. I’m so bloody grateful for—you.’ His voice broke on “you”. Draco’s eyes seemed wet.
'You're welcome,' Draco said politely, with a little self-satisfied smile.
and have hundreds of
Draco’s eyes found the source of the voice—a wide-eyed, curly black-haired Hufflepuff was clumsily making her way over to the ghost, stumbling and using people’s shoulders for support as she made her way over.
Harry was floating, everything fuzzy around the edges. Panting, he came back into himself, slowly.
Harry was determined not to stare at Malfoy, so he leaned back and set his scuffed converse on the bench in front of them.
Harry felt his feet taking him closer to Malfoy, all on their own. So, without hesitation, he plopped his bag down across from where Malfoy was studying, making Malfoy jump.
It’d just sort of come out. He wanted to know the answer though, quite badly, because … he couldn’t fathom why his ex-rival would ever even have thought to.
'Sure.'
Harry grabbed Malfoy by the hand, and pulled him into an alcove. Malfoy looked blankly at their joined hands.
“Seriously, he’s a bit fit. Like … minorly fit, in my opinion. You know, like a six out of ten at best. His hair’s a mess, he wears the same type of glasses he had when he was eleven …"
Harry sucked his thumb into his mouth. Draco gasped. Because... because Harry was sucking on it like it were a cock. And staring back at him, as if daring him. Merlin...
“Draco,” Pansy interrupted with a frown. “You are coming to this bonfire and that’s final.”
Anything? ‘What were the stickers?’
Sure enough, Blaise had intercepted her and was currently leading her back towards the main building, with a torch guiding their way.
Draco frowned, and exhaled a deep sigh. 'Harry Potter.'
“Because Pansy knows I fancy you, and knew I’d never do anything about it—because you’re much too good for me, and I’d never be able to make up for everything I’ve—”
“I didn’t—” he started to say, too quiet to reach Malfoy’s ears through the door, probably. He sighed again. What was he supposed to do, shout that Professor Vector was a paranoid arsehole through the door? Shout that Harry didn’t think Malfoy was a criminal through the door? It was ridiculous. All of this was. And he had a lesson plan to write, and twenty papers to mark.
‘Harry!’
” he answered, leaning up to kiss Malfoy’s mouth. Softer this time. Malfoy melted into it for a beat—before stiffening and pulling back again.
‘Ah, right.’
‘Of course,’ Harry answered. At this point, he’d do anything she asked of him.
‘Harry. I know you’re in there.’
He led them to the public bathroom, before dropping Draco’s arm. Draco followed Potter inside, rubbing at his Dark Mark through his shirtsleeve.
She frowned, opening her eyes—finally—to looked them both up and down appraisingly. “Come to chat, have we? I was
Harry suppressed an eyeroll.
Draco nodded, and stepped into the room to rummage around in his dresser. Harry watched, feeling uncertain, himself.
Draco laughed, feeling a shiver travel up his spine from Harry's breath on his ear. He took a sip, and yeah, Harry was right. It was fruity, and not too sweet. Didn't taste boozy at all.
to Hermione? But just a few weeks ago, you were hexing me, telling me to fuck off, telling me I have a Hero Complex, telling me no one needs me to save them.’
“Right, um, dear,
Draco laughed.
Another pause.
“No,” Draco managed to answer, clenching his fists.
“My foot is in the mud!”
A beat played, and Harry bobbed his head in time as he shimmied backwards to get his entire body in the frame. Grey t-shirt and those rather-small red shorts.
“Right. Yeah. S’pose.”
He felt good. Quite good.
Harry was beginning to suspect Hermione had an ulterior motive to all these interruptions.
'I'm sorry I annoyed you.'
Harry bit at his lip. “Never”? Surely it’d be nice if
He nodded. “They look great.”
“Yeah?”
'Sure.'
Well, time to get ready for work, he thought glumly, as he pulled himself up. His limbs felt like cement. Hadn't slept much or very well, evidently.
Harry tilted his head so their cheeks pressed together. His breath came in heavy bursts against Draco's ear. 'Draco Malfoy,' he said under his breath, and there was a hint of amusement and disbelief in his voice.
'Harry's mate. Dave.'
Harry turned to him. 'Er, yeah. We're, um, well, we decided to be boyfriends … as of last night.'
Draco glanced at her—and she smiled back at him, like she was amused by his behaviour. “Well, all right.”
Pansy returned a moment later with a paperback, one of those types featuring an overly-muscled long-haired man with a tiny large-chested woman in his arms. She cleared her throat and sunk down into her chair, opening it up to the bookmark.
She barked out a laugh. 'Fat chance, there. I imagine after an hour we'd both be ripping our hair out. No, I'm signing you up for a class—one of those classes full of grannies. You'll love it.'

Harry wouldn’t be surprised if he did. Draco seemed clever enough to learn other languages.
