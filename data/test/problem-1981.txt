It was an interesting day to wake up on, June 21, the day Dumbledore died. It was a Saturday, but that meant little in the ascetic purgatorial existence Draco was living here at Grimmauld. Breakfast and lunch by himself, save their serving by a superlatively glowering Kreacher, dinner early with Sirius and Remus come back from Xaphan, rather quiet and grim as always, and Draco with no way to explain the unaccountable anxiety that Saturday's date happened to put in him. Well, if Dumbledore died tonight, it wouldn't be because of Draco this time.
"Aguamenti!" Draco yelled, and stressed into the spell, but found its pretty, clear stream barely strong enough to reach the chain. "Aqua eructo duo! Aqua eructo duo!" Draco tried, and the chain swayed harder, water dripping down its glimmering links, but showed no sign of budging. Father had stepped up on the threshold of the door to the cellar room, to keep his shoes from getting wet or his person from behind hit by the spray, before casting a shield charm on himself with a wrinkled nose. "Aqua eructo duo!" Draco cast a last time, and the blast rebounded so hard off the cellar walls that it soaked both Draco and Periander to the bone.
"I don't!" Potter protested, not getting red the way he should have if he was at all lying. "I don't know where you even got that idea..."
She looked to feel some of that frustration. "It is a real puzzle. And there's just no clear answer... Even if Aberforth did know, it would make the most sense for him to lie if it had been him, for his own sake. But he might for his brother as well, fallout or not- or even for
"Oh, yes, Basilisk Brew is delicious," Luna said happily. She tried to support Ron, before he doubled over and puked all over the floor outside Slughorn's office. "Don't feel bad, Ron, I almost had that reaction too. And I only had half a cup..."
"Hurry it up," Draco said, casting a nervous glance over to Luna. Hermione had heard the story of the Sordespiro ritual, but Luna hadn't, and generally the less dark magic stories they told Luna, the better. Even if she looked dreadfully fascinated all of a sudden. "What did he want from you?"
win more than lose them in the long run. I won't do anything dangerous in the dorm, I won't get any of you in trouble, and I envision our relationship as congenial. Collegiate, even. Perfectly civil to all, if I receive civility in return-"
"Tell me what you think," Draco said, and handed her the sheet. She uncrumpled it, then let out a high-pitched shriek.
"Now open your book at page two hundred and thirteen, Mr. Black," Severus said, face blank as he spoke the name, "And read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus curse..."
of great ideas, you'll see, so at least stick around long enough to meet with her, alright? I'll sneak out of the castle and bring you extra food- well, not this weekend, because it's Easter holidays and I have to go home, but after that I will, you'll see..."
Lupin looked at their new captive, then at his students, safe and ready for defense against the darkest of arts. He turned to Black and touched Black's hollow, sunken chest, hand smoothing down over it. "Sirius. Oh, Sirius, I'm
Hagrid was pleased although unsurprised to see them, since a lonely Hermione had apparently been visiting him a great deal after Potter and Ron's rejections. They had to lead Padfoot past a suspicious-looking Buckbeak, who was chained at the neck awaiting judgment. Maybe they should have leashed Padfoot, but the look Padfoot had given Hermione when Draco first suggested conjuring one had suggested it would be more trouble than it was worth.
Hermione hugged him goodbye so fiercely at the door to the Leaky Cauldron, Draco was squirming to get away by the time she was through. "I'm going to be so bored now that you're gone," she sighed before letting him go. Draco scoffed at her, though he feared the same.
"And here we have six missing Death Eaters... three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return... he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever... he will be killed, of course..."
Dantanian had no need to conduct the circle of flame. No reason to perform when Dementors were his audience. He merely had to lift his hand, and the flame compressed and grew higher from itself, so tall it almost bent back in towards him. It looked ready to form a protective half-sphere, like a broken shell. But every Dementor in Azkaban had already become nothing but an impotent shadow behind his fire.
"So you don't deny it." Dantanian's knuckles turned to white around his wand. "I wouldn't have believed you if you tried."
Bellatrix's laugh echoed throughout the vast halls as she called out for what sounded to be Luna. It was objectively hilarious that she didn't even know Luna's name. Mother must not have thought Luna important enough to tell the other Death Eaters about her. Draco pushed aside the thought that Mother might not have, on purpose, in order to
"Here's my eldest, Bill, he's a Curse-Breaker," she said proudly. "Our next-oldest, Charlie, is a dragontamer in Romania, he couldn't make it all the way back." A shadow crossed her eyes. "Then there's Percy. He works for the Ministry, he couldn't be here either. Here's the twins, Fred and George, they're... they're twins. Here's Ron, he was made prefect this year! And here's our youngest Ginny, she's only a fourth-year, but she's quite the accomplished witch already... and you must be
fault!" Hermione exclaimed, turning on him with such unprovoked vehemence, it was no wonder he'd been slightly cowering already. "Luna has been more than open about how she feels about him! It's humiliating for her to keep putting herself out there if he never reciprocates! It must make her feel so unwanted, like he doesn't even like her at all!"
Ron looked between them for a long moment, and then his face seemed to fall open, and he shook his head. "Bloody hell. I've been such a pillock, haven't I?"
?" Severus said sharply. "Is this what has given you delusions of grandeur to such ill effect?" When Draco told Severus all about Pammaque Periander and his bird, Severus stalked clean out of the room. His bellow of
Hermione looked at him, nodding with her eyes full of misgiving, and Draco took a deep breath. "If Aunt Bella gets out of Azkaban, I'm not sitting around waiting for her to come after us. I'm going to hunt her down and kill her myself."
"Harry," Draco said shortly, "Not gonna happen. You know how I feel about public displays of affection-"
Hagrid stared at him, for such a long time that Draco began to consider the possibility Hagrid might set some massive spider beast on him. But when his voice finally came croaking out, he sounded more like the one in danger. "What 'as yer father told yeh?"
"The Triwizard Tournament. Even goblins read the Daily Prophet," Griphook grumbled, and the vault came open, like the shadow in front of a cavern suddenly dropping away.
"Oh, wouldn't it be nice if they just got back together already?" Luna complained shamelessly to Neville, loud enough that Padma and Tony could likely hear from across the room. "If this is what we were like when we were broken up, Neville, I'm astonished no one took drastic measures."
"I would do anything," Draco said steadily, "To keep those nine names alive walking around the world, above the ground. If dark magic taints me, if it
is the hole in the world where magic goes to die. Now give me a kiss, little one. Are you so aggrieved by some pretty marks on your wrist now?"
"Oh- I hadn't thought of- no, I wouldn't tell on Draco, though," Neville stammered, looking eager to assert his loyalties. "Nor on any of you-"
It had been in his mind since the second he stepped under this roof. He made sure to groom himself and dress for the task, rather than wandering down to Grimmauld's entry hall in his pajamas. He had to look the part of House Black's heir. And besides, the person he had to speak to had a weakness for men with long hair- men of his blood, and young.
"We live in the Muggle world, Maman," Dantanian said slowly, looking to try and show off his understanding, "Because you like to do Muggle art, and not wizard art?"
His mind was on Umbridge as he sat down at dinner that night, a rather hilarious miscalculation of threat levels. He was soon dragged back to the real darkness on the horizon, by the animal that flew overhead to hover malevolently for at least thirty whole seconds before dropping a letter. It would have seemed an Augurey, were it not pitch-black, eyes, beak, everything. Maybe a dyed or enchanted Augurey. It matched the package it dropped right before Draco, before it raced as far as it could from the object in a great flash of dark rings. The package could not properly be called a letter, actually: a scroll at best, a small one, tied with black twine to the roughly cut flare of the quillion on an unpolished obsidian dagger. There was carving on the side of the hilt, right over the cannelure, in deep letters that read DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY.
"You only ask me this now?" Severus asked dryly. "I would have thought you on high alert after those events the last letter referenced. I am here, naturally, to speak to you of them."
But he felt his anger almost drowned under shock. It was not Dumbledore but Severus who had held the real answers. It was like he needed to go back in the past
Although his omission of the identity of the wielder of the walking sticks, to both his back and face, made him fear they would assume his father the culprit in both cases. They looked appalled when they heard he had been forbidden healing potions, as if this proved a terrible legacy of abuse. They both said Severus had done the right thing, bringing him early to the care of Hogwarts.
"None of the Slytherins would say what was going on," Potter explained, "But all they all looked so grave and worried. It freaked us out- Hermione too- it was like someone had died-"
Severus left them alone, and it was not long before Draco was bustled up to his bedroom for some much-needed rest, and the ominous echo of Severus from Remus that they would
In a class of only the nine fifth-year Slytherins, everyone could hear her loud and clear. Draco gritted his teeth and kept his head down, but it was hard to ignore the awkwardness in the air, as Vince answered after a confused moment, "Yeah, totally."
And clearly, whatever manner of interaction he and Granger had shared, it bore nothing remotely akin to the nature of friendship. At least on
and a poorly drawn sketch of a dark-haired boy with glasses strangling a silver dragon with his bare hands.
"Oh!" Harry said suddenly. "I forgot! The headmaster wanted me to thank you for passing on Grindelwald's gift. Do you know what that means?"
Write me no more letters. We cannot afford for them to be intercepted. I am also far too busy to indulge you. We will see each other daily at Hogwarts soon enough, impatient boy.
," Harry groaned, mortified, while Gryffindor cheered and Hufflepuff booed. He buried his face in his hands, only to grab Draco's arm when he added,
He found the spacious, airy common room full of Ravenclaws, none of whom seemed over-pleased to see the student who had lost them 300 points personally. Another lesser pariah would presumably have been Luna, for the 50 points as well as by association, but she was nowhere in sight, nor did anyone have news to impart of her whereabouts. They all looked as though they'd sooner spit on him than help him, granted, but he did manage to ascertain she wasn't in her dorm, and likely not in the tower.
"If you hadn't burned the bridge with Periander... but that's done. So we'll write to Ollivander," Theo persisted, "And look more into rituals your aunt might..."
a blue line, wasn't there? Here." He traced the imaginary one he had made on the desk. "It can't just have disappeared, right?"
And Draco hadn't looked behind himself or at the Marauder's Map once. Luna wasn't exactly an easy sight to miss. "Come inside, then. It's safe," Draco sighed wearily, and led her into the tunnel to the Shrieking Shack. She'd heard the stories behind its so-called haunting by now, so she was completely unafraid as they followed her light down the tunnel. He remembered Uncle Sirius having shown Severus this way, in that awful memory, and reminded himself that he wasn't necessarily leading Luna into peril- well, not
Not that Umbridge was about to let anyone there dwell on that. "Just a few questions, dear. Who would you say are your closest friends at Hogwarts?"
Harry's gaze drifted to the solid obsidian floor, which alone gleamed enough to show back his lovely reflection, and through the open ceiling, to the brilliance of a deep blue summer sky.
"Harry, everyone reacts differently," Lupin tried to reassure him, and Draco poked at Potter until he stopped making such a mopey pathetic face at him.
"Ready?" said Lupin, who did not look as sanguine as Draco about Potter's prospects. "Concentrating hard? All right- go!"
With the meeting Aunt Bella had offered long passed, Draco had no answer. "It's not clear yet," he said with a sigh. "But when the opportunity arises, we'll know it. We can shelve this for now... but we'll do research. Yes, Striker, research on
Draco flopped backwards onto his bed, letting his head fall back against the pillows with a groan. "Merlin, you do my head in, Hermione. Someday, when you're older, maybe you could do something to change things, but not now- any changes would have to come through legislation, and you wouldn't want to start with pushing emancipation, almost no one wants that, masters
wand," he said, and Harry had to get out the moonstone dagger and several different potion vials before he found the talon wand. "Colloportus. Inmotus. Tumultum adux. How attached were you to the idea of playing Quidditch?"
? Draco was entering that night's duel with the express intent of causing one. Whatever would be enough to make Harry bleed copiously, and be too out of it to realize Draco had taken his blood and stored it in a small opaque black vial he had ready in his pocket.
For the first time, awfully, doubt crept into Draco's head whether Nott had really been speaking the words Avada Kedavra, or he had heard wrong. It wasn't like Stupefy sounded anything like Avada Kedavra. But other incantations did.
"An accidental pistol to his head," Dantanian said, sounding bored and sleepy. "I've read all his journals in the studio too, they have all his plans for it and everything. He couldn't handle my mother leaving him when she got pregnant with me, so he killed himself. I know what that means, I'm eleven-
Harry kissed him and it was like the release of the guards in Draco against his own magic, the dam loosed and a world of possibilities let out unchecked, danger and yet life, vital and painful and perfect on the tongue. Harry tasted like sparkling cider and frustration, kiss harsher and sharper than under the mistletoe, laid out in bed with Harry on top of him, sucking down on his bottom lip. Draco arched as he strained into the kiss, pinned wrists his leverage to lift his back off the bed and press up his mouth in whining demand.
"Oh," Draco said, touching his sleeve. Sure enough, the lovely mint green cashmere, a replacement from the first present of his mother's ruined at Grimmauld, had the seared imprint of the flame whip along the whole forearm. He must have caught himself and not noticed. At least none of the skin seemed charred beneath. "I'm going to have to work on that," he said absently, then forced a tired grin at Hermione. "Trust me, Striker, you don't want to know."
"It's not like we don't have loads of her possessions to use," Luna said brightly, but they got sidetracked fairly quickly when they happened upon Hostium Posticum. Draco ended up telling her the story of using it on Umbridge. Then Hagrid showed up, looking weary as he often did these days. But he seemed energized by Harry's victory, and happy for the surprise company, and so the book got hastily shoved into Draco's bag.
The news they had to give up flying at night meant Klum was very glum, but at least it gave Draco more time to work on all his illegal potions. Several days after Draco told him, Krum came up and said, "I have asked Karkaroff for permission for us to go flying together at nights. But he vas very unhappy, and said many things about you. I do not think Karkaroff likes you very much."
"Very nice," Draco said politely, failing to hide he had no idea what he was talking about. Mr. Granger would explain later, upon tentative request, that football was a Muggle game that seemed to imitate Quidditch in a simpler inferior form, with one goal instead of three hoops and only one ball, which mainly stayed on the ground and didn't even move by itself.
Draco's wristwatch alarm went off for midnight impending, the same way it had for Naufragiam with Luna. He cast instinctive warming charms on both of them, even with Grindelwald in the large thermal down parka Draco had brought him. A look at the watch reminded Draco that it was from Harry.
Or rather, he tried. The minute they leaned towards the gnarled stump, the vines sprang out like an underbrush of thick brambles. As in the blue loop, Draco found himself instinctively backing away. This time, he was hiding behind Ron instead of Theo.
A phantom pulse of the Dark Mark on his wrist. It wasn't there and yet it was. It would always be there, no matter he fooled himself, thinking he had forgotten, or he was somehow redeemed. He would never not be the person who had taken the Mark, who let Death Eaters into Hogwarts, who set up Albus Dumbledore's death and was too much of a coward to finish it- who tortured at Voldemort's command- who led Vince to his death by Fiendfyre- who was only saved from Azkaban by Harry Potter's mercy- the person Harry
"We should have listened to you," had become Ron's mantra, along with "I'm sorry I was a bad friend," and most importantly, "I understand if you'll never forgive us, but if we don't work together now, Hermione might not..."
mean she deserves to die," Draco drawled. The little girl stuck her tongue out at him. But she still seized on his arm and let him and Harry drag her to safety.
Potter got a face like no one at Hogwarts had ever dared tell him off so roundly before. "It's easy for you to say! I bet you're happy I can't come!"
"It's like raindrops now," Theo said, paling as he stared at Millie's endlessly blood-producing hands, caught always red-handed. "Are you- Millie, are you lightheaded?" Millie shook her head, and Theo seized both her hands and pulled them to him, not seeming to care how it left his own hands and sleeve sullied too. "I can't see where the cuts even are, Millie. Are you sure you were cut? Is that even your blood?"
"I'm not saying anything, Harry," Draco said nonchalantly, dangling the bait and then pulling back skillfully. He stepped away and watched Harry almost shudder from the loss of the proximity, real need coming to life consciously in those innocent eyes for the first time. "I'm just saying I'll be waiting for you there. All night if I have to. I don't have anywhere else," he intoned, lingering on the last words, with a memory of Lockhart writing the same to his godfather, years ago- but thinking of his godfather put too many doubts in his head, so he pushed the image of Severus away. "
"But it's against our laws,' said Weasley. "Dragon-breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It's hard to stop Muggles noticing us if we're keeping dragons in the back garden- anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie's got off wild ones in Romania."
"Never letting go," Harry agreed, and kissed Draco until Draco had to let him go, so eager to cast the spells they needed.
is. "We are standing on one right now," Seguinus prompted, but to little avail. Eventually, Gilderoy was coaxed to abandon this grand perplexing question of the terrace for the greater good.
he was- and the best thing he could give Harry was just his protection. And when the time came, letting him go to someone who actually deserved his devotion.
"Do you really think you're subtle?" Draco said impatient. "Don't worry, I haven't heard anyone else figure it out, least of all her. And I haven't said anything until now."
"My aunt," Draco said, lifting his chin and facing them defiantly because he was a Malfoy and he would not cringe and scrape before Gryffindors, even Dumbledore. "Bellatrix Lestrange."
Okay, maybe Draco had more to apologize for, but they forgave him, and agreed to Blaise's suggestion to practicing four times a week, using Sunday nights as well. If anything, the others' determination seemed to have been
Draco spent a very frightening few minutes hiding in the shadows of the Entrance Hall, trying not to be noticed, before Potter and Ron made their appearance and collected him under the invisibility cloak. "Where have you been?" he hissed. "
Grimmauld was dark, but at least it was warm, and when Black Apparated to the pavement between 11 and 13, he actually had a smile on his face. "Hello?" he called, looking around in that unsteady, disarmingly friendly way of his that threatened to either remind you of Aunt Bella or make you like him, both of which were dismal prospects. It stabbed Draco with guilt to leave him hanging, but Severus would be along any moment, and he would have far more to occupy him.
Draco tuned them out as he knelt down and picked up a handful of ancient dust. It stained his palm as black as smeared ink, like it was not true dust but old ashes. When he closed his eyes, there was almost the flicker of fire behind them.
hurt no one with that love. Those who would begrudge Mr. Black and Mr. Lupin their happiness, after everything they have suffered? Love is not something such people even understand, let alone the power of the magic in it. I do believe, Mr. Malfoy, there will be powerful magic in these rings you make. With or without these rune designs." She cleared her throat, making herself go business-like. "Did you imagine these painted?"
, I'll hold you all collectively responsible." He felt less menacing than ready to collapse, though, so he reached into his bag and took out a draught of peace. He swallowed it down in one gulp, and damn what they thought of that. "Group culpability-"
"You didn't, did you?" Draco said, and Black's eyes went alive then with a new expression, the most disconcerting and maddest of all: hope.
Umbridge, who had been carefully watching Vince's face, caught him flinching at the summoning charm and pounced. "Ah, yes, excellent, the summoning charm!" she trilled. "Why, that should be a piece of cake for a fifth-year, if properly instructed! My dear boy, why don't you show us your summoning charm! Say, the tongs from the fireplace. Go on!"
"No," Draco said weakly. "With, erm, with Hermione Granger." Severus looked like he was questioning his grasp on reality. "We were in the area, see, at a Muggle stadium, for this kicking sport of theirs- it's an impaired form of Quidditch, on the ground with only one ball-"
We're in the same year at Hogwarts, and I hate to criticize, dear cousin- or should I call you Uncle Sirius? I think that's not uncommon for a first cousin once removed- not to be overly harsh,
"No," Dumbledore said, "One for every champion. The others are in Professor McGonagall's office, waiting. But your godfather insisted he had the right to see you and speak to you before anything was done to you. Severus, I do assure you, it's all perfectly safe..."
"And here," Voldemort said to Draco, "Is your chance to show your loyalties, little one. Keep the boy in place, Wormtail, do not let him crawl away yet to die..." Wormtail slammed Harry on the head, though he was trembling from the aftershocks of Voldemort's spell. Voldemort ended it cleanly, but he shook from it, face-down in the grave dirt. A voice came up in Draco saying
"Severus, Severus!" Draco bounced where he stood. It was probably just his imagination, the way Severus's glare softened, before sliding back into place.
"Oh, yes, Padfoot, I couldn't have done it without you," Remus said dryly, reaching back to pat him on the leg. When Sirius gave him a suspicious look, Remus gave back an innocent smile.
"Your potion looks competent, vain boy," Severus said without looking over, inspecting Blaise's with a frown. "And I will have to test. But from the eye test, I would not scruple to give you vials of... hmm, Granger's, Bulstrode's, Nott's, and perhaps Greengrass's to take." It seemed Blaise's was no good after all, as Severus put it down with a sneer. "Were you hoping to carry some off with you right away? I would have hoped your supply would not be so depleted yet..."
the war. But it was hard to consider himself futureless, when the near future was so clear. Care of Magical Creatures and Divination revisions could wait for tomorrow. Today, he was spending the afternoon with Harry Potter.
"Oh, believe me, we'll hear it. Okay, we're here. Do you think it's something here in the room to find, or something about the taking of a bath itself?"
Draco put on his best devoted cousin expression. "Harry won't want to repeat it. But Luna will want to hear everything about Tom Riddle, you know that.
?" Draco was surprised into a lack of circumspection. "I had no idea. I thought he'd sooner spit in his brother's face. What, is Dobby transmitting messages?" Dobby would soon be too busy with another task for that. "It wouldn't work face-to-face. Trust me, however much poor little Albus whines about it, Aberforth must be hating it more-"
"Very well," he said briskly. "I can Side-Along you both there. Just- not so far. Draco can make Portkeys," he told an outraged-looking Karkaroff. "If you don't mind. I'd just need you to make one to take us as far as- as Barcelona."
Malfoy pride kept him from the Gryffindor-Slytherin match, though the distance the other Slytherin first-years had been keeping broke down from shock he wasn't coming. "But Draco," Pansy said, with a look more frightened than when he joked about siccing 'the Malfoy family troll' on her, "You love Quidditch. You used to talk all the time about how you couldn't wait for Quidditch at Hogwarts."
"As it happens, our families aren't exactly close," Draco hissed, "Given that her father is the editor of the
"The future is terrifying now," Hermione whispered, and at least Draco hadn't had to be the one to say it.
It was when Ron and Hermione were across the room, close to the coven, that Draco thought he saw them finally kiss.
. The decision is yours. It has always been yours. Do I think the boy deserves to so much as kiss your
have left the wine cellars open- but it wasn't like Kreacher was deviating from his usual personality. He just had liquid courage in those ancient veins, his unpleasant visage contorted in the purest of hatreds.
For the second time in two days, someone had gotten the jump on him with an Expelliarmus. And Draco recognized the voice that had said it. Not his favorite person to be stuck with in these cellars without a wand.
"I understand the principle of color contrast, Potter," Draco said dryly, "Thank you, that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me," and made it sound sarcastic. Even if it really did happen to be easily the best thing anyone had ever said of Draco Malfoy:
"Should you, though?" Hermione whispered skeptically, familiar with the insanity of the schedule Draco had set himself this year, but turned to her potion with renewed attention herself.
Remus looked bewildered. "No. Of course not. Why would you think..." He shook his head. "No, Draco, we would never do that to you. We care about you, I hope you know that. But that doesn't mean there doesn't have to be punishment for this."
"You're trying to make me jealous," Harry protested, accurately. "That's too easy. Bad dragon," he said lightly. The rebuke hit an unexpected place in Draco, one that made him meet Harry's gaze with deferentially lowered eyelashes and a demon behind them, a heat that seemed to double the work of the fire beside them. Harry hastily averted his gaze.
"Luna Lovegood," Dobby said wobblingly, "Is seeming very upset about the Chamber of Secrets, and when she was being there before. Dobby is not knowing if..."
"I've been thinking," Luna said cheerfully, "That he and I should have intercourse soon," and Draco's appalled squawking seemed the most fun she'd had in some time. Luna claimed it was a good sign, her desire for Neville, one that showed she was yet further past the specter of Tom she'd seen in the mirror. Draco warned her not to rush to any large step, just to make a point, at which Luna told him, no, it wasn't to prove something, it was, well, a
Draco only saw Ron's face contort in terror before he was swept up into the air and set hanging there. He looked over, and the same had happened to Ron and Potter, and he told himself everything was still fine, he still had his wand, until he began to realize how
It was humiliating to have Severus consult Luna and not him, but so it was. Severus seemed to know he couldn't get a straight answer out of
Draco didn't ride in the train compartment with Potter, Hermione, and their excess of Weasleys, where Filibuster Fireworks and all sorts of nauseating Gryffindor things seemed to be unfolding. He went straight to the back of the train to join Luna Lovegood, who spent the trip beside her new cousin telling him rather fascinating stories, about her brief but unforgettable time with her onetime soulmate, Tom Riddle.
He was late for Christmas dinner, and by the time he made it to the Great Hall, he was dismayed to find it a grotesquely grandiose affair, with the excessiveness of the number of turkeys covering the single long table only surpassed by the excess of wizard crackers strewn throughout, of which the Weasleys were making full and obnoxious use. Draco stared enviously up at the High Table with its lavish allotment of wine, though a mortally plastered Hagrid was only slightly less horrifying than Dumbledore in a flowered bonnet.
"You know," Hermione gasped, hand going to her mouth, "I never wanted to say it, but sometimes... I feel the same way!"
Draco might not have learned any more about Eurydice, let alone himself. But he did have a curse he wanted to create.
Draco had a bad feeling about letting Ron finish that sentence. "Ron," Draco said, "This is like when you were so sure Potter put his name in the Goblet of Fire. You're going to come to your senses eventually, realize your friends were right and that you were making an idiot out of yourself, and be very embarrassed. Why don't you do yourself a favor and skip to the last stage already?"
"I am glad," Gilderoy said loftily, "That my mistakes prove so amusing to you," and Severus was the one to take Gilderoy's arm then, that rare initiation of actual touch between Severus and any other living being. "I know well how stupid you think me-"
And there he was, that sallow face and stringy black hair, but young. Draco stood there unseen, watching his godfather pick dittany leaves from the purple flowers in the Herbology greenhouse, the sun setting over the groundskeeper's hut and the Whomping Willow in the golden haze beyond the glass.
Draco didn't know what to expect of the trip on the Hogwarts Express, but he knew that any invitation from the Grangers to go watch Arsenal play the kicking game had not been forthcoming. He told himself over and over that he was not upset at the thought of Mr. and Mrs. Granger having watched his father and judged him by it. It wasn't like he could blame them. He had frozen up without doing a thing to show any opposition, allowing the Malfoys to put up a united front. He didn't have the nerve to mention the Arsenal in his two remaining letters to Hermione before September, and she didn't mention it either.
Severus gave his ten-second eye-roll that Draco had spent actual hours watching himself in the mirror and perfecting, and it was like yet another potential replacement for his own loathsome reflection had been burnt away. "The Slytherins would have been perfectly safe if they had been intelligent enough to stay within their common room. Dementors cannot pass through
Harry nodded, looking concerned for Draco. But his palm barely hurt even before he healed the wound for himself. With it closed up, he used the blood that had pooled as his paint and smeared it down onto the obsidian, making the Wheel of Hecate from the diagram with ease. Far harder was parting with a bit of his hair, and letting the light wisps fall where they would over the red wheel.
Draco hated them, a row of 26 marble eyes in which Dobby's were only a slightly jarring break. He had never liked the homely creatures, and he liked them even less for their kind having fought to defend Hogwarts in the final battle against the Dark Lord, when Draco himself had not had the courage. Dobby was more of a hero than him. He was more use to Potter. And if Draco had to suffer a little more pain than he already had, it was nothing more than a raindrop in a hurricane. Let them stare, let them watch their future lord be treated like them. Dementors had been less pleasant attendants.
Light filtered in from the narrow window, although that would that would fade to mere moonlight, and by the time midnight hit, a total eclipse. That probably had some significance for the Mirror of Espilce- Draco didn't believe in coincidence when it came to Grindelwald, even if this was a truly incredible coincidence- but all Draco could think of was the revelations of yesterday.
"That's right! That jealousy, that won't touch us! And maybe we're a motley crew. Maybe we don't look like much to everyone else. But do you know who didn't use to look like much? Our Chaser!" He nudged Theo, who looked less enthusiastic about his panegyric than the others. "You know who used to be a shy, bookish nerd who nobody noticed? Our Chaser! You know who used to not stand out in a crowd? Our Chaser! But did he let that keep him an anonymous bookworm his whole life? Did he stay in the shadows, content to watch everyone else shine like a fucking coward?"
Lucius Malfoy's son Draco, sixteen, was adopted this summer alongside Mr. Potter, by the notorious ex-fugitive Sirius Black. Mr. Draco Lupin Black was disowned by the Malfoy family after his role in the Battle of the Ministry, in which he used an unknown cutting curse to end the life of Mr. Cantankerous Nott. A former Ministry employee, Mr. Nott was the seventy-two-year-old father of a classmate.
"Slaying the dragon?" Draco prompted. Harry laughed, a rumbling sound that made Draco's selfish thoughts come back with full force.
The final stumbling-block was Hermione's teeth, which she kept gazing at in the mirror and saying ruined the whole look. "I do look pretty," she wailed, "But only until I open my mouth!"
"Don't encourage him," Lamia muttered, but Dantanian leaned forward, hair falling near Dorian's face.
He told himself he had never had any love for this place, that there was no sentimentality in seeing its former glory with fixtures and windowpanes still untouched by the damage the wand in his pocket would do. That it made him feel no more than Weasley's sneer or the return in the eyes of 11-year-old Potter of the same pity- not even anything bad, just nothing. But he could not even pretend to himself when he cast his gaze towards the high table and saw the glint of hair and beard lighter than his own, the headmaster front and center, hands folded before them as he presided over this hall, the epicenter of this small kingdom whose walls could surely never fall.
Their opponents hardly seemed to be facing the contest with the same spirit. Draco had never seen a person less want to be somewhere than Neville Longbottom did right then, even himself. And Draco had once shared a home with
"You still curious?" Draco asked, lowering his voice as they passed tent after tent, pulling her aside before the hem of her long coat could catch on the violet fire some wizards were using to cook. "About him and my grandfather Abraxas? I talked to his portrait. Asked your questions."
"What are they so terrified of?" Draco complained to Hermione before she left him. "They saw Dumbledore give me all those points for helping you."
Once, during one of Trelawney's many sad condescending monologues to Draco, generally along the lines of how not everybody could be gifted with the ability to see the future, Pansy stood up for him in all the wrong ways, blurting out how Draco was going to be an Unspeakable. Trelawney made some very discouraging faces about that prospect, shaking her head. "Perhaps one day," she said gravely, "His magic will tie him to the future and not the past."
Draco had been so smug at being a prefect when Harry wasn't last time, he'd even been happy to see that honor go to a Weasley. Now it seemed he and Harry would share that exclusion. He could see the twins looking over at Harry, ready to interrogate the decision, and Draco cut in before they could. "Clearly the system has gone off the rails. If the most handsome, talented, successful, and handsome boy in the whole
"Put it in the tea, then," groused the imposter. "Anything to stop this bushy-haired creature from babbling any further about her Muggle 'science'." Odd, the intensity with which he seemed to eye Hermione, as if there was some more specific dislike than just for her blood. Hermione gave the other Rat Thieves a long-suffering but amused look. Luna poured four cups of tea, a rather bracing Darjeeling they likely all needed on this brisk afternoon after what one could only really call tantamount to a minor snowball fight. Then Draco added a few drops to one teacup, and the imposter let Hermione pour it into his mouth without protest.
"They were found near the library," said McGonagall. "I don't suppose any of you can explain this? It was on the floor next to them..." She was holding up a small, circular mirror, and if there was one thing Draco hated in this world or any other, it was mirrors.
"Okay, okay," Draco said, smiling brightly, and wrote Sirius's name. "Filicida remittetur," he said, and just like that, Sirius reappeared on the tapestry.
"We have to see what he's up to!" Harry insisted, and could not be dissuaded. "Come on, it's so near your dorm, I'll just drop you right after, okay? Barely a detour."
Grindelwald shrugged with elegance of a sort, the insouciant carelessness Draco always attempted for his own such gestures. "I made the throat-slitting look like a suicide by Dorian. I left a note for it, saying he'd been experimenting on his wife, using Unforgivables to try and force the evil out of her, and he'd turned her into this creature. So he'd killed himself of shame, naturally, and his family believed it. I heard they had wiped him and the girl from their family tree and every mention in every history book. I don't know about the Perianders. I just know they took in the Augurey. She was useful, for their little side business, assessing. Those birds can live hundreds of years if they're a Maledictus. They had a custom to name them Maledictus, which shows how little they thought of them, but they did have the virtue of changing that last
Severus and Sirius had both made it down, at least, but they were both flat on their backs, Severus hardly a less twisted and broken-looking shape than his broom, and then Draco heard the distant sound of Bellatrix Lestrange laughing.
"You do dark magic all the time," Harry said impatiently, clapping his hands together. "What, do you think you're not powerful enough to cast it successfully?"
Because I knew you feared her more than anyone in the world. I asked her to Nott Manor. I asked her to help me send a Black Dagger. I asked her to train me that summer, and not just in Occlumency, to keep my secrets. Do you know who's
Potter unwrapped it from its confines carefully, always so sweet with owls, before opening the letter, which made the owl go spastic and begin to rocket about like it was fireworks going off in its own celebration. If the thing wasn't careful, Crookshanks would eat it before Potter could send it off on a return trip.
There were more children to keep safe now, streaming into the Room of Requirement across the bemused painting of Barnaby the Barmy- great lines of them being harassed into some semblance of order as they evacuated by the prefects, including-
believe him, there's the door. I'm not having your sort of dead weight clogging up this enterprise."
Draco made sure to keep Luna by his side as the night unfurled, though her father had not come with them to potentially embarrass her, a decision he had to be thankful for in retrospect. He stopped before the official photographers and made them take all kinds of portraits of them, after a quiet word in the man's ear to be sure that whatever his father might say, these would not hit the scrap heap before copies were sent to them at Hogwarts.
Yet things went downhill very quickly from there. Draco was in the Slytherin common room, being trounced at wizard's chess by Theo, when a shocked and impressed Blaise came and informed him
again. Potter seemed to be trying hard to seem casual, as if he had just happened to be here, and he and his friends hadn't set this up for him to get Draco alone, which Draco usually avoided at all costs. He didn't think they'd been fully alone like this since that very first meeting, unless one counted hurtling through the air during that first flying lesson. "You know, Seamus heard some of the Slytherins, even older years, think
Potter found Draco like that, casting Oppugno on progressively more dummies at once, before lashing out with one spell or another to stop them, explode them, burn them, cut them, whatever Draco felt like at the time. For a second time in his life, Potter was in extreme danger of mistakenly being on the wrong end of Sectumsempra with Draco. Enough dummies had been put in motion that Draco almost cursed him before he recognized the peach blur of movement wasn't a sack of sand but a person.
personal attachments. But it had kept him at Viktor's side, for that trip to the guillotine that would assuredly be the home leg against the Panthers.
It might have been easier to go with that excuse, but Dantanian didn't. "No," he said flatly. "Even if you weren't, even if you were proposing marriage to me,
A potential enemy would never have showed Hermione the back entrances of the Manor as well as the front ones. But off they flew, summer sunlight streaming down over them, with a gentle breeze keeping them from overheating. "This part is like the labyrinth halls in the dungeons of Hogwarts," Draco pointed out, enjoying listening to her ooh and ah at the sight of all of the gilded edging and gargoyles, stained glass and crenellations, ancient stone and enchanted hovering ocean-colored lights, which all came to life at an earlier time each night once they passed the solstice.
intelligent, aren't you? Let me put this in a way your Lilliputian intellect might be able to comprehend. There are two possibilities here. Either I'm not actually a Death Eater or tied to them, and you've just made a vicious false accusation in front of hundreds of people to a
"Why would this be hell?" Grindelwald asked, sounding genuinely curious of Draco's answer. He was not as fearful or eager for real answers about Draco's presence, as one would have expected of anyone in his situation, but this was not just anyone. He already knew some information about Draco just by looking: his apparent age, his accent, his presumed ethnicity and country of origin, thus his presumed magic school, perhaps presumed temperament or sexuality or even blood. That was fine. In seconds, the prisoner had shown Draco perhaps the most key information of all: he was Grindelwald, and
"Diffindo," he cast, and drew his wand in the air over the snake, cutting it lengthwise. Then he covered his hands in the blood, and approached the plainest part of the observatory, a blank dark slab of a door. He did not hesitate to raise his stained hands to it and begin to draw. He had the swift ease of an artist who had been practicing more this summer, making the picture in his mind come right to reality. That picture was of snakes and stars.
Father didn't usually begin so quickly. Draco had barely taken his seat in that old despised pinewood chair before Father rounded on him, with a demonic fierceness in his eyes that had used to scare Draco more. Draco had his wand at his side, though he didn't intend to pull it unless he thought he was about to ruin the future or die. It wasn't like he thought he could take Father in a duel, even with all the experience he had that Father didn't know about, and even with a wand that had done more dark things that Father could ever dream. Trying to duel Father would give so much away he might as well shout to the rooftops he wasn't the real Draco Malfoy anymore.
"Wow," Ron said, wrinkling his nose. "You have to write yours for Professor Lupin to read? They must be the most boring letters ever."
"Hey!" Draco snapped. "Eyes over here! Listen, Krum..." Now that he had him here, he didn't exactly know how to put it. If Krum had seemed to have developed a thing for Hermione already, Draco could have used his pull with her for leverage. But he hadn't seen them anywhere near each other yet. "I need a favor."
been forced to spend a year instructing Zacharias Smith how to deal with Boggarts and the like. One could hardly imagine a circumstance better calculated to incline a person towards condoning violence.
The three of them went back down the spiral staircase, with Draco crowing inwardly about his expert job conforming to the blue loop in Weasley's role. Something Draco had done must have distracted Weasley, or changed some timing enough to get Weasley bit. But Draco had been there then to perform his office and keep Potter and Granger from being too fatally Gryffindorish. Maybe they wouldn't even have to finish that part with detention in the Forbidden Forest-
"Are you staying?" Draco said, pressing his face against Luna's shoulder and nuzzling it into the dark blue felt of her coat with manic affection. "Please say you're staying. Christmas! Christmas with Luna and Hermione! It's a Christmas miracle! The best Christmas ever! Luna, you have to have a tour of Grimmauld at Christmas! I can't wait to show you-"
He closed his eyes, imagining he was walking into the door of Severus's chambers instead, the safest place in the entire world. But his feet would still not move an inch.
"But..." Draco was grasping at straws too. "Aunt Bella can't have been the first of House Black to walk into Ollivander's shop after that. There would have been others, closer in blood-"
"What's this tooth in between the stones?" Potter asked, and Blaise Zabini looked like Christmas had come again in February.
He probably wouldn't have cast Sectumsempra if it hadn't been the spell already on his lips, readied for Aunt Bella.
Father didn't seem as concerned until a succession of wands with phoenix feather cores also produced an eerie absence of magic, whatever the length and wood and shape. By the time they had entered the third dozen of wands for Draco to try, with Ollivander coaching him to calm down, concentrate, not to panic, Father looked so apoplectic Draco feared an eruption of uncontrolled magic from Father more than himself.
." Theo turned to look at the frozen, transfixed Draco, and his face broke into a wide grin. "Hey, Ravenclaw? What do you call a snake who eats other snakes?"
"I am, I'm quitting our House team," Draco informed him, and Severus just stroked the back of his hand with a tired look.
"No," Neville said, with a very Gryffindorish faith in his eyes. "Because you're the one who makes us feel brave."
"He'll go to Azkaban," Draco said, wand beginning to shake in his hand, "And he'll live, and the Dementors won't affect him, he's an Animagus, it won't even be
"I think you could stand up to anyone," Harry said, eyes more serious as he said it, like Draco was some kind of formidable warrior, and not the boy who'd spent his entire time down the trapdoor with him in first year shrieking at the top of his lungs. "Ron said you've learned to duel really well, and that you're super confident. I can't believe you had a duel with him and not me-"
to do about it?" Draco complained, and wilted at the look she gave him. She really wasn't taking any of his bullshit these days, not when it came to something as important as the war to come. "Okay, fine, I guess maybe Occlumency could help... who knows, though, this connection could operate on an entirely different plane of reference... but what, you want me to get him books on it or something? Because it's not like I can
morning." It was past noon. "Should you not be at some ghastly meal or other, vain boy?" He drew his long black dressing gown tighter, evidently roused from sleep. He squinted down sleepily. "What has happened? What is wrong with you
Harry frowned, then set the crown back on Draco's head and hissed at it. A second later, Draco heard the squeak of the plastic slithering, and then a small plastic tongue licked at his forehead. Draco gasped. "Harry! That's crazy!" he said ineloquently, and shivered as the snakes climbed down to coil around each of his shoulders, one silver and one green, before Harry Vanished them with a smile.
Draco didn't have to face anyone but his dormmates, as it turned out he came down with a nasty flu after his long submersion in the water. He would have been grateful for the chance to regroup and plan socially, if the sickness hadn't been so violent and unpleasant. By Blaise's gleeful report, Draco learned that he was the only one, out of all the champions and hostages, who'd gotten sick from their exposure. "Well, the little girl went back to France, didn't she, we wouldn't know," Draco said weakly, and Theo laughed gently.
"Not such an expert in Fiendfyre as it seemed?" Severus intoned. "Come and see if you are able, Mr. Malfoy. You might as
"Even Dean and Seamus?" Draco said skeptically, never forgetting how he'd cursed Seamus in first year. Never mind the tension last year, when Seamus had thought Harry a liar.
"Hermione, the potion- it was-" Draco began, and Hermione smiled at him, beautiful and brilliant, for a brief moment in time that almost stopped. And then it began to run again.
"Very well, then," Gilderoy said, undaunted. "Shall we find a cell for him somewhere or other? Xaphan's full of them, the question's just where none of the Order would ever see him- I suppose I could take the paintings out of that room-"
So you can either fall in line or you can fuck off! You know the way back to the castle!" He gestured wildly in that direction, not expecting anyone to leave.
Draco should have intervened, but he didn't know if he would have even if he could. As it was, he was hardly in any state to process much of what they were saying, let alone insert his thirteen-year-old body into a dispute very much between adults with old grudges.
"Everything's really overwhelming," Draco agreed, "And you can't be expected to keep everything straight. When she curses me in the back when I least expect it, I hope some of that Potter gold in the Gringotts vaults goes towards a
"Sorry about that," Gilderoy said breathlessly. "I had some, er, difficulty getting Severus to leave..."
"What's going on, Draco? Were you cursed?" Potter asked with utmost sincerity in those green eyes that were a mere blur to Draco, a smeared blot clouded together with Potter's glasses like a reflection in a lake hit by a stone. Draco had never been able to stand being touched when he got like this, but somehow, just as it had at Ollivander's the first time he met this Potter, Potter was an exception.
Nott had used to have a position in the Ministry, although Draco thought he would have retired by now. He should have known what or when, given the tentative friendship resumed last year with the man's son. But this was one of the negative side effects of self-absorption. He had to stand there pretending not to be in high alert at one of Voldemort's earliest and most devoted Death Eaters. Although not devoted enough to have gone to Azkaban the first time around.
"Here," Draco said, pushing his cousin forward. "Luna, you go, as our family representative. Tell Potter this is too much excitement for me, and I'm off to take to my sickbed again."
"And yet, look upon him," Voldemort sneered, turning from faux-warmth to Dementor cold in the blink of an eye. "Dressed like a filthy Muggle, with tales he has spent his years at Hogwarts spurning
Draco crossed his arms. "There's one big gap. It's what did happen to make Astaroth go mad. I take it Dantanian was behind it. Do you think Astaroth
"No," Dantanian gasped, "No, I do. I think I do. Legilimens!" Palmer seemed to mount no resistance to the intrusion, because Dantanian took little time to see what he wanted.
For someone who had so worked to avoid this meeting, Dantanian was not exactly quailing as he sat up. His nightshirt slipped off his shoulder, and he pushed it up before raking his hands through his wild hair. He could not have cast a greater contrast with the man who now held his fate in his hands, whose black robes and short black hair and scowl were all perfectly what one would expect of Phineas Nigellus Black.
Draco couldn't resist stealing looks over at the champions' table, but he told himself he was just checking on Hermione. And she did seem to be having a good time, with Krum making an effort, more animated and conversational than Draco had ever seen him. Draco just hoped it wasn't Quidditch he was gesturing so enthusiastically about. It also gave Draco a chance to check on Karkaroff, and if he was doing anything nefarious with a chance sat so close to Potter. Which was an excuse to look, then, at Potter.
“With-” Draco lifts his hands to gesture theatrically to himself in order to fully convey his current level of disbelief, notices that he’s still holding onto Potter’s hand, jerks back and flushes deeply and then coughs to cover up his embarrassment. “With
Draco suddenly feels wrong footed (a paradoxically familiar and comfortable sensation to him, now) and scowls defensively. So what if he’s a bit out of the cultural loop?
One of the lights comes to buzz right before his face, and he yelps, swatting at it before he realises what it is.
“I didn’ think tha’ I’d ever hear of a Malfoy wishin’ ‘e weren’ a Malfoy,” he grunts, leaning back on his splayed hands and crossing one boulder-like ankle over the other, “Wha’ happened to that arrogant little snot tha’ used to swagger ‘round the castle like ‘e owned the place?”
Potter’s head springs up from his knee as though it’d shocked him, and he gapes at Draco with an expression of abject horror.
light glows on the apples of his cheeks, and his thick, wavy hair falls freely over his forehead making him appear soft and light and
“Good jam, tha’ was,” Hagrid murmurs, licking his lips in reminiscence. “Never did thank you for tha’, did I?”
Draco looks down. He fiddles with the grass his fingers had pulled up, letting the blades scatter in his lap.
“Y’know, you’re not exactly convincing when you’re standing there like I’m showing you to your execution pyre.”
“Fine,” he sighs (he pointedly does not think about how easily he’s willing to give in at Potter’s use of his given name, nor why said use of his given name has his heart causing a racket within his ribcage). “It was Professor Snape.”
“You need to be educated in muggle culture, muggle culture is non-compatible with Hogwarts grounds, I want to be as far-the-fuck away from Hogwarts grounds

“Malfoy, I’m no’ gonna hurt yeh,” Hagrid says, still inexplicably smiling at him. “I don’ hate yeh. I’ve made my peace with wha’ yeh did back then, an’ I’m talkin’ to yeh ‘cause I
Is this what Harry had seen when he was spinning him in the garden? This gangly, pale, sleep-deprived mess? This
They stop suddenly and Draco yelps again, but Harry lets go of one hand, using the other to spin Draco in a twirl and draw him back in again. Draco opens his mouth to snap at Harry to
Harry stands in the exact same spot Draco had left him in, tapping his foot against the grass, arms crossed over his chest, sharp jaw tight as he stares up at the darting snitches. He perks up immediately when Draco steps out of the cottage, shoulders relaxing instantly and frown lifting into a smile.
quit it with the sneaky Slytherin shit, bloody fuck-” He pinches the bridge of his nose, pushing up his glasses in the process. He breathes in. He breathes out.
He finds Harry at the end of a narrow hallway in front of an ajar stable door. There are two pairs of wellies standing to the side on the muddy doormat, and Draco stares at the smaller, turquoise, child-sized pair in mild curiosity.
Hagrid claps a genial hand to Draco’s shoulder; it feels a lot like being thwacked with a serving platter, and the Malfoy scion has to clench his teeth against the yelp of pain that threatens to burst out.
“As if you weren't already with all those la-di-da Ministry functions.” Harry’s expression tightens and Draco, belatedly remembering the essential fact that Harry Potter Hates Parties ('

“Okay, yeah, so you can awkwardly stumble around a dance floor and tread on your partner’s toes a whole bunch. Good for you.” Draco sputters.
be the one to end up on the front page in all his cowardly glory (though that, too, he feels would be well-deserved).
“...This coming from the man who’s been shot with an Avada Kedavra twice and survived in under twenty years.” Harry laughs loudly.
He screws his eyes shut and ducks his head, splashing water on his face. The cool liquid helps to clear his head slightly, and he shuts the tap with a sharp twist, meeting his eye in the mirror again with a set jaw.
for a make-out location? I mean, sure, the spot where we were just now was pretty well-hidden, but what if someone was inside? They’re
Harry’s hand isn’t shaking anymore, and it feels just as strong and solid as it did the first time, but there’s something warmer about it, in the way his fingers wrap around Draco’s, the way Draco’s hand slots into the gap beside Harry’s thumb as though it were
“Snape was your-” he sputters. Coughs. “Sorry, I just find it really hard to imagine someone naming him godfather to their kid.”
“Hey,” Hagrid nudges him with a friendly shoulder. Draco has to dig his fingers into the dirt to prevent himself from toppling over. “It’s good tha’ yeh feel guilt. ‘Means yeh’ve got a conscience. Bu’ don’ mistake feelin’ bad abou’ wha’ yeh did fer feelin’ bad abou’ yerself as a whole. Yer not a bad person. Bu’ yeh have to prove it movin’ forwards, not wallow in all yeh did wrong in the past. Tha’ helps no one.”
“It really is a wonder to be alive,” he murmurs, closing his eyes serenely as the wind’s light fingers play with his silvering beard.
Draco leans into the gentle song, letting the peace of the night wash over his spent form. Hagrid sighs blissfully from beside him.
“Well! I’ve just abou’ had my fill of air,” Hagrid says nonsensically, slapping his hands down on his thighs and then pushing himself up to stand. “I’ll jus’ leave you boys to it, then.”
Hagrid doesn’t look any less concerned for his mental state at the excuse, and he stares at Draco for an uncomfortably long period of time. Draco squirms a little under his gaze. He’s suddenly transported back to the feeling of being a naughty school child awaiting the teacher’s verdict for an adequate punishment - the perplexity with which Hagrid surveys him now makes him feel as though his crime was to have been caught dribbling slug juice all over the library books, or something equally cretinous.
He wishes that he weren’t himself. He says as much aloud, muttering it repeatedly as though praying.
And so, there he is at the 5th anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, watching people dine, dance and dab at their eyes with handkerchiefs from the darkest corner of the room, attempting to avoid the gaze of just about everyone and wishing he was safe at home in his poky cottage tucked far into the folds of the Welsh countryside.
“I’d seen him around before, but it was down this hall that we first met in person. He’d bitten Ron’s leg and dragged him all the way down here, so ‘Mione and I had to chase after him and, uh. Then I met him.”
he’s doing, but he resolutely clamps down on the protesting part of himself and eyes Potter with what is meant to be a welcoming expression but probably looks more like he’s threatening to Go Feral Death Eater on him if he doesn’t accept the offer.
Unfortunately, five years of self-imposed isolation means that his conversational skills are utter shite, as demonstrated by the near-one-sided talk Hagrid had had with him earlier and the stilted exchange he’d had with Potter after that.
He’s in the midst of revelling in the long-awaited solitude, when he’s abruptly made aware of the fact that he’s still very much where people can see him by the pleasured moan that echoes from an alcove somewhere off to his right.
Harry snickers over Draco’s diatribe, pulling Draco to face him and taking Draco’s other hand in his free one as well.
It was one thing accepting kindnesses that were purely for kindness’ sake, but it was quite another to start having
He feels vaguely off-kilter, and a bit raw, possibly due to this being the longest conversation he’s had in five years, but also… something in the Gamekeeper’s speech has warmed something in his chest, calmed him in a way that is entirely unfamiliar. Hagrid’s voice had been so earnest, so
It’s Minerva that he blames in that moment, for the fact that he’s there, back against the wall of the Entrance Hall, with the bottoms of his palms pressed to his eyes, as he tries desperately to prevent them from leaking. He remains in that pitiable stance for a few moments, listening to time pass with the tick-ticking of his heart, and mentally composing a stongly-worded letter to the Hogwarts Headmistress, kindly telling her to back the fuck off and let him wallow in hermitude in peace.
The fact that he’s still woefully appreciative towards her doesn’t quite manage to take the sting out of the gesture.
He cringes at the mental image of Severus’ horrified, grey face, the way his lips had pinched sourly as though regretting every single life decision he’d ever made up to that point and would please like someone to bleach his brain to rid him of all memory. It had been an entirely inappropriate circumstance, but Draco had related
Draco looks up from the boots as Harry sets his hand flat on the door, slowly pushing it open with a gleefully mysterious grin. Draco rolls his eyes at the theatrics, but steps forward obligingly.
The smell of damp earth fills his nose, and he has to duck slightly to fit, and then even more to avoid having his hair brush against the crumbling mud ceiling. He grimaces, cursing Potter violently and wondering why he was so quick to give in to his whims, then crushes that train of thought before it reaches a troubling destination, resignedly picking his way through rotting leaves and tangles of protruding roots carpeting the tunnel ground.
“Come with me,” he says, before his head disappears past the door frame again. Draco pushes himself up from where he’d been leaning against the counter and follows.
His knee is jiggling restlessly, and he’s torn between wanting to run outside right now and be questioned about his impossibly short bathroom break or waiting longer and risk Harry thinking he’s suffering from constipation.
Hagrid, oblivious to Draco’s suffering, nods with finality. He let his dustbin lid-sized hand fall back to his side, and the younger man can barely hold back the sigh of relief as the weight is quite literally lifted off of his shoulder. The Half-Giant once again sets his gaze upon the celestial tapestry draped above them, and Draco follows suit, resting his right temple against his knee. They both fall silent.
Draco narrows his eyes at him. Then he magnanimously decides to overlook Harry’s Gryffindorish eccentricities and goes back to his dinner.
“You weren’t supposed to thank me. I - well, I may have liked a reply - an acceptance or rejection of my apology - but I’d have understood if you didn’t want anything more to do with me.”
Draco yelps and stumbles backwards, but just before the branch turns Potter into a spectacled splat on the ground, the whole tree suddenly stills, branches waving tranquilly in the cool night breeze, bafflingly innocent as though it hadn’t just attempted to murder the Boy Who Lived a mere second ago.
. “He didn’t look me in the eye for ages after that - not that I could either - but he did give me detention for a week, which was actually a ruse for a series of rigorous sex ed lessons and talks about safety and consent.” He sighs regretfully. “He wasn’t very good at caring, but I do believe that he did.”
Harry’s smiling at him so, so gently, and of all the impossible, ridiculous things the man had done that evening, Draco thinks that such a smile, so open and sweet, directed towards
The way Harry had looked at him certainly hadn’t made him feel the way he looks in the mirror. The way Harry had looked at him - had
He hadn’t had anything stocked in the cupboards (possessing exactly zero life-skills) but having spent his childhood going to the most extreme lengths to avoid eating his vegetables, he’d become pretty adept at wandlessly transfiguring anything he’d found unappetising into pure sugar. He’d eyed the berries contemplatively, before committing to his plan and directing a blast of his magic toward a glum-looking shrub that was sagging over the edge of his weed-infested flower bed. He’d berated himself for his overenthusiasm when the entire plant - along with most of the stragglers surrounding it - had collapsed into piles of crystalline, white granules (he’d crossed his fingers that the muggle police wouldn’t decide on an impromptu visit). A couple of hours later found him slumped against his lower kitchen cabinets, with a few hundred jars of homemade blackberry jam lined up on the counter above him, each one with a slip of parchment tied to the rim on a length of twine, reading “I’m sorry” in (ever-decreasingly) neat cursive.
he then grouses, lips twisting into a slight sneer. It isn’t as though whatever sentimental bullshit Potter had come up with
“We all went to the Yule Ball, Potter,” Draco scoffs, rolling his eyes to make up for the fact that he’s reddened as though suffering an allergic reaction and is screeching internally in bamboozled incomprehension and embarrassingly schoolgirl-ish excitement. Harry laughs.
“Again, Malfoy,” Hagrid’s surprisingly gentle voice cuts through Draco’s thoughts, “I’m not tellin’ yeh this to make yeh feel guiltier.” He pauses long enough that Draco gives in and meets his eye again. He wants to cringe at the undeserved kindness that he finds in them.
The Gryffindor plops stiffly onto the grass, pulling his knees up to his chest in a mirror of Draco and hugging his legs, rapping his fingers against his shin as he practically buzzes with nervous energy.
The night breeze whirls around the two men, sweeping away the bubbling sounds of celebration to replace them with a wistful, crooning chorus of it’s own.
“It’s not a memory I particularly enjoy dredging up, Potter,” he mutters. Never mind the fact that his mind will badger with it relentlessly against his will anyway instead of allowing him to get any Circe-damned
Draco opens his mouth to make a surprised exclamation, but then remembers how hard Granger had decked him in Third year and can suddenly see it.
By the time he reaches the grounds, he’s almost galloping in his haste to escape the castle walls, and tingly-warm sweat has begun saturating the silk shirt he’d dug out especially for the occasion.
With the sharp claws of panic digging viciously into the back of his skull, he staggers backwards until he can press his spine fully to the wall behind him. He fumbles to free his hands from the tangle of voluminous sleeve, before pressing them firmly against the rough stone, feeling at how cool and solid it is under his hot, clammy palms. Barely moving his lips, he begins to mouth the names of all the Goblin Wars he can remember, breathing in and out with each one as silently as he can manage.
Draco is, all of a sudden, reacquainted with the very pleasant sensation of hot-cold-heart-jerking-panic that he’d only just managed to drag himself down from during his conversation with Hagrid. He speed-runs through a breathing exercise (which, honestly, is only counterproductive) and turns from One Of The People Who Had The Most Reason To Hate Him to The Person Who Definitely Had The Most Reason To Hate Him.
He looks awfully young in the starlight, the pale, white beams stroking his dark tousels making him seem vulnerable and soft, but also unbearably weary with the way they highlight how his lips purse into an anxious frown, and wrinkle his forehead with lines Draco could remember from even their earliest years of school. Potter catches his eye from the corner of his vision, and gives a quick, wobbly grin, and Draco flushes at having been caught staring. He clears his throat.
Draco hesitates, then nods. The canapés at the party feel like a lifetime ago. “Great. I’ll just…” He jerks a thumb in the direction of what Draco assumes is the kitchen, then backs away to rustle up something edible.
For possibly the twentieth time that evening, Draco’s heart skitters along the cliff’s edge of giving out altogether. Clutching his chest, he sits bolt-upright and spins his head around so quickly that he hears his neck crack in protest.
“Yeah, well, I can’t tell you how much I wish I’d taken more of an opportunity to sass Voldemort before he AKed me- wait, this is the best part.”
With that, he leans over Harry (and Does Not Think about the way his body is pressed against Harry’s back, because now he’s
“Nah - pretty sure the whole Wizarding World would get on my arse about it if I admitted it, but I’ve always just prefered muggle music.”
Hesitantly, awkwardly, he reaches out and puts a hand on Harry’s shoulder, squeezes briefly, then lets go. He swallows.
“Impressive,” he murmurs. The snitch wriggles in his hold, before bouncing up and shooting off, still multicoloured among it’s monochrome counterparts. He watches it go, but startles and looks down when he feels a hand clasp his still-outstretched one.
Hagrid waves a hand in the general direction of Draco’s face, the largeness of the appendage causing it to seem as though he’s gesturing to Draco as a whole.
He swallows, lets his eyes fall to Harry’s mouth too, and bites his lip. He can feel Harry’s gaze boring into him as he steels himself to ask. He sucks in a breath.
“Okay, I’m gonna be honest with you, Malfoy,” he says in a rush, not even giving Draco time to process that statement before he barrels on, “I’m not catching a breather so much as I’m running away.”
He bites back a bitter laugh. He can only imagine the disgust his eleven year old self would feel upon seeing his double-his-age counterpart, for when it comes to the height from which the mighty fall, Draco Lucius Malfoy takes the Circe-damned Cauldron Cake.
He sighs and drags a hand down his face. At least then, he might’ve felt that his life held some meaning.
Draco attempts to return the smile through the throbbing of the entire left side of his torso. He just about manages to croak out a “thanks” before his expression dissolves into a wince.
“Oh, so you consider yourself a music critic now, do you?” Draco asks, trying to stifle his snickers behind his hand. Potter shrugs, wrinkling his nose adorably.
He’d sent them off with his heart lodged in his throat, a smarting wrist, and surety that he wouldn’t sleep a wink that night for all his nervousness.
The music has changed again in the time Draco had been gone, a new voice as smooth and deep as a breeze over an upbeat, electric hum that makes his skin tingle and his heart thud in quick, even beats.
“If it makes you feel any better, I, ah. Ran away, too. So.” He coughs delicately. “You’re not the only coward here.”
Laid out before him, like a scene from a storybook, is a sweeping lawn, glistening silver and green in the lustre of a hundred tiny lights flitting overhead, leaving trails of golden sparks in their wakes. A whimsical arch entwined with apple trees leads to a trio of growing patches, boasting tumbles of bright blooms, tufts of herbs and neat rows of vegetables respectively. The terrace of honeyed pine where they stand is bordered by a brick barbeque and outdoor table on one end and a cluster of beanbags on the other.
Before, he supposes, in his narcissistic naivety, he could delude himself into the belief that people
He stares again as Draco carefully runs his tongue over the tin lid, and Draco, suddenly self-conscious of his admittedly plebeian eating technique, lowers the lid and flushes.
He only notices that he’d been gawking at Hagrid - much like the gormless idiot he’d often described the former Magical Creatures teacher as, and isn’t it
he’s thinking about him fleeing the Forbidden Forest in First Year. Or him collapsing in a fake-dementor heap on the Quidditch pitch in Third. Or him being bounced around the courtyard as a ferret in Fourth. Or-
“I suppose,” he replies slowly, thinking of all the people who want him dead, and how all of them are “wondrously” yet to succeed.
His gaze remains pointed to the floor so that he won’t accidentally make eye-contact with another attendee, though after ceaseless staring, the wooden parquetry has blurred through the anxious misfocus of his eyes, and the ache at the base of his neck has bloomed across his shoulders, throbbing from the high-strung posture he holds.
When he arrives in the doorway, having followed the very helpful sound of Harry’s spewed vitriol, it is to find Harry on his tiptoes, glowering into a sparsely packed cupboard. Draco slips over to stand behind him.
“Yes! My cottage is just-” he tilts to the side, bending his arm in an awkward curve. “Just down that street and around the corner, then follow the footpath through the blackberry hedge and you’ll find it.”
“Erm-” Harry tears his eyes away from Draco’s mouth and coughs awkwardly, spinning around to scratch through a drawer. When he turns back to face Draco again, he looks a little pink. He holds out a spoon, avoiding Draco’s eye. “...Thank you.”
At 22, however, he’s pitifully grateful when fellow magical-folk ignore him instead of hurling hexes the moment they see his cursedly distinctive hair.
Draco hums. That, he’s not entirely surprised by. He may have been, several years previous, but anyone with functioning eyeballs could see how much Potter loathed the limelight. It’s boldly evident in the way all his Prophet appearances also feature a scowl and a hand held up in a futile attempt to ward off vulture-esque photographers, and that was when he
Hagrid laughs, scrubbing at the drying tear tracks on his face, while Draco stares at him, unsure of whether his bones are rattling because of the thunderous volume of the Half-Giant’s mirth, or because he’s freaking out wondering if Hagrid would actually clobber him. Probably a bit of both.
,’ he muses sardonically. Still, he keeps his arms folded and hidden within the bells of his sleeves, so that his right hand can maintain a reassuring grip on his wand - safely stowed in its holster - should he need to throw up a hasty
“Yeh said yeh got a change in perspective,” Hagrid says. “Try changin’ it again. Look beyond yerself and yer self-loathin’. The world is bigger than tha’. Yeh’ve jus’ gotta see it, now.
Draco is all too sure that Harry can feel how violently his heart is thwacking against the front of his chest, can hear how shakily his breaths are coming, if he can’t already see the hot, vermillion flush swathed across his cheeks.
“Oh, definitely Snape,” Draco says without hesitation. “I didn’t have to see Umbridge at Sunday lunch.”
to admire him. Perhaps, at eleven, he’d thought he was doing his peers a favour by deigning to associate with them at all.
And Draco would shut up then, having successfully Said Something Not Entirely Abhorrent To Harry Potter, but…
After finally admitting defeat, he had traipsed out into his garden to calm his nerves and had slouched beneath the wild blackberry bush that blankets his fence. He'd been munching morosely on the juicy morsels when he had suddenly been struck by an idea.
Perhaps Harry would join him then, curl up behind him with his arms wrapped around his waist, coffee-warmed breath tickling the shell of his ear as he murmurs his Gryffindorish nonsense into Draco’s hair, hands trailing lower and lower-
Draco finds himself gaping at the man once again, though Hagrid appears perfectly at-ease, shuffling around until he’s comfortable, the cracks of his joints echoing around the pair of them like thunderclaps.
Four years down the line, and he still had an ant problem in his garden due to the lingering sugar, two whole cupboards and a pantry dedicated entirely to said sugar, and had received exactly 3 replies to his peace offerings - an essay from Granger that could have easily been summarised in a simple “fuck off”, a jar of gelatinous purple gloop from Lovegood (he’d been unsure if that was an acceptance or rejection), and an invitation to tea from Professor McGonagall.
“Alright.” And Draco spirals a gentille hand in a “lead the way” gesture, to which Potter grins, turns on his heel and begins marching off to the left.
Potter had waited for him a little way ahead, and grins over his shoulder as Draco joins him, which does something odd to Draco’s blood pressure that he’d really rather not examine much closer. He starts walking again once Draco is beside him, and they carry on their way.
He’s momentarily struck dumb, therefore, when Hagrid seems to come to a decision, which turns out to be settling down on the grass beside Draco and... staring up at the stars.
time wouldn’t be slapped across the front page of the Prophet tomorrow morning, complete with candid photographs of the four-eyed half-wit looking ill at ease in yet
When they finally emerge from the tunnel, they end up in a musty, dilapidated, woodworm buffet that Harry claims is the Shrieking Shack. He then explains to a Definitely Not Spooked Draco that no, the screams the villagers had heard from it were not made by angry spectres, but by a teenaged Remus Lupin as he tore himself apart every full moon being unable to hunt other people as his wolf-form instinct would otherwise drive him to do.
With excruciatingly small shuffles, he edges towards the door, eyes darting about himself to check that no one has noticed. He jerks to a halt as the gaze of a stern-looking witch seems to land on him, but it slides off of his startled figure like oil off of water.
“Are you really just…” He flaps his hands incredulously in the direction of the beans. “You’re not even-”
While Draco is left reeling from this new, very disturbing information, Harry kicks a hole in the wall of the shack (the wood is rotted down to near-parchment thickness, but Draco still feels himself flush as he admires Harry’s strength and form) and beckons Draco through. For perhaps the third time that evening, Draco follows after Harry without question and Does Not Think about why he doesn’t question it.
. Imagine you’re in the middle of a shag and in the mid-coital bliss you lose track of time. What then? You look up to find a gaggle of impressionable young firsties gawking at you and you’re just there, trousers ‘round your ankles, dick out-”
and speedily disappears down the hall. Draco almost thinks he hears the sound of a muffled burst of laughter, but then dismisses it as cats mating on the roof or something of the like.
There’s a record player nestled before them, and a pile of vinyls beside it, which Harry lets go of his hand (Draco Does Not Mourn the loss of it) to sift through. He slips one out of the pile and pulls it out of its sleeve, placing it on the turntable.
’ Draco thinks as he attempts a polite smile and the wrinkled duo shuffles speedily away as though expecting him to turn his baby-murdering ways on the elderly next.
Whilst being a blessing, the sudden cold is a jarring contrast to the suffocating heat of his own skin, and he begins to feel lightheaded. Pressing the heel of his palm to his temple, he lowers himself weakly onto the lawn and tries to gather his bearings.
Draco, blushing ridiculously and praying that his hand hasn’t gone clammy, gulps and lets Harry lead him over to the beanbags.
Somehow, despite the muted pace, Draco feels dizzier than he had when they’d been spinning like hooligans mere seconds ago, and the nerves he feels flutter in his stomach make him worry he’ll throw up his beans all over Harry’s robes.
Draco sighs heavily and watches Harry nod along to the rhythm, until his eyes slip down to where Harry’s lips are mouthing the lyrics and realises that if he
No one had approached him thus far to hex him or otherwise engage in conversation (not that he’d expected much of the latter). Even so, he can feel sweat slickening the back of his neck as he stands, tense and stiff, in the same position he’s been in all night, just
“Well, Malfoy,” he booms, easy grin spreading beneath the straggly wires of his moustache, “‘ere’s me officially acceptin’ yer apology.”
’ to. Bu’ yer lookin’ a’ me like yeh don’ think I shoulda forgiven yeh ‘cause yeh haven’ forgiven yerself. Like yeh can’ believe I’m talkin’ to yeh, ‘cause
“Yeh know, Malfoy,” he starts, letting his eyes wander around their hiding place before catching Draco’s eye once again. “This is near where I firs’ told Olympe that I was Half-Giant.”
shoved right to the back of it, Draco decides to make his way to the kitchen to see how Harry’s faring with the food preparations.
(He has to wonder; who is he and what had he done with Draco Malfoy? But somehow the sight of someone as equal a mess as he is has bolstered him enough for him to feign a natural conversational upper-hand).
Draco grasps the conversation opening with all the desperation of a man clinging to his childhood rival’s waist as they fly away from a fire that is almost literally alive.
Draco glances over at Harry to find him stuffing the “iPod” back into his pocket. He glowers at Draco, and the young Malfoy feels an odd sense of deja vu as the Gryffindor’s eyes glint with determination and he sharply extends a hand.
It is possibly the least romantic way the question could’ve been asked, and Draco has to physically restrain himself from swooning.
having all of his faults come back around to smack him in the face? - when the colossal man speaks again into the awkward silence.
It still hasn’t quite sunk in that Harry had invited him over in the first place, and now that here’s here, surrounded by tidbits and niknaks of Harry’s life, he can’t help but notice how intimate of a gesture it had truly been. If he wanted to, he could walk over the rug that Harry’d worn down to threads with his own feet, could take the dog-eared novel from the coffee table stained by Harry’s brimming mugs and settle on the sofa where Harry had probably curled up to sleep at least once or twice, turning through pages that Harry had thumbed seemingly a thousand times over before.
They fall into silence again. Draco, already emotionally wrung out from his conversation with Hagrid and now spontaneously stargazing with a boy he’d once stepped on the face of, can only think:
“-Yeah, kinda gross, grown man sleeping in the dorms with us for years- anyway, then Remus comes in and Hermione outs him as a werewolf, then
The first few notes cry out into the night air, lilting and defiant, before the rumbling of percussion begins, crashing into the twanging of strings.
He expects Harry to ask what he’s doing living out in the middle of nowhere instead of at the Manor, but - much to his relief - Harry only barks a laugh.
The dusty crescents pressed beneath Harry’s verdant eyes betray his fatigue, but they hold Draco’s own with a campfire-like affection, and his boyish grin is languid and easy as he pulls Draco in to loop his arms around his waist. Draco, in turn, settles his arms over Harry’s broad shoulders and allows himself to sink into their embrace when Harry does.
Harry awkwardly attempts fluffing up a throw pillow, then stuffs it on top of what looks like a discarded pair of boxers on his threadbare sofa as if Draco hadn’t seen it already.
The narrowness of the tunnel means their shoulders are pressed against each other, and though the air is frigid, the whole side of Draco’s arm that is in contact with Potter’s feels as though it’s burning. The silence in which they’re walking only serves to make him even more hyper aware of that particular stretch of skin, which is yet another thing that he definitely does not want to examine, so he fishes around for a conversation starter to break the tension just so that he Does Not Have To Think About It.
This, Draco muses, would be worth at least a dozen knuts in the “Finding My Former Enemies Relatable” jar.
“Er-” he gestures around the room lamely, and scratches the back of his neck. “Make yourself at home?”
With a slightly hysterical mental shrug, Draco decides to offer a relatable tidbit of his own. An olive branch, of sorts.
It’s… strange, hearing his own words from someone else’s mouth. He’d never thought before that he could have something in common with the Half-Giant, though he supposes his previous prejudice had caused him to view them both as worlds apart. There’s something like comfort - an odd kinship in knowing that they’re not so different, that
Draco had. The day after the Wizengamot had given him parole, with his wand confiscated for the following year, the Slytherin had sat in his then-new country kitchen, armed with several rolls of blank parchment and a quill. After a few hours of oscillating between staring blankly at the page and scribbling down whatever gibberish first sprang to mind, he had come to the very distressing conclusion that he didn’t know how to write an apology if his life depended on it (which, at the time, he very much felt that it did).
"Not to mention, the legend has claiming the Elder Wand be from killing its old owner. Killing him would have made absolutely
"I would look down if I were you," he hissed to Ron. "Not much point in Potter fighting for our lives if we just get ourselves killed gawping at the Basilisk first."
Of the other items, he could only be said to have succeeded at keeping emotional distance from Ron and Potter, not of his own accord. And finding Dobby, which he had done even less to accomplish. And he told himself he had gotten over his obsession with Potter by all this enforced distance. But the thought of dueling him yet again sent shivers through Draco anytime he thought of it. Draco told himself that was just from the knowledge he had to set a snake on him.
"NO!" Draco yelled. "I'll take us to- to a hospital- to St. Mungo's, I'll make a Portkey, there's another way, there has to be, you're not going to

war heroes and victims, honouring their loved ones as though he hadn’t been on the side that was responsible for their murder.
to share in Harry’s grief when he’d been on the side responsible for their deaths. But Harry looks at him and smiles, and Draco’s heart flutters in his ribcage and he thinks:
“Uh, yea-” he clears his throat “-yeah, sure. Just down the hall then to the right. The white door, not the wooden one.”
The years after the war had only worsened his anxieties. His father, condemned to life in Azkaban, hadn’t lasted the first year. His mother, meanwhile, was left roaming the Manor corridors like a ghost, mourning her sister and husband, eyes even more void of life than both of them combined.
Potter’s hand, Draco notices, is still shaking slightly, but less so than it had been when he’d sat down. There’s mud in the cracks of his palm, and red crescents where he’d clearly dug his nails into the skin when clenching fists.
With his heart seemingly determined to give him internal bruising, he whips his head ‘round to check again that no one’s watching, before darting towards the door and grabbing the brass handle like a drowning man pouncing on a plank of driftwood.
, but the words die on his tongue when he finds Harry’s broad, firm chest pressed against his and Harry’s free hand on the small of his back.
With his upper-body performing it’s wearied chicken-dance (and he desperately prays that no one is around to see it), his legs begin a stumbling gait across the dewy field to the hidden gap behind the greenhouses. It’s a spot he remembers as the prime location for most of his randy teenage rendezvous; he shakes his head sharply as though he could physically fling those painfully awkward memories from his skull.
Draco, being a very easily goaded individual, easily gives into the goading, scowls at Harry and slaps his hand into the proffered palm. Then he yelps and trips as Harry abruptly drags him in the direction of the lawn.
Draco coughs and reaches up to rub at his eye to cover the fact that his face has flooded bright red.
The night air is cool and crisp, and Draco flaps his arms about a few times in order for the chill to reach the damp patches at his pits.

Flushed and awkward, Draco clears his throat into his fist and backs away, whole body screaming reluctance, and turns on his heel to head back inside. His chest and hands feel infinitely colder now that they’re not pressed against Harry’s and he curses himself for his cowardly propensity to flee from every mildly frightening situation.
His hands shake, and he has to physically restrain himself from throwing the door open and hightailing it out of there like his feet are on fire, lest
