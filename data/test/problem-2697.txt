“You know what I mean.”
He wanted to go back to sleep very badly, mainly so he didn’t have to face the memories from the night before that were slowly but surely trickling back into his consciousness. He couldn’t quite believe it all had actually happened, but the proof was in the fact that he was definitely not in the hotel room he was meant to be sharing with Malfoy.
“I’m not avoiding anything, I’ve had games,” he tried but Ginny looked unimpressed.
“Nothing. She just made a comment when I went to check on you after you were hit.”
Harry huffed in annoyance. “Because it was rude of him, and I was sick of putting up with him anyway.”
“I’m fine,” he replied, trying to keep his face impassive.
“I used to see him play Quidditch when my aunt would take me to Hogwarts games as a child. For a ginger blood-traitor, he's not half bad.”
Harry laughed a little at that. “Yeah, I don’t think there would have been anything you could have said. I probably would have decked you with the state I was in.”
Even when he was snoring softly, Harry didn’t let go. He wasn’t sure how long he sat there for or when he fell asleep but when he was jolted awake by the mediwitch  coming in, the sky outside was dark, and they were still holding hands.
“Um, yes?” Harry was starting to feel like that was the wrong answer.
Harry pulled away and gave him a watery smile. “Everything is fine. I need to go, though. I’ll see you at training?”
It worked well: they both enjoyed taking the edge off after a stressful game and it was nice to have something to look forward to that wasn’t just having a lonely wank and falling asleep with his socks on. Harry knew that it was only a matter of time before things got more complicated but for the moment it was too much fun.
“Who knows? If we’re no longer doing whatever it is we’ve been doing.”
“Don’t call her that. And I know, but it’s depressing having it just sit here like this.”
They dressed warmly and made their way down the stairs and out into the crisp day. There was still a hint of wetness in the air, and the ground smelled damp and fresh.
It was true. When Davies had taken over as captain at the beginning of 2004, it had been during a period of a mass exodus of some of the most experienced and accomplished players in the team, a few of whom Harry had played with in the 2002 World Cup. They had been forced to get creative with their recruitment, which resulted in one of the youngest teams in the league’s history. Cootes had barely finished his OWLs when he’d played his first game. This had made them the subject of ridicule and mockery in the
“Suit yourself,” Draco replied. He stripped down to his underwear, leaving his Quidditch clothes in a neat pile on the rocks and then made his way into the water.
Harry woke up late. The storm was still raging outside and the light coming through the large windows was dull and watery. He felt so warm and cosy in bed listening to the rain against the window that it was only the smell of porridge emanating from the tray on his table that pushed him to get up.
Draco closed the book quickly, looking a little queasy. “There’s definitely mermaid blood in there,” he said, putting it carefully back on the shelf.
He was overwhelmed by the clean scent of his skin, so different from any woman he’d ever been this close to. Malfoy’s clean, slightly damp hair smelled of citrus, wood, and something expensive that Harry couldn’t identify. Some loose strands brushed against Harry’s cheek and the cold of it on his heated skin made him feel feverish.
Puddlemore Park was uncharacteristically full for an early-season match, Harry noted as he got into position. He wondered how many were there to see he and Malfoy go up against each other - a fair few if the signs were anything to go by. He didn’t blame them.
“I suppose… Is it different from dating birds?”
He cleared his throat and spoke:
Ron made a sympathetic noise. “That’s rough, mate. Can you pull out of the tour?”
Malfoy sighed dramatically. “It’s only a very small castle, really. A castlette, if you will.
“What am I saying.” Malfoy pinched the bridge of his nose, eyes closed. “Of course you do.”
“Er…” Harry swallowed, glancing from Malfoy’s face to his dick and then back again.
Ginny sighed and ran a hand through her hair. “I just want you to know that even if we're not together, you’re still part of the family.” Harry felt the knot in his stomach tighten. “I know you’ve been avoiding Christmases and things, but you need people. You can’t get through life without your family.”
Snitch out of the sky, and Ron grinned the whole way home. Harry was also feeling pretty good, considering they were up to play the Magpies in two weeks.
he thought finally. Harry had never been known for his self-control so he wasn’t particularly surprised to find himself reaching for the little silver device on the bedside table after only a minute of internal battling. Just one text couldn’t hurt.
“It’s true.” For some reason, Harry felt it was very important that Malfoy believed him. “You come off really snobby and rude but actually you’re quite thoughtful.” Malfoy stared at him, so Harry continued. “Well, maybe not thoughtful but you think about things, like, deeply or whatever.”
“On the game or on your personal struggles?”
“Hang on.” Harry turned to face him fully. “That’s not how this works. You’re supposed to apologise too.”
He stormed over and shoved Malfoy with all his might, and Malfoy shoved him back. It wasn’t a real fight, but it was enough to cause the heads of the people around them to swing in their direction.
The good news was Ron’s face wasn’t red anymore - the bad news was it was now green.
Draco pulled him back so he could look into his face and kissed him gently. “Don’t be stupid. No one would stand you up — you’re the saviour of the wizarding world.”
“How…” Harry started, but Malfoy didn’t answer. Instead, he just smirked and lifted his hand, opening his palm to reveal the Snitch fluttering inside.
They showered in silence, everyone else on the team was gone by the time they were dressed, and Harry avoided eye contact as he packed his bag. Why had he ever thought he could be friends with Malfoy? He felt foolish and grumpy. It was so typical that Malfoy would use his own kindness against him...
Because it was a wizarding hotel, Harry was able to Apparate directly into the lobby. He’d stayed here plenty of times before so he knew exactly where he was going as he headed for the elevator and rode it to the fifth floor.
“Well, I just mean what you said about me the other night.” Even to his own ears, Harry’s argument sounded weak.
“Fuck off,” she cackled. “You absolutely smashed it and you know it.”
“I just don’t like going out. It’s exhausting.” His annoyance was subsiding slightly, leaving him feeling wrung out.
It was a truly ungodly hour when Malfoy finally slipped through the door. Harry wasn’t asleep - there was no chance of that - but he resented the brief flash of light from the corridor nonetheless. He listened to Malfoy bumping around the room with a growing annoyance.
“If this is because you feel guilty, don’t. The Bludger wasn’t your fault.”
He fell into a fitful sleep, dreaming of Lochinvar.
“Potter, I swear…  If you don’t move, I’m going to die, or kill you, or both,” he complained, and Harry didn’t need to be told twice, pushing into him.
When Draco had asked Harry
“Maybe they’ll escape.”
got to spend time with
“Well done,
“Are we gonna wait until next lesson, or are we gonna go now then?”
“Don’t want them to worry. They have enough to deal with themselves.”
— perhaps he’d put up with his friends’ bigotry too much for Remus’ tastes, but he’d never actually joined in said bigotry.
“I’ll have two people nagging me about homework!”
He lightly dozed, not really listening to their conversation. After a while they left, and it was just him and the warm magic again. And then—
wards, and since it’s keyed to my mother, f–Lucius can’t get in.” Harry glared at Draco, but sighed and nodded at the point. Harry realised that he’d perhaps been staring at Draco a moment too long when Ron spoke.
, glowering at Harry. “Master called?”
He put on his uniform by muscle memory, hoping that none of it was inside out, and splashed some water on his face before emerging. Ron thrust his bag at him, before walking with long strides out of the room. Harry accioed his glasses, shoving them on his face and noting with no small amount of satisfaction that his uniform was, in fact, on correctly. His bag was bulging slightly, but his desk was clear, so Harry jogged after Ron, silently cursing the redhead’s longer legs.
Potter arrived at the exact same moment as the group of Slytherins, so Draco decided to get his attention before entering the hall - at least he wouldn’t have to do this at a table of Gryffindors.
He walked back into the bathroom, firing a
Harry sighed again, scrubbing at his eyes before putting quill to parchment again. It wouldn’t do to stare at Draco
to use a pensieve, but nothing could prepare him for the stomach–churning sensation of falling down a hole combined with the fact that his feet were still planted firmly on the bedroom floor.. He closed his eyes against the swirling greens and blacks of the pensieve, opening them when he’d stopped spinning.
He had to figure out what he was to do next. Most of the ministry was under his control — he had a living, breathing, machine, designed to wipe out all the muggleborns and blood traitors. Once that was done, and they had no opposition, they could start on the rest of Great Britain; and once the muggles were under his thumb, he’d have even bigger armies to take over the rest of the world.
“Well, there was the whole Chosen One thing. And that prophecy.” Harry’s words felt distant; he might as well already be under the Manor, walls closing in, bars slamming shut over the door. It was just him and Voldemort; except this time, there was nothing stopping Voldemort from killing him.
seen. He closed his eyes, escaping to an uneasy sleep.
“It was…informative,” he murmured in reply.
The moment he wordlessly vanished the glass wasn’t a moment too soon, as Draco’s concentration was broken by a white...
Draco sighed - now was not the time to be arguing about Harry’s self-sacrificing instincts. Never mind the fact that he was putting himself in situations that were likely going to result in a panic attack.
Flying around the room, at a rather leisurely given the situation, he looked for that familiar flash of blonde hair. On the second loop, he spotted him - perched precariously on a chair on top of a stack, his posture surprisingly relaxed. “Took you long enough,” he drawled, allowing Harry to swing him onto the back of the broom, his nonchalant tone of voice betrayed by the tenseness of his arms around Harry’s waist. Harry looked for the door, decidedly not concentrating on how Draco was pressed flush against his back, not concentrating on Draco’s breath tickling his ear, not concentrating on the rising temperature. After what seemed like an age, he spotted the little door, spelling it open and tumbling out.
Later that day, Hermione and Dean went out into London, coming back with an uncannily accurate, black wig. Kreacher brought down a set of Bellatrix’s clothes — her taste hadn’t changed much, thankfully — and with a bit of altering, Narcissa was dressed up, with her own face, but everything else resembling Bellatrix. Harry took one look at her, and his face immediately drained of colour. Draco found him throwing up in an upstairs toilet.
Lessons were horrible. Umbridge dropped in on lessons without warning, looking for any way to fire any teacher that wasn’t the Carrows. Nobody had expected her to support You–Know–Who this wholeheartedly, and yet the only teachers she praised were the Carrows. Defence had simply become Dark Arts, and muggle studies was now a study of everything wrong with them. Filch hated Umbridge as much as the student body, after having been dragged into many muggle studies lessons to be treated ‘as muggles should’ and, in an odd twist of fate, had taken to helping students late at night to avoid Umbridge and the Carrows.
She put her wand back in her holster, and palmed two knives from seemingly nowhere. Her grin grew, showing far too many teeth. She threw the two knives in quick succession, the sharp blades easily cutting through his clothes and leaving two deep scratches either side of his ribcage.
“I’d first like to thank you all for coming today. I’ll cut straight to the chase; we’re here to formulate a plan, perhaps not to fight You–Know–Who directly, but to thwart his plans.
He threw open his wardrobe, the jumper already half off, to find it empty, because today was the day he’d asked his house elf to deep clean and steam his clothes.
“I’m sorry I gave him your room, but it’s the only other clean room in this place, and mine has my bras and stuff…”
“Breakfast started an hour ago and will run for another hour, and the elves will give us anything we want anyway.” Harry fell into step besides Ron, who looked at Harry as if he was from another planet.
“Okay.” Draco drew the drapes around Harry’s bed, his chest aching at the look in Harry’s eyes. He sighed and shook his head - Harry needed space, so space Harry would get.
been hiding out there?” Draco asked.
had a crush on him.
that Lily wanted to be closer friends), would have liked, and Lily always criticised his friends (with good reason, but it still hurt at the time). His Slytherin ‘friends’ had just been interested in harassing muggle–borns, and the ones that weren’t didn’t really want anything to do with him, having been more interested in either advancing their opportunities in life or hooking up with people. Friends in Slytherin, at least while Severus had been young, had always been about networking; not Severus’ style.
“They’ll be proud for making connections with the Chosen One, of course.”
“I — that’s true, but we — we still need to get him out.”
“I just have to press that knot, right?”
“Brilliant. How the fuck do we undo it then?”
“We’ll wing it!”
and his invisibility cloak, like that night on the tower, while watching the Weasleys being tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange, after the curses she’d fired towards Ginny and Molly during the Battle had struck true.
“Ooo, testy, testy.” Malfoy tutted, before holding out a glass of water. “This first.”
He gritted his teeth and looked around, once again. He was about a hundred metres away from the Burrow, but Remus and Fleur stood at his sides, ready to act if anything went wrong. He looked at his bandage again — it looked as fresh as when he’d first put it on. He gritted his teeth and started unwinding it, averting his eyes when the mark was exposed to the damp, summer air. He forced himself to look at it, the black ink start against his pale skin, and took a deep breath.
“Actually, that would be good — all the big safehouses are too far away to get to safely, and have stronger wards that can't be manipulated as easily, so it's been a bit cramped.”
Harry proceeded to get ready with a huge smile on his face, which was quickly wiped off when he saw the weather.
All of them smiled slightly at that, before leaving.
“Only if he’s killed by the Dark Lord,” he made a face, “but the potion relies quite a bit on Ancient Magic, so of course
, which revealed an unnervingly high number of people, but they were far away. “This is probably keyed to allow my father’s blood in, and therefore me, but would you just put up some wards to warn us if someone comes?” Draco murmured quietly.
It was more than that too, though he couldn’t quite put his finger on what that more was. He just knew that the image of Malfoy’s hand in the man’s dark, messy hair was seared onto the inside of his eyelids so that every time he blinked it was like he was right there. The sound that Malfoy had made, that breathless sob, rang in his ears louder than the indie rock playing over the speakers of the cafe. Something twisted in his gut.
The corners of Krum’s eyes crinkled and he looked for a second nothing like the stoic Bulgarian Harry knew. “Yes,” he replied simply.
He slipped off the invisibility cloak and shoved it into one of the maintenance closets. Steeling himself, he rolled his small shoulders back and tried to stand up as tall as possible. He gripped his wand in his pocket and then stepped into the bathroom. Malfoy wasn’t looking at him so he cleared his throat, causing the Slytherin to jump about a foot.
“Potter.” The gentleness in Malfoy’s voice stopped him. “Of course they do something. Do you think I just put them on for fun?”
“Is everything alright?” Harry asked nervously before he could stop himself.
The second game was a mess - it had all the problems of the first match with none of the game-saving brilliance of Malfoy. Harry did his best but he knew he wasn’t on top form. By halftime, he’d already missed a few key shots at the Snitch.
for the art featured in this chapter!
Draco was nowhere to be seen, Harry could only assume that he had gone to take his regular early morning bath, so Harry was forced to drag himself out of the warmth to retrieve the letter in the bird’s beak.
“Malfoy...” he breathed. He made a tortured noise when Malfoy lifted his head.
In response, Harry opened his mouth and made loud chewing noises at Draco. “I’ll give you a mouthful,” he leered, earning himself a very hard punch on the arm.
“You wanted to get up early?” he asked in disbelief. “But you’re still in bed.”
“Fuck it,” he said under his breath and began stripping his own clothes off.
“Maybe that’s because you need to sleep to get better.”
Harry squeezed his eyes shut, rubbing his eyebrow and willing the red haze to disappear. “Um, I mean… I think you know the answer to that one.”
Draco gave him a disgusted look. “Don’t speak with your mouth full, you absolute pig.”
Instead of heading back to the hotel, they made their way down to the waterfront. It was a series of wide walkways lined with a few bars and boat sheds on one side and the harbour on the other. Small lights on the ground and in the eves of the buildings lit their way. They passed a few people as they walked, but it was quiet for the most part. The wind was strong enough that they would have been chilly without warming spells, but as it was it was rather pleasant.
Draco glared at him. “I was venting.”
She didn’t look very impressed but strummed her instrument nonetheless and a small doorway opened up to her left. “Appalling manners, these Quidditch players,” he heard her mutter as he scurried inside.
“You’re wrong.” Harry felt his eyes burning and he adjusted his glasses to swipe over them with the heel of his hand in frustration.
“Speaking of…” It was Rita Skeeter piping up this time. “When will you both be ready to be honest with the public about your relationship?”
“Potter, if your broom obstructs the goal one more time, I will genuinely come over there and beat you to death with it, alright?” Davies’ tone was light but his expression made Harry relatively sure he wasn’t joking.
“That was shit.”
“Mr Potter, I hear you’re thinking of becoming an Auror. I’m here to tell you that that is a terrible idea,” she had said briskly, with no introduction.
It was odd to watch him from a distance like this, to be able to see all the little parts of him that Harry would normally be too distracted to notice. Like his legs: he had beautiful legs, strong and fit from years of flying, dusted with the perfect amount of hair, golden blond instead of white. His thighs which flexed slightly under Harry’s gaze were muscular and solid. His hands with their long, clever fingers, just a little bit calloused and worn from years of Quidditch, despite the gloves.
Harry sighed and scrubbed his hand over his face. “You don’t know that. You were playing well too.”
She gave him another withering look and swept off.
She looked up from her breakfast and gave him a wide smile. “Good morning. You have to try the pancakes, they're insane.”
Harry couldn’t help cracking a rueful smile. “You’re probably not too far off there, to be fair. But you didn’t answer my question.”
“Call what now?”
Harry clinked their glasses together, trying to summon some confidence.
“Do you ever think things would have been better if we’d never been together?” she asked quietly, picking at the blanket they were sitting on.
“Potter,” Malfoy said, and his voice sounded odd and tight. “What are you doing?”
“If you say so,” Harry said with a laugh, but he was already pulling away from Draco and slipping out of bed, letting a burst of cold air into the cocoon.
The Snitch dropped too, whizzing towards the ground at speed. They needed to reach it before it got too close or changed direction but they were jostling each other. Harry’s broom was bumped by one of the Scottish Beaters but he pushed through, using his legs to maintain his speed.
Something about seeing his life all planned out like that, certain and solid, should have made him nervous. Instead, he found it to be a comfort. It mapped out the next two years of his life in a series of colour-coded bubbles: the rest of the regular season through Christmas and into the new year, then, if all went to plan, the Cup final in July. A pink bubble showed the month long tour of Australia and New Zealand with the British and Irish Thestrals that he’d be invited to participate in during September and October 2005. That would be interesting, but as soon as he returned it would be straight into qualifying games for the World Cup with the English team and, hopefully, the European Cup in early 2006. That would keep him busy until the 2006 League Cup, and then it would be off to Scotland for the World Cup.
Harry pulled Wood to the side with slightly more aggression than was necessary. He was fuming. “What the fuck, Oliver? You’re putting me with him?”
“There’s no winning for me - can’t you see that? If you win, you won’t need me anymore. And if you lose...” Draco’s voice wavered slightly at the end and he got to his feet quickly. “I have to go. I’m expected back at camp.”
A few minutes later, they had sunk to the floor next to each other, catching their breaths.
Harry watched as Malfoy mounted his broom but remained on the ground, placing both of his hands on the broom facing the same way. Harry tried to mirror it.
“Alright, my mistake.” It was impossible to miss the amusement in Malfoy’s voice but Harry tried his best to ignore it.
Harry felt a roll in his stomach and barely made it to the wastepaper bin before his lunch came back up. The Australian witch watched him, her smile wavering only slightly.
He passed the microphone on to Davies and stepped back, taking a deep breath.
“Did you watch?” Malfoy bobbed up beside him again, looking a bit breathless but pleased with himself.
There was nothing for it but to get up and put his glasses on, even though it was his day off and he had purposely given himself nothing to do until the afternoon when he and Ron had planned to attend a Cannons game. With a grumble, he dragged himself out of bed and down the stairs to the kitchen, the promise of coffee the only thing keeping him from kicking a hole in the wall.
Malfoy blinked a few times very quickly, and then stuck his hand out. “Not to gloat, no. To thank you for a good game, and to say I look forward to playing against you again soon.”
Draco’s face betrayed nothing except for a slight tightness around his eyes.
“You need to have a laugh,” she used to snap in frustration when his moping got too much for her. “You’re wallowing and it’s unhealthy. I didn’t even make the World Cup Squad but you don’t see me complaining about it.”
Harry closed his eyes and willed himself not to get annoyed, and when he opened them again Malfoy had thankfully turned his back on him. He watched in silence as Malfoy went about his complicated and frankly exhausting morning routine, a full hour of which took place in the bathroom.
“It’s morning, Potter, time to get up,” Malfoy called nastily, sounding far too awake.
Malfoy cleared his throat, making Harry jump a little bit. “I’ll show you that move I used against you in that game a while back if you like," he said quietly and Harry had to turn and look at him to make sure he’d heard correctly.
Benjy threw his head back and laughed. “Calm down, Harry, you look as if I’m going to give you a bollocking.”
“You have to watch,” Malfoy chastised.
On the morning of the fifth day, Harry woke up in Draco’s bed. He stretched out in the sheets and luxuriated in the warmth of the blankets and the soft pillows. For a moment he couldn’t figure out what had woken him but then it came again, a tap-tap against the glass of the window.
“Speak for yourself,” Draco spat and for the first time Harry could see hurt in his eyes.
“Oliver, you don’t understand…”
Harry blinked, thrown, “Yes I’m pretty sure.”
“Are you alright?” Angelina asked again, brow furrowed.
Please go check out
Harry froze for a fraction of a second, and then quickly turned and slipped back into the crowd, hoping Malfoy hadn’t seen him. His heart was racing for some reason, so he headed straight for the bar and ordered the strongest drink he could think of. As he leant against it, he tried to slow his heart rate and process what he had seen.
“Actually,” Ron fussed with his tie. “If you could go and check on Hermione that would be great. I’ve been banished.”
The domestic Portkey was nowhere near as bad as the international one, but it still made Harry feel nauseous, and he had to swallow hard to stop himself from dry retching when the world finally stopped spinning.
The next night, Malfoy came back even earlier. Harry still had the light on, trying and failing to read his book. This time he didn’t seem surprised to see Harry still awake. He came in silently and sat down on his bed to take his shoes off.
Harry stayed near the back, watching as his teammates got drinks and began to mingle with the French players. He was joined after a few minutes by Angelina and Cormac.
The photo was bad - extremely bad - but if possible the words emblazoned across his chest were even worse.
“Welcome home, Master Draco.” She bowed slightly when they had exited the car and were standing in front of her.
The irony of that last one made him snort with laughter. The actual (former) Death Eater in the room turned to look at him.
“It’s just that I’ve never been with someone like them before. I’m not sure that it’s a good idea.” Harry gnawed on the inside of his cheek.
“He has.” She nodded. “But he hasn’t fixed everything. He probably will never be able to have the kind of public image he wants. So do you see the problem? You will always have the power in the relationship. You will always be able to control his happiness with one word to the media.”
Harry rolled his eyes and came over to sit on the end of the huge bed. “No, you couldn’t. How’re you feeling this morning?”
Harry snorted in spite of himself. “You’re a double negative.”
In the afternoon conditioning class, Harry made sure they were paired up. They were doing sprints, competing against each other, and Harry didn’t even complain (much) when Malfoy tripped him a little in order to win. Very mature, if he did say so himself.
Nobody else in the classroom notices his distress, which allows him to count to ten without an audience. His heart is hammering far too fast to be healthy, and the inside of his nose burns with panic. Draco starts packing up his things strewn across the desk.
Severus waved his wand, and his suitcase shrunk to the size of a bee. Draco picked it up from the floor and tucked it inside the pocket of his travelling cloak. It weighed lighter than a quill. "You've packed everything?"
“Maybe.” Hopefully not.
"It was shit. Yours?"
Draco screams and falls off his bed with a lasting bang. A series of curses slip past his lips, and his arm blossoms in pain. Tears sprang to his eyes. He pulls himself into a tight ball, shoulders trembling.
“Okay. So you don’t mind if I tell you Cho Chang mentioned she found him quite cute, as well?”
“He’s not going to do that to the students, is he?”
As Mrs Weasley bustled over to try and smooth out his hair, Harry mustered up a weak smile and said, "Thank you. Really."
It takes ten minutes for them to get through everything-- the facts, their theories, their questions. By the end, Draco has a solid idea of what has been transpiring between the three all year. It had been triggered by Zabini, the kid from the train so many months ago, who challenged Harry to some sort of duel. It continued with an extraordinary amount of eavesdropping and guesswork.
"Nymphadora, just put on the damn lamps," Severus hissed.
Luna cuts into a piece of bacon and shoves a forkful into her mouth. “He’s in my year,” she tells him. “That little boy that was always following Harry Potter around. It’s such a shame he’s been murdered.”
. “Did you need something?”
Pushing past, Draco squeezed his way inside, vaguely aware of Harry and Ginny doing the same, Longbottom with a tad more hesitation. Luna was sat by the window, her copy of the Quibbler upside down in her pale hands. Grinning, he dropped into the space beside her, saying, "Hello, Luna. Do you mind if these idiots take some of these seats?"
Weasley shook his head, "Not since before the game. She was setting up a tent with her dad."
Draco leans down and brushes a kiss on her cheek. "Luna Lovegood, you
Draco took a deep breath and blocked out everyone around him. He thought of how he felt after his most terrible dreams, the fear in his veins. He focused on the swirling white fog inside the orbs and Saw... “What the fuck?”
Draco reached out a hand and brushed a few strands of hair from Harry's sweaty forehead. "I don't..." he trailed off, unsure of how to explain it. "Why can't you just know? Like Luna? It'd be much easier that way."
This was the closest they’d gotten to talking about it. Granger had gotten swept away by Krum, and Weasley was still distracted by Fleur. For all intents and purposes, they were alone. “Harry, what I said that night. I wasn’t kidding. Me liking boys is part of my, er, identity, I suppose, and if you don’t approve of it, then I can’t—“
Potter doesn’t let him go. Draco groans and gives up, resigning himself to witnessing an argument between two friends. “What? It’s just a name. It isn’t like he’ll run off to tell Snape or anything.”
Potter shoots him a glare. Draco (he can’t help it) winks.
He had informed Luna of everything that transpired the previous year. For some reason, he already trusts her, and she’s always ready to listen. Nobody else at Hogwarts finds her anything other than looney, but Draco knows there’s more to her than that. The Sorting Hat placed her into Ravenclaw for a specific purpose, and though she was definitely intelligent, it isn’t the sole reason. It wasn’t with Draco after all-- something he also confessed to her. The hat’s words often come to him at random moments.
Potter wants to show him something after supper, and they head in the direction of what Draco supposes must be Gryffindor tower. He waits by the Fat Lady’s portrait as Potter runs up to grab whatever it is.
Draco glared at Terry. "You doubt my talents? Well, watch and have your world be transformed, Terence. Tu es le pire sorcier que je connaisse!"
Draco got dressed quickly. He dragged a pair of silk pyjama bottoms up his legs and left his chest exposed. His room was mostly bare, with some knickknacks thrown around to make it a home. In one corner, there’s a stack of unread books and a cold tea he must’ve forgotten about from last weekend, while on the opposite wall was covered with a collection of strung-up moving photographs.
a joke, but Draco knew the actual art of Divination wasn't. Wizarding history was filled with real prophecies and Seers. It was just at this point in them they'd gotten pretty unlucky with their fortune-tellers.
“Really?” says Draco, far too eagerly. He tones it down and tries scowling, but it doesn’t feel natural on his face. “I mean,
Lilac, because it was simply bizarre.
“Oh, we aren’t working,” Potter explains. “Ever since you mentioned Nicholas Flamel, we’ve been trying to find out who he is.”
He narrowed his eyes. Was Potter that oblivious to his own power?
Draco had a lot of practice at lying and was about to put it to good use, but Harry beat him to it. "Sirius. I'm wondering when he's going to write back."
“Ron wanted me to forget you,” Potter confesses. Draco furrows his brows. Ron, Ron, Ron. Weasley? It must be. He thinks of that redheaded boy and all those stories his father had told him about the Weasley’s in the past. It’d make sense if this Ron character was trying to warn Potter off. Their families did
“Well enough,” Snape says. “And you?”
Tonks pulled Draco away from the elf and murmured in his ear, "Best leave him to it. I've never seen him like this before. C'mon, Sirius'll be in the kitchen."
Harry only managed one song before slipping away, just as he spun Luna around a couple of times. Draco pulled her back in and smiled down at her dizzy expression. "You good?"
Moody looked as though he disagreed, but didn't push it.
, he thinks, preparing for the worst.
Predictably, Weasley choked on his bacon. Draco pretended this reaction didn’t discourage him, and simply poured a glass of pumpkin juice for himself. Harry, who sat beside him, looked mostly curious, and a bit worried. “Is something wrong?”
Anyway, Potter and his chumps were out at the courtyard during lunch, and Draco definitely didn’t follow them. He had just wanted to escape that Luna girl for a little while. She was lovely and all, but only in small quantities.
“I have to, Harry,” Draco murmured. “It’s my future.”
He spins around. Massive trees are set up around the hall, with various amounts of mistletoe and holly are hung along the walls. Snow is falling from the ceiling, except it’s not bitingly cold. Instead, it’s dry and warm. Overall, the effect combined is simply beautiful. Draco’s sure he’s gaping.
actually gave it to him. “Why did you show me?”
Fuck off, Draco thought. Fuck right off.
Tears stung at his eyes. Only minutes before Weasley was defending him, calling them friends. And now— now he was accusing his father of something with no evidence. Draco clenched his jaw, and said, “Thanks a lot. I think I’ll be going now.”
“Busy time at the Ministry, isn’t it?” Draco’s father asks idly. “All those raids… I do hope they are paying you overtime.”
With Harry's presence, Draco was sure that they were getting more and more visitors with the more time that passed. Several times a day the doorbell would ring, which then prompted Draco's great aunt Walburga to start screaming her head off from her portrait downstairs. It was torture in the most amusing form.
Sometimes, Draco wished he had never befriended Harry Potter, simply so he wouldn’t have to get caught up in the inevitable drama that came with each year.
Draco stretches out, cracking his fingers and back. The sun is setting behind the perfectly shaped bushes down below, which casts a pink shadow across the roof of the Manor. It's a pretty sight and enough of an encouragement for him to stand and begin packing his necessary belongings. Starting with his robes, a set of silk pyjamas and a Muggle outfit Luna bought him, he carefully folded each item and put them in an order that ensured the best use of the trunk's space. Next, Draco packed his socks and some shoes, followed by his most recently bought journal, which is placed right at the top with a couple of other books. Once the trunk is clicked shut, he dragged it to the door and reclaimed his spot by the window.
Draco whimpers. All his secrets are written inside that thing, and if Potter somehow worked out how to use it... "I'm not kidding, Potter. It's dangerous. I swear on my mother's life."
“Well, well, well - Mr Weasley!”
“We’re looking for Nicholas Flamel,” Weasley shrugs. “Unless you’ve changed your mind about telling us?”
He only half-listened. Terry was seated a couple of seats down, but had made no movement to try and talk. Draco sighed and attempted to pay attention. Finally, everybody got Sorted, and Dumbledore stood to go through his usual whimsical words - "To our newcomers, welcome! To our old crowd, welcome back! There is a time for speechmaking, but this is not it. Tuck in!"
In his third year, Draco left his dormitory and was attacked by one Pansy Parkinson’s lips. It had been his first and most horrible kiss. When she asked if he’d enjoyed it and he said, “No,” Pansy claimed the only reason why he wouldn’t have is because he’d’ve rather been kissing a boy. Never one to leave sleeping dragons lie, Draco had gone and found himself a boy to kiss instead. It was safe to say Pansy’s cockiness had turned out right for once.
There was something in his face that Draco hadn’t seen before; surprise, certainly, and a tinge of gratitude. It sent an inexplicable jolt of warmth over him. Embarrassed, Draco said, “Was there anything else?”
Yet, when February came, the broomstick was returned and deemed perfectly safe. Draco finally thought the three would get over their little spat, only for Weasley's ugly rat to go missing the same night. He claimed Granger's cat had stolen it.
Potter opened it up to a random page. Draco read over his shoulder. It was one of the older ones, before he'd started at Hogwarts. The entry mostly detailed his daily routine, but at the end, he'd written a recount of a dream in messy, childish handwriting.
p.s. i changed the title of this fic because i felt like it didnt match with the story anymore (used to be Nothing Noble About This Life)
Something, indeed.
"Good. Communication should be kept strictly verbal, from now on. Letters can be intercepted," he added, at Draco's confused look. "You've used the Knight Bus before?"
"What, and you do know French?"
"There's nothing there!" Moody bellowed. He'd almost forgotten the man had been there. "But I'll be happy to tell the headmaster that your mind was so quick to jump to Harry Potter!"
Draco dropped his eyes closed, willing sleep to come. It does easily; blessedly. Images of a dark-haired, green-eyed man follow him into his slumber.
Finally, Trelawney gave one final turn. She glanced in, then gasped and let out a scream. The students who had already been watching immediately huddled around their table. "Oh, goodness— my, boy, oh! You have, you have the
The Weasley family are there when he arrives, because why wouldn’t they be? It’s not like Draco had

Draco.
"I was the same way when I heard you'd been put in Ravenclaw," said Tonks wisely, after they'd both gotten back in their seats. "I thought for sure you'd be a right git like the rest of the family. Well, not the rest-rest of them. Sirius is alright, but he's a bit depressing to be around, so I haven't gotten the chance to have a proper chat with him, yet. The Order has me pretty busy, you know."
As she was speaking, there was a sudden rainfall of rancid pus that squirted over them. Draco was just quick enough to escape the worst of it, by covering his head with his arms, but Harry and Longbottom weren't so lucky. They looked like a giant had puked its breakfast all over them. Grimacing, Longbottom said, "I'm sorry. I've never tried that before! Don't worry, it isn't poisonous."
i would let sirius black raw me
Draco rolled his eyes. "It can't be. My mother's French." Kind of. She hadn't been raised there, or anything.
"Boys, boys," Draco murmured. "That's what I like."
Draco swallowed nervously, resisting the urge to flee. Moody always made him feel queasy. "I mean no disrespect, Professor, but I really don't think that's any of your business."
Resisting the urge to spit something worthy of a slap across the face, Draco looks innocently up at his father and says, “I just find them fascinating. Perhaps you’d rather I asked Hagrid about any magical creatures I’m interested in when I return to Hogwarts? He’d be
Of course, you did, Draco thought. He'd learnt about it in a book, as well, though likely a much darker one than Goldstein had, as it had come from the Malfoy Manor's library.
Zabini was kind of handsome, Draco thought, until he started talking in his annoying drawl. "I know about your secret."
Helga had been a Christmas gift a few months before, from Hannah Abbott. She’s got a thick orange coat and intelligent blue eyes that sometimes made Draco wonder if she could read minds. The name had also been Hannah’s idea, much to his chagrin (and eventual approval). Ironically, Helga wasn’t much of a Hufflepuff at all, unless being a brat somehow translated into being hardworking.
“My darling,” his mother sobs, pushing Potter away to be closer to Draco. “You’re alive. Thank Merlin.”
“Um,” he replies, eloquently. “I’m Draco.”
“Derek Matthews?” called Draco, and watched a green-haired teenager stand up. Some of his face was green as well.
Oh, but Harry sounds so damn sure. And Draco knows what Severus thinks of the great Harry Potter, how he treated him during class. Everyone at school knows.
... Well, that's rubbish. History of Magic will be cut short...
Black been a Gryffindor, too. Draco found out about that after raiding his mother's closet as a child and finding photos of both Sirius and his little brother at Hogwarts together. Sirius had been wearing a red tie and was likely only in second or third year at the time. Draco thinks they're a bit alike, in the breaking away from family traditions way— not the murdering Muggles and following the Dark Lord way. A shame, really, that Sirius wasn’t actually as cool as those photos made him out to be.
Draco stares at the glittering silver that Potter had dropped into his palm. It’s a necklace of sorts, with a single pendant hanging off it. “It’s very pretty.”
. He breathes out heavily, relieved, and uses the moment of Potter being distracted with his things to run away. A bit cowardly, sure, but it was his only option.
Harry looked the most shocked.
a voice whispered nastily in his brain.
Weasley hurries off. Pomfrey began fixing up his leg. Draco bites down on the pain and clutches at Potter’s hand.
Draco scowled at her. "Don't be mean."
For reasons he cannot articulate to even himself, Draco hasn't moved from his spot by the window in hours. When he realises this, a burst of shame crawls along his legs, so he reaches out a hand, slowly, to the abandoned book near his feet.
knew Harry’s true feelings, it would be his best friends.
Tonks stuck to the opposite side of the corridor, discreetly clutching her wand and staring straight ahead, but it was of no use. As soon as Umbridge was within striking distance, she sent two hexes flying towards Tonks. She deflected them easily, the files creasing against her abdomen, and thought
are going to sleep.”
“Hermione? What — what’s happened?” His gaze flicked around the group — all the adults were standing, but Draco—
a little voice in Harry’s head told him, but he barely heard it as he watched Draco squirm beneath him - his hair was a mess, his cheeks were flushed and it was doing terrible things to Harry’s mind. Finally, Draco was on his back, apparently where he wanted to be since he stopped moving. Harry intended to move, but he was too busy staring into Draco’s eyes, the silver almost swallowed by dark, dilated pupils. Their breath was mingling, as Harry was still supporting himself by his arms. Neither of them moved, not daring to break the moment, but suddenly the tension snapped. Both of them moved as one, towards each other, lips crashing together with the urgency of a couple who don’t know how long they have. Draco’s arms started trailing up Harry’s arms, eventually settling in Harry’s hair, as the kiss deepened, their lips slotting together as if they’d done this a hundred times before.
Since then, they’d all been hiding out at an old Black safehouse a few miles from Malfoy Manor, deep in a forest. No one had come knocking, so they’d figured this one, at least, was probably safe for the time being.
“Yeah, yeah, show-off,” Harry rolled his eyes, “will you go get the ingredients? What cauldron do we need?”
He ran headfirst into some aurors, all under the imperius, based upon their sluggish movements and slightly dazed expressions, before they hardened into suspicion.
Draco had been concerned for most of the day that Potter was missing, however Granger and the Weasel didn’t appear too bothered so he didn’t fully panic until Potter wasn’t at the Halloween feast. He had wolfed down his dinner and near sprinted down to the kitchens, claiming he ‘felt unwell’ to the rest of the Slytherins. They didn’t appear to question it at the table, but he knew he would be in for a grilling in the common room.
Harry didn’t sleep, just listened to Draco’s rhythmic breathing and stared at the wall with glassy eyes. When Draco woke up, gently tugging his arm out from underneath Harry, he didn’t move, not to sit up nor to cling to Draco like he wanted. He lay, staring at the wall, not really listening to what Draco said. He didn’t feel anything, except that he wasn’t leaving his bed. He didn’t want to go outside, he didn’t want to talk to anyone, he didn’t want to eat.
He closed his eyes, just for a moment, but the steam and soothing scent of the soap must have made him pass out, because next thing he knew, he was in bed.
“I thought we agreed to use first names, Severus.”
“Yes, it would be on the documents, because we cannot send owls to their houses. I can get them to you by Thursday at the latest.”
He dipped the cup into the purple liquid — he could see a silver chain and greenish S that looked oddly familiar. However, halfway into the action, he heard a thud to his right. The cup fell from his hand with a
“What about Po —
dealing with Potter, and his bullshit. It ends here and now.
Face completely neutral, he continued into the Hall, vaguely nodding along to Ron and Hermione’s conversation. He obediently shovelled bacon and eggs into his mouth, not even tasting them. He washed them down with tea, still nodding at Ron and Hermione.
Remus raised an eyebrow before looking at Bill, who’s shoulders were shaking with silent laughter. “Sure. The ones we used in school probably weren’t the nicest spells, and in any case, it’s not the severity of the spell, but rather the way you use them. A simple wingardium leviosa can be used to drop someone out of a window. Or throw knives at them.”
Draco was...numb. He considered what Flitwick had just said.
. Merlin, his life was fucked.
“Do you have

you can keep your breathing even, but I heard it change when the others walked in the room. Were you listening to the conversation?
“She’d a very recognisable owl, Ron — we’ll have to glamour her feathers on top of the disillusionment charm.”
“Fine.” Harry grabbed the shirt and his pyjama bottoms, walking into the bathroom and locking the door behind him before using the toilet, pulling on the pyjamas and brushing his teeth. Harry marvelled at how soft the fabric was against his skin, determinedly ignoring that this was
“Did he see you?” Severus asked.
“Do you think we could go up early?” Draco wondered out loud, falling off the sofa when Pansy, Blaise and Theo all shouted
, exactly, and leaving him to stew for all of five minutes before Draco had walked directly over from the Slytherin table.
Potter glared at him, but Draco’s words were clearly working as his breathing became more even. Draco decided to take a chance and rub small circles into Harry’s back — it had always helped him when he was younger, after a nightmare, when his mother would rub his back. He felt a pang of sadness at the thought of his mother, but no, now was not the time to be feeling sad. Now, he had to be there for Harry.
“How many people did he murder here?” Ginny wondered out loud, as they walked over limestone paths that were now decorated with dark red stains.
Draco,
Draco frowned. “Her allegiance is to her family, although I’m not sure whether or not she considers Lucius family anymore. I’d be surprised if she’s left — for now, she’s safe in there as long as she acts the part — but she may eventually leave. If we encounter her alone, she might be willing to join our side, if only to follow me.”
“Me? Die? Never.” Harry’s voice — what was left of it — trailed off before he could finish the last word. His eyes were so heavy...maybe a little nap.
Ginny rolled across the dirt, but misjudged, and slammed into a tree.
Draco nodded his approval, thrusting an ashwinder egg, mortar and pestle at Harry before chopping up a horse radish in perfectly sized slices. Harry ground it up and moved to put the contents in the cauldron before his wrist was caught by a pale hand.
“Brilliant, it worked. Have you found the bond yet?”

Like a muggle cartoon.”
Severus summoned a vial and a silver knife, offering them to Voldemort. He made quick work of half–filling the small vial, before healing the cut and returning the objects to Severus. “How quickly can you have it done?”
Preferably a blowjob (he’d had a fair few from Blaise, in sixth year), but at the very least, to the scent of breakfast. Perhaps that was his high standards showing, but a man can dream, right?
Draco’s curiosity quickly turned to horror, however, as the door swung open to reveal an emaciated child, wearing only grey boxers that were a few sizes too big, curled up against the wall, sitting on a bloody cot. Draco shuddered to think just how exactly it got that bloody.
“Severus? No, that’s weird.” Bill frowned, before grinning in delight as Ron walked in. He immediately ran over, wrapping him in a hug.
“It’s been an entire week since I last fell asleep in the bath, and I’m feeling way too antsy for the balcony. Anyway, I’ve got a functional magical core—”
“Yeah,” he muttered, shoving the parchment at Draco. He narrowly prevented it from falling into his food, scanning the parchment until he saw, in slightly different handwriting,
“Exactly, Harry — they
Remus started to cry as well, an old ache resurfacing in his chest. He’d be able to see Sirius again, one day — and Sirius still loved him.
“If you must.” Severus moved to the side, allowing Draco to enter.
“Of course, my Lord.”
“Excellent.”
He’d felt...detached, since charms. Like something was leeching his emotions away. He hadn’t felt particularly angry at the person who tried to hex him on the way to the library. He hadn’t been particularly amused at a funny joke he overheard.
Therefore, she was very much awake when her husband abruptly stormed out of the room, and when the rest of the death eaters started charging down the corridors. She followed slowly, putting on slippers and a robe before padding down the corridors.
“Anyway, I should probably get back to the safehouse, so the kids don’t worry.”
It consisted of three parts:
to kill Harry — which they didn’t, obviously — they couldn’t, because of that stupid potion.
He stood, brushing pine needles off his clothes, before he realised — he was in
“Try saying that down the bond. We both know I’m not going to be able to do it.”
Draco frowned and looked up from his meal, scanning the room - what had everyone been betting on? But nothing seemed out of place - the Ravenclaws still had their various books, likely nothing to do with what they were learning in their lessons, the Hufflepuffs were still giggling away or writing letters, the Gryffindors were still loud and raucous and the Slytherins were civilised. A few random sixth and seventh years approached Harry, and Draco purposefully unclenches his fists. Harry could date whomever he wanted. He watched as Harry’s face momentarily morphed into confusion, before he nodded and said “thanks.” Hopefully not an offer for a date on the next Hogsmeade weekend, then.
He checked on the web of
“Ay up Harry! Long time no see!” Seamus grinned at Harry as he sat down at the table.

“So what do you want me to do?”
Explanation enough.
, but it was better than just staring at the wall. He skimmed the text, not really absorbing the information.
Bill stiffened, and Fleur appeared as if summoned, taking a seat beside her husband and leaning against him for support.
“Yes, I packed this morning.”
“Did you not hear Hermione announce it to the entirety of London? A trap!” Draco said, slightly hysterical and still holding Narcissa’s hand, his knuckles white.
“What’s happening?” Hermione watched anxiously nearby, clearly stressed because she didn’t really know what to do.
“Gr-Hermione. Can I talk to you?” His gaze flickered back and forth between herself and Ron, who’s arm had tensed around her shoulder.
“What do you want to do, Seamus?”
Once again, an awkward silence settled over the table, the four of them quietly eating their food.
Not what Draco had done, but something much, much more. A demand, and a promise.
“Thank you, Harry.” Harry smiled, a soft, precious thing. Which quickly changed as his eyes glinted dangerously.
and grasped onto it with two hands, digging his fingers in — how did he have fingers here? — so as to not get whipped away by the furiously swirling thoughts.
“‘Mione, he’s got Dumbledore! I can’t say that I’m not concerned, but he told us to tell
Draco went to the entrance hall at exactly half past eight. His father and Greyback were already in the hall, and Rodolphus turned up five seconds later.
“I would not
“So then, boys and girls, what is the topic of conversation today?” Blaise gestured grandly before clapping his hands together and rocking back on his chair.
Suddenly feeling exhausted, Harry sat back against the wall, gently threading his fingers through Draco’s soft hair, murmuring whatever came to mind under his breath.
Draco refrained from shooting him a venomous look and took a deep breath. “Throughout school, I spent all my time coming up with witty insults, and badges, and songs—”
After the last potion delivered by Voldemort, no one visited Harry for a long time. At least, he thought it was a long time. He faded in and out of consciousness, fully residing in neither. At the sound of heels clicking against a stone floor, Harry instinctively occluded, and didn’t quite come out afterwards. He got vague impressions from outside — a flash of blades and a high–pitched giggle, a horrid smell and an unbuckled belt, long, sharp fingernails digging into his hips. But he didn’t really know. He was a coward — he was afraid. Afraid of the pain, of reality.
jumper - for some reason, he hadn’t taken it off - he practically started drooling at the sight of him walking down the gap between the house tables.
“One last experiment, before we leave, Lucius.
“Ah.” Malfoy’s confused expression was becoming smugger by the second and it made Harry want to deck him.
“You haven’t been getting out of the house much in the past few months. We’re just worried about you,” Hermione said, watching him with wide eyes.
“Draco,” she trilled in a thick accent, holding his face in her hands and covering it in kisses. “It’s been too long.”
“Harry…” Hermione started, but he cut her off.
“Welcome to Sydney, Mr Potter!”
Up close things weren’t any better. Malfoy looked calm and comfortable in his surroundings; like he’d been playing there his whole life. Inexplicably, Harry felt like the new kid.
“Holy shit,” Cormac said suddenly, jaw slack as he looked at something over Harry’s shoulder.
“Your breakup with Ms Weasley, to begin with, seemed to have impacted you significantly, both personally and professionally.”
“Oh, shut up. You know what I mean.” Harry hoped that the dim light in the room hid his embarrassment.
Harry was still stroking Draco’s cheek when he noticed his eyelids begin to flutter, and was embarrassed to find himself snatching his hand away. Draco made a little sleepy noise and squeezed his eyes tightly shut for a second, before opening them slowly.
Harry turned his head to look at him in confusion. “A swim? It’s freezing.”
Ron grimaced and tugged the magazine out of Angelina’s grip. “Don’t lose the plot, alright?” He handed it to Harry warily.
Harry, feeling slightly creepy, shut the door again and turned to resume his exploration of the rest of the castle.
At first glance, Lochinvar Castle wasn’t much to speak of - barely a ruin, no more than a few stones piled at the end of the outcrop which stuck out into the loch like the knob on a puzzle piece. As one got closer though, the glamour began to clear a little and the full beauty of it came into focus. It was less a castle and more a fortress, a collection of buildings and lawns on the peninsula, connected to the land by a thin stone road. There was one main building, a tall, square stone keep, at the far end. Like all the other buildings, it was made out of dark grey stone that looked so ancient it might have grown organically from the rolling grass. The outcrop overlooked the loch, a wide expanse of inky blue water that lapped at the shaggy rocks below.
When he finally got out of the shower he dried himself and fell immediately into bed, pressing his still very present erection into the mattress. His brain felt like it was overheating with the sheer volume of thoughts racing through it.
“These are Una’s children, Kipsy and Luli.” Draco gestured at the ball, which, at the sound of his voice, separated into two tiny house-elves. Harry had never seen a house-elf that wasn’t an adult so he had no frame of reference to tell how old they were, but they looked like wide-eyed children with exceptionally long ears. When they caught sight of Harry and Draco, their eyes got even wider.
He realised belatedly that he had stopped moving and was just hovering above the pitch staring off into the night.
Angelina was still looking confused. “Were they on your bed or something?” Harry shook his head, and her frown deepened. “Why did you get a new room then?”
“Oh.” Draco blinked at him, brow furrowed. “I think I remember, but honestly my head hurts so much I can barely think at all.”
“Fuck off,” Harry snapped, face burning.
“That’s quite a friend you have there, Mr Malfoy,” the mediwitch witch said with a smile. “I’ll be back with your medication and then you can be discharged.”
The water was so cold it knocked the breath out of him. He emerged gasping and spluttering and heard Draco laughing at him. “Fucking hell!” Harry squawked.
The music began to swell, and Harry watched as Hermione and her dad made their way down the aisle. She looked beautiful, as always, but there was something radiant in her smile when she glanced up and made eye contact with Ron.
He was greeted at the door by Arthur who pulled him into a tight, Firewhisky-scented hug.
“My great-aunt.” Draco stopped and looked out over the pitch. “Before the first war she ran a summer Quidditch school here. She always wanted to reopen it but she got busy with her other projects and then she got sick.” He paused and shivered slightly. Harry had the strongest urge to reach out and hold his hand but he didn’t want to interrupt the story. “I think she hoped that by leaving me this place I would one day reopen it. She always was a barmy old cow.”
Cormac made a rude gesture but Harry ignored him and looked back down at his drink. He was focusing very hard on not looking over at Malfoy because he could sense that his feelings were written all over his face and he didn’t want anyone to see them. He was still staring down at his glass when he felt Camille getting to her feet.
Harry was pretty sure he wasn’t one of those, although he hadn’t had any idea he was a wizard at that point so it was really hard to say for sure. He forced himself to think about kissing a boy, Ron for example. The thought made him wrinkle his nose, too weird, and he knew how much Ron burped so there was a very high possibility that kissing him would mean getting close to one of those which was highly unappealing. A girl then, Harry considered kissing Hermione. It was better, but not by much, he couldn’t help thinking about how she would tell him off if he tried to kiss her and it stressed him out more than anything.
“Can I ask you a question?” Harry asked as he lay on the bed in his hotel room in Japan, staring at the ceiling.
“Draco…” Harry stopped, stepping forward to reach out for him.
Once they had vanished their dishes, Draco retreated to their bathroom to make himself presentable. The process of careful grooming always grounded him. He felt his anxiety seeping away slowly as he went through his routine, the version of himself only seen by Harry soon replaced by something more familiar to the wider world. He wasn’t as young as he used to be but it didn’t bother him like he thought it would. There were faint lines around his eyes and mouth that he pretended to hate, but really he was glad for them: they were evidence of his happiness, years of smiles etched into his face for all to see.
Una led them through the front doors and into the entry hall. A moderately sized stone staircase curved up to the next floor, which Una ushered them up. Within a few minutes, Draco had been whisked away to bed and Harry found himself standing in a guest bedroom, his trunk resting at the foot of the bed. It was a generously sized room with thick stone walls and dark wood floor covered with a variety of rugs and furs. The decor was far less formal and grand than Harry would have expected from a Malfoy home. The generously sized bed even had a handmade quilt hanging over the end of it. He went over to stand in front of the huge fireplace, holding out his hands to warm them, and caught sight of the pictures on the mantelpiece.
Experimentally, he took Malfoy deeper until he could feel him right at the back of his throat, making himself gag a little.
“Right.” Davies’ thick eyebrows were drawn together. “Well, if you do need any extra support, make sure you ask for it. You’re important to this team.”
Part of Harry had been surprised to learn that they’d both chosen the same profession but it sort of made sense: Malfoy had always been a good player, his father’s money notwithstanding. France had made sense too. In the years since the war, some former Death Eaters and sympathisers had managed to rebuild their public images, but it would take more than a few charitable donations to make everyone forget about Mafloy’s past.
Harry looked at the other second-year Gryffindors and saw that they were all looking back at him expectantly,
“You and Raphaël used them for… that?”
“Started what?” Harry nibbled on his lower lip.
On nights like this, when the rest of his life yawned out in front of him and made him feel small and anxious, he would stay behind after the team had left and work out in the gym until his body was so tired that he wouldn’t remember falling asleep.
“Fuck,” Malfoy said.
About six drinks and a few hours later he found himself on the deck again, not completely certain when he’d left the table. Christ, he was pissed. Tamsin was sitting on one side of him, chatting earnestly about Antipodean Opaleyes - or something like that? Harry had lost the thread of conversation almost immediately and hadn’t been able to tune back in since.
The man behind the counter was about Harry’s age. The sticker on his shirt read:
“A quick word, if you don’t mind.” Her voice was quiet but commanding. He sat back down without a word. She cleared her throat. “I’m going to say two things - the first as Draco’s agent and the second as his friend. Please take both into consideration.”
“It’ll be bracing,” Draco replied, getting to his feet and picking up their brooms to stow them back in the shed.
During the press conference following the match, Harry was still smarting from the loss and his argument with Malfoy. He ripped little pieces off the parchment in front of him and thrummed with nervous energy, leg bouncing under the table as the reporters hurled question after question.
They made their way back to the castle where Draco went straight to bed. Harry spent the rest of the day reading a book about the Quidditch school that Draco’s aunt had run. He was astonished to find that almost every major name in Quidditch over the past forty years had attended at one point or another.
“Harry, my boy, you played so bloody well,” he beamed, smacking Harry on the shoulder with a power that was very reminiscent of his youngest son.
Harry glanced at Draco in confusion but he was too busy trying not to laugh to help.
“I’m fine. Sit down and stop looking at me like I’m about to expire.”
They were so wrapped up in each other that they didn’t hear footsteps outside the door or the handle turning. It wasn’t until the hinges squeaked in warning that they leapt apart.
“Good afternoon,” Harry said. “I’ve played against your daughter.”
“Well, yes,” Harry shrugged. “You were kind of a git when you first moved back from France.”
“Exactly - but underneath that, he cares so much. That’s why he came back from France. It hurt to know that his home country hated him so much. He wanted to come back and fix things.”
Afterwards, they sat on the sofa and talked about Hermione and Ron’s wedding, the tour, and their friends, which inevitably got Ginny talking about pub quiz nights and dinner parties. Hearing about it deepened an ache that Harry hadn’t even known was there.
Unfortunately, his silence did not seem to be having the intended effect as Malfoy immediately glanced at him in confusion when he didn’t say anything about the alarm. When it became clear that Harry wasn’t going to complain at all he started to get ready but looked a bit perturbed.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Harry said stubbornly. “We’re best mates.”
“For fuck sake, Potter. You walked in on me getting a blowjob, not strangling a kneazle. I can’t believe you’re going to move out because of that.” Malfoy was fully standing up now. “I knew you were frigid but I didn’t realise that it was because you’re offended by the entire concept.”
“Stop.” Malfoy put a gentle hand on Harry’s chest and pushed him backwards.
“Alright Crabbe, jokes over can I have that back now please?” Harry tried to keep his tone light, hoping this would be straightforward. The larger boy stopped swinging it but instead of giving it back, leant over to Malfoy and whispered something in his ear.
Ron paused his reading of the sports page of the
“See you then!” She grinned at him and stepped into the flames.
What he had said earlier stuck in Harry’s mind and before he could stop himself he had opened his mouth again. “So, are you dating someone then?”
“Yeah, there was something I needed to speak to Malfoy about. Sorry, er… Maybe I’ll see you later?” He didn’t wait to hear her response, making a break for the exit.
“There is…” Harry swallowed. He couldn’t believe he was about to talk to anyone about this, let alone Benjy. The Firewhiskey must have gone to his head. “There is someone. But we have a weird history. And they’re a Quidditch player. And anyway, I don’t even know if I want to be with them.”
“Oh, come off it, Harry. I dropped by your room this morning to see if you were up for breakfast and Malfoy said you’d buggered off.” Her voice wasn’t accusatory but Harry still felt like he’d been caught out.
It wasn’t until the beginning of the second week that they finally ran into each other in the dining tent. It had been inevitable that it would happen eventually but Harry was still surprised.
She watched him carefully. “So you’ve stopped… seeing each other then?”
“Well, in that case, I’m very happy you’re going to be my sister.”
“It’s warm!” he said defensively. “What are you wearing that’s so much better?”
They followed Una inside the gate and into a walled courtyard overlooked by the castle windows. It was carpeted in lush green grass with a stone pathway bisecting it, leading from the gate to the front door. Some sort of rain repellent spell kept the courtyard dry but not very warm so they were happy to reach the warmth of the inside.
Draco shuffled over to drape himself across Harry’s chest, resting his chin on his hand so Harry had to almost cross eyed to look at him. “How was the wedding? Any gossip? Did anyone get up and object to the union?”
Draco snorted. “It drives itself, thank Merlin.”
After she had left there was a moment of unbearably awkward silence before Draco spoke quietly. “It was nice of you to stay with me last night but you don’t have to do this.”
Hermione laughed and tugged Ginny into a hug. “Yes, I’m sure, but I appreciate the concern.”
“I’d rather be an honorary Muggle than a slimy little git,” Harry was quite proud of himself for that one. “And I know how duels work, more or less.”
“Want to go for a quiet pint?” Ron asked a little too casually.
He made his way back to the Gryffindor tower so lost in thought that he was startled to find himself face to face with the Fat Lady’s portrait with no memory of how he got there. She gave him a disapproving look but let him in with a warning that he would catch his death of cold wandering around so late.
“That sounds about right,” Draco said and then let out a funny little giggle that sounded so out of character that Harry thought for a moment that he’d imagined it. “Were you worried about me, Potter?” he asked, giggling again.
Malfoy ignored him, “So you really never try to pull, then?” He asked, propping his chin up on one hand. “Surely you’d have fans beating down your door to get a piece of the golden boy?”
Malfoy was still sitting on the machine, but had pulled out his water bottle and was taking a swig from it. He swallowed obscenely, skin still gleaming with sweat. Harry knew he should be repulsed by the sheer griminess of them both at that moment but - as was quickly being established - there was clearly something very wrong with him.
He thought he had it, he was so sure, and then Malfoy appeared out of nowhere at his elbow.
“If you oversleep tomorrow, I might actually get a decent night's sleep,” Harry retorted and then yelped when Malfoy walloped him on the arm. “Fucking hell, you’re stronger than you look.”
“The real question is what are you doing right now, Potter?” Malfoy asked, voice a little lower than before.
How dare Malfoy bring some random man back to their room? Harry couldn’t believe the cheek of it. Where was he supposed to sleep now? He certainly couldn’t go back to Ginny’s room. It was such a selfish, shortsighted, typically Malfoy thing to do that he hated himself for being surprised. He slapped his hand against the wall of the lift in frustration.
“No.” Harry turned to leave but found Parvati trapping him in the door.
Harry wanted to punch him so badly but once again managed to control himself, “I would love to.”
Without waiting for his response she swept from the room, leaving him alone with his thoughts. He knew she was right about Draco. He cared about what people thought a lot more than he let on, which Harry had always known, but perhaps had never properly considered. He thought about their feud. Had Draco really started it? It felt like so long ago that Harry couldn’t really remember. It was certainly true that neither of them had done anything to try to end it, and Harry supposed he had to take some responsibility for that.
“You seem happy,” he observed as they came face to face. They were the last in the lines as was customary.
Harry felt a little like he had been hexed. “Pardon?”
Malfoy stood up and stretched his arms above his head as he began his warm down routine. He moved on to stretch his legs and back and Harry realised that he was standing in the corner watching him like a weirdo. He couldn’t quite bring himself to leave.
“I don’t know!” Harry pressed his fists into his temples in frustration. “Do you want a relationship?” he asked.
Hours later, after the sun had set and the candles that floated high above the guest’s heads had been lit, Draco stood at the edge of the courtyard, watching quietly. He felt somehow both perfectly at peace and overwhelmed with nervous excitement for the future. Draco watched the guests milling about, dancing, drinking and laughing in equal measure. He should rejoin the party he knew, his mother would have had his head if she could see him neglecting his hosting duties, but he wanted to wait for just a moment more, to let himself absorb it for a little longer.
“My hands are… firm,” Harry tried to sound convincing.
“For fuck sake,” Malfoy said under his breath but Harry wasn’t listening. He let himself be guided to the bathroom and sunk down onto the floor next to the toilet with relief.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Draco’s face fall slightly. Harry didn’t know what the situation was with Draco and his family, but he was pretty sure they weren’t going to be flying over to nurse him back to health.
“There’s nothing to tell Potter.” He spat, turning sharply and striding out of Harry’s eyesight, leaving him still perched on the toilet, bewildered as to what had just occurred between them.
Granger, unlike her husband, had warmed up to Draco extremely quickly and much to his chagrin Draco had found himself growing increasingly fond of her too — not that he would ever admit that in words.
“Mr Potter, this is an automated Floo message to remind you that you are expected for an appointment with Ms Pavarti Patil of Patil Sports Management in five minutes. If you are unable to make this appointment please contact Ms Patil’s assistant via Floo or owl at your earliest convenience. Thank you.’
Benjy allowed Harry a moment to gather himself while he pulled up a chair. “So, Harry,” he said, once he’d settled so that they could look at one another. “What else is going on with you? Dating anyone?” Benjy asked cheekily and then chuckled when Harry’s face went scarlet. “I’ll take that as a yes.”
Harry frowned. “I don’t think that’s actually traditional,” he tried to protest, but Ginny was already tugging him to his feet and dragging him to the dance floor.
He sipped his coffee, letting its warmth seep through him as he idly studied the planner he had tapped to his fridge.
“What are you overthinking about?” Ginny’s voice cut through his thoughts and he found her looking up at him.
“Maybe I would be if you were quiet,” Harry responded.
“Yes, well,” she cleared her throat. “It doesn’t matter anymore. It was a long time ago. It has nothing to do with today.”
“She’s a free spirit,” Hermione said, avoiding Harry’s eyes.
“Why does it seem like you’re on his side? You threw out the letter he sent me after Ginny left me,” Harry said, remembering what Malfoy told him.
Hermione and Ron came through the floo right about the time that the alcohol hit Harry. He tipped over and fell back on the couch. They rushed over to check on him, a little surprised that he was drunk.
“I like the way you say my name,” Draco mumbled, pressing a kiss to Harry’s bare chest.
“Creepy Malfoy,” Harry muttered, looking at the wall to avoid their eyes.
“I know. That bitch ruined your life. I can ruin hers in return. All you have to do is ask. You belong to me, and I take care of what’s mine.”
“How about now?” she asked as she moved to sit on his lap.
“Open.”
Harry grinned with pride as he sped up his hips. He heard an odd noise and cocked his head to the side. “Are you touching yourself?”
Ron just looked at him for several moments. “You know, I never did thank you.”
“Mmm, I really love that,” she said with a soft moan as she pressed even more firmly down on his cock. “Now, I will show you where all you’re allowed to touch me for right now. Do not go anywhere else. You can touch me here.” She placed his hands on her thighs again. “Or here.” She placed his hands on her hips. Harry could feel how her hips flared out just slightly. “Or here.” She placed his hands on the sides of her slim waist. “Or here.” She placed his hands on her stomach.
He groaned slightly when she leaned against his chest and tipped her head back to lay on his shoulder to kiss and suck on his neck. Her hand came up to rest on the other side of his neck to hold him still as she left a mark on his neck. He felt her other hand come down. He knew she was touching herself and, fuck, if that didn’t turn him on even more. He gasped when the sucking turned into pain, and she finally released his neck with a breathless laugh.
“So, what you’re saying is that there could be something wrong with me? They might not want to tell you since you’re one of my best friends.”
“Are you sure?” Harry asked uncertainly. “You sound like you’re in pain.”
Harry heard rustling, and he hardened when he realized she was taking off her clothes. He wished desperately that he could see her. He jumped slightly when he felt her hands on him as she pulled his clothes off quickly. She chuckled at his reaction before pulling his pants and underwear down together, setting Harry’s hands on her shoulders beforehand to make sure he didn’t fall as he moved around to help her. He could feel soft hair brushing against his fingers, and he itched to run his hands through the short, silky strands. When he was naked, she used her wand to mutter a few spells.
“Since you lot came barging in here before. He was just too polite to disturb us.”
should be Headmaster. It had been his ambition, once.
“We don’t have time to test it,” Dumbledore continued, “Voldemort is on his way, is he not?”
“Or you could just get a wig,” Dean said. “They do these big, black ones to go with costumes and stuff.”
“Well, I could teach you some, if you wanted. I was a defence Professor, after all.”
Harry looped his arm through Draco’s, still laughing. “You’re such a lightweight.”
At dinner, the couple had walked into the Great Hall to whoops and wolf whistles from all four tables. Draco had blushed bright red, and Harry had turned on his heel and walked straight out, dragging Draco along.
“This isn’t truly goodbye. We’ll always be there.”
“I have no magic, otherwise I’d say Grimmauld.”
romantically, not since Sirius — but he’d been a good friend on the cold, winter nights.
“Well, since your grand escape from the manor, the Dark Lord has become more and more unhinged. Not to feed your ego, Severus, but I really do think you were the only thing keeping him sane. He’s constantly putting his followers under the cruciatus—” Draco flinched, and Narcissa’s head snapped to the side. “No, no, don’t worry. He was just doing it to people who spoke to him, and…well, you know how they are with any woman that isn’t Bellatrix. I stay in the shadows — where it’s safest.
Draco loosed a breath of relief. “It’s one my mother taught me, although I’ve never seen it in any book. It doesn’t have a particular incantation — usually you just say the name of the scent, or flower, if it’s floral, in Latin. The spell is all in the wrist–work — it’s like a drawn out version of the flick at the end of
“Be back in five!” Ron grinned, before dragging Hermione out and apparating.
He realised it was very close to the Feast, so Draco power walked down to the Great Hall, thankful for his long legs. He slid into a seat at the end of the Slytherin table - more sparse than usual, but not as bad as Draco was expecting. The song was terrible, but it always was. Draco was furious at the lack of enthusiasm from his house when the children were sorted into Slytherin, but he refused to draw attention to himself - it wouldn’t do any good for anyone. He tried for comforting smiles - until his gaze was drawn to the Gryffindor table.
A thought suddenly occurred to Remus. The archives would show all muggleborns that had already attended Hogwarts, but what about those who should be going this year? “Professor McGonagall—”
Bracing himself for the name calling, he yelled “Granger! Weasley! I need to talk to you for a minute.”
Harry’s mind was, in fact, a forest, with a gently winding river leading in. There were no hedges like before - Draco would have to teach Harry to keep his mind guarded at all times.
One does not simply
“Butterbeers okay?” Hannah asked, going to get the first round. The rest all headed to a large, round booth towards the back that seated ten and could all see out of the booth at varying angles. It was a wonder it hadn’t been taken yet.
Lucius, however, didn’t seem impressed. “I said we were here to have
, Harry thought, but judging by Ron and Hermione’s sympathetic looks, they knew what he’d left unsaid.
“Not if you didn’t know.”
“I don’t know why
Harry’s hands had started shaking, and he’d jumped out of bed and started pacing - what was going on? Why was Draco in so much pain? Had he fallen down the stairs? What if he couldn’t move?
Ron was too far away to do anything.
Ron told the others about Grimmauld Place, and they keyed the floo networks together so that they’d be able to floo back and forth easily. Since both places had floo networks that used to be connected to the main network, it wasn’t difficult to make an exclusive connection between the two houses.
Harry waved his wand in a better approximation of the bonding spell than before.
“Hermione, can I walk on the weird water?” Ron yelled. Hermione, who was still examining the wall, shrugged. “Give it a go, nothing can happen to you, this is just a memory.”
The four of them apparated to the Weasley’s, Harry and James landing squarely in the middle of the path while Draco and Scorpius narrowly avoided the muddy pit just off the track.
“Probably something to do with one of Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw or Godric Gryffindor. It’s likely that it’s a small cup, but that could be in Hogwarts as well, we’re not sure. It could also be to do with the Gaunt family.”
“Excuse me? I know he survived the killing curse a couple of times, but he’s not
He heard the door open behind him and closed his eyes, keeping his breathing even, resisting the urge to turn over. To stand up and take those short steps to Harry. To kiss Harry senseless and run his hands through his hair, to see if it was as thick and soft as it had been in the dream.
“Obviously not.”
“I know that, but…why can’t we let the world burn? Why does it depend on
He nodded. “Do it.”
amount of death eaters.
“Exploding snap?” Severus raised an eyebrow.
I definitely think there are some more things that could be explored in this AU, and I may eventually do that, but I really don't know at the moment. I also don't plan on doing anything this big for a while; at least until after all my grades have been submitted (still don't know what's going on with the A-levels, but anyway).
— laughed.
Neither of them had a single dream that night.
“It’s beautiful,” Ginny breathed, her brown eyes wide.
“I take it you’re not going to tell Draco and myself about the ‘other’ stuff?”
“So how much did you kiss him? Cheek, lips, French…?” Pansy grinned.
“Blood magic?” Draco said.
, Harry replied, as he was still dragging him along. Thankfully, Draco started walking properly, practically gliding to the table. He slid into the seat between Harry and Luna, who had joined Ginny.
Harry waved his wand, doing the action completely wrong and mouthing the words of the charm. “Your wrist work is terrible, Potter.” Draco leaned back, demonstrating how to do it with his own wand.
Draco glared at Harry, while he smirked. He’d expected a bigger reaction from Draco yesterday when he’d called him Draco, rather than almost nothing - he hadn’t missed the flash of shock on his face. Nothing like the unbridled shock when Harry had successfully conjured a non-verbal patronus (an expression that Harry had very much enjoyed).
“Potter? I haven’t seen you all day. You look dreadful.” Harry didn’t take the words at face value as he noticed a flicker of worry in the grey eyes.
Voldemort skimmed past the method, listed in excruciating detail, and went down to a section helpfully labelled “
“Yes, Hermione. Do not give me the talk or I will die of embarrassment.”
Harry had woken up that morning at 8:53, to the image of Ron’s face about five inches from his. It was really quite terrifying.
Harry looked at Ron. He didn’t look any different than he did in sixth year, before everything. His face was relaxed, probably daydreaming about the food he was going to eat. His posture was terrible, showing he was at ease, and his long legs were stretched out. The only difference was he didn’t try to hide the way his eyes lit up when Hermione walked in the room, and he jumped to his feet saying “Let’s
“It’s manners, Potter. I have no idea why you’re pouring your heart out to me in any case.”
Snape tossed a knife to Malfoy — a small one with a wooden handle — and winced. “The wards aren’t going to hold for much longer. Hurry up.”
Harry scoffed at Draco’s indignant tone, and headed off to the kitchen, sliding into a seat beside Hermione, who was deep in discussion with Ron on her other side. Harry found that he was increasingly tolerant of the ambient magic surrounding Ron and Severus — now, it was more like coarse fabric brushing his skin than needles burying themselves deep inside. “Hi, guys.”
“No! Kreacher tried everything he could…so many powerful spells, because maybe if he could open it, he could destroy it, but nothing worked. Kreacher punished himself, and tried again, but it would not open. Kreacher had disobeyed orders, Kreacher couldn’t destroy the locket! His Mistress Black went mad with grief because Master Regulus had gone, but Kreacher couldn’t tell her, because he was f–f–forbidden to tell any of the family…”
The fat man grabbed the skinny boy’s arm, revealing familiar black hair and bright green, terrified eyes. Draco took a step back, an uncomfortable twisting in his gut.
“Yep, I’m coming ‘Mione.”
“Not to mention, a perm would deflate immediately under the water unless you waited a couple of days.” Seamus added, earning a couple of weird looks.
“I forgot how much I disliked crowds,” Harry said, putting up a
Hermione nodded, a bead of sweat running down her forehead. She kept the fire contained to that one corner for another minute, then two — then she exhaled, and the cave was thrust into darkness once more.
For starters, he’s the boy. The one from his dreams, the one from the robe shop. It’s such an unlikely coincidence, but also makes complete sense. Draco reasons that he must’ve seen a picture of Potter’s parents years before, and his mind created a mix of them to use as a character in his nightmares. He didn’t entirely believe this theory, but it’s better than the alternative-- that he had somehow known what Potter looked like without ever having met him.
"We should sit together," suggested Harry, quickly.
Another first-year was talking to Potter. Draco eavesdrops for a few long seconds before deciding to join in without preamble. It’ll be less awkward that way, he reasons, with how their last interaction went down.
"I remember a lot of screaming happening inside," Draco muttered darkly.
Draco stumbled, again. "People are saying that?"
Draco nods, probably too eagerly. The boy waves and leaves with Hagrid next to him.
"I can't sometimes," said Draco. Mrs Weasley came over and placed a couple of slices of toast in front of him, too. "Are you okay?"
"That's what I thought," said Umbridge, tutting slightly. "If neither you or Professor Trelawney can predict something for me, I'm afraid I'll have to..."
According to Tonks, it was Sirius' idea as a practical joke. Draco didn't find it very funny. After all, he was as much a Slytherin as everyone else who visited the house; not one at all.
He can’t respond. He’s too busy staring over her shoulder. The boy who had entered the shop was the same boy from his dreams. Those green eyes, the horrible hair, the glasses-- all of it! He’s wearing a Muggle shirt with sleeves that fall past his wrists, and grey pants that looked to be three sizes too big, since the only thing stopping them from falling was an ugly old belt.
Severus.
Luna smiled fondly at him. He did it back. Potter cleared his throat noisily. "We should probably try to sleep."
"Malfoy, do you know that your precious potions professor was a Death Eater for the Dark Lord?"
One of the first things he’d noticed about her was how she always spoke about animals like they were actual babies; no matter how dangerous they were. If Draco held any attraction for women, he’d probably find it endearing. “Helga is as mean as usual. Last week, she scratched my arm so bad it
Professor Trelawney hesitated, stiffening, and pulled her shawl tighter around her shoulders before murmuring. "I don't understand you."
costs.
Her tail stuck up as she ate. Draco shook his head, fond, and walked on unsteady legs to the bedroom. His cottage is relatively small, so it’s only a couple of steps to travel. The hallway is dark, but he doesn’t bother lighting his wand.
On the train, he sat with Luna, Harry, Granger and Weasley. The four spent most of the ride in silence.
"Glasses means great discovery. I wonder what about."
“I need you to stand now,” Severus says. He stands cautiously himself and pulls Draco up by his hand. “You have permission to lean on me.”
“You’re alive!” Harry shouts, pulling himself up to sit at the end of Draco’s bed. Granger and Weasley stand on either side. “Are you hurt?”
November 24th came and went, and with it so did the first task. Draco watched from the Ravenclaw stands, screamed in all the right places, applauded when each contestant finished, and boo-ed when Krum managed to make the dragon smash some of its eggs. Finally, Harry came out and Summoned his broomstick, which he used to get the egg in the quickest time. Draco let out a whoop as he watched, and ran for Madam Pomfrey's tent after, where he knew Harry would've been sent for that painful-looking scratch on his shoulder.
She nodded and stole a piece of chicken from him.
“I just remembered I have to do something,” he lies. Pulling his bag over his shoulder and ignoring Boot’s mutterings about detention, Draco hurried out from the classroom. Professor Binns never even noticed the door opening.
Granger had stopped listening, though. She’d moved onto flipping through his book. Her nose starts doing the thing where it scrunches up like she couldn’t decide whether to be interested or disgusted by what she is reading.
The witches and wizards that roam in this alleyway are as hunched as they are cruel, and the shops that Draco wanders by with his father are infested with dark and stomach-turning things. There’s always a feeling of discomfort whirring in the musty air, easily countering the warmth that comes from walking through Diagon Alley’s bustling streets. Draco, fortunately, is rarely allowed to visit this particular part of London, so it had been with plenty of surprise that Lucius dragged him along this morning. He’d wanted Draco to accompany him in selling some useless junk that has been collecting dust in their underground vault for the past century.
He knows the dream hadn’t been real, yet afterwards he cannot help the icy fear running through his veins. Draco rushes downstairs to the Manor’s library to search for books that mention any serpents with the ability to kill people with only its stare. His search is futile, he finds nothing.
