On her eighteenth birthday, Nymphadora Tonks changed her name. Her mother was Andromeda Starchild Tonks, and as much Dora loved her mother…the woman was a hippie of epic proportions. The tail end of the Sixties and the dawn of the Seventies had seen Dora’s mother stoned on acid and tripping at concerts around the country, offering up Free Love to anyone handsome enough to merit it. As a consequence, Dora had been raised without a father, first in small communes, and finally in a quiet rural neighborhood in Wisconsin. Her mother had lavished attention upon her, and clearly loved her baby girl, but she hadn’t had the first clue regarding what it would be like to enter a junior high school and spend the remainder of her school days nicknamed ’Nympho-Doorknob…everybody gets a turn’.
Big Chicago part 25.…by Samayel
We sleep, and wake again, stirred by the reactions of our own bodies. I’m half hard again, my cock and balls cupped in his sleeping hand. He’s as hard as stone inside of me, twitching restlessly in slumber while my eyes flicker open sluggishly, gummed by tears of joy and ecstasy from the night before. I very deliberately exploit this comfortable opportunity. Slipping a hand over his to keep it in place. I love the calloused feel of it against the most sensitive parts I have. Writhing against his lap, stretching and flexing, making myself comfortable despite a soft undertow of soreness that encompasses me inside and out. Wrapping his hand around my cock and pumping myself back and forth against the shaft of the cock inside of me. Purest luxury…and I know enough now to not fear for the sheets. Not after all that we did on them last night!
Harry received more than a few sidelong glances from classmates that had heard rumors about Harry’s weekend plans. Most of the students that actually had shagged before, instantly recognized the look of one who had spent a weekend exhausting themselves sexually, and for once, Harry didn’t feel like blushing.
The Marauder’s Map still gave Harry a window of insight, and he knew that Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini and Nott all took turns keeping near Draco at different times. If someone were to plan a second attack on Draco, it would have to be far more cautious than the last. Thankfully, no attack had come, and with the school year nearing its end, Harry was certain that Voldemort was planning to start the war in earnest, as soon as Harry was an adult and lost the blood protection that once guarded him. At least he could be some help to Draco, even if it was only by being a high priority target that drew fire away from others.
“Thanks. I was worried before…too much. I think I can handle this just fine. But thanks.”
Harry had endured just about enough for any week, much less one morning. He hadn’t dared vent his frustration on Draco, who was in no condition to deal with Harry’s anger, but Snape was fair game.
Draco had groaned into Harry’s mouth when Harry gently squeezed, and he quickly found an even rhythm, similar to the way he wanked himself, then let the tempo rise slowly as he worked, kissing Draco as fiercely and hungrily as he could all the while.
Soft, dark hair that barely hid clean skin and lines of muscle. His hand was slithering its way around the erection before him. This…this he knew how to do and do well. Not every visit to the Continent had been a lonely waste of time, but he’d never had a reason to do more than the minimum necessary to satiate a lover. No one had mattered like this.
After the incident at the Charitable Ball, he’d hastily Apparated an unconscious Draco back to Malfoy manor and handed him off to the house-elves. A muted pop and he’d been back at the party, and after the press hounded him to the point of frustration, he’s simply left with Luna.
“Hey. Wake up! Time to earn your keep…lazy girl!”
“How’s that? Better?”
“Sweety, I don’t know what you might have heard, from your mother, but I can’t say with any certainty what I am…or am not, I just…I don’t have a great deal of experience at that kind of thing. Mr. Potter…and I…”
----------------------------------------------------
"Merlin! Potter, that thing...with your thumb. I gotta give credit where it's due! That was brilliant! Mmmm. Where'd you learn that!"
“Draco, Lord Malfoy, let’s discuss what to do with your time at Hogwarts. Congratulations…you’re now a student…again. Let‘s see if we can make the experience a little more worth your while.”
’He didn’t really love me. Not the way I loved him. He must have…felt something. Like…or lust. Not love…or not enough love. He never lied to me. That’s why he never spoke about it. That’s why he always hushed me or changed the subject. He didn’t try to pretend there was more to it than there was. I did that. Ron was right. The others would have told me not to get involved with him. I didn’t want to hear it, because I didn’t want to believe it was true. There wasn’t anything else I could have done to make it work. I didn’t do anything wrong…not really. Except perhaps expecting too much.
“DON’T YOU FUCKING TOUCH ME! GET OUT! YOU DON’T KNOW ANYTHING! GET OUT OR I SWEAR I’LL FUCKING HEX YOU! I HATE YOU, YOU FUCKING BASTARD!”
I settle for rather melodramatically jumping into his arms, and true to form, he catches me reflexively. That’s when I see it. The tightness of his jaw, the shift of weight to compensate as one arm takes over for the other. The faintest hint of a wince of pain. It stops me cold, but it can’t mean anything serious. Just a pulled muscle or something. But he’s avoiding my eyes. It’s all wrong. I can feel it in the air around us.
“No. I should have said this to someone before now, but there was never anyone worth saying it to. My mother’s family practically disowned her. She was an intellectual and a firebrand, a radical compared to the lumps in the rest of her family. That’s how she wound up getting recruited in college to work for the early Phoenix Corporation along with my dad. When my parents died, the only people left to take care of me that were related by blood were her sister’s family. They didn’t want me. They made sure I knew it too.
He leads me to the library, mixes a Screwdriver and hands it to me. Vodka and orange juice. I take my seat beside him and try to follow his instructions about relaxing, but my mind is still racing with thoughts of Blaise and Harry and finding a way to make this one less risk for Harry to take.
“Yeah. I suppose it does. Very much. You okay with that?”
“What the FUCK were you thinking! Do you have any fucking idea what you just did! GOD DAMMIT! You…you…”
There is a den full of shelves with books by the ton. There’s a study with a music system that shames the one I had at home when I was sixteen. Classical music, jazz, swing, big band, blues. CD after CD of it. There’s a computer that looks ready to go and better than the one I grew up with. The funny part is that, with a building to explore and a world just outside of it that I haven’t seen in the better part of this decade…I just want to go to bed.
Nothing came to Blaise’s mind for an answer. Just empty shock. This shit was real. It was some horrible fucking mistake, but it was still real. There had always been a way to make things work out, a way to cut a deal, a little wiggle room in every situation. This was different. This was two men he couldn’t buy, a car he couldn’t stop, and a drive that would end with him flopped across the ground in some empty warehouse while boots and batons hurt him in places that people couldn’t see in a mugshot photograph. A shiver ran down Blaise’s spine, and a hot, tingling, tightness curled around his gut while his pulse pounded in his ears. The feeling was new to him, and when a sheen of sweat broke out across his body, Blaise realized it was terror.
Draco’s mouth closed, and it was easy to see that he was having trouble pulling his head away, he seemed utterly disoriented, and haunted when he turned to speak in a near whisper to Harry.
“…and the best part of the last three weeks is getting to come home to this. Thank you, Harry. You’re a gentleman in barbarous times. Enjoy the roses. I thought it was high time I proved that green can, in fact, go well with red. Don’t let the lesson in that be lost on you. These won’t be butchered easily by your ‘black thumb of death’ either. They’re from the gardens at home. Narcissa Malfoy’s own enchanted roses. They’ll hold their vitality and scent for weeks before the magic fades.”
“So who are you taking this year? I remember the Prophet from a few years ago…the one where you took Loony Lovegood. She interrupted the main speaker to correct him and remind the world that funds might be directed toward the ‘Save The Crumple-Horned Snorkack Society. Never minding that said society consists of three people, nutters all, and that no such creature has ever been sighted in the history of wizarding kind. Talk about embarrassment!”
Always, the map was a vast blur of moving marks and names, covering every level of the castle, and a certain measure of the grounds as well. He’d started with the towers and upper levels, working his way slowly to the dungeons and catacombs, and it took time to manage, since so many moving blips could easily distract his eyes. Even so, Harry was long used to the map and scanned his way across its surface carefully, becoming more and more concerned as Draco’s name didn’t make an appearance.
That mollified her more than a little. She stops bristling and relaxes, but she still looks irritated about being taken for a fool for this long. Obviously she’s brilliant, but when it comes the world of social interaction, I have her completely outmatched. Come to think of it, I’m about as handy with languages as she is…almost. If I brushed up a bit my Italian, Spanish and French would be fairly respectable. She’s the computer whiz though. I never bothered to learn more than I needed to surf the net for porn when I was sixteen. Programming the blasted things would be very, very out of my league.
The Echoes Of Yesterday…by Samayel
He hadn’t really dated much since then. There had been a few very nice women, but Harry supposed that, in his heart of hearts, he wasn’t really comfortable sharing himself and his private life with any of them. He’d let each relationship wither on the vine, rather than face the daunting prospect of intimacy he didn’t really want or feel comfortable with. He was still a fit looking bloke, even past thirty, with hair that finally behaved reasonably well, glasses that were more stylish than his old ones from school, and he’d even grown more comfortable in a suit and work robes than his gawky, teenaged self had ever been. It wasn’t that he couldn’t attract someone, it was just more effort than the eventual trouble would be worth. And that was that.
If you remember your lessons about wishes...they may come true, but never without some cost. I became female...instantly. While I was still reeling from the shock of that, I was informed that it would last a year and a day, exactly. I had time to conceive and give birth, assuming I used it wisely...and if I didn't, that was my problem, not the Djinn's. That's just the beginning. I swam to the grotto in men's swimwear. I had to swim back topless. Thank Merlin it was Greece! They're a lot more forgiving about that kind of thing on the Continent!
Luna made a marvelous lover. Thoughtful, sweet, and perfect with little Diana, and even Andromeda had fallen for the smiling, earnest young woman that was almost more akin to her than her own child. They’d made a nice life for themselves here, and Dora could call herself truly content at last. If they could be said to have an occasional conflict, it would have to be over some of Luna’s wilder theories about the way the world worked. Dora could barely bite her tongue through some of them, and every now and then she lost it and just laughed out loud, which always pissed Luna off to no end.
“Treat them like human beings who have actual feelings. You’d be surprised how often that gets results. I’d suggest that for humans, too, but I’m going to assume you already know that. We’re lucky to have house-elves that look after us, showing a little appreciation for them doesn’t cost a thing, and it certainly makes them happy.”
As it turns out, I’m not really that bad of a shot, and the recoil on this model is very mild, so my wrists can handle the slight kick when it fires without completely spoiling my aim. Not bad really. I don’t like the idea of ever using it, but I’m not required to carry it with me all the time. I have forged special permits for it, all legal looking and backed up by Hermione’s ability to change the local records for such things. My records might be a little shady, but Mr. Deacon Malloy has never had so much as a parking ticket.
Draco had discovered, perversely, that seeing a lover's satisfaction in his arms was as heady a thrill as any diversion he'd ever entertained before. He also discovered that Harry had kept most of the piercings below his neck! Harry had lived a lifetime without the pleasure of a lover...and in Draco he had found someone chiefly interested in pleasing him as much as possible...which took considerable endurance. After years without even the slightest possible indulgence, Harry was hungry to make up for lost time and it showed in his nervous, almost desperate neediness. Draco savored the one privilege he'd most desired...seeing Harry respond sexually, not with relief or jaded disinterest...but with frenzied intensity and naked appetite.
Five whiskeys later I had him. It took a lot of fast talking, keeping my cool demeanor and heavily implying that I could deliver all the pain he needed, better than the best he'd had, and that treating him like garbage would be a walk in the proverbial park for me. I wasn't lying...I am confident in my abilities and my experience...it was just a matter of convincing him of that. Our first encounter was in the alleyway behind the pub, and I used him like the pathetic cast off thing he was. I left some marks, but not a fraction of what I could do if I had time and leisure in a place more suited to privacy. I left him bruised and used, with my number and told him to ring me up if he needed more like that, but with the promise that anything done with planning would be infinitely more intense.
He doesn’t turn around, or even twitch, and silence hangs over this shitty little cell for a string of heartbeats.
“Sir…I…”
That was as intimate as two people could get, right? Surely Draco would stop refusing to kiss him once they’d really done it. Anything would be worth such a triumph. Anything.
In secret we met-
He tastes like scotch and fire, and I’ve had a few cocktails between extended rounds on the dance floor. Poor Ron has to drive despite the way we’re entwined behind him, with me almost comfortable in Harry’s lap, except for the starved hunger that makes our necks twist while we savage one another’s mouths. He whispers words that melt my mind. Sweeter than cocaine, more heady than Ecstasy. I want him so badly that it genuinely hurts. I want to drown in him, be filled by him, let him drive out the air in my lungs while I float into oblivion in his arms alone. All that I’ve endured, and still such a passion can overtake me? So be it.
“Ma’am! I am so terribly sorry. He grabbed the wrong phone. They look exactly alike. Please don’t be concerned…we’ll make sure that doesn’t happen again. No ma’am. Please tell him that all is well on our end. Business is very good.
“I know. Doesn’t mean I can’t try to help, though, does it? I’ll have to think about the life debt, but I’d never ask anything of you that…that…well, nothing like last night would ever happen! I wouldn’t do that to you, I promise.”
Draco curled a little closer, holding Harry just a little more tightly to him. “Harry?”
A hand is on mine and Harry is giving me a bemused look while I get dragged off by a girl I obviously know. He probably finds it amusing, because he’s sweet and very secure in himself…while I discover that I hate being away from him for more than a few seconds. I want to be grafted to his skin…or worn like a permanent accessory, like a tattoo. But no…I’m headed for the unisex toilet with Pansy, in a bizarre flashback image of a hundred bar nights years ago.
“John…you’re a good friend. I think there are a few things I need to say right now, while I feel lucid. It’s kind of you to say those things, and I know you believe them or I wouldn’t even have heard them, but there are issues…things you need to understand before you make assurances like those.
“And then what? Do you really know if murder would make you feel better…or worse? Is one murderer better than another? How many people would die every day…if we justified our actions with revenge for the hurts done to us? Would there be anyone left? You wouldn’t be the aggrieved anymore, you would be the killer with blood on your hands, running from your crime for the rest of your life. Is that anything your parents would have wanted? I don’t think so. I told you I want better than that for you. I meant it.”
He needed more information, and Hermione probably shouldn’t know about this…it opened the door to too many uncomfortable questions…not the least of which was why Harry was in a Prefect bathroom with Draco Malfoy after curfew. He needed to know what kind of creature that snake had been, where it had come from, and who helped Zabini or Nott get their hands on it. Then he could deal with the rest himself.
Bottle of beer. Opener for later. Soap…shampoo…some sea salts for the bath. Ready. I take my place behind him, and slip my legs around his back, seated on the outer edge of the tub, while he rests on the comfortable inner edge that forms a seat inside the tub. Now is the time for the beer to come into play. I turn it sideways and place it just along the back of his neck, then roll it gently against the muscles there.
He had talked to a few people. Ron and Hermione, Minerva, and a brief visit from Hagrid…who had gotten a bit teary eyed about Harry being sick so long. Cho Chang had passed through a day ago, and Neville had dropped by again, this time far less ferocious than before. All in all it wasn’t that bad, but Prewett had become more relentless in his ‘conversations’ with Harry, and Harry knew full well that John was in ‘counselor mode’. Every chat this week had hinted at drawing out details from the past, dredging things up from the depths of Harry’s mind that weren’t simple cut and dried issues.
I let hot water run down his head, trying to avoid the fresh bandage. Let my fingers work shampoo into his scalp. I’ve never really done this, but I’ve been to salons before, and having your scalp massaged is a pleasure that can’t go wrong. He looks like he’s relaxing. Not worrying so much about me. I can feel myself calming a bit now that I have something very tangible and physical to occupy me. This is better. This is good.
Months of that kind of fucking up ensued. Nothing went right, couldn't get a shag to save my life without messing it up somehow. Spent most of the time just drunk enough to sleep through a war or high enough to not care if I was awake next to one. Then a fellow took me along with him to a club. An underground club. I'm pretty sure it wasn't even legal. It wasn't a bondage club...I didn't even know what that shite was. It was just a sex club. The things I saw disgusted me. The degradation. The contempt for anyone but themselves. The narcissism. It was appalling. But it hit me then and afterwards that they had something in common with the prick bastard that I'd done it with the one time before: they were selfish shits who just wanted to get off and didn't give a flying fuck about the person they were with.
Harry went first, overwhelmed by the sensation of a skillful hand working his shaft and ever so gently brushing his glans in the process. Thick and pearly gobs erupted outward, trickling down Draco’s wrist and spattering against the other boy’s hips and legs.
“I don’t…want to…talk about this…anymore. I’m sorry I brought it up. Let’s…review my work. Student…teacher, right?”
Tonks made a great section chief, and her fondness for Harry took the edge off of the slow grind of days. She forgave his occasional lapses at the office, since he really was a better than average Auror. He’d been sensational as a combat mage, but as pencil pushers went, he held his own fairly well, but wasn’t quite distinguished. This had a lot to do with why he hadn’t been promoted. He’d even refused one, fearing the increase in paperwork and the death of field work. Harry shook his head and rubbed his eyes.
Am I crazy? The last time I let my desire to be looked after and cared for by a good looking guy make my choices for me, I wound up in prison getting raped for seven years! Am I making the bad choice again…or is this the change I’ve been waiting for my entire life? Harry Black sighs loudly, yanking my train of thought right off its tracks and back to him.
Harry put the finishing touches on the roast, basting some of the juices back over the meat, then sprinkled fresh spices onto the surface, before placing the dish back into the oven. He’d rather missed his meals with Draco these last few weeks. He didn’t envy Draco his job, even though he loathed his own. Last week he’d dodged yet another browbeating session with Scrimgeour, who still periodically tried to get Harry to make public appearances. Almost fifteen years, and the relentless bastard hadn’t given up on his dream of transforming Harry into the spokesperson for every decision the Ministry made. In truth, Harry couldn’t have cared less, and went to great lengths to avoid being dragged back into the spotlight again.
Harry let loose a second later, savoring the slick friction between their bodies while he further soaked their joined hips with seed.
"Minerva…you…you don't get it. Draco…after Hogwarts…at Grimmauld Place. He wasn't my enemy. He…he was…my lover."
Back to the world of bars and people he genuinely felt contempt for but needed just the same. He couldn't call what he felt for Potter contempt anymore. He hid it with a show of repulsion and disdain, but there was only one quality Malfoy genuinely admired: strength. Potter possessed an inner strength so great that it shone like a beacon. Most couldn't have fathomed it through the fog of drugs and seeming lack of care for his life, but Potter was strong enough to have endured the intolerable for years.
“More.” Her eyes narrowed, but Draco could tell that wheels were turning in her mind as they spoke. “I need more than that. What books, and what are they for? I won’t be party to anything that violates school rules, especially for restricted spell books.”
It might have sounded harsh, but what I told you was true, and I hope to God you listened. You want a fresh start? Want to leave the past behind? Your best chance at that is to quit the habits that got you into trouble in the first place. Take my word for it. Nothing will be improved by abusing your body. Remember those questions I asked the first time we met? They weren’t accidents. Cocaine and meth-amphetamine may have sounded like a fine idea when you first used them, but you abused heavy drugs almost weekly if not daily for just about two years before you went to jail. Throw in seven years of apparently starving yourself by eating like a bird, with food that wasn’t much good to start with, and your body is in no shape to handle stress.
Blaise Zabini and Theodore Nott woke up to find themselves bound by the ankles, suspended dozens of feet above the ground, in nothing but their underwear…and Harry Potter was floating in front of them with a smile that was absolutely predatory. Their initial attempts to scream revealed that the area around them had been muffled, keeping all sounds made by the three of them trapped and unheard by the castle’s slumbering residents.
--------------------------------------------------
“I didn’t even know that you could paint. These are wonderful. I see a little artistic license at work though…I’m pretty sure I remember that moment, and I know I was wearing a shirt. Hah! It’s brilliant! We should hang this in the study. If you want to, of course.”
“No worries, love. This is a beach tourism town. They have shops for that kind of thing. I just figured we’d shop when we got here. Hope I didn’t assume too much, but shopping seemed to make you very happy, so I thought a little of that wouldn’t hurt while we have the time.”
The Savage Gambit (Part 4)...by Samayel
Harry's tears were from purest joy, mixed only with the bittersweet knowledge that eventually this time and place would cease to be. It did not trouble him greatly...because the hole in his heart that had been dug so long ago was full now, the empty and aching place had been salved and healed. The poison had been drawn and he could not feel doubt or regret anymore. His hadn't been a vain or wasted love, it had only been a tragic one, a victim of the circumstances of life and the impetuousness of youth. It hadn't been unrequited...it had been the genuine and very real love of two very young, very fragile, terribly confused kids that would have made their peace eventually, if the cruel realities of the post war world hadn't intervened. There was nothing to regret, nothing to lament, nothing to revile or turn his back on...it was only something to be cherished and recalled with reverence, even if it's time had passed.
“By all means. Please do. Would you like some tea?”
Snape was crimson, eyes bloodshot with rage, and his wand was in his hand before Harry even saw it coming.
Therese made crepes for breakfast. Maybe my choices are limited, but at least I’m fed like a king. I think she actually smiled when she watched me eat. Or maybe she just had a nervous tic that made her lip twitch. I couldn’t tell…I was face down in crepes and unrepentantly stuffing myself.
“I…I…but…you never…they-”
“Not…one…fucking…bit. Maybe it was a grand adventure for you, but it was sheer fucking hell for me. Has your life since then been so shitty that you look back at all that with envy? It hasn’t been all tea and crumpets for me either, but those times gave me a nice benchmark for ‘fucking horrible’, and everything since then has felt like a fucking cakewalk. How bad can life be for ‘The Boy Who Just Wouldn’t Snuff It’, that you can ask me with a straight face if I miss those days?”
’He’s insane. It must be senility. He really expects me to work along side that thuggish dolt! I’ll probably have to stand in a corner and just wince all day while he mangles spell after spell. It won’t work. I’ll do it…but it just won’t work!’
Then the lithe blond slumped into the pool and leaned back against the steps, just laying there, eyes closed tightly. Draco finally sat up and put his head in his hands, pushing his hair back and out of his face. Sitting there, unaware that he was watched, Draco had no pretense, and no mask of emotionless indifference. Without an audience, Draco looked genuinely sad, uncertain, and restless.
The real change was what Draco did while giving Harry head. Although he never allowed Harry to do the same to him, Draco routinely massaged Harry’s virgin hole with spit slicked fingers, rubbing gently and firmly in ways that left Harry panting and gasping for immediate release.
Students still often found DADA to be the most 'fun' class of any day, and it grieved Harry every time a harsh grade had to be delivered. There were few things more unpleasant than watching students fail despite the help they could be given, and he dreaded the end of every year, when OWLs and NEWTs were assessed and final grades handed out. The beginning of each year, however, was another matter, and it always started cheerily, with the Sorting Feast and fresh new faces. His mornings might still be marred by his need for drink each night, but with a Hangover Remedy at his nightstand, Harry was ready to face each day and extract from life the few, small pleasures he could find for himself.
“Draco, Lord Malfoy…we’ll dispense with Veritaserum on this occasion, since we already have the statement of Harry Potter, an active Auror, confirming your whereabouts this past night. The Ministry retains the right to call for Veritaserum testimony in the event that information should come to light casting doubt upon the truth of your statements today. Is this understood?”
She sounded very wise and sophisticated, a perfect model of the front put up by every adolescent since the dawn of time, trying to sound as adult as possible and yet falling terribly short of the mark in reality. Although it was horrifyingly annoying to children of that age, most adults found this behavior ‘cute’ in a tongue-in-cheek kind of way. Draco, on the other hand, was recovering from the sudden onset of heart palpitations at the very notion of discussing such a thing with his daughter.
“THAT’S IT! I’m startin’ another pot an’ I’m doin’ it myself! You guinea fuckin’ wops! You call yourselves Italian!? How could even you two fuck up my mom’s sauce! Would you shit on a Caravaggio? Beat off on the fuckin’ Mona Lisa? Never mind! You probably fuckin’ would! Gimme that spoon!”
Harry sat upright in bed after Nev had gone, shaking his head in shock. Ron Weasley and young Draco teaching his courses in DADA…together?
“Pansy Parkinson, you heinous bitch! It’s been a little while, hasn’t it?” The tone is friendly, but we were never more than shallow, alcoholic, barfly buddies at best.
The Savage Gambit (Part 6) ...by Samayel
He stops at an ornate wooden door in one of the halls. No wonder he’s so fit, if he spent any time at all running through this place. The sloppy grin is still in place.
“With regard to yesterday, I have this to say. Mr. Malfoy…I overreacted, and I clearly upset you. I apologize. That was not my intent.”
Near the end of second year…I started noticing…changes…in myself. The same things everybody notices. You can’t live in dorms and not know that everyone else is going through the same thing, some early, some late. That didn’t really matter so much, but it caused…complications. There was someone I started to ‘admire’, but I hadn’t thought anything of it more than that. I just started to smile more when they were around, or stare at them overlong when they weren’t looking at me.
My journal keeps all my dearest secrets, the ones I hold to myself, the ones I share when needed, and all my thoughts, foul and fair. Of course it’s impenetrable. Without the key spelled for it the penalty for intruding on it would be painful in the extreme, more than enough to stop the curious in their tracks. That’s why I can entrust to it my innermost mysteries. And one of those mysteries is on my mind even now.
It comes to this. I’ve been drinking…too much…for a long time. To help me sleep at first, and then because I couldn’t stop after doing it so long. My liver needs a bit of fine tuning…compliments of John. It’s…about the war. Back at Grimmauld Place. You and Ron…you mean the world to me. I didn’t want anyone to know…what I did…then.”
He comes like a freight train, pounding me back into the wall while I bit down hard on the sensitive flesh behind the nape of his neck, mostly to keep myself from screaming so loud that Therese and Maria would know just how rowdy we’re getting in here. There will be time for more…and more…and more. Later.
Harry’s curiosity was peaked to say the least. In fact, certain other parts of him peaked at just the thought of being inside of Draco, making love to him the way that he’d made love to Harry so often and well, but he’d never admit to Draco how badly he wanted that, mainly because he hated the idea of Draco feeling guilty about something he could scarcely be expected to control.
Ruthless fingers slithered along Harry’s thighs, restlessly working their way toward their usual target. Harry savored every stroke and caress, knowing perfectly well where they were leading, and hoping hungrily for just a little more this time.
Pansy hears the chill hiss in my voice, the venom only Slytherin’s can muster in terse speech. Her calm has always been admirable, but then again so was mine once upon a time. The threat may have been heard, but her pride still looms too large to tolerate even a surrender when faced with imminent defeat.
“As you wish, my love. If you didn’t look picture perfect already, I’d drag you into the shower with me just for good measure, but it can wait…a little.”
‘If he just knew how much I love him…how badly I need him…maybe…maybe he’ll never leave.’
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ron lifted an eye, searching the young man’s face for even a hint of levity. The boy’s face was blank, and at a guess he looked perfectly serious, but Ron labored hard to keep from doing a patent double-take.
Then Draco broke the spell between them with a single kiss at the center of Harry’s back, and Harry shuddered with pleasure at the hint of affection and intimacy that was offered him. Then Draco awkwardly moved Harry from his lap, withdrawing his spent and softening cock from Harry slowly, voicing only a tiny ‘ah’ as the sensitive head slid free of Harry’s grasp.
It came to this. The last days before we depart to break, home for a short while before we return and finish our studies. I did not err. The thought of my absence did the work in Harry’s gentle heart that I did not need to do. We have grown so close, so swiftly, that he cannot easily bear the idea of our parting. His gesture is meant to bind us, so that even far away he will be at the forefront of my mind. He should know that he already is, but Gryffindor is the house of caution cast aside, of action instead of thought. He offers what he has to give…the whole of himself.
Draco stood at the edge of the bath, looking around the place with eyes that looked full of unspoken thoughts.
Draco pointed to the chain linked bracelets on Harry's wrists. They looked deceptively fine in make and impossibly slender and delicate in design...but were in fact as hard as the finest steel and could have held against an attempt by a troll to snap them.
It made so little sense. Such a waste of time on an animal impulse. Unfair, that he should be ruled by impulses and needs that wasted time and distracted thought.
“Well…he kind of chewed my ass too. About taking care of you. Not like a pet…like a partner. He gave me hell about letting you ignore his recommendations and not thinking about what that might mean. He’s never given me that much grief about anything before. That’s when I realized that he must be worried about you…at least a little.”
“Yes, sir?”
Harry waited, as did Draco, but no one entered or spoke. Harry finally unfolded his map, while Draco warily went back to bathing.
“I…uh…I don’t think you were a fool. And…um…maybe…it wasn’t…you know…in vain. If…you wanted to maybe…take me for a walk or something…I…I wouldn’t mind that…I mean…if you still wanted to?”
-------------------------------------------------------------
“It wasn’t even about me being a part of this…was it? This wasn’t because you wanted to hire me. This was about Harry. Wasn’t it?”
“Crushed by what?”
Harry sat, aghast and slack jawed, having just taken in more than he could mentally process. He wasn’t sure what he ought to respond to first.
“Resources are not inexhaustible. Fresh water and arable cropland are dwindling in comparison to the need for same. Energy to power our lives and lifestyles does not come from nowhere at all. The world is both growing larger, and yet, inexorably, smaller at the same time. We are all affected by these changes, even those of us insulated by wealth. The key difference is that those who possess wealth, and whose needs are comfortably met, do not see a crisis at hand…yet.
The flat was dark and quiet except for the flicker of the telly, the volume of which had been turned entirely off. Potter was breathing softly on the couch, bare except for a ratty pair of boxers. Draco had steeled himself for these last few nights on the way home. It would take every effort to conceal his thoughts and feelings. He didn't dare come any closer while these thoughts were still in his head. The realization that any selflessness on his part...could only hope to be rewarded by abandonment. Was that what redemption was about? Just a final blow to the ego to smash it all to kindling? Some last acknowledgment that, yes, you'd done something worth the doing of, and your payment was to live with knowing you'd get less than nothing in return?
“As long as that’s what you really want. I’ve just gotten used to Harry the Professor...now I’ll have to get used to Harry the Writer. I did want to ask a few questions about Draco though…call it ‘teacherly’ concern, but he’s been a little off his par just lately, and I wondered if you’d sensed anything out of sorts.”
Until now.
Draco snorted, attempting to feign complete disdain. His eyes, however, betrayed him completely, as they kept flicking back to the tray that had been placed on his bed. Dobby popped away with a hasty bow and was gone. The food sat between them, and Harry tucked into the eggs and sausages with gusto, loudly smacking his lips and deliberately making noises of enjoyment.
Draco uses an old holiday to break down Harry's stubborn resistance once and for all! My response to the May 'No Pants Day' challenge!
Six minutes later, the streetlights came back on, and alarm clocks blinked in every apartment for a block in any direction. The man in black was already long gone. When the girl in the bed came to, she panicked, frightened by what she saw on the floor, but she had enough sense to grab Johnny’s fat wallet and leave fast, taking her chances anywhere but where she’d already been. She knew better to stay in a place where a stranger in a black hood and gloves had shoved a funny smelling cloth into her face until she passed out. Johnny Wu was dead, and there was no telling what would happen to her when Johnny’s people came looking for him. One bus ticket later, she was long gone and headed to places she’d never heard of, but anywhere was safer than what she’d left behind.
What was I supposed to do? My life is over. I feel numb, and Snape jerks my arm harder, pulling me along after him. My feet move, but my heart is dead. The halls are just a blur to me.
We have one pill capsule, quick dissolving powder with no taste, that can be dropped into a drink easily. It’ll put a man of average size to sleep in a matter of maybe ten minutes, especially when mixed with alcohol. The most intense effects really last about a half hour, but the sleep that comes afterwards is heavy and might last quite awhile if the subject is tired anyway.
Of course, on the bright side, they were the bloody crown jewels of his life, each and every one of them. There wasn’t a nap, or a cookie request, or a spill or bump that Ron didn’t adore utterly, and even when it meant spelling up messes and being the arbiter of a million tiny disputes, it was the most wonderful time of his life.
“Just fine, really. A little busy lately, but aren’t we all?”
“Look me in the eyes and tell me you don’t think he’s an attractive man.”
Canvas, oil paints and hours of labor you can measure in quantities like dollars or days. The look on a lover’s face when they see what you created, wholly inspired by love and admiration, is a completely different story. I admit that I put a lot of effort into making this particular work my best, and it was well worth it.
It wasn’t that he hadn’t heard of such a thing, or even vaguely glossed over it while imagining sex, but it still seemed like a shockingly intimate thing to do so quickly! And there of all places!
“Attaboy, Moony. Now let’s go photograph some adulterers in action, cause it’s time to pay the rent, fucker.”
Harry pushed with painstaking slowness, keeping Draco’s legs up and his knees pinned to his chest, while Draco languished on the edge of entry, wondering how long it would take before something that would allow him to come would finally happen.
Draco’s lips had curled into a drunken grin and his head lolled back, and Harry quickly felt pressure, warmth and tightness around his cock. Draco slid back with surprising ease, exhaling softly as his body stretched to accommodate Harry’s stone hard erection. Freed of anxiety, drunk on the power inherent in Harry’s voice, Draco allowed the full length of Harry into him without a noise of complaint, and his own cock stood rampant and hard, just above the stomach of his lover.
Dear God. It all sounded intriguing a second ago. Dangerous and fun and cool. She isn’t kidding. They’ll make Blaise a living target behind bars, even after I’ve finished with him. Assuming he lives through his first few weeks and makes a place for himself, he’ll be at the bottom of the bottom. Most of the people behind prison bars are there for a reason, but by silent agreement, they all hate one thing more than anything else. Many of them were childhood victims of abuse, and if they find out what kind of porn Blaise was convicted for, he’ll either be a dead man or every man’s bitch before he’s been there a month! I want revenge, but do I really want this?
Then Malfoy’s chin brushed against stubble, and bloodshot gray eyes snapped open like shutters.
Words like bugger, shag, screw and fuck made the act seem inherently wrong and dirty. Even less pleasant terms were applied to the people who preferred to be the one buggered, shagged, screwed or fucked. Punk…bitch…slut…whore…sissy…nancy…the list dragged on endlessly. But when Harry thought of what it would be like to feel Draco inside of him, to be utterly linked to his boyfriend in a fashion that could not be matched any other way, his stomach fluttered nervously, his breath caught in his throat, and he couldn’t imagine anything wrong or evil about being made love to by someone he adored. However the world’s view was slanted, his gut instincts told him they were all wrong.
They peeled away each other’s clothes with care, lavishing as much attention as possible on each others lips, while coats and trousers slid to the floor in an ungainly pile. So much time apart made simple things such as hands caressing each other a brilliant thing, and they fought the urge to frantically rut to completion, as they once had done, with everything they had.
They chuckled and joked, taking the edge off the stress while Ron eased the Lincoln down quiet streets toward the garage. Harry glanced down the street, staring at the road that led to a home he wouldn’t be seeing just yet. There were things that needed doing, and those had to be seen to first. Drake was probably sound asleep, alone, worried, sore and missing him.
“I don’t care about that! Please! You have to hurry! I’ll leave if you want, but you have to help him…now!”
“Draco, forgive me.” Harry interjected. “I couldn't have known or guessed what these months would be like. I can't...I don't even know how to describe what its been like...to live in doubt and shame for so long. I haven't...been fair to you...or to anyone...in a long time. When I say you gave me a gift...I didn't lie. For the first time in a long time...I am awake. I was broken...but it wasn't you that broke me. If anything...it's you who made me well again. Thank you.”
“Very well. I accept that. It seems a pity that you thought we’d condone such a treatment of students here. Corporal punishment was abolished at Hogwarts many, many years ago. Hasn’t been used since the days of Headmaster Dippet. Please continue. What happened between you and professor Potter?”
Draco walked through Hogwarts’ halls with a weirdly serene confidence. His final destination was the Room Of Requirement on the seventh floor, and Harry would likely be waiting for him, even though he meant to be just a little early.
Perhaps…perhaps he would leave Hogwarts. Maybe it was time to go home and start over again? Not just yet. He’d finish his treatments for his liver, and talk to John Prewett a little more openly than before. Something had shifted inside of him, and Harry felt that faint possibility of a better life in front of him for the first time in a long time. Maybe not a sunlit road, but hardly a darkened tunnel either.
“Rules. There are always rules. What are they?”
Anyone who wasn't very good at seeing what was hidden, perhaps, but Draco was surprisingly observant even by the standards of wizards. It wasn't one of the talents he bragged about loudly. It was one of the gifts he kept to himself, not letting on that he was conscious of even small or subtle signals that people gave away every day. These were the tiny facts he clutched to himself as they were revealed, letting these tidbits of gleaned wisdom guide him in his dealings with others.
"It took courage to say that. Don't leave. You have nothing to be ashamed of…in any respect. Not falling prey to the mirror, and not for feeling something for Harry. You've shown great candor and uncommon honesty…and I wouldn't disrespect that by speaking to you like a child or barking commands about what you ought to think or feel. This needed speaking of."
What separated Hermione from most people was her intelligence. With an IQ approaching 200, she was formidable at every field she applied herself to, but that wasn’t the key to her value here. Loosely put, she was an adept ’pattern reader’. A person who could assimilate enormous amounts of information, and still make accurate guesses at the meanings hidden in the flow of words and seemingly unrelated events. Some folks just called people like her ’media gurus’ or ’computer whizkids’ because they had no idea what it meant to possess an intelligence that set you apart from most of humanity. The hard part was that it didn’t make you any less a creature of emotion or desire. It just made you smart. It also occasionally made you bored, since the only way to challenge yourself was to push the boundaries of your abilities right to their edge, and Hermione’s boundaries were hard to reach.
Eight words may not seem like much, but attached to a box of exquisite caramels and a dozen red roses, it’s practically Tolstoy’s War And Peace. He knew perfectly well how my next few days would go, and he sent these to take a little of the sting out of behaving so well.
“You heard the lady of the house. Sorry, kid. Take off.”
“Ma…Ma….Ma?! Come on! Everything is fine. Don’ worry about it! The club’s a nice joint…no trouble…all legit. Nothin’s gonna happen to me. I promise. Maaaa!”
“Ahhhh. Those two…I swear. Just like old times.”
They stood gasping and panting, clutching each other for almost a minute before Harry finally smothered Draco with a kiss before he whispered, "You won. That was...beautiful. I told you you wouldn't be sorry."
The door creaked, and Minerva MacGonagall stepped into the room quietly, her demeanor grim in spite of the early morning hour.
We’d have been driving all day to get here in a car. Just under two hours in flight, and this Saugatuck place is near. Ron brings us down after radioing his landing coordinates in, and the approach of the water and land at high speed is enough to make me curl back into Harry’s arms and try to keep my gorge from rising. Bouncing across water while the plane lurches because Ron brought the nose up a hair at the last second is NOT my favorite activity. Still, once we’re slowed down and zipping toward a dock, this isn’t really so bad. Even so…I’m glad it’s over and we’re here.
As surprising as this may sound, I finally feel content. Between good food and the sound of Harry’s voice, I’m no longer so frantically lonesome that I require constant sex. Mostly it’s that I’m absolutely full, and so is he, and there’s nothing we could do that would excite us enough to do more than kiss. I don’t mind a bit. To be perfectly candid, I’m actually bracingly sore from earlier this evening, and a nice break from screwing like bunnies suits me just fine. We are headed for a vacation after all. I can continue my quest to exhaust Harry’s libido when we get where we’re going.
Harry brushed down his somewhat unruly hair, frowning at the faint streaks of gray at his temples. He wasn't particularly vain, and never had been, but it was still a surprise some days to look in the mirror and find a grown man approaching his middle years staring back at him, blinking owlishly from behind a pair of round glasses. He was a handsome enough fellow, after a fashion, and still nearly fit enough to be half his age, but the man in the mirror was still vaguely unfamiliar at times.
The senior Auror motioned politely toward the door, and Draco looked Harry’s way and started walking for the door. “You’ll come too, won’t you?”
“You really did do well.”
Funny. I slept like a rock in prison. Here, in the proverbial lap of luxury, I wake because my dreams are too much. It’s an alien environment, soft and clean and just too different. The pillows are like clouds, and the sheets are a cocoon of the finest silks and linens. It’s summer in Chicago and I should be roasting, but the suite has central air and the temp is perfect. Wrong. It all feels wrong.
The Savage Gambit (Part 1)…by Samayel
And knowing I deserve it…that makes it all the better.
Draco took a seat at Harry’s small table, fidgeting nervously with the book he’d brought back. Harry poured tea for the both of them, painfully aware of the edgy ‘presence’ of another in his private quarters. These rooms had been his home for many years, and inside these walls he was most comfortable…until now. Draco had done well, showing clearly that he respected what he’d been told, but there was no way to eject him immediately without betraying the very concept he’d tried to impart. For better or worse, Harry would simply have to make his way through a conversation with Draco’s son, and truthfully, it was something that he might well gain from getting used to. Draco had come for an education, and it was starting in earnest now. Harry just needed to make himself more comfortable with the small realities of that task.
Harry gave a feral smile, jade green eyes almost alight with power. Thoughts of Draco flickered through his head. Ugly, lustful thoughts that would never have occurred to him in a fully rational state. Thoughts of Draco pliant and made willing by Parseltongue, that beautiful arse taken roughly and plundered by Harry’s aching cock. The power to make Draco more a whore to him than EVER he had been for Draco…was more than in his grasp…it dripped from his very tongue! Harry grabbed Draco by the hair and leaned close to his blankly worshipful face.
Pansy looks ill at ease. My smirk of confidence doesn’t seem to faze her visibly false pose of indifference.
If I play it carefully enough, I might just leave here with only one scar. The one where a modified piece of wire was heated to white-hot and pressed into my lower back, just above my ass. The wire was shaped like the letter ‘F’. Flint’s brand, marking me as his, just to remind me in case I forgot. It only happened because I’d gotten just saucy enough to act demanding about something, and I’d picked the wrong day. He decided to make a big show of reminding me whose grace I lived by, and I didn’t forget again.
Young Draco turned white as a sheet, staring in numb shock at the book in Harry's hands. Tentatively, he reached out a hand and touched the open page plaintively, his face twisting into a mask of stifled loss and fear. He could only barely manage a whisper while looking up to Harry with eyes that were already tearing up beyond control.
TBC!!!
Her face played through a whirlwind of emotions. Draco maintained the same quiet, straightforward demeanor that had gotten him this far with her. Eventually, Hermione recovered from complete speechlessness.
Sink into the water beside him. The door is closed and the light is hazy when the bath is full and steaming while the soft hum of the spa lulls away anything but the sounds of water lapping at the edges. He knows to be silent while I work soap into lather and pulls him forward, deeper into the bath.
Normally I’d make a smart remark to break the tension, but I can’t even imagine what he’d say if I said, ‘What? No candles or wine first?’ I’ve been known to make the occasional bad call in my life…but even I wouldn’t do anything as stupid as baiting this guy. It would be like rubbing myself in bacon grease and slapping a starving, rabid bear with my belt!
“Then let me show you something…shhh…just trust me.”
The shirt is meant to be worn short and showing midriff, tied off well above the bellybutton, but it’s kind of reminiscent of the way I wore my shirt in the pen. Especially since I’m not bothering with anything more than a bra. No need for realism here, I want Harry’s attention on my ass and nowhere else. I don’t like the association with the past, but since I’m in my present and future, surrounded by luxury, wearing clothes that look sensational on me, giddy on raw lust and sucking up a mimosa to get a little tipsy while I primp in front of the mirror, I can handle the memories. The past is the past…and Harry will be back in less than an hour.
Johnny stepped in and closed the door behind him, taking the nice watch he always wore and his good rings off and slipping them into his coat pocket. She was sleeping on her stomach, black hair braided long and down her back, a coil of midnight against pale and silky skin that he knew well. The tattoo of his gang was fresh on her right shoulder, and stood out starkly in the moonlight from the window.
“No, Mr. Malfoy. I wouldn’t call it wrong…if you grade on a wide curve and include the rest of humanity. I suppose that’s just what anyone else would want…but like usual…what you want isn’t necessarily good for you. Don’t expect pills from me forever. They’ll help in the short term, but I expect you to start building habits that will help you function before the pills run out. Don’t think your life can’t have luxury or pleasure in it…but learn to exercise some self discipline and moderation. If you can do that, you can enjoy the foods and activities you like, as long as you balance it with proper nutrition, healthy exercise, and solid coping skills. It should be time by now. Can you feel anything?”
“Doctor Snape, this is Drake. He had a little fainting spell, and he hasn’t had the best medical coverage for quite awhile, so I thought it would be a good idea to get him a proper check up by someone that knows what they’re doing. Drake…meet Doctor Snape.”
That started the drinking. I'd noticed that it was easier to handle being around people if I'd had a bit to drink. Just a pint or two. And then cigarettes to calm my nerves. Between the two I could make it out the door pretty easily. For awhile. There are a lot of blurry parts once I started drinking heavier. I realized I didn't hurt any where near so much when I was drunk...and its not like there was any shortage of people doing other things. I saw deals happen right in the street. One day I added a few joints to my routine. I could make it to a pub now and again when I was high enough, and that started things rolling.
Draco looked uncomfortable, suddenly developing an intense interest in the surface of Harry’s desk.
Harry…the way I treated you…it wasn’t that different from the way he treated me. He was…a little colder…a little rougher, but he kept me believing that there was something more, something better, just beneath the surface. I gave him everything he wanted…and I mean everything. I liked it then, giving in to him, doing whatever he wanted. It felt wicked, wrong in all the good ways, and he always made sure I enjoyed it. Even when it hurt, it was like it was something I craved, and that made it alright.
Those poor dumb bastards have no idea what I just went through to save their lives! Admittedly, it was a moment of inspired brilliance on my part. Do you have any idea how hard it is for a queen who weighs less than a hundred and thirty pounds to drag an two hundred pound unconscious man into a chair?! It’s fucking murder! Plus jumping onto Blaise’s lap and peeling my top off just in time! Time for a whisper into the mic, I think. Ron and the rest gotta be wondering what they just heard, and all I had time to broadcast was a whispered plea for patience.
“Yes…I do. That’s very ‘you‘, Harry. Even if it hurts, you wouldn’t sit still when someone needs help…even if they don’t know it. I’m glad you’re getting the help you need…and I’m glad you’re telling me all of this. You never should have kept it to yourself so long. Our home is your home, Harry. Ron will understand too. You’ll be talking to him about this soon?”
You’ll also have one ring with a paste stone that comes off with a hard twist, and underneath it is a poisoned spike less than an eighth of an inch long. One poke with this and paralysis should set in seconds later. Interesting side note, it’s related to the toxins made famous by voodoo practitioners, extracted from the venom of certain fishes. It’s harmless, but the effects last for hours, shutting off the part of the brain that allows you to command your own limbs. You can see and feel and hear what’s going on around you, but you can’t move. I recommend you only use this if you have to leave in a hurry or are in serious danger.
“I’m not your mother. Answer the fucking questions and don’t be a blushing idiot. If you’re old enough to do it, and you are, then you’re old enough to talk about it out loud with a doctor.”
Big Chicago Part 10...By Samayel
“Nothing that really matters any more, my love. C'mon...let's not leave the table unattended for too long or the Weasleys will be chewing on the plates from sheer hunger after that Quidditch match. I don't want to be thought a bad host. Besides, if we're done in time I can watch our child absolutely pound Ron at Wizard's chess. You know how much I inwardly gloat every time someone with the name Malfoy beats him at his favorite game.”
Remus rolled off the rumpled sheets and lurched to the bathroom. He’d left two pills on the counter beside a glass of water, same as every night. He snatched them up and dropped them in the water, then sucked the whole thing back a second later, trying to gulp them down while his gag reflex rebelled against the knowledge of what he was doing. It hurt every time. He’d got them down, but he’d been painfully conscious of every second that the horrid things had been crawling down his throat. He couldn’t explain it, but he knew it made his skin crawl to even think of it.
Draco wasn’t sure what to say, and held Harry to him loosely, enjoying the sudden realization that he’d never had the leisure of laying naked, side by side in a proper bed, with Harry before. Harry’s skin was wonderfully soft, and warm, and the sensation of his body against Harry’s was indescribably pleasant and comfortable.
“Frankly, arguing with you is the most interesting thing I’ve done all day. I suppose that’s worth a martini.”
Somehow, the Congressman would have to be dealt with, and if he was really tied to Riddle, as Hermione suspected, he might be their best chance at pinpointing their enemy by tracing his communications to the source. It wouldn’t be easy even if it was possible. Riddle knew all the same tricks that they did, and when he communicated directly, which was rare, it was always via mediums that were hard, if not impossible, to trace. In the meantime, Harry would have to be used strategically when possible, but keep an even lower public profile than usual. It wouldn’t do to have him spotted on the street corner by a pair of eyes looking for the enigmatic Harry Black.
The instructors at Durmstrang had been cold and emotionless in their giving of pain, delivering punishment with a detached kind of amusement. The bitter, spiteful words and acts of his grandparents had been a calculated expression of their hatred and resentment. But…in the whole of his life so far, Draco had never seen a person so completely out of control…not even himself!
“Harry. I’m glad you came, too. I’ve…I’m a lot better these days, and there are some things we need to talk about. I know I haven’t the right, but I’d like to ask for some conditions while I talk. Would you at least listen to them, then tell me if you’re willing to accept them?”
Hermione had already begun to pull the door shut when Draco jammed his foot into the way and blurted out one last gamble for her invitation. "I apologize! If it will get you to hear this out...I'll apologize in detail for everything...all of it...the things I said, the things I did in school...the whole lot of it! I'm sorry I hurt you...can't change that...but if you'll listen to me for just an hour I'll apologize a hundred times, just let me in and hear me out!"
"That's the whole point! It's not like I'm disinterested in the notion...but you owe me! I want to go first! Besides...I'll know more about what to do after I've had it done for me once. The way I see it, you get the better end of the deal. I get blown by someone who knows nothing about it...but you'll at least give me a clue as to what works before we switch places. Are we doing this or not?"
Draco suddenly cracked up, chortling into his own hand. There was a thought he'd never have imagined thinking to himself in a million years. It made the situation slip into perspective really. His life was very different from the one he‘d lived a year ago, and Harry had made all the difference in it, all for the better. It was hard to be afraid when he thought of things like that.
“Well, he is the most famous person ever to come out of Hogwarts. Slew a Dark Lord, saved the world and all of that. If you’re going to see someone, you couldn’t do much better than that. I thought…I thought he’d be taller, though. More…you know…heroic. He’s very odd. Nice, but odd.”
Harry held his clenched hand, and leaned close, brushing his lips against Draco’s before veering to the left and kissing him just below the ear. Harry’s voice whispered to him, confident and peaceful, making his heart leap in his chest with happiness.
The spells upon it bordered on Dark, and required the greatest of care to remove, spell by spell, in the proper order, to avoid serious harm. He opened the chest with a quiet intensity, and withdrew from the very bottom of it a single book, bound in fine leather and gold. This he placed upon his desk with reverence, and with a small knife he nicked his finger, letting three drops fall upon the golden lock of the book, whispering breathily to it all the while. The softest of clicks could be heard, and he opened the slim volume near the center, turning a few pages until he found the one he wanted. Then he began to read, candlelight flickering into the night, eyes fixed firmly upon the pages of the book, until exhaustion brought him low.
“That day on the coast. The day of the attack. What if I'd been killed, too? Would you...would you have avenged me? Would you have killed for me, even though we'd been apart, and under such horrible circumstances? Would you have done something like that, even though you're an Auror?”
Three days. I gave him three days of the best head I could give. He looked at me differently, but he never said anything out of the ordinary. He has to know that I did it because I…I approve of him. He looked like he was measuring me. Weighing me. Not my body…my soul. He didn’t tell me when they would come. My release was moved up without a word to anyone. One day I was a number, and then I’m escorted to the offices, given my clothes and personal effects and allowed to dress, handed my paperwork and led to the exit. I never got to say anything to him. He never said anything. He’s still in that cell, and I’m walking out of the building.
He’d dealt with incredulous or downright insulting people all of his life. From his grandparents to his teachers and classmates. Eidetic memory was an aberration…like albinism. In nature, when a creature was visibly different from the rest of its species, it frequently found itself driven away, out of a built in need to protect the rest of the population by getting rid of the one who drew too much attention and risked the notice of predators.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
“Don’t even go there. This discussion is a pants-free zone and staying that way. That aside…is there anything else?”
“NO! PLEASE! I…I can’t tell you. They’ll…they’ll kill us! He’ll kill us if we talk! Please! You can’t do this!”
It was the way Draco touched him, firmly, yet without disrespect, sensually, but with a hint of power. Harry felt like an ocean ship the was being gently steered, never fought for control, and Draco’s real gift lay in his ability to move Harry to offer more of his own volition.
He’d gotten the recipe from the book pile Granger had given him, and even though he wrote it down, he hadn’t the time to make use of it before his tryst with Harry last week. Now he had a full bottle of the stuff, and it ought to prove quite useful.
Only with Draco had he been blind to it, obviously because the very notion made him far more uncomfortable than merely dealing with his Draco’s surviving child! He needed John’s advice, privately, as soon as he read that letter and relayed what Draco had told him to Minerva.
Getting anything significant done in Chicago, from knocking a building down to starting construction on a new one, from zoning a business to acquiring a license to get started with one, took money. Not just a little money, but a lot of money. Just the bribes for mid-level officials and permission from organized crime in the area demanded a small fortune, but Tom Riddle had that. That wasn’t the point.
‘Still unfair though! It’s not my fault I get so horny around him. It’s how I am! I wasn’t like this until we had sex. How was I supposed to know I’d have the horn this bad once I’d had a little taste? That’s all I’m saying!’
“Can you stand up? I’m going to put the cloth back over the mirror, and when I do, we’re leaving. Do you understand?”
Last year, he taken to occasionally wanking alongside Seamus, who was not only cute, but was friendly, outgoing, and had an easy familiarity that made him seem comfortable to be around, and fun to snog. It had cooled off the minute Seamus found a real boyfriend, and Harry was back where he’d started.
Peter Pettigrew cringed as the paperweight Mr. Riddle had flung crashed into his arm. The old man was almost apoplectic with fury, wisps of white hair fluttering on a nearly bald head, eyes bulged with rage and mouth pinched into a tight line when not opening for shouted insults.
I love that smirk of his. It’s easy to forget the terror I was feeling not even an hour ago when green eyes are shining brightly in my direction. Easy to get lost in a kiss that has warmth and hunger and all the good little things that make everything feel right and decent.
