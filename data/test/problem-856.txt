Healer Cummins got up and walked around his desk.  Taking out his wand, he whispered a few words and poked the wand in Harry’s direction.  He did the same with Draco.
She continued to look at him, still annoyed that she got partnered with him.  He was trying to wait for her to begin reading again, but she kept glaring at him.  Finch-Fletchley didn’t know how much more he was supposed to take.
Shaking his head, Harry replied.  “It was careless use of magic.  I shouldn’t have even tried it.  It wasn’t until Dumbledore . . .died, that I realized you didn’t want to kill him.  You were just scared.  If I’d helped you instead of cursing you . . .”
Harry looked across the car to Ron and Hermione.  “Yes,” he answered, embarrassed to have his former sex life discussed publicly.  “You think I got one of them preggars?  Or
When Dean caught Harry staring, he waved his hand in Harry’s face and laughed.  Harry made up some excuse about not sleeping well the night before, which was true, and joked that he was trying to sleep in class with his eyes open.  No one questioned Harry’s sincerity.
“Not a chance.” Harry clambered onto the bed and rubbed his cock over the crack of Draco’s arse, coating it lightly in lube, before sliding it inside.
“I will.  but right now, I have to get these research papers graded. O.W.L.s begin in just a few weeks, and I have to get to my planning.”
“Well I think you and Malfoy should really try harder to get along. We are adults you know and you should out this petty rivalry to rest.” She said while giving him her signature Hermione look which meant there was no room for argument. “Seriously ‘Mione? After all, he’s done to us? You want us to just forget?” Ron said looking at her with slight disbelief. “No, Ronald I don’t think we should forget but move on. If you noticed the war wasn’t all the nice to him either.” She said while gathering her things and getting up. “Now I’m off to bed.” She bent over giving Ron a quick peck on the lips and walked off to her room. “She’s barking if she thinks we should make friends with that git.” Ron leaned in and told Harry. Harry gave him a small grunt which seemed to satisfy Ron. “Game of chess?” he asked Harry. “Okay” so Ron went about getting the chess board all set up. Harry couldn’t help his thoughts from lingering on what Hermione had said, she was right, like she often was, the war had been hard on all of them. Should he make nice with Malfoy? Before he could consider it more Ron pulled his attention to the game and they settled into a game of wizards chest.
Not even a day in and he already had detention and it had been all Potters fault.  If he hadn’t been so incompetent at potions, he wouldn’t be in this mess right now. As he headed down to the dungeons for their shared detention, he was thinking about how exactly everything had gone to shit. He had been insulting potter and then all of a sudden Potter had drawn his wand on him and he had retaliated by drawing his wand to, as to be expected.  Potter seemed to be even more hot headed than he was before Draco scoffed. Potter was always walking around thinking he could do whatever he wanted and not get in trouble for it. He had always been that way and the teachers had always fallen for it. Well everyone except his godfather.
Harry marveled at the differences between the way they came.  And he had a desire to see how other men came, that he never had before.  Quickly putting that thought out of his mind, Harry directed his attention back to Draco.
Tentatively, Harry stood up and looked around to see if anyone was paying attention.  It seemed there was always someone interested in what he was doing.  A couple kids glanced at him, but he steeled himself and began to walk over to the Slytherin table.
Trying to be reasonable, Draco said, “You don’t have to keep things like that from me for fear of hurting my feelings. It just makes me more wary of him.”
Draco closed his eyes.  He felt as though those four words just shattered his future.  He knew Harry well enough to know that he would do the right thing.  At any cost.  Even his own happiness.  And Draco’s.
“Yes, it seemed to be a particularly exhausting week.  I imagine next week will be worse, what with the Halloween Ball coming up.”
Simon grinned. “Yeah. I’m afraid I knocked that bloke right off his broom. Guess I didn’t know my own strength.”
As he listened to Draco’s deep, even breaths, Harry thought about the events of the past couple of days.  He supposed he could have gone about things differently, so as not to worry Draco.  The poor thing spent the weekend thinking Harry was leaving him.  Harry rolled his eyes at himself.  He would have to work on his methods of surprising his lover.  Eventually, Harry also fell into deep sleep to dream about the new life that lay ahead.
As he leaned against the desk, Lucius bowed his head and rubbed his forehead, the way Draco had been known to do from time to time.
“Not at all,” she answered quickly.  “In fact,” her heart started to beat faster as she contemplated what she was about to say.  “I was hoping the second time would be even better.”
Releasing Harry, Draco once again retreated to the sofa.  But now his insecurities were getting the better of him.  Though Harry said he wasn’t upset, Draco couldn’t shake the feeling that he’d done something wrong.  Harry seemed distant when he first arrived. But now he didn’t, so Draco forced himself to put it aside.
“It’s so difficult to keep the romance alive once the little ones come along,” she said.  “How do you do it?”
“Uh . . .” Draco was left speechless. He was certain Harry had been unconscious when he kissed him.  How could he possibly have known?
Harry was frozen in place.  Did Draco just say he thought Ron and Hermione were there?  In the room?
Justin Finch-Fletchley couldn’t believe his luck.  He managed to find a girl who not only was willing to dance with him, but she let him put his arms around her and hold her closely during the slow songs.  Of course, she had no idea who he was.  He hoped he could charm her enough so by the end of the evening, when they removed their masks, she wouldn’t run away.
“Yeah.”  He paused, expecting her to excitedly show him her new piece of jewelry.  “Well, let’s see then,” he finally said and held out his hand to take hers.
Kissing his way down Harry’s body, Draco yanked the jeans down.  Harry removed his socks and shoes while Draco moved on to the pants.  He was practically drooling by the time the pants were gone and Harry lay before him, nude and very much aroused.
Harry and Draco divvied the chores for the essay between them.  They would each research five ingredients, and work on the procedures together.  To the rest of the class, they appeared to be working hard on the project, but Harry kept telling Draco things he was planning to do to him in that very room later on.
A pink knitted cap covered the baby’s head.  He couldn’t have stopped the grin that spread across his face if his life had depended on it.  He hadn’t realized how much he was hoping for another daughter until that moment.  All the time, he had been justifying his wishes as something for Lily.
“He was simply adjusting the ice pack,” Harry explained. “He thought it would be funny to play a trick on you.”
Draco grinned widely.  “We won!” he said to Harry as if Harry hadn’t figured it out.  On impulse, Draco grabbed either side of Harry’s face and kissed him squarely on the lips.  “You’re brilliant,” he proclaimed.
A small gasp escaped Narcissa’s open mouth.  While Narcissa had not exactly embraced her son’s passion for men, she believed that she understood and accepted it.  Men, yes, but not that particular man.  She had tolerated the affair thinking it would be short lived, burning out quickly once their youthful lust had been satisfied.  She had told him as much when he first confessed to the relationship.
“Because you would deny it.  And I don’t want Draco to be made a fool of.  He may come across as stoic and cold sometimes, but he’s actually got a tender heart.”
Draco grinned. “It’ll be our extended honeymoon. We can fuck in a different city every week.  How about if I get a few travel books and we can plan it all out?”
The two quietly crept through the castle, keeping a sharp eye out for Filch, who loved to catch students where they weren’t supposed to be.  Fortunately, Mrs. Norris often gave him away.  And Harry hadn’t been caught by Filch in a long time.
“I don’t mean to keep things from you.  I don’t always remember what’s common knowledge about me and what’s not.”
“And because I didn’t grant you an interview in the middle of my supper, that gave you the right to fabricate--”
Leaning forward, Draco braced his hands on Harry’s chest. He rolled his hips back and forth, grinding himself as far down Harry’s cock as he could get. They both groaned.
What Harry wanted to answer was, lack of a penis.  He was certain Draco’s eyes would have bugged out at that response.
“Blaise knows nothing was going on.  He knows I would never cheat on Harry.  He was just being a prat.”  Going over the conversation in his head, Draco frowned.  “That wasn’t the first time you told Blaise how you feel, is it?”
“It’s very colorful,” Harry noted.  He glanced at a black and white photograph hanging over the toilet.  “Who is that?”
“On that note, I’ll be going as well,” Draco said.  “Thanks Potter.” He glanced happily at his wand and headed out of Gryffindor house.
Harry was nearly in tears when he heard the roar of the fireplace. He turned to find, not Ron and Hermione, but Draco coming out.
“You don’t need to lock me away.  The only thing that would drive me away is if you tell me you don’t love me anymore.  If that ever happens, I’ll let you go.  Because no matter what, I want you to be happy.  But it won’t be because I don’t love you.”
Harry stumbled inside and went directly to the door leading to his bed chamber.  He struggled with the handle, prompting Draco to help him open the door.   Harry tried to sit down in a chair, but was dragged to his bed and gently pushed down into a prone position. Draco lifted his feet up, then sat on the edge of the bed to take off Harry’s shoes.
“It’s not bullshit,” Blaise protested.  He looked down at the ground. “I’m not out yet,” he said quietly.  “Not to my family.”
Harry raised his eyebrows.  He’d never had a tremendous amount of faith in her psychic abilities.  How could she have known what he was thinking about?
Harry scoffed at that.  He’d seen Draco at his worst.  When they were younger, he’d often wondered if Malfoy had a heart at all.
“Because he reached out to me Harry.  Because I couldn’t turn my back on a former student in need.  Any student, especially one so desperate to turn over a new leaf.”
“Good.  Now we can concentrate on tonight.”  Draco covered Harry’s mouth with his own, kissing him hard, in contrast to the gentle kisses he’d been planting before.
Harry took a deep breath. “On the count of three, all right? But don’t hold your breath,” Harry warned. “Try to breathe through the pain and focus on something.”
“Fine,” Draco said, losing patience.  “You’re in love.  I don’t know what you expect me to do about it.”
Hermione waited for more.  When Harry was not forthcoming, she spoke.  “And?  Are you worried it’s true?”
“The one I asked you in the Room of Requirement. Why didn’t you tell your aunt it was me?  At the Manor. You could have ensured your family an honored place among the Death Eaters and gotten rid of me for good.  Why didn’t you tell her?”
“You owl seemed rather urgent,” she replied.  “I didn’t want to miss the birth of my third grandchild.”
Just then an owl appeared at the window, clicking its beak on the glass.  Slughorn went to the window and let it in to retrieve an envelope tied to its foot.
Ron put his hands up.  “Now, that’s a worst-case scenario.  He could try to get those things back, but he probably wouldn’t.”
“Well, since you’ve filled out all the paperwork, the next step is ours.  We’ll take your preferences into account but we may not find a perfect match. Then Harry can come in to give his specimen.”
By the time they were ready to leave, Harry had the feeling that the four of them could actually get along quite nicely. None of Harry’s other lovers seemed to fit in with their group. He supposed that was part of the reason his relationships didn’t last. His friendship with Ron and Hermione would never be compromised for anyone else. That was something he was unwilling to sacrifice. Even for love.
A couple of days passed before Harry had more interaction with Draco, aside from faculty meals.  He bumped into him in the library, literally.  Draco had been squatting down in search of a book low on the shelves when Harry stumbled right over him.  Harry managed to gracelessly catch himself from falling on top of the blond.  However, it didn’t save him from embarrassment.
Montague opened and closed his mouth several times before any words came out.  “Well, how do I . . . I mean, how would my friend go about . . . letting someone else know how he feels about them?”
“We’re closed,” he grumbled.  “If you want to place an advertisement, you’ll have to wait ‘til tomorrow.”
“Fuck,” he whispered again, putting his head back down on his arms.  Talking into his desk, Harry addressed the visitor.  “Mr. Malfoy, I really don’t know what else to say to you.  You can read my report as soon as I file it.”
Harry woke up to the sun starting to peak out through his curtains. He had had a fitful sleep last night with nightmares coming and going in a blur all night. He rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and found his glasses on his nightstand, he grabbed his wand after shoving his glasses on his face and cast a quick
When they got back from dinner Ron and Hermione went to the couch in front of the fire place and curled up together. Harry feeling awkward decided that he would turn in early for the night because he was feeling exhausted and really didn’t have the energy to watch them and feel like a third wheel the rest of the night. After a quick good night to his friends he returned to his room and changed into a comfortable pair of sweats and sat down in the chair in his room with his potions book determined to not fuck up the next potion in class with Malfoy. After a while of trying to memorize the exact steps of the potion they would be making next class Harry could feel his eyes begging to stop reading. He put his book down and rubbed his sore and dry eyes. He decided that he would shower this evening instead of the morning so that he could have a little extra time to sleep in.
The rest of the week he managed to avoid Potter. He scheduled it so that he would wake up before him and finished breakfast right after he entered the great hall. He spent his lunches in the library, ducking down to the kitchens to grab a sandwich from the house elves before the start of his afternoon classes. For Dinner he would eat as fast as possible and then lock himself in his room for the rest of the night. Now that it was the weekend though he wasn’t sure how he was going to manage to avoid Potter all the time since they shared a common room and literally lived next to each other. Deciding his best bet was to go to the library as Potter almost never went there, unless dragged by Granger, and spend his weekend there hoping that most other 8
When they got there, they found only ten desks arranged in a semi circle. They took the seats and the end of the semi circle furthest from the door. They waited in nervous silence until the rest of the eighth years started to trickle in. Potter and his gang were the last to arrive with Granger practically dragging them through the door. He used to hate Granger with every fiber of his being. She had always been better than him and all of their shared classes and his father had always made sure that Draco knew it. “You are a Pureblood, she is just mudblood filth not, not even worthy of her magic and how is she still top of your classes and you are not.” He would say to him when he got home. He would tower over him sitting at his desk in his study, while Draco sat in the chair across from him, watching him expecting and answer he knew Draco didn’t have. When Draco failed to come up with an acceptable answer Lucius would send him out and instruct him that he was not to come down dinner until he had completed the books, on why blood purity was important, and wrote him 12” paper on why their blood must remain pure. He used to hate it so much that he would take his anger out on Granger. Once the Dark Lord had moved in, he had begun to question he father’s teachings.  By the time he was in Azkaban he had come to the realization that all his father had taught him was utter shite. Now of course he wished he had realized sooner. He definitely owed Granger an apology for being a bigot toward her for so many years, but he didn’t know how to begin or if she would even stay in his presence long enough to let him try to apologize.
Short chapter for today! they will start getting longer now that the scene has been more or less set! Thanks for reading!
years would go to Hogsmead and leave the common room fairly empty. Thankfully this plan worked for the weekend and he didn’t catch of glimpse of that wild black hair unless in the great hall.
He was pulled out of his thoughts when Professor Melbourne entered the room. She came to the front of the semi circle and called every one’s attention to her. “Since you all have survived a war with most if not all of you either on the run or in situations which required more than your fair share of defensive magic, the Headmistress and I thought it was more appropriate for the ten of you to be in a separate class.”  She said while looking around at them. “In this class we will be focusing on how we can rebuild the wizarding world after such a divisive war. You will be paired up and the two of you will need to work on and present a way we can help the wizarding world come back together.  To help us heal and make it better for future generations. The pairs will be of my choosing.” At that there was a collective groan from around the semi circle. She ignored this and powered through. “Ron Weasley and Susan Bones, Theodore Nott and Harry Potter, Parvati Patil and Neville Longbottom, Daphne Greengrass and Hannah Abbott, and Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger.” As soon as she said Hermione and his name, Weasley was starring daggers at him, he lifted his chin determined to not show how nervous he was.
“I was hoping to do something a little more unorthodox,” Harry answered vaguely.  “I want it to be very special.”
Harry peeked inside.  “Chocolate is never nothing,” he grinned. “Thank you, for all of this. You always know what I need. You take such good care of me.”
Harry turned his attention on the man.  “You, for one.  Her, for another.  Writing sensational stories to sell papers is one thing, but making up shite and ruining reputations is another.”
Draco relaxed and let a smile cross his face.  Harry always knew exactly what to say.  He leaned back and turned so he could face Harry.
She sat up straight and appeared startled.  The ginger got nervous as she anticipated what Draco could possibly want to ask her.
Harry smiled to himself at the tenderness in Draco’s touch.  He knew Draco wouldn’t hurt him, but he thought he might be tempted to engage in a little S & M.  According to Rita Skeeter, that was how Draco liked it.  The blond denied it, but Harry sort of hoped it was a little true.
Afterwards, Harry thought some fresh air would do him some good. He was out in the courtyard when he wished he had brought a book with him.  Instead, he opted for a walk by the lake.  The air was cool but the sun warmed his black robes and dark hair.  He closed his eyes and turned his face toward the sun. Beginning to feel his mood lift, Harry headed back to the castle.
A slow grin grew on Harry’s face.  “I never brought it up before because I thought you didn’t like to bottom.”
Harry mindlessly ordered food to go, then apparated to Draco’s flat. When he arrived, the blond was not on the couch where he was expected to be.
“Do I need one?” Harry leered.  “I told you what I wanted to do to you in class today.”  He reached out and began to unbutton Draco’s grey silk shirt. “You’re over dressed,” the Chosen One told him.
“I like this more than I thought I would.”  He didn’t usually request being taken from behind because he thought it a less intimate position.  His mind changed when he realized they could still snog.
“He’s taking it harder than me.” Harry watched Draco as Arthur approached him and offered him a butter beer.  “His parents haven’t been understanding.  But we’ll be all right.”  He took a sip of his own butter beer and screwed up the courage to broach the subject he was truly interested in.  “Mione, have you ever heard of someone’s magic taking over someone else’s?”
Harry blinked at Ron’s blunt question. Ever since he’d become an Auror, his investigative skills improved dramatically. Ron, like Harry, was trained to get information quickly and completely without regard to the sensibilities of those questioned. Harry was beginning to miss those days when Ron’s dictum was don’t ask, don’t tell.
“Harry, Draco, so glad to see you,” Ron greeted them at their front door, practically hugging them both.  “Come on in.”
“Every morning, Verde and his mother went out to the grassy land near Lake Bucura.  There, they caught their breakfast of mice or fish.”
She smiled. “As Draco likes to remind me, I’ve had to alter my expectations since the end of the war.”
“I can’t blame anyone but myself.  You were right.  I got caught up in the adulation of a man that didn’t respect our relationship.  It didn’t matter that he kissed me.  I shouldn’t have put myself in a position where he thought that was okay.”
“And I wanted to protect you. It was an overreaction, yes.  But I thought if you learned to make your own potions, and make them well, you would never be at the mercy of a slipshod apothecary.”  Lucius sighed. “I even began looking into Dark-” he cut himself off, and practically held his breath.
Ginny grumbled, “Mum’s insisting we live at the Burrow until Dean can secure a steady job with the Ministry.”
Headmistress McGonagall indulged them an unescorted walk when they arrived that Sunday afternoon to visit Harry.  The three sat in her office and reminisced for a bit beforehand.  While Hermione was interested in the rebuilt and expanded library, Ron wondered about the Room of Requirement.  McGonagall informed Hermione that Flourish and Blotts made a large donation in her name and the Headmistress saw fit to name the new section after Hermione.
Draco nodded and smiled again.  But he knew better than to think he could really trust Pansy.  She would hold this over his head for a very long time.  But at the moment, he had no choice.
“Fuck, I forgot about them,” Draco groaned.  He shook his head.  “I don’t know exactly where Mother is.  It’s all right.  I’ll see her after the holidays.”
“I know it’s different for you.  Most of my House already knows I’m bi.  Lots of other students, as well. They wouldn’t think much of me seeing another man.  But the Chosen One, a poufter?  That’s going to take some getting used to for people.”
“Mother will be disappointed,” Draco said.  “But I think she will understand.  Although, it’ll definitely obligate us to visit her often,” he smirked.
“Things are better.  As much as I loathe Rita Skeeter, her series of articles completely degrading me downgraded my status from Death Eater to laughing stock.  I’ll take laughing stock.  At least everyone leaves me alone now.”
A throat clearing startled the pair.  Blushing deeply, Draco moved his seat further away from Harry’s.  Harry, however, smiled widely at Professor McGonagall.
Ignoring the guards, Hermione addressed the senior Malfoy. “It’s an urgent matter.  I’d like you to reconsider assisting with the capture of Fenrir Greyback.”
“I wouldn’t wait to talk to your parents, if I were you.  I’ve seen the headlines.” She nodded and said no more, but Draco realized what she meant.  It was just one more thing for him to worry about.
“Thanks. It’s my last day of captivity and I’ve literally got nothing to eat in this place.” Draco took the bag from Harry and walked to the kitchen.
“Then what’s really bothering you?  Tell me.  I may not want to shag you anymore, but I’m still your friend,” Draco smiled.
The butterflies that were gently fluttering inside suddenly turned to bats.  Immediately, Harry’s heart rate increased. So much so that he was afraid Draco could hear it from where he sat.  The question of Draco’s intentions now answered, Harry was actually more tense than he had been before.  In his mind, the evening was to progress slowly to this point, and he was completely taken off guard.
At last, the Slytherin stopped and turned around.  Harry could see that he had a thin cord in his ear. He had obviously been listening to his portable Wireless.  Draco pulled the tiny earbuds out of his ears.
For the first time ever, Harry saw Lucius Malfoy, not as a monster, but as a father.  True, he had not been and ideal father.  Draco had mentioned it on more than one occasion.  But he was still a father, mourning the loss of his only son.
Lucius contemplated her words. He held his head up and escorted his wife to their table.  “You’re right.  Fuck ‘em.”
The pair began to make plans, first to go the amusement park and sight-see in London, then a week in Venice and another in the Swiss Alps.
Lucius’ eyes widened, then narrowed.  “What are you playing at?  Why would my son be there, with Potter?”
After about an hour, the three of them had come to an agreement.  The interview would take place the following evening, after a notary wizard had witnessed and bound the contract.
That was when Malfoy walked by.  They caught one another’s eye, and Malfoy nodded a silent acknowledgement.
Slughorn sat down on the other side of the table.  “Yes, I’ve been doing some long put off traveling.  Venice was magnificent.  Clever of those muggles to build it on water.  A bit impractical, but lovely.”
“He also told us you couldn’t do it,” she said.  “Is that when you started having feelings for Harry?”
Finding it harder to keep his emotions in check after Ron’s accusatory tone, Draco reacted more fervently.  “I’d be devastated, all right. Is that what you want to hear, that I would be miserable for the rest of my life, knowing what I could have had?  Do you want to hear that I’ve been in love with him for seven years, and will be for the rest of my life?  So if he leaves me, I’ll never be truly happy.”  He paused.  “Are you going to try and convince Harry to break up with me then?  Do you still hold that much contempt for me after all these years?”  He tried to hold Ron’s glare, but his eyes began to tear, and he had to blink repeatedly to keep them from escaping.
“I haven’t seen George in a while,” Harry added.  “Come on Mione, Draco and I have gone there a couple of times.  It’s not so bad. The food has improved.”
“Daddy!  Da!  A floo call!  A floo call!”  She stopped in front of them, panting and out of breath.  Looking up with green eyes as big as saucers, she managed to get out, “Poppy took a floo call.”
The four of them chatted and passed the baby when she got fussy. Even Draco took a brief turn. Though, it was almost worse for Harry to see him with an infant in his arms.
Harry was somewhat taken aback by Draco’s question.  He sounded more than simply curious.  He almost sounded angry.
“Look at you, juggling a baby in one hand and a drink in the other,” Harry joked. “Fatherhood’s finally agreeing with you.”
“Well, Harry can’t go anywhere, and we can play a game or something.  Very informal.  Will you ask them, Draco?”
“They have been dating quite a long time.”  Draco bit his lip. “I’m sorry.  He isn’t my friend.  I guess I shouldn’t make fun.”
Harry stood on the balcony of their Italian villa, overlooking the Maritime Alps, near the French border.
The selection coordinator smiled. “Perhaps if the donor knows it’s your husband’s child she would be carrying . . .”  She didn’t bother to finish.  Both Harry and Draco caught her meaning.
Draco nodded.  “With my parents.  A long time ago.  I haven’t done much traveling in the past several years, except to go to France to student teach.”
“God fucking damnit.”  He stilled and squeezed Harry tightly. His forehead rested on Harry’s back. They remained in position, shirts and jackets still on, bent over the bed, for a few moments.
“Nothing,” Draco said quickly, looking guilty.  He stared at Harry for a moment, stiff. Then slowly, he held his hand out.  “I’m so sorry.  I broke it already.”  Draco appeared as though he was about to cry.  Harry just sat across from him, mouth gaping.
“Well, I believe a strong drink is in order.” Lucius said, opening a small liquor cabinet. “Romanian fire whiskey.”
“Frankly, you do the same to me. And I’m not even injured,” Harry chuckled. “This has been building up so slowly between us, I really didn’t see it coming. I’ve never been friends with anyone before becoming lovers. Friendly, yes, but not real friends. Well, except for Ginny. But the point is, I think this has the potential to be something special and I don’t want to rush it.”
“Yes, his family was pureblood and back then, a pure blood would never even look at a half blood, much less a muggle-born.  It’s a romantic story.” The perky blonde continued to tell the tale.  “They dated secretly until his brother discovered them and told.  Wyatt’s family threatened to disown him if he didn’t stop seeing her.  And her family didn’t understand the wizard ways.  So just like Romeo and Juliet, they made a pact to kill themselves.”
At first, Harry was glad for his position at the table, three down from Draco.  But after a while, he found himself leaning forward a bit more than necessary to speak with Professor Trelawney to his left.  Harry’s gaze traveled past her on occasion to get a glimpse of Malfoy.  Several times, the Head of Slytherin glanced up, catching Harry, who couldn’t avert his eyes fast enough.  After the third or fourth time, Harry leaned back in his seat to avoid Malfoy altogether.
Harry swallowed, trying to find his voice. “Draco?  You just kissed me,” Harry said, barely above a whisper.
“I feel fine.  Actually, I feel . . . fantastic now.” He rubbed his chest, then flexed his left hand.  “It’s like the shadow of dark magic that was there, was taken away. Oh, Gods, Harry, I didn’t even ask you if you’re all right.”
“I just want tonight to be perfect,” Ron explained.  “Just have some cake.  I promise, you’ll like it.  Mum made it special for you.”
“No, you haven’t ruined anything.  But . . . it does change things.”  Harry took a deep breath and let it back out.  “I think we shouldn’t rush this.  I don’t think I’d feel right about you pouring your heart into something that turns out to be a fling.”
He disengaged just long enough for Draco to roll onto his back, then continued on.  When he leaned forward to kiss him, Draco reached around and squeezed Harry’s arse.  His fingers moved toward the relaxed hole until he could put his cum covered fingers inside.
The Chief Warlock banged his gavel and declared it so. Lucius and Draco stood as the members of the Wizengamot exited the room.
“You still haven’t told me what you want from me,” Lucius pointed out.  “Aside from the terms that have already been laid out.”
The boys kissed and fondled one another, enjoying and prolonging the excitement of their first time together.  Harry was anxious to get on with it, but after the patience Draco had shown him over the past two months, he figured he could show a little patience himself.
She gave Harry a funny look, one he couldn’t quite read.  The corner of her mouth rose slightly.  “Yes, I think you two make quite a team.”
“Really?” Harry could hardly believe they’d been there nearly three hours.  The time passed as quickly as it did when he was with Hermione and Ron.  Of course, he had no desire to kiss either of them as their evenings drew to a close.
“What are you looking at?” Harry asked.  He peeked around the corner to find Draco sitting in his usual chair.  Beside him sat Victoire.  On one knee was Dominique, and on the other was Rose.  A large storybook was opened before them as they quietly listened to Draco read.
Draco smiled.  “I know. But, it’s one of the few classes we share, and I’d like to be his partner.  Besides, he’s feeling a bit insecure lately.”
“Draco, I’m really not spending that much time with him.  I didn’t mention the trip to Diagon Alley because I knew you had duty and wouldn’t be able to go.”
“I’m not disturbing you, am I?” Draco asked.  When Harry shook his head, he sat down next to Harry.  “Extra hungry today, Potter?” he joked.
“And now everyone is breaking up?” Harry asked.  It hadn’t yet occurred to him that he and Draco were also brought together by the game.  “I don’t understand.  What have you been keeping from me?”
Draco pushed himself up on his hands.  “I didn’t mean that I thought you were doing something on purpose.” He remembered Pansy telling him at the beginning of the year, some old witch’s tale about powerful wizards and sex.  But he and Harry had sex a few times and nothing like that had happened before.  “Harry, has anything like this ever–fucking hell.  It’s gone.”
“Ah, yes, the prize,” Slughorn smiled.  “I thought long and hard about that one. I decided to make it fun.  This time the winners will receive certificates to Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes,” he said enthusiastically.
Pulling his invisibility cloak over himself, hoping to fool the wards, Harry watched Malfoy as he raised his wand in one hand and held up the other. He whispered an incantation, closing his eyes.  Through the cloak, Harry could just make out the subtle sparks of magic responding to Draco’s voice.
“We’re not–oh, never mind,” Pansy began to explain. “It’s not like I need to protect my reputation,” she laughed.
“You weren’t cowardly,” Harry replied.  “I thought you showed great restraint not hexing Rita Skeeter’e big fat arse.”  Harry smiled, but Draco was unmoved.
“No.  He did pull his wand, but just to remove the charms he put up.  In fact,” Harry flushed again.  “He messed my hair up further and told me it was . . . sexy.”  He said it quickly and practically in a whisper.  “You don’t really want to hear all this.”
After a relatively short post-supper session in the library with Knox, Harry walked into his room to find Draco napping on his bed.  The corner of his mouth rose as he watched Draco’s chest rise and fall, accompanied by a small snore.
Happily complying, Draco’s hand squeezed just a bit harder as it stroked Harry’s shaft, while his teeth nibbled at his nipple.
“I suppose I’m rather indifferent towards them now.” Draco blushed before admitting, “However, I spent a great deal of time wanking in here between lovers.”
Chuckling, Harry answered, “I wasn’t going to tell you.  I never acted on any of my feelings until after Ginny and I broke up.  And now I know for sure. I’m definitely gay.”
“Yeah, this is great.  All I have to do is walk downstairs for work,” Draco assured him.  “I really do like it.  It’s a bit smaller than I’m used to, but that’s all right.”
“At least, I think that’s what’s going on.”  She leaned closer.  “He told me he’s infatuated with someone.  He didn’t say who, but he used the word, inappropriate.”
Ron laughed. “That’s what happens when you never go on holiday. See you later.” He and Hermione began to walk toward the door.
Draco begged McGonagall to let him go to the Burrow.  He carefully and calmly explained what Stephen Cornfoot had told him.  He stood in disbelief when she denied him.
Taking in the situation--Draco’s state of undress, Blaise in his room sharing wine--Harry’s Gryffindor courage floundered.
He put a finger to his lips upon seeing Hermione.  She backed away before Rose could see her, and silently closed the door.  Shaking her head, Hermione went to the kitchen to put up a pot of tea and place Draco’s sandwich on a plate.  By the time she was finished with the preparations, Draco had found his way into the kitchen after putting Rose in her cot.
“Jeez Mione.  You think you’d never seen Harry in his pants before,” Ron said, mimicking Draco’s sentiments.
worried, until you said that.  Are you thinking about your visit with your mother?”  Harry sat up a bit straighter.  “Did she
“Cinderella?  So, clothing goes back to normal and things transfigured go back to their original form?”  Hermione thought about Harry’s glasses and hair.
“You give me too much credit,” Harry said.  “Any changes you see in Draco, he made himself, before we met back up at Hogwarts.”
Loudly enough for others to hear, if they were listening, Harry casually said, “Do you mind doing the final writing again.  Your handwriting is so much better than mine.”  As he said it, he slowly lowered his hand onto Draco’s thigh.
“So, you’re still going to be friends with him.”  It wasn’t a question.  Clearly dissatisfied, Draco sighed.
“What?  Oh yeah, I forgot we all switched.” Hermione frowned.  “Wait, you think Blaise and Draco are a couple?”
Shaking his head, Draco answered, “No.  But I think you don’t want to admit that what everyone expects of you isn’t what you really want out of life.  For yourself.  I thought this might help.”
“You’re free to go,” the Healer smiled.  “Don’t forget to take the potion, Auror Potter.”  He held out his hand to shake once more, and left Harry to dress.
Draco shifted his weight slightly and began to stroke Harry with his free hand.  The constant moans coming from his partner were too much to bear, and Draco slid from his knees to his belly, trapping his own erection between his body and the satin sheets. He ground himself against the bed with the same rhythm he used on Harry’s cock.
“I love it.  I can’t even begin to tell you how much I love it.”  Harry stared at Draco’s cock as it stood, at full attention and surrounded by clean shaven skin.
With tears still glistening in his eyes, Draco smiled at him.  “It was boring at the Manor anyway.  Mother was busy planning her parties that she can’t have now, and Pansy only visited once.”
“Eew,” Ron wrinkled up his nose.  “The thought of anyone shaggin’ that disgusting monster . . . it gives me the chills.”
“All right.  I suppose I wouldn’t mind getting the hair out of my way.” 	Reaching for his wand on the side table, Draco prepared to do the spell on Harry. 	“Wait,” Harry said.  “Just the hair right? Everything else stays.”
Harry jumped in his chair in the library when Draco burst through the door out of breath. He had been staring at a parchment for the previous ten minutes in disbelief.  The paper had floated to the floor, landing at Draco’s feet.
Harry wandered about the castle for a while, cooling off from his tirade against Hermione and Ron.  Poor Ron didn’t even know what hit him.  He decided to head back to his dormitory on the seventh floor to apologize.
After the previous talk, Harry had a difficult time coming up with answer besides his original reason for wanting to go.  And he couldn’t very well say that he wanted to go to a nude beach with Draco.  Fortunately, Draco intervened.
He waved it off, but deep down, it was nagging at him.  It was almost within his recollection.  He’d told Draco something he didn’t want to but was powerless to stop himself.  If only he could remember the question.
“You sound like an advertisement. Just because everyone says you’d make a good Auror, doesn’t mean to have to be one.  What do you want to do?”
When Harry walked into the sitting room, George and Charlie were having a quiet discussion about the new dragons that were born only two months ago. Arthur was listening, munching away on pumpkin bread. Ron was doing the same, resembling his father more than ever before.
“I knew it would be nasty,” Goshawk nodded.  “May I add it to my compendium?  I’ll give full credit to Severus.”
“Good enough, I’m sure,” Draco said hurriedly and placed his lips over Harry’s.  He moaned into the brunet’s mouth as they brought their bodies closer together, trapping erections between them.  Bumping and grinding, the boys took their time building toward release.
“Yes,” he smiled.  “Because I really do want to do this.  Please say yes.  It’ll be the best Christmas ever.”
“Well, then, you see?  It all works out.  Next number,” Pansy called out.  “Besides, its’ too late now.  Your wands are bound.”
Draco couldn’t figure out why Harry was saying such hurtful things to him.  Did he think Draco would just leave him when he was ready to start a family?
“Wait, so she wanted to shag, and you wanted to eat cake? No wonder she was brassed off,” Harry chuckled.
“Uh.  Well, that’s different.  Ron and I knew each other for so many years.  We were already best friends. . . “
Dean hit his forehead with his palm. “Oh, how could I be so stupid?  I asked her to spend Christmas with me.  She seemed horrified that I would even suggest it.  That’s probably why.”
Following her line of sight, Harry spotted Draco dancing with several students.  It was purely in good fun, but Harry felt a swell of envy.  Unlike most of the professors, the young Potions Master was joining in the merriment.  And the students, particularly the female ones, enjoyed dancing in close proximity to the handsome professor. They giggled and nudged one another.  And though Harry knew Draco had no interest in them whatsoever, he still felt envious.
Harry’ gaze traveled to the wrapped box.  “I didn’t get you a gift.  That’s a gift, isn’t it?” he grinned.
Once fully nude, Harry reclaimed his spot straddling Draco. He rocked his hips forward and back, rubbing their erections together lightly.
“My group is rather indifferent,” Draco said.  “But I suppose I shouldn’t have expected anything less from Slytherins.  Some things never change.”
“Oh, yeah,” The Healer told him dismissively.  “You boys are joined for life.  I’ve never seen such a strong bond.” Healer Cummins paused and laughed.  “How did you manage that?”
Harry briefly glanced Knox’s way, knowing that he was the only professor to whom they didn’t extend an invitation. Not that the rest all attended.  Some of them needed to remain to supervise the small group of students. And others went to spend the holiday with their families. Still, he felt a bit guilty.
She took a seat across from them and spun the pile of parchment toward herself. Harry and Draco sat nervously while she looked over the application.
Harry sat uncomfortably for a moment, unsure what to say.  Like himself, Narcissa has mostly likely had to alter her expectations over the years.  Though sympathetic, Harry couldn’t worry about her feelings.  He had to concentrate on Draco. It was him Harry wanted to please.
Immediately, he went to a small cabinet where he kept a bottle of firewhiskey and a carafe of mulled mead.  He unstoppered the bottle and drank directly from it.
She picked up a handful of floo powder and threw it in the fireplace.  “Professor McGonagall’s office.”
“He’s a bit high strung.  It’s nothing,” Draco answered vaguely.  Casper had specifically requested Draco not share their last conversation with anyone.  And as much as he wanted to share everything with Harry, it wasn’t his place to talk about the boy’s woes.
Harry mumbled a lubrication spell they had recently learned and leaned over with his hands bracing him on the mattress.
what I want.  I love to see you happy, and I can see that this makes you really happy.  So, it makes me happy.  I love you.”
“Oh, yeah,” Blaise laughed.  “The one we called Knockers?  I forgot all about him.  He’s a cousin, right?”
“I could feel everyone watching me at breakfast.  Same as yesterday.  Nothing’s changed.  Except now they’re all thinking about the Dark Mark and wondering if I’m still a Death Eater in secret or something.”
He swallowed, knowing she was lying.  “Yeah, everything’s great.  Congratulations again.”  He kissed her cheek, then flooed to Hogwarts with Draco.
Harry leveled his wand at Boot, ready to hex him with the first thing that came to mind.  But Draco put a hand on his arm and forced it down.
“Time, and remembering all the good things Dumbledore did and said to me.  Plus, realizing that if I had known from the beginning what was expected from me, things may have turned out differently.  Not for the better.”  Harry smiled.  “But you have an opportunity I didn’t have.  You can talk to your father.  You can tell him how you felt, how you still feel.  And he can offer his own account, or feelings.”
Molly and Ginny were the only ones who burst out laughing.  Everyone else seemed to think it was simply an odd comment.
“She’s not here.  You’ll have to come back tomorrow.”  The man began to close the door, but Harry stopped it with his foot.
Blaise told Draco the incantation and they way to flourish his wand.  Blaise also suggested he try it out on himself before performing it on Harry.  Draco whispered the charm and waved his wand at himself.
A quick glance at the clock told Harry it was almost ten o’clock.  Late, but not too late to straighten things out.  Not wanting to have an awkward first meeting in the classroom the following morning, Harry got up and resolved to find Draco.
“I know you Slytherins have a reputation for being snobbish and mean.  But I think it’s a front.  You weren’t like that at all at the dance.  You were nice and charming and funny.  I think that was the real you.  And I liked it.”
Unfortunately, by lunch time, Harry was starving.  He strolled to the Great Hall hoping to arrive well after Draco. His plan was to go straight to his seat without having to interact with the blond. When he reached the Hall, all but two seats were taken--his and Draco’s.
“Fine.  Call it what you want,” she said.  “But it doesn’t change the fact that you were fantasizing about Draco while you were doing it.  So, I’ll ask you again.  What are your intentions toward him?”
Harry straightened himself up.  He couldn’t recall Draco ever paying a visit to Gryffindor.  Still embarrassed for watching Draco sleep, Harry avoided eye contact.
Two or three more quick strokes had Harry spilling out load after load of spunk over the mattress, headboard, and Draco’s hand.
Michael nodded.  “Yeah, all right.”  He let her lead the way, so she wouldn’t notice him adjusting himself within his trousers. They sat back on the couch, Parvati with her hands nervously placed on her lap, awkwardly looking around the Gryffindor common room.  Anywhere but at Michael.   He did the same. The pair didn’t speak about what they heard or about anything else until Michael suggested they go to sleep, leaving both of them frustrated, but too timid to do anything about it.
“Of course,” Narcissa answered, and took another before he left.  “Admit it, Lucius.  It was delicious.”
“They would have–” he suddenly gasped.  “Death Eaters.”  Draco grasped his mother’s forearm firmly and grinned excitedly.  “I can’t believe I forgot to tell you.”
After supper on that Friday, Harry was walking past a large picture window.  He’d noticed a few snowflakes falling earlier but thought nothing of it as it was a bit early in the year for a real snowfall.  Now he was surprised to see several inches covering the Hogwarts grounds.  Harry smiled as he recalled some happy memories as a boy, playing in the snow with his friends. He hadn’t been sledding in ages and thought perhaps that was just the sort of fun he and Draco needed.  Briefly, he wondered if the Slytherin had ever gone sledding.
A short time later, Hermione watched Harry as he glanced over across the pub.  The corners of his mouth raised ever so faintly into an almost imperceptible smile. When she turned her head to follow his line of sight, she noticed Draco look back at him.  Not with malice as Ron had suggested, but with something Hermione couldn’t quite put her finger on.  But if she was forced to put words to it, the one that came to mind, was longing.
“Yes.  He’s been doing poorly in Potions.  Draco has been giving him extra help to try and get him ready for his O.W.L.s.”
“It’s been a while since you and I spent any time alone together,” Hermione commented as she and Harry strolled down Diagon Alley.  Small flurries fell from the cloudy grey sky dusting their hair lightly. The pair turned into Quality Quidditch Supplies and shook the snow from their hair.  A man, dressed in robes, quickly waved a wand at them.
“Quite all right,” Draco smiled. “Clearly, I’m not one of the clan, and she senses that.  Children are very perceptive.”
“Uh, snow, lemons and, um, ginger,” he made up on the spot, inspired by Ron’s hair.  He wasn’t about to admit that one of the scents that attracted him was the boy’s locker room.  He never even thought about it before, but now that he did, he became aware that he rather liked the locker room.  Especially filled with sweaty boys.  He could feel his face get warm again and silently cursed himself.
“No, wait, not like that.  He wasn’t really planning anything bad.  I’m not explaining this well.” Harry took a breath.  “Okay, what I mean to say, is that both dreams started out one way, negatively.  But then changed over the course of time.  And when the events actually happened, they were not bad at all.”
“I’m surprised you’ve never been to Greece, Draco,” Margeaux commented.  “Didn’t you tell me that your family has traveled quite a bit?”
“Trying to have fun.  No one knows who we are.  No one cares.  Just dance,” Draco ordered.  He released Harry’s hand and ran his fingers through his own hair.  He felt free.  Free to make a fool of himself if he wanted.  Free to dance publicly with the object of his affection.  All with no consequences.  He wanted Harry to enjoy it with him.
“Draco, I think about her often enough without anyone bringing up the subject.”  She attempted a smile.  “And I think it’s a good idea.  But I don’t think we should make a spectacle of it.  It should just be our family.  Just the four of us.”
Draco groaned with the first of the trusts but became accustomed quickly.  Harry rocked slowly in and out.
Once inside, he flopped directly onto his bed and began to sob.  The sight of Knox’s mouth covering Harry’s played over and over in slow motion in his head.
Toward the end of the interrogation, after Skeeter had asked Harry about his experiences directly after killing Voldemort, she asked about a former interview.
Draco turned away and sat on the edge of the bed.  “Yes, I do.  I just didn’t mean to tell you,” he said softly.  “I’ve scared you off now, haven’t I?”
Harry did a double take as he walked down the stairs toward the Great Hall.  He could have sworn he saw Ron rounding a corner.  Curiosity getting the better of him, Harry investigated.
Harry nervously followed Draco into the Slytherin Seventh and Eighth Year dormitory.  He’d never been in another house’s dormitory before.
“Instead, I’ll just tell you that before you and I were once again thrown together by fate, I was going through the motions.  I had no idea what I’d been missing until you showed me. You say I saved your life, but I think it was the other way around.  And I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.  I love you.”  His voice wavered.  “Those words are easy to say, and perhaps said too often, but not meant enough.  I hope to show you, in every way, how very much I love you.  So, you’ll know, even if I don’t say the words.”
Harry was, by no means a prude, but the proliferation of sexual stimulation on the walls gave him pause.
“We should be on our bloody honeymoon,” Draco grumbled. “Not attending what’s sure to be the most uncomfortable family brunch ever.”
“I don’t know. Anything that you can concentrate on. Something that might take your mind off the pain.” Harry paused. “Ready?”
“Yes.” The professor stood and walked around her desk to look up at Draco. “You are on your way to becoming a fine man. Don’t get distracted by pettiness.  Be true to your heart and do what you think is right.”
“Yeah, but he turned it down,” Harper said.  “I thought it would be great, the two of us working together this summer.  And then, out of the blue, he says he’s going to Romania.” Harper began to get teary-eyed.
“But why?  It’s a completely pointless potion,” she complained, earning glares from many girls in the class.
“No, I want to keep the ceremony quiet and small,” Harry said.  “In fact, if we could keep this within Hogwarts walls until we can make an announcement in the papers, that would be ideal.”
“Well, I think it’s important,” Harry said.  “If you don’t want me to write about your personal lives, I won’t.” He paused. “But you have to admit, you two do have a cute little love story.”
Draco had to force himself to stop what he was doing and disengage himself.  He lay down next to Harry and let him climb on. As Harry’s bum came in contact with his bollocks, the pair moaned in pleasure.
Hermione laughed.  “I don’t think so.  It’s done by a wedding officiant.  Why are you asking about it?”  She gasped.  “You aren’t thinking about getting married already are you?”
Several weeks into the school year, most had settled into a routine. Ron and Hermione’s routine appeared to consist of her chastising him for not studying hard enough, and him marching off in a huff to play wizards chess.  It was a game he knew she abhorred.  She would always turn to Ginny or Harry for a sympathetic ear.  But they had their own problems.
Harry had no idea Ron had noticed him kissing Draco, but he was pleased to find out that even his best friend didn’t know it was him.
“Thanks, but it won’t be necessary.  The mediwitch will take them to the nursery for us.  They won’t come home until tomorrow.”
Harry shoved his shoulder lightly.  “That old scaredy cat?  He wasn’t even that good looking.  Besides, I wouldn’t fancy a visit to ward 49 at St. Mungo’s,” he laughed.  “I’m talking about you, of course.  Impossibly, you look even more handsome with your hair this way.”
“Lucius,” Harry said, diverting his attention.  “I will publicly support you.  I may not be able to make up for lost time, however, I am still a highly respected member of wizarding society.  I still have influence.  The Aurors will still patrol your home. And perhaps I can convince Minister Shacklebolt to return some of your more sentimental items--as long as they don’t contain any Dark magic.”
“No.  I have no intention of dropping my other friends for him.  I don’t expect him to either,” Harry assured Ron.
Ginny picked at her nails, avoiding eye contact with Harry.  “If you don’t want me anymore . . .” she swallowed, trying to wet her suddenly dry throat.  “Maybe, we should . . .”
The rest of the interview went similarly.  Rita would pose a question, Harry would answer as  carefully as possible, then Skeeter would ask her chaser.  Sometimes she caught him off guard.  Sometimes he left very little room to lead him.  Overall, Harry felt good about the interview.  And provided they printed everything he said and didn’t use creative editing, he thought Draco would approve.
Harry kissed him and smiled. “The only thing I’m worried about is whether or not your arse will be up for another shag session tonight.”  He took hold of Draco’s chin.  “Nothing is more important to me than you.”
“Draco?  I hope you’re all right. I . . . was angry with you last night because you didn’t show.  But I didn’t know something happened to you. I’m so sorry I snapped at you the other day.  I hadn’t been sleeping well.  It’s been going on for a couple of weeks.  Bad dreams.  I know they’re only dreams.  At least that’s what Hermione says.” He took Draco’s hand in his.  “But they have me worried.”
Knowing it would most likely bring Harry to his climax sooner than desired, Draco continued to stroke his cock as they stood in the middle of the room kissing.  The blond enjoyed the noises Harry made, and even more so that he was the cause.
“And so, you decided to give me this rare book to make up for it?”  Her expression was unreadable to Draco, for she almost always wore the same one, even when she was being kind.
Draco stood listening to Blaise go on.  He’d never considered any of the things Blaise said.  Draco saw their differences--the rich boy with the prominent, pure blood family, versus the seemingly poor orphan who didn’t even learn about magic until he was called to Hogwarts.  Opposites in many ways.  He’d always thought of them as enemies, opponents, rivals.  Famous, and infamous. Truthfully, Draco never realized Blaise had that much insight into his own life.  He supposed that was why his friend had stuck by him after the war, when so many others looked down upon him.
Harry stirred at the sound of Draco’s voice.  The arm behind his head came down and wrapped around his lover, squeezing him in a yawn and stretch.
Following an embarrassingly bad rendition of the birthday song, cake was passed around.  Still a bit overwhelmed by the attention, Draco sat in the corner chair again and listened to everyone else talk.
“That’s ridiculous,” Hermione scoffed.  “That’s like saying a boy and a girl can’t be just friends.”
“Harry,” she narrowed her eyes.  “I know you well enough to know when you’re not telling the whole truth.  You were thrown off by something in class.  What was it?”
Thinking that Draco was ready to fuck him, Harry raised his arse as high in the air as possible, under the circumstances.  Draco reached around to his front finding Harry hard already.  He massaged him while fondling a nipple as best he could.
“I’m no longer an Auror,” Harry offered.  “Whatever you say to Draco won’t leave this room by my mouth.”
“And you’re still here,” Malfoy observed.  “I wasn’t sure how willing you would be to work with me.”
Ron walked over to her, happy to be out of that conversation.  If Harry’s face was any indication, he and Draco didn’t necessarily agree on the subject of children.
Not giving Harry a choice, he took him by the hand and led him into the crowd just as the music slowed down.  Harry glanced around uncomfortably.
“He’s fascinating, isn’t he?  I can’t imagine how long it took him to identify thirty-one different types of magical ferns,” she said excitedly.
Ron blushed again, awkwardly looking away.  Hermione turned her attention to Draco and began a conversation about which nappies were best, in her opinion.
Stroking his chin, Draco replied, “Logically, I understand my father’s motives and actions.  But it doesn’t change what happened, or how it shaped me.”
Thoughtfully rubbing her chin, Hermione took out a piece of parchment and a quill.  She began to sketch a few designs.  Harry watched and made small suggestions, until they came up with a good idea of how Harry’s outfit would look.
“No, that wasn’t what I was getting at,” Narcissa said slowly.  “But since you brought it up . . .” She turned to Harry.  “Do you think Draco is good enough for you?”
Harry waited for Draco to start, then began to unwrap the gold box.  He wanted to catch Draco before he opened the other package, but the brunet was too busy gawking at a gold pocket watch.  Harry ran his finger over the front. There was a shallow relief of the Hogwarts castle on it. Clicking the tiny knob on top opened the cover, revealing a sepia clock face with Roman numerals and intricate wand replicas as the hands.  It was the most impressive watch Harry had ever seen.  He vaguely heard a gasp from Draco, while he was still admiring the piece.
Harry picked it up.  He immediately felt a kinship with the wand.  Not the same as his own, but familiar and comforting. “Why was this left?”
“I don’t know.  I can’t imagine Hermione, with her muggle, wizard and house elf rights convictions so strong, would turn away from me simply because I love your cock,” Harry laughed.
“Oh, well, then I guess that is romantic,” Ron conceded.  “But why is the bracelet here?  Why didn’t she take it with her?”
“I’m sorry I wasn’t strong enough to go against your father during the war.  I’ll do all I can to make it up to you.”
Knox shared a few ‘invented’ facts about his friend Burt, prompting Harry to open up about his relationship with Draco.  Burt was actually a friend, but he was a straight friend.  He and Knox never shared more than a casual friendship.  However, in his attempt to get closer to Harry, by playing on his sympathies, Knox embellished quite a bit.
Standing, and gaining courage, Harry took out money to cover their meals and a tip.  “And for the record, meeting you wasn’t a waste of my time at all.  You’re perfectly lovely company.  I hope you find a nice bloke who deserves you.”
“I still won’t be able to have children ten years down the road.  Draco, you’ll have to find a woman for that.”
“And why should I care?  He got in.” Lucius grinned.  “But he can’t get out.  Is that it?  Serves him right.”
His heart not completely in it, Harry got up to get what he needed.  With Hermione and Draco in the class, Harry knew he’d never win a challenge, so he simply concentrated on getting the job done correctly.
That was gone now.  Harry leaned forward on the desk and rested his forehead on his arms. He couldn’t keep his eyes open.
Harry hadn’t thought of that.  “No, of course not.”  He smiled.  “You’re right.  I’m sorry. Eggnog,” he said to the Fat Lady.
A small smile crosseds Harry’s lips. “You forget I used to be an Auror.  Classic manipulation of your subject.”
Harry shook his head.  “No.  I’m in love with Draco.  He and I have a long and complicated history. I really feel it’s fate.  And even if for some reason, we don’t last, I can’t change my heart.  I already gave it to him.  I can’t give it to you.  I can’t feel more than friendship for you.”
“Well, I don’t have season Quidditch tickets so I can’t reciprocate.  At least I can treat you to supper.”  Harry liked the idea of taking Draco out, even if it was only in his mind. “I didn’t realize how much I needed to get away from the castle until we arrived at the match.”
They spoke about the Auror training Draco was to go through after he was healed completely. Harry explained the tests he would have to go through. Though, in Draco’s case, they were a formality. The Ministry was honoring its agreement. Harry told him he particularly enjoyed the Stealth and Tracking training.
“Let’s just say, I accept it. I wouldn’t want anyone trying to tell Hermione she shouldn’t be with me. So I shouldn’t do the same to you.”  He pointed a finger at Draco.  “But don’t give me any reason to intervene.”
Sighing with relief, Harry sat on the couch next to Pansy and nodded a greeting to Tracey, who sat on her other side.
At the same time, a similar party was going on in Ravenclaw.  Except there would be no bedazzled boys wearing tiaras.  Boot, Cornfoot and several other less tolerant Hogwarts students gathered.  Instead of wine, they downed firewhiskey and bitched about Harry Poufter and the other pansies.
Draco relaxed a bit when he realized that Harry was only speaking of the way Draco took care of him.  “We were out after school hours as friends, not as professors.  At least you didn’t throw up on me.”
Midway through the meal, Professor McGonagall returned and made her way to the head table.  She glanced at Draco as she passed and did a double take.  Pausing ever so briefly, she nodded and smiled at him.  He was relieved that she apparently approved of his change in seating.
Still straddling Draco’s thighs, Harry pulled Draco’s arms out of his sleeves and slid his shirt out from under him.  He scooted back and undid the trousers.  In order to remove them, Harry reluctantly got up and allowed Draco to pull off his own trousers and pants. He took off his pants at the same time, never taking his eyes off his lover.
Draco was still a bit uneasy.  However, overall, he was pleased with his reading.  Olivia poured a cup of tea for Draco and bade him to drink it, leaving just a bit at the bottom.
Ron sighed.  “I figure if we hook up with other people and regret it, maybe we’ll realize how much we belong together.  If not, we might find new partners.  Either way, Harry, we can’t go on just fighting all the time.”
It wasn’t the first time the journal had encouraged him to keep writing. Biting his lip, he cursed the journal in his head.  Of course there was more.  More that Harry didn’t want to admit to.
“For one, it’s a place I’ve never been,” he said. “And the Mediterranean is supposed to be breathtaking. Plus, Harry wanted to try authentic Greek food, as opposed to the inferior fare we’ve gotten in London.”
“There is an awful lot of money in that account,” the Interrogator said, not exactly accusing but hinting at impropriety.
“Then what is it?” Ginny quickly glanced at Draco, who was busy reading a book. She took Harry’s elbow. “Come on, let’s take a walk to the cafeteria.  I haven’t eaten since lunch.”
“I suppose it would be better all around.  I mean, I’m fairly sure it’s yours anyway.  But how will you feel raising another man’s child?”
Instead of instructing Harry, Draco touched his own nipples, scratching at them rapidly with his well-manicured nails.
“I was wondering. . .  if you knew any spells.  For cleansing.” It took Draco a while to finally spit out.
“I’m pretty certain I called you practically perfect,” Harry smirked. He stuck two fingers in the top of Draco’s waistband and pulled, peeking inside. “I was wrong, though. You’re absolutely perfect.” He placed his whole hand inside while pulling Draco closer with his other hand. Draco groaned as Harry closed his hand around him.
“No, but I don’t let him control me anymore.  Believe it or not, Harry, I understand what Knox is going through.  His parents just hid it better than mine did.  They manipulated him to keep up appearances.  I’m not saying that he should wish his parents ill.  I’m only saying that it’s not his responsibility, whatever happens to them.”
“I said I would.”  He muttered under his breath, “I may as well ruin that relationship while I’m at it.”
Harry arrived seven minutes before ten o’clock in the Astronomy Tower, but Draco was already there.  He was leaning against the railing, looking up at the cloudy sky.  There was a bottle and a small wrapped package on the floor next to him.  Harry took a moment to admire his form from behind.  The tall, lean blond wore dark jeans and a silk navy button up shirt.  The night was a bit chilly and Harry had wished he wore long sleeves as Draco had.  He’d have to remember to cast a warming charm, once he set up their treats.
“Then maybe it wouldn’t be such a bad thing for the two of you to live apart while you sort things out.  Eventually, find a new place to start fresh, one that doesn’t harbor bad memories for either of you.”
“Yeah, but then I have a date to screw the hell out of my boyfriend.  And he’ll be oh-so-grateful that I’m making an effort with his friends.”  He grinned and winked.  Blaise mimed sticking his finger down his throat.
The foursome made their way to the ballroom.  When the band leader saw them in the doorway, he stopped the light jazz music they had been playing.
“Looks like a good crowd,” Anthony commented.  He spotted Romilda Vane.  “I thought you said no sixth years.”
Harry talked them through each day of their visit, adding his observations and opinions about the people and places they saw. He described the gondola rides, tours of the major attractions and the fresh seafood they ate daily in mouthwatering detail.
“I see,” Harry cleared his throat.  “Do you need help getting back?” His wall was firmly back in place, his emotions neatly tucked behind it.
“No.   I have not yet been to my quarters,” he replied. “I was in the Potions class room preparing for students.”  Draco paused.  “And, if you please, Mr. Malfoy is my father. Call me Draco.”
Shrugging sheepishly, Harry answered, “I’m sorry. I couldn’t help myself. I wanked and came when you did. It’s been a while for me as well.”
Disappointed, Harry agreed to stay.  Draco had actually been looking forward to his reading.  And thus far, the evening hadn’t been all he’d hoped.  Except for the Harpies tickets, of course.
They lay in the tub, making plans for their honeymoon, and their future beyond that.  Round two did indeed last longer than the first.  As did round three. After that the pair slept soundly for what was left of the night, in Draco’s pink and purple room.
“That’s terrible,” Harry frowned. “Well, you shouldn’t have lied, but I can understand why you did. Is there . . . anything else you lied about?”
Rose wasn’t crying as much these days.  However, Ron still hadn’t figured out the secret to soothing her.  Occasionally, Hermione didn’t have any better luck. Christmas day was one of the baby’s good days, though, and everyone was happy to take a turn holding the seven week old.
She looked around.  She and Blaise had been lab partners for two weeks and he seemed pretty straight forward, ironically, but Pansy was a mystery.
Within minutes, Harry had Draco stripped down to a pair of Slytherin green pants, pinned beneath him on the bed.  Rutting against one another like a pair of randy teens, they barely had time to snog before Harry was reaching for the lube and spreading it sloppily over his arse. Without using fingers for prep, Draco entered Harry.
want to get back with Harper.”  He glanced down to the end of the table where Harper had taken to sitting since the breakup.  Pansy and Blaise followed suit. Harper appeared even more miserable than Blaise.
Smiling, Harry continued.  “It’s time for me to stop telling you and show you.”  He looked around his chambers.  “This isn’t exactly the venue I had planned for this. But there it is.”
On the way out of breakfast, Draco caught up to Harry in the corridor.  He subtly passed Harry a note explaining his scheme as he walked silently beside him.  He wanted the partner switch to occur before Slughorn announced the new project.  Granger might not be willing to switch once she found out about it.
“I’ve been so incredibly happy with you, Harry, that I didn’t think I needed anyone else.” He added, “Until her.”
Shaking his head, Draco replied, “No. It’s not the trip. I want to go. But not until I’ve told you the truth. You’re right, I’ve been distracted.”
“Oh, uh, well, we should probably all try to get along, so I figure we ought to call each other by first names.”
He was feeling a little better about the situation and began laying out the ingredients for the day’s potion.  By the time he was finished, most of the students were seated and ready for class.
Draco made two attempts to get up before staggering to his feet.  Harry wondered if Draco had started drinking before he got to the Tower.  Harry turned to leave.
“Why didn’t Boot get punished for the things he said?” Draco immediately wished he hadn’t blurted out the first thought going through his mind.
“I realized that I was on the side that wouldn’t be winning,” Draco said.  “Wait, it was more than that.  I was on the side that shouldn’t win.  I knew that, and I wanted Harry to win.  I know my actions didn’t always reflect that.  But it was necessary to keep up appearances in order to stay alive. I couldn’t even trust my friends.  As you can all attest.”
Dean gave a small humorless laugh.  “See, that’s where we’re different.  I don’t see it as having to marry her.  I
Hermione and Harry sat, taken aback by the exchange. Harry looked about to see if anyone overheard Draco’s rather loud reaction.
“I think Lavender said she and Padma were going there.” Dean hesitated.  “Don’t you have your own room now?”
A handful of students who stayed behind for the break sat together at the Ravenclaw table. More than half of the professors remained and were seated at the High Table.
Millicent crossed her arms over her breasts.  “Sorry, you’re out of luck.  Better come up with another plan.”
“I hope Gin’s all right.  But I have a feeling you’ll be paying for those drinks,” Harry said.  “The Harpies are on fire.”
“Oh, that reminds me,” Narcissa said, casually taking a sip of tea.  “Draco, dear, would you mind terribly putting up a silencing spell tonight?”
“But what I meant was, that I believe this little one is going to command all of your attention.  There’s something about her.  She’s already spoiled, being in the room with Ms. Sabatino.”
Draco shrugged.  “I don’t know.  But I feel more aware of you now.  Sort of like peripheral vision, but with magic.”
“No, B, this isn’t what it looks like at all,” Harper sniffed, wiping furiously at his eyes.  “Please.  I love you.”
“I admitted no such thing.  I’m not even convinced he’s gay.  And he’s never propositioned me or done anything inappropriate.”
The tension sufficiently diffused, the three of them made their way further into the home.  Narcissa showed them the newly reappointed sitting room, dining room and the glass enclosed solarium, which left Harry in awe. He mentioned that it would be the perfect place to enjoy morning tea.  Narcissa said she would tell Poppy to serve breakfast in the solarium in the morning.
Even bawling, Harry thought Rose was perfect. He shifted her up so her head rested on his shoulder, and her crying temporarily abated.
Draco shrugged. “I suppose, in light of recent experiences, material goods no longer hold the same appeal.” He looked at Harry, momentarily forgetting the couple sitting across from them and slipping his hand over Harry’s. “I’ll keep the library though.”
“Oh,” Harry said again, relieved that it wasn’t an all out rejection.  He looked expectantly at the other man for an explanation.
“God, I wish I hadn’t been so impatient this morning.”  He eyed Harry up and down.  “I really like to fuck in the shower.”
Harry sighed heavily.  “I plan on getting there early and setting up.  Just so there’s no confusion.”  Harry suddenly felt like a girl getting lectured on giving in to pressure from a boyfriend.
One last search, for food, left Harry empty handed as well. He surmised Greyback had been hiding there long enough to exhaust the food supply.
“Draco is so naturally thin, I’ve gotten into the habit of eating less so I’m not a big blob next to him.”
He excused himself and quickly made his way to intercept the boy.  Draco was too late, though, and by the time he got there, Casper was knelt down in front of Penelope Pipshaw.  The girl’s eyes were large as saucers as Casper stuttered out his request.
Harry laughed.  “Is that what you’re worried about?  I thought maybe you were resentful of me because you have to spend all your time with Scorpius and Lily, and I get a break from them.  After all, I’m only holding study sessions.  It’s not as though I’m teaching anything new.  And proctoring a few N.E.W.T.s and O.W.L.s is hardly work.”
All eyes seemed to be on Harry, and he could feel himself blush, almost to the point of breaking out in sweat.  Harry did the only thing he could think of.  He put his head down on the table, covered it with his arms and tried to will himself to die.
“McGonagall has many of the wands that were left by . . . um, those that didn’t make it through the war,” Draco told Harry.  “I don’t suppose you’d want a Death Eater’s wand, but there may be something usable. At least temporarily.”
“Fine, yes I saw her.  But that doesn’t mean she’s the children’s mother.”  Harry stuck his tongue out at the book.
Knowing Harper was homosexual, Parvati had no problem undressing in front of him.  She removed her shirt and wrapped the towel as instructed.
“Anyway, I bought mine in Knockturn Alley,” he said, referring back to Draco’s original forgotten question.  “There’s a shop there that sells all sorts of fun stuff.  I conjured it one time, but it disappeared at a very inopportune moment.” Blaise shuddered at the memory.
us.  It’s like the elephant in the room.”  He knew Hermione would understand his reference, being raised in the muggle world.
As Draco made his way back to Slytherin, his grin slowly faded.  He thought about the things Professor McGonagall had said.  The one that kept gnawing at him was,
Draco smirked as he and Harry walked past an incensed Boot. “Looks as though you’re alone in your convictions,” he snickered.
“Sounds like trading one Death Eater for another is all it is.”  Knox picked up his pumpkin juice and took a sip.
“Minerva, any chance that Draco and I can beg off chaperoning this year, since we did it last year?  It is Valentine’s Day, after all.”
By eight o’clock the following morning, the wand charm had been lifted and students began making their way back to their own dormitories.
“Not much, to Theo’s disappointment,” she laughed.  “We all played exploding snap.  Although, Theo tried his best to turn it into strip exploding snap,” she laughed again.  Anthony joined her. “What about you?”
“Here,” Harry said holding a noodle between a pair of chopsticks.  “Try it.”  He dangled it in front of Draco’s mouth.
“More like ground against me,” Draco laughed.  “You were completely pissed.  It was all very sloppy.”
of us.  Draco, let’s move into the Manor.”  He turned to the Apothecary.  “I’m sorry, Master Orlov.  I didn’t intend to waste your time.”
“As I explained before, name calling is hardly a punishable offense.  If it were, you would have spent your entire career at Hogwarts in detention.”
As they left the shop, Hermione made a suggestion. “I’ve been thinking about what you said earlier, about getting to know one another better.  Perhaps we should all go to Hogsmeade or gather in one of our common rooms.”
“I guess it wouldn’t make sense for us to stay together, as a couple.  You deserve someone who will make you happy.  We should break up so you can find him.”
Draco stepped over the threshold first, eliciting the faintest of smiles on Lucius’ face.  Then Harry.
“Um.” She wasn’t sure how to answer.  She had been, but not for the reason he probably thought.  Seamus had chosen her wand at the third party.  She refused to do everything he requested of her, and so she broke out in boils for the following week.  Feeling embarrassed and ugly, Tracey didn’t want anyone to see her, but especially Anthony.
had been Michael’s trigger word all week and by Friday afternoon, he’d had enough boners to last a lifetime.
He stood, holding out his hand for Harry to take. Wordlessly, they strolled to the bed, beginning to undress as they did. They made love, simply, emotionally, and oblivious of the rest of the world.
“Fuck.  Yes.  I think that’s going to make me cum.” Harry submissively left his hand up over his head where Draco had put it.
“Well . . . I have always wanted a Christmas wedding,” she replied shyly.  For some reason she was embarrassed to admit she had been dreaming of her wedding day.  “There’s something about new fallen snow and all the beautiful lights.  It just makes a wedding more festive.”
Draco met up with Theo a little way down the defence hall and they fell instep with each other. “So, you seemed to have made a friend.” Theo said as they walked. “Yeah I apologized to her before we started and she forgave me and we came up with a really great idea for the project.” He said. “You apologized? You?” Theo said.  “Yes Theo, I was a major prick and I did awful things to her that were not justified and that I no longer believe in.” he said tersely. “Didn’t mean to strike a nerve there mate I just have never heard you apologize. So, she forgave you? Just like that?” “Yes, I’m still rather stunned actually.” Draco said. “I noticed you and Potter were getting along nicely during class.” Draco remarked giving Theo a cold glare. “What he’s an attractive man and we were just having a friendly conversation.” Theo said barely containing his smirk. “Just a friendly conversation as you were eyeing him up huh?” Draco said trying to hold on his patience. “I was just enjoying the view.” Theo responded now fully smirking at Draco in the most annoying way. At that moment Draco swung and Theo ducked and ran into the great hall cackling like mad man as he went. Draco dragged up his bag and marched into the great hall after his friend wondering why Theos flirting with Potter bothered him this much.
Harry had barely listened to the start of term feast; he was busy keeping an eye on Malfoy. He did notice that most people tended to keep their distance not out of fear but out of disgust. He sort of felt bad for Malfoy at least during the hard times in fifth year he had his friends to lean on but Malfoy didn’t seem to have to many friends. Harrys brain barely registered the end of the feast and his feet mindlessly carried him towards the front of the hall. McGonagall was telling them about the new accommodations for the eighth years. When he heard about having his own room, he was relieved that he didn’t have to disturb anyone with his nightmares that he still had every night. Lately he kept having the nightmare about fiendfyre and barely making it out he rarely woke up without being covered in a cold sweat thinking he could still hear the roar of the fire in his ears. “Nice of them to give us our own rooms!” Ron said while winking at Hermione. She rolled her eyes and started walking out of the great hall. “It will be nice to have a common room for just us; it will really help with studying for our N.E.W.T.S” Hermione mused. Ron just groaned beside her, “Really Ronald you would think a bit of studying would kill you” she said while shaking her head at him. He took her in his arms and gave her a squeeze chuckling. Harry just looked away and sped up to catch up with Neville at the front of the eighth-year horde. “How was your summer Neville?” Harry asked. “It was good, spent most of it up here helping professor sprout rebuild and replant the greenhouses.” He said. Harry had been invited to help rebuild Hogwarts and he had come for the first week but had found it to hard for him and had to leave. McGonagall of course had understood and told him to contact her if he wanted to come help again after some time off. “What do you think the rooms will look like?” Neville said. “I’m not sure I just assumed they would look like they did in Gryffindor tower” he said. They had come to the door of the common room and Neville reached out his hand and touched the door, once hit hand met the door it dissolved showing the entrance into the common room.
Despite his earlier feelings the class had gone smoothly and they had managed to brew a perfect potion. The rest of the day had passed rather uneventfully. As Draco walked down to the dungeons for his detention with Potter he felt a growing pit of unease in his stomach and by the time he reached the class it had turned to full on dread. He noticed, as he grabbed the door knob to the classroom, that his hands where shaking. He tried to pull on the mask of Malfoy determination with great effort and entered the class. “Ah Mr. Malfoy you are here! Mr. Potter is just in the store cupboard grabbing some ingredients for your potion. You may leave when your potion is complete and leave a vial of it on my desk before you leave. If you need my assistance, I will be down the hall in my office. Now get to it.” Slughorn gave him a pat on the shoulder as he left the classroom. Draco swallowed hard and put down his bag and went into the store cupboard to help Potter gather the ingredients.
What the hell had Malfoy been playing at? Why had he cornered him in the store cupboard like that? After he had left, he wondered to himself if Malfoy had caught him looking at his arse. Why had he been looking at his arse? He surely couldn’t fancy Malfoy. Sure, he was a decent looking bloke but Harry wasn’t really into that was he? He had fancied Ginny and Cho and they were both girls so he couldn’t be gay. Although he never really did anything with Cho except that one wet snog in the room of requirements, and while Ginny was beautiful and he should have wanted to do more than just snog her he could never bring himself to do more. He had found Cedric half decent looking but he really hadn’t given it a serious thought. A sudden cold and wet feeling wrenched him out of his thoughts he looked up to find Peeves cackling wildly above him clearly satisfied with having hit Harry directly with a water balloon. “Awe Potty is all wet” he screeched in between his cackling as he swooped away before Harry could do anything.
Draco waited until most of the other eighth years had gone to check out their rooms before he went to find his. He walked down the hall until he came to the very last door and looked up to find his name inscribed on a gold plate on the door. He glanced over to the door beside his and groaned when he saw the name on it “Harry Potter” was glinting at him from the golden plate. “Great” he muttered. It’s going to be harder to ignore him when I have to live right beside him all year he thought. He slowly turned the knob to his door a little nervous about how the room would respond to him. Would it look like his room at the Manor or would it be like his room in the dungeons? He took an apprehensive step forward the room started changing colours, the bed spread was like the one at the Manor a nice green silk with silver trim, a green silk pillow case with silver stitching, his curtains were like the ones he was used to in his Slytherin dorm their green and silver matching his bed. The chair in his room has turned into his favourite one from the Slytherin common room. I was black leather and slightly oversized a perfect size to curl up with one of his favourite books and read comfortably for hours. He went to check out the bathroom and was pleasantly surprised to find a tub instead of just a stand shower he was also glad that he didn’t have to share it with anyone so no one would know the ridiculous amount of time it took to do his hair in the morning.
year potion even you shouldn’t be able to fuck it up that bad” Malfoy went on. Harry started stirring the potion while adding the measured powdered unicorn horn “Bloody hell Potter stir clockwise 4 time not counter clockwise are you trying to make it explode?” Malfoy sneered at him. Harry glared at him and corrected his stirring but forgot to add the powdered porcupine quills so now their potion wasn’t the light turquoise blue but instead a deep navy. “for the love of the gods Potter move over!” Malfoy said while shoving him to the side while adding the powdered porcupine quills and stirring clockwise twice and counter clockwise four times until their potion turned the light turquoise colour it was supposed to be. “you are a bloody menace in potions” he said while double checking that Harry had not screwed up their potion to much. “Shut up Malfoy” Harry growled feeling a pit of anger settle in his stomach. “What cant handle not being praise for being Perfect Potter?” “oh Saint Potter cant do anything wrong because he’s just so damn special” Malfoy went on sneering at him. Before Harry’s head had time to catch up with his body Harry had drawn his wand on Malfoy pointing it right at his heart. “MISTER POTTER! MISTER MALFOY!” Slughorns voice boomed across the room. “That will be detention for the both of you. You will report to this classroom at 7 sharp and will be cleaning out the store cupboards.” During the whole thing Harry had not noticed that Malfoy had also raised his wand at him as well. Harry put his wand back in his robe shame flaring in his stomach. He peaked a look over to Malfoy who looked like he had been hit by a bludger and turned to glare at him before emptying their potion into vials to be marked and exiting the room without even turning back to look at Harry.
Harry couldn’t help but remember noticing how much more weight Malfoy had lost when he appeared at his trial. His hair had grown a couple more inches and was just at chin length. It was limp and lanky and looked as though it hadn’t been washed in a while. Harry had surprised himself by wanting to testify on Malfoys behalf. Even though Malfoy had been a tremendous git in school he had no more choice in his part in the war than Harry had. Harry Had gone in and gave his testimony that Malfoy had only been a minor when he was forced to take the mark and did the things he did just to survive the maniacal dark wizard he was living in the same house with at the time. After his testimony he hadn’t stuck around to hear their verdict and since he refused to read the Daily Prophet anymore he hadn’t know the outcome of his trial he had hoped that he would get off easier than the proposed 10 years in Azkaban. “whether he has changed or not I don’t really wan to have to be stuck with him all year.” Harry said over Ron and Hermione’s bickering. Hermione looked at Harry sympathy written all over her face “We should be friendly to him, he’s probably lonely now most of his friends and family are gone now.” She said giving everyone her signature Hermione look. Everyone knew better than to argue with her so the compartment fell silent. Hermione turned back to the book she was reading and Neville and Ron started a game of exploding snaps breaking the silence that had fallen on their compartment. “Do you think you will still be housed in Gryffindor tower this year?” Ginny asked him. “I’m not sure...” Harry murmured. He had just assumed that they would be staying in their house dormitories and hadn’t really gave it much thought. Now that Ginny had brought it up he wondered where the eighth years would be housed, there had never been an eighth year in Hogwarts history, so this was all new territory for them and the school. The Train was starting to pull into Hogsmeade station when he noticed that it had started to rain. Great, he thought, just the way to start out the year.
Harry squelched the rest of the way to the common room. He found Ron and Hermione cuddled up on the sofa in front of the fire place, Hermione reading one of their textbooks, Ron looked up and let out a hearty laugh at the sight of him. “I see you didn’t manage to escape Peeves.” He said while trying to hold in more laughter. Harry glared at him and stomped to his room for a change of clothing. He came back in a clean and dry jumper and jeans and sat down in a chair across from the couple. “How was your detention with Malfoy?” Ron asked with a slight grimace. “It was fine.” Harry answered with a light scowl. “about as fine as it could be with Malfoy anyways.” Hermione looked up from her copy of
The sound of Lunas voice drew him out of his thoughts. “I saw Draco Malfoy on the platform he seemed a bit sad” she announced to the compartment with the same dreamy voice she always used. “Of course, he’s miserable! He’s a bloody Death Eater! He probably is just sulking cause daddy can’t protect him this year.” Said Ron. “RONALD!” Hermione shouted at him hitting him with the book she was holding. “What?! Do you really think believe he’s changed and not a slimy git like he always was?” Ron said while cradling the spot Hermione had hit. “I don’t think he is the same boy from school” Luna remarked “He was a lot more caring than the boy in school when they had me locked in his dungeon.” She said with the same airy tone she had been using earlier. Luna still managed to take them off guard with the way she would casually mention the war. Harry couldn’t help but remember how Malfoy had looked at the manor that night, face gaunt and skinny with his usually meticulously hair falling limp in his eyes, looking at him and turning around refusing the positively identify him to his aunt Bellatrix.
She beckoned them all to the front. Draco slowly got up and walked to the front with Theo making sure to put a good distance between him and the Golden Trio. McGonagall looked over them and then explained what would be different for them this year. “Since Hogwarts has never had an eighth year before we have had to make special accommodations for your year. The ten of you will have your own dormitory with a common room, it will be located on the third floor you will also have your own rooms. There is no password needed as the entrance will recognize your magical signature all you need to do is place your hand on it.” “You will be given special privileges since you are all of legal age now. You will not have a curfew and can visit Hogsmeade whenever you would like outside of class time. Drunkenness will not be tolerated in front of the younger years. I expect you all to set an example for this school in house unity, I know all of you come from different backgrounds but you should all work together to complete this year and your N.E.W.T.S” she gave them all a stern look. “now off you go to your dormitories. Pip Pip!”
As he padded into the bathroom and he turned on the steaming water he couldn’t help feeling the tension in his shoulders and back. He slipped out of his sweats and got under the streaming water he couldn’t help but think it would be nice to have someone to massage the knots in his back out from time to time. When he had thought that his cock seemed to spring to life like it had not forgotten about being ignored during defense. He took his weeping cock into his hand and soaped it up so that there wouldn’t be to much friction and started stroking. He tried to think about his usual go to fantasy but he just couldn’t form it completely.  Instead his addled mind slipped into thinking about how Theo had looked at him in defence class and he felt his cock twitch in his hand and he quickened the pace. He stroked himself from tip to base alternating between agonizingly slow and hot and fast. As he was thinking about Theo and nearing his climax Theo’s features began to shift. He kept stroking edging himself closer and closer to release. Panting with one had on the shower wall steading himself the picture fully turned into a man with platinum blonde hair standing and smirking at him. With a small yelp he spilled himself all over the wall and watched as the water washed away the remains of his orgasm. Trying not to think about how his fantasy had ended he finished his shower and got ready for bed. Once under the covers of his bed he started to wonder if he wasn’t completely straight, after all his go to wanking fantasy had failed to work this time and he had gotten such an intense response out of the fantasy with Theo. But why had Theo turned into Malfoy at the end and why had that sent him over the edge so fast. Malfoy was a good-looking bloke he guessed but he was always such a prick to him and there was no way he could even like Malfoy, after all they hated each other. Feeing unsettled he resolved to think more about what wanking to Theo could possibly mean in the morning when he wasn’t so bloody tired. With that momentarily resolved Harry drifted off into a fitful sleep with flashed of messy black hair and platinum blonde tangled together.
Harry noticed Malfoy leave the great hall with Theo. “Why do you keep watching Malfoy?” Ron said with a mouthful of eggs. “I am not.” He said glaring at Ron. “Sure you aren’t.” He scoffed and turned back to his plate. “you do tend to stare at him whenever you and him are in a room together Harry.” Hermione said looking at him with a slightly amused look. “Yeah its like you fancy him or something.” Ron chuckled. “I do not!” Harry practically half yelled to the entire hall. He could feel a blush creeping up his neck and didn’t know why it was happening which irritated him even more. “Calm down I was only joking mate.” Ron said looking suspiciously at him. Thankfully at that moment grabbed them by their collars and started to drag them out of the great hall telling them they were going to be late for their first defence lesson.
They were barely into the school year and he had already managed to insult Potter. So much for keeping your head down Draco thought to himself. He followed Theo into the great hall trying to ignore the glares and murmurs that followed him across the great hall. He and Theo sat down at the Slytherin table and everyone at the table seemed to shift down away from them. Draco understood the Malfoy name meant nothing anymore and that it was better for people not to be associated with it. He had no idea why Theo was still sitting with him, his family had stayed largely neutral in the war after leaving his notorious death eater father, Theodore Nott Sr, if anything Draco would drag down Theo and make it worse for him. “Earth to Draco!” Theo was looking at him with concern, “you need to get out of that head of yours mate.” “Theo why are you even associating with me? People will just think you are like me.” Draco said resigned. “Look Draco I am not going to let you go on a, woe is me I shouldn’t even be here, pity party so suck it up mate you are stuck with me.” Theo was glaring him down leaving little room for argument. Before Draco could respond Headmistress McGonagall called their attention to the front of the hall. “This year will be a little different from years past” She announced. “We have eighth years with us this year and we will be focusing less on house rivalry and more on house unity. We have all survived so much in these past years and its time to put our old rivalries behind us and start making new friendships and connections. Its time for us to come together as one instead of being divided into four separate houses. That is why this year we will be doing away with having everyone sit at house tables. Except for this feast and the end of year feast you will be encouraged to sit at other houses tables and make friends within the other houses. There will be no bullying tolerated towards any one and I expect everyone to treat everyone with respect.” She eyed down the hall finding no protest save for a few mumblings. “After the feast is finished, I ask that the eighth years stay behind for extra instruction for the new rules for their year. Now everyone enjoy the feast!” as she clapped her hands the tables began to fill with food. Draco wasn’t feeling very hungry used to not eating very much in the last to years. Theo began filling his plate with an assortment of foods and encouraged him to eat. Draco took a few bites but mostly just pushed his food around his plate. As the feast drew to a close McGonagall asked again for the eighth years to remain behind. Everyone started to file out of the great hall leaving only the ten of them behind.
“Oh, all right,” Harry said. “You didn’t really need to say goodbye yet.  We’ll see you in the morning, yeah?”
“You were too young to understand what was happening, and my health was precarious for quite a while.  I fell into a coma. My body began to shut down. I was lucky though.  One man died.”
“Well, you both look wonderful,” Hermione said. “Positively glowing. You must tell us all about Greece.”
“What?  But you have to.  A lot of those girls go hoping they’ll get your wand.”  She sniggered, “A couple of boys I’ll wager, as well. Please?  If you get me, I’ll take you someplace more comfortable.”
“What’s the big deal?  It’s not as if there’s no place to sleep in the common room.” Their voices raised as they argued.
Suddenly, Ron turned back to him.  “Okay, well, I guess flowers are out then.  But I still think chocolates will work. Everybody likes chocolates.  Right?”
Draco smiled to himself.  Things were starting to make a bit more sense to him.  Blaise had never expected his relationship with Harper to last beyond Hogwarts.  Then suddenly, there was the possibility of something real, a way for them to continue and flourish together.  And Harper had laid his heart on the line.  Draco knew Blaise well enough to predict his reaction– panic. Draco knew all too well, it was easier to shield oneself from potential pain than to take a risk and become vulnerable.
It was always Draco and Blaise.  They were always talking about Harry as if he were a mark they were scamming.  Draco’s behavior didn’t give Harry any real reason to be suspicious, but the dreams wouldn’t let up.  And Harry had learned that his dreams usually meant something.
Having just returned from the school wide trip to Hogsmeade, Harry picked up The Life and Times of Alfred Woolvington in an attempt to make some headway.  Hermione kept asking about it.  He had the feeling she wouldn’t let up until he was finished and gave his full evaluation of the tome.
“‘nough said, mate.  It’s between us,” Blaise promised.  “Now get the fuck out before Harper gets here,” he grinned, teasing.
“Yes.  As long as Harry and Dean’s magical frequencies are different enough, we should be able to rule one of them out.”
“They’re both fine,” the Healer assured her.  “The boy’s a bit on the small side.  But that’s to be expected for one so early.”
The house elf popped back into the room with fresh tea and more scones.  Sensing the tension, Poppy placed the tray on the table and quickly disappeared.
“I hope it’s not too short notice, considering you’ll be performing the best man duties.  It’s April the tenth.  Molly has been quickly sending out invitations and we’ve secured a Minister.”  She paused.  “What’s wrong?”
He watched Millicent as she ignored him.  His hand stealthily made its way to the front of his trousers, behind the leg he had propped up to block her view.  He had been randy ever since the wands had been chosen.  The curly haired boy wondered if he would be able to slyly wank while she sat so near him.  And if she did catch him, well, it would be her own fault for not wanking him when he asked her to.
Harry rolled Draco over onto to his belly. He ran his hands down the length of his body, caressing his pale, baby soft skin.  When he began to pull down the pants, Draco lifted his bottom to assist.  As the undergarment glided over the rise of his arse, Harry hardened with anticipation.
“Of course.” He slowly sat down.  “This isn’t going to be strange for you two, is it?” he asked, noticing the worrisome expressions on Ron and Hermione’s faces.
“I just did what I thought I owed him.  If he meant it, then at least he died thinking I felt the same.”
He took her hand and they walked down the stairs to the fourth floor. Hermione was pleased to see that not only were lost books replaced, but there was a new section of muggle books in the library.   There was a small plaque above the alcove that read Granger Library of Muggle History.  Hermione beamed.
Sunday morning, the sun streamed through the heavy window pane, waking Draco from a peaceful slumber.  He yawned and opened his eyes, already smiling in anticipation of seeing Harry’s face.  Harry was still sleeping, somewhat in shadow.
When Draco got close enough for Blaise to hear him, he yelled, “You can’t put me off forever!”  He grinned and headed down toward the castle entrance.
Ron narrowed his eyes.  “That’s why you should stay in the Auror department.  So people like him can’t walk around free as a bleeding bird.  I’ll never understand why you defended him in the first place.”
Pansy held her hand up at Harry’s face.  “Maybe you can’t admit it to yourself, but I can tell, just by the look on your face as I told that story, you feel
“Actually, the note was from Pansy.  And she wasn’t specific.  The note only said that she couldn’t get Draco to leave.”
Trying his best to keep the smile from his face at Hermione’s rhetorical question, Harry said, “I’m fine on my own, Mione.” Though he was thinking that he’d met the perfect person at Hogwarts.
“Draco, I don’t love Ginny.  I don’t want to be with Ginny.  I’m not going to have children with Ginny.  I’m probably not going to have children at all.”
“And you think you’re ready for that?”  Draco asked sincerely.  “Have you come out to anyone but Granger?”
Between kisses, Harry murmured his love for Draco. He kissed and sucked every part of him as he removed every piece of clothing save for the pick lace.
“Now you’re just making fun,” Hermione nudged him in the side. “May I?” She indicated that she wanted to put the black helmet on Harry.  He slumped his shoulders and allowed her to place it on his head.
Lucius stood and began pacing. “I wanted to put it behind us. And you never asked about the baby. I thought to leave well enough alone.”
“I only want you to be happy, Harry.  Perhaps, you and Draco can make new memories there.  Don’t turn it down on my account.”
Frowning, Draco answered, “I don’t know anything about a project.  I was trying to make you a calming draught.  You told me you’d been having trouble sleeping.  I wanted to get it finished so I could bring it to you last night.”
Rather than use his rough hands, Harry wrapped his lips around the pale pink tip in front of him, holding Draco’s gaze as he sucked and took the cock down his throat.  Draco closed his eyes and sighed heavily, entranced by Harry’s attention.
During Charms, Harry penned a note back to Draco telling him that Hermione was willing to try and convince Ginny to work with Blaise.  But first she was going to drop hints that she wanted to work with Ron.  It wouldn’t take much to persuade Ron.  Hermione was better at potion making than Harry.  And Hermione was much prettier.  Hopefully it would all fall into place and by the time the project was announced Harry and Draco would be sitting side by side.
Hermione continued.  “Just remember that the most costly method isn’t necessarily the best for you.”
Through the rest of the meal, conversation took many twists and turns, including Christmas break.  A good number of the professors had made excuses for not staying at Hogwarts over the week-long leave.  Most believed they had paid their dues in the past by supervising students over the holiday and thought the newest professors should take on that duty this year.
“That’s my cue to leave the dance floor,” Harry said.  “But you stay.  They want you to join in.” He gestured to a small group of Seventh Year Slytherins calling Draco over.
Unfortunately, Monday reared its ugly head and Draco had to rethink a plan to minimize exposure to Potter because they were potions partners. What was even worse is they had a one on one detention tonight with Slughorn and he was no looking forward to that. When Draco arrived to the potion’s classroom, he found that potter was already there and was taking out his stuff. Draco marched over and took the seat beside him and started pulling out the materials he would need for their potion that day. “Hullo” He heard from beside him and every muscle in his body automatically tensed. Was Potter trying to start a conversation with him? “Hello” Draco said in his best attempt to convey that he would not be conversing with him past that point. “I promise I’ll try not to make something to blow up today” Potter said with a light chuckle. “I should hope not” He said trying to out his usual sneer into his words. He snuck a quick look at Potter and his cheeks were flushed a light pink and he was looking down at his notes and fidgeting with his quill. Why was Potter acting so strange around him? It made him feel uneasy and he was now dreading the days potion class even more.
charm. It was only 6 am he still had a while before classes started and he doubted most of his dorm would be up for a little bit. He stumbled out of bed into his bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror. He was still skinny from his months on the run the previous year but he had gained some muscle and weight back thanks to Mrs. Weasley insisting he eat massive amounts of food each meal. He spent most of his days playing Quidditch in the orchard with Ron, Ginny and the twins, when they weren’t at their shop, and had gained some muscle from the hours of flying. He had a scar in the middle of his chest from where tom riddles locket had burned him and he had accumulated more little scars here and there over the years, of course he still had his lightning bolt scar and he still wasn’t used to it not hurting anymore. He hopped into the shower and just stood in the hot stream for as long as he could letting the nights nightmares wash down the drain. He was aware of his achingly hard member not wanting to be ignored, he took himself into his hand and started pumping.  As he was getting close there was a flash of platinum blonde crossed his thoughts and he spilled himself into the shower. After cleaning himself off he hopped out. “what the fuck was that” he muttered to himself. He toweled himself off and went back into his room and got his robes on for the day trying to forget what had happened in the shower. He left his room and headed towards the common room, it was almost completely empty except for someone with the same platinum blonde hair sitting in the window. Harry huffed, ignored him and stomped out the door without looking back, missing that a certain blonde watching him leave. When Harry arrived at the great hall for breakfast it was still relatively empty. He sat down at the end of the Gryffindor table and started pilling his plate with eggs, sausage and toast. A short while later Hermione joined him and poured herself a cup of tea, she was usually up early to start studying before the classes started for the day. “How was your night Harry?” she asked him after taking a sip of tea. “Same as usual” he replied. Her and Ron knew how bad the nightmare could get and knew he didn’t usually get much sleep. She nodded not saying much else until Ron arrived still a little blurry eyed not quite awake yet. He plunked down and started reaching for the food in front of him to fill his plate, while watching Ron shovel his breakfast into his mouth he caught a glimpse of blonde out of the corner of his eye and turned to stare at Malfoy walk in and sit down at the Slytherin table with Theo not far behind him. “He was up before anyone else this morning just sitting in the window in the common room” Harry said. “Not this again mate, can we have one year without a play by play of what Malfoy is doing?” Ron said with a mouthful of sausage. “Harry he probably has trouble sleeping like the rest of us” said Hermione while looking at Harry warily. “maybe” replied Harry. He turned his attention back to the blonde and glared at him. He knew Ron and Hermione had exchanged exasperated glances behind his back but he didn’t care. He was so wrapped up in his own thoughts that he started when he noticed that the blonde, he had been glaring, at had looked up and was looking at him with a thin arched eyebrow. Harry looked away blushing furiously shot out of his seat and with a short “see you later” to his friends left the great hall.
He stood up and cautiously approached the witch not knowing how her friends would react to him coming to her. As he approached, he saw that her and Weasley seemed to be in a heated discussion, he slowed his steps to give them more time before he got to her desk. As he arrived at her desk Weasley got up, red in the face, and told him that he “better not do anything to her” and stalked off to his assigned partner. “Hello.” He said tentatively as he took the seat Weasley had just vacated.  “Hello.” She said a small voice. “I want to apologize.” Draco said grabbing her attention. “I was wrong. My beliefs were wrong and they hurt you and so many others. I can’t apologize enough for all the harm I have caused you or that my family has caused you. I will spend the rest of my life trying to right the wrongs I have caused. I know this may seem like the wrong time to apologize but I wasn’t sure when I would get another chance to be one on one so I could apologize properly. I had a lot of time to think over the summer and I realized that everything I believed in was utter bullshit. I’m sorry for calling you that disgusting name and I’m sincerely sorry about what my deranged aunt did to you in the manor. I know an apology won’t heal the wounds but it’s a start and I want to start proving to everyone that I’m not my father and that I don’t carry his beliefs anymore. Again, I am sincerely sorry for everything.” He finished. She looked at him for a moment, he felt like she was trying to look into his soul to see if he was telling the truth, and in that moment, he let all of his walls down so that she could see the sincerity in his words. She nodded and turned back to the page she was writing on before his sudden word vomit. After a moment she looked up and him “Thank you for apologizing, what your aunt did to me was not your fault but thank you for apologizing for it. I can see that you have tried to change this year even though you still like to rile Harry up.” At that mention of him trying to rile Potter up he felt a blush creep up his neck. “I forgive you Draco and I do truly think you are trying to be better.” Her honesty and willingness to forgive him threw him for a moment “You forgive me?” He whispered. “Yes, I don’t want to carry around hate anymore, I’ve had enough of that for a life time.” She said looking at him and giving him a small smile. “Thank you. Me either.” He said stunned at how quickly she forgave him. “Now, what do you thin would be a good idea for this project?” she said getting back to the task at hand. He sat for a minute thinking about how best he could give back to the magical world. After a couple of minutes, he turned to Hermione, “what about a program that helps Muggleborns and their parents when they first start showing signs of magic instead of the current system that waits until the child is 11?” He said bit worried about what she would think about such an idea coming from a former death eater. “That’s brilliant Draco!” She said and pulled out a fresh piece of parchment and started writing down ideas about how they could execute the idea. “I know that it was hard to get as caught up as I could in the month between getting my letter and actually coming to Hogwarts. It would have really helped me and my family if we had had more warning and time to get used to, and integrated into the magical community.” She said tapping the end of her quill against her lip. “we could start with a proposal to dedicate a department within the ministry to finding and incorporating muggleborn families into the community at the first signs of magic.” Draco said. “That’s a great idea! Kind of like magical social workers.” She said. “We could modify the trace charm so that it alerts the department when the first signs of magic appear in a muggleborn child and then they could send out a member of the department to go and speak to the family and start to slowly integrate them into wizarding society.” He said now that his brain had finally had a chance to catch up to hers.  They spent the rest of the period discussing the best ways to help families integrate with the wizarding world with the least amount of emotional damage. Once the bell rang Hermione started packing up, “This was really productive Draco. Your idea is absolutely brilliant!”  she said while walking to the door. Once at the door she met Weasley and Potter and they basically dragged her out of the room. “Bye Draco!” she said as she was whisked out of the classroom by her best friends.
When he got up that morning it felt as though he had been hit by a heard of stampeding hippogriffs. He grumbled as he found his glasses and got his robes on not even bothering to look in the mirror at the mess he knew his hair was. When he got down to the great hall for breakfast, he found Ron and Hermione and sat down. “You look terrible Mate.” Ron said looking at him from across the table. “Rough night.” He replied. Ron and Hermione knew he had nightmares but never asked him about them because they knew he would just avoid the question. “I wonder what defence will be like today.” Ron said changing the subject. The new teacher they didn’t know a Professor Melbourne, she was a muggleborn and spent most of the war in hiding and helping other muggleborns hide themselves and their families, that’s all they had heard about their new Professor. “We all basically know the whole curriculum.” Hermione said glancing up from her defense textbook. They finished the rest of their breakfast in silence all wondering what the new Professor had in store for them.
After lunch the rest of the day went by in a blur first having herbology and then a free period. When they finally got back to their common room after Hermione had made them go straight to the library after Herbology Ron was cranky from lack of food and Harry was exhausted from so much studying even though it was only the first week back. They unloaded their school bags in their rooms and went down for supper in the great hall. As Harry stepped out of the doorway, he ran head first into someone with a familiar head of platinum blonde hair. “Watch it Potter!” Malfoy sneered at him. “Shut up Malfoy.” Harry mumbled trying to walk past him. “Oh, that the best you can come up with.” Malfoy said smirking at him, as Harry past by him. Before Harry could respond Ron grabbed him by the elbow and dragged him down the hall. “Just ignore him Harry. I don’t understand why you get riled up so easily around him anyways. He’s a wanker.” Ron said as they entered the great hall. As they sat down Ron pulled the closest plate of food towards him and started piling it on his plate. “Honestly Ronald you are going to make yourself sick one day with how fast you eat.” Hermione said chastising him. Harry listened to the two of them bicker for the rest of the meal while trying to keep his thoughts off a certain blonde-haired boy.
Harry had woken up with a start at that point covered in a cold sweat with the roar of fiendfyre still in his ears and the smell of smoke still threatening to choke him. Harry fumbled for his wand and cast a
The rest of the day passed fairly uneventful compared to that morning’s potions lesson. Draco was pleased on how well his other classes were going and when he returned from the library that night, he was a little taken a back by how quiet the common room was having been used to the ambient noise of chatter in the Slytherin common room. He went straight to his room trying to draw the least amount of attention to himself, he still wasn’t completely comfortable around the others yet. When he entered his room, he dropped his bag down by his desk and started his nighttime routine. He was completely knackered from the day’s events. As he slid beneath the silky covers and started to dose images of wild black hair and piercing green eyes swam before his vision. In his groggy state he didn’t think much of it and drifted off into a deeper sleep filled with visions of the same wild black hair and green eyes of a stranger he knew he knew but couldn’t exactly nail down. Never being quite able to reach him enough for the rest of his features to focus. These dreams plagued him all night in a fitful sleep.
He vaguely wondered what the others rooms would look like, not that they would ever trust me enough to let me see, he thought to himself. With a sigh he went to start unpacking his trunk. Placing his last book on his bookshelf the door swung open with a bang making him jump. Theo burst in and gave a low whistle “wow fancy” he said while smirking at him. “What do you want Theo?” Draco said while rubbing his temples, today had been a long day and he just really wanted to go to bed. “I was just making sure you were getting settled okay and I wanted to see what your room looked like.” he said while looking around. “From the looks of it the room gives you what you consider home.” Theo said. “Interesting” Draco mused. Hogwarts had always been a second home and escape for him when things had gotten bad at the Manor it made sense that there was a mixture of both in his room. “If you are quite done gawking would you please leave? I wouldn’t mind taking a shower and going to bed” “I could join you in that shower if you’d like” Theo said while barely restraining the laugh that was threatening to bust out of his chest. Draco threw his pillow towards Theos face “Fuck off Nott” Theo burst into hearty laughter at that point practically falling over at the sight of Draco’s scandalized face. “Relax mate I may swing both ways but no offence but you aren’t my type. To prissy for me.” “OIY! I am not prissy! I just enjoy some luxury and actually care what my hair looks like.” Draco said with an indignant look to Theo and his messy dark brown hair. With a last chuckle in Draco’s direction Theo finally left his room. Draco sighed, Theo could be a pain in the arse but he was Draco’s only friend right now and he appreciated that he had come to check on him. With a groan he got up from his bed and grabbed his pajamas and headed to the bathroom to have shower before bed.
When he arrived in defense that morning, he tried his damnedest to not look at Potter or even acknowledge he was alive.  He didn’t know what this morning meant but he certainly was not going to dive into that mess. The best way to keep himself from thinking about it was to ignore the person he did not want to think about. As Potter entered the classroom almost late for the class, he tried his damn hardest to not look at him but his body seemed to think quite the opposite and his eyes followed him across the classroom.  What could be so great about Potter anyways? His hair was always a mess and didn’t even look like he tried to brush it, sure it looked messy in the I don’t care what it looks like but its still attractive way, but that was besides the point. His robes where always disheveled and his tie almost never properly done up, but it did make him look relaxed and more attractive that way. Did he think Potter was attractive? The realization felt like a punch to the gut. The rest of the class he refused to look at Potter. After defense was over Draco packed his books up and break neck speed and was the first one out of the class basically running to his next class, which thank merlin, Potter was not in.
His first class was double potions and when he arrived, he found that all the seats had been taken except the one beside Malfoy. He reluctantly took a seat beside Malfoy and started getting his books out for the class. Professor Slughorn entered the room puffing like he has just run from a stampeding hippogriff, he turned to the class and announced that they would be reviewing what they should have learned for the previous year “due to the interruption in several of your education we will start with the draught of peace. Who you are sitting beside will be your potions partner for the rest of term.” He said then started writing the instructions for the potion on the board. “Great” Harry muttered. “Contrary to your popular belief Potter, I am not to thrilled about being paired with you either” Malfoy interjected has he went to set up their cauldron.  Harry huffed at him and went to get the ingredients from the store closet. When he returned Malfoy was bent over his potions book studying the potion they were going to be making. Harry started to prep the ingredients they would be using for their potion “the valerian root should be sliced into thin equal slices, stop mangling it.” Malfoy said to him. “How have you survived this long without basic potions knowledge Potter” Malfoy scoffed. “shut it Malfoy” Harry said feeling irritation prickle his skin. “This is a 5
Draco joined him a minute later. He noticed Potter was bent over working on the lower shelves. He had a nice arse Draco noticed. What the fuck was that Draco started as the thought crossed his mind since when had he admired Potters arse? He moved around potter and started to clean the top shelves.  After a while Potter had slowly moved his way over, while cleaning, to Draco and his head was about waist height. “In a bit of a compromising situation there aren’t you Potter” Draco said trying to get a reaction out of him. Potter looked up and blushed furiously when he realized where his head was in relation to Draco’s body and quickly stood up, hitting his head on one of the shelves, on his way up. “Shit” he said rubbing the back of his head where he had hit it. Draco chuckled and turned back to what he was doing. A while later as he was finishing up his part of the cupboard out of the corner of his eye, he saw Potter looking at his arse. Draco took what he had in his hand and bent down and put it on a lower shelf angling his arse towards Potter and chuckled to himself when he saw Potter turn red and quickly look away. As he straightened, he took a jar of pickled pigs feet from the shelf he was working on and crossed the small space so that he was right behind potter and reached over him, using their height difference to his advantage, and closed Potter in putting the jar on the top shelf right about Potter. “What the hell Malfoy!” Potter exclaimed and Draco had to bite back a smile “what Potter just doing what we were told to do” he said arching his eyebrow at Potter. Potter blushed and glared at Draco and then took his things and left the store room and classroom. Draco was chuckling to himself before his brain had questioned why he had been flirting with Potter. Draco stopped chuckling and furrowed his brow; he had simply done it to get a rise out of Potter like he always did. He couldn’t have been flirting with Potter because that would mean he fancied Potter in someway and that was not possible. Draco bent down and picked up his book bag and made his way back to the common room trying hard to ignore his thoughts about the motives of his messing with Potter.
sorry for the erratic posting I've hit a bad writers block with the story and will bring you new chapters as soon as i write them. Thanks for reading!
When he woke up, he was on edge, having spent most of his night chasing the man with wild black hair and piercing green eyes through his dreams. He couldn’t figure out who they belonged to and that was just adding to his frustration from the day before. He had also woken up with his cock so hard that it hurt. He drew back the covers and they drifted over his achingly hard member eliciting a moan from him. He stuffed his hand down his pajama bottoms and firmly gripped his weeping cock. Starting with slow strokes he began to move his hand up and down his cock. Rubbing a thumb over the slit and spreading generous amounts of precum all down himself he began to pump faster thrusting his hips up as be brought his hand down. He was starting to sweat and all he could see behind his lids was that man with those gorgeous green eyes. He imagined him from his dreams that night and sped up his stroking as he was teetering right on the edge of his orgasm more details came to focus such as a lightning bolt scar on his forehead. Draco let out a strangled cry as he spilled himself all over his hand and into his pajama bottoms. What the hell had that been? Had he just wanked to the image of Potter? He cast a quick cleaning charm on his bottoms and himself and headed into his shower even more frustrated than he had woken up.
to brighten the room to get his baring’s. He was still in his room at Hogwarts and no signs of fire around him. He let out a breath he didn’t know he had been holding. He grabbed his glasses off his nightstand and shoved them on his face while he swung himself out of bed and padded to the bathroom. He took a cool shower to wash off the sweat and grabbed new pajamas and headed back to bed. He was exhausted and when his head hit the pillow, he fell into another fit full sleep with flashes of platinum blonde hair running across his unconscious mind.
A click made him look up and stop reliving the events of the last few months. He looked up to find Theo smiling shyly at him. He hadn’t seen Theo since before the battle of Hogwarts but he had received several letters from him while in Azkaban, one of his only friends that had bothered to after the war. He slid over to let Theo into the compartment. Theo had grown into his looks he wasn’t as lanky as he was during sixth year, he had grown about half a foot and filled out with much more muscle than he had then. He noticed Theo looking at him expectantly and he realized he must have said something. “What?” said Draco. “Well if you were listening to me you would have know I have found out something very interesting.” Theo said while giving Draco a sly smile. “Out with-it Nott I don’t want to spend the whole ride to Hogwarts with you basically jumping up and down in your seat trying to hold it back.” Draco said lamely. “Well I think you would be interested to know who else will be eighth years this year and I happen to know”, “well just say tell me then” Draco said starting to get irritated. “Hermione Granger, but that’s no shock there. I would be more shocked if she hadn’t come”, “Susan Bones, she’s a Hufflepuff” Theo clarified when Draco gave him a blank expression. “Neville Longbottom, Parvati Patil, Daphne Greengrass, Hannah Abbott, Ron Weasely though I expect he is just following Hermione, and Harry Potter” Draco’s head snapped to look at Theo like he had just sent a stinging hex to his heart. Of course, Saint Potter would come back. Couldn’t he just get a year away from Potter and all his glory. Theo had a smug smile on his face obviously having got the reaction he had wanted out of Draco. Draco glared at him and turned back to the window. This was going to be a long year of trying to avoid Potter and his merry gang. His probation just got a whole lot harder.
That night Harry tossed and turned with his usual nightmares but this time they were a little different.  The fiendfyre had been right on his tail and he could still smell the smoke threatening to suffocate him. He found the brooms and hopped on racing for his life to get out of there when a patch of blonde hair had caught his attention and his screams filled the air. He turned around and made a bee-line for that blonde hair. Grabbing him and swinging his onto his broom he felt his terrified grip tighten around his waist. “can’t you go faster Potter?” he had heard his terrified voice in his ear over the roar of the fire. At that moment he could feel the heat licking at his heels and suddenly Malfoy was sliding off the broom. “POTTER!” he could hear his terrified screams and he slide farther and father down the broom. Harry reached a hand back to try to pull him back but at that moment Malfoy lost his grip and fell off the back of the broom and into the raging fire bellow.
How had Potter landed him in detention again? Couldn’t the git just drop the class if he was this awful at it? Draco was fuming by the time he joined Theo at the Slytherin table. “What’s up with you?” Theo said looking at him with a sly smile. “Fucking Potter landed me in detention for the second week in a row because the lunatic just loves blowing up our potions.” Draco grumbled as he plopped down beside him pulling a plate of pot pies closer to him. Theo chuckled at Draco earning a glare from the latter. “Yes, I saw the rather impressive explosion across the classroom.” Theo said. “The idiot couldn’t brew a proper potion even if his life depended on it! I have no idea why he is even taking the class if he is so shit at it. You would think he would have the common sense to at least drop it and get out of my damn hair.” Draco said glaring at his lunch. “He seems to get nervous around you.” Theo said not even giving him a glance. Draco’s head snapped up at Theos words. “Why the hell would he get nervous around me?” Draco asked him. “Well maybe he thinks you are a good-looking bloke.” Theo said smiling at him with mischievous smile. Draco snorted into his pot pie, “yeah right. He’s not even gay Theo.” He said. “I wouldn’t be so sure.” Theo said looking at Draco with that same damn smile. “He’s with the she weasel so I highly doubt it.” Draco said. “Actually, rumour has it they broke up over the summer.” Theo was looking at him an increasingly devilish smile. Draco’s heart gave a little flutter at the new news which confused him, why his heart would do such a thing about the benign news as potters love life woes. Theo was watching him like a cat would stalk their prey. Draco steeled himself and looked Theo in the eye putting on his signature Malfoy mask of indifference before he told Theo “Why would I care what Potter does or doesn’t do with his love life. It doesn’t affect me in the slightest.” “sure it doesn’t mate.” Theo said with that stupid grin still on his face like he had finally caught his prey. Draco just huffed in response and went back to his lunch.
