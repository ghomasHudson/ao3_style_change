Draco can’t help the way his eyes roll, “What are you doing here?” he asks.
“Mhmm,” Harry mumbles, to himself knowing he would have to figure out a present to get Draco eventually.
“Thank you,” Draco says, looking over at Harry, “You’re pretty handsome yourself.”
“It’s not complex magic,” Ginny says, “I just had to
“Because you have a day job,” Draco says.
Harry looks back at Draco, “well,” he says pausing for a few long moments, “it doesn’t bother me,” he decides.
After five more minutes of dancing, Draco leans over, “I’m ready for that drink now,” he says into Blaise’s ear.
Harry frowns, “Later?”
to give you anything,” Draco says, watching Harry.
Draco sighs, “I know it sounds mad, but I left Gargoyle’s Hideout with Oliver, and we went to another pub and had firewhiskey.”
“Alright then,” Draco says.
know I’m attractive,” he says, “but
“You bit her,” Anthony says.
“Not like on purpose,” Harry says, “and it was really weird at first, almost like something you should look away from.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry says quickly, staring back at Draco, with Jamie draped over him, only half dressed.
Harry tries to make his smile genuine, “I would like that.”
Draco stares back at her, “The hell are you going on about?”
Draco steps out of the fireplace, he really needed a shower, he wanted a shower.
Cami smiles, “Morgana told me she was coming, and I couldn’t resist,” she says sitting down beside Draco, “So what do you say? A little drink for your birthday?” Cami smiles.
“Thank you,” Harry says nodding at the house-elf before she retreats. Harry helps himself to the tea, stirring in a spoonful of sugar.
“Yeah, don’t do that again,” he says.
Draco dresses quickly, before walking back into the living room.
(See the end of the chapter for
Lucius had no choice but to accept this as his wife would have certainly left him and he could not deal with anything like that, especially after Azkaban. And it wasn’t even that he hated that his son was gay, he just didn’t understand it. He still loved Draco, he just didn’t understand him.
A few moments later Zella enters the room, setting a tray down on the table.
Harry laughs, “Was that a vampire pun?”
“You were very drunk,” Harry says.
“Oh.”
“Yes,” Harry confirms, “You’re an asshole, who constantly tells me he hates me, and we used to be so violent to each other.”
Harry gets up looking back at Ginny, “I have to go now,” he says, “but you know where to find me,” he says before disapparating away.
“Oh, you don’t?” Harry says.
“The cravings, I’m sure you’ve probably noticed by now, considering how long it’s been,” she says.
“Yeah, it’s not pleasant to think about it like that, but there’s just something so satisfying about it warm.”
Blaise nods, sorting through the shirts, “Don’t worry you’ll look good when I’m done with you.”
Draco rolls his eyes, “Whatever.”
“No, please,” Jamie says, watching as Draco places his hand on his waist.
“Ginny,” Draco mutters, making a point to wipe Harry’s blood from the corner of his mouth with his thumb.
“In a way,” Draco says, not sure that was the right way to describe it exactly.
Harry is quiet as he lets that sink in, he doesn’t know what to say or do, he looks at Draco, “it’s not,” he stops.
“No,” Harry says stepping inside, shutting the door behind him, “It’s early even, the sun hasn’t quite gone down yet,” he says.
Harry can’t argue with that, it’s all he’s been thinking about for weeks now. Since Draco’s extremely drunken night at the club. It had taken everything in Harry not to look at Draco’s completely naked body that night, he decided to drunkenly strip down and climb into his bed. Merlin did Harry want that man, and here he was, so willing, so ready, and so hard.
Draco and Harry seem to be friends now. And sometimes something more.
A bit of kink negotiation, implied sexual content, a bit of vampire lore I've made up and based off of a combination of Harry Potter, the Vampire Academy series by Richelle Mead, and the True Blood/Sookie Stackhouse series/ The Southern Vampire Mysteries by Charlaine Harris, a tiny bit of a mischievous Ginny Weasley, and some Femslash but blink and you'll miss it.
Ron is quiet for an entire minute before he says, “But Malfoy is such a bully!”
“Okay,” Harry nods, that was a reasonable request, “And?”
“Yes,” Draco pants, thrusting his hips forward slightly, earning a loud moan from Harry.
The bond is created when the victim drinks the blood of the vampire, prior to the vampire draining the blood from their victim. Once the victim has been drained, and their lifeforce drained, the vampire either leaves the victim to rebirth on their own, or the vampire can create a bond. Whilst the human victim is dead, the vampire will feed their blood to the human, and be with them in the dark for twelve hours. The victim will be reborn from the blood of the vampire, and with the vampire in close proximity upon awakening, this process will bond the two vampires together for life.
“You never came back,” Blaise says quietly.
“What plans?” Harry asks.
him, he was always masking something underneath his outward interactions with Draco, which was most likely a deeply, deeply hidden attraction to something Draco had that Harry didn’t, a sense of self. Draco Malfoy knew exactly who he was, what he wanted when he wanted it, and why he wanted it. Which is why Harry
Harry smiles kissing Draco back, before pulling away a moment later, swimming back to the edge of the lake.
“The vampirism,” she says looking back at Draco.
Harry pulls down Draco’s trousers, as Draco’s hips lift up slightly, and Harry can’t stop staring at the prominent bulge in Draco’s pants. He isn’t sure what to expect, but he can sense the anticipation deep within his body radiating from his core, as his finger lingers at the waistband of Draco’s pants.
Narcissa stares back at Draco, looking absolutely shocked, “What?” she asks with a quiver in her voice.
Blaise nods, “You remember?” he asks.
Harry thinks for a moment, “It was probably a month ago, I went out with Ron and got very drunk,” he says, “I ended up hooking up with this guy in the loo.”
The doorbell rings, and Draco ‘s nerves tingle in excitement.
Much to his astonishment, Lucius had kept up his end of their deal, and paid for everything that Draco would need to remain comfortable, so long as their only son never came back home. Draco had no issues with this now, it was clear that he wasn’t going to suffer poverty due to his new condition, and he had less resentment for his parents, he still had no respect for his father, after what he did and after he kicked him out of their house, but he could live with this.
“Mister Malfoy,” Professor McGonagall says emerging from the adjoining hallway, “I understand that you are eighteen now, but please watch your language in front of the younger students.”
Harry looks back at Draco, “It’s not funny, I’m not trying to make a joke,” he insists.
It’s three days later that Draco finds himself pacing around his living room, impatiently waiting for the green fire to signal the arrival of his guest, at his newly connected Floo fireplace.
“I’m your best mate,” Ron states simply.
“Okay,” Draco says, watching Camilla move to sit on his lap, and he instinctually lets his hand rest on her knee, as he uses his other hand to brush her long hair away from her neck.
“I want to share a lifeforce,” Harry says.
Harry smiles, taking the glass from Draco, replacing it with a full glass of mead.
“What’s wrong?” Draco asks after a moment, getting up from his seat setting the book down on the table next to him.
that you love someone,” Harry says, “and you don’t have to run from that feeling, because I feel it too Draco,” he says looking back at Draco.
Draco smiles, watching Harry step into the fireplace, watching Harry disappear into the green fire, before he gets up, going to his own bed.
“What are you doing, Harry?” Draco pants.
Draco’s back arches as his eyes slip shut, a quiet whimper escaping his lips, as Harry continues sucking, savoring every second Draco was inside him in any capacity. Draco reaches down, his fingers tangling into Harry’s hair, as Draco lifts his hips slightly, pushing further into Harry’s mouth.
“You didn’t have to,” Harry says, turning the water off as it reaches near the top of the tub, “C’mon,” he says beckoning Draco over.
“Easy mate,” Neil says quietly, “You’re nearing the point of no return.”
“You work for what you want,” Draco says looking back at Harry, “and I’m putting in work here.”
Harry smiles feeling strong enough to sit up on his own, he sits up in Draco’s lap, pulling his hand into his lap as he gently slides a ring with a tiny diamond on it, onto Draco’s finger.
“It’s rude to drop by uninvited,” Draco says turning the page in his magazine.
Harry shrugs, “you also saved my life,” he says, “we had differences, but I don’t think any of those are relevant at this point in our lives,” Harry says looking at Draco.
“You’re scared to even feel it, let alone say it,” he murmurs.
Harry nods, “Alright, big party, but not too big.”
“Harry!” Hermione says trying to get his attention.
Draco rolls his eyes, “What happens when I’m intoxicated, hardly counts,” Draco knows Harry is talking about the one time he went out with Blaise and Tracey to a gay club, and they ran into Harry with Ginny and Hermione. Draco had six shots and made out with a handsome brunette wizard, and if he remembers correctly Potter and everyone else saw him pressing the very handsome wizard against the bar as he snogged him. And the hangover Draco woke up with the following day was the only confirmation of the fact that he’d done something embarrassing, and the fact that Blaise wouldn’t stop bringing up for four full days afterward.
Harry stares back at Draco, he is three hundred percent sure he misheard Draco, there was absolutely no way Draco had said what he thought he said, because Draco only ever said those words in his dreams, and Harry was pretty sure he wasn’t dreaming right now. He’s sure he’s standing in Draco’s flat, and that he’s awake and sober, and that he is one hundred percent hearing things.
“I thought I might have,” Draco pauses.
Draco checks himself into a hotel that night, figuring he would sort out where he was going to stay the following night. He still wasn’t used to this whole night time schedule yet. When Draco gets into his hotel room the first thing he does is empty his shoulder bag, taking out three pouches of blood, laying them on the desk in the room. Draco decided to grab a glass this time, that had gone over well earlier when he had his first bag.
Harry nods, “What are you doing tomorrow?” he asks curiously.
Harry smiles, “What was that?”
“What about you,” she says narrowing her eyes at Draco, “I just saw you bite Harry!”
“Draco may not be a saint by any means, but he makes me happy,” Harry says, “I’ve never felt more alive than when I’m with Draco,” he says looking back at Ginny, “Two years ago I would have never thought that I would be here telling you that I was in love with Draco Malfoy, but when I started working with him, he was just a completely different person, and he didn’t have any more of those prejudice ideologies, and he was seeing first hand how he used to treat people from the other side of the page and he didn’t like it, it was sort of refreshing to see him allow himself to be exposed in such a way.”
Harry smiles, looking back at Draco, “Together.”
“No,” Blaise says after a moment.
“Thought you might want to give it a try,” Neil says.
Cami smiles, leaning over pressing a gentle kiss to Draco’s cheek, “Happy Birthday,” she says when Harry sits down on Draco’s other side, before getting up walking over to sit beside his friend Morgana who was a beautiful dark skinned vampire, with a head of large long dark curls on her head, she was wearing a red dress tonight, and Cami leans over giving her a gentle kiss on the lips.
Harry nods, “Right, sorry,” he says frowning slightly, “I just- never mind,” he says looking back at Draco.
“Learn to follow directions Mister Malfoy,” she says simply, “we’re going to run a series of tests now, and then you can go back to sleep.”
This shocked Harry, he felt like someone had just poured a bucket of ice water over his head, his body went rigid, “You were hooking up with Oliver,” he says trying to keep his voice even.
“You were part of the reason I was upset,” Draco says glaring back at Harry.
Draco rolls his eyes, “Whatever, I’m still an asshole.”
“What?” Harry says snapping out of his thoughts.
“Soon?” Harry asks.
“Hmm, we’re getting there,” Draco decides.
Draco raises an eyebrow in curiosity, “watching me drink blood from another person won’t bother you?”
She nods, “I’ll send for your parents straight away, I’m just going to hang this for you, and then I’ll let you get back to sleep,” she says, hanging a bag of blood, and Draco watches curiously.
Draco smiles, “I’ll be there in a minute,” he says signaling it was time for Harry to go back into the other room.
Draco glares over at Blaise, before reaching for his dressing gown.
Harry chokes slightly when he pulls back, letting Draco’s cock slip out of his mouth.
“I beg your pardon,” Draco says looking back at Harry.
Draco reaches up, grabbing a fist full of Harry’s hair, pulling him down, kissing him hard on the mouth, it’s messy, and their teeth, accidentally hit against each other’s, Harry’s tongue licks lightly at the roof of Draco’s mouth, and Draco is moaning beneath Harry.
“What affliction?” he asks becoming irritated.
After being in his room for a few hours, Draco begins to feel that metallic taste fill his mouth again, he quickly grabs a blood bag from the desk before sitting down on the edge of the bed. He wasn’t actually sure how he was going to do this, but he really couldn’t stand to see the sight of himself with fangs right now, not after everything that happened tonight.
“It’s not like that Ron,” Harry insists, “You wouldn’t get it.”
Harry sighs, letting go of Draco’s hand, “Alright then,” he says deciding he couldn’t push the issue further because that would get him nowhere.
Draco shakes his head, he couldn’t wait, he needed blood now, “I’m too thirsty.”
“Oh,” Harry says, reaching for an orange slice from Draco’s plate of fruit.
Draco nods in agreement while reaching up and taking his earrings off, setting them onto the bedside table.
Draco watches Harry unbutton the lengths of his shirt, before shrugging it off. Draco wants to protest, and insist that he’s not thirsty, but Harry smelled so sweet, and Draco was thirsty.
“Oh yeah?” Harry grins, “is that an invitation?”
“We can’t,” Lucius says, “if anyone were to ever find out.”
Draco walks into the library looking around for an empty table, and he rolls his eyes because of course, everyone had decided that now was a good time to study. He walks between a row of books, and he sees Harry Potter sitting at a table by himself, and his first thought is to roll his eyes, but he doesn’t. Draco remembers what happened last year, and walks over to one of the empty seats, “Mind if I sit here Potter?” he asks pulling out the seat across from Harry, sitting down before Harry’s answer.
“It’s a power exchange thing,” he says quietly, “pleasing you, making sure you’re satisfied, being obedient, earning what I want,” he says looking at Draco.
Harry smiles, “You have,” he insists, “and you said no to Cami, and Izzie, and Myles.”
“Ronald would never let that happen, Harry,” she says, “You’re his best friend, he would die without you, Harry.”
Draco shrugs, “Mostly because he lied to me, but it was part of it.”
“Keep going,” Harry whispers softly, leaning limply against Draco’s body.
“Use your tongue to feel her pulse, it’ll be strong, and it should flow quickly, but you can slow the flow with some pressure, and you stop before her pulse gets too slow,” he says.
“I was trying to be romantic about it,” Harry says.
Harry stares back at Draco, he isn’t sure what to say, he hadn’t expected Draco to say any of that, he can’t help but feel a sting of sadness as Draco’s words sink into him.
“Where have you two been?” he asks.
Harry exhales deeply, looking at Draco, “So what you’re saying is that this is a serious relationship, and you want to continue this relationship.”
Draco nods, “I’m sorry,” he says, gently moving Jamie’s legs off of him, “two weeks, yeah?”
Draco sighs, “Who was there that night?” he asks.
Draco smiles, watching the very pretty girl in the purple dress walk up beside him at the bar, “Hi,” Draco smiles, looking over at her.
“Of course,” Harry nods, “I’m very sorry.”
A darkened figure emerges from what he assumed was the doorway, “It’s alright, I didn’t mean to scare you.”
Draco smiles, “Draco,” he says, taking him in fully. He had dark hair that was a mess, but Draco kind of liked it, he wasn’t nearly as tall as Draco, but he was pretty fit.
“He’s not a bully,” Harry says, “He’s not the same person he was when we were in school.”
“Sometimes,” he says, “it gives the illusion of drinking it from a person,”
“Nevermind,” Blaise says feeling like he’d rather not share, “Let’s go for butterbeers tomorrow after class,” he says, since the eighth-years were all of age, they were permitted out every weekend if they so wished, and tomorrow was Friday night.
“I like that you stay up all night with me, but this isn’t something that you can do all the time,” Draco says.
“It’s okay,” Neil says, “he thought he was draining too fast,” he says.
Draco rolls out of bed on a Friday, choosing himself a feeder from the catalog he kept in his bedroom. Draco had a bit of time before his feeder was supposed to arrive, he decides to check on his potions brewing in the study. He was sure his Alihotsy Draught would be ready today, and he needed it for an alchemy experiment he was testing. Draco smiles to himself seeing his potion had finished, he grabs a crystal vial, and empties the cauldron into the vial, he had brewed it flawlessly, he was actually quite proud of this one.
Harry looks back at Draco trying to figure out what he was talking about, “What does that mean?” Harry asks, “Why did you break up with Astoria? And why would it make you leave with Oliver, someone you barely know?” he asks.
Draco immediately felt stupid, of course, his mother would love him no matter what, why had his mind suddenly gone to the worst case scenario, he sniffles once before straightening up in her arms, “It’s not like that mother” he says letting her wipe his tears away, “I didn’t know, I hadn’t had any time figure any of that out with everything that’s gone on” he says.
Harry nods, “That’s exactly what I’m asking you,” he says.
Harry looks up at Draco waiting for Draco to leave the room, as he knew Draco so desperately wanted to. Harry knew that Draco wanted to be alone, so he could process his own feelings over what he has said, and Harry has learned that he absolutely must let Draco do that. Harry knows he has to let Draco be alone to process his feelings, and he wants Draco to do that.
“I can’t,” he says, “I’ll be late for dinner with Lori,” he says.
“What do you want to talk about?” Draco asks looking back at Harry.
Harry sighs, thinking he might just have to tell them, though he really didn’t want to, how could he just come out and say he was dating Draco Malfoy? The boy he despised all through school. The man he despised up until about six months ago when Draco had been attacked. It wasn’t the kind of thing people just understood and accepted right away.
“I uh- “Harry stammers as Draco is removing his cloak and pulling his sweater up over his head.
Draco looks back at Harry, “and you watch them feed?”
“Let me just put on some makeup,” Draco says.
Harry shakes his head, “They weren’t there,” he says, “I think they were already underground.”
Draco looks at Harry, completely ignoring the question, Harry damn well knew the answer to that, so Draco didn’t need to justify it with an answer, “what the hell are you supposed to be?” he asks, taking a moment to look at Harry’s costume.
“So, what?” he says.
Harry’s hands still, almost immediately, Draco had on a very simple, but very sexy, black lace bra, and Harry was stunned by how much the sight aroused him, “You don’t do anything part-way, do you?”
“Good,” Draco agrees.
“What’s that?” Harry asks.
“Hugging you,” Harry murmurs.
“Please Draco,” Narcissa says softly, “I don’t want anything else to happen to you.”
“What do you mean?” Harry asks Ron.
“I’d like to go back to sleep,” Draco says after a moment, “Can I see my parents later please?”
Over his last two weeks as a vampire, Draco had found he liked the negative blood types the best, he was almost positive his favorite was A negative, but AB negative was nearly tied for his favorite. He wasn’t the biggest fan of type O, but if it was around he wouldn’t make a fuss. He usually wouldn’t go for positive blood types, he didn’t like them nearly as much as the negative ones, but sometimes he had to settle. He preferred, AB positive, B positive, then A positive, and O positive as the last resort. He would almost rather wait for something else if O positive was his only option. It was so boring, and bland to him. He thought all of the positives had that sort of bland taste. But with the negative types, they just seemed much richer on his tongue, and he just wanted to truly enjoy the negative types, whereas he just wanted it to hurry up and be over with the positive types.
Draco settles on an A negative feeder since it happened to be one of the rare occasions one was available.
“Why does it bother you?” Draco asks.
Harry watches Draco for a long moment, they definitely had not talked about being officially in a relationship, and Harry kind of liked having the option to go out with Draco, or to go out and find a guy at the bar to hook up with.
“Why?” Draco asks.
“I want you,” Harry says in a low voice, his green eyes shining in the moonlight.
“He wasn’t, but the Death Eaters went to him when they needed something.”
Draco scoffs, “Don’t act so shocked that someone would actually want to go out with me,” Draco all but snarls.
“I drink blood all the time Potter,” Draco says.
“We have reason to believe that you may have gone there after leaving the pub,” he says looking at Draco.
“Is it?” Draco smirks.
Draco raises an eyebrow, “I thought you came with Luna,” he says looking around for Luna.
Draco closes the door to his room, pouring the rest of the half-full blood bag into his glass. Draco stands eyeing the glass full of blood, and he starts to wonder about what Harry said, about knowing his limits. Draco picks up the glass, taking a long sip, fully aware of the blood that flows out of the side of his mouth. Draco sets his glass down, wiping at the sides of his mouth, it’s at that very moment he starts to feel sad. Sad for himself. His father was right, he was a vampire now, he was half a wizard now, he was a disgrace to his family name. His parents were right to send him away, he wanted to be away from them, he wanted to be away from everyone. Draco looks down at the blood in the glass, picking it up before finishing the last of its contents.
“Want me to what?” Harry asks.
“Is this a strictly sexual thing?” Draco asks after a moment, “or is there more to it?”
Harry nods, “I think you’re right.”
Harry doesn’t respond to this, he can’t think of anything to say, he’s thoroughly distracted. Draco’s long blonde hair fell neatly over his chest, just above where his nipples sat, behind the lovely lace bra. Harry’s eyes traveled down Draco’s stomach, there was no visible muscle here, but Draco was as thin as Harry had always known him to be.
This chapter contains explicit sexual content. Just leaving that there.
Harry smiles, “Kiss?”
Draco watches Harry’s hand, as he lingers near his shoulder, “Are you trying to kiss me goodnight or something?” Draco asks.
Draco glances down, he could see the vein in her wrist, and he could hear her pulse from where he was standing, he traced her vein all the way through her arm, and he watches her pulse in her neck for a moment, and he did want to taste her.
“Why did you pretend to be in a relationship?” Draco asks curiously.
“I don’t want to tell you, Ginny,” Harry says, “I want this to work, for real this time,” he says, “I mean I think I do.”
Harry rolls his eyes, “Hermione I can finish that in two minutes considering,” he says, pushing the parchment to the corner of his desk, leaning back in his chair.
When Draco put it that way, Blaise could say that he might lower his standards for that, “fine,” he says, before taking Draco’s hand, spinning him around.
Luna smiles, “Of course, she’ll be doing a lot more dancing for me at home,” she grins.
Hermione sighs heavily, “you’re supposed to be writing your Defense Against the Dark Arts essay, instead you’re staring off into space.”
Harry frowns, “Oliver Rivers?” he asks, “I didn’t even know you were friends with Oliver.”
Draco shakes his head, “Tired,” he says, looking down at his watch, it was nearing five am, “I want to go to bed.”
“What?” Ginny asks Hermione was ruining all her fun.
Draco wipes the blood from the corner of his mouth, “Who is she?” Draco asks.
Harry looks up at Draco, “I’m sorry.”
“Mister Malfoy,” The matron scolds, when she comes back, using a spell to hang the bag back up.
“What are you talking about?” Draco asks.
“If you must know,” Draco says annoyed, “I’ve ordered a feeder,” he says.
“Okay, I’ll go get dressed,” Draco says, before walking to his bedroom.
Blaise looks over to his left at the girl Draco was gesturing to. She was tall and thin, she had gorgeous Olive skin color, and long dark hair, with what looked like pink streaks in it.
Draco stares back at Harry he had no idea what to even say to him right now.
“Want to dance?” she asks.
Draco settles back into his bed looking up at the ceiling, “I’m telling you, I don’t remember anything.”
Draco looks back at Harry, “Are you flirting with me?” he asks, “Is that what this is? Seduction?”
“Harry,” Ginny scoffs.
Harry’s brain is buzzing with anticipation, he has to remind himself to breathe as Draco pushes his finger inside his body.
“I think she does go by Andi,” Harry says.
“Circumstances change the course of our lives Ginny,” Harry says, “I love him,” he murmurs.
Ginny doesn’t say anything right away, “I still don’t think-“
“Of course, Master Malfoy,” she answers, appearing behind them.
“Move,” Blaise says a moment later, walking into the closet pushing Draco, who was only wearing his pants, out of the way.
Harry smiles, “as soon as you fell asleep, I went and slept on the sofa,” he says.
Draco had said he was thinking about breaking up with Astoria, but he hadn’t thought he told anyone he was actually going to do it, he wasn’t even sure he was going to do it.
“What are you doing Potter?” Draco asks.
“If you can’t hunt, what do you do?” Harry asks.
Over the next few weeks, Harry starts finding it harder and harder to stop thinking of Draco. He’s never talked to Draco, or anyone really, the way he had been talking to Draco lately. He starts to think if he could things might be easier.
“Help yourself,” Draco smiles, before watching her head off to get a drink.
“You sure?” Harry asks, “because I can stay and hang out.”
Harry’s breath hitches, as Draco begins to guide his cock into him, and Harry groans as he feels himself stretch around Draco.
“You need to sleep,” Draco says, hating the thought of his mother suffering because of him.
Harry sits on the edge of the bed, watching Draco take a drink of blood from the glass. He can’t help but notice the dribble that escapes Draco’s mouth.
“Very good,” Tilly mummers marking the chart, “And do you know what day it is?”
“You’re going to be there,” Draco says as casually as if he were deciding what sweater to wear for the day.
“Well you’re just saying things that vampires do now,” Harry interrupts.
Harry watches Draco he’s still utterly speechless, he’s not sure if he should be happy or sad right now.
Draco pulls his hand from his mother’s grasp, turning away from her.
“It’s a great party Neil,” Luna grins.
Ron looks as though he’d just been slapped in the face, “Malfoy? Draco Malfoy?!”
Draco steps into the bath, and he has to admit the hot water felt amazing, and he closes his eyes, “Potter I’m serious, we’re not bathing together,” he mumbles.
“Twice a month,” Draco says looking at Harry.
“I saw you earlier,” he says, “with that woman.”
Draco nods, feeling embarrassed, “It’s different,” he says.
“When I saw you, you were standing by the phones in the club, snogging some bloke, like your life depended on it,” he says.
Draco clears his throat after a moment, “So, Dannielle Carr yeah?”
Draco always sort of felt guilty when he drank from Harry, he never knew Harry was A negative until the first time he drank from him, Draco was so delighted he didn’t want to stop, and he almost didn’t. Draco hadn’t told Harry why he refused to drink from him for nearly a month after that and when Draco finally admitted to Harry that he didn’t
“No,” Blaise says turning around to scowl at Draco.
“I saw you,” Anthony says.
Draco thinks for a moment, “I think I’m good.”
Draco doesn’t bother cleaning himself up, he decided he’d take a shower, and just wash it off in there. Draco walks into the ensuite turning the light on, walking to the walk-in shower, turning it on. It’s this moment that Draco really sees himself. He’d been avoiding mirrors since he got out of the hospital, but he didn’t want to avoid the mirror anymore.  Draco stands in front of the mirror, he had two black eyes, his cheeks were sunken, and bruised, the bruises yellowing on his pale skin.
Ron sighs heavily sinking further into the sofa, “So Malfoy then?”
Draco wanders through to the living room, settling in on the sofa, with this week’s
“But this is your bed,” Draco says confused.
“You know what,” Harry says, “I don’t need to justify myself to you,” he says, “Draco loves me, and I love him and that’s really all that matters, because I’m not going to stop dating Draco because you don’t like him, that’s your own problem, and it has nothing to do with me, Draco is going to continue to be part of my life, whether or not you also continue to be part of my life, is up to you at this point,” he says.
“What about you then,” Harry murmurs.
“Later okay?” he says, “I need to finish this” he mumbles reaching for his quill, sliding his parchment back in front of him.
“Just go,” Draco snaps turning to face Harry, “I don’t want you here anymore.”
Harry rolls his eyes, “Yes, this is flirting.”
Draco nods, “It doesn’t help that vampires are hard to kill,” he says, “Sure the old stabbed through the heart thing works, but unless you get sick with Viitus or some other vampiric disease, you basically just live forever, I mean a thousand years is a long time,” Draco says.
Draco frowns, “Why? What happened?”
Draco thinks for a moment, sitting on the arm of the sofa, “I don’t have anything else planned, so I guess that’d be alright.
“You become weaker every day,” Draco says, “After one day you become hypersensitive to stimuli, you lose the ability to retract your fangs, your sense of smell increases, your pupils dilate, and you get what they call ‘hunter eyes,’”
“You’ve got a little dribble,” Harry says after a moment.
Draco looks over at Harry, “and your friends,” he says.
Harry looks back at Draco, “I spent my entire life fighting against the world,” he says softly, “I don’t want to spend the rest of my life fighting against myself.”
Draco sighs laying back down on the bed, noting that he’d already gone through a quarter of the blood bag, he wondered if this rate of blood consumption would slow down.
Draco’s breath hitches and he can’t help himself as he pulls slightly harder on Harry’s hair. Harry whimpers around him, as he takes his cock into his hand, stroking himself quickly.
Draco sighs, “yeah, alright.”
Harry looks at Draco, “do you have,” he pauses for a moment looking for the right word, “urges?”
Harry nods, “I wasn’t going to go back to Surrey,” he says.
“No,” Anthony says lamely.
“Pardon me, Minister, do you mind if I borrow my date?” That cheeky smile was going to cause Harry so much trouble.
Draco isn’t sure how long they were kissing for, but when he pulls away from her, he knows his lips are swollen.
Draco isn’t sure how long he’s slept for, but when he wakes up, he’s hyper-aware of another person in the room. He sits up quickly, his eyes adjusting to the darkness of the room, as he looks around the room. If he didn’t know himself, he would have thought that involuntary noise he made was some sort of a growl.
“Are you sure?” he asks.
“Can you tell me what we had a fight about?” Draco asks.
Draco shuts his book quickly, “nothing” he mumbles, “I’ve got to go.”
“I am so proud of you,” Narcissa says and she starts to cry again, “I am so sorry Draco” she whispers.
“So, do you think I’m sane enough to be on my own now?” Draco asks.
This makes Draco angry, “This isn’t a joke, and it’s not funny,” he snarls, “I broke up with Astoria because I’m gay, I was planning on coming out that night, and needed to tell her first, that’s why we were alone that night.”
“Thank you,” Harry says to Zella, before starting to eat his breakfast.
“There’s no wrong way to do it, just be firm with your bite,” Neil murmurs softly.
Toby stares back at Draco contemplating him for a moment.
“I’ll come,” Ginny says following after Harry, hoping to interrogate him further.
“Draco,” Harry starts before Draco interrupts him.
“I’m sorry,” he says, before licking the excess blood from his lips, “I’m gonna have to cut this one short today.”
Harry isn’t quite sure he would have used that analogy but, “I know, I’m sorry,” Harry says softly, “I didn’t mean to embarrass you, and I really wish I hadn’t told Ginny we were dating,” he says.
Ginny smiles, walking over to sit in the armchair, crossing her legs as she sips her tea, “So go on, tell us.”
on the coffee table, opening it up to an article in the front of the magazine, “Last month in France, they defanged a vampire who was caught draining humans,” he says handing the open magazine to Harry to read.
“So, just because you’re a vampire doesn’t mean you’re not normal,” Harry says, “It just means that your normal has changed, I don’t think you’ve done anything abnormal for a vampire, because that’s what you are now, a vampire, but that certainly doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you,” Harry says looking at Draco, “You’re still Draco, who you are as a person hasn’t changed.”
“Were you not watching me?” Draco asks.
Draco thinks back to the last thing he remembered, “I was talking to Blaise, he came to my house, said that I had to come out with them we were going to a pub, and then meeting some others.”
“I don’t want to continue seeing you under any capacity, goodnight and have a great life, without me in it.”
Harry smiles, “You’re welcome,” he says, leaning over kissing the side of Draco’s head, before leaving him to clean up.
That was what Draco was getting at, he needed a reason to stay angry with Harry right now, “It is relevant,” Draco says after a full minute of silence, “it’s why I went off with Oliver.”
Draco frowns, looking back at Harry, “You’ve grown to tolerate me,” Draco says after a moment, “You can’t like me, you barely know me, and I don’t even like me.”
“I haven’t,” Harry insists, “But maybe it wouldn’t be so bad,” he says, Draco was the one who wanted to keep things quiet, and he insisted it was for Harry’s sake. Something about sparing him the looks and whispers of being the boyfriend of a former Death Eater, and a vampire.
“So what?” Draco says starting to sound frantic.
“Great costume,” Anthony says returning a moment later, handing Draco a glass of firewhiskey.
“Merlin’s saggy left bollock, what the hell is it now?” Draco exclaims, walking through to the living room, “Potter? What the hell are you doing here?”
“I won’t be able to rest until you’re safe at home,” Narcissa says.
Draco thinks for a moment, “I guess they are, I hadn’t thought about it like that,” he says.
Harry smiles, “you’ve got a little,” he says gesturing at the corner of his mouth.
“She was immune to four diseases passed from human to vampire?” Harry asks.
“No, if it’s passed from vampire to vampire, it can’t attach to human cells and is only in the bloodstream until the magic clears it, and heals the bite,” Draco explains.
“Has nothing to do with the fact that I just needed a place to study, that wasn’t our common room or anything,” he says laughing.
Draco shakes his head, reaching for last month’s copy of
“I let you see
“Later,” Draco says, stepping backward again.
“I care about you, I want you to be happy, doing things that you clearly hate, even pretending you enjoy it a tiny bit, simply because I like it, are all ways of saying, and more importantly
“Vampire,” he mutters more to himself, but Harry nods.
Draco watches Harry curiously, waiting for him to continue.
“How well do you think Blaise and Hermione can get along to plan a wedding?” Draco asks.
“I’m not sure,” she answers honestly.
Harry looks at Draco for a long moment, letting the air settle between them, “What is normal?” Harry asks.
Astoria looks away for a moment, “You’ll have to sort that yourself.”
Sitting here at his table eating this icy sorbet Zella had made specially for him, Draco Malfoy was in absolute heaven. He never wanted this to end.
Harry rolls his eyes, “Proud Slytherin,” he mutters sliding down to the floor, keeping his keens close to his chest.
Draco walks back into the kitchen, pouring himself a glass of fermented AB negative, Harry had bought it for him as a birthday present, he hardly noticed Imogen and Blaise standing in the kitchen talking.
“Bad lover then,” Harry says.
Cami smile, “Thank you,” she says, “I didn’t realize I was your type,” she teases.
Jamie responds by brushing his hair away from his neck, and Draco bites firmly, pressing his fangs deeper until he finds Jamie’s vein. Jamie groans with slight discomfort, as Draco’s bottom fangs settle into his neck.
“Can I offer you my neck?” Draco looks up and smiles.
“She’s known to be very good friends with Daphne Greengrass, and she’s also been known to associate with vampires in the city,” Harry says drinking some more of his tea.
Harry nods, “Well, I,” he starts again, “I wouldn’t mind if you wanted to feed from me,” he says finally, pulling his knees up to his chest.
Harry smiles, “I didn’t realize you were into herbology.”
Harry smiles, “Goodnight Ginny,” he says, watching as Ron saunters over to him, plopping himself down onto the sofa beside Harry.
Harry smiles, “it won’t hurt every once and a while,” he says, “besides I’ve tomorrow off.”
Harry smiles setting down his glass, before unbuttoning his shirt.
“You may not want me here right now, but you need someone,” Harry mutters.
Harry laughs, and rolls his eyes, because of course Draco doesn’t, why he even asked he’s not sure, “Well it’s quite a lot.”
Ginny nods, “I asked her last week, and she said yes,” she says, “But don’t tell anyone, it’s supposed to be a surprise until our engagement party, we’re only telling Hermione, so she can help us plan everything.”
“I just wanna stay for a minute,” Harry mumbles, knowing that Draco would only tolerate a little bit of cuddling.
“Human,” Draco says.
Draco is pretty sure he knew what Harry meant, “No, I haven’t, I don’t think I’m ready for that, I think maybe mastering the completely not alive bag might need to come first, I mean I’ve been using glasses all my life, and those are suddenly a problem, I don’t think a human,” Draco says realizing for the first time, he can’t really consider himself a human anymore, “will be any easier.”
“No,” Draco says fiercely.
“First ten minutes as my boyfriend and you don’t even want to give me a little kiss,” Harry teases.
“Draco” Harry’s voice quivers, as Draco grabs onto him keeping him from fleeing like he so desperately wanted to.
Harry was put off by this question, this was his job he wasn’t going to stop doing his job just because he had personal issues with the victim, “Well it happened in my district, while I was on duty, therefore it’s my case.”
“After I came out, everyone was different, girls wanted to be my best friend, or wanted to turn me,” he says with a light laugh, “and guys suddenly thought I wanted to fuck them all.” He says, “the common room is really weird now, I try to avoid it as much as I can now, some seventh-years decided that anything I touched was suddenly contaminated and that they might ‘catch the gay’,” he says rolling his eyes, “You have to be ready for that stuff, and if you’re not then,” Draco looks over at Harry, “you fight yourself along the way, until eventually it breaks down and you can’t fight it anymore.”
“Something funny Potter?” Draco scowls.
“That’s not his fault,” Harry says, “He was attacked, and turned into a vampire against his will.”
“Mother,” he says looking over, seeing her standing in the doorway.
“Sorry,” Harry says again, “it’s just after everything last year,” he says shaking his head, “sometimes- “
“But this is great, I mean look at all the fun they’re having dancing,” he grins.
Draco rolls his eyes, “Of course I didn’t.”
“I was bored,” she says plainly, reaching over taking a sip of his butterbeer.
“You like it?” Harry asks.
Draco nods, he knew Ansel for reasons he’d rather not say aloud, “I’ve done business with him before,” he says, “A few times,” he says more honestly.
“It’s the best thing I’ve ever had in my entire life,” he says, filling his mouth as his eyes slip shut savoring the taste, “I could eat this every day and never complain.”
Harry scoffs, and rolls his eyes, his ears beginning to heat up.
“Just back off, will you,” he says.
“I’m sorry,” Harry says, and Draco feels like Harry really means that.
“He’s such an arse!” Ron says.
“That was not an invitation, Potter,” Draco spat.
“Hmm,” Draco murmurs watching Harry.
Harry stares with wide eyes, he hadn’t expected that he hadn’t expected to see Draco like that. He doesn’t want to be scared, but he watches the silver of Draco’s eyes begin to turn red, and he can’t help it, he’d never seen anything like it before and he wants to say he’s mostly fascinated, but he could see that Draco was scared, Draco was afraid of himself. Harry didn’t also need to be afraid of him.
Harry makes his way into the bedroom, trying his best to stay quiet so he doesn’t wake Draco. Harry gently closes the bedroom door behind him, as he begins to undress, wanting to crawl into bed beside Draco, who was fast asleep in bed right now, and Harry couldn’t help but admire how sweet he looked when he was asleep. Harry quickly pulls off his trousers, and unbuttons his shirt, leaving them in a pile on the floor as he strips down to his underwear, before pulling the sheets back on the bed, crawling into bed beside Draco.
Draco settles his cool body against Harry’s warm skin, sending a shiver down Harry’s spine, but Harry simply places his hand on Draco’s hip, letting himself relax. This is one of the rare occasions Draco allows anyone to see him in such a vulnerable state. Draco’s skin is so soft, cool, but soft, and his hair gently tickles Harry’s cheek, as he settles back down.
Harry can’t help it, as he moans softly, working his hand and fingers over Draco’s cock, he wanted it. He always felt like he was being spoiled when Draco allowed Harry to satisfy him sexually. The soft moans Draco would make, the way his body would react to every flick of Harry’s wrist, every swipe of his tongue, every delicate kiss Harry would strategically place simultaneously with every move of his own body.
Harry smiles, leaning in, kissing Draco’s lips, pulling him flush against his body, “shoes,” Harry mumbles, against Draco’s lips.
“Thank you,” Draco smiles.
“Your what?” Draco asks.
“Is it not Friday?” Draco asks after a moment.
Draco can feel Harry’s muscles squeezing tighter, he knows Harry is close, and Draco wants to get him there, and push him right over the ledge.
“Wait, what?” Draco asks confused.
Draco watches Harry’s expression change from one of confusion to one of curiosity, “We’re from two different worlds.”
Harry leans over pressing a gentle kiss to the back of Draco’s neck, “It’s me,” he says, “go back to sleep,” he says soothingly.
“Excuse me?” Draco stares dumbly at his father at the same time, Narcissa grabs onto Draco’s arm, in a grip that certainly should have hurt, but Draco couldn’t care less right now.
Draco sighs heavily, crossing his arms over his chest, “There’s nothing to talk about.”
Harry laughs, “and to think I thought the way to a guy’s heart was a compliment and some flowers.”
“It’s complicated,” Harry murmurs.
“I am responsible for myself, I don’t need you here,” Draco says harshly.
“I think,” Harry starts, before letting out a heavy sigh, “I think I’m gay.”
“Luna wants to do it three months from now, so maybe then you’ll bring your mystery man with you,” she says smiling.
“I didn’t ask for a hug,” Draco stated.
“Not quite yet,” Draco says softly.
“Now that you’re awake we can assess the severity of your condition,” she says, “do not touch that while I am gone,” Tilly says glaring down at him, “I’ll be back in a moment.”
Harry smiles, “you kept telling me to snuggle with you,” he says.
the blood flowing through Harry’s veins at this very moment. He could hear Harry’s pulse in his ears right now, and he wants him.
Draco looks over at Harry, “What is it?” he asks, wanting to take his hand back.
“See you later,” Draco says, showing Blaise out.
“Cami is a feeder,” Neil says after a moment.
Draco raises an eyebrow, he actually wasn’t feeling very tired anymore, he was actually feeling quite energized, “What kind of tests?”
“Yes Master Malfoy,” she says before going to slice some blood cake for Draco.
“So what?” Draco asks.
be Harry’s friend, that would be too difficult. And it was easier to hate him and continue to suppress his true feelings.
“No, I’m not fucking alright,” he snaps, “I’m exhausted, pretending to be alright with this, I’m not alright with any of this, it’s fucked up how fucked up my life is right now,” Draco says, “becoming a vampire has ruined my life, taken away my entire family, my friend, potential lovers. I just want to be fucking normal,” he says, “I want things to go back to the way they were, I want to see my family, I want to not scare potential boyfriends away by simply existing as what I am,” Draco sighs, “I just want to be normal.”
“I don’t want to be your friend,” Draco says, but Draco knows he can’t
Harry smiles, crawling into Draco’s lap, pressing a gentle kiss against Draco’s lips. Draco kisses Harry back, letting his hand rest on Harry’s waist. Harry gently rubs his cheek against Draco’s lips, and Draco begins to kiss down Harry’s neck.
Harry steps from the fireplace, walking into the kitchen, seeing Zella making some hot tea, “Good morning Zella,” he says pleasantly.
“Well I just sort of asked around, Astoria said you’d seen her only about an hour ago, and I just went from there,” he says shrugging.
Draco glares back at Harry for what feels like a full minute, before he sighs heavily and the tension in his forehead releases itself. Draco drops down to the floor, pressing the heels of his hands into the sockets of his eyes, pressing hard as if to manually close off his tear ducts, but he is unable to stop the four stray tears that slip down his cheeks.
“Just have a seat right there, and take your shirt off, if you don’t mind,” he says.
“I didn’t expect you to run through that last bag so quickly, when your thirst reaches a certain point, it just sort of happens on its own,” she explains, “but with time, and practice you’ll be able to control it on your own.”
“Are you alright?” Draco asks Harry’s frantic behavior was worrying him a little.
“I think they’re in the back,” he says, buttoning the blazer.
Draco puts on the vest, buttoning only the one button, and he looks at himself in the mirror and couldn’t deny that he did look really good. A moment later Blaise hands him a black blazer, and Draco puts this on as well.
Standing in front of the mirror, Draco traces the bruises over his chest and arms, letting his fingers trail over the bruises on his stomach, and down his thighs. Draco closes his eyes a minute later, pulling his pants down, leaving them on the floor before stepping into the shower. Draco stands under the water spray, letting the water run through his hair and down his body.
The number of people Harry had walking into his office asking him about the article, was driving him absolutely mad. It wasn’t something that he was going to deny anymore, the Prophet had somehow gotten a hold of it, so even if he were to deny it there would still be more than enough people who decided that it was gospel.
“No, it’s fine,” she insists, “You probably could have continued drinking if you needed to, I’ve learned how to slow my heart rate to allow for longer drinking periods.”
“What the fuck,” Draco says.
Draco looks up a few minutes later, making sure his eyes are dry before he dares looks Harry in the eye.
“When have you ever seen a vampire feed?” Draco asks rolling his eyes, sure Harry was fine with this until he was actually seeing it.
“Do you want me to do something else?” Harry asks, and Draco swears he could come just staring back at Harry’s swollen lips and knowing that he’d done that.
Harry smiles, “Alright, but you owe me a dance,” he says.
“The younger vampires tend to go through blood a bit quicker, so I’m gonna bring you another bag,” she says, before exiting the room.
“Out here,” Harry calls out, and Draco wanders into the living room, seeing Harry sitting on the sofa, holding a coffee. Harry had drawn all the blinds closed for him.
Harry’s not quiet, and Draco is sure that they’re not going to go unnoticed for much longer but fuck if he wasn’t going to have every inch of Harry by the time morning comes.
“Well,” Harry says taking some floo powder, “have a good night.”
Draco opens his mouth to speak, but Harry is quicker, “You don’t ever even have to say you love me if you don’t want, but acknowledge that you feel it, acknowledge that you fucking feel anything,” he says, “You don’t have to talk about any of your feelings if you don’t want, but acknowledge that you are feeling, let it exist in whatever form it is, if it makes you happy, or sad, or angry or even incredibly uncomfortable, let that exist and acknowledge the reasoning behind it,” Harry says, “I have to outwardly display my emotions and talk about my feelings sometimes, but you do not feel the need to do so, which is fine, but let yourself at least feel it,” Harry murmurs.
“Potter,” Draco says.
Harry wanted nothing more than to stay in tonight, but as he was Head of the Auror Department, he was required to attend the ministry sanctioned events they held every quarter. Harry had exactly one thing on his mind this evening, and that was returning home to his bed with his lover. The last few years had not gone how he’d expected to say the least. Harry, once free of the trials of being the chosen one, finally had time to examine the strange and extremely fucked up childhood that he had.
“This is stupid,” Blaise says after a moment.
Harry looks over at Draco, “I never said you weren’t my type,” he says, “I’ve always thought you were attractive, when you started growing your hair out, it took a little getting used to, seeing you like that.”
Draco sits down on the sofa, pulling his legs underneath his body, watching Harry sit down beside him. Draco picks up a copy of
Draco reaches over, pushing the shirt off Harry’s left shoulder, he could
Harry rolls his eyes, “there will be consequences if we do or if we don’t.”
“Well I don’t know what happened to me, so you might as well go,” Draco says.
“Because you’re making fun of me,” Harry says.
Blaise cocks an eyebrow at Draco, “I’m not trying to be weird, I’m just asking” he says looking back at Draco.
“You don’t like it?” Draco asks, not that he would get a haircut for Harry because he actually liked the extra length.
Harry nods, he still hadn’t decided what he was going to get Draco, “But what would you possibly get the spoiled vampire who literally has everything he could ever ask for?” Harry teases.
“Oh,” Draco says, looking back at Neil.
“Yes, Master Malfoy,” she answers appearing in front of him.
“He’s important to me,” Harry insists, “and I don’t spoil him.”
A minute later Blaise comes back with a pair of black boots, that Draco was sure he had never worn before, they had a thick sole, and they reminded him of some sort of hiking boot, but a bit fancier.
“You don’t like that I’ve always had things done for me,” Draco says.
“See you in the morning,” Draco mutters, turning the lamp out before closing the curtains around his own bed, slipping his wand underneath his pillow, as he settles into bed letting sleep overcome him.
Harry feels his throat dry up, he doesn’t know how to say what he wants to say, but looking back at Draco, he finds his voice to say, “I want to be your boyfriend.”
“You always feel better after you drink,” she insists, “and besides it’s your birthday.”
Blaise nods, taking Draco’s hand, leading him through the crowd of dancing people, back to the bar.
“Yeah, let’s not talk about it anymore,” he says looking back at Draco.
“I don’t remember seeing Andi or Lucas at the party,” Draco says trying to think back to last week.
Draco smiles, “How lovely,” he says, it’s that moment that Draco realizes he’s still in his pajamas, “Oh, I’m not dressed,” he says.
“You’re very fit,” Harry says, “now, are we done embarrassing me,” he says after a moment.
“Well that’s not normal, that’s just human,” Harry says, “What’s normal?”
“Ow,” Draco murmurs softly, reaching up to gently stroke the back of his head.
“By who?” he asks.
Harry smiles talking to Ron always made him feel better, “I was going to do some reading,” he says, “but I never actually got my book from the shelf,” he says.
Harry smiles, “It’s my job to find people.”
Harry ponders this for a moment, “I didn’t realize.”
“You know her husband?” Harry asks.
“Draco please,” Narcissa says, and her voice quivers.
“Draco-“ Harry starts before Draco raises his hand in protest.
Draco wants to scream, he wants Harry to go away, “I hate you,” he says again.
“I spoke to Danielle, and she was under the impression that you may have been with Andi that night,” Harry says, “It’s actually incredible how much they look alike,” he says more to himself, “anyways, Danielle told me that a few years ago Andi bit her, Andi wasn’t able to complete the process, but Danielle almost died, I looked into it, and Danielle was in hospital for a week.”
The tests hadn’t taken very long, Draco had received checks on just about every test she had performed, and Draco didn’t think that was a good thing, but seeing as she only hung one additional blood bag before leaving the room. Draco lays down on the bed, he’s not even sure he could go back to sleep now if he wanted to, his head was spinning as he tried to think about what happened to him. When Draco does decide to close his eyes, he’s out like a light.
“Nice little thing like me?” Draco asks probing.
When Draco lets go of Harry, he watches his face for a moment, he watches the sadness settle in Harry’s face, “I am sorry I hurt your feelings,” Draco says, “but I’m not sorry I said any of it.”
“This is a fucking nightmare.”
Draco opens the refrigerator, “a bit of both I suppose,” he says, taking out a blood bag, turning back to Harry, “Do you want something?”
“So, you’ll have more control if I’m closer to you,” she says, “It makes it easier for new vampires if you’re sitting in their lap, and it allows you to feel other pulse points.”
“Okay,” Harry says, “but you’re still happy.”
“Alright, let’s go,” he says.
“Oh nothing, but I think the Moondew tends to be happier when there’s Flitterbloom nearby, and I want the Moondew to be really nice next month, so I can make some Wiggenweld potion for one of my alchemy experiments,” he says.
Blaise sees her, dark hair, dyed with highlights, and she is very pretty, “alright,” he says, eyeing her full breasts in that dress.
Blaise does as he’s told, reminding himself to let loose. Draco smiles, tipping his head back slightly, “blonde?” he asks.
“Enjoy the rest of your night,” Neil grins. Watching Draco walking over to Anthony.
Harry smiles, “It’s a fun time if you really want to go one night.”
“It’s fine,” Draco insists.
Draco slides his hands into Harry’s hair, pulling slightly as Harry takes more into his mouth. Harry isn’t sure he can fit much more into his mouth but he swallows as much as he can, letting his tongue work around the head of his cock.
Draco stares back at Harry for a moment, and raises his eyebrow half a centimeter, watching him curiously.
One button at a time, Draco starts to undress taking off his shirt, opening his shirt Draco saw the bruises, yellow, red, grey, blue, that covered his body. Draco was one who loved his body, and to see it in this state upset him, and angered him. Someone had done this to him, made him look like this. Draco drops the shirt to the floor, before his eyes wander down his torso his flat abdomen, bruised. Draco unbuttons his trousers pulling the zipper down, letting his trousers pool at his feet. Giant, dark, bruises covered Draco’s legs, and Draco suddenly wished he had never looked in the mirror. He hated everything he saw.
“I get it,” Draco says interrupting, “no need to get sentimental,” he mutters.
“I’m not,” Draco insists.
She nods, hurrying to get Draco a second bowl.
Harry sighs, “I too had a date,” he says blushing profusely.
“And if I’m not,” Harry smiles.
“You are pathetic,” Draco says before his father can say anything else, “we are here because of you because you failed because you put our family in danger by siding with a homicidal failure, who was too scared to do his own damn bidding. You stepped up to take part in that, and you couldn’t hold your end of the bargain,” Draco says harshly, “That is why we are here, why we are a disgrace to the wizarding community because your precious leader wanted to punish you,” Draco says glaring at his father.
It takes every ounce of self-control Harry Potter possessed not to rip all the clothes off his boyfriend right then and there.  Draco was not only wearing a black lace bra, but he was wearing a matching black lace thong. This undergarment had little bits of lace around the waist, which next to Draco’s fair skin, made the color pop. Harry imagined a similar piece of lace was sat between Draco’s pert cheeks; he did have every intention of finding out if this was the case.
Harry rubs at his eyes, “I need to stop thinking about this.”
“How do I make them go away?” Draco asks frantically.
“Ah,” Draco yelps, quickly pulling his hand back. That’s when he notices the sliver of daylight, that has landed on the bedsheets, coming through the parted curtains. Draco looks down at his hand, it was reddened, and slightly blistered, where the sunlight met his skin. Draco, quickly scrambles to the other side of the bed, trying to stay out of the line of the sunlight.
Draco walks into the kitchen a minute later, “Potter.”
Harry is positive his face is as red as a tomato, and Draco can’t help but smile, “I-I- Uh,” Harry stammers.
“What’s wrong?” Draco asks walking up beside him.
Harry looks down at his exposed shoulder, glancing over at Draco who was looking at his neck with a sense of longing.
“Draco,” Harry says softly, gently knocking on the door, “are you up?” he asks opening the door.
“You’re thirsty,” Harry murmurs.
His left cheek was still bruised but just barely, he looks at his shirtless torso, the bruises on his body were almost gone, it made him happy to finally see his body start to look like himself again. Draco looks at himself in the mirror, he can feel the tingling in his mouth as he opens his mouth slightly to see his fangs. From what Draco knew about vampires, they could control whether they wanted to show or hide their fangs, and the fact that his fangs had been on pure instinct for him since he was turned, he started to wonder if this meant he was gaining control over his vampire senses. There was only one way to find out.
Draco lets Harry’s blood flow freely into his mouth, as Harry leans into Draco’s body, hoping that after Draco had fed, he would stop being so cranky.
“Alright,” Harry says looking back at Draco expectantly.
“I’m sorry Draco,” Harry says scrambling up to his feet, “I shouldn’t have kissed you like that.”
“You don’t have to explain Draco,” Harry says, “It’s really alright.”
“Harry,” she says softly, “Something is wrong, talk to me about it please?”
Draco nods, “Lucas, I’ve talked to him before, but we’re not like friends or anything.”
Draco gets up on Saturday evening, wandering into his bathroom to take a shower. Draco takes a quick shower, only half an hour. When Draco steps out of the shower, he stands in front of the mirror for a moment, the bruises on his face were mostly gone, for which he was glad, and the bruises on his body were slowly fading away. Draco gasps, as the audible click sounds in his ears, and his fangs appear. Draco was aware of how thirsty he was in that moment. He doesn’t move just yet instead, he takes this moment to inspect his fangs for the first time. He had four, he hadn’t expected to see four long fangs. Draco gently touches his bottom left fang and accidentally pierces his finger.
“Harry?” a gentle smile on those red lips, and Harry was so far gone, he doesn’t even remember if his name was Harry.
Harry watches Draco, he swears he can see real emotion in his eyes, “I don’t understand that, having someone else take that from you, but I do understand finally plucking up the courage to admit to yourself that your different, and that saying that out loud to other people might make them look at you differently, and that’s a scary thought,” Harry says looking back at Draco, who looked as if he was holding his breath as he listened to Harry talk, “I know what it’s like to be scared to come out, I’m gay too.”
Harry nods, “yeah, it’s not one of my prouder moments,” he says, “I was very drunk, but I remember he tasted like cinnamon.”
Draco looks at the glass in his hand, “I have one,” he says, taking a small sip of his drink.
Draco wraps his hand around his erect cock, and Harry instinctively lets his mouth open. Draco slides his cock into Harry’s mouth, and it takes every ounce of self-control he has in him, and at this current moment, that’s not much, not to fuck Harry’s pretty little mouth until he comes. There will be plenty of time for that, Draco tells himself.
Ten minutes later Draco looks down at his shirt, he had managed to spill a bit of blood on his shirt. He gets up, pulling off his shirt, “Wash this for me, Zella,” he says, talking to the elf who had busied herself in the kitchen.
Draco crosses his arms over his chest, “Did you come here to interrogate me about being a vampire?”
“You’re alright,” she says hurrying to her son’s bedside, “I was so scared.”
Harry raises an eyebrow staring back at Draco for a moment, “fine then,” he says, Draco Malfoy was never going to change, he couldn’t believe he thought Draco had changed, he couldn’t believe that he actually felt sorry for Draco Malfoy, he can’t believe he actually fucking liked Draco Malfoy, he just felt like a complete idiot. “Good luck with Oliver and whatever, I’m gonna go now.”
“But I want to dance with you,” Harry says, taking a step closer to Draco.
Draco also thinks that true, at the few parties he’d been to with vampires, they definitely weren’t shy about feeding in front of others.
Draco clears his throat, “That honor would go to me,” he says.
“Alright,” Harry mutters, watching Draco lean against the counter for a moment, before making his way to the toilet, shutting the door behind him.
Draco wracks his brain trying to remember this encounter.
“Draco?” Harry murmurs when Draco stops after just a few seconds, it wasn’t even long enough for Harry to begin to feel light-headed, “What’s wrong?” he asks.
“I feel plenty,” Draco says controlling his voice.
“We’re not stupid Harry,” Hermione says, “Why else would you be so secretive.”
Harry watches Draco looking for a hint of deceit, but he couldn’t find one, “you swear?” Harry asks.
“For the love of Merlin,” Draco says, “He wasn’t naked, and there was nothing sexual about it.”
Once again. Thank you so very much! <3
“I’m this because I was someone’s fucking prey!” he says.
“You don’t look anything like a banana,” Draco laughs.
Harry smiles, “No,” he says, “I asked him if he wanted to go for coffee, and he said he wasn’t sure and was all shy about it,” Harry says, “eventually he gave in, and let me take him out.”
Harry bites his lip, “You like it?”
After a moment Harry starts to move, picking his hips up moaning softly as he rides Draco’s cock. Draco sighs softly, guiding Harry’s hips down further causing Harry’s eyes to roll back slightly, as his body meets Draco’s. Harry moans, his cock twitching against his lower abdomen.
“Zella,” Draco calls out, “can you bring me a glass of blood?” he asks when she appears in front of him.
“It’s nothing,” Harry says wishing that he had just been paying attention to where he was going, “I need to go,” he says, walking away from Draco.
“I already knew that,” Draco says, eating some more biscuit.
Harry nods, “You are,” he agrees, “but not nearly as much as before.”
This chapter does contain sexual content, I don't personally think it's too explicit, but it is semi-explicit if that makes any sense. Well, let's just say there's explicit content just to be safe.
Harry frowns, “I think it is,” he says.
Draco looks at Harry, “People are going to say your boyfriend is an asshole,” Draco says.
“Do you have more?” he asks quickly, opening his eyes staring back at her.
Draco rolls his eyes, “Seriously Potter, you interrupt my meal, and can’t remember why,” he glares back at him.
“Why not?”
“I mean, I guess eventually you get used to it, yeah?” Harry asks.
Draco walks into the living room, “You’re early,” Draco says, “It’s Jamie, right?” he says trying to remember his name. Draco decided if he was going to start using feeders more often that he should at least try to remember their names.
Draco smiles, “yeah?”
“What does that mean?” Draco asks.
“I said you were never to speak of that again,” Draco hisses.
“There’s an extra toothbrush, in the cabinet,” he says.
Harry smiles, “That’s more like it,” he says softly.
I want to say thank you for sticking around with this story, those of you who've read this far, It means so much to me! And without further ado I present you with the conclusion of Vampie!Draco :)
Draco looks at Harry, “because I let you,” he says, “ask anyone else about me, and they’ll tell you I’m an asshole, but I let you see things about me, that I would never let other people see.”
“I wasn’t watching,” Harry says again.
Astoria shakes her head, “I’m not angry, I’m relieved if anything, but right now I need space.”
Harry rolls his eyes, “Draco, I have real work to be doing right now, I don’t have time for your bullshit.”
Harry frowns, “Is that why you moved out?”
“So, you made sure I broke up with her,” Draco says.
Draco rolls his eyes, “I can feel my teeth rotting.”
Draco looks up, wrapping his arms around his knees, “Potter?”
“I’m sure of it,” Harry says, “Have you seen Lucas or Andi lately?” he asks.
“Because he’s my boyfriend,” Harry says getting up to face her properly.
“I’ve told you what I want,” Draco murmurs, “No matter the reason I want it, I want it.”
Harry nods, “that’s fair,” he says, letting out a little yawn.
“Ah, yes,” Harry says getting back on track, “I think she may have been the one with you that night, and if not, she may know the vampire that you were with that night.”
Blaise nods, “they do,” he says, before handing Draco a dark teal V-neck tee.
Draco laughs, “you’ve got a deal.”
Harry looks up at Draco, with gentle eyes, and swollen lips and Draco has to refrain from kissing him. Harry looks as if he’s expecting Draco to say something, but Draco couldn’t imagine what else he would say to Harry at this moment.
“I care about both of you in different ways,” Harry says, “and I don’t drop everything for him, like you’re insinuating,” Harry says.
Harry can’t tell if Draco is serious or not, he wants to think he is serious. Ever since the Profit had posted a photo of him on his eighteenth birthday, getting a birthday kiss from Dean Thomas, things had been difficult for him. They had been drinking, and dancing, and having a good time, and Dean kissed him, and Harry kissed him back. He tries not to think about that fact that the Daily Profit basically ruined hands down the best birthday he’s ever had. Waking up hungover the following day to a photo of him kissing Dean on the front page with the headline, “The Boy-Who-Lived caught snogging boyfriend at birthday party.” Had just made him have to confront things he wasn’t ready for and honestly after finding out Draco was gay he wanted to ask him how he actually came to terms with it because Harry was having an inner struggle that sometimes got the better of him.
“Well some are more modest than others,” Draco says.
Harry smiles, “come here, you,” he smiles, letting his arms wrap around Draco’s waist.
Harry nods, “She’s friends with Neil, and thought we should meet.”
“Is this okay?” Draco pauses to ask, trying to wrack his brain for even a scrap of the control he so desperately needed to have.
“Are you having fun?” Harry asks, looking from Draco to Neil.
Draco was a bit taken aback by the use of his first name from Harry Potter, and it makes him stop thinking about the fact that he could hear Harry’s heartbeat from where he was standing.
“I can get you a glass if you’d like,” she says, “But this is just as effective.”
“How’s,” she pauses for a moment, “Oliver is it?” she asks.
“You know all vampires?” Harry asks raising an eyebrow.
Draco hadn’t expected any of those words to leave Harry’s mouth, he would have never expected Harry Potter to be into BDSM play.
“That part is sort of instinctual, you just sort of know,” Neil says, “but Cami is a professional, she’ll let you know if you’re getting too close.”
Luna smiles, “Thank you,” she says pleasantly, “you’re such a cute wolf,” she says admiring Anthony’s costume.
“How will I know when it’s too slow?” Draco asks.
Ginny stares back at Harry, she could see that this was something that bothered him, the fact that she had so much negativity toward Draco Malfoy, but Ginny just couldn’t help it, Draco was always so mean to her, and her family, and Harry for that matter, she was more willing to at least listen now, but she was still not on board for any of this.
“I keep forgetting it’s only been six months,” Harry says, “I feel like I’ve known this you for so long,” he says.
Harry blushes a shade of red, “No,” he says.
Draco laughs, “I’m not drunk yet,” he says.
Draco nods, “That’s how they say Luci Reinfield lived to be a thousand,” he says, “she was said to be a carrier for four human-borne vampiric diseases when she was turned by her lover in the fifth century.”
Draco looks at Harry for a long moment before he speaks again, “Potter,” he says his voice a little softer than Harry was used to.
Harry looks up at Draco, “you can’t tell me how I feel, I know how I feel, you know what you see.”
you need to be, because that’s not the Draco that I want to be with.”
“About me, behind my back,” Draco clarifies.
“What about the things they’re saying about you?” Harry says, “They’re saying some pretty nasty things.”
“Potter,” Draco smiles, “I’m not being cheeky about it.”
“No worries,” the handsome wizard says, “I’m Toby.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco lowers his pants, stepping out of them on the floor, and blonde hair is Harry’s first thought, beautiful blonde hair, that sat below Draco’s hip but absolutely nothing was going to distract Harry from what he truly wanted.
Harry looks over at Draco, before he leans over, wrapping his arms around Draco’s body.
“You don’t seem to like that,” Harry says more as a question rather than a statement of fact.
“Feeders,” Draco says, “If one vampire feeds from a human, and another vampire feeds before the bite heals itself, the illness can be passed.”
“You’re distracted,” Draco says plainly.
“I didn’t know you were coming, Cami,” he says staring back at her, he still thought she was stunningly beautiful.
“Yes,” Draco says.
“I’m not drunk yet,” he insists.
“What about mine then?” Harry says looking back at Draco.
Harry grins, “You mean the time on my bed when we-“
Harry gets up, offering Draco his hand, which Draco takes, allowing Harry to help him up, leading him right past Hermione, who was standing talking to Ron, and Blaise Zabini.
“Oh, Draco,” Harry moans loudly, unable to keep his voice down, “Draco!”
Harry nods in agreement, “I’m pretty tired too.”
Harry’s jaw drops, “What is it?” he asks, licking his lips slightly, finding his mouth suddenly as dry as the Sahara Desert.
“Well I don’t think it can get much worse, I’m already a sodding vampire,” Draco grumbles.
“There wasn’t anything sexual about it?” Harry says.
Harry looks back at Draco, for some reason feeling like he could tell him something he had been dreading admitting, “Ginny moved out.”
“What I see is a complete git,” Draco says, and Harry rolls his eyes, “why are you even trying to be nice to me? We’re not friends, we’re too different.”
“I didn’t even know she was at that party,” Draco says.
Draco spins around, pulling his hand from Anthony’s, “Don’t touch me,” he snarls with so much venom Anthony’s sure he’s going to have to suck the poison out of the bite Draco just took out of him.
Draco smiles, “Why don’t you go dance with Hermione,” he says, pulling away from Harry.
Draco smiles, “You’re barking mad,” Draco says laying back on the sofa, letting Harry rest against his chest.
“Really Draco?” Harry smiles, “You’re about modesty?”
“I’ve actually been working on an invisibility potion, and tomorrow will be time to add the Erumpent tail,” he says.
“So, we should be spending time with each other’s friends,” Draco says.
Draco smirks slightly, “So what did your date dress as?” he asks, wondering what crazy costume idea Luna had come up with.
Harry can say he honestly did not expect to find himself underneath Draco Malfoy tonight, not that he hadn’t thought about this many times before, but this is absolutely nothing like his fantasies, but he doesn’t have it in him to complain about that.
“Camilla,” Neil says softly, and a gorgeous red-haired girl stood up from her seat, smiling she walked over to Neil.
“Yes,” Jamie says, watching Draco.
“Thank you,” Draco says, walking Jamie out.
“I know what I’ve been told, and what I’ve read, and as far as the vampire life cycle goes, I’ve only been a vampire for six months,” he says, “there’s plenty I still don’t know.”
“Your parents are fine,” Tilly assures him, and Draco relaxes for a moment, “They were just here this morning, I’m sure they’ll be back as soon as we alert them you’ve woken.”
“It’s not about that, I can’t be around you right now, not after everything,” she says.
“You were drunk, and I wasn’t going to take advantage of that,” he says.
“You will have to consume some sort of blood, now you’ll have to figure out what method of consumption you wish to use, drinking tends to be the easiest, but a lot of new vampires tend to start with blood foods, as it makes the transition easier, you can get blood from special banks, some vampires consume straight from the blood bags, and there are facilities for human consumption, I’ll leave you all the information you’d like,” she says watching Draco for another moment, “Are you alright?”
Draco nods, “yeah, alright,” he says, “anything to not be round here,” he says, pulling the sheets up over himself.
Tracey looks up at Draco, starting to dance in front of him, and Draco decides to let loose, taking Tracey’s hand and spinning her around. Tracey grins, as she dances with Draco.
“Zella,” Draco says walking into the kitchen.
Draco Malfoy was a gay vampire, no one was going to love him. His own parents didn’t even love him anymore. Harry would never understand what it was like to be Draco. Draco Malfoy had fallen from grace. Draco was at one-point wizarding royalty, Harry Potter lived in the cupboard under the staircase. Draco Malfoy got anything he wanted simply because he asked, Harry Potter had to actually work for something if he wanted it. Draco was the one who suddenly didn’t know who he was, or what he stood for, and Harry had figured out exactly who he was and what he stood for. Harry Potter would never understand what it was like to be Draco Malfoy.
“Whatever Potter,” Draco says, “Don’t you ever take a day off?”
Meghan laughs again, “Yeah, I needed a dance break,” she says looking back at Draco, “Do you have anyone to drink?” she asks curiously.
Toby shakes his head, “it’s part of the thrill, right?”
“Draco don’t say that,” Narcissa hisses.
Draco returns to his bedroom, having every intention of going right to bed. Draco walks into the bedroom, before tripping and stumbling into the bathroom, “Oh,” he says, he hadn’t even noticed the sound of the shower running.
Harry laughs, “of course you do,” he says, “Alright, let’s go,” he says.
“Coffee?” he asks, before nibbling off a piece of his own biscuit.
Draco rolls his eyes, “C’mon, I want to see that film about the witch and the kneazle that scares off all her dates,”
“I’m serious,” Harry says.
“Take away these stunningly good looks, starve me of blood for a few days, and I am that feral creature, with only the need for sustenance to stay alive, the only thing that separates me from that is simply bloodlust.”
Draco narrows his eyes in Harry’s direction, “Those aren’t really the kind of things Death Eaters talk about.”
“I don’t know,” he sighs, “I sort of ran out” he admits.
Draco swallows, as the blood begins to fill his mouth more quickly than he anticipated, he almost thinks he did something wrong, but somehow in the back of his head, he knows he’s done it right. Draco presses his tongue against the vein in her neck, noting her pulse, as he applies a bit of pressure slowing the flow of blood into his mouth. Draco is surprised by how easy it is, Neil was right, there was very little sucking involved, he just had to control the flow of her blood, and swallow. He didn’t have to think much about her pulse, in the back of his head he just sort of knew, like Neil said he would.
“Alright then,” Draco says, watching Harry.
“Oh definitely,” Harry says quickly, rolling out of bed behind Draco.
Draco’s hand is ice cold, and burning hot at the same time, in the place where Harry’s hand left his, “I don’t believe anything they post in there” Draco says simply, straightening himself up, “besides, just because two blokes are snogging doesn’t mean they’re gay.”
“I’m not convinced,” Harry teases.
“I saw you out there dancing,” Toby says.
“What did you want to talk to me about?” Draco asks looking across the table at Harry.
“I don’t know,” Draco says, “I’ve only been a vampire for two months, and I’ve never added a relationship to that equation.”
“I have been,” Draco confirms, “Biscuit?” Draco asks, pushing the plate of pastries into the center of the table.
Harry walks into the bedroom going to the closet, looking for the sweater for Ginny.
It’s that moment that Toby moves in closer, tipping Draco’s chin up, staring into his mouth, he was surely staring at Draco’s fangs. Draco had started keeping them out more often, and he kept them out when he went out drinking, and clubbing, so he wouldn’t accidentally surprise anyone he was dancing with or snogging.
“More than you think,” Harry says.
pure bliss.
“Want what?” Draco asks narrowing his eyes at Anthony.
Toby smiles, “if anything you look better now.”
“We broke up that night,” Draco says.
Draco gives Harry the benefit of the doubt, “Michael Corner.”
Harry looks at Draco for a moment, before he nods, “yes,” he says, “but you’re going to have to come get it.”
Harry groans softly, kissing Draco back, nudging him back toward the sofa, he wanted to get Draco down on the first piece of furniture he could find and have his way with him.
Harry frowns, “You want to hook up with random blokes in the loo?”
Harry nods, pulling the sheets up over Draco’s body, “do you need anything?” he asks.
Harry clears his throat tearing his eyes away from Draco’s mouth, “I’m sorry, what was that?” he asks.
Draco’s head is spinning, he could scream.
Blaise reaches over Draco, “Nice to meet you, Mandy,” he says, taking hold of her hand for a moment, meeting her eyes.
Draco looks at Harry, wondering if they really were “together”, “Somewhere our worlds overlapped,” he says.
“Well I don’t hate you,” Harry says, his eyes falling to the floor, he was now looking at Draco’s bare feet, and it makes him happy to think he’s seeing Draco in his comfort zone, “if I’m honest, I’ve sort of grown to like you.”
“Are you guys having a good time?” Neil asks as he walks over to the three of them.
“Draco,” Anthony murmurs.
“You’re sure?” Harry asks.
Draco sits up on the bed pulling his pants from around his ankles tossing them onto the floor before, sliding his hand into Harry’s dark curls, pulling him closer. Harry whimpers, as Draco brings their faces together, and Harry looks into Draco’s beautiful silver eyes, his eyes tracing the red ring, before his dark pupils.
“I’ve been pretty good at keeping a schedule,” Draco says, “so I’m not exactly sure what ‘desire’ would be like.”
Ginny stares eyes wide in shock, “Why the hell would you do that?” she asks, “He has plenty of feeders to choose from.”
“These are not my type of girl,” he says.
“Half naked, attractive man, all over you,” Harry says.
Harry looks at Draco for a long moment before asking, “how will I know if you like something?”
“Shit,” he mutters, sucking away the tiny spot of blood that appears.
“It’s more than just a praise thing,” Harry says after a moment.
Harry watches after Draco, before sighing heavily putting his head down against his knees. What had he just set into place? Harry had doubts he was actually ready for this, he wasn’t even sure why he wanted this. Harry climbs out of bed a moment later walking into the bathroom turning on the shower.
Draco turns over, looking back at Harry. Harry looks back at Draco, and he thinks Draco looks so stunningly beautiful right now. He’s looking at Draco’s beautiful silver eyes, and the tiny red ring around his pupil, a sign of his vampirism, seem to be more prominent today. This could also just be that Harry’s gotten used to seeing Draco, so he barely notices anymore.
“No, I’m not,” he says.
Harry’s muscles tightening around him, is enough to send Draco over the edge, he groans as he comes spilling over inside of Harry. Draco closes his eyes as he catches his breath, and Harry’s body leans heavily against Draco’s, completely spent.
, the blood bank he visited every week.
“No, I don’t,” he insists.
Draco scoffs, “I don’t want to go there Potter,” he says, “neither of us were very good to the other, but let’s just let it stay in the past. I should be going,” he says sitting up straighter, trying his very best to hide his erection under his robes, as he stands up.
“It’s true,” Draco says, “especially if he was already deranged as a human.”
“I haven’t decided yet,” Harry says breathlessly, letting his fingers trail lightly over the fabric at the front of Draco’s bra, and down his stomach.
Harry nods, “I know it’s not a giant diamond like you’re probably used to, but I seriously want you to marry me.”
Blaise looks down at his watch, “Well I’d better be going,” he says, getting up.
“Well I don’t know if I am, all I know is he’s all I could think about lately” he sighs.
Draco turns his eyes down momentarily, he did not expect to be having this conversation today, and especially with Harry Potter.
“He’s not even a person!” Ginny insists.
“You don’t have to do that,” Harry says, watching Draco.
“Astoria’s sister? What could she have to do with this?” Draco asks, taking a drink from his mug, spilling quite a bit, “oh for Merlin’s sake, Zella,“ he calls out, reaching for tea towel quickly cleaning himself up. A moment later the house-elf appears at Draco’s side, ready to fulfill his request.
“Thanks,” Draco smiles, “Are you having a good time?” he asks.
Draco lets their hands stay close together as he glances over his shoulder to see Harry, “what’s wrong?” he murmurs, before laying his head back on his pillow.
don’t think I’m attractive.”
Harry sighs, “Yeah, I’m sorry,” he says, “wait, what are you doing out right now?”
Draco sighs, he was mad, “I’ll be mad tomorrow,” he says.
Harry looks back at Draco for a moment, “I am sorry this happened to you,” he says quietly, before turning and leaving the room.
“Yes,” Draco says without hesitation.
Harry was definitely not thinking, “It’s like telling someone you like to be tied up while getting fucked,” he says, “you’re allowed to leave some stuff out, everyone still knows you’re fucking.”
Draco doesn’t know what to say, so he says nothing, and pulls Harry down for a long kiss letting his tongue meet Harry’s, not fighting for dominance but letting one another occupy the same space as they kiss. When they pull apart Harry looks at Draco for confirmation.
Draco is quiet, as he watches her leave the room, and walk down the hall. Draco reaches up, pulling down the blood bag, reading over the label. It seemed like an ordinary blood bag to him, though he hadn’t really seen a lot of blood bags, so he really couldn’t know.
“It’s just a thing that happens,” he says.
Harry feels a heavy pit form in his stomach at Draco’s words, he’d made a huge mistake, “you have every right to hate me,” he whispers.
Draco raises an eyebrow but doesn’t push the issue, because that would imply that he cared about Potter, and he didn’t.
Draco stares back at Harry confused, “You’re joking.”
“I don’t know you, but I understand why you feel the way you do,” he says looking back at Draco, “I only want to help find out who did this to you and why so that you can be truly Draco Malfoy.”
“So, this is flirting, yes?” Draco confirms.
Harry looks back at Draco, crossing his arms over his chest.
Harry in comparison was only a mere two on the scale of best dressed, while his lover exceeded all of the levels on the scale. The dress was long, it fell all the way to the floor, and made a tiny pool of fabric on the floor at the back of the dress. Harry knew the shoes, the four-inch heels, silver in color, were keeping the rest of the fabric of the dress from touching the floor. The dress had a long slit straight up the side, all the way past the mid-thigh. Something that would have brought Harry shame had he been the one wearing it, but his lover was beautiful in the dress. The slit of the dress was lined with a tiny lace of silver fabric that continued around the bottom hem of the dress, and around the neckline, a very simple V-neck that would make any pair of breasts, no matter how big or small, look fantastic.
Harry smiles, slipping down into the water, making his way over to the older blonde.
“There’s a spell for that,” Draco says with a smile, seeing the desire in Harry’s eyes as he watches him, makes this all worth it.
Draco looks back at Harry, “I don’t know, Harry,” Draco says quietly.
Harry just smiles, because that’s exactly what they’re going to do, and for once he’s going to have the control, “Get in,” he says softly.
Harry smiles, “have a good night, Draco,” he says before walking off to go socialize with his date.
“Fuck,” Harry moans loudly, as the head of Draco’s cock prods against his swollen prostate, “Draco,” Harry whimpers in a desperate attempt to hold on.
“Time for bed,” Draco says a moment later.
“Thank you,” he says, before taking a drink, spilling only a small amount this time.
“I don’t want to talk about this now,” Draco says deciding he was done even thinking about it, “We’ll talk tomorrow.”
“Almost,” Draco says looking at Harry, “I just need you to do one thing for me,” he says, “one thing, and then I’ll take you straight home, and” Draco pauses for a moment, “defile you,” he whispers against Harry’s ear.
Draco was beyond frustrated as he watches Anthony step into the Floo. He wanted to scream, and a tiny part of him was sad, but he had to bury that under his anger for now. Draco changes out of his costume, and into his pajamas, and he wants to go straight to bed when he hears the fireplace in the other room.
“Pansy Parkinson,” Harry says shocked, he hadn’t heard a single thing about Pansy Parkinson since they left school.
Blaise sips on a firewhiskey, watching Imogen talk to a very pretty blonde witch, in a very short red dress.
“You were attacked.”
Draco stares back at Harry, he doesn’t know what to say, he’s shocked and confused, and angry.
Harry nods, “You always are.”
A nod, “Soon.”
Draco rolls his eyes, “just because I have good taste.”
“You broke up with me,” she says, “I’m not angry Draco, but I can’t be around you right now.”
“You shouldn’t have to be used to that, it’s bullshit,” Harry says.
Harry rolls his eyes, “Yeah, he’s not scary.”
“Fuck me Draco,” he says breathily, turning to press his body flush against Draco’s.
Draco rolls his eyes, “fine then,” he says.
“Luna Lovegood?” Draco asks it’d been a while since he heard that name.
“Zella made it,” Draco answers.
Draco scoffs, he was sure he was a sight to see right now, “Is this important?” Draco asks, not bothering to retract his fangs.
“But you need blood every day,” Harry says.
Draco leans over, wrapping his arms around Harry, truly embracing him. Harry’s arms wrap tightly around Draco’s tiny frame, and Harry is surprised when Draco crawls onto his lap and squeezes him tighter. Harry has never had a better hug in his entire life, he never knew hugs like this existed, but this was amazing, and he wouldn’t trade this moment for anything in the entire world.
Harry shakes his head, leave it up to Draco to go there, “Well, I’ll leave you then, and maybe I’ll have something else to tell you tomorrow,” he says.
When Draco comes out of the bedroom five minutes later, running into Meghan in the hall.
Harry looks up at Draco, “It’s your turn to make me feel good now,” he says, pushing Draco off him.
Draco shrugs, “Why not,” he says, letting Tracey take him out to the dancefloor, Draco hears Blaise say to Imogen, “he’s a sodding nightmare, he never knows what to wear to these things,” and Draco grins to himself.
“Where do you get them?”
Anthony looks at Draco for a moment, “I don’t want that,” he murmurs.
“I’m into quality potions, so, therefore, I need quality potion ingredients,” Draco says.
Draco smiles, “Just trying out the word, seeing how it feels,” he says.
Draco thinks for a moment, “No,” he answers, “Why?”
Neil’s party was a costume party, and Draco had no idea what wear. What Draco had not expected was to see Harry Potter at this party. Harry has this ridiculous smirk on his face when he saunters across the room over to Draco.
“Oh, I spend hours in front of the mirror daily,” Draco says, “So I know, I have cheekbones to kill, but why do you think I’m attractive, I’m not even your type.”
“That’s not how banana’s work Potter,” Draco says.
Draco was a bit more graceful when he took off his underwear, sliding them down his hips, and down his thighs, letting them fall onto the floor, before kicking them aside.
Once again there is some Vampire lore that I've made up as a combination of lore from Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling, Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead, and The Southern Vampire Mysteries by Charlaine Harris.
Draco looks at his mother for a moment, before turning to look back at his father, “Don’t worry father, I will go, and I’ll never come back.”
Harry smiles, “What should I get you?” he asks.
Draco looks over at Harry, “I don’t know what you want me to do about that,” he says.
“No, I’m not seeing him anymore,” he says, “I’m not really seeing anyone,” he says, even though he knows there’s someone he wants to see.
After a few silent minutes of heavy breathing, Draco pulls out slowly, as not to hurt Harry.
Draco opens the bag of blood, pouring half into a glass, before setting the bag back on the desk. Draco drinks his blood, he still didn’t have the hang of this down, but he was making less of a mess than he had made yesterday, and he did hope that with time this would get easier. Draco was startled by a knock at the door. He wasn’t expecting anyone, he thought maybe his mother had tracked him down, he gets up walking to the door, he was completely surprised when he opened the door.
Draco stares back at Harry with wide eyes, “I-I-“ he stammers, “I never said,”
“Okay,” Harry says after a moment of silence, deciding he had to trust Draco’s judgment, “Have you talked to him about that night?”
“No, why are you attracted to me,” Draco says.
“My pleasure,” Zella smiles, before disapparating.
Draco looks up over his shoulder, seeing Harry standing in the doorway, “Ah,” he says smiling slightly, “That’s my," Draco pauses, "sort of, boyfriend.”
“But a lot of vampires aren’t shy about it,” Harry says, “especially when you meet them in their own territory.”
Thanks for sticking around! I hope you continue to enjoy this series, as we grow nearer to the end :)
The thought of Draco entering his body in any capacity has Harry desperate to come, he wants more than anything Draco’s cock filling him and making him scream. Harry’s hips thrust up instinctively as his orgasm seizes him and he comes, spilling over his hand, breathing heavily.
“You barely put up with my shit as it is,” Draco says, “You are so quick to tell me that I’m acting like an asshole and that you’re leaving.”
“Why not?” she asks curiously.
Draco stares back at Harry for a moment processing this information, “Ernie Macmillian?”
“Just kiss me, Potter,” Draco says, pressing their lips together once more, and god did it feel amazing. Harry’s lips, Harry’s tongue, Draco is sure he’s lost his damn mind when he pulls his wand from his cloak pocket, and pushes Harry back through the bathroom door, locking the door with magic before putting a silencing charm over the room.
“That you’re here,” Draco mumbles.
“Because it’s not the kind of thing you hear from another person, it’s something you sort on your own.”
Draco sits down at his dining table, flipping through a copy of
Draco groans, his hips rocking forward, as Harry calls his name, “Yes,” he moans softly, arching his back.
It wasn’t really that Harry didn’t like it, he didn’t really know how he felt about it.
“You let him drink your blood,” Ginny grimaces, “It’s gross.”
Harry looks over his shoulder at Draco, a coy smile on his lips, Draco can’t help but stare at Harry’s arse as he walks away, he wanted him. Draco follows Harry out of the lake, walking with him to the edge of the forest, before he grabs onto Harry’s wrist stopping him, “Don’t go,” he says.
Draco rolls his eyes, “I’ve got to go” he says repositioning the strap on his bookbag on his shoulder, before turning to walk away.
“What happens after that?” Harry asks.
“Okay then,” Harry says, continuing to take his shirt off, looking at Draco when he’s unbuttoned his whole shirt, looking at Draco.
“No romance,” Draco says again.
Draco rolls his eyes, leaning back in his chair crossing his legs, “Well I didn’t do it without his permission if that’s what you’re insinuating.”
Draco wants to laugh, “Yeah, it’s part of the deal. I stay here, and my parents will pay for everything so long as I never go back home and soil the family name with my vampirism.”
“Oh,” Draco says, looking back at Harry.
“I was there because of Andrea Sefer,” Harry says.
Draco frowns starting to wonder if something bad had also happened to his parents, “Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy,” he says quickly, “Are my parents alright?” he asks.
“I don’t want that Draco,” Anthony says.
Draco takes a sip from his mug, trying his best not to spill, but Draco noticed a dribble as it escaped his mouth. Draco sits up straight, when he hears a knock at the door, he was not expecting anyone. He didn’t even know if anyone knew he had moved in here.
“Okay,” Draco says, “you should have breakfast,” he says.
It’s a few weeks later when Draco literally runs into Harry it’s after eight, and no one else is around.
“Didn’t take you as the hand holding type,” Harry says.
“Because it makes it harder to keep a secret,” Draco says.
Harry sighs heavily, running his hands through his hair, “ugh, fuck me,” he sighs, pulling slightly at his hair, “Sorry Malfoy” he says, starting to walk off.
“I know you’re nowhere near as horrible as you want the world to think you are,” Harry says.
“You should go,” he says after a moment of silence.
“Feeling better?” she asks.
“I don’t know, I think I’m starting to figure you out,” Harry says.
“Thank you,” Anthony smiles, “though I think the bunny might be cuter,” he says giving Draco a small wink.
The loud click in his ears as four fangs appear in his reflection, Draco couldn’t help but stare back at his reflection. He had made his fangs appear at will. It was only a matter of time before he started to figure out the whole vampire thing, and here he was, finally having sorted how his fangs worked.
Draco stares back at Harry, “You’re asking me to marry you, and somewhere along the way turn you into a vampire,” he says.
Harry steps outside, “Goodnight Malfoy.”
“Hey,” Draco murmurs, leaning slightly into Anthony’s body.
“How do I get rid of these?” he asks, quickly.
“Harry,” Ginny says, “what are you doing?” she asks stepping out of the fireplace.
Harry lets out a soft whimper, as Draco’s arms wrap around his waist, “Draco,” Harry murmurs as he moves his hips slightly, hyper-aware of every inch of Draco’s cock pressing against the inside of his body, and that thought, is enough to bring Harry to his climax.
“I have fangs,” he repeats.
“Sort of?” Harry says.
“My birthday is coming up,” Draco says, eating some melon.
Draco’s first proper shower in what must have been a week. He had a quick shower last night when he got home, but he was so upset about everything with his parents, he just wanted to be out of there. In this hotel room, under the spray of the water, he was starting to feel like his old self. The Draco that he knew.
“I thought you didn’t want to see anyone,” Harry says.
“I’m thirsty,” Draco says looking at Harry, “So come if you wish, but know what you’re getting into,” Draco says stepping into the fireplace.
“How was your day?” Draco asks, looking up at Harry.
Harry looks at Draco waiting to be sure he was done talking, before saying anything.
“You don’t always know what I want Potter,” Draco says crossing his arms over his chest.
“Yes father, because I fucking wanted this!” Draco says angrily, “I fucking went out looking for a vampire to attack me and turn me into one of them.”
“Draco,” Harry says cautiously, getting up walking over to him.
“How long have you known him?” Harry asks.
“We should?” Harry asks.
“I’m your best mate if you can’t show me who can you show?” he insists.
Harry nods, “Alright, he might know how you ended up with Danielle later that night.”
“How did you even know I was here?” he asks next.
“Are you alright?” Imogen asks, walking over to Draco.
“I never said I was,” Draco says.
“It’s alright,” Harry insists, “you don’t have to hide them.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Draco Malfoy,” he says.
Draco looks at Anthony, he could tell he was lying “You were talking about me,” he says.
Harry frowns, “That’s a long time to live.”
Draco and Harry arrive back at Draco’s flat a few hours later, Draco steps out of the fireplace, shrugging off his cloak, and taking his shoes off, “I’m starving,” Draco says, walking into the kitchen, “Are you hungry?” he asks.
Draco shakes his head, “No I can’t say I have.”
“I’ve plans later tonight,” he says simply, eating his breakfast.
Draco wants to growl, all he wanted was to get off, but he realized that this was their first time and he needed to cut Harry some slack.
“You can give me that hug now,” Draco says.
Draco shakes his head, “I can’t tell you.”
Draco looks down at their hands linked together, he opens his mouth to say something, but then closes his mouth, he wanted this after all. He wanted to be with Harry, he wanted to have a normal life. Well as normal as he could, considering he was now a vampire and normal people had relationships, and families and Draco wanted all of that, but could he do that with Harry?
Harry shrugs, “I don’t, but Luna does.”
Draco looks over his shoulder, looking at Blaise who was now snogging Mandy, “No, he’s definitely not my boyfriend,” he says.
“Lately, your personality hasn’t been horrid,” Harry says, trying to hide the cheeky smile on his face.
Draco looks back at Harry, they had spoken briefly about this but had never really revisited it. Draco had been thinking a lot about this recently, especially since they were getting rather serious in their relationship. Harry practically lived with him and they had sort of agreed to further their relationship, and this was something Draco had wanted to bring up eventually.
“What a shame, it’s your favorite subject too,” Harry teases.
“You gonna let her get all that attention?” Draco teases, “I’d be a little jealous if my boyfriend was getting looks like that.”
Harry looks back at Ginny, “engaged?”
Harry smiles, “my neighbors have a dog.”
“To talk,” Harry says, “I uh, brought you this,” he says holding out what appeared to be a lollie, “It’s a blood lollie, I thought it might help.”
Draco licks at the blood that starts to spill from her neck, as he pierces her neck with his bottom fangs, letting them settle in the muscle in her neck.
“Why?” Draco asks still not understanding.
“Good now is there anything else you want to talk about right now?” he asks.
“I suppose, that I could leave you now,” Harry says.
Harry rolls his eyes, “you can’t miss something you’ve never had,” Harry says.
Harry looks at Draco for a moment, “That mustn’t have been easy” he says.
Harry swallows thickly watching Draco’s red lips as he talks to him, “Are you ready to go?” he asks softly.
Harry nods, “How did we end up together then?”
“Well, you’ve basically been with me since my transformation,” Draco says with a shrug.
“I know, I think he would prefer it that,” Draco says, “I’ve told my secret, now it’s your turn.”
On Sunday when Harry wakes up, and makes himself some porridge, and sits down in front of the tele to eat his breakfast. Harry was supposed to see Draco this evening, but that was before Ginny and Hermione showed up.
Harry nods, “I’ll just,” Harry stammers, “coffee,” he mutters, quickly walking into the next room.
“Learn to share,” Blaise smiles, and Draco just smiles, thinking that as long as Blaise started having fun, it’d be okay.
Luna smiles, “My boyfriend dressed as a Pygmy Puff,” she says pointing at the young man dressed as a pink puffball.
Harry nods, “you think it’s the fangs that make it difficult?” he asks curiously.
Draco stares back at Harry, “Seriously?” he asks half shocked.
Narcissa wills herself not to cry, “Draco,” she murmurs.
Zella quickly does as she’s asked, bringing Draco a warm glass blood.
“We’re not leaving until you tell us,” Ginny insists.
“I know,” Draco says, walking into his closet, “but I don’t like when things don’t go my way,” he says.
“I told him it was okay,” Harry says looking back at Ginny.
Luna smiles, “Well I think I’m ready or a glass of Elf-made wine,” she says.
Cami smiles, “Why don’t you have another go,” she says.
Draco looks back at Harry, he feels like this is the point of the conversation where he should say sorry, but Draco doesn’t want to apologize, he’s not even sure if he would know how to properly apologize.
Blaise stares back at Draco, “Can I see?” he asks, wondering what vampire fangs looked like up close.
“It’s polite,” Draco says, gently pushing the tray of sugar and milk across the table to Harry.
Draco smiles, kissing Harry’s forehead, “I can’t, I’ve brought you all the way to the edge,” he says gently stroking Harry’s dark hair, “Once I breach your lifeforce, there’s no going back.”
“I don’t
“If you want out of this relationship, this is your chance before either of us commit emotions to this, emotions that can lead to hurt feelings,” Draco says before, “More hurt feelings.”
“Not what?” Draco prods.
“Well I’m glad I don’t have to deal with that,” Draco says, stepping out of the closet a minute later, fully dressed.
“All of it,” Harry says.
“Blood bags,” Harry says.
Blaise looks at Draco, “All I did was make sure the two of you were alone at the pub, I kept everyone else busy, what was said between the two of you, I have no idea.”
Kingsley blinks back at Harry, for a moment, and Harry can see him putting puzzle pieces together in his mind, “I did not realize you two were here together,” Kingsley says, as calmly as ever, “Glad to see you have interests outside the Ministry, Potter,” he says with a friendly smile before turning to Harry’s date, “Enjoy the rest of your evening, Mister Malfoy.”
“I’m a bunny,” Draco says pointing at his bunny ears, “See,” he says turning to show Harry his fluffy bunny tail.
“Such a good boy, Harry,” Draco says quietly thrusting his hips to meet Harry’s, causing Harry to cry out squeezing his eyes shut.
Draco glances up at Harry, “What are you staring at?” he asks, running his fingers through his hair, “You’ve never seen a guy read before?”
“Oh, really? After what happened-“
Do Death Eaters fall in love? When the Hero and the Anti Hero fall for each other. This chapter contains a bit of the inner workings of the romantic relationship between a human and a vampire, and more so the inner workings of the relationship between a former Death Eater, and the Chosen One.
Draco smiles, “I don’t really want anything,” he says.
Draco shrugs, looking over at Anthony, “I’ll be back.”
“We have to talk about this,” Draco insists firmly.
“Sorry,” Harry mutters looking away briefly.
“Draco Malfoy,” he says forcing himself to tear his eyes away from her body and look at her face. She had high cheekbones, and she wore red blush and had dark eyeliner on, and her eyes, they were piercing blue, and Draco wanted to taste her lips that were bright red and had just a bit of sparkle. The way she smiled had Draco’s heartbeat increasing.
“Just,” he starts, “if you wanted, you could,” he says stopping himself.
Draco thinks about changing quickly, but he was rather thirsty, “Alright then,” he says.
Draco nods, “I enjoyed that quite a bit,” he says, “and I usually don’t like AB Positive all that much.”
Draco smiles, really smiles, “Potter,” he says.
Jamie nods, and takes off his top, as he sits down on the sofa, watching Draco kneel on the sofa beside him.
“Oh, um,” Draco wants to say no, but he has to admit seeing all these vampires drinking from humans, has him more than curious, and he actually does want to try it now. He wasn’t thirsty, but he could feel his fangs tingling with anticipation.
“We’re talking,” Ginny says firmly grasping onto Harry’s arm, keeping him from leaving.
