But his interest in Malfoy wasn’t his fault this time, either. Just look at the guy! At the trials he looked like death himself. And now he was back at Hogwarts, practically glowing with his shiny golden locks and his smooth pale skin and cute pink cheeks and round bum and Harry really should stop thinking about Malfoy before his lower body betrayed him again.
But the Gryffindor king was quick to wave away his friends worries. "I know what I’m doing. He will come to his senses."
“Yes, that’s what I thought. Turns out, though, it’s a club to make friends and bring love and peace to the students of Hogwarts.”
The Gryffindor sneaked sideway glances at his working partner regularly, admiring his face contracted in concentration. Harry found himself hypnotized by the long and slender fingers constantly chopping ingredients, stirring the potion or tracing lines in the textbook.
“Just, stop!” Malfoy hissed and pressed their joined hands onto Harrys leg, effectively stunning Harry into absolute stillness. Malfoy did not retract their hands from Harrys leg and therefore had to lean into the Gryffindor a bit. Harry could smell Malfoys shampoo, which surprisingly was sweet vanilla, and a scent that was purely Malfoy. Harry got dizzy and sucked in another breath. Merlin, let this moment never end!
“Well, well, it speaks!” Harry exclaimed, his insides feeling all warm and fuzzy. Finally, Malfoys voice was directed at him. Gods, how he missed this.
“Never! I caught it! It’s rightfully mine.” Draco peeked experimentally over Potter’s shoulder. He had to admit, the Gryffindor was very useful. Such broad and muscular shoulders…
“I going to make postcards out of those pictures! The world needs to have ugly Malfoy postcards” Ron chuckled.
“Well, that’s because we all love you, despite your lot shortcomings. Though I have no idea, why we love you so much, ‘cause you’re really an idiot.” Astoria giggled when Draco tried to hit her with a pillow but missed when Astoria tickled him. Soon, both were a laughing mess on the ground, their limbs entangled with each other.
Luna reached out across the table and patted Malfoys and Harrys forehead. “You shouldn’t frown that much or the wrackspurts will come back.”
“Don’t go all Longbottom on me, Potter. I want our potion to be perfect, so you are to do as I say.” Malfoy snarked rather loudly, his pretty mouth turned in an ugly sneer.
“That”, Draco gestured to Harry in general. “All that kissing and touching and being nice to me. Don’t do that, when you’re going to dump me.”
I then saw Ron and Hermione making their way towards us and promptly apparated me and Draco into my bedroom in Grimmauld Place. I really didn’t want to stop what Draco and I were about to do.
Turning back to Draco, Harry said, "There's more you don't know. I was also the horseman that destroyed your pottery stall."
Harry noticed how Draco adapted to the lifestyle in the little hut. Everyday he learned a new thing about the blond and fell more and more in love with him.
After he had returned to the castle in a rage, he had worked off his frustration in sword fights with his soldiers. Only when the supreme captain poured a bucket of ice cold water over his face did his anger evaporate with surprise.
“Of course, you’re his family after all. I told him all sorts of stories about you.” Harry smirked, “His favorite story is how Draco the dragon turned into a ferret. Ron got him a ferret plush toy and Teddy calls it ‘Draco’. He loves it.”
Draco stood up, ready to leave. “I’m sorry, Lovego–eh, Luna. But I don’t think, that’s something I’m interested in.” Hermione was packing up her things, too.
“Sometimes, I guess.” Draco frowned. Was Astoria right? Harry did sound a little jealous. But that couldn’t be, because Draco had told him he was gay. Besides, Harry wouldn’t be that attached to Draco already, would he?
“Yeah, mate. And he’s the son of You-Know-Whos right hand man. You’re sleeping with the enemy! What if he’s selling you right out to Voldie?” exclaimed Ron.
The rest of lunch and the day, really, passed uneventfully to Harrys dismay. He tried to strike up a conversation, but Malfoy was back to ignoring him.
Sobbing, Draco dropped himself onto a bench in the kitchen. Molly hurried to him immediately and embraced him. Before she could ask what had upset the blond boy, the kitchen door opened.
After a comforting hug from the cook, Draco set to work, trying not to think about Potter. But he did think of green eyes and a rough voice that softly hummed songs.
The Prince sighed softly and wrapped his arms around Harry's neck. The last time Draco was kissed like that was with King Thrushbeard. But the king was forgotten under the beggar's dark green gaze. Forgotten the kiss Draco still dreamed of sometimes. The kiss with the beggar was so much better than that dream.
Harry groaned. He didn’t just thought about snogging Draco bloody Malfoy and got caught by exact same boy. Thank Merlin, Ron and Hermione were to absorbed in their own lovey dovey couple world to notice.
“No, no. I’m sorry! Please stay!” Harry wheezed and forced Draco to sit down again – Draco didn’t know, how he managed that, he was injured after all. “I’m not laughing at you, I swear. It’s just, it makes so much sense now. You not being home yesterday, Ginny incoherently yelling at me.” Harry sighed and ran his fingers through his hair. “I don’t want to dump you, I want to be with you.”
Draco couldn’t help the tears that were flowing. Lucius wiped them away with his thumb. “I expect you to be more open and honest with me and your mother, from now on, Draco. It will take time to get adjusted to your newest lifechoice and it is hard to bury longheld animosity. But we will make an effort to welcome your partner into our family.” Lucius said gently. “If Potter behaves, that is”, he added. Draco laughed and kissed his fathers hand.
At the department of marital affairs Draco stomped into the first office he saw. Before the employee could protest, Draco said down in one of the chairs and looked imperiously down his nose. “You will investigate whether my marriage with this idiot is legally binding and if it is, you will immediately divorce us. Oh, and you will, of course, be discreet in this affair.”
“Of course not, father!” Draco fell onto his knees beside his fathers feet and clutched his fathers hand pleadingly. “I just didn’t know what to expect. I went against your wishes and created such a scandal. I brought shame to you, to our name. I thought, maybe you wouldn’t want to see me ever again.”
The princes beauty was known in the entire continent and the only reason King Lucius put up with his spoiled sons behavior. Draco was just too cute even when he was angry, and that was most of the time.
Ginny reminded Draco of Astoria – a pretty but fierce woman, who could be very scary when it came to her loved ones.
“Dear Prince – hoho –, I heard of your beauty and offer you a joyful life by my side. My servants in the courtyard are loading a huuuundred barrels of the most wonderful wine into your father's cellar. Hehe.”
Right at that moment Neville stumbled into the common room. Spotting the banner, he asked the group “Intervention banner, what’s that for?”
Making his way to the showers he froze abruptly at the sight of a half naked blonde Slytherin. Harry breathed in sharply, letting his eyes run hungrily over the pale body before him, trying to imprint every curve into his memory. The white skin still glistened from wetness, one drop of water sneaking its way down on perfect abs.
Over the next few days, the entire people of Gryffindor were in excitement. Their beloved king had finally announced his intention to marry. Cheers broke out in the streets. For a long time, the people had been waiting to finally see their king wedded.
He opened the kitchen door a crack wide and indeed. There next to Molly Weasly stood the blond prince cutting various vegetables. Every few minutes Molly pushed a small snack into the prince's mouth, and the prince hummed a short buzz as a thank you.
“Harry Potter! Come to die…” Voldemort sounded almost wondrous, as if he couldn’t believe I was really dumb enough to walk into certain death.
Somehow Draco had ended in Potters living room. He stared blankly out of the window, while Hermione lectured them about the consequences of the bonding spell.
“I overheard you talking with Bill and Hermione. You said, you want to break the bond, so you can finally free yourself from the burden that is me.” Draco said bitterly. Harry was cruel to make him spell it out.
Slightly confused – what was the Gryffindor doing in Slytherin? – Ron replied, "She's in the library, as usual", and followed Harry, who hurried straight to the aforementioned place.
When Draco looked up at the king again, he revealed a scar across his forehead. But Draco looked only into the green eyes before him and realized...
“Harry”, Ron whispered with a pleading look to his best friend, “you can’t seriously still want him. This brat is cruel. You are too good for him. And I’m afraid he will make fun of you, too. Let’s go before he breaks your heart with humiliation.”
Heaving a heavy sigh, Harry took a seat. He knew, once his friends determined to see something through, they wouldn’t let him off the hook easily. Resigned, Harry asked, “And which of my behaviours do you think you need to intervene in?”
Defensively Harry raised his hands. "Nothing, really. But maybe nobody can bother me now that I have gotten married after all."
A great feast was announced. Not only in the castle, but also in the whole city was to be celebrated. Everyone was invited. And so, kings, dukes and noblemen from all countries streamed in to congratulate the Gryffindor king.
He decided to check up on Blaise and see if he got any last-minute anxieties or doubts. But Blaise’s nervous pacing ceased immediately when the groom spotted his best friend and broke out in a fit of hysterical laughter.
"When all those men came to you and you made beautiful eyes at them, I became very jealous." Alone at the thought of that day, Harry clenched his fist in frustration. "Out of my anger, I destroyed the stall. I know now how wrong I was and I am very sorry. I could have hurt you. I love you so much. If anything had happened to you, I would never have forgiven myself." With shaky hands, Harry cupped Draco's face and wiped away the remaining tears with his thumb.
Thanks to the high heels, Draco was the tallest. He gracefully kicked Pansy out of his way, squealing gleefully “Take that, Pansy!” – he still hadn’t forgiven her for breaking the silencing charms at Blaise’s stag night – and elegantly snatched the flowers out of Granger’s outstretched, waiting hands. Draco would have liked to take pride in his Seeker’s abilities, but his triumph was all due to his long limbs and Granger’s shortness.
I huffed annoyed. First of all, my voice isn’t that high. Second, Malfoys hair was really fascinating. The color always changing with the external conditions.
“After that, he thoroughly scolded me for besmirching your dignity and purity. But then he suddenly grinned and clapped my shoulder. He said ‘Those with Black blood are something else, eh?’ and described, that he couldn’t resist Narcissas charm either and they eloped before their actual wedding. The official bonding ceremony was held as planned, though.”
Gaping, Harry looked from the professor to Malfoy, who looked equally as shocked. He looked to McGonagall again, waiting for her to call it all a joke and send them to Filch, so they could polish everything in the trophy room or something.
The next two hours did not go better. The pottery stall with the beautiful prince attracted a certain kind of clientele: rich men looking for some fun with the handsome potter.
My mind drifted off to the fateful encounter a few weeks ago. I found Malfoy crying in the bathroom. But instead of hexing me, he snogged the living daylights out of me. He said, if he was going to die anyway because Voldemort had occupied his house and wanted to turn him into the youngest Death Eater ever, he could now at least die without regrets.
Way too soon though, Draco had to end their dancing when the pain of wearing high heels the entire day became too much. Already lamenting the inevitable loss of Potter’s proximity, Draco disentangled himself from the Gryffindor.
Draco sniffed, “Peasant.” He took his napkin and wiped at Harrys cheek. “See, it’s dirty eating like this.” Realizing what he had just done, Draco blushed. They were both behaving like an old married couple with all that bickering and caring.
“Ehm, professor.” Malfoy asked, blushing furiously and sounding absolutely mortified. “What if we–“ He closed his eyes, took a calming breath and tried again. “What about, when we have to go to the bathroom?”
Narcissa then turned to Voldemort and said in a neutral tone “He’s dead”. This statement was followed by shouts of glee. I think I heard Voldie let out a breath of relief. If I didn’t had to play dead I would have scoffed loudly.
Since then, whenever Harry and Draco visited the Burrow, the blond and ginger girl were attached to the hip. They had just finished de-gnoming the garden (“You don’t have to, Draco dear. Your hands are so delicate, let the boys do that.” “Hey, I’m not a boy, mum!” “But you act like one, Ginevra!” Merlin, Draco loved that woman) when Draco overheard Bill and Hermione pulling Harry aside.
To Harrys joy he often was paired to work with Malfoy in classes giving the dark haired boy opportunities to casually touch the blonde. Their hands, elbows and knees would brush accidentally when one of them reached for an ingredient, leaned closer to read in a shared textbook or repot a large plant. When they touched, Harry could occasionally hear a muffled hiss coming from Dracos left side. The hisses gave Harry one more reason for longing to see what was under the Slytherins robes.
“Yes. I need you to get Hermione. Whatever’s wrong with me it’s her fault.” Merlin, Draco was going to kill her.
Panicked, the prince pulled himself together and hurried after the beggar. "No, no. I will come. Just don't run so fast."
“Well, Father, here we go. Did you find some more foolish people to marry me?” Before Lucius could answer Draco rushed the next words out haughtily.
“Hey, I didn’t want to see him in a skirt! I just said, the only thing missing from Malfoy being a girl would be wearing a skirt!”
The game was exhilarating. Draco held a very professional playing style and Harry was struggling to keep the upper hand. He never felt himself so challenged and this was pure bliss. In the end the Gryffindor clasped his fingers around the small golden ball.
“You can redecorate and add your personal things anywhere you like, I don’t mind” said Harry after the tour. “Maybe you should go to the manor to grab the things you need. And then we can go sleep the jetlag off. Should I–I mean, do you want me to come with you to get your stuff?”
The blond looked at the bed, which seemed very narrow. And only now did he notice a problem. "Where is my bed?"
Luna leaned over and asked to see the diagrams which earned her a beaming smile and a promise for later from Hermione.
“I nearly had him. Every time I said something wrong his eyebrow twitched and one time he even opened his mouth to admonish me, I’m sure. Just a bit more and then he’s talking to me. He can’t ignore me much longer!” Harry proclaimed at dinner that day.
Harry gave Draco an appraising look and smirked. “You are not half as beautiful as you are said to be.”
Her smile faded, however, when she saw her friends looking determinedly at her and gathered under a banner. The poster read "Intervention".
Greg just shrugged as he went to bed himself and said matter of factly “It kind of clicked today, seeing you both hold hands. Explains your obsession over all those years. ‘Night.”
Full of anticipation, Draco went to the first meeting. After the war he wanted to make amends, especially with Luna who was locked in his basement for a while. What better opportunity to join her new club? It couldn’t be too bad, because Luna was a Ravenclaw. Besides, he really was interested in Linguistics Of Various Educationsystems.
Draco turned innocently to Granger who glared at him. He vaguely recalled Weasley promising to propose that day if Granger caught the bouquet. Draco patted her head consolingly. “Don’t glower, Granger. You should thank me! I’m gifting you a bit more time in freedom!”
When he opened the door, he was met with two red robed men. Though their robes were more of a see-through material. “We’re from the Auror Corps and got a call for nightly disturbance. You’re under arrest for” –both men dramatically teared off their robes to reveal a sexy muggle police outfit– “too much sexiness.”
The king lost his appetite out of all the self-accusations and worry. How could he eat when his spouse was perhaps starving?
After a few hours that felt like days, the Healer in charge finally reported, that Harry was out of the woods and Draco was allowed to go see him.
“No, quite the opposite, actually. Molly is elated, to finally see me settle. After Ginny and I broke up, I came out as gay. Since then, Molly is restless, because I never introduced someone as my partner, while all of her other kids brought their partners home.” Harry rubbed soothing circles on Dracos back until the blond fell asleep.
“I’m sorry, ok? I’m definitely not a homophobe, my brother is homosexual, too. And I know, that clothes shouldn’t be gender specific. Mum used to dress me up in dresses, before Ginny was born, and I rather liked it. I just wanted to mess a little with Malfoy, that’s all. Don’t hit me” Ron held up his hands in defence.
Oh, if only Draco had listened to Luna and not been bothered by the smell of fish. Then he would have been in a safe place and not so dangerous at the gate. He was a complete failure.
“That is a great pity. You know, I really wanted to make Hogwarts a better place, where there is no violence, no bullying. You see, I was bullied very often. And I’m all alone. I really hoped, I could make friends with both of you and make a difference in our final year at Hogwarts.” Luna looked at them with wide, sad eyes.
Harry couldn’t suppress a light chuckle, relieved for the lack of maliciousness in Malfoys friendly mocking voice. They worked in silence accept for Malfoys instructions and Harrys muttered „Got it“s.
"Harry, when you married him, you took responsibility for him. Go to him, talk to him. Maybe everything is different than it seems. Give Draco a chance to explain himself. You can't just abandon him like that." Hermione was convinced there was a logical explanation for Draco's behavior. She knew that her friend had a terrible temper. But he also had a big heart.
“I’m so sorry, Harry. I will research the bond and find a solution, I promise”, Hermione said and hugged Potter tightly.
When I came to stand before Draco, he grabbed me by the collar and I leaned in, expecting a kiss. But what I got was a slap in the face. And another.
Draco shook his head, searching for a witty comeback. “You have one dirty mind, Potter. I do not appreciate your enthusiasm.” His face lit up. “Oh. There you have your rhyme!”
Before Hermione could answer though, the Slytherin came out of the room. Immediately, Harry felt a pull on his hand, pulling him towards the blonde. Heaving a sigh, Malfoy held out his hand which Harry took gently.
When it was safe to come out, Draco emerged from his hideout. He decided to go look for a drink because he really needed one after that stressful confrontation but didn’t make it far when Potter grabbed his hand.
"Send only the guards and dogs and servants. I have the King's word and meanwhile, play a song”, the beggar mocked and actually began to sing a vulgar song crookedly.
Draco smiled invitingly at the two men and asked "Would the gentlemen like to buy some plates or cups?”
Draco suppressed a shudder. It was his turn to lean into Potter, and when he did, he nibbled at Potter’s earlobe. “Then, you will give me a private strip tease, Auror Potter.”
“What the fuck, Granger? Where did you find this fucking spell? How could you even perform it correctly in your drunken state?” Draco roared. Potter beside him asked astonished “We’re soulmates?”
All the way to the Great Hall Hermione kept up a steady stream of onesided conversation and shooting Harry knowing looks. Harry tried to focus on her words and not on the turmoil of feelings inside of him. Everybody was staring at them and Malfoy ignored him again. His hand was so warm and soft, Harry had to suppress the desire to squeeze his hand and interlace their fingers.
When he himself exited he stumbled into a firm chest. Looking up he met emerald green eyes and stepped back hastily.
"Will I argue when the morning is so beautiful and I am in a good mood?" laughed the beggar. "Fine, you can keep the skirt. But we'll sell your old clothes at the ragman's."
The black-haired Gryffindor stared helplessly at this crying mess of a best friend. Admittedly, he really talked a lot about Malfoy. But that was only because Malfoy was definitely up to something! And if he noticed Malfoy's devilish good looks from time to time then surely he would be allowed to point that out! He opened his mouth to say as much but was hushed by Hermione.
“Hush, Ron. I will not accept any other person as my bride. I’m confident he won’t find any fault with me”, Harry replied. “And as I see it, my competition is just reducing.”
“Wow, that’s not as romantic as I expected. I had hoped for something more dramatic, like Potter realizing his undying love for you, so he had to chase you all around the world to rescue you from a marriage you didn’t want.” Astoria sighed and slouched into the couch.
“Je parle un peu. J'ai appris le français dans mon enfance.” Draco smiled. It was a while since he spoke French and it was nice to activate his rusty skills again.
When Draco regained consciousness he was alone. On the night stand lay a note and a glass phial. The note, Draco recognized Blaises handwriting, instructed him to watch last nights meomories in the rented hotel pensieve. They would then meet to have dinner with the others, including Potter.
“What?” Tearing my gaze away from blonde hair, that shone golden in the morning sunlight, I glanced at my friend for a second before my eyes slipped again to a certain blonde Slytherin.
Blinking, Harry turned to the blonde. “Stop what?” he asked confused. Did he do something with his hand? He glanced at their joined hands. Nope, no squeezing, no circling, no traveling.
“I think, he’s going to look cute in a dress” Harry sighed dreamily. Ron stared at his friend in horror.
“Well, it’s an unfamiliar house and bed. I was wondering, if it’s okay or if we should change something, so you feel more at home. Sorry, I forgot to ask yesterday.” Harry gave him an amused look. Did he notice anything from earlier?
Draco was on guard. He really was. But then Potter asked him what kind of hair care he was using. And stupid Potter sniffed at Dracos head, wrinkled his nose amused and announced that it had to be something extremely extravagant, because Draco was such a ‘posh git’, right on time when professor Slughorn entered the potions classroom.
“Hush, Harry. You were confused. Now, I wasn’t finished.” Neville glanced at his paper again. “Where was I? Ah, right. Harry, you are not only gay. You are gay for Draco Malfoy, have been for years. You have suppressed your feelings for so long. Like I suppressed my inner Gryffindor. So, I say to you now, from war hero to war hero: you have to embrace who you are! And in your case, Harry, it’s being gay. For Malfoy.”
Hermione was right, the prince could have simply gone with a noblemen. But he had stayed at the stall. Harry was so stupid. He should not have destroyed the pottery. He shouldn't have ridden away. He should have gone to the hut immediately after the incident instead of hiding in his castle.
Really, I don’t care if Malfoy was only playing with me. I would take everything he was willing to give me. It took only one night, one try. And damn, I’m hooked.
Zabini approached and once again took Draco's hand. “We could provide you with everything you need and you wouldn’t have to worry about working.”
“Easy there, boy wonder. My father doesn’t approve, but he is openminded.” Draco staggered into Harrys arms. The relief made his body go limp. Draco laughed into Harrys chest and shed a few more tears. “I still have my family! Merlin, I was so afraid of losing them.”
His friends had warned him not to go, because there were rumors of the princes nasty personality. But here was King Harold mingling amongst the other marriage candidates. He was the only one wearing a mask. He didn’t want to start a ruckus in enemy territory before he even got to speak with Draco.
Potter blushed a little and said sheepishly, “I noticed many things about you, back in school. I mean, we were rivals and all that. Guess, I never forgot any of it.”
Draco got up and went to the door to let Harry in. Harry, noticing Dracos red rimmed eyes, immediately growled, “I’m going to hex that bastard!”
The prince immediately thought of the Gryffindor king. He had a really beautiful country. Draco could have been lord of this land at the king's side. But what did he have now?
The Gryffindor king swallowed his broken emotions down. And said in an icy voice, only his eyes betraying his pain, “I thought you wanted a human. But I forgot, you're looking for a pretty chin. I do not have one. But I love you, handsome prince. Why? That you must ask the thrush, she knows more about love than you do.”
“Oh, Pansy, that bitch. Potter, John, you have to arrest her! I bet it was her who destroyed my silencing charms, because she’s jealous I’m bridesmaid and not her.”
“Gosh, Draco, sweet, sweet darling. Aren’t you a sight to behold! I knew the dress is made for you!” Blaise giggled and held his stomach.
“Well, yeah.” Harry frowned. “But isn’t that normal? I mean, I should know things about my enemy, right?”
Finally, the day came to an end. After detention I rushed to the Room of Requirement where he was waiting.
The beggar opened the door of the small, shabby hut invitingly and said with a bow, "Enter, my darling!”
Ron was frozen in shock. Then he turned an angry red and spluttered. “Did he just kiss me?” Then he paled. “Does this count as cheating on Hermione?”
A very fat and pig faced man came to stand before Draco. His cheeks flushed a bright red like a crab. Lord Crabbe licked his lips as he openly leered at the blonde prince who in turn scrunched up his face in disgust and thought with a snort `Lord Crabbe, the crab’. Draco was sure the man was drunk as the Lord began to speak interrupted by his own giggling.
Draco paled at the accusations, but there was a glint of something in his eyes. “Now rephrase it” he urged Harry in a soft tone, Harry never heard before.
Of course, the blond knew he looked dashing. And some stupid jokes couldn’t crush his confidence. But he had to admit Potter’s presence next to him was reassuring. Also, he glared pretty scarily at everyone who commented on Draco’s outfit or tried to pet him, like Aunt Ruth. That witch had pinched Draco’s cheek several times as if to rip off a chunk of his flesh with her podgy fingers. When Aunt Ruth said that Draco looked scrumptious, Potter had growled threateningly and Aunt Ruth retreated quickly.
Harry turned around abruptly and stood directly in front of Draco in just a few quick, long steps. “Is this how you want to marry me?”
When McGonagall finished flicking her wand, Malfoy immediately dropped Harrys hand and fled towards the dungeons.
Draco wasn’t the person to use many words of affection. That made those moments so much more precious. He rather showed his love in the way he kissed me or looked at me while his luscious lips were wrapped around my.. “Oh dear. Then he’s going to kill you.” Narcissa broke me from my reverie.
Harry made an angry sound and fisted Malfoys robes. He drew him in to…to what exactly? Punch him again in front of McGonagall? Harry wasn’t so sure anymore. Malfoys minty puffs of breath were really distracting.
When the Gryffindor couldn’t get a reaction out of the Slytherin he changed tactics and took his potions homework out. Potter read it to Draco, who started every time Potter read false information aloud. Salazar, Potter was horrendous at potions. Draco flinched so often he was afraid he took permanent damage.
As soon as class was over, Draco fled the room. Thank Merlin and every deity there is, he wasn’t punished to handholding the entire day.
Quiet, that’s what King Lucius was. Lucius was very upset at Dracos antics and became angry. He stamped his feet and roared, “ARGH, this is going too far, son! It can't go on like this! Am I a king or am I not a king?”
But the professor was dead serious. “Now, Mr. Potter if you would take Mr. Malfoys hand, please.” Voice not tolerating any argument, McGonagall gestured from Harry to Malfoy.
Shortly after, the Aurors barged into the hospital, carrying a bloodied and unconscious Harry. Draco felt his stomach churn. When he wanted to go after Harry though, the chief healer stopped him. “No working on personal cases, Healer Potter. Go and try to rest a bit. Your husband is in good hands.”
In Potions Harry sat behind Malfoy. As Snape swept into the room – and questioned Harry something he didn’t know, took 5 points off Gryffindor and made a snide remark that the Golden Boy seemed to think he could live of fame alone instead of learning anything – Harry noticed that the blonde Slytherin hadn’t insulted him or pushed him in the hallway all day. Even the sneer Malfoy graced him with wasn’t that disdainful but almost showed genuine amusement.
“I promise. I’m never going to leave you again. I’m done with being a hero.” I murmured against his lips.
Back in London, Draco shooed them all into the ministry. Theo complained that all of them had to go, but he quickly shut up after Draco shot him a death glare venomously said, they had to come out of principle.
The blond looked suspiciously at the hut and turned his nose away. He had never seen anything so disgusting. Even the stable boys in his father's castle had better quarters.
“It’s great. It’s a job that demands a lot from me and it’s exhausting. But there are many interesting and funny things to see. I’m just so grateful, that I’m finally doing something good, that I can atone a little…How you like being an Auror? Didn’t get enough of chasing bad guys, did you?” Draco smirked, which Harry answered with a smirk of his own.
He entered the classroom and sighed. Hermione Granger was already there, parchment and quill ready to take notes. No surprise there. Well, another person Draco wanted to make amends with, so two birds with one stone, he guessed.
“You are so dumb, Potter. I thought it was pretty obvious. Of course, I love you, though it’s beyond me why, you dickhead.” Draco didn’t know how to feel. He was angry, relieved and very much in love. Merlin, this was embarrassing. He buried his head in his hands.
The rest of dinnertime passed silently until Luna got up and excused herself, “I’m going to look for nargles, now”, and floated away.
Ron and Hermione kept Harry from stirring up all of Gryffindor to join the search. They thought it better that the whole matter be handled discreetly. Ergo, the king was currently sitting in the throne room sulking.
I held Malfoys gaze, getting lost in the grey-blue spheres that were sparkling so mirthfully. Ron glared at Malfoy, hissed “Shut up, ferret face” and pushed me into my seat.
Harry meanwhile stood on the other side of the market in his knights uniform with Ron and observed the lively activity of the market.
He had never moved so much in his entire life. He had to chase Teddy first through the house and then through the yard repeatedly. Although he was utterly exhausted, he loved the little bundle of energy straightaway. If that’s what a family with Harry would be like, Draco couldn’t be happier.
Ron cackled. “Then everything would make so much more sense. Having long hair, wearing make-up. All you need is a skirt and you’d be a girl.”
"If you are still convinced afterwards that Draco has not changed, we will look for a solution. Together. But you cannot leave him alone." Hermione talked Harry into it.
At the beginning of the match Harry found himself entraced with the beautiful sight of Draco on his broom. He had skill and emited the same elegance in his movements in air as he did on the ground. Harry broke free from his daydreams reluctantly and focused on searching the snitch.
Potter stiffened and Draco absentmindedly kneaded his shoulders back into a more relaxed state. “No, I don’t have one. But that doesn’t mean I have no right to catch the flowers. That’s discrimination against single, gay people!”
Harry groaned and pulled his broom into a dive. So, yeah. He had started the fight, unprovoked. Now he had to analyze, what it all meant and what all those confusing feelings were, that he held towards Malfoy.
Snape narrowed his eyes at me and announced in a deathly calm voice, I was to receive detention for the next week and Gryffindor lost another 15 points.
The prince now studied his husband's face, which showed relaxed features. He noticed that the beggar did not look as rough as he appeared at first sight. The wild black hair looked like soft feathers and Draco felt the urge to run his fingers through it. The tanned skin was evidence of many hours of work in the sun and reminded Draco of liquid caramel. A satisfied smile surrounded the full lips. The beard made an attractive masculine sight. His fir green eyes glittered in the glow of fire. Only the red scar that flashed across the beggar's forehead disturbed the man's lovely sight.
“Sorry, that’s not possible. My husband has to stay very close to me most of the time in the beginning of the bond. So, you can’t have him.” Harry said sternly and grabbed onto Dracos other arm.
I know, I shouldn’t touch him. Know, I should stay suspicious, show constant vigilance. Malfoy could be a really good actor and deceive me. But I want to believe the feelings he showed me were real. I could see it in his eyes. His crystal clear, silver eyes with specks of ice blue were so damn expressive, even when his whole face was an unreadable mask.
“His full name is Edward and he is four years old now. Right now, he really likes dragons, because we visited Charlie in Romania this summer. So, don’t worry, he already loves you, because I told him your name means ‘dragon’.” Harry reassured Draco, his hand never leaving the small of Dracos back as they walked from the apparition point towards Andromedas house.
“Okay, then I will take over that task for us both. I can teach you, if you like? I’ll show you housekeeping spells, too.”
But then his eyes fell on the king of Gryffindor himself and he was completely breathless. Draco had never seen such a beautiful man before. Was this the same man Draco had kissed and mocked so many weeks ago?
Harry definitely wasn’t imagining Malfoy in a skirt right now, nope. And it wasn’t sexy as hell, uh uh.
Sighing, Draco handed the bouquet to Aunt Cecile for safekeeping. “Guard the flowers with your life! I had to endure so many hardships to get it, it’s a very precious trophy!”
"Stop it! I can't hear it anymore!" he moaned. When he became aware of the full extent of his new life, he continued to cry. "I am to be pitied, but no one pities me. I feel bad. Very bad. Terribly bad! And I will never get better!"
'What's going on here? I am confused...' thought Draco and could not take his eyes off the Gryffindor King. He was so dizzy, he felt like he was going to faint.
And Potter certainly did not love him back. How could he love someone like him? Both as a prince and as a beggar he was incapable of anything.
He was used to being the center of Malfoys attention und without it, he kind of…missed it. Harry was waiting for an opportunity to touch Malfoy, to reassure himself, that Malfoy was indeed real and not just a picture of imagination.
“John Holt. Pleasure to meet you” he stuck out his hand. Draco shook it. Johns fingers caressed Draco’s hand when he let go. John was really good looking. Draco smirked, “Mmh, we’ll see about the pleasure part.”
Hermione made a “tch”-sound. “Why won’t you ask him out like a mature person? You’re not a kindergartener!”
Hermione got to the front an began her lecture. “Marshall B. Rosenberg developed four basic steps of non-violent communication. These are observation, feeling, need and request. Based on these four aspects, sentences can be formulated that should not trigger aggression in the communication partner. Above all, it is important not to make any accusations, i.e. not to use sentences with "You have...". Rather, the conflict situation should be described as factually as possible and how this conflict affects one's own feelings. In addition, one's own needs should be addressed directly and expressed in a request instead of hiding them indirectly in appeals.“
“Great. Hi, I’m Harry.” Potter held out his hand and smiled softly. Draco, taking the offered hand tentatively, said “Hello Harry, I’m Draco.” They held their gazes and squeezed their hands for a minute until it became awkward.
Petting Draco gently on the head, Lucius said, “We knew, you didn’t want to marry Astoria. We just thought, a family of your own, children, would make you happy. I can’t say, I’m not disappointed because of your actions. But no matter what, you will always be our son whom we are proud of.”
“Noooo, I just hold onto it, so you don’t fall off.” Harrys said matter of factly. As if. Draco didn’t believe one word.
“Well, your father first properly threatened me if I ever hurt you, saying ‘don’t think, I can’t make your life a living hell, Potter, just because I’m old and you defeated the Dark Lord’. I have to say, I saw a lot of scary things and never was afraid of Lucius, but at that moment, I felt a little chill up my spine.” Harry shuddered a bit, remembering the sharp look in Lucius eyes. That had to be the power of a parents love.
“Furthermore, Harry, you don’t have a reason to be ashamed. In fact, in the wizarding world homosexuality is a common occurrence. One famous gay wizard, for example, was Professor Dumbledore, who–“
Of course King Lucius, brilliant ruler and ingenious planner he was, did not want to give his son and sole heir away to a beggar. After a few weeks in poverty, he would take him back and dissolve the marriage. Then Draco would hopefully be more obedient and could be sold to a good match.
“Wha’ ifff”, Ron gulped and took an in contrast to his crude eating habits delicate sip of pumpkin juice. “What if you ‘accidentally’ push Malfoy a tiiiiny little bit, so you have to hold hands again?”
“Can I meet him, soon?” Draco had heard of his estranged aunt and that his cousin Nymphadora had died during the war, leaving a baby boy behind. He was always curious about this side of his family but hadn’t had the courage to contact them.
In the warm arms of the cook, Draco collapsed once more. He had just lost his home, the place where he could be himself for the first time. And he had also left his first love behind. Only now did he realize the feeling for what it was and that to love sometimes meant to let go. And that was exactly what he was doing now. He had left the beggar because he loved him and wished a better life for him.
“Ronald Bilius Weasley, are you a sexist?” Hermione asked deadly calm. “He called Malfoy a poof, too” Harry helpfully supplied.
I just stood in disbelief. But really, I should have seen it coming. Malfoy was foul like that. He believed it to be necessary to publicly trouble me to save his bad image, so his parents wouldn’t find out his turn to the light side.
Except, the school year so far wasn’t that normal. Draco Malfoy for example wasn’t antagonistic at all. Well, at least not to Harry. To everybody else he was still the insufferable, foul mouthed brat he was before. But he ignored Harry and seemed to actively avoid him. It irked Harry to no end.
After dinner, Harry took Dracos hand and guided him outside. “The cinema is only a short walk from here.”
"You could have hurt him badly! And if he really didn't want to live as a beggar any longer, he would have gone with one of the noblemen. But he stayed at the stall and kept selling pots!"
Draco was content with ignoring his crush, really. But then Potter had to go and punch him. And Draco could accept having one sided feelings, yes. But crushing on someone who gave a shit to his feelings and punched him, was something Draco couldn’t accept. So, he fought back and then had to held Potters bloody hand the entire day!
Harry hit Ron in the shoulder. Ron shoved him in return. Hermione stopped them from beginning a playful brawl by hitting them both on the head. “Don’t be violent, boys.”
Despite distractions in the kitchen and all the new things he could learn from Molly, the prince often thought back to his Potter and the hut. Whenever grief threatened to overwhelm him, he would simply cut a few onions. The tears that flowed left Molly well knowingly uncommented.
When Draco arrived at the market, there was a lot of activity. He was amazed at the variety of the different stalls. He saw vegetables, meat, fish, fruit, but also textiles, books, jewelry. The sellers shouted very loudly to draw attention to their stalls and praised their goods. The people cavorted like ants in the market.
Satisfied, the blond took the pot from the fire and put it on the table where the beggar was already sitting. It was a bit too salty, but Draco was so hungry that he devoured the sparse meal greedily. The beggar watched with a gentle smile as his husband ate enthusiastically.
“It’s also natural to be attracted to Malfoy. He is very handsome with that blond hair and aristocratic bone structure.” Hermione sighed dreamily and Ron made a noise sounding like a dying whale. Hermione cleared her throat. “Anyway, we are your best friends, of course we support you, even if you want to get romantically involved with Malfoy.”
McGonagall turned around swiftly and fixed both boys with a hard glare. Then she grabbed each boys ear and dragged them not too gently into her office.
“First of all, Draco, did you finish some badges?” Draco flushed and gave Luna a badge for inspection. “They are wonderful, Draco. You really are skilled. It must have taken a lot of time and effort to make one.” Luna praised and pinned the badge on her sleeve.
“Sit.” She demanded and they obeyed. McGonagall seemed pretty pissed off and if she was angry, she was even more frightening then Snape.
A breath of air made him tremble and he noticed that he was still stark naked. And suddenly he could no longer hold back the tears.
“I won’t make any such promises. Obviously I drank so much, I have no recollection of what happened. But judging by there being a stranger here and my arse hurting that fucking much, I just lost my virginity on my stag night! I’m surprised I’m not panicking yet. Now, help me get rid of the man in my bed!”
Draco looked at his feet when he answered. „Father wasn’t very pleased that I defied becoming a Death Eater by leaving no space for the Dark Mark on my arms. I told him I wasn’t going to bow my head for anyone. I have my pride in being a Malfoy and Malfoys don’t kiss the shoes of anyone especially not of lunatics.“
Eagerly, the men approached without giving the goods even one slight glance. "This is very nice tableware. Did you make it yourself?" said the man with light brown hair.
When the beggar took Draco away, Lucius had not sent anyone after him to find out where his son was taken. And now he couldn't find Draco and couldn't bring him back either.
When the two men entered the library, she looked up from her big tome. At the sight of her friend dressed in rags, she raised an eyebrow questioningly. "What have you done this time, Harry?"
Draco felt sick since their anniversary party and didn’t know, what kind of disease it was. And he was a Healer, he should know! If he didn’t know better, he would say he was pregnant. All symptoms seemed to point in that direction. But it was impossible, he was a man after all.
He moaned, "Stop. I can't go on. My feet hurt. My dress is already torn. Alas. My hair's all mussed up."
Merlin, Draco felt miserable. He not only lost his virginity to his unrequited love interest, but he lost his family. And of course, he lost whatever little was left of his dignity after war. He lost all to Potter, who didn’t lose anything. Who married Draco on a whim, as a joke, because it was fun.
That’s exactly how Harry found them, when he ran into the room wand at the ready. “I heard you both shrieking, are you alright?” When he couldn’t find a source of threat, his eyes rested on Astoria and Draco, entangled and flushed on the floor. “Uhm, did I interrupt something?” Harrys nostrils flared for a short moment and there was a dangerous glint to his eyes.
Harry seemed to consider something before nodding, “Okay. I’m making dinner.” With that he left Draco alone to his confusing thoughts.
“Oh, yes. That’s because Luna installed that new club that Draco and I joined yesterday.” Hermione piped in.
Potter tightened his hold on Draco and growled against Draco’s lips. “Mister Malfoy, you’re under arrest–“ Potter kissed Draco harshly “–for too much sexiness.” Then he apparated.
Since the beginning of the new school year – the so called eighth year for some people after the war – Harry was feeling frustrated and depressed because of Malfoy rather often. So, he went flying a lot, too. It was becoming a routine.
“Why, thank you, Greg, I hadn’t noticed” Draco would’ve rolled his eyes if his head wasn’t killing him so much. Greg inclined his head as if to say ‘You’re welcome’.
“Yes, I would like that.” Harry smiled and kissed Dracos hand, making the blond blush. “I want you to properly meet the Weasleys, too. They are my family, after all. We’ll talk about it tomorrow. But for now, we both need sleep. It was a long, eventful day.” Harry retracted his hand and Draco suddenly felt cold.
„Oh, finally!“ Neville exclaimed and took a piece of parchment out of his robe pocket. He unfolded the paper and began to read very gravely. “Harry. I cannot stand idly by –”
While the Gryffindorks choked and spluttered, Potter didn’t disagree with Draco’s statement. Rather, he seemed kind of pleased.
The prince got down to work, but only because he was very hungry. The stove smoked heavily, the water was pouring out of his hand.
After setting Draco down in the middle of the sparse room, he pointed in the direction of the fireplace and said, "Heat the stove. Cook soup on the cooker and make up our bed where we both sleep".
Draco blanched, then turned pink. No man had ever spoken to him like that before. "G-go out the door f-first," he stammered. For safety, he added, "And close your eyes!"
“Step forward, Lord Lockhart. And fear not, I am with you”, said Lucius and stood before his son to shield him from the Lord.
‘What?’, Draco took a step back in shock. The black-haired man was not here for him. ‘He is only interested in politics. He's just like everybody else.’ Draco thought bitterly.
The potions class continued rather peaceful. Until Snape made his final round. Malfoy took some fuzzy looking ingredient and tossed it in our cauldron which immediately exploded and covered Snape who just turned in our direction, in stinking green slime.
“Hermione, just so you know, I spoke with Ron just now and, uhm” he fidgeted, fingers playing with the sleeves of his robe, “I realized, that I kind of like Malfoy.”
Draco stared impatiently at the door. Behind him, the party was at its peak. The Weird Sisters were blaring trough the stereo, people were dancing excessively or chattering enthusiastically. All inhibitions were lost thanks to Luna’s special punch. It was a very dangerous drink which made you feel woozy with just one glass.
“Arithmancy” Malfoy answered shortly and took the lead by walking determinedly in long strides, dragging Harry with him. Thankfully, they didn’t encounter many students on their way.
Harry grinned impishly and gave Draco a little kiss on the tip of his nose. Then he stood up and said, "I'll show you how to make pottery now."
“All your limbs are clattering. And it squeaks that you cannot hear your own word”, Draco shouted over the noise.
But I meant it to. I really was done being the Chosen One, the saviour. So I said “Is a wedding vow sufficient enough or do you want me take an unbreakable vow?”
Draco stared at her blankly, then led his head fall against the table. “Father is going to kill me”, he mumbled, voice muffled from the tablecloth.
“Oh, spare me, Draco. I know, you’re sorry, but that’s not what I want to hear. We both knew there wouldn’t be that kind of love in our relationship, since you told me you’re gay right from the start. I realized, you would probably have your side affairs and ignore mine. It took me by surprise though, that you got married without telling me. I thought we had a good basis for a marriage, since we’re friends.” Astoria waved him off.
But even those disgusting noble men had pride. And Draco planned to hurt that stupid pride so badly, that not even his beauty could compensate it. The blonde prince was a master of nasty words and he was going to use this talent until no one wanted to marry him. He just had to be careful not to accidentally start a war. But even that was only a small price to pay if he could accomplish his freedom.
Harry gasped. “I can’t do that! His hair is perfect! And Draco takes pride in his hair, if I say something, he will hate me until I die a painful death.”
Harry gaped at her. His ex-girlfriend was getting the hots for Harry and his rival? Well, ok. Maybe, he himself had had some strange dreams, starring him with a blonde man, wrestling each other and feeling each other up. And maybe, there was a slight chance that Harry wasn’t opposed to find out what it would feel like to be pressed against Malfoy in passion. And admittedly, the contrast between Harry’s bronze skin and dark hair and Malfoy’s fair complexion could look pretty good, purely objectively, of course. So, yeah, Harry could admit the appeal from a bystander’s point of view. But Ginny didn’t have to point it out so rudely.
Wait, his bum felt very warm and there was a certain pressure. “Are you groping my ass?” Draco asked incredulously.
Finally he kissed me. He poured all the desperation he felt into that kiss, while I tried to reassure him, that we were both alive and safe.
“I’m getting there, mate. What else do you feel? What did you feel, when you held Malfoys hand?” Ron asked gently. He could just tell Harry, what he thought, Harry was feeling. But Hermione taught him, that it was better if people came to the realization themselves.
“Survived your intervention, I see” Draco smirked up at Harry who only nodded, feeling suddenly shy.
Quickly one after another fled the castle. Such when Draco returned to the hall a little out of breath from chasing a Count named Creevey with a young childish face all around the castle in a game of tag while constantly throwing insults, only three candidates remained.
“No”, Draco answered flatly. He would never be ready to face Astorias wrath. She was a cute, little woman and Draco loved her like a sister. But when she was angry, Draco felt more cowardly than he had before the Dark Lord.
Hermione swished her wand and a big banner with the title “INTERVENTION” unfolded itself above the hearth.
Harry looked up into silver eyes as the needles bore into his chest. „I love you“, he said to the blonde man who smiled back and whispered „I love you, too. Forever“ while the stars of the dragon constellation were engraved on Harrys skin.
“I know no fear. Would I have remained victorious in 100 battles otherwise?” A man with blond wavy hair and silver armor stepped forward confidently. “Prince!” His visor fell down, so that his next words could only be heard in a subdued manner. “Prince, you will be my bride!”, Lockhart demanded in a muffled voice.
“My, all the fucking last night and you still don’t have enough? You’re insatiable, dear” Potter grinned and fucking winked at Draco. The blonde flushed a bright red. He was going to hex him. Fuck all those muggles around him, he would hex the living daylights out of Potter.
“We thought it was a good idea at the time. You don’t really want to marry Astoria, Weasley said Potter is always swarmed with fans…Your and Potters wedding will prevent you from marrying Astoria and will hold Potters fans back. It’s a win-win”, Pansy tried to explain.
He looked again at the Slytherin table and met silver eyes. Harry was prepared for a glaring duel and open animosity in the grey stormy orbits. So he was surprised to find nothing but honest curiosity in those silver pools.
Then the prince went into the forest and picked berries. Under a bush he heard excited clucking and chickens were running wild. Draco laughed in delight and took some eggs from the nests. In the hut he found flour and sugar.
Harry laughed. “What the fuck, Potter!?” Draco yelled. Harry laughing at Dracos misery was too much.
The beggar rolled his eyes and lifted Draco into his arms. The prince cried out in surprise and resisted. But the beggar was surprisingly strong and did not give in. With a cheeky grin he said, "I forgot, we are newlyweds", and carried him bridal style over the threshold.
Luna pulled Draco to her side and began to make some room at her stand. After the initial overstrain, Draco got back on his senses. "Thank you, but I can do it alone," he hissed and snatched his arm away from Lunas grip. What was this girl thinking of, patronizing him like that?
“Potter, what the fuck!” Finally, Draco didn’t blink anymore. “We are wizards, what are silencing charms for? I’ve put up a dozen before the party began.”
'Oh, what misery! How stupid and useless I am! I do nothing right. No one loves me', cried the prince.
“Aha. I can see it on your faces”, Draco sayed in despise. “Just put yourself and your wine away. And take comfort in a barrel, because barrels belong to barrels and not to me.”
Completely unaffected by these worries was Draco in the kitchen. He had heard about the wedding plans of the Gryffindor King and there was a lot to do in the kitchen, because a huge banquet had to be prepared. The cook was totally enthusiastic and talked about nothing else for hours.
Draco shook his head. “I went with Pansy and Blaise once. It certainly was interesting, ‘Lord of the Rings’ or something? I liked the scenery, but the movie was tiring in between.”
Potter prodded him the entire lessons with questions like “Were you always lefthanded?”, “When was the first time you flew on a broom?” and “My favorite color is yellow. Your favorite color is green, right? You know, what else is green? My eyes!”
“I can research theories on non-violent communication and strategies.” Hermione said. Gosh, Draco knew she would find something to get excited over in this dumb club.
So the beggar pulled the prince on and on. They walked past rich fields and through beautiful forests. They also crossed a river with clear water and happily bobbing fish. Even the Slytherin prince did not cease to be amazed.
Hermione seemed to have quite different concerns. "Where is Draco now? Have you taken him to the castle yet?"
Last year Harold got a glimpse of Draco. He was visiting the enemy country to renew the peace treaty and saw the Slytherin prince flantering in the gardens and feeding the peacocks. In the bright sun the prince looked like an angel with his gold-silver hair, his fair skin and slim body. Harolds heart began to beat furiously and he felt his face flushing. He never felt like this before. This must have been love at first sight.
“I’m a cursebreaker and your bond with Harry really is interesting. Mind if I ask you a few questions and perform a few spells?” Bill asked. He seemed alright for a Weasley, so Draco nodded.
But Draco found just as quick a snide remark to reject the tall duke. “Long and thin has little in,” the Prince sneered.
The next day at breakfast the Slytherin went to Luna and expressed his gratitude for the advice. He said he never slept so good and wanted to braid her hair as thanks. Since then Luna had spectacular hairdos whereas Draco was regularly seen with rather chaotic braids and pigtails – which looked really cute – and a neckless of radishes and beer corks matching Lunas.
Blaise handed the potion over and Draco drowned it greedily. He felt his head clearing, but wasn’t so sure, he liked it. He had a sudden sense of dread.
Every morning before he left the house Harry would press his lips against Dracos, delighting in the blush that graced the princes cheeks. Occasionally when Harry brought home flowers or a new book Draco would reward him with a shy kiss on the cheek.
”For Salazars sake, son, behave!“ Lucius hissed quietly to his son. Then he called the first marriage candidate to the front with a forced laugh, “Isn’t he beautiful, Sir Noble of Crabbe? Please come forward.”
Malfoy was such a drama queen, painfully demanding, always fighting with me, a right prat. He could kill my nerves. But what had me dying a little bit every time I was near him was that killer body. I mean, just look at that swaying hips!
He had never had to cook before and was easily overwhelmed with his task. But he was too proud to ask the beggar for help. Besides, in the castle he had sometimes watched the cook when he sneaked into the kitchen to snack a little something. The whole thing could not be that difficult. He put some millet into the small pot and poured salt into it.
„If I wasn't non-violent since yesterday, I'd punch you in the face right now.“ Malfoy grumbled and finally turned to face them. Though he only had eyes for Ron and was totally ignoring Harry. Harry felt an unpleasant twist in his stomach.
Granger narrowed her eyes at Draco but nodded. She huffed indignantly and Draco knew he had won the argument. Granger would never be accused of discriminating against others.
"When you've complained enough, you can sit down at the spinning wheel and spin a thread. Then you weave it into a cloth and from the cloth you make a skirt," said the beggar.
Malfoys face was a pretty shade of pink, Harry noticed. Totally different from the angry red Rons cheeks would flush, when he was agitated.
The other boys face was a lovely shade of pink that reached up to his ears. He seemed just as giddy as Harry felt.
Malfoy didn’t even say something mean. He just kind of pointed out Nevilles flaws to guide him into salvaging the potion. Malfoy was helping Neville. When Harry approached them, determined to get a reaction out of Malfoy, the blonde looked up. Meeting Harrys eyes for the first time this school year, the Slytherin was too distracted to stir Nevilles bubbling potion, so it exploded.
“Yes, I am”, said Harry and brought the hand Draco hadn’t realized he was still holding to his lips.
“I’m so sorry, Draco”, cried Hermione. Sighing Draco got up and hugged her. “Don’t be. Somehow, all your shitty spellcasting is the best thing, that happened to me in my life. I can’t even scold you properly! It’s all your fault, that I’m so happy right now.” He kissed her cheek and whispered “Thank you for giving me this family.”
Draco soon relaxed and found, he enjoyed himself immensely. After the warm and overwhelming welcome he got to know each of the Weasleys and came to the conclusion, that they were nice to be around. Even talking to Ronald was pleasant.
Fake gasping and widening his eyes in shock, Malfoy pushed me in the chest and screamed “Potter, I said don’t touch anything!”
Harry lay his free hand over his heart. “Malfoy, you hurt me! I swear I am a gentleman and would never touch your underwear before we even kissed! So, whatever twisted your knickers, it couldn’t be me.” He then leaned towards Draco and whispered in his ear “Though I wouldn’t say no, if you wanted me getting in your pants.”
Annoyed, Draco huffed. Why does Potter have to be so bloody irritating and sexy when he opens his mouth. “Well, aren’t you rudeness, and sarcasm and everything – Oh…” Draco faltered and blushed heavily.
Stunned, Harry said "Hate you? What makes you think so? Everything I did, I did out of love for you. Your father wanted to give you to a beggar. I could not let another man have you. So I took my chance and disguised myself as a beggar. Before I took you to my country as king beside me, I wanted to teach you a little lesson. You seemed to me so arrogant as a prince, and through the beggar's life you should learn respect for people below your status."
“Just dress casually. I have already a few fancy dates in mind, but the first will be the classic cinema visit.”
Harry breathed a sigh of relief and embraced Draco. But then he remembered something and he stilled. With a tense voice, he asked, "Draco, do you love me back?"
“Please tell me, you instructed Colin to take lots of pictures! I have to print that image on a t-shirt!” Seamus wheezed when he got his laughter in control.
Harry wasn’t tired at all, though he had to run around just as much as Draco. Harry gave Draco a cocky grin “Maybe you should work out a little, you don’t have any muscles at all.”
Not only did the prince's cooking skills improve. Draco's relationship with the beggar also changed significantly. Draco found in Harry a pleasant conversational partner who was able to hold an amazing intellectual discourse. Harry was not only smart but witty, too and the prince couldn’t help but feel utterly charmed. Though he sometimes wondered how a mere beggar could have become that educated.
Voldemort was just pathetic, really. Couldn’t get it done twice now. And then he lets someone check whether I’m dead. So, he himself doesn’t believe in his magic. How someone so low level could become leader to a bunch of stuck up bigots puzzles me.
Full of self-confidence he had promised Potter this morning to sell everything. Now most of the merchandise was destroyed. Draco had sold quite a bit, but he felt like he was empty-handed. All his work, and that of the beggar, had simply crumbled to dust.
She knew that Draco wasn’t fond of going anywhere but the kitchen. But there were too many guests, too much food and not enough staff in the castle. And when Molly asked Draco for something, he could not refuse the warm-hearted woman anything.
Out of sheer pride and defiance, Draco had refused to admit to the beggar that he had no idea how thread was spun from wool. Not to mention the weaving of thread into fabric. But it couldn't be that difficult if the rabble could do it with simplicity.
Jealousy rose in Harry and made his body shake with rage. Only Rons hand on his shoulder held Harry back from angrily stomping to the stall and beating the men up.
With his fingers in his ears King Lucius slowly approached the prince. He motioned the guards who sneaked up cautiously as not to scare away their prey. The guards were glad to wear armour, because the prince was known for biting.
"Yes, I am married, and soon you shall see my hearts Chosen One. Be patient a little longer. Music!"
Then a rough voice rang out from the courtyard and came up to him. "I thank you, Prince, but throw down the second slipper so that I can sell the pair at the market!"
“How old is Teddy again? Teddy isn’t his real name, is it?” Draco was excited to meet his cousin and estranged aunt. He had heard some things about her from his mother, when she told him about her childhood. Mother always had a wistful look, when she talked about it.
“No, but I’m certain she figured it out. In fact, I think all of Hogwarts already knew about your feelings before you did. You’re not very subtle, Harry. And I told Pansy, because she was the one who gave me the idea for the intervention. Apparently, all of Slytherin had one for Malfoy and it helped.”
Five minutes later, Hermione entered the bathroom, looking slightly sick herself. Ron and Harry followed closely behind.
“I’ll make breakfast, if you can wait a few minutes?” the Gryffindor asked as he got out of the bed and discarded his sleeping shirt.
The next day, Draco felt like in trance. He went to work, though Astoria had tried to persuade him to take a day off. Last night was spend with a lot of crying, eating ice cream and stopping Astoria from running on a rampage and burn Harrys flat down. Draco was utterly exhausted, but he needed work as a distraction.
Laying restless and awake in bed for hours, Harry had mulled over what his friends had said. Thinking about it carefully, Harry came to conclude that he indeed harbored feelings of the romantic sort for Draco. Yes, it was Draco now. Because he couldn’t call his love interest by their last name, could he?
The King of Gryffindor stood there in full splendor and completely out of breath. Gasping for air, he ordered all the kitchen staff out.
Surprisingly, Potter made a fine dance partner. He reacted wonderfully to Draco’s leading, not stepping once on Draco’s toes. Draco had to admit, he was having quite a great deal of fun. Judging by Potter’s smile, he was having a lot of fun, too.
What Harry was going to say was, Malfoy waltzed around Hogwarts like he owned the place, making everybody swoon over him. Because girls and apparently some boys really liked the bad boy image Draco got after the war and broke out in excited squeals whenever he insulted or glared at them.
Harry shrank from her rage. Though Harry had successfully fought a war and defeated the brutal warrior Voldemort, an angry Hermione Granger was more terrifying than all the horrors of the world.
“If you struggle that much, you’ll fall down.” When Draco didn’t stop trying to wriggle free, Harry threw him over his shoulder. The blond huffed indignantly. His sudden dizziness was because the blood was rushing to his head and definitely not because he had a spectacular view of Harry’s backside.
„Something is different“, Harry said to Ron and Hermione at the breakfast table. ‚Totally different’, he thought as he stared across the room at a certain blonde boy.
Harry couldn’t help the hopeful smile that stretched across his face. He offered his hand and suggested “Maybe we can be oblivious together. If you would like to?”
The next day, Harry wandered the halls of Hogwarts. It was very early in the morning and the probability to run into someone was very low. Harry was dead tired but was too nervous to sleep.
“Great. Secondly, we’re spreading the love between the students. If we see bullying or conflicts we act as dispute mediators and show people how to solve conflicts non-violently. And we try to get more friends, who join the club. So, any ideas of how we achieve that?” Draco had liked the dreamy and airheaded Luna better.
At least he was in his own hotel room judging by the suitcases and scattered clothes. Finding his wand, he conjured his Patronus and send it to Blaise, so he would come and rescue him with hangover potion and disposing of the man in his bed.
"Oh, I am so happy. A wedding at last. My sweet little Harry is growing up. Hah, I can hardly believe it. I remember the first time he came into my kitchen. He looked so small and starved. That this skinny boy would grow up to be such a gorgeous man! And now he's getting married! Our Harry Potter!" chattered Molly as she chased all the kitchen staff back and forth.
Harry had tackled Malfoy to shield the potion from him. Saddling the blonde, Harry realized he just had rescued him. Confused about what it meant, relieved to finally touch Malfoy and panicking because he
Harry gave Malfoy an appraising look. Ah, he finally cracked. “I don’t know, what you mean, Malfoy. I’m just trying to do the adult thing and have a conversation with you. But you keep dodging me.”
“Yeah, Neville, I know. That’s the problem, really. I’m just so confused. Malfoy ignores me all year and now he is helping people he always mocked? And, and…he won’t even look at me! And now I have to hold his hand all day and his hand is so soft and delicate, they feel so wrong in my calloused hands, but also kinda right? And did you know, Malfoy is lefthanded? How did I never notice this before? I mean, I know his favorite color is a dark forest green, almost black, and I know how he likes his tea, but I didn’t know he’s lefthanded?”
That had everybody laughing because the idea was just absurd. But Neville grinned and said “In fact, Draco is going to wear a pink dress, with lots of bows and frills.” Everybody choked on their tea at that.
"Too late. You've already given him to me as husband." Harry showed the wooden rings he and Draco wore on their fingers.
"What is there to laugh at? Business is bad. And what have you done?", the black-haired man asked in a crunch.
Luna leaned towards him and whispered, “Harry is staring really hard at you. I bet he thinks you’re cute, too.”
Dracos cheeks were now a rosy colour. They must have stared at each other for quite a few minutes, because Hermione broke their muffliato and said “Time’s up. We’re done for today.”
“Nonsense. I have to admit, I would never have dreamed of seeing the wizarding worlds saviour strip for a living, especially with your atrocious dancing skills – I just say Yule Ball! But if anyone can pull it off, it’s you. You never seize to surprise me, Potter.” Draco dragged the black-haired man further down the hall.
“See something funny, Potter?” the Slytherin sneered. Draco was minding his own business, ignoring Potter successfully for two full days, slowly being able to forget the feeling of Potters hand in his and then the idiot had to push him right in front of the DADA teacher.
Harry sighed the password sadly and climbed into the Gryffindor common room. He wanted nothing more than to take a hot shower and curl up under a bunch of blankets to sleep, but he pulled himself together to say a quick hello to his friends. Hermione was rather adamant about Harry telling her where he went and that he came back safely.
He was just shuffling to the corner he, Ron and Hermione usually occupied when he realized something was wrong. For one thing, Luna and Ginny were also in their regular spot, but that was not an unusual sight. What was unusual, however, was that his friends instantly fell silent when they saw him coming. They stood up and turned to face Harry. They all looked very serious and held each a piece of parchment in hand. Now Harry began to worry. He frowned and asked suspiciously, “What is going on?“
“And you couldn’t just talk to me like a normal person? You know, we’re forced to hold hands right now, yes?”
“You are aware that clothing and valuing one’s appearance don’t define gender, yes? And calling someone by a degrading name, just because his sexual orientation deviates from your own is the same as calling me ‘mudblood’. So, Ron, tell me, do I have to hit some sense into your head with this book or am I misunderstanding something?” Harry suppressed to comment on Hermione breaking her non-violence-clubs commitment.
Hermione pouted. “That were the main points! You should be grateful, I cut it down to this. I even left out the charts and diagrams I made!” She huffed indignantly and took her seat next to Ron again, who consoling patted her hand.
Harry immediately discarded his heated decision never to face the blond prince again. His anger and disappointment crumbled at the thought of Draco sitting helplessly in the hut, alone and totally frightened.
It was a good idea, Draco would be free. Well, now that he wasn’t so pure anymore, no pureblood in his good mind would marry him now. Even divorced he would bring only more shame to the family, because divorce meant failure. And Draco couldn’t stay married to Potter, Potter would never go with it. And his father would never forgive Draco not following the will of his parents and bringing shame to the family by divorcing the most beloved wizard in Britain. Surely, he would be outcasted.
“Silence!”, King Lucius barked. “You have two suitors left. Draco, you will choose one of them. THAT is my final word!”
As Ron, Hermione and I went out of the dungeons to our next class, Ron muttered “Told you, mate. He will always be a git. You’re sleeping with the enemy.”
Snape came strutting to the front, deducting points from Gryffindor because I had the audacity to open my book before waiting for Snapes instructions. I never thought the day would come I would enjoy potions. But today was the day!
When Harry just blushed and didn’t deny it, Draco’s laughter died. The blond’s cheeks coloured bright red.
“Oh, Draco just lend me his chapstick before you came in”, she pointed in his direction. Malfoy sat a few tables away from them and looked up. Spotting the trio, he smirked. Malfoy blew a kiss at Ron and winked.
Harry seemed to consider this, undoubtedly remembering how scary an angry Hermione and Ginny could be. “I’d very much like to decline this most tempting offer, but I also want to get my soulmate back in one piece. So, I guess I have to use that Gryffindor courage of mine and be your saviour.”
Harold never got the chance to speak to Draco. But when he heard, that King Lucius was searching a befitting husband for his son, Harold saw his opportunity of wooing the angelic prince.
The ministry worker looked slightly overwhelmed as he let his gaze drift over the crowd before him. His eyes widened comically when they fell at Potter. “Ha-Harry Potter! It’s such an honor, to meet you!” He exclaimed.
Dracos cheeks got flaming hot. Even now, Potter had the audacity to make fun of him. Huffing, Draco threw a tripping jinx at him.
Ron and Neville cheered. “Finally”, Neville cried. “Way to go, mate”, Ron clapped Harry on the shoulder.
Meanwhile, the castles kitchen was in a state of uproar. Molly cooked all kinds of food to get the king to eat. But Harry remained stubborn and refused any food. Not even his favourite dishware with the Gryffindor crest could motivate him to eat. Draco's food was the only thing he wanted to eat. That is exactly what he muttered to himself as he pushed a chocolate cake away. Ron was convinced he had heard him mutter something of “treacle tart” and immediately passed the order on to the kitchen.
“Let’s start our meeting!” Luna exclaimed. “Remember, we’re all being friends here, so please call everybody by their first names. I would like to greet our newest member: welcome Harry!” Luna clapped her hands in applause.
Yes, you heard that right. Draco was bridesmaid. And yes, he would wear a dress to Blaise’s wedding. Yes, he lost a bet, but how could he know Blaise’s new stepfather would last only two months before dying!? Mrs. Zabini had said it was “true love” when Draco had come over for tea. Okay, the extremely loaded man was already hundredfourteen years old, but he was the blossoming life personified! It was just rude to die after only two months of marriage. He had bet Archibald would have lasted at least five months longer.
Unknowing of the events at Hogwarts Castle, the Slytherin prince sat down at the spinning wheel. So far, so good.
Oh. Draco didn't expect that. It sounded like a tempting offer. Never working again. Wear beautiful clothes all day long and eat the finest things. He could live like a prince again.
This was the perfect opportunity to answer with something smart and witty that would express Harry’s feelings while making him look cool simultaneously. But neither his brain nor his mouth seemed to be working. He was frozen in place. Where was his inner Gryffindor when he needed it?
Remembering third year, Hermione sighed heavily and said “Count me in, too. At least we can use this to inform people of creature equality, too.”
“Well, I think, you two look really good together, whatever your relationship is”, Luna winked at them, then took a bite of pudding and sighed contentedly.
After finally escaping the celebrating crowd Harry got into the locker room. Glad that his teammates already finished showering he undressed. He wanted some time alone to relive the match and think about Dracos smile.
Before Draco could reach me though, he was intercepted by Voldemort. “Potter’s already dead. But I appreciate the enthusiasm. I see, you have found the right way again. You will be a valuable asset in my ranks, Draco.” And with those words Voldemort embraced the blonde boy.
“You know, you’re hair shines silver in the moonlight, but at day it shines golden in the sun.” I whisper and kiss the top of his head.
“Relax, it’s going to be fine.” Harry ruffled through Dracos hair affectionately when the door opened to reveal a middle aged woman with wild brown locks and a little boy with turquoise hair at her hip.
Then, Harry kissed him hungrily, like he was starved for days and only Draco could satisfy his appetite. But Draco had to clear something first, before reciprocating. “So, you are not going to break the bond? You’re staying married to me?”
The beggar exclaimed, "I have heard the king's word and have come to fetch you! Our wedding will be today."
“Ehm, I’m not so sure, if I’m honest. I’m worried about my parents reaction to the marriage. I would feel better, if I didn’t have to face them alone, but your presence probably wouldn’t help the situation either.” Draco felt a little helpless. He was happy, Harry might give him a new future, but he was so afraid of losing his family.
Oh, that was…thoughtful. Sweet. “Well, you can stop that. I rather like it, when you’re not ignoring me.”
Apart from enjoying the peace and quiet in his castle, Lucius missed the brat a little. And if he already had to cope with the loss of a son, he would have expected at least a certain return in the form of riches. But gone was Lucius' chance to make a little profit with his son.
So, Draco did the sensible thing and fled. He ran straight to Potter, clutched onto his shoulders and hid behind his back.
“Oh, darling, I am mad. But not for what you did. I mean, I pity you, really. You’re bonded with your unrequited love, that’s shitty.” She patted Dracos leg. “Thanks for rubbing salt into the wound”, Draco frowned.
Armed with Ron’s advice (“Just talk wo him, mate.”) Harry went to pick Malfoy up from his Arithmancy class. Hermione was the first to exit the classroom.
Shit, Draco couldn’t say no to that puppy look. And he had to make amends! So if Luna wanted him as a friend, then dammit, he would be the best friend there is. Even if it means to “spread love”. Draco shivered. “Alright, Luna. I’m in.”
The beggar was clothed with all sorts of utensils and many instruments, and very submissively lifted his hat, which was already pierced. The beggar took a leap of air and screamed "IAH" like a donkey.
Ron and Harry met up with Hermione in the library. Hermione was hidden behind a stack of books, murmuring softly “Marshall B. Rosenberg, what a nice guy” and making notes.
“They kissed. He’s in love!”, Lucius said delighted. The Slytherin king was already counting the treasures of Hogwarts he could gain from this union.
When they emerged at the Weasleys home, they were greeted by a sea of red-heads looking at them curiously. Draco went rigid, staring at the people before him like a deer caught in headlights.
With little enthusiasm the prince sang. And he sang very badly. And he was even worse at dancing. The people shouted and roared with laughter.
Potter seemed angry – jealous? – but Draco didn’t have the time to think about it further because he spotted a woman with a black bob.
Before Prince Draco could protest – undoubtedly with another temper tantrum – King Lucius signaled and the guards captured the prince with a net. Effectively immobilised one brave guard picked up the prince and carried him princess style into his chambers. As soon as a few maids were also in the princes room it was barricaded and ten elite soldiers stood guard.
"Don't scold me. I have achieved nothing. I did not know how to spin. But I picked some berries and baked a pie."
The prince looked for this insolent voice and discovered under his window a beggar with a dishevelled beard and wild black hair, barefoot and dressed in rags.
“Let's get started, I'm in a hurry. Who's first? Step forward! Say your lines, I'm waiting.” To emphasize his limited nerves he began to tap his foot impatiently.
The Slytherin king cried out in rage throughout the kingdom. "My wayward son has driven all suitors away with scorn and derision. He did not want the best of men. Now he will have to take the first beggar that appears before the castle. That is my royal word. So mote it be."
“Merlin, no!” Draco exclaimed horrified and turned to the bed, followed by the Slytherins. He straddled the still peacefully sleeping man and lifted his face. With a shaking hand he brushed away the black locks from the mans forehead. And there it was: a lightning bolt.
Then it all crashed down on him again. He was married to a man, who didn’t love him back. A man, who slept with him because it was fun. Ah, yes. That feeling of humiliation was more like it. How long would it be, before Harry got fed up with him and wasn’t interested in having a soulmate anymore? Draco had hoped that Harry would come to love him eventually. But that wasn’t very realistic, was it? Because, what was there to love? Draco was an Ex-Death Eater, he had bullied Harry in school, he was a spoiled brat.
“Oh really? ‘Why is Malfoy kissing everybody but me?’, was it?” Hermione recited. Damn her and her attentiveness.
“I’m sorry, Harry. I thought it best not to tell you until the wedding. As best man and bridesmaid you have to spent some time closely together at the wedding and I didn’t want you to be upset about it or decline being my best man because of it. You two have a complicated history, after all. I thought, if you already were at the wedding you couldn’t back out when you saw him there.” Neville looked down at the floor in dismay.
"The castle of Thrushbeard?" asked Draco, startled. "I cannot go there. I wronged the King of Gryffindor some time ago."
“Kissed?”, the prince huffed. “Hah, he stabbed me with his pointy chin. I will have bruises on my face. Where did you get such a pointed chin? Such a chin, that should be forbidden.”
Draco shrugged and said “I’ll show you, I will sell everything we made!” And with a cheeky grin for farewell Draco made his way to town. Harry however took a shortcut to the castle and put on the Gryffindor knights uniform. Disguised as such he took his horse and rode to the towns market.
„Hermione Jean Granger! WhAT tHe FuCK did YoU dO?” Draco screeched, but was interrupted in beginning a tirade by throwing up again.
“So where is my groom? Now I am standing there and in front of me there are pieces of broken iron. A pile of junk all my happiness!” Draco tried whining and barely managed to hold in his laughter at the mess before his feet.
Harry, Ron and Hermione were back at Hogwarts for the so called eight year to finish their education. Harry was very excited, because finally he was once again at home. And without a dark wizard threatening his life at that! So, yey for normalcy!
“Now you’re a girl, too, Weasel. Have fun being infected by my repugnance”. He turned swiftly around and stalked out of the bathroom.
Harry sat down with Draco and searched for the right words. But just as he was about to start his speech, Draco interrupted him. "Have you come to humiliate me further? Is what you have done to me not enough? Do you hate me so much?"
“Kiss me again”, Draco breathed in a needy voice. Oh, the kiss was perfect. Harry ran his hand into the gold blond hair and felt with delight how a small hand wrapped around his neck. The kiss deepened as Harry snuck his tongue in Dracos mouth.
“G’morning” Harry said, voice still gruff from sleep. His hair was sticking up in all directions. Draco blushed and cleared his throat. “Good morning.”
“No, Ronald we’re not going to hug people. Well, I suppose Luna would hug people…The clubs purpose is to call attention to a peaceful and non-violent togetherness. Maybe you should join, too. It definitely wouldn’t hurt your language.” Hermione said patiently to her boyfriend.
Harry nodded and Draco took him to the room. “I will go see mother, we’re joining you both, soon, yeah?” With that Draco left Harry and his father alone.
In fact, the glittering blond hair of the prince stood out among exotic flower arrangements. He seemed to be a little overwhelmed by the flower girl's flow of speech, but kept his temper in check. Harry was very proud that his husband did not resort to insults. However, the prince's beautiful face seemed to be distorted in a sneer as he walked with his cart to the gate and set up his stall.
“That’s good, then. I myself slept most splendidly. I had a very nice dream.” Harry grinned. There was a glint in his eyes that Draco couldn’t quite decipher. Draco usually took pride in reading peoples emotions easily, but when it came to Harry he was lost.
“I’m fine.” Then Harry shook his head. “Actually, no, I’m not.” He sighed and let himself plop down next to Ron.
I really hated classes with Slytherins. I couldn’t hear a word of the lecture. All I could do was fantasize about what I would do to Malfoy, once we finally were alone.
"You shall have him, my good man. My word will not be broken”, Lucius – where did he even come from? – eagerly responded. ‘Finally a lowlife appeared. That will teach my son a lesson’, he thought with glee.
“What did you and my father speak about? You seemed to have got on incredibly well, against all expectations.” Draco rubbed his eyes sleepily. When he and mother came down to catch father and Harry for lunch, both men were laughing amicably and sharing a whisky.
I looked directly in Voldemorts red eyes and shrugged as if to say “Yep, I really am that dumb.” Resigned to my fate I sighed, “Hi, Tom.”
“It’s kinda too late, for that, Draco.” Theo piped up. “We send your wedding picture to the Prophet…”
Luna looked at the spot Draco pointed to and shook her head. "Better not go there. It's very dangerous because so many people walk there. Riders also pass by there. You'd better stay here with me."
I tried to figure out what I would do once Voldemort and his fanclub had finished parading their victory. It had to be something grand, something dramatic. Merlin, Draco was really rubbing off on me.
Potter was far too good for Draco. As a spoiled prince, he was just a millstone on the beggar's leg. Without him, Potter would surely be better off. So Draco decided not to return to the hut. Without him, the beggar would have a second chance to find someone who would suit him and could make him really happy.
Buffled Harry gaped at the snake tattoo that was wrapped around Dracos left arm protectively, shaking its head threatening.
“What is the next thing I can do?” asked Harry staring up at Ron like he held all the secrets of the world in his hands.
“You okay, Draco?” asked Greg worriedly when the blonde wrapped his blanket around him like a cocoon.
“That won’t do, baby. As much as I like to show everyone who you belong to, I rather not share you. I’m the only one who can see you exposed like that.” I said matter of factly.
All I know is, that I couldn’t care less, why it felt like so much more, because Draco began to move, making pretty noises. I helped, guiding hips up and down. Dracos stamina wasn’t the best, but before he could get too exhausted to move I flipped him over and thrust deliberate slowly into him, trying to convey to him how much I cherished him.
So far, so good. I was gambling on surviving the killing curse again. The Horcrux inside me was destroyed now. I had faith in Hermiones theory, even when Draco begged me to not take that risk.
Harry let his gaze drift to the frame of the grey eyes. Malfoys face was softer than he remembered. His white blonde hair got a little longer during the summer and was prevented from falling in his eyes by a half bun. One ear was adorned with a silver creole giving the blonde boy a cool and laid-back appearance. The smooth skin was so incredible pale that the red lips stand out. And damn, those lips looked totally kissable…
The King nodded and made his way to the small hut to talk to Draco. On the way, he realized that he had overreacted strongly. He owed Draco an apology and an explanation. The time had come for him to reveal his identity and his trick.
“Then I want the divorce right now!” the blonde demanded. “I’m going to get married in a week! Nobody can find out about this!”
Potter took Dracos hand. “I’m not. I’ve always had a certain interest in you. Though it wasn’t always positive, I’ll admit. I never saw you in that way, until last night. You had a striking presence, as always, but it was different from school.”
“I don’t care about Potter!” Draco spluttered. Luna gave him a sceptical look. “Of course you do, Draco. I call feel it in you aura” she said so seriously, that Draco sighed in defeat. “Alright, I give up” he pouted.
As the sun slowly bowed, Draco was sure his feet were bleeding. Heavens, he couldn't stand it any more. "I don't want, don't want, don't want any more!" Draco stomped his foot furiously.
But the beggar remained unimpressed by this outburst. "Then stay. The wolves will howl and the bears will growl. You will starve and the mosquitoes will bite you. Just stay." With these words, the beggar went on without even looking at Draco.
Arriving at the Arithmancy classroom, Malfoy dropped Harrys hand as if burned and fled into the room, sparing Harry not one glance.
The next thing Draco felt was an aching pain in his neck and shoulders. He must have fallen asleep with his head on Harry bed. Fingers were gently carding through his hair and Draco sat up abruptly. “You’re awake.”
Seeing the burly man lying so fragile in the hospital bed wrenched Dracos broken heart. He sat beside Harry and took his hand in his own. “I know, I’m inevitably going to lose you, Harry. But I will never forgive you, if I lose you like that, you reckless idiot.”
Draco discovered his love for cooking and with the book the beggar brought him one day, he improved his skills more and more. He enjoyed trying his hand in the kitchen. Especially the different reactions of amazement and admiration, which the beggar showed him with every new dish, pleased the prince.
“The name’s ‘Potter’ now, thank you.” Draco couldn’t resist the snippy reply and promptly hid himself behind Harrys back.
When Harry and Ron entered the bathroom after potions class, Harry spotted a blond head and his heart skipped a bit.
But Draco had spurned the king. He didn't want him, thank you very much. No riches in the world he wanted, he just wanted his beggar –Potter– back. But he couldn’t have this Potter either. Stupid Potter with his stupid hut and his stupid songs and his stupid smile.
“Oh, how wonderful. I thought nobody would come, but I already have two club members.” Lunas soft voice floated into the room.
When Malfoy cornered Ron against a wall once, asking if he wanted a taste of his chapstick, he was trying a new flavor, Harry had enough. He decided he had to do something. He really didn’t want to start a fight with Malfoy, but he had to confront the Slytherin somehow to get his attention.
“Don’t worry, they are very forgiving. And you are family now, they will welcome you warmly”, reassured Harry.
After weeks of careful observation he found the blonde to be nothing like the years before. The Slytherin was ready to help the underclassmen when they got lost in the labyrinth of stairs and corridors or when they needed tutoring for their homework.
„Come off it, Malfoy. How about neutral territory? Hufflepuff table?” Harry asked, internally preening that Malfoy finally spoke normally to him.
Draco felt himself getting used to his new life as the beggars husband and felt happier than ever before. Now he had a purpose and a special someone who seemed genuinely interested in him as a person not as a prince. He would never admit it, but he knew his feelings towards the beggar turned slowly into something that’s called love.
“You can readjust your hold any time, you need. But your hands will stick together otherwise, until I lift the charm tonight after dinner”, the professor explained.
“Hey, look. About the bond thing, how about staying at my place for the time being? You’re still living at the manor with your parents, right?” Potter inquired, rubbing his neck.
And like right now he was driving me mad with temptation. The way he licked his lips, flicked his hair back. Then laughed and exposed his elegant white neck. I wanted to bite it red, mark him for everyone to see who he belonged to. Just one kiss and I was addicted. He just tasted so good.
“He has temperament, I like that. It certainly wouldn’t get boring. I bet he’s just as wild in bed“, Harry grinned as Ron turned red faced.
He was interrupted from his thought by a plate full of scrambled eggs and bacon, which was held under his nose. “You coming to eat?” Harry asked and gestured towards the table. While eating Draco realized just how hungry he was. He stuffed his mouth enthusiastically and very unmalfoyish. A chuckling sound made him lose focus from his plate. He swallowed and asked accusingly “What?”
“Uhm.” Harry frantically searched for a name he could label all his emotions with. Had he ever felt so much for a person before?
They walked down the aisle arm in arm and wasn’t that just surreal? Weasley wolf-whistled then and Draco gave him the finger which gained some scandalous gasps from the audience.
That was a good question. Was he happy? A few hours ago, Draco thought he had lost everything. Now, he still had his parents and Harry wanted to try a relationship with him. It was more than Draco ever hoped for. “Yes, mother. I’m happy.” He smiled at Narcissa and tried to convey with his eyes, how much relief and hope he felt.
Before Draco could answer the flood of questions, Luna discovered the pots in Draco's cart. With a dreamy look, she exclaimed "Oh, what have you got there? That's so pretty. How much does it cost? Sit down with me, I'll make room for you! You're new here, let me help you."
Luna came very close to his face. “Your lips are a bit chapped, Draco. Here, have my lip balm. It’s cherry” she said cheerfully before getting up and leaving him to his own devices.
„Malfoy kissed me in the bathroom” Ron said sheepishly. “Only because you made fun of him and said you wanted to see him in a skirt.” Harry spat angrily.
Oh, the challenge was on. Draco would hold Potters hands, alright. He would show the Gryffindor he was superior in hand holding. And talking. Draco would talk so much, Potter will be filled with useless knowledge and opinions. “You wish”, he tried to sneer but his mouth twisted into a sincere smile.
The other candidates did not fare any better. One earl was too short – “Short and thick is never quick”. Another duke was too pale – “As pale as death. Are you sure you will last long enough to satisfy me?”
Teddy giggled. “Nobody calls me Edward, but I like you saying it.” He reached out a hand to grab at Dracos hair. His own hair turned platinum blond. “You’re so pretty, you don’t look like a ferret at all.”
Granger didn’t take his honest, heroic act well, though. She charged at him with a grim, determined expression that promised war. Draco was momentarily stunned, remembering Granger’s right hook, that broke his nose in third year and he knew that Granger would fight him for the bouquet the muggle way.
Draco, however, left all the excitement cold. What did he care about the king's wedding? Granted, this could have been his wedding. He could’ve had the handsome king and all the pomp. Stupid Potter with his stupid castle and his stupid lands and his stupid kissable lips.
Harry took the offered hand in his own as if it would explode any moment. McGonagall then swished her wand other their loosely joined hands.
He almost carried him, almost pulled him. Draco could move his legs no more. And so they finally arrived at what was now their home.
What would a beggar want with a proud prince? Even beggars are not that stupid. Draco was quite pleased about this fact.
“Professor, let me assure you, I am just as disappointed as you are. It was totally Potters fault. Potter started the fight out of nowhere and now my jaw is broken.” Malfoy said politely and gave Harry a dirty look.
Slowly, he regained confidence and decided to make himself useful and find something edible. In the evening he would ask the beggar to teach him something so he could work. Slytherins were very adapt and Draco would do anything to survive.
“Oh, Draco, you look a little stressed.” Luna greeted when she sat down across from Malfoy. She looked at Harry, then back to Malfoy again. While reaching towards the pudding plate she said airily “Don’t worry, he reciprocates your feelings.”
Draco knew, he couldn’t avoid Harry forever. At some point he had to see him to collect his things from the flat and to actually break the bond. Draco was glad, Harry was on a week long mission starting today. That gave him some time, to prepare himself mentally and get over the worst of his heartbreak.
“Wow. Look at you!” Potter whistled in appreciation. “Aren’t you sugar and spice and everything nice?”
While Neville poured him a cup of tea, Harry began to voice his problem. “Last week I had a case of nightly disturbance and where did I end up?” Neville’s eyes widened slightly and he had the decency to look sheepish. Harrys eyes flashed dangerously. “Exactly. At your fiancés stag night, organized by none other than Draco Malfoy who – apparently – is bridesmaid! I am your best man! Why haven’t you told me that Malfoy is bridesmaid?”
„Sure, Malfoy“, Potter shrugged and smirked. Potter, the prat, was smirking rather a lot today. It was a good look on him and Draco wanted to snog – eh, punch that smugness off Potter’s face.
Green eyes landed on him, sparkling mischievously. “Of course, Malfoy.” Potter took Dracos right hand and planted a wet kiss on his ring finger. “Or rather, Mr. Potter.”
In class Malfoy would shush him, and in between classes he dragged Harry into the library where he chose a table directly in front of Madam Pince who hissed menacingly every time Harry made to ask Malfoy something.
Before I could think of a catchphrase the procession stopped. Voldemort gleefully announced my death and chuckled when all Hogwarts students, professors and Order members gasped in shock and some people broke down in tears.
“I’m sorry. I’m just getting my things, then you won’t have to see me again.” Draco said, eyeing the carpet. He wasn’t ready to see the cold expression his father would give him.
He bent down to put on his high heels which made his legs endlessly long. For the finishing touch he put on some raspberry lipgloss and smacked his lips. He may be a fairy princess today, but he owned it. In fact, Draco planned to make at least five girls cry because he wore the dress and heels that much better.
Phew, now was the time for that famous Gryffindor courage. “The last few weeks, you didn’t speak to me or even look at me. I’m frustrated, because you ignore me. I feel hurt, because only I don’t seem to be worthy of your attention. Seeing you flirt with Ron of all people made me very angry and jealous, because I thought that you maybe like him. I really don’t want you to like Ron. I want you to like me. I want you to look at me and only at me. And most importantly, I want to taste your cherry lipstick. So please, kiss me?”
Well, wasn’t that a revelation, Draco thought and took another sip. Of course, one notices how ones enemy likes their tea, that’s valued information if you want to poison them.
Hermione realised that Harry was not to be dissuaded from his plan. As the two men went into the office to attend to the royal duties, she said quietly, "I very much hope nobody will be hurt.” Then she went after her friends.
The shiny raven-black hair fell in wild curls across his forehead. The green eyes shone so brightly that they rivaled the glow of the emeralds of the royal crown. The attractive stubbly beard had definitely not been there weeks ago. Over the broad shoulders fell a blood-red velvet cloak bordered with ermine. Underneath, the king wore a white silk shirt and black trousers.
Breaking free from his state of shock, Draco fell to his knees in front of the ruins. How could this happen? What could he do now? What would the beggar say?
“Are you ready?” Harry asked concerned. Draco stood in front of Astoria Greengrass’s door for solid five minutes.
Malfoy blushed prettily. “Of course I speak, you oaf. Just not to idiots like you, Potter.” He sniffed haughtily.
After I turned my daytime fantasies into reality, I’m mesmerized again by the beauty of the boy in my arms. The moonlight falling through the window lets him glow eerily. I hold him a bit tighter, just to be sure, he’s real.
"Don't whine, darling!" the beggar scolded happily and started strumming a song on his guitar. "Sing along, it'll make you feel better."
During Charms Malfoy sat across from Harry, giving him the perfect opportunity to continue his observations.
"And then you just disappeared. I looked everywhere for you. I thought I had lost you forever. But then you were here, in my castle. You have no idea how relieved I was to see you. I gave this feast today so that everyone would see how much I love you."
Harry followed the snake and gasped in horror as he saw the many red lines cutting the white skin. Draco watched the exchange in silence. When Harry met his eyes, the silver was clouded in sadness.
Apparently, Malfoy was in love with me since we met at age eleven. I guess the bullying was his way of showing affection. In hindsight, some of his pranks were really cute.
“Harry does that?” Hermione asked. “Yep”, Ron sighed. “He was driving me nuts with all his bitching and moaning. That’s also one reason, why I made fun of Malfoy. I thought, confronting Malfoy would make him finally shut up.”
Harry nodded in understanding. “Are you still wearing your ring?” Draco inspected his hand. He hadn’t thought about taking it off all this time. “Seems like it.”
Potter scowled and slipped his hand possessively around Draco’s waist and wasn’t that interesting. Draco decided to test the waters a bit and said to Seamus. “No, thank you. I already got Potter for anything nut-related.”
In a solemn voice, Lucius announced, “Henceforth, you shall be husband and spouse. Go with him, son. From now on you shall share bed and table with him."
Merlin, if that wasn’t the cutest sight, Harrys ever seen. Groaning, he thumped his head against the table. That was it, he was dying because of Malfoys cuteness. Malfoy being nice to Luna was a lethal combination.
That shook Draco out of his stillness. “Seems like Pot–Harry is hopeless at non-violent communication. I guess, I’ll have to practice with him some more. Don’t look for us for the next hour or so.” He dragged Harry out of the classroom and shoved him into an alcove. He took out the cherry chapstick and skillfully smeared it on his lips before devouring Harrys mouth.
Harry squeezed Dracos hand. “As if you would have talked to me otherwise. Would it be that bad to be my friend, Malfoy?”
“Good. So, what might those feelings mean?” Ron was patient. Really, you should award him with an Order of Merlin.
Back in Harrys flat, Draco collapsed onto the bed exhausted. It was a very long day full of distress and sudden happiness. Draco felt as if he rode the emotional roller coaster long enough to last a lifetime. Harry lay down next him, keeping a proper distance.
"This is part of my disguise as a beggar, to sneak into Slytherin. I was there until yesterday, if you must know."
It was only the first month of the new school year, when it happened. Luna Lovegood formed a club called LOVE.
“Oh. Will that be alright, though? The Weasleys and my family don’t have a good history, as you know.” Draco was really nervous. What if they rejected him outright? He already had to deal with an unrequited love, being rejected by his husbands family was just too much.
Ron looked up, too. Noticing Harrys striken look, he asked “You okay, mate? What held you up so long?”
I barely registered all the people ‘cause I was searching for the only person that mattered to me. My green eyes locked with grey ones and I began to run.
Later at the feast the royal couple performed their first wedding dance. Harry spun Draco across the dance floor so that the beautiful dresses Draco was now wearing were whirling in a storm of white and gold.
“I know, your schedules are not the same today. So Mr. Potter, if you would be so good as to escort Mr. Malfoy to his classes and pick him up, after?” Not waiting for an answer, she dismissed them with a shooing wave of her hand. “That would be all. You can go now. I would advise a short trip to Madam Pomfrey.”
Sighing, Draco said to the Aurors “Alright. The real Aurors: stay here, I’ll be right back. The Stripper-Aurors: come with me.” He shooed the strippers down the hall.
“Please, Draco, don’t leave like that! Talk to him!” Draco shook his head vehemently. “At least think it over when you calmed down a bit. Please, don’t just cut all the ties, okay? I don’t want to lose my friend like that.” Now, Ginny had tears in her eyes, too. “Please, Draco!”
