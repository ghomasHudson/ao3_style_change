Pansy grimaces and backs away from him. “That’s just gross, Potter.” She spins around and leaves him at the door staring after her.
be having while at work.
“Rules of the game, if you have never done what’s on the card then you’re in the clear. If you have done it, take a shot! All right,” Macmillan said, “first card. Never have I ever been walked in on while making out." Everyone took a shot and Ernie passed the deck to Romilda.
"Come on," Potter said, scooting into the center of the circle, "we're several shots in, we can blame the alcohol."
“And do you think Lucius instructed his son to save you? Or at the very least, that he was supportive of Draco’s decision to deceive the Dark Lord?”
Draco's jaw tensed, "Well," he said tightly, "that's my exit cue." He set his drink down and stood to leave.
Hogwarts wouldn’t allow him to make these kinds of potions until his fourth year, and, at 12 years old, Scorpius had only just finished his first year. However, his father had always been willing to teach him about anything he showed an interest in, even if it was ahead of the school curriculum. Since Scorpius had an interest in potions and earning enough money for the newest Nimbus broom before 2nd year, this was a perfect arrangement.
James stripped to his boxers and slipped into the hot tub before Teddy was fully out of his button down.
Harry glanced up at Neville, then back at Zabini. “Just make sure this stays between us,” he said firmly. “Come on Neville, let’s go for a walk, I need some fresh air.”
" Ron stuffed his hands into his denims and shrugged. "I may have overreacted."
"I don't want to room with a girl. I want to room with Ron," he said. "Besides, this is ridiculous! I've never messed around with anyone at Hogwarts."
Draco huffed a laugh, letting his shirt get pulled off easily. "Merlin, you haven't been like this since 5th year."
Blaise blinked, running that last sentence through his head again to see if he had missed something. "A breakdown?"
Harry stepped in front of Draco to protect him. It's not like Ron needed much incentive to fight Draco. "So, Ron. It's good to see you. How come I didn't know you were coming?"
“Noticing that someone is fit is not the same as fancying them!” Harry said, trying to build a wall of defense against the two of them. He glared at Neville, “And you can wipe that knowing smile off your face because it certainly wasn’t 5th year that I noticed he’s fit.”
stepped closer still, pressing a hand against the splintering wood of the shed, and spoke in low tones, “J’ai envie de toi.”
The students closest to the door filed in as McGonagall left. It didn’t take long for the uproar to start, the students already in the common room loudly complaining about their room assignments.

Draco swallowed and Harry felt the boys adam's apple move under his own thumb. He pulled back to meet his eye and noticed that he could hardly see silver at all, Draco's pupils were blown wide.
- Seamus Finnigan, Ernie Macmillan, Blaise Zabini, Terry Boot
Harry felt himself smile back hesitantly, "Even so, you're very… calm," he said.
Once outside, with the invisibility cloak pulled off, Pax took flight. The little falcon swooped delightedly along the edge on the lake. Harry spread out his cloak in front of the grove of trees where he had agreed to meet Draco. Then he leaned against one and waited. He had spent the whole walk thinking about what Hermione had said and trying to decide what exactly they should talk about first. He knew they had a lot of history, and she was probably right about getting some of it sorted out before-
"Yes mum, thank you."
he thought.
Blaise scowled at his friend's cocked eyebrow. “No. We’re not dating." Deciding to ignore Draco, Blaise continued, "He’s brilliant with his mouth though. I bet I can get a repeat performance of that when Potter’s incessant thoughts aren’t in my head.”
Too confused to form a proper argument, Draco steps aside to let Potter open the door.
Potter seems to have lost their thread of conversation because he doesn't say anything at first. He blinks twice before replying, "Has he what?"
Harry pulled off Draco's cock and looked up at him through his lashes. "You should call me Harry" he said.
Umbridge shrieked, a gloved hand covering the small cut on her cheek. "You tried to kill me!" she cried, now pointing her finger at Draco. "You're in league with him!" She was backing towards the door now, "I'm going to have you in Azkaban for this. Both of you!"
Draco walked in through the front door and started talking before it was even closed. "Weasley, you're going to want to make sure the wards on that greenhouse are reinforced. Longbottom has a muggle plant back there that eats flies, but Lovegood keeps casting charms on it so I'm concerned," he looked up and stopped talking. His eyes fell on a display over Harry's right shoulder.
Harry and Draco both shuddered. Blaise laughed and Ernie turned to Pansy and said, "Oh really? Have you already done that?"
"Hey Scarhead, I know you like redheads but I thought you'd worked that out of your system, yeah?" Blaise asked.
The class paired off on the mats and began to duel. Harry watched them closely, noting the difference between his style and his classmates. He stopped to watch Neville and Ron, as Ron hit Neville with a bat bogey hex. Neville tried to block and counter at the same time and ended up taking the hex on his right thigh.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry didn't like his thoughts broadcast to anyone.
Astoria looked Harry over and stepped forward to straighten his tie, "Hi Harry," she said. She was nearly as pretty as Draco, with porcelain skin and bright blue eyes.
Potter stopped walking to face him. "You do remember coming to me for help, right? How exactly am I supposed to help if I don't know what we're doing?"
Potter grabbed hold of it before Draco could. Not that he was going to, he knew better than to take anything on offer to him from a Weasley.
article though. A right nightmare that damn thing has been.”
"Fuck, Draco," Harry panted the breathless words into the boys neck,"We are in the hallway."
She looked over at him but didn't reply. That was ok though, Harry was the one who needed to say something. The thought of telling her this made his heart flit about wildly in his chest. He took a deep breath.
Draco starts to undo Potter's denims, "Obviously you're under the influence of a lust potion. I'm using it to get control of you."
"Hermione," he says quietly, leaning forward, "you're awfully stiff. We will never sell this if you spend the whole meal looking suspicious." He picks up the bottle of merlot and refills her wine glass. "I can't sell this without you. Now, give me a smile that doesn't look like you're posing for a photographer."
"You're such a dick, Potter."
Harry cocked his head, his eyebrows drawn down in confusion, "Why are you-" he tried to figure out how to finish that question, but decided to start over. "You don't seem angry, how is that possible?"
"For not hitting me directly with that
Harry tried to back away but the group of them broke into a run and crashed into him, a rush of thank you’s and hands pulling at his clothes, touching his hair and his scar. He tried to keep his head, not wanting to get aggressive but they were hurting him now. He felt his robes tear at the seam and his glasses pulled off his face. Right as he his resolve started to snap, he heard two voices behind him call out, “
. He fought the thought during his shower, breakfast, and his walk to the floo.
Pansy smiled, "Normal is where you marry the Weaslette and become an auror, Potter," she said smugly.
As the writer, I recognize that what I've done here is just cruel, but I will do my best to make it worth it *kiss*
He chanced a glance at Draco who was already looking at him and Harry had to fight down the desire to move forward. All he wanted to do at this moment was collect on the promise he could see in those silver eyes, feel the comfort of his embrace.
Hermione grimaced, “More likely Harry will think-”
“If I don’t have you right now,” Harry growled into his ear, “Rita Skeeter is going to find out which one of us prefers to bottom.” He bit down on Draco’s neck and then sucked out a fresh bruise, delighted with the sounds Draco was panting into his ear.
Neville met Blaise at the door, grabbing his hand and dragging him to the middle of the room. Keeping their fingers entwined, Neville excitedly told Blaise about the Songbell flowers he was growing.
He heard laughter through the wall and then the sub said, “No I was NOT referring to edging. Don’t even get that idea in your head. You’d probably leave me unsatisfied for hours if I had the money to pay.”
Draco, moved so both hands were on Harry’s waist as he thrust into him over and over and over, and Harry came undone, beneath him. He saw Harry wrap a hand around his dick, pumping hard and fast until come pulsed out of him, spilling over against the door. His ass clenched and Draco's rhythm stuttered before as his body released, filling Harry up.
Draco and Pansy exchanged a look and then Pansy said, “Come on Chosen one, I’m hungry.”
"I know many people. None of them have taken her down as of yet. I don't know what's holding them back."
"18."
Draco smiled broadly, "Because you came to save me but I'd already taken care of it. I stole your hero moment." He looked exceedingly smug.
"I can handle it. I can. Just one more kiss." Harry pulled him back in, biting at Draco's lower lip until he moaned.
“Because I could hear the metal of the handcuffs on the bed frame!”
Draco shifted, his hips sliding in Harry's hands, and moved so he could lean against the door as Harry tugged down his trousers.
Neville arched an eyebrow. “Maybe you should meet him, Harry. It would probably do you some good, you’re always wound so tight.”
“I need to come through. Can I?”
Before Draco can ask what the fuck that means, Potter's leg slides between Draco's and nudges his thighs apart. With the thick press of Potter's cock rolling against his own erection, Draco decides to ignore the statement. After all, Potter has always been weird and Draco isn't going to give up this opportunity.
Anna's fingers brushed against his hip, "Wow… How did you get it?"
“Oh please!” Pansy shrieked, “I didn’t even know how to get to this awful place!” She took this moment to smack Draco’s robe covered bicep. “Stop stalling, I don’t have all day.”
It wasn't the thoughts themselves that were the problem. It was the
Pansy looked at what Harry knew could only be Ginny Weasley. He watched Pansy's expression, registering the hunger and excitement she was trying to tamp down.
Harry and Draco both scowled at her and then, reluctantly made eye contact.
Blaise’s eyebrows drew down in confusion before the name ‘Godric’s Hollow’ clicks into place and he remembered. Halloween is when Potter lost his parents. Feeling helpless, Blaise squeezed Potter’s shoulder, something he’d seen the Gryffindors do many times when they were showing compassion. “I hope tonight is exactly what you need.”
Harry gave a small smile in return, "Shut up Ron. Did you get an owl from the school?"
"I would rather talk about 6th year than even graze the topic of my Father with you," Draco snapped.
Hermione hmms as she looks back at the flowers. She's been quite determined to get her head straight about Draco over this last week, and failing spectacularly. She keeps reminding herself that this is all for show, but he makes everything feel authentic when they are together. Hermione has even tried to shut down her growing feelings by replaying moments from Hogwarts in her mind, back when she would never have been able to find him appealing. It hasn’t worked, he’s changed so much from the way he used to treat her that it backfired, highlighting the changes he’s made and his personal growth.
This chapter title is due to a comment left on chapter 12 that made me laugh. I hope the smut is enjoyable :)
As you are aware, the Ministry's late response to the first several books means that we are unable to mass obliviate the muggles, especially with the advancement of the internet. However, if you personally need a muggle obliviated please fill out the proper forms and one will be dispatched for you.
Her eyes were suspicious as they passed over Harry. "Obviously I'm not going to deny the Chosen One," then she turned back to her work.
Draco grinned, pulling back again, letting the tie slide off Harry's neck as he went. "Blue is supposed to be the best color for an interview," Draco said. "It represents peace and persistence." He took the grey tie and set it down, then pressed the blue one into Harry's hand.
Once inside, the group was practically ambushed with a series of introductions and polite greetings. Astrid shook so many hands that she’d forgotten the first group of names she’d learned, and they hadn’t even left the foyer. When the greetings stopped she had a moment to take in her surroundings. The manor was incomparable. There were all of the things she’d been told to expect, pillars, marble, portraits, and high ceilings. It was the beauty that caught her off guard, the subtle fragrance from tastefully placed bouquets, fairie lights that changed color as she walked by. They were led into a ballroom room which had over 20 tables in it set for dinner and in the center was a harpist, his music sweet and drifting through the manor. Astrid tried to take in every detail as they all moved through the crowd of people.
The Room of Requirement has pulled out all the stops. Hermione must have been in charge of telling the Room what was needed because it's perfect. There are plush pillows in one corner, a large table with Exploding Snap, a deck of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes cards, and a Wizard's chessboard.
Harry didn't say anything to that, just nodded and looked at the floor. Robards had offered to meet with Harry too but he'd declined.
“How’s it going being bonded to Potter?” Draco asked in a whisper, “Does he spend most of his time thinking of new ways to please his fans?”
Scowling, Draco followed Potter inside.
"Oh good, you're here." Zabini pulled Neville past them and up the stairs. "Good luck," he called before shutting the door to the room.
Draco pushes a finger into him with his right hand and strokes Harry’s cock at the same time with his left hand. By the time Draco puts  in a second finger he's brushing up against Harry’s prostate with high level precision.
Harry hummed noncommittally.
Daphne burst out laughing. “I guess the rumors about Hufflepuffs are true,” she said after catching her breath.
"I see," Harry replied slowly, he wasn't concerned with the threat, only worried about the subject, "and we are talking about Parkinson?" he asked hopefully.
745pm.
That managed to pull a small smile from Harry. "Probably."
"Not until recently."
When he looked back at Narcissa she had an eyebrow delicately raised as though she was posing a question. Harry felt his cheeks heat up and tried to compose his face into something with less emotion. Draco had told him many times that he wore his thoughts on his face. Narcissa turned to her son, showing Harry her profile. A silent conversation seemed to pass between them before she said aloud, "I assume this is why you told me to end the contract negotiations for Miss Greengrass?"
Pansy pulls back from the hug and proceeds to maneuver Draco until his head is in her lap and her fingers are threading through his hair. "What happened darling?"
have this treat instead of him.He pushed off of the doorframe, running a hand through his hair so his scar was on prominent display. "I highly doubt that," he said, moving towards the other blonde.
in the middle of the desk so they could all see the front page. The headline read
"This whole secret project the two of them have worked up has to do with me," Potter replied, "but I'm not sure what we're looking for."
James thought, following close behind Teddy in the dark tunnels.
When Draco caught his breath he looked into Harry's eyes, and said, "To be clear," the arms looped around Harry's neck tightened, "you are mine. You have been for a long time, we just took awhile to figure it out."
Neville pressed his lips together, looking suspiciously as though he was trying to hold back a smile, and glanced at Blaise.
Hermione rolls her eyes, “Are you going to help me then?”
"Hi Harry. How’s it going?" Macmillan said, leaning closer to Draco.
Before he replies, Pansy interrupts saying, "Oh, Draco isn't coming to the Leaky with us tonight?" Her voice is thick with false innocence and she is keeping her eyes trained on her computer screen.
"OK Potter, listen up," Pansy said. At which point Pansy and Hermione loaded Harry with advice. He tries to compile a mental list in his brain as they talk. He's pretty sure that half of what they say he doesn't remember and hopes that his subconscious picks it up.
“Does that bother you?” Draco asked, suddenly sounding guarded.
Pansy smirked, "I've seen the outfits doll, that's why I chose this theme. Daphne is going to dress as Harley Quinn."
as an idea came to mind. Pansy and Hermione had said not to pay for sex, but they hadn't said anything about paying for other services. "Speaking of your clients, I wanted to talk to you about something. I have a business proposition for you."
Pansy searched his face, the way she always seemed to when Harry talked about Draco. “I look forward to seeing you there. Before you tell the press to fuck off, don’t forget to mention that you got your perfect wizarding robes from PEP.”
He was not looking forward to a repeat performance. He could already feel his breath become shallow and a sweat break out as they reached the entrance to Diagon.
Scorpius smiled, “Absolutely. It’s delicious, so you better make it good.”
Harry chuckled, "Oh come off it! You could have told me plenty without giving the details!"
Draco nodded, and asked, “Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?"
"I've never been on a ship," Draco replied honestly.
"I- you- it wasn't torture. You were just-" Harry said. Then he sighed and tried again, "OK. The war is long over and you have obviously changed since you're living in a muggle flat. And I wasn't exactly nice to you in school either."
Draco conjured a table before the three of them and they all started in on the homework. Blaise was nearly done with the multiple choice section when Hermione stormed into the common room.
Pansy watches him wearily. "Are you mad?"
"I am appalled to even have you at this school," Umbridge continued, mistaking Harry's silence for compliance. "You're only going to infect the other students with your lies and deviant sexual acts."
"Here Neville," Potter said, "have some sugar, Hermione says it helps you retain information."
"Civility?"
"She won't care, trust me. And, honestly Potter, neither do you."
Harry jumped at the sound of Zabini saying his name, then did his best to walk into their room casually.
When they entered, Harry was sitting stiffly on the leather loveseat. His fingers were splayed out against his denims as though he was trying not to curl them into fists. He had just asked Dudley about his work. Draco took a seat next to his Husband and Scorpius sat cross legged on the floor. From this point he knew he would have a good view of everyone in the room. Dudley and Astrid were sitting the two chairs across from the loveseat, with the center table between them.
Emily looked it over, a wry smile tilting her lips. "It appears to be Draco Harry slash art. Very well done, I might add." She looked up at Draco, "What, did you think Draco was straight?"
Harry considered that "Fair enough."
So yes, by Friday morning he was only holding onto the idea of sanity, just enough to realize that he needed real help, he needed real advice. After a shower he threw on his comfiest denims and a plain black t-shirt.
"First of all, I think you are confused about Gryffindors and sex. You're thinking of Hufflepuffs. Second, I don't have anything against sentimental as long as it includes handcuffs or spanking. And third," he paused, swiping his tongue quickly only to watch the blonde's eyes follow the movement. "Draco," Malfoy's eyes snapped up to meet his at the sound of his given name. "I think you want to fuck me."
Harry's body buckled against Draco. He was so close that the next words were said against Draco's lips, "I'm actually not well known for being able to spot when something is a bad idea," he said and then held his breath.
“No, she’s free to explore as long as you’re with her. She will help you on all projects going forward.”
Potter cocked his head, green eyes boring into him. Draco immediately strengthened his occlumency shields, just in case. "Sure," Potter said with a shrug. He glanced back at Weasley who was gathering his things, "Do you mind?"
“I order from this place fairly regularly,” Harry replied, as he forced his eyes off of Draco’s throat and onto his own food. Draco’s throat, which was connected to his body, which was in Harry’s house. A house that had a bedroom in it.
"And reminded them you have the order of Merlin, for killing Voldemort, and that you were still suspicious of people who worked in the ministry."
Harry, triumphantly, did not think, specifically, of Draco when he got off. He finished showering quickly after that, dried off, dressed in boxers, a t-shirt, and denims, and went to the kitchen to start breakfast. He put on the wireless and listened to a morning show that told mystery stories and let callers guess who the murder was. Halfway through cooking, there was a knock at his front door.
Draco loves Pansy a
Above him, Potter heaves a deep sigh. "Unbelievable," he says, tugging his jeans closed.
"Yes, I'm aware. I outclass you too Malfoy," she replied with a sweet smile.
Harry thinks, as his stomach drops to the floor boards and all air leaves the room.
Scorpius took another sip of Harry's tea and then handed him the cup. He turned back to Astrid, "The rest of the story is a wholesome saga about my Father getting married despite his outrageous tantrum, and managing to produce an heir," here Scorpius paused to bow, "you're all welcome. Then him and Astoria split up so she could pursue a modeling career stateside and Harry took my Father on a date like a perfect gentleman." He glanced suspiciously at Harry, "But I think they did a bit more than exchange contact information in that interrogation room, if I'm being honest."
Headmistress McGonagall also spoke for Draco. She didn't provide any specific stories, she discussed his age and upbringing, more than anything else. She also offered to hold monthly accountability meetings with him, should he return to her school.
Blaise looked up at him.
Everyone took a shot.
Draco nodded, tucking into his food.
“We’re going out?” Harry looked down to watch Draco's fingers.
Draco closed his eyes and let it all spill out. "I've secretly been shagging the chosen one for two months. And today, Hermione Granger asked me to be her fake boyfriend for the next four months." Pansy's hand had stopped moving and it sounded like her breathing had as well. Draco continued, "On top of all that, I'm pretty sure my boyfriend has the hots for my new girlfriend."
After redressing and a round of lazy snogging, Draco pulled back and said, "If you want to have me," he paused when Harry leaned forward to cover his neck in kisses, "for nearly two months I'm going to need time to tie up some loose ends."
Teddy Lupin was a Hufflepuff in school. But there was so much to him, so much more than that label.
Harry grimaced at that idea, but he knew that this was their only working plan at the moment.
"I don't know what you're talking about," he said. Maybe he could bluff his way through this.
"James," Teddy said, "put your hand on the gargoyle. I promise this will be fun."
Pansy smiled again, "It was very interesting. I had no idea you and I had so much in common," she said with a wink. "Went into the perfect amount of detail too, about your time at the club last night."
Draco pulled off Harry's lips to suck and bite his sensitive neck, then shifted his hips so his own erection was pressed against Harry's. When Draco started to rut against him Harry lost all notion of control, his hands gripped hard into the blonde's biceps as the pleasure built from his toes and traveled up his body.
This was the first time he'd been alone with Draco since -
“Best get this over with,” Milicent said, shouldering her bag and walking past the knights.
By the time Orion played enough to tire himself out and go back to sleep it was nearly an hour later. Even after being distracted, Harry couldn’t get the night’s events out of his head. He laid in bed till 4 am considering the morale issue of wanting to get off while having a kitten in bed. Exhausted from too little sleep, and still hard, Harry huffed and climbed out of bed, heading to the ensuite. At least the shower would be private, and help him wake up.
Draco wants to say something, to tell Potter that he's never felt this happy, that he wants to touch and tease every part of Potter's body from now until forever. But the words don't come, it's too much too soon and Draco doesn't like to feel vulnerable. Instead he leans against the hard planes of Potter's chest and tries to distract him by groping his ass.
"The Patronus is staying the course," Draco whispered, his lips brushing against the shell of Harry's ear, “we should keep moving.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco looked over at Harry without a single hint of surprise, "You're not supposed to be in here. How did you manage Pansy?"
Draco gave a nervous laugh. "Yes," he said, "this is my uh- my-"
Harry let out a surprised chuckle at that and they all started to laugh.
She had pursed her lips and cocked a hip, the picture of teenage annoyance, and replied, “And
The Professor flashed him a bright smile, bright blue eyes glittering, "All the students are paired up so you will be judging with me instead of dueling today."
“It’s a crossover comic,” Astoria had said, "You don’t have to wear anything too revealing, you can get away with jeans and a t-shirt.” Here Astoria had pointed to the other girl in the photo, "and I will wear that.”
Harry did look up at that, brows drawn together, and replied, "I haven't got a wife. Ginny is one of my best friends, and obviously the mother of my kids but-" he cut himself off again. Why was he talking so much? Draco didn't need all of that information.
"So I should just let Blaise use me as a pawn in some chess game he's playing with Potter?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Finally, they made it to the end of the tunnel to find a red door. Harry cast a detection charm on it, just in case. The words, '
"Ron," Harry cut in, and Ron turned to look at him. "You're my best mate and I love you like family, so please do not finish that sentence." He reached out and put a hand on Ron's shoulder, giving it a reassuring squeeze, "I like him a lot. I'm not spelled or drugged, I promise."
"What the hell just happened?” Harry asked no one in particular.
Next update will be by end of day Friday (possibly before then).
Umbridge narrowed her eyes and turned her nose up at Harry as though he was beneath her. Harry imagined a herd of centaurs bursting through the castle to carry her away.
“The boss already signed off on it. She said it will be good for you to spend time around muggles.”
The door to Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes opened and Potter stepped out, curious eyes absorbing the scene. Draco yanked back his hand, worried it would look like he’d been trying to feel up his coworker.
He approached the first obstacle, Hermione’s assistant, Lisa Turpin. When Harry first met her they had gotten off on the wrong foot. Apparently, she had been in Ravenclaw at Hogwarts during the same years as Harry, and she’d been a bit insulted that he didn’t recognize her. Since then, she’d warmed up to him a bit, but only when he brought a gift.
"Don't accept anything to eat or drink when we are at the Manor though," Draco said matter of factly, "just in case."
Harry looked at Blaise, "What just happened?" But all he received from the boy was a charming smile.
The smirk grew, "Weasley, how many can I buy at once?" Draco asked, his eyes never leaving Harry's.
Blaise started to laugh, “You two sound like Pansy and Draco,” he said.
"Yes, that's the other reason that I wouldn't do it."
After they left, Harry purchased the outfit that had Draco’s fingerprints all over it, and left the rest in the dressing room.
Draco hummed in response and gave Harry a quick glance before turning his attention back to the girl. “Astrid, how would you like to stay with us during the weekends over Summer break?” he asked.
Harry didn't offer a greeting when he arrived just started working. After the lunch his mind was a hurricane of memories that cracked into his fragile sense of sanity. He tried to shove them all back into the corner of his mind, tried to distract himself with the work. For nearly an hour he levitated stones into the broken wall, trying and failing to make them fit properly. The problem was that every time he got more than 3 stones stacked properly he would think of Sirius, or Lupin, or Tonks, or Fred, the list felt endless. As soon as the thought occurred the stones would shatter and he would have to restart.
Harry cursed under his breath and led the two of them to the kitchen to try and salvage his breakfast. He heard his two guests -intruders- sit down at the kitchen table while he got his plate together. Turning around he sat the plate on the table and sat down across from them. “Why are you here?”
"What does your sister have to do with anything?" Harry asked.
Draco looked up, his hands running along Harry’s thighs under the water. “About time, Potter,” he said.
"They're not illegal."
He thought, now sitting on his bed and staring at the wall.
Harry cut her off, "Please 'Mione, I really need to talk to you. I brought tea," he said.
"No," Pansy said, lifting up onto her elbows. "I mean that Draco might benefit from this. So you could get away with it. If you get caught, just say you were trying to help him out."
“Most of my clients are muggle,” Draco replied easily. Then he looked down to smirk at Harry, “Don’t let that make you jealous, I wouldn’t want you to vanish the bed.”
Anna, who was still there, looked between them as though she'd just woken up on Christmas morning to a pile of presents.
Harry could feel his cheeks heat and decided to change the subject from wanking to
that you are bidding to supply St. Mungo’s with bone regrowth potions.”
Harry swallowed, his breath catching again and again as Draco kissed and sucked his neck. He tugged at the rope, the tight pressure around his wrists somehow giving him permission to submit, and said, "Please, Draco. Please fuck me."
"Pansy?" Harry said, when he couldn't take the silence anymore.
Say hi on Instagram @dracos.tealsuit 🥰
Professor Liore pointed her wand at the tear and cast a quick mending charm. She then, pointedly look him up and down, and said, "I honestly thought that this is just how you look everyday," her eyes wandered again over his disheveled robes, his hair, and then met his eyes, "No disrespect."
"No. Yes," Harry gave a humorless laugh. "Honestly, the flat is great but," he looked down at his coffee, feeling a blush start on his cheeks, "I can hear the bloke next door."
Harry managed a laugh to go along with his eye roll. She wasn't lying, oddly enough, she often tried to help him. Years ago, Parkinson had offered to fund the building of the Burrow in order to make amends for her actions during school. He'd declined, of course, but did agree to a cup of tea and a long conversation. They hadn't become friends after that, but they were more than acquaintances.
"This isn't about us," Ginny said.
"Yeah, that's obvious to everyone Harry." They reached the end of the staircase and Neville linked an arm around Harry's.
Next they made their way to the Magical Menagerie where Scorpius spent 20 minutes patiently explaining to Astrid why she couldn't have a dragon instead of a bird. Eventually, he convinced her to get a Merlin Falcon, because she loved their blue color.

perceptive," she replied, her mocking tone cutting through Harry's thoughts.
“Rumors! Granger, what the fuck?! How could they think this!?”
Pansy relaxed slightly and rolled her eyes, "Don't get a big head Savior, I still have 3 apples in my bag."
"Your Grandfather," she said clearly, "Lucius Malfoy. I want to meet him."
Seamus shrugged and flashed him a smile, "I really thought Hermione was going to win. Didn't account for the girlfriend factor."
Harry swallowed through the dryness in his throat. He whispered, breathless, "Scared, Malfoy?"
Harry picks up his glasses from a side table next to the door and looks Hermione over. “Are you doing all right?”
So when Narcissa and Andromeda were sick of waiting for Draco to move back home they used Teddy against him. The owl arrived on March 10th, one month before Teddy's birthday.
"How did you know?" she demanded.
“I do.”
-Let him see you checking him out.
For a brief moment, Harry marveled at his friend. They had been somewhat close at Hogwarts, but nothing like Ron and Hermione. Over the past couple of years they’d certainly built more of a friendship, but Harry hadn’t realized that Neville knew him quite this well. Maybe Hermione had talked to him.
Draco had expected this caution from Potter, so he pitches his voice low and careful, as though he’s talking to a wild bunny. “I already know that you find her attractive, and I think you would be open to messing around with her.”
An hour later Blaise and Ernie went back to their rooms. Pansy told Draco he could stay as long as he swore they didn't have sex of any kind in the room.
“I don’t want to do anything that would jeopardize what I have with you Draco.”
"Don't call me darling. It's sexiest."
Hope you like it!!
"Malfoy," Harry croaks out. He still can't seem to pull in enough air and he's starting to feel a bit light headed. "I didn't- it was a gift for-"
"It is all of the incriminating evidence I have on Delores Umbridge," Lucius replied. Then, looking at the folder, "Or, at least, all that's relevant to the ministry."
Harry was pulled from his thoughts by a two-hit knock and the door to their room opening. Seamus stood in the entryway eyeing the two of them before saying anything. "Hullo Harry, Malfoy. Got a minute?"
Draco takes all of his things to Pansy's flat when he gets to England. Being back is one thing, going to the manor is something else entirely. She has agreed to let him stay there if he pays the rent, and Draco has already purchased the flat from her landlord. He is Malfoy, he's not going to do anything so plebeian as pay rent. He has his lawyer draw up the documents to sign the property over to Pansy but he doesn't tell her right away because he knows that she will think he's gone soft and accused him of being a Hufflepuff™.
Bewildered, Harry went to the spare bathroom next to the common room tea station. When he caught his reflection he turned a brilliant shade of red, and even the blush didn't hide the marks up and down his neck. He proceeded to cast several
Hermione feels her cheeks flush but maintains eye contact, "I did, thank you" she says, leaning forward to kiss him on the cheek and whisper, "they were unexpected."
about what it would be like with a man. He'd just just never
“Yeah, I have no idea how this got here. I've never seen it before.” The floor in this section slanted up at a brutal angle, straining the muscles of Harry’s calves. "Though it would be better with stairs," he said absently, continuing his walk.
who I was referring to. And for Merlin’s sake stop saying his name, much as I’m sure you enjoy the sound of it."
"Oh," Harry said. "Yeah, well I don't know what you've heard but Ginny and I aren't together anymore."
Draco reached forward to the three ties Harry was still holding, taking one of them. Long pale fingers pulled the satin across Harry's palm. "These are good choices," Draco said. "This shade of green would go well with your eyes."
"No," he said to the empty room. He stood then, grabbed his leather jacket, and apparated to an alleyway behind a club in Brixton.
Traveling through the ballroom Astrid spotted Draco's parents again. She tugged at Scorpius' sleeve, the material of his shirt much softer than the suit jacket he'd left at the table. When he turned back to her she leaned in and said, "I will meet you out there. I want to do something first."
, things to gauge the others reaction time. Neither of them struck.
That night Harry went out with Luna and Neville, the latter of which asked a concerning amount of questions regarding Harry's meeting Blaise. Luna told Harry, again, that she was proud of him for what she called "social renovation" meaning his being frindly with anyone outside of Gryffindor. At the bar, jittery from too much caffeine and not enough sleep Harry decided to drink a healthy amount of tequila in hopes that he would pass out and sleep heavily throughout the night. By the end, Luna and Neville had to carry him up the stairs to get to his flat, as he was too drunk to safely aparate.
Harry narrowed his eyes and said nothing. He knew from her time as a Professor at Hogwarts, that the decisions Dolores tended to make bordered on the extreme. He could only hold his breath and hope that he would not be somehow forced to carve anything else into human flesh.
He realized with a grimace what he'd done. "Sorry," he said, blushing furiously. He got up to leave the common room, possibly throw himself into the lake.
“I think I left some clothes here. Do you mind if I check my old room?”
Harry thought, feeling a smug smile on his face.
When arrived at Gringotts the goblins were not pleased to see him. Not that goblins ever seem pleased, but with Harry, they were pointedly angry. He's made to sign a magically binding contract at the first station. It states that he will not steal any property, he will only enter his own vault, and he will not release any animals being held in the building. Finally, he's given his key and sent on his way to the Potter vault.
“Don’t be selfish, it’s the least you can do. It’s not like you’re going to have to share them,” Natalie giggled, “except with each other, I guess.”
They stared at each other for a moment, the fire heating Harry's face until Ginny broke into a fit of laughter and said, "I'm going. I'll talk to you soon Harry," and cut the connection.
"Just checking for something," she said lightly, then stepped back out.
“You said I’m not allowed to sleep here.”
Harry's brain did a quick recount of the last 30 minutes in the office. The comments, the clothing, the little smiles. When the pieces fell into place his jaw dropped. “Holy shit!” he cried, “You. What? You can’t- Mione! You are not- what? And- and Ron?” He tried to stop talking. Tried to let her say something but the amusement in her eyes when she turned her gaze on him made Harry panic even further.
“Draco?” he said the name like a question, hoping Draco would understand.
“Not a big deal?” Draco growled. “I bet Potter would think it was a pretty big deal.”
"So you've spent the last two weeks listening to me fuck other people," Malfoy said, letting his voice drop into a seductive drawl, "and now you want to hire me."
Harry sighed. “Look, I shouldn’t have asked you about your… about the trials,” he said, like a mature adult. Then he added, “I still don’t have your wand,” because he couldn’t help but push a little.
"I'm just curious," Neville replied, his lips turning up into a sly smile. "Is he hot?"
“Malfoy,” Draco interrupted, pointing a finger in Potter's face. “You call me Malfoy. What is with everyone today thinking they can use my given name?”
“Why me?”
"Thank you Harry, for the tea, it's just that I've got-"
Harry was ushered into the sitting room with a cup of tea. Draco pointed to the table where several blueprint plans were laid out. Harry could tell they were magic, rather than muggle, from the way they changed when Draco touched them with his wand.
Blaise put his hands up in a sign of surrender. He was definitely going through with the plan, if not for himself, then for Potter. "Who am I to argue with the Savior?"
“Merlin, no.” He was disgusted at the very thought.
"I'm glad to see you stay late once in a while to make up for your tardiness."
Hermione picks up a small card from the bouquet, white linen paper that's soft to the touch with silver letters.
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “Nice to be thought of,” he said, bitterly. “Is this because I was a Death Eater?”
“Yes, of course.”
“Hi love,” Harry manages to get the greeting out before he’s pushed against the closed door. Draco kisses him hungrily with fingers twisted into his hair. Every nerve ending sparks through Draco’s body and the moan torn from Harry’s throat goes straight to Draco’s cock.
Harry put his face in his hands, "We?" he asked, the question coming out muffled.
his mind provided, in a voice that sounded like Harry's mind healer.
"Harry!" George's voice broke through the moment. He walked over to the 3 of them, the sleeves of his robes covered in dust that he was brushing off.
"No," Zabini said quickly, a wry smile on his lips, "I have no interest in Potter. Though, 'dark-hair Gryffindor' does seem to be my type."
Draco turned to him with the haughtiest Malfoy look he could muster, “You do realize that if unspeakable is going to be your actual job title you will have to find a way to stop talking?”
“Geez Harry,” Dudley said, staring at Scorpius, “mighty smart boy you’ve got here. Most adults can’t keep up with Astrid’s questions when she gets on a roll like that.”
She glanced back up with a smile, "So I just touch it with my thumb?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Scorpius studied her face for a moment, "You're lying." He said the words without any anger, just stated them as a fact.
: Drarry
Harry's hand stilled on Draco's boxers.
“Look, I’m sorry Parkinson. Draco said that he told you that he and I-” he cuts himself off as Pansy’s wand tip presses harder against his pulse point.
Scorpius Malfoy sat on the kitchen counter, his legs swinging gently as he watched Draco, his father, brew a new batch of Pepper-Up Potion. He was already in the second stage of the process, stirring 4 times in a clockwise direction, and reaching for the dropper which held 5 drops of Salamander blood to add, before stirring again. Draco had promised Sorpius he could help out with potions brewing over the summer to earn extra allowance, but he had to watch a batch of each one being made before he was allowed to start.
Draco’s fist clenched, and he forced out the words, “Did you know that a slew of muggles are writing stories about me and Potter? Explicit stories!”
The explicit tag will be more included in later chapters. However, I primarily do my best writing in the *fluff with plot* areas, so fair warning on both accounts!
"I-" Draco moaned as Harry's teeth sank into his neck, "fuck- Potter if you don't stop I'm going to drag you to bed."
Blaise lifted an eyebrow, "Is he really that loud?"
Lucius stiffened, narrowing his eyes at Harry before glaring at his son.
Harry glanced at it, recognizing the supplies he’d vanished while remodeling his kitchen, and felt another rush of affection towards Grimmauld Place. He watched Draco sink in, shivering as his body adjusted from cold to hot.
Blaise looked over to see Potter's self-satisfied smile. Who knew the Savior could be such a prat?
“I know you are dealing with the same thing,” she said, as though the matter were already settled. Harry would like it stated for the record that the matter was
Memories from Malfoy manor assault Harry. The damp air, and sickening smell of blood and fear, flooding his senses. Malfoy’s eyes on him, sparking with recognition, hope.
"This might not mean much to you Potter, but we are talking about Hermione Granger. She's a war hero and -"
which flew so far away from him that he was momentarily confused. It hit the barrier Hermione held and burst against it. The force crashed into his back and Harry hit the ground. He immediately cast a Protego, deflecting her next curse as she advanced. In the brief moment she hesitated he dropped the shield and cast
"Most wizards and witches wouldn't know this spell actually," Draco said, once he'd collected himself. "My mother used the same charms to create one of these at the manor. It's a Black family tradition."
Harry's eyes traveled down, noting the way Malfoy's shirt was slit up the side to show a sliver of skin.
Groaning at the words, Harry grabbed Draco's wrist and pulled him outside.
Currently, Harry sat with Ron and Hermione at the 8th year table and listened to Ron talk about Percy's attempts to regulate the firework displays sold at his brother's shop. He was feeling supremely guilty about the fact that his best friends didn't know something about him that all of the returning Slytherins knew. And possibly Neville. Probably Neville.
“Oh come on,” Harry said, “I just threw on something easy. It’s not like I dress like this all the time. You’ve seen how I dress for business meetings, Hermione.”
"Just getting ready to take a shower," he said, the words coming out strangled.
"Good evening gentlemen," McGonagall's voice pulled Harry's attention back to the moment. She sounded exhausted.
Both Gryffindors turned a look of concern on the Slytherin who just gave them a charming smile.
Harry looked at him, enjoying the sight of blown pupils in those silver eyes, "Whatever you want, love," he said, his voice unsteady as Draco's hand stared to move.
“I read the note, it said to come to Grimmauld place.”
"You know it's a bad idea. I can give you five reasons off the top of my head right now," she said darkly.
Harry shrugged, "I figured you wouldn't mind. I know he's a Slytherin, but he can't be worse than Malfoy."
Draco grimaced at the name, then nodded and they both turned back to watch the stars dance.
When they got back outside and started to walk to the apartment complex Draco took pity on him, "I don't hold it against you, Potter."
Draco is in the hallway leading to the landing of his and Pansy’s flat. He peeks around the corner to get a better view of the scene unfolding at the entryway. Potter is leaned against the door, hands stuffed into his pockets and looking as though he’s trying very hard not to smile. Pansy is spitting venom at him with her wand to his throat.
"I'd like to offer you a job."
The wards chime and Draco registers the sound of someone trying to open the front door only a moment later. Potter pulls off with wide green eyes. "I locked it," Potter whispers.
The two boys dissolved into giggles. Which, Harry thought, was just ridiculous. Grown men are not supposed to giggle, much less dissolve into them.
“Will you need to counsel yourself then?” Draco's cold voice cut in. “For what happened at the door with my son, I mean.” He was seated on the couch with one arm along the back, his fingers just barely grazed against Harry’s shoulder. To anyone else he would appear casual, but Scorpius could see his tense shoulders. He knew his Father was holding back.
Level -2
she's only going to turn you down. She's completely daft for the Chosen Prat."
"I'll wait up."
"Did Hermione get a chance to talk to you?" Neville asked.
His eyes snapped to meet hers, she looked horrified and astonished, and her face was having trouble deciding how to express that.
The party starts at 7pm, arrive by 630pm.
As he watched her bound up the stairs to the room, Scorpius stepped over to Teddy and gently knocked his shoulder against the other boy's. "Isn't she great?" Scorpius asked with a broad grin, "Father got her for me."
He told himself that he didn't have an agenda, that he was just passively watching people walk by. He knew it was a lie though. He hadn't stopped thinking about Draco since the club. Or, you know, since sixth year. As soon as he spotted Draco, Harry stood up, pulled his hoodie on, and flipped up the hood.
She nodded.
There was a strained silence until all of them broke into laughter except for Ernie who offered a small smile. Hannah gave him a side hug saying, "This will be a true test of your house abilities my friend."
“No one will be able to spot the differences faster than you Draco.”
Hermione shoved a paper towards Pansy's face, which the other girl snatched from her and threw on the floor. "You should have consulted me about this!"
Harry grinned and put his arm around her shoulder, "Come on, let's get breakfast started while the Malfoy boys get themselves proper for the day." He glanced back at the bed, winked, and said, "Twenty minutes Scorp."
“Cast the spell
Harry’s throat goes dry, despite the copious amounts of water he’s been drinking all night. He runs a hand through his hair, causing his messy locks to further dishevel. He peeks up at Charlie through the loose strands that fall over his left eye.
He tucked Draco's still hard cock back into his pants.
Hermione graced him with a triumphant smile and walked to the desk. “I granted your request for the new project.”
"You." Harry said simply.
You are needed for a muggle infiltration assignment at 7pm this evening, March 13th, 2003.
Pansy stilled, taking a deep breath. A tense silence fell between them until she met his eye, "Are you-"
Harry scowled, “I liked you more when you were too nervous to stand up to me,” he said.
A crash comes from the closet, something that sounds distinctly like a glass bottle combusting, and Malfoy flinches at the noise. He spares a brief glance at the closet before responding to Hermione. “What on earth are you talking about Granger? Surely you’re going to the event with Weasley.”
"Hullo," she said softly. He smiled when he looked up at her, and she found herself smiling back. He motioned toward a chair and she sat down at the kitchen table, it was small but the wood was solid the outer edge had Nordic runes carved into it. She ran her fingers along them, tracing the patterns.
"The project," Draco said. He took a deep breath, trying to remember how he was supposed to phrase this request. "Hermione said I should ask you to help me with the project."
The girl glanced down at her clipboard. “Jason, right?” She stuck out a hand. “I’m Emily, I’m in charge of this party and the look-alike’s point of contact.”
"I mean he clearly knows you're bent-"
Harry smirked, "
Draco's eyes seemed to search Harry's face before he said, "All right. 10 am." He sauntered away, heading for his apartment, obviously letting Harry enjoy the view until he slipped through the door.
They were in Professor Loire's DADA classroom. She had chaperoned most of the student populace to Hogsmeade. Both boys had opted to stay out of the public eye and keep to the castle instead. Currently, Harry was supposed to be grading the 5th year's essays on boggarts.
not done with this.
"Surreal?" Hermione offered.
(See the end of the chapter for
Orion woke when the moaning started, and he sat up to look curiously at the wall. Harry could hear an odd chinking sound.
“What?”
Title: Jets, Bubbles, and Fluff
. Harry arches his back, moaning loudly as Draco thrusts into him with relentless, all-consuming passion.
Pansy had sat quietly, until Hermione had run out of steam, before saying, “My mistake. It brings a copper sheen to the lion eyes you’re sporting. Is that better?” Hermione
“Yeah, you know, how much money are you working with?”
He cast a half hearted glare at her and said, "Now I know you're taking the piss."
“I’m not going to lie, I’ll be happy to be rid of your constant narrative,” Blaise replied, offering Potter a smile of his own.
One impact from the war that Harry never would have considered, was an abundance of house-elves with no families to care for. Hermione had worked with several restaurants in Wizarding London to have them hired on as employees. This made waiting for your take away order a thing of the past. Elves would apparate into your kitchen and leave freshly plated food on the table then return two hours later to clear and collect the plates.
he thought, careful not to let this one through.
Leaning against the brick wall next to the front door, Draco tipped his head back to let the sun warm his face. Today had been too long already.
“Look, ‘Mione, I don’t know what Blaise was even talking about,” he laid a hand over hers, “but I know that anyone, boy, girl, or otherwise, would be lucky just for a chance with you.”
"Yes?" Draco replied from one of the desks, still writing his essay for Transfigurations.
Harry started to look through them as she continued, "You have a lot of good references there, it's clear you enjoy teaching. Not to mention the improvements you've helped the students in this class make over just the last month."
Harry fought to keep his eyes from looking at Lucius, “Yes,” he replied.
"She's right," Hermione said quietly, "we shouldn't talk here." She pulled a confused Ron to his feet and left the great hall. Once Harry joined them she said in a rush, "Listen, I just want to say that I love you no matter what. I think this is a very stupid idea, but if it makes you happy, I will support you and be as nice as I can."
Harry closed his eyes, breathing in the scent of citrus and high-dollar cologne that he’d quickly come to associate with pure lust. Draco had shoved him to the bed and straddled him before Harry had even said hello. The blond was currently sitting atop him, his legs spread out to bracket Harry’s thighs, and pulling brightly colored rope from his bedside table.
"Ron!" Hermione said, rounding on him, "I did not say that liking blokes was a stupid idea!"
Hermione lifted her chin and said, "She's apologized for her- for," she waved a hand in a vague gesture, "all of it." She glanced at Daphne, "As for the study group, you and your sister always look nice, nothing wrong with me doing the same."
"I can kick your ass at Wizard's Chess if you want?" Draco offered. "We won't even have to talk. You can spend the whole time talking to Potter."
Daphne nodded, still looking at Blaise. "It's not public though. Hermione said that Neville looked
"How did you get started in this line of work?"
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, trying to focus. He could feel his magic pouring into the other room, pooling purposefully around Draco, who shuddered and let a pleased smile grow on his face.
"Er, hello?" he said, and she looked up at him with a hesitant smile.
“This arrangement is beneficial to both of us and we can arrange for a clean and friendly break up after the event. Are you going to help me?”
"Technically that's not his current plan," Hermione cut in, far too pleased with herself, "it's a repeat of his plan during 6th year."
Pansy shrugs, draining the rest of her pygmy puff cocktail. "I offered to get in with Hermione but she doesn't like politics.
Tim!" Harry growled.
❣️~~~~~~~~~💕~~~~~~~~~❣️
Oh right, James and Teddy. Harry had talked to both of them actually, several times. Dancing around the subject the way parents often try to do, without mentioning specific names. He was pretty sure James had been in love with Teddy since before the boy left Hogwarts. Shifting his weight, Harry slipped his wand into its holster and looked around the patio.
An uproar of laughter wrang through the shop, all of them, except Harry, were laughing.
"Draco," Astoria's voice came through the door again and Draco reached forward to open it. She stepped in, as though she belonged there.
Harry looked carefully at her and decided that any secrets she held he was far from equipped to uncover. But, he knew Hermione loved Ron, and he knew that Pansy had created the fashion line, PEP, so the story checked out, at least on the surface. When he looked at Pansy he found her to be pointedly ignoring him, using a hand mirror to refresh her lipstick.
Draco apparates to a block away from Hermione’s flat. He greets the reporters waiting to snap a picture of him going into her house, giving them a friendly smile when they ask if he’s happy about his girlfriend. When Hermione opens the door to let him in, her eyes drop slow and hungry over his body, lingering over the tight t-shirt and well fitting denims. Draco smirks and asks, “May I come in?”
"Shit." Harry jumped up. "Sorry love," he said, promptly blushing at the words. He hadn't meant to say that, it just came out. "I mean-" he closed his mouth, feeling a flush bloom across his cheeks.
Anna's smile faltered at the odd statement. The woman before her wasn't looking at the ice cream case. She was dark-skinned with a mass of wild curls gathered into a ponytail. Anna's eyes dropped down to the woman's arm to look for a scar, but it was covered by her Blazer.
The girl chuckled and handed over a piece of thick parchment. "It's my art and you're free to use it on social media if you want." With that she sauntered away, imitation Slytherin robes billowing behind her.
"Draco," Harry huffed a laugh and stood to his feet, "you're such a bottom, I'm surprised you were able to ask that question with a straight face." He leaned in for another kiss.
“Pansy,” Hermione said. Harry was surprised to hear fondness in her voice as she continued, “You shouldn’t put so much stock into clothing. I know it’s your passion, but Harry,” she glanced at Harry then, seemingly taking in his outfit for the first time, and grimaced.
Draco closed his eyes, marking this as the moment he abandoned sanity in favor of the terrifying embrace of mutually assured destruction. "Can you still speak Parseltongue?"
Blaise felt his heartbeat pick up. Did Draco know he was doing this to get at Potter? Outwardly though, he smiled back with an easy, "Thanks mate."
“There’s a cafe down the street. They suggested we grab coffee.”
Looking at the picture now, she decided she liked it, despite the fact that she hadn't managed to get the robes Draco was wearing to lay correctly. She scrolled up to search for tips on drawing clothes.
“No, actually, I’m very busy right now brewing a potion to repel snakes. I seem to be getting an infestation and it’s really important that I take care of it,” Harry replied, meeting her eyes.
"What about me?"
Harry gives her a quizzical look, "Just making sure. You and Ron-" he trails off with a wave of his hand as though it sums up his point.
The door clicked softly shut behind him, and Harry felt gentle hands on his shoulders, turning him around and pushing him firmly back against the wall. Breathless, it occurred to Harry that perhaps his lack of experience wouldn’t be an issue. Harry’s shoulder blades pressed into the wall, feeling Draco warm and solid, rolling their hips together. Draco’s hands slipped down to Harry’s waist and he untucked Harry’s shirt, sliding his hands over the warm skin beneath. Harry wanted to do something -
The response is unexpected and Blaise peeks over at Potter’s face to gauge what he means by that statement. Then he realizes he hasn’t been hearing Potter’s thoughts all day. “Potter. Did you learn Occlumancy?”
"Hello Potter," Draco said without looking up. "Would you please get the Headmistress?" his voice was a oddly calm.
Blaise stared at him for a long moment. Potter was currently thinking about the conversation they’d had a few minutes ago. He didn’t feel right telling Draco that Potter was having a gay crisis though. Not because of Potter’s privacy, Blaise wasn’t a Hufflepuff. He just didn’t know how Draco would react to the news and he wasn’t ready to find out. “Much to no one’s surprise, Potter spends most of his time not thinking at all.” The lie brought a rueful smile to Draco’s face and Blaise counted it as a win.
Harry glared at the parchment for proving the other man right, “Yes well it’s my mail and I doubt that’s the reason you showed up at my door,” he looked back at Draco. “Or were you going to offer to do a dramatic reading for me? Parkinson mentioned that you did one for her with the
“I was on my knees.” Another slow lick.
Potter joined him on the steps, his body so close to Draco's back that Draco could feel the waves of Potter's magic wrapping around him. He drew in a ragged breath, too overwhelmed to worry if Potter would notice.
"Sometimes I call you the Weaslette," Pansy said, as though she was confessing a hidden desire. Harry looked at Ginny who had stopped laughing and, instead, had started to blush.
"Do not call me that," she said cooly.
Draco glanced quickly at Potter before giving Blaise a wry smile, "Je veux te baiser."
“Please?” Astrid said with big, hopeful, dual colored eyes, and then pushed her bottom lip into a pout.
"Kreacher, bring up three dinners," Potter said. He glanced at Blaise and shrugged. "Malfoy probably doesn't want to eat down there without you. If he doesn't want it, Kreacher can take it back."
Harry thought, glaring at her.
Potter studied him, chewing at his bottom lip. "Alright," he said. Then, nodding at the building behind Draco, he added, "Do you mind if we stop here to grab a cup of coffee?"
“Most of it.”
"I bet they would hook up before the age of twenty," Pansy replied, "he bet they would hook up later than that."
"Yeah, sorry. Last track of time. I was just about to leave."
Please send love in the comments if you're enjoying this 🥰
"Was it-" she closed her mouth, unsure if she should broach the subject. Looking up to meet his eye and letting her curiosity get the better of her
“How do I look?” Draco asked, and the tone of his voice makes Harry feel as though he was being read like an open book.
“Surely there must be someone here who can keep their hands to themselves,” Loire said.
Harry felt his eyes go wide, his heart stopped, then picked up at double-speed, pounding against his chest like the hooves of his patronus.
"Granger."
Harry nodded in acknowledgment, then, -
I'm publishing my original piece this week 😳😳😳 wish me luck!!
When Harry got back to the room it was dark and the curtains around Pansy's bed were drawn. Harry cast
Harry searched his feelings, considering the Slytherin.
He grabbed a t-shirt and his bathroom bag as well, deciding a long shower before turning in early would be his best bet for a drama free evening. When Harry opened the bathroom door he was assaulted with sound that hadn't been there before. Pansy was wrapped up in the arms of Blaise Zabini, who was leaned back against the wall. Taking in the scene, Harry realized that there must have been a silencing charm up.
Astrid was shocked.
James heard his father's voice through the foam but he couldn't see him. "Over here, Dad!" James called, pushing away multi-colored bubbles from his face.
"No. Just pleasantly tipsy."
Harry gave her a genuine smile then, "Thank you Pansy. I'll see you on the train." With that he headed to the floo.
“Ship,” Macmillan said. “It’s a ship. They ship y- um, well, drarry, they ship drarry.”

Harry smiled and hugged her back, "Hey there Luna," he said into her hair.

"I'm not sure I can answer that without compromising Potter."
outfit, her honest beauty was an equal match to Parkinson's. Surprisingly, her Oxford button up had two buttons undone at the top. He made a mental note
Draco only seemed caught off guard by her abrupt attempt to exit for a brief moment before his features schooled into an impassive expression. He nodded slightly and said, “Thank you for your hospitality Granger. I will see you soon.”
“Long standing code word. Now where were we?” Draco’s fingers moved back and forth while his mouth hollowed and sucked, rendering Harry incapable of any thought except for the lewd way Draco’s lips spread around his cock. Draco was all tongue and lips and the perfect hint of teeth and, even better, enthusiastic, for the task at hand. He sucked Harry down like he was starving for it, as though, by some miracle, he was enjoying this half as much as Harry was.
His fingers brushed the fabric of the jumper but he couldn't grab it without tipping onto the balls of his feet. His leg muscles tensing as he lifted higher.
"He knows quite a lot about what to do with bodies," Pansy said, her grin turning into a sly smile.
At least it wasn’t the war. Draco felt his shoulders slump and forced himself to sit up straight. “Does Granger-”
"No, Professor," Harry spit the word at her, "there's not a single-" he froze mid-rant as his mind filled in a name for the one female who fit the bill. He sank back into the chair and glanced at McGonagall, feeling defeated.
“Help?" Draco scoffed, slipping into his boxers and hanging up his bathrobe. "You were harassing him.”
Draco hooked a finger under Harry's chin so he looked up. "What's happened?"
Draco tore his eyes from the picture and searched the room, feeling desperate for an explanation. Spotting Emily, he rushed over to her, interrupting whatever pointless conversation she was having with a boy dressed as Hagrid.
By 9pm Draco was exhausted. He’d been swarmed by fans, mocked, hit on by every age, gender and class. Outright groped by some of them.
Next chapter will be about Draco's birthday 🤐😯
Harry shrugged,"Yeah, I still have my invisibility cloak, so-"
That seemed to reassure him. Astrid went to the door, knowing that her Dad wouldn’t pull away until she was safely inside. She rang the bell and waited for barely a breath before the door opened and she was welcomed in by Harry Potter.
arrived with Harry's picture and the headline that would later be shown to him in McGonagall's office,
“Why me?” Malfoy asks in lieu of responding to that statement.
Pansy huffed a humorless laugh, "Yeah right, Savior. I've been working with you every day this month. I've noticed that you're not all Gryffindor. You certainly have the sarcasm of a Slytherin. I suspect the issue is being raised in the wrong house, which is where you were taught to speak before you think."
Draco rolled his eyes, "Oh, come off it. You wouldn't be offended if I said that Granger is smarter than you."
“Fuck, I want you,” Potter pants out the words while rutting against Draco’s thigh, his hands grip hard into the blonde's biceps as the pleasure built from his toes and traveled up his body.
Draco closes his eyes and thinks about the way Hermione has been looking at him lately, about Pansy’s confession in the kitchen, and says simply, “Of course I can.”
Much to his dismay, Harry heard Draco chuckle into their kiss. He opened his eyes and looked at Draco, "Why are you laughing?"
“Both of you shut up.” Harry broke in, scowling at their twin smirks. “As for the trials, I only did what was right, you both saved my life.” Draco stopped smirking and his steel eyes softened ever so slightly.
The morning of the gala, Harry was sent home from Pansy’s studio with tailored black robes lined in silver embroidered lilies down the front. Pansy had met him there personally to give over the robes, telling him that Draco’s robes would match, the only difference being narcissus flowers instead of lilies. Harry was so shocked by the thoughtfulness of such a gift he found himself unsure of how to respond. Throat tight and unable to meet her eye, Harry choked out a ‘thank you,’ when she handed them over.
Harry dropped to his knees, tugging at the string that's lacing up the front of Draco's pants. He looked up, knowing Draco couldn't resist pleading eyes, and waited patiently for permission. "Please. I've been good for you."
Scorpius could feel a smile on his lips when he heard her excitement. He spent the next two hours answering her questions about the books, which ones she would need, and anything else that she thought of along the way.
He probably won't even think that you got the mobile number anyone. He'll just assume you told your phone that you're Harry Potter and the phone gave it to you, because that's how you live your life."
of them.
Say hi on Instagram @dracos.tealsuit
Harry looked up, hoping what he said would help, and found she was smiling. It was not a nice smile, then a peel of laughter filled the room. Harry had to lay there completely baffled, and wait until she had collected herself.
he thought. "I'm going on a datewithdraco," he swallowed through the dryness in his throat, "tonight."
Harry folded his arms and leaned back against the door frame. "I might be, yes," he replied.
As hot water sprayed down his body he thought about the previous night. He didn’t understand why Malfoy had to be such a prat about every little thing. Harry was only being curious. Though, Dumbledore had told in fourth year to exercise more caution around curiosity. He also reasoned that he probably could have asked just about anyone regarding the outcome of Lucius' trial.
Harry tried to regroup.
Harry felt his smile go a bit vicious, "Maybe you won't be able to work tonight. Might be distracted with me on your mind," he said.
Harry looked at the mess of stones on the ground. "Sorry Pansy," he said, his shoulders slumped. "I shouldn't have gone to that lunch."
"Is this because of what happened in New York?"
Dracos stomach swooped before settling somewhere beneath the soles of his shoes. Maybe talking to Anna had been a bad idea. "Whatever Potter," Draco said, fighting the urge to smile back at him. "Could they get in the way I did?"
Draco opened the door just enough to see who had knocked. "Blaise, what can I do for you?" he asked, letting the door swing open.
“I thought muggles like it when people smile in pictures,” Draco had said, thankful that he could use the term freely during this assignment.
"Bye Draco," she replied, all false innocence, as she watched him drag Potter away.
Harry chuckled and stepped close to Draco again, "Sorry," he said. "I just don't want to fuck this up before it starts."
Stunned, Blaise didn't respond, only watched Draco finish off the last of the Pumpkin juice. Finally he said, “You can’t be serious. What about the Sacred 28?”
,” Lucius leaned back slightly as Harry got closer, “I have started dating him, it could lead to true courting really, if I’m being honest with you.” Once he was about a foot away from Lucius he shrugged casually and stuffed his hands in his pockets, “You don’t mind him dating, do you?”
Harry waited.
"I really appreciate all your help," he replied. "This move would have been terrible without the two of you."
"Thank you," Hermione says. Then, to Draco, she says, "I'll see you this weekend."
Katie came back up to the store front. "Hello boys, sorry about that" she said sweetly. "Luna said I should be expecting you two. Come in and I will show you the new birds."
"This is teaching me a lot about your sexual experiences," Blaise said, his smile in full bloom.
He opened his browser to see the multiple AO3 tabs still open from the night before. With a long-suffering sigh, he started to categorize the tags, crossing off the ones that didn't apply as he went. For most of them, he wrote down little notes for Granger to read when he turned in the report.
Harry shot him a dirty look. “Shut it Malfoy, don’t be a prick.”
Anna gave Harry a slow once over, then winked and said, "The ice cream has always worked for me."
Harry nodded, not trusting his voice, his hand fisting around the soft fabric.
"Red curtain room?" George asked, mischief dancing in his eyes. Not that that meant anything. Draco had known this weasel all his life, there was always mischief in his eyes.
"What about- I mean, your engaged," Harry said.
Still holding eye contact, Harry reached out to stroke his thumb along Draco's dark mark, "This is about who you are Draco. Not who you were or how others see you, not your past, not your job. It's about you and me, just like it's always been."
Hermione wrote his answer on the parchment, "Age?"
"Where the hell are you taking me?" James trudged after Teddy through the gardens at Number 12. He hadn't planned on being outside in this weather. Or, rather, in the results of previous weather.
Ron smiled at Harry, his face flushed from the run, "Well mate, no wonder you didn't want to go to dinner."
Harry felt his eyebrows rise into his hairline,
"What should we play first?" Zabini asked once the bottle was safely stored away from Hermione. "Any requests?”
"Yes," Draco replied, his face impassive, "we all seem capable of making changes to the company we keep." His words sounded calm, but Harry could see the bar of tension between his shoulder blades.
Harry stood immediately, he'd finally figured out that she meant to duel him when she said the word 'monologue' and he was pleased. He hadn't been allowed to participate until today, and he was eager to fight someone with skill.
Draco grimaced at the thought. "I will acquiesce to your former request and call you Hermione."
"There you are!" Harry said as he started back towards the cat when the door to 394 opened.
"Bloody hell," Ron said, scrubbing a hand over his face. "Is there something in the fucking water at this school? You two I get, Charlie called that in fourth year-"
“Does an alcove count?” Hermione asked, and everyone turned to look at her. “I haven’t- I was just curious about the parameters.”
Draco set down his quill and turned to look at Blaise, studying his face. "Does this person speak French?"
Professor Loire was staring at the fireplace when Harry said, "I can leave with him. We can just leave."
"Right, of course." Dad chuckled and shook his head. "All right, you two have had enough. Go inside."
Harry swallowed thickly, his magic now wrapped around them both, drawing him in. "What if I'm just me? Not Harry Potter. Would you kiss me then?"
"I walked in on her making out with those two. I didn't know she was seeing them
"Tell me," Draco says, close enough to pant the words against Harry's lips.
Hermione sighed heavily, "As long as it doesn't get out of hand."
Once all of his paperwork is done and the latest sleeping drought is bottled, Draco apparates straight into his room. He needs to change and find Pansy. He pulls off all of his clothes, dropping them into the laundry basket which they promptly disappear from. Spades, Pansy’s house elf, had given him the basket when he first moved in. For a house elf, Spades was oddly cautious about privacy. Draco tugs on a pair of grey joggers and a light-blue long-sleeved shirt. Then heads downstairs, bare feet padding across the carpet, until he reached the kitchen.
Hermione and Harry both froze in place, staring wide eyed at Draco.
Draco stepped out of his dressing room and met his eye through the mirror’s reflection. Harry’s eyes dropped down to see Draco had rolled up the sleeves of his dress shirt to his elbows, leaving his forearms on display. Somehow, Draco's dark mark only made things harder. Images of pushing Draco against the wall and kissing him breathless flashed through his mind and his recently calmed erection returned full-force.
"You! You are what happened." Draco grabbed Harry's face, smashing his cheeks, and said, "Listen to the words I'm saying. I can't
Warning bells clang through his mind in a panic. The thought
Pansy turned over, facing away from Harry and spelled her curtain closed.
Glancing around to make sure they were still alone, Harry said, "I'll text you." He stepped back and disapparated.
