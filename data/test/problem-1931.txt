Draco sighed as if put upon, though he was glad no one was around to see the smile he couldn't seem to keep off his face.
the desire fades a bit. Also, I simply don’t enjoy waking up at six a.m. The rest of the day is usually not so fucking
Harry stiffened—Draco never touched him like that. They were really doing this. Harry looked at Hermione—wanting nothing more than to spill his guts about this situation he'd gotten himself into, but he couldn't. The only person he could discuss it with was Draco himself.
Except he has no idea, really. He can't help but wonder how his dad reacted when they'd found out about Harry. His parents had been only nineteen when they got pregnant, and Harry's long assumed it hadn't been intentional. What did they think? Had they freaked out?
wanted, Harry." Harry's stomach drops. "And you need to realise that you can't rely on other people to make you feel wanted. This isn't about any of that."
Draco's face has that Malfoy-mask quality. With a measured tone, he says, "I wouldn't have blamed you, if you did."
"What was that?" Harry asked, a cocky grin on his face. Smug bastard. He leaned forward and tugged Draco's hands away from his mouth.
"Thank you for agreeing to see me, Mr Malfoy," Harry said, standing straighter than usual and adopting a public-speaking tone that he never used when actually speaking in public. "First, I'm concerned that the party position on climate change mitigation doesn't go far enough."
"Family," Harry said, unsure whether his voice sounded like he was agreeing or if it sounded wistful. "Right."
Ginny stands up, tugging her pyjama top off and rummaging, topless, in her drawers for a bra and t-shirt. "Nothing. Right now, there's nothing we can do. You have to go to the Wizengamot, and I have to go make sure George is okay. We'll talk about it later. Unfortunately, it'll keep."
"No, I meant little-u untraceable, not capital-U Untraceable. Just using Muggle methods." Scorpius grinned conspiratorially. "Albus and I learned how to hatchet."
for the ads I did for Sleekeazy's. I've got plenty for the tiny castle." James paused, looking up at the ceiling and around the kitchen. "Actually, it probably cost less than this place. Despite it being a castle and everything. How much did this bedsit set you back, Draco?"
"Don't you hate it?" Draco burst after a moment. "The Head of DMLE's role is almost entirely paperwork. You hate paperwork. You hate rote tasks. You like excitement and saving people and doing good. You enjoyed being an Auror well enough because of all that, even though I think you hated even
Harry wants to cry. He could, easily. It would require letting down the approximately one mental barrier he's keeping up. But he can't. He can't make it about him
"No one cares about your little 'legal violations'," Rump sneered. "And Potter, the reason your clothes are inappropriate is that I said they are, and you didn't respect it. And yes, Western magic needs to be safeguarded. This is Magical Britain! Our traditions must be upheld—"
“Phase One is complete,” Hermione said as she slid into a booth at the pub and took a long sip of lager.
Harry jogs into the bedroom, returning empty-handed a moment later. "And I went to see Teddy the other day, and I was thinking you could come with me next time, if you want? Because you're right, he's my family now, he and Andromeda, and they're your family too, kind of. It's weird, and I'm totally not okay with it, but I will be."
"Oy, lad," Wilhelm bellowed from his pocket, "you forgot how that husband of yours showed up incognito!"
He walked into the restaurant, the door clanking behind him, and offered a sad smile befitting the occasion to the hostess. "I'm meeting Draco Malfoy for lunch."
years ago, but Draco had a look in his eye that stopped him. Harry's mind started boggling, trying to decide whether Draco was suggesting that
managed to make decisions that were arguably ethical, he'd thought they meant certain death. He remembered, like it was yesterday, being sure he'd die when he lied about Harry's identity at the Manor.
propose inflicting trauma on the entire populace?" She inclined her head meaningfully towards Albus and Scorpius and Nico grimaced, realising his gaffe.
"Exactly," Wilhelm agreed, hinging at the waist to touch his little boots, some morning calisthenics. "Her name is Wanda, and she organises everything. From what I can gather, she's not too happy about his lack of appreciation for her considerable filing skill."
"The WCLU is already working on it," Draco reminded Albus. "The Ministry has no right to surveil people with a Taboo like that."
Harry crosses his arms over his chest, feeling inept. "It was a last-minute thought." What? Is Malfoy going to kick him out now—because he showed up without his bag? He thought they'd gotten past their enmity, especially given all the remedial video game lessons Harry's been providing.
Harry realised that it was possible they were now talking without the influence of the potion. It was hard to say, but this didn't seem to be about imagination. But he kept talking anyway. “A lot of reasons,” Harry said. “We changed too much. Also, if you hadn’t realised, I’m pretty messed up right now. She couldn’t understand. Ginny’s always about doing things. She couldn’t understand that I didn’t want to do anything.” Harry sighed. “I mean. I think she’s better off. We’re still friends.”
James grabbed another muffin and kissed Harry on the head. “Thank you both. Really. I’m going to sleep for like ten hours.” He turned and jogged up the stairs.
stuff, you realise," Draco said, unsure why this was getting his hackles up. "It's not like I think money buys love."
It's strange—Harry has never really been in an arcade, either. He remembers being made to stand outside one while the Dursleys went inside. He'd seen Dudley playing games at home on a series of consoles before he inevitably broke them, but Harry'd only been able to play Dudley's games the rare times he was alone.
Harry's caught between relief that Malfoy's face lost that sex look and offence that Malfoy was able to lose that look so easily. What the hell is going on here? Does Malfoy think Harry is fit or not? Does he only think so when he's three sheets to the wind?
Harry shoves his hands into Sirius's jacket pockets and leans against the wall outside the Troc, looking up at the giant statue of Sonic the Hedgehog. Malfoy is late. Harry cannot believe this is his life. After weeks of seeing each other regularly, they've been asking each other questions about their coursework and have come to fairly friendly terms. So he's agreed to take Malfoy to SegaWorld, to introduce him to video games.
"Good morning," Penelope said, after she'd finished with some papers at her desk and settled into her chair. "Today we're going to talk about your experience with the potion and look at your Thought Records. Depending how far we get, we can discuss types of unhelpful thoughts and how best to interrupt them. Do either of you have anything you'd like to start with?"
“Well,” Draco said, leaning on the poshness of his voice, “I suppose that’s today’s enactment of newlywed behaviour ticked off the list.”
He wondered what Draco would be wearing today. Maybe he'd wear some kind of Muggle skirt suit. Harry thought that might be a good choice for Draco, especially combined with his strong shoulders. Harry'd always had a thing for people with strong shoulders. He suspected it was related to Quidditch.
I start to chuckle—my emotions are all over the place, and there's just something so funny about Harry Potter lamenting not getting laid. Almost anyone at Hogwarts would've obliged, really.
But then Jorgen smiled, having finally pushed his way through the crowd. He tugged Harry and Draco close and said, out of breath, "The baby is coming. So far so good. Albus and Scorpius want you at St Mungo's."
!" Harry shouted. "If we adopted a Kneazle, it'd die of old age before we could stop the charade. Everywhere we go. In front of the entire nation. For twelve years."
Harry reached out without thinking, his hand magnetised towards the beard, but he stopped himself when he realised how awkward that was. “Can I touch it?”
"Second," Harry interrupted, "we need to get rid of all the 'he or she's in the party platform. It's offensive to all trans and non-binary people
"Draco. I have been there," Harry said. "Many times. I helped host an engagement party in your house."
Draco’s face contorted into a rictus of disgust. “Get. It. Off. Me! I don’t want to smash it and get butterfly guts all over my
A man wearing an expensive-looking Muggle suit stepped inside far too familiarly for Harry's liking. Jorgen's too, judging from the way his assistant subtly raised his wand from the file cabinet to the door.
They down their shots and Harry leads Malfoy back to the general vicinity where he left Hermione. He finds her leading a small conga line around the back corner of the room while the speakers blast Brandy and Monica's "The Boy is Mine."
“I’m not going to make you switch sides of the bed,” Harry said, sliding into the bed from the other side.
way. So it was strange when Scorpius and Albus became friends, when they became boyfriends. It was like watching my childhood play out on an alternate timeline. But that was fine—I had a different life; I didn't have regrets. It wasn't like I thought I could've ended up with Harry if I'd done things differently—that could
over her knees. Ron had one arm around Hermione's shoulders, wand in his other hand, flipping pages.
But I'm so tired—every inch of me, physical and mental, aches. Even poking Potter has lost its lustre.
Draco winced. "I have no self control, Harry! Do you honestly think I could say no to you, in bed?!"
They change their clothes, Hermione putting on a pair of low-rise jeans and a shirt that shows her navel, and Harry puts on a black dress shirt. He feels a little like a tool, but whatever.
A crease appeared between Draco's eyes. For a moment, it looked like he wasn't going to say anything, but then he straightened his shoulders and said, "By 'this shite', am I to take it that you mean all of it—your living situation, hating the guest room, being here with me during Rump's tenure? Because I would hope that if something is bothering you, you'd have the decency to tell me so we could make it right. I take no pleasure in ruining your life for a decade, despite what my younger self would've had to say on the matter."
Harry leaned forward, looking around at the people in the restaurant, and whispered, "Were we having sex, I suppose it might be relevant? Maybe? If you want to make stereotyped jokes about being able to get into various sex positions? But we did not agree to
Harry groans, not wanting to think about what any of this means. "I went over to Draco's before. He yelled at me."
Andromeda clatters around in the kitchen, looking through cupboards and jotting things down on a sheet of parchment. "I was hoping you'd be willing to sit with him for a bit while I run to the market?"
Harry thought of all the times Draco yawned and excused himself from the sitting room, wandering upstairs, and raised his shoe again.
?!” Draco hissed, his cheeks turning bright red. He was whispering, but loud enough for a mother standing near them to fix them with dirty looks as she ushered her children away from the cursing middle-aged men.
with his eyebrows while chewing a bite of buttered bread. Draco rolled his eyes slightly as he turned back to his food, and Harry noticed the way his fingers fiddled with agita under the table, out of sight of everyone else.
She paused to let her words sink in, and Harry struggled to look past the sappy, cliched words to try to find her meaning underneath.
He stepped forward and touched Draco's arm. "I think you're forgetting that you're sleeping with the head of the DMLE." He had Draco's attention. "Help me figure out a way to make sure this doesn't result in prosecutions? I was thinking that, first, we can stall by saying we need a few months to draft a new policy. Then we can ask for an extension. Second, we can change the definition of 'reasonable grounds for suspicion' so that the use of foreign incantations isn't enough." Harry stopped. That was as far as he'd gotten. "What else?"
"We're not in bed," Draco parried, and really he should've seen it coming—Harry grabbed Draco's bicep and Apparated them directly onto their bed.
Harry arched, looking up at the ceiling—which he and Draco had spelled last month to mimic the night sky, like Harry's bedroom in his old house. He glimpsed the stars, closed his eyes, and smiled.
Harry accepted a mug from Albus and sat. "Right. Erm. I wanted to check in with you. About how you're feeling about me and Draco."
"You're embarrassing," Harry retorted, his voice a soft echo of the schoolyard taunts that used to comprise the entirety of their interactions.
Harry's main school-related problem is that Hermione isn't in any of his classes, so he can't ask her questions about the reading. Not that she ever really liked it when he did that, mind. Harry talks to think, and Hermione thinks to talk. Or maybe she just thinks, then talks. Or who knows what Hermione does, anyway, but she doesn't require talking in order to understand her thoughts on what she's read, like Harry does.
Harry saw a queue up ahead. Though the queue stayed orderly, the waiting people all looked antsy. Some of them were checking their magic-powered mobiles, others were reading the
The witch behind Harry poked him in the back with the metal duck to get him to move forward in the queue.
"I didn't think it was a lie!" Harry claimed, laughing. "Fuck if I know how the Veritaserum is interpreting the question. Maybe it's only looking at technical merit, not performance or interpretation."
to see whether you should stop studying and go to bed. Anyway, I talked to Ginny. I apologised for acting like an arse about the abortion. We...I think we'll be okay. I mean, she's never going to forget about how I acted, but we at least, like, communicated."
This was bizarre. Harry wasn't used to comforting anyone who wasn't one of his kids or an employee. And truthfully, he kind of sucked at comforting employees—that balance between empathy and superiority always left Harry feeling awkward. But he couldn't leave Draco spiraling like this.
Harry rolled his eyes. There was no malice in Draco's words the way there would've been decades ago. "Yes, get on with it."
me! Which, let's be honest, we're two allosexual gay men—what was I supposed to think! Don't you think the vast majority of allosexual gay men would be turned on by kissing another man like that?! Why would I think that meant you were having
“We’ve made it clear that their tiny minds are so entrenched in the gender binary,” Draco drawled, “that they are blind to the ways they failed to encode it.”
He pulls a large wooden bowl out of the bag and walks to place it on the counter. "For crisps or popcorn. I also talked to Hermione, and she basically thinks you're totally right. She couldn't stop laughing at me. Apparently I have a long history of avoiding my feelings."
"Hey," she said, wagging a finger. "I'm twenty-nine in a few weeks. Surely that counts as 'almost thirty.'" Lily told anyone who would listen that she couldn't wait to be "a crone."
She was doing a similar exercise, only with the aim of stopping her obsessive worrying. Except Hermione, ever the good student, had filled in every column of every row and had to append extra parchment to contain her thoughts on the matter. Ron’s workshop focussed on overcoming fears, or something, but Ron’s parchments were completely blank.
Hermione's going to change the world in London, where Harry will be. So they've rented a flat. Harry can't wait. Hermione is best suited to be his roommate out of all his friends, including Ron. Harry and Hermione are the friend equivalent of a power couple.
Someone from across the park screamed, "You can't even land a 180, you fucking wanker, don't try me!"
On the first night of the year, Hermione had Transfigured the two beds into one enormous bed, and since then, Hermione and Ron would fall asleep each night wrapped up in each other with Harry, who slept on the other side of the bed, an arm’s distance away. When they were awake and not at lessons, they covered the bed with books as they studied, napped, and ate biscuits they hoarded from the Great Hall. By the end of each day the duvet was covered with crumbs and ink stains, and once, a melted Cadbury Flake.
Ron starts talking about inviting people from their old Quidditch team—apparently Angelina lives nearby—but Harry's not listening. What a nightmare. If they invite Cho, all the people Harry's ever had an awkward sexual encounter with will be in the same room together.
It seemed, suddenly, a bit silly. Here they were discussing the need to abstain from sex to keep their cover, when their exact situation provided them with a person to have sex with. Just like Harry couldn't talk about their fake relationship with anyone else, but he could talk about it with Draco. Was it really any different?
"Are you sure you're not just talking about your reaction to him? You've always had a strong reaction to him."
"I think it was a birthing stool," Scorpius said. Then he stood up straight, his eyes twinkling. "Albus. Al! I think that was a birthing stool!" Scorpius started wiggling his fingers, like the nervous energy had to find a way out of his body.
“I can think of lots of evidence to support my conclusion that every job sucks,” Harry said, and he saw, out of the corner of his eye, Malfoy cover a half-smile.
They'd collected Harry's bags and personal effects, said quick farewells to the people in the DMLE offices, and made it into the corridor (where, indeed, there was a large crowd, including photographers—Harry could only assume that Rump had instructed Security to allow them in to witness Harry's supposed humiliation, though many of them seemed to be shouting for Harry and Draco to kiss) when Jorgen burst out of the door behind them and started pushing through the crowd.
Harry gapes, torn between shock at being pelted with baked goods and a double-take at Malfoy's assessment of Harry's dateability. "Well if that's all I need, you must think I should be dating you."
Harry's breath caught. Malfoy was giving him an out, a chance to move away, a chance to play it like nothing had happened, but he was staring at Harry's lips and touching Harry's knee and Harry didn't have to worry he was imagining it, because it was already happening.
“Yes, Potter,” Malfoy drawled, finally speaking. “Thank you. Being forced to sit in the same room with each other and to observe basic manners is exactly the same as the time I refused to identify you to my insane aunt or the time you flew me to safety out of literal Fiendfyre. Thank you for that helpful analogy.”
"You're the head of the party," Harry said, attaching his lips to Draco's neck, "you can do anything."
Harry glances at Ginny. She seems to be making a renewed effort to eat. Harry hopes she doesn't end up vomiting at the table.
Ron pushed Draco out of the way. “Don’t listen to him, Harry. But it’s a moot point, because you know they wank over you no matter what you wear.”
Harry laughed, jiggling Draco's ribs. "I can do that. Maybe we should have a nightly airing of grievances."
Harry's chest clenches, and he turns, horrified, to look at Draco. He can't bring himself to ask what, exactly, "got rid of" means in this context.
"Don't wanna talk about it." Harry crowds into Draco's space, making to kiss him again, but Draco shoves him off.
was like now, but he wasn't thinking about it when he and Harry walked back home after a Saturday morning walk through the park with a stop at one of the ubiquitous Muggle cafes. They walked next to each other, shoulders bumping as they sipped their coffee from paper cups, the wind filled with the bite of January air.
Harry picked at a thread on his jeans. He wasn’t an anxious person, but he always felt a bit anxious in here. “Happiness.”
Harry laughed. "You two make it look easy," he said, which was kind of a lie but it seemed like an encouraging thing to say.
"It's strange," Draco said in a careful tone as they turned the corner, "seeing you with Ginny. It's hard to imagine why you got divorced. You act like a happy couple, even now."
My father shouts, and my eyes flit around the room: Potter's hand, my father screaming, a corpse, a rat, the pain radiating from my arm, Potter's hand.
"Cooking," Harry offers weakly, gesturing to the absolutely trashed kitchen. Every surface is covered with tools and ingredients and splatters. There's a half-spatula-half-spoon that seems to be slowly morphing back into its original form.
"Seriously, listen," Albus said, his mouth full of mashed potatoes. "We start a page on social media geared towards Gen Z. We make some graphics telling people how they can resist Rump."
Ron's going to work at WWW with George and do home study to sit his N.E.W.T.s next summer. He had wanted to sign the lease with Harry and Hermione, but Hermione had point blank refused. She says their relationship is still too fragile after "last year"—which they all know is a euphemism for "Ron leaving them alone in the tent"—and she wants her own space. Ron pointed out that she is willing to share her space with
Every word she says makes Harry feel like a bigger piece of arse lint. He'd been so caught up in his own shit that day—he'd never really stopped to think about that day from Ginny's perspective. What is
they tell me that I have to wear it so that I can look like their idea of what it means to be a woman!”
Awhile later, while the stereo's blasting "Bulletproof...I Wish I Was", Hermione comes in and sits on the bed without saying anything. When he doesn't send her away, she crawls into bed next to him, wrapping an arm around him, and squeezes.
"No," Draco said, leaning in and smiling at Aster. He glanced over his shoulder at Harry. "She's named for both."
Wilhelm frowned, his ginger wooden eyebrows slanting inward. "Is everything alright, Harry? You don't usually leave right away, if you don't mind my saying. And you forbid me alerting you early enough to ensure your punctuality."
If our only hope is Potter mimicking his memory of what Dumbledore looked like while practicing magic, we're going to be here for a while. But I keep my mouth shut.
Harry pushed back out of the flames and brushed himself off. He hated kneeling in the Floo, but after days of trying to text Albus to meet, he'd bitten the wand. He looked around the kitchen, grabbed the coffee pot, and stepped back into the Floo.
The pretending to be Draco's lover, on the whole, was strange. It was largely strange because most of the time, Harry forgot about it. They went about their lives—in closer proximity to each other than before, to be sure—but acting much the same as always. But then, when other people were around, there were moments like this—him touching Draco or Draco touching him—and Harry never quite saw the latter coming. He continually forgot that he was supposed to be pretending, and then Draco would do something like this and Harry would be hyper aware of the heat of Draco's hand on his shoulder—of the way that an unfamiliar touch felt twenty times more noticeable than it should. It made tingles erupt down his spine, and he sat up, turning to look at Draco and giving a smile he hoped the kids would think looked content.
At this, Malfoy heaved a put-upon sigh and stepped behind the witch, letting her go first. She flashed him a grin and waved the deck of cards in his face. "Indeed, indeed!" she cackled.
"Malfoy!" she says, sticking out her tongue. "I can't believe it, but there you go. Well, I can believe it. I've been having fun with him too. We really need to work on our 'Everybody' dance some more. We were getting really close. But Harry, you
I look around. The magic that Potter has manifested in the form of a chain is in the far right corner of the dungeon, visible from the door, but to the side. We've arranged the bodies across from the door.
Lily arrived with her boyfriend Nico, at whom Harry couldn't suppress a bit of an eye roll. The bloke was insufferable, always prattling on about things like gut health and coffee machines. Harry kept thinking Lily would come to her senses. Draco kept telling him that Nico was clearly just nervous, intimidated by his girlfriend's very famous father, but Harry thought this was no excuse for Nico's tedium, especially since Harry was always perfectly nice and welcoming.
"He's fine, Aunt Hermione!" Lily said, grabbing Harry's hand and placing it in Draco's. "We're all fine!"
Harry turned towards Draco, propping his head up on his hand. "Let me get this straight. You read smutty novels?"
Harry looks into the bag, pulling out two small boxes. "Oh! This is for my flat, I guess, not yours. Two more games for the NES: Mario Brothers and Tetris."
"You're such a slob." Draco wiped his mouth delicately with his napkin. "So tomorrow let's go out somewhere visible again. Flourish and Blotts to browse the books? Out for a nightcap at the Drunken Cat? What do you fancy?"
It was almost enough to make him wish he'd joined Hermione in KonMari back in the twenty-teens. Almost.
Hermione is sitting at the kitchen counter with an older woman Harry doesn't recognise. They're having tea, and the teapot next to them isn't the one they bought on Brick Lane, but a fancy-looking one.
comes from the word for 'weaver'? Because what does it mean to be a wife? It means you sit around making garments." Draco paused, then looked up, all wild intensity. "I don't want
Harry's not sure how he should feel. He maybe just sent a message to his parents. Or maybe not. Hermione'd told him it was simply the act of putting the words down on paper that was meaningful, and she's probably right. But Harry, looking at Hermione's and Draco's faces in the shadow of the blue flames, thinks this is nice too.
"How do people escape from magical spaces, anyway?" I ask aloud, more to myself than to Potter. I've read a lot of mysteries in my day; I should be able to think of something. "Like, people do it."
"You donated it…to Hogwarts?" Harry tried to integrate that with what he knew about Draco, another tiny clue making the full picture a bit clearer.
"It is an important job!" Harry said, taken aback. "I needed to do it—to make sure that our law enforcement doesn't fuck people over! I, of all people, know how important it is for authority to be kept in check."
"Why hello, little one!" Harry's voice was always impossibly warm whilst cooing at babies. "Welcome back to the land of the waking!"
Draco's mouth drops open. He shoves Harry back onto the bed, and Harry erupts into laughter. "I don't think that
"Yes, you look smashing." Draco dropped his hands as he looked around the office. "What are you doing, packing up all evidence of your years of wrongdoing?"
Hermione had then shown up with a box of magical pride paints that would take on the stripes of different pride flags when you smeared them onto something. Draco grabbed the bottle with the bi colors, covered his hands in it, snuck up behind Harry, and pressed his hands onto Harry's cutoff-clad arse.
Harry smiled and looked out across the lake. “I see my friends a lot. I get a new little house somewhere. In the country, maybe, where I can fly. I get a crup or something. Find a job I enjoy, or not, whatever makes me happy. Find a partner who makes me laugh. Maybe have kids.” Harry paused. “I don’t want fancy stuff. I feel like I’ve had enough big dreams. I just want the normal stuff now.”
When he got to Penelope's office, he wasn't sure whether he should look at Malfoy and pretend to smile like nothing was weird, or ignore him, or make some excuse for having cancelled their plans. Fortunately Malfoy made the decision for him by staring resolutely ahead, into Penelope's fire, not so much as glancing at Harry.
"I'm not, I—" Draco stopped talking. His eyes were a sparkling grey, his cheeks pink with the excitement of the day. Harry watched as Draco's gaze dropped to Harry's lips.
to stay—he had no intention of staying—but something in Malfoy's demeanour makes him feel like crap. Like it's yet another addition to a long line of casual dismissals in Harry's life.
As they stand there attempting mass market Muggle dance moves, Harry feels the strangest sense of camaraderie. Harry might be a misfit, but he's not the only one. There's a glimmer of hope that they can find a way to belong in their unbelonging, that their messed up family situations and their war scars can serve as a source of togetherness, not just while coordinating their forearms, but like, going forward.
“Yes, that’s exactly my goal in life,” Draco said as they headed toward the Butterfly House. “To one-up my parents in all of their bizarre life choices.”
Al groaned, dropping his head into his hands. Scorpius, rubbing Albus's back consolingly, tried unsuccessfully to stop a smile.
Draco’s laughter was so loud it startled a boy looking at the gorillas. “What did they do? And you didn’t know you were a wizard? How did your aunt and uncle cover for you?”
Draco smiled, uncharacteristically allowing himself the tiniest measure of pride at his new position. Pride was toxic to the Malfoy constitution. Pride was like—like an addictive potion. Like heroin.
Harry drowsed against a pile of pillows, opening his eyes when he heard Hermione’s warm laugh from the other side of the bed. He sat up, righting the book that had fallen off his knees while he napped.
Draco was flooded with an image of Snape superimposed on that musical group Albus and Scorpius had liked when they were tweens, the one that sang about the black parade, but surrounded by fields of herbs and community farming. He shook his head. "Er, great. I think that would be one of the last things you'll do."
Draco's eyes lit up. He set down the paper. "Oooh, is this where I finally learn about all the skeletons in your closet? All the misdeeds and fame-seeking?"
“With this retrograde tripe the Ministry is passing off as a dress code,” Draco spat. “It’s one thing if it’s an old policy, but this is
Harry didn't answer with words, and before long Draco grabbed Harry's wrist and Apparated them to the bedroom. Before Harry could even catch his balance, Draco grabbed the hem of Harry's jumper and yanked it off. As soon as it came over Harry's head and arms, it Transfigured back into the kurta from earlier in the day, but Harry barely noticed as the shiny red fabric fell to the ground, as Draco's hands had grabbed Harry's waist, his cold hands pressing firmly into the soft skin of Harry's middle.
“Okay, change of plans!” Penelope announced with a clap of her hands. “We’re not going to sit around hashing out all of the reasons we have to be depressed. That’s exactly what we’re trying to avoid. I have a new assignment for you. Next week, during this time, please head to the advanced Potions classroom in the dungeon.”
his hair.) Hermione stepped into the Floo first and was whooshed away practically mid-sentence in planning for the new committee.
"It's working just fine!" Ron said, casting some sort of masking charm on the ceiling just in time to prevent the shoddy roller from getting coral paint splotches on the white ceiling. Ron turned to look at Harry, and when he did, he immediately cast a Stasis Charm at the roller, which hovered in midair on the wall. "What's wrong?"
The queue didn't extend out onto the pavement as it did during the weekday commute, but there was still a wait, and the place was filled with a more diverse crowd—parents keeping their children quiet with processed sugar, a group of cackling witches who must all have been over a hundred years old, a surly goblin drinking what looked to be a chai latte, a harried-looking wizard writing furiously with a peacock quill.
"Okay," Harry said, rolling back his shoulders. "I can do this. If they don't let me come back here, you will bring my bag—?"
Harry and Draco looked at each other for a long moment, then Draco said, "Right. We should—we should make a hamper for his new house. Food and things he'll need."
Harry burst out laughing. “Oh, sweet Merlin. Poor James. He’s been put through the wringer. He just went through like five years’ worth of relationship feelings in two months.
Harry has a new toy for Teddy—it's a little dragon that makes puffs of coloured smoke. The dragon's been sitting on Harry's bureau forlornly. It senses that everyone in the flat is too old to play with it, so it sits there, bored, inspecting its scales. Harry's tried to play with it, but it gave him this look like,
Harry was looking at Draco, but Draco didn't turn his head. "I agreed," Harry said quietly, "because he was right. That's what I thought—he's right. If Draco ran, and if he were married to me, I thought—he'd win."
There was an odd, strangled noise. Draco and Harry looked around, confused for a moment until they realised that Aster was covering Wilhelm's face with her fist. Harry persuaded her to relinquish Wilhelm's head, and Wilhelm said, sotto voce, "It's very serious in there. No idea what they're up to. Haven't heard
Harry's brain doesn't want to be back in the Manor at the end of the war, or up on the Astronomy Tower. His mind is fixated on the fact of a tiny, growing bundle of cells in Ginny's belly. A growing bundle of cells, half of which came from Harry. It is too much for his mind to comprehend, really, and he thinks he's doing pretty well when he makes it to his seat only slamming his shin into an armrest once.
When the results of their first experiment with a condom are in the bin, and their bodies are cleaned, lying unhurried in bed, Draco says, "You know Hermione's your family, right? It may not be...traditional, but that doesn't make it any less real."
Hermione lets loose a manic cackle. "So what you're saying is that Malfoy made some bad decisions in the war, decisions he couldn't easily take back, even though when the time came he did what he could to save Harry?"
“I’ve worn these every day for the past two years!” Harry looked down at his trainers in disbelief. “I haven’t—”

Harry laughs and walks over to Draco, then shoves his hands into his pockets. "Are we okay? I'm sorry I ran out yesterday. I was overwhelmed."
Draco was on his back, face scrunched up in silent laughter, hand wiping a tear from his eye. “His face. Oh, sweet Merlin, James’s face.” He heaved an inhale.
“Hey Harry,” Hermione said. “Listen to this. Ron tried to get a book about sex from the library, only the Hogwarts library doesn’t really have any sex books, as we all found out in about year two, so what he found was this, in with the Muggle anatomy books.”
The thing about conversations was that once you didn't have them, they got harder and harder to initiate.
It was like play-acting his ideal life while knowing it was fake, but Harry couldn't quite find it in him to care because he and Draco were getting married and their families and friends were
"How about this?" Harry said, clearing his throat. "Draco and I pretended to be in love because we thought it would be smart politically. Neither of us gave a crap about our own personal lives, so we didn't care whether we were throwing our personal lives away. We have no sense of self worth, so we were willing to shack up together and pretend to be in love despite the fact that we're not. All of this is true even though our children are married, and it was possible that we could hurt them in the process." He paused. "How was that? Did I forget anything?"
jumper. But knowing Draco’s jeans (well tailored) and Draco’s jumpers (generally cashmere), Harry had to admit that it would be an appropriate outfit for the zoo, the theatre, and, indeed, most restaurants. Draco, at fifty-six, seemed to have cracked the Muggle code.
Harry repeatedly tapped the button to take a photo. He wanted every moment of this documented. “Smile! Then I’ll get it off.”
Most times, Harry had no trouble paying attention to discussion of Lily's charms, but at the moment, all he could think about was the way Lily's faith in his and Draco's relationship made him feel like the toxic sludge at the bottom of one of Lily's contaminated rivers.
“Speak for yourself,” Draco says, looking back at the paper. George’s spiky handwriting spells out the magical proof for the potion. The Age-Regression part is straightforward, he just needs to find the part where they incorporate the desire of the subject.
Harry's head whipped to the side to see Malfoy sitting there, looking at him. Malfoy wasn't smirking or teasing or revelling in his superiority.
Draco pulled his hand away, used it to lightly smack Harry's cheek, then placed it caressingly back, thumb resuming its path.
Hermione pauses it. "No, no! We're doing it all wrong. We need to practice the arms of this part. We're not together with the swinging of the forearms. First you swing left, see?"
We manage, somehow, to focus on the task. I spell a slim neck onto the creature and turn the fur on the top of its head black. I give it green eyes and shrink its teeth. I change the shape of its skull, removing the snout, and turn the nose into a more-or-less human organ. I glance at Potter to gauge skin tone. Turns out rat skin is pink-white under the fur, so I have to darken it considerably. It comes out looking a bit like a rat went overboard with a Suntan Solution, but this whole endeavor is never going to hold up under close scrutiny, anyway.
it's hard to throw off Imperius, but it's not impossible. I meant I think we can do it, even if it's hard."
The flat is packed with people, and Harry is managing to enjoy it. He's missed so many of these faces. Seamus and Neville and Dean and Luna. Parvati and Lavender. George and Percy. Terry Boot, who's with them at RAmag, and Padma, who's with Hermione studying law.
“Well, yes, but also—it would seem like we’re giving tacit approval to the idea that this can be solved privately rather than through the government, which is firmly
"Yeah," Harry said, rubbing his hand on Dominique's back and hoping it wasn't obvious to Bill that he was using the baby to distract himself.
James jumped out of his seat and high-fived Teddy. "Oh, brilliant. You're never going to get over how incredible I will be. I will be the new standard for all Weasley weddings."
?! But the other part of Harry clenched with sadness—was that what Draco's marriage had been like? For all Harry and Ginny had fought, it had never been a
After a moment of silence, Lee said, "Let's get some photos? I told my photographer to wait outside until I called her in, but now I'm really wishing she'd been here to snap a photo of that kiss."
Harry sniggered like a schoolboy, but there was also a flush (pleased or embarrassed?) on his cheeks. "I understand what you're saying. But what
"I don't know if the other people in your life sit around laughing about your self-abnegation, but I don't find it funny."
Harry frowned, wondering how Wilhelm knew anything about the state of the screws on his clock, but decided to drop it. He never understood how Wilhelm knew
No one else caught it, but Draco saw Harry flinch, his shoulders and back tensing as if he'd just been punched.
Hermione left, and the loud music made Harry's sloshy brain feel yet more sloshy. He let himself slump against Draco, who was holding his hand, and Draco positioned them into a much-too-formal dancing position as the children jumped around them like possessed chimpanzees.
Draco blinked, perplexed, and watched as Harry started crying too, with Hermione's arms around him, telling him he deserved—what?
“The charges against the accused are as follows,” a man in plum-coloured robes says, “treason, in that he did knowingly and willingly enter into Tom Riddle’s service.”
"Ah," Draco said, smiling meanly, "but you forget that they are proud of being arseholes. Being anti-love is probably part and parcel of their PR strategy."
"But—it's your house. This house probably costs, what?" Harry stood and spun around inspecting the moulding. "Six or seven million pounds? What's that in Galleons, like two million? You can't just
Harry shrugged. "Fine. Good." Harry nudged Malfoy's elbow to let him know it was his turn to order.  From his place behind, Harry could hear Malfoy greet Wren and again order his usual.
Harry bursts out laughing, imagining Draco Malfoy trying to retrofit a Muggle flat to run entirely on magic.
"Leftist tchotchkes?" Harry sat up, ready to bodily intervene. "Like what? A tiny crystal sickle and hammer?"
"How about we go to the Rowdy Growler? They show Quidditch in hologram, and we can still whine about the world going to shit. That's what pubs are for."
"It's hard to watch people make mistakes you once made," Harry whispered, leaning his elbows onto the table.
Harry's feet slide sideways, out from under him, and he lands with a crash on his front, his hands just catching him.
Malfoy opened his mouth to answer, but just then a to-go cup flew over on paper wings. When it hovered in front of his hands, the wings transformed into a sleeve. Malfoy grabbed his drink, said a terse, "Take care," and walked quickly out of the cafe.
"Was that Backstreet Boys?" Harry asks, momentarily distracted and trying to place which song it was so he can torture Draco about it forever. "You know what, nevermind." He needs to focus.
then, Potter. You've my rapt attention, ready to hear your grievances. The grievances can be about me or about other issues."
, you know, just relationship—was awkward, like the whole trying-to-kill-each-other thing, not the fact that Harry had
This day, he was strung out—overwhelmed from LabMag meetings and the content of those meetings. And when he stepped out of the Floo, it was to a cacophony.
"How was your workshop with Penelope today?" Hermione asked, turning towards Harry and bending her knees as Ron settled in behind her, freckled arm draped over her torso.
"Do you need an imagination potion?" Ron asked, looking at Harry over Hermione's sleepy head. "To imagine he could be better?"
After the addenda have been added to the letter, Hermione adds the peat moss and lavender to the cauldron and conjures the flames according to the instructions. The flames turn a bright, brilliant blue and shoot into the air with a roaring
tell me you aren't about to tell me a sob story about how hard life is for former Death Eaters or Slytherins or whatever. Because I will—" Harry grasped wildly for his best point of leverage; his eyes landed on his wedding robes. "I will stand you up at the altar."
Draco elbowed Harry as he passed by with a bowl of Pepper Imps. "I told you," he whispered, "that you weren't giving Nico a chance."
“I can’t believe you wore those shorts to the office,” Draco said the second they were out of the Floo. “I can actually see your arse cheeks. My handprints didn’t even fit on those shorts—the bottom of my palms are missing, and you walked around with that part of the paint on your arse for the rest of the day.”
but what came out was, "Yes, kind of." Draco's mouth dropped open, shocked at his own answer. "What? I mean—I thought—I thought I could convince you to agree. Because I knew you cared as much as I did about Rump getting elected. And I guess that's manipulation."
Harry sighs. "Yes, I know. She didn't do anything wrong. Obviously I'm glad she had the choice. It's just—I thought we had a different kind of relationship, where we'd talk to each other."
And perhaps they spent most of their free time together, even on weekends, rather than Apparating to see other friends and relations. It doesn’t mean anything. It
“People don’t see you that way, either,” Harry says, and Draco somehow expects him to be taking the piss, but when he meets Harry’s eyes, all he sees is openness and honesty.
Draco ignored this heroic claim. "Who has the power to change the Hogwarts curriculum—is it McGonagall?"
“Don’t bother.” Draco closed his eyes in resignation. “This way we know that the cardboard is Vanished properly. Plus, who am I to rob him of the joy of showing me the newest addition to his Martin Miggs Funko Pop collection? And his battery-powered massaging back pillow?”
Harry snorted, spraying caramel foam on his nose. "You have nothing to worry about. And I can confirm it will be a mind-trip watching her grow up. Sometimes I forget that you're grown, and you're in your twenties."
"You fit in here," Draco says more seriously, then whacks him gently with the light zapper, as if a friendly smack will really drive the point home.
“It was Friday,” Harry insists. “I met you after the first block to walk to lunch and you were hiccoughing the entire walk down.”
Hermione and Draco had been paired as Auror partners directly out of training. Neither of them had been particularly happy about it at first, but Harry begrudgingly had to hand it to Robards—they were a perfect partnership. Harry could never be paired with either of them—they were both much too high energy. Hermione took extreme risks and would not listen to reason (Harry and Ron often reminisced about the time they tried to talk her out of making Polyjuice and she didn’t listen and ended up half-feline). And Draco was a ball of nervous energy, getting caught up on small details of cases that were completely irrelevant (most of the time; sometimes his obsessions solve cases) and refusing to do work as assigned. Together, they worked each other into frenzies, falling asleep at their desks and reading aloud from obscure Latin grimoires in the Ministry library.
"So what happened at work?" Harry asked, stretching his neck. "You seemed upset before, when you texted."
," I say, not caring that it's rude and insensitive and proves every bad thing Potter thinks of me. But who cares about being sensitive? There's no sense trying to spin my treason to get on Potter's good side. We're both as good as dead.
you. It's not up to you, Harry." Her eyes blaze. "I'm only seventeen. I need to send an owl to the Harpies to accept a spot on their reserve team. You're a mess. We cannot be parents."
Draco stared at him for a long moment. "Likewise. In movies where heroes save the world, it never involves this."
Harry's just getting into the rhythm of it, he thinks, when Malfoy moans "Stop!" like Harry's imagination imagines a porn star would. It's a mixed signal to say the least, so Harry pauses, but doesn't remove his mouth. "Stop!" Malfoy repeats, more in control of himself this time.
"Wait for it, wait for it!" Teddy said, jumping to his feet and closing his eyes—hands out expectantly.
"Draught of Pure Imagination has been used for many purposes since its invention in 1412," Penelope said. "It is one of the primary components of traditional wizarding treatment of depression. In recent years, evidence supports a more holistic treatment approach, whereas the Draught of Pure Imagination is more like treating a symptom without touching the underlying causes. It will not be part of your ongoing treatment plan, but an experiment."
"It's kinda the whole point of the war, isn't it?" Hermione reaches her arm around Harry, squeezing his shoulder and pulling him close. "The reason it happened is because we allowed ourselves to think that type of evil is Other, that it's impossible for normal people to fall prey to ideas like that. Because the truth is, it's not Other. Everyone's got a little of that in them, and ignoring that isn't the solution. I can't hate Malfoy."
Hermione winces. "I want to talk to you about inviting Ginny. It's okay, right? I mean, we've got to invite her. If you'd just tell us what you argued about, we could—"
Harry was still in bed. “Yes, there’s a special outfit you have to buy. It has a kilt and a little matching jumper that says ‘zoo visitor’.”
"You are," Draco said, reaching to pinch his nose, "without a doubt, one of the most infuriating people I've ever met." He sighed and returned his gaze to meet Harry's eyes. "Thank you, I suppose. I enjoyed kissing you, too. Was there anything else?"
Hermione leans forward and grasps his hand. "It's okay. Well, it's not. But you're certainly not responsible for her actions. Or Voldemort's." Hermione's eyes flit to Harry's. "I think we all just want to move on, yeah?"
It's like Harry's brain is short-circuiting—he can't connect any words or concepts into coherent thoughts. She did
"Okay," Harry says, wanting to jump into action but having no idea what to do. "So we, um—Muggles get these sticks you pee on, to see if they're...if that's true. Do wizards have a better solution?"
“Yes,” Draco agreed, falling adeptly into this step-parent role. “It seems as if you might need someone who will tease
Lee scoffed and sat in Draco's armchair, leaving the two of them to sit close to each other on the sofa. "Writing about you could never be a step down. Plus, with this gag order! What's the plan? How are we going to fuck Rump? The only thing Pav told me was that she wants people rooting for your relationship." He paused, his eyes flitting to Draco. "It's a bit…surprising, after all."
Harry took a deep breath and forced his feet to move farther into the room, taking the purple armchair next to Malfoy.
"Erm," Harry says, because once the awkward conversation is happening, you might as well see it through, "we never really talked about whether it was something we wanted to happen again."
"Fuck if I know, Malfoy." Potter sighs. "I can't even figure out what to do with myself, much less other people. You'll have to decide."
Harry laughed, then sobered. "I know the eventual election is the most important thing, but this law is harming people
"Are the British magical people working for the Triple M employees of the programme, or will they get pulled out of their jobs when we are no longer members?"
For some reason, Harry and Draco had agreed to babysit at 5am. Harry couldn't remember why—something about the boys having to work and needing to get some sleep before they could Apparate without the risk of Splinching—but here they were, sitting in Albus and Scorpius's flat at sunrise with Aster, while the boys got a few hours sleep in the bedroom.
seemed to be scared shitless and drunk as fuck, judging by the mottled red blotches all over Draco's face and the wide saucers his grey eyes had become.
“I don’t have plans, really, except trying to figure out how to avoid my parents’ attempts to save the family name through me.” Draco walked into the entrance hall, then continued, “Of course, I’d love to apply to a Potions apprenticeship. I might be able to find one to accept me if I went out of the country—France? Or anywhere, really. I could go to the US.” Malfoy started laughing. “I can imagine the look on my parents’ faces if I told them I was going to study in the US and it is a fabulous image.”
It's kind of true—if you'd asked Harry at the club what he was thinking, his answer would've been a shrug. But he wonders, now, if maybe on that night the parts of his brain he's not in excellent contact with had known more than his thinking brain. Maybe those synapses had seen a lonely, broken boy who needed a new way to belong and said,
“What about you, Potter?” Malfoy asked. “If you imagine your best future, what is it? A garden wedding to a ginger bride, a bunch of mini-Saviours? Or do you have a thing with Granger and the other Weasley now? Rumour has it you three always sleep together.”
Well, there was nothing for it. Harry stormed out of the cafe, past the mooing duck and the bickering boys and out onto the pavement. He looked left, right. No obnoxiously blond hair.
Wormtail's just lying there. It's creeping me out, especially since I keep forgetting about him and then remembering again. For a moment, I can't look away. "Do you think the rat will eat the corpse? Or do you think it has a sense that the man is part rat, and it would be against the ethical code of rats?"
too much. Is that so bad? I refuse to think that makes me a freak. I get so fucking tired of everyone looking at me like I'm so strange—like there's something wrong with me for caring. 'Oh silly Harry, coming in last place because he couldn't leave a little girl tied up underwater. Oh Harry, so naive!' Maybe everyone else should care
Harry smiled, shaking his head a bit, and finished dinner feeling more peaceful than he had in a long time.
"Oh, it was awful," Draco confirmed. Then he had a terrible thought. "At least Scorpius didn't tell my mother."
Harry laughed. "Wow, that's a terrifying thought. Well, James is doing it. It's the only part of this charade I'm looking forward to."
"Holy shit," Harry said, reading it through a second time. "Can we even speak publicly to educate? We have all these programs…" He trailed off.
"Of course I do," Draco snapped. "When it's convenient. With amenable co-workers, usually. I pretty much always get laid at the Magical Solicitors' Union annual conference."
Harry laughed, though he felt a bit sick. "Don't use other people's relationships as a measure of your own. It doesn't work that way, and even if it did, there's no way for you to see inside someone else's relationship to make the comparison, anyway."
But the crowd didn't laugh when Harry raised Draco's shoe. They quieted. Someone made an "awwww" sound. "Dad!" Scorpius said, all full of emotion, and Harry, head still swimming with booze, felt like he had no idea what was going on.
Harry sat, content to watch as families and young couples and a grandmother with a toddler walked by. His mind wandered to the pregnancy for which Albus and Scorpius were setting up adoption. The baby was due to be born in the Spring, and Harry was so hoping that it wouldn’t fall through. He knew it was a tremendous disappointment any time a lead fell through. And a magical pregnancy in which the witch wanted to carry to term and put the baby up for adoption was
Harry spluttered, turning to look at Malfoy, whose mouth had fallen open as he stared at Penelope. Harry noted with some satisfaction that his gaping mouth betrayed poor manners.
"Fat chance," Draco said, conjuring a chair and sitting. "But it's important to have it in writing, anyway." He leaned over Harry's draft and began to pore over it systematically. "We need to add a paragraph before you introduce this. Give me a quill."
"What about Thompson?" Dennis asked, managing to look past Luna's feet and towards Draco. "Isn't he a
"Well, once we grant an interview." Draco pinched his nose and turned to Harry. "Maybe we should've done Parvati's reality telly plan." He smiled at Harry, and Harry was taken aback by how surreal this all was, joking about this with Draco, thinking a small, self-deprecating Malfoy smile looked good.
"Right. Imagine this," she says, spinning towards him and putting one hand on her hip. "You're seventeen. You keep bouncing between complete numbness and uncontrollable crying over your dead brother. You haven't slept a full night in over a year. You find out you're pregnant."
"The kids are fine. Everyone's fine." Draco fiddled with the teacups. "Just—let me hide behind my British rituals." He prepared the tea, adding the milk and Harry's one scoop of sugar, the clinking of the spoon on the china loud in the quiet kitchen. He walked to the table and placed the cup in front of Harry.
Harry had always been like this—he had these times of certainty. In Quidditch, in the war, in his love for his kids, in the way he threw himself into political campaigns. In the look in his eye when he revealed he wasn't dead and faced Voldemort.
"But the kid wants their parent to think they're asleep, right? So they stuff some pillows under their duvet and put a wig on a ball or something, for a head, and then they hop out the window. When the parent first peeks in, they don't realise their kid is gone."
This time, Harry burst out laughing—a loud honk of a laugh. "What age are we supposed to be in this scenario, then, fifteen?!"
Harry made eye contact with Draco, who was laughing, a look of disbelief on his face, his hair rumpled. He raised his eyebrow at Harry.
Harry dissolved into laughter, doubling over and clutching at his stomach. “I’m sorry—you just—that mean face coupled with the fucking butterfly—”
I whack him in the arm, trying not to overthink how familiar I'm being with him. "Shut up. It's hideous! It's a monstrosity!"
Harry smiled. "Excellent, because I don't fancy you charming my clothes." He walked to the sofa and flopped onto it. "Ugh. Work is unbearable with everyone talking about Rump."
“We didn’t imagine the present,” Malfoy said after awhile. “We imagined the past, we imagined the future.”
Astoria sat in one of the chairs and pulled off her high heels. "A poor choice for the day this has turned out to be," she said, pointing her wand at the shoe and Transfiguring it into a flat.
Harry stood, gaping, in the office, wondering vaguely what had just happened. A kiss?! Completely out of the blue? With no one around to see? Granted, it wasn't a very sensual kiss. But still, a kiss nonetheless. It wasn't like Draco went around kissing people like that. Harry would know.
Hermione and Draco. Watching MTV. Harry wrinkles his nose in confusion, setting the bags on the kitchen counter. "Pardon?"
Draco looked up. He'd been avoiding eye contact with their interrogators, but now his eyes found Hermione's, then Scorpius's. "You remember what it was like. You remember how we felt. The hopelessness, the disbelief. And I just—when the world is that shitty and feels that helpless, you want to do whatever you can to fix it. And maybe that's arrogant, or selfish even, but it's also the source of good change and improvement and social action!" He stopped, shook his head. "Sorry. I'm not trying to sound like a politician right now, but sometimes it just comes out. Anyway. So I talked to Hermione about what to do next. What could LabMag do? How could we possibly deal with this, this fascist
"You're welcome. I plan to spend as much as possible on Puddlemere United throw blankets and Gryffindor Alumni furnishings."
Harry throws his hand up as if in exasperation, but he's actually touched. And he knows that Draco and Hermione know he's touched, too, though they won't call him on it.
"Mmmm." Wilhelm spun around on the little circular piece of ground to which he was affixed. "And I made sure not to mention to whom in the Ministry my loyalties belong."
be used on anyone. But less than 2% of cis wizards have reported being sexually assaulted, compared to over 20% of cis witches and 47—47%!—of trans witches and non-binary wix. So this is an issue where violence is being perpetrated
"Hold your unicorns, Aster," Draco said, tightening his grip to prevent her escape. She was going to flip herself over backward if she wasn't careful.
The coffee was cold and bitter; he couldn't figure out why he was still drinking it. Glancing around, he subtly Vanished the cup, sunk into a bench, and buried his head in his hands.
"Tom Riddle shouldn't get a vote," Draco said with sudden conviction, then looked down at his omelette. "Fuck democracy. And maybe that means I shouldn't either, who knows. But putting our country to a vote? By fascists? With them spewing hateful nonsense? I just—it's discouraging to anyone, I'm sure, but for me it's also—" He trailed off.
sounds different. Higher and less scratchy. “It’s a potion that changes according to your lover. I had to put one of your hairs in it, luckily you shed like a kneazle and I found like ten on my coat.”
"I'm not saying I get my jollies from corpses!" I clarify. "Quite the contrary, as a point of fact. I'm merely saying I got a jolly from joking about it."
His knees were just knobby. Nothing special. Harry knew that—he wasn’t delusional. He didn't have what people would call "good legs." Except they did, because of who he was.
"Okay, Draco, calm down, this is just.. just because you have sensitive ears, yes. Harry Potter did not, and I repeat, did not make you feel tingly." whispered the blonde to himself quietly, arriving in his room.
The boy with glasses ruffled his hair, faintly, his eyes scanning the dinning hall with pent up excitement. His whole break was spent thinking about what will happen once they were all back to Hogwarts. Everything was put together, and even though they weren't supposed to come back, Mcgonagall insisted they would spend another year in the walls of the wizarding school, just to make sure that everything was alright. He saw the way Draco changed. He thought that he looked good for a betrayer.
The boy with glasses rolled his eyes, sitting next to Fred and George, who were exchanging knowing looks, but not saying anything.
The platinum haired boy scoffed, his eyes piercing through Harry's soul. Even though he liked the fellow, he couldn't just get over everything.
The next day, Harry arrived at the dining hall later than usual, a distraught Ron following behind his steps, gesturing with his hands like a mad man.
"This is the thing: you hid that person like your life depended on it, so they were more than a nobody! I'm not a twat!" continued the red haired boy, slapping his hands onto the table next to Hermione, who just sighed.
As the platinum haired male laced his shoes, he felt a sudden grip on his left shoulder. He rose to his feet, alarmed, looking left and right panicked, until he realized it was just Blaise greeting him. After the war, everything changed. Everyone changed; including Draco. Nobody talked about it, though, because they no longer cared for him. It wasn't like they cared for him in the first place anyway, they were just.. afraid. Draco was now a loner, his usual route being hanging out with Blaise and Pansy, going some place where nobody would look for him, go to his lessons, eat and sleep.
Both of the boys looked at each other for a few seconds, not knowing what to say or what should happen.
Draco just shook his head in disagreement, muttering something about 'bleeding Potter, always causing trouble', getting back to his potion. After a few minutes, he noticed the room was getting hotter by the minute, all the cauldrons being used and the potions nearly done. He skimmed his eyes across the room, seeing Harry take off his robe and roll up his sleeves, puffing out, clearly feeling the hotness of the room too. But oh, was that a bad move. The platinum blonde bloke stared, a rosy brush creeping up onto his cheeks, causing him to clear his throat quite loudly, earning him a few confused stares. And also Potter's attention. They seemed to just stare at each other for a while, Draco's eyes shifting up and down constantly at the other's arms, the brown haired boy noticing his slippery attitude, glancing down at.. his hands? Harry looked curiously at his hands, Draco cursing himself for getting caught, and turned his gaze away.
"Blaise, I didn't know you swing that way!" said Pansy in a dramatic tone, throwing herself on the bed, making sure to smack Draco's back in an amiable way.
"Let's make one then! Move, move!" yelled Ron, pushing everyone out of the room, cursing himself for replaying the scene he just witnessed in his head.
"Well, why are we here, Potter? Are you trying to hex me this time or are you sticking to the "Oh, let's glue Draco Malfoy to the wall and make him incredibly uncomfortable!"? So? What's it going to be, Potter?" said the slytherin, coming closer and closer to the other male, noticing how his eyes were constantly going up and down, seemingly analyzing the boy.
With accelerated footsteps and heavy breaths, the blonde male entered the classroom, an apologetic expression drawn on his face. Soon, that expression changed into confusion as he sniffed the area, realizing it smelt quite.. odd. "Why does the room smell like Potter? Are we brewing a potion to make us smell like total git?" asked Draco in a mocking tone, laughing loudly.
"Excuse us, Professor." replied almost instantly Pansy, batting her eyelashes innocently, the man turning around still skeptical about them.
"You don't have to be scared, Potter, we're all grown now, aren't we?" whispered Draco, as if he feared being heard. "Why are you frozen, golden boy?"
Oh, was it a ravishing sight seeing Draco Malfoy squirm in his place, clearly bashful of the stunt he just pulled. A part of Harry wanted to go and embrace him tightly, a part wanted to laugh in his face and another part.. Well, it's better left undiscovered.. for now. Malfoy's plan that consisted of making Harry's time at Hogwarts harder than it should be was completely botched because of his daftness.
The boys knew that they should probably sneak themselves out of the Gryffindor common room, but they couldn't help stealing a few kisses from each other, while leaving dark marks on their bodies, even though Draco was still adamant about not tainting his pale, clean skin with bruises. He liked them even though he never showed it.
Technically, yes. Draco's stomach has been going up and down with how many emotions he has been feeling in the past 5 minutes, but he couldn't just give himself away, oh, Merlin, no. If he did.. No, he shouldn't.
When they arrived in the dining hall, where the opening was being held, Draco went straight to his usual place at the Slytherin table, sitting right next to Pansy who smiled warmly. This action made Draco smile back, and his day a little brighter.
Draco shook his head, freeing himself from his grasp, forcing a stumbling gryffindor to fall onto his bed. The blonde male crawled on top of the other, smirking devilishly, straddling his lap.
As he was spacing out, he realised his gaze stopped right onto Draco Malfoy, the latter observing this fact quite late, because Harry rapidly averted his gaze towards his own hands, placed in his lap like they were made of glass. Draco felt as if someone was watching him, the feeling coming from Harry's area, but he just brushed it off seeing as his eyes were glued to his lap.
While Draco was bolting, his head was filled with a million questions who were probably never going to get an answer, especially a logical and very straight explanation for their reactions. The Slytherin knew that he had sensitive ears, it was no surprise to him, but it was a bombshell when he saw Harry's ethereal face come closer to him, his voice low and oh.. Shit, he was getting hard, that's no good.
acquaintances! I regret everything that I've did to you.. But you also have been tormenting me since the first day!"
Draco shifted in his seat uncomfortably, turning to see Harry staring at him in a way he couldn't decipher. Yet. He was analyzing his lips, stirred, and then his neck, and then his gaze stopped onto his eyes who seemed to have never left the reason of his rosy blush that was painting his cheeks.
They never looked at each other again. In that class, at least; Draco Malfoy wasn't going to expect this.
Harry just nodded, not interested in the new students at all. Really. He felt as if he didn't belong there. Well, he fought in a war and all and he has nowhere to go except the Weasleys' house, but he felt as if he was intruding. Hogwarts was not home. So what was he supposed to do? The brown haired boy sighed loudly, gathering the attention of his two friends, and Neville who just arrived, with worried looks in their eyes.
Instantly, with shaky breaths, the blonde male pushed the other off him, Harry stumbling back, completely disoriented by everything that just happened. "Don't you ever come near me again, Potter!" yelled Draco, tripping over literal air, dashing towards the Slytherin common room, leaving Harry to process the entirety of the passed moment.
Draco lunged himself at Harry, fighting him, finding this whole situation funny and exciting. Because of their steamy make out session, they didn't notice their pants getting tighter by each second that was passing. While they were clashing their lips and teeth into each other mercilessly, their groins were rubbing roughly, trying to create some kind of friction, to deepen the pleasure they were already feeling. The thing is, doing something like this with your supposed to be enemy was intoxicating, especially the consequences that were going to slither their way into their lives with no sign.
Harry turned around confused at the boy, raising a brow at him. Draco waved him off, motioning for him to continue walking.
Harry puffed out, a mocking smile sneaking onto his lips. He was looking at him amused, but also perplexed of the situation at hand. The Gryffindor was moving closer to Draco's face, who's soul has just left his body, and brought his lips close to his ear and whispered:
His grey orbs eyed the boy who seemed to always occupy his head, seeing him look eerie perturbed. Harry has been peering over his shoulder ever since Draco took a seat at his usual place, shockingly concerned and anxious about the other's arrival. The Slytherin has been wishing for Potter to look at him like that. He wanted him to worry about him, to just inhabit his skull, almost hauntingly. Is this why Draco chose not to heal himself? He was seeking his attention, in any way that he can, it was pitiful, really.
The boy with glasses blinked, confused as to what just happened, and couldn't help but laugh at the way Malfoy ran away from him. He felt a bit bad for laughing at his actions, but he couldn't help it. Oh, was this year going to be.. Something else.
"Look, Ron, if it was someone important I definitely would've told you. That person was just a.. nobody." said Harry, running a hand through his hair, exasperated.
In the next second, Harry took Draco's wrists into his hands, flipping the both of them, panting heavily. Malfoy moaned at the sudden movement, throwing daggers at Potter.
So many inquiries in his head were popping from every corner of his mind, hitting him like the Hogwarts Express, but he wholly disregarded them all, his hands flying towards the hem of Harry's shirt.
"Bloody hell.." whispered under his breath the red haired boy, stumbling on literal nothing, trying to get away from the scene in front of his eyes as fast as possible. "Maybe another time. G'day everybody, let's watch the Quidditch match  for today-"
"O-Of course I was picking on you! I knew it was Amortentia, obviously, I'm not a dimwitted bloke, unlike you who clearly didn't get the joke." stuttered the blondie, trying not to look into his eyes, afraid of his attitude shattering, it was already spilling all on the floor, along with Draco's facade.
The other boy nodded, not wanting to question him any longer and watched as Harry made his way towards the exit of the common room.
"It for sure stings like a bitch.." muttered the blonde, sighing quite loudly, the professor raising a brow at him, only to continue his lesson, unmoved by his little "show".
Hermione only sighed, bringing a hand to her forehead, watching Ron freak out over the fact that their best friend somehow was.. attracted? No, better said charmed by their enemy.
And so he told them. Everything. He saw the way their expressions kept on changing, exasperated sighs leaving their lips. "You are such a dimwit, 'Ray." said Blaise, a pristine smile laying on his face.
They were literally both fighting each other, but they used the pent up anger and frustration they both held in for so long to please themselves. Harry was biting at his lips, quite ferociously, while his hands were roaming Draco's body however he wanted. His hands made their way over to his neck, letting them rest for a while, his attention on the slytherin's whimpering mouth. Draco felt a wave of boldness wash over him and took Harry's hand, placing it onto his neck.
Harry didn't say anything for a few moments, gathering his thoughts, trying to form a sentence. It was to no avail. He had nothing to say. He was lost at sea.
It's not the first time Draco thought that Harry should just wrap his hands around his neck, and certainly not the last.
Harry just dissmissed her with a wave of hand, signaling that it didn't matter, leaving Ron to caress Hermione's thigh, compassionately. He whispered a 'let him be' and she nodded understandingly, continuing to watch the ceremony.
"Bloody hell, what's wrong with you today Harry?" murmurs the boy, looking worriedly, but also confused as the culprit who disturbed the class.
Draco got up from his bed, Harry being the one to back away now, the flowers held tightly in his hand like his life depended on them. "I had to make sure my parents weren't going to die! I had to always be careful, of every step and every breath I took! I was forced to do everything, you out of all people should know that!"
Draco was bewildered and he coughed awkwardly, while regaining his posture, trying to keep a superior aura around him, even though it was hard when Harry was standing in his doorway with flowers. The slytherin tried to fix his hair and attire, sighing in advance, knowing damn well he couldn't just try to look good in front of Potter.
Potter didn't hesitate one bit in fulfilling Malfoy's request, his hands tightening slowly around his neck. Draco's grip on Harry's tie loosened and he let a small mewl get past his rosy lips, his eyes shut tight. This was all new for the boys. For the both of them it was like venturing blindly into a stormy sea, while galloping carelessly with their feet into the ashy sand. But it didn't matter that they were getting dirty and risking everything they got, all that it mattered was who they were getting dirty with.
"You're not helping, Harry! Dear Merlin, this wasn't supposed to happen! I think I added too much liquid.." exclaimed Neville, pacing around the room breathlessly.
"He did what? What other things are you not telling us, Harry?" asked Ron, obviously resentful towards his best mate.
Hermione slapped the book in her hands over the table, dragging Ron with her, angry muttering something about 'being the only one who has brains, for Merlin's sake'.
The two boys were staring daggers at each other, too caught up in the argument to notice anything beside them. In the corner of Harry's eye, he somehow managed to perceive the worried look Draco was giving him. He glanced at him, as if in a daze, and gave a gawky smile, trying to reassure him that he got everything under control. In fact, he did not have everything under control, but it felt good pretending he had everything under control.
Blaise entered the room like a storm, his eyes darting from corner to corner, trying to find Draco, only to find him sprawled onto his bed. The brunette hissed at the sight in front of him, earning him a pillow in the face, his lips letting a small 'ow' get past them.
Harry nodded, watching Ron wrap his arm around Hermione, the both of them leaving. Hermione looked back, a little dejected, waved and then turned around to kiss the ginger's cheek. The boy let out a breath he didn't know he was holding and he just stared at the food in front of him, not knowing what to do. He should just go back to ignoring Malfoy, maybe the both of them will never talk again and he would just focus on being an Auror and hang out with Hermione and Ron.. He was still skeptical about Draco's intentions, even after he basically went to his dorm and tried to form a friendship with him. It must be his younger self not being used to him talking and thinking about Malfoy in such a way. It was tiring him this situation, so he decided to just ignore the male after all.
Neville started questioning his Herbiology knowledge every second that was passing, making him groan in annoyance.
Draco could only laugh at himself bitterly, his fingers making their way to his head, pulling at his hair severely. In the cold, dim-lit room, the only sound heard was the boy sobbing loudly, his shoulders shaking sharply. He felt hopeless because of a dumb, young admiration he used to hold for the golden boy when he first met him. In the first year, he watched him secretly, desperately hoping he would come to him and suggest to be his friend. In second year, his admiration turned into pure hatred for the boy who lived. Draco felt as if he could vanish castles in his way whenever he heard his voice and saw his face. In the third year? He started questioning his hatred, his stomach making flips and turns whenever Potter was around. The rest of his years were spent fantasizing with an aching, pounding heart. It was extremely hard for the boy to just get a rest from his anguished thoughts, especially when his parents proudly announced to him that he would have to become a Death Eater. He no longer could feel the surging happiness other people felt whenever they got a good grade. He no longer felt close to his parents. The pain he felt was suffocating him second by second, and his time was running out.
"What was Harry bleeding Potter doing in your room, Draco?" asked Pansy, Blaise being to shut off to ask any questions.
"Just wanted to check how the school looks, that's all." replied the latter, his attention being called towards the professors.
"I'm not with Ginny anymore. We just didn't work out.. But I will take some.." said Harry, an idea popping into his head.
A lie. He never told them how he wanted to peace it out with the said boy, because he knew how they would react. Why did he even try in the first place? He should just.. Oh, he's looking his way! The boy with the glasses observed Malfoy's body language (entirely for research reasons, of course), expectantly, Draco greeting him with a head bounce. Harry smiled, waving friendly.
"Oh, put a sock in it, Malfoy." interrupted Harry, his voice clearly irritated. "What is this? Huh? First you cry on the first day, you scream at me in your common room when I clearly only want to befriend you, the next day you wave at me friendly, which is something you just don't do, and now you smell me in the Amortentia? Are you trying to pick on me again?"
They both waited in anticipation for something to happen, and just when Neville started thinking that it would blow up again, the plant started growing into a beautiful, pink, tree with flowers. The tree wasn't that big, it was like a baby tree, but it held a ton of pretty blossoms.
hello, hello, as you can see, i'm not dead!! applause!! ok, but fr, i had a tough week and all i wanted was to curl up and die in a ditch sooo, yeah
When they got to Harry's dorm, he opened the door, letting Draco decide if he wanted to enter or back away and never talk to him again. He stepped in. Harry breathed out, relieved. The chosen boy entered after him, closing the door behind him, Draco eyeing everything in the room attentive. After a while, he turned around, waving his hands around.
"Look.. I don't care if you suddenly realized that you like blokes, let's get this straight, alright, mate?" started the boy, clasping his hands together. "But.." continued, his face changing 5 expressions in a blink of a second, "Why him, Harry? He despises people like me and Hermione."
Silence. This is al that was heard, until Ron literally fainted in Hermione's lap, the girl sighing exasperated. "This.. This is why I didn't tell him in the first place!"
In the next moment, Harry was sprinting towards Draco, making him step back a bit, only to get his arm taken in between his fingers firmly, his back pressed on the pillar of Harry's bed. The blonde's head hit the pillar, quite roughly, making him wince in pain.
Potter was nowhere near the way he was at the start of the day. He was hanging out with Neville, who was trying new things for his Herbiology class, but he seemed to fail everytime he tried a new process, and Harry wasn't going to help him, as he was sprawled out on a chair, in the Gryffindor common room, laughing his arse off.
"You're such a fucking annoyance sometimes, with your oblivious arse." said Blaise, knocking some food in front of the blonde male, who seemed to have forgotten all about eating since the subject of their conversation was Potter.
i dont know if i should write more mature things or just leave them out? even though i want to idk i think im tired from all the writing hahaha
"What are you standing there for? Come on now, go to your partner." said the professor, interrupting the boys' wild thoughts, making both of them jump slightly.
"Uh, I got these flowers from Neville's newest 'experiment', and I thought that you would like them since.. You know.."
Oh, was Malfoy screwed. He couldn't believe the fact that he let himself get caught crying, by Harry Potter. Harry bleeding Potter. It wasn't his brightest moment, that's true, but he couldn't help but day dream about Potter, even after the incident.
"You came right on time, Headmistress Mcgonagall is about to place the new students in their houses!" exclaimed Hermione, turning her head from the Gryffindor table.
The blondie groaned, throwing himself on his bed, in the Slytherin common room. He shared the room with Blaise, somehow, even though his father was not around anymore to arrange where he would stay.
"Why is he dangerous? Voldemort is dead and, besides, he cried in front of me, twice already!" shouted the boy, his mouth closing suddenly, realizing what mess he just got himself into.
"Pansy, I swear to Merlin that if you say another word about Potter I will shove your head in the toilet, in the bathroom where Moaning Myrtle is at." sneered the male, brewing the potion, not being in the mood of Pansy's teasing.
"A week? It feels like a century.." said the blonde boy, drifting off to whatever lovey-dovey daydream he was displaying in his head, while laying on her lap.
"I already know that, he found me crying." said Draco, ashamed, while looking at his pillow that was grasped tightly by his hands. "I chickened and ran away." continued the male, a big sigh leaving his lips.
"Prat." huffed out Draco, bringing his hands to his chest in a defensive way, something he did whenever he felt especially ashamed in that specific moment.
Harry stepped back, earning a low whine from the boy. "What's the magical word?" asked the brown haired boy, smirking.
Draco was on the verge of tears, again, and Harry noticed that. All he could do was stare in shock. Draco looked so.. Helpless. It's not the first time he's seen him like that, no, he looked like this when he used the curse on him, in the bathroom.
Draco stood proudly in his door, eyeing him up and down, after a while he sighed and let Harry come into his room, feeling a bit ashamed after the incident that happened today.. And oh sweet Merlin, Harry Potter stepped into his room!
At that point, the boy who lived got up from his seat, facing the red head eye to eye, almost angrily, but you could see that he did not want to fight with his friend. He never intended to. He wasn't even sure for the things he was feeling for Merlin's sake!
Oh, how he wished he could just cup those pretty little cheeks of his and kiss his lips, and oh- Harry appeared to wait for a response from Draco, who was lost in his fantasies like a sailor in the night. Draco licked his lips slowly, trying to think of a reaction, of something, but it was hard to have anything in your head other than Potter's mesmerizing array. So he just cocked his head up, in a way to greet him, earning him a gleaming grin from ear to ear, Harry waving with his.. good looking hands.
"It will be easier for Malfoy," Draco looked up at Potter, surprised. "I mean, if he'll need something or if his Mark will be burning and hurting again. So Kreacher will be here to take care of him, and you or I shouldn't be rushing here immediately. And I think I couldn't come very often. And so are you, with Death Eaters around, I mean."
"Lay still," Potter told him. He changed the towel again and was trying to cast a Cooling charm on Draco's forearm, but it wasn't actually working, though Draco almost didn't feel the pain.
Draco was barely stopping himself from jumping in excitement and Harry laughed, pulling Draco closer by the waist.
"There'll be Death Eaters tonight out there," Potter's voice interrupted Draco's thoughts. "You heard Snape, didn't you? They won't be able to see the house, but be careful anyway."
Draco glanced behind his shoulder, where Harry was lying sprawled on the bed, sleeping and snoring slightly.
Finally, Harry kissed him, hard and demanding, and it was so perfect, Draco was on the edge again. The feeling of complete surrender and the knowledge that he was absolutely at Harry's mercy were slowly driving him mad with need, desire and arousal.
Draco looked at her. He saw his own wand clutched in her other hand. Granger was covered in blood too, she had a few scratches on her face and a long deep wound was seen on her arm through the torn sleeve of her jacket.
"Do you need help?" Draco realized that Weasley and even Granger spoke at the same time with him and they all stared at each other.
"Well, she said something happened with her dad," Harry said quietly and took one of Draco's hands in his, soothing him. "And she needed your other friend to drive her to her parents' home," he added and tugged at Draco's hand, urging him to sit back down next to him.
He didn't want to sit on the table next to them, so he leaned against the line of kitchen cabinets and sipped his tea quietly.
They stayed like this for a while, just hugging each other close. Draco's hands were around Harry's neck, his head resting on Harry's shoulder, and Harry's hands were around Draco, holding him gently but firmly.
"Maybe it'd be nice if there weren’t such a lot of stupid pebbles under my feet and if it wasn't bloody six in the morning."
"She is not my girl, her name is Hermione, and you can call her that or rather Miss Granger," Potter said angrily while Severus was trying to unbutton his shirt.
Draco had tears in his eyes too and he couldn't look away from the side of Harry's face. Did he even realize what his words mean to Draco? He wished Harry told them to him directly and without witnesses.
Draco also couldn't understand in what kind of relationship Severus and Potter were, and when and how they started to cooperate with each other.
He wasn't sure he could brew an essence of dittany himself, so he decided to ask Severus for it, trying not to think about why Potter needed it so much. And he wrote an answer.
"Of course, Harry," he sat on the bed and took Harry's hand in his then turned to Granger frowning nervously: "How long has it been since he was bitten?"
Draco blushed furiously and pressed his face to Harry's shoulder in embarrassment and tried not to think about the fact that Harry had a
"Good. Well... I'll be going now," Potter glanced at Draco, stood up and started walking out of the room.
"Am I sounding creepy when I call you 'Ron'?" Harry answered him in annoyed voice. "If you prefer 'Weasley', all you need is just to say that." That made Draco smirk.
He quickly brushed Draco's hair from his face, then started stroking himself again. Slowly at the beginning, watching Draco's face and caressing it gently with his fingers. But it didn't last, he was panting too soon and stroking himself faster and faster.
But a look of joy and wonder on Potter's face and the way he was staring at Draco, or rather at Draco's lips, was definitely worth it.
To Draco's relief, his mother didn't show any surprise and was actually more concerned about Harry's age than his gender.
," Draco whimpered Harry's name because it was all he could manage to say when Harry's mouth and Harry's hands were on him.
"What were you talking about earlier, Draco?" Severus asked when they were both sitting at the table, mugs of steaming tea in front of them. "The thief of the Horcrux? What in the name of Merlin is going on?"
"I just kinda find myself in his mind or something like that and can see with his eyes. And I can feel his emotions when they're strong enough. It's like– it's like I am him or he is me, I don't know... It's very creepy and not so pleasant, but it helps sometimes."
"And what are we waiting for? I hope it's not Granger and Weasley hiding behind those bushes," Draco said quietly while wondering would it be too obvious if he would press himself into Potter’s side a little more.
"It’s not simple, baby," Harry cupped Draco's cheek and stroked it gently with his thumb. "And though Snape is absolutely sure, I'm not really that certain this shit is actually over," he sighed heavily and rested his forehead against Draco's, closing his eyes. "I'm still not free from him, I still can get into his sick head if I want to and I still can feel his fucking emotions. And I hate it, I hate it so fucking much, and I can't do a single thing about it."
"Did you like it this way more than usual?" Harry asked him quietly, when some time later they were laying on the bed spent and boneless, with their arms around each other.
"Why are you doing it, Potter?" Draco asked him watching his concentrated face, but Potter didn't answer. "Aren't Granger and Weasley waiting for you?"
"Bathroom!" Draco cried out a little more loudly than it was actually necessary and went in to take all his hair potions and French soaps.
"I made enough for them too," Potter answered. "And I took only one plate with me, so they think I'm having breakfast alone somewhere in the woods. Actually they don't ask a lot of questions, I suppose they think I need time and space for myself."
"Potter, before you decide to tell anything to Draco, I need to talk to you alone," Severus said frowning. "Are you saying that you are still able to see– to see into his mind?"
"To have a breakfast with me sometimes, I mean," Potter suddenly looked shy. "I mean somewhere in the forest or where we will be camping in the future. You were right, you really need fresh air, you look paler than usual. And– and I really like to spend time with you... And I promise to cast all the charms for you to–"
"You're absolutely incredible," Harry whispered in Draco's ear and Draco was barely able to suppress a whimper. "Shut the fuck up, Ron," Harry said cheerfully to stupidly gaping Weasley, and took Draco's hand leading him down the stairs and into the kitchen.
Draco was still in his thoughts with Potter and his big hand on Draco's waist when he and Kreacher landed in his bedroom in Grimmauld Place, so he didn't notice his Godfather sitting in the armchair by the window until he started speaking.
"Seriously?" Harry pulled away again to stare at him with clear surprise in his beautiful green eyes. "Seriously? I– But you're so fucking gorgeous, Draco! You– you're– Really?"
"Are you really going to let these pathetic nitwits turn your nice pub into ruins?" Blaise asked, raising his eyebrow at the slightly confused expression on Harry’s face.
"I like it that you liked it," he said smiling. "I wanted to make something for you for a while. I mean, I baked a little cake for Hermione's birthday a couple of weeks ago, and I thought I could bake something for you too. And when I found this place yesterday morning, I immediately wanted to show you. But then I thought– this might be more– Er, you know, with a pudding– I mean, it might be more than fine, you know."
"What are you doing tomorrow?" Harry asked him suddenly after some minutes of comfortable silence. "Or the day after tomorrow?"
When they returned to the kitchen, Granger and Weasley were still there. Granger was deep into the book she was reading and Weasley merely glanced at them never stopping chewing his sandwich.
"It's half past six already," Harry murmured quietly in Draco's hair. "I think I should cook something for us to eat for dinner, I'm not sure Kreacher will be back today."
"This elf is spoiling you almost as bad as your mother," Severus told him standing near the table across from him and eyeing his berries suspiciously.
He took a deep breath, inhaling Harry's strong scent, and pressed his face to the material of Harry's t-shirt. Even if it was just for now, it was absolutely perfect.
"Fucking hell, Draco," Harry's hand squeezed Draco's ass so hard it hurt, but then it moved to his hipbone. "You're so fucking hot, baby," Harry's breath on Draco's lips was fucking hot too and his voice was so rough and sexy.
He looked up at him when Harry growled again, and felt the first spray of hot come hitting his cheek. He opened his mouth and the next spray hit him across his lower lip and his chin. He licked it, looking right into Harry's beautiful eyes, then looked down at Harry's still pulsing cock and took the head in his mouth, sucking on it lightly.
He was nodding so enthusiastically, he didn't even notice when Harry had time to reach for lube again, he only gasped loudly in surprise when Harry slipped his two lubed fingers in Draco's still loose hole.
"No moving," Harry said in a firm voice and Draco stilled. "Good boy," Harry murmured into Draco's ear, and Draco nearly lost it, but he knew that Harry wouldn't like it if he'd come without his permission.
It was just a portrait on the wall; a portrait of a tall and dark haired woman who Draco mentally associated with some weird combination of Minerva McGonagall and Bellatrix Lestrange.
"It is not what I as–" Severus stopped talking and stared at him with comically wide eyes. Draco might laugh if he wasn't already so nervous. "What are you wearing?" Severus asked him out of nowhere.
"What is this? Harry, what are you talking about?" if they thought Draco was going to just stay away and watch from the distance beside confused Weasley and Granger, they were very wrong.
