"I mean it Draco, I'm sorry for not accepting your friendship all those years ago. It is one of the biggest regrets I have in my life... You make me feel alive again when I thought it better to be dead...when I thought Sirius was dead, I wanted to die but then you came in and showed me that it was okay to be alive... I really am glad I have you in my life!"
Harry didn't want to leave Draco but he knew Hermione was right; a year ago Dumbledore would have given him all the time off he wanted but now? Dumbledore would probably have him thrown out of the school.
"Maybe sometime you could join us by the lake, we tend to get a lot of work done and you can see for yourself?"
The elder rolled his eyes. "I couldn’t care less about your so called friends, if they were to stop fighting against my reign there would be no need to kill them."
Harry donned the cloak and began the trek down to the dungeons, he had managed to catch up to Draco and his friends. Harry stayed quiet listening to what they were saying, it seems that they were talking about him, Harry's curiosity got the best of him as he got a bit closer catching them mid conversation.
Harry shook his head "Since this whole fighting thing happened they can't be in the same room as each other for more than five minutes, so people are going to lose their money... And what the hell does nobody have a life, why does everyone have to be so interested in mine?"
The man laughed at Harry but didn't say anything. “Who are you?" Harry blurted out uncaring if he came across rude, it annoyed him that he couldn't remember where he had met this man before.
“We had Tom giving us daily reports about your downward spiral and I must say we are very disappointed that you dint come to us for help.” Remus added.
"A poison created by mixing several other poisons together, cannot simply be created by finding the antidotes to each separate poison in the blended whole and mixing them together. Instead, you must find that single ingredient which, when added to the blended antidotes, transforms them near-alchemically into a combined whole which will counteract the entire blended poison." Tom recited, reminding Harry a little of Hermione.
Voldemort nodded. "They are under orders not to harm you anymore, while I can not vouch that all of them will listen to this demand, any who stray will be punished."
Apparently he was right  when he had tried to focus on the link between him and Voldemort but just thinking about the link and actually touching the link were different, he had to will the Dark Lord to enter the connection. He had to want their minds to merge, to let the connection open. Harry had wanted to snark at the Professor that this was easier said than done, but he had kept his mouth shut and listened to his greasy haired elder.
Harry pretended to think about it. “I guess you could say it started from when my parents died and I was placed in the care of my muggle Aunt and Uncle, these people hated magic and anything and everything to do with magic, including me, which of course was going against my parents will.
“Hm, you’re so responsive.” Tom purred. His voice husky and his eyes alive with desire. He pulled off Harry’s last bit of clothing. Harry felt rather exposed being the only one naked and tried to hide himself.
"Oh come on Harry they both really fancy you, there are bets out there that their feeling as so strong that they would put aside everything for you."
He sat there reading for hours, he could see other blokes being uncomfortable but he had told Draco that he was gay weeks ago, when he told him he was scared he was going to lose his new friend but Draco had laughed and said he could tell because he was too. This had made Harry nervous was he really that obvious that he was gay. Tom and Draco had known come to think of it when he outed himself to Hermione she had said the same thing. He told Draco that he had told the dark lord he wasn't gay and Draco laughed “I bet he saw right through you".
At first Harry thought Draco was been a prat by asking the question but the look on his face showed he really want to know the answer. “Is treacle tart is your favourite dessert?" Draco nodded “How about this ill cook you dinner and treacle tart and you can answer that question."
"Mr Potter come up to the front." Snape motioned without any room to argue. Harry followed the order; he stood next to the professor and looked at him questionably. "You were the first to act but were the one paying the least attention. Why?"
Everyone had stared at Tom when he made his presence clear, he looked like the Tom Riddle from the diary. Harry couldn’t help but think that this couldn’t possibly work, Both Dumbledore and Hagrid knew what Tom looked like back in the day.
Draco’s mouth soon surrounding Harry as he began to suck. Harry’s hands moved down to tangle in the blonde’s hair as he moaned loudly.
Voldemort continued to glare at the teen. "Call me Tommy again, and horcrux or no I will destroy you, in the most painful way possible."
Harry shrugged "Not particularly, I just want this torment over with so either kill me or let me go to bed."
The confused look never left Harry’s face so Draco explained. “Tom has always had a gift with playing with the mind. While I was recovering, Tom visited my mind every day. He would give me updates on what was going on and how everyone was doing and just keep me company, hell he even told me the stuff I was I missing in classes..”
Harry leaned his forehead onto Draco’s; Draco was still cupping Harry's cheek. “I don't know how I ever made it without you, you seem to always make me sense when I have these moments."
Harry walked into Tom's study, he didn't bother to knock, luckily the man was on his own or else Harry would have been punished for since an intrusion, just so they wouldn’t get any ideas.
Harry, Tom and Draco all walked to breakfast separately, despite the want to be as close as possible. They did however sit
Tom then left Harry to his own crazy thoughts. Harry completely missed it when Tom whispered "Help me win".
Dumbledore nodded. "You are right Harry, forgive me I just worry about your safety, I want whats best for you."
Tom just shook his head "No it's just it's been a rather good day and I don't want your mood to ruin it."
Voldemort and studied the boy in front of him, he could tell the boy was telling the truth and was serious about his decision. He let out a wicked grin, and held out his hand to Harry. "Welcome to the right side of the war Potter."
Draco began to slowly open his eyes with a groan, Harry had stopped mid-sentence to look at the blond with shock. When it was clear the other was waking up, Harry’s face had lit up.
Harry yawned so Hermione left him to sleep, with strict orders not to leave the bed before kissing him on the forehead and promising to visit him tomorrow. Harry let his head rest on the pillow and slowly drift to sleep.
Remus smiled "Trust me when I say, your heart and soul know who you belong to the minute you are born."
Harry was soon wandering around Hogsmeade with Tom and Draco by his side, they had nagged him for a while, both wanting to know what the other was up to but Harry insisted it was a surprise and that they would find out with the rest of Wizarding World. They had an enjoyable afternoon, now that Draco and Tom had joined forces instead of fighting over Harry, Harry had found it pleasing to be around the both of them again, very pleasing indeed.
Tom then left Harry to his own crazy thoughts. Harry completely missed it when Tom whispered "Help me win".
"They need to be controlled they are a danger to the statute of secrecy but I don’t want them dead like Dumbledore would let you believe."
"Yes I better be included in this to Harry." Harry turned to see Draco bowing at Tom. Harry rolled his eyes “Looks like I'm cooking for four".
Harry left with Hermione, but they soon went their separate ways, Harry to Slytherin and Hermione to Gryffindor. Harry walked slowly down to the dungeons, when he arrived he was bombarded by Pansy, Theo and Blaise. They all wanted to make sure he was okay because he hadn't come back last night, after he told them that he had spent the night watching over Draco, they wanted to know how the blonde was doing.
Harry finally reached the room of the requirement where Sirius and Remus welcomed him straight away. The room he entered look just like the Gryffindor common room but had no stairway just another door on the far side of the room. Harry sat by the fire with the other two and told them all about his day and they laughed and joked with each other, ordering food from Dobby when they got hungry. When Harry looked at his watch he realised he had missed the first five minutes of charms decided he would just missed the rest and claim he wasn't feeling well and went to lie down, everyone would believe it because that was the reason they had given to why he arrived at Hogwarts late. Harry, Sirius and Remus planned on how Harry could get revenge on his peers and of course it was all with a series if pranks... He was sitting with two of the marauder’s after all.
"Not that I am aware of, not without me killing you which is counterproductive." Voldemort answered curtly
"Sorry it was not my intention to ruin your homework." With a quick wave of his hand the line soaked into the parchment and disappeared."
He ran a hand through Draco's hair absentmindedly. His hair was soft as silk and ran through his fingers like water. He smiled as Draco smiled in his sleep; it was like his small gesture of comfort drifted into his friends sleep.
Harry looked as his feet "I know I should but the feelings I have for them are so real and different in every way and each day I find myself falling for them a little but more and I don't want to hurt anyone by choosing, and I'm scared the person being hurt will be me."
*********************************************************************************************************************
Voldemort chuckled. “They hated Harry Potter the chosen one of the light side, now that you are on the same side you might find that you will make some allies in Slytherin or friends as you like to call them, besides if any should give you trouble they will be defying a direct order from myself and will be punished.”
Harry and Hermione thought it was hilarious. When the three weren't pulling pranks and having fun they were in the library studying and learning new things about anything and everything. However no matter how much they asked Harry would not tell them how he had been injured; even Tom could not get it out of them, who joined them for dinner each night.
Harry nodded "I don't know what is, he's just always there" Hermione nudged him "Does someone have a thing for a certain blonde?"
He thought of a million things he could say to Dumbedore to justify the things going on with the Slytherins, he cursed that they hadnt been more descreet but with the soze of the groups coming to meet him at the lake that idea had gone out the window in the first week.
Hermione now had troubled look on her face, a battle was raging inside of her she was obviously scared of telling Harry." okay Harry promise not to lose your temper and that you will stay in bed" her eyes pleaded with Harry.
Voldemort smirked at Harry "Do not insult my intelligence Harry, I know when people are checking me out, plus me and Hermione have been talking I know everything."
Harry thought about it for a second before answering. "I was acting on pure instinct, like I could sense the intent to attack and my body just moved before I think."
It had been three weeks since Draco’s attack and the boy was fully healed, the only problem was that he hadn’t woken up yet. Madam Pomfrey said it was because his mind wasn’t ready to face the reality yet.  Every day that Draco didn’t wake up, Harry felt worse and worse. If it hadn’t been for his friends he probably would have been expelled for not showing up to classes or for being all doom and gloom. Harry rarely spoke to anyone and always had a lost look on his face, without Draco a light seemed to dim inside of Harry. The Twins had even visited on a Hogsmeade weekend and tried to get Harry in another prank but Harry had turned them down and left them without saying a word.
"Sirius!" Hermione squealed in delight, the man hugging Harry turned his head and looked at them, "The one and only. “He chuckled
They were then interrupted by a small first year who looked like he wanted to be anywhere else but talking to Harry.
"You godfather was Sirius Black?” Harry nodded again wondering what was with all these questions. "He fell through the veil in the department of mysteries correct?"
"Good to see you my boy" Dumbledore smiled his fake bright smile as Harry entered his office. "You wanted to see me sir?" Harry asked. Harry had been shocked after his talk with Tom when a third year Ravenclaw came up to him with a note from Dumbledore asking for his presence. At first he wasn't going to come but he wanted to know what the old coot wanted, he may be in Slytherin now but he would always be a Gryffindor at heart.
"Naturally Dumbledork will recognise me in my teenage form, but he will have no proof however that I am indeed me as the wizarding world it's self does not believe in Lord Voldemort's return."
"I don't have time Harry, I came looking for you to tell you, Ron's awake and yelling off the castle again...why is he here?"
Dumbledore nodded "yes Harry indeed, I merely wanted to know how life in Slytherin is treating you... I was growing worried I haven't seen you on the great hall fir sometime, you seem to be avoiding your housemates and I must say I assume the worst."
"I have Severus among my ranks, he is a great potions master, and he simply created a potion to return my looks to me." Voldemort as if it was the most obvious answer.
He was still consumed in his thoughts when he ran into someone. He looked up to see a disgruntled Lucius. "Sorry Lucius" he was about to walk away when Lucius spoke.
Draco nodded before wincing slightly before Harry could ask anything Draco raised his hand. “I’m fine it's the Dark Lord he is summoning me... It always burns when he does it so you can tell the difference."
"Even if the decide they are on our side I'm afraid that wont stop Voldemort Harry." He gave a a sorrowful look. "I doubt they will turn on their families, they might know their parents are wrong but for them family is everything."
The other three commended Harry on his caution but also couldn’t help but think he was an idiot, what if the poisoned the potion they were to give him, not that they had any intention of doing so. Snape left to grab some from his storage. While the others stayed in awkward silence, Draco still standing in the background wondering why he was still here but didn’t dare make a move like harry had done only moments before.
Harry stared wide eyed at the man as he made his way to the chair opposite the dark lord "You mean, your actually coming with us... How?"
Draco raced of the room, Hermione following behind. When they finally reached Harry's room the door was ajar and they could clearly hear Harry's muffled cries. But what confused them was someone was comforting him, they could hear their soft whispers. “I know that voice!" Hermione smiled and opened the door wider. Draco confused pushed in front he didn't like being left out and the sight he saw in front of him, made him freeze his mouth open wide in shock, if Harry had noticed he would have reminded Draco 'flies'.
Draco raised from his seat immediately rushing to the mirror on the other side of his room, Hermione couldn't control her laughter "Oh Merlin, it's just so easy!”
"What if that gets everyone killed? Sirius died, it was luck that he was able to come back, Cedric is gone, my parents are dead and Ron was my best friend and he now wants me dead not to mention all of Gryffindor wants my head on a spike, these were people who a few months ago I trusted with my life."
Snape handed Harry the antidote, Voldemort looked displeased, whether it was because he had to take the potion or because he wanted to ask Harry more questions no one could tell. Harry watched as the man reluctantly took the potion, Harry smirked it had been his idea after all, he shouldn’t have suggested it if he was so against it.
"Might has well have, we haven't seen you for days" Draco crossed his arms and tried to look angry at Harry though he didn't really succeed. "How's Sirius, Harry?" Hermione interrupted Draco's fake tantrum.
"You don't remember me? That hurts Harry." He could hear the sarcasm in the man’s voice. “We see each other about once a year, come on your memory can't be that bad, Hermione said she told you where you were."
Harry raised his eyebrows “It’s true Harry, Voldemort is so intelligent he is such a gentleman... He has been treating me like I'm royalty" Harry laughed at the thought of Voldemort snake like kissing her hand and having dinner having arguments about a book.
This time Harry left without looking back, moving his tired bones as fast as he could back to his dorm, the hallways were dark and the lanterns all but gone out, he didn’t dare use his wand for light. Other teachers would be patrolling the corridors and by normal standards Harry’s detention should have ended over two hours ago. It didn't seem like he had been in Voldemort’s presence for that long but it was clear that if he was caught out of bed Snape would deny keeping him this long, and a real detention and loss of house points would follow. Most of his housemates hated him enough already, he didn't want to give the anymore reason to. Once he was back in his dark dorm with the rest of his roommates asleep he climbed  into the warmth of his four poster bed, he closed his eyes and willed sleep to come, his mind had other things planned as he laid awake thinking of the nights transgressions for hours before finally falling into another night of restless sleep.
Harry missed any other comments as they turned toward the Slytherin Common room and he continued on to Snape's office.
Tom face palmed "Of course I should have known that with your reputation you would have already come across a class three magical creature."
Harry was now beyond exhausted, he didn’t even care that he was sticky as he cuddled up to the other two. This was such an unexpected development and he knew tomorrow when his brain began to work again, he would begin to over think things. But for the moment Harry was happy and content as he lay between the two, even if things didn’t work out Harry knew this moment would be one that he would always cherish and never forget.
Tom and Hermione laughed at Harry who shoved his face full of bacon in a Ron like manor to avoid talking. Tom got his attention by throwing a bread roll at him. It hit him right in the shoulder.
Draco quickly sorted out his appearance while Harry put on his mask; they walked down the hall hand in hand, both trying to show they would follow Harry to the end of the earth.
Draco nodded "Oh I know that Harry believe me, I didn't mean it like that at all, but I'm not going down without a fight Harry...what a Malfoy wants a Malfoy gets"
Draco shook his head "You really are an idiot you know that, I was a prat when we were younger, I should be the one apologising not you, but thank you... I'm always here for you Harry Potter."
Harry nodded once again, he followed Voldemort standing, he began leaving the room, when he reached the door, he turned back to the man. "Don't make me regret my decision."
The man laughed at Harry but didn't say anything. “Who are you?" Harry blurted out uncaring if he came across rude, it annoyed him that he couldn't remember where he had met this man before.
Draco was the only patient there when, Harry arrived, and he looked really pale in the moonlight. Harry walked toward him quietly, he sat in the arm chair and held the other boys hand.
"Merlin Harry, I want you to cook for me for the rest of my life!" Draco gave Harry a genuine smile, Harry couldn't help but think about the saying a way to a man’s heart is through his stomach. It seemed Harry had won Draco's friendship with one simple meal.
Tom was more than mad he was furious. Hermione had told him about what Harry had left to do. Yes he would have let him do what he wished with his revenge but he wished that he had told him before he left, he could have helped make sure he was safe, that teen was too reckless for his own good.
Hermione smiled wickedly "Basically the same thing Harry, either way it makes you look hot, so who cares?"
The man chuckled "No person sleeps that stiff now take these, it will help you heal faster." He handed Harry three vials, which Harry downed quickly having promised Hermione he would do as he was told earlier. Harry coughed the last one tasted like charcoal; he almost spit it back up... Having had much experience with horrible tasting potions from his time in the hospital wing, he didn't.
Tom gave Harry a quick kiss as if he could sense that Harry had begun to panic a few minutes ago. “Raven, Draco and I didn’t make this decision lightly, we are sorry if we went to fast with you last night.”
They sat there in silence, Harry and Draco could do this without it being awkward. Harry had a stronger bond that Harry and Ron were never close to getting. "Drake I'm sorry for not accepting your friendship back at Hogwarts"
Tears returned to Harry's eyes and this time he couldn't stop. He fell to the ground, his legs unable to hold him anymore. Draco crouched down and pulled Harry into a tight embrace, rubbing soothing circles around his back. "Shhh Harry it's okay, you have people who love you here with you"
Dumbledore raised his hands "Let’s not fight boys, to answer your question Tom. It has been foreseen that Harry is the only one with the power to defeat Voldemort, he is a beacon for hope for many people that is what I meant... Harry possess power lord Voldemort himself can never even dream of, Harry can love immensely, and Voldemort couldn't love anyone if he tried."
Making his way down to the great hall, he couldn't help but think how different this year was going to be, he would be hanging out with Draco and not Ron, he would be attending school with his parents murderer and not be bothered. His parents best friends, the closest thing had to family besides Hermione and the twins would be secretly hidden in the castle helping him cause trouble and having fun. It was going to be one hell of a year that was for sure... Harry potter was going to take Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry by storm
It was later that evening, while he was practicing communicating with Voldemort that he felt an odd presence in his mind. He smiled hoping this meant he had succeded finaly after weeks of practice.
" So according to this law, a true antidote to a blended poison is more than the sum of its parts?" Harry asked still confused
Draco had a panicked looked on his face. "You can’t just say that kind of stuff in front of the Dark Lord."
Hermione rolled her eyes "Yeah right, people get hooked on your food after the first bite just look at me and Draco."
"Okay so you didn't join the Slytherin team as seeker, always gaining my attention by insulting me or my friends, always getting me in trouble and no one else, join Umbitches club so you could follow me everywhere?"
"Stupid Uncle Vernon and his temper" at least the man would finally get his wish, Harry would soon no longer exist in this world and would be reunited with his family.
Voldemort scowled “I should have you killed for the way you speak of me however that would waste my efforts of saving you.” The older man was silent for a moment before he smirked as he noticed Harry staring. “Like what you see Harry?”
"So no one would know" Harry stated with an eyebrow raised but he had a huge grin on his face waiting for Draco to realise.
Dumbledore sighed "Okay but I don't think anything will become of it." Dumbledore did not look happy but he didn’t like the attention this was receiving so he gave in.
*********************************************************************************************************************
Harry continued to stare at the bracelet, completely forgetting that Tom still hadn't let go of his hand, until Tom began rubbing circles on the back of Harry's hand over the scar that the blood quill had left him. Harry then began focusing on the heat that Tom's hand was bringing to his, he began to blush which caused Tom to smirk at him, which didn't help at all it just made Harry turn an even darker shade of red.
Voldemort nodded his head. "A week from now you will give me choice and we shall discuss this deal of yours then, it would be best if you joined we could do great things."
Draco and Tom positioned Harry so that, Tom was behind him and Draco in front, Draco was on all fours in front of Harry. Harry had no idea what he was doing as Draco reached behind him to insert Harry slowly inside him. Harry let out another loud moan as he felt Draco surrounding him, Draco mimicking him as he felt Harry enter him. Once Harry was all the way, he didn’t move straight away, copying Tom and letting the other get used to the feeling. Tom had used this time to insert himself slowly into Harry. Who now was overwhelmed with sensations and his eyes rolled to the back oh his head.
Draco pulled Harry away so he could look at him and cupped his face, Draco had an angry but concerned face as he spoke to Harry.. "Now you listen to me Harry James Potter and you better darn well listen good, Ron and the rest of the Gryffindorks can screw themselves they are nothing but back stabbers and you have your true friends now, I will never leave you because I couldn't imagine my life without you either, a part of me always wanted to be your friend since first year and now I have you I'm not letting go for anything!"
Harry just smiled and listened to her friend gush about Charlie, he was just happy that his friend was happy so he didn't mind listening. He watched as she blushed and smiled as she explained how wonderful Charlie was as she raised his wardrobe looking for the 'perfect outfit' as she called it.
"No I'm want you to give them to Draco for me...OF COURSE I'm giving them to you. But I expect to read one day."
Harry tried to fight even though he knew it was useless, instead he started ranting. "Fuck!, why do you think, I have had you try to kill me for as long as i have been alive, my only family hate my very existence and wish you killed me when you had the chance and treat me worse the Lucius Malfoy treats his houselves. My godfather died in front of me, he was all I had left.  Everyone expects so much from me and when I don’t live up their expectations, I am hated, I’m famous for something awful or what about the fact that every evil thing you do I’m blamed for because I am supposed to have killed you when i was a baby, so it’s my fault that you roaming about and everyone expects me to something about it even though I am only sixteen and despite all this I’m still expected to go to classes and act like nothing is wrong, oh and no one tells me anything and I constantly feel trapped in a role and just want to run away, I want things to end."
He smirked at Harry. “He yelled at me a few days ago for taking up all your attention by not waking up, he told me that if I hadn’t woken up within the week he would torment me until I did.”
He handed his plan to Hermione who started reading immediately, a small smile appeared as she read. "I think this could actually work, unlike some of the other plans you've created."
Hermione nudged Draco "Honestly do you have a death wish, since when do you act like a Gryffindor and acting before you think?"
Harry moved so that Draco could lay down and he was curled into the other boy, Draco ran his hand up and down Harry’s spine. They stayed like this for hours, just talking. Harry felt a lot better now that Draco was awake, he felt at peace. Just before dinner they were joined by the others, they had come to drag Harry to get something to eat and were pleasantly surprised to see Draco awake. “Where are my cuddles Harry? You have been neglecting me!” Tom smirked not letting the others see how much the scene bothered him.
Harry looked at his watch, deciding that it was late enough he headed down to the hospital wing, where he could be there when Draco woke up.
Draco the stood up and then helping Harry up who now was laughing, Draco joined in "See I told you" he said as he made his way to the kitchen.
"War cannot be our only option, they are humans just like us, if we disgard them then what are we even fighting for we would have sunk down to as be as bad as evil."
Harry took a deep breath and nodded to himself. "I choose to join you, I will not kill or torture anyone, I want to reserve the right to refuse to do a task with a valid reason. I also want to be able change my mind if I wish and go neutral and I want the people I care about safe, other than that I think we can come to an agreement."
The two adults watched as the blonde was successfully calming his rival down, a few minutes passed when Harry's breathing returned to normal, he became conscious of the fact that his hand was still on Draco's chest, he pulled it away gently, his arm feeling to heavy to belong to his body.
Harry released him from the hug and nodded, he knew there was more to it than that but trusted Draco to tell him when he was ready, Hermione came into the room "It’s time, Harry get your mask on."
"Really, hey maybe next time you feel sad I can get mother to tell you stories about Sirius, show you photos, I would get her know but she is in Paris."
Harry shivered “Don’t call me that, I can take care of myself. I faced you on multiple occasions and survived didn't I?"
Harry placed a hand on Tom’s cheek. “I understand, it’s kind of how I felt when I found out that you have been helping Draco all this time and I couldn’t do anything.”
The two parents were shocked. “FRED AND GEORGE WEASLEY I GAVE BIRTH TO YOU I AM YOUR MOTHER AND YOU WILL SHOW YOUR FATHER AND I SOME RESPECT"
Drake nodded "Yup and he knows it." They both smiled brightly up at the professor who grinned at in return "Ah I see" and she then returned to the staff table and engaged in a conversation with Professor Flitwick, no doubt telling him all about her interaction with Harry and Draco.
"I won’t say anything Potter." Draco smirked. "We might be on the same side soon after all, that and I would have to admit I spent the evening in your presence."
Tom bent down next to Harry's ear and whispered “This is your home Harry". Causing Harry to shiver once again. Harry could tell that Tom was enjoying this.
Harry let a small smile grace his features, he had already been tired before his attack but now he felt ready to slip blissfully into a coma.
When Harry woke up Draco was already gone, he removed the green sheets which had wrapped around him. He slowly opened the door, just enough to peek through, and no one was there... He didn't want anyone to see him sneaking away from Draco's quarters, they would think something of it when there wasn't anything to think about. He ran down the hall to his room where shut the door quickly behind him.
Harry smiled “ We have always been close, they looked out for me and have always been on my side, I have helped them with a prank or two and when I gave them the funding they need for their store they begged me to blood adopt them, apparently I was the only one who believed in them. I accepted"
together with Harry in the middle; none of them said a word as their friends looked at them puzzled.
There evil plotting turned out I be just enjoying Harry's cooking once again. Harry smiled at his friends, Harry already had a plan.
Harry looked down to his feet “I wish to go back to Hogwarts with Draco and Hermione and be resorted"
Hermione and Harry spent the rest of the morning riding the horses and had a picnic outside in a Field filled with different types of flowers that held every colour of the rainbow it was simply breathtaking. Hermione had dragged Harry to one of the library's to Harry's dismay however they had lots of funny learning new spells by three o'clock, Harry had mastered ten new spells. Harry then dragged Hermione to the kitchen where he cooked her favourite chocolate sponge cake. Hermione adored Harry's cooking; whenever she asked how he could cook he simply would say it was something he loved to do. Hermione would have eaten the whole cake if she could if it hadn't been so filling and her not wanting her to get fat. Harry had laughed at her as he took a bite of his own slice of cake, he had complete forgot about who's house he was currently in and was lost in the moment of having fun with Hermione when a teenage blond walked in.
"Potter unfortunately for your plans, I did not come here to kill you but I cannot let you go, we need to talk.”
Tom's eyebrow rose toward his hairline "Oh but I think you do, I think I recall Longbottom retelling a tale about you and Draco down by the lake, you laying in his lap while his finger ran through your hair."
Tom raised his hand “I understand you’re worried about Harry. I will let it slide this time, be sure it doesn't happen again, next time even Harry will not get in the way of my wrath."
Harry woke and he felt much better, he thought he could run a marathon if he was a faster runner. Hermione came to visit, when she was satisfied that he was well enough she gave Harry the tour of the manor. It was huge! There were over a thousand rooms, there were bedrooms, studies, libraries, some were empty some had random things placed inside them. Harry was mesmerised he had never been in a house this big before. Outside he had a Quidditch pitch, lake and a stables. The land could fit three of manors inside and still have plenty room for everything else. Harry wandered where Tom got all the money to afford this place but then he thought about how Tom was the dark lord and could do anything he wanted.
Hermione stared at him for a while before deciding it was okay to continue. “Voldemort thought it would be easier for me to be here when you woke up so you wouldn't go crazy."
Harry gave Ron an apologetic look. "Sorry mate, gotta go, I am running late for a meeting." He gave Ron the look as if to say he had a meeting with Dumbledore, knowing that his friend would not question it, he hated lying to his friend but it was not like he could tell him that he was actually about to spend the next couple of hours with a group of Slytherin's.
Harry was silent as he walked to class with his two best friends, neither of them noticed as they were arguing with each other, but one never knew with Hermione, that girl could multitask like a pro, she might pounce later when she was one hundred percent that something was wrong with Harry, it was only early in the morning and he clearly didn’t get much sleep, so she could just be justifying his silence as him being tired. The three sat in their normal seats at the back of the classroom with Harry in the middle of the two. Harry was supposed to be a mediator between the two but just didn’t feel like it today. He got out his parchment and quill and opened his textbook to the appropriate page before resting his head on the desk, while waiting to make his dramatic entrance he did every lesson. He didn’t see Malfoy spare him a glance as he took his usual spot in the front row. Then Harry's hair began to stand on edge as he sensed danger, he quickly stood whipped out his wand and cast a protego around himself as he scanned the area, to the shock to most of the class, a handful of students had also sensed something off and had acted as Harry had. Before the people sit seated could question the oddity, stunning spells came from all directions, stunning all those who hadn’t acted and the ones who had were ordered to renovate them as Snape walked into the room. Once that was done he barked at everyone to sit.
He positioned Harry so that he had access to Harry’s ass, this left Draco to watch as Harry was prepared by Tom. He slowly inserted the first finger, letting Harry get used to the feeling before moving it. He made sure to twirl and bend his finger stretching Harry as he moved his finger in and out, in slow movements at first before getting faster; he repeated this until he had all three fingers inside Harry. With each movement now Harry moaned.
They spent the next hour or so, talking about what Harry's involvement would be, where the line began and where it would end. Harry would not have to torture but if Voldemort required him to bring him someone he would. Harry had the right to refuse certain orders from Voldemort but would have to have reasoning as to why, and if he objected to anything Voldemort does or says, he was to only voice his opinion in private and never in front of any of his followers to do so would result in punishment.
Draco and Hermione caught on and joined him in laughter, getting odd looks from the Slytherin's around him.
She shook him lightly "I'm your best friend and have known you for years, I would be a pretty bad friend if I didn't know you...so spill!"
Harry yawned so Hermione left him to sleep, with strict orders not to leave the bed before kissing him on the forehead and promising to visit him tomorrow. Harry let his head rest on the pillow and slowly drift to sleep.
Hermione gave him a disapproving look “Harry James Potter, you have to tell him, so help me I'll tell him myself!"
"Killing you is no longer part of the plan, I have no desire to kill you but that can be changed if you continue to vex me so." Tom snapped at Harry, his brown eyes flashing red and the tension in the air thickened with the anger rising from the Dark Lord. Harry stayed silent as he watched those in the room, they didn’t seem to be shocked by the dark lords statement at all.
Harry stared at Draco, he had never thought about that, until now. “I can apparate on Hogwarts grounds"
Harry smiled and tears appeared in his eyes, he had no idea how Draco had found out about the first date that James had taken Lilly on but it was the sweetest thing anyone had ever done.
Harry made his way to the Room of Requirement, feeling like it was kind of a betrayal to have the meeting in the Dumbledore's Army old training grounds but with a lack of a better option, he really didn't have a choice in the matter, not to mention he had swapped sides in the upcoming war nothing could be a bigger betrayal.
He was woken by an angry Ron, apparently the red haired teen had waited up for him to get back from detention and had fallen asleep on the armchair by the fire place, while he was annoyed Harry hadn’t noticed and woken him so he could have slept in his bed and not have the pain in his neck he currently had, he wasn’t angry at Harry, he was angry at Snape. His best friend was currently plotting revenge for keep Harry out so late and risking the teen getting another detention. Harry would just nod along with whatever Ron was saying, too tired to really pay attention and to busy thinking of the reason why Snape had kept him back so late. Could he really join Voldemort, become his spy, all for the sake of the people he cares about? This was his parent’s murderer, the reason he was tortured by the Dursley’s all these years, why his friends were in danger the first place. Then again he could take himself out of the fight entirely, leave his friends to make their own choices, he mentally shook his head, he couldn’t do that he wouldn’t be able to stand aside and let his friends get hurt. Or he could ignore the really weird talk and continue to fight against them, instead of joining them, they would hunt him down but that wouldn’t make a difference to the situation he was currently in. Harry sighed he didn’t want to be a part of the war, he was tired of fighting, he wanted a normal life, besides why should he fight for the people who shun him, who expect him to have all the answers and fight against a man who had more knowledge then he could ever dream of and he was only sixteen. Even Dumbledore expected him to be the one to defeat Voldemort because of the prophecy and the so call power he was supposed to know. Despite knowing firsthand the professor Trelawney can predict a true prophecy, who says that all prophecy’s come true or that she didn’t make it up to get the job, and just by pure chance it kind of happened, it was only because Voldemort knew of the first half and acted upon it that the first part was even true. Harry certainly didn’t have any special abilities that Voldemort wasn’t aware of, he could literally see inside his mind, pretty hard to keep anything a secret that way. If he had a special power then not even Harry himself was aware of it. All that aside, even if he could stomach joining the dark side, how would he convince his friends to stop fighting the very thing that threatened their way of life? Harry banged his head on the table at breakfast, it didn’t matter what he did Harry potter felt entirely screwed.
"That's why I wish Tom and Draco would stop all of this, I don't have time to have a love life, I have to make them pay for hurting me."
Draco nodded "True she is a super human; however you have always been better at Defence against the dark arts and cooking!"
It wasn't hard to say that Harry didn't sleep well; restless sleep was what he was given after a very tiring day.
Harry smiled "Not bloody likely, you’re a slut, you sleep with anything that has a dick...you’re not my type you see I quite enjoy dick myself actually"
Harry sighed and stood up, stretching out all the kinks from sitting for so long he began to make his way to the entrance to the common room, when Ron called out to him from across the room.
Hermione found Harry reading in the corner of the library. "I'm never going to get used to you reading."
Harry nodded at the two. When Sirius spoke up. “But really Harry the night he gets out of the hospital?” The older man said gesturing to Draco.
They were still laughing when Hermione walked in, she stood there shocked before giggling at their appearance. “Is it a thing now, chocolate facials?"
Harry nodded not looking at Draco. Draco didn't hesitate he grabbed Harry's hand and pulled him inside the room, shutting the door behind him. "Drake you don't have to, I don't want to bother you.”
Harry had laughed. Draco had also taken Harry and Hermione shopping and brought them proper wizard attire as he put it. Harry had even managed to convince him to let them buy a few pairs of muggle clothes as well; even Draco had brought some for himself.
He had begun to get along with some of the other sixth year Slytherins. He paired with Draco a couple of times during potions earning points from Slughorn for house unity. He had been seen walking to charms with Blaise and passing notes to Pansy during class.
Harry shook his head "No I'm not going to die in some stupid war Professor, this war started before I was born...you deal with it!"
Harry grinned. “Make sure that you do, I want to ruin Albus Dumbledore, but you must leave that out, make it seem like, I was unsure to tell you but I have broken free from his strings and becoming my own person.”
Voldemort hesitated before answering; it didn’t look like he was resisting merely thinking of what his answer was. "As long as you don’t put yourself in danger I can’t see why you can’t live your life, although locking you in a tower does seem like it would have its perks." He gave Harry a smirk. "It would be also best if you either joined me or removed yourself from the fray altogether, I would rather not have to destroy you because you were working to destroy me, I do have other horcruxes to fall back on if you leave me no other choice."
"I'm glad you agreed to this date Harry... I thought you were going to decline" Draco said squeezing Harry’s hand.
"Ha you were being paid with my own money I trusted you and you threw it in my face now I'll take pleasure in watching you burn."
Harry looked at the ceiling "I have no idea what you’re talking about Tom." Still trying to figure away to get out of this situation.
“Everyone knows your my friend, I need her to back up the story otherwise people might believe that what we are telling isn’t the truth, Rita has a lot of sway with the readers, we unfortunately need her.. It worked well enough in fifth year.”
Draco moved so he was looking directly into Harry's eyes. “You have me now, and Hermione, I know that we can’t replace him in your heart and I don’t want to just remember blood doesn't make family...you have us now... Just treasure the time you had with him"
Sweat dripped down Harry's face slowly, leaving dirty trails behind, his rapid breathing and beating heart were the only signs that he was distressed. His legs aching with each step as hewalked through the darkness, each step he took was as if he was wandering into a black hole. Harry wanted nothing more than for this to end, he after all wasn't living he was just surviving and to Harry that was meaningless. He stopped for a second to check on his wound, blood running down his cheats in a heavy stream. Harry cursed he knew he didn't have long.
The easier of the two is the magic around them that was the sense of danger Harry and some of the others had acted on, it was pretty basic, hence why Snape was so irritated at the class. Harry would have expected being in tune with your own magic would have been the easier of the two, but apparently because so many people reject things about themselves, pretend to be something they are not they lose themselves to fit in and therefore become less Intune with their own magic. according to even the textbook if one was to focus hard enough, you should be able to feel you magic flowing within your body, feel it connecting to the magic around you, train it to warn you of any dangers lurking, it was another reason why wandlss magic was so rare, you had to feel the magic and then conduct it, wands were simply a training tool but over time had become a necessity as witches and wizards lost contact with their magic throughout the generations, so now only the select and more powerful few were able to amazing feats of magic without a wand.
He sat there until the others were ready to acknowledge him, which didn't take long, only the few minutes it took for Draco to wake up. The blonde had looked around the room confused and when his brain began working again he spoke "Oh My Merlin, please tell me I fainted and imagined what I thought I just saw."
The next few weeks were very weird for Harry, the Slytherins were being odd. Not once had they gone after Harry or his friends, no rude comments, no hexes, no one even interfered with his potion to cause an explosion. More than once multiple Slytherins had come up to Harry shocking everyone around him  and would quietly ask Harry questions about the spells Harry had asked them. His only guess was that they were taking their orders from their Lord seriously.
“Thanks Hermione.” Draco smiled. “You didn’t have to do that, Tom hasn’t let miss anything while I was asleep.”
Harry smirked "Oh he's in Voldemort's dungeon now, chained up I believe if the spell worked fine, hope he doesn’t annoy anyone, or get blood everywhere... You see Molly I won't stand harm to come of my family... Oh and I'm evicting you from this property, as of a week ago I own this disastrous excuse of a house".
The walk to Tom's meeting point was a long one drawn out by silence. When they arrived Hermione and Draco went and joined there spot in the meeting and Harry stood next to Tom like he was told he had to do. He had the eyes of a hundred death eaters giving him daggers as he stood there with his head held high like Draco taught him. He acted as if the people in front of him were nothing. When he found Hermione and Draco he focused on them. He didn't really hear the meeting, just kept himself focused on his two friends, trying not to show how scared he was to be there.
Sirius nodded "Just let whatever should be happen, let your heart decide and be damned what everyone else thinks!"
Harry knocked on the door leading to Tom's study he was answered after his first knock. "Come in Harry."
He also mentioned to the Goblins that he wanted to be emancipated, and have Dumbledore's right over him stripped. The goblins gave the kick the Ministry needed to get that started. When Dumbledore had been informed it hadn't been a pretty sight, he had come bursting into the hall, with Molly trailing not far behind, and both were red in the face and looking like they would murder anyone who got in their way.
“Oh lets agree never to kiss again, I’m glad it annoyed your old family but you guys are now related to me by blood and it’s too weird.”
"Stupid Uncle Vernon and his temper" at least the man would finally get his wish, Harry would soon no longer exist in this world and would be reunited with his family.
Hermione was angry now " I know a real memory when I see one Harry! They don't call be the brightest which of my age for nothing!"
"Because I have made it clear that I clearly want something more with you and yes Harry I know you enjoyed that moment in my study just as much as I did."
He sat on the bed sitting up refusing to lie down. "Who saved me? I have a right to know, I now owe them a life debt"
"Okay what the hell is going on, you just spent the entire time in potions laughing with Malfoy?" Hermione asked
"Oh so I never rushed into things to save people almost killing myself in the process, I have a saving people thing... Even Hermione says so?"
Tom, Draco and Hermione had dinner together, all three were well aware of the brunette missing presence. Draco was confused he could see the look of guilt on both Tom and Hermione’s faces both thought it their fault that Harry hadn’t shown up for dinner, leaving a house elf to serve his creations.
Dumbledore's face was priceless he had a face mixed with both shock and anger, Tom was laughing behind his hand silently.
Tom nodded at Harry " I know to which you refer, those views were due to a moment of insanity my views have changed let me prove them to you.. Hermione has joined my ranks; she is currently in my inner circle... You would be to"
Harry let out a deep breath. "If and I mean if, I chose to either go neutral or join you can we make a deal that you will leave my friends alone if I can get them to either go neutral or join."
“We get to go flying" Draco gestured to the two brooms lying next to the blanket... "Your mum hated flying."
"I saw you by the lake, you were asleep in his lap, he was running fingers through your hair, I just assumed you were together."
Rita hit Harry’s arm playfully. “Oh Harry you know business is business, why don’t I get us some butterbeer hmmm?”
Tom nodded at Harry " I know to which you refer, those views were due to a moment of insanity my views have changed let me prove them to you.. Hermione has joined my ranks; she is currently in my inner circle... You would be to"
Draco and Harry's breath were mixing together, their lips almost touching. They were both looking into each other’s eyes when Draco leaned even closer to Harry and kissed Harry, it was different to the kiss he had with Tom. This one was soft and sweet and so full of emotion, Harry could clearly feel the way that Draco felt about him in the kiss. It was slow and made Harry melt, his worries just disappeared within Draco's kisses so when Draco licked Harry's lip Harry gave him entrance and sighed into the kiss as Draco tasted ever bit if Harry's mouth. Harry felt like he was in heaven until the kissed stopped and Harry was brought back into reality.
Ron hadn’t noticed Harry’s inner turmoil, instead continued his rant all through breakfast, even Hermione had stopped chastising him for insulting the Professor and started to ignore him, it seemed Ron really had woken on the wrong side of the bed- well couch in the case but the statement was still true. Harry played with his food more then he ate, but he did manage to eat a few pieces of toast. He wanted nothing more than to talk to Ron and Hermione, but they wouldn’t understand, they would tell him Voldemort couldn’t be trusted and that was that, even despite the fact that he couldn’t lie while under the truth potion. Harry groaned he could feel a headache coming and just knew that today was not going to be a good day, especially since they started the day with Defence against the dark arts. He wasn’t going to be able to escape his thoughts of last night with Snape and Malfoy in the exact room it all happened in. Harry even considered going to the hospital wing despite his hatred of that place just to escape his morning lesson with the Slytherin head of house. He already felt that his thoughts were running on repeat, always thinking the same things in a loop, over and over and being in the presence of both Malfoy and Snape would only serve to make things worse.
Harry laughed as she vanished from their site. Harry turned to Draco and his hysterical laughter started again. “We need to clean up now, before anyone else see us like this." Draco nodded smiling wiping one last piece of icing right down Harry's shirt. “Now we are even" he poked his tongue out before heading out for a shower.
He heard a pop alerting him that someone had apperated into his wards, he knew it was Harry so he made his way to Harry's room. Not bothering to knock of the door he just walked and glared at Harry who just simply smiled. Harry was put under crucio before the he could blink however it only lasted a few seconds. “Mione told you didn't she?". Tom rolled his eyes at the teen. “Of course she did, she's not my adviser for no reason."
Hermione and Harry spent the rest of the morning riding the horses and had a picnic outside in a Field filled with different types of flowers that held every colour of the rainbow it was simply breathtaking. Hermione had dragged Harry to one of the library's to Harry's dismay however they had lots of funny learning new spells by three o'clock, Harry had mastered ten new spells. Harry then dragged Hermione to the kitchen where he cooked her favourite chocolate sponge cake. Hermione adored Harry's cooking; whenever she asked how he could cook he simply would say it was something he loved to do. Hermione would have eaten the whole cake if she could if it hadn't been so filling and her not wanting her to get fat. Harry had laughed at her as he took a bite of his own slice of cake, he had complete forgot about who's house he was currently in and was lost in the moment of having fun with Hermione when a teenage blond walked in.
“I’m going to be gentle since it’s your first time, but I can’t say I will always control my self” Tom spoke with a smirk.
“Have you made your decision then?” Voldemort spoke quietly it was almost like a whisper but it still made Harry jump.
"I agree, surprisingly, he wasn't what I expected." Pansy spoke. "I was half expecting him to not show up and turn us in, payback for last year and all."
Sirius was now hugging Hermione "Thanks for looking out for my cub, Mione... I'm glad he has a friend like you!"
The lesson passed surprisingly quickly, Harry had been so focused on their topic that he hadn’t even thought if his dilemma, or goof off with Ron, who had done nothing all lesson as a sign of protest against the professor and was annoyed that Harry had actually seemed interested in the dungeon bats lesson. After defence they had charms, this time Harry didn’t pay too much attention, his focus was touch and go between the lesson and playing hang man with Ron. Lunch he was to focused on his thoughts again to really eat, he ate half his ham and cheese sandwich before calling it quits. He noticed Hermione eyeing him from across the table, but avoided eye contact, he knew she would ask what was wrong eventually but he didn’t want to make it any sooner.
Harry jaw dropped Tom chuckled. "Her responsibly will be more focused on magical creature welfare, I have made many promises that she attends to help me keep, right now she is working on amending the werewolf laws"
Then the both walked to the library were they started studying for their new year in Hogwarts. Harry would no longer be at the bottom.
The snake hissed happily, "Oh yes I get fed and a nice warm dark place to live, if it weren't for the ugly faces every day I would be just fine."
Voldemort noticed that Harry wasn’t rejecting the idea completely and was for once not being disrespectful and was just distrustful and rightfully so, the anger dispersed from his body, the thickened air becoming normal once again. "If I must I can perform a wizard oath or use veritaserum, if that makes you trust my word. Secretly hoping he that Harry would use the wizard’s oath, he didn’t want to degrade himself by using the potion but it was one of the easiest ways to gain the raven haired teens trust.
Harry raised his hand to stop Tom "Don't... I'll guess I will see you at dinner, I made dessert so don't be late." Harry ran from the room before another word could be said. For the first time in his life Tom stood there in shock, he had no idea what had gone wrong, it bothered him greatly.
Harry pointed in the direction he wished to go. "Already seen one of them, Sirius has a one as a pet, why waste time there?"
Harry held his index finger out and smirked as he wiped it down Ron's arm, he chuckled when Ron jumped back. "Oops sorry did I get my faggot germs on you, here let me wipe it off"
Tom nodded, “Severus is usually the one I would give such a task to, but he is currently busy with another mission. He told me you had been the leader of a defense group last year among your peers and were highly successful, everyone in your club passed their owls and even I can admit that your friends were not the worst fighters I have seen at the ministry.”
Harry shook his head as he untangled himself from the two as he sat up. “It’s not that at all, I quite enjoyed last night.” The two smirked at Harry and Harry continued. “I’m just not sure how this is supposed to work? I mean you and Draco were both fighting over me a few weeks ago and I have so much to worry about.”
Harry poked his tongue out at Tom and Pansy laughed "Draco makes you sound like a housewife Potter."
Fortunately Snape had been in his office when he arrived, he did seem put out to see Harry but it seemed he had expected it all the same.
Harry opened his eyes “How did you know?" he knew that voice from somewhere but because of there being no light in the room he couldn't see the face of which it belonged to. Harry sat up and put his glasses back on.
Harry couldn't believe it he had been backed into a corner by none other then Tom Riddle himself, Harry had been running away from Draco when Tom appeared and apparently Tom wasn't letting Harry escape easily... Or at all for that matter.
Before anyone could say or do anything, he Fred and George apperated, not before they set fire to the house of course, where would the fun be if they didn’t?
"Hmm let me think, there is no way it's you Harry." Harry removed his hand and smiled at Draco. “Stealing my food again Draco?"
Harry scoffed at her “The man cheated on you Mione! He has cheated on you so much we have all lost count! As your brother it is my duty to defend you honour...it beyond me why you still defend him."
Harry released him from the hug and nodded, he knew there was more to it than that but trusted Draco to tell him when he was ready, Hermione came into the room "It’s time, Harry get your mask on."
Harry reddened "What makes you say that?" Harry skilfully managed to look everywhere but at Hermione.
Soon Tom sat in front of Harry a blush still clearly on his face, Harry immediately started laughing again. "Yes! Looks like I'm not the only one!"
The Matron still didn't look like she believed that Harry and Hermione were innocent. So Harry said the one thing that would convince her.
Once they were in Harry’s and Draco’s room, the door was locked and charms placed upon it so no one would enter or hear what activities were happening inside.
"Hmm I don't know? I mean you just avoid them both like they have some kind of disease all of a sudden!"
So she did the only going she could think of and kicked him in the shin. He jumped back in pain causing him to fall and bump his head on the ground. Hermione couldn't help but giggle, he had deserved it after all. "OW Hermione! What the bloody hell was that for?" Harry got up rubbing his shin and the back of his head. "You are being a git! I hardly see you for the last two weeks and when I do you completely ignore me!"
Harry tried to remember how he got here but the last thing he remembered was running from the Dursley's after Vernon attacked him. Who had saved him? He didn't recognise anything around him so he couldn't be at the headquarters of the order of the Phoenix then Harry soon started to panic what of someone from the order had found him and were going to force him to fight for them. Harry scoffed there would no way he would fight he thought it was ridiculous that they put the fate of the war in a child's hands, he only just finished Hogwarts and they expected him to be able to defeat the freaking dark lord, one of the most powerful wizards since the founders of Hogwarts themselves...yeah right.
Tom nodded. “Turns out we both don’t hate each other as much as we thought.” He paused to smile. “I may not like to share and that he has his own place in your heart but I am thankful that you have him in your life and I understand now after seeing you these past few weeks that you need him in your life.”
Ron nodded and turned his attention back to Dean, he started dealing out cards as Harry looked away and began leaving the common room once again
Harry opened his eyes expecting to be welcomed by his parents to be finally reunited with the people he had longed for most, but he wasn't he was in dim lit room, he clenched his fist into the sheets they were defiantly real this wasn't a dream. Harry looked around the room taking in his surroundings the only thing that was in the room was a cupboard a bedside table and a chair that was placed near the bed as if someone had been watching him as he slept.
Hermione nodded but that was the end of that conversation at least for now... Harry just hoped they didn't talk to Dumbledore or his lie would be exposed, he could always take credit for the idea and say he used Dumbledore as an excuse for his friends not to worry.
Harry blushed a deep red "I may have seen them in an uncomfortable position yesterday, and didn't feel like seeing that ever again... Hey Hermione maybe you can obliviate me, so I no longer have the picture in my head"
They continued having their deep and meaningful conversation both continuing to tease each other until Harry fell asleep on Draco, instead of waking him he ran his fingers through his black silky hair. Draco smiled down at Harry, to him Harry looked so peaceful while sleeping, with his cheeks slightly flushed and a small relaxed smile. It made Draco wonder how much sleep the teen was getting, he knew with Sirius back another weight would be lifted from Harry's shoulders, but he knew there was something else playing on the boys mind... He just wished he knew what that something was.
It took Harry a second until he turned to Hermione glaring, who scaring lay smirked at him. “Next time you won't smudge chocolate on me"
Hermione grabbed a napkin and wiped the chocolate away "He heard my Ideals from Draco and approved so he chose me, told me it was an honour I'm the only muggle born he will tolerate... Plus it helps I'm best friends with you."
Neville smiled "It's clear that Tom and Draco have a thing for you it's entertaining watching them fight for the one who gets you plus Tom gets me to tell him these things."
"One of these days I'm going to talk to Draco about taking you shopping, I'm sure he will be more the happy to help you get a new wardrobe."
The two pounced on Harry. Harry let out a shuddering breath, trying to calm his rapid beating heart. Harry pulled Tom into a deep kiss, he could feel Draco kissing and nipping on his neck as he kissed Tom. He wasn’t sure what was going to happen but he knew that Tom and Draco would guide him with what to do. The next few moments would forever be imprinted in Harry’s memory.
The walked around the gardens, Harry admired the flowers. "Magic really is amazing" Draco chuckled but didn't say anything. The continued to walk in a comfortable silence for a while, just enjoying each other's company. Harry was the one to break the silence. "Drake did you know Sirius"
Voldemort smirked and before he could even speak, Harry scoffed. "You can forget My Lord, I can just call you your chosen name Voldemort but apparently it’s a taboo to say the name because everyone around here fears it.”
If it were possible Harry would have said the snake looked quite stunned. "Hello young speaker, who is your companion?"
"I have only recently learned that you are one of my horcruxes, I believe you remember out encounter at the ministry that was when I learned of your status as a horcrux, I  believe it happened that night fifteen years ago, when the curse rebounded I had no intention of making you one of them."
Voldemort was sitting in Snape’s chair, while the Professor was nowhere to be seen, it was so much different than the last time he had entered this room with Voldemort presence. “You know this could have gone bad if it hadn’t been me knocking?”
However for this moment Harry was allowing himself to enjoy the company of his friends and made a mental note to see Sirius and Remus soon, they would have been worried and he didn’t want them to do anything reckless, not that he could talk.
Harry took a deep breath as he took in the familiar seen, the smell of freshly cooked bacon hung in air, the clatter of mess in an organised manner. He stepped into the kitchen and the chatter instantly stopped. Ron looked like he wanted to blow something up, Mr and Mrs Weasley had a light of hope in their eyes which Harry couldn't wait to squish and Ginny looked as if she were the normal crazy obsessive teen she always had been. Mrs Weasley smiled up at Harry "Oh Harry dear it's great that you finally came home." Harry gesture for her to stop what she was doing as she had started to grab him in a hug. She looked startled but however she didn't show it for long. Harry was yet to say a word.
Harry looked at his watch. “I’m sorry Luna but I have to go, did you want me to walk you anywhere before I go?”
"Merlin's beard, even though I have tried to deny it in the past, I thought the whole school knew this fact."
Harry didn’t seem any closer to an answer as he snuck out of the Gryffindor common room and made his way down to the Snape’s office. This was a life changing decision, one that was life or death.
"He properly fancies you" Hermione gave him a shocked look but soon recovered and she gave him a smile.
Harry smiled "It was bound to happen eventually, me being so curious about everything and all" Hermione chuckled. “I’m surprised to see you’re not with Draco"
Startled, she sat between her husband and Ginny who was looking at Harry as if she was daydreaming of their wedding day. Harry smirked "First of all you can cut the shit… I know"
Voldemort eyebrows rose as he stared at Harry, his former enemy was laying I front of him, he saved his life and all he had to say was that he had hair. “Really that's all you have to say."
Harry laughed but raised his hands up in surrender. "Okay no more Tommy gotcha, what do I call you?"
Harry looked determined into Voldemort's eyes. "Even though you killed my parents and have done horrendous things, you have given me the one thing no one else has ever given me."
Hermione had finally listen to Harry and had a serious think about where she wanted her future to go, now she had a date but she refused to tell Harry who it was with. Harry had agreed to help her in the hopes of squeezing the information out of her.
"Write a quick summary of Golpalott's Third Law, the problem is I don't understand it to begin with." Harry gave a nervous chuckle.
"You don't remember me? That hurts Harry." He could hear the sarcasm in the man’s voice. “We see each other about once a year, come on your memory can't be that bad, Hermione said she told you where you were."
Harry ran off before Lucius could reply. He stood their shocked for a bit before he whispered to himself "I found something."
Harry grinned "Him and moony are catching up on lost time right now so I would say fine ...didn't want to Interrupt again, so I came to see you guys."
They all then one by one floo to the headmaster’s office. "Harry m'boy... I'm glad you’re feeling better now." They had told the old coot that Harry had become seriously injured and Hermione helped him, it wasn't a whole lie, it just happened a long time ago. "Me too sir...” Harry gestured toward Tom. “This is the person who save my life Tom Gaunt" Dumbledore frowned at the sight of Tom but didn't say anything “Well thank goodness you saved our young mister Potter, mister Gaunt...he plays a vital role in the upcoming war."
But this was not why Harry was alone with his thoughts. No it was because Ron and Ginny had ambushed Draco in a dark corridor while he was alone, just because they knew it would hurt Harry, plus they hated the blonde boy. Because of them Draco was in the hospital wing and hadn't woke up yet, he had long since been forced away from Draco's side by Madam Pomfrey, he was waiting for the matron to fall asleep so he could sneak back in. Despite what everyone told him, he blamed himself and hadn't spoken a word to anyone since he heard about Draco's attack. Harry thanked Merlin that Pansy had headed down that corridor and spotted the two Weasley's mid-torture and was able to overpower them and bring him to the Hospital Wing.
Hermione realised that Harry was serious; she gave Harry another worried look. "Voldemort, this is Riddle manor." Seeing Harry's eyes widened and his face go red she explained. " Harry he really is a nice guy, he isn't insane as Dumbledore mad us believe, he thought you were his destruction, once he learned that the prophecy was just Dumbledore manipulations, he put his soul back together and become saner then most people these days".
"Oh Harry this isn't your fault, none of this is! we all love you and I swear none of us are going anywhere, you’re stuck with us so that’s that!"
Harry began working on demonstrating the different types of shield charms and explained when it was best to use them. The group all listened and a few would send an eye roll his way on occasion but all in all the first lesson had gone off without incident, Harry was hoping each lesson would be as successful. He gave them a little reading and suggested they practice before the next meeting.
Harry smiled at the memory he felt Draco stir as he lifted his head from Harry's lap he had sleep lines down his face. Harry laughed at Draco who tried to glare but failed. "Thanks harry I needed that"
If Harry had still been drinking his potions he would have spat it out. “I’m not gay, so I don't care about what guys look like, your appearance is just a shock like I said"
They were too busy laughing and talking when they made their way through the common room to their rooms that they didn't notice the person watching by the fire.
“I am so sorry Draco, this is my entire fault, I didn't mean for you to get hurt! You were there for me when I needed it, so I'm going to stay here all night by your side"
Hermione nodded "Well after Tom said that you had a misunderstanding Draco went nuts at him, he told Tom to pretty much shove it that he followed you and not him and Tom yelled at Draco and let's just say testosterone was filling the room that night was clear they were fighting over your affection!"
Harry tried to give her the most innocent look he could without laughing "I have no idea what you’re talking about, I was effected to, I had to run down here because my dorm had the most disgusting smell and everything around me was changing into things, I witnessed Ron's underwear turning into spiders, and believe me it wasn't a pretty site!"
Harry was sitting on one of the black armchairs by the fire in the common room doing his potions essay when Tom came and sat next to him. Harry looked up briefly before going back to his work.
Harry hadn't exactly been welcomed back the night before as the left over Weasley’s had been spreading rumours since school started. Harry gestured for Hermione to follow and walked across the hall and sat next to Draco at the Slytherin table, Hermione sat on the other side of Harry, making her next to Pansy, who most to everyone's shock gave Hermione a sweet smile. "Drakey poo has told us everything, nice to have you with us Granger, you too Potter."
Harry shrugged “Actually I showed strong attributes for all the houses, so I could have been placed anywhere."
"Remus will be here soon as well, soon as he heard of your safety he declared he would break away as soon as possible." Tom informed the group.
Tom frowned "So you’re raising him like a pig for slaughter, wanting him to defeat the dark lord who possess powers Harry here has never dreamed of?"
"Oh I know, right now he is in the process of trying to confund me into making you stay in the house of the lions."
*********************************************************************************************************************
Harry had only seen people use small pieces of wandless magic, summoning a small object across the room or lighting a candle, but it made sense that everyone should be able to do it, look at all the 'accidental magic' witches and wizards do before they turn eleven. Harry himself had blown up his aunt like a balloon. Maybe it was accidental magic but it was because that witch or wizard was more Intune with their emotions at that moment, focusing on whatever was making them happy or angry maybe even scared and their magic was reacting to their will. If one could learn to control that power all the time, it wouldn’t matter if you lost your wand in battle you could still fight, hell you mightn’t need your wand at all if you could perform spells without one. Harry vowed to actually pay attention when doing the essay, this subject seemed fascinating to him, which was funny because usually Snape’s lessons were dull, that hadn’t changed over the years.
Dumbledore was giving Harry a piercing look while he waited for an answer. "It's different, the common room is a bit cooler and they really are obsessed with the colour green but apart from that it's fine better then Gryffindor even, the Slytherin's don't hate me and treat me well, the reason I haven't been showing up for meals is because I have been studying hard...don’t worry sir I grab food from the kitchens when I'm hungry."
Draco bowed his head “We have become close and he has wormed his way into my life in such as short time despite that we used to be rivals a month ago...once again I'm sorry about before I don't know what I was thinking."
After they all had defence against the dark arts. Snape gave Harry a wicked smile before spotting Tom and turning to the rest of the class "Today you will learn the patronus charm." Harry figured Snape didn’t hear about his perfect O.W.L score because of his corporeal patronus.
"Hey! Don't look at me, I wonder the same thing." Harry grinned as he laid his head on Draco's lap "You’re the one who was obsessed with me after I refused to be your friend"
He sat there reading for hours, he could see other blokes being uncomfortable but he had told Draco that he was gay weeks ago, when he told him he was scared he was going to lose his new friend but Draco had laughed and said he could tell because he was too. This had made Harry nervous was he really that obvious that he was gay. Tom and Draco had known come to think of it when he outed himself to Hermione she had said the same thing. He told Draco that he had told the dark lord he wasn't gay and Draco laughed “I bet he saw right through you".
Harry was looking at the stars from the Astronomy tower, thinking about the events that had taken place. He had finally set into place his revenge against the Dursley's, his only regret was that he would not be there to see their faces. Harry had recently found that they had known about his money all along and been taking money out of his account for years. Harry had not only been neglected and abused but he had been stolen from the people he hated the most in this world. He had contacted Gringotts and they had started the process of getting the money back, the best part was that a goblin would personally stopping by to inform them of their debt and if they couldn't pay it all back they would become Harry's personal slaves.
Voldemort’s face went red with anger; his hair seemed to stand on end, he didn’t know whether to be more insulted by the nickname or the question. "That is none of your concern, and you are but a child, people may call me a monster but I am not that kind of monster."
Ron shot a curse at a Fred who dodged just in time. Harry pointed his wand at Ron and fired back. The spell hit him and slowly he vanished.
Draco nodded "As you know we are second cousins, there are photos of us together when I was little but that was before Azkaban, mums told be story's about when they were kids apart from that I don't know much."
He began to put clothes on so he could leave the room when Harry had an idea. “Wait! Use the invisibility cloak to leave so the others don’t see you leave!”
Harry's eyebrow rose "Jealous are we?" Hermione shook his head "Of that prat? Never." she sighed "It's just I don't see much of you anymore."
Hermione got up and wrapped her arm around Harry "I can't tell you what to do this time Harry, this is all on you... But if you need someone to talk to you know I'm here and always willing to listen."
Harry smiled sadly at Draco “I know nothing about him, we never spoke about him, I was selfish and wanted to know about my dad."
Harry pointed at the other two. “Their idea, I couldn’t resist.” He said with a huge smirk. “Besides like you can talk, I couldn’t separate you to after you came back from the dead.” Causing everyone to laugh.
So that was how Harry and Sirius spent the next five hours teaching Remus how to play various muggle board and card games they played Cluedo which Harry always won, Sirius beat everyone at Uno, each won a turn at snakes and ladders and Remus won Monopoly. Harry and Remus boy refused to play twister much to Sirius's dismay. They played battleship which Remus and Harry beat Sirius at because he always put his ships in the same spot in the hope they thought it would be to obvious and stupid for him to do it again. Sirius also demanded that they play snap no matter how many times Harry refused to play, once he did convince Harry to play, he didn't take it seriously unlike Sirius who should use magic to project his voice around the room as he yelled snap.
Harry was impressed. He took notes after each duel, both so he could have a rest and so he could catalogue where the slytherins strengths and weaknesses were. They were very good and offensive magic but their defences were abysmal, it was as if once they learned the shielding charm they thought that was all they would need.
Harry knew that Tom spoke the truth he didn't know how, he just knew. “I don't agree with all your views Tom".
"It's impossible to forget you and the trouble you cause, it’s been a long while but yes." Draco smirked fixing his hair.
He reached into a basket and pulled out chocolate fondue, with banana, cherry and strawberries. "I thought since we have already had dinner in the hall desert was the best option."
Draco was released allowed to return to the Slytherin Common room that afternoon but was excused from classes for the next two days to be sure of his health. Tom and Draco had disappeared the moment he returned, the others claimed they were off to have a fight to death over Harry. Harry however knew that they were talking about the little rumour that had spread about Harry and Tom. They were simply clearing the air. (Or at least to Harry’s knowledge.)
"I'm glad to share this experience with you, then," Tom said, pleased at Harry's response. "Where would you like to go first?" Tom asked as he handed Harry the map.
Harry was beyond ready at this pointed and couldn’t speak coherently, so he nodded frantically with a moan.
Hermione had squealed like a fangirl and had immediately asked for details even though Tom was her boss and refused to listen to their denials. Neville however had simply said. “Does that mean you picked Tom?” Harry groaned and head butted the table. “I didn’t have sex with Tom, how many times do I have to tell you guys!?” It took Harry and Tom to convince the others that they had not had sex, this had left everyone disappointed. As it turns out they were betting on who Harry would lose his virginity to Tom or Draco.  They thought that the bet was finally over just to find out that Harry had literally slept together was disappointing.
Harry heard a few people mutter but they obeyed and backed up into a line against the wall and one by one they would join Harry to duel, first in line was Goyle, who surprised Harry i'm actually not being horrible.
The day passed quickly, classes were cancelled because none of the teachers could calm anyone down long enough to hold their attention, most of the Professors joined in the laughter after that, mainly because Snape and Dumbledore appeared to be the only two of the adults effected. Harry’s friend tried to get out of him what he had done but he kept quiet the only thing he said was "It's for me and the last of the maurders to know." Hermione groaned she knew that meant Remus and Sirius had something to with it, though she didn't mention anything when everyone question Harry about the maurders this would be fun. She smiled.
Tom shook his head, "No, it's just that with your reputation I thought you would want to see a Hippogriff or something."
Harry nodded sadly he had been hoping Draco could tell him something after all Harry had always spoke about James with Sirius, it had never been about him... Harry regretted that a lot.
Harry was glad to hear that the journals that he had given Tom had given him an insight to magic and during lunch Tom had managed to steal yet another breath stealing kiss from Harry.
Harry gestured to Draco and as afterthought Pansy and Blaise even though the other hadn’t said a word yet.
"I was taking my orders seriously unlike Pansy, and like it was said, Potter knows his stuff, if he's willing to teach, I'm willing to learn, I want to survive if there is to be a war after all."
Harry could tell by Tom's face he had figured it out, after all he had worked with Wormtail for some time. Tom smiled.
"Harry Potter you better have a good excuse for being late." Hermione raised an eyebrow waiting for a response.
Draco shrugged. "Yes and no, I wasn't there for the second meeting just the offer, but Father says Potter joined the cause but isn't a death eater, his friends are also given immunity."
"You said are you going to stand there all night or are you going to feed me." Draco chuckled “Now open wide."
Neville shook his head “I didn't need to, Ron was trying to stop me from talking to you... He has gone insane, don't know why you have been friends with for so long."
He offered the strawberry to Harry but when Harry tried to grab it he pulled away. Harry laughed "You are so not feeding me."
Tom pulled Harry into a kiss but this one wasn’t like the other kisses they had shared, this one was soft and full of emotion, meant to comfort not pleasure. Tom soon pulled away though leaving Harry with an aching feeling in his chest.
Tom shook his head “I can't let you go unprotected into Dumbledore's clutches, I want to keep you safe"
Harry raised his eyebrows “It’s true Harry, Voldemort is so intelligent he is such a gentleman... He has been treating me like I'm royalty" Harry laughed at the thought of Voldemort snake like kissing her hand and having dinner having arguments about a book.
Harry chuckled, "I just saw you in a very blackmail worthy position professor, and maybe it should be you showing me some respect."
Tom knew he should tell Harry what Lucius had told him earlier, right then but he wanted it to be a surprise right to the very end. Harry suddenly left the room muttering something that sounded a lot like “I need to see Drake"
Sweat dripped down Harry's face slowly, leaving dirty trails behind, his rapid breathing and beating heart were the only signs that he was distressed. His legs aching with each step as hewalked through the darkness, each step he took was as if he was wandering into a black hole. Harry wanted nothing more than for this to end, he after all wasn't living he was just surviving and to Harry that was meaningless. He stopped for a second to check on his wound, blood running down his cheats in a heavy stream. Harry cursed he knew he didn't have long.
Harry squeezed Draco tighter "Never leave me Drake, I'm begging you, the people I ever care about end up leaving me, now that you’re in my life I couldn't imagine life without you."
Harry smiled as he wrote down some final touches to the first step in his plan, ignoring the looks he was receiving form Hermione. It was sure to send Dumbledore and his cronies mad. Harry knew for sure that the order would be well aware that he was no longer located at the Dursley's. Harry had only gone back to get a few things when uncle Vernon had attacked him, however he knew the order would be looking for him regardless. Harry chuckled at the thought of their faces as the realised their 'saviour' had joined the man who they wished saving from. He was still yet to inform Tom of his plan but that was just to annoy him, Harry felt that Tom wouldn't really mind anyway as it was Harry's own right to get revenge on the bastards who had made his life the living hell he had been living for all these years.
Harry sat down on the blanket with a grin when Draco didn't move. "Are you going to stand there all night or are you going to feed me?"
The twins agreed. Despite them initiating the kiss, it was a spur of the moment thing to annoy the Weasley’s, they hadn’t considered that there were kissing Harry until after.
Harry faked hurt "What it's not bad enough that I have the big bad dark lord after me, I now have you too... And here I thought we were friends."
Harry nodded and stood up; as he reached the exit he turned back to the three in the room. "I won’t talk about what happened, but I’m not going to hear the stuff I said while under the serums influences in the rumour mill will I?" He looked between the three nervous
Harry blushed and looked away while Tom laughed, truth be told Harry had completely forgotten about their kiss since Sirius, he still wasn't sure what to think of it, so he chose to ignore it once more as out of Draco's wand came out a phoenix Harry smiled and pet its beak. “A phoenix huh? that's pretty cool."
"It’s not like I’m asking much, just don’t fight against me, I don’t expect you to be a death eater or anything I won’t be giving you missions or the like."
"You told everyone about seeing me with Draco!" he said with an eyebrow raised "Why would you do that?'
“Being stabbed by a Muggle or witch or wizard, is the same thing, let me do the same to you and see how you fare?”
Harry tried to remember how he got here but the last thing he remembered was running from the Dursley's after Vernon attacked him. Who had saved him? He didn't recognise anything around him so he couldn't be at the headquarters of the order of the Phoenix then Harry soon started to panic what of someone from the order had found him and were going to force him to fight for them. Harry scoffed there would no way he would fight he thought it was ridiculous that they put the fate of the war in a child's hands, he only just finished Hogwarts and they expected him to be able to defeat the freaking dark lord, one of the most powerful wizards since the founders of Hogwarts themselves...yeah right.
"Um sir shouldn't you sort Tom into his house now so we can all go to our dorms, we do have classes tomorrow and it is getting rather late?" Hermione spoke while Draco nodded beside her. Dumbledore looked shocked as if he forgot they were there. "Certainly, Tom m'boy here you go." Dumbledore placed the sorting hat on his head, it immediately yelled "SLYTHERIN" Tom smiled, and some things never change.
"So after dinner he took me to England's dragons reserve, and it was brilliant I got see the dragons in their natural habitat I learnt so much just by being there and he cares about all magical creatures and joined spew" Hermione continued listing all the things that happened on her date with Charlie.
"No? Well I spent the whole night worried that what happened to Draco happened to you! I spent half the night looking for you, until I saw you leaving the Astronomy Tower, I followed you all the way to the hospital wing."
"Harry are you listening to me?" Hermione asked as Harry continued to stare into empty space and of course she didn't get an answer because Harry Potter was not paying attention what so ever, he wasn't even aware of her presence, he was deep in thought and was lost to everyone in the outside world. Hermione scowled at her best friend he had been like this for the past two weeks and she still had no answer as to why, she could only guess it had something to do with Tom and Draco as he had been avoiding the two but as to why there was still no answer. He didn't even eat meals with them anymore, if he was hungry he would sneak into the kitchens, he went to bed early to avoid Draco and studied in the room of requirement to avoid Tom and Draco. He also had started flying more instead of hanging out with his friends, it happened to be one of the rare moments she was able to catch him the only thing was it was like he was auto pilot and didn't seem to engage in anything but staring into empty spaces.
Harry walked over to Tom and gave him a hug. "I can never express how thankful I am for you, bringing Sirius back...it means so much to have him back in my life."
Harry, Draco and Tom all left breakfast together, needing to go see Sirius and Remus. Of course Tom was questioned about going there the second time this morning but he had simply shrugged it off as wanting to walk Harry to classes after.
Dumbledore smiled his fake grandfatherly smile "We don't need to he will come to us, he loves this place... He will be back."
Voldemort thought about it, and then let out a wicked grin before speaking "If you choose to join me then I believe we can make an accord, I won’t make you a death eater but you could be a spy."
Tom lifted Harry's hand to his lips and left a small kiss. "It's been my pleasure Harry, I've said it once and I'll say it a million more times, anything to make you happy."
He walked toward Gryffindor tower, with a skip in his step... For once in his life he felt happy, truly happy and he didn't think anything could take this happiness away from him. Not even when Ron called him names as he entered the common room and into the boys dormitories with a huge smile on his face as he fell into a peaceful sleep… He was so glad he his family again.
Harry stared at Draco, he had never thought about that, until now. “I can apparate on Hogwarts grounds"
Draco turned to see Harry smiling brightly at the scene he just witnessed "HARRY" Draco yelled and ran straight to Harry giving him a huge hug. "Make the mean girl go away" Draco pouted playfully.
Tom got up and walk behind Harry, placing his arms on each of Harry's shoulders he bent down and nibbled on Harry's ear, causing him to shiver. “You never stand a chance against me." Harry felt Tom's breath against his ear and shivered once again, it took all his might to cover the groan that was trying to fight his way out.
The next morning before he even made it to breakfast he was summoned to see the headmaster, he sighed before stopping his entrance into the Great Hall and back up to the Headmasters office.
"I don’t know the full prophecy but the reason I can’t kill you is because I would be destroying a part of myself."
Harry's eyes widened, he didn’t want to answer, he tried not to talk but the potion wouldn’t let him stay silent either. "I just don’t care anymore, I don’t want to die but everyone seems hell-bent on putting me in the dangerous positions, my life isn’t spectacular as most people expect, its miserable so if my death happens, it happens, what’s my life compared to everyone else’s?" Harry cursed he really didn’t think Voldemort would have asked him such a personal question.
Harry looked at his watch and swore loudly, "Shit, I'm late I promised to help Hermione pick out an outfit for her date, I'll talk to you later."
Harry rolled his eyes. "There is a lot that Snape doesn’t know about me. Is there a way to remove your soul from me, without damaging it."
After lunch he had potions and this was another class Harry wish he could avoid, Slughorn had him up on some pedestal that he neither wanted nor deserved. What would the man think of Harry if he found out the so called chosen one was seriously thinking of either leaving the fray or switching sides completely? Harry almost considered telling everyone so they would leave him alone, but if he did switch he was supposed to be a spy, he couldn’t do that if he blew his cover before he had even made up his mind. Hell he would be labelled a traitor just for considering not fighting in the war, let alone thinking of switching sides so that he and his friends would be safe, could he really be that selfish?
Harry scowled at Tom "I could wipe the floor with Voldemort if I wanted to Tom, I fought him plenty of times...I'm still alive!"
Ron looked disgusted by the idea but Harry wasn't sure if he was hanging out with Slytherins or the studying part that the red head didn't like.
Draco nodded “It was only natural for you to be curious about your dad Harry, but from what mother told me he was a lot like James in personality, they were like Fred and George always in sync."
Tom’s forehead now rested on Harry’s. “While Draco and I were talking, we both agreed that you should allowed to be selfish after everything that has happened to you.”
Harry rolled his eyes at her “It was the tiniest bit ever. “And turned back to Tom, “What did you want"
“Both Weasley’s have never needed a reason to hex me before so this probably would have still happened eventually.”
Draco laughed " I'll forgive you if you be my pillow for a little while" Harry was frozen in shock, he nodded at Draco he placed his head in his lap and quickly fell asleep. Harry hadn't noticed the bags under Draco's eyes until now, he felt horrible that he hadn't noticed sooner. He declared to himself he wouldn't move and would allow for Draco to sleep for as long as needed.
"Please tell me you’re not back with him!" He gave Hermione a pleading look but he already knew what the answer was.
Tom kneeled down in front of Harry so that they were eye level. “Draco Malfoy did something that I couldn’t and that feeling doesn’t sit well with me.”
Harry hesitated for a spit second before entering the headmasters office, Dumbeldore and his twinkling eyes sat as his desk, looking at Harry knowingly as if he had seen Harrys hesitation before opening the door, Harry wouldnt have even put it past him if he did.
He ran a hand through Draco's hair absentmindedly. His hair was soft as silk and ran through his fingers like water. He smiled as Draco smiled in his sleep; it was like his small gesture of comfort drifted into his friends sleep.
Tom interrupted before Harry could say anything. "The meal was marvellous I cannot wait until the next meal you create."
Tom rose an eyebrow "You won't get any help from me, if you choose to do this again, I will personally help plan your death."
"I don't want your faggot germs anywhere near my son, you have already corrupted two of my babies!" Molly smirked as if she had something on Harry.
Harry slowly made his way to the room of requirement, his mind going back to the day in Tom's study, to the kiss, how soft Tom's lips were against his, the overpower of sensations that flooded through his body, how his legs had grown weak, how guilty he had felt when he thought of Draco, how confused he was about his feelings for both. Harry shook his head, he didn't need this right now... He was going to get his revenge on his fellow students, who had tormented him the last five years at Hogwarts, the people who couldn't make up their mind whether they loved or hated him, the people who were still tormenting him because he wouldn't fight for them, because they didn't want to fight themselves. It was another reason why Harry had left the war, why fight and die for people who wouldn’t do the same sacrifice.
Harry pretended to think about it “Well..." Draco gave Harry a hopeful look and Harry chuckled "Maybe I could take a photo of it for you?"
He sat on the bed sitting up refusing to lie down. "Who saved me? I have a right to know, I now owe them a life debt"
Harry chuckled and went back to eating while reading a book which was about the wizard and goblin war back in 1987 way more interesting than anything that came out of Professor Binn's mouth. "So before the war wizards and goblins got along they weren't just civil."
Harry's eyes widened " I have no idea what you’re talking about." he repeated the lie once more, scared out of his wits that Tom had somehow knew about the kiss that he shared with Draco.
Harry woke with a start, the door to his room opened, he pretended to sleep but peaked through slightly, it wasn't Hermione, and the person came closer to Harry. Harry's eyes immediately shut hoping the person would leave thinking he was asleep; his whole body was tense as he waited. The person sat in the chair, he seemed to be waiting for something, and Harry didn't dare to move a muscle. "Relax Harry it is simply just time for your potions."
On the way down Harry wished with all his might that Draco was going to be okay that he was going to wake up. He forced a tear as he thought about losing Draco, he shook his head, he had to think positive!
Draco quickly sorted out his appearance while Harry put on his mask; they walked down the hall hand in hand, both trying to show they would follow Harry to the end of the earth.
Draco had his mouth open wide as he stared at Harry’s godfather in shock. Harry pushed Draco’s mouth closed and muttered “Flies.” And turned to his godfather. “How did you know?” There was no point denying it if the other already knew.
Harry smiled "Please Sir, indulge me... I just want to know, there is no harm in checking is there?"
Snape handed Harry a two vials of potions. "One for the pain and the other is a calming draught, drink.." Despite not being the official potions professor Snape still brewed for his own personal stores and kept some potions handy.
It was now Saturday and he was headed down to Hogsmeade, he had promised to meet with Draco and Tom later, he was on his way to meet Luna at the Three Broomsticks, he was going to give her and Rita Skeeter an insight to his life and Dumbledore’s manipulations so by the time the trial came along Dumbledore would hold no power with anyone, Lucius had even told Harry that if all went well, Dumbledore would soon be out of the headmasters position.
He knocked on the door, when the reply for him to come in Harry could swear he stopped breathing all together, despite his nerves he still opened and entered the room, with his head help up high, heart in his chest.
Voldemort didn't speak but simply turned away, dismissing Harry. Harry left the room without saying anything more, he made his way back to his dorm slowly. Thoughts swam through his brain. How was he going to train a group of Slytherins, ones that hated him for years, but hey if he can survive a basilisk, he can teach a bunch of his peers, even ones that hate him... right?
Harry smirked at Rita. “The truth about Albus Dumbledore and he craves power and cares about nothing but his power and how to get more.”
“Jeez Hermione, the man has only been a wake for a few hours don’t bore him back to sleep.” Pansy complained.
A thousand herbs and fungi - if that didn't send him to sleep nothing will. Draco chuckled before starting. After a few pages Harry found himself growing sleepy before sleep could completely take over he managed to whisper. “I’m glad I have a friend like you Drake, I only wish I saw that you weren't a prat sooner" the last thing he heard was Draco chuckle before he fell asleep.
Harry opened his eyes “How did you know?" he knew that voice from somewhere but because of there being no light in the room he couldn't see the face of which it belonged to. Harry sat up and put his glasses back on.
“Harry so help me if you don't get in this bed right now-" he never got to finish the sentence as Harry climbed into the blankets and curled up near him. “So what are we reading?"
The day was long and Harry was exhausted he spent lunch and his free period, doing all of his homework, so he could visit Draco without consequences. This time Madam Pomfrey put up a charm to alert her if Harry returned after he was sent back to the common room.
Harry was storming down the steps when he was me by none other than Ron Weasley and his mother and father.
Harry was looking at the other three with a nervous look; he hoped they liked what he cooked. He had cooked spaghetti and meatballs, with a secret sauce he had invented himself. He ate some off his own plate as he nervously waited. Everyone stayed quite as they ate, Harry didn't know if it was a good thing they were too busy stuffing their faces to talk or a bad thing that they hadn't said anything. He served desert and still not a word was said until the table had been cleared. He stood up and was about to leave when Draco grabbed his arm.
Draco and Hermione couldn't control their laughter "Shut up you guys, it wasn't funny it was horrible...imagine walking in on your parents going at it! “Soon enough Harry was smirking at the disgusted look on their faces as both his friends minds were filled with unwanted images. "Who's laughing now" Hermione glared at Harry before returning to her work at Draco's desk. “So tell me why Hermione is working in your room Drake instead of the library"
"Out of the question, Harry Voldemort is as gay as they come; he admitted it when I questioned him". Harry was too shocked to say anything, Voldemort was gay? That sounded weirder then him courting Hermione.
He had taken to reading and training in the room of requirement, he was getting better at wandless magic and had actually researched instinctual magic, he hoped to one day master it, intrigued by how useful it would be if he did in fact master it.
"I still think he is an ass but no I was confused about the kiss anyway continue on with your story." He made a hand gesture to emphasis he wanted the rest of the tale.
Harry frowned “Surely there is someone better suited to the job, I’m not refusing, but they are likely not to listen to me because of the bad blood between us, and I am just a teen myself surely you have someone among your ranks who has more skills than me.”
Harry sent an affirmitve down the link, ot continued like that for a few minutes before Hermione started to look at Harry funny when he laughed at a comment Voldemort had made.
Harry glared at Voldemort. “I don't know what she told you Voldemort but she clearly gave you the wrong impression."
Voldemort gestured for him to speak, his face showed little emotion but Harry could see a look of hope in the Dark Lord’s eyes. Harry would indeed make a good ally if that was what he chose.
Harry shook his head interrupting Hermione "No way, it's too much fun, look I had to do it to you, so you wouldn't look like a suspects, trust me what I said was true, ours just stops, if anyone questions us we have proof it happened to us."
Neville smirked "Never said you were mate, just have a threesome and get it over with will you, it's driving everyone crazy!"
Tears were forming in Harry’s eyes as he fought himself, he didn’t want to cry. “But I’m hurting you both by not choosing, how can I claim to love you both when I cause you so much pain.”
He then looked at Ron square in the eyes glaring "Don't forget about your time in my dungeon back at the manor, I believed Draco and Tom had the most fun but I wouldn't think twice about sending you back, be thankful I let you go...they wanted you dead for what you did."
That was when George leaned down and kissed Harry passionately for a few moments before he let Fred do the same.
Hermione moved to sit next to Harry, they sat like that for hours just in silence watching after the blonde. Hermione then demanded that they get sleep, she tucked him into one of the hospital beds and then joined him. She kept him in a comfortable embrace, knowing that he was still here if Draco needed him and Hermione was there to help, he fell into a calm sleep.
*********************************************************************************************************************
Harry replied and soon laughed at the look Draco was giving him. “You talked the hat out of a sorting? That’s impossible it's never been done."
Harry went back to his seat while Snape continued his lecture on instinctual magic apparently some people were more in tuned to it than others, while some it would be a feeling of uneasiness, a sense of danger and then they could act on it, some could sense what the danger is and where and then act, for others it can be a mix of both it depends on the level of danger and on how someone is Intune with their own magic and the magic around them.
Tom turned toward Draco. “And here I thought we bonded while you were asleep but here you are with my little Raven.” This caused the Blonde to look at Tom instead of Harry.
Hermione rolled her eyes “Yeah right, as if, you two have been holding in sexual tension for years!" Harry stared at her in shock “We have not! I don't have a thing for Draco... If you must know he comforted me, I was upset...he read to me until I fell asleep." Harry's face was tomato red by the time he finished the sentence "Okay I believe you, however I still think you have a thing for each other."
"Let me guess you have no idea how to talk to the Dark Lord via the link." He had sneered at Harry, Harry had just simply nodded and without hesitation Snape began an explanation.
Draco smirked and leaned closer to Pansy and whispered "Oh I think there will be." Pansy giggled quietly.
Harry couldn't help but chuckle acting braver then he felt, his eyes never left the two men, wary of every move they made "Well you did faint but I am afraid that image will forever be stuck in both of you brains, unless these fine gentlemen do us a favour and obliviate the last twenty minutes."
Hermione began to tell Draco that she had written notes for Draco while he missed classes and what he had missed out on.
Harry chuckled as Hermione grabbed his hand and began leading him to the Gryffindor common room. "I'm glad you finally decided to kick him out of your life, you really do deserve better."
Draco grabbed a tissue from his pocket and wiped the tears away from Harry's face. “For now I know the best thing to cheer you up."
Harry yelped as he ran to meet Tom, he didn't want to be late and he would be if he didn't hurry up.
"Sure we not... Expecto Patronum" A huge silvery white stag shot out of Harry's wand, he heard the class clapping as Draco reached out a pet the stag "Its beautiful Harry"
"Maybe I can change their minds sir, maybe war doesnt have to happen... maybe they wont be any more deaths like Cedric and Sirius."
Voldemort stood. "Speak to me with our mind link, with enough practice you should master it easily enough, if you have trouble just speak to Severus or one of the Slytherin's to pass along a message."
"That's because Draco is a huge prat." Harry smiled at the offended look  on Draco's face, he looked like he was about to reply when Voldemort cast a silencing charm on both of the teens.
Tom eyes showed he was amused but his face was blank. "Oh so not in the mood for a food fight today Harry... Did I miss the fun?"
Professor McGonagall was soon behind Harry and Hermione handing them there schedules "Mr Potter, my I inquire why you are sitting here and not at the Gryffindor table."
Hermione stared at him for a while before deciding it was okay to continue. “Voldemort thought it would be easier for me to be here when you woke up so you wouldn't go crazy."
Tom smiled at Harry who couldn't shake the feeling about how weird it was to see he dark lord smiling Draco seemed to think so too as his mouth was wide open. “Careful drake, you'll catch flies"
Harry glared at Voldemort. “I don't know what she told you Voldemort but she clearly gave you the wrong impression."
Harry nodded as tears of joy began streaming down his face and there was nothing he could do to stop them, they just kept falling.
Harry had excused himself to go to bed when Tom and Draco hadn’t returned. Harry was falling asleep when he felt the bed shift as someone lay next to him. His senses told him it was Draco, he curled into Draco as the other as the other teen had placed a kiss to the top of his head. What he wasn’t expecting was for someone to curl up on the other side of his. Sandwiching him in the middle of them both but he soon recognised the other person to be Tom. Harry made a confused sound as the two cuddled him from both sides. Tom placed a kiss to the back of his head, Harry turned around to face him. His confusion clear on his face.
Harry looked for the creature and smiled once he found it, it was a pale grey serpent with glowing red eyes.
Harry rolled his eyes, scanning the group for any help, Theo shook his head "You could have warned us mate."
Hermione and Ron cornered Harry on their way back to the Gryffindor common room, demanding what the hell was going on, why he was hanging out with the Slytherins.
Harry smiled "Speaking of which he said we have to go to Hogwarts tonight, he says we have missed too much, personally I think he is worried I’m hanging out with Draco."
Harry shook his head “I couldn't sleep, I was hoping that you guys would still be to keep me company."
Harry stated that he would join them at breakfast after he had a shower, they all agreed and left without him.
Harry smiled to himself as he made his way through the streets, it had been three days since he had been with Tom and Draco and none of his friends had figured that they were all together, he thought Luna might have her suspicions but she hadn’t said anything. He knew once the others found out he would be in a lot of trouble from Hermione and Pansy for keeping it a secret but he couldn’t care at this moment, he had bigger fish to fry.
Harry complied without complaint, causing Tom to smirk. It seemed in the bedroom Harry was willing to submit. Harry began to suck on Tom hard, as Draco continued sucking Harry. Harry’s eyes never left Tom’s as he sucked the other mans fingers.
Harry had listened to Tom's advice about not avoiding him or Draco anymore so had gone to their rooms to talk to Draco. "It was a last minute thing Drake."
"Merlin Harry, I want you to cook for me for the rest of my life!" Draco gave Harry a genuine smile, Harry couldn't help but think about the saying a way to a man’s heart is through his stomach. It seemed Harry had won Draco's friendship with one simple meal.
Harry gave her an annoyed look "As if I could rest without knowing where I was, I thought the order was trying to make me fight for them again" Hermione started to shove him back into the room
Harry nodded. “That’s true but they were friends well at the very least most of them were and the Slytherin’s hate me.”
Harry was screaming profanity's at everyone at the room despite the spell being in full effect, he didn't like when people used magic to take away any of his freedom, be it by keeping him in place or taking away his ability to talk. His silent ranting soon became to much and turned into a silent panic attack, the others in the room quickly noticed the difference in the boys behaviour and removed the spell from both of the teens.
Hermione now had troubled look on her face, a battle was raging inside of her she was obviously scared of telling Harry." okay Harry promise not to lose your temper and that you will stay in bed" her eyes pleaded with Harry.
Harry had the perfect plan in place, he had contacted Lucius and had formed a plan to get the two Weasley’s a one way ticket to Azkaban by the end of the of the month, this would only hurt Dumbledore later when he stood up for them when he finds out about the trial.
Hermione realised that Harry was serious; she gave Harry another worried look. "Voldemort, this is Riddle manor." Seeing Harry's eyes widened and his face go red she explained. " Harry he really is a nice guy, he isn't insane as Dumbledore mad us believe, he thought you were his destruction, once he learned that the prophecy was just Dumbledore manipulations, he put his soul back together and become saner then most people these days".
Harry rolled his eyes "If you’re so concerned about my safety come with us I don't care but I have to do this."
"You've told me a million times Harry, it's just I don't get why my happy memories aren't powerful enough" Hermione grumbled
Hermione looked thoughtful for a moment. "The idea itself has merit but it seems way too dangerous, they could turn on you any moment it doesn't make sense for Dumbledore to tell you to do this."
Voldemort frowned at Harry's words not because Harry was in total denial but he thought saving someone life would lead them towards Harry using his real name. “It’s Tom Harry, I want you to call me Tom from now on" Harry thought about it for a few minutes but seemed to come to the conclusion that he owed the man his life. “Okay T-Tom" Harry nodded to himself.
Harry thought about it "How about I go on probation, I'll join for a month and if I still don't agree I'll go neutral" Tom nodded at Harry “if that is what it takes then I agree... Now sleep"
Harry was looking at the other three with a nervous look; he hoped they liked what he cooked. He had cooked spaghetti and meatballs, with a secret sauce he had invented himself. He ate some off his own plate as he nervously waited. Everyone stayed quite as they ate, Harry didn't know if it was a good thing they were too busy stuffing their faces to talk or a bad thing that they hadn't said anything. He served desert and still not a word was said until the table had been cleared. He stood up and was about to leave when Draco grabbed his arm.
Later on in the afternoon Harry was sitting in the Gryffindor common room talking to Hermione when Neville came up to them. "Um Harry?"
"I will see you in a weeks’ time Potter, hopefully with news that will please me, it goes without saying to not speak of any of this to anyone." Voldemort rose from his chair gracefully sending Harry a dismissive gesture.
Harry was seeing black spots, he tripped and hit his head on the pavement and there was nothing but black.
Harry laughed as Pansy went wide eyed and looked behind her only to find an empty space. She slapped his arm, "One of these days Harry, I'm going to get you."
Ron glared at Harry "Wow everyone look the second dark lord has come back, sorry if I'm not leaping for joy mum"
Smirking at Harry’s reaction to his body, Draco got on his hands and knees and held his hands on Tom’s waist as he sucked and kissed Tom’s cock, Harry, had remembered what Draco could do with his tongue was now so painfully hard he didn’t know if he could watch for much longer without losing all control. Tom kept eye contact as Draco pleasure him, his mouth was open and he was breathing heavily in pleasure but he never look away from Harry.
Molly had shrieked that he was a disgrace to wizard kind and how he had gone too far by discrediting Dumbledore. Dumbledore had nodded with Molly but not commenting, knowing it wouldn't be wise with witnesses. Basically Molly had made a fool of herself. Harry had sat there completely calm, ignoring the hag and the old coot. He just continued as they were not there, talking and laughing with his friends. When he insulted Ron and Ginny, Molly really lost it, spit went flying as she screamed, but Harry still ignored her however she still continued until she was blue in the face. Everyone was looking at her and Dumbledore, from the moment they walked, and that was how everyone found out that Harry was breaking away from Dumbledore because, he had left Harry with abusive Muggles.
Draco had given him a grateful smile before saying his goodbyes. Once Harry was alone, he let out a sigh of relief. He tried to concentrate on the link between him and the Dark Lord but soon realized he had no idea how to do it. The only times he had activated the link was when he was asleep and it was more him seeing into voldemort's mind then communicating with him, was the technique like occlumency? Harry decided he would have to pay a visit to Snape and ask and let him know the first lesson had gone well. He also wanted to ask the man if there were any more books of instinctual magic, Harry could see the advantages of mastering the technique.
"Well, well, well... Welcome little lioness to the snakes den." She smirked at Hermione as this was officially Hermione’s first visit to the Slytherin’s dorms.
They stayed there for hours if there was something he didn't quite understand, Hermione would explain it. So far he mastered spells he hadn't heard of. He even taught Hermione how to do the patronus considering it was the one spell she had trouble with she could now produce a full shield, it would take time for her to reach a corporal patronus. Harry shared some pastries he had made earlier, Hermione once again told him that he should open his own restaurant. "I'm not that good."
Harry lay awake for what seemed like hours, and he couldn't find the will to sleep. He rolled himself out of the sheets and walked up to Draco's room, where he knew Hermione and Draco would be discussing a report. He knocked on the door and was answered by a sleepy looking Draco who was just in silky silver boxers.
Harry sat up slowly every part of his body ached as if he had been hit by a train and brought back to life. He pulled up his shirt to check his wound, to find he now had a fresh scar. Harry sighed that's just what he needed another freaking scar. He swung his legs around to the side of the bed, slowing standing, and placing one foot in front of the other in a sloth like motion. Finally reaching the door he twisted the handle. In front of him was a long hallway filled with rooms. As he was about to step out from the room he was in the one opposite him opened in a rushed movement. He braced himself to be attacked as much as he could without his wand. However the person who appeared in front of him had long bushy brown hair.
Harry blushed but didn't say a word, this caused Tom to push Harry closer into the wall pinning Harry there by his wrists. "You are mine Harry and I don't like sharing" he then pushed his lips into Harry's in a hard and hot kiss that once again made his knees week and his blood flow down to his groin. When Tom pulled away he let go of one of Harry's wrists, his hand traveling down toward his erection. "See I told you enjoyed it."
It was finally Sunday and Hermione was helping him get ready while telling him every detail of her date with Charlie, Harry was happy for his friend, he thought it was about time she found her happiness.
Harry entered the room to find all the Slytherin's already inside, They were standing around in various groups, the room looked very similar to the Slytherin Common room but with an empty space for said training to take place.
Tom kissed Harry again, this time pushing harry back onto the bed as he poured every emotion he felt for the teen into the kiss, and Harry returned the kiss with the same amount of emotion. The kiss lasted a few minutes before they pulled away. Harry later fell asleep lying on Tom’s chest, listening to his heartbeat.
“Well he wrote to me after your confrontation with the others, he wanted you to know that he had nothing to with what they had done, at first I didn’t trust him and we just talked, he wanted to prove that he was a good guy.” She smiled “He seemed to prove it to me, but until now I was worried that it might have been a trick to get close to you but if the twins trust him then it must be true.”
Harry turned to his group of friends and winked. Dumbledore stood and placed the hat on Harry's head, everyone was watching in silence, no one moved or made a sound as they watched and waited..
Harry was put off by the fact that Voldemort would offer his hand to shake to anyone but took it and gave it a quick shake before letting go.
"That isn't the point." Tom flicked his wand at the pile of journals and they disappeared before he left he turned to Harry "Be ready in fifteen, we all will floo straight into the old coots office its best not to keep the old fart waiting." Harry nodded he would give Sirius and Remus his cloak so they could sneak in through the honeydukes passage way.
"Hermione what happens when someone else gets hurt or worse killed because of me, I have lost too much already, I can’t lose anyone else! I couldn't bare it if I did!"
Draco laughed " I'll forgive you if you be my pillow for a little while" Harry was frozen in shock, he nodded at Draco he placed his head in his lap and quickly fell asleep. Harry hadn't noticed the bags under Draco's eyes until now, he felt horrible that he hadn't noticed sooner. He declared to himself he wouldn't move and would allow for Draco to sleep for as long as needed.
They all sat there talking for a while before Madam Pomfrey kicked them out for dinner, telling them that visiting time was over.
"Shit" Draco pushed aside all ill feelings for Harry for the moment and rushed to the other teens side he kneeled in front of Harry so they were face to face but gave the other plenty of space so he didn't freak the other out even more.
"I swear to god Draco Malfoy if you sigh one more time, I'll curse your hair permanently pink!" Draco's hand immediately went to his hair, covering it protectively, Hermione smirked widely. "Whoops might have done it already."
Harry sighed "The memory you choose has to fill you up with happiness to the point you can channel it through your wand."
Hermione was angry now " I know a real memory when I see one Harry! They don't call be the brightest which of my age for nothing!"
"Dumbledore, fudge, Umbridge, Mad Eye, Rita Skeeter, the Dursley’s, if you let me Bellatrix...and well the whole wizarding world."
Harry walked to the great hall with his friends with a new spring in his step, the colour seemed to return to his cheeks and a permanent smile was glued to his face. He was also walking hand in hand with Tom, who wouldn’t let go since they left the hospital wing. Harry didn’t mind though, despite being in his funk for the past couple of weeks and being too worried about Draco, he had missed the big bad dark lord. Who he sat next to at dinner, as he laughed with his friends, a weight had been lifted off his shoulders the moment Draco had awoken. He would get revenge on those who hurt his friend. Being expelled simply wasn’t enough; he would be contacting Lucius before the week was up. They had planning to do after all. They would not be allowed to get away with this.
"Oh Merlin, two speakers in one day! I'm so lucky, it's I who has the pleasure of meeting you Tom and Harry, my name is Thanos."
"Ron looked at Harry Dumbfounded. "Harry just a few months ago Malfoy vowed to make you pay for his father's trip to Azkaban, he is the son of a Death Eater he cannot be trusted."
"Look Potter, I know we are not friends, hell we don't like each other but I need you breath with me, just this once I am going to help you okay?"
Hermione was leaning on the wall opposite the portrait; her arms were crossed as she glared at Harry as he appeared.
Draco's mouth was once again agape "Flies, Draco flies". Draco closed his mouth only to open it again. “You seem to make the impossible happen Harry; you would have to be of all the founders blood to have done that."
Arthur pulled his wife and son behind him "We treated you like a son and this is how you repay us...by torturing my son?"
“Merlin Harry, you look so beautiful like this.” Tom whispered seductively in his ear. Harry shivered at Tom’s words. He couldn’t help but think what he must look like, his legs wide open and moaning after only small touches. He arched his back and let out another moan as he felt Tom’s lips on his nipples.
Harry had even had a couple of study sessions down by the lake like he had promised Draco he would be. Sometimes the sessions were not even for Defence, sometimes they were for transfiguration or charms. Draco had even helped Harry with one of the potion questions Slughorn had assigned.
Harry's grin widened. "No! This is wonderful! I did go to a muggle zoo once but I didn't really get to enjoy it. And I've never been to magical zoo."
He had one more step left before he was free but Snape being Snape had been aware of his every move spoke before he could take it. "Not so fast Potter...”
Harry rolled his eyes, he couldn't get Pansy to stop calling him that. "I wouldn't say that Tom's right behind you."
Harry pulled out a chair in between Hermione and Draco. “Yup I believe you one hundred percent" Harry's voice was laced with sarcasm causing Tom to scowl at the laughing teens before returning to his paperwork. Harry leaned closer to Draco “Why didn't you wake me"
Draco nodded "Oh I see a misunderstanding...what the fuck a misunderstanding would not mean he would lock himself in his room now tell me right now what bloody happened!"
Tom stared wide eyed at Draco in disbelief as said blondes face turned bright red, Tom never thought that the two teenagers had been spending that much time together to even develop such feelings, he glared at Draco, he had a rival for Harry's heart it seemed. He quickly composed himself once he noticed he was being watched by Hermione.
They spent the rest of the evening the usual Gryffindor way on a Friday, loud music and fun. Of course this ended at curfew due to Prefect Hermione demanding it was time for bed, usually they would ignore her but tonight Hermione had threatened everyone with a weeks detention if they didn't go to their dorms, apparently she wanted to do some studying and the noise was disruptive.
"Draco shook his head. "I'm not allowed to go into detail what happened, but Potter seemed intrigued by the idea of a peaceful end rather than a war, keeping the people he cares about safe is part of it, but I get the feeling there is more to it then that."
Harry groaned "That's not the worst of it either, they both buy random things they think I need and like, just yesterday Draco bought me another house elf, I guess he forgot I already have one and Tom he bought me a harp... I don't even play the harp! What the hell am I supposed to do with a freaking harp!"
"Not to mention Draco sucking up to Potter's arse, what was that all about? Blaise asked the blonde.
Harry rolled his eyes while Dumbledore wasn't looking, Tom's blood was boiling at Dumbledore's words, he wanted to kill the man right then and there but contained himself as he knew Harry wanted to be the one to get revenge on the old man.
They walked down to breakfast together, once they met up with friends they noticed that the talk of the hall was the attack on Draco and how Ron and Ginny where expelled. Harry wasn't that hungry but Pansy made him eat two pieces of toast and a cup of coffee.
The blonde gently reached for Harry’s hand placing it on his own chest. "Copy my breaths, one, and two..." He continued to count his breaths as Harry tried to do what was asked. His breathing was still uneven but was slowly slowing down.
" I heard you talking to him, I was about to go and comfort you but Hermione was there and I thought she would be better suited in the moment so I went back here and waited for you but you didn't come back... Harry I was so worried, if something were to happen to you I don't know what I would do..."
It had scared Harry how close the two girls had gotten over the last couple of weeks, he was glad of course but between Pansy and Hermione they could bring down anyone.
Harry woke the next morning, he called for Sirius in the twin mirror he had given him to make sure that Remus and Sirius arrived at the room of requirement, when they both looked dishevelled and stated quickly that they were fine and disappeared. Harry fake vomited to Hermione who smiled. They were still at it like rabbits. Harry shivered at the thought.
"Yes I better be included in this to Harry." Harry turned to see Draco bowing at Tom. Harry rolled his eyes “Looks like I'm cooking for four".
Draco’s mouth was immediately on Harry’s; he slipped one hand up the front of Harry’s shirt and began to trace patterns across Harry’s skin. Tom was pressed against Harry from behind, sucking and biting at the sensitive part of his neck. Harry’s eyes rolled back as he closed his eyes and let out a low moan. ‘why did I wait this long to do this again’ he couldn’t help but think. Harry pulled Draco closer, his hands tangled in his hair, deepening the kiss. The three of them somehow managed to move to one of the beds in the room and landed in a tangled mess. Draco reached over and began undressing both Tom hand Harry. Nipping and kissing both their chests once free from the shirts. Tom finally released the bruised flesh from from his mouth, Harry moved to kiss him just as passionately as he had kissed Draco. Exploring his mouth always felt this good. They both kissed in different ways but Harry found them highly intoxicating and was equally growing addicted to both.
Harry had laughed. Draco had also taken Harry and Hermione shopping and brought them proper wizard attire as he put it. Harry had even managed to convince him to let them buy a few pairs of muggle clothes as well; even Draco had brought some for himself.
At first Harry thought Draco was been a prat by asking the question but the look on his face showed he really want to know the answer. “Is treacle tart is your favourite dessert?" Draco nodded “How about this ill cook you dinner and treacle tart and you can answer that question."
Harry spoke to Rita and Luna for over two hours, both asking questions, which Harry answered freely, Rita was ecstatic. “Oh Harry, I have so much here that I can’t possibly write only one edition, I have them weekly, leaving the readers itching for the next one each time!”
McGonagall smiled "That's great Mr Potter, house unity is something we have strived for years to achieve, but I was under the impression you and Mr Malfoy…well hated each other?"
Once they got their drinks it was straight to business. Rita had her quill and notepad, not using her quick quotes quill, knowing better then to use it while interviewing Harry ever again. “So Harry why don’t you tell me why you have asked to see me today?”
Tom smiled "You’re very welcome, it will protect you from nearly every curse, it will warn you if any of your food is dosed, plus it is an emergency portkey, say portkey in parsletongue and it will transport you to where ever it is you think of first."
Harry didn't question the order and downed the potions quickly, he figured at least if they were poisoned this nightmare would finally be over. The others looked at the young teen in shock, they had expected Harry to throw the vials across the room father then drink something the dungeon bat had given him. It made them all ask themselves if the other had a death wish after all.
Harry lay in his room by himself smiling, Remus had just told him that he and Sirius would be able to join him at Hogwarts after all, they would stay in the room of requirement so to be near Harry whenever he need them. Harry's was so thankful to Tom for bringing his godfather back, he wanted to give something back in return. Sirius had given Harry the best thing too, Harry was a descendent from Merlin himself and contained journals written by the wizard. Harry had Remus collect them...he was going to give them to Tom, he was waiting for the man right now in fact as Harry sat up there was a knock on the door. 'Good timing' Harry thought.
Harry rolled his eyes but walked and sat in the students chair, a complete opposite of last time as well. He hadn’t made eye contact instead he looked past the man in front of him.
The only person from their little group who hadn't performed the charm properly yet was surprisingly Hermione all she had been able to conjure was the shield, even with Harry’s help over the summer she still hadn’t succeeded with a corporeal patronus. Harry had to remind her at lunch that others hadn't even gotten that far that all she had to do was find a stronger memory and she would have the charm done. "Seriously Hermione it took me three weeks to get where you’re at, and even longer to produce a stag.”
Hermione nodded "Oh I'm in, see you later Harry, I have to pay our old friend a visit and finish a report"
"I don't hate you Drake, thank you for earlier by the way... What you said it made me so happy, I'm glad I have people like you and Nev in my life." Harry gave the blonde a bright smile.
Before he left he turned back to face her " I can't keep watching you get hurt Hermione, I just can't, you’re a strong beautiful independent woman which clearly Victor can’t see, he isn’t the only one out there. I know this, you deserve better and I wish you did too." He then left her with tears strolling down her face, no matter how guilty he felt for it, he didn't turn back...it was something he had to do.
Harry grabbed the paper from Hermione and ran off laughing, she screamed after him but it was too late he was gone. He ran to the kitchen where of course where Draco was. Harry covered Draco's eyes from behind and put on the most girly voice he could. “Guess who Drakey poo?" he heard Draco laugh and it wasn't a forced laugh either.
Dumbledore nodded "yes, sorry to pull you away from breakfast but a numbet of teachers have reported that you have been spotted with a few Slytherins these past few weeks... I cant help but be concerned."
Draco took Harry's mind off Sirius as the grabbed some chocolate slice and ate it. They laughed at Ron's torture. Draco was mid-sentence when Harry pokes his finger in the icing and wiped it off on Draco's nose it was so random they were both in shock... Draco stared at him in horror before placing his whole hand in the icing a smudging it over Harry's face. Soon the two were having an icing war. It only ending when Draco freaked about having it in his hear and not his mouth. They were in a fit of laughter as they looked at each other’s chocolate covered selves. Draco had chocolate streaks in his hair, half his face was covered not to mention his clothes. Harry hair was in spikes thanks to the chocolate, and his face was completely covered, lucky for him none of it made it on his clothes apart from on his collar.
Soon enough Hermione had decided on a simple black jeans and a white button up shirt. She tossed them over with his black converse.
"YOU’RE A FUCKING FAGGOT AS WELL AS TRAITOR... I SLEPT IN THE SAME ROOM AS YOU" Ron had a plain look of horror on his face.
Dumbledore gave Harry a look that said he didn't quite believe him but quickly smiled. "Harry I would like you to reconsider your involvement in the war."
Tom reached for Harry's hand, pulling it towards him, causing a line to go through the parchment because he was currently in the middle of writing a sentence.
They smirked, it was starting already. “Actually technically, she is not our mother, so we can talk to her however we want to... Arthur"
Harry gave the other a sheepish look, “Sorry I’m just glad that Draco is going to be okay, I’m relieved that he doesn’t hate me.”
Tom put his hand on Harry's shoulder “This young man here is my newest recruit" whispers could be heard but were quickly silenced by Tom's glare. "Reveal yourself" Harry slowly lifted the mask from his face. His hand shaking as he dropped it to give everyone a look at his face. There was gasps and then silence, no one dared to speak... They were in shock." Harry Potter is to be my equal and will not bare my mark as he already wears one". Harry stood in shock he hadn't expected that. “If any harm is laid onto Harry from anyone you will die by my hand... Any objections?" If there was no one dare to move anyway. Harry smirked “I look forward to working with you; I have a feeling I'm going to have a lot of fun here" He gestured to Hermione and Draco to join them. "My lord can I have them as my most trusted". Tom nodded “Come on Mione, Drake.. We have evil plotting to do" Dragging the two surprised teenagers behind him.
Harry thought about it "How about I go on probation, I'll join for a month and if I still don't agree I'll go neutral" Tom nodded at Harry “if that is what it takes then I agree... Now sleep"
Draco nodded. “Yeah it seems he was just as worried as you.” Draco shrugged. “Though it might have been his was worried that this might set you back… which it seems it did, Harry this wasn’t your fault.”
Silence, the awkward kind. The kind that leaves you shifting from foot to foot and avoiding eye contact at all costs, while also giving you a sick feeling in your stomach and maybe you start to sweat. That was the kind of tension that Harry now found himself stuck in. Earlier that very same day Harry had received an unfair detention along with Malfoy which lead to the most awkward and frightening moment of his life. He was currently standing in Snape's office, he had entered arguing with Draco and had come across a very normal Dark Lord and his professor in a very shocking position, Snape's was on his desk with a  leg still hooked around Voldemort's back and the dark lord was still leaning over their potions master. All to afraid to move or speak, he feared what might happen next.
"Potions with Harry here." Draco reached over and ruffled Harry's hair "Be warned though, Harry sucks at potions."
"You could have warned me, I didn't have time to do my hair" Draco grumbled, Harry looked at Draco's not slicked back hair and smiled, it had given him a sexy dishevelled look "Don't worry Dray, you look sexy as always."
Once Snape returned he handed the vial to the teen who took a mouthful without hesitation once again causing the others to wonder once again what was wrong with the boy.
Remus and Sirius pulled Harry into a bear hug. “Three weeks, we have been stuck in here worried sick about you and you didn’t so much as use the mirror.” Sirius scolded.
"My house mates are not pleased with my movement from the war, they believe I should die fighting... I’m sick of being stood on so I joined my friends here."
Harry looked at Hermione as if she was Insane” Hermione this is the man who killed my parents!" Hermione shook her head eyes watering
"Well of course he has survived the Dark Lord hunting him, that's gotta take some skill, he is the only one to survive after all." Pansy replied.
"So you want me to obey your orders or you will kill me anyway?" Harry glared at Voldemort "As for locking me up you can forget it, I have had enough of that in my life."
"Yes, wizards deemed them more worthy of the power of magic and didn't like that goblins could do things we can't even dream of...hell most wizards are still like this and it's because they are scared."
Harry nodded “I’m lord Potter Black, I accepted the Potter one to adopt them and I signed the Black after Sirius, you know….." Harry gave Draco a sad look.
Tom smiled at Harry " I have no reason to want you dead anymore Harry, actually I was hoping you would join me... I heard you will no longer fight for the light."
“I may have scared you Harry but Tom didn’t spare me any details about you, this whole time I have been worried about you but I couldn’t find a way to wake up for some reason.”
Over the next couple of days Draco came over, the three teenagers were practically inseparable; Draco had decorated Harry's room with black leather couches, a king size bed with silky sliver sheets, a fancy chandler, posters of the England Quidditch team. He charmed the walls a sapphire blue which surprised Harry at first but when he asked Draco he said "My rooms green they can't be identical"
Before Harry could say anything, Hermione had him in a bone crushing hug. "Oh Harry, thank Merlin you’re okay". Before Harry could complain she spoke “Harry what are you doing out of bed, you shouldn’t be walking around, in your condition”
"We had a misunderstanding." They both spoke in harmony once more, causing them to look at each other in confusion.
Draco smiled brightly at Harry before kissing Harry passionately, Harry returned the kiss with a moan. Tom for once didn’t feel jealous but thought the scene was kind of hot as he watched the raven haired teen grind against Draco. He leaned toward Harry to nibble at Harry’s ear causing Harry to gasp. Much to Draco and Tom’s dismay Harry soon gathered the will to stop.
Harry shook his head. “You never will, just like you couldn’t replace Draco, he couldn’t replace you… That’s why I’m so confused, I’m being selfish but I don’t want to let go of either of you, it’s nice to be loved and not hated for once.”
The walk to Tom's meeting point was a long one drawn out by silence. When they arrived Hermione and Draco went and joined there spot in the meeting and Harry stood next to Tom like he was told he had to do. He had the eyes of a hundred death eaters giving him daggers as he stood there with his head held high like Draco taught him. He acted as if the people in front of him were nothing. When he found Hermione and Draco he focused on them. He didn't really hear the meeting, just kept himself focused on his two friends, trying not to show how scared he was to be there.
"What the devil are you two doing here, female and male students have separate dormitories for a reason, I will not have you defiling my wing as a secret rendezvous, this is a hospital not a sleazy motel!"
Harry looked at his best friend, who had a shit eating grin on his face as the Dean hit him upside the head and said something that Harry could not hear but it had the red head teen laughing.
Harry willed himself to lie to say anything but the truth but instead of any lie the truth came out. "4 Privet Drive, Surrey."
Harry knew he would have to explain eventually, the deal was his friends would not fight in the war. Maybe if he could get them all to get along first he could sway his friends
The rest of the lesson was the other practicing finding a happy memory and trying to perform the patronus, Harry sat and watch Tom actually succeed in performing his own patronus in the form of a snake Harry watched as he it came and wrapped around his shoulders, it felt warm and made Harry feel really happy all of a sudden. He chuckled at Tom "I'm surprised you’re able to perform this charm Tom, what's your happiest memory?"
Harry gave her an annoyed look "As if I could rest without knowing where I was, I thought the order was trying to make me fight for them again" Hermione started to shove him back into the room
Draco nodded. "I have seen him interact with the Dark Lord, he has no regard for his own safety, it's almost like he is afraid of nothing."
By now the group had reached the teachers table, everyone was staring at only Harry as Harry walked straight in front of Dumbledore and smiled his innocent smile. "Harry m'boy what can I do for you?"
Harry was painfully hard as were the other two but he was still confused and wanted answers. His mind was a little foggy but was determined not to give in despite Tom’s wandering hands.
"Harry you will be fine" Draco smiled at Harry “Honestly I thought Gryffindor's were supposed to be brave"
The Slytherins had made great progress which showed in each of their meetings Harry wad quite impressed both with them and himself for being able to yet again help a group of people learn.
Tom chuckled "Well we mustn't keep you for very much longer, or else we will have the wrath of Granger to deal with."
He met Tom at the entrance hall; Tom had been standing around waiting for him, with all these girls standing around giggling from afar as they watched him. Harry had wondered why they didn't just meet at the common room and he now knew why.
Tom nodded agreeing with Draco. “The same applies with us Harry, I may not feel the same with Draco as I do with you but he isn’t unattractive and we have respect for each other after talking all this time, it might develop into more but it might not but we are willing to do this for you.”
So pleasing in fact they left Hogsmeade early so that no one would be in the castle when they returned, Harry had made plans to get them back in his bed after all, after a few words spoken it wasn’t very hard, nothing was holding them back
He had been surprised however when Harry had mentioned his interest in instinctual magic. He had told Harry that while he had planned to go further into the subject during class, extra reading wouldn't hurt and had given Harry a list of books that he could find. One was in the restricted section and he had given Harry written permission to check it out much to the teens suprise.Snape had just sneered that it was about time that the raven haired teen had taken an interest in his studies and to leave the office before he took points from Gryffindor. Before Harry had left the room he told the teen he would inform the Dark Lord how the meeting with the Slytherins had gone before turning his back dismissing the teen.
“Draco has a place in your heart that I cannot hope to replace, just like I know that I too hold a place, it’s an honour to have a place in your heart after all the horrible things I have done to you in the past, and I don’t want to lose my place.”
Hermione smiled “Ok since you were doing your work, but come on you have to help me it's my fist date since Victor!"
Tom rose an eyebrow "Don't worry Harry, that won't happen this year Snape is teaching Defence against the dark arts, I want to see improvement, or no cooking for you!"
Tom smiled at Harry " I have no reason to want you dead anymore Harry, actually I was hoping you would join me... I heard you will no longer fight for the light."
Blaise rolled his eyes. "You have to be nice to Potter then, he might curse you before then, if you make comments like you did at the start of today's meeting."
Classes were uneventful and boring in Harry’s opinion, he wished that he had been able to convince Tom to letting him have they day off after all. It had been about halfway through the day when Harry tried to seduce him into letting him have the rest of the day off, his wish however wasn’t granted Tom had laughed and said. “Tempting though as your offer is, you can’t afford to have the day off with Dumbledore watching our every move.” Harry realizing that Tom was right had pouted for the rest of the day, but his mind was never on classes it was on a plan to get rid of Dumbledore and then getting his lovers back into the same bed.
"Remember that we are all here for you Harry, we wouldn't be standing next to you side by side, if we didn't want to be there, you mean the world to us, you were my first friend, I'm sticking with you until the very end and even longer."
Draco nodded "Harry gave us all a second chance even when we treated him like hell, we will stand by him no matter what, and we are his true friends!"
Harry grinned up at Draco "It’s okay Dray, your secret obsession with the Gryffindor golden boy is our little secret."
Draco sat up confused. “I’m more than willing to help you with anything Harry. I have grown to love you Harry Potter, you should know that by our feelings that feelings can change quickly we became quick friends within days when we used to be enemies.”
'Its not my fault they kept coming up to me with questions, when I said they could I didnt think they would come in a group.' Harry snapped.
Harry rolled his eyes but chose to ignore her, instead he addressed the room as a whole in his teacher's voice he had found the year before. "Look, we have had our issues in the past, but if you are not going to get over it and take these lessons seriously, What was the point in coming. I have been asked to teach you, if you choose to be petty and not take your lord's orders to heart, you might as well leave now and face his wrath because I will be reporting to him. We are on the same side now like it or not, you can take it up with Voldemort himself if you think you will survive the encounter, I'm not here to waste time. Now form a line, let's see if anyone can best me in a duel."
“Yup every time… I even heard you yell at Pomfrey about being gay.” Draco smirked causing Harry’s blush to darken.
Harry could tell the other was feeling rather jealous and gave Tom a small smile. “Wouldn’t want to ruin your big bad dark lord reputation, you cannot be seen cuddling the chosen one.”
Tom saw the tears that managed to escape run down Harry's cheeks despite the fact Harry tried to hide it.
Harry woke with a start, the door to his room opened, he pretended to sleep but peaked through slightly, it wasn't Hermione, and the person came closer to Harry. Harry's eyes immediately shut hoping the person would leave thinking he was asleep; his whole body was tense as he waited. The person sat in the chair, he seemed to be waiting for something, and Harry didn't dare to move a muscle. "Relax Harry it is simply just time for your potions."
"Madam as beautiful Hermione is and that any guy is lucky to have her, she is my best friend and I would never date her, she is my sister in everything but blood."
"Harry snuck down here last night because he was worried about Draco, I knew he would come back so I waited, he refused to leave his side so I compromised and made him sleep here, I didn't want to leave him so I stayed with him."
"Only because I am the one who will end all of this.. maybe you should focus on helping everyone... not just those you deem worthy."
Voldemort wouldn't admit that he held his breath as he waited for the teen in front of him to finish his sentence. He wouldn't admit that he had been pacing around the manor all week, thinking about the fact that Harry was considering changing his stance in the war, trying to not even think about how he might have to destroy a part of his soul if Harry chose to fight against him after all or that the wizarding Britain would be handed to him on a silver platter if the boy chose to side with him. He knew deep in his bones that Harry would not go neutral, only for the sake of his friends, he would change sides for his friends safety or he would fight with them. However the few seconds Harry took in pausing his sentence made Voldemort regret not just taking the boy and locking him up in the highest tower, only with zero chances of anyone finding him unlike the muggle story with the girl with the long hair.
Hermione smiled lightly she could never stay mad at Harry for very long “I’ll forgive you this time"
Harry closed his eyes in frustration and let out a sigh, he knew his chances were slim but he had hoped. The two men had yet to face Harry, there attention appeared to be on Draco, since it looked like Harry wasn't getting out of this weird situation anytime soon he walked around the room, until reached the Professors chair he muttered cleaning spells on the chair and desk before sitting down and leaning back and closing his eyes, despite the fact that he knew he was in a very dangerous situation with the dark lord not a two meters away from him he couldn't help but let all the tension drain from his body as he sunk into the chair, the last few days of training taking a toll on his body, the lack of sleep hadn't helped either.
Remus walked behind the two to Hogsmeade before apparating the two to the front gates before letting them know he would be back to collect them later.
Harry met with an angry Draco, “You left with without me, then you transfer the weasel here and I have to put up with his yelling"
Draco hadn't seen Harry in days, in fact no one but Remus and Sirius had. Everyone had left the three alone so they can catch up and get up to mischief. They had even sent letters to Dumbledork to explain why they would be arriving at Hogwarts a week late. Tom thought it would be nice to give Harry time before he would have to part ways.
Harry nodded for Hermione to continue. "Well Draco was really worried when you didn't come down to dinner when he voiced his concerns Tom told him something happened between you-"
"I just think he will be a big part of making history, changing things for the better, with him and the Dark Lord as allies the world is the limit."
Harry spent the next few hours with his friends, him and Hermione still hadn’t spoken about their argument, with so much going on it had taken a back seat but both knew that they would need to talk eventually.
Harry shook his head at the Tom Riddle looking Voldemort. "It's just your appearance came as a shock, you’re not a snake mutant anymore"
Harry tried to get away "I'm not property Tom. You don't own me, I'm a person, your equal...and yes I enjoyed the kiss, you’re an excellent snogger Tom you could snog a perfectly straight man and they would be turned on by it but that's not the point, I also have feelings for someone else and I'm confused I'm unsure what I want right now."
True to his word Draco helped Harry every time he was about to make a mistake, Slughorn couldn't find anything wrong with his potion by the end. Harry turned around to once again poke his tongue out at Tom. Tom rose an eyebrow and mouthed 'childish' Harry's shook his head a grinned when he was awarded twenty points to Gryffindor for his perfect potion. Hermione also gained twenty points, she sat there with a huge smile in her face.
Now everyone was staring at the trio mouth agape, never had Tom and Draco been like this especially when it involved Harry, they were usually rather hostile when it came to Harry’s attention. What was weirder was that beside the giant blush creeping onto Harry’s cheeks, Harry had shown no reaction. Usually if either Tom or Draco had done something like this in front of the other Harry would scold them but for them both to do it and for Harry not to care was just creeping the others out.
Draco grabbed Harry's hand as they walked. "It's not, not yet anyway... I promise to let you know if it becomes too much."
Hermione was staring at the three of the intently. “Tom usually waits for Harry as well. But today he arrived after Draco.”
Draco soon couldn't hold in the shock of seeing his godfather in such a compromising position, he fainted. Harry's 'saving people thing' was the cause of the silence to end, as he summoned a pillow for Draco so his head wouldn't hit the hard tiled floor. It caused the two adults to jump into action by finally separating and move to the blonde’s side to make sure that the boy was indeed fine. Harry was now taking the opportunity to take a few steps backward and to the door, maybe Snape would let him off detention? Harry was currently just hoping this was all just some very twisted nightmare, one that he never wanted o think about again.
Draco’s arms tightened around Harry as he spoke. “We had plenty of time to talk when I was unconscious. It started off with us arguing over who was best for you but we soon actually began talking to each other.”
The hat chuckled "Of course I am, and it's about time too... Took you long enough to realise it, I have been waiting for years to say this to you."
Pulling back breathless, the younger boy slipped his hand down Tom’s chest teasingly before it reached his naval. Harry wasted no time removing Tom from his pants and underwear and the favor was returned with hastiness. Tom gave Harry a feral grin, while pulling Draco to him and reliving the blonde from his clothes as well. Giving Harry a show he took Draco’s shirt off one button at a time, them his trousers were painfully slow to be removed. Draco’s boxers were soon removed leaving Harry in view of his most desired object.
Draco and Harry met for a messy kiss but it was a pleasant sensation as tongues met and teeth clashed. Tom’s hands began roaming Harry’s body, Harry moaned he wanted this, he
Harry smirked "maybe I am or maybe he has just rubbed off on me, either way you say it like it’s a bad thing… being bad has its perks after all."
"I have gained the ministry's approval to take you to London's magical creatures zoo, of course with both of us being students-" he winked at Harry "we needed an escort and Remus here offered to escort us there and back again."
Beside Tom stood Remus and Harry was really confused but continued to walk over to Tom. Tom wrapped his arm around Harry's waist.
Draco's eyes widened as he swallowed the cake he looked between the cake and Harry. “Merlin that was amazing, I have never had better... Potter, can you cook treacle tart or is it only cakes that you can cook?"
As they were coming out of the dorm and into the common room they ran into Pansy who spotted Hermione first.
Tom put his hand on Harry's shoulder “This young man here is my newest recruit" whispers could be heard but were quickly silenced by Tom's glare. "Reveal yourself" Harry slowly lifted the mask from his face. His hand shaking as he dropped it to give everyone a look at his face. There was gasps and then silence, no one dared to speak... They were in shock." Harry Potter is to be my equal and will not bare my mark as he already wears one". Harry stood in shock he hadn't expected that. “If any harm is laid onto Harry from anyone you will die by my hand... Any objections?" If there was no one dare to move anyway. Harry smirked “I look forward to working with you; I have a feeling I'm going to have a lot of fun here" He gestured to Hermione and Draco to join them. "My lord can I have them as my most trusted". Tom nodded “Come on Mione, Drake.. We have evil plotting to do" Dragging the two surprised teenagers behind him.
Harry indicated that he was ready for the questions to begin. Voldemort sat in the chair opposite harry despite that the fact it was supposed to be where the student sits. "What is your full name? “Voldemort asked
Draco scoffed "Only the most legendary pranksters to walk these halls, no one knows who they are only that they attended Hogwarts 1971-1978 and that they were Gryffindor’s!”
“The death eaters would get confused if you and Tom both are the Dark Lord, you have to be something different but Prince wouldn’t be equal to Tom.”
Voldemort smirked at Harry "Do not insult my intelligence Harry, I know when people are checking me out, plus me and Hermione have been talking I know everything."
Tom nodded his agreement squeezing Harry's hand, causing Harry to realise that he had never let go, there was a new addition, around his wrist was a silver charm bracelet. It had a total of four charms, one was a serpent with emerald eyes, another was a lion with ruby eyes, the third was a badger with amber eyes and last was an eagle with sapphire eyes. Harry looked at the bracelet with amazement, it represented all four houses. He looked up at Tom and smiled.
"I'm just a concerned friend, Harry's had a rough couple of days" Draco blushed. "He still blames himself for Sirius's death."
Tom interrupted before Harry could say anything. "The meal was marvellous I cannot wait until the next meal you create."
Harry lent back further in the chair. "However the chances of my survival is always low so maybe I won’t have to live with the memory for much longer.."
Harry was seeing black spots, he tripped and hit his head on the pavement and there was nothing but black.
"Harry never did, he stood up for me when no one else would and the others may have treated me badly but they have made up for it, you always treated me like someone lower then you... You saw me as a nobody someone who always needed help...Harry believed in me... He's a better man then you ever will."
"They may have been Gryffindor’s but they were legends, they should have been in Slytherin with the way they acted" Blaise stated.
"Your father found a way to bring him back, I saw to it that it happened" Tom said suddenly behind him.
Harry had tried to bandage up the wound but nothing could stop the blood flow, his only mission right now was to get as far away from the Dursley's as he could because there was no way he was going to be at peace with them anywhere near him when he died. Harry's head had begun to spin, he knew he had only minutes to live; he was losing too much blood to survive more than an hour. Harry only had one regret was that he hadn't done more with his life and that he wouldn't be able to say any words of comfort to Hermione about his death. Hermione was the only one he was sad to be leaving behind, she had always been there for him when he needed it, she hadn't cared when Harry had chosen not to fight for the light, and she had understood and sided with Harry. Dumbledore had manipulated Harry's every move and they had both decided that they weren't going to be puppets anymore. The light had disowned them, the Weasley’s labelled them traitors.. Even Ron hated them now.
Voldemort eyebrows rose as he stared at Harry, his former enemy was laying I front of him, he saved his life and all he had to say was that he had hair. “Really that's all you have to say."
Harry shook his head. “Not at all but remember what we found out yesterday? About the bet they have about my sex life?”
Harry sighed "This is so bloody confusing, I'm just going to put down what you said, I really don't get it."
Draco Malfoy stayed behind to ask Harry a few questions about the shield charms, He was one of the few who had taken the lesson seriously and had paid attention, Harry wasn't surprised, given how close the blonde was  with Voldemort and his inner circle, he was avoiding punishment. After answering, Harry offered to help him or any of the Slytherins with any other questions or pointers they had in between meetings, informing the Blonde that he usually spent an hour down by the lake by himself before curfew most days.
Over the next couple of days Draco came over, the three teenagers were practically inseparable; Draco had decorated Harry's room with black leather couches, a king size bed with silky sliver sheets, a fancy chandler, posters of the England Quidditch team. He charmed the walls a sapphire blue which surprised Harry at first but when he asked Draco he said "My rooms green they can't be identical"
