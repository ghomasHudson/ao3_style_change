Draco nodded. “Yes.” He lied easily, sitting up in bed and stretching his arms over his head. If he was being honest, his sleep was far from easy. Ever since Snape had given Harry the potion that would eventually cure Harry, Draco’s nights had been plagued by nightmares. Visions of Harry being ripped from his grasp flashed through his dreams again and again, followed by the terror and pain that the Dark Lord would great him with the moment the vampire wasn’t there to protect him. But he couldn’t tell Harry any of that. The vampire could never know what he was truly given in that goblet Draco had coaxed him to drink from, on orders from the Headmaster and Minister of Magic, of course. Harry could never know that within three weeks time he would lose the blonde, no longer needing him for his blood.
When Narcissa spotted him, smiling in relief and waving him over, Draco gave Blaise and Seamus a hasty good-bye. “What will you two be doing now?” he asked curiously, arching an eyebrow as the pair exchanged a mischievous, bordering on seductive look.
Exhausted with the pure force of his release, Draco nearly collapsed in Harry’s arms, sagging against the other teen in an effort to stay on his feet. “Harry…” he breathed, sounding rather dazed, and Harry smiled. Within him the Incubus was thrumming with content, having feasted on Draco’s stunning release of sexual energy. After keeping it bottled up for so long, the Incubus’s feast was truly a delightful one.
When Draco awoke it was to a soft, melodious voice crooning in his ear as a comforting warmth pressed against his back and a gentle hand stroked him. Once his brain registered exactly where that hand was, however, Draco’s eyes flew open and he started squirming. “No! Get off!”
“Yes,” Harry hissed with a curling smirk, his fingernails lengthening so they could cut through Draco’s shirt with ease. “I’m afraid Harry’s gone now, Draco,” he cooed. “But he’ll come back after I’m finished. He’ll be so distraught once he sees what I’ve done. He really does adore you.”
Harry nodded, promptly doing as Draco requested. Within minutes the house elf had reappeared, set a tray of food in front of Draco, and the blonde had dug in. There were several long minutes filled with the sound of Draco hungrily eating until finally Harry spoke, his voice hesitant. “You…I would like… you don’t have to keep the door locked.” He murmured haltingly. “I wouldn’t leave your chambers.”
Harry shook his head, tongue shooting out to lap away a couple of spilled drops of blood on his lips. It was then that Draco noticed Harry was trembling with repressed desire. He wanted, no needed, more of Draco’s blood. And yet he had stopped, holding back. But why? “Drink.” Harry commanded softly, still staring at Draco. “You need the sugar and energy, it will help.”
"HELP I'M CHOKING!" Harry suddenly yelled. "I NEED MOUTH TO MOUTH QUICK!"
A huff left Draco’s lips and he folded his arms across his chest. “It was necessary because if you’re going to be with a Malfoy then you have to dress like a Malfoy.” He answered haughtily. “We have an image to uphold, I can’t be seen with a mate who dresses like a street urchin.” Harry made to retort about the state of his clothing, but Draco cut him off. “Not to mention I like spoiling you and it’s going to infuriate my father once he realizes our fortune is being spent on the Boy Who Lived and there’s nothing he can do about it.” He finished, smirking evilly.
Over with the Gryffindors Harry couldn't believe his luck. First he found Draco, possibly the hottest bloke in the entire school, twice trapped under enchanted mistletoe, then the Slytherin just had to remove practically his entire top layer of clothing. Honestly, it was so lucky that little Hufflepuff hadn't been paying attention as she ran through the Great Hall with pumpkin juice. Wait...luck...Harry gasped and he got out the small box that now only contained two potions and read through the note again. "One to make your wildest dreams come true..." he whispered, starting to wonder if maybe...
The blonde laughed, nodding his acceptance. “Of course. Although Potter, usually the sex comes
At the gentle touch Draco’s dams broke and the next thing he knew he was sobbing into Blaise’s shoulder, tears cascading down his cheeks. He barely even noticed as Blaise maneuvered them over to the couch, allowing Draco to curl up against his side as he continued to cry. Blaise stroked his fingers lightly through Draco’s hair as he waited for the blonde to calm down enough to speak. The gentle touches soothed Draco slightly and eventually his shoulders stopped shaking and the sobs subsided enough for Draco to form coherent words.
Harry nodded, then opened his mouth to speak. "These chocolates really are quite a delight. You must eat one to see I'm not in a plight." he said, wincing mentally. Even in a drugged state he wasn't the best of rhymers.
Harry blinked, quickly moving back from Draco and lowering his gaze. “Sorry.” He mumbled. “You just…look so cute when you’re sleeping.” He admitted softly.
A shiver of horror ran through Draco as the Headmaster smiled at him, the irritatingly calm twinkle back in his eyes. “We have reason to believe that you may be Mr. Potter’s intended, Mr. Malfoy.”
Shaking the dark thoughts from his head, Draco looked up at the darkening sky with relief. He was almost tempted to just find a nearby bar and drink his sorrows away, but he knew where that would lead. He’d get drunk and end up taking some bloke home with him, and he didn’t want that. Not tonight.
Harry shook his head. "No, I haven't been able to decide which to eat first. It is quite a problem. Plus they didn't come with a guide to tell me what is in which chocolate." he paused for a moment to stir 44 times in a counter-clockwise figure-eight motion before continuing. "So what'd you get Luna, Neville?" he asked.
“Oh, I do believe that we both know his infection was deliberate, Lucius. What I want to know is how it happened and why, so the Ministry has been made aware of the situation at hand and I am going to do everything in my power to make sure that everyone involved in this is sent to Azkaban.” Dumbledore’s explanation was still calm, but there was a deadliness to his voice that sent shivers down Draco’s spine.
Despite knowing that eventually Harry would get better, the realization that it had actually happened still hit Draco like a hippogriff. He felt empty and cold inside, and it took all of his legendary Malfoy control to stop a sab from escaping his lips.
"I'm going outside to make out, care to join me?" Harry finally replied. He clapped his hands over his mouth yet again, eyes widening. He DEFINATELY had not meant to say that. He had meant to say, "You're a delusional scrawny ferret." but it just wouldn't come out.
At that Ron snorted, shaking his head in disbelief. “Like we’re going to believe that.” He muttered scathingly. “That’s even more ridiculous than the rumors that have been flying around the school.”
“You were
That wasn’t to say that Draco was unhappy, far from it actually. He was a Death Eater who’s crimes had been forgiven and within three years had managed not only to become one of the best Potion’s Masters in the country, but also somehow became one of the most lusted after male models the Wizarding world had ever seen. Who knew that the correct lighting, look at the camera, and just the right amount of skin would turn the brand of the Dark Mark from something truly evil to his well known sex symbol. Apparently witches, and quite a few wizards he’d been told, liked a bad boy.
fine. He had just gotten better. Harry had gotten better and didn’t remember what had happened and now they were all trying to keep the two of them apart so their lives could ‘go back to normal’. As if Draco’s life could ever go back to normal now that he had had Harry in it.
"Oh god." Draco muttered, looking horrified. Harry just grinned at him like Christmas had come early and he had been elected as the most awesome person ever to live.
"Fucking hell, this AGAIN!" Draco growled. "And let me guess, Harry sodding Potter is just going to come strolling down this corridor to snog me and who knows what else and...and..." he trailed off, realizing something. "Oh...fuck." he murmured in amazement.
Harry chewed his lip, trying to keep a silly grin from spreading across his lips. Oh, today was his lucky day indeed... "Well, Malfoy...what usually comes after kissing with illegal amounts of tongue action?"
“You’re such a villain.” Draco exclaimed dramatically, flinging his hand over his forehead like a Prima Donna. “Seducing poor innocent Malfoys! How could you?!”
After taking in the above information it is probably pointless to say what wonderful day in the Wizarding World it was, since I'm sure that you are all very intelligent beings. However, I'm going to tell you anyways just because I want to. It was Valentine's Day. Now you know.
“Voldemort.” The vampire hissed, his voice filled with venom and a deep, dark hatred. “He’s the one who made me like this, the one who made you my mate.”
Quickly Harry pulled his hand away from Draco’s pants, as if burned, a confused frown slipping onto his lips. “I’m sorry.” He quickly apologized, peering up at Draco with wide, dark eyes. “I thought you liked it. The noises you were making… they sounded pleasurable.”
The young body beneath him was panting and whining, writhing with something that was certainly not pain. The Incubus inside of Harry awoke, coming alive as it fed off the other’s pleasure. He needed the man and he needed him now.
Frowning, Draco tilted his head to the side in confusion, trying his hardest to swallow his anger. “But why would the Dark Lord capture Harry instead of just killing him?” he finally asked.
For a few moments Draco just gaped at Harry from his position on the floor before his world went crumbling down around his ears. Harry forgot. Harry got better and…and forgot him. That was the only explanation. Swallowing hard, Draco stood on shaky legs, tugging his shirt down over the mark of Harry’s claim on is arm, the scar tingling unpleasantly.
But then Harry was talking again, pulling Draco from his thoughts. “It’s just…I’m drinking from your hand, so far from your heart.” The vampire tentatively nuzzled Draco’s neck before pulling away the moment he felt Draco stiffen in fright. “Severus, he said the closer to your heart the more potent the blood, and… the better it would feel for you.” He explained softly. “And…I would only have to feed once a day from your neck.”
Draco slowly nodded, taking in her words and filing them away for when he was ready to think about the vampire ordeal again. “I’ll remember that, Madam Pomfrey. I’m fine now, can I go?” he asked, trying his hardest not to sound impatient. He had enough to worry about without adding a trip to the hospital wing to the list.
“Harry-Harry please-“ Draco protested as the vampire pinned him down under his body and ripped off his shirt.
, Harry thought as his gaze traveled over Draco's bare chest.
The vampire’s face was pale, even paler than usual, as if all the life had been sucked from it. His cheekbones were prominent, the skin stretched tight across them, and his eyes seemed almost glazed, sunken back into their sockets. As Draco studied him he could see a slight, never ending tremor shaking through Harry’s body. It was evident from the darkness around Harry’s eyes and way that he barely moved that the vampire hadn’t ventured form that spot in days, maybe even since Draco had left almost a week earlier.
Harry winced and chewed on his lower lip with one rather sharp looking fang, almost immediately drawing blood. “I already said I was sorry,” he mumbled, looking down. “I can’t do much else, I need your blood to live. You’re my mate, Draco…you’re mine.”
"It's like liquid gold!" Ron whispered in awe.
“Taking what’s mine,” Harry answered with a smirk, pressing his hard length against Draco’s thigh.
It wasn’t like he wanted Harry to suck his blood…right?
“I’ll be joining him there.” Seamus grinned, licking his lips. “There’s a rather good wizard in Florence who specializes in pyrotechnics. I wrote him a while back, explaining my interest, and he said I could do work with him.” He paused, giving Draco a questioning look. “What about you? Do you even need to work?”
Draco looked down, his body betraying his state of arousal from the memory of the vampire pulling his life force from him. Cursing himself, Draco reached down, giving himself relief from the aching problem.
Behind him Draco could feel Harry hesitate before reluctantly pulling away. He listened to the creature’s receding footsteps until he heard the heavy thunk of Harry’s door shut behind him. “What is this about, Headmaster?” Draco asked warily, feeling strangely nervous now that the vampire was gone from his side.
“I can make you feel better.” The vampire practically purred, licking his lips in a way Draco supposed was meant to be seductive, but which he found to be rather terrifying. “I can make all the pain go away.” He continued, shifting until he was in a crouching position, ready to pounce.
Slowly Draco took a few steps backwards, preparing to run, keeping his wand trained on the figure that had yet to move. Taking a deep breath, Draco was about to make a dash for it when he suddenly found himself pressed up against a stone wall, a hand at his throat.
"Do you have to?" Lucius whined, pouting quite prettily. Snape scowled at him and nodded, which made Lucius pout even more.
Harry wouldn’t forget him…right?
Breathless, Harry nodded, his eyes wide. “Very, very good.” He panted, starring at Draco in wonder. “And I still have to wash you.”
“I…I don’t understand.” Draco said in confusion, brow furrowing. “You…how am I still alive?
Relief washed over Harry and he eagerly nodded. “I…I would love that.” He took a deep breath, preparing himself for what he had to say. “Draco…can I take you out to dinner?”
for himself.” He sighed, running a hand through his hair and looking rather lost and vulnerable in that moment. “So you see, I
Luckily for him Harry was too preoccupied with his own worries to notice. “What about the sun?” he asked, eyes going wide. “I mean, I know it’s supposed to be gloomy and rainy all day, but what if the sun comes out?”
"N-no." he whimpered, still searching for Draco in his head. "Where are you?"
Frowning, Draco looked up, glancing around him. Something was wrong. The air was too still and Harry should have been back by now. He stood slowly, glancing around the crowded restaurant, searching for the pull towards his Vampire that usually accompanied Harry’s presence. But he felt nothing. Harry was gone.
. By the third day Draco had locked himself in his and Harry’s room, refusing to come out for meals or let anyone inside. He curled up in bed, feeling sick to his stomach as the hours ticked away.
Draco nodded, pressing his lips to Harry's forehead. "Yeah. Course I will."
Dumbledore nodded, a frown crossing his features, but before he could ask Draco was ushering him out the door and slamming it with a dull thud in his face.
Draco chuckled softly and nodded in understanding. “Wouldn’t dream of it.”
Outside in the corridor a blonde man stood next to a very dark haired man. Both had been partaking in a rather enjoyable time with the other when they had rounded a bend and heard quite disturbing noises coming from the wall that they now faced. Snape furrowed his brow, listening, while Lucius sneakily tried to place his hand in Snape's.
There had been only one good bit of news that day, but it had left Draco uncertain. Harry could be cured, or at least, that’s what Severus had said. According to Draco’s godfather, whatever the Dark Lord had used to change Harry wasn’t stable. Although the Vampire was dominating now, the head of Slytherin house claimed that it could possibly be convinced to go dormant, leaving Harry once again human. This would, of course, depend on the Incubus and Siren bits cooperating, although Severus claimed that they already had morphed into the Vampire’s infection. Even if the cure
"What?" Draco blinked before following Harry quickly. The Gryffindor pulled Draco into his Common Room and up to his dorm, closing the door behind them tightly. "Potter, I really don't think-"
There was a long pause and finally Harry nodded, standing and stepping away from Draco. “Very well, then I won’t,” he said, voice barely above a silken whisper. “You should go. Tell
“Two days.” The Death Eater reported, bowing his head low, the torch-light shimmering over the layer of grease that coated his hair. “In two days Dumbledore will release Potter, allowing him to travel with the rest of the students to Hogsmeade. That will be your chance, My Lord.”
A smirk slipped across Harry’s lips as he stepped forwards. “Yes, they will all die.” He hissed. He took another step forwards and Voldemort’s eyes widened imperceptibly before Harry’s hand thrust forwards, pushing through his chest. Blood splattered against his robes and behind him the other Death Eater’s shouted spells, trying in vein to take him down.
Harry’s cock had thickened and lengthened to such proportions that Draco was sure it would never in a hundred years fit inside him. What made Draco shudder the most, however, was the ridge of spines that descended from his pelvis down either side of Harry’s shaft to the tip. They looked incredibly painful and a glistening sheen seemed to cover Harry’s cock from root to tip.
hurt me?”
Harry chuckled, finger running over the pendant at his throat again as Ron groaned. “You always know just what to say, Hermione.”
“Go to Hogsmeade in two day’s time. Bring me back Potter, but be discrete about it.” The Dark Lord paused, looking almost pensive. “Bring Bellatrix with you. She’ll make sure you don’t fail.”
many other blokes have tasted
Sighing, Draco had to agree with the vampire, he was already feeling slightly dizzy from blood loss. “Fine.” Draco muttered, huffing and folding his arms. “But after a break you’re going to drink until you aren’t hungry anymore, okay?”
All too soon Harry was laving his tongue over the marks he’d made, once again sealing them instantly. By this time Draco was fully hard and aching, pressing back against Harry in a silent plea as the Vampire pulled back slightly.
“Malfoy.” A calm, cool voice sounded above him. “What the fuck do you think you’re doing?” there was a shove against his chest and Draco went sprawling backwards, his breath knocked out of him.
"I dunno, it doesn't have a name." Harry answered, taking the present back and very carefully opening it. Under the wrappings was a very delicate box made out of a shining dark silver stone with intricate engravings on it, which to Harry seemed to almost spell out words.
Draco heard footsteps and turned around, making a fake groan at the sight of Harry. "Oh not you again." he spat before realizing that Harry had stopped just outside the mistletoe and indeed was not yet trapped as Draco was. Mentally the Slytherin swore since it seemed like he would not be getting another hot snog by the Golden Boy himself to get him out.
Harry returns and the aftermath.
"Language, Potter." Draco drawled. "The only time you can talk dirty is when you're alone with me." he leered at Harry.
"Can't...not if you're not here."
sorry, Potter. I'm a bad, bad Slytherin." he said, voice dripping with sarcasm. "Which vial did you take?" he asked suddenly.
"Fine then Sevi-Kins." he said in a sugary sweet voice before quickly turning tail and fleeing to the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom.
"I think a better question would be who sent them." Ron said, looking at the note suspiciously. He felt like he knew that handwriting...
A smirk spread over Harry’s lips as he reached a hand out to play with a few strands of soft, blonde hair. “I can be an even
“Yes, My Lord?” Dolohov asked nervously.
Our love could make us such triumphant friends.
A small squeak left Draco's lips but he nodded quickly. Of course he wanted to go to the feast, he was missing his favorite double chocolate cream pudding. Perish the thought of missing THAT! "Of course I do." Draco spat, his fingers tripping over the front of Harry's pants and deftly pulling them down. "Now let's get this over with."
Draco snickered and leaned against the closest wall, looking over Harry with half-hooded eyes. "Well you see I was going to say that I was going to take the whipped cream and..." he whispered in Harry's ear, whatever he said making Harry's jaw drop. "and then I'd take the strawberries and..." whatever he said made Harry's eyes grow wide. "And then I'd lick it inch by inch off of you." Draco finished with a leer, Harry's breath now quite erratic. This was obviously a side effect of the drugged chocolate.
Harry grinned brightly and started unwrapping his presents, slowly going through the ever decreasing mound of gifts. By the time he neared the bottom of the stack he had gotten a book on fashion sense (from Hermione), a set of hot Quidditch player posters (from Ron), a necklace with a crystal lightning bolt that was supposed to be able to tell his mood (from Luna), a sock (from Dobby), and a garter belt (from Seamus), just to name a few.
Once again, later that morning on his way to lunch, Harry was found walking along an empty corridor. There he came upon Draco Malfoy standing awkwardly in the middle of the hall, alone. Immediately Harry glanced up and saw, exactly as he had expected, a bunch of mistletoe.
"What potter?" he asked, clutching his sides as he rolled around on the floor. "Wait." suddenly he stopped laughing. "You weren't rhyming!" he gasped. Harry paused for a few moments, grinning.
"What were you going to say?" he asked. "You can't just mention it then let it go away."
In answer, understanding what Draco wanted to know, Harry nodded. “Many times.” He said, unable to keep the silly, happy smile from spreading across his lips. He had brought his mate pleasure and that made the vampire within him preen with pride. “You were out for many hours and…your hardness wouldn’t go away. I didn’t actually touch you.” He quickly reassured Draco. “Just…just your trousers. I think the hardness was an after-effect of my drinking from your neck. I’m sorry.” He apologized, ducking his head in shame.
Ehem...
Harry chuckled, the sound low and guttural in his throat. He gently coaxed Draco to turn around without a word, gripping both of their cocks in one hand to stroke them together. Shuddering a bit at the sensation, Harry let out a soft whimper, his hips rocking as his hand twisted and pumped. “Draco…” the vampire breathed, voice heavy and deep with arousal.
"Magic, no duh." Neville replied, tossing the wrong salamander parts into their cauldron.
"Mh hm." Draco smirked, noticing the flick in Harry's eyes. "Think you can handle kissing a Slytherin, Potter?" he drawled.
Blaise blinked before he arched an eyebrow. “You mean he forgot who you were?”
one.” He smirked.
Draco nodded eagerly, hoping against hope that Severus could be proved wrong and then he really wouldn’t have to let the new vampire drink from him. “Yes.”
Hermione nodded. "I have an idea."
Ron reddened slightly and cleared his throat. "Well, um..." he trailed off, not comfortable giving out such personal information.
"You're not very bright now are you, Potter. Eating chocolates from someone you didn't know. You're just lucky I didn't poison them." Malfoy drawled with a smirk.
Harry nodded and extracted the heart shaped box from his pocket. "Yeah I have them." he replied.
"Oh my god..." Harry whispered. "I thought I was straight, then I met you." his eyes were wide, making Draco fall on the floor laughing.
Draco sniffed. "I'm right here," he said gently.
At long last, hours later, Harry was sated and he collapsed down on the bed, gathering Liam in his arms. The teen had passed out a while ago, his human body too weak to keep up with a woefully neglected Incubus. Harry sighed softly, feeling fuller than he ever had since he turned. He snuggled up to the warm body next to him, closing his eyes with a contented hum. Within moments he was asleep.
Draco snorted, shaking his head. “I don’t care, I don’t want you taking my blood.”
“Our bond is more than just blood.” Harry murmured quietly, making Draco flinch slightly as he reached out to gently brush away the droplets of tears. “You are my mate, Draco, my reason for life itself. I need you like I need air. You’re a part of me.” He said quietly, eyes downcast as he kept his gaze away from Draco’s. “And if…if you’d rather have Blaise, I…I will allow it.” He whispered, tone almost broken at the very thought of losing Draco. “I will not make you stay with me against your will.”
The Headmaster smiled, eyes twinkling maddeningly. “I have delightful news for you, Mr. Malfoy.” He announced. “Severus has informed me that he’s managed to find a sort of…cure for Mr. Potter.”
For a few moments Harry just sat there, hunger coursing through him. Being away from his mate only made the hunger stronger, threatening to overwhelm his reason. He could smell the other young man; he could hear his heart pumping, the blood rushing through his veins. The sound called to Harry, singing in his ears, and his fangs, unbidden, extended.
"No." Harry mumbled, becoming agitated. "No!"
"Gosh Dean you are SO good at that." Seamus said breathlessly. Dean grinned up at the Irishman and licked his licks seductively.
“I’m tired, Potter.” Draco finally said. “Can I go now?” he asked, though he was almost positive the vampire would never reject his wishes.
The Vampire, on the other hand, was a nervous wreck from the moment Draco told him the news. Nothing Draco did seemed to reassure Harry that everything was going to be fine.
Draco rolled his eyes, shifting so he could slide his fingers through Harry’s hair. “Potter, you’re an idiot.” He huffed. “I was waiting for
"OR," Hermione added with a smile. "He's already found the mystery sender and he's snogging the daylights out of her.
"Can't find you. Gotta find you."
At that Blaise’s eyes went wide. “You mean Potter’s back to normal? He’s been cured?”
One day to make it mine and mine alone.
A frown spread across Harry’s lips and his brow furrowed. “But I already…” he trailed off in confusion.
Draco stared down at Harry, vision blurred as he placed his hand over Harry's heart, not feeling a beat. "Oh, god," he breathed, shaking as he drew Harry to him and held him tightly.
Mr. Potter decided that he most definitely should not be the only one up on this fine morning, so Mr. Potter woke up his best friend Ron. He did so by dropping a rather large herring on Mr. Weasley's head. Now that Mr. Weasley was up the ginger took it upon himself to wake up every other boy in the dormitory and soon enough the room was filled with very awake teenage boys who were all just as excited as Harry about this oh so exciting and wonderful of days.
Draco smirked and looked over at the doors to the Great Hall, which just so happened at that very moment to open to admit the Golden Trio, Harry in the lead. He was looking rather sexy in the new sweater Molly Weasley had knitted him, Draco had to admit to himself. The Slytherin watched as Harry glanced over at him and looked quickly away before doing a double-take.
Draco smiled and cuddled against Harry, completely drained. He smiled as Harry ran his fingers gently through his hair and the blonde started almost-purring.
For a few moments Blaise could just gape at Harry, his eyes wide and full of fear as Harry showed fangs. Quickly Draco placed his hands on Harry’s shoulders, trying to distract Harry from killing his best friend. “Nothing, Potter, we were just talking.”
“Surely you aren’t implying that my son is somehow involved.” Lucius said, affronted. “He’s only sixteen!”
Or that least, that’s what he kept telling himself, even as he jumped out of bed and rushed to the bathroom, vomiting in guilt.
Ever since Harry had returned to Hogwarts carrying the head of the defeated Dark Lord something was different about their friend. Something…off. They weren’t sure if it was merely the loss of a few months of memories or if it was something else entirely, something far more sinister. Occasionally Ron would catch the look in his eye; the wild look of hunger and evil, as if he creatures were still inside of him, just waiting out their time. Then other times Harry would look lost and empty, as though he had misplaced something of great importance and yet couldn’t remember what it was he had lost in the first place.
"Oh." Neville said, seemingly disappointed. "I thought it was probably from one of your million fangirls wanting to have your first born child." he said wistfully. "Well have you eaten them yet?"
Lucius looked utterly aghast, straightening up. “Well then, I do believe it would be in Draco’s better interest to be removed from this school while there is a Vampire craving his blood. I demand you allow him to return home at once, Headmaster.”
"Draco..." he breathed, lips barely moving. "Where are you...can't see."
His heart rate slowing, Harry slowly calmed, his wings folding before disappearing once again into his back. Ever so slowly the creatures within him withdrew, slinking back into the shadows. Their job was done.
“H-Harry.” Draco repeated, the name unfamiliar as it rolled off his tongue. “I…since when…” he trailed off, his thought process halted as he felt Harry’s lips at his throat. A deep moan escaped his lips and he tilted his head back, giving the vampire more room.
“What, together?” Harry snorted, smirking at Draco’s startled expression. “He was my prey, not my lover.” He hummed, licking his lips at the memory. “Merlin, he tasted so good…like red wine. But you, you my sweet Draco, you will taste like Ambrosia, of that I’m sure.”
The vampire frowned, slowly crawling off of Draco and sitting back on the end of the couch. “You…you are?” he breathed in surprise, the sight of the scar on Draco’s forearm calming him down. Now everyone would know exactly who Draco belonged to.
“Oh shut it.” Blaise laughed, flushing brightly as he slapped Draco’s shoulder playfully. “If you saw what he possessed, you’d be gagging for it too.”
“I don’t like prey that runs.” The man told him, a tongue flicking against the shell of his ear. “Especially not prey that’s as pretty as you. I’ve seen the pictures, the ones in the …special magazines.” Draco stiffened and he felt hot breath snicker against his neck. “I must say…you look
A smile flashed across Hermione’s lips and she reached across Harry to grab some food. “Good thinking, Harry. We still have three weeks until they start. If we begin preparing now we should be more than ready to go come exams.” She stated, voice stern and bearing no room for argument.
“Your professors have informed me that you’ve once again stopped going to class.” Dumbledore answered sternly, though Draco could pick out the touch of concern in his voice. The old man regarded him over the top of his spectacles for a few moments before he continued. “I have come to assure you that Harry is perfectly fine. He is in no danger.”
, Harry thought,
On the bed Harry lay still, fingers barely twitching in Draco's palm. Last time he had come back out of obligation, because the world needed him, but this time...He didn't want to. He was back in that white void, like a station but not, but this time Sirius wasn't here. This time he was left alone.
Unfortunately, though, Draco was unable to fully enjoy the kiss for moments after he had started sucking lightly on Harry Potter's wonderful tongue he was roughly shoved away. Stunned, the Slytherin for a moment thought that Harry had not been enjoying the kiss as much as he had, but then he looked up to see a group of students coming around the corner and into their previously deserted corridor.
The two Professors exchanged looks and Severus carefully nodded. “There is a slight possibility that you are not, however, that is unlikely. There’s a way to find out for sure, if you wish to.”
For the vampire, all was well.
. He liked how it felt when Harry fed, had even come to crave the sensation, really. But most of all, Draco liked feeling safe, knowing that the vampire would protect Draco from any harm, no matter what.
Harry wandered the white void, wondering if it would be better for everyone if he just stayed here and never came back. Surely no one would miss him? He paused as he heard words, a familiar, calming voice. "Draco?" He breathed. In the real world he tried to speak, but his tongue was heavy and no sound came out.
Dumbledore sighed, looking behind him where Severus and McGonagall stood quietly, observing the altercation. “Severus, do you think you could explain this to Mr. Malfoy? I have contacts in the Order who I must inform about this incident. Minerva, if you could explain to Mr. Malfoy the arrangements that will be made that would be excellent. Good day.” He smiled and nodded to them before sweeping out.
present. My very bloody valentine.” He smiled, rolling over so he was straddling Draco’s hips, kissing him soundly.
"All it says is WD. I don't know anyone with those initials." Harry sighed, looking at the vials forlornly and idly wondering if belonging to this person would be a bad thing. He felt like he recognized the tone behind the words...
At 12 this morning,
Harry’s tongue flicked out in agreement, licking over his lips. “Well you’re not wrong about that.” He whispered, voice soft and dark and somehow sweet to Draco’s ears. “Do you wish to finish your drink first?”
"Ahh, what a beautiful winter morning." Draco sighed happily as he sat in his seat at the Slytherin table. Both Blaise and Pansy arched an eyebrow as they slid into spots across from him and looked up to see a dark grey ceiling that threatened snow.
A slow smile spread across Harry’s lip at the questions. “I can’t say for sure.” He admitted. “Some of them die. But I can promise that if I kill you you will love every moment of it. I’ll try not to, though.” He promised. “I’ve wanted you for too long to only feed once.”
Severus nodded and flicked his wand at the door Draco had been eyeing, and it slowly swung open, showing nothing but darkness. Within the darkened room Harry looked up at the rectangle of light, squinting against the brightness. Something in the light called to him, a song of yearning and desire washing through his very soul. He wanted to call to it, sing to it and make it his own, but he remained quiet, the hunger pulling at him. Harry stood slowly, the motion oddly fluid and graceful, taking a few strides towards the door opening and the light. He paused, hiding back in the shadows a few feet from the doorway as he heard voices.
Harry's eyes widened and he looked a bit sheepish. With all the wonderful, coincidental Malfoy snogging, he had completely forgotten about finding out who had sent him that present. "No." he shook his head. "Although..." he glanced over at the Slytherins to see Draco had taken his usual seat facing the Gryffindor's, "I have a lead."
There was a soft rustling sound and a weak fire flared up in the fireplace, giving just enough light for Draco to make out shapes and even deeper shadows. “Draco…” a voice croaked, weak and dying. “Why…why come back now?” Harry asked and Draco finally managed to locate the vampire, sitting in his chair by the fire. As Draco got closer is became apparent just how badly the absence of Draco’s blood had affected him.
All three Gryffindor's turned to look at the entrance to the Great Hall as the door opened and Draco walked through on slightly shaky legs, his hair a mess. "Speak of the devil..." Hermione breathed.
"Of course it just had to be you." Draco growled, making himself sound angry and like it was the worst possible thing in the world to happen instead of being very very pleased and not believing his luck. "The Weasley Twin's enchanted mistletoe." He nodded to what was hanging above them in the middle of the corridor. "It chooses a person at random and traps them under it until another person comes along and traps them too. It doesn't let either of them leave this spot until the requirements are fulfilled." he explained.
. The voice inside himself provided without hesitation.
The Vampire nodded, sitting up so he could lean over and press a gentle kiss to his mate’s lips. It made the creatures within him sing with bliss, the first time Draco had kissed him and every time since. He’d never expected the Slytherin to return his affection, let alone return it with enthusiasm, and yet there they were. “When will they be here?” he asked once the need to breathe overcame them and they separated.
The boy whimpered as Harry approached, curling into a tight ball. “Please.” He begged quietly. “Please don’t.”
At the time Dumbledore had said something about them getting some much needed fresh air and a chance to stretch their legs, but Draco didn’t quite buy it. The headmaster always had ulterior motives, Draco was positive of that. After all, Draco knew just how well Dumbledore was at manipulating the strings just to his liking. Despite his reservations, however, Draco couldn’t help but feel giddy at the thought of finally getting out of Hogwarts, and with Harry nonetheless.
just asked him a direct question and he had to answer. “Yes.” The Gryffindor finally admitted. “I do…yearn for your touch.”
Draco let out a breathy moan as the vampire captured his lips in a hard kiss, fingers working to divest him of his robes and trousers. Within minutes Draco was completely naked, spread out underneath the other man for his gaze to devour. “Please.” He whispered, his cock hard and throbbing, yearning for any touch Harry might give him. “I need…”
At that Severus stiffened, glancing at McGonagall before he answered. “It is my belief that the Dark Lord is the one who infected Potter. He had me make a potion that would have enabled him to infect Potter with the creatures’ blood, as long as he had them on hand.” He paused, giving Draco an almost sympathetic look. “I also believe that the Dark Lord may have put your blood in the potion, ensuring that you would be Potter’s intended. Your father may have been involved.”
“Exactly.” The Headmaster nodded again. “Hence why we needed to allow Voldemort to capture him. Voldemort would take him, thinking that Harry will be his little Dark pet to use, and Harry would finally have enough strength, power, and Darkness in him to destroy Voldemort once and for all.”
They continued their activities and soon the room was filled with many moans and groans. Yes, they were playing scrabble. Just kidding, but you can probably figure it out. I still have great faith in you thinking abilities.
become more intimate, mostly due to Draco’s rather noticeable reaction to the Vampire drinking his blood. And yet, Draco realized, despite how the Vampire claimed to want it, Draco had yet to be truly taken by Harry.
"Wait." Draco said with a smirk. "Are those pick-up lines?"
After a few moments Draco nodded. “Of course, though I can’t guarantee he’ll remember you. And it may take some time before he’s stable enough to be around other people. Blaise was over and Harry almost ripped his throat out.” He admitted sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck. “The Dark Lord wanted to turn Harry into a monster, a weapon of Darkness for his own sick purposes. We’re not yet sure which creatures are dormant within him, nor how much of Harry actually survived the infection.”
Huffing in frustration, Draco fixed his hair in the bathroom before stepping out into the sitting room to meet Harry. Well, he’d just have to bring it up that afternoon, then. He’d make sure the Vampire knew that Draco Malfoy wanted to belong to Harry Potter. Forever.
Draco paused in his train of though, his eyes going wide as he thought of something. Slowly he looked up at Harry, his stomach coiling in knots. “Harry?” he asked tentatively. “If, say…someone wanted to kill me—if they actually tried to kill me—what would you do?”
After a pause Draco shook his head, rolling onto his side and getting more comfortable. “Strange as it may be… I trust you, Harry.” He admitted quietly. “Now go to sleep and stop talking.” He huffed, pulling the covers up more over them and closing his eyes.
“The Dark Lord wants you.” The Death Eater in the doorway announced, trying not to flinch at Harry paused in his feeding from the body underneath him. The Vampire straightened, licking the blood from his lips as he gaze seemed to bore its way through the man’s mask.
Harry shrugged. “As ready as I’ll ever be, given the circumstances.” He answered, grimacing a little. It still irked him that he was missing over two months of memories including time that contained the memories of him slaughtering the Dark Lord. Although, to be honest, after waking up soaked in blood with Voldemort’s head clutched in his hands, sometimes Harry was thankful he couldn’t remember the abject destruction he had caused.
~The End~
“Good morning, Mate.” Harry answered with a content hum, continuing to stroke Draco’s hair. “Have a nice sleep?”
Draco waited, holding his breath as he wondered if there was going to be some kind of sign, the tears he'd kept bottled up for so long flowing freely as he sobbed and held Harry's hand in his.
"Who's that from Harry?" Hermione asked, looking over his shoulder at the box of chocolates he had opened moments before.
"I'm taking this one." Harry said firmly, unstopping the vial and drinking it in one gulp. He shuddered slightly and Ron watched him in horror.
The Vampire smirked a bit at that and the Incubus perked up. Carefully Harry reached around Draco, knocking his hand away to replace it with his own. He let a conservative amount of the Incubus’s powers out, just enough to push small concentrations of magic to his fingertips. He stroked Draco lightly and the other boy let out a short shriek of surprise as pleasure spiked through him.
The vampire cocked a curious eyebrow. “Does it really feel that good?” he asked, pure curiosity in his voice. He wasn’t mocking him, making fun of Draco.
By the time Draco managed to get to the Entrance Hall a crowd had already gathered, and despite his best pushing and shoving Draco couldn’t break through to the front before Harry was whisked off to the Hospital Wing. He was largely uninjured, a broken nose and exhaustion the only things he had to recover from. Nonetheless Draco waited for the crowd to disperse before he hurried up to the Hospital Wing to see him.
Slowly Draco nodded, settling back against the pillows of his bed. “Yes, Headmaster. Umm…what about the Incubus?” he asked, trying to mask his anger and hurt with curiosity. His father had written him off, just like that. The very idea of the family name being tarnished and his father had signed him off to be some Vampire’s plaything. Expected, yes, but it stung nonetheless. “You said P-Potter has Incubus in him as well. What effects will that have?”
For a moment Draco felt his stomach plummet, an emptiness spreading across his chest. “I…what do you mean?” he managed to get out, mouth becoming dry. Harry…could be cured? That was good, wasn’t it? He asked himself. But then why was he having such an adverse reaction to the seemingly welcome news?
Malfoy clucked his tongue. "Tut, tut, Potter you really are a stupid one. You ate a brown then a white piece didn't you. Interesting..." he trailed off, "I always wondered what would happen if Veritaserum and Aphrodisiac were mixed.”
A cold laugh that made shivers run down Draco’s spine escaped from between Harry’s plump lips. “Don’t I? You’re mine, Draco. All of you.
Draco panted, his eyes wide as he trembled in fear underneath the vampire. There were tears in his eyes as he looked up at Harry, the pain slowly fading from his body. “I-I’m sorry, Harry.” He whispered, curling up into a tight ball.
The first signs of Harry’s change started at breakfast a week and a day after he had been infected. The signs started…and they didn’t stop.
"Yes." he whispered, eyes fluttering open to look up at Draco. "I'm so tired, Draco...so tired."
"What the fuck Malfoy!" Harry yelled. "What are you doing sending chocolates to a boy!" then Harry clasped his hands over his mouth.
“You will be my prize, my pet.” Voldemort smiled as he looked Harry over, feeling the pure power radiating from the Dark creature before him. “And you will reign destruction upon our enemies, those who dare go against us.”
Quickly Severus nodded, bowing low as he inched towards the door. “Of course, My Lord. I assure you, it will work as I promised.”
.” He hissed out the name, sending shivers coursing down Draco’s spine. “Are you willing to become mine?”
The blonde nodded, hoping the flush was gone from his cheeks. “Yeah, I’ll be back. And…and I’ll leave the door open.” He promised. After a moment he climbed off of Harry’s lap, glad his robes hid his distressing problem. “Have a nice evening, Potter.” He said before quickly hurrying out of the room.
Draco shivered. "Well I'm not dead. What if you came back?" He said sadly.
Chuckling softly, Draco shook his head. “Not necessarily, but I’m going to continue studying potions. Maybe open an apothecary or something.”
Draco laughed softly. “Well I’m glad you think that, Harry. I slept amazingly well.” He admitted with a small smile. “You’re a nice, um, bed partner.”
Harry chuckled, easily reading the expression on Draco’s face. “No, they haven’t. Granted, I’ve never claimed any of the others before.” He grinned, leaning forwards to press a light kiss to Draco’s forehead. “I think the claiming is a bit more…exhausting then my normal feeding, you know?”
Harry snorted, pulling Draco over into his lap to feed. “Poor, innocent Malfoy? You? You’re about as poor and innocent as a Basilisk, and twice as likely to bite.”
"You sure about that?" Harry smirked and Draco's ears turned pink. "That's what I thought." Harry chuckled and took out the clear vial. "Ahh yes, I think we'll make good use of this. Clothes off, now." he commanded, already starting on his own.
Exams passed quickly and before Draco knew it his N.E.W.T.S were taken and it was time to pack up and head back home. He packed up his trunk slowly, taking his time as he looked around what were once his and Harry’s chambers, allowing his senses to absorb one final memory of the place.
Behind him Draco heard noise and Harry’s grip on the blonde tightened as he spun around to face McGonagall and Severus. “No!” he snarled, shielding Draco with his body as the wizards raised their wands. “He’s mine! Mine!” Then he fell under the wizard’s Stunners.
Panic welling in his chest, Draco’s eyes darted over to Ron and Hermione, standing on the other side of Harry’s bed. The look of pity on the two Gryffindor’s faces was what finally broke Draco. Without another look at Harry Draco ducked his head and sprinted out of the Hospital Wing, the doors slamming closed behind him.
The end is in sight!
Blaise rolled his eyes good naturedly, ruffling Draco’s hair with mild protestations from the blonde. “Whatever you say, Draco.” He smiled. “It’s nice to have you back, though. The dorms just haven’t been the same without you.”
The Vampire pulled back, licking at the wound he had made for a moment before he answered his difficult mate. “If I remember correctly, mate, it was
Turning his attention back to Bellatrix, Harry smiled, showing his fangs. There was a cracking, ripping sound and then Bellatrix’s head was rolling on the floor, eyes staring blankly at the other Death Eaters. Harry stood slowly, wings spread, and turned to face the remaining wizards. The evil grin that spread across his lips mixed with the carnage surrounding him was more than enough to send them running. Within moments Harry was alone, the only sound the dripping of Voldemort’s blood as it ran down the throne, pooling  at his feet.
The blonde snorted, snatching his hand away from where Harry had been playing with his fingers. “Inconvenience? That’s what you’re calling this, Potter? This is so much more than just an inconvenience. You want to take my blood, the essence of my life!”
"You're not dead yet," Draco said, voice cracking.
“Of course.” Hermione nodded, standing up and offering Draco her hand. “If you need any help of anyone to talk to, we’re always here.” She announced, ignoring Ron’s horrified expression.
“Sh-should I go in there?” A voice—Draco’s—asked in fear. The sound was music to Harry’s ears and he could feel the hunger surge within him, wanting to break free.
“I’m going to take you.” Harry purred sweetly against his ear. “I’m going to take you and have you and make you mine. I’m going to make you want… you’re going to want so much…” he grinned, nipping gently at Draco’s ear and smirking as the blonde squeaked. “I’m going to make you want me until nothing else in the world exists.”
really hungry... "Fine. I'll answer."
The headmaster shook his head, expression still calm. “As of yet we do not know exactly what Harry is, Mr. Malfoy, but I can assure you that the situation is completely under control. We have Mr. Potter locked in a room warded for all the creatures that he may have been infected with.”
"Well it looks like you'll have to take one after all." Ron sighed, picking up one of the vials and looking at the thick clear liquid in it. "Don't drink this one, it looks too much like hair gel."
"Hello, Malfoy." Harry smirked widely. "It
Harry frowned and shook his head. "No...I feel the same. Hopefully this was either the nighttime one or the wildest dreams come true one. But I still want to find out who sent it. Come on, let's go to breakfast."
“No, Mr. Malfoy, you do not.” McGonagall nodded. “Without your blood Harry could die and I’m afraid we cannot let that happen.”
One more chapter to go~
Quickly Draco nodded, the very sight of Harry’s fangs spurring him on to get away. In moments he was out the door, the solid wood thunking closed behind him.
Harry stood there for a moment before smirking slightly to himself as he watched Draco go. He was pretty sure by the slight wobble in Draco's legs that that kiss was as good for him as it was for Harry. Without another deep thought about what had happened (over thinking things could be dangerous), Harry went to potions. He had a gift giver to find.
Slowly, Harry nodded, his brow furrowed as he tried to remember his best friend’s faces. “Yes…I think I remember.”
There was a knock on the door to Draco and Harry’s quarters early in the morning on the fourth day of Harry’s disappearance. So early that the sun had yet to break over the horizon, turning the dismal gray night into the light of dawn.
“Are you sure he’s not up to something?” Harry asked his best friend, squinting across the hall at a shocking head of blonde hair. Several weeks had passed since the “Draco Malfoy incident” as Harry was wont to call the Slytherin’s dramatic entrance and equally dramatic exit from the Hospital Wing.
good…”
Harry blinked, looking down at the necklace in surprise, as if just noticing its existence. “This thing? I…” he trailed off, face screwing up in concentration as he tried to remember. But there was no memory of its previous existence to be found. “I’m not quite sure.” He shrugged. “I guess someone gave it to me. It…I like it.” He murmured softly, unwilling to admit that wearing it gave him comfort. Harry didn’t know how to explain it, but wearing the pendant helped to anchor him. Like it was holding him together and without it he would shatter into a million pieces.
That seemed to please the vampire and Harry stopped visibly bristling, nodding a little. “Fine.”
“But Harry…” Draco breathed, gathering enough courage to gently cup Harry’s chin in his hand. “You’ll die without me.”
Trembling, Draco squeaked and struggled, Harry’s muscular arms more than enough to hold the struggling blonde down. A soft hum came from Harry’s throat and, though he did his best to resist it, Draco soon found himself relaxing, and eventually he stopped fighting. With quick movements Draco’s pants were pulled off and tossed on the floor, but in his Siren Song filled mind the gesture barely registered.
Hey guys!
Harry laughed softly and kissed the top of the Slytherin's head. "Best Christmas present ever."
For many years I have watch you from afar
, he thought.
he thought as Harry looked at him. Draco quickly looked away and got started on Step 2 of his genius plan.
“Ah yes,
of all times to leave his room?
"THEN EAT THEM GOD DAMMIT!" the voice shouted. So Harry opened the box, took out a Dark square piece of chocolate, and ate it. It took Harry a moment to figure out that the chocolates had some kind of unidentifiable liquid filling, but by then it was too late. "Argh!" Harry shouted in disgust as a terrible taste filled his mouth. He felt a heat flush through his body, certain parts of his anatomy getting all tingly, so Harry decided to eat another chocolate. This time he decided to go with a white shell that seemed from the outside to have nothing in the inside. When he bit into it, however, Harry found that it was indeed filled with some clear tasteless liquid that was currently running down his throat.
"Oh Harry." Ron interrupted the dark haired boy's train of thought as he caught sight of the box. "Have you figured out who gave that to you yet?"
Harry could feel the other man behind him, could sense his presence, but Lucius did nothing. The Death Eater regarded her cooling for a few moments before he turned away. “She is yours, Potter.” He murmured before he strode from the room, going in search of his wife. As always, the preservation of his family won out against whatever duty he still had to the fallen Dark Lord.
It took Draco several moments to notice the silence that surrounded him; too long. He froze in his tracks, realizing his mistake. Silencing spells, he could feel them now. Swallowing hard, Draco slowly drew his wand from his pocket and gripped it tightly, ready to fight and defend himself if the occasion arrived. He looked around, ears pricked and ready for any sound. But there were no noises from the dark, and even his footsteps made no sound within the deep confines of the spell. He took a few more steps before he paused, finally making something out through the muffled silence.
Harry smiled a little. "I love you." he whispered before his eyes closed and his fingers went absolutely limp in Draco's hand.
A low growl erupted from Harry's throat and Draco was struck by just how incredibly sexy it was. For a moment Harry was tempted to refuse and try to walk away, leaving Draco there...but then his brain registered what exactly Draco had said. "Wait...did you just say please?"
Harry sighed, tongue flicking out to wet his lips. “I’m sorry, Liam, but I really need to feed.”
"Well," Draco said as they heard the sound of benches being pushed back in the Great Hall, "Time for Step 2." Blaise rolled his eyes with a sneer and nodded, following Draco down to the dungeons.
Harry twitched in agitation again. "W-would you come with me?"
But then the Irishman grinned again and laughed, winking at his boyfriend. "Ah but that would be telling." he said with another roguish grin. Ron threw a pillow at him, which Seamus easily ducked, and the group of boys got ready for the day.
how good it felt to have him drinking his blood?
“Mmm…yes?” Harry purred and Draco jumped as strong arms wrapped around him, seemingly out of nowhere. “I know you, don’t I?”
Nodding, the vampire forced himself to back down, sitting next to Draco on the couch and pulling his knees to his chest. There was a long pause of silence as they were each lost in their own thoughts before Harry finally spoke, his voice barely above a whisper. “Do you want to lock me in my room again?” he asked almost sadly.
Sighing, Draco nodded. “It’s better for everyone if I’m not here, Harry. There’s just too much of a chance that Ron will say something wrong to me, we aren’t exactly friends, you know? And I don’t want you ripping out your best friend’s throat.” Draco explained gently, running a hand through Harry’s hair.
“Italy.” Blaise answered vaguely, gesturing with a hand through the air. “My parents want me to start…studying my father’s work."
. His hands scrambled for purchase in Draco’s wet locks, finally managing to twist through them almost painfully and grab hold as Draco licked and sucked his way down his shaft. Never before had the vampire felt something as good as what Draco was doing to him with lips, tongue, and teeth, and the pleasure coursing through him seemed to sear all the way down to his DNA. Within moments there was heat coiling within the pit of his stomach and he tugged sharply on Draco’s hair in warning, trying to pull the blonde off.
Spinning around, Draco raised his wand, pointing it straight at the man who had seemingly just appeared, leaning against a store wall at the entrance to an alley. “What do you want?” he growled, something about the man making the hairs at the back of his neck prickle. The man just looked at him, the upper half of his face in shadows, before Draco caught a flash of white. He shuddered as he realized what he’d seen: fangs.
“Is it ready?” Voldemort asked Snape harshly, staring the Potions Master down.
A frown crossed Draco’s lips as Harry stopped feeding, knowing it certainly couldn’t have been enough for the starving vampire. “Keep drinking.” He growled.
Harry needed no prompting and without further ado he attacked Draco's mouth, kissing him with amounts of tongue that should be illegal.
Harry stayed in the swirling, white void, a soft smile across his lips, the same smile as was on his body. At last he was at peace.
Trying not to swallow in fear, Severus nodded, holding out a vial of a dark and swirling liquid. “Yes, My Lord. The potion is complete. If I may ask, My Lord, what is this potion to be used for? It’s rather unpredictable, and if used in the wrong circumstances it could have terrible consequences.” He barely resisted the temptation to flinch back as Voldemort turned, giving him a cold and bone-chilling look.
We have met, oh yes we have met,
“Preposterous?!” the blonde man rounded on Dumbledore as his eyes flashed. “Uncalled for?! There’s a bloody vampire in the school and you dare to say it’s uncalled for for me to be concerned for my son’s safety?!”
"Well that's a new feature..." Draco murmured thoughtfully as he looked up at the little decoration.
It wasn’t until the second day of his captivity that Harry had a visitor, the soft knocking on the door more than enough to tell him who was on the other side. He moved off the bed, leaving the warmth of the other sleeping teen, exhausted after another round of feeding. As the door cracked open he quickly pulled on a dressing robe, not wanted to scare Narcissa Malfoy with his nudity.
"C-can't see." he whimpered
For a couple long minutes Draco was silent, still trying to understand just what Harry was saying. The vampire wanted him, and not just for one night? He felt his chest become warm again at the thought and he slowly nodded. “Yes, that…that’s okay. You were right, I have been waiting for someone, I just never thought I’d have him.”
As time passes, Harry and Draco get to know each other better and slowly their bond develops. When a revelation is presented, Draco realizes just how far he's fallen.
.” Hermione answered, a frown crossing her lips at Draco’s sharp intake of breath.
That despite this all I have decided to give myself one chance.
Been accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardr-"
Here it is, the real ending.
From what little Draco had been privy to pertaining to the Dark Lord’s plan, he knew that Harry had been infected with the blood of several Dark creatures. He only knew of the Vampire, Incubus, Werewolf, Banshee, and Undead, but Draco was certain that Potter had been infected with countless others. Which would dominate and take form inside of Harry, however, no one would know until the time came.
"Sevi-Kins." Snape muttered in disguised. "I'll get that pompous little bimbo for that one." he scowled to himself as he trudged to the dungeons. Everything was WAY to pink and frilly for his liking today. And Lucius had even gotten him to wash his hair, making the day even more perfectly horrible.
Smirking, Harry got on his knees and dragged Draco's trousers down as well, licking his lips. "Yes, let's."
Slowly Harry nodded, able to feel the creatures’ power flowing through his veins. “Thank you.” He murmured softly. “Your son is safe with me, I promise.”
“Bullshit.” Ron exclaimed the moment Draco had finished his story, shaking his head. “Why should we believe that you’re Harry’s mate? You two have hated each other since the moment you met.”
"That too." Ron said sheepishly. "So Hermione can we..."
“That necklace.” Ron nodded to the pendant that Harry’s fingers were still gently caressing, as if without conscious thought. “Where’d you get it?”
Both professors stepped over, neither of them affording Draco a smile. Even Severus looked worried, something that Draco knew to fear. “Draco, a Incubus is a creature of pure lust and desire. They have attributes that allow them to capture and seduce their prey. To put it bluntly…they feed off orgasmic energy. That’s also why they’re so popular as sex slaves,” he muttered darkly. “Now. I’m not sure how much of the Incubus will show up in Potter; the last time I checked his blood the Vampire’s virus was consuming everything. I could actually see it converting Potter’s cells and the other infections.” He paused, taking a deep breath. “There may also be a trace of Siren left in him, though luckily that creature complements the Incubus. From what I can tell, Potter will be able to sprout wings at will, his voice will be able to placate his victims, he’ll drink blood, and he will have an insatiable craving for sex.” He recited these in the same voice he would use to list Potion ingredients.
Draco grumbled against his chest. “No, I didn’t!” he protested weakly. “I just didn’t want him to hurt you, that’s all.”
Slowly, grudgingly, the pair of Gryffindors nodded. “We’re sorry for doubting you.” Hermione finally said gently. “Once you two are more settled,” Ron winced at the word, looking slightly ill at the thought of his best friend and worst enemy being together like that, “will you allow us to see him? It…it might do him good to see us again.”
Spluttering, Draco found himself without words, unable to answer the Vampire’s silky questions. He couldn’t admit that. He couldn’t admit that he
“And Hermione Granger is not stupid.” Draco sighed, running a hand through his hair. “You are correct, I’m involved, though I didn’t want to be.”
be Potter’s intended?”
"And the other one?" Harry asked, arching an eyebrow when Draco flushed dark red. He looked at the vial of clear almost gel and a dark smile spread across his lips. "Ahhh...something to make the nighttime even more spectacular, indeed. You're a sly snake, Malfoy."
"You know me too well." Draco said with a sigh. "So what'd you get for Pansy anyways?" he asked with a snort.
"And YOU" Snape reminded him, "need to be getting ready for your joyous class with the flamboyant Hufflepuffles. " Lucius scowled at him but nodded.
Draco snorted. "Drop the act Zabini." he growled, making Blaise scowl at him. "Of course I did, I'm not about to let this wonderful opportunity pass me up." he finished with a smirk.
A flush rose in Draco’s cheeks and he rested against Harry’s chest, letting his head loll back on his shoulder to bare the tantalizing side of his throat to the Vampire. “Want your breakfast, Harry?” Draco practically purred.
~The End~
Contained in this box are three very different potions. One will make you mine forever, one will make all your wildest dreams come true, and the last will make the nighttime even more spectacular. Choose wisely, love, I look forward to your final decision. ~ WD'
“After many blood and magic tests, Severus has managed to identify the makeup of the virus inside of Harry. Using that makeup he has created a potion that can help suppress the creatures inside of Harry, making them go dormant. He’ll have to take the potion daily once it starts being effective, but besides that both of your lives will be able to go back to normal and you can put this nasty incident behind you.”
Again Harry let out a growl, his muscles tensed, ready to pounce. “You were touching my
“You do know, don’t lie to me. He was going to take you and it would kill me. But he couldn’t take you.” Harry purred and a feral smile curled across his lips. “He also wanted to punish you, hoping that you would be ravaged by the monster I became. He hoped I would rape and rip you apart.” He licked his lips, as though the thought was more than slightly appealing to the beasts within him. “I will kill him. He wanted to turn me into a monster, to destroy Harry Potter and only leave the beast within. So I’ll be the monster and I’ll kill him.”
Draco was stunned when Dumbledore gave him the news. So stunned, in fact, that for a few moments he had been positive that the old coot was joking. But no, Dumbledore was in fact very, very serious. He was going to let Harry and Draco out to go to Hogsmeade together.
With that Harry leapt at her, claws raking along her throat. Bellatrix screamed and struggled, but no one dared come to her aid. “Lucius!” she screamed, eyes pleading as Harry’s hands wrapped around her throat. “Lucius please!”
“There’s enough Harry Potter left in me to stop from doing that, yes.” The dark haired man nodded, setting his book on the nightstand and rolling over to look at Draco, tentatively reaching out to brush his hair from his forehead with the tips of his fingers. “But you’re not afraid of me, or the Incubus that resides deep within me, taking advantage of you as you sleep?” he asked curiously.
“A neglectful mate.” Harry teased lightly. “Although, I wouldn’t blame you for being reluctant to share our bed with a vampire and whatever else I turn out to be.”
Draco’s heart jumped in his throat, hammering hard as a wave of longing and need washed over him. They held each other’s gaze for what seemed to Draco like an eternity, the bite mark on his arm going from tingling to a throbbing pain. They looked at each other for so long that Draco began to feel a little hope. A spark that maybe, just maybe Harry would defy the odds and remember.
Pansy arched a doubtful eyebrow and decided that an evil smile didn't count as a real smile since it was evil. "And how on earth did you manage that?" she asked.
"Dear Mr. Potter,
But maybe, someday… Draco thought connivingly as he slipped back into his rooms, someday he could use that to his advantage. It wouldn’t hurt to have the Golden Boy wrapped around his finger, blood-sucking monster or not.
Draco thought faintly as the warmth blossomed across his skin.
A soft snort escaped Draco’s lips as he heard Harry say that. “I don’t really have a choice in that matter, Potter.” He said before he paused, his voice softening a bit. “And it wasn’t all terrible yesterday.”
Sighing, Draco shook his head, rubbing his eyes tiredly. “I’m not going to decide that now.” He said firmly, uncurling from his position and stretching his arms over his head. He glanced at his forearm and made a face. “Did you really have to do that, Harry?” he asked with a small pout.
We will have fun with strawberries and whipped cream.
“Yeah.” Blaise nodded, having found his voice again. “We were just hanging out and talking.” He said, wiping at his mouth.
Almost immediately a pink flush spread across Draco’s cheeks. Was that why he was acting this way, so differently from his usual nature towards the vampire? “Of course not.” Draco scoffed, crossing his arms over his chest in a defensive gesture. “I just don’t want to go to Azkaban, which is where I’ll end up if you die.”
Draco’s eyes widened and he pressed his face to the glass, hardly able to believe his eyes as the rolling waves of fog parted in front of the figure. He was walking slowly up the path from the front gate, unruly hair and bright green eyes unmistakable, even from a distance. But what made Draco gasp and jump to his feet wasn’t Harry’s return, but the skull, a length of spine still attached, that hung by his side, held limp by his hand.
"Don't wanna." he mumbled.
"Told you, I'm sitting next to you," he said as patiently as he could. "Relax, love. I'm here."
Harry took his seat at the Gryffindor table and smiled happily. He just knew that the day ahead would be filled with chocolate and flowers and chocolate and more chocolate and even more chocolate sent by the fangirls who all wanted to have his babies. Suffice to say, Harry Potter really liked chocolate.
The Slytherin chewed nervously on his lip and also looked up. "Might as well try that first..." he murmured. Harry didn't need telling twice and in a second Draco found himself with an armful of Gryffindor who seemed quite intent in licking his tonsils.
“Al-alright.” Liam nodded, the tension leaving his shoulder. “What do I need to do?”
The blonde teen glared up at Dumbledore. “You try letting a Vampire drink your blood and see how much you like it,” he growled.
As the time passed and Draco found the deadline of his time with Harry fast approaching, he’d come to realize that he wanted it. He wanted to have that between them, even if it was only something for him to remember Harry by. He wanted to really and truly belong to Harry before the young man and his affections were ripped from his grasp.
The chambers were quiet and lonely without Harry’s presence gracing the rooms, but Draco couldn’t bear to be anywhere else. He couldn’t stand the thought of going back to his dorm, where he’d have to pretend that he wasn’t being ripped apart inside. Where he’d have to pretend that everything was alright.
Nodding a little, Draco curled up even tighter, closing his eyes tightly. “I-I didn’t know that I…that I couldn’t kiss other blokes.” He explained quietly. “I thought…you just needed my blood. I didn’t…I didn’t know it would anger you.” He murmured, voice wet with the tears that ran down his cheeks.
"And...what makes it so wonderful, Draco dear?" Pansy said carefully, ready to bolt if Draco started smiling. "Did you get any good presents?"
Ron shook his head, burying it in her hair. "They're WAY too loud and I really don't want to know what they're doing with whatever it is Seamus got them." he mumbled.
“As opposed to what?” Draco asked with a frown, looking down at his hand, the wounds from Harry’s teeth once again gone.
Draco, still cussing under his breath, chanced a glance up at the Gryffindor's table and his eyes immediately locked onto Harry. To Draco's amusement the boy was practically gaping at him, his eyes once-overing him every five seconds or so. Things were going better than planned.
“Don’t hurt Dumbledore, Harry.” Draco murmured before he sat up. “Coming, Headmaster!” he called, inwardly cursing the old man for interrupting their moment, but knowing nonetheless that the Headmaster would only come if it was urgent. He turned to Harry, giving him a feeble smile. “We’ll continue this later, alright? Once we figure out what he wants.”
For a few moments Draco gaped after him, leg still tingling from where Harry had brushed up against his upper thigh. Gathering his resolve, and with a light prod to his back from Blaise behind him, Draco swallowed and exited the train, stepping down onto the bustling platform below. His mother was easy enough to spot; her brilliant blonde hair practically glowing even as steam from the train swirled around her. His father’s absence was hardly a surprise, not after everything he had done. Due to extenuating circumstances and his, however unintentional, hand in the Dark Lord’s death, Lucius Malfoy had been placed under house arrest until further notice, and the family’s assets had been handed over to his mother for safe keeping.
“But you think I’m involved?” Draco added on helpfully and Hermione nodded.
“Bring him to me.” The voice slithered out of the darkness, wrapping around the Death Eaters and making all but the most battle hardened shudder in fear. “Bring me my monster.”
"Sorry." Harry muttered, telling himself firmly to not look the other boy over. He made to push past Draco but found he couldn't take more than a step in either direction. "What the..."
But hopefully for now chocolate will suffice.
Sniffling, Draco let out a wet chuckle. “I bet. Any new developments I should know about?” he asked, the realization of just how distanced he’d been since Harry was turned finally hitting him. For those few months it had been just the two of them: him and Harry. He hadn’t realized just how much he missed his friends, spending time with them, just getting to…talk.
The vampire shook his head. “With your blood I will live.” He murmured, neglecting to mention that without his mate he would most likely go into withdrawal and kill himself through bodily neglect. If Draco would be happier without him then Harry would let him go.
Draco hurried over to sit by his friends and Harry just barely caught his eye. The Slytherin's cheeks blushed red and he quickly looked away as Harry smirked knowingly. Harry turned back to Ron and Hermione. "It definitely wasn't from Malfoy. Maybe another Slytherin was trying to set him up." he told them firmly.
“No, you may not ask, Severus,” Voldemort hissed coldly, long fingers closing tightly around the potion vial and slipping it into the pocket of his robes. “It is none of your concern. You will know its purpose soon enough, as long as it works as you promised. If it does not…” he warned, tone deadly, “there will be consequences.”
Draco realized. Should he lie or should he let Potter know
"Draco..." his lips mouthed again, as if he was murmuring the name quietly.
“Hmmm, what?” Draco murmured sleepily, blinking up at Harry in surprise with rather glazed and clouded eyes. Slowly they cleared and Draco frowned. “What…what was that?”
Seeing the trust and acceptance in the other’s eyes, Harry nodded and let go, allowing the Incubus to take over completely. It would be better if he couldn’t remember this; this moment he had so long denied Draco and yet was giving to another.
“Okay.” Draco finally mumbled, trying to keep the deep emptiness that threatened to consume him out of his voice as he started trembling. “Thank you for informing me, Headmaster.”
"Yeah, well what'd you get Dean?" Ron shot back, which quieted Seamus up considerably.
“Oh dear,” Harry murmured, shying even more away from Draco. “You had better go.” But Draco’s eyes had slipped shut and he seemed to not have heard, instead feeling oddly and completely at peace. A low growl rumbled from Harry’s throat as hunger swept through him, making him tremble with desire. “Go!” Harry shouted, finally getting Draco’s attention.
When infecting Harry, Voldemort had assumed that using multiple creatures’ blood would give Harry the characteristics and dispositions of those different creatures. That was the first of many mistakes that the Dark Lord made.
By this time Draco was panting, the words spilling from Harry’s lips and his actions sending fire coursing through his skin. A voice in the back of his head had made itself known, presenting the idea that maybe, just maybe, having a Vampire ravish him wouldn’t be all that terrible. For now Draco was able to resist the voice, pushing it away and willing it silent, but he knew that eventually he’d give in, eventually he’d listen. He’d ignored the voice before, and the voice had been right. His choice not to listen had caused him pain, so much pain…he wouldn’t make that mistake again. “Potter…” he breathed, unable to get out much more before the Vampire spun on the spot, apparating them away from the street. The crack of apparation faded away and sound returned to the street. It was as though Draco Malfoy had never set foot there.
“Draco? Harry?” Dumbledore called from their front rooms. “I need to speak with you.”
"Now, now Lucius." Snape said, pushing the blonde off of him. "That'll have to wait for later, I have a class full of sodding Gryffindors and your son to get to."
When Madam Pomfrey found him Draco hadn’t moved from his spot, still lost in thought and half asleep from the exhaustion of his ordeal. Instead of lecturing him about not coming to see her, the medi-witch had simply found him some clothes, helped him to his feet, and supported him as they went up to the hospital wing, and for that Draco would be eternally grateful. Only a few murmured words were exchanged between the two as Madam Pomfrey helped him settle on the bed and gave him his potion.
Harry smirked, pulling the box of vials out of his pockets. "Now Malfoy, what are these other potions?" he asked calmly, although his voice held a hint of warning.
to put you back in your old rooms. I won’t harm anyone else.”
“Then I shall die.” Harry shrugged his shoulders. “I will not take blood from you when you are unwilling. I would die anyways if I did that.” He sighed softly. “And I won’t force you to do anything that you don’t wish to do.”
The blonde shifted uncomfortably, looking up at Harry wearily. “Don’t do that.” He mumbled. “It’s freaking me out.” He admitted quietly. When Harry had first thrown him onto the couch he had been almost certain the vampire was going to have his way with him, something Draco couldn’t tell if he was afraid or excited for. But instead the furious vampire had branded him and now Draco didn’t know quite where they stood.
Harry gave Draco a weak smile and a slight shrug of his shoulders. “You found pleasure and release, that’s all that matters.”
Draco paled a bit. "S-so what if I did?" he tried to spit out but his voice was slightly shaky. He folded his arms across his chest as a protection mechanism. "So, are you going to help me or not?" he tried for petulant.
Draco stifled another moan, nodding slightly. “Yeah, I can.” He answered, some of his usual snark present in his voice. “I’m the one who invented them, after all. If I knew they would help you maybe I wouldn’t have.”
"I know what he got her!" our boy Harry crowed. "I saw him hiding it under his bed. Of course he got her the normal jewelry and all that, but he also got her a can of whipped cream, a pair of purple sparkly handcuffs, and a gallon of chocolate sauce." Harry finished to the shouts of laughter from the other boys.
Immediately Draco's face turned bright red. Potter could only mean...oh god, this was turning out to be the best Christmas Draco had ever had. "You-you can't be serious." he stuttered.
When the hunger disappeared Harry pulled back, licking gently over Draco’s skin to heal the vicious wound. He frowned as he noticed Draco had passed out, his mug of hot chocolate shattered on the floor. His frown deepened as he shifted slightly against the other young man and felt a hardness pressing against his leg. He sighed softly as he noticed the remarkable bulge in Draco’s trousers, restraining himself as he remembered what the potions professor had said about drinking closer to Draco’s heart. Harry would not hurt his mate, would not give into his repressed desire, until the other allowed it. Even if that time was never.
“Yes.” Harry answered with a nod, unseen in the gloom of the room. “I would never hurt Draco. He is my mate.”
“I guess, yeah.” Draco grumbled, peaking up at Blaise with a petulant glare. “You don’t have to sound so excited about it, you know. He hates me again. He hates me and…and we never even got to shag.” He huffed, trying to get his anger at Harry for forgetting him to overshadow the emptiness that had taken up residence inside his chest. It didn’t work.
The wound Harry made was vicious, spurred on by his anger and need to posses the blonde screaming and writhing in pain beneath him. Finally Harry pulled back, giving the vicious bite mark a few licks so that it would scar stark and red over Draco’s perfect porcelain skin.
P.S. I hope you find the fillings to your liking"
"Oh fuck, not you!" A voice Harry recognized came from under him. He looked down to see he had landed on top of one Draco Malfoy...and they were now in a rather compromising position. Quickly Harry scrambled off the Slytherin, willing away the rather erotic fantasies that came to mind when his gaze caught the blonde boy looking rather disheveled.
Not long after, and much too quickly for Draco’s taste, he could feel the heat of impending release coiling in his lower stomach, waiting for the precise moment to break free. “Harry.” He gasped, voice rough and husky. “Harry, I-I’m not going to last much longer.” He warned.
“Do you want something to eat or drink?” he asked graciously as Draco sat down, his smile flashing fangs. “They told me this time I should offer you something, calm you down.” He looked at Draco expectantly.
Inside Harry, the power and strength of each creature were fighting those of the others (most of them natural born enemies) for dominance in Harry’s body. The blood of the Vampire quickly consumed the Undead virus, feeding off of Harry’s magical power. Although Vampires are born of blood, their power comes from that of the wizard. Therefore, the more powerful the wizard, the faster the infection would spread. That was the second mistake that Voldemort made.
The little girl let out an "Eep!" and fled from the scene as Draco swore under his breath and looked at the sopping state of his robes. Harry watched happily as Draco ripped said robes off and vanished them. To Harry's great joy the Slytherin seemed to wear only a black tight fitted tank top under his robes along with a plain, crisp white button down shirt, which was also soaked through with juice.
Ron shrugged, biting into another one of the truffles Hermione had gotten him. "He's probably searching for that mystery sender of chocolates of his, or he's crying alone in a dark and shadowing corner." he said.
Letting out a soft sigh, Draco nodded. “Thank you, Harry. I-I don’t know how much you can remember about before you were turned, but, well, there’s this man… and he’ll probably try to kill me at some point in time. Most likely in the very near future.”
"See yah, Malfoy." Harry smirked and stalked past Draco, no longer trapped under the mistletoe. The blonde blinked and stood there for a moment before slowly making his way to lunch.
A bright smile spread across Harry’s face and the young Vampire leaped out of bed, scrambling to get suitably naked. He joined Draco in the shower moments later, wrapping his arms around his chest and pulling the blonde close. “You’re so pretty.” He murmured, nuzzling Draco’s sweet smelling, pale neck.
, Draco! Mine and mine alone!”
! You cannot touch him!”
"Positive." Draco lied through his teeth. "Now will you please help me get out of here?"
him!” Harry hissed, pure fury shining in his eyes. “You’re
"Did you listen?" He asked, watching him nervously.
, a helpful little voice provided in the back of his mind.
“Harry.” Draco whispered, sounding lost as he nearly melted at the sight of the vampire. Harry wasn’t gone yet, he hadn’t been ripped from Draco. There was still time. “Harry.” Draco repeated, swallowing as he stood and slowly made his way over to the other teen. Warmth spread through Draco’s chest as he reached the vampire, pulling the being into his arms.
"You're fucking gorgeous!"
Harry shook his head and pressed a secretive finger to his lips. "I want to know for certain first."
Quickly Harry nodded. “I will keep him at bay whenever I’m in your presence. He will not harm you.” He promised, unaware how hard it would be to stay true to that one simple sentence. “I would only come out at night, once it’s dark.”
Harry didn’t know how it happened. All he knew was that one moment he was waiting for his and Draco’s drinks at the Three Broomsticks and the next everything went dark: when he awoke it was to find himself on a bed, in the middle of a large, dark room.
“That Harry has been infected by Vampirism and for some reason is quite protective of
“Because that’s not creepy at all.” Draco murmured before he yawned, glancing at Harry. “How’d you sleep? Did, um, sleeping with me help?” he asked, blushing lightly.
After a few moments so that Draco could have time to catch his breath, Harry pulled away slightly, ignoring his still present and prevalent erection in favor of fumbling around with the soap to wash Draco with.
Draco's cheeks turned even redder until even his ears were pink. "No." Tentatively he unclasped Harry's robes and slipped them off his shoulders. Then he took a deep breath and quickly undid Harry's shirt buttons with practiced fingers. That too was slipped off of the Gryffindor's shoulders and Draco had to resist the temptation to turn into a puddle of drool at the sight of Harry's well-defined chest.
Once he was alert enough to notice Harry’s actions as the brunette started gently washing Draco’s body, he frowned, catching the hand containing the soap. “What about you?”
A smug look crossed Draco’s lips at Harry’s reaction and he tossed the Vampire a shirt. “Good boy. Now get dressed. You’ll feed and then we can go.”
At that Blaise looked awkwardly down at the floor, avoiding Draco’s eyes as he rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly. “Umm…I…” he trailed off, cheeks tinting pink.
“You’re not supposed to be here, are you?” Harry asked with an arched eyebrow, seeing the outline of the woman stiffen at his words.
Draco gasped, nodding. "Yeah, it's me Harry. Please, you need to make a decision."
Draco felt the Gryffindor's eyes run over his body and shivered, wondering which potion the boy had taken. But then the dark haired boy wrenched his eyes away and sat down and Draco sighed, looking at his two friends who were giving him weirded out looks. "Just wait and see."
“You’re my mate, of course you find me attractive.” Harry waved him casually off. “And I most definitely do
A small smile crossed Harry’s lips. “I am truly sorry for what…
, Harry thought,
Taking a long swig, the alcohol burning down his throat deliciously, a wide smile broke across Draco’s lips. “You always know just what I need, Blaise.”
A sly grin spread across Draco’s lips as he regarded his friend. “Ah, so you’re a bottom now too, then? My my, things
Hermione and Ron looked up from their spots at the one long Christmas table to see Harry swaggering into the Great Hall with a self-satisfied smirk. He slid into the empty seat across from them and grinned. "Hey guys, sorry I'm late."
Draco's eyes stared at him, filled with something Harry had never seen there before. "Potter." he warned. "Potter I think I'm..." He paused, taking deep breathes, his eyes now half-hooded. "Harry I think I'm going to..."
Harry looked up and scanned the classroom. Nobody seemed to be so suspicious, except the blond Slytherin.
“Will it hurt?” Draco asked quietly, his body yearning for what Harry had asked and his heart clenching at the news that Potter had wanted him just as he had wanted Potter. “Will…will you kill me?
Draco smiled against Harry’s lips as the kiss deepened, spiraling towards more intimate contact. Maybe Valentine’s Day wasn’t so bad after all.
“That doesn’t matter.” Draco shook his head, swallowing hard. “The Dark Lord placed my DNA into the virus he used to infect Potter so that he would recognize me and me alone as his mate. Look.” He slowly pulled up the sleeve of his robes, showing the skeptical ginger his left forearm and the vicious scar tissue that resided there, proclaiming to everyone who saw it that Draco Malfoy belonged to Harry Potter and Harry Potter alone. “This is all the proof you need.”
“Oh, and Malfoy?” Hermione called to his retreating back. “If you hurt him we’ll dismember you.” She warned seriously.
At his table, working with Neville, Harry was minding his own business as usual. "Hey, Harry." Neville asked, while attempting to put the wrong ingredients into their cauldron. Harry quickly grabbed the dried up chrysanthemum from Neville's hand as the boy continued what he was going to say before being so rudely interrupted by the author's narration. "Hey, Harry. I saw you got a huge box of chocolate this morning. Who's it from?"
Smirking, Harry nodded. “Now everyone knows who you belong to.” He said, sounding overly pleased.
Draco panted as feeling crashed over him, spinning through and confusing his senses. There was pleasure, there was pain, and then something else entwining the two, making them one and the same. Draco craved more, loving the feeling of Harry’s firm heat filling and stretching him, but needing it deeper within himself. He bucked his hips down and moaned, hearing an answering noise of pleasure from the man lapping at his neck. He had expected the feeling of Harry drinking from him to hurt, but it was a dull ache, easily overwhelmed by the sparks of fire singing through his veins as his blood was pulled from his body. It was a heady feeling, making him dizzy when combined with the feel of Harry’s cock slipping in and out of him, butting his prostate ever stroke or two.
, Draco thought to himself.
picture.” Harry hummed, hand leaving Draco’s crotch to tweak and tug at a nipple, eliciting another hiss of pleasure from the man beneath him. “I’ve always had a particular weakness for blondes. A craving, I suppose you could call it. I blame you for that influence.” He chuckled softly, licking his lips. “Now tell me,
"You'll be here when I wake?" Harry asked quietly.
Draco frowned, linking his and Harry's fingers together gently. "Harry, it's ok. I'm with you. I'm sitting right next to you on the bed."
"So you did it then?" Blaise asked when they reached the Entrance Hall, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed.
Slowly Draco nodded. “Alright.” He finally agreed. “Just don’t go watching me in my sleep or anything creepy like that.”
Giving Draco a stern, hard look, Madam Pomfrey checked his vitals again with her wand and reluctantly agreed. “Alright, Mr. Malfoy, you may leave. But no strenuous activity for the rest of the day, and you must promise to eat a decent dinner and rest.”
Hi there! Smut is ahead, oh my! You have been warned.
Draco was rather ashamed of the low moan that erupted from his throat as Harry's tongue slipped into his mouth and slid against his. Really as a Malfoy he should have more self control...but then again as a Malfoy he should also make the most of this situation.
"Looks like your potions weren't good after all." he laughed. "Looks like you're going to need a better mating call." Harry groaned as he realized he rhymed again. "SHIT!"
Almost a month passed and Draco was true to his word. Every day he came to Harry’s room so that the vampire could feed from his throat. Although he left the door to Harry’s room unlocked, he had yet to venture forth into the rest of Draco’s chambers, afraid of invading his mate’s privacy.
“Um, Harry?” Ron asked tentatively, relief flooding him as the distant, lost look faded from Harry’s eyes and he blinked.
"Harry, you have to make a choice!" Draco said firmly. "Please!"
Harry frowned and took a step back, a bit disappointed, and Draco for a few moments was tempted to pull the other boy back against him. "Oh. Are you sure?"
The Slytherin gasped softly as, before his very eyes, the wound at his wrist started to heal. In moments, all traces of what Harry had done were gone. The dizziness Draco had been feeling, however, didn’t disappear with the bite marks, and he collapsed next to Harry, closing his eyes. Next to him Harry shifted and in moments strong hands had flipped Draco over, cupping his slight arousal through his robes and trousers. Draco made a soft, breathy sound, opening his eyes to look up at Harry in confusion. “What are you doing?” he asked sharply, trying to squirm away as Harry started undoing his pants.
A burst of power rushed from him and the doors splintered, exploding in a cloud of wood and dust as Harry strode forwards. “Ah, my pet.” A voice slithered out from the front of the room, wrapping around Harry in a slickly slime of pure evil. “I see you have come to join us. Please, come closer. I’d like to see you for myself, in all your glory.”
"Dear Mr. Potter,
Suddenly a bright red rose tied with a black ribbon appeared on the table before Harry. Harry picked it up and seconds later the bell rang. To everyone's surprise Snape leaped from his desk and sprinted out of the classroom before anyone had moved.
And one day I'd like to...
Draco was going to die. That, he was certain of. As he stood outside the thick, dark wood door behind which he knew a Vampire sat in wait for him, Draco could hear his blood rushing in his ears and his heart hammering in his chest. He didn’t want to do this. Every bone in his body yearned for him to turn around and run as far away as he could. But he couldn’t.
Just the thought made uncontrollable panic well up in Draco’s chest and he scrambled to the window, shaking as he curled up on the ledge and pressed his forehead to the glass, the cold against his skin ground him somewhat as he looked down at the gray grounds.
Another smirk flicked across Harry's lips and he glanced up at the mistletoe. "Do you think kissing will work this time?"
“Alright, fine.” Harry finally conceded after a few moments of reluctant silence. “How far will you be?”
P.S. AAAAAHHHHH SNAPE IS COMING!"
“I know you didn’t,” Harry said sharply, flashing his fangs. “You have no choice in being my mate just as I have no choice in having you as my mate. We’re destined, Draco. You were made for me, and I for you. That’s why your blood can sustain me.”
“As you wish, Draco.” Harry murmured sadly, cupping Draco’s hand in both of his own and gently drinking from it. Draco closed his eyes, waiting for the rush of pleasure that accompanied the feeling of Harry drinking from him, but it never came. All he felt was a cold, dull ache where Harry’s teeth pierced his flush.
"YES!"
Draco did as told and groaned. Right above Harry's bed was another one of those blasted mistletoes.
“I will come.” Harry agreed with a nod, tongue grazing over his fangs as he followed the Death Eater. He remained calm as they approached the ballroom, Harry Potter slipping back into the shadows as the creatures that were within him burst forth, tasting the air. They stopped outside of a pair of heavy oak doors and Harry could
"Don't stop, don't stop!"
Harry opened the letter in anticipation and began to read it.
Once morning came Draco awoke with a groan, finding himself with two strong arms wrapped around him, a warm body pressed along his side, and a formidable hardness forming in his boxers. He swore mentally as his rather pleasant dreams from the night before came flooding back into his mind’s eye. Did he really dream of Harry kissing him? Of Harry drinking from him and stroking him until he came with arched hips and the breath of a name upon his lips? Clearly, whatever the case, his body had certainly liked the visions his psyche had conjured, though Draco himself couldn’t quite figure out how he felt about them. It wasn’t usually normal to be attracted to your worst enemy, was it?
"So, Ron, what'd you get Hermione?" Seamus asked, winking impishly.
A small smile flickered into place on Draco’s lips and he nodded. “Thank you, Granger.” He nodded, shaking her hand. “Have a nice afternoon.” He bid them goodbye before he started walking away.
“Not yet.” Draco shook his head. “I was supposed to be branded this upcoming summer.” He explained nervously, his jaw clenching slightly. “And now I never will be. Do you know the only think worse than not bearing the mark?” he asked the two Gryffindor’s, voice hard and unyielding. Slowly the pair shook their heads, remaining silent. “Defiling the place where the Mark goes. That spot is supposed to be for the Dark Lord, and now Harry has claimed it for himself. Claimed
To Harry's horror, the secret figure in the darkness decided at that very moment to make an appearance, showing himself to be none other than Draco Malfoy. But you already knew that, right?
Draco cursed softly, running a hand over his face tiredly as he made a mental note to have a serious talk with Blaise later about spreading true rumors. “It’s not that ridiculous, Weasley.” He said softly.
The next day Draco could once again be found outside Harry’s door, after minimal prompting from the Headmaster and Snape, shaking slightly as he tried to calm his pounding heart. This time he would just go in, let Potter drink, and then get his arse out of there before the Incubus had time to make an appearance. Taking a deep breath, Draco knocked on the door before unlocking it and stepping inside. He had just heard is click locked behind him when his breathe hitched and he froze as strong arms wrapped around his waist, pulling him up against a muscular chest.
Once Draco was stretched enough, the man himself writhing and pleading for Harry to be within him, Harry finally removed his fingers from his arse. Draco let out a whimper at the loss, lifting his head so he could look down his body to where Harry was slicking his cock and lining up with his entrance. He could feel it, the hot, thick head pressed against his opening, not yet breaching it in the way that he so desperately wanted. Slowly Harry lowered himself down on top of Draco, keeping his cock in position as he pressed soft kisses to Draco throat. The blonde let out a whimper of pure need and Harry smiled against his skin. “Ready?” he asked throatily, fangs glistening in the light.
A dark frown crossed the Vampire’s plump lips and he took hold of Draco’s wrist, tugging him over to a chair. “What are you afraid of?” he asked softly, almost breathlessly. “I will not hurt you, I must only take what is mine, what I need to survive.” He sat down in the chair next to Draco’s and squinted slightly in the soft light of the fire. “I am sorry for any inconvenience this will cause you, Draco. I really am.”
Then meet me in the place where all dreams come true.
"Oh god Seamus, yes!"
Harry quickly nodded, calling a house elf to bring Draco a hot chocolate with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. He handed Draco the mug before sitting down in the chair next to his, staring into the soft flames of the fire. “Thank you, Draco… for coming back.”
Draco shook his head. “You seem fine to me, Potter. And I’ll be there just in case anything happens.”
Harry snapped out of his trance of staring at Draco's lips and scowled. "Of course I can. The real question is if you can handle it." he almost growled before suddenly pulling Draco against him and capturing his lips in a forceful, demanding kiss.
Warnings for dubious or coerced consent. (Consent is important and coerced consent is NOT consent y'all!)
Once the door closed behind him, Draco took a deep breath, trying to at least somewhat steady his nerves. He still jumped, however, as a voice slithered out from the darkness, wrapping itself around Draco. “Why have you come back?” Harry asked, voice low. Carefully Draco followed Harry’s voice and found the Vampire lying under the covers in the large bed. “You’re endangering yourself by coming here.”
Harry groaned as he opened his eyes, being wrenched out of his magnificent dream by a mass of red hair and freckles landing on his bed. "Ugh, Ron! Ge'off me!" he grumbled, trying to push his friend off.
All Draco could do was give a small nod and a whine, urging Harry to just do it already. Pressing another kiss to Draco’s skin, Harry took a deep breath before he bit into Draco’s skin, feeling the burst of blood against his tongue as his hips shot forwards, impaling Draco in one go. The man beneath him screamed, though in pleasure or pure pain Harry couldn’t quite tell. Draco blood was pumping thick and fast into his mouth as he drank him down, moaning at the taste. It was better than anything he had ever tasted before, better than life itself.
“Harry, he…” Draco let out another choking sob and it took several more minutes of Blaise rubbing his back until he was able to try again. “Harry f-forgot. He forgot…me.”
Harry chuckled softly. “It won’t hurt, Draco. And even if it did, you would love the pain. You would yearn for it.” He sat up and the covers fell slightly, exposing his chest. It was only then that Draco realized that under the blankets Harry was completely naked.
“I know because we allowed him to be captured.” Dumbledore admitted softly. As a look of rage passed over Draco’s face he held up a hand. “Now, now, I assure you he was never in any danger. With the strength he now possesses he was perfectly safe. You must understand, Mr. Malfoy, that this was one of the only chances we had to destroy Voldemort without him attacking the school.”
“You know I’ll never hurt you, right?” Harry’s voice murmured in his ear. “I adore you, Draco. Even if you never come to like me, I’ll adore you until the day I die.”
For a few long moments of shocked silence Draco gaped at Snape. “Why?” he finally breathed. “Why would he do that?”
Taking a deep breath, Draco nodded and approached the darkness of the room, stepping just inside. A purring sound came from the blackness and Harry carefully approached Draco. “Harry?” the blonde asked, voice timid and scared.
In the Gryffindor Common Room Hermione and Ron sat snuggling in front of the fire. "Hermione can't we-" Ron said sleepily.
But that is past, and so I must tell you now,
“Yes, sir.” Draco nodded, chewing on his lower lip nervously. “But Headmaster, I still don’t see what this has to do with me.”
Harry smirked. "I was doing some...research." he took out the box of vials and set it on the table, looking the note over again.
! Otherwise I never would have let you do that to me.” He grinned as Harry’s eyes shot wide open. “I must say…” his expression turned coy, “I’m flattered you liked my pictures that much. I could always do a photo shoot for you…a very special,
“Potter…” Draco breathed, moved by Harry’s state to gently take one of Harry’s hands in his own, kneeling down next to the other young man. The unfamiliar feeling of guilt rose up in Draco’s chest. This was his fault. His fault for staying away. His fault for ignoring his vampire and not giving him what he needed to survive “I’m so sorry…” he whispered.
"It's ok, as long as you can hear me," he murmured. "Did you hear that great big speech?" He smiled tearily.
Draco nodded in understanding, going to his trunk to grab his pajamas. “Your friends and I talked today, remember them? Ron and Hermione?”
handwriting." she exclaimed, looking at Harry with wide eyes.
It took only moments for the professors to see something was going wrong, but by the time Dumbledore reached the Gryffindor table it was too late. “Don’t…don’t touch me!” Harry almost screamed as the Headmaster tried to pick him up. Where Dumbledore’s hand had touched him there was a searing pain, boring deep down into his soul. Still Harry struggled, inching painfully towards the doors. He had to leave, that was all he knew. He had to leave before the hunger consumed him and he acted upon it. From the corner of his eye he saw a blonde head look over at him, its owner rising to his feet. The hunger intensified, overwhelming him with need to consume what was his. Before Harry knew it, he was on all fours and leaping at Draco, not even hearing the five stunners that hit him before everything went black.
Once he got to the privacy of his own room, Draco groaned in frustration, stripping quickly as he made his way to the bathroom. He turned the water on warm, stepping beneath the spray and gripping himself tightly with a breathy moan. He closed his eyes, Harry’s face and the rest of the vampire’s body immediately presenting itself in the forefront of his mind. He tried his best to ignore the thought that he was getting off to the thought of Harry bloody Potter, but still when he reached bliss it was to the breathy moan of “Harry” upon his lips.
"You've been a bad boy, Malfoy, go to my room." Harry said, still grinning, although now it was more of a cringe.
“Yes.” The vampire admitted slowly, staring at Draco with eyes so dark they were almost black, but still recognizable as the color that so identified the Boy Who Lived. “I didn’t expect to see you out and about tonight…but I’m so
But of course it did. Draco had known it since the moment he saw Harry in the robes shop when they were eleven. It just wasn’t realized until now. Harry was the only one who could possibly be worthy of him. The only one he’d ever want.
The gaggle of teenage boys made their way down to the Great Hall, picking up a few giggling females along the way, one of which was of course Hermione Granger. Upon arrival to the Great Hall the first thing that hit Harry was the sheer amount of pink, purple, and frills that seemed to have attacked the Hall overnight. At first Harry thought that perhaps Professor Lockhart had returned from the dead, but then he noticed Snape's for once washed hair and decided that that was probably not it. The second thing that Harry noticed was that Dumbledore had on a nice pair of Light-Lavender robes that complimented his beard nicely, and the third thing was that there was a man with pretty long blond hair tied back in a pink ribbon currently sitting next to Snape, and, if Harry was not mistaken, seemed to be holding onto the potion master's hand under the table. The fourth thing that Harry noticed was that a pair of silver eyes were staring at him from the Slytherin table and that the owner of the eyes was not wearing the schools uniform, which Harry found rather odd.
A frown flashed across Draco’s lips and he slowly stood, reaching out to place a hand tentatively on Harry’s shoulder. “Are you sure?” he asked quietly.
He noticed Harry looked away, eyes diverted downward. “Nothing.” He muttered quickly.
“Yes.” Draco repeated, looking up into the dark eyes of the vampire above him. “You can have me, however you would like. Claim me, make me yours, just fill the emptiness inside me.”
Both men jumped and looked at each other in horror as the moans, groans, and swears turned into very loud shouts of "Oh god, POTTER!" and "Merlin, DRACO!". Both of the former Slytherins took off running down the hall. They finally stopped running when they were at the opposite end of the school, and when Lucius had dragged Snape into an abandoned classroom and locked the door.
“Then…maybe in a few days you can sleep in my bed, get that contact you need?” Draco offered with a small smile. “Sorry it can’t be tonight…I’m still rather shaken up about this.” He admitted, a light blush decorating his cheeks. Truth be told, Draco needed some time to think things through, decide where to go from here. On one hand he could comply with the vampire’s wishes, give himself over body and soul to the Gryffindor and savior of the Wizarding world, and in the process become a disgrace to the family name and probably get killed by the Dark Lord even though, as Draco saw it, this was all the Dark Lord’s fault to begin with. The second option that Draco cold see involved refusing to give Harry what he needed, killing the vampire in the process, and getting carted off to Azkaban for the rest of his life. All in all, Draco found the first option far more appealing than the second, baring the part about being murdered by the Dark Lord himself.
Draco raced towards the Slytherin common room, trying his best to keep the tears that threatened to overwhelm him at bay. He was a Malfoy, after all, and Malfoy’s don’t cry.
you, wasn't it?" he took out his wand and twirled it in his fingertips, a subtle threat that Draco immediately picked up on.
Carefully he went over the events of the day. "So I sent the box in the morning, which was probably when he took it. Then I got trapped under that mistletoe and he ran into me. That could have been coincidence, I guess. The second time he seemed almost as though he was looking for me. I guess it's possible...and the third time..."
A shiver ran down Draco’s spine as he heard Harry’s promise, knowing from his tone and the hiss within his voice that Harry was completely serious. Sometimes he forgot that he was living with a vampire mixed with an Incubus and a siren; a monster that could kill him in seconds if not for the bond of blood and whatever else that connected them. “O-okay.” He murmured, starting as gentle arms wrapped around him, holding him close.
Carefully Harry picked Draco up, moving him to the bed once he’d made sure the blonde’s breathing and heart rate were close to normal. He carefully lay down next to Draco, holding his mate close in his arms as he waited for Draco to wake up.
changed.”
A grin spread over Harry’s mouth and he eagerly kissed Draco again. “Brilliant. So you don’t mind the whole, you know, vampire thing?”
For a few moments Hermione could only gape at Draco before she swallowed hard, finding her voice again. “Now look here, Malfoy-“ she started before Draco cut her off.
But that wasn’t the only thing making Draco panic as he lay in a bed in the hospital wing, staring at a door set in the wall across from him, behind which he knew a newly created Vampire lay in wait. What was making Draco panic the most was how fast Harry had changed. From what Lucius had told him, whatever Voldemort did to Harry was supposed to change him slowly over the course of a week or two. The symptoms of each creature were supposed to show up little by little, not all at once.
But then again Draco Malfoy always looked suspicious, especially when it came to things having to do with Harry Potter.
Draco rolled his eyes, although he knew Blaise did have a rather fair point. “So, how’s the sex?”
Shivering, Draco shifted a bit uncomfortably, not quite certain how he could respond to such a comment without giving the vampire the wrong idea. Instead the Slytherin sat up, stretching and running a hand through his hair before getting up and going to the wardrobe to get dressed. There were a few long moments of a deep, uncomfortable silence before Draco spoke again. “Do you need that, Harry?” he asked softly, not turning from the shelves of clothing.
The whole time Harry’s body was changing as the Incubus took over and the Vampire in him melted back to the shadows. His skin seemed to glow with an unearthly light and a set of translucent, dark-feathered wings sprouted from his back. The biggest difference in Harry, besides his newfound strength, was his cock. Draco whimpered as his eyes dropped to Harry’s manhood, trying to take in the horrible sight.
Harry frowned, jealousy flashing though his eyes. “You…you’re waiting for someone? I…you should have told me. Then…then I wouldn’t have…the claim, you can’t be with anyone else.” He admitted quietly, squeezing his eyes shut to ward off the pain of rejection.
