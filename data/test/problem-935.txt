“He askd what I did…..what kind of creatures I cared for…..I can’ remember too well…….I always wanted a dragon…..we played cards….he mentioned the dragon egg….but he had to be sure I could handle it, he didn’t want it ter
“It was a retirement present,” Harry defended. Now, he was pissed, “I don’t understand that. You’re my best friend. We spend nearly every day together and you’re telling me that you don’t think you mean more to me than our old librarian?”
“Right, here’s what we’re going to do,” he whispered urgently. “One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape… wait outside the staffroom and follow him if leaves it.”
“I know,” Madam Zabini said. “And while I can’t offer you more verbal support in the oncoming battles. I can share some advice with you that has always served me well. Remember the ones who are faithful to you, remember your enemies, and remember that the places of enemy and friend can be reversed, one to easily and one with a little effort.”
It was Ron and Hermione, sitting outside Florean Fortesue’s Ice Cream Parlor. Ron, too, looked like he had to stop by Madam Malkin’s shop. Harry didn’t think it was possible, but Ron was even taller than he was last year.
A notable absence from the tent was Ely. Harry had assumed that he would be right by Cassius’ side, but as two people, Harry could only assume were Cassius’ parents took up residence by the boy’s side Harry could only guess they were the reason that Ely was absent. Cassius looked empty without the other boy by his side, lost even among the people who were supposed to know him most in the world.
Harry read the letter, and knew that they had to go right then. Harry ran in to the common room and got Millicent before heading to Hagrid’s.
The cloaked figure rounded on Moody, but he wasn’t Moody any longer, he was starting to transform into someone else. Holding his wand with one hand to fight off the rouge death eater, and drinking from his flask with the other, the not Moody laughed manically.
“Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry. “You realize that, don’t you?” she said when they were far enough from Filch to feel somewhat safe.
“I’m afraid he won’t be a teacher here much longer,” said Malfoy in a tone of mock sorrow. “Father’s not very happy about my injury…”
“Course he will. Madam Pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second,” said Harry, who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the extraordinary nurse.
“Harry,” said Sirius as Remus was pulled away to talk to Dumbledore. “This isn’t the end, this is only the beginning. You, me, Remus, your friends, Millicent and that Granger girl. You saved me Harry. You saved me from a fate worse than death. You saved me from a life without you in it.”
“What’s being said?” Millicent asked, looking like she was ready to take her wand back out and march right up to the Tower.
After dinner Harry knew he had to put on a show. He would get into bed and pull his curtains then he would sneak out and meet Millie in the common room with the cloak.
“Yeah,” said Harry, quickly forcing his thoughts back to that first broom ride. “Expecto Patronum….Expecto Patronum…Expecto Patronum…”
“You mean we could share?” asked Harry. Draco opened his mouth to vehemently deny that he ever alluded to any such thing, but Harry continued.
“We’ve tried to keep Harry away from the papers, but he knows that people especially the Prophet have been coming for both him and you, Dumbledore. But as far as that item that Voldemort is looking for. I’m not sure. I just want to keep Harry safe.”
“No, Potter, I simply made up about twelve different ways that you were going to meet your untimely end and she seemed quite pleased with me.”
“Father actually considered sending me to Durmstrang rather than Hogwarts, you know. He knows the headmaster, you see. Well, you know his opinion of Dumbledore…the man’s such a mudblood lover…and Durmstrang doesn’t admit that sort of riffraff. But mother didn’t like the idea of me going to school so far away.
“Charlie’s not that great. He volunteered to help me pack my trunk…it took two hours, Millicent, TWO hours!” Ginny bewailed.
Professor McGonagall blew her nose and said thickly, “Stupid boy…foolish boy… he was always hopeless at dueling…should have left it to the Ministry…”
“Cause you’re so self-centered. You don’t care to listen to me, and for goodness sake you’re an auror, not a part of biker gang poser drop the leather jacket.”
Harry plomped down on the couch in the common room. The fireplace was going, and the room was warm. The rest of his year mates were gathered around. Fifth year status basically allowed them to have free reign over the center of the room while the lower years were regulated to the outskirts. Harry extended his legs onto the table in front of him, but Millicent knocked his legs down.
“Listen to me, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore, taking a step toward Fudge. “Harry is as sane as you or I or anyone else in this room. That scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains. I believe it hurts him when Lord Voldemort is close by or feeling particularly murderous.”
“Yes, sir, yes!” said Dobby, and he seized Harry’s hand and pulled him off into the kitchen between the four long wooden tables. Harry noticed as he passed that the tables were positioned exactly beneath the four house tables alone in the Great Hall. Harry supposed that the dishes full of food were transported to their counterparts above at mealtimes.
“Even if they don’t,” said Sirius. “I’ll be in there in ten minutes, regardless of whether this thing is over not.”
Then the kicks came down on his back. Harry screamed, but then another foot made contact with his face. One more, and he was out.
went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside--- stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book still shrieking loudly.
“I’ve always wanted to see a hippogriff,” he whispered conspiratorially to Harry, like he was spreading a salacious secret about Dumbledore, or worse, Snape.
“Now.., we have to go now. Don’t you think it’s a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? Now, I’m new to magic, but I highly
They made their way to the back of the room toward a small vacant table. “Merry Christmas!” said Ron happily, handing them their butterbeers.
“Yes, I don’t think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that angry. They have been growing restless for some time…furious at his refusal to let them inside the grounds.”
“Is that….?” He said in a hushed voice, dropping his next present onto the bed, Harry’s scarf still tied around his neck.
“Don’t worry,” said George. “That little git wasn’t so cocky last night when the dementors were down at our end of the train. Came running into our compartment, didn’t he, Fred?”
Viktor momentarily looked as if he thought Dumbledore was going to say something to him, but Dumbledore had forgiven worse crimes then going to a school that supposedly teaches the Dark Arts. Snape had been a Death Eater and somehow he had wormed his way into Dumbledore’s good graces again.
Little known fact about pureblood engagement rings: The tracking spell comes with the ring. Only the most staunch pureblood activate it. Lucky them.
Harry stood, transfixed by the sight, too intent upon the battle to notice anything else. It was Millicent’s shout that alerted him….
They weren’t in a room as he supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.
a frightened looking little girl and harshly judging her idiotic mother who thought it would be a good idea to bring her child to such a place when he felt something wet hit the side of his face with a squish. He turned to look in the offender’s direction. A man, smartly dressed reared back to spit again as Draco waved his wand and cleared the substance from his cheek.
“I did,” Harry tried to defend. “I was going to take it to Professor Lupin, but…but I never got the chance.” Harry didn’t want to talk about what had happened with Lupin because that meant that he would have to talk about his parents, and there was no way he was going to mention them in front of Snape.
Harry didn’t know why, but he had to know who Draco’s soulmate is. Harry had tried, he thought, discretely to discover who Draco’s mark mate was. In short, he flat out asked him. Several….hundred times. He even tricked him into playing twenty questions which Harry thought was rather sneaky as Draco had actually started to play along.
Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air, and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.
“I found out something about him,” he told Hagrid. “He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it’s guarding—“
Harry felt his neck….he had gills? Great, Dobby had turned him into a merman. He hoped they would fade in the hour or else Harry was going to have to get quite cozy with the giant squid. And Fred and George had always said he could be a tad prickly.
The pain in Harry’s head was so bad he fell to his knees. When he looked back, the figure was gone, but in its place was a centaur.
Pansy snapped her mouth shut. Then, “That was one time, Davis. I also seem to remember you having a certain liking for….”
“Lumos,” Dumbledore said, lighting his wand, sweeping it until its beams fell on a pair of feet. Krum was sprawled on the forest floor, stunned. There was no sign of Mr. Crouch at all. Dumbledore pointed his wand at Krum and uttered, “Rennervate.”
Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line. She knew which one would get him through, she just wanted to see if he did.
“So, you do the math on why that was on offer. And besides my mother told me that your father talked some sense into her.” Pansy smiled ruefully. “Can’t have a blood traitor marry into the family. Wouldn’t want her staining the furniture. Though it appears mutts of the same street corner run together.”
“Harry, you were brilliant,” said Hermione. “and now everyone knows about S.P.E.W. Several people were already asking about it where I was sitting. A little blonde Ravenclaw also looked very interested in your speech.”
Wand head tightly before him, Harry kicked the door wide open. On a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings lay Crookshanks, purring loudly at the sight of them. On the floor beside him, clutching his leg, which stuck out at a strange angle, was Ron.
In the library that day, Fred and George came over to where Harry, Hermione, Millicent, and Ron were sitting and grabbed a seat.
“Harry!” he said, returning the hug. The two pulled back and Remus said, “Are you ready to go then? Let me help you get your stuff.”
“There is no need to stand guard anymore, Dumbledore,” she shrieked. “The Minister has seen to that!”
Snape huffed, Harry watched for fire. Instead, he got an explosion. “Potter take your things and get out of my sight!”
Then Draco felt Harry’s hand move toward his mark, it might have just been the edge of his finger, but Draco was nearly pulled under by the sheer weight of pleasure and wholeness that he had never felt before. Awareness came upon Draco like he had been stunned. Like he was on the floor, unable to move, but of a fully conscious mind. It was time for Draco to snap out of it. He stiffened slightly and felt Harry do the same.
The food on the table was varied in color, shape, and even texture, but one thing was the same, it was all candy.
“Please,” Hermione answered. “I put a simple charm on the stairs. By the time he figures it out it’ll be too late.”
“Did you ever see a mind healer for that one, Potter, or not, because I really think you should consi….”
“I’m not leaving!” he wanted to shout at them. “I cannot be talked out of this!” But he didn’t, he stayed silent and jumped through their hoops. He’d wait all day if he had to. He had no where else to be. He waited so long that when the man finally came through the door and announced that he was ready for Draco, he jumped a little in his seat.
He dreams again, not of graveyards, but of Pivet Drive. It’s a normal evening. Vernon is asleep on the couch, grunting and snoring so loudly you can barely hear the nightly news playing on the television behind him. Dudley is at the kitchen table eating his pre-bed snack. Tonight, it looks to be a slice of chocolate cake topped with whipped cream and two cherries. Dream Harry rolls his eyes. Aunt Petunia is in the kitchen, shining a the “good” china. They must be expecting more of Vernon’s work colleagues this weekend.
“I is not doing magic with it, sir!” squealed Winky, tears streaming down the sides of her squashed and bulbous nose. “I is…I is…I is just picking it up, sir! I is not making the Dark Mark, sir, I is not knowing how!”
Harry cast his mind for a happy memory then inspired by the firebolt, decided on the first time that he ever rode a broomstick.
The walk from the Great Hall to the Defense classroom was filled with speculating glances and whispers, but Harry knew that they would eventually fade. They faded when they thought that he was the Heir of Slytherin, and they would fade now. But you didn’t kill anyone then, a voice said in Harry’s mind.
Harry picked up the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.
Harry groped for the doorknob—between Filch and death, he’d take Filch. They fell to the ground, shutting the door, and standing as fast as they could and ran. And didn’t stop running until they reached the break between the Slytherin and Gryffindor common rooms.
He strode across to his fire, seized a fistful of glittering powder from a jar on the fireplace, and threw it into the flames.
And she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path, panting and squeaking as she fought the force that seemed to be restraining her.
Practice is the first weekend after classes return. If you haven’t been preparing this summer like I instructed, I will know and you will pay.
She flicked her wand and then a long cane appeared in her hand. The cane came to about Pansy’s hip. It was oak and maybe only over an inch in thickness, but it looked painful nonetheless.
The air was suddenly full of swishing cloaks. Every wizard hooded and masked. One of the Death Eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward Voldemort and kissed the hem of his black robes, “Master….Master….” he murmured. The Death Eater behind him did the same; each of them approaching Voldemort on their knees and kissing his robes, before backing away, and standing up, forming a silent circle, which encircled Harry and his headstone. Harry tried to catch Warrington’s attention but the boy wasn’t looking anywhere near him.
And okay, Harry knew Millicent could take care of herself. Harry had heard her creative use of language on more than one occasion since he got here, but before she told Parkinson to shut her little dog face, Harry saw the flash of hurt flick across her face. She stayed long enough for everyone to forget the incident and move on, everyone but Harry.
Lupin continued to stare at the map. Harry had the impression that Lupin was doing some very quick thinking.
Krum’s thick eyebrows contracted slightly. Warrington still looked slightly bewildered. Fleur frowned.
“So….” Professor Lupin had taken out his wand, and indicated that Harry should do the same. “The spell I am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic, Harry. It is well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level. It is called the Patronus Charm.”
I asked if I would still be able to see her for Christmas and my parents told me, of course I would.”
Oderint dum metuant : let them hate, so long as they fear. I thought this would be an appropriate password for the Slytherin Common room, and perhaps a bit of....foreshadowing.....well maybe not.
“…then I will never say another word against them,” said Mr. Weasley wearily. Harry heard some chairs move, and scurried off down the stairs where he found the rat tonic. By the time he returned to the room, Percy had found his badge underneath all of Ron’s things. Harry handed Ron the tonic and went to bed.
“He might’ve mentioned it, yeah,” said Moody, scratching his chin unconcernedly. “but I thought a good sharp shock…”
Professor Trewlaney had not stopped proclaiming his death every other class and after their first Care of Magical Creatures class, and Malfoy’s continued whining, Hagrid seemed to have lost his confidence.
Malfoy, Blaise and the others were gone before Harry even got dressed leaving him to navigate on his own for a while. It wasn’t until he spotted the boy he met on the train, Ron, trying to get through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor that Harry felt like he could breathe. Ron had tried to tell him that they were just lost, but he wouldn’t believe that they weren’t trying to break into it on purpose. He was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell who was passing by.
“Eat,” he repeated when they all just looked at him “It’ll help. I need to speak to the driver, excuse me….”
Bagman looked like he wanted to warn her off such a bet, but she said, “I’m sure,” then disappeared back into the tent.
“Dragon keeping has been illegal for hundreds of years,” said Ron. “You can’t tame them. You should see some of the burns Charlie’s got off wild ones in Romania. That’s where the Ministry tries to relocate the wild ones
Harry smiled at a frightened looking Blaise. Harry clapped a hand onto his shoulder.  			“That Blaise was the best idea Malfoy’s ever had.”
Harry thought he’d be free after the first couple of dances, assuming Pansy would abandon him for greener pastures, but she had stuck to him like glue. “You are the hot commodity, Potter,” she had said. “So, don’t think I’ll be letting you go to dance with other girls.”
It was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing tree. A head was shooting up out of the grotesque form of a mouse and then slowly the rat was made a man.
It would have been funny if it were anyone other than his formidable head of house. Then, there was more.
“Dobby came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir. You see, sir, it is very difficult for a house-elf who has been dismissed to get a new position, sir, very difficult indeed…”
But at that moment, there was a deafening rumble of thunder and the doors of the Great Hall banged open.
Madame Maxime marched toward the creatures in awe. Harry heard Charlie say something about telling her student, but Hagrid assured Charlie that they had just come to look.
The school talked off nothing but Sirius Black for the next few days. The theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder; Hannah Abbott, from Hufflepuff, spent much of their next Herbology class telling anyone who’d listen that Black could turn into a flowering shrub.
“And where are your parents?” said Harry, his temper rising. “Out there wearing masks, like real heroes?”
After more hesitation than Harry has ever seen in the other boy, Draco lifted his wand and cast the charm turning the Snake into a small flobberworm. Tracey Davis was next in line, the small flobberworm then multiplying into a horde of centipedes who threatened to overtake her feet. Tracey seemed to steal herself, then shouted, “Riddikulus!” She recited the spell in a flurry and turned them into little cute furry things Harry couldn’t identify.
“You don’t know what you’re talking about, Hagrid,” said Fudge sharply. “Nobody but trained Hit Wizards from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad would have stood a chance against Black once he was cornered. I was a Junior Minister in the Department of Magical Catastrophes at the time, and I was one of the first on the scene after Black murdered all those people… I will never forget it. I still dream about it sometimes. A crater in the middle of the street, so deep it had cracked the sewer below. Bodies everywhere. Muggles screaming. And Black standing there laughing, with what was left of Pettigrew in front of him, nothing but a heap of bloodstained robes and a few….few fragments.”
We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.
“You’ve got to stand up to him, Neville,” said Ron. “Malfoys used to walking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down and take it.”
“Not this time, you bastard,” thought Draco. Draco ran after the man, who was quickly making his way to the exit.
“No,” Harry said, stopping the boy from discussing anything that had happened in that bathroom. Harry certainly wasn’t thinking about it, no, definitely not.
“Astute observation, Mad-Eye,” said a voice that Harry instantly recognized as Snape’s. “And have you not actively participated in the recruitment for said children?”
Thanks for reading. I love this story and the fandom. I always appreciate the comments. Keep 'em coming. You can follow me on Tumblr at inkdrinkershadowsinger and you can of course, leave questions or comments here. I'm always ready to talk about Mr. Potter, so hit me up.
Millicent did say he was always good for a potion if you didn’t feel up to walking all the way up to the infirmary. Harry had blanched, knowing that he wasn’t likely to drink anything offered him by Severus Snape.
“You’re one to talk. All the mooning you’ve been doing this summer put all the cows in Ottery to shame.”
My mother would have been horrified by the idea of me offering to do a house elf’s work, but I would have done anything for Mrs. Tizzy.
“That was the best thing that I've ever seen,” Ron shouted joyfully. “I think I will live here after all. No other place could beat that memory.”
“She said that if I was going to be in a sour mood all night then she was just going to dance with Parvati, not that they don’t spend every waking hour together anyways.” Seamus chuckled lightly.
Fudge banged the gavel in his hand loudly against the platform in front of him. “No one in this courtroom is going to forget the Sirius Black debacle anytime soon, Lucius.”
The scrolls he was tasked with going over were ancient and interesting magical history, and he even got to use his potions skills every once in a while. It was rewarding work and Draco liked it. He really did.
“See you around Malfoy,” said Harry. “It was great talking to you, but Blaise and I have got to get to class.”
“Popular as always,” Blaise said, sitting down in front of him. “I can’t leave you alone for two seconds without someone ruining my carefully crafted work.”
Draco had ignored the way that word made his stomach swoop. Harry looked at Draco, almost assessing him. Draco had sat stony faced under the scrutiny. He and Potter had barely exchanged five words since the end of the Death Eater trials and no way was Draco going to give him the satisfaction now. When Harry had finished his analysis he merely nodded, and that had been that. They were partners.
Winky began to sob, rocking herself backward and forward on the ground in what Harry recognized as a self-soothing gesture. He was reminded forcefully of his own past.
No, now, all Harry could think about was that his chances of going to Hogsmeade now seemed even worse than they did before.
“This is a masquerade ball, Potter, no one hear even knows who you are. This is the time for you to forget that little fact as well. As a matter of fact, how about we give you another name? Alberto, Renato, perhaps…. Silven?”
He nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the one-eyed witch. Harry followed Fred and George inside. George closed the door quietly and then turned, beaming, to look at Harry.
“Yeah, he’s mine, bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las’ year. I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the….”
“Ron, Harry dear, come on, we have cake,” Mrs. Weasley shouted from the dining room. Ron threw his arm over Harry’s shoulder, and escorted him into his mini victory party.
“What do we want to be prefects for?” said George, looking revolted at the very idea. “I’d take all the…..”
“I went looking for the troll because I—I thought I could deal with it on my own—you know, because I’ve read all about them.”
“Trying to get your man, Bulstrode?” asked Blaise, who seemed to get handsomer and handsomer every year.
A few people laughed, Ron’s housemate Seamus winked at him, trying to keep his laughter suppressed, Snape, however, was not as amused.
“That’s enough,” said Mrs. Weasley, depositing her shopping in an empty seat. “Hello, Harry, dear. I suppose you’ve heard our exciting news?” She pointed to the brand-new silver badge on Percy’s chest. “Second Head Boy in the family!” she said, swelling with pride.
Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have the constant reminder of a scar on their foreheads, but no one seemed as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort scared them, but they had a reprieve when they were awake. One, that since the dreams started, Harry didn’t have.
“Pretty boy syndrome?” Harry thought. He knew that Draco was likely just teasing him, but from the way that the rest of their colleagues looked at him, Harry had to wonder if there was a shred of truth to his words. It wasn’t his fault that between the Potter Vaults and the Black Vaults that he was a seriously wealthy man. It made him a little uncomfortable after so long wearing Dudley’s old clothes and spending long days and sometimes nights too, with little to no food. Harry had gotten used to living on the barest of scraps. The only area in his life that he didn’t have to accept leftovers in were his friends, and he had made them when he was eleven years old.
He was too far away to hit him, but faster than Harry thought possible, Sirius was by his side knocking him away. Remus was dueling with Not Moody over the heads of screaming students. Then Dumbledore joined in, binding Not Moody with the ropes the way that Harry had just been bound.
Just then, the mail arrived. Hedwig had yet anything to deliver Harry, but she sometimes stopped by to steal a bite of his toast, and allow Harry to brush over her feathers. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the sugar and jam, and dodging Blaise’s grabby hand managed to drop a letter onto Harry’s plate.
“You won’t say no? Harry, obedience is a virtue and one I need to teach you before you die…. Perhaps another little dose of pain?” Voldemort raised his wand, but this time Harry was ready, he flung himself sideways onto the ground; he rolled behind the marble headstone of Voldemort’s father. He heard it crack as the curse missed him.
It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. Harry tried to turn back to the goalposts conscious that Marcus may not be watching, but that he wouldn’t be at all pleased if Harry somehow messed this up.
Blaise had made sure that only the girls would be accompanying them. Millicent, Tracey, Pansy, Daphne, and even her little sister, Astoria. It seemed to be a concerted effort to make Harry feel more at ease organized between Blaise and Millicent.
Draco thought it was sort of like monkeys. When you found your mate you subconsciously tried and well, groom them. You pull pieces of fuzz off their shirt or brush a piece of hair back into place. You also get them drinks without getting one for yourself and always demand to go into unknown buildings first. You even, once, lick your thumb to brush dust off their foreheads after a particularly nasty battle.
Neville, Ron’s other housemate, had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Harry wasn’t sure she had been wrong, seeing the amount of accidents Neville had
“I’d rather like to know that myself, Dumbledore,” said Professor Karkaroff. “Two Hogwarts champions? I don’t remember anyone telling me that the host school is allowed two champions, or have I not read the rules carefully enough?”
“Any second,” someone whispered. Then a tongue of flame shot into the air and a charred piece of parchment fluttered out of it…the whole room gasped.
“The point is, Potter, that all of your already good attributes, your history, and new status have all culminated in you attracting a lot of new attention from both sexes.”
And for the last part where the other students turn on Harry, I really thought that would happen in the original tale, but here I thought it was prevalent because Harry is a Slytherin and because that house has such a stigma around it that others would willing jump on to make sense of a situation that they didn't understand. Let me know what you think though about that.
“The events of the Triwizard Tournament were tragic, but I have it on excellent authority from the Minister of Magic himself…”
“You know, Potter,” Snape said on the ninth time he stopped by his station. He picked up Harry’s blade and began to strip a weed that Harry would need for his potion.
It was Winky. For a few seconds Crouch remained transfixed, his eyes blazing in his white face as he stared down at Winky. Then he appeared to come to life again.
Voldemort and whatever minion his brain concocted to torture him with faded easily to the background when for the past few weeks Harry had been staying at the Weasley’s ancestral home, otherwise known as the Burrow. He had even been able to visit with Sirius and Remus who were both blissfully happy. Harry had told them about the dreams, but that it was nothing to worry about. Whether it really was or not, Harry didn’t want to think about. The pair didn’t seem overly concerned or at least they never let on.
With a snap, like a quick change in subject, Barty Crouch apparated in. Looking rather stiff and uptight, the elderly man was dressed impeccably in a crisp suit and tie. His hair and mustache neat and trimmed perfectly. He shoes were polished to shine. Harry could see why Percy idolized him.
Harry hadn’t noticed at first until Pansy, who apparently was losing all of her Slytherin cunning alongside her patience,  huffed loudly, and in a put upon manner, every time Hermione didn't launch into plans to take over the Wizengamot or burst into flame and regenerate Phoenix style or whatever it was she thought she was up to.
“I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the tower. It’s one in the morning, explain yourselves.”
Sirius reached into the pocket of his robes, and handed Harry a wrapped package. With careful movements, Harry opened the package. It was a mirror.
“He’s a werewolf,” said Hermione. “The sickliness, that time Snape took over his classes, the essay…”
Ron nodded. “Both Bill and Charlie got their fair share of OWLS, as well as Percy, even the twins did fair enough last year, not spectacular mind you.”
There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers from the end of Professor Dumbledore’s wand to bring silence.
There was a loud crack, and Harry’s cloudy Patronus vanished along with the dementor; he sank into a chair, feeling as exhausted as if he’d just run a mile, and felt his legs shaking. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Professor Lupin forcing the boggart back into the packing case with his wand, once again a silvery orb.
Once every hour, a teacher would reappear in the hall to check that everything was quiet. Around three in the morning, he saw Professor Dumbledore approach Percy.
“You have been taught how to duel, Harry Potter?” said Voldemort softly. Harry remembered, “Expelliarmus” the disarming spell that could disarm Voldemort of his wand, but he’d still be out numbered thirty to one against the Death Eaters. He had never learned anything to prepare him for this. And he doubted anyone at Hogwarts would fare much better.
Harry wanted to break, but he held on. At once it seemed Voldemort’s wand began to emit echoing screams of pain, then, something large began to blossom from Voldemort’s wand tip, a great, grayish something….it was dense smoke then it was a head then a chest and arms, a torso…the form of Cassius Warrington. Harry would have released the hold on his wand had it been any other circumstance. The thread of golden light connecting the two of them stayed connected, unbroken between his and Voldemort’s wands even as the thick ghost emerged in its entirety from the end of Voldemort’s wand.
Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.
Then the hand that was now resting on his chest started to move in soothing circle’s on Harry’s chest as the hand moved lower and lower. Harry almost bounded out of bed when he heard a voice that certainly wasn’t Ron’s say, “What about it, Potter? I’m down if you are.”
Millicent stepped forward then, and quickly vanquished the somewhat familiar looking hand that threatened to come out of the wardrobe. She deftly took her place back in line, but Harry noticed the way that her breath had caught in her throat.
“Calm down,” said Hermione. Harry had been in such a fit over Rita and her lies that Millicent had to explain to Hermione what happened.
They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.
Plus, Harry can honestly say that he had never had more fun. Sirius, as a newly freed man, was living life to its fullest. He was jumping in the Trevi fountain. He was making plans to run with the bulls. He was lighting fireworks sent to them by Fred and George. He was eating croissants in France and spaghetti in Italy. He was gaining weight and he looked happy. No longer did the haunted look of Azkaban plague his handsome face. And when the cool air and frightened facade did threaten his gaze, Harry or Remus were always there to pull him back. It was nice to see him free. Harry contemplated seriously on having Sirius escort him back to school on day one. Maybe he could even convince Fred and George to sneak him into Gryffindor tower under the cloak. It would be nice to see the man back in what Sirius called his natural environment.
Millicent flipped her hair to the shaved side and blew him a kiss as Ginny Weasley laughed at her brother’s retreating back.
Thank you all for reading and commenting. Updates will, at least, be once per two weeks. Maybe more often to keep myself sane.
Slytherin was in possession again. Adrian Pucey was flying through the Weasleys and the Chaser Bell straight towards the goal, but when Lee Jordan said something about the Snitch Pucey looked up at the flash of gold
“You have now come very close to accusing two people in this clearing who are the least likely to conjure that Mark!” barked Mr. Crouch. “Harry Potter….and myself! I suppose you are familiar with the boy’s story, Amos?”
“Pettigrew, that fat little boy who was always taggin around after them at Hogwarts?” said Madam Rosmerta.
“Why did you say that, last night? I thought we were over that? I mean, I know you’ve always been a bit finicky about your clothes.”
It was only when the man had swept from the room that Harry allowed himself to relax. He reentered the dormitory with the others and quickly found his bed.
He had his Firebolt in his hand ready to mount again, but dropped it when the dragon made a swipe at him.
“My dad, too?” said Harry, astounded. “Three years and two of the cleverest students in school made it possible. Your dad and Sirius helped Peter to transform and in fifth year they all could change form at will. They couldn’t keep me company as humans, but they could as animals.
“The point is,” Wood went on, resuming his pacing, “the Quidditch Cup should have had our name on it these last few years. But we haven’t got it, and this year’s the last chance we’ll get to finally see our name on the thing…..”
“Is it you?” Harry finally asked, breathing the words. Harry couldn’t even look at him. If this was true. It couldn’t be true. Why wouldn’t he have told him? Why would Draco keep something like this from him? What was so wrong with Harry that Draco..no… no… it couldn’t….
At times, Malfoy got so close to them that Harry could feel his hot, labored breathing on the back of his neck. Towards the end of the night, he was sure he and Draco were wearing the same cologne.
“Get up, Avery,” said Voldemort softly. “Stand up. You ask for forgiveness. I do not forgive. I do not forget. Thirteen long years and so I want thirteen years repayment before I forgive you. And you, Lucius!”
Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain….his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a fatal curse.
Fred and George laughed. “You can’t tell me you honestly believe the old bats going to let you get away with writing lines do you?”
“I’m going to go and ask the driver what the hold up is,” said Millicent. “There are only so many Gryffindor’s I can….”
Harry knew that was what Malfoy was egging for, to get Hagrid fired, he just didn’t know why. He wondered really if Malfoy even really knew why.
The man on the ground uttered a shallow, “Yes, my lord.” Before he was allowed to kiss his leaders robes, and the circle were allowed to rise. “Perhaps as payment you would like to play with our newest toy before we get started.”
“This isn’t safe—she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on,” said Blaise, pulling Harry out of the room.
“Yes, yes,” said Pansy. “No need to regale us with your history, we are all quite familiar with the tragedy that is your life.”
Winky stirred freely. Her great brown eyes opened and she blinked several times in a bemused sort of way.
Thank you all for reading, commenting, leaving kudos, loving this story, and perhaps loving it so much you curse my name and wish I'd fall into a vat of hot lava....., well, a girl can only wish that she makes anyone feel that much about her story good or bad.
“Never…do….that….again,” said Moody, speaking each word as the ferret hit the stone floor and bounced upward again.
“When a wand meets its brother,” Remus explained. “The wands will not work properly against each other.”
“Oh,” said Millicent in a placating tone. “Don’t tell me you’re jealous, Potter. If you like I’m sure my father would throw Malfoy over if you were interested in me.”
Also, poor Ely. I love him so much, and I hated to do it, but we are setting up greater things for the next three books and that had to happen. I'm sorry if you guys were upset with that. But Warrington broke the imperious curse which is a pretty big deal. He had character. He was a good one.
But Harry wished he could crush this thing. It was in the shape of a human child, but hairless and scaly looking. Its arms and legs were thin and feeble. And its face was flat and snakelike with gleaming red eyes. Moody cradled the creature like any mother does a child then dropped the creature into the cauldron. Harry prayed that it would drown and that he’d never have to see those eyes again.
They all did it, all of them; the benches scraped as everyone in the hall stood and raised the goblet and echoed, in one loud, low rumbling voice, “Cassius Warrington.”
Draco had to get out of there. He backed away as many people were distracted by Weasley on stage spinning Lovegood around so that her beach ball dress ballooned out creating a rather spectacular effect.
Draco got up from his seat, willing to search out any conversation that wasn’t about Octavian “perfect” Tyler.
showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off. Harry smirked when he overheard her telling Malfoy that he had been gripping his broom wrong for years.
Margot Arthur was a petite, black girl who was never without a smile on her face, except on the Quidditch pitch where she chucked all of her Hufflepuff qualities and more closely resembled someone of his own house. Harry watched her now, and hated the fact that her spirits seemed to have taken a hit. She was a spitfire, even Fred and George was afraid to mess with her, but each time one of her team did something good or went a little faster on a lap she would immediately look to her right where Harry knew Cedric used to be.
“Yeah,” said Blaise, jumping over the side of the common room couch. “Sleeps in a coffin and everything.”
“Of course, he did,” said Millicent. “Draco’s right, the old man’s off his rocker. Has been, if you want to believe my parents.”
In no time at all, Defense Against the Dark Arts had become most people’s favorite class. “Did you see how I took on that werewolf?” Nott smiled. “One spell and he was my aunt Muffy’s poodle.” Only Draco and a few others seemed sour about Professor Lupin.
“And here’s one last thing that you should all know.” Fred opened his arms wide and swept them around the room before pointing back at Millicent.
Harry stood in the kitchen of the Burrow debating whether or not he should have another treacle tart. They were his favorites, but there were several other people at this party and perhaps they might want one. He had long ago forgone the desire to uphold the perfect savior image so he wasn’t worried about the extra calories, but he was concerned about being called out by Ginny again. They were her favorites, too.
Sirius sat down at the table with a thunk, and unconsciously stole a piece of bacon from Remus’ plate.
“Are you insane?” said Harry, his voice easily as croaky as Sirius’. “Of course I want to leave the Dursleys! Have you got a house? When can I move in?”
“Harry,” said Blaise. “I don’t know what kind of backward things you’ve learned about homosexuality from those Muggles you live with, but people in the Wizarding World don’t think that way. Two men, two women, they simply don’t care,”
“I didn’t do it on purpose,” said Harry, annoyed. His jeans were torn and his hand was bleeding, but he hadn’t forgotten about what had startled him the first place.
Just like that, the rat slipped between Ron’s clutching fingers, hit the ground, and scampered away. In one bound, Crookshanks sprang after him, and before Harry and Hermione could stop him, Ron had thrown the Invisibility Cloak off himself and pelted away after them into the darkness.
“Well…..your parents appointed me your guardian,” said Sirius softly. “If anything happened to them….”
“What are you doing here?” Harry asked her before Fred could come up with anything else. “The Minister asked me too,” she said. “Someone had to be on call to watch the dangerous Harry Potter, and while I tried to pass on those duties, Fudge thought I was the only one fit for the job.”
Draco tried to hand Rose back, but Hermione kept to looking at the scroll on his desk. Draco flicked it closed with a wave of his wand. “That’s top secret, plebian, you understand.”
“Seeing as how they’re coming to see the both of us, yes. But Wood isn’t willing to sacrifice his team for a shot at the big leagues, but I…” Flint said with a flourish. “will do anything to make sure that I make a team.”
Hermione stretched her hand as high as it would go without her having to leave her seat. Millicent was smirking now, anxious to give that kick Hermione was apparently begging for.
Snape had hosted a meeting to determine who was staying for the holidays and who wasn’t. When Harry handed in his slip to stay Snape had given him a hard look.
Somehow, Harry only had a small cut which Madame Pomfrey cleaned with some purple liquid that smoked and stung before she touched his shoulder with her wand and it felt healed instantly. She ordered him to sit still, but when Ron, Hermione, and Millicent entered the room, he jumped up to meet them.
Still, Harry and Ron’s room was clear. The room was large, and subtly handsome. In their time, the Black Family was one of the wealthiest in all of Britain, though their gradual decent into incest and insanity had taken its toll on the family if not the family’s coffers.
“If only you were in my house Potter,” she muttered, sounding disappointed. Was the punishment Snape was going to give him worse than what she would have given? It seemed that Professor McGonagall would be more lenient than Snape, but that didn’t mean that she wouldn’t let Snape do as he saw fit.
“I’m not sure I understand the context, sir,” said Harry, feeling more and more anxious the longer Snape stood in front of him. He never lingered longer than to deliver his dose of malice, but this was something different.
Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin juice seemed ages ago.
With that in mind, Harry decided that he might take a trip up to Gryffindor Tower, and see if Ron was still up and about. He didn’t bother with his cloak because he still had a bit left before curfew, and he knew he could make it back in time. The Welcome Feast, as good as it is, normally had the whole of Hogwarts knocked out pretty quickly. There was a serious conspiracy started by some Ravenclaws that the house elves doused the food on the first night to calm the horde of excited children. Harry thought the idea had merit. It was way better than the theory that Binns was really just a curtain McGonagall transfigured to mess with us.
“You have a very nice place here,” he said to the Dursleys. “Very clean,” he walked to the fireplace and ran a hand along the mantel. “Good job, Harry,” he said. “You are the one who dusts aren’t you? And mops and sweeps and cooks? Isn’t that what you said?”
Harry clapped along with the rest though when “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin he had to move over to make space for him at the table. In a moment, Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.
What with the promise of anti-dementor lessons from Lupin, the thought that he might never have to hear his mother’s death again, and the fact that Ravenclaw flattened Hufflepuff in their Quidditch match at the end of November, Harry’s mood took a definite upturn even if he still wasn’t allowed to visit Hogsmeade.
“Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly. “He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic, and flew off for London at once.”
“Excellent!” Lupin said, striding over to where Harry sat. “Excellent, Harry! That was definitely a start.”
“I know you think that little know-it-all is your friend Bulstrode, but I wouldn’t trust that messy haired mutt with anything. She’s up to something, that Granger, I just don’t know what.”
“Bit embarrassing,” Mr. Diggory said grimly, looking down at Winky’s unconscious form. “Barty Crouch’s house elf…. I mean to say….”
Hagrid’s voice came back to him clear as if he were standing in front of him. “Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.”
last year that Flint had made Bulgaria, he doubted that he would be playing tonight but he was still happy for his former Captain.
“Come on,” he said irritably. “The both of you, not you Weasley,” Marcus sneered as Harry and Millicent followed him, Harry thought to his execution.
“For how to outlast this woman,” Pansy said, taking a seat opposite them on the other couch. Harry could feel Draco’s weight pressed against his side. He thought about moving
“It’s just a fact, you get away with far more than any of the rest of us. You waltz in here five minutes late for the meeting this morning, and instead of scolding you Shacklebolt offered you a tart.”
“All right then,” said Lupin. “You might want to select another memory, a happy memory, I mean, to concentrate on…That one doesn’t seem to have been strong enough…”
And Harry remembers where he is and who he is with. They may be back in England, but like Remus and Sirius have continually stated, he will never have to go back to Pivet Drive again. Remus rushes to Harry's bed. It's only been a day or so after the full but the man moves quickly to his side. He casts a cooling charm on the room, and summons a cool wet rag for Harry’s face.
“I know that’s an Allucian scroll about the bathing habits of their people, not exactly top secret if I can decipher what it is?”
The purple haired girl looked at him gratefully before remembering that he was a traitor to their noble cause. Draco got to his feet before she could cast anything his direction. He dodged a curse from his right, and saw out of the corner of his eye that Basks, the coward, was making a run for it.
“No, not like them. The Potters were a great family, purebloods and wealthy. We would have been friends in another life.”
But it still left him feeling a little strained. Being raised in the Muggle world, Harry had almost thought that the whole soul mark thing was a joke. But as he got older, and saw the proof of the marks in the couples that they spawned, he started to believe. Hermione, unsurprisingly, had been the one to explain the significance to him. It was something sacred, something gifted to people from God, the source of everything even deeper than magic. It was ingrained in their bones, in their very creations, and while the lack of a partner now felt like nothing, in a few years it would eventually get heavier and heavier to bear.
It was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Pivet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn’t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he had ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie. Blaise was one of the only Slytherins beside himself staying at the castle, something vague about his mother and her new husband that he refused to elaborate on.
Harry had opened the doors to what could only be labeled as “the most spectacular thing that Harry had ever seen”. It was beautiful. The girls had outdone themselves. Every inch of the room was covered in the twin’s favorite colors, hot pink and raven black. Oddly, the colors fit together perfectly. The walls had been charmed the colors for the occasion, even the fire had a slight pink tinge to it. Then, without warning the brown pants and plain white shirt Harry had been wearing was transformed into an alarming shade of pink.
He wasn’t sure what he was being thanked for. Anyone could have done this, anyone could have been the person that helped them the way that he had, but it was nice regardless, so Draco just nodded, before giving Harry a very bro-like pat on the back.
Harry was about to demand that they all link hands so that he didn’t lose either of them when he heard Ron yelp in pain.
Harry thought he was drowning. The gillyweed hadn’t worked. He opened his mouth to scream as he felt a slicing pain on each side of his neck.
Harry glanced toward the ground, and brazenly raked his eyes over the form of his soon to be dance partner, and shook his head. His partner instantly grabbed Harry, and pulled him close. It was too easy how the pair of them swept together.
“No,” said Mr. Weasley. “We found Barty Crouch’s elf holding Harry’s wand, but we’re none the wiser about who actually conjured the Mark.”
“Hurry, von’t you?” Krum called after him as Harry sprinted toward the castle. Halfway to the castle, Harry stopped. Of course, he’ll just send his patronus.
Harry was more than willing; the wind was fierce and his hands were freezing, so they crossed the road, and in a few minutes were entering the tiny inn.
“Mother,” Blaise said as she reached the bottom steps. It was then that Harry noticed the two younger girls that were standing behind her, the twins, Blaise’s sisters, Jasmine and Ariella.
“I know he’s after me,” said Harry. “I heard Mr. Weasley talking about it this summer, but I trust Dumbledore. I have to play, Flint, it’s the only thing that’s normal anymore.”
Tracey scoffed as Crabbe twirled her around the room. “Like your mother told you any different. You’re desperation of a mother would take anyone, even Longbottom.”
Harry was reaching for his wand when suddenly a man staggered out from behind a tall oak tree. Harry almost didn’t recognize the man then he realized it was Mr. Crouch.
Pansy swung the cane in what looked like a jazzy fashion, but to Harry it looked like a very threatening order to behave. She then instructed everyone to partner up. Harry immediately went for the older girl assuming she wouldn’t be as much of a target as some of the younger years and by extension he wouldn’t be as much of a target himself.
They were applauding him now more than they had when he had finished the first task. “Go Harry!” Dean shouted from the Gryffindor table as well as a few others.
know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea what the plan was, and instead of stopping us, he just gave us enough to help. I don’t think it was an accident he let me find out how that mirror worked. He thought I had the right to face him if I could.”
“Well, I’m going,” Millie said instantly. “and it would make sense for Granger to go, because Blaise and Neville don’t really know Hagrid.”
Several people were already at the table. Sirius sat at his place at the head of the table, and promptly dawned a pointy party hat that looked like someone had stolen it from a Muggle’s third birthday party.
“Don’t fear death Harry. For to those who have a well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. As much money and life as you could want! As much power, but the trouble with being able to choose whatever you
“The worst?” said Madam Rosmerta, her voice alive with curiosity. “Worse than murdering all those poor people, you mean?”
“Hermione?” Harry called but didn’t get an answer. He had to get down there. “I’ll see you in a second,” he told Millie before dropping down. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down, and….
“Probably ‘cause it’s you, isn’t it?” shrugged Ron, still chuckling. “Famous Harry Potter and all that. I’d hate to see what the Ministry’d do to me if I blew up an aunt. Mind you, they’d have to dig me up first, because Mom would’ve killed me. Anyway, you can ask Dad yourself this evening. We’re staying at the Leaky Cauldron tonight too! So you can come to King’s Cross with us tomorrow! Hermione’s there as well.”
“Do not lie, sir!” shouted Mr. Crouch. His wand was still pointing directly at Ron, and his eyes were popping….he looked slightly mad. “You have been discovered at the scene of the crime!”
Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall’s hand with a self-satisfied smirk on his face, but McGonagall was keeping an eye on Hermione Granger who looked pleased as her housemates congratulated her on getting them out of last place. It seemed as if she was going to have more friends after all. Millicent smiled at him and Blaise clapped him on the back. Goyle sent him a thumbs up and even Draco sent him a smile, though he quickly covered it up.
“Yup,” she said. “I’ve been giving it to him all year, which might explain a few of his more, uh, interesting moments.”
The students all looked in Fred’s direction. The twins were normally up for a good time no matter what, but the look on Fred’s face was murderous. And the few who thought that perhaps he was just going to go along or agree with them and their howlers slumped in their seats, their smiles falling.
The iridescent light from the Black Lake glowed green. “I pulled your curtains, Potter. I know how modest you are,” said Blaise.
Crabbe kept silent, dutifully flipping through book after book. But when Draco walked into the room, Crabbe breathed a sigh of relief.
Now, that made sense to Harry. He was sure that Malfoy wasn’t telling him the whole truth, but he figured that it was good enough.
As they climbed the steps out of the dungeons an hour later, Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were low. Why did Snape hate him so much? What had he done? And just how was he supposed to learn all this with a teacher who seemed bent on humiliating and cornering him every chance that he got?
I was going to suggest a Conjunctivitis Curse, as a dragon’s eyes are its weakest point, but how you handled that dragon was simply amazing. Don’t get complacent though, Harry. You’ve only done one task; whoever put you in for the tournament’s got plenty more opportunity if they’re trying to hurt you.
“I have no idea. It was pitch black, but I know it wasn’t Malfoy. I remember him finding me, and you can’t fake the shock that I saw on his face.”
“Well,” said Blaise. “You’re not particularly hot, Potter. But you are a champion and famous which means quite a lot to some people.”
Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places and glory in decay. They drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them. Muggles can feel them, they just can’t see them. If it can, the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself…soulless and evil. The leave you with nothing but your worst experiences. And what happened to you Harry, that’s enough to hurt anyone. You have nothing to feel ashamed of.”
Right, Harry thought. That professor was a psychopath who tried to kill me. I’ve got to remember that.
“Now surely George, students as smart as Ravenclaws will know what bullying looks like. And surely Hufflepuffs know what it’s like to be an easy target. And Gryffindors know that being brave doesn’t mean that you don’t have confrontations with others, but that you don’t go around their backs like a bunch of wankers, but that you say it to their face. And lastly, I know that Slytherin is the house that protects their own.”

He looked at the men through his one good eye, but neither looked too familiar. They were probably wearing glamours, Draco thought.
“Hello, Mr. Malfoy,” said the nurse who tucked her head in the room right after Draco had woken and most likely triggered an alarm when he reached for the cup of water on the stand beside him.
Goyle may not have been at the top of the class, and was known more as Malfoy’s flunky than anything else, but he still had a wand.
“Typical,” said Harry when he spotted the poster in his common room. “Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.”
“Yeh are if you want ter stay at Hogwarts,” said Hagrid fiercely. “Yeh’ve done wrong an’ now yeh’ve got ter pay fer it.”
Run, dodge, cast wingardium leviosa here versus a chorus of “You’ll never see his face again” and “Please, let Harry be okay” were battling for space in his mind.
No one said a word as he entered the dorm. Blaise was still in the shower, but the rest of his dorm mates barely even looked at him. Perhaps they too, thought that he had cheated and entered his name illegally, or maybe they just wished, like Snape, that he would be sent back home in boxes….several boxes.
“Excuse me, I don’t like people just because they’re handsome,” said Hermione indignantly. Ron gave a false laugh that sounded a lot like, “Lockhart!”
“I don’t,” said Millicent. “But events like this are equally about the connections and esteem as they are about the actual game.”
Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick closed all the doors to the Great Hall. “I’m afraid that, for your own safety, you will have to spend the night here. I want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and I am leaving the Head Boy and Girl in charge. Any disturbance should be reported to me immediately.”
“I’m not too sure,” said Draco’s charge Harry thought was named Cora. “He does seem a bit intimidating.”
“So we can once again bicker inside the walls of Hogwarts,” Draco guessed at Luna’s reasoning. Draco swore sometimes she didn’t even have a reason, she just did stuff to fuck with people.
Harry watched as a rather flustered looking Pansy sat down beside Tracey Davis, and instantly began sorting through several books and pieces of parchment.
“That has nothing to do with trust, Potter, that has to do with you being a nosy bastard!” Draco had shouted.
“Ron!” Harry shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy branch whipped lethally through the air and he was forced backward again.
Dementors, at least a hundred of them, gliding in a black mass around the lake toward them. He spun around, the familiar, icy cold penetrating his insides, fog starting to obscure his vision; more were appearing out of the dark now on every side; they were encircling them….
Talk around Slytherin that morning had been all about whether Warrington, the big, slothlike looking bloke, entered or not. Harry didn’t think it would be bad at all to have a Slytherin champion, but Ron seemed to have quite strong feelings about it.
And somehow he still managed to look masculine, Harry thought, even with the rather large necklace he was currently wearing. Girls from every house seemed to flock to Blaise and unlike other members of his house, Blaise didn’t much care for dating only Slytherins. And unlike his mother, Blaise liked to keep his “relationships” discreet. The most Harry had heard about Blaise’s relationships before the “incident” as Harry called it was merely a collection of distinct longing filled sighs that erupted when Blaise walked down the corridor and a few teary eyes and red faces as both girls and guys stared daggers into Blaise’s skull at meal times. Blaise, of course, always seemed unaffected.
“But, France is full of independent women, most of the queens took a quite active role in the making of society and even modern culture.”
“Don’t worry, Precious, I’m just making sure my player will be able to crush yours when we play you.”
“That is enough!” said Mr. Weasley. “Severus, Mad-Eye please take your seats. We need to discuss this rationally.”
It was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls…he would never, ever forget tonight.
“You have asked me the same question at least three different ways and since your hearing is as poor as your crocodile handbag,” Skeeter clutched the thing fiercely to her chest. “And I have given you the same answer. You can’t just ignore it because it isn’t the one you want to hear.”
“Now, let’s go up to the castle, shall we?” said Snape silkily. “But I don’t think we need to go that far. All I have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the Willow. They’ll be very pleased to see you, Black….pleased enough to give you a little Kiss, I daresay.
“See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. “Why?”
“And this is one of your friends,” Sirius asserted, looking at Pansy who was standing near the corner of the room looking for all intents and purposes like this was the last place she wanted to be caught. Harry had carefully taken her wand off her when she had slid off Buckbeak, and was now glad that he did.
“That’s chess!” snapped Millie. “You’ve got to make some sacrifices if you want to win. When I make my move, that’ll leave you free to checkmate the king, Harry.”
“Macnair,” that was Dumbledore. “if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you really think the thief will have led him away on foot?” said Dumbledore still sounding amused. “Search the skies, if you will….Hagrid, I could do with a cup of tea. Or a large brandy.”
Harry never wished for Colin Creevey’s presence more than he did right then. Sweeping the thoughts of the black dog away, Harry left Malfoy for Crabbe and Goyle to handle, and went to get dressed.
“I’ve got the Snitch!” he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion. Cheers and awes filled the stadium, but Harry heard none of it. Slytherin had won, Marcus was in the hospital, Higgs announced that after that scare he thought he would be safer on the ground and thus, was quitting the team, Harry was promoted to seeker by a happier than he’d ever seen him Marcus Flint, Malfoy was sour, and Blaise and Millicent had something very important to tell Harry.
“So now you’re insulting my face. My face is offended,” Harry deadpanned. Draco laughed, but wouldn’t be deterred from his point.
“Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that Flint got the most of that message, but he seemed unperturbed as he stared hardly at the Gryffindor captain
“You bought that monster?” said Ron, his mouth hanging open, matching Harry’s. “Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!”
Harry heard the footsteps of someone entering the house, then a voice saying, “I’m Harry’s godfather, and I think it’s time we had a little chat.”
Lucius eyed the members of the Wizengamot. His grey eyes not pleading but condemning them almost into action.
It happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a high pitched scream and then Hagrid wrestled Buckbeak back into his collar as the hippogriff still strained to get at Malfoy, who lay in the grass, blood blossoming over his robes.
“Cassius Warrington did not die due to something that just happened to him,” Harry said. “He died because Voldemort killed him.”
It was easy to convince himself that the good things had been nothing but a fever dream, but pointy, blonde Malfoy felt rule in his petty jabs and sneers. Malfoy felt real, solid. In some ways, it made him feel more connected to this new world more than anything else. He could almost image the man that the boy would one day become. And it made Harry smile.
Millicent gave Ginny Weasley a panicked once over before joining in beside her, Fred had one of Ginny’s hands and Millicent the other as George held his wand out, cast Lumos, and started to lead them back to the hill.
Harry wandered about the castle that night, in no hurry to get back to the dorm. He was walking down a corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said, “Harry?”
“Amos, think who you’re talking to?” said Mr. Weasley, very angrily. “Is Harry Potter likely to conjure the Dark Mark?”
“Another boggart,” said Lupin, stripping off his cloak. “I’ve been combing the castle ever since Tuesday, and very luckily, I found this one lurking inside Mr. Filch’s filing cabinet. It’s the nearest we’ll get to a real dementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when he sees you, so we’ll be able to practice on him. I can store him in my office when we’re not using him; there’s a cupboard under my desk he’ll like.”
“My name is Firenze,” he added, as he lowed himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back. There was suddenly the sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. More centaurs
Before he could say or think anything else the dormitory door was flung open and in walked Millicent. Harry chucked the cloak out of sight. He didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.
He turned to see Millicent walking up the stairs from the dungeons. Wow, Harry thought. Millicent was wearing a deep green almost black suede strapless dress that fit her incredibly well. Her hair was beautifully done in loose waves to one side, the jewels she was wearing only exemplified the fact that she was definitely shining.
Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle taking over Buckbeak, after Harry climbed off of him. Malfoy bowed then pet his beak as Harry had done.
Trying to finish this up for you guys to apologize for my laziness in regards to the past couple of weeks. Love you dearly. I appreciate every word.
“We all know someone like it. That one guy at your job that gets to run around doing nothing while you’re stuck with all the grimy work, and just because their cute and charming and just so happen to have a penis and slayed the darkest wizard of our time they don’t get so much as a slap on the wrist for avoiding the work. Do you honestly think everyone else has it like you Harry?”
“Hagrid,” said Harry. He wanted to go to him, but Ron stopped him. “He’ll be in even more trouble if they know we’ve been to see him.”
Harry lowered his wand slightly. Both he and Warrington stalked the figure with their eyes. The figure stopped beside a towering marble headstone only six feet away from them. Warrington reached Harry’s shoulder to pull him down, and out of the man’s sight, but it was too late because without warning Harry’s scar exploded with pain.
“I’ll understand, of course, if you want to stay with your aunt and uncle,” said Sirius. “But…well…think about it. Once my name’s cleared…if you wanted a….a different home…”
Harry would have no clue what happened to him. Draco just hoped that he knew that it wasn’t his fault.
“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,” said Millicent, though Harry wasn’t sure he was making fun of him or not.
Harry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell him without words that it wasn’t true. Neville may not feel like a true Gryffindor, but he had showed more bravery in the past weeks then Harry ever thought possible. He was
Harry wrote to Hagrid saying that he would try to help in any way that he could. If only helping meant that he could strangle Malfoy then he’d only be too willing to oblige.
It was only the three of them when Saturday night came around. Millicent wanted to go, but when Harry told her what her duties would be she had insisted that Granger could have this one. Ron had gotten a response from his brother, and Malfoy’s own antagonism had ensured that he too knew what the plan was. Hermione tried to console a sobbing Hagrid, but when Hagrid started calling the dragon by it’s new name and calling himself his mommy. Hermione gave Harry a look and he knew it was too late, the dragon already had a name.
“And I know that Millicent Bulstrode is one talented witch. She’s strong and crafty. She’s got a smart mouth and is both cunningly evil, and beautiful….And I know that while she was pretending to enjoy her breakfast that she was making a mental list of all the people that had sent those fowl things, and she’s going to destroy them in the most elegant way possible because she is a Slytherin. But I am a Gryffindor, and Gryffindors prefer to do things the messy way.”
And then he heard Mad-Eye Moody’s voice, bellowing in some distant chamber of his empty brain: Jump onto the desk! Jump onto the desk.
Harry laid in bed, and wondered why he didn’t feel more scared. Sirius Black had murdered thirteen people with one curse; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley obviously thought harry would be panicked if he knew the truth, but Harry agreed with Mrs. Weasley. Only a fool would try to get into Hogwarts with Albus Dumbledore still there. Didn’t people always say that Dumbledore was the only person Lord Voldemort had ever been afraid of? Surely Black as Voldemort’s right hand man, would be just as frightened of him?
“Why he killed them? Well, that’s no mystery is it,” blustered Fudge. “He was a raving lunatic from what I’ve heard. He thought he was following you-know-who’s orders!”
“Yes,” said Fleur. “But several Beauxbatons students believe that a woman’s place is secondary to their husbands. Ruthlessness is not an attriubute that we are taught to strive for. Intelligence is neglected in favor of more aesthetical charms. But you,” she turned to face Hermione.
Harry missed Quidditch. He would even take Flint back barking orders and making them train in the rain and cold if it meant that he could get in the sky again. Heck, he would even take flying with Malfoy if that was the only way it could happen.
Harry sat on the edge of the bed. He wasn’t an auror for anything. And he was currently wearing that rather adorable face he got when he was connecting the dots on a particularly difficult case.
With a quick nod, they were excused from the chamber, and didn’t speak at all until they got back to the entrance of the Great Hall. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.
As Millicent sat down, despite Harry’s concern and “let’s go take a walk, Mil,” the girl simply wasn’t having it.
She had instantly called for Ron, her terror overwhelming her common sense. Her assistant was the one who side alonged her to St. Mungos where they met Ron. They took her back immediately. It was moments after that Harry and Draco arrived that the rest of the Weasley’s popped into the room, each embracing Ron and Harry one after the other in a giant hug.
After some negotiating and threatening, Hermione had fallen in line and three were heading off towards the trophy room.
Suddenly people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry’s broom had given a wild jerk, leaving Harry
“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody’s been in the library – Restricted Section.” To his horror, it was Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section? Well, they can’t be far, we’ll catch them.”
The girls were more than happy to play backup singers, alternately performing amazing pop songs, the volume of which shook the room. Sirius’ hair somehow ended up in pigtails as he and Blaise sang a charming rendition of “Girls Just Want To Have Fun”. Harry had never laughed so hard. Blaise, wrapped in a hot pink feather boa, motioned for Harry to join them on the stage. Harry locked eyes with Remus, and nodded. Even Harry couldn’t say no to the magic of Cyndi Lauper.
“Severus was very interested in where I went every month. We were in the same year, you know, and we…er…didn’t like each other very much. He especially disliked James. Jealous, I think, of James’ talent on the Quidditch pitch… Anyway, Snape saw me one day, and Sirius thought it would be..er. amusing to tell Snape all he had to do was prod at the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he’d be able to get in. He didn’t know that he would soon be face to face with a fully grown werewolf, but your father, who’d heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, at great risk to his life.
Warrington stood there for a beat, but it was long enough. Harry found his wand and cast a lightening fast Stupefy towards Warrington who had made the mistake of many before him in underestimating Harry. The boy stunned and still as stone began to fall towards the cup. Harry got to his feet, and ran. He was only feet away, but somehow Warrington was already coming out of the stupefy like he hadn’t really been stunned at all. Shaking himself out of the curse as fast as Harry could now throw off the imperious curse.
“If you think life right now is shit just wait, Potter. Cass has got it easy now. The dead don’t have to make any choices.”
“Harry is that you?” he asked reaching out his hands. “No,” answered Millicent before Neville snapped his hands back by his side.
“He helped tutor me in defense, got my grades up.” Flint looked at Nott. “And right now, I can tell you that I don’t care if he’s a dirty werewolf or halfblood or whatever because I’m getting out of here. And he helped me to do that,” Harry thought that Marcus’ words were more than just about leaving Hogwarts. “Hell,” said Flint with a pointed look at Nott. “Maybe I’ll even buy him some new robes.” Then he seemed to come back to himself, “Goodness knows he needs them.” Harry laughed quietly at Flint’s brusque words.
Later, Blaise, Millicent, and Harry were heading to the library when they were stopped by a frazzled looking Hermione.
Soon, the bus stopped at a familiar place, The Leaky Cauldron. Harry grabbed his trunk and got off the bus.
“Yes!” He pumped his fist into the air. “Success, Remy.” Sirius leaned over and kissed Remus on the cheek with a big smack. Remus smiled indulgently.
He eyed the cloaked figure who was fighting against the restraint of some of the others. In sight of Voldemort holding his wand, ready for battle, the men in the circle fell to their knees. He turned to Not Moody.
The chessman seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving space for them to take their spots.
“Now, so as there is no doubt as to who is stronger, let’s put on a little show. A duel so I can kill him once and for all, and show that I am still the most powerful wizard living. Give him back his wand.”
Hadn’t Harry done the same thing Sirius Black had done, broken Wizarding Law? Would he end up in Azkaban for doing what he did to Aunt Marge? Harry would never forget the look on Hagrid’s face when he came back from Azkaban? The terror when he found out that he was going in the first place, and Hagrid was one of the bravest people that Harry knew. How many times had he willing went into the Forbidden Forest, and dealt with the creatures that lived within?
Ron even started teaching Harry wizard chess. One of Ron’s dorm mates Seamus Finnigan had lent Harry his chess set before he went home for Christmas, but it turned out there was another one in the Slytherin common room.
Pansy stood and with a bright smile and her cane dancing, waiting, happily by her side, she clapped her hands, and urged them all up. Goyle was nearly passed out on the other side of the room. The two fourth years each had one arm trying to pull him up, but the floor seemed to need him there at the moment. While Harry was still stuck on what Pansy had last said.
Harry rolled his eyes. He’s heard this all before. Draco stiffened at the gesture, rising from his spot beside Pansy to face Harry.
Then and Harry wasn’t sure whether it had to do with the fact that the competition hadn’t been held in a hundred years or the death toll, Dumbledore announced that there would be an age limit.
Suddenly, Harry felt wide awake. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him. What about Blaise? Should Harry wake him?
“Make yourselves at home,” said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who instantly bounded toward Ron and began licking his face.
“The Minister of Magic,” Harry said, trying not to mimic the witch’s accent. “was not in the graveyard that night. I was. And I can tell you with the upmost authority that
“More robust and individual than others will leave and find ways of educating ourselves and our own judgments. While those that stay will be forced to remember that they are being molded and patterned to fit into the narrow and particular needs of society. Now, you only need to ask yourself Zabini, which you would rather be?”
“A dementor,” said Lupin, who was now giving chocolate to everyone else. “One of the dementors of Azkaban.”
“Auror Malfoy,” Kingsley said as he stepped out into the hallway outside of a particularly intense questioning. Draco could still feel Harry’s power through the thick and heavily warded door.
“Well, no,” said Draco. “But compared to your other best friends, Hermione or Ron, or any of the other Weasleys, yeah.”
“Of course not, everyone knows that those are just rumors.” Draco turned to Ron, and raised his wand.
“With you staying Potter I’m sure they’ll be some action that I simply cannot miss. My parents will understand,” she had said. Grateful either way she was going to be useful if he was ever going to beat Ron at chess.
“Yeah,” said Fred. “I know certain parents treat their Slytherin’s preciously, but I didn’t know they hire out cars from the Ministry just to make sure they can get to school alright.”
“I’ve had enough of your little show Harry. I’m going to bed.” Draco willed his voice not to shake. “Then let’s go,” he said, pulling his shirt up and over his head. “It wouldn’t be the first time we’ve slept in the same bed.”
The rain thickened as the train sped up farther north; the windows were now a solid, shimmering gray, which gradually darkened until lanterns flickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks.
“House elfs deserve freedom. House elfs deserve fair pay. House elfs deserve equal rights. It is unfair the things that we are doing to our magical brethren and the cruelty must end here. I…” Harry stopped briefly.
“Seamus was pretty vocal last night about what they have been saying in the Prophet about you and Dumbledore,” answered Hermione. “Ron tried to shut him up and stand up for you, but then things got physical between the two of them. That’s why Ron’s not here, he and Seamus are currently attending detention with McGonagall.”
“Fancy a flutter on the match, Arthur?” he said eagerly, jingling what seemed to be large amounts of gold in his pockets.
Harry rolled his eyes, pretending not to notice Millicent’s pink cheeks when Fred and George stopped by and the pair engaged in their usual bout of verbal sparring. As they were leaving, Ron kept him back for a second.
Draco’s shirt lied on the floor of Harry’s bathroom for quite some time. He no longer needed it because beneath the scab that finally faded, wasn’t bare pale skin, but the mark that he had always born.
When Draco opened the door, Harry was standing there waiting for him. Draco moved instantly into Harry’s open arms, and kissed the other man the way that he always imagined that he would. And Harry kissed him back like he would never get the opportunity to do so again.
It was a mural of war heroes, Granger and the Weasleys even the one who didn’t make it, Thomas and Finnigan, Neville was near the center commanding attention with the sword of Gryffindor in his hand. Even the dead got their place, Lavender Brown and the Creevy kid. The mural was full of people who fought on the side of the light. It wasn’t any place for someone like him.
“I had a disturbance in the wards around my store room the other night. No one was there naturally, but it did turn out that I was missing quite a few things. It was almost like an invisible man had taken them.”
Harry waited to see if anyone else was coming up the stairs, but when Harry saw neither Crabbe, Goyle, or Blaise in her company, Harry wondered if she had decided to come alone after all. Blaise had said that he was going stag, maybe they just planned to dance together and or make fun of everyone else’s dancing skills or lack thereof.
Dean nodded. “Pulled about every muscle in my body during my first pickup football match this summer back home. It always takes a while to get back into things. Glad I mastered that charm though. After you and Seamus with those dementors last year, I figured I’d learn it just in case he… I mean anyone needed it. No one really has the best luck with Quidditch around here.”
It wasn’t his fault that his damn ma….or the place where his mark used to be was determined to annoy him to death. The darn thing itched incessantly so much so that he broke down and called FATE. They told him that it was normal but that he should under no circumstances succumb to the itching. They said that the scabbing around the mark would eventually flake off on its own, but Draco was not to hurry it along. He had disconnected the Floo and went to bed with mittens on.
“Mr. Potter, listen to reason. If this thing isn’t taken away you will sit here forever. You will waste away in front of this darned reflection. This is not real. This is a fallacy. It is a slight against the reality that your parents were.
The waiting room seemed almost designed to push people out. The seats were uncomfortable and the walls were a blinding white when paired with the fluorescent lights making it hard to look anywhere for longer than a few seconds at a time, more time to close your eyes and ponder your horrible decisions, Draco guessed. Draco didn’t have to ponder, he knew what this was, and he knew that this was the least of it. Draco waited.
“You knew about…” Harry gestured to the two boys who were now holding hands and waiting to be let into the Ball.
“They call it the Dementor’s Kiss,” said Lupin, with a slightly twisted smile. “It’s what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly. I suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there, because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and….and they suck out his soul.”
Getting to the top of the spiral staircase was easy compared to stifling their laughter at Malfoy being manhandled by Professor McGonagall.
“He did indeed. Black was tired of his double-agent role, he was ready to declare his support openly for You-Know-Who, and he seems to have planned this for the moment of the Potters’ death. But, as we all know, You-Know-Who met his downfall in little Harry Potter. Powers gone, horribly weakened, he fled. And this left Black in a very nasty position indeed. His master had fallen at the very moment when he, Black, had shown his true colors as a traitor. He had no choice but to run for it..”
The Elixir of Life, the Sorcerer’s Stone, Harry thought, but wouldn’t dare say it out loud, but Bane seemed to read his mind.
It just couldn’t be. Harry turned back because he was wrong. He had to be. But when Harry turned back he saw the naked outline of Draco Malfoy in the water, seemingly waiting for him.
On a lighter note, writing Draco and Harry scenes for this chapter was too much for me. I live for them riling each other up.
Up at the high table, the Professors were all having a grand old time. Professor Dumbledore had swapped his hat for a flowered bonnet and was chatting merrily with Professor Flitwick.
Harry rinsed the grime from his body, one of the last as Montague said goodnight. Normally, Harry would just shower back at the castle, but with the chill in the air he was worried that the thick layer of sweat he was sporting would freeze to his skin. The thought making him sick.
“Yeah,” said Millie. “And Draco here will ask Weasley to marry him before Hagrid would let Dumbledore down.”
Harry felt the well of anger and fear and terror that had wrapped around him ever since the attack break into rolling hot tears that slid down his face, and soaked into Sirius’ shirt. Was this what life was going to be like for him? Was this going to be his future? Hunted because he spoke the truth? Hunted and unbelieved because Voldemort and his cronies shared in the truth, but weren’t ready for the world to know that the creature himself had made a reappearance?
“Don’t be a fool,” snarled the face. “Better save your own life and join me… or you’ll meet the same end as your parents…They died begging for mercy….”
Harry took Draco back to his apartment after the healers at Saint Mungos gave him the all clear. He had paced and fretted by Draco’s beside until the healer had asked him to wait outside. Harry didn’t tell him that he loved him though every bone in his body was simultaneously screaming it and thanking God that he had gotten to Draco in time. Harry helped Draco out of his bloody clothes, and fought the urge to send a call into the aurors to give those two creeps extra special treatment before they were shipped off to Azkaban. He helped his mate get his bruised body into a shower, and he turned on the hot water.
the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he’d touch her, their reflections were as close together, but he felt only air—she and the others existed only in the mirror.
It was the worst immediately after the war. They still had the tension they had before they were partners only Draco had seen the proof of what he had subconsciously known for years. All of them were battle torn that day, but Voldemort’s followers had taken pleasure in parting the savior’s garments. Hagrid had carried Harry in, his tattered t-shirt hanging over his body like a blanket, but when he jumped from Hagrid’s arms his whole chest was on display. It was only when Harry had faced off against Voldemort in the Great Hall did Draco see it.
Harry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students, even those in his own house.
“What…live with you?” he said, accidentally cracking his head on a bit of rock protruding from the ceiling. “Leave the Dursleys?”
Whiter than a skull with wide, livid, scarlet eyes and a nose that was flat as a snakes, with slits for nostrils, Voldemort had risen again.
“What happened to you?” Harry asked. Then remembering Ron’s letter from the summer stating that Millicent had become quite the staple at the Burrow as she helped the twins with their various products he thought he could guess.
Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Both Hermione and Millicent just stood there with a look of sheer amazement on their faces.
“Let me go!” Draco shouted loudly, yanking his arms as he did, gaining a bit of freedom, turning then tripping on the rug beneath their feet.
Goyle eyed him wearily, and Harry reminded himself that it beneath Goyle’s large exterior that he was really a softie.
Millicent laughed then, grabbing her cloak from the corner of the bed. She threw it on then stalked toward the door.
She stopped in front of her classroom, the way to the dungeons lost on the way. “I’ve called for Madam Hooch, she will be here to determine your punishment.”
Harry felt the cold tip of one white finger touch him, and thought his head would burst with the pain. Voldemort laughed softly in his ear, then took the finger away, and continued addressing the Death Eaters.
It was Mr. Crouch. He and the other Ministry wizards were closing in on them. Harry got to his feet to face them. Mr. Crouch’s face was taut with rage.
Ron sat beside Hermione toward the front of the room. Apparently, the two were still going strong since last year. Hermione mentioned in the hospital that she had spent a considerable amount of her summer at the Burrow. Ron looked calm and happy though his shoulders tensed when Seamus and Dean took the seats behind them. Seamus didn’t even deem to look at Harry. Harry was unconcerned. Finnegan wasn’t worth the trouble it would take to confront him. Let him spout his rot. Skeeter would be taken care of soon enough.
“I don’t know about petitioning the Board, but we could do one ourselves,” Hermione suggested. “Professor Grubbly-Plank really knows her stuff though. Our first lesson was so brilliant…. I mean, I didn’t know half the things she told us about unicorns.” She stopped her gushing when she saw the blank look on Harry’s face.
Several heads turned in his direction, but the burly looking boy was already getting into the pond. Professor Lupin tossed a bag of something to Blaise, and Blaise offered it to Crabbe.
Harry fights to get his wand out of his pocket, but the dementor has more to feed on this year than his kind did two years ago. Harry can hear a body hit the ground, and agonizing screams fill the air, and he knows that it is Sirius.
“And did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father saved my life?” he whispered. “Or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious Potter’s delicate ears? I will not have you run away with a false idea of your father, Potter. Have you been imagining some act of glorious heroism? Then let me correct you, your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father hadn’t got cold feet at the last moment. There was nothing brave about what he did. He was saving his own skin as much as mine. Had their joke succeeded, he would have been expelled from Hogwarts, and likely sent to Azkaban, and you would never have been born.”
Harry sang along dutifully to the words of “Hoggy Hoggy Hogwarts” admiring Flint’s quiet but pleasant falsetto until the end of the song.
“They protected me, told me to hold on…dad….he told me what to do. Cassius told me to take his body back, to show them what had happened, and to tell Ely… to tell him that he loved him.”
With this, he’d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp on his way along the rows of books. It floated along, seemingly, in thin air.
Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life, any second, the troll was going to buck him off or Hermione and Millicent were going to be taken out by his wild club.
As Madam Hooch reprimanded the two boys, Flint was waiting patiently for his turn. Gryffindor would get a free shot for that, but Harry didn’t think that was all Flint had been upset about.
Can't you guys see Sirius and Remus for that matter wanting to smack the ever loving poo out of Fudge when he's talking about Harry's pain in his scar because I can. Remus is like should I hold him back, or should I let him go and then follow... which is why I love them.
“All of you champions are here, and are ready for the second task, which will start on my whistle. It is easy and admirable to save and love what is natural to us, but difficult and even more admirable to accept the traits in others that confuse and challenge us. Champions find the thing you despise the most and embrace your envy. On the count of three. One, Two, Three!”
“I’m not,” said Harry sincerely. “Really,” he added. “I’m not trying to be a hero, but seriously, Sirius Black can’t be worse than Voldemort, can he?”
“Brilliant,” Harry said amazed. Percy came over then and shook Harry’s hand before skiving off to finish some very important work.
There were older voices too. Apparently Rita had run another article, and the whole population of England thought that Krum deserved someone better. But as far as Harry knew Millicent wasn’t interested in Krum like that. She had told him the day after the ball. We just get along, she had said, and that was it. Harry had believed her.
“Hmmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very Difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes-, and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting….So where shall I put you?”
Harry felt himself being flipped over, and suddenly he was staring into the most stunning face that he had ever seen. Soft cheeks, delicate strands of hair that fell in front of panicked stricken eyes.
Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they’d thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn’t; look as though he’d cracked yet.
“Anywhere but Slytherin. Anywhere but Slytherin,” chanted Harry, but the turban shouted SLYTHERIN! Once again. He tried to pull it off, but it only tightened on his head painfully—and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it—then Malfoy turned into Snape, whose laugh became high and cold—there was a burst of green light, and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.
Ely waved his hand in a “come on” gesture, urging Harry to continue speaking, but Harry truly didn’t know what Ely was after.
Draco had wanked for weeks over that mental image, Potter battle worn, sweaty and sexy, licking the pad of his thumb. You also have an uncontrollable urge to pick up things in the hovel they call a home. Good thing it was common knowledge how much of a clean freak Draco was before they were partners or Harry might not be so clueless about their situation.
Draco moved to his radio and turned it up loud. He didn’t even want to hear him. Draco stripped his clothes back to the mirror and flipped on the shower. He didn’t care if the water was too hot, let it do the work and burn the mark off his body. Let it be the water that finally cleansed him Let it burn so hot, so that its all he can think about, so hot it numbs his brain that refuses to stop shouting that it was right, that he never wanted him, that he has never been enough, that he tricked and betrayed Harry, that he took advantage of his friend and partner, that he never should have befriended him because he knew that no matter what he said or did that all roads led here to a boy who would never get what he really wanted and as of tomorrow another boy without a mark.
Madam Hooch’s face was as white as Neville’s as heard her mutter something that sounded like “broken wrist”.
“Don’t say that name to me!” Mr. Warrington shouted, staring at Harry coldly. “That gold digger is the reason that Cassius is dead. He never should have been involved in this tournament. He never should have been the one to touch that Cup. He should never have been with that overly ambitious sod. And now he’s left his entire inheritance to that boy. I’d say that was the plan all along. To ruin my son and then reap the benefits. It should never have happened!”
Every time they passed the third floor corridor they would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still snoring soundly. Snape was still sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. All of them made an effort to be kinder to the stuttering Professor Quirrell, anything to boost his morale.
Draco had been looking for something like this to happen, but in all his cocky honesty, he had imagined it would be he and Harry on the cover. Personally, he thought, “The Death Eater Savors the Savior” had quite the ring to it, but it turned out that two former Tri-Wizard contestants finally “winning each other” had a much better ring to it.
“Blaise?!” Harry shouted the same time that Ron stumbled out of his own bed, and shouted, “Zabini?!”
“Harry,” Neville burst out, the moment he saw the others. “I was trying to find you to warn you. I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag—“
Harry wasn’t used to having so much freedom. He could do what he wanted and eat what he wanted as long as he stayed neared Diagon Alley. He had promised Fudge and he saw no need to break that promise, but everywhere he went he kept hearing the same thing. Sirius Black. “Personally, I won’t let any of the children out alone until he’s back in Azkaban,” Harry heard one diner saying at dinner.
Wood looked sorry, but Marcus looked furious and defeated until he caught Harry’s gaze. Harry looked away quickly realizing that he had no business to be watching the exchange in the first place. He wasn’t even on the
His Firebolt felt powerful and antsy. Harry took the turns of the pitch at the fastest speeds possible. There were no kinks that needed to be worked out, even after so long on the ground. This, Harry thought as he zipped around the pitch, felt right. He wondered briefly as he zoomed in and out of the three hoops in a twisty pattern Flint always favored as a warm up if there were any trunks in the shed. Chasing the snitch until he was breathless was just the thing he needed.
The centaur didn’t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry before his eyes settled on the scar on Harry’s forehead
Harry didn’t have a father anymore, but he did have a Sirius and a Remus and a….”Dumbledore!” cried Rita Skeeter behind him.
Harry went then, if just for the experience, using a combo of the two approaches to make it past the water dweller.
Harry ran his hand over his matching mark on Draco’s body as Draco laid asleep in his bed, and thanked God for every line.
Harry barely made it behind a large boulder when he felt the burn of it start to heat the edge of his robes. He could hear the dragon moving so he took a chance, and came out from behind the rock and made a run for it.
Harry hoped that both of his parents would have been proud of him. As far as a date, Harry was starting to highly consider asking Myrtle if she would be willing to take a break from the bathroom and haunt the dance floor with him for a few hours.
Yeah, Harry thought, putting his hand out, and the broom automatically finding it’s way to his hand. He nodded.
The yelping sound stopped abruptly. As they reached the lakeshore they saw why…Sirius had turned back into a man. He was crouched on all fours, his hands over his head.
“The Champions are not permitted to ask for or accept help of any kind from their teachers to complete the tasks in the tournament. They will receive information about the second task when the first is over. Owing to the demanding and time consuming nature of the tournament, the champions are exempted from end-of-year tests.”
One casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the hall and stood themselves against the walls; another wave, and the floor was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags.
Millicent shoved her way into the tent past a surprised looking Fred singing Ginny’s name. Fred quickly followed her back into the tent though he was just saying something about taking a walk around with George.
Harry had thought that it was just a little bit of rain, but even sitting in the stands it seemed as if it were more than just a little bit. The rain pelted down on the crowd like tiny bee stings, and Harry could only imagine what it would feel like to the fliers. The stands were under large canopy like structures, supported by four posts near the corners, but the rain beat in on them sideways, and Harry knew that even with umbrellas and charms, that he would be soaked by the end of it. The wind was so strong he saw the players stagger as they made their way onto the field. The Slytherin team were sitting in close quarters to one another, Marcus wanted the team to take notes on the other team’s strategies, and Harry knew that the burly seventh year would demand to know what they learned from the match.
Harry turned prepared to get out of the water, when he heard something splash behind him. Harry sighed heavily assuming that Myrtle had come to take a peek after all.
Tiny Santa Claus in one hand and his stained suit jacket in the other he walks to his bed. There’s no place to put a couch in the tiny space and his bedside table is currently covered with the gorgeous bouquet Harry had gotten him on their last date. Some of the petals were starting to turn brown despite the preserving charm Draco had put on them, but they were still beautiful. Draco had both awed and blanched at the gorgeous blooms. He loved Harry for thinking about them, but where on Earth was he going to put them in his tiny flat? Harry, bless his heart, must have bought the biggest bunch he could find. Malfoy’s only get the best right? Harry had said.
“Come on,” said Harry moving down the hallway, but Hermione Granger wasn’t going to give up that easy. She followed him down the hallway, hissing at them like an angry goose.
The response to this story has been beyond my wildest dreams. I am indebted to all of you, but particularly to one reader who inspired this version of the story.
“Really? Because it seemed like you were just gearing up for another boring and might I mention useless motivational speech.”
“Come back, boy!” Madam Hooch shouted at him, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle—twelve feet—twenty feet, Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him
Sirius eyes washed over him carefully as he smoothed his bed covers. And with the help of dreamless sleep, Harry quickly fell under. He hoped that he wouldn’t dream about cauldrons, and the shrill voice of Voldemort. He hoped he wouldn’t hear anything at all. And he didn’t. Until the next morning.
“Well, I don’ s’pose  it could hurt to tell you that…let’s see he borrowed Fluffy from me…., then some o’ the teachers did enchantments…Professor Sprout---Professor Flitwick---Professor McGonagall---Professor
And a big dog trots out from the end of his wand, and together the wolf, stag, and dog push back the three dementors before they fly into the night. Harry stands, and as his eyes run over his godfathers and determines that they are fine, Harry turns to the house.
“We’ve been all abuzz at the Manor. Father was quite envious that I would be attending Hogwarts this year with well….you know,” Malfoy said to Crabbe and Goyle, clearly begging for Harry to ask him what he was talking about. But Harry was used to hearing plans that didn’t involve him so he had learned to not to give a Hippogriff’s booty about things like that.
“Let’s do this smart,” said Harry. “We can open the door from here. Hermione you go first, then I’ll take the flute from Millicent so she can go.”
And now, that he and Octavian were finally done, how would Harry spend his time? How could he stand to see Draco with someone else, his mate, when Harry wasn’t sure that he would ever find his own? He knew it was selfish, but if Harry was to live without a mate then a small part of him wanted Draco to join him in his misery. He even told himself that if Draco remained single, that he would leave it alone. He wouldn’t ask him about his mark again. He wouldn’t even say the word. That is, until Octavian left him with the worst gift he ever gave.
Harry knew that was a part of Draco’s mask, a vital part of the defense mechanisms that he had built over the years, but he was done playing games. He removed the jacket, and dropped it to the floor.
Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soar; and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he’d found something he could do without being taught—this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps from the crowd. Parvati and Millicent had moved closer together unwittingly to get a better look at Harry even as Blaise and Ron admit a whoop or two from the ground.
“No!” shrieked Winky, prostrating herself at Mr. Crouch’s feet. “No, master! Not clothes, not clothes!”
“I will have to keep this, Potter, you understand. I’ll need to check it for curses and hexes, strip it down.” Snape ignored the look of outrage on Flint’s face as he focused on the discouragement in Harrys.
Harry looked into the shadowed face of Sirius Black, the only part of that sunken face that seemed alive.
“Is there a patronus that takes care of nightmares too?” Harry asks the man who taught him the original charm.
Then realizing his sudden lack of composure, stated. “Watch what you’re doing, Nott!” Though his words lost some of their command in his shrill.
“Don’t ask me to fathom the way a werewolf’s mind works,” hissed Snape. “Get out of the way, Potter.”
“What?” Blaise said, straightening in his seat. “I was merely trying to give her a present. It’s not my fault she couldn’t be swayed alone by Honeyduke’s finest.”
Voldemort must have seen the defiance playing out on his bloody face as the Death Eaters laughed cruelly at him. It felt as if a huge invisible hand started to bend him ruthlessly forward.
“All right, then,” Black said. “Tell them whatever you like. But make it quick, Rem, I want to commit the murder I was imprisoned for…”
Harry allowed his sore muscles to soak in the water. He had played pick up games with Sirius and Remus this summer, and while Remus was the more athletic of the two he was the most content with a book in front of a warm fire. Sirius was more likely to want to play a game, but his coordination was a little less than ideal. His eye sight even worse. Nine times out of ten, Harry would catch sight of the snitch before Sirius could get two feet off the ground.
A shiver ran once more around the circle of Death Eaters. Voldemort let them stew in the horrible silence.
They had reached the entrance hall when Draco pulled something out of his bag. It had been surprisingly quiet on the Malfoy front, but Harry knew that couldn’t last.
“I know,” said Harry thinking quickly. “That as long as Millicent has that ring around her finger that Malfoy is still her betrothed, but as soon as she takes it off than he will be free game. And I know that you like that blonde, evil git for whatever reason, but you can’t have him. And I also know that if you help Millicent and me, that she will be far more likely to take that ring off. If you don’t help us then I also know that she’ll marry Malfoy out of pure spite.”
“You’re due in court in ten minutes, and you have grape jam on your face,” Kingsley said. Harry nodded briefly, wiping away the jelly quickly, Shacklebolt
Hermione shook her head. “I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I’ve read all about them! You’ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw him!”
I believe this was all that I was planning to post this week, but if it wasn't and I've just blanked then I will be posting another part this week.
Harry gave his nod of approval to Nott’s words as did several others, murmuring in agreement. Snape looked more menacing than ever.
Harry nodded. The woman in pink was now looking in their direction. “She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge.”
“Do you think he can break free of my curse? Do you think that he is strong enough for that? Love may have beaten me once, Potter, but it will not do so again.”
Harry decided, to heck with it, and snatched one before using all of his stealthy auror skills and slipping out of the kitchen before Gin could catch him red handed. Luckily, Blaise was currently keeping her company elsewhere. Harry tried to ignore the tinge in his soul mark. He was happy for them. He was. He was thrilled for Hermione and Ron, though that one had been a foregone conclusion for years. He was even happy for Percy and Neville, if either of them decided to pull their wands out of their arses and make a move.
Sirius paced in front of the fire, the light making his cheeks look gaunt. The wild look in his eyes more closely resembling his first days out of Azkaban than they have in a while.
“I wish I could say that he was,” said Fudge slowly. “I certainly believe his master’s defeat unhinged him for a while. The murder of Pettigrew and all those Muggles was the action of a cornered and desperate man…cruel…pointless. Yet I met Black on my last inspection of Azkaban. You know, most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the dark; there’s no sense in them…but I was shocked at how normal Black seemed. He spoke quite rationally to me. It was unnerving. You’d have thought he was merely bored…asked if I’d finished with my newspaper, cool as you please, said he missed doing the crossword. Yes, I was astounded at how little effect the dementors seemed to be having on him…and he was one of the most heavily guarded in the place, you know, Dementors outside his door day and night.”
Then, Ginny walked into the room alongside Remus and Hermione who were discussing something rather intently. Mrs. Weasley saw what was in Hermione’s hand and then promptly made a grab for it. Hermione let it go without a fight as soon as she saw Harry at the table. Her face lit up as soon as their eyes met.
Mr. Diggory looked as though he didn’t think much of that suggestion at all, but it was clear even to Harry that Mr. Diggory fell lower in the hierarchy at the Ministry than Mr. Crouch did.
When Bell scored for Gryffindor and Fred and George flew around her, Bole and Derrick took it upon themselves to take a shot at Wood. They caught him in the stomach, one after the other, and Wood rolled over in the air, clutching his broom, completely winded. And Flint looked livid.
“Oh,” said Warrington, chucking. “It’s not just Skeeter, oh heir of Slytherin, target of mass murderers everywhere, and Madame Pomfrey’s most frequent patient. Sorry, Potter, but you have a reputation as being quite a drama queen.”
Harry took a breath and picked up the smallest bottle. Unassuming, he thought. He turned to face the black flames.
Then just as Harry was preparing to turn the dial, the doors to the infirmary opened and Pansy Parkinson burst into the room.
The man had asked Kreacher what he had done with all of the nefarious artifacts, but the house elf had just shrugged and said that they were taken care of. And with all of the recent events, he hadn’t been able to question the elf further. From what Harry knew of the elf and his co-dependent relationship with the portrait of Walburga Black, he guessed that the Black Family Artifacts were closer than they all thought.
“Hermione, a wizard in Mr. Crouch’s position can’t afford a house-elf who’s going to run amok with a wand!” said Percy pompously, recovering himself.
Also, this will be uploaded within two weeks of the last posting, which is now. I promise. All the love.
“As though that settles anything,” said Ron. “You only like him because he’s handsome,” Ron accused.
“Oh great,” Harry thought, another person to lay claim against him. Harry wondered how many years they give people in Azkaban for stealing (freeing) a house elf. By the way Malfoy senior’s nose hair flared in his regal nostrils Harry felt confident it could be quite a few. But instead of turning his withering, poor dumb peasants look on Harry, he turned toward the members of the Wizengamot.
Harry walked around the halls until he knew he was closing in on curfew and Snape’s yearly welcome address. Harry wasn’t two feet into the common room when a folder was shoved in his face.
Harry walked down the hall back to the dungeons. It was late, and he hadn’t grabbed a pass from Professor Lupin like he normally did. Harry just hoped he didn’t run into anyone before he….
He pulled his pants on then reached for his shirt when he caught his reflection in the mirror. He stopped, the shirt falling from this hands. And he knew how he would thank Harry. He would finally give him what he wanted.
“I’ve heard,” said Harry. Harry had a running list of how many ways the woman had threatened to torture with fire. That was a side benefit of getting screeched at by the woman. His vocabulary was increasing exponentially.
Harry gave him a quick update about the case then promised he’d bring some coffee and donuts since he knew how much Draco hated working early on Sundays. Draco had told him they’d better be chocolate covered which Harry rightfully took as “Thanks”, then disconnected the call.
“The Triwizard Tournaments aim was to further and promote magical understanding. In the light of what has happened and Lord Voldemort’s return, such ties are more important than ever before.”
He’d go to move the rocks surrounding the flowers to plant the new ones. He’d lift the neat looking rocks and from underneath would spring all manner of crap. Rolli-pollis and earthworms wriggling around in the dirt beneath. Aunt Petunia would always tell him to crush them, but he never could.
“He more than makes up for that, sir. He’s one of the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers we’ve ever had.”
“I’m not your professor.” The man walked by Harry, ignoring his outstretched hand as he too took a seat.
Draco walked quickly down the street, the sound of footsteps behind him echoing loudly, but there were still too many people between him and a safe apparition point. Just as he was about to stop and confront the man, he turned only to see that no one was there. He turned back and reached for his wand, but it was too late, someone had stunned him and he was being whipped along in a side apparition.
“I know, Georgie because I spend a lot of time in the library researching charms and potions to use for our extracurricular activities,”
“Greg,” she said, motioning for Harry to keep his mouth shut. “I’m just going for a walk, you know, to clear my head.”
“There must be something,” Hermione muttered. “They’d never have set a task that was undoable.” Ron looked like he wanted to disagree, but kept his mouth shut as Hermione shouted, “There has to be a way. There just has to be!”
Harry returned to his room, and slept like the dead. Happy with the knowledge that his friends were okay. Sirius was free. Remus was happy. So, he slept.
Harry, Ron, and Neville had spent the majority of that night in the library preparing. Ron had spent most of the evening giving him advice such as “If he tries to curse you, you better dodge it, because I can’t remember
Blaise touched the gift from his mother. The object of discussion was a rather large diamond choker and chain that Blaise’s mom had sent after Blaise had “forgotten” to reply to a few of her letters since he came back to school. Blaise kept each of the letters in a neat pile on his desk unopened and collecting dust. The stack was a good five inches tall, and Blaise was getting letters nearly every other day.
“Really, Bulstrode? We’re about to take on a corrupt teacher whose trying to bring back the darkest wizard in our time, and you’re not going to fly with us because Pansy and her minions don’t like you because you’re different.”
Harry wondered how his well-dressed arse was going to get out of this one, when the attendant at the door made an announcement.
As Harry was walking to his room, he overhead some yelling from Percy and Ron’s room. “You’re not going anywhere until you’ve found my badge!” yelled Percy.
“Precisely,” said Professor Lupin. “It’s always best to have company when dealing with a boggart. He becomes confused, do I become a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug.” Tracey Davis let out a shrill sound of alarm.
“I agree with Sirius,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Harry is only fifteen years old. He is way too young to be dealing with stuff like this. The Order does not induct children.”
“Oh no, only the redheads,” said Mr. Weasley. “This is Hermione, friend of Ron’s and Harry, another friend.”
The storm seemed to pick up then, the lightning and wind seemed to whip the canopy above their heads like it was bent on taking it off. Then Harry saw it, a sky full of dementors. And one was chasing down Seamus Finnigan. The professors in their stand clamored for calm, but everyone was running as the dementors fell down on them. Oliver Wood was being knocked about by huge gusts of wind. Flint, beside Harry tensed, as the game went on. Then people saw them. The dementors in clear view. Harry turned to tell Millicent to run when he was shoved backward. Millicent was swept away by the people around them and Harry was lost.
“They’re a bit like Dean and I really, I had just assumed that we were going to go with them as a foursome, but then Dean had said that someone had asked him to go. When I asked him who, he had said a guy from Durmstrang. He had said that he had waited for someone else to ask him for awhile but since they didn’t seem like they were willing….he had said yes.. to this other guy.”
“Yes,” huffed Hermione, like she had already explained this once. “But it’ll be fascinating to study them from the Wizarding point of view,” she said, and her tone reminded him sharply of Millicent.
“Don’t expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I cannot make you take Sirius Black seriously. But I would have thought that what you hear when the dementors draw near would have more of an effect on you. Your parents gave their lives to keep you alive, Harry.  A poor way to repay them, gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks.”
“See you there?” asked Harry, ignoring the glares of his housemates who were eyeing him skeptically.
The beast approached a white face Nott and the group took a collective step back with him. Harry looked to Professor Lupin for his usual encouragement, only catching a glimpse of the man as Nott finally shouted the spell, dispelling the boggart.
He couldn’t blame him really. Octavian had seen the way they were in the office. The starting and finishing of sentences, the rise and fall of their daily life that echoed between them as smooth as glass. In the field it had saved them too many times to count, but in Harry’s personal life it had been more a burr in his arse than anything.
Images of the graveyard flashed in Harry’s mind, and he knew that at some point he would have to see the son’s and daughter’s of the men who had tried to kill him. He would have to eat at the same table, sleep in the same room, and go to the same classes with the very people who may now have orders to do him harm. He knew that Hogwarts and Dumbledore offered him some measure of protection, but that didn’t change the fact the very people he lived and slept with now served a different master. A master who wanted him dead at all costs.
“Yes, you did, Potter,” said Pansy, butting into the conversation. “Your mentor probably just didn’t think that the great Harry Potter needed anyone’s help.”
People joined them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called:
“You got off easy, mate,” said Fred Weasley as he sat down beside the pair, his brother taking the spot on their other side.
Of course, if you have comments or questions, you can leave a comment here or hit me up at my home away from home, Tumblr @ inkdrinkershadowsinger
Harry had to be up early, but the rest of his house came up the stairs soon enough, Draco Malfoy at their head. He was wearing dress robes of black velvet with a high collar and his hair was jelled back in a slightly different way than usual. He looked… decent as he strode over to Fleur Delacour and took her hand.
“Yes, we’ll that doesn’t mean that we should,” said the female second year that Harry knew had Draco. “My mentor said that we should just keep our heads down. Life is hard enough for us second years, we don’t need to antagonize a fifth year who is roommates with one of our prefects.”
A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn’t realized how loudly they had been talking.
“Oh,” Pansy said, finally catching up to what Harry was talking about. “That’s different,” she said.
Great. Harry could survive having Snape dock points, but not Dumbledore and certainly not in front of the whole school.
Crouch, in the custody of Dumbledore and with a mouth full of Veriterserum confessed to everything. His sick mother had convinced his father to grant her one last wish. To save their son from Azkaban. She took his place and the dementors never suspected a thing. No one did. She died but they buried his body.
Millicent eyed Harry wearily as if to make sure that he was alright, and motioned to Fred and George, George of who was nearly passed out on the ground. Harry laughed as George’s more together brother tapped him on the cheeks lightly to spur him from the stupor the Veelas’ dance had put him in.
“I know who you are. I need to see them, sir, my parents, please...” Harry said making a mad dash away from the man whose grip suddenly slackened enough so that he could get away and get back to the mirror.
“I expect, Mr. Nott, that you are pleased more with the light workload than any real fondness for Professor Lupin. I would expect first years to be able to deal with Red Caps and Grindylows. That’s why today, we will be discussing werewolves. Everyone turn to page 394.”
By the time Harry was in the air, Pucey had gotten their penalty shot, and the score was tied. Harry had never played Chaser before, but he was sure that he could manage. Put the Quaffle through the hoop, don’t get slammed by a
Harry nodded, not needing a verbal cue, then the pair set to changing her together. They worked to take care of her nappy and then hand her back to Draco so she could finish being changed as smoothly as they could.
Harry heard Pansy call, “Draco!” in what he had deemed her “teacher voice” and Draco’s hands were suddenly on his shoulders.
“Viktor Krum!” was the echo that ran around the Great Hall as the man walked confidently into the room. Even a few people at Harry’s own table looked lost for words. Tracey Davis looked as if she was about to pass out. Then Harry was pretty sure she did when Viktor and the other Durmstrang students sat at their table. Malfoy bent over to speak to Krum. The Durmstrang students pulled off their heavy furs and looked up at the starry sky with interest. A couple of them were picking up the golden plates and goblets and examining them with interest. Karkaroff, Durmstrangs headmaster sat at the head table.
“You dropped it?” repeated Mr. Diggory in disbelief. “Is that a confession? You threw it aside after you conjured the Dark Mark?”
Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every
“It’s a two way mirror,” Sirius said. “Your dad and I used to use them when we were in separate detentions. I have one as well, and with them, we can communicate no matter the distance.”
“Accio, Egg!” he called halfhazardly, part of him knowing that it wouldn’t be that simple. Sadly, the dragon heard that failed attempt too and swatted at his body like a human swats at a nat.
He looked gaunt and wild, nothing like the normally well-dressed, put together, impeccable image he normally presented to the world. Harry hadn’t seen him all week, but had gone over every variation of what could happen when they met again, but he could have never thought of this.
Ely McGovern was standing in the middle of the common room, dripping water onto the carpet from his clothes. Cassius stood in front of him.
“Wow!” she said when she saw them. “Ginny, I never would have guessed you were hiding that in your family tree,” Millicent said as she eyed Charlie as he lifted Ginny’s trunk onto the train.
They had taken it by surprise, but it was clear they were getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.
“Because….” Lupin hesitated. “because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school. They’d think it extremely entertaining.”
“No, look, everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles, three are poisons, two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back. He’s your head of house, what do you know about Snape
Alone in the Manor, Draco would spend the night’s cleaning every surface that nosey aurors had traipsed through and every room Voldemort had ever set eyes on, without magic. But some nights, some days he would be unable to leave his bed. He was an outcast from society and separated from his family, and was dealing with his new status of traitor. Death Eater scum. He had to block the Floo and shore up the wards even after Potter had testified on behalf of he and his mother. Even among his fellow Slytherins who were still licking their own wounds, it was a case of turning up their noses and whispering about how the mighty had fallen.
He was just about to go and get something to drink when he felt the bed dip beside him. He assumed it was Ron, and decided to wait a little longer before getting out of bed, not wanting to wake him. Then he felt an arm sling over his shoulder.
“You’ve got this,” Professor Lupin encouraged. Professor Lupin moved to the wardrobe and opened the door. For a moment, nothing happened then a giant, meaty hand gripped the other door and out walked a giant troll.
“Sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends, askin’ her photos…knew yeh didn’ have any…d’yeh like it?”
There was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them and Stan and Ern appeared, carrying Harry’s trunk and Hedwig’s cage and looking around excitedly.
Before Voldemort could sneak his head around the tombstone, Harry stood up…he gripped his wand tightly in his hand, faced Voldemort and cried, “Expelliarmus!” the same time Voldemort cried, “Avada Kedavra!”
“You! You will go back to the castle, and finish what you started.” Moody disapparated on the spot. “And you,” he said turning to the man who was shaking violently.
Draco seemed bent on talking to him, taunting him about his declaration the day of the second task. Draco had asked Harry if he would like his parents to adopt him. The thought of totting around with his nose stuck in the air and living under Lucius Malfoy’s thumb was enough to turn his stomach. Harry had said thanks, but even though he could probably pull of the blonde that he held no desire for the Malfoy family stick or whatever to be permanently shoved up his bum.
“Now!” Harry yelled; he pulled the wand upward with an almighty wrench, and the golden thread broke; the cage of light vanished, but the shadowy figures of Voldemort’s victims did not disappear, they were closing in upon Voldemort shielding Harry from his gaze. And Harry ran as he had never run in his life, knocking two Death Eaters aside as he passed. They offered no resistance. Spells and curses zipped past his head. He heard Voldemort scream, “Stun him!”
Then after making sure that the door was locked, and that no one could hear them from the outside, Draco started unbuttoning his robes.
“Now, I think I must be mistaken because I thought when I woke up this morning that I was in Hogwarts, is that not true?”
“Yes, Mr. Flint,” Madam Hooch said patiently, looking at his head to see if maybe he had a head injury as well. “That is Harry Potter.”
“I am Severus Snape your Head of House, and Potions professor here at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry which all of you are lucky to attend. Your noble house was founded by none other than Salazar Slytherin one of the great Hogwarts four, and I expect all of you to protect the dignity of this house.”
“It was Malfoy,” Harry said aloud, reminding himself and other parts of his body that those thoughts were not ones that he could entertain.
Harry ushered the two of them out leading them down another hallway and into another Filch right on their heels.
Draco was going to say no, absolutely not, never in a million years that he could very well deal with the pain, but then… Harry Potter closed his eyes.
Warrington who had received instruction from Voldemort eyed Harry who was still shaking from the after effects of the torture curse. On shaky legs himself, Warrington reached out and handed Harry his wand.
The journey to King’s Cross was very uneventful compared with Harry’s trip on the Knight Bus. The Ministry drivers were very efficient in getting them out of the cars, loaded up and to the platform.
“Black was a supporter of You-Know-Who. All of his supporters were tracked down, weren’t they, Ern? Most of them knew it was all over wiv You-Know-Who gone, and they came quiet. But not Sirius Black. I ‘eard he thought ‘ed be second in command once You-Know-‘O had taken over. They cornered Black in the middle of a street full of muggles an’ Black took out ‘is wand and ‘e blasted the street apart, an’ a wizard got it, an’ so did a dozen Muggles that got in the way. An’ you know what Black did then?” Stan continued in a dramatic whisper.
“He did,” said Fudge heavily. “And then, barely a week after the Fidelius Charm had been performed….”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said. “Sorry, that you have to be here. That you have to do this, but it can be over….”
Ron struggled to stand. His leg looking shattered and weak as it fought to support him. “You can’t have Harry!” he shouted. “You’ll have to go through all of us first.”
George then stalked off in the direction of Angelina Johnson, pulled a whisbee from his pocket, and promptly launched it at her dancing partner.
Loving him was never the problem. Harry couldn’t fight the hope, and he couldn’t wait anymore. He had wanted to kiss Draco Malfoy for a very long time. He leaned down, and kissed him square on the lips. Draco pulled away, and eyed him skeptically.
“Anyone but pretty boy Diggory,” Seamus had said. Harry looked naturally to Dean to agree with this, but Dean seemed to think that Diggory would do quite well in the tournament which launched the two into a very intense argument which seemed to be all the pair of “best friends” seemed to be up for lately.
With Pettigrew’s confession officially on file, Sirius Black was put on probation pending further investigation. He would be sent to live with Remus Lupin until the whole matter could be sorted. Pettigrew would be going to Azkaban, where he belonged, Harry thought. After the ministry got all the information out of him that they could, Harry hoped they would let him be tossed to the dementors.
“What?” Harry said. “No, you’re safe. We’re back at the school.” But Millicent was throwing off the covers over her legs and rising from the bed.
“Thanks,” Draco said. And in a swift motion, Harry took Rose from his arms, allowed Draco to wave his wand at his soiled clothes, then took a wave at Harry’s shirt as he hadn’t quite gotten it off Rose, then Draco motioned to Harry that she needed to be changed.
“You’re a witch, which makes you different. You’re a brilliant witch, which makes you even more different. And you’re the kind of person who calls people out on their crap and who willingly goes with two kids who don’t know that
Draco ducked between Laing and Jude, two burly auror buddies whose bulk, Draco hoped would block him further from Harry’s view. The slight tingling feeling up and down his neck alerted Draco to Harry’s position. In a world full of magic, proximity charms and alerts, there was nothing quite like Harry’s eyes on him. Draco couldn’t explain it. In the past few years, he had studied magical theory intensely. But even he couldn’t explain how he always knew when Harry’s eyes were on him.
Everyone seemed to have an input and everyone seemed to think that Dumbledore had the answers. But the only person that Dumbledore wanted to talk to was him.
Due to the upset of third year friendships apparently no longer in vogue Trewlaney finally let some people switch seats, but then saddled them all with extra homework. They were to create a detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect them, with references to their personal chart. And she wanted it next week.
Ron looked like he had been abruptly woken from a vivid dream while Fred like Harry, merely looked a little dazed. Malfoy further down the aisle looked as if he hadn’t been affected at all. Harry wondered at that before he saw Draco remove something from his ears.
“What does that have to do with anything?” said Flint. “We could have had this thing in the sky as soon as you got it. I mean, we should go right now. It’s a bit dark, but I’m sure Snape would right us a pass,”
“He will be back. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share…not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; which shows just how little mercy he has for his followers or
Harry nearly giggled at the look of horror on Pansy’s face, but knew that the girl would stay satisfied and silent since she was getting what she wanted most. Harry turned to check on Millicent then, but the girl was already stirring.
“Fleur? Are you insane?” Ginny had asked her shell shocked brother who was barely able to speak since he had done the unthinkable. They were outside at the scene of the crime, or as most people called it, the courtyard. Several people were gathered around a stunned Ron as he explained what had happened.
George kept glancing at Angelina Johnson with a longing sort of look that Harry thought matched Pansy’s non-looks at Malfoy.
Draco turned to face him, his knee brushing Harry’s. “Each year, all fourth year Slytherin students get a first year to help and mentor. Snape allowed you to be exempt last year because of the tournament, but this year, it’s time to do your part.”
Everyone heard. It seemed as if no one had left the halls except for the staff. No one planned to miss this.
“Forgot?” said Stan weakly. “Blimey, my ‘earts goin’ that fast…” Harry gave him a look that said continue. After Stan stopped shaking he went on.
“Isn’t he beautiful?” Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke it’s head, not backing down when it snapped at his fingers, showing it’s fangs.
“There is bad wizards about!” she squeaked distractedly as she leaned forward and labored to keep running. It looked as if she had just escaped some invisible force instead of a thorny bush. “People high…high in the air! Winky is getting out of the way!”
But, if Draco didn’t have his mark then no one would be able to prove anything, and Harry would stay free. He’d never have to see or think of Draco ever again.
Warrington walked stiffly towards Voldemort, and it was then that Harry noticed the blank look in the boy’s eyes. He was under the imperious curse.
“Well, as we haven’t got one anymore,” said Mr. Weasley, “….and as I work there, they’re doing me a favor.”
Draco apparated them both to the hospital. Draco was the one who had been there during the last horrific trip to the hospital. Harry prayed that this wouldn’t be another one of those trips. Ron and Hermione deserved happiness. And no one, Harry was convinced would be better parents. Well, except for Draco. It was the tender way that he had cared for Ron and Hermione after that first miscarriage that truly made the pair start to understand Harry’s faith in the man. Draco had helped Harry help his two grieving friends find some solace after their devastating loss.
“Thanks, Blaise,” said Harry. He threw the cloak over him and Millicent and the two left the common room.
“Ely wouldn’t,” Warrington started and then, “You’re probably right. Be a shame if we had to live on conjugal visits. And here I thought we were finally going to get to live together, alone, for the first time in seven years. Then again, he’s smart enough to not get caught…so..”
At least, the last one would give him something to say when people asked him what he did this summer. Unless, his luck followed him and he got a notice about him violating the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry for using magic outside of Hogwarts.
Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Aside from the snide remarks and jokes that he, Crabbe, and Goyle seemed to enjoy making at his expense, he mostly left Harry alone. Blaise on the other hand had no such qualms. Harry could hardly understand the other boy. To a lot of the Slytherins he was the equivalent of a social pariah, but Blaise seemed to stick with him regardless. He sat beside him in lessons, and at meals, but he never openly spoke out against Malfoy and his gang when he heard them laughing at Harry.
He turned, hallway along the third-floor corridor, to see Fred and George, peering out at him from behind a statue of a humpbacked, one-eyed witch.
“There you go,” he said and watched the hulking owl fly off into the distance. He had to get into town, the Firebolt was waiting. He was wondering where he’d have lunch, when someone yelled his name and he turned.
“Those two?” a voice said from the top of the stairs. “Dumbledore would have had to truly lose it to make you two anything close to prefects.”
“He died trying to protect me. He died fighting for what was right. He broke the imperious curse for me, and for himself…for the life that he will now never get to live. Ely…”
“Thirdly, to Mr. Harry Potter…,” said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet… “For pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Slytherin sixty points.”
Hermione to me when she's championing the house elves, she is championing all of the repressed. She feels that way as a Muggleborn even in the early books, and it makes me love her more that she took this stand in the books.
“Exactly, and yet, we are here in this room together making the same mistakes. You have memories from two.. wizards.”
The teachers had tried to stop it, but no one could seem to get the howlers to quiet. Quite a few of them had set off to get Professor Flitwick. Millicent continued to eat her breakfast. Only those closest to her could see that her hand was beginning to shake. But she was proud. She was a snake, and she was not going to let these people see her break. But Harry knew that it was getting close and that a person could only take so much. Some of the other Slytherins had tried to form a circle around her, but anytime one of them got close, the howlers would seem to attack. It was like they wanted to make sure that Millicent could be seen by the whole populous.
Harry thought for a moment of trying to see if Professor McGonagall would sigh his slip, but thought better of it.
He could see Draco remembering their time in the safe house, and Harry too remembered the feel of Draco’s body so close to his own. It wasn’t the first time that Harry had thought about the feel of Draco, and it certainly wouldn’t be last. Harry remembered every moment between them. Every look. Every question answered before he could ask. Every time he watched Draco, and the boy looked up because he could just feel Harry’s eyes on him. Every minute that Harry wished that Draco was near because there was something that he had to tell him right then. Every time. Everything.
He leaned over and kissed Hermione lightly on the cheek. The girl blushed prettily, and the matter was forgotten.
“Mil?” Harry ventured, when a rush of a breeze blew past him. It felt cold like it had on the train, but Dumbledore sai… A black mass moved in the corner at the same time another bumped into him, and he fell to the floor, his wand falling out of his sight and clanging away out of reach. He could hear Millicent struggling in earnest now as a hooded figure loomed over him. He screamed, flailing his arms upward, hitting something solid.
Dobby looked confused between Hermione and her righteous anger and Blaise and his rather impressive impression of a kicked puppy.
“She is,” said Blaise. “She is pudgy, and her nose is a little,” he made a motion with his hand near his face, “but man is she something else. Some stuckup Ravenclaws were giving her a hard time at the Ball so I waltzed over and asked her for a waltz. I had only planned on one dance, but she was just….”
“I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. He had turned white. “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid.”
Moody began to beckon the students forward, and each bristled slightly under his wand. Harry watched as, one by one, his classmates did the most extraordinary things under the curses influence. Tracey Davis got on her hands and knees and moo’d like a cow. Crabbe grabbed Blaise and pulled him into an embrace and took him around in a version of the waltz, not caring how much Blaise was struggling in his arms until Moody too, made Blaise forget that he cared at all. Draco hopped on one leg, a seemingly tame action, but one that clearly brought back some painful memories because he kept brushing his backside as if he were checking for a tail.
“Azkaban, he won’t be getting out of it this time. Those contacts that you have been working gave him up as fast as they could.”
“Well,” huffed Seamus. “He’s my best friend and he only deserves the best, and…and…that guy clearly isn’t it, that’s all.”
Harry thought back to that night, and the way that Malfoy’s body had changed from then to now. Harry knew that he himself looked different, too. Harry was glad that it seemed that Malfoy had yet to put two and two together, though he suspected that Blaise knew more than he was telling. Blaise somehow seemed to know everything. He and his mother were similar in that way.
“He’s got losts o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey,” said Hagrid in a muffled voice. “An’ I’ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.”
“He said my blood would make him stronger than if he’d used someone elses,” Harry told them. “He said the protection my mother left in me…he’d have it too. And he was right, he could touch me without hurting himself, he touched my face.’
Harry shook his head. “But they’re most likely working right now. We should hear something by tomorrow for sure.”
Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet.
Draco entered the meeting purposefully late. Harry was always early, and seats at the table usually filled up quickly which meant that Draco could get a spot along the back of the wall, hopefully out of Harry’s eye line. He entered right as Shacklebolt was standing.
“It’s okay, Harry, wanting the best for family doesn’t stop just because they don’t want the same for you. It’s engrained in us to want good things for family and to want them to love us back.”
Several people screamed….Harry felt something white-hot graze the side of his face…he plunged his hand into his robes for his wand, but before he’d even touched it, he heard a second loud BANG, and a roar that echoed throughout the entrance hall.
“From your betrothed?” asked Blaise. Millicent went to shake her head, no….when Goyle with a mouth full of food grabbed his heart as if he were having pains, and said, “So does this mean you’re rejecting my offer?”
“Don’t mention it, Dobby, it was merely a present for the work you do for the school,” Blaise added, sounding a bit rehearsed.
Then the dementor dissolved into a white orb, which Professor Lupin quickly cast away as he called for Pansy.
Harry turned around at the sound of Hermione’s voice calling to them, and his mouth went slack jawed.
Harry walks to the table, and sits down where Remus is reading a copy of the daily prophet. He puts the paper to the side discretely.
Mr. Weasley bowed out, not eager to get on Mrs. Weasley’s bad side. Harry couldn’t blame him. Then the twins stepped up.
“Well then, Miss Bulstrode, nice to see you’re making friends.” Snape looked like friends was anything other than a positive word.
Malfoy laughed. “Then let’s just say that I get to be in charge of your campaign. Harry, the true Hogwarts champion.”
“From being inducted into the Malfoy family. Being blonde is more than just a suggestion in that family, and I’m honestly not sure that you would be able to pull it off.”
The weighing of the wands was a mere formality it turned out. Bagman explained that it was just to test that the champion’s wands were fully functional. After that and an actual photo shoot, Harry met Rita Skeeter, a reporter for the Daily Prophet. Her hair was set in elaborate and curiously rigid curls. She wore jeweled spectacles, and had her fingers clutched around a crocodile skinned handbag.
Harry huffed and followed Flint back to the dormitory obediently, wondering if they might stop into Professor McGonagall’s office or Flitwick’s so that he could complete his rounds of turning every teacher in the school against him.
“I know,” Fred said, jerking his arm away from George. “I know, but it wasn’t my fault that the plan went to crap. And it’s not my fault that you didn’t ask her when you should have done. You’ve practically been in love with the girl since second year.”
He managed to open his eyes to see that the ground was a lot closer than it had seemed earlier. Harry would have crashed had it not been for someone casting, “Aresto Momentum” on him and his broom before he touched ground.
“Look, I saw Lord Voldemort come back!” Harry shouted. “I saw the Death Eaters. I can give you their names. Malfoy. Avery.”
“That was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid’s first class, though, wasn’t it?” said Ron, looking worried. “Trust Malfoy to mess things up for him….”
Harry knew Malfoy wasn’t stupid, but he also knew he wasn’t going to keep this to himself. Malfoy was going to tell, he was just going to tell someone who had more authority to get Hagrid in trouble.
Draco never thought he’d be here. Sitting on a bean bag chair in Luna Lovegood’s living room staring up at a mural of Harry Potter. But here he was.
Pansy kept staring daggers. Harry kept wondering where she put her wand in that dress and just how quick she could get to it before he had the opportunity to get out of the way. Though, her plan was definitely working, Malfoy despite the crowd of people that he had around him, kept glancing at them before covering it up with a obviously fake laugh.
The whole thing made Harry feel off. Thankfully, the girls had continued their corral, and sat around him at dinner, keeping the conversation moving fluidly.
“It seems…almost impossible…that Black could have entered the school without inside help. I did express my concerns when you appointed….”
“Yeah,” said Harry, looking quickly toward the door, but the creature had vanished. “What happened? Where’s that….that thing? Who screamed?”
“Ha,” Harry scoffed, that adorable face of his scrunching up in mock offence. “I have no idea what you’re talking about,” he defended.
couple of weeks now. Young Percy, his assistant says he’s ill. Apparently, he’s just been sending instructions by owl. But let’s not spread that around, huh, Harry. Wouldn’t want Rita Skeeter making it more than it is. Barty Crouch is not Bertha Jorkins,” Bagman said, though he looked about as convinced as Harry felt.
“Accio Firebolt!” he shouted. Harry waited, every fiber of him hoping, praying….then, he heard it speeding through the air behind him. He turned and saw his Firebolt hurtling toward him around the edge of the woods before entering the enclosure, stopping midair, waiting for him to mount. He swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from the ground, but then something happened. The whistle that signaled the next contestant sounded again and the Horntails attention was drawn to the sound before it stopped on Harry.
waiting. Malfoy said nothing even as he begrudgingly gave up Fang and stalked back toward the castle.
Harry smiled, that was as close to gleaming praise that Marcus had ever given anyone, so Harry was going to take it.
Shaken, the class followed. “They should fire him straight away!” said Pansy Parkinson, her face streaked with tears.
Then Lupin seemed to study him again, his tie and the cut on his cheek that he hadn’t bothered to get healed.
So, when Millicent got up and headed out the doors of the Great Hall, Harry noticed. Harry was about to stand to follow her out when Professor Quirrel came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face.
The office looked different now than it did under Lockhart and Remus. What appeared to be a mirror hung opposite Harry on the wall, but it was not reflecting the room. Shadowy figures were moving around inside it, none of them clearly in focus.
It happened very suddenly. The hook nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes--- and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead.
But that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.
“Hermione,” said Hagrid. “She’s in a right state, that’s what. She’s bin comin’ down ter visit me a lot since Chris’mas. Bin feelin’ lonely. It not her fault her cat….”
“Very well,” Snape snapped. “Potter leave your things here. I want you back down here later to test your antidote.”
“Well, I do have a special gift with trolls. Severus halted me even then though that three-headed dog did manage to mangle him a bit.”
“I met him!” growled Hagrid. “I musta bin the last ter see him before he killed all them people! It was me what rescued Harry from Lily an’ James’s house after they was killed! Jus’ got him outta the ruins, poor little thing, with a great slash acorss his forehead, an’ his parents dead….an’ Sirius Black turns up, on that flyin’ motorbike he used ter ride. Never occurred ter me what he was doin’ there. I didn’ know he’d bin Lily an’ James’s Secret-Keeper. Thought he’d jus’ heard the news o’ You-Know-Who’s attack an’ come ter see what he could do. White an’ shakin’ he was. An’ yeh know what I did? I COMFORTED THE MURDERIN’ TRAITOR!” Hagrid roared.
“are not your friends. They might consider you a classmate, but some of them, some of their families answer to a higher authority now than that of school spirit.”
Draco was apparently very aware of the prefect’s bathroom. He flicked his wand at the nozzles to turn on the hot water and then at others in what seemed to be a very specific series of bubbles and green balm that tinted the water.
Harry eyed the witches fake two inch crimson nails and tried to remember which colors meant a witch couldn’t be trusted and which meant that she secretly hates her mother.
“Well, really, I had to don’t you know,” said an irritable Fudge. “Black is mad, magic on muggles. I have the Prime Minister’s assurance that he will not breathe a word of Black’s true identity to anyone. And let’s face it…who’d believe him if he did?”
At breakfast the next morning, Ron was the one to meet him at the entrance to the Great Hall. Everyone turned to him and looked, a few stood up to get a closer look and then people were applauding.
Harry shrugged, that was true. Blaise had sent him plenty of letters detailing his mother’s whirlwind romance with a wealthy French wizard and her decision to move them at least semi-permanently to the South of France. Blaise and his two younger sisters were now living in the lap of luxury, and letters that had started out like “Won’t you come down, Potter? Get yourself a taste of the good life?” And “Potter, the man has a yacht. I’ve already bought you a first mates cap.” Quickly became “Ariella and Jasmine are becoming quite overwhelming. Must every woman in my family be blinded by pretty things? Thank Merlin, I am immune to such flights of fancy. Come and assure me that I am the prettiest flower or my self-esteem my never recover.” Then “We’ll take care of the Muggles, don’t worry. Mother performs a wicked memory charm. Lockhart has nothing on what my mother can do when faced with someone’s very angry wife.”
“I see,” said Lupin thoughtfully. “Well, well….I’m impressed.” He smiled slightly at the look of surprise on Harry’s face. “That suggests that what you fear the most of all is…fear. Very wise, Harry. Perhaps you have a bit of Ravenclaw in you.”
“You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the ground and you’ve got your little friends with you,” said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers,
Blaise laughed again. Whatever Slytherin chess match this was Harry could recognize easily that he was out of his depth.
He looked at Harry expectantly, but impatiently. Harry’s mouth went dry. But after everything Ely had just said for him, he could say something for Warrington.
A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table. Harry stopped, he wasn’t sure if he could do this. It seemed as if everyone else was already in the Great Hall, and he would be one of the last to enter. Maybe he should just turn around and go back to the hospital wing, surely someone would bring him some food. Even they didn’t, it wouldn’t be the first time he went to bed without dinner.
At eight o’clock on Thursday evening, Harry left Gryffindor Tower for the History of Magic classroom. It was dark and empty when he arrived, but he lit the lamps with his wand and had waited only five minutes, when Professor Lupin turned up, carrying a large packing case, which he heaved onto Professor Binns’ desk.
In a bid to escape his own reality, Harry took to observing Winsome with the invisibility cloak. Blaise thought he was going a little overboard, but Harry decided that he should take his new mentor status seriously.
While Millicent was in the tunnel with Lupin, she had idea. With all of that Slytherin cunning she knew that they had to cover their asses in case somehow Harry’s brilliant plan and the weak binds around Pettigrew’s wrists weren’t enough to hold him. So, she had made a decision.
Malfoy had said something about Warrington not looking like a champion, too big, too slow, but he looked more like a champion than Harry and his gangly limbs. Warrington was the real Hogwarts champion. He carried himself with confidence, and his friend, the tall, handsome one with blue eyes and dark blonde hair that seemed to be permanently attached to Warrington’s hip was charming and was more than enough to help Warrington field the horde of girls who approached him after lunch one day asking for autographs. And here he thought that was reserved for the likes of Viktor Krum.
“You’re going to have to learn this, Potter, if you’re going to represent Slytherin house in front of the whole school.”
“This year is very important, like you heard Wood saying, but its not important because of the Cup, though, we’ll win that, too, of course.”
The three left the Great Hall, running into an arguing Fred and George. Malfoy walked by and did another impersonation of Harry fainting, his performance followed by a roar of laughter.
After Pansy spin Harry around like he was a dog on show for a good few minutes, the rest of the school joined them in the first dance. After a few dances, it was less traditional and more just everyone and their partner or partners just moving together and having a good time, the strict moves that had been drilled into Harry’s head nearly forgotten.
“You know as well as me that those can be altered.” Then Draco managed to sneak around him, and head to the upper floors. And he crushed Harry’s heart, “In case it wasn’t clear when I burned your mark off my body, or changed jobs then let me make it clearer, I want nothing to do with you. You didn’t want me and now I don’t want you.”
“Really grumpy?” Ron raised his eyes to the Heavens. “Who cares what he looks like? He’s unbelievable. He’s really young, too. He’s a genius, you’ll see.”
“Eloise Midgen?” said Hermione in surprise. “I saw you dancing at the ball, but I didn’t think you guys were…”
As the days went by Harry started looking wherever he went for any sign of his friends. He had already ran into Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan who had also stopped by to ogle at the new Firebolt. He had also ran into Neville Longbottom outside of Flourish and Blotts. Harry would have stopped to chat, but he had seen Neville’s rather formidable looking grandmother scolding Neville for apparently losing his books list. Harry took his out of his pocket, and dropped it outside of the door. At least, maybe then, if Neville forgot it at home, he might be saved.
Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. If he backed down now the rest of his time at Hogwarts would be spent doing the same thing. He wouldn’t be put back under the stairs.
“Meeting people,” elaborated Millicent. “Haven’t you noticed all of the different wizards here, from all over the country? My father knows a good investment opportunity when he sees one. He might be a barrister by title, but his heart runs gold.”
Pansy Parkinson now paced the length of the empty classroom they had conveyed in, eyeing each of them with stern disapproval. And since apparently all Slytherins were born with “unique grace and the innate style and knowledge of ballroom dancing” as Pansy had put it, Harry had been sent to dance lessons.
