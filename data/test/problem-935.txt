"I'll get Harry's Healer," Ron said, heading for the Floo. "She'll know what to do."
“No. You don’t need to announce me, Gilly,” Draco mutters. “I’ll go greet them myself.”
A few days later, Draco woke up and felt...different. He felt

"I decided to take a day off!" Ron said, a little too brightly. Then, as an afterthought, "Is
Harry turned to leave, and found his way blocked by the other, still very naked, man.
Harry stands, looking helpless and frustrated. "I know."
Harry spun Draco around and kissed him so fiercely he was bending him backward over his arm.
Harry did chuckle softly at that, tilting his head up to kiss him. "If you say so."
Harry woke up late in the afternoon and sat up, rubbing at his eyes. He glanced up at the clock on the night stand and groaned softly before doing a little math in his head; 4pm London time was...1am in Tokyo. So Draco probably wouldn't be awake for a bit.
"Gregory McDougal..." Harry mused, "Ron's Auror partner. I've met him briefly. What makes you think...?"
"Come back to bed, love," Draco crooned, an echo of Harry's words from the early hours of the morning. He fit himself to the line of Harry's back, pressed a kiss to his neck, set a hand to the outside of his hip. Harry leaned back into him, tossing his wand onto the nearby kitchen counter.
"Okay. Do you...um. Do you want company right now, or do you want to be alone?"
Draco was rendered speechless by this confession for a full minute.
Harry looks... different. It
"Well, that is sort of the point of a
You're as weak as he was. You'll ruin us."

"I didn't know what you liked," Harry said, looking embarrassed at the sheer volume of food, "so I got...options."
“Listen, um, Ollie gave me a couple of tickets so you can take Teddy to the P.U. versus the Cannons match this month while he’s with you.”
Bile rose in Harry's throat, sharp and bitter.

. I can’t lose you, too.”
that he was good for Harry.
“So, what made the biggest difference in Sixth Year?” Draco asks thoughtfully. “Was it easier for you to follow the instructions when they were in the book on the table beside you, as opposed to on a blackboard in a muggy classroom that probably fogged up your glasses and made it hard to see? Or was it having an instructor who wasn’t hellbent on making you look and feel like an idiot at every turn? A combination of the two, I’d imagine.”
"Must be a bloody fantastic shag, too," Weasley taunted, continuing in his previous vein. "To have held your attention this long, since you're 'not ready for a long-term relationship right now.' Or
Harry took her and kissed her squishy toddler cheek, leaning against the back of the sofa and shifting his weight off of his injured leg. "Hi Rosie!"
Harry’s teasing expression mellows. “Ah. Well, have fun.”
"I don't believe you."
“Shut it, Weasley.”
Hermione had wrung her hands in the background, nervously suggesting that they all have dinner soon.

He shook his head, trying to clear his thoughts. "Sorry. What?"
“I’ll wait here,” Draco manages to choke out.

"I've been here before," Draco says softly, and Harry turns to him, eyes going wide, "when I was eight or nine, I think? I don't know why they wanted to come, but we did. My parents forbid me from writing my name on the sign, but I waited until they weren't looking and signed my initials anyway. Just there—"
Harry has pulled his shirt back on as he followed me out, and now he's standing hesitantly at the end of the alleyway, calling me by my given name, and it's all just too much. I let out a choked sob, doubling over as if I've been sucker punched. It feels like I have.
“Secretly
Draco was staring blankly at the wall when the first rays of sunlight started to creep around the edges of the curtains.
Harry grinned. "No you wouldn't have, not after I saw that box. You wanted to throw it at my head, I could tell."
"The dragons on the reserve reminded me of you, actually." He smiles weakly. "I needed to get away, and then I didn't want to come back, and I... I only got back a few weeks ago, and I just assumed..."

Harry's grin turned positively feral.

"He was asking for it."
"Merlin, no!" He recoiled in shock. "Did you think that I would?"
As it turned out, the answer was a solid eleven. His grey eyes flashed furiously and he leapt out of the bed, determined to go end the two werewolves for their attempted seductions right that very second. Harry caught his wrist.
That startled George out of his stupor. "Yes, yes, of course! Erm, you take the chair, and we'll sit on the sofa."
I'd even failed at following through with my plan to protect him. I'd ruined everything for absolutely nothing. And fuck, I don't think I've ever hated myself more.
accidental magic? ...Possibly. Who can say for sure?
Draco nodded thoughtfully, trailing a hand through Harry's thick hair. "So he wasn't always..."
"Would I what?"
Are you
Harry groans and tugs at Draco's robes, ripping buttons off in his hurry to get them off, to get at Draco's bare skin.
Kasper nodded. "Of course."
Harry rolls his eyes again, leaving Draco on the bed to go fill up the bathtub.
He startles when Ron Weasley stumbles into the back room, Marie on his heels.
Draco realizes what a terrible
Draco finds himself unable to focus on his studying after that. Harry looks peaceful, almost childlike, in sleep. Looking at him like this, it's hard to imagine the Savior Persona the rest of the Wizarding World sees when they look at him: Harry Potter, Destroyer of a Dark Lord. Here,

"You keep saying that, and then something new happens."

"Mine," Draco said softly. "You weren't...
Hermione focused all her will and energy into the spell as she tore off the cloak and pointed her wand at the Minister of Magic.
"C'mon, mate," Harry rounded on Ron as Draco left the room. "You promised you would try."
Both of Harry's friends relaxed.
“It’s a plan.”

Draco turned and walked out the door, shutting it softly behind him. Once outside, he Apparated back to his own flat, collapsed onto the sofa, and covered his face with his hands.

I run my fingers through his hair and capture his lips in another lingering kiss.

And Draco hadn't had to wait long. Less than 24 hours later, they were at it again.
“It’s alright, Harry. I haven’t forgotten what it’s like to be young and in love. In fact—“
"Yes," Draco grinned at Ron, "and

“Hey,” Draco reaches out to cup his face. “It’s okay. I know you didn’t mean for it to happen. It’s okay.”
All eyes turned on him and Draco felt a jolt of fear as he wondered briefly if the others would turn on him, but he stood firm, his wand pointed at the other man's chest.
Harry flopped back onto the bed and Draco shoved him aside so that he could clamber up beside him, draping an arm across his chest.
Harry gives him a wicked grin. “I’m Harry Potter!”
"Down the hall is the hospital wing where Christine runs the show. Down that hallway is the suite where he, Christine, and Marie live."
"Merlin, Potter, that was bad, even for you," Draco laughs, tugging him by the hand. "Let's go take that shower."
“That’s cheating, Malfoy!” He laughs, dangling from his broom by one hand as the Snitch whizzes away from them both.
The young man nodded imperceptibly, signaling his approval.

“That’s a pretty bleak outlook, Potter.”
"No," Draco sniffles, wiping at his eyes. "But I thought
"The very same," the man gave Harry a tired smile. "We've traveled a long way to find you, Mr. Potter."

"I've tried to write to you so many times since the war, but I never...I never could get the words right. I wanted to make amends, to meet you and Draco, but I just didn't know how—"
"Bye Harry! Bye Draco!"
Harry sets his drink aside and complies, Draco's eyes closing in contentment as his fingers start to run through his hair, easing the pain slightly.
Draco trails off as Harry's gaze softens, and his hand comes up to brush over his cheek.
"Oh. Okay. That's fine."
Draco watched as Harry and George walked out of the ballroom before Apparating across the grounds.
Potter groans and takes a long drink. “He truly doesn’t.”
"Do you really want to know?"

That’s
Kingsley Shacklebolt's secretary tried to stop him, but Ron barged right past her.
Draco stood frozen in place beside the trap door, staring at Harry, loving the sound of his favorite song on his lips, his own eyes tearing up against his will.
. The entire meal was lovely, and the motivation behind it made it taste all the better.
“Excellent,” Harry says, passing over a fork to go with it. “Tell me what you think.”
Harry falls asleep on Teddy’s bed with him in the middle of reading him a book about dragons, and Draco takes off Harry’s glasses for him, pulls a blanket over them both, and leaves them, wishing that things were different. He allows himself a rare moment of openly wishing that he could climb in with them next to Harry and the three of them could fall asleep together like that, a little family, before shoving the feelings down and going to bed.
"Quite alright, Mr. Potter," she said, still smiling. "Mind if I take a look at that leg of yours? Yes, you may stay right where you are, Mr. Malfoy." She added with an amused shake of her head.
“Of course! Do you want to come through? I just got home from practice.” She steps back to leave room for him. “I’ll make tea.”
" Harry seethes, his temper flaring again, "you'll just go get divorced and suddenly everything will be fine with us? Everything will just go back to the way it used to be?"
"No!" The boy shrieked. "No no no! I'm coming!"
Harry watched as they exchanged nervous smiles, and then the young woman nodded.
“Yes. It makes my skin crawl.”

"He did. This morning."
Harry's glare turned stony, and he raised his wand. He let some of the magic raging inside him loose, allowing the windows and the chandelier in the room to rattle. "And I'm saying come back with an Order from the Minister giving you permission to try and question me, or next time I won't be so friendly."
Harry laughed again, turning to grin at his best friend. "Sorry, we'll stop."
"Ah, he'll do great, too. And he'll have Teddy to look out for him."
He groaned. "What happened?"
Draco ends the call, not wanting to hear the answer. He carefully composes himself and waits.
Too exhausted to dwell on this grim thought for long, he closed his eyes and let his mind go blissfully dark once more.
"Because you were going to be my
Harry sighed. "I dunno, this is all so..." He waved a hand, unable to come up with the right word to accurately describe how he felt.
"Are you sure?"
And Curly might have continued to do so, if not for the Medical Release that had forced them to allow Draco Malfoy to visit.
She giggled. "Well, no, but there's a blanket over them."
After that, the room cleared out almost immediately. Kasper left last and closed the door behind him with an amused shake of his head.
“Draco,
Is it possible...can he still want me as badly as I want him?

the behavior?” Harry asks, voicing the question they’d both been thinking.
Harry steps through the Floo looking like he’s just come from a club. He’s wearing Sirius’s old leather jacket, ripped jeans, and the lace-up combat boots Draco gave him for Christmas last year. There’s smudged eyeliner around his eyes behind his glasses, and a smear of body glitter across one cheek—clearly transferred from someone
A few hours later, Draco had woken to a note on the bedside table, hastily written in Harry's distinctive, messy scrawl.
"You can't expect to be fully recovered already, love," Draco said softly. "He tried to tear you to shreds, and he very nearly succeeded. Give yourself time to heal."
"I believe our first order of business is to hold a funeral to honor Mathias," he said, and Nadine nodded her approval. "After that, we'll deal with the rest."
. I don't want to end this, I don't want to be away from you for a second,
“I didn’t understand why you seemed so anxious to leave when you came, why you wouldn’t want to get to know us. I thought you were being rude, but I was so
Draco flushes crimson at that. "Alright. So you all already knew. Bully for you."
"Ah, that's the thing." Harry smiled. "One of the guards stopped putting Wolfsbane in my food and water."
"Yes."
"Jeffords, Davis. Out."
"I'm sorry about yesterday," Harry finally murmured, "I was awful to you. You didn't deserve that."
“What, darling?” Draco murmurs against his lips.
. This will never work. What does he want from me? A sordid affair? He’s bored of his little Pureblood wife already? I can’t do that, I can’t
Harry tells him about his nerves as he gets closer to taking his exams to get into the Healer Program at St. Mungo’s, and the study he’s been doing to prepare for the Herbology portion of the test. He talks about going flying with Ginny, and the bruise he’d gotten when she punched him on the arm for leaving before her party, and things almost feel normal between them again. Draco supposes it’ll just take a bit more time.
But he knew exactly when it had happened. He remembered that beautiful, glowing full moon. He'd admired it before Apparating home from the front step of Grimmauld Place.
Draco blinked at the two Junior Aurors on his doorstep. "A noise complaint? The DMLE has

are the best damn thing that's ever happened to me, Draco.
Harry lights the fireplace and settles on one end of the sofa while Draco perches on the edge beside him, setting his glass down on the coffee table in front of him. He doesn’t particularly like Firewhisky, but he decides he’ll take a few sips later to be polite.
will." Harry grinned.
In the hallway, he starts panicking slightly, desperately hoping Harry had been asleep. He’d seemed like he was, his breathing was slow and steady, but if he wasn’t, would he think that Draco kissing his forehead was weird? Would he—
"Draco?"
Harry slid out of their bed and pulled on his typical jeans, t-shirt, and leather jacket. He murmured a soft goodbye as he slipped out of the room.
"I'm glad." Christine smiled back. "Speaking of, Harry, I'd better get home, now that Sofia and Kasper are healed and I know you're okay."
"Draco?" Harry says sleepily, looking around. "What...? Oh. We fell asleep. Sorry, didn't mean to..."
“Mm, yes, but also
"M'alright," he slurred as he lost consciousness, slumping to the ground.
Now it's Draco's turn to blush. "I just thought you might be hungry."
"Really? That's...huh. Er, how long ago was that?"
Harry visibly cringes as he forces the words out. “I think I saw your boyfriend snogging and then leaving with another bloke at the club tonight.”
"Hi," she whispered awkwardly, "how is he?"
Draco stared at him for a second, then smiled slowly. "You're
"Hm," Harry nuzzled his neck again. "I'm glad. I've been going mad all morning waiting for you. How did your final exams go?"
"...I didn't mean to mess up our friendship, it's been so nice to have someone to talk to, someone who understands—"
Nadine laughed. "It was weird when you did it too, and I only use my powers for good. Go find your husband. I'm going to go get mine and round all the children up for lunch."
"So, everyone else will be locked in their cells, and Lorcan and I will be fighting here in the center?"
"IS IT TRUE?" Harry bellows, and Davis jumps.
As if Draco could deny her—she'd already curled up in her chair and started carefully thumbing through the worn and dusty pages. He laughed and exchanged an amused glance with Ron. "Sure."
Kasper and Grace were together, that much was clear. Kasper seemed to be third in command. Second, now that Lorcan was stripped of his title. He was clearly a respected leader in the group, but he immediately deferred to Harry now that he was awake.
Despite his careful attempt to wake Harry slowly, he still startles as if he's been given an electric shock, fumbling for his wand and breathing heavily, eyes darting around wildly.
Harry gasped in horror.
Harry let out a sigh of relief as he buried his face against Draco's neck, breathing in his familiar scent, the warmth of his body against him. "You're okay?"
At lunch, Paul watches Harry and Draco.
"Enter."
The fact that Harry treated him normally made being around him a safe haven that Draco never wanted to leave, and playing Quidditch together three times a week seemed to have both calmed his jittery need for movement and cemented their budding friendship more rapidly than anyone could have predicted.
She finally let up, backing off and breathing heavily. "Good. Don't ever do anything like that again."
“Okay, Teddy, I’ll stop. I promise.”
Ron took off his Auror robes and sat down in one of the chairs. "That's good. Is he still shaking?"
they be serious? I'm his
He slid out from under Harry, ignoring his weak protests, and climbed off the bed. He paused at the door and looked back. "Need anything while I'm out?"
Draco ignores the sound of the bell on the door ringing, continuing his work. Marie can deal with a few customers, and if she can’t she’ll let him know.
"The clock? Of course, dear! Let me...oh! It says he's at home now."
It’s been a long time since Teddy has screamed at either of them like this, and Draco doesn’t know what has triggered this particular episode, only that after nearly an hour of screaming and trying to get Teddy to go to bed, he’ll do almost
Draco glared at him. "I'm well aware of that, Weasley
"I brought lunch back from the kitchens for us," Harry said, sliding a hand into Draco's. "Let's get you something to eat, and then we'll go get you
Draco wasted no time taking in the sight of the old house. He ran inside and bolted down the stairs, with Ron on his heels. He quickly unlocked the barred door with a Spell and pushed his way into the dark room below the house.
“I haven’t been in a relationship every second of the past two years,” Draco says defensively. “It’s not like there haven’t been opportunities, moments, when he could have...if he wanted to say something, if he wanted
Draco curled up, clutched Harry's pillow to his chest, and sobbed.
"I feel stronger, but I haven't experimented with that at all. And it's harder to sit still for long periods of time. I went to Diagon Alley today because I thought I'd go mad if I spent one more minute alone in my flat trying to sit still, even though I wasn't ready for anyone to see me yet."
They’re both pissed within the hour.
“Ah, that’ll be Dudley. So, Harry, which bedroom was yours?”
Draco shrugs, still not looking at him, and Harry snaps. He takes him by the shoulders and forces him to meet his blazing expression. "I
The glowing stag leapt from his wand and canted around the room once more before dissolving into shimmering mist and then disappearing altogether. Ron had stumbled backward, his expression stricken. Rose giggled in her mother's arms and clapped in delight.
"Fine. Sorry."
"It really does, mate," Ron nodded in agreement.
Friends. They’re friends. Comforting your friend after a breakup is a good thing to do, right? This is fine, everything is fine.
With one last sincere apology, he sighed and ended the call.
Draco has to resist the urge to Accio something to throw at him. How the man has ever managed to cheat on anyone with a poker face like that is a mystery.
Harry sipped his butterbeer, watching his best friend's face. "So... How's work?"
Harry deftly rolled them over and started unbuttoning Draco's shirt, trailing kisses down his neck. Despite his weak token protest, Draco tipped his head back to give him better access.

“If I
"The building is surrounded. We have Anti-Apparation Wards in place for ten kilometers in every direction," Harry said. "If you surrender without a fight, we might be able to arrange for some kind of plea deal."
"Will it be safe?" The young woman asked. "He won't be...?"
"How did I do with the speech? Soppy enough for you?"
"I care about him. But I thought he didn't..."
"Just you," Draco sighed. "Until I go back to work on Monday, and then the whole world will know."
Draco pulls his pyjama bottoms and boxer briefs both down in one smooth movement, and Harry takes the moment to pull his own the rest of the way off, and then they’re naked in front of each other, and time seems to stop.

Ron Weasley walked into the Ministry the next morning still feeling the overwhelming sense of relief that had flooded through him upon finding Harry alive.
Draco sputtered. "
"I will."
By the time Saturday rolled around, Draco was a bit of a nervous wreck. This wasn't Quidditch, where he could just wear Muggle clothes like Harry and pull his hair back, this was a
But they were asleep now, Harry curled tightly around Draco's back, an arm thrown possessively over his waist, his face buried in his hair. Draco had a hand intertwined with Harry's in front of him.
"I know," Harry reached out and touched her arm. "I know. You're doing great. I think—"
The elation of Harry's news was quickly dampened as Draco quietly told him the events of the previous days at Wolf's Hollow.
Draco folds his arms over his chest. "They look at you like you're dessert and they're starving."

She gasped.
Being assigned to guard Harry Potter had felt like an honor at first, after watching them subdue him as his magic shook the entire island, terrifying guards and prisoners alike. But then Curly had been forced to watch as he was given dose after dose of Wolfsbane. As he clutched his head and begged for his fiancé. And then the hallucinations set in, and Potter began imagining Malfoy was there, and that was worse, somehow.
“Do you want to stay in one of the guest bedrooms tonight? Teddy will be back after breakfast, so you can see him before you go?”
Harry laughs and kisses him again. “Trust me, I know.”
"Well,
The old clock in the hall chimed five o'clock and Harry's entire body tensed.
She slapped a hand to her forehead. "Oh,

"Good night, Harry," he says softly into the dark, closing the door.
Ron accepted this stoically, even though he was boiling up inside. Why was it always

“You’ll be okay,” Harry tells him, yawning around the words. “You’ll find someone else. Someone better.”

“You must think I’m so

The moment the door clicked shut, Harry leaned over and kissed Draco gently, pulling away just enough for their lips to brush as he spoke. "I'm so sorry, you must be exhausted."
Draco laughed, setting a hand on Harry's thigh. "
He held tightly to Rose as they Flooed to Ron and Hermione's house, leaning heavily against the mantle as soon as he stepped through and fighting down a wave of nausea. He passed the little girl back over to her mother and closed his eyes.

The other man walked further into the room and stood much too close to him, his chest pressed against Harry's back, his breath hot against his neck.
Harry's brow creased. "Yeah, I don't know why that is, but I feel much better."
“No,” Draco answers without lifting his head. “It’s okay. He was being an arse. He only said that because he knew it would upset you.”
Harry felt his stomach clench painfully, even as desire flooded through him. He stilled, then pulled away, and Draco groaned in frustration. "Not again! What the hell is wrong

“Yes,” Draco agrees, stealing a quick kiss right there on the Platform before they Apparate.

Upstairs, the potential interruption goes completely unnoticed by the two boys, lost in each other as they were.
"I'm sorry to have bothered you," Potter answered softly, and Draco heard the front door open. "I hope things get better soon."
"Do you want to go put your bag in your room?" Draco asks Teddy, who is clinging to Potter's other hand. "It's the guest bedroom where you used to stay before when you visited, but I put a few new things in there for you."
Draco gave his mother a sharp look as she surreptitiously glanced at her watch for the fourth time in the past half hour. They'd spent a pleasant evening eating out and then shopping together on Diagon Alley, but his mother had been acting odd since they left the last shop and started discussing where to go next.
One person, however, doesn’t seem to have been intimidated by Draco’s scowl. The man stops at the end of the small two-person table and asks, “Can I sit?”
He grabbed one off the tray and tossed it to Ron, who caught it with a small smile. "Thanks." He immediately unwrapped it and shoved the whole thing in his mouth.
"Of course not!" Pansy grinned.
“Well…”
"Hey. What's going on? Are you okay?"
After a long moment, Draco asks, "Bed?"
"Oh. I, um, I had no idea." He looked at Pansy for a few more seconds, then narrowed his eyes. "What were

"I surprised you with it," Harry smiles at the memory, "Got it during my lunch hour and came home with it after Auror training..."
“I thought you were going to…”
"That's what I said."
“What?”
“I’m afraid we have another engagement this evening,” he says smoothly, and Dudley’s eyes land on him for the first time, widening in surprise. “Draco Malfoy,” Draco stands and reaches out to offer his hand to shake, fully aware that his smile doesn’t reach his eyes.

"Right, then. See you later."

Draco tightened his arms around him.
"Oh, yeah, it can be, but..." Harry trailed off at the look on Draco's face. "What?"
He nodded and she made her way out the front door, greeting Draco as they passed on the front step with a breezy, "hello Draco, I'm off to work!"
"Have you seen yourself tonight?" Harry drops him on the bed, watching as Draco flops onto his back on the mattress, immediately spreading his legs wide. "I wanted to strip these robes off you the second you walked in the door."
Ginny blanches when she spots me standing a little ways off, and Harry follows her shocked gaze.
Harry found Pansy out on the dance floor with Draco. "Mind if I cut in?"

"I'm not sure I trust Davis on that. He's been trying to win Potter over for a year now with no success. It seems unlikely that would change now. Besides, Auror Potter hardly seems like the type who would get involved with a subordinate—"
He brought a hand up to rest on Harry's chest, and Harry covered it with his own, interlacing their fingers.

Draco smiles at the sound of his mother’s laughter, then forces his face back into a scowl.

“Teddy, we...Harry and I, we decided a long time ago that that wasn’t an option for us.”
“Okay.” Marc looks satisfied.
George huffs out a disbelieving laugh as he sits beside him. “I doubt that.”
Harry came barreling down the stairs, his face splitting into a huge grin. "Draco! You're home early!"
"We sort of already live together," Harry laughs, looking around at the room they've shared for over a month.
Violet asks.
“BUT YOU
Harry stops halfway to the door that leads to the foyer and upstairs, and turns around.
Harry smiles and touches his arm. “Alright, alright. No more secret teas with your Mum. We’ll invite you next time, I promise.”
Hermione met his gaze and nodded. She was doing a much better job of keeping it together than he was.
"Why not?"
Draco filled another plate of food for himself, avoiding the burnt toast entirely, and made his way back to their bed, where they ate in companionable silence.
"I suppose you might be right."
"Hello Harry! How is Teddy?"
"Really?" She sniffled. "You're not going to make me leave?"
"Probably should," Draco yawned. "I feel gross. I hate Portkey stations."
“Everyone’s been saying that,” Draco sniffs. “But it feels like it was.”

Hermione glanced at the ceiling. "How is he?"
"You're
"Draco..." Hermione shook her head.
And Salazar, I didn't think my heart could break any more than it already has, but I swear I can feel it crack and shatter like glass all over again when Harry lets me see that heartache.
"Comfortable?" Harry asked, cuddling up against his husband and draping an arm over his waist.
•••••
Harry sighed, turning and leaning against a nearby bookshelf pensively, looking around at the beautiful room.
“It doesn’t matter,” Draco shakes his head. “I um, I’ve been seeing someone else. Well, we’ve only been writing for the past few weeks, but I want to see where it goes, and I’m going to really try this time. I can’t....it’s time for me to...to move on, I think. To try, at least.”
“Yes, Mum.”
"It is. It's beautiful."
Potter, no
Taking stock of his senses, Draco's nose is still stuffy, and his head feels...like it might explode. He whines softly, then winces apologetically when Harry stirs.
She shot him a knowing look.
"Why don't you just talk to him, Harry?" Hermione is the voice of reason, as always. "You can fix this."
"Hmm. I imagine that's where the challenge will be, then. For a Challenge for Dominance, which has only been an option in recent years since the Wolfsbane Potion was invented, the wolves take Wolfsbane so that they're more aware of their surroundings and the violent tendencies are curbed significantly. They still fight, but only until one of the wolves submits to the other. Werewolves have still succumbed to their injuries and died during this kind of challenge, but it's less likely."
"I know. Get dressed so we can call Jenkins and ask for some breakfast. Do you want to come to Wolf's Hollow with me today?"
"Just a moment, Christine!" Harry answered, recognizing their friend's voice.
* * *
Harry grabbed his suitcases and headed for the stairs, with Draco trailing sleepily behind.
Harry shook his head against Draco's chest. "Not even a little. I just wanted to get away as quickly as possible."
Harry chuckled softly. "We have a few minutes before I need to get up," he whispered, giving his forehead another kiss.
, Draco."
“Yes,” he awkwardly avoids her eyes. “I was wondering if we could...I wanted to, erm, talk…about Harry.”
“Have I mentioned,” Draco gasps when he feels his orgasm rising. “How glad I am that you’re okay?”
The entire room began to vibrate precariously, and the two men gave up any pretense of bravery and bolted down the stairs.
“It’s not something that, you know, happened with any sort of
She cocked her head. "Why?"
As if she’d magically summoned him by saying his name, he’s suddenly here, standing just a short distance away on the dance floor, his expression shuttered as he watches us.

Draco settled in, pressing one last kiss to Harry's shoulder, and soon they were both fast asleep.
My stomach lurches almost painfully at the sound of
"Stop." Draco cupped Harry's face in his hands. "McDougal would have done what he did no matter how you responded when he came to Grimmauld Place.
He was so excited to see him, and to be able to touch him, that part of him was itching to burst into the bathroom and just hold him again, bury his face in the fresh, familiar scents of Draco's bath products and taste them on his skin...
Harry still kisses like there’s nothing else in the world, nothing else that matters except the way his mouth moves against Draco’s, the hot slide of their tongues as they kiss with abandon, both grateful to finally be allowed—hands clutching at hair and running over clothing. Harry presses Draco up against the front door, sliding his hands up the front of his pyjama top to run over his waist, over his stomach, and Draco pulls away, panting.
Draco can’t help laughing as he and Harry turn back to look at each other. “Oops,” he drawls, feeling himself flush in embarrassment.
"He's on Wolfsbane?"
“Are you sure?” Harry asks.
" Harry cuts him off. "I'm not...I'm not good at that, and I don't even know when people are coming onto me half the time, and I'm pretty sure people are just being nice when you think they're flirting, so if I say something then
He reaches for me, touches my face. I should knock his hand away, but I don’t. I want him so badly, even now, even after everything, and that gentle touch is like finding an oasis after two years in the desert and I can’t, I won’t, deny myself that, even if it’s all that I’ll ever get from him.
Draco jumps when the door to the back of the shop opens, a belated knock letting him know Harry has arrived.
Lorcan shot him a nasty look and left the room.
Draco’s heart is pounding as he listens to Harry confirm that he will
The Healer turned to Draco. "Follow me, Mr. Malfoy."
"Harry!"
The scene feels so picturesque, Draco can barely believe it’s real. He’s on a third date with one Harry James Potter, and, truth be told, he’s having an incredible time. Harry’s gloved hand is in his, and he’s laughing, his eyes sparkling behind his glasses.
Draco surprises them both by leaning forward and kissing Harry on the cheek. Not a friendly peck like he’d intended—a soft, lingering kiss that makes his feelings abundantly clear.
"Don't," Draco accepts the offering, taking a huge gulp. "I don't do that."
Nadine was also single, but she was older, and her expression was merely grateful when she looked at Harry. No fierce hunger, there.
Draco smiled.
," he says, looking puzzled.
"I'd better head inside, then. I'll let everyone know that I'm leaving, and then I need to talk to Kasper about a few things before I go. We've only got a couple of hours left until the moon rises."
"You haven't? Not even with...?"
“Everything?”
Draco sets his resolve to forget the whole incident and return their friendship to the way it had been before. He misses Harry, and the way things had been between them before, too. He can fix this, he knows he can.
Harry kisses him, then, and Draco feels like he's been dead these past few months and he's just now being brought back to life as warmth and relief and joy flood through him in equal measure. They both pour themselves into each press of warm lips, the passion that has always existed between them in various forms igniting within them both.
“And these are your…” Lottie glances at Draco, her brow furrowed, “...
Teddy begs him to stay, eyes welling up with huge tears, and Draco can feel his face get hot, whether from embarrassment or anger he isn’t sure. Probably both.
"I always come here first," he murmurs, squeezing Draco's hand. "And I know I've shown you before, but I always bring this and sit down and look at it for a bit." He pulls the photo album out of his pocket and it grows back to its original size in his hand. The photo album is familiar—a gift from Hagrid when he was eleven, and one of Harry's most prized possessions.
“Nothing,” Draco shakes his head, still smiling. “I was just thinking...it's all turned out really well, hasn’t it? You and me and...everything? Better than I ever could have imagined. And it’s still going well, you know? And that’s incredible.”
And now Teddy knows that
"Already have that one?"
"Of course," Draco smiles, "I was happy to help."
He'd also been forced to come to terms with the reality that the more time he spent with Harry, the more attracted to him he was. He'd acknowledged his physical attraction early on; objectively, Harry was a fit, handsome man, and trying to deny it would be futile. Accepting his attraction to his personality, however, had been a little more difficult.
“It’s alright.” Harry shrugs and smiles, touching Draco’s arm in a friendly greeting before going upstairs. “I don’t mind.”
“Yeah, in my office, but what’s—?“
“Why didn’t you just tell me all of that
“What’re you doing?”
Draco could definitely get used to this.
Draco is rudely awoken by pounding at his door.
Harry passes the entrance exams for St. Mungo’s Healer Program. They celebrate at the Burrow, the only place big enough for the entirety of the Weasley family to gather, and the place where all the best parties happen, Draco has learned. His heart isn’t really in it this time though, and, despite the smile plastered on his face as Draco watches him from a distance, Harry’s doesn’t seem to be, either.
of someone Apparating to the front step cut her off, and she stopped speaking and gave his arm a squeeze. "Just think about it."
As much as Draco had suspected them of doing this, he’s still slightly shocked that he's actually caught them out.
" Harry's lips brushed against Draco's neck as he whispered, "I'm not sure I ever could."
"We could leave, you know, you don't have to fight him."
"Come listen to the match with us?"
Hermione cast a subtle Tracking Charm at his back as he left, whistling cheerfully as he went, just in case.
"I..." I don't know how to respond. Words still don't seem adequate.
Harry watched his friends anxiously, his gaze flitting between them.
"I keep thinking about that move you did, and that look on your face when you caught the Snitch, and fuck, Draco, you're just so fucking
Draco stopped reading and set the newspaper aside. "Well, that actually wasn't too bad. And a terrifying threat, indeed."
Harry wrung his hands nervously as the couple continued to communicate wordlessly.
Harry blushes and tugs at his hand, but Draco just holds on tighter.
“Er, Narcissa, I don’t think Draco wants to talk about this anymore,” Harry cuts her off.
One letter turned the fire purple and made it spark dangerously. Harry didn't react. Why should it surprise him that someone had tried to send a hex through the mail? Of
"Ah, now it all makes sense. Congratulations." Mathias stuck out his hand, and Harry shook it. "Friends?"
Harry was still lying on the floor on his side. He lifted his head to look at Draco and let out a little whimper.
“Me too,” Harry says, and he pulls him back in.
Harry sighs and runs a tired hand over his face. "No, Davis. I appreciate the offer, but I have a lot to do."

They say goodbye to their friends, and then Harry turns back to Draco. “Let’s go home?”
Do you know how inappropriate it would be for me to get involved with one of my subordinates? And you
"Why are you here, Draco?"
"My best friend is Muggleborn and I'm in love with Harry-bloody-Potter, who is now a werewolf, and I don't care in the slightest. Seeing Voldemort's demented mind up close during the war showed me just how wrong all of those Pureblood ideals I was raised to believe are. I've rejected them, and I'm a much better person for it. So yes, Mother, I've changed." He finished vehemently.
A few minutes later, with a steaming cup of tea cradled in his hands, he found himself spilling the whole story to Potter, who listened intently, nodding along but never interrupting until Draco was finished.
•••••
Weasley gave Draco a tight-lipped smile. "I'll get Hermione and Thomas and bring them here. Give us an update in the waiting area when you get a minute, will you?"
"Harry Potter, you're under arrest for the murder of Lorcan Yates. After questioning, you'll be taken to Azkaban until a trial date can be set."
Afterward, Harry cast a Cleaning Charm and held him close, running his hands over his body. He could scarcely believe Draco was really home, that the whole ordeal is over. So many things could have gone wrong, could have taken Draco from him—
He held his fiancé and kissed his hair, stroking his dirt-streaked face and holding his icy hands, occasionally pressing his fingers to his lips as he murmured on repeat. "I'm here, darling, I'm really here."
Draco inclines his head in agreement. “Silencing Charm?”
After Harry closes the door behind himself, Draco sags back in his seat. He covers his face with his hands, letting the cold façade fall away.
"Oh?" Draco chuckled softly. "Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that you used to listen to every Quidditch match together and now you spend half of them having sex with me on your sofa instead."

He pauses. "D'you... Is it okay? I know I look different from before—"
. He flexed his fingers first and examined his hands and shiny, overly-healthy-looking nails. He sat up and rolled his shoulders experimentally, then stretched his arms over his head. When he brought them back down, he stared at the skin on his arms and ran a finger over the skin. The light blond hair along his arms was gone, they were completely, weirdly, smooth, and the scar on his arm from his skirmish with the hippogriff in Third Year had vanished completely. Swallowing hard, he tugged his pyjama shirt over his head, gasping softly when he saw that the Sectumsempra scars that had slashed across his chest were gone, too.
Something about the way he says it feels...off. I stare at him for a second before asking, “D’you…is it okay? I know I look different from before—“
You can't be serious," Potter says incredulously, standing up and going red in the face, his famous temper flaring immediately. "I'm his godfather!"
“I—I shouldn’t be here. I’m sorry.” Eyes shining, he turns and leaves, pushing his way through the crowd.

Harry’s eyes are closed, and Draco can feel his breaths slowing under his head. The movement is soothing, and it’s nice, lying together like this, and soon he can feel himself drifting off to sleep, too.

Harry grimaces. “Probably. I still have to pass the entrance exams, though. I’m not sure that I can…”
"I will." Christine went outside to Apparate from the porch, and then she was gone.
Draco indicates toward the full plate, and Harry shoots him a grateful smile. "You're the best."
“I’m sorry.” Draco blurts. “For every awful thing I ever said about your parents being gone, for all the times that I—”
Harry groans and lifts his hands up beside his head. He watches through half-lidded eyes as Draco stretches himself until he knows he’s ready, and then he finally conjures more lube to spread over Harry’s cock.
“You,” Harry says solemnly, the serious expression on his face belied by the teasing glint in his eyes.
“I’ll look forward to it. Thank you, Harry.”
“Play with my hair,” Harry demands, “and I’ll never mock him again.”
"What do you want to do now?"
Draco goes to lunch with Paul for the second time the following Friday, determined to let the other man down gently.
"Draco!"
Harry's breath hitches at the new pet name, and Draco lets his fingers trail lower, into the dark hair on Harry's belly, before slipping a finger into the waistband of his boxers and tugging lightly. "May I?"
that he is (Ron’s words, although Draco wholeheartedly agrees with the sentiment), instinctively jumped in front of the idiot and took the Curse himself. It sliced him open, right through his side. At this point, Draco notices the amount of blood on Ron’s crimson robes and visibly cringes.
Harry reaches out and takes Draco's wrist in his hand, gazing at the faded Mark that remains.
“No!” Ginny responds over her shoulder with a grin.
“I guess I should be going,” Harry says softly.
Harry opens one eye to peer at him. “I suppose so. I don’t think we need to make some big announcement or anything, we can just tell people as we see them, right?”
too good in those dress robes," Draco fired back.
An anti-Apparition Ward prevented their quickest method of escape, so they ran for the front door, where fifty more were waiting outside.
“Harry was in the first bedroom on the left when you go upstairs, Lot,” a deep voice said from the doorway. “The one we’ve converted into my office.”
Blaise Zabini's fucking ostentatious watch in the stands.

Draco held out a hand, palm up, for him to sniff. He did, and with a satisfied yip he hopped up onto the bed with another pained whimper, and promptly curled up in Draco's lap.
"I should have known
•••••
A different kind of ache fills his chest as he contemplates the miracle that is the Weasley Family, who have adopted him as one of their own in the past few years, (he even has two wonderfully cozy Christmas sweaters to prove it). It feels a bit like gratitude—the kind of warm, grounding feeling that comes from family and belonging—and he’s filled with the sense that maybe, just maybe, no matter what happens with Harry, everything will be okay.
Somehow, he’s managed to fuck things up with both Harry and Brandon in one morning, and he hates that it’s Harry’s disappointed expression, quickly shuttered but impossible to miss, that keeps flickering into his mind and making his stomach roil with guilt. On impulse, Draco gets up and writes a quick note:
When they made the plans a month earlier, it had seemed easy enough. They were all getting on well, and Teddy hated the idea of spending Christmas with only one half of his family. But now, with his newfound feelings for Harry at the forefront of his mind every time they came into contact with one another, Draco is starting to wonder if he’s made a mistake. But there’s no turning back now.
There was a plate of food by the door, and he sniffed it apprehensively. No Wolfsbane. That's what had changed, he realized. The guard in charge of fetching his food from the kitchen hadn't added any Wolfsbane for the past two meals.
Harry trailed loving fingers over his cheek. "Anything for you."
The guy openly leers at me, and instead of feeling encouraged, the desire to go home intensifies. I have no idea what to say, or how to even go about this. I know what Ginny is trying to do, and I appreciate the thought, but…I just can’t. I turn to tell her to give me my shirt back and her glare returns.
Another nod.
Harry sat down beside him and gently rubbed his shoulder. "Drake?"
"Yesterday. Hermione finally told me. I just thought he'd decided he didn't want me, but really he was trying to protect me in his own twisted way. I didn't know."
Draco made his way upstairs, his heart hammering in his chest. A hidden staircase, a rooftop terrace, his mother's unusual behavior...there was only one explanation that made sense.
Dudley and Lottie visibly relax.
"Stop,
Draco's stomach clenched painfully. He forced a light tone into his voice. "That was what, just over two months ago?"
"I did." Harry blushes too, and looks away.
Draco puts a hand on Hermione's arm. "Let me go. This is my fault. I shouldn't have called Antonio that."
“You’ve never liked that,” Draco realizes as he says it, “you don’t like being famous, and you
Not when things have ended so horribly with David, and the Daily Prophet keeps plastering the front page with photos of Harry everywhere with his current beau—a strikingly handsome professional Quidditch player named Derek—including a rather racy paparazzi photo of them stumbling out of Wizarding pub last week; kissing open-mouthed, their hands wandering.
As he pulls on some clothes and makes his way downstairs, Draco can already feel himself regretting saying yes. But Brandon
"Dunno," Dean shrugs. "Maybe an hour?"
"Will you marry me?"
"So I've just discovered," Draco laughed lightly. "But not to worry, darling. I'm yours, for as long as you'll have me."
Harry laughed as Draco dragged him to the Floo. "Bye, everyone!"
dramatic sigh.
He nods, looking at me with so much hope and longing I feel like I might drown in it. I feel another rush of guilt. If I’d just given him a chance to explain, if I’d read his letters instead of letting my anger and pride get the best of me....
Harry grinned. "You're the best. Thanks Andy."
"Okay, it's been a couple months. But that's not the problem. I'm just not...
“Pick up where we left off earlier? Fuck me so hard I forget my own name?”
"Oh, you know," Draco brushed Harry's hair off of his forehead and stroked his cheek. "Pretty much all of it."
"And he
He snatched Harry's wand and cast a quick Auguamenti Charm, dousing the flames and drenching the already-ruined newspaper.
Harry turned his head. "Nadine."
"And you'd better not be doing any lewd naked dances for anyone but
And then he’s gone, Victoire trailing after him after kissing her parents goodbye. Draco catches the look she gives Teddy when he’s not looking at her, and he grins. He has a feeling she and Teddy are going to be just fine.
"Why are you being nice to me? You haven't said a word to me all year."
"Oh, come and stir my cauldron, and if you do it right, I'll boil you up some hot, strong love, to keep you warm tonight!"
A wide, effusive smile split her face. "Of course, darling. Now, I imagine you're quite anxious to see Harry in the wake of this morning's Prophet?"
"Told me he still hates me and that I'll never be good enough for you," Draco finished for her with a scowl.
." Draco rolled off of Harry, looking slightly dazed. He trailed a hand over Harry's shoulder and down his arm. "You're so good, darling."
"I can't—I can't do this. I'm so sorry. You should go. Please just go."
“I love you, too,” my voice cracks, my own eyes threatening to overflow.
The others are gathering around them as Draco takes Harry’s wrist and carefully heals the broken bones.
Draco tried and failed to suppress the violently pleasurable shiver that ran through him. "You absolutely—Merlin, I don't even know what to do with you," he laughed, brushing a hand through Harry's hair.
"Happy Anniversary. I love you."
, I was going to propose on Christmas."
Hermione nodded, and he pulled out his wand.
Harry smiles and shakes his head. "You really

Harry bit his lower lip nervously. "I suppose we could try it. I, er, I I haven't been with anyone else, either. Not since before that first night together."
The awkwardness dissipates as the three of them divide up the food and sit down with their plates.
Harry swallows. “I don’t think I can promise you that, Draco.”
“I came back to make sure you’re okay,” Teddy walks over and wraps his arms around Harry's waist, hugging him tightly and burying his face against his shoulder. He’s already at Harry’s height, and likely to surpass him within the next year. “I know you’ve tried to keep everything you went through from me, especially your childhood, but I know more than you think. I love you, Dad.”
Other faces appeared in the doorway. Mia-Rose looked terrified, her eyes trained on one of the twins. Grace's eyes were narrowed dangerously. Two unfamiliar women looked on nervously, one holding a small boy in striped blue pajamas.
"Okay, Harry!" The little boy took off running.
"Mhm," Draco agreed, tipping his head back and then slowly moving up onto his knees and sinking back down.
"Only by you, my love," Harry murmured affectionately, running his fingers through Draco's silky blond hair before leaning down to kiss him again.
"People won't like the idea of that many werewolves gathered together in one place."
Harry pulled him into a sweet, lingering kiss. "Yes, you do," he said, when they finally parted.
Draco vaguely recalls that rumor going around, through the haze of depression and horror that was Sixth Year. “So it’s…”
"Are you?" Harry asked, playing along. "

“I like the way you think,” Draco grins back and kisses him softly, grabbing his wand and casting a Tempus Charm to wake them on time, before settling in and closing his eyes. Harry throws an arm over his waist and kisses his shoulder again.

One year, Harry came home blind drunk, extremely lucky he hadn't Splinched himself Apparating home to their flat. Draco had helped him to bed, Accioed a Hangover Potion to leave on the bedside table, and eaten a late dinner alone.
Draco grinned at him. "I'm considerate like that."
"You can't blame yourself for this," Draco said forcefully, watching as Harry's eyes filled with the tears and guilt Draco had known were coming. "You were in
Draco kisses his forehead and cards a hand through his damp hair. “Want to talk about it?”
He followed Harry through their bedroom, where Harry carefully set aside his suitcases, and into the bathroom, where Harry turned on the water to get it nice and hot.

The black wolf growled low in his throat, snapping his jaws as he circled the other wolf, who responded in kind.
Ron laughed and walked over to kiss his wife and then his giggling baby's forehead while Draco stared at him, completely bewildered by the exchange.
He wasn't the first adversary the black wolf had faced to try, and he would be damned if he went down without a fight.
“This is nice,” Draco murmurs as he drapes an arm over Harry’s chest and buries his face against his shoulder.
be able to walk again, but it may cause him a fair bit of pain for, erm, the rest of his life."
They ran into the house and down the stairs to find another bloody scene. Sofia was lying at the bottom of the stairs, bleeding from a cut on her arm and a dark bruise blooming on the side of her head.
•••••
Draco leaned over for a kiss. "Isn't it, though?"
“That’s great. This is my friend, Draco.” Harry’s smile was still forced, but Lottie didn’t seem to notice as she reached out to shake Draco’s hand. They heard Violet’s high-pitched voice and footsteps coming down the stairs.
Ginny groans and puts her face in her hands. "I give up."
Harry gave her arm a reassuring squeeze, then let go. "We can talk more later, okay? I'll tell you everything I know."
“Of course!” Harry glances over his shoulder, shrugging apologetically at someone out of Draco’s line of sight before turning back to look at him. “Give me fifteen minutes and I’ll come through.”

"Well, you should have asked before that then," Draco teased.
"I won't be thinking about you at all."

He hadn't expected her to forgive him at all, and yet,
Draco nodded. "I'm a decent hand at them, but this...we need to get him to St. Mungo's. I'm not sure he's safe to Apparate right now, though. It would be risky."
Thomas was in her arms. Harry guessed he was around five years old—close to Teddy's age. The boy shared many of his mother's features. He had her hazel eyes, straight nose, and pale, freckled skin. But his hair was light brown, falling in adorable shiny ringlets around his head and over his ears.
“Is now,” Harry grins. “I’m a genius. Congratulate me.”
"Oh, er, you're welcome. It seemed like you were having a hard time."
Hermione's eyes were wide, her expression reverent as she took the books from him. "Oh,
"Not long." Harry walked over, pressing himself firmly against his back as he stood up again, and Draco wrapped an arm up over Harry's neck and turned his head to kiss him softly. "Are you finished?" Harry asked in his ear, voice low.
“For both of you, I imagine,” Harry answers. “It’s her eleventh birthday?”
Harry Apparated to Wolf's Hollow an hour later than he'd told Kasper he'd be there, but he couldn't bring himself to feel guilty about spending the extra time with Draco. It had been nothing short of spectacular.
"Into your pants, yes."

"About what will happen if I don't win...about what will happen to the pack, especially to Nadine and Thomas...and things can't continue like this, not allowing magical beings to use wands and learn magic? It's barbaric. They deserve a choice. I want to change things, make them better for everyone..."

Draco introduces Harry to Marc at a party at the Burrow, and if he notices the passing resemblance to himself in the brunet’s dark mane and light hazel eyes, Harry is kind enough not to mention it.
“Only Andromeda,” Harry laughs. “But she was right.”
"It was."

"Fine," Teddy sulks, but he trudges in the house and slams the front door.
"No magic."
“See you Sunday, then?”
"You're irresistible when you cook, you know that," Draco murmured, kissing him softly and slowly.
"Thank you," Harry smiles and leans against his shoulder. "This is nice. Having you here with me."
Afterward, Draco can't seem to stop touching Harry, hands running over every inch of bare skin. Harry sighs contentedly, stretching out like a cat, then curling up as he turns onto his side to look at him, eyes serious.
"STOP!"
"WEASLEY!"
“I know,” he smirks, and Harry summons enough energy to lean over and kiss him before dropping his head back onto the pillow and closing his eyes again.
to get over Malfoy. No better way to do it.”
Narcissa stiffened for a moment when he stepped forward and threw his arms around her, burying his face in her neck—Draco hadn't hugged her like that since he was a small child. But she quickly relaxed and wrapped her arms around him too, one hand stroking up and down his back in the soothing motion she had used to calm him when he was young.
"I can't believe they were sleeping together for
my boyfriend just came home looking like he'd come face-to-face with a hundred Dementors, Weasley."
“Lonely,” George slants a knowing look over at him. “Sad. I’ve seen him smile more in the past two weeks than in the past year.”
, but that's never really been Harry's way, and Draco can understand why saying the words out loud had been so hard for him. He has his own hard days after all, his own history that he struggles to talk about.
•••••
He'd climbed into bed beside him, and Draco had curled up against his side. "That's not how grief works, sweetheart."
"You wish," Harry whispered back, eyes shining as he did the same, sliding Draco's ring on with shaking hands.
It had all felt completely surreal.
Harry lays his head in his lap, and Draco's fingers immediately come up to card through his dark curls.
He got up, grabbed a fresh pair of boxers, and tugged them on as he made his way into the kitchen.
Upstairs, Harry lay in bed, arms folded behind his head, listening to every word, his head cocked to one side like a perplexed puppy.
"Hm?"
“Like
"Unimaginably," Harry murmured against his chest. "I've never felt anything like it."

When the Healer returned, Harry was sitting up, having taken his potion, with Draco's head in his lap.

... He shook his head, disconcerted by the dark turn their conversation had taken.
"I cannot
“No,” Paul shrugs and picks up his fork, going back to his pasta. “We can still have dinner together on weeknights, it’s not a problem.”
Harry shook his head. "No, go—I'm just going to sleep this afternoon," he swallowed the dose of Anti-Nausea and pulled a face at the strong ginger flavor, "prepare for tonight, you know? Go see Hermione and Rosie and give them both a kiss for me, okay?"
My voice finally returns to me, coming out raspy and strange even to my own ears. "I— I shouldn't be here. I'm sorry."
“Sure, he isn’t.”
"That's
Harry shakes his head subtly, not to disagree, but to silently plead with Draco not to say anything. It’s infuriatingly clear that Lottie has no idea how he was treated. She’s been imagining him and Dudley growing up as brothers with equally happy childhoods. Draco wants to smash that image to smithereens, but the fearful, pleading look in Harry’s eyes prevents him.
"We talked about this!"
"Mum!"
Several hours later, the two teams meet on the Quidditch pitch to the roar of their usual crowd.
A slow smile etches itself across Draco's lips. He
Harry smiled sadly at him. "I've been reading up on this, remember? I know exactly what I'm doing."
* * *
some of the anger I know I should be feeling towards him surfaces.
“Point,” I concede, and suddenly I can’t keep the smile off of my face. I’m going to kiss him again.
He choked out, and Harry looked startled at the emotion in his voice.
"No."
Ron sneered. "You can't blame an entire species for the actions of a few. They're not all like that.
,” I groan.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to—”
He averted his eyes and grabbed his wand off of the bedside table.
"Any word from your uncle?" Draco asked, mercifully changing the subject.
After eating lunch together, Harry walked Hermione to the entryway to see her off. He was finally feeling steadier on his feet, the aching in his bones a dull but manageable reminder of his recent transformation.
"Yes, please."
More proof that he was the favorite, and he was being inordinately smug about it, Draco thought.
It was so bloody unfair, and Draco wanted to scream, but instead he just leaned over to kiss him again. Harry was alive, that was the most important thing. Outrage over the mistreatment of werewolves could wait.
"Nadine has some nasty bites on her, too. We'd better take them
Draco and Harry had been poring over the books that they had collected regarding his new species, but the information regarding werewolf packs was frustratingly limited.
"M'sorry."
"I didn't. I was in the library, but I was sad that I missed it when I heard all about it from everybody else. Anyway, what else? You're secretly kind, you're determined, you're—"
"It was not sanctioned by the French Minister for Magic, and it was quickly repealed by the country's Ministry, but the damage had been done. The careful peace we had sought for over a hundred years was broken, and we were hunted. This is the last of our pack. Last year we were over a hundred strong, now cut down to less than twenty."
Draco rolled over and gaped at him. "Didn't we already...? I mean, last night..."
The tingling sensation that accompanies Cleaning Charms washes over him, and Draco shivers. Harry pulls him into his arms and tugs the covers back up over them both.
, but...Hermione, I can't do this. They have no idea how long it will take, and I've lost so many people already," his breath had caught, and he'd had to force himself to keep talking. "These people are

Draco shook his head. "Harry,
"Yes,
“Your potion saved my life that day, you know,” Harry says softly. “The Healer told me.
His potions knowledge is almost as attractive as his physical features, and Draco has to focus hard to be able to answer his questions because as he steps closer the smell of his cologne hits him and his mind goes completely blank for a moment. Draco forces himself to focus and answer his questions as best he can, torn between longing to get back to his potion and wanting to stay in the presence of this handsome man as long as he can.
"Harry, you're perfect. They're beautiful." I run my hands over his chest. "I'm just sad I missed you coming home with each new one. Do you remember when..."
"Hi sweetie!" Healer Gordon hugged her daughter, and turned her to face Harry and Draco.
A small smile creeps onto Harry's face, and he tilts his head to one side. "Point."
His eyes widened in surprise, but then he smiled kindly. "Of course, Healer Gordon. I'd be happy to meet your daughter."
"What?"
“Yes?”
The handful of Aurors still on their feet watched in shocked silence as Harry holstered his wand and bolted forward, bodily throwing himself at the other man, his arms wrapping around his shoulders. Draco caught him, his arms coming up to encircle his waist.
“One of the other children was bullying one of Edward’s friends. Edward used his metamorphagus abilities to create a rather upsetting caricature of the other child’s features, emphasizing her, erm, rather large ears. And giving himself an elephant trunk.”
Draco gave him a faint smile. "No one will recognize you looking like that, just make sure it stays on."
!" Harry shouted, and the other Aurors followed his lead and attacked. Malfoy blocked the spell with ease, and Harry advanced on him, calling out, "Malfoy is mine!"

"What do you mean?"
be good enough for him."
His Auror senses were tingling, and as he neared the office he shared with McDougal, he felt the telltale magical hum of a Silencing Charm being used inside. That was unusual. Ron hesitated with his hand stretched toward the door handle for a brief moment before coming to a quick decision.
"That's fantastic!" Harry beamed. "You must be exhausted though. Do you want to take a nap?"
time?” He raises his eyebrows.
“Right,” Harry answers equally awkwardly. “Of course. Thank you, Healer Franklin.’
it looks better in here."
Sliding out of his pyjama bottoms and pants, he discovered that the lack of body hair didn't just apply to his arms; his entire body, never very hairy to begin with, was now completely smooth. That would take some getting used to, but overall, Draco found he didn't much mind.
Harry picks up his bag, and Draco stands too, walking with him to the door to his room.
"Go on," Draco laughed, "go get the door. I can watch the bacon for a minute."
“Not tonight, Molly,” Harry says gently, and her face falls. “I really just want to go home.”
Draco winced internally, waiting for Weasley to mock him, but Ron just nodded sagely.

"You will
“Diamonds,” Draco gasps a little while later, when Harry fucks him for the second time that morning, groaning as Harry hooks a hand under his knee and lifts his leg higher, thrusting deeper. “Ohhh yes,” Draco pants, “
Narcissa slowly turned around, tears already pouring silently down her cheeks.
"I've never met another one before." Marie gave Harry a shy smile. "
"What did he say in the note?"

All of this is familiar in the best sort of way; we’ve done this hundreds of times, we
looking forward to seeing that arse in Quidditch leather again." He winks to punctuate his uncharacteristically suggestive words, and Draco is stunned speechless.
“Ready?” Draco asks, reaching out with a gloved hand of his own and knocking on the door. Harry nods, eyes flickering with fear behind his glasses. Draco reaches out and gives his arm a squeeze. “It’ll be okay, Harry.”
It says something about the way the relationship dynamics have changed that Weasley doesn’t question this, just sits down beside Draco with a sigh of relief. He also doesn’t question the way Draco has to reach out and touch Harry while he talks, running his fingers through Harry’s hair and over his face, down the side of his arm, finally clutching at the fingers of his hand.
His mother's eyes danced as she laughed lightly again. "Of course I am."
“I focused on the right goal and then I threw it through the middle!”
his tongue is tracing the inside of my mouth and he's cupping my cheeks in his hands, and my fingers have found their way into his thick hair, cut shorter than he used to wear it, and he's tracing my cheekbones with his thumbs, and it's absolutely perfect and I never want him to stop.
"Late...? Oh. Shit! Sorry, Hermione."
She stepped to the side so that they could step into the large entryway, awkwardly shifting Harry so that they could squeeze past her.
Wondering who could possibly be knocking at this hour, he makes his way downstairs and opens the door to stare blankly at Harry, who hasn’t actually knocked on his front door in years.
Harry stops short at the sight of Charlotte and Violet Dursley, soaked through and each holding a suitcase.
, and I had to…”
"But—" he sneezes into his elbow three times in a row, cutting himself off.
"That
"Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these broken wings and learn to fly..."
"There better not be," Draco said darkly, and Harry laughed.
When he pulled back, Draco's eyes had a wicked glint in them. "So. Did those werewolf books say just how far you

“No way,” Teddy cuts in, joining the conversation. “You’re going to be in Hufflepuff like me, aren’t you?”
His mother smiled gently, reaching for his hand. "What went wrong, sweet dragon?"
Afterward, Harry curls toward him and brushes Draco’s hair out of his eyes. He looks sated and sleepy, his expression warm and adoring as their eyes meet. Draco doesn’t think he could ever get tired of seeing Harry like this.
"So, what's this about?" Draco asks. "I thought my aunt's Will was executed last week."
"No!" Harry cries, exasperated. "Because I
“That’s wonderful.”
"I think so," Kingsley said, as his eyelids fluttered shut and he collapsed.

Falling asleep again in this frigid weather would surely mean death. He was already starting to lose feeling in his hands.
Still nothing. She ran a finger down the page of the book to the last spell, reviewed the slight change in hand movement for this one. Practiced once, and then turned toward her husband again.
"No," Harry said quickly. "It's a long story, but Nadine is the only Alpha here. I'm afraid if you want to stay for longer than a few days, joining the pack is the only option. Are you prepared to do that?"
“It’s real,” Harry smiles at Draco as Teddy throws his arms around them both at the waist. Their fingers brush as they both go to put their hands on Teddy’s head. “And yes, and yes.”
Harry shot him a quelling look, and Draco raised a shoulder apologetically as Healer Gordon pursed her lips.
"I think you mean the famous Malfoy-Potter feud," Draco smirks, and Harry likes the sight of it. "Alphabetical and all, you know."
* * *
“Couple weeks ago. I don’t...I don’t really want to talk about it.”
Harry and I were just a fling and now it's over, it wasn't anything—"
“Great to meet you both,” Marc says, smiling politely. “I know all about you, of course, Harry. I went to Beauxbatons and was still in France during the war, but I heard all about what you did to protect the Wizarding World from He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.”
“I’ll see you at my place for dinner the night after tomorrow, though?” Paul pulls him close and kisses him chastely, brushing a thumb over his cheek.
, and he wanted to impress.
Draco woke up to bright sunlight shafting through the curtains and Harry breathing deeply beside him.
“Does it matter which house she’s in?” Dudley whispers nervously to Harry. “Is one better?”
After breakfast, Harry sat cross-legged on the hard floor and played with Thomas while Draco sat nearby, still observing quietly. The little boy had quite the collection of trains, and he exuberantly told Harry about each one, and Harry somehow managed to look excited the entire time, an impressive feat Draco knew he never could have accomplished.

"Bit weird for you to be cheering against your baby sister, Weasley, don't you think?"
"Carla," Harry shrugs. "Broke it off last week."
Harry glanced at Draco. "But..."
"Put me to work, Nadine."
Draco smiled and leaned over to kiss him. "Hi. Yeah, sorry."
"Are you sure, Harry?" She asked sweetly.
"No, you wouldn't, you like me better, right? What's Potter ever done for you, hmm?" Draco continued in that same silly voice. Louis cooed back and Draco smiled. "I give you treats."
"Mmhm," Draco smiled against his mouth, scooting closer on the sofa. "It's working beautifully."
Two weeks later, Draco is stocking the shelves in the Apothecary. His hand shakes, clinking a few of the bottles together, and he stops and forces himself to take a slow, deep breath. It’s Sunday morning, and the shop is closed, allowing him to work in solitude.

Draco took a deep breath and released it slowly. "It's alright. I'm just—I'm on edge. I'm going to go out for a bit."
A tall, portly man with steely blue eyes and a red face glared down at him.
"Stay away from there from now on," Robards said severely. "If Potter gets wind of this, there's no telling what he'll do. You know how powerful he is, it'll be a fucking bloodbath."
"Understandable. Well, if my Alpha emotion-reading is correct, I think he may be almost done. He's feeling excited, relieved, hungry, and exhausted. You should take him something to eat. And you may want to find time for a nap before your plans tonight. And...he misses you, too."
“Of course,” Draco smiles. “Once those two get over their shock, we’ll answer all of their questions.”
Harry and Draco took Teddy and their plates upstairs where they finished eating in Teddy's new room, and the two sisters didn't notice they were gone for a very long time.
Harry chews his lower lip, clearly at a loss. "It was just a disagreement, Ted." He glances at Ron. "Uncle Ron and I are still friends. There's nothing for you to worry about."
