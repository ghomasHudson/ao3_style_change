It seemed Harry survived the curse meant for him, how was anyone's guess but he had and with nothing but dried blood and a crushing scar admist his forehead 'He defeated the Dark Lord..' Severus could only gape at the little irate being before him, 'how did this child survive a organ rupture curse and rebound it? His father fell to it too easily downstairs, what the fuck is he..' after some deliberation Severus picked the boy up, unclasped his billowing cape and wrapped the screaming boy in it to keep him warm, all the while taking every inch of him in, he noted the boy look every inch her son with his fiery red hair and wings which now he thought of it 'Wasn't this boy black haired? It was only yesterday I saw this brat how the hell did he suddenly become a carbon copy of his mother in such a space of time? A potion? Unless he was a metermorph like little miss Tonks it didn't make sense, but we didn't see any signs except his high magical strength yesterday..' he mused, while watching the boy, determined to ignore the stench of the bodies in the room as if on instinct to stop him breaking down into insanity as he feared he would later on if he stayed there.
Meanwhile in Malfoy Manor, Draco had just layed Harry down in his bed and was just about to read his encyclopedia of Dark Creature types to get an idea of what Harry was, having no knowledge except for his Golden eyes that seemed to pierce through his soul at one glance, almost made him feel giddy being the centre of Harry's attention in a good way for once.
You could hear her screaming all the way down, it caused quite a steer despite Sirius being vaguely happy he had finally caught her for something 'that's one less evil to contend with, now I have to wait for that bastard Diggle to have final say on Harry's Adoption, I will hex him if he says it won't be done, Azkaban be damned!' He fumed silently in his head as he awaited the door to open again.
Most of these curses and spells are my inventions though a few are property of J.K Rowling's official spells.
"Nice one but the way mutt now the entire school knows of our conversation and excursion by default!" Snape sneered in outrage as he pushed the door open in front of them to glance in and see all eyes on the new arrivals.
Albus paled as soon as he saw it, opting to scan the article written by Rita Skeeter quickly, entitled Boy-Who-Dies?
Harry nodded with a raised brow "Fine I do not like having things chained to me and I can understand your predicament, I will still take you" he snapped his fingers and somehow released Osiris much to the blatant agitation of Griphook and the others.
Alone Albus smirked rather darkly as he played with the boy, who thought it rather funny to smack his long white wispy beard with his wings, the boy babbled and giggled softly with each whoosh of the beard, "Now then son, I see you have a love for magic, if my hypothesis was any indication earlier, how about I do some magic for you?" He enquired gently "Crepitaculum!" Conjuring a softly glowing baby rattle for the boy to nibble on, Harry laughed delightedly as he made a grab for the magical rattle, Intent on eating it.
Animosity Potion tied to Draco Malfoy, Tom Riddle and Severus Snape.
Malfoy
Alluring Aura (Broken)
Griphook just snorted disdainfully and sneered at all the pointing before signalling the guard to follow them through the room and through an intricately carved rosewood door directly to the right of the double doors, they couldn't drag him to the better chamber now that all the clientele knew and started to rush out of the bank to inform others, it wouldn't do to out their client more so than they had.
He stumbled and fell towards her crying silently in anguish, trying to embrace her and the probably dead child in her decaying grasp. "Fffuck no Lily, my sweet Lily, I tried to have you spared my love why! Why did he mean so much to you that you threw your life away for some vampires brat, you silly girl, why did this have to happen I loved you dearly, ever since I saw you showing that disgusting muggle sister of yours those pretty flowers you made just for us, why!" He half screamed in shaking in anguish as he grasped her cold body tightly to his chest.
(Yes Dumbledore is one hell of twisted bastard when he is feeling threatened, more so than even Voldemort and could prove just as much of a threat in later chapters, for now he was thwarted, but for how long?)
Surrey.
Whereas the Dark Lord simply pulled his wand out, cast a diagnostic to make sure his prize wasn't in immediate danger of death prematurely and then pointed it at the Dark Elf he thought he had killed years ago "How nice to see you again, Osiris, you will be restrained you will not die immediately as I want to know the circumstances of you bringing Harry to us, if you can be useful to his rise maybe I might spare you but first look into my eye's you filthy half-breed and show me your memories!" He shouted, red eye's latching on to magenta one's.
With a second of genius Harry wordlessly layered a triple cast of 'Divina Secundum Aspectum, Visus Scelerisque and Feles Oculos' to make sure he could see all the creatures even if they were under some kind of Spectral concealment.
Griphook led them back through the dark hall way and deposited Harry and Osiris back into the cart, as Harry expressed wanting his blocks removed it was imperative they get him to the ritual room and on to the raised dais.
Aunt: Narcissa Black-Malfoy (Alive)
They preceded to drag Osiris bodily through the hall, despite the wizards and witches gathered, both bound and silenced while Harry was floating along peacefully overhead of one of the wizard guards.
"I must ask Sirius, how do you know it is Peter Pettigrew that was the Potters Secret Keeper? And more to the point why did Albus Dumbledore allow the change without informing the ministry after their deaths, we are yet to take a statement from him and he has not submitted a report on his own" Kingsley enquired a tad pissed off, "I believe he doesn't have any involvement in knowing their death's, however I would have thought he would submit something given his position and what he gains to lose if he withholds such information" Sirius conceded the man was in trouble when they go to get his statement.
"Is that so.. well you wouldn't mind us verifying you are indeed Mr Black, now would you?" The goblin sneered as he reach a hand to grasp the mans hand, "Not at all, the Noble House Of Black is thankful for your strenuously increased Security during these uncertain times" he replied as he grasped the goblins hand firmly, he flinched minutely as he felt the goblins claws scrape and draw blood on to the form he had sat atop the desk.
'I have a feeling Severus has found out about the Potters' and rushed there, I wouldn't put it past the sharp man or for Voldemort to gloat about Wormtail's apparent good idea, we shall see shortly I expect' he thought gleefully in anticipation as he guided Minerva and his fellow students into the Great Hall for breakfast.
'I can't believe I am going through this, to have James Potter's son my ward, if Lily hadn't run off with the bastard, I would not be doing this or if I hadn't met Harry the moment he were born and felt his power being worth such a risk as this, letting me become the hunted of Fae, Death Eaters and Vampire alike, he is making more work for me in a day than even the hundreds of student's manage in a year, I will at least raise his many gifts and potential right I hope for all our sakes' he thought as he began chopping ingredients and stiring the simmering concoction the precise amount of times as he mentally went through the steps.
Albus shot him a searching look as he said this, Remus could only nod as he turned to pick up the child, "Sirius has gone to the ministry as you requested he has Peter too, the Rat decided to play the lier and tried to run from arrest, he is now to be interrogated for the possible involvement of the Potter's murder, I hope for his sake he did not betray us" he said in quiet rage, carrying Harry to sit directly opposite the headmaster, "Do you know what happened?, did Sirius or Severus give you a full report?" Remus tiredly replied, his eyes reverting back to his calm deep brown as he sighed, lifting Harry to rest on his arms, discreetly casting a wordless Finite Incantatum on the boy in his hands, who's wings at least reverted back and an explosion of magical power flowed off his form, instantly Remus eyes narrowed "You have some explaining to do Dumbledore if a mere finite could remove the blocks placed in his mind and magic, it was no obscure Dark spell as you just said!" He growled as he pointed his wand at the man, "Remus you best lower your wand, it would not do well to accuse me and attempt to hold me at wand point" Albus said leaving the unspoken deadly threat lying within his deep blue gaze.
Osiris took that as a cue to create a portal out of the room and run away from the scene until they were more decent. 'You need to teach me that trick Osiris it seems to bypass wizard wards and seems very handy now that I have the capacity to learn what wizards can not' Harry thought to him as he watched the portal close, 'I and your followers will train you in time for Hogwarts, have fun with your mate and new lover' Osiris responded before shutting down the mind connection his end so he wouldn't catch Harry's further thought's.
(See the end of the chapter for
He took a tour of the first floor, taking note of the spell damage along the walls and door frames, yet was wary of his magical signature being found in the residence when others eventually came snooping, so refrained from fixing any of his surroundings, a simple Reparo, would have done the trick on most of this however it would mask the Dark Lords signature and incriminate his own, after Dumbledore went through the trouble of defending his position as Spy, he was not keen on giving reason to spread more doubt on his loyalties regardless of how fickle his fielty towards society was.
Remus's eyes flashed gold again as he threw a full body bind at Albus, who deftly fell to the side and rolled outside the spell path, "You are making a mistake Remus" he said quietly, "If you let the boy run around leaking his powerful presence the court's will sense him from miles away this is for his own and others safety!" Albus spat.
Rosier
Harry just gulped as he put his hand through barrier and touched the creatures face, he sighed as he felt no sudden reaction to his draining of the creatures life force, it visibly withered unmovingly floating in the water and died under sedation, even the goblins sighed appreciative of that threat being dealt with 'I'm helping them remove threats to them it seems but I can still choose my forms and strengths' Harry thought now brimming with renewed hunger.
"Headmaster I believe it best we do such a risky adoption here, it is of my opinion, safe guarding city occupants takes priority, new born vampires are extremely vulnerable to the thirst, I will likely need to be chained and warded as you take the necessary blood from me and encourage me to drink a portion of the boy's, It is likely I will be driven to kill once the ceremony is complete therefore I would like you both participate in the bonding to minimise the risk of infecting others, the Room Of Requirement will work for this however it will need to be cleansed before the ritual, I will handle the necessary items needed for the task, do I have your permission to start immediately?" Severus directed at Albus and Sirius as they sat in deep contemplation, to the side and across from him, they had been there discussing logistics for hours pertaining to the likely scenarios this route would present, especially the legal backlash the ministry was likely to condemn them for.
Aruspices Bombarda Maxima - All Organs Rupture
"Suit yourself just be aware I will be dominating two tonight and I want you scarce when that happens!" Draco said with a snort as he snuggled further back into the seats and Harry's oblivious embrace.
'HOW THE HELL!' they all thought which the woman caught on to and grinned even wider "You are deciding the fate of one of our clans newborn, regardless of the fact his parents are dead and the fact he is an abomination of mixed fae and vampiric blood, he is the most powerful being you will ever meet mortals, we are here to make sure despite this you make the appropriate decisions and treat him with the respect and care our race needs to survive, he is very important mainly to us because he represents hope the war between us and the Fae does not mean love between two can not be, he is the first hybrid born in a very long time, do make the right choice headmaster unless you wish us to do harm" she whispered playfully
'The fucking guardian council took away all my efforts to ensure a weapon against the bastard Tom, as well as any hope of grooming the nasty creature into a naive pawn, he is rich, powerful and a threat to both me and Voldemort, do I have to step in when he returns to the mortal realm? What if the prick joins with the other dark creatures such as the Malfoys who will have a child ready for Hogwarts at that time? Will he do a James and create covenants within the school and bite other students? Maybe if he does I can use that to shackle him to my cause? If I can kill him also before his inheritance maybe he will not be such as issue to deal with.. we will have to see' Albus thought as he settled down to finish his paperwork in agitation.
"A blood Adoption of a half Dark Elf and Half Vampire lineage, you say? With extraordinary abilities? I dare say the boy would be keyed into elemental and blood magic as if it were second nature not to mention any of his wizarding capabilities, I would hazard a guess he was also a natural metamorphamagi? Or Animagus? This presents very worrisome complications especially if he were under an ex Death Eaters tutelage, he would be deemed a national threat under the Dark Creatures acts if I remember correctly, who will be the sponsor if I am to actually go against my beliefs here and accept this proposal?" She asked with narrowed eyes, Sirius scratched his head and replied "Albus Dumbledore sent me here he is aware and is taking the proper precautions especially regarding housing and participating in the adoption ritual itself, does that suffice Mrs Kettleburn?" He said with slightly harder edge to his voice 'She better say yes and not interfere or I will hex her, kingsley be damned!' He thought angrily.
It was a long time before he managed to pull himself together and sit up, he needed a firm hold on his magic as he was still weak from his recent transformation, before he went to guard Harry, he took a brief moment to centre the quiet rage within him before turning on the spot and apparating to Hogsmead, his golden eyes still blazing at the treachery he had just witnessed, he was feeling very protective of what was his right now and Harry was his cub now, "I have a duty to what is mine, to protect him, Dumbledore better not stand in my way this time!" He growled darkly as he set off swiftly up the snowy path towards the castle looming in the distance ahead.
Aunt: Petunia Evan's Dursley (Alive)
Before anyone could add to this the room darkened as the candles flickered out making the portraits scream and Albus eyes to widen as two newcomers entered the room through the only window atop the tower, a dark beauty with white porcelain skin and lustrous blonde curls, her eyes a deep crimson, the only give away of her race if not for the fanged smirk gracing her lips at their stunned expressions.
Sirius walked in but made no move to sot down as Ragnok promptly stood behind his desk, "Please take a seat" the goblin said as he eyed him with hostility, "I think I will stand, some people have work to do and can't afford relaxation when there is business to attend to" he snapped, "Indeed, what brings you here today Lord Black?" Ragnok asked replacing hostility with a curious leer.
Albus Dumbledore groaned as he awoke, draped awkwardly along the stiff furnishings of his winged high back chair after having been collapsed in it all night, sprawled over various notices and correspondences in his office.
He was interrupted however when Blaise knock and came in "How's the now Dark Gryffindork?" He inquired with a teasing smirk, Draco flushed slightly but responded in a cold tone "He is resting I was just figuring out what he actually is, how goes the prisoner downstairs?" He shot back.
His golden eyes slanted slightly at the irises becoming akin to a cat's, giving him the accompanied night vision (an impressive feat of transfiguration ol' McGonagle would be proud he thought), as well as glowed with a tinge of red and silver as the other thermal and divine sense spells layered his senses giving him a full view of all the occupants hiding within the shadows of the chamber ahead of them.
Blinking to attempt to ward off the sun lights glare, he finally saw Sirius standing at his doorstep which was not an uncommon occurrence, dressed in his usual black trench coat, messy curls, dark blue Jean's and Twisted Sister t-shirt, it wasn't until he caught the look in the anxiously wide brown eyes that he realised something was wrong, "Come in Padfoot, we were just getting ready for lunch.. what can I do for you?" Remus asked thirdly.
"Ms Peterson, look at the instructions I only just put on the board and tell me why you have already committed a mistake in preparing to brew the potion?" He sneered at the bespectacled Hufflepuff girl quaking under his glare.
The being in question was a Shaytan, an evil mix of Illusionary demon and ancient Djinn, considered one of the most evil existences in the Wizarding world with boundless power, hell he was only hear because he knew he would have to sacrifice himself to aid Harry's goals for a better world not because he was mistakenly captured but because he purposely made it so, no one can capture a Djinn they usually are trapped into a harmless illusion and die slowly living out their lives in it adding to the power of the Djinn, given they have an infinite life span and he wasn't stupid at all just wasn't much of a talker so sat back and enjoyed the show.
"Lord Potter I must ask you to please refrain from taking down the only barrier between us and numerous Dark Creature's currently stronger than you even at their weakest, be vigilant, when we go in you must have a choose of seven rare dark creature's to inherit from, choose wisely this is the last time we can cater your new cravings and each gift should reflect your future hunting plans" Griphook warned with a frown.
Inheritance Blocks:
Plenam Pecunia Solvere - Silver Full Body Bind, Auror's use this hex to ensnare and capture rogue werewolves.
Ragnok sighed in exasperation before shouting "The Order as they did not attempt to aid Albus Dumbledore is free to use their accounts and do business with us should they appear again, they probably was not told that they would have to strong arm Gringotts Staff into releasing Harry Potter to them, they are not the ministry therefore they had no legal grounds to take him or order us, Albus Dumbledore is the sole perpetrator of this in his attempt to apprehend Lord Potter, we will be seizing his account assets and banning him from the premises as collateral for his assault but nothing more, the Auror's will not be involved at this time, you are free to leave or go about usual business, we goblins take your safety and patronage seriously and thank you for your time in our establishment" before turning away and swiftly walking to the rosewood door left open, the screams seeming to have tapered off sometime in the midst of Albus Dumbledore's attempt at assaulting him.
Magicae Obstructionum - Magic Block, this corrupts the magical core of a person via placing a block and restricting ones magic and magical potential, It is lethal to a child and dangerous if left untreated in adults.
"Erm Griphook is the Lactura safe around anything in this room? They have a much stronger appetite for magic than even I do" Harry asked nervously staring at the sleeping beast.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Listen Kingsley I was hoping to sort out other matters in other departments first, feel free to accompany me if you wish? I will debrief you along the way, you will need a Quick Quotes Quill or you won't be able to keep up" Sirius asked as he was herded into a lift full of inter-departmental memos flying around the ceiling, as the grills locked them in he faced Kingsley, hoping he was ready to take notes, Kingsley's cool gaze met his and with a flick of his wand the quill and parchment appeared out of thin air to float with the quill poised to paper, Kingsley lifted his eyebrow in question prompting Sirius to begin his recount of the days events, careful not to let on Harry was anything other than human, at least until they visited the Department Of The Regulation For Dark And Dangerous Creatures later to file Harry's Dhampire Creature Blood Status, knowing the longer it took the Ministry to find out he is without Sire, the better it was for Harry.
Remus makes his way to guard Harry from Dumbledore's influence, Sirius takes Peter and deals with the logistics of handing over his god child to Severus and the school and learns of a strange connection between the Fae and Harry.
Sirius sneered as he approached the intersection between Diagon and Knockturn at the Rats reaction "You aren't escaping this Peter this I will assure, for I was actually James's best friend and will avenge him for his and Harry's sake, I bet you haven't even seen the boy, just fled the scene leaving a poor defenceless child to rot along with your master!" He snarled in accusation.
"We are here to monitor your adoption of young Harry and to take you and others with us for potential training should you wish it, they are all on the floor mainly due to Dumbledore's aggressive reaction to us protecting Harry from his manipulations though we aren't discouraging his Wizarding heritage just because he is one of the immortal clan, he will be returning to this school at 11 just like every other wizard he will just have a must higher aptitude that needs prerequisite training before he is allowed to mingle with mortals, did you bring the adoption potion like a good boy Severus? My name is Flora by the way, though let me make it clear Immortal does not mean invulnerable, he is still delicate until his majority given his creature inheritance will only give him his full powers then, I suggest Dumbledore we find some teaching staff later on to cater for his aptitudes when we realise the extent of his abilities, at which time you will be informed of people sent with him to teach him extra classes than the rest of your school though you won't have to pay these new staff members and we will not meddle in what's not our affairs it is simply to allow him the best education of both worlds".
They all blinked owlishly before Draco answered "I will await you at home then love after your Gringotts visit, come mother, Blaise, we have other matters to attend to as does Harry if what is to be believed we will meet him later" they all got up as Harry cast a silent disillusionment charm again "Harry non-verbal and wandless? I must say you are astonishing already!" Narcissa murmured to the invisible grinning Harry before disapperating with the other two, leaving him once again alone and heading towards the imposing grey stone building housing Gringotts.
Sonia strode apprehensively, out of the lifts as they opened, toward the Regulation Of Dark and Dangerous Creatures Department to meet Dedalus in his office.
Cousin: Nymphadora Violet Tonks (Alive)
"Well Draco you could say I went under quite the change I am now one of the rarest Dark Creatures to grace our mortal realm, I'm sure your mother can tell which one, question is can my mate figure it out?" Harry chuckled at the even stupider expressions that graced all the kids faces.
Non Verbal (Broken)
He was about to walk back upstairs with Blaise when he stopped suddenly mid step, causing his friend to pump into him from behind by accident, "What the hell Draco mind it!" He said indignantly, trying to push Draco up the stairs so he would get moving instead of standing there but he didn't know that Draco was feeling something very weird.
Harry meanwhile was having a tough time keeping up with constant barrage, he was only liquid after all! 'Maybe I might be able to drag it down and absorb it that way like this thing tried to do to me before I overwhelmed it with the same tactic' he thought, steeling his resolve, he moved again and actually jump on the creature and started expanding over it exactly like a slime eating its prey and as the struggling Hydra didn't have sapping abilities it could no longer put up a good fight instead it wasn't long before it was overwhelmed especially being only a young one with not so many heads or abilities, becoming easy prey for Harry finally.
They were quick to obey despite Snape's signature sneer at Sirius for presuming he was incompetent and having the bollocks to think about ordering him to do anything.
"I could floo her but we mustn't leave or his forces may find us, the fidelius won't hold if we are risky over such a thing, I will ask her to bring little Tonks over at Christmas as that is when they are next off but we will have to wait until then unless it is an emergency as we can handle Harry as long as you don't give him your invisibility cloak" she said eyeing him sternly.
Luckily only the family were in the house and the elf or their nosy little one would be the cause of many security issues if the house still had other occupants lurking around disillusioned.
Rosier Vault: (Inaccessible)
He snarled in outrage before starting to chant a long forgotten charm he kept just in case of him ever having tight wards against him "Diébus Vitæ Equitum Solis!" In a flash of orange light, his spell severed all the wards of the building effectively freeing him before he broke the anti disapperation and disappearing in a crack of spiralling purple robes.
The logistics meeting to house one Harry Potter progresses, Sirius finds Wormtail, Remus heads to Hogwarts while Sirius make his way to Ministry and Gringotts.
"Damn girl now that is an even more beautiful form, I will curse them all for what they did to you my love, things will be changing shortly, I know Fawkes can flash out, how do you?" Harry asked intrigued, Hedwig jumped off and spun in the air creating a mini blizzard of snow before disappearing in response causing Harry to laugh, "Now that is dealt with shall we proceed Griphook?" Harry asked as he turned back to the Goblin who was slack jawed clearly astounded he got to meet a legendary Ice Phoenix, one of the rarest among Pheonix types.
"Albus! I tried to catch you before you got down here but I missed you, your office was empty upon my arrival, have you seen Severus? I tried to floo him earlier to organise a student's detention but oddly he was not in his lab nor as Mr Filch seen him since early last night, this is undignified for the staff to be absent so I hope he was just eating breakfast early" Minerva enquired, "I confess Minerva I have not seen Severus since dinner yesterday, I doubt my staff are staging a mutiny, least of all Severus you know how serious the man is with potions, nevertheless if he is not in the hall by the end of breakfast, I will endeavor to find our runaway potions master or teach the class in his stead, should finding him in the castle be futile, until he does show himself, now let's go in shall we" he gestured to the oak doors outside of the Great Hall, where students were milling around waiting for their fellow houses to arrive.
Pulchritudo Sanguis Ligatis - Blood Bind Glamour, it casts a glamour our the biological signature of a person so that they may hide in human form unless a person of their blood removes it, the caster or themselves.
"You dare deny me my mate Parkinson? I can deal with sharing a little if it is platonic or agreed by us given I am sort of a sexual creature especially if I steal from an Incubus but you dare deny my rite to claim what is mine? Are you picking a fight with me? It is taking all my will power to beat the urge to turn you into a fucking squib, all it takes is a touch from me and you will never again grace the Wizarding World, want to test me?" Harry spits out angrily at her 'what gives her the fucking rite!' He thinks indignantly as he draws nearer to her and by extension his mate.
"Now boy's let's see if my abilities can make you delirious from sexual pleasure despite it being my first time and with men of all things!" Harry said with a smirk.
"Ah just the snivelling mutt I wanted to see, we were just talking about you, why don't you join the party Black!" He spat as the other man tensed and walked further into the room.
How long had he been there? Time was irrelevant in her cold embrace, days? Weeks? But no it had been only minutes before he heard crying beneath the folds of his robes, 'What the fuck!' He thought "Lily are you alive? Or did you save your son?" He said softly trying to shake her slightly, hoping he was mistaken, it was only when a small hand smacked him in the chest did he look down admist his shaking of Lily to find Harry's fiery gaze as he cried and intended to beat the thing that had awoken him, 'he has quite the strength' thought in a daze as he eyed the child critically.
As Draco watched Pansy being threatened and portrayed away and his new ethereal lover, Harry walking away towards Gringotts, he couldn't help the sense of deep satisfaction and childish excitement from bubbling up within the depths of his mind, behind expertly placed occlumency shields.
"Well that was enlightening, if you don't mind I will sleep in your delightfully comfy chair as I prefer that than my old living quarters of Gringotts dungeon or where this fellow threw me" Osiris said to Draco as he pointed at Blaise.
"Yes it is, Headmaster we must talk now in your office this is of the upmost importance, we will wait for you there with your permission" Severus said tightly, trying to keep a hand on the infant to prevent it from falling out of his grasp.
What creatures should he sap? Will he make it back to Draco or will Albus intervene?
"Potter!, what the hell do you want, why are you here? Profit said you were finally gutted by Death Eaters, what's up with your change in visage?" Draco sneered while Blaise eyed him with cool interest and Pansy with open disdain.
Gringotts Bank, Daigon Alley.
"Do it, I want to know how deep I have been played!" Harry nodded and slit his palm again to drop more blood on the parchment handed to him, showing a list of things currently affecting him.
Draco looked at him in horror "How dare you call my mate a thing! I saw that his instincts had taken over earlier I know for a fact he has not changed enough to not have human morals, his additions only add to his magical capabilities meaning I am safest with him! Can't you see what this will grant you now that fate blessed us with the possibility of rejuvenating long lost Malfoy Gene's! We will have children of his Chimera abilities and our ancestors Incubi Gene's! Hell he could awaken my own with his power! Wouldn't that make us much more powerful than we are? He is an asset and one I am deeply enamored with, please give your blessing without being ordered to or we will have a falling out father" he said upset that his father couldn't see the opportunity for what it was.
Sirius just stood there for a few minutes patiently and ideally until the goblin he was dealing with returned, watching the other occupants as they were being served for any suspicious behaviour.
As he opened it he noticed the impenetrable charm on the door given the sudden loud voices as he bolted through the door, he looked around briefly at the other members sitting rigidly along the dining table, leaving him the space at the head and Albus cuffed at the opposite end held at wand point by Alastor who's revolving eye was spinning in all directions enough to make those close to him sick if they stared to long.
"Siri that's not a bad idea you know, is it true Albus went after our cub and even attacked Gringotts to get him? Shall we find him ourselves? Maybe something is wrong with him, after what the Profit reported this morning I worry love!" He said as he walked down to wrap his arms around a shaking Sirius who hadn't replied.
Praemoenio - Strengthen
Severus merely eyed the child speculatively and snorted at the mans anguish, beside him and also the heavy dose of fake sympathy Dumbledore said to sway the petulant mutt next to him, 'if he can't do that to save a child he really isn't a man and is truly unfit for this extraordinary child, I would do it just as penance for not being able to save his mother' he thought.
James didn't go straight to the door, he picked up his invisibility cloak before edging along the hallway and down the stairs, he sensed a cold blooded and warm blooded creature on the other side of the door, putting him on high alert, no one he knew was cold blooded but he could guess from the scent the warm blooded of the two was the rat Wormtail, the other was thick with the stink of Dark Magic, he could only guess who it was knocking.
If this were a muggle town, he would seem out of place as well as breaking the statute of secrecy, merely standing silently facing to the north west of his position in the dim cold morning air, despite not breaking this however he edged forward silently, eyeing his surroundings critically, eager to avoid detection, as he headed in the direction of the Potter Estate Manor, the last thing he wanted to do was to alert the ministry and by extension his fellow Death Eaters or even Dumbledore of his presence here.
James however did not hear here through his silencing ward and instead was busy shifting through Auror reports on his desk.
To Like Ronald Weasley,
James jumped out of bed and quickly put a robe on before running to the floo room leaving her agonized cries in his wake, he grabbed a princh of floo powder and threw it into the flames "Headmasters Office, Hogwarts" he growled.
"Albus, allow me to house him, I will do the rite, no child of Lily's will be thrown to the wind, wasting her sacrifice on the off chance the boy may be cared for, at least then you could supervise as could Black or Lupin, though we both know the chances of Lupins guardianship being less than hostile due to the boys lineage, it would be best to make him a ward of the school to make sure he is cared for especially as he will be a student in the year 1991, over ten years from now and will need the finest education if we wish him a chance in the harsh reality outside these walls" he drawled, eyeing Albus and Sirius, daring them to refute or give a more logical suggestion.
Severus made a soft incision with a wordless Sectumsempra and Albus spelled it bloodless so Poppy could reach in and grab the baby out of uterus sack, she popped the sack quickly to grab hold of the baby when an inhuman shriek reached their ears and a powerful magical backlash rose through the room throwing the occupants into the wall with loud thuds, James was the first to recover and pick the baby out of her before sealing the wound and carrying his screaming son to his mother softly groaning on the bed.

"The Potter's have been murdered by the Dark Lord, Sirius is investigating and thinks Peter helped the insane bastard! Leaving their day old boy Harry an orphan, somehow the boy killed Voldemort as well, Sirius saw his body with his own eyes this morning if you haven't yet read the paper" he barked in a voraciously feral whisper before stalking off towards the direction of the castle, not even giving her a chance to reply, minutes past as she just gawped owlishly at his retreating form, it took a patron to tap her on the arm for her to come out of the daze she apparently was under as if someone had wordlessly stupified her and it was only just now wearing off.
After half an hour of constant battle it finally ended in an anti climactic way, the Hydra was simply devoured by Harry whom after finishing transformed back into himself with a large belch clearly satisfied, making Osiris laughed both in relief and because the sight was actually ridiculously funny, the Goblins cackled as well, shoulders slumping in relief as Harry jumped back out of the barrier given it was keyed to the type of beasts it was holding.
"Ddumbledore wwants me to bbetray the Ppotters to the Dark Lord? I need to eradicate this missives memory so he will see it as my own genius that ousts them from their hide away and then be rewarded" Wormtail stutters to himself laying out his own plan of retribution, 'James shouldn't have made me feel so inferior, if he had been less than arrogant, I would have spared him this, conspiring with Dumbledore to end his line' he thought angrily as he whispered "Obliviate" and pulled up his sleeve to call his master...
"My boy I saw fit to make sure the ritual is the only time people will see his correct form due to the way the ministry is likely to come searching for him as well as others before hand, James was already deep within the Vampire High Court's grudge list for his many accomplishments as an Auror, without his Sire, Harry is vulnerable as he is, this will protect him from prejudice in the meantime before the ritual takes place" he said projecting his grand fatherly aura as if he were the wisest of the two.
Lily screamed even louder at this, the pain of the counter curse fixing the damage as fast as the contractions came was too much to bare, she feared her son will be still born and her dead if something didn't give soon, James just stood there watching in despair or at least as much as a natural vampire could show his human counterpart.
Three species of reptiles caught his eye, whilst they lay asleep (which he was thankful for) A young green Basillisk lay beside two huge figures one even had multiple different colour heads spitting a different elemental magic continuously at the barrier, clearly angry at its bindings, the other merely glanced and shrieked at its captures, A dragon and a very rare Hydra with a three heads meaning it was teenage antsy being pissed at being caught, Harry read briefly about that animal in Fantastic Beasts when Hagrid was busy finding more and more dangerous animals to show them in class, apparently the more heads it has the older in its natural cycle it is and the more powers it unlocks, they have an innate elemental control ability and regenerative power, whereas on closer inspection of the Dragon it was clear it was an adolescent as well but had a rare mix of incandescent midnight blue and purple scales making Harry assume it was a mixed breed between the Ukrainian Ironbelly and the Icelandic Shadow Dragon, both a truly magnificent and terrifying sight, the combination of ironbelly defence as well as the ability to literally become darkness or smoke to disguise itself was a truly deadly mix.
She cursed quietly as the elf fumbled and squealed his apologies 'Paddy just had to take James seriously and botch the job and my efforts to calm little Harry' Lily thought a touch indignantly as she took the crying boy into her arms to try and calm him again.
Specie Alis - Glamour Wings, used to douse specific non human traits.
Before an answer was given there was a knock at the door as Severus Snape stepped in the room, seeing the scene before him he immediately drew his wand and pointed at the unknown beings before him "Who are you to assault Hogwarts staff?" He spat icely, "Well Mr Snape.. we are members of the Guardian Council for immortal magical creatures, I trust you know why we are here now?" Flora drawled with a smirk at his look for surprise.
"You better fucking stay put Peter, I am warning you now, you will remain until you are interrogated at the ministry for your involvement and as you are yet to register even if you are innocent sadly you will still be fined for not registering your Animagus ability with the ministry, quite a shake huh?" Sirius whispered fiercely at him, who just squeaked, twitched and trembled in the spell bound cage, looking side to side as if for an escape route.
~Harry Pov~
"Albus! What the hell did you think you were doing attacking a goblin just to get to Harry? Sure the coincidences are disturbing but what the hell made you incite a potential war with the goblins! You are the leader of the light, what image does that scream to the denizens of Diagon Alley? Do you know something we don't about Harry? Why are you attempting to go to such lengths and drag us along without a moments thought to our own reputations?" Minerva screamed at him as she made a beeline through the others to get at him.
Narcissa abruptly turned to her son and narrowed her eyes "Draco I advise you not to antagonize him any further, I had heard that he came into his inheritance last night and actually scheduled that entire article himself" she said quietly before casting "Muffiato", Draco seemed to splutter at that which Harry found very cute so he smiled at him as his gaze fixed on him.
Visus Sclerisque - Thermal Sight
"I swear Harry if this is going to be a ongoing thing with you, you better do something about your dangerous antics!" Draco sighed as he also slipped into the sheets with him and grabbed a book, seemingly carved from actual Dragon skin, from his nightstand entitled 'Secret's Of The Darkest Art's: A Gruesome Compendium Of Dark Creature Lore', hoping to read more about his loves' kind as it always paid to be in the know and 'Malfoy's were always in the know as Lucius always told him, failure wasn't tolerated' he thought idely skimming it's list of contents.
"Harry if you are the last thing she protected this voraciously in life, it is my duty to protect you and see you continue to survive, I owe this to her to see you safe and the chance to live like she wanted you to" he murmured quietly to the infant with a lump in his throat, as he held back more tears within his tear stained onyx eyes.
"Bit presumptive aren't you Blaise, fine Draco tops me first he has the rights to my virginity as my mate, you get an after taste, you are lucky I feel generous at all after blatantly and brazenly attempting to come between us!" Harry said his eyes lustrously promising pain though the delicious kind.
'If that old fool touches Harry, I am scared of what I would do in this frame of mind' Remus thought as he neared the Hogwarts boundary gate, he took a moment to centre himself as he gazed at the numerous looming turrets and the gargoyles they occupied, hoping he would at least not fail to protect his cub if no one else.
"I don't wish to risk my only heir, the sole person to continue our line, he is the darkest thing to walk this earth Draco, we have never taught you about them because even their familiar bonds are dangerous unless the wizard can handle the drain having one has on their magic, it is much higher than bonding with house elves it is near lethal let alone a humanoid one! His appetite now exceedes to eating the boundless power of leylines, how is that safe around you? Use your head!" Lucius said pained at the death stare he was receiving from his stupid son who seemed blindsided like if Hagrid were to have found more dangerous pets to keep.
Higher Necromancy (100%)
Harry wasn't having it a second time, he wailed even in her grasp, though did become quickly sidetracked into sniffles when he glimpsed her throat and made a wriggle for it. Caught off guard Lily became more angry "James how dare you give him to me without feeding him! He's after me now and I'm too weak to fight him come and get him!" She shouted down the hall.

At first nothing seemed wrong from his distance, despite the gate hangingly ajar, the building lay silent and in tact, without the Dark Mark looming ominously over head, this should have placated anyone else who came snooping if it weren't him, the wards had unmistakably fallen or he wouldn't have known the location or seen it as he neared their residence.
Pansy didn't have none of it "Mate? Since when did Draco ever lower himself to the likes of you Potter! He is with whom he belongs not you but me and Blaise!" She screams shrilly not notice all occupants narrow their eyes in anger at her or the dark look that came over both Narcissa and Harry's faces.
Draco might be good looking but he couldn’t compete with her. Never her. And that sometimes was a relief, because it meant that it wasn’t his fault for being less. It was just that Ginny was more. And Harry deserved more.
Draco started to grab his things to leave. He couldn’t stand it anymore and he would need to see Harry later, so they could work on a project for the English class they both took together. He needed to regain his strength and reign his feelings inside before they became too close to the surface. As he stood up, Harry’s eyes found him for the first time since he walked into the cafeteria.
Draco chuckled with the irony of it all. Oh, he loved alcohol.
Draco never wished more to be able to concentrate before. To just tune out and continue to work on his project, so he and Harry could get straight A’s.
He took another swing on his beer and watched Ginny from the other side of the room.
“Yeah. I’m fine,” Draco said, his voice weak to his own ears.
. She didn’t deserve it and she made Harry so happy after all.
Draco noticed only then, as he regarded himself again in the mirror of the bathroom, the tears that tainted his cheeks. He splashed some water on his face to regain some composure before he answered Harry.
Draco stared.
“Sure. I’ll go out in a minute,” Draco took a deep breath.
He looked down, to his hands and Harry’s intertwined, and let a single tear run down his face.
The silence was heavy in the car. Draco just wanted this to be over so he could cry his heart out, away from Harry and from all the love he had ever known besides his family’s. He felt like choking.
Harry would miss him just as much as Draco would miss him. Just not in the same way.
“Nerd,” Blaise sing-songed mockingly and everyone started to laugh. Even Hermione, the queen of the nerds. Talk about hypocrisy.
“Why wouldn’t I?”
. Draco had flushed all the way from his neck to his ears and couldn’t make out any response besides a humm that would seem embarrassed to anyone else but Harry.
for an answer now, so he would certainly notice if Draco lied.
“Why did you kiss him?” Harry asked quietly, even if it sounded loud in the silence of the car.
Ginny stole Harry away and Draco surrendered to her because she deserved that happiness too. She deserved someone as good as Harry.
Harry didn’t move.
Draco gulped in a dry throat.
He was going to point that out but he was interrupted.
“Bullshit. Yours' soaking wet. I don’t want you to get cold like last time,” Harry said from the other side of the room.
“Me? Did I do something wrong?” Harry seemed worried and took Draco’s hands that were folded in his lap.
He stopped in a halt when he reached his friends and rolled his eyes at Pansy as he started to fist bump Ron, Harry, and Blaise, and kissed the girl’s cheeks. Even Ginny’s, because he was polite like that.
He stood up and left the living room, leaving his empty beer bottle on the floor by the couch, happy for once that Harry wouldn’t notice. He made his way to the bathroom and thanked the god’s for it was empty of drunk horny teenagers.
and he could do nothing but stare and see the salt being poured on his wounds.
“Then what do you mean?”
“What took you so long?” Pansy asked the moment she saw him approaching, her eyebrows furrowed. Now everyone was looking at him, Ginny and Harry included.
Even then, Draco kinda wished she stopped breathing so that living didn’t hurt that much for
A hand slipped away from his grip and went to his chin, lifting his face to teary green eyes.
“Harry, I can use my own sweater,” Draco grumbled but put on the clothes after he removed his own anyways, not being even slightly timid about being shirtless in front of Harry. They were childhood friends, after all, and they used to bathe together when younger. It was normal.
“Because I realized I wanted it,” Harry answered, seeming awed from this discovery.
He let himself die.
He didn’t.
And then, Harry was kissing him.
As his lips touched the other guy’s, Draco let go.
That happiness wasn’t directed at him.
Draco rolled his eyes and made his way to his best friend’s bed. He made himself comfortable against the pillows and looked at Harry, standing in front of his wardrobe catching new clothes for himself. They had to run to Harry's house from the skate park they hang out after school when the winter cold rain had hit them before they could seek refugees anywhere else.
Draco lifted his unoccupied hand and touched Harry’s hand on his face.
Harry stared back.
“B-but,” What the fuck was happening right now? “What about Ginny, Harry?”
Harry’s lips, that now Draco knew were as soft as they looked, became thin and tense.
“You always told me I’m oblivious, and that sometimes I need things rubbed onto my face,” Harry continued with a small smile on his face. “That was more true than we both thought.”
“You need to wait for your own to dry out, at least,” Harry kept saying, not even looking at Draco, as he searched in his mess of used clothes for a fresh one. But then he looked up and turned his face to regard Draco from the top of his shoulder and smiled with a fondness that made Draco’s heart rate speed up. “Besides, it looks much better on you.”
Draco’s heart broke a little more each breath he took. Each second he watched.
He deserved everything in the world.
“Do what?”
Draco wondered if he was dreaming.
“Why, you just want his grades, Blaise. Stop being jealous, this is not a good look on you,” Ginny said with a sharp smile that made her look strangely cute. Even Draco could see that. Why the hell did she need to be so nice anyway?
If he wanted.
They were friends since always and Harry loved him just as much as Draco loved him. Just not in the same way.
The bell rang and another week at school ended. Draco mechanically grabbed his things and went out of the chemistry lab without thinking twice about it, as he was still trying to figure out what had he done wrong on today’s experiment. The hallways of the building were fulling up as he made his way to his locker. He left his books he wouldn’t need for the weekend and grabbed the ones he needed for homework quietly, greeting and nodding to people he knew and was friendly with from multiple classes or from the skate park. He was alone as he made his way out of the building and into the parking lot though, but he wouldn’t be for long.
Draco wished it were.
The sound of the cafeteria was muffled as Draco’s heart thumped loudly on his ears. It was lunchtime, and Pansy was making jokes along with Ron and Blaise in an attempt of releasing a bit of the stress of the last week of exams, but he felt anything even slightly similar to relief as he stared at the table across from him.
Harry took a deep breath and his eyes widened slightly as if he had realized something. He closed his eyes and leaned into Draco, over the console of the car, and touched their foreheads. Draco didn’t know what was happening, but Harry just breathed in and cried with his forehead touching Draco’s. They cried together silently, holding onto each other and not letting go.
He couldn’t eat. He could only play with his food and pretend to be stressed when his friends asked about why he couldn’t have even a single bite of the potato puree of the canteen. He could only catch glances from Harry as he pretended to be fine while watching his heart being crushed once more. He knew he was a good actor, so his friends let him sulk quietly. In a way that only one person would be able to see through.
It would be really good if he could hate her but he just
What the fuck would he say to that? Harry would see right through him. He always had and he is
“You’re not the type of person that kisses random guys. So why did you do it?”
“Harry, let’s just go. It’s fine, really. The alcohol is starting to fade, and I’m starting to have a headache. Just take me home, please,” Draco asked him with pleading eyes.
“I love you, Harry. I’m so sorry.” Draco couldn’t hold the tears down anymore. They were running wildly now, probably making his face all red and puffy. He probably looked disgusting, but he didn’t care. Harry had better memories of him than this moment.
“I had no idea,” Harry whispered.
He tore his eyes away from the window and looked at Harry, who was gripping the wheel with white-knuckle strength.
And maybe, it was time to let go, so he could pursue the happiness he deserved as well.
They were in his car and Harry was driving him home. Draco felt lightheaded from the alcohol and disgusted with himself. He had made out with that guy for a while before trying to retreat because it didn’t feel right, and then the guy started screaming that he was a slut and that he didn’t want Draco anyway. Harry came to his defense and punched the guy. They were kicked out of the party. It was a mess.
“I told you—”
But then it happened again. Harry’s hand left his own and cupped his other cheek as if he was precious and he pressed his lips against Draco’s with more certainty. His eyes were closed and Draco just didn’t react. He couldn’t make his body cooperate and enjoy this last gift Harry was giving him.
And even if things weren't exactly clear and Harry still liked Ginny, he wanted to be with
Draco closed his eyes. There was no escaping this, and even if there was a way, he couldn’t think of it right now. Not with the alcohol on his body, fading but there. Not with the way his heart was beating loudly and his hands were shaking. He needed to tell the truth.
With Draco. Because he liked Draco too.
“What? What’s funny?” Harry glanced at him with his eyebrows furrowed.
“No, you told me a lie,” Harry interrupted him sternly. And damn, Harry Potter for knowing Draco too well. Damn him. “I want to know the truth. You aren’t the kind of guy to kiss someone randomly in the night, and before that, you spent almost half an hour in the bathroom. Something happened. What happened?”
Now he would just need to suck it up and cry about it later.
At first, it was just a touch of lips, and Draco gasped with confusion. Harry parted and looked at Draco’s face, searching for something but Draco couldn’t say anything for he was too confused. He didn’t understand what had happened. Had Harry just kissed him or was it just his wishful thinking?
Draco rolled his eyes and attempted to sound teasing so Harry could let it go, but it didn’t work. Not this time.
Still, maybe it was the drunkness, but Draco didn’t know what Harry meant.
“Why did you do that?” Draco asked, dumbfounded.
“Why did you do that, Draco?” Harry was asking.
And even with the loud music, Draco could listen to Harry’s retreating steps. Going away.
“I’m telling you, Draco,” Harry sighed from his place on the bed, looking love-struck as he stared at the ceiling of his bedroom. “She’s so beautiful that sometimes I can’t even
He should have got used to this by now. But he hasn’t.
She was just too pretty. Prettier than he could ever hope to be.
Why did he have to want the only one he couldn’t have? That was in love with the only one he couldn’t compete with.
Harry was frowning as if asking if he was okay with his eyes. Draco managed a trembling smile that he knew was not
Draco snorted.
“Nothing, Harry. It’s fine.” Draco said softly while beating himself up inside. Why the hell did he say that? He looked at Harry again. “I just felt like doing it tonight. I wanted to kiss a stranger. But then I didn’t anymore and all went to crap.”
Draco looked at Harry from the corner of his eyes and noted how the dimmed lights in the room reflected his beautiful green orbs beneath his round glasses. He was breathtakingly gorgeous with his black hair tousled from dancing and laughing so hard he cried. He was smiling, probably at Ginny, and he looked so happy that Draco had to look away.
The tears that salted their kiss were real, though. And they were liquid happiness.
“From what?”
Harry looked surprised, with his mouth open and all, but now he had tears running down his face as well. His hand on Draco’s hand was clutching tightly as if scared to let go, and his hand that was on Draco’s chin now was cupping his cheek.
“From you,” he whispered.
He walked the rest of the way with his head high and his mask in place.
He wouldn’t, couldn’t, kiss Draco ever when Ginny was around and that was simple as that.
A beat of silence.
We’ve always been more, and now, as I have you here, between my hands, I can only think about how much I want this. How much I want to kiss you and to be with you. I think about you all the time, even when I’m with her, and I-I just never realized it before.”
Draco knew that there was no escape to this since he realized his feelings for Harry, more than a year ago. He knew that, someday, he would need to tell him. And that he would lose Harry when that day came. He felt as if his heart was being ripped apart, already mourning the best friendship, love, and companionship he ever hoped to have. He was already thinking about how hard it would be to look from Harry across the hall at school and not being able to talk to him and complain about Snape. He was already reminiscing the day he had met Harry, the two of them chasing a ball in the park under the summer sky, and forming an easy friendship that only five-year-olds could manage.
P.S. In case you were wondering, when I wrote the first scene with Goldstein, I knew this epilogue would exist. I just really wanted him to get punched  It's literally the only reason I wrote an epilogue. ;)
“Yeah, you like my big cock, love? You like it when I fuck that pretty arse of yours?”
“No? Got it! The Time Traveler’s Wife!” Pansy cried.
“Fuck yes!  That’s right Draco, tell me who this arse belongs to now.” He grunted and reached between them to grip Draco’s leaking cock.
Potter began examining the walls and poking at shelves.
Hermione must have sensed the anger rolling off of him because her voice spiked with panic. “Harry calm down! You’ve not been the same since he left, and you know it. You try to hide it, but we all know you miss him. It’s obvious Harry! And you wouldn’t tell us why or what he did, and so we all assumed it was something terrible and well it was, it really was--”
Harry was becoming overwhelmed. “I have to go Hermione. I’ll talk to you later.”
“If you don’t mind.” Harry looked up from a photo of Draco sandwiched between B.J. and Pans, a kiss on each cheek, at their New Year’s party.
So enjoy this week's installment.  More notes at the end.
“I would,” Draco smirked.“That Slytherin enough for you? They’re at the big table in the corner.”
“I do too. And we’re already off to a better start.”
“Oh...nothing.”
Draco frowned and looked thoughtful. He was about to speak when he was interrupted.
“This goes to the Ministry,” he said as he ripped off the second sheet, folded it into an airplane, lit the kitchen fire with a snap of his fingers, and sent it through the flames.
to be his again.
“Really?”
He has spent at least an hour a day trying not to focus on this arse ever since Malfoy became the divisions Unspeakables liaison. Why now - as he’s about to face a dangerous criminal - is this arse his sole focus...
Draco snorted.
“Ummmm… OH! Hot Tub Time Machine!” shouted Garrett. “There’s butts in hot tubs!”
What a day, Draco thought as he shut the door to his flat behind him. Pans had wanted to come home with him, insisting they just put on
“I couldn’t have. I canceled my-” he pales and looks over at an unsent note, “I guess I forgot. Did he-”
As Draco walked to Martha’s he was mired down in a fog of anxiety and trepidation. He didn’t know what Granger could possibly want from him. If she wanted to murder him for what he’d done to Harry, surely she’d have done it by now. As it stood, he’d complied with Harry’s wishes once he made it clear he didn’t want to be contacted and stayed out of the way of all his friends and known haunts.
“I love you too, Harry.” His breath hitched. “I never thought I’d get to tell you.”
“So what is it? Breakup, death in the family, problems with the parents?”
“I’m not.”
“What did you want to do?”
He grabbed Draco by the collar and slammed him against the wall, his skull smacking against it with a loud crack.
“That’s the best you’ve got?” Draco raised an eyebrow.
Laurie giggled as he pulled Harry into another sloppy kiss. “Alright, I can take a hint. Goodnight gorgeous, I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Draco curled back up and after a moments silence Potter spoke.
“Get up idiot, we’re going to brunch.”
“No. It isn’t. But thank you for understanding.”
Harry opened his mouth to speak but Draco stepped forward and held out his hand.
“Yes it does. Your face is doing it right now.” Potter raised an eyebrow and looked at him challengingly. “What did you really want to be?”
Then he recalled Draco’s flat. How tidy it was, how much it looked like a home. Draco’s flat had photos of friends, area rugs, and that weird trophy thing in the corner. Draco had cords from his game console attached to his TV, he had coats his friends had forgotten slung on his coat hook, a fridge full of ingredients, and actual homemade food that
Harry coughed. “Yeah.”
. Pansy, you better be joining us.”
Harry followed and saw Narcissa Malfoy enter through the doors to what must be the main house of Malfoy Manor, just as Tilly deposited a full service on the table in front of him.
“Lila, you got this?” He called.
“Damn, you’re good.”
“Yes, I’m sure who ever it is will be blinded by your beauty and run for the hills. Answer the fucking door. I have a headache.”
“Yeah boss, go sit with your gorgeous boyfriend.I’ll send up the bat signal if we need you.”
“I’M GAY!” he shouted, so loudly he could hear an approaching house-elf trip and drop a tray.
Harry stumbled and looked both angry and hurt. “Then why don't you fuck B.J.?”
“No, there was no ticket, Cy said you were handling it.”
“Hey! You can’t just--”
“Draco, this is all so unhealthy! No wonder your self-worth is down the shitter, there was literally only one bright spot in your life.”
They sat in silence for a moment, Harry still mesmerised  by Draco’s home, till Draco finally said, “This isn’t a trap is it? You aren’t going to call the aurors are you?” Draco smirked “Because B.J. will testify that you came here first.”
“God, that had to have been the worst meal we’ve ever been served here,” Draco said as he flopped onto his cot. “Do you think they’re trying to test us? See who can survive the best on either food poisoning or starvation?”
How dare he! This man had taken Draco from him, had flirted with him, had
“Need a hand there mate?” Draco looked up into playful grey-blue eyes.
He flipped the bacon, and it erupted in a shower of sizzling oil as Draco yelped. “If that muggle on the telly can do it, I can do it. It’s not very different from potions in some ways, it’s just new, that’s all.” He looked determined to master this.
Pansy spoke to the waitress while Draco looked around at all the happy carefree people eating and laughing as if today
“Oh.”
“Yep.” Draco said as he took another sip from his drink, consolidated the remaining appetizers onto one plate and cleared the unnecessary dishes.
They continued down the street, slowly beginning to hear the chatter and the rumble of the club ahead. As they made their way inside, Harry immediately began to scan the room for his friends. The second he spotted them, he took off like a shot, leaving Draco alone, presumably to go and fetch them some drinks like an errand boy, Draco thought bitterly. He watched as Potter rushed into the throng and was immediately leapt upon by Lee Jordan. Literally leapt upon. Lee jumped at him, wrapped his arms and legs around Harry and squealed in excitement. Harry laughed good naturedly and set him down.
“Jesus Christ!” B.J. exclaimed. “Were you dropped on the head as a child?
It had been several days since Dennis had brought the new reports on Oz and Draco had barely seen Harry. Harry was usually so dedicated, and Draco had to admit, he was beginning to miss having him around. Maybe he was just imagining it, but it actually seemed like maybe Harry was interested in...No, even if Draco did fancy him, there was no way it was reciprocated. He needed to focus on Oz. In Harry’s absence he’d begun to piece some things together. Oz had been obliviating all of his contacts to keep his identity secure, but Draco had broken through the spellwork and discovered a treasure trove of information.
This all looked different than he remembered it, Harry thought. Draco was lying down on the bed with his legs spread wide, and he saw himself crawling on top of him. He saw himself reaching for lube and asking if he could put himself inside. He saw Draco nodding yes. Once he was in and moving, he watched Draco’s legs wrap around Harry’s waist, his hand clutching his back, the other tangled in his hair and his face buried in Harry’s neck and he was whimpering as Harry took him. “Yes, please, please, take me, I want you, fuck I want you.”
“Fine, if that’s how you feel, then great. Enjoy bunking with Crief, It looks like Anderson is your new partner. Try not to get hexed. He tends to panic and abandon his partner when he gets overwhelmed. Oh… wait, never mind. I’m sure you’ll get along perfectly. Goodbye Draco.”
“Hey, wait a second! That was MY beer!”
------------
“Wait.” Harry pushed him back, “You didn’t smoke.” It wasn’t a question, but Harry was surprised.
“Earned what?“ He turned on the kettle, “I ought to charge you rent for the nights you spend kipped on my couch. Not to mention, these are
Hermione looked as if she might cry. “Oh, Harry! I’m so sorry, but that day at the restaurant when he saw you, the look on his face when you left... and then he charged right past me, didn’t even see me, it was like he couldn’t see anything but you. He looked different Harry, and I saw his friends and they seemed like nice normal people, they seemed so concerned for him. I’d never seen anyone look at Draco that way, and then Pansy recognized me. I think she thought we were there to… I dunno...come after him or something. That other guy, he calmed her down, but he seemed worried. The way they talked about him...I had to know. So I asked him to meet me.”
“Draco, look at yourself. You have no friends, no home, you can barely go outside in your world without being harassed. You have no understanding of how my world works, so you can’t even escape. You have a menial job you hate that is
Goldstein looked disappointed but polite, “Oh? Well, that’s a shame but I should have known, gorgeous thing like you. We never seem to meet at the right time. Maybe someday, if that doesn’t work out. You’ll have to introduce me sometime.”
“Shhh,” Pansy said, smiling and pushing Patrick’s plate closer to him. “Just eat your waffles, love.”
Harry watched numbly as this kind man picked him up, checked his injuries, brought him home.
“MALFOY! Shut it!”
“I like your playroom,” Harry smiled as his voice dipped low. “I’ve always wanted to try one of those swings.”  He pulled Draco closer as he leaned in to whisper in the soft shell of his ear. “ Would you like to show me how it works?”
when they invade my flat and I’m so indifferent to the game, I spend the afternoon making them food.”
“Sorry, it was just a bit hot in there. I needed a break.” Draco grinned, ”But I’ll tell you what, if you hate the smell so much, when we get back to your flat, we can hop in the shower and you can scrub me clean.”
Harry reappeared, eying Draco and his scotch, looking concerned.
“Okay, simmer down, you two,” Draco said as, with a flick of his wrist, he flipped the omelette in his pan.
“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have…”
He felt a little guilty not bringing Harry in on it, but it wasn’t his fault Harry wasn’t around. Besides, he was going to get this promotion if it was the last thing he did. In the past week he’d been doing some undercover work disguised as a potential buyer. He’d managed to use his old knowledge of the criminal underworld to make connections with the right people, and this morning he’d gotten a note that read, “
“But what, mother?” Draco was a bit incredulous.
“Oh fuck!” Draco’s hands flew to his mouth. “I’m sorry, forget I said that, I should check on Lila—“
Harry took it. “I’m Harry, Harry Potter.”
------------
I take full responsibility for that. He didn’t know I had a boyfriend, he was just on the pull, but he cleaned me up got us a cab and brought me to Pans. He could have left me half-naked and bleeding in the street. Oh! By the way I spent a couple months sleeping in her bed, I see her naked constantly! B.J. sleeps here a couple nights a week because we’re friends and we enjoy each others company. Intimacy between people you love doesn’t equate a sexual partnership, you judgemental prat. I’ve learned a lot about love in the past year. B.J. and Pansy loved me enough to notice how broken I was, how hurt and unhealthy and fucked up I was. It only took him one day to notice what you ignored for six months. I didn’t think you fucking cared. I thought I was a pretty toy to you.”

“Fine.”
Draco stares in horror until his fight or flight instinct kicks in and he turns to flee.
“Draco—”
“Yeah, I live just a few blocks away actually,” Harry said, looking a little flustered by the sudden whirlwind of attention.
been hit by a train. Then he remembered why, and he felt like letting someone actually do it. Merlin, what the fuck was he supposed to do now? He had thrown away the only thing he had left. What was the point anymore?
“That’s right baby, you want ME,” Harry said, punctuating the last word with a hard deep thrust.
“Because Cylan, tragically, I no longer have servants to do my bidding.”
“Thanks, Seema.” He smiled weakly, put it in his back pocket and proceeded to the kitchen. “Hey Lila, looks like you got my mess cleaned up. Sorry about that,” he said as he washed his hands and tied his apron on.
“Sounds like you fucked up pretty bad there mate.” He could hear the gentle smile in B.J.’s voice.
“Stop grinning to yourself like an idiot. People will begin to take you for a Hufflepuff, darling” Pansy said as she and Blaise entered.
“Really Hermione, I’ve just been busy!”
Harry continued to stare at Draco, not sure what he meant.
“A date type thing?”
“Thanks.”
“I didn’t forget, I left it up to Cy.”
“Draco?” he whispered, “Are you awake?”
It was just a simple cloth. Thick cotton with tiny ducks wearing clown noses. It was such a stupid pattern, but seeing that cloth slung over his partners shoulder made him feel like he finally had a home.
From this angle, from the outside, Harry could see sadness on Draco’s face. He watched Draco reach up and pull him down into a tender, sweet kiss. He pulled back and kissed Harry’s cheek, reaching his hand down to his trousers. “That sounds really nice, Harry.” Draco had unbuttoned his trousers and pulled his cock out, stroking him gently before placing a sweet, chaste kiss on the glistening tip. “That sounds really good.” He then leaned down again, lapping at the precome and slowly swirling his tongue around the head. Harry’s eyes rolled to the back of his head as Draco swallowed him down.
“Hey, are you ok? I waved at you from the door and called to tell you the check was paid, but I guess you didn’t hear me.”
“I know,” B.J. said with a nod. “He still loves you, the idiot. He loves you enough to relive those painful memories because he is still wracked with guilt about what he did to you and he thinks he owes you.  But then you just fuck off and leave without a word to him. Is that how you show love mate, because you suck at it. But now that you’ve spilled your guts to me, I have to ask again -- what’s the fucking plan here? Are you just going to disappear forever?”
“Yes sir.”
“Are we certain bacon isn’t a magical food?”
“Now, don’t you wish we’d played charades?” Garrett looked smug.
“I’ll have to take a blood sample and analyze it to make an antidote but you’re correct, he is getting worse. It’s a good thing he was able to contact the ministry. Even if it was through the D.O.L.T.”
Draco looked up at him, “Oh...uh...yeah...I’m fine.” He looked back at Harry who was staring at Cy’s hand on Draco with wary, questioning eyes.
you want us to work together on this assignment?”
“Behind the times!” Pansy exclaimed.
“Fuck you, you obnoxious arsehole! I have no idea why I thought I might actually—”
Draco pitched his voice even lower “Pans, he’s a
“It's why I called you in.”
Draco stared, then swung the door open to allow him to enter. “I must be special. They sent the great ‘Harry Potter’  to make sure  my plumbing was basilisk free.”
Harry’s voice grew quieter and he looked away, “And then, that night walking from the restaurant, you kissed me. And do you know what I thought?” Harry laughed mirthlessly and Draco’s heart ached, “I thought yes, there it is. There he is. I took him to dinner, and it was okay, and I was so nervous, but it was still perfect. And when you kissed me, it took my breath away. It was nothing like it had ever been before. You were bright, and bold and I felt like I was on fire. I had finally broken through. I thought, I have all of him now; he wants me, and he’s all mine. I looked you in the eye and you looked so desperate and beautiful, and I thought, finally, he’s all with me. I felt like I’d won the lottery. Little did I know that I should have been careful what I wished for.”

“As an official of the Ministry.”
He rushed to set everything down, turn off the burner and mute the telly, feeling much more composed.
“Honestly, Hermione?Yes, everything's fine, better than fine.. But, er...I need a favour.”
“NO, I'm not wearing that stupid thing, Harry!"
“I just wanted to talk to you Harry. Please, I—”
“Because Cy, I have to work in the morning and I don’t want to be exhausted. Funny thing about customers, they tend to complain when you’re so exhausted you serve them a broken hollandaise and an over cooked poached egg on their eggs benedict. I’d think you’d want me in top shape, it affects your tips after all.” He smirked and sipped his beer, “I’ll be there in a minute. Pick teams without me, I’m just gonna wash this up and put the finishing touches on dessert.”
The heat of B.J. against his back, the feeling of his balls slapping against him, the fullness inside, the sensation of two men just taking pleasure from each other. No expectations, no history, no bullshit. Just this. This bliss. Just for now. He moaned. He was pushing back, impaling himself on B.J.’s thick, hard cock.
“Oh my darling.“ She held him on his back and rubbed his tummy. “Grandma’s here.” She looked up at them, eyes bright, “It’s just a touch of colic, Bill had it too.”
“No worries, Chef. Is everything okay? We’re almost at the end of bruch service if you want to skive off a little early.”
Harry gasped as Laurie broke the kiss. “Ok. Good,” he said, nervously running his fingers through his hair. “That’s good then.” Harry turned to Draco who had repositioned himself against the wall on his cot, knees up and face into his book. “I guess I’ll see you later Draco.”
“Honestly, Potter, this is ridiculous.”

you!” Anthony Goldstein said as he approached, pulling Harry in for a firm hug and smiling mischievously, “My...the years since the war have been good to you. I haven’t seen you in ages...Are you living in London?”
Harry rubbed the back of his neck. He could not believe the words that were about to come out of his mouth. “Can we...er...can we go shopping?”
The day after that brunch a year ago, B.J. had set to work on what he called Draco’s “normal human education". First, they needed to go to Diagon to get a Muggle birth certificate, passport and other documentation. He had considered changing his legal Muggle name to Black in order to make him more difficult to find, but Pansy had quickly squashed that idea, saying that that was tantamount to hiding. This was about resurrecting Draco Malfoy in all his glory, not burying him.
“Hey, I know you were upset you forgot to book the lane—”
“Fuck Harry, do you have any idea, any idea at all, what I want to do to you?”
When Harry began to wake, Draco laid back down, pretending to be just rousing himself.
and saw something he wanted, that he had done so for nearly a year without growing tired of him.
“Yes please Tilly, thank you.”
“Draco, I can see that you are, so if you wouldn’t mind, please will you tell me what happened? All I know is that one day Harry was over the moon, something about going to dinner, and the next he had locked himself in his flat and wouldn’t come out. He was like that for weeks. Nobody could get through to him. Hell, nobody could even get through the wards. Then, about a month later, he came out, walked right into the Burrow for Sunday supper one night and acted as if nothing had happened. If anyone asked he would ignore the question and either move on or leave the room.”
“Don’t want to,” Harry said, continuing his ministrations.
Then he realised he had a pan of butter melting on the stove, eggs in one hand, sausage in the other and the soundtrack to Mario Kart blaring from his television.
“Yeah I do.. It’s just that…”
“Draco, please sit down. I think we need to talk.”
Potter looked at his paperwork and frowned. “Actually, no.”
“Oh, well spotted Potter,” said Draco, mask of sarcastic indifference firmly in place as he sat on his bed back leaned against the wall. “What tipped you off? The posted room assignments? Our names on the door? Or the fact that I am currently sitting in the bunk opposite yours in this little hellhole we now get to call home?”
Draco looked down and realised Harry was holding out a pensieve.
“You’re really lucky,” Harry said, turning to Draco.
Harry nodded. Another silence ensued before Draco said, “You look really good.”
To which Draco had replied, “It’s so awful, there isn't even a way to explain what's so awful about it!”
He looked around at his perfectly appointed flat. He liked it here. It was the first place that was ever all his own. Everything in it was his. No stuffy elegant wardrobes and tasteful antique aubussons. No, here he had his plush comfortable sofa, stylish and functional end tables, the biggest damn TV he could find so he could watch Gordon Ramsey in style, and a wide open space he could fill with people. Everything here was here because of choices

Harry looked up with bright eyes, amazed that this was happening. “No.” He shook his head earnestly. “I’ll be there.”
“You have GOT to be kidding me! You’re dating this piece of shit again? I’d heard you’d finally gotten some sense and chucked him!”
“How ‘bout we just worry about right now?”
Their attention was drawn toward the door by a loud burst of laughter as Lee and Patrick entered, clearly on about something as they approached.
“Shhhhh,” Draco smiled, “You’re rambling like an idiot.”
Draco chuckled and took another inhale. “Yeah, well I feel damned most of the time.”
Draco remained steadfastly motionless, and Harry sighed. “Ok. Goodnight anyway, then.”
Harry flinched.
“Fine.” Draco threw himself onto his mattress, punched at his pillow, and curled onto his side, “But no promises if it turns out you snore.”
Anthony looked alarmed but turned to Neville. “Nev, you know I’m right, don’t you? I mean, he’s beneath us! He doesn’t deserve to show his face anywhere near us. We earned the right to be rid of people like him. We fought for that!”
“I always thought maybe...but it doesn’t matter to me. As long as he’s a good person.”
“No!” Draco had shouted. “You know what, fine! If this is your wagon wheel coffee table and it makes you happy, we can keep it. But I will not be writing my name in my books so we can figure out whose is whose in a break-up, because you aren’t ever allowed to move out!”
Harry entered their room, clearly just back from the showers and sheepishly knocked on the door frame as he came in, “Draco?”
help with that. For right now anyway.” And he kissed Draco gently, a promise of something good.
“Well, you're getting better at antidotes, and if they keep serving meals like that, Merlin knows you’ll need them.” Draco rolled over and looked at Harry. “So, whose turn is it to pick the card game for the night?”
“Oh Blaise! Don’t be a baby, we’re here to celebrate the grand occasion that is my birth, give it a shot. It’s fun.” Draco smiled.
“I’m going to kill you.” Draco said once he opened the box.
B.J. stepped out and Harry closed the door behind him. He could hardly believe it. He was being given a second chance. Maybe he could make this work, maybe they could do this.
“The taste lingers…” Draco tossed the box and its contents into the wastebasket and grumbly went in search of a ministry canteen sandwich.
(See the end of the chapter for
When Harry was fully sheathed inside him, he tilted Draco’s chin up to look him in the eye once more. He was overwhelmed by the feeling of Draco underneath him, the look in Draco’s eyes, the knowledge that he was inside the man he’d loved and wanted for so long. He couldn’t hold back any longer. “Draco.” The man beneath him cocked his head and smiled at him with an expression of pure bliss and contentment.
