He cleared his throat and shook his head, trying to play if off as if he was just incredibly annoyed by his husband’s antics. He hoped that Daphne hadn’t seen their secret interactions, though by the concerned look she was throwing their way, this didn’t seem to happen.
With a nod they bid goodbye and Draco went to his room, actually feeling slightly tired. Maybe it was the alcohol, who knew. He yawned and went to change his clothes again. By the time he was done, he decided to look into his ward’s room again.
Harry felt lucky, that they had the discussion with the couple’s therapist this morning. If they hadn’t had that, he would have freaked out. They hadn’t been ready for children before this afternoon.  Thank goodness, they had overcome that problem by talking it out.
Draco was about to tell everyone to go home, when Granger pulled Weasley back and glared at him. “Ron, what are you doing? Malfoy’s right; Harry doesn’t know us! What you’re doing is probably scaring him!”
One if the drawers opened and almost punched Harry in the stomach. Harry jumped back just in time and snorted, while Teddy laughed loudly. “Thank you. I’m sorry for being so disorganized. I know you like Draco or Teddy more.”
“How do you know when the ball is?” Draco wondered and found the answer then quickly by himself. “Mother invited you, didn’t she?”
Oh and Remus wrote and invited all of us over to his new house, apparently it’s almost finished. I’m helping him turning the backyard into a child friendly environment on Friday, if you’d like to come as well.
Draco sighed and leaned back in the arm chair. “That’s a hell of a good question, Pansy. I don’t know. I honestly have no idea what’s going on and how I can improve anything or…”
“Well, since your former DADA professor quit, Professor McGonagall asked me to come back for the end of the year to make sure everyone has their N.E.W.T and O.W.L levels. After the summer I will start my permanent teaching position.” Remus grinned.
Rolling his eyes, Ron took his book again and rubbed his forehead. Hermione was almost instantly engrossed into her book as well. Harry cleared his throat and then turned to her.
Granger agreed. “In Defense, Parkinson couldn’t stop talking about him. Actually, neither could Zabini or Nott. I truly believe that they would do anything to help Harry getting older again.”
She wasn’t ready for his big plan then. Albus sighed. “It’s not what they see, you know Minerva. They won’t see him as a child, but as a weapon. I’m just talking with what they would think of that.”
After breakfast, they all spent a few hours by the lake, talking, planning eating, studying. Basically doing everything together while doing nothing a hundred percent. They were just enjoying the rather warm weather and the feast, benefitting from their busy study season not yet being here entirely.
I feel obligated to tell you that I am pausing this story. My country has another very hard Corona wave and this time it looks like I'm losing my job, so I need to concentrate on job hunting (like a thousand other people in my area probably). I don't know when I'm continuing, but I can't think about a story, when I'm having real life problems.
“Breakfast, come on, guys!” Draco called out and walked towards the door, smirking. They were already a little late, since they had actually talked about quite a lot of things and Draco had only stood there listening to their discussions.
There were some questions in Draco’s mind right now: Why was Severus so friendly to baby Potter? Why was Potter absolutely not fazed by being close to someone like him? His godfather had tormented him for the better part of his life. Once again, he was thinking about how after the Battle of Hogwarts, these two seemed to be so close. Closer somehow than he had been to Severus himself. It hurt really badly and made Draco hate Harry even more.
Draco frowned. “You haven’t even tried today, bear. Why do you think you can’t sleep?” He watched as Harry carefully placed the quill in the ink jar and turned to look at him. All his actions made Draco worry immensely. There must be some kind of memory that was torturing his ward.
Draco nodded. “Don’t worry, I would have probably reacted the same if any of my friends were babies in your custody.”
“Blaise, we need another Cappuccino and a pork sandwich” Harry called over from the registry. He caught the Italian rolling his eyes over both orders, but he quickly made them and didn’t let the customer see his enthusiasm.
When Harry stood in front of Pansy, the Slytherin looked at him very earnest. “Potter, I hope you accept my deepest apology.”
Millicent walked closer just in time to hear Pansy and smirked, when she sat down beside her friend and raised her eyebrows. “Potter’s good? Good at what? Being the savior?”
Well, the one that suddenly attracted all his attention was a flower with furry white petals and a yellow core. It looked so wild and strong that Draco smiled and nodded. He carefully picked the flower and assistant led him back into the normal room.
Well, Harry seemed to be fine after that, even though he was a little quieter during lunch. He did have a lot of fun goofing around with Theo and Blaise afterwards in their secret garden. And it took quite some convincing for Draco to get his ward for a day (or half a day) outside Hogwarts. But he really wanted to do this. He wanted to buy some clothes for his ward. Especially the really soft woollen jumper he had gotten when he was a child.
“If he's not too tired, he can do quite a lot.” Draco explained, realizing that he did sound like a very proud father, but he didn't care. Caellum was such a fast learner and he wanted to do everything that Lily already could. And well, Lily was a very patient teacher, helping him with everything. Their dynamic was so cute and sweet that sometimes Draco just liked to watch their children.
“You know how I feel about potions being given without permission. About losing control of your body. This whole life is about being political.” He shrugged his shoulders. “If she can’t handle the power of all the knowledge an Unspeakable has, she should be forced to step back.”
Harry motioned him to continue talking, while he placed a cup on the table and filled it with the tea, before he sat down and filled another cup as well. Nicolai sighed and walked in to sit down in one of the empty chairs.
Harry was listening with wide eyes and he nodded. “I want to be able to do that! I can’t wait!” He clapped his hands and Eric chuckled. Alamar smirked as well and he placed their English breakfast onto the table.
“Hello, Molly, how are you doing?” he asked, turning to her and sitting down on an armchair now as well.
“Then again” Theodore started speaking and grinned at Neville. “Most men voted to give women the voting power, because they said they already told the men what and who to vote for, it would only make it easier for them to be able to vote themselves.”
There was a wall. A see-through, hear-through wall out of thick air, probably created by him when he was in panic, standing between him, holding Potter, and the Gryffindors (and Ravenclaw). However, they were in the Room of Requirement, so it could have been the room as well.
Tilting his head lightly, Harry grew a loop-sided smirk and jumped forward. He grabbed Draco into a hug and pulled him closer. Draco hummed and threw his arms around Harry’s neck. “You’re an idiot.”
Draco was unable to speak and almost started ugly crying. Luckily, Pansy had caught wind of that and quickly escorted him to her own room, where he slumped down in a chair. He pushed his hair out of his face and stared at Pansy, unable to say something. It seemed as if she was also unable to say something, as she simply smiled.
“Pans and Neville are having another date today at three! Are you willing to follow them around?” he asked grinning.
“Well, I figured, you may be the person to ask.” Harry shrugged his shoulders. “I mean, I don’t have that much life experience. So… When do you know you’re in love?”
“Well, those were old newspapers, weren’t they? Ronald Weasley told us a few hours ago that he left for Australia a week ago! I need to you stop running around Scotland without being able to find Potter. The hearing is in two weeks!”
“To be honest” Harry started and sighed. Draco looked at him in horror, though Harry wasn’t going to reveal anything that had happened between the two of them. If there hadn’t been all eyes on him, he would have definitely winked at him. “I went back to bed. I realized I was too tired for breakfast, went back to bed and when I got up about twenty minutes later, I went to take a shower.”
“Maybe she’s already gotten the scary mother-in-law-effect down to a t, so now she doesn’t need to overdo it?” Draco asked and shook his head. He then grinned at Harry. “And by the way, I told her I wasn’t going to do something like that.”
Draco turned to make sure he was wearing clothes (which he was) and then stepped aside so they could get a better look.
It was clear that Charlie was thinking, as she covered her mouth with two fingers, looking at a picture of dancing people in a Moroccan street. Finally, she turned to them and smiled. “Do you still want to try and do it?”
“Ravo. The penguin.” Harry turned to parchment, so Draco could see it. There were two handwritings visible, his own neat and carefully placed one and then Harry’s child handwriting.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea, Dean! We haven’t walked around here in ages. What if we get lost?” Seamus asked and grinned when his husband glared at him.
Granger than turned to the two Slytherins. “I don’t know that much of when he was younger. I know that he had needed to cook for his family” Granger stopped and shook her head. “Or rather
Draco sighed. Well, if anyone would question the Ministry, it was him. He had been one of their projects. Most Slytherins, who had fought on the wrong side of the war, had suddenly started to work for the Ministry. So called ‘restorations’. Blaise Zabini had started in Magical Accidents as Trainee Auror. Pansy Parkinson worked as a Secretary to the Head Auror and she hated her job. And he? Draco Malfoy – the Auror. People had been writing letters into the Ministry as soon as it was out, but they had insisted on keeping Draco.
“I am invincible!” he called out, throwing both hands as high into the air as he could, when Remus actually tackled him and threw him to the ground. Teddy was now laughing loudly, while Harry tried to get away from Remus.
These seemed to be the secret words, as Hermione beamed at the current headmistress as she walked towards her. Harry nodded at Minerva. ‘Thank you’ he mouthed, which made her nod at him as she turned and walked back up towards the castle with Hermione in tow.
Despite everything that had happened today, Draco burst out laughing and shook his head. “You were one of the idiot trio before, Harry! Don’t you remember? The Gryffindory oh so holy Golden Trio?”
Harry snorted. “You literally told me yesterday that you can’t tell which parts in your brains are supposed to be secrets and which are okay to tell other people! That doesn’t sound very promising.”
What he had told Malfoy was only half true: He didn’t care what the public thought of him, yes. However, the people in his job were important to him. The problem wasn’t that he was gay – it was that he was in fact a little obsessed with Malfoy. And while he thought he had all of this more under control than during his Hogwarts years… hearing Nott saying that out loud broke his pride and composure a little.
Draco stopped dead in his track, narrowing his eyes. It looked… actually really good! If he had a little longer hair, you could actually style it differently and make some really nice looked with his hair.
Before he could think even more about it, they entered Gringott’s through the side doors especially built for creatures. No wizard or witch has ever seen it and most of the time, if they had been turned into a creature, they wouldn’t say a thing. Not with this Ministry.
He motioned their guests to sit down and gave everyone a glass of their ice tea. Harry sat down next to him and Lily climbed on his lap as soon as Harry had sat down, grinning at her dad. Draco gave his husband a glass and leaned back into his hug, while Lily started telling a story about their last holiday in France. Ron and Hermione listened carefully and Severus even asked for a few more details, while Harry put his arm around Draco's shoulder's pulling him closer as well.
Pansy had by now joined them under the tree as well, putting an arm around Draco. “Face it darling, Harry’s got both of you outsmarted. We all know that neither of you wants to go up that tree.”
“I doubt that” Pansy smirked and without any other words, she turned around and walked to their secret spot, most likely telling their friends that he won’t be joining them that evening. Or rather night.
Pansy had not removed her arm around Harry’s shoulders and she was now squeezing it again. “Go back a second there, darling. Did you say… did you say the Dark Lord made a Horcrux?” she asked, eyes wide as she seemed to try and understand what was happening.
Harry opened his mouth to say something, when Draco caught his lips for another kiss. And then two and three. Harry placed his arms around his neck for one last kiss, before he really needed to go to McGonagall and get Padfoot.
Albus shrugged his shoulders. “I’ve got some friends, they’ll look into it. I will tell some Aurors I trust as well. I’m sure they’ll figure it out.” For a second, Albus pondered over removing this memory from Minerva’s mind. However, she was a rather strong witch and would have clearly figured out that something was missing. “Don’t worry, Minerva. I’m sure he’ll resurface again and I’ll take him under my wing as soon as he does.”
“Nothing is going on between me and Malfoy, stop asking. Why is everyone so… annoying?!” He looked at Draco, rolling his eyes openly again and turned back to Hannah. “So, are we going to play a game now, or what?!”
Chuckling, Draco shook his head. “I wish.” He grinned at Harry’s outraged expression. “No, I’m saying it, because it’s important to me that you know you have friends who care about you.”
“Okay.” Harry nodded. He now had a name and people who cared about him. His life could only get better from here, right? At least that was what he hoped for, when he hushed into his own garden and presented himself in front of the patio door where Aunt Petunia let him in and shooed him to the shower with the order not to use too much water. Yes, life could only go up from here.
“I’ve already got one.” Smiling, his boyfriend softly pushed Draco’s hair behind his ear. “When I was talking to your dad after I got out of the Hospital Wing when I turned eighteen, I asked him to give me information for a Mind Healer.”
Harry laughed and walked to the man who had now crossed his arms over his chest. Draco saw him walking closer and backed up. “No! Do not even think of hugging me or something. I’m mad at you!”
Severus had stayed for about half an hour, where Potter had started to show him a lot of different things he had gotten and then played with him.
Harry was surprised that his teacher had figured out this thing so early on, while their friends had mostly been in the dark. Maybe it was just because she took a little interest in their lives.
“You walked off with some random person. That is not how it works. So I have a few fire calls and luckily there’s still one family that…”
“Oh, nothing really. I travelled around the world a little, started working in a few Muggle places and… ended up just being happy with my life like that.”
Draco chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. “Jason got the news and we went to talk to the Minister. Actually” he hesitated and looked at the piano keys. “He wasn’t in his office, so went down to the holding cells to maybe find you and figure out what happened.”
“Are you sure Harry wanted to go to the lake?” Theodore asked and looked around. They walked closer to the edge of the lake, where you could see most of the land.
Inside the Great Hall was a single table set up. It reminded Harry of the Christmases he had spent there with the other students and professors who stayed here as well.
Severus huffed and shook his head. “You should never pretend to be something you’re not just so people like you.”
“Finally!” he groaned and cleaned his robes from any dust. Ron followed out of the basement and took off the Auror robe and shook it out.
Well, the kitchen was still almost fully furnished. In actuality, it had even more things on the table. Alamar pushed the bow and arrows aside and let the one-pot-pasta float onto the table. Eric already sat there, looking at the plan they had made in the last five weeks.
“Muggle London.” She winked at him, knowing exactly that none of their parents would have approved of their choices.
Snow fell down on them as if it had just fallen from the roof top and they all stood there frozen, trying to figure out what had happened right now. Potter was snickering and Draco chuckled, grabbing his ward and running inside, where they were definitely not going to cast the same spell on him – at least that was what he hoped. It was worth though, seeing his ward laugh so loudly, after seeming so scared.
“It’s absolutely normal, bear. And you know what? You don’t have to cook for us, because of the house elves, you saw them right?”
Nodding weakly, Draco quickly brushed a tear out of his face. “I have no idea what just happened. I mean, a few months ago I actively hated him.” He chuckled and shook his head. “And now I’m a mess over something he said.”
Harry was clearly unsure when he grabbed his quill. He scratched his forehead and turned to Draco. “In the forest, Ravo can’t find his brothers anymore.”
Once he looked at his ward, Draco decided to chance it. “We would like to see your owls.” If Harry would rather see cats or any other animal, he could always say so. But owls were quite important in their daily lives.
In his free time between the end of the war and Hogwarts starting, you could have found Draco in all the jazz clubs, looking at the pianist who was somehow the leader of the band and the most important player. He had always believed that one day... one day, he would be part of their world and...
“You’re welcome. Just keep on laughing about my failure, really. It doesn’t hurt at all.” Blaise rolled his eyes.
“Hermione needs to stop just doing things she reads about” Draco said and shook his head. He looked tired, most likely the stress of what Harry was going through messing with his mind.
“Oh, I know why he doesn’t want to come in here. It’s too much Muggle stuff. But he has to get this stupid idea out of his head and just… accept that I am his son!”
good. Finally, after Harry had needed to get some air, he calmed down enough to tell Draco what had been going on.
Smirking, Harry nodded and turned to Malfoy, realizing that they were a little too close, he pretended to be looking at pictured again and walked back a few steps. “True” he finally said and looked back at his former school nemesis. “But some people are afraid something could happen with real fire and so they put fairy lights into the tree.”
I'm going to be out of town for a few days and I looked through my Drarry ideas and decided to work on this story again, before I'm leaving. So another chapter was born.
Obviously, he didn’t die. Draco had already read three ‘come get me, death’-messages. It was weird to read these, knowing that Harry had always made it. He also questioned whether or not he actually wanted to die. Whenever he was writing things down and it was a good day, it looked as if Harry was genuinely trying to figure out how to get rid of this curse.
Draco nodded and smiled. Harry turned to look at him and chuckled. Before he could say something however, Millicent was the one speak up first.
Rolling his eyes, Draco groaned. “Fine. But next time, I won’t do anything. I can’t always be the one to go out of my comfort zone for him.”
He smirked and looked up at Harry. His boyfriend looked at him with so soft eyes that Draco was almost about to tear up. This was it. This moment was everything he had ever wanted. He had a family that cared about him – Severus. His friends were amazing and he had the man who pretty much turned out to be the love of his life by his side.
“You’re also not leaving me another option but to restrict your wand use for another year” King finished his speech.
Draco was quiet for a while, but sensing King’s eagerness to finally end this uncomfortable call, he simply answered with: “Thank you very much for the opportunity, Sir.” He would have liked to add a ‘Can I think about it’ at the end, but wisely chose to bid goodbye instead.
I am slightly curious: Are you thinking about giving up on Harry already? It has only been five weeks and I thought you were happy to have him around? Even though I didn’t stay around you two for all too long, I did see some positive energy there – from both sides. Harry really seems to like being around you and I thought you did too.
“Oh yes. They wrote a letter to let me know that should I be interested in joining them, I was more than welcome to do so. But I don’t know. I think I’ll take a year off.” Neville shrugged.
Draco narrowed his eyes and shook his head, before snorting. “I wasn’t talking about that! What I mean is… Do you think my hair will change? I like my blond hair and I know how to style it.” And also, there was a small bluish strain of hair left over from when Harry had changed his hair by accident. He would have liked to keep that for as long as possible.
His mother shrugged her shoulders. “Oh Dragon, I’ve always wanted to open up the Malfoy Manor to the public again. When Harry was here last time, we brainstormed about the best way to do so. And we found that a fun evening was certainly the way to show everyone that we’re doing fine.”
“I’m sure.” Harry nodded. She copied his actions and seemed to come to the same conclusion. When he turned to look at Draco, he walked closer as well. Draco smiled softly at Harry, which made him return the smile. “I for one can say that I’m willing to try with the man I love” he added and Draco felt so many emotions rising that he had no ideas how to control them. He was tearing up and cleared his throat, walking over faster to Harry and hugging him.
Harry almost spoke about ‘Draco being a prick’, though swallowed that comment and grinned at his best friend. Neville seemed to have read his mind as he smirked quickly, before he too looked at Ron.
Shaking his head, Draco wasn’t even going to laugh at this kind of ridiculous question. “Huh? What, no… I want to be on the good side.”
When Alamar snuck up the stairs, he passed a lot of old looking portraits of witches and wizards. Stopping in front of one that vaguely reminded him of a former head teacher in Hogwarts, he sighed softly. For their own safety, he secretly placed a reversed notice-me-not spell over all the portraits in the house for the time being. Like that, they could walk around the house and the portraits wouldn’t even realise anyone was in here.
Harry frowned and turned to Draco, intending on asking what he had asked Luna to draw, when he found his boyfriend on his knees. “Harry James Potter, you make me the happiest person on this world. You never want anything from me and you helped me through all my hardships. And you never abandoned me even though I’m sure it would have been easier sometimes.”
So, he pulled Potter onto his lap and got hold of his wand without taking it out of his sleeve. “Should we shower them with a little snow, bear? What do you think? Wet, cold snow?”
“Anyway, you guys don’t have to worry. I won’t tell anyone you’ve been here and decided to settle down in Russia for a while” Kira smirked and turned to Eric. “And I won’t tell mother I’ve seen you the next time I go fight for our country.
Their class mates truly didn’t make sense sometimes. Harry rubbed his forehead, pretending to keep the nonexistent tears at bay and cleared his throat when he heard the announcement that the game would start in ten minutes.
He stepped forward, eyes almost glowing and accusingly held up his index finger. “You bloody fucking idiot! Do you really think you can do something so stupid and get away with it? Harry is the best thing that’s ever happened to you, you idiotic…” he failed to come up with a possible word and just angrily scoffed.
“World domination” Draco answered quickly and smirked. “Just teaching our classmates a lesson in toying with people’s relationships.”
Wait! Did the Headmistress know about what they did? He had been talking to Hermione and Weasley a little too loudly. It was Hogsmeade week-end; he had just assumed everyone was gone. And he had no idea how long she had been standing there... Oh she definitely knew something! However, she wasn't telling. What was that supposed to mean?
When lunch came around, he walked back into the village, stopped by Daisy to get something to eat and entered the pub. There was another guy standing in front of the bar, smiling at a clearly unhappy Potter. The black haired wizard had his arms crossed over his chest.
Pansy gestured at the circles he had walked. “If you continue that, you might be so deep into the earth that you’ll find the lake. Please close your door though; I don’t want our Common Room drowned, because you can’t keep your thoughts
Eric looked over to him with a smirk on his lips. “Because it has a fairy godmother in it? Do you want to make me angry?” He leaned over Harry, who giggled under the blanket. He didn’t even have time to respond as Eric started to tickle him and rolling him into a burrito with his blanket so Harry had no way to escape him. Not that Harry seemed to care as he laughed loudly.
“Exactly!” Ron burst out laughing and Harry chuckled as well. “No matter what you choose, Harry, I’ll be by your side.”
Well, Draco wasn’t ready to give up his time spent in the Slytherin Common Room! They had done something there! He liked it there and they had everything... soothing water on the windows, a secret beautiful garden which was only going to get nicer once the actual spring was coming... His friends were there for Merlin’s sake! Did Harry really think that Draco was okay following him to another house?!
Laughing, Harry shook his head. “You’re with another Auror, Ron. Calm down.” He smirked and shook his head. “Nott doesn’t play around.”
Draco heard Potter speak up again in one of Pansy’s small pauses for air. “It was nice meeting you, Pansy, but maybe we can talk another time? When I’m actually visiting you?”
Harry smirked and put the black coffee on the counter, grabbing the sweet double chocolate circle they made every day from scratch and placed it on a plate. Draco then marched over to where Blaise was currently sitting and eating his lunch.
Draco was smarter than to ask why he was giving him a clue when he told him he wasn’t going to get one.
“If you tell them yes, they might not be your problem anymore...” Neville offered, while Harry looked at him in shock.
Laughing, his friend shook his head. “This is going to end in a disaster. Just for fuck’s sake, tell him what our rules are so we can give him a perfect fit and he can be happy!”
“If you decide not to hide your personality, you’re actually quite easy to read. Well, enough about that. Draco, what makes you wanting to spend time with me, drinking in the middle of the night?”
Not long after, Ginny served the food she had been cooking – it looked as if it was Asian food. Luna handed Harry the potion he had been taking before every meal and he downed it quickly, just now realizing how hungry he had gotten. And Ginny was just an amazing cook.
Before he got up, he realized that something had fallen out of the book. It was a letter sent with Muggle post, it seemed. It was addressed to Harry coming from none other than Hermione Weasley. It looked as if Granger had married the Weasel. Draco debated whether or not to look into the envelope. It really wasn’t what he was supposed to do. He was supposed to read the book Harry had given him and find a cure. Reading a letter that fell out of the book seemed a little personal. Then again… the letter had been inside the book. Maybe it contained something important…
Potter shook his head, while his body was still shaking visibly. Draco sighed quietly, but sat down next to him. He should tell Potter that the war has been over for a while now, but his Muggle counterpart wouldn’t know about that. He also couldn’t just tell him that there was nothing dangerous in the fire. Some nights, he woke up in cold sweat as well, having dreamt about the Room of Requirement and him dying in it.
“It’s comfortable under here. I don’t have to use my magic, you’re not alone… Potter likes it here as well and… should Pansy throw snow here, it’ll melt as soon as it hits the Warming Charm” Draco explained smirking. "So, yes."
“I agree one hundred percent, bear. But I love this movie, so... It’s fine by me” Draco explained and grinned. “Ready to start?”
Ron, Seamus and Dean came back from the Dormitories and sat down at the table, Dean taking the seat right next to Draco, as if it was the natural thing for him to do. Draco glanced over to Harry, quite clearly having the same thought: Harry should have been sitting there. The newcomers grabbed some food, which seemed to be like a reminder to the others as they started eating now as well.
“Evan? What are you doing here?” And of course his smile was gone again. Whenever this man showed up in front of his doorstep, something was about to go down – never anything positive.
“You are the messiest wizard I know, Potter” Malfoy smirked. “No other wizard I know would keep the patens of two such huge potions hiding somewhere. There’s a lot of money involved in these.”
The other Gryffindor groaned, clearly not happy that Ron either didn’t read everything or just wasn’t getting it. “They wanted to make the people stop the testing, Ron. Read the second part again,
As they sat down, a house elf brought some tea and quickly disappeared again. Harry briefly wondered whether or not Kreature was still working here or if he had died. He suddenly felt a little guilty for not bringing him home once he had left Hogwarts, he had somehow completely forgotten him. Maybe he had to visit the kitchens and see for himself.
“Slytherin and Gryffindor do absolutely not match with their personalities! Gryffindors would jump into a dark whole, not knowing what lies at the bottom, Slytherins would find a way to light up the dark and actually
“Because nobody knows anything” Harry smirked and got up even if Draco tried his hardest to keep him close. “Go eat breakfast, love. I’ll meet you later today.”
“I’m so sorry” Draco mumbled into his shirt, while holding onto him as if he was scared that letting go would mean that Harry was going to be mad at him.
With almost a leap, he through his hands around Draco’s neck and pulled himself closer. Draco had just about enough time to hold against the pull and hugged his ward.
He looked back at his boyfriend. “Fine. Tell me why we need them and maybe I will shrink them so they’ll fit in as well. But Draco, as soon as I do this, it won’t be a Muggle vacation anymore.”
This made Harry laugh and he shook his head. “Honestly, it’s just amusing to see Theo jumping into the air when I get him. That’s all there is. Still innocent, right?”
Draco bit his lower lip, trying hard not to burst out laughing over Pansy being so dead serious and Potter copying whatever she was saying.
“Draco, yes. It’s me.” Draco chuckled. “It’s the eighth largest constellation in the night sky. When I was a child my mother used to tell me that I could do something amazing that would also catapult me to a status of famous wizards.” He sighed and nestled into Harry’s side again, trying to say what he wanted to say as quietly as possible, so Harry wouldn’t hear it. Even though he really wanted him to hear it. “Never thought it would be for being on the wrong side of war.”
“Draco, come with me, I want to show you something” she said and beckoned him to follow her into her office. Inside this rather big room was in the middle a beautiful old desk, clearly organized. However, on top were a lot of pictured in two neat piles.
Harry shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t think I did anything different than from what you did. It just worked…” He turned to his Auror partners, raising his eyebrows. “Should we see what’s inside?”
Draco nodded weakly. “I think I’ve caught feelings for him. It just happened! When we sat outside by the lake, I looked at him and then all of a sudden…”
Mirjam smirked and leaned back, crossing her legs. “So, if guess we won’t be needing all these questions, then?” She looked at the parchment and frowned at it.
“No! No!” Draco shook his head and locked the door. He was not going to have anybody over today. He needed to figure out what to do with this new information. “My father was just over and told me I needed to present him a marriage worthy man or he would sell me off.”
But he’s in Azkaban. How can I get him out unnoticed? Would he even help me? I could ask the Aurors to suspend his prison sentence once I’m back with the living. Hopefully Kingsley will see that this act was necessary. And I hope my delusions will let me think clearly so that I can get Draco out and hopefully he’s okay with helping me. I don’t know why he would, so let’s just hope.
“Why?” Draco didn’t’ mean to ask that question. It sounded as if he was looking down on Harry for having a Mind Healer, which he really wasn’t. He just… He wanted to know why someone to strong like Harry would even want to have a Mind Healer. To Draco it always sounded as if only the weak ones were given someone to help them with their minds. As if he wasn’t able to work with his
Smiling at Pansy, Harry shook his head. “I doubt that. Neville’s one of the most sensitive guys I know. He probably knew that something was amiss and I’m sure he won’t hold that against you. One day, you might have to tell him what happened, though. Just so he understands.”
Well, whatever it is: Maybe the book will be able to help you be an even better Guardian than you already are. I do think that you can do everything you want.
“You are not responsible, Harry. What has you this guilty?” Draco smiled, hoping it seemed trustworthy and that Harry would continue talking. Why would he think he was responsible? And what meant ‘everything’?!
“Good evening, Harry!” Severus greeted the former Gryffindor and when Draco saw him, he looked so happy and alive.
“Good, good!” The goblin positively beamed at him and motioned them to walk with him. While he almost made two steps when Eric made one, he was still faster than they were. Eric had always liked this place, especially since the goblins actually liked colours very much and Dwarfbart especially was wearing a bright yellow jacket with a dark red shirt and almost green glowing pants.
Before he could finish speaking, Draco rolled his eyes and grabbed Harry, making him follow him to the Common Room. “You’re not going to do that, Harry. Simply because I don’t like this reasoning. If you change it, I might let you go looking for them.”
Draco looked at the floor and bit his lower lip. “It’s one year away from you… It’s going to be so hard and… what if we won’t be able to get over that?”
“If I don’t have to talk to them” Kira laughed. “You know me, Freddy. Fighting is one of my hobbies. I cannot get enough of it.”
“Don’t worry, Draco” It was a sweet and dreamy voice and Draco stopped and looked at the student properly. It was Luna Lovegood. She smiled softly and nodded. “How is Harry doing? I heard no one wanted to babysit him? He’s not so bad, is he?”
Harry chuckled and looked at the newest addition to the Weasely-Granger family. “Well, Layla will definitely grow up in a loving environment. And I mean she’s beautiful!”
The Animagus shook her head. “Outing you would be outing me. I was trying to help Harry Potter myself. But I wasn’t able to get into the house undetected.” She looked at the Krimnee and nodded impressed. “I’ve never seen one in my lifetime.”
Potter looked around curiously, though once he was free to walk around, he chose to walk over to Draco and demand to be put on his knees. Chuckling slightly, Draco lifted him up and spun him around twice. His ward was laughing loudly and squealed, before he kicked shortly and Draco pulled him closer and sat him down on his lap.
When he turned his face to look at Draco, there was so much pain hiding underneath his expression that Draco couldn’t help himself. Before Potter could say anything, he leaned forward and cupped the Gryffindor’s cheek, slowly moving his thumb over his upper cheek. “You are not the reason for anybody’s despair or happiness, Harry. Just because they’re laughing and enjoying being together, doesn’t mean that they’ve forgotten you. You’re just as important to everyone else as you’ve been before everything turned sideways, okay?”
“I…” Draco chuckled surprised and shook his head. “Sorry, bear, the truth is, I’ve never actually had a relationship. So, I don’t know what love is.” He smiled slightly.
Draco shook his head, clearly frustrated with it, which made Harry smirk. He leaned forward and caught his husband’s lips in a kiss again. “I’ll play dumb” he offered quietly. “They can’t flirt if I don’t get it.”
Smirking, Harry shrugged his shoulders, though he wasn’t able to respond, as he heard people walking through the castle. With an annoyed sound, he let go of Draco and rolled his eyes just in time to see Hermione, Hannah, Daphne and Ernest walking towards them. Padfoot walked towards them and received some head scratches from Daphne.
were in school, you…” Pansy seemingly tried to understand the concept that Harry had been hunting Horcruxes while they stayed at their somewhat safe school. Being in Slytherin meant safety for them. Even if nobody had wanted to follow the Death Eaters and what they had been doing was just wrong.
And so he quickly stitched it, while Harry was once again facing another dilemma. He had wanted to quit the Aurors a few months ago. Now was definitely the time to do so. Ron could have died! He had a small baby girl at home! If he had died tonight... Harry would have never been able to let go of this guilt.
“Oh my god!” Hermione called out. Well, everything was funny, but her reaction… Maybe Harry was just too annoyed to think that she was worth a happy reaction.
Neville nodded and squeezed his shoulders, before he walked into the castle. Blaise smiled at him and held up his hands. “I promise not to tell anything about your relationship to Pansy. I’ll make it sound as if believe you were going through a divorce.”
Anybody up for a little fluff? This chapter was somehow incredibly easy to write and now I'm stuck again, though I hope you don't have to wait too long for the next one :)
After a second, Eric smiled and offered tea, which she accepted and within a few moments, they all sat around the table, where Aurora was peacefully asleep.
“Wow” Draco commented and ate another string of spaghetti slowly just to annoy the man. “I never thought someone could be so... complacent.”
It was quiet for a second on the other line, as if Potter was thinking how to respond to that, before he sighed and seemingly gave up. “Yes, I am.”
Toby talked to someone in the background, before his attention was back with Harry. “Greetings from Anna, she’s mad at you that you came by with Padfoot without her being here and she wants to know when you’re coming next.”
“It’s almost nine o’clock, Benjamin. I do need to get up” Potter remarked and tried to get out of bed. Draco grabbed him and imprisoned him in his hug. The Gryffindor fell back in his bed, laughing. He seemed so happy and it somehow made Draco happy as well. And he weirdly felt safe right here right now. The Gryffindor placed a soft kiss on Draco’s temple. “Let me go, please.”
“That was the plan, yes.” Severus seemed really unsure whether or not he had done the correct thing. It was not at all how his godfather had usually behaved. “You honestly don’t have to react to it, but I thought it would be…”
Hermione shook her head and frowned at him. “You need to start setting boundaries. Your work can’t dictate every waking second of your life.”
“Whatever you want it to be, Draco.” Hermione smirked and shrugged her shoulders. “Though the books we had on the table were about the Study of Ancient Runes.”
Grabbing his small microphone, Harry spoke to his entire staff. “The cake cutting will be moved to before father/daughter dance. Place another chair by the work table, the Minister arrived.” He then turned to Kevin. “Did you greet him already?”
Harry watched as Eric rolled his eyes and shook his head, but got up and walked over back towards them, Kira in tow.
Madam Pomfrey cleared her throat next to them and when Draco looked at her, he wasn’t sure whether or not she was annoyed by them. Maybe she was annoyed that Longbottom would most likely not do what she had told him. Or maybe she wasn’t happy that Pansy had just answered Harry’s virginity question. Well, no. Most likely, she wasn’t okay with the fact that Pansy had sworn in front of little Harry.
“Harry, tell me. I can understand complicated shit.” That made Draco stop quickly and he sighed. “I still don’t understand how I’ve decided to take Transfigurations, though. If it has to do with Transfigurations, you might have to be patient with me.”
Laughing, Draco shook his head. He was just about to thank him, when he realised that Benjamin didn’t really drink wine. “Thank you for the offer, however, maybe you should keep it for someone who actually likes your wine.”
Looking up from the surprisingly small stack of files, Kevin sighed. “Almost good. I just want these papers done before I go home. But I already made so many mistakes.” He yawned and rubbed over his eyes.
At the bottom was a nicely sized room with two doors to other rooms. On the floor lay broken cauldrons and dust that seemed to have once been a plant. Some green stuff had even gotten roots into the dry earth and was growing there. Malfoy stood by it and cast a spell on it to see whether or not is was poisonous. An empty picture frame stood on the table next to a moldy potion that hadn’t been finished in time.
Draco smirked a little. He seemed very worried. When Harry wanted to grab things to clean up, the Slytherin held him back.
“Watch me!” his ward called and ran in circles around Draco, who after two rounds finally managed to snatch his ward up. He threw him over his shoulder, playing drums on Harry’s arse, while he laughed and struggled to get free.
In the meantime, Draco had gotten up and walked over to the wine bar, looking for something good. Harry tried not to look after him and even caught Blaise smirking at him, as if he knew what he was thinking. That in turn made Harry roll his eyes, which was apparently an okay thing to do, as nobody questioned him about it.
That seemed to be proof, since Draco caught a very interested squirrel hopping on top of the wall, following them closely. Smirking over this animal, Draco turned back to Harry, who placed a flower on top of his parent’s grave.
Smiling slightly, he remembered what Remus said… Well… “Remus said the same thing today. He said that once Harry reaches his memories of his school days… It won’t last. What we have will not stay like this forever.”
I am really sorry; The last few days have been unexpectedly busy and I've only just now managed a little time off to upload this chapter. I also didn't have time to read any comments, but I hope tonight or at least tomorrow I'll find some time.
The concrete in his arms was getting better and Harry reached for his glasses and put them on. It was in fact Luna who was crouching next to his bed. Behind her, Nora was chewing on a bone. She looked up and wagged her tail, before she went back to her bone.
Malfoy looked up and smirked. “Nobody else has so much fun with my door sound. Could you hand me the case with the camera lens inside?”
The female character hugging her fiancé and her hand moved only slightly over his back. When two characters kissed, the thumbs brushing over the cheeks or a close up on a hand on the lover back, just resting there.
They wandered through the empty and silent halls. Even most of the portraits were empty and the ones that were here seemed to be in such a deep sleep that they didn’t wake up by their steps. Draco turned to Harry and smiled.
Pushing down the handle, the door didn’t budge at all. Harry looked up and shook his head. “Nothing. It doesn’t open. We’re locked inside.”
Harry was so shocked about the sudden lack of emotionless mask on the Slytherin that he stood there for two seconds, before he quickly sat down next to him. He pulled Draco into a hug and held him, while he cried – for so long that both actually missed dinner. Not that Harry cared even in the slightest.
Draco felt such a warm feeling in his stomach. Harry really did seem to love him. And he felt as if he could do anything with him by his side.
Snorting, Harry continued walking along the shore of the Black Lake. There was no way in hell, he would ever,
Severus turned around and narrowed his eyes as he vanished the liquid inside if the cauldron. “It’s different for everyone, Harry.”
“Very well.” Charlie smirked. “I’ve been able to read all the information and I believe it is possible to retrieve his memories. All of them.”
Smirking, Harry shrugged his shoulders. “And a dictionary is helping you in understanding people in Japan?” Harry asked rather amused and crossed his arms over his chest.
“Daisy thinks I’m eating not enough, so she comes over at least twice a week and makes breakfast for me. I’m supposed to eat everything by the time she starts working, but not even an army could finish what she cooks” he explained.
Draco hummed thoughtfully; still looking like Sherlock Holmes trying to figure out whatever mystery it was he was interested in. “Fine. But I need something in return.”
Ron sat up straight, having heard her when even Harry had who sat on another couch, not directly next to her such as Ron was. “I need to be nicer to
“But I had to work!” Harry shook his head, though he did stop and raised his eyebrows. He then opened his arms and smiled at his boyfriend. “Come here then, hun.”
“Absolutely not. That’s the least I could do!” Harry shook his head and motioned Pansy to walk again, since they had now quite the distance between them and Theodore.
Today, they weren’t expecting anyone, so Draco yawned and turned back to his book, not interested in the slightest on who would be standing in front of his door. Not before he looked over to the crib next to the table and found their baby boy asleep and breathing deeply. Harry's teddy bear was cuddling with him and Draco just couldn't get enough of any of this. Well, he needed to stop wasting time, as he was supposed to hold a presentation for experts in the medical field of the effect Granian hairs would have on traumatized adults in a week. However, he'd rather spend his time in the living room, next to his beautiful family. The presentation, as well as his potion's job could wait. Sadly, he hadn't had any time to dive back into his story, as another firm knock made him groan and he placed the book down. Well then, time to open the door and tell the idiot in front of it to go the fuck away.
“Put some on your shirt” Draco repeated with an evil smirk. “They need to know it was you who did this. If you have the same color somewhere on your shirt, they’ll figure it out.”
“Most likely, yes” Draco grinned and leaned over Harry again. “You’re my missing piece, Harry. I would be nothing without you.”
While Bridger disappeared behind one of the many dark red coloured curtains, Harry walked back to Draco and sat down a little bit further away. Draco frowned slightly. “Are you okay, bear?”
“Why are you such a jerk about it?” Weasley asked, rolling his eyes. Granger shook her head, either agreeing with her boyfriend or disagreeing. Draco had – once again – a hard time reading her.
Draco was not going to let him feel this insecure. Not after he had said that Draco calling him bear meant he felt
“I have no idea” Harry rubbed his forehead. “My guess is Aurors. Since I was retired, I constantly find myself discussing how stupid they are.” He shrugged his shoulders, a little flustered.
Pressing a kiss on Draco’s temple, Harry motioned to the cage in his hand. “Ready for one final, big freak out? I’ll let you go to bed afterwards.”
Frowning, Draco opened the pamphlet. Inside were only three questions next to the company name and address for the owl post.
Smirking, Harry shrugged his shoulders. “Magic” he stated and leaned back. Despite the Minister’s unwanted visit, this wedding was going to be a success, he knew it in his heart.
“Is this maybe Potter?” He tickled his ward, who screamed loudly and laughed, running away from him again. “You can’t get far away!” Draco called, but fell onto the floor to pretend that Potter could get away.
Not because he remembered someone of his parents like it had been with Remus and Sirius. They had loved him as well, as a son and sometimes they just saw his father in him. No, for some reason, here in Draco’s embrace, he felt home and safe.
Just like that, Draco had also felt his confusion return. And his jealousy. His own godfather had wanted to spend with little Harry, but when he was a child, it had always looked like Severus could have never run away the fastest. Well, it was probably his parents and had nothing to do with him. Draco knew that whenever they spent time together (alone), they were pretty close.
Unbelievable! She just gave away one of their biggest secrets, though… had someone looked up the marriage contracts of the Malfoy’s, they would have found that Draco’s got cancelled by the Greengrass family. There still wasn’t anything else to find in there.
He had never realized that one could have fun in the snow. Yes, he had always wanted to do something fun and the awareness that for the first time in his life, someone didn’t expect him to shovel the drive-way or whatever made it even better. He was just supposed to have fun right now and enjoy the weather and cold snow.
It was quiet for a while, before Harry pulled the parchment back and chewed on his lower lip. Finally, after about a full minute of no words said, he smiled weakly. “Okay. But you need to help me.”
would be nice here? It’s German and basically means home ruler. The name then transferred to Henry in English and then to… well Harry.”
Could you maybe help me in finding out what it means? I’m really confused by it and I can’t seem to figure out why I don’t have a swallow anymore. Not that I’m complaining much, since I am rather proud of this animal, but still. I’m utterly confused.
Grinning, Harry winked at him. “I thought you maybe wanted to see what happened. You know, since you couldn’t be there?”
The first three profiles, Harry only had to read the names and placed them on the ‘no’ pile. Herbert Wheeler, Basil Lee and Laurence Tyler were notorious for their very specific wishes in men. And yes, Malfoy would suit what they wanted their men to look like; however, they all were looking for men with a lot of political influence and Harry was somehow sure that the Slytherin was done with his short and painful excursion into politics in school. It had left him with a permanent scar on his arm.
Once they walked into a bathroom, Harry used his Parseltongue, which he apparently was still able to use, and… everyone jumped back as a black hole opened in the middle of the floor.
“But Draco went with someone to…” Hannah shook her head and looked at her husband. “Did you know? You always looked so suspicious whenever I wanted to talk with you about their relationship.”
“Excuse me, I’m also not from Hogwarts and I would love to be a wizard and I’m still here!” Ethan said shaking his head.
Not only Harry had lost track of time, since Draco honestly couldn’t tell when he had entered the library and when he had left it again. For all he knew, he could have spent five years inside that tiny room. Though once again, he should have felt hungry, if he really just spent five years inside that room. Unless of course, there were some magical blockers around it – Draco decided to check for magical blockers as soon as he could. Who knew what the Blacks had placed around the library!
Snorting, Draco winked at him. “Even if it did, Harry. It was so much fun messing with everyone. I don’t mind it ending earlier, though I thoroughly enjoy it if it was going to the very end.”
Harry grinned and rolled his eyes. “Careful with that wine now, it could go to your head, you now. A drunk professor’s not really what your students would like to see, I assume.”
Once it was close to lunch, Draco went to the kitchen with Teddy and they prepared the meal – spaghetti and tomato sauce. Well, Teddy told him some kind of story and Draco listened, asking questions and maybe starting new story threads, which Teddy seemed to like.
“It’s the mountain air. It’s amazing what it does to your sleep.” He wiped the top of the bar and cleaned the glasses, as if he had been doing this his whole life.
“Hm.” Alamar decided not to tell him that it was barely legal to keep a child out of school. Was it even legal to do that? Well, whatever it was, he needed to bury his own thoughts, when he smiled at Harry again. “Do you maybe want to come over today, when you’re free?”
Cambell walked away, shoulders hanging and Ginny rolled her eyes, before she sat down next to Pansy who sat there with a mouth wide open.
Draco bit his lower lip. Harry ran his fingers through Draco’s hair and found him shivering slightly. Following his instincts, he leaned closer and pressed a kiss on Draco’s forehead. The Slytherin inhaled surprised and after a moment of shock, he threw his arms around Harry and hid his face in his chest.
But he couldn’t say that. Dudley was always more trustworthy than he was. Even though Boy rarely spoke and when he did, it was the truth. However, in his short life he had learnt two important things. One: His cousin was always right and two: not to trust adults. They never believed him. It also hadn’t surprised him that Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon kept him in the house most of the time, hidden from any official people. They didn’t want to spend money on him and well, apparently school was money?
Sadly their new kitchen wasn’t as big as the other one anymore, though still with enough space to place down a table. However, the couch had to go into another room. On the bottom floor were next to the kitchen, a dining room and a somewhat sizable living room, two offices and an animal play room.
That sudden comment made Harry laugh and he nodded, ruffling Padfoot’s fur. His dog looked up and after seemingly realizing that there was nothing going on, placed his head back on Draco’s chest.
“Well, I like it, okay!” Draco glared at his friend, when another lightning bold flashed through the sky. Thunder erupted and actually shook the castle ground. “I always wanted to be Potter’s friend. If he needs me I’m not going to just… say no.”
Rolling his eyes, Draco slumped into an armchair. “Stop calling me Rapunzel and no, I don’t want some tea. Thanks, though.”
Harry was surprised by this question, though he was more surprised by her ability to somehow not get emotional. Frankly, he was always the one who got emotional, since he was so close to all of this. He guessed that a stranger was maybe better at seeing the whole picture. In his life plan there had always been children – a happy family was all he wanted.
His friend seemed impressed. “So you have a lot of free time then, don’t you? What are you going to do with it?”
Draco looked worriedly over to his ward sitting between Pansy and Blaise. It had been two days since he had woken up with the nightmare of the Dark Lord. And it had been two days since he had stopped properly eating. Pans had made sure to give him healthier food so that he would at least eat healthy. And Theodore had continued sneaking food from the kitchen, mostly sweets in hopes that Harry would eat that. Nothing had worked.
Granger grabbed him and made him sit down on a couch, when little Potter saw his chance and sat down, grinning broadly, on his lap. He started to once again, talk about Kneazels, while Weaslette threw him an apologetic look.
Blaise chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. “I know, but I just want you to know that whatever happens, we’ll be by your side!”
“Partum Pluviam” he said calmly and performed the wand movement. After not even a second, a nice warm jungle rain like style trickled down on them. It was so thin and almost none existent that it seemed as if the air was just suddenly made out of water.
“I’m sorry.” Eric sighed and shook his head, while he petted Aurora, who gave him an almost as reproachful look as Alamar was.
Oliver sighed and shook his head. “Please, Noah, there are other customers in our shop; maybe they’ll need help as well. I’ve got this.”
Maybe Pansy and Millicent were successful? Draco rushed up the stairs, almost crushing into his Potion’s Professor and came to a halt a little bit away from the doors to the Great Hall. Severus had called out to him and so he turned around.
“I can’t just leave it alone. I feel like I need to clean it and maybe… live here.” Harry looked out of the front door over the lake and smiled. “It’s also much nicer here than in the middle of London.”
It was endearing to Draco when he saw the sudden concerned look of Pansy’s face. She had always been and always would be his best friend.
Draco rubbed his forehead again. Whatever this curse was, it must have been a strong one. Maybe he also needed to sneak into the Manor’s very own library and find a few books there. He wasn’t sure what the curse was. All these symptoms could mean everything. Dark curses, especially old ones, had an array of different symptoms just so that nobody would ever figure out what the curse was until it was too late.
Harry Potter. Literally everything else is better than that. Well, I only returned because Voldemort was stupid enough to take my blood. It continued the blood protection my mother started.”
Draco rolled his eyes and entered the living room, where his mother rushed towards him with a huge smile. “Draco, it’s good to see you!” She kissed his cheek and Draco stepped back again, looking at her.
“Harry” Draco said calmly, sitting down on his bed. “You’re safe, bear. There’s nothing bad going to happen to you!”
Potter held on tight to his jumper and Draco decided that maybe he wanted to sleep in Draco’s bed. Maybe that was actually helping him sleeping calmly.
“And then, there’s you” Harry continued softly. Draco’s head was spinning as he tried to focus on his eyes rather than moving lips. “And you’re still a mystery to me.”
Draco smirked. “You saved me, Harry. Again – if I may say so. The least I can do is try to get you back to a normal life.”
Draco groaned and shook his head. His hair coming untied from the messy bun he had put them in. Harry walked behind him and pulled his hair back into a pony tail, so it wouldn’t annoy him anymore. He was clearly already annoyed by the fact that Harry had made such a harsh condition. Under his breath, he murmured: “Why did I let Granger convince me to do this?!”
“Dray look! It’s Remus! Let’s go say hi!” Harry jumped up and when Draco frowned, he felt himself being pulled up as well.
Walking closer, he placed to torch in the middle of the room and stood in front of the soft looking wall. It was a wall hanging in azure. It seemed that the tapestry wasn’t all that new and a lot of dust had collected here.
Shrugging his shoulders, Harry resumed eating his chips. He didn’t really mind that, as long as he could stay with Eric and Alamar and Aurora. “I don’t mind.”
The group around the table started laughing again, and Harry had just had enough time to swallow the food, before he had turned into a coughing mess.
He motioned Harry to get out of the cupboard and when they appeared in the living room, Eric grinned broadly at the boy. “Hi Harry! Coming with us, I assume?”
“Yes, you were a friendly baby” Draco snorted and jumped over Harry running his hands down his sides and he walked backwards until he reached the counter. “You’re positively evil!”
He needed a way of explaining why he couldn’t ask his friends about relationship advice without making it too obvious. “I wanted to ask you about your... views on how to ask someone out, since...”
“… and that’s why I don’t think people should trust them anymore” Harry finished his argument, which Draco hadn’t heard. He wasn’t really sure who he was talking to, since it was slightly weird for him to talk to the dog.
“No idea” Potter joked and shrugged his shoulders. “I know for a fact that you’re happy with Jason, though. So I’m not questioning myself.”
Daphne spoke up and decided to play along. “There must be another reason as to why you were hiding the ring.”
Draco bit his lower lip. He was not going to leave Potter here, when he had just started to keep track of his eating habit. And it had been going better and better. Only this morning, Potter had already started eating some bacon, when Draco walked down the stairs. If he would leave now, the Golden Boy could just go back to his system of starving himself to death.
Kingsley frowned and there was suddenly a very stern look on his face. “That wouldn’t make me unable to s…”
Harry sighed and fell into the chair, Padfoot sitting down next to him. “Incredibly hard. We honestly can’t leave each other alone.”
Draco snorted. “How exactly do you know that? We could be here just fighting for the custody of Padfoot.”
“Should that happen, at least we know that Harry…” Once again, Draco was interrupted, though this time by Pansy, giggling.
He looked up at Potter who was right now walking around the ground, while Pansy followed him like a very loyal dog, talking to him about anything interesting and catching him if he ever almost fell to the floor.
Frowning, Hermione turned to Ron who nodded. Ron then turned to Harry and placed his arm around his wife. “’Mione is under a temporary mind erasing spell, there was an accident at work.”
Draco placed a soft kiss on his temple, which made Harry hum quietly and he placed his head on his husband’s shoulder once the kiss ended. He felt his husband’s arm on his shoulder and pulling him closer into a one-armed hug.
It had only started with a few side remarks and then, when Draco had said something rather insulting about his parents which would have made Harry about to kill his husband if they had still been in school and hated each other, Harry had made the bowl of beans explode on the table. That bowl of beans had drenched Draco with its content and spilled over the other wizards and witches as well, almost making Harry laugh and fall off the chair, though he could keep it in.
Nodding, Harry remembered his own time in the Ministry. He had always thought it was weird how he had gotten such a high position of power, when Jason had been there so many more years. “Well, doesn’t surprise me. These goons have never really seen the little guys.” Harry smiled weakly. “How’s your lovely wife?”
“You don’t need to give me encouragement. I know I made a mistake and maybe one day I can make it up to you… if I’m still alive by that point.” Harry shrugged his shoulders.
“Ah, Sirius, that is life. Some of us stop moving” he looked at Potter a little accusing. “Others finally get the job they have been dreaming of.”
Walking around the other side of the building, Harry found Nott inspecting a hole in the wall. It seemed to be magical, as he couldn’t get through it and you couldn’t look through.
“That’s okay, you just need to find someone who likes you the way you are. And I like you! You are awesome and you protect me, remember?” Harry smiled, pointing at Draco’s hair. Subconsciously, Draco touched his hair, still having a few tears in his eyes. His little ward continued: “Everyone makes mistakes! Pansy said that. It’s important that you learn from them, if you can’t correct them now at least learn from them.”
He couldn’t stop himself from parenting… “You should go to bed, get at least another thirty minutes sleep.”
“Well” Harry smirked. “Whatever it is, we have quite a lot of time to figure out things. However, the more important thing for me is tomorrow.” He grinned.
Draco smirked. He put one finger under the Golden Boy’s chin and made him look at him again. “Nothing weird about that, Sirius.”
And that bird couldn’t say anything about it, as it was quickly caught by a midnight black cat and consumed. The four hooded figures left the house as if nothing had been touched and within the blink of an eye... they were gone again. No one had seen them coming and no one had seen them leaving. It was as if they had never been there.
At this time, Draco got surprising backup from Harry himself who looked at McGonagall frowning. “But I didn’t take away everything” he said and crossed his arms.
Draco decided to stay awake a little longer, when he realized that Potter had actually fallen asleep right there and then. He lit up a candle and sat next to it with a book about charms to help children. He had found it in the library, when he went to look for a book for his charms essay.
Harry looked at him silently for quite a while, before he smiled weakly. “You are a better human being, Draco. For the record, I just want to apologize to you directly for what I’ve done. I almost killed you in fifth year.”
“No! Please don’t! I didn’t even want this!” Draco called out and tried to get up from his bed, but he was held back. He turned around and found the girl his mother had wanted to marry him to in his bed.
Draco promised to do so and soon the discussion went to other topics again and after they drank everything, Harry and Remus went upstairs to go and hunt smaller creatures. That only left Draco and Teddy and the two of them spent their time in the living room playing with Teddy’s toys.
“No… No Harry, stop it” Draco looked down at the toddler on his knees, pulled his hair out of the grasps of the Golden Boy and raised his eyebrows. “What are you doing with my hair?”
. What do you think he went through?! A lot of ‘getting what he wants’ and ‘Gryffindor is the best house there is’ most likely.” It was probably not fair to reduce Potter to something like this, but he honestly thought that Potter had a sacred childhood. So what really was there to go through?!
Harry also seemed very convinced that he was going to die any day now, with his best friends spending so much time with him. On some days, Draco read almost a note telling the reader what a nice life he’d had – as if he was saying goodbye. On other days, the entry was full of memories and things he probably didn’t want to forget.
“And what do you think?” The question had left Draco’s lips before he had time to over think it and quickly turned back to his breakfast, which was already gone.
“You need to see them first, darling. Once you see them, you’ll know what I’m talking about.” Eric said quietly and then turned to his side.
Harry likes apples the most, but I’ve tried something like carrot puree and he just likes to draw with it, not really eat it. Potato puree does the trick and maybe you’ll figure out how to make him eat more vegetable, I hadn’t had any success until now.
Smiling over to his husband, Harry opened the bottle. “Now come here, darling. Let me take a look at your hair for you. Let me make you feel better.”
That seemed very weird. Maybe it was because the stone wasn’t a living object and Nott’s arm belonged to a person? But why could a stone get through a magical force field and an arm couldn’t? Harry took out his own wand.
And then, finally, his husband walked over, followed by Blaise, Theodore and Gregory. It seemed as if the guys had tried to make him do or say something to Harry and Draco finally decided to act on it. Harry crossed his arms over his chest and narrowed his eyes, while he saw Ron turning around and then basically following his movement.
That was a good question. What Draco wanted was to be back in Harry’s embrace. Feeling as if nothing in this entire world counted. Nothing counted, but the two of them.
Harry smiled and sighed, remembering Hermione giving him that stupid potion, which made him shake his head. Fleur frowned at him, before she sat down at the kitchen table and Harry followed, looking over at Dominique who was concentrating very much in her ferret.
Granger didn’t look that angry at them, Weasley however had something unspoken that was clearly annoying him.
“I was” Harry smiled and pretended that he didn’t notice anything different on himself. “I was in the forest and just needed to cool off a little.”
“There is always work to do, Harry! Besides, I heard you guys got Eastoft! Congrats!” Hermione grinned, while Harry rolled his eyes.
“Well hello, stranger” she smiled at him and Draco was completely taken in by her cheerful nature. “A long way from home, I assume?”
Harry smiled softly. “Well, I noticed how uncomfortable you’ve been the whole day. And I’m sorry for making the beans explode all over you this early into the day.” He smiled softly, and continued speaking before his husband would – he already saw him opening his mouth. “So, I decided to make it up to you and clean your hair. To make sure that there’s no residue of beans or sauce in there.”
He hurried through the garden and stood in front of the patio door. If he was working in the garden, he wasn’t allowed back into the house unless he had brushed every small piece of dirt off of him. “Yes, Aunt Petunia?” he asked quietly. She turned to look at him with her red face almost matching the pink flower dress she was wearing to fit in – which she never did with her horse face.
Harry shrugged his shoulders. “I’m bored. Mil and Pans are working on the Charms project and Theo said he’s going to look for Hermione for some insight into Muggle culture. And I saw Ze kissing someone in the Common Room. So, I’m bored. What are you doing? Can I join?”
“You’re right” he said softly and glanced at Pansy, before kissing his boyfriend again. This time much softer, to give him some much needed time to figure out what reality was.
Alamar smiled warmly. “It’s a fairy tale. I’m sure I got the book around here, somewhere.” He got up and walked out of the kitchen, while Harry turned to Eric.
Well, that wasn’t the point of this letter. He had completely forgotten about it and the fact that his Patronus was the same as Harry’s. Apparently, there was something important happening, though.
“You can’t outrun us!” Blaise called towards him, though his lungs were not really working in his favor.
“Someone’s in a bad mood.” Draco watched feeling slightly guilty, as Harry winced and turned to look at him with the minor shocked expression Draco had gotten to know so well. “Sorry.”
The Slytherin shrugged his shoulders and walked to the left, where two doors went into different rooms. Harry saw one of them open and decided to follow the blond man.
The door to the Room of Requirement appeared again and Harry turned to the entrance, where not even a second later, Draco walked through quickly. He stopped and looked around, probably surprised by the huge bathroom in front of him, until his eyes fell on Harry.
Whistling a Christmas tune on the radio, Harry walked around in his office, checking the different folders where he had a few hundred pictures of people who had just given him their profile. Saturday was always his favourite time to work uninterrupted. Maria had always a free day and Kevin only came in when they had both far too much to do. Harry had told him to stay home and enjoy the winter. There were only three cases open and while Harry was in fact looking for a possible match for Malfoy, he also liked to look for someone for the others.
Remus shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t know exactly what happened. I just know that Harry’s had a few doubts about being a good person since the Hat had wanted to put him into Slytherin. I hope you guys can show him that being in Slytherin doesn’t mean you’re a bad guy.”
“Yeah, but… You’re always able to read my mind and do whatever I need that moment. And I try to do the same, so I think it’s okay. Even if, yes, I can’t get enough of you and I’d love to spent every day of every week with you in bed – that can’t happen. We’ve got lives to live and how it is now, that’s fine.”
“What if” he started carefully, “What if Harry could control his magic to the extent that he can... let’s say colour my hair blue and then remove it?”
Laughing, Harry would have loved to hear more stories like that. He assumed that most women had done something like that – in fact he would have loved to know what his grandparents had done. However, his train of thoughts was halted by his friend.
Unsure whether to comment on what the Saviour had just said about being broken, Draco turned back to the pub, when he saw a certain additional aspect of Hogwarts integrated and immediately felt homesick. The stones covering the upper floor walls looked exactly like his home, while the ground floor seemed to be home for a lot of other people.
“I’m not sure I can sell it.” The worker frowned and shook his head. “Honestly, we have so many better functioning owls…”
“Yeah. I think it would be a good thing. I won’t need that, but maybe they could use it. Even if it’s just for ideas or something.”
Not even when they both had been at Hogwarts had he looked that relaxed, well… Every year, there had been something in the way of his happiness. Now was his third year and Draco knew they were already at the end of it. That was the only reason why they had gone to the Infirmary. Madam Pomfrey knew that at the end… the Dementors had messed with him.
Parkinson glared at Harry who just sat there, quickly looking at the book Zabini had back in his hands, trying to read what was written on its back.
“Or I’ll follow you wherever you are and make you pay!” Pansy grinned and lightly slapped his cheek, which made Harry chuckle and roll his eyes.
Getting up, Draco looked around the kitchen until he found tea and decided to have his first cup of tea in about ten years. Harry had quite a huge tea selection and it took him a few seconds to get through them all and figure out what he wanted. He wasn’t used to getting so much free will and finally settled with the second one he had smelled. It was Turkish apple with cinnamon. Once the boiling water poured over it, Draco had to physically stop himself form downing it that second. It smelled so amazing! Especially after all this time of only being able to drink water or hot water if you were sick. All his senses worked overtime, when he carefully brought the cup to the table and sat down on the wooden chair again. It didn’t smell like cold, wet stones and sweat. No, it just felt like… home.
Looking at the letters, Draco was about to jokingly state the obvious, when he recognized what they were about. They were from his parents.
It was already dark when four hooded figures appeared on an empty street somewhere outside of a big city. The street was quiet and empty, cars neatly parked in the drive ways, gardens looked pretty. The white picket fences seemed to glow by the light of a full moon. Somewhere, a lonely dog howled at its only friend and the wind carefully brushed over the area as if it was afraid of touching anything.
“Pansy Pandora Parkinson” Harry started, mocking her with the same tone she had used for him, when both Draco and Pansy widened her eyes in surprise. Before he could even continue mocking Pansy’s phrasing, she hushed them.
Harry rubbed his arms and he smiled, placing a hand on the former Gryffindor’s chest. In his wildest memories, he would have never been able to predict what life had in store for him in his eighth year. Almost being married off, having to take care of baby Harry, getting adopted by Severus, being in a relationship with Harry freaking Potter… That was something not even his dreams could come up with, right?
“Yeah” Harry nodded. “Until I was there over the summer, I always figured he lived in a huge Manor, like the Malfoy Manor.”
Harry suddenly charged at Draco, which made him jump up and rush to the side, grinning broadly. He did however not see his ward running back at him again and they tumbled to the floor, while Pansy laughed.
“But you don’t” Ron said and laughed. Harry felt uncomfortable by his best friend’s action. It was as if he wanted to please Nott and go with him wherever this conversation was leading. For the first time in a long while, it felt as if he was fighting alone again – he didn’t like it.
I cannot decide what my favourite pairing is. Yes, the story started as a Drarry, but I love Pansy’s storyline as well. So: Draco, Pansy, Blaise and Ron have my four favourite story lines. I have no idea why I love Terrance so much, but he’s one of my favourite characters here xD
Draco was not going to let that happen and he cast the spell Madam Pomfrey had taught him when Harry was a toddler. It stopped his constant growing. Harry seemed to have felt the magic surrounding him, as he actually glared at Draco. Yet, it seemed to be more a silent scream for help – in Draco’s eyes.
“I hope you don’t mind me joining this circle of women?” Harry asked as he sat down next to Hermione. She smiled at him and shook her head while Hanna answered.
Laughing, Harry shook his head. Draco chuckled, greeting his friend as well and the whole group made their way into the kitchen. As the first person to walk into said room, Draco had a pretty good view over what was happening. Merlin was dangling upside down on the lamp and was just about to let himself fall onto the table to feast on what was standing there.
From his hide out, he could hear Nott screaming frustrated and then him calling through the house: “The fucking door is still locked!”
His phone vibrated and he quickly slid it out of his pocket, hoping that nothing had gone wrong with the last huge surprise of his client. Luckily, it was just Ginny asking about how he was doing.
Draco fought the urge to tell him to get his shit together, since it was only kiss. The realisation that he had just kissed the man he had wanted for so long was making it hard to think straight. And maybe he should tell himself as well to get his shit together.
“Amazing.” Draco rolled his eyes, when he passed him. “Actually, I was able to avoid Father for another day, so it is amazing.”
“You don’t look like you were by yourself, though.” Now even Daphne looked a little uncomfortable as she said that. It appeared as if she had also fallen into the trap Harry and Draco had laid out.
Potter placed the other end of the fabric over his shoulders and Draco suddenly realized that they were sharing a blanket and sitting rather close together. He would feel the warmth of the savior’s skin through the school uniforms and it made his arm tingle slightly.
Harry Potter straightened his jacket again and sighed under his breath, leaning against the door frame. He couldn’t wait to get out of these terrible clothes and head to bed. He was happy that the wedding was going so well and that another client of his had successfully found a wife, however, weddings never were his things. No matter how beautiful they were – and this one was one of the most stunning ones he had been invited to. Even though he was technically working here anyway.
He opened his eyes again to see Harry smiling at him. “I love you, Draco. I always have, ever since we were at Hogwarts. I don’t ever want to live a day without you.”
“So, is it Sunday then?” Harry asked and fell onto a chair. He saw Nora walking into the kitchen behind them, with her bone in her snout. She then lay down onto the dog bed and kept chewing on it.
They apparently fell asleep like that, since Draco felt as if time had stopped or simply ignored them. When heopened his eyes again, everything was quiet and dark. It seemed to be somewhat late – or early depending on how you looked at it.
Harry smiled and sat down by his side, putting his arm around his shoulders and pulling him into a hug. Draco sighed softly and snuggled into his side, an arm around his waist, when he closed his eyes.
Placing his wand back into his arm holster, he slowly walked towards the front door and placed his hand on the door handle. The cold metallic material seemed to warm up at his touch and almost melt into his skin, though not because it was hot – mostly because it seemed to absorb his hand structure.
After a short while and before Harry could do anything else, the door to the Common Room opened and blond hair could be seen. Harry frowned, when Luna entered the room. She stopped and smiled at them. “Sorry, the Nargles led me here. Wrong Common Room. Enjoy your evening.”
Draco smiled softly and watched the star wandered through the sky which made him feel so small, actually being able to see the earth turning. “I’ve always been rather interested in the star constellations.” He grinned. “If your family is named after them, it makes it rather easy to be interested. When I was little, Severus gave me a book with all kind of knowledge about stars and I would learn everything by heart and tell anyone who would listen to some trivia about stars.”
Sophie cheered and jumped from Harry’s lap. She ran to the kitchen and Harry smiled at Draco. “Looks like it didn’t work.”
“Are you okay, Dray? You look like you realized something was a huge mistake… Do you not want to have Sev as your dad?” Harry asked and Draco quickly cleared his throat.
So, he sat down next to Neville and grabbed a glass of wine as well. He could see Draco opening his mouth and shutting it again. Hiding his smirk behind the glass of wine, he took a careful sip. It tasted too sweet for his liking, but that and the intense flavor of just berries was all he could taste. He was sure that Draco would have loved to make a statement about Harry’s lack of wine-knowledge, though that would have very likely ended in another ‘fight’.
Draco couldn’t stop himself from chuckling at Potter who seemed to just accept that for now Pansy wasn’t happy, but that she would be happy again. His best friend ruffled through Potter’s hair and he squealed, grinning at her. At least he wasn’t in any pain, Madam Pomfrey had taken that away from him and Draco was glad she did.
Pansy stood there for a second, before she grinned and shrugged her shoulders. “Nev, wait!” She waved quickly and ran after her boyfriend.
His mother still looked a little disapproving, though she quickly smiled. Even though it looked a little fake, Draco had nothing against it. “Of course! I have just wanted to get some tea. Would you like to join me?”
Taking another sip of the tea, he suddenly stopped in the middle of his action, though not before swallowing. What was that?! Why did he just say something like that? How was he being so out of his mind?
It was quiet in the little room and Harry found it hard to concentrate on what he was doing. Draco stood there with his shoulders hanging, his eyes were almost in a thousand yard stare, until he let himself fall onto the sofa and started crying.
Draco smirked. “And once that happens and they realize you’re not hungry, they will figure out you’ve been lying to them.”
Harry rolled his eyes and pressed a kiss on his lips. “Don’t complain, Draco. I don’t like you manipulating people by complaining and whining.” He brushed a strain of hair out of Draco’s face and ran his hand through his hair. “The clue would be…” Harry frowned and thought of something.
Draco’s mother apparently decided to back up her husband. “Harry, dear, we are just wondering if maybe Draco asked you to do him a favor. It is time to get married after all.”
Frowning, Harry shook his head. “So… instead of pretending to be dating, we’re pretending to break up? I don’t want to divorce you Draco! You’re the only good thing that’s ever happened to me!”
Laughing, Draco took back his fork. “Well too bad, bear! This is my salad!” he said teasingly. Potter pouted and crossed his arms, which made not only Pansy very weak, but Draco as well. He had wanted to keep this game up for a little bit, but not when his ward looked so heartbroken.
The person who was speaking, however, was Weasley: “Where the fuck did you go, Harry?! You can’t just go and leave us in the middle of the bloody night!”
Smiling sweetly, Albus kept the incantation going while he continued talking to the pale looking young man. “Well, I think we need to get the people who abducted him and are probably torturing him right now. So, I have a special assignment for you: From now until the summer’s over, I need you to go and track down Harry Potter. Don’t bother coming back before.” He stopped the spell and made the stack of paper appear and placed the housing report on top.
Not that Harry Potter believed in it. Or any wizard he had ever met. Actually, that last part, he didn’t know. He never really talked to anybody about this theory. It would just be too weird.
Had he ever seen his former nemesis cry? He couldn't remember when or if he had ever seen that. Not even on the picture that showed how his godfather had died. He had looked empty. But there was no trace of tears. What did it mean that he was now crying? In his arms, no less?! Draco decided not to question what was happening and simply help his ward over the emotional burden he was carrying right now.
The thing that had helped him the most was discussions about things that interested him. That way he could forget that there was something his body was freaking out over.
It was earlier than yesterday, but Draco was quite tired. “Bed?” Potter asked and Draco just had enough strength to nod. He wasn’t sure how he could make it up the stairs.
It was a little weird, yes, Harry had to admit it. However, again: It seemed so familiar. Suddenly, Malfoy grabbed his attention. He walked into the corner of the room, seemingly fascinated by something. Harry’s gaze followed and he found a scarlet staircase leading upwards. That was weird – he definitely hadn’t seen the staircase on the floor above.
“Yes, I need to find a purpose for my life outside of this stupid Auror work. I’m not sure I can convince Ron to follow my example, though” Harry sighed.
At least like that, the Dursley’s weren’t going to look for Harry and potentially warn Dumbledore that his trophy boy had run away. If he was not important to them, they would probably just forget he even existed. Which was their goal for now.
Draco sat there after a second, and he jumped up and let go of a relieved sigh. Harry chuckled tiredly, he pointed at the small amount of potion still left in the vial. “You need to drink all of it.”
They went to the Infirmary right after dinner; however, not only Draco had walked there with Harry… Theodore, Pansy, Blaise and Millicent had all followed. Nobody seemed to be willing to let Harry go through with finally remembering everything. Actually, it wasn't that. He already did remember everything. They didn't want to... stop caring for him, it seemed.
Harry looked up and frowned. “That’s the thing you loathe about me? Not the fact that I always have people around me, following, admiring, whatever? Not my unpunctuality? My hero-complex? My chaotic office or the fact that I keep hiring people who are going through a rough patch, even though we already have too many people working for us?”
Hooch started speaking: “That would mean young Harry Potter would live in Gryffindor until he has reached his actual age again.”
Harry sat up and crossed his legs, pushing his face in his hands. He was just seconds away of another panic attack. He needed Draco.
“What?” Draco widened his eyes. His mother was in contact with Potter? Why had she never told him that?
Potter rolled his eyes and started eating without Draco having to tell him to do so. Ian apparently wasn’t done.
Daphne, Ernest and Parvati sat in a small circle closer to the water, whispering and sometimes throwing the odd look towards Harry. Padma, Millicent, Susan and Pansy had formed a girl’s club surrounding one of the picnic tables and shooing all the men away, but waving towards Hanna and Megan who just now walked closer to the group outside. They too seemed to be discussing the events that had taken place this afternoon.
Before he could finish his sentence, Hermione held out her hands as if to calm them both down. “Boys, really? We’re not even back for twenty-four hours and you’re already attacking each other? Can’t we be adults about this thing?”
Draco pulled Harry closer and put his arms around him. He felt Harry sigh happily and closed his eyes. This was what he had always wanted. A place… a person where he felt at home. Whatever happened to them, as long as Harry was around, Draco would feel at home.
Later that day, Draco returned to the pub and was surprised to find a good number of people inside. The door to the kitchen was open as well and a middle aged woman dressed in shining yellow and with blowing brown hair, who had clearly seen the worst in life and accepted that life was unexplainable, walked out with three plates of food.
As if he had been waiting for that, he placed an absolutely sickening lovely smile on his lips and turned to Harry. “Well, they might as well hear what I have to say too!”
“You’re a very good boy, Padfoot” he whispered. “Dad will be a little funny for a couple of days, okay? But we still love each other.” He grinned, before he got up again and decided to walk to the kitchen and ask if they had some dog food or if he should be buying something from somewhere. Seeing Hermione’s confused look and the way she was frowning at him when he left, made it almost worth it, coming here.
Draco did as he was told and the assistants placed the blood into the potion as well. After a short amount of time, the bubbles stopped and the black color transformed into a soft white one. The potion seemed smooth and Graeme nodded impressed.
In the kitchen, Padfoot was welcomed with a bowl of water and the promise that house elves could also cook for a dog. Harry felt slightly guilty for not cooking enough for his dog. In Hogwarts here, he would probably get treated like a king and when they were back home, he had to go back to boring dog food which he would buy at the store? He had to make a greater effort once they were back home again.
Harry shook his head and smiled at his husband – most likely a very love-sick smile, if he had analysed the annoyed looks from both Neville and Blaise correctly. “Oh no, darling. I am happy that
Harry frowned. “It’s still not that clear… But okay. So, Sirius died? And now there’s a vault that doesn’t really mean anything to me? That might give me terrible feelings since it should remind me of my father and his shenanigans? Great.” Harry sighed and placed the letter on the desk.
Sophia sent him to Mrs Williams, where he did in fact find James and the old woman playing chess. The boy immediately jumped up to help Sirius out, which Draco found rather nice of him.
“Oh yeah. I’ve already done it.” Neville seemed thoughtful, though he smirked at Harry again. “So, how can I help you?”
With the memory of his happy days, he fell asleep in the white room. He wanted Potter close again, the scent of him surrounding him, engulfing him, until he slept with a happy smile on his face.
Meanwhile, Harry turned to Draco, slightly scared and nervous. “Are we here for another evaluation?”
“Well” Potter chuckled. “We might just be the personification of a coin, Malfoy. You’re on the ‘he’s so evil he followed his father to the dark side’-side and I am on the ‘he can do no wrong, he defeated the big baddy’-side. It’s just two sides of the same coin. The whole world is looking at what we’re doing and judging us for things that they wouldn’t want to be judged by at any day.”
Within a few hours, the candle was half gone and Draco was completely immersed in the book, when he jerked up by a sound coming from the crib. He placed the book under a magical spell and let it float in the air, open to the page he had been on.
When Severus opened the door, Draco found a large group of Adults trying to calm down the crying baby, of which Draco hadn’t gotten a good look. McGonagall turned around and seemed relieved at the sight of Draco.
“Please, Sir. Give me another week!” he pleaded. King had other Aurors left, which he could send to Australia to look for an untraceable Golden Boy.
“Alright.” Draco put his notebook back into his robe and accepted the folder. Before he could leave, Weasley addressed him again: “Malfoy, if you find him, please let us know. We’re worried sick.”
There was no use in trying to get his godfather talking. He had already tried it and it hadn’t worked out so far! Maybe one day he would tell him… Or actually, maybe one day Potter would tell him. However, he wasn’t really hopeful something like that was going to happen.
Pansy had found a headband with attached matching hair to every person wearing it; however, they looked to be alive and constantly changed hairstyles. Draco thought that Neville’s findings were much better than Pansy’s even though hers was just as fun to watch.
As Draco entered the Common Room with Harry trailing behind him, he held the door open and his ward skipped through it, happy to see his friends again. Draco thought it was just too precious when he ran up to Millicent and asked her whether or not they could go outside and play in the snow. It had snowed over night again and in the secret garden, there was tons of new soft white snow.
The Auror turned around and glared at the parchment. He looked at his underlings. “Bringeth that gent to me - dead 'r alive.  I doth pref'r dead!”
Kingsley nodded. Harry was aware that the Minister knew he bought them off a black market. He also knew that Kingsley didn’t raid all of them at the same time, so that Ginny and Luna still had a chance to get the potion he needed to not vomit his heart out. So in a way, the Minister was also somehow trying to save his life or at least to keep him alive.
Charging through the white and black halls of the Ministry, he slithered around the corner only to collide head first with another Auror, throwing papers everywhere and landing on top of him. At least he had an easy landing.
our story.” He got up and walked closer. “Please change the cake!” he whispered in now clear fake desperation.
– whatever that is –, but crayons. Maybe this can help you to get better at whatever you’re good at.”
Harry yawned again and shook his head in an attempt to make him wake up. Of course that didn’t work. So, he looked at his husband and smiled. “I need to do something to you. If I don’t, I’ll be the guy they all take pity on and let’s be honest… we both did some stupid things.”
Well, yes. The fact that he couldn’t talk to Harry. Then again, why was that such a huge problem? He had gone almost ten years without talking to this Gryffindor. The last time he talked to him was when he thanked him for getting him out of Azkaban. That was around Christmas and he had then gone off to France and decided to travel around Europe and forget about what happened to him.
“Oh, we can talk about that this evening; I’m thinking we could meet in the Room of Requirement after midnight? Just the two of us.” Harry returned the smile. “She wanted to know whether I’ve discussed being the headmaster of Hogwarts with you – which I haven’t really.”
Realizing that Harry had been correct, Draco chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. “I’m just saying, bear. Try and find a memory from now that fills you with joy and then try again!”
He was well aware that Draco stayed in bed and watched him closely. Not that he minded a lot. He was also aware that he felt different. Fuller, somehow. Hermione was going to get an earful, tomorrow.
Draco’s expression turned soft. So soft and loving that Harry felt butterflies in his stomach from the intense love he had for his husband.
Weasley sighed and nodded. “Okay man. But our information is a bit outdated.” He stared at Draco for a while and turned back into his home. “Stay there. I’ll bring you everything I’ve got.”
The Ministry had destroyed all contracts with the Slytherins and offered actual jobs to most of them. Each and every one of the Slytherins had politely declined and sworn to build a life far away from the magical society – or at least the Ministry.
“Yet you can still do wandless and soundless magic? That’s still impressive” Draco answered, getting up to finish the job Harry had wanted to do with his magic.
I’ve taught myself the Patronus in fifth year and I always found solace in it – a swallow. But today, when I taught Harry, I think something happened to my Patronus. It changed. I now have a stag… Is that normal?
“What. How... How did you know?” Did he remember something from his old childhood? It was really confusing to find out what Harry did remember and what he hadn’t yet figured out.
One of the people holding a seat spoke up. “You’re a Gryffindor; you can’t speak up for a Slytherin.”
Holding up his hands, Draco shook his head. “Oh no, bear. You just keep having fun! It’s really important that you laugh and play.”
He posed as a Muggle backpacker who had lost his way and needed some shelter. With that, he walked over the small hill that had a beautiful view of a small lake and saw the village he had wanted to find. Running his fingers through the dark brown hair, he sighed and shook his head. He wasn't even a little ready to meet the Chosen One. It had been so long since he had seen him and now... Well, there wasn’t another choice, he needed to this, if he wanted or not. It was his job and maybe he would have enjoyed it more to be hunting some crooked lawbreaker, but he was the Ministry’s best chance to find and bring back the Golden Boy.
“I’m so sorry, my brave little lion, I am so sorry for having to deal with her alone!” Draco said softly, and pressed him so tightly against his body, as if he was afraid that letting go meant Harry would leave him forever.
“Yes.” She sighed and emptied her cup. “Well, I must be going back. I just wanted to tell you to take care of him.” She smiled at Eric. “But I trust with a Haltija by his side, little Harry Potter is in good hands.”
This was what music was supposed to be. Pure feelings! He quickly moved his fingers over the keys, touching them as little as possible, flying over the pieces, while the base held everything together with a deep, beautiful rhythm.
Hermione nodded thoughtfully, before she grinned at him. “That was a direct quote from him, wasn’t it?”
Harry had to admit that he was a little too curious of what the questions were. They had never visited a couple’s therapy and maybe there was in fact some minor thing they needed to discuss, even though Harry doubted it. He loved his husband with all of his heart and there was nothing that could destroy their relationship.
When the animal disappeared, after even Draco got to pet it a little, Harry turned to Draco. “Do you want to know what I was thinking about?”
Harry laughed, taking another piece of Treacle Tart out of the basket, but hid it from Draco, even though they both knew he had seen it.
Ron literally screamed. It was so loud that Harry and Malfoy both jerked. Harry grinned at the Slytherin, who rolled his eyes. Ron’s excitement for the Aurors had never truly dimmed; he had only ever been scared of the entry exam. With it being eliminated, nothing stood in the way of him and a career with the Aurors. Harry was happy for him, though
“I said yes? What did I say yes to?” Luna jerked up and Ginny motioned to her hand, grinning. “Oh.” She giggled. “Yes, I did. What else would I say? I love Ginny!” The Gryffindor blushed and rolled her eyes, though the soft smile on her lips betrayed how she pretended to feel.
Harry chuckled and reached over the table, running his fingers along Draco’s jaw line. His eyes were so full of love and when he grabbed his hand and placed a kiss on the back of it, Harry couldn’t resist and smiled softly. All his fears that Draco would maybe want to divorce him after this week of ‘pretending’ were gone within a second. No, his husband wouldn’t go there. They were too much in love with each other.
“Dray!” Potter called out and a huge smile grew on his face, as he held out his tiny arms towards Draco. “I see good!”
For now, he had his hand on his leg and that was all he needed, next to the knowing smirk and his shining eyes. For now.
Harry hummed and pressed a gentle kiss on his temple. Theodore shook his head over their affection, though it didn’t seem as if he was against them. Maybe he just wasn’t entirely okay with public affection. Since, yes, most Slytherins had been taught not so show affection and love if there were a lot of people in the room. However, Harry didn’t seem to care. And Draco loved how Harry had no problem showing him how much he liked him. So yes, public showcase of affection was something Draco couldn’t get enough of. As long as it wasn’t inappropriate. And also as long as Severus wasn’t in the room.
For now, however, he needed to deal with Ginny and Padfoot. So he checked the map and saw that McGonagall was in the Great Hall. Walking there, he made sure to have all the important points ready in case she wanted to know why he would want to bring a dog to their reunion. He was somehow sure that she wouldn’t mind, though.
“I…” Draco started, closing his eyes and inhaling. Harry grinned. Oh no, he wasn’t getting a chance to compose himself, he was making sure of that. So, he leaned in kissed his jawline softly, moving his tiny kisses to his neck, where he stopped, determined to give him a huge hickey.
Harry glared at his friend and quickly hid the memory in one of the black boxes in his mind. Even if Neville had been amazing at Legilimency, nobody had ever been able to get into his mind after the war. Harry had finally been able to practice and master Occlumency with no pressure and with Draco’s help, he had been able to clear his mind in a matter of seconds so that only the words ‘Legilimens’ had to be spoken and Harry’s mind would be a blank space.
Blaise shook his head, still worriedly looking over at Harry. “I just heard that they broke into Gringotts, flew away with a dragon and broke into the Ministry, while the people there were actively hunting them. I mean… that’s craziness on a different level.”
Sorry for another chapter with the Injury parchment, I normally try not to have them back to back, but it is kind of important now, so here it is… Also, since I am already making a comment: THANK YOU! You are all awesome and I love how much you guys enjoy this story. You are awesome!
“You are so welcome, Mr. Potter. Enjoy the early evening” Hannah retorted and got up to take seat Harry was vacating. As quickly as she sat down, the three women were neck deep into theorizing who Draco’s wife was, all while Daphne winked at Harry.
Harry moaned in annoyance and threw the phone into the corner, where it vibrated again. Someone must have sent another text message. He wasn’t going to look at it.
Harry was on a complete different path, as he made fun of all of them, though quite clearly hiding his nervousness of what would happen after tonight.
Draco wasn’t able to say anything, as he had just seen the basilisk skeleton. He had heard a few rumors of what had happened. This was by no means what he had pictured. And Harry had been much smaller than he was now! A little boy had fought this beast?
“I do not like this triumphant look on your face” Potter suddenly said and smirked, when Draco focused on him again.
Pansy screeched and actually shouted for them to stop, while Ron grabbed Harry by his wrist and pulled him outside. Blaise cursed and Hermione had wide eyes, as if she didn’t believe Draco and him would actually want to hurt each other. She hurried after Harry, while he needed his entire focus on not bursting out laughing.
And so the night was spent watching all the movies they had brought with them and almost everyone falling asleep in front of the Muggle device. Only Draco was awake to watch the last movie, remembering how Harry had sat next to him when they had watched his favourite one together. Would that ever happen again after today?
“I don’t know” Draco answered, definitely not giving away his ward. “What in Merlin’s name happened?”
“Yes!” Harry laughed and grabbed Pansy’s hand to make her come as well. She was more than willing to follow him. Draco wanted to as well, though Hermione held him back a little.
The Gryffindor smirked and gestured at the rich buffet on the table. “Anything you’d like the most?”
He chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. “It just happens. People keep sniffing me out to tell me that they want one specific job and I just agree. For now, until I know what I’m doing.”
I am writing you today in hopes of repairing what little relationship we have left in this family. Your father is in Azkaban and it is highly probable that he will stay there until the end of his life for the crimes he has committed. My own family isn’t functioning much better as most people have either died or are staying in Azkaban as well.
The next chapter will have more actions again. I just really liked the idea of Draco getting letters from Harry’s parents :)
That could only mean one thing: Harry was inside. Draco’s suspicion was confirmed, when Weaslette shook her head, sighed and started talking.
Everyone who heard the Gryffindor turned to look at her, clearly surprised and she only shrugged and wished them a nice afternoon, heading back to the Ravenclaw table and taking a seat next to Luna.
“You know what?” Draco grinned at Weaslette. “I stand corrected” he said, while he ruffled through Potter's hair fondly.
Draco smirked. “I found some pre-made Polyjuice Potion from the Black family. I took that and went out then. Are you happy now?”
Draco knew that what he was going to say didn’t please Mr. Davis. His favourite person was Granger and he also had a soft spot for her husband. In addition, Granger was on her way to becoming the new minister, even if it would take a few more years. No one should be spying on them.
“Looking for Potter.” He said pointing at the official robe for the Ministry. “Official Ministry business.”
Eric frowned as Alamar smiled at the man. Wizards had no idea of creatures, did they? Werewolves weren’t monsters, they were protectors. Yes, they weren’t as strong as Haltijas and it might seem cursed if they had to transform into werewolves every full moon... but they were the best thing the wizards had been able to create.
That couldn’t have been the case, right? Draco shrugged his shoulders and bid goodbye, closing the door behind him, still trying to find a way for Harry to talk to him about what was bothering him.
However, Susan stared at her long-forgotten breakfast, as if it was telling her the answers to the biggest question of the universe. “In Merlin’s name” she whispered and then said a little louder: “You figured it out? How? We were so careful!”
Draco managed to clear he throat this time. He stared at Harry’s strong hand on his knees. “Harry, don’t you think…” His mind wasn’t working. Harry was to close. He could feel his warm skin through his pants and he tried to get some air into his lungs. Everything just smelled like cinnamon and roses.
“What?” Draco asked innocently. “I just want to tell you how much you mean to me. I want you to know how you make me feel… especially when you do this…”
“Hey, bear?” he asked Potter and saw him turn around and smile at him. “Do you want to look at the pictures?”
Hermione smiled at the headmistress and shrugged her shoulders. “Oh, nothing. It’s just a misunderstanding, right Harry?”
Potter didn’t seem to like him now that he had kind of left him with an uncomfortable kind of mess for so long. Not that Draco did care much. However now, Severus was actually sitting on a chair inside the playpen which was situated in McGonagall’s office, while baby Potter was crawling around him and sometimes even trying to stand up, holding on tightly to the Potion’s professor. He was behaving weirdly and Draco thought that there were some emotions on his face, which was definitely not true, right?!
“Well, I believe my lies, so until I’m out of Hogwarts, it’s all fine.” Draco was so in his argument with his godfather, that he hadn’t realised Harry was standing right next to him.
Harry laughed, when Draco placed his arm around his shoulders and pulled him closer. They walked down the corridor, Padfoot happily next to them with Olaf still on his head. And while they still had about twenty minutes left, before Fleur wanted them back, Harry thought she would probably be happier if they arrived earlier with Olaf still in one piece.
“No, no” she said. “Minerva simply stated not to interfere with whatever secrets are going on around the class reunion. I came to my own conclusions after the divorce lawyer screaming match.”
“Okai” Potter said and hugged his teddy bear again. Draco grinned and put his hair into a messy bun, effectively keeping it away from the toddler.
He looked up at Harry and shook his head. “Unlikely. Until a few decades ago, the Wizarding World was rather homophobic. There are incidences of wizards being thrown into Azkaban and other harsh punishments for their sexualities. I don’t think that this father would have allowed his daughter to be openly gay.”
When they walked outside, Draco opened the door towards the Common Room and turned around looking back at Harry who ran after him giggling. He suddenly stopped and widened his eyes. “Teddy!” he called out and was about to turn around, when his favorite toy appeared out of thin air right in his arms. “Teddy!” He grinned as he presented it to Draco.
“No, he’s not, Harry!” Ginny said vehemently and crossed her arms over her chest. “Just because you told the Aurors not to imprison Malfoy and them realizing that they totally forgot about him, doesn’t make it’s your mistake!”
For lunch, they went into a small restaurant, where Harry enjoyed the best chips and chicken cutlet he had ever tasted. It was so good, that he opted on never going away from here ever again.
Millicent seemed to agree: “Someone needs to keep you in check from actually killing his relatives.”
“Sure” his husband grinned and looked at the therapist. “So you know our names. What is yours then?”
“What are you talking about, Ron?! We talked yesterday!” Potter laughed and shook his head. “Hi Hermione, how are you doing?”
Frowning, Draco sat up straight again. What was Severus talking about? It sounded like a secret that he had wanted to keep a secret, but his mother had somehow figured it out…
When Eric finally stopped laughing, he was on his back, holding his stomach and had his eyes closed. “You’re terrible, Alamar.” He groaned as he got back up on his feet and grabbed the hot chocolate. “However, I must agree with Harry. Your hot chocolate is very good.”
Had she really just said that? Harry wasn’t sure if he had imagined her telling him what she was looking for. “It’s on the chair over there” he said, pointing at the poisonous green book cover innocently hiding between a few other Potions books.
Raising his eyebrows, Malfoy smirked. “It’s clearly your house, Potter” he motioned towards the wall. “It’s a Potter legacy. And also, you already have us all imprisoned in this house. Why would you want to keep us in a memory?”
“Not at all, Harry.” She took the time to smile at him, before she turned back to her knitting, where it looked like she had dropped a stitch and she was looking to recover it.
And what of that had he really done?! He had worked with the Aurors, gotten a lot of money and went drinking with his work buddies and Neville once every other week. He ate lunch with Ginny and Luna every Sunday and spent the evenings of whatever Sunday he didn’t have to work with Hermione’s and Ron’s family.
The last thing he heard was both men calling “Ew, Harry!” before they were out of earshot. Harry laughed and pulled Draco into a close hug.
Walking over, Harry placed a hand on her shoulder and got down on his knees. “He’ll understand. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but someday it’ll all make sense. Until then, I doubt he’ll walk away from you, because you don’t want to spend the night with him. He’s far too much in love with you.”
The worker had apparently also seen the owl and he shook his head. “Oh no; we have other barn owls as well. He’s a little on edge. We saved him from a rather traumatic owl breeder. He still has to recover from what they did to him. Over here we have…”
“If this door is going into the wine cellar and we’re breaking whatever bottle is down there, because we’re opening a secret door nobody was aware even existed, I will put this on you” Harry said with a suspicious twinkle in his eyes.
“We would volunteer at first, but once you’re making profit, I would like to get paid” Malfoy offered and smirked. “And I want to have an interview deal as well! I’d like to throw my father and everyone else under the bus and tell them how horrible it had been living with...
“We know, Ze!” Millicent grinned and grabbed a chocolate frog from wherever she had stored them and threw it at Blaise. “That’s why we’re not leaving him alone with you.”
Pansy huffed again and crossed her arms. “Okay, we had a date, it was nice. Still, I don’t date Gryffindors.”
It reminded Harry slightly of his last year at Hogwarts, where Draco had continuously gotten more and more angry the more time Harry spent in the Hospital Wing. At least, he then hadn’t needed to snuck somewhere: Draco had just come to visit him there, when everyone else was gone. These were still some of his favourite memories. It was going to be so hard to pretend Draco was only another former student here and not his husband...
Draco thought that his friends were slightly overreacting; however, Harry on the other hand chuckled. And his ward being at least somewhat happy made this comment worth it.
Harry got up. “What if Neville has to drag me out of here, because I want to run at you? There are still people outside, right?” he asked and his friend nodded.
Harry leaned over, capturing his lips in a kiss, prompting another ‘ew’ from Dominique, while Fleur said something to Bill, making him calm down his fake anger. “Of course,
Malfoy nodded. “They seemed to be so in love. But I agree; something dark is hovering over their happiness.”
He smiled happily and reached his arms out to pull Harry into a hug. The Gryffindor mumbled something incoherent, and placed his arms around him as well, pulling him even closer. Draco inhaled and nuzzled into Harry’s neck. He felt the Gryffindor move slightly and a soft kiss was placed on top of his head.
Acting on his instinct, he grabbed the other man, cupped his cheeks and kissed him. Potter was clearly taken by surprise, but relaxed after a second of initial shock. He felt him respond and his hand was on his chest, grabbing his jumper tightly.
Graeme looked over to the potion which was still as smooth as before. So, he turned to Draco. “Mr. Nemo, you have been offered the blood adoption to the Noble House of Snape. Do you accept your new responsibility to your adopted family?”
It was quiet, with everyone working silently or discussing something in a low voice, when the door to the Common Room opened and their head of house entered. “Good evening” he greeted his Snakes and Draco looked up to see him walking closer. He had a sort of annoyed presence around him and Draco frowned. Ever since the war he had somewhat stopped hiding his emotions under the pureblood mask.
Harry laughed and shook his head. He quickly downed his tea and gave Oliver a kiss. “Let’s get this over with.”
How are you doing? Listen, Ron and Hermione really want to talk to you and I decided to tag along to help you out. We’re here and we just want to talk. Please talk to us.
Harry quickly found a gap to cross the room and arrived in front of Draco only a second before his father did. “A dance?” he asked, holding out his hand.
She looked up from her desk and shook her head, though there was a small smirk on her face. “I’ll call Anita and let her know that you’re late again. You really have to get a watch, Harry! Your clients can’t wait forever and…”
Down in the cellar, Ron and Nott looked around almost as surprised as Harry and Malfoy had when they had first come down here.
His best friend didn’t seem to listen to him. “Of course not, Darling, but I want to do something special for him!”
“We went too far!” he said and looked at his best friend. “Sorry. Some things just can’t be fixed with a magic spell.”
“Not until I’ve decided to open a website. And I don’t think I’ll need it. Magic works in my way, I believe.” She winked at Harry who chuckled and waved goodbye as they left the store. Once again, Draco was focusing on the Golden Boy’s arms too much, before he got back to reality.
When he looked to the front, Draco caught Severus slightly disapproving look, though he quickly turned back to McGonagall who was in the middle of her speech about what all of them had gone through. And yes, they were the last students who had witnessed the Chamber of Secrets being opened; they were adults when the Battle of Hogwarts had happened… So yes. They went through quite a lot.
“Despite the fact that I always seemed to know who matched best with what person, I never seemed to be able to figure out who would be my partner. But with you by my side I finally know.”
“I’ll take my chances” Potter grinned and shrugged his shoulders. “I’m not that easily intimidated. Also, people who theorize about serial killers, usually tend not to be psychopaths.”
Potter smiled and shrugged his shoulders. “What do you do?” He then pointed outside to the people walking around in the village. “Almost everyone here has run away from things in their life. I just figured that maybe you did as well?”
Without a word, she passed the parchment to him and he read it through, growing even whiter with every line he read.
Children were the cutest thing there was. And Teddy also belonged to the group of absolutely gorgeous, happy children. Much like Harry had when he had been a child.
“Well” Harry smiled. “We have a small change in plan: The Minister just arrived and…” he interrupted himself when Henry scoffed and shook his head. Harry nodded; the Minister of Magic was only here for the publicity, everyone knew it. However, maybe after the cake cutting and the last few pictures, he would leave again. With such a high profile wedding, it was to be expected. “I have decided to move the cake cutting up to after the waltz right now. Everyone’s already informed and the photographer will stay longer to get some pictures without the Minister. No additional charge.”
“Whatever your uncle and aunt did to you when you were a child is clearly still deep in your bones! Sirius, if you don’t normalize your eating habits, I will send for my brother, and by that I don’t mean the pharmacist, but the psychologist, and I will make him visit you every day” Mr. Parker threatened even more. “You have one week.” With that, the doctor gave Potter some pills, grabbed everything and walked out, leaving Potter sitting on the table, staring into nothingness.
“What? No!” Harry called out, when Remus chuckled and agreed. He handed over Teddy, who looked at Draco with wide eyes, before running after Harry who had taken off as soon as Remus had agreed to the trade.
Draco stood there, debating whether or not he should wait to talk to her once the guests were gone again or if he should say ‘fuck the etiquette’ and they should talk right now, in front of them. The problem was rather simple: Once he would drink from the golden cup and Adélaïde would as well, they would be engaged. So…
Both Draco and Harry frowned slightly at each other, since this phrase alone was rather confusing, however, maybe a few more lines would explain what they were talking about.
Draco was curious. Well, curious and slightly nervous. Why had McGonagall told them to come to her office? The parchment which some first year Slytherin had given him, was too formally written to just be some sort of check up on Harry.
Turning to Theodore, Draco smirked. “Are you okay, Theo? Do you maybe want a few ideas for how you could get back at Harry?”
After a mock bow towards him, Harry pushed the book with some force into Draco’s chest, which made him cough. A few people’s muffled laughter could be heard as Draco tried to catch some air again, while he stared down Harry.
“But I’m his Magical Guardian! How am I supposed to be his guardian if I don’t know where he is?” Draco shook his head.
Draco sighed. “Well then, it’s not even nine in the morning, I might just go back to my room and sleep more.”
Boy didn’t understand. He rubbed his forehead and shrugged his shoulders. Luckily, he had help from Eric, who smiled and seemed to have the same kind of soft, welcoming eyes, though they were deep blue.
“It’s good team work” Harry chuckled. “I’ve heard Draco looks forwards to getting a good shower with some peace and quiet.”
Weasley still seemed to lack the knowledge and simply shrugged his shoulders. “Look, guys. I came here because you told me that you wanted to thank him for what he did for you. You all have owls... just write him a letter.”
“But it’s not even that important!” Harry wondered why he was so vehemently against visiting his old school nemesis. Maybe he really had changed. Why didn’t he want to believe that Malfoy was different? “He told me it’s just for Narcissa’s Christmas Masquerade Ball. After that, he was going back to his normal life. Why should I…”
Harry looked up and smirked. “Draco, you might have to hold off on cuddling, there are a few things that might be of interest.”
“I don’t know what you’re referring to, but this is your wand, Draco. I totally forgot about it and I’m sorry. But maybe you want it back now?” Harry seemed a little flustered, probably because he was really sorry for having forgotten it or because he was just too tired for it all.
It was okay for now. Maybe being tutored by Snape gave him another possibility to bond with him. Draco confirmed that he was happy with it and then looked curiously at Madam Pomfrey and Professor Sprout. He was briefly wondering why they had been here, when the mediwitch spoke up.
Smirking slightly, Draco took a plate next to his, which he had originally intended for the Savior and started eating again. It hadn’t taken him long to come up with the recipe, since it was the exact food he had eaten as a small child and the house elves had at one point told him what he needed to do to make it taste like that. “I added porcini and a little more lemon juice.”
Well, Draco couldn’t contain his laughter and he turned away from the water, when Harry charmed a little bit towards him. “It’s whiskey from the Scottish Highlands, Harry. It’s really good!”
“Okay, okay” Draco held up his hands and rolled his eyes. He glared at Harry, though this one wasn’t real, and sighed. “I’m sorry, Potter. You’re apparently still able to make my blood boil. It won’t happen again.” He then looked over to Hermione and smiled sweetly. “At least not for the next twenty-four hours.”
Harry stopped in his tracks and looked at the pan and then back at Draco. “It’s dinner time? Shit” he sighed and shook his head. “So I’m also losing track of time.”
Creature ruling were the first laws the wizards established after enslaving the Veelas and driving most of the free ones out of the country. It was supposed to ensure a peaceful coexistence of creatures and wizards, but ended up mostly on the Wizarding side, starting the stupid Ministry they had to deal with right now.
Once again, Neville laughed and nodded. “I’ll come wake you up by twelve, unless I see one of you down in the Great Hall.”
“Oh, I will.” Kevin laughed, while Harry walked down the hallway and waved Maria that he was out of the office again.
“You do, dear!” Molly said behind them. She hugged Harry and then also Blaise. “It’s nice to finally have an adult face to go with that name!”
Draco walked into the Common Room the next day to find Harry sitting there, quietly reading a book and tapping his feet to some music – in his head. As if Harry had heard him, he looked up and smiled broadly.
“Maybe a little” Draco answered and smirked. Who really understood this stupid topic anyway? Well, except for Theodore who seemed to be natural and Hermione who was studying day and night for this course apparently.
He had been standing there in the dark for a little while, before he realized that he had been too deep in his own head. So he took out his wand and lit up the wooden staircase. His wand was so easy to work with, it was as if it was reading him and just reacting to the thought he had. As he climbed the next few steps, turning around one hundred and eighty degrees, he stopped on the platform and frowned. The stairs hadn’t begun in the middle of the house. There should have only been one way to go from the stairs to the house and that was by going up the stairs and turning three hundred and sixty degrees. So why was he now standing on a platform – with a door! – where no door should have been.
Sighing, Draco looked at the parchment again, finding another one behind the one from Lily Potter. This one was signed by Potter’s father. Inhaling deeply, Draco dove into the writing of James Potter.
“Padfoot!” Harry called out and tried to push him of him or stop licking him. He was unsuccessful with both and ended up rolling over which made his service dog finally sit down. “Hello, my darling.”
Surprisingly, Remus was the one who answered. “The furniture was alive in this story. And this wardrobe does look rather lively.”
“Don’t be sorry” Draco responded and pressed a kiss on the top of his head. “We all have our own demons haunting us. Just promise me one thing.”
Harry bit his lower lip, but then settled on just asking: “If – theoretically – I wanted to ask someone out... How would I do that best?”
Pansy smiled at baby Potter and then turned to Draco. “How does he hate me? Look, he’s happy to be around us!” She continued holding the bottle for Potter, before she looked up again. “I’ve read in a book about the Granian Hair that memories are only gradually returning, so…”
He didn’t have to say anything. Harry started to talk without being told to do so or even asked. “I can’t believe I lived through a war, Draco.”
He yawned and pulled away slightly. “Why?” He really didn’t want to confront Hermione with the fact that she had given him a love potion that was supposed to make him fuck his husband like they were rabbits. Though maybe, on second thought, that would make a nice evil discussion. She would most likely turn red like a tomato – though he would too. Maybe Draco could hold that discussion, he was still able to pull off that emotionless mask. To watch that discussion would have been glorious.
This made Fleur look up from talking with Dominique and shake her head. “Oh, I’m not scared. I know Bill loves me – even if it’s not the same level of love you show each other, I know I have his heart.”
Grinning, his husband climbed over the small rim, before he fell into the water, creating a wave and completely wetting Harry. He looked down at his soaked shirt and then at Draco who appeared a little further away from him, smirking. Harry barked out a laugh and shook his head, making the water fly everywhere from his wet hair.
There was a full page of all the different potions St. Mungo’s had tried on him. Harry had written all of them in a neatly order and added all the different side-effects he’d had or just the fact that he had felt nothing at all. If this hadn’t been Harry’s life he was investigating, this booklet would have been a very good research paper on the effect on whatever curse he had gotten.
He could tell that Harry was listening for something, when he raised one eyebrow and looked around the room. Apparently, he had heard them, as he widened his eyes and grinned. “Sure, let’s go.”
Since I have given you updates every day now, I have to take a break (I haven’t been able to write anything! Well, except for this two-parter chapter, because I thought you were really liking them now instead of in 10 chapters). So, I think I won’t be posting anything for about 5 days, unless I feel the need to give you another chapter. But I’m quite tired now and I have a few things to figure out and research.
“Let’s do this, my love. They’re in the Common Room, we can make them scared one last time” Draco confirmed and smiled, before he pulled back and motioned Blaise to follow him. Harry was going to wait a few more minutes, before he was going to disturb the peace with Olaf. Hopefully, that was going to go well.
And well, who had the time to study, when you had to take care of a child day and night?! If he wanted to study as much as Hermione would, next to taking care of Harry… he probably had to ignore sleep for an entire school year to catch up to this stupid topic.
Draco sighed and showed the letter to his two friends. Pansy read over it, carefully and even Harry had narrowed eyes as he looked at it.
My ears are hurting a little, but other than that, I feel great. I went to say hi to Ginny and she was losing her mind, but she quickly brought me home. No need to overdo it, right? Apparently, she read somewhere that if you’re dying, it could happen that your body pulls all the strength left together for a few final memories.
“Oh no, the Gryffindors!” he said and sat down next to Pansy. “I mean, we could just head back again, if you want?”
Albus held up his hand, already over the long monologue Severus was giving away like free candy. Yes, this sixth year Weasley boy was a little obsessed with these animals, but he didn’t want to know anything. Children were just trouble makers without real ideas.
Pansy smiled and placed a hand on her shoulder. “Don’t worry. You’re somewhat okay. But how can you stay around him?”
Draco had even been able to see Pansy’s and Neville’s amused expressions as they turned around the next corner. At least they didn’t take it badly.
Swallowing hard, Draco shrugged his shoulders as nonchalantly as he could. “I have a lot of fears, bear. One would be that you’re not able to fall back asleep now. Have you checked the time?”
Malfoy chuckled. “I was really into the reading and studying of sentient objects. I even tried creating one myself, though it never worked, and I have actually never seen a sentient object quite like this house.”
Draco nodded, though he looked like he didn’t believe Harry’s reasoning completely. “You know, if you fought in a war with someone, it tends to bring people together.” He smiled softly as he seemingly thought of something. “My grandfather had a friend who was by no means a wizard. They fought together in the Second World War, even though the Ministry tried to keep the wizards away from it. These two were so different, yet whenever they met; it was like they were brothers.” He looked back at Harry. “My grandfather told me not to put faith in people’s names, but in their actions. I think I had forgotten that for the past few years.”
Harry silently nodded, about to say something when McGonagall appeared in front of them. “Good morning. Once you’ve finished your breakfast, I would like to see Mr. Potter in my office.” And with that she was gone again.
This room definitely wasn’t what Draco had imagined, which meant there was someone else in here, already using the room.
. They hadn’t gone through the same thing Ron, Hermione and he had. And even though Hermione had her own problems right now and told them, that after the messy break-up she and Ron had, she didn’t want to see the two of them right now, Harry still received and wrote her letters. Ron would have probably listened to his weird feelings, but he didn’t want to involve him as well. And so, by the time he had reached the door, Nott and Malfoy were already trying to enter with force and all kinds of magic.
Harry felt Malfoy walk closer and he quickly stood behind him. “Everything here is giving me a weird vibe” the Slytherin commented and walked inside where he carefully brushed some dust off a glass case in which a magical quill seemed to be dancing around.
Draco decided to take a detour and buy some of this homemade bread he liked but was way too expensive for an everyday use. He needed to celebrate this.
“I didn’t make it explode” Harry smirked. “It just happened. Out of nowhere. It’s almost like it was
Nodding, Draco followed Potter into the kitchen, where he saw pancakes, bacon, eggs and bread. Before he could stop himself, he looked at Potter, frowning. He, on the other hand, rolled his eyes.
Draco laughed and freed himself from his husband’s loving embrace. “Not nearly as much fun, though.”
“Morning, Connor” Harry called out and grinned at the mail boy. “If you have some mail, just leave it there. I’d like to go back to bed with Draco. I’m closed today.”
Harry found that it didn’t only help his students in DADA; but also in Care of Magical Creatures. Hagrid had told him how his students were much more relaxed in front of even big and scary creatures. They seemed to have realized that sometimes you needed to understand a creature. Which didn’t only translate to creatures, but also to humans. However, they did have a few more years to figure that out.
Now, however… Draco realized what a bad history Harry had. All the ideas Draco had… the mediwitches had had as well and they were all documented as messed up failures in this leather bound book. This was going to be a fun ride...
Harry could tell Draco was about to say something, though they were interrupted by Blaise appearing next to the castle entrance. “There you are!” he called and ran over to them. “Come on, Draco. We’ll have to pretend that you hate Harry.”
“At least we can confirm that they were wizards” Malfoy commented and pointed at the words ‘magical marriage contract’. “They must have been in love and had to hide it.”
Draco shared a look with Pansy, before he pulled both legs up on the couch and crossed them – fairly unlike a pureblood should do, but exactly what Pansy was doing as well. Not that he cared. “Well, if the Aurors ask, we were all here at Hogwarts.”
“Can I tell you something?” Harry asked after he took the first sip of his perfect hot chocolate. When Alamar nodded, Harry continued still grinning. “You make the best hot chocolate.”
“They do have an appointment with a couple’s therapist” Blaise said, though he was quickly interrupted by Ron.
Ron frowned at them and chuckled. “Don’t you think that other Aurors might have tried it like that before?”
“So, how can I help you then?” she asked, still grinning and sat up properly, placing the invitation on the table. “You know, besides you not knowing what to do with the invitation.”
Harry grinned and pretended not to realize. “Thank you, Minerva.” He grabbed a bottle of Swiss mountain apple juice and went back to the table, sitting down next to an empty space. Theodore seemed to be the only one noticing something weird, though he didn’t say anything and Harry was absolutely not going to spoil his fun by revealing what was going to happen soon.
“So you jumped in right after me?” Harry burst out laughing. His laughter echoed from the walls and Millicent looked around slightly scared. Pansy had joined Harry’s laughter though not as loud.
It was quiet for a while, where everyone watched the TV. There were three police officers arriving and making some quite inappropriate jokes over the victims they had found in that house.
No, this was him. His life wasn’t a movie. It wasn’t a story someone else told him to write. This was his life and it had been his choice not to get married. His life was already messed up, he didn’t need to take anybody else down with him. And definitely not that girl. She seemed sweet and maybe, under other circumstances, he would have made friends with her, but he couldn’t have married someone. Especially not now.
Harry grinned and nodded. “Absolutely, Sir. I don’t think I could accept this responsibility before twenty-five. So I appreciate this.”
Wait. Was he the one who was oblivious? How long had Malfoy been talking to him and he hadn’t noticed the way he looked at him? Had this been going on since they had all come back to Hogwarts? Did he even feel the same?
“That she is.” Harry smiled down. Her thin blond hair made it almost impossible to see and she did look as if she had some kind of glow around her. She had quite clearly gotten Draco’s good looks. “She hasn’t yet been angry or mad at anybody. Kyle tried to poke her a few times...”
Harry nodded and helped his husband up, before he looked over to the other Gryffindor. “You’re a hero, Neville.”
Draco chuckled. “If you don’t tell him where you got them, I think he would jump into the air out of joy.”
Draco nodded. “Will you promise me to come and find me should there be some weird memory or something which is hurting you?”
“No!” Harry sighed. “Fine. I’m not around him, because… I don’t know what to do with myself around him.”
She nodded and sat down, before she pulled out a piece of parchment. She looked over it, frowning and turned back to them. “Well, I’m slightly confused, quite frankly. I received a letter from Theodore Nott claiming that a certain Mister Potter and Mister Malfoy were having extreme marriage problems.”
Granted, there were some months without any incident, however, the months with accidents or events were getting more and more worrying. At three years old, he already showed signs of malnourishments?! Six months later he was hit unconscious which included a mild concussion and nobody seemed to care?!
Draco shook his head, unable to believe that his own godfather would use such a potion against him. He couldn’t contain what he was about to say, so he just glared at Severus, while he started to speak again. “It’s the best thing I got so far. He hates me probably and...”
Placing the drinks for table four on the tray, Potter grinned. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
While Draco accepted a piece of lemon cake, Mrs Williams started talking. “We are all very protective of Sirius Evans” she said and looked at him sternly. “If you had any intentions, I would just like you to know that unless they were pure and clear, we’re protecting him fiercely.”
Freeing himself from the snow, Draco faced his ward, who was laughing loudly over having just hexed Draco with the spell he had shown him when he was a child. Looking at his friend, Draco nodded at Blaise and they both charged at Harry.
“Oh.” Harry stared at the parchment, trying to find a solution for this problem. He found one rather quickly. “Well, this is a magical kitten that can eat chocolate. And it also shows Ravo the way out of the forest!”
“Sure” Harry beamed. He almost opened his mouth and sarcastically stated ‘like the fact that you guys have a bingo sheet on mine and Draco’s relationship’ though luckily restrained himself from saying it or everything would have been revealed. Now was not the time to give them hints. Now was the time to make them suffer!
The bathtub filled with warm water, surrounding them both, while Draco took care of every inch of skin on his body until he was a mess in his husband’s loving embrace.
Draco was not going to give away Pansy who had dressed him in it and the rest of Slytherin apparently wasn’t giving away that Draco called Potter bear so the costume was matching everything. Severus frowned and looked around, however, when he saw that nobody was talking, he turned back to Potter. Since Draco’s ward wasn’t showing any signs of hate for the costume, Severus shrugged his shoulders. “Alright, don’t tell me then. Just don’t go to the play date with a dressed up Potter.”
“I mean… yeah” Harry shrugged his shoulders. “If that would mean that I could hug and kiss you whenever I want to. But I also want to continue this game, make them suffer for a bit longer…” He frowned and looked at his husband. “You’re being a bad influence, darling.”
“Are you talking to me?” Ginny asked from the door. Harry laughed and sat up, looking over to the redhead in a Muggle tracksuit which fit her rather well. She had a bottle of wine in her hand and two glasses in the other. “You’re talking to the dog, aren’t you?”
Ginny chuckled and shook her head. “Not really, Harry. You always were able to get around him. It was your aunt and uncle and then Voldemort who made your early life a living hell, not a small school bully.”
Draco sighed and accepted the letter. “I can’t believe that this statement would actually make me look at the letter now. That would be the best possible letter I could receive. How sad it that?”
Well that was easily said… Especially since a few weeks ago, the hatred for what Harry had done to him was burning like a wild fire. And now… just like that. It was gone. Harry speaking about it, acknowledging that he had made an almost deadly mistake and saying sorry had made it all go away. Like a sand castle in a rising flood.
I will be there, don’t worry. And yes, there might be something going on between me and him. I won’t pressure Draco to come along, but maybe he will. Thanks anyway. And if you want you can come by tomorrow night, I already have a tree, if you want to put decorations up? Luna’s welcome as well.
“No, Mr. Evans, that is not an option” Draco narrowed his eyes and tried to get out of Potter’s grasps. After a solid minute of fighting the Gryffindor, he relented and placed his forehead on Potter’s shoulder.
Draco looked after his ward, hoping that there would be something they could deal with. He really wanted his ward back, the laughing, happy child he had known ever since… well since the beginning actually.
Frowning, Draco watched Potter a little closer. Had he ever not jumped at the idea of bickering and fighting with him? This feeling of… not arguing with Potter was new. And he didn’t like it. Draco looked at the curtains on the ground, barely touching the stone and moving softly in the nightly breeze from wherever that wind came from.
All of this made Draco smile weakly. He needed to address the most important thing first: “You are my family, Harry. Don’t worry. As much as Pansy and the others are my family now, I’ll count you to these idiots as well.”
“It must be hard” she said and turned back one more time to the beautiful plaques, almost shining in the afternoon sun. “Some nights, I get nightmares about the fight.” She looked at him, inspecting him. “It must be much harder for you.”
It wasn't even hard anymore to pretend to glare at him. It was hard however, to keep a straight face when Draco returned the look.
Daphne narrowed her eyes and shook her head, as if she couldn’t believe what he was saying and doing. She had witnessed Draco and Harry being the most happily married couple alive – as she had once called them – and thus seemed to be all the more confused by their action. Served her right, Harry thought.
Malfoy frowned at him and raised his eyebrows shortly after. “With you? Like a date? Absolutely not. I’m not
That was, until the seven year old Harry put his hand on Draco’s arm and smiled at him wisely. He luckily hadn’t heard the whole conversation, just the last few sentences. “It doesn’t matter what people think of you, Dray. It’s important that you like yourself.”
“Yes!” Harry beamed at him. Though before they could continue, Theo entered the Common Room and dragged them outside again to the lake where they had put down a fort of warming charms and enjoyed the rare afternoon sun. Neither Draco nor Harry could refuse. The story had to wait for another day.
. Ron had his arms around Nott’s neck and the Slytherin had his hands under Ron’s shirt. They seemed to have used all the time for only one thing…
Draco groaned. “I really don’t know what to do with the invitation! We both know Mother has another date set up for me during these celebrations.” He sighed. “She does have amazing taste, but it’s not mine. Her men are all so… so…”
Her voice was almost begging for some truths. However, Harry couldn’t tell them. He was having too much fun with pretending to hate his husband and in all fairness; neither Ron nor Hermione had told him about the secret bingo game that was going on with their relationship. So, he didn’t really feel the need to tell them what was going on – at least not now.
Again (in my opinion), you’re missing out with this song. The original (German) is so beautiful that I highly recommend, you check it out. Original title: “Maria durch ein Dornwald ging” Also one of my favorite songs :)
Draco grinningly interrupted his ward as well. “…of being a dick to anyone who’s not in your favorite house.”
“We’re sorry, Minerva. It won’t happen again” Harry answered, though Draco made the book fall onto Harry’s fingers right that second.
“There are rumors going around in the teacher’s lounge” Severus continued and chuckled. “I honestly think it’s a little untactful to talk about student’s relationships. Well, it’s the Golden Boy, now isn’t it?”
“Good morning Remus, you seem to have had a nice night” Draco smirked and Remus sighed, shaking his head.
Harry apparently didn’t care, as he was laughing loudly and the Boggart exploded with a loud snap. Luckily, Teddy was in his soundproof bubble, so he didn’t wake up.
Madam Pomfrey nodded. “Yes, it’s easier and much less hurtful to a child than working with High Magic. This will tell us everything that happened to him in this age and we can see how old he is. Children tend to fall out of trees or scrape their knees often. Once he can speak normally, we can also just ask him, how old he is. For now, I believe this is much more helpful.”
He turned around to his friend and shook his head. “It’s always me who has to do the work, huh?” he grinned at Harry. “Come on, Potter. Let’s do our job, while these two love-birds do whatever.”
The boy widened his eyes and he shook his head. “You can’t do that! Only Prefects and Head boys and girls can take points! And he’s torturing Harry Potter!” Cambell pointed an accusatory finger at Draco.
“Draco, are you staying the whole night? It’s Christmas, mate!” Harry leaned at the half-opened door and frowned. Draco sat there, hunched over his desk, clearly not going anywhere tonight. His shirt was crumpled and his tie was open. Harry shook his head. “The Weasleys have invited you as well. And I’m pretty sure Ginny would love to go and talk to you about how bad of a team you have.” He smirked and found Draco chuckling.
Harry widened his eyes and turned to Draco. “We can do that?” he whispered. Draco shrugged his shoulders.
“Orbis Luminis” he whispered and an orb of pure light started glowing and floated towards the black, mysterious hole. Nott groaned frustrated, as if he hadn’t even thought of that. It passed the invisible wall and the house seemed to shiver as it did. The orb of light illuminated the inside of the giant gaping hole at the side of the house. Inside the hole was a small room that seemed to be in chaos. Parchments were lying on the floor, tables were unturned, the old arm chairs were having tears and the stuffing of pillows lay everywhere.
Harry chuckled. “I showed him the exit. And I may have taken the memory of where exactly to find us. He thought Lily was his granddaughter.”
Harry stared at his parchment, grimly. Without looking up or any action actually, he stated: “I might have as well.” He then turned to face his guardian. “Good night, Draco.”
Shaking his head, Harry pulled her arms of him and grinned. “I would never hide from you! I’m pretty sure you’d be able to find me wherever I’d go.”
Pansy stepped next to Draco and looked after the Gryffindors, before shrugging her shoulders and grabbing Draco. “I’m sure he’ll have no idea why they were looking for him and what he should do with the information. It’s not as if they had been doing this for the past… eight years” she smirked as they followed Blaise and Theodore through the dungeon.
Groaning, Harry fell through the door of the Room of Requirement. Everything looked cozy, though he didn’t care one bit. His body tried to make him turn around, walk away from this hiding place. It took everything in his power not to let that feeling dominate.
Nodding, Harry pulled Draco down onto the couch and put his arms around him, so Draco was now leaning against Harry’s chest. “He does care about me, Draco. During the battle, I saw him being attacked and he gave me his memories, thinking he wouldn’t make it. I wasn’t going to let him die, so I held his wound closed and Hermione grabbed everything she had to fix it – the Muggle way. Ron was keeping the vial steady, just in case. And we succeeded in saving him.” Harry smiled weakly. He pressed another gentle kiss on Draco’s forehead, before he continued. “That was shortly before Voldemort gave us a little break. I went up to Dumbledore’s office, looking into Severus’ memories, while Hermione cared for him and Ron went to look for his own family. In the end, I only figured out that I had to die with Severus’ memories. And he actually was against that the whole time.”
Before he could say something, Harry followed his example, creating a Patronus himself. They both galloped through the dark night, over the lake and the two lovers watched them for a short while, until Draco finally said what he had on his mind.
Maria laughed and accepted the coffee. “You are terrible, Harry! How was the wedding though, did you enjoy it?”
“I never thought of it that way...” Draco frowned, looking at Harry. He wondered what he went through in this year on the run.
“Do you know what this star represents?” he asked as Harry turned to him. Following Draco’s gesture, Harry looked up at the stars and seemed to have found the brightest star in the sky.
“No.” That was the only good thing coming out of this stupid situation. “Madam Pomfrey said that since we did a good job in raising him, he won’t really have any memories of it. He just had a little problem with people touching him...”
Not that Draco cared much. He was sure that he was much happier now. Seeing how all his friends stuck together, Harry helping in distracting him with homework or some other things he quite clearly didn’t need help, but asked for it anyway, all of this was amazing. And in all honesty, who would want to be a ‘Malfoy’ anyway?!
“Yeah, mate!” Ron shook his head, agreeing with his wife. “You’re throwing away a perfectly fine relationship! I don’t know why people would want to marry Malfoy, but…” he jerked, turned to look at his wife, accusingly and rubbed his behind. Hermione had most likely thrown a stinging hex at him.
“But I have no idea of pureblood culture and all that stuff.” Harry tried to find another reason for why this couldn’t be true, though failed spectacularly. In all honesty, he was glad he failed. He couldn’t get enough of this soft and loving Draco right in front of him.
Potter widened his eyes and nodded suddenly, grinning broadly, visibly feeling better. Draco was happy that he seemed to relax. “Okay, let’s try this.” He grabbed his wand and pointed it at his friends. “
“Yeah, that convinces me.” Draco chuckled and looked at Harry who had by now managed to build one tiny mud...man.
When they finally reached to ground floor, Alamar walked through a living room that was almost four times the size of the Dursley’s living room and they finally stood in the kitchen. The kitchen had everything: A huge island with a cooking area, two fridges, though one was probably a freezer and even a small bar area.
His husband shook his head. “No, I’m serious! Shoes are for the outside! Walking on the street, the grass, wherever you go. When you’re out hunting for whatever old dusty books, you go to some nasty places, Harry! I don’t want any of this dark magic shit in our house, not to mention our bedroom! We have Teddy over twice a week; he doesn’t need to be greeted by this kind of magic.”
Harry snorted weakly and turned back to Draco. “Sorry for scaring you in the Common Room.” There was something in his eyes. Draco was sure that he didn't imagine it. Something was going on. If Pansy was right... Draco didn't know what exactly was going on. Or rather, he didn't dare to hope.
“Hey” Harry managed softly as he stumbled a few steps back, his arms wrapping around his husband tightly. “Are you okay?”
Tonight seemed to be a slow night as only two other creatures were in sight: a Veela, doing business with a goblin, and a man who seemed to have been turned into a werewolf only a few days ago and had no idea what to do next. Eric could feel the pain surrounding the man. He seemed to be so lost, as if his entire life was crashing down around him. Actually, there were four goblins surrounding him and trying to help out.
Draco smiled weakly. “I know, bear, I know. Maybe we can find some spell that would conceal it? But let me tell you something: I like this scar on you. It makes you unique. It shows your beautiful soul. You are one in a million.”
Draco stared at the booklet and then back at the baby who was by now asleep. He groaned in defeat. “Okay. How long is this going to take?”
Draco frowned, remembering all of what he had read on the Injury Parchment and tried to somehow write a better story about it… “Yes, he always helped her, but Mama Penguin made sure he had a lot of fun. One day, Ravo decided that he wanted to go to school as well and he packed his little bag with…”
Draco chuckled and shook his head. “The standard charms are pretty useful. Though, not when you’re trying to make yourself unknown to a person with a close relationship.”
“What?” Ron widened his eyes. “No! Nothing’s wrong between… we’re good. It’s… I mean… Look” he sighed and shook his head. Harry tried his hardest to look concerned rather than burst out laughing and tell him what he and Draco had been planning. No – this was too good to stop.
Harry opened the letter rather quickly, while the owl flew away. The others looked over his shoulders as he read the letter quickly, hoping that Ginny didn’t tell any secrets.
Olivia smiled at him and it was the sweetest smile, she was probably capable of. “We were actually hoping to earn some money here. So, if it’s not too much to ask, we’d like to work as much as possible.”
Evelyn laughed. “Lucas had taken Sirius under his wings and shown him everything around here. They had spent so many days together that people had been joking they were practically married. Lucas would have immediately turned away, if Sirius hadn’t told everyone that he was in fact gay, but not in love with him. Ever since then, they sometimes joke about marrying in a few months.”
McGonagall nodded and smiled. Harry was sure she knew he wasn’t telling the truth, however, she seemed to politely ignore it. “That was a very wise decision.” She motioned to a little desk in the corner of the room which had two chairs along with it. “Should we sit down? I have something very important to tell you.”
Draco help up his baby bible – Madam Pomfrey’s booklet – and started reading out a passage he had read this morning. There were other things in there, but since Pansy had asked about his daily routine, he could just as well read what he had learnt.
She nodded and got up to get some ingredients. Meanwhile, Draco looked at Harry who was sitting at the table, looking at the same colourful painting which Charlie had looked at a few moments earlier.
“What Draco thinks” Harry quickly explained and smirked. “I couldn’t care less, honestly. Well, unless he wants Padfoot.” He looked over his shoulders, where his dog was playing with his favorite teddy bear again. Though as he heard his name, he stopped and looked up, Harry grinned at the dog.
“I thought you might” Harry chuckled. “For the mean time, though, we need to come up with a few smaller things.”
Harry checked the time and apparently decided to get up, but Draco held him down and climbed on top of him, laying his head down on his chest. Chuckling, Harry put his arms around him. “It’s probably Connor, Draco. I need to open the door, otherwise he’s just going to continue knocking.”
He was sure that if Padfoot had been able to talk, he would have called out ‘Olaf, old friend, I haven’t seen you in years!’ Though as if was right now, he could only happily sniff the cage and make a happy sound. Even Olaf seemed to relax further as he found his old friend outside of his cage.
