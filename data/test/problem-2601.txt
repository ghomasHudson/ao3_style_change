After covering him in a sheet, not bearing the sight of his wasted frame, he pressed his fingers into his eyes and tried to organise his thoughts into something helpful.
Harry narrowed his eyes and peered over at Malfoy. “Are you shagging Neville?”
“I’m here.” He said, his smile soft, walking to the edge of Draco’s bed and sitting on the floor.
He was relieved not to be expected to participate in the conversation aside from vapid ‘mhmms’ and ‘ahhs’, and was particularly grateful that he had something to do with his hands. The kitchen was pleasantly warm and softly lit by the setting sun streaming in through the misted windows. He let the calm chatter and fragrant air wrap around him like a blanket as he went through the process of preparing dinner.
Harry grunted, chewing the inside of his lip. He hadn’t quite worked through all the worrying about Draco wanting to see patients there still, but Hestia had told Harry to trust her to make sure it’s safe. And he did. He had to. Trust was part of the process. An annoying and vulnerable part.

______________
Harry’s brow furrowed. Edgar was looking up at him, mouth half ajar, visibly trembling in his half untied shoes.
“So, you see, that’s why we’re not together. Why we can’t be.”
His flurry of post-its, evidence of his threadbare sanity, had long since been cleared away in the days after Harry’s arrival. His desk was ordered and clean now, neat post-its lining the wall in front of him. Scattered among his own affirmations were a few with untidy, familiar writing.
Harry smiled and looked down at their hands.
And Draco raised his hand and cut him off. “No, Harry. Your skin. What did you do to it?”
. No need to panic. He trusted Harry. That ardent look of adoration and adulation from him was enough to make Draco want to fight all of his tendencies to flee.
His hair now significantly shorter, he strolled up the walk to Beatrice’s office and prepared himself for what he was sure to be one hell of an appointment.
“Fine. I’m fine.” Draco assured, too quickly. Greg laughed.
Draco didn’t know what to say. He partially felt that his desire to perform the magic was hugely self serving, and that Harry and their friends were doing him a big favour by humouring him. He realized his silence had gone on too long when Harry squeezed his hands, looking for a response.
“I know you think this is just us in isolation, that I’ll be someone else once we leave. But, Draco, this is me. This is who I’ve always wanted to be. It’s with you I feel at home. I know who you are. I know what’s between us. I can feel it, and I can wait until you’re ready.” Harry was so close to him now, their noses nearly touching, Harry’s hand reaching up to brush the soft blonde hair from Draco’s face.
He thought. “I mean, emotional turmoil might be a bit dramatic—” Draco tried, but Luna raised her hand in reproach.
Harry was trying to find a way to describe the life force that was required to form a corporeal patronus. It was as though he had to send it with a part of himself. A part that kept him alive. Harry had thought that this was why it had taken him so long to be able to do the spell while his magic was returning. For so long, he had only had so little to keep him going, he couldn’t spare any. He had held it too closely, for fear of it leaving him again.
Another footstep, closer this time— they were coming down the hall. He was just deciding to apparate away when a voice broke the tense silence of the house and he nearly jumped out of his skin.
Harry walked in a short while later while Draco was packing his research notes.
“Where did everyone go?” He asked as he surveyed the area, looking for signs of a long black tail swishing and listening for a rustle of leathery wings.
Closing his eyes, he felt the talisman in his pocket. He pressed it into his palm, feeling its familiarity and safety radiate up his arm in recognition. In his other pocket, his fingers brushed against a worn post-it. Words faded over the last few weeks.
A sinister tremor reverberated through Harry, courtesy of the house’s antique wards, awakening as his hand rested on the front door. His fingers traced the ornamentation carved deep into the ironwood, smoothed with time yet still razor sharp with spells of the Black forefathers, a forest scene. He watched the wood awaken to him, thestrals pawing the ground, their heads held high, nostrils flaring in anxiety. The hawthorn and blackthorn trees rustled as the charmed beings unfurled their colossal wings, beating them fretfully, as if in preparation to take flight. Beneath the trees, tangled within the roots,
“You know, Draco,” Neville began, hesitating, “have you ever thought about seeing a mindhealer?”
“Well, my thestral’s name is fucking Fleabag. Because I’m a poor, uncultured
“It’s fine.” He waved her off, not meeting her eye. He knew Gryffindors were too noble to gossip, and Ron had assured him that while they worked on his testimony, everything was confidential. Magically binding. “It’s not like it won’t be common knowledge in a few weeks time anyways.” He said defeat evident in his voice.
He was hashing out a new idea about the thestral's capacity for helping the cultivation of new life. Inspired as he was by Luna’s gift to him and Harry. He was thinking about the thestral cave. About their nests and the luminescent algae, soft and ethereal. He was wondering about their birthing rituals, their mating habits. There was so much he didn’t yet know— so much to learn about these beautiful creatures.
Harry rested his palm flat against one of the heavy brass knockers, a twisting berg adder that squirmed beneath his hand. He felt the layers of magic of the pureblood relic, thrumming with an unrepentant animosity. They knew, as he did, that he didn’t really belong. The snake hissed softly, but without his magic, he wasn’t sure what it had said.
“I don’t feel any remorse.” He insisted, wanting Harry to understand. “I’m not upset with Voileami, with any of them. I’m relieved.”
He was thinking too hard about the day ahead. A thrumming crescendo of panicky anticipation crashing through him in regular intervals like waves on a battered coast. Relentless. Persistent.
“I’ve been thinking—” Draco repeated, still softly, not really sure how to articulate his whirring thoughts.
So, it would have to be Hermione. She would be heartbroken, but, ever the practical witch, she would find a way to carry on, she would know this burden was too much, she would know how long he had carried it. How long he had carried them. He needed rest. And quiet. She would understand.
“Do you promise not to laugh if I tell you? I’ve been thinking about it for weeks. Ever since your patronus. But… I can’t tell if it’s a stupid idea or not.” Harry scrunched up his face, obviously uncomfortable with the idea that he was about to put himself out there.
His tone was pleased and amused. Draco was smiling into his tea. “Yes. It really was.”
Harry scanned the crevasse before him, teetering on the edge of the descent, several more thestrals calling in the crisp air, their shrill screams distinct from Flea’s. Harry caught sight of rustling movement, flashes of dark wings beneath the dense trees in the centre of the valley, a place oddly devoid of the same carpet of thick snow as the ridge line above. Harry steadied himself and began to wend his way down to the exposed rock, his feet slipping along the steep embankment, loose stones and gravel skittering away from his boots, down into the forest below.
Flea ducked from beneath Harry’s arm and spread his wings wide, lifting off into the sky.
At the end of that first year, she had resigned from the Ministry herself, and, in September of the following year, she had strode up the same familiar path, covered in fallen leaves and with hints of early morning frost, to the entrance hall of Hogwarts. She had started her new post right alongside Harry, parchment and quill already in hand, fully committed to her new assignment.
Harry looked up at him. “You believe that?” He asked.
“Well, when someone wants to talk about magic or something wizard related we just use metaphors. Works really well once you get the hang of it. Muggles just think we’re
“If he was bound to you and the house, then how was he able to leave the night he died?” He ran his fingers hard through his hair, his voice low.
Harry stepped around to Draco’s right, watching him worry his lip slightly between his teeth, a line appearing between his brows. He was concentrating too hard, just as Harry had when he first tried. He was seeking, searching, happiness being such an unfamiliar place, a foreign land to them both.
The cold followed him in, and the howling wind, the fire extinguished. The laughter died. Heads turned in his direction. A queen struck down a pawn on the chessboard in the corner, unseen by the players. Suddenly, the room was deathly quiet, ignited for a moment by a flash of lightning and the fearsome vibrato that rolled across the room, altogether too close. Suddenly so dangerous.
“Good.” Harry said with an air of finality, getting to his feet again and wandering over to the kitchen. “What kind of tea would you like before bed?” He asked, turning to catch Draco stuffing the little talisman he had given him into the left breast pocket of his pyjama top.
No. He didn’t think he could even speak to Beatrice about this. He was going to have to use his coping skills on his own. The training wheels were off.
“Oh, well. I know you said you didn’t want to exchange gifts, but I thought I’d make you marshmallows for cocoa tonight.” He smiled back at Draco who felt his stomach flip and he couldn’t stop the smile spreading on his face.
"Even if that were true, your chasers won't have time to win. Jones'll catch the snitch within an hour, I guarantee it."
She stared at him for a long moment, seeming like she was really considering it, but then she shook her head. "Sorry."
"We visit the most likely candidate."
"Not necessarily. We still have loads of people to check."
They were an almost perfect description of Rita Skeeter since her renown had been trashed and he told her so. Harry almost continued on about the last time he'd seen Rita, when she'd been crying on the ministry's steps to anyone who'd listen, when Ron came in carrying Hugo.
It was a new one—usually, they were more grounded in reality—and he made a note to himself to write Andromeda about seeing his godson again soon.
They apparated to the Hog's Head where glamours were definitely allowed and Malfoy ordered some type of wine Harry had never heard of but was apparently the only drinkable thing on the menu. After a few minutes he stepped outside to take a smoke and the barman approached Harry.
He looked almost offended. "Right, sure. When I was on an undercover mission to kill the headmaster, that was me being honest."
"You agreed to help."
"Yep. Head filing-assistant, thrilling."
He heard Ginny sink to the floor in defeat, and then Ron's voice, muffled through the walls, asking, "You really put your mouth on his—" Harry could imagine the accompanying facial expressions and gestures to get his point across.
He still wasn't capable of calling Malfoy by his first name, did he really think a relationship would work?
Malfoy handed him a book called 'Formal Ettiquite Explained for Young Wizards (aged 6-10).'
"Was it paperweight guy? It was, wasn't it?"
"I'd have been happy. I would have." Malfoy stared out the window. "And besides, you're one to talk."
Malfoy blinked a couple of times, shifting in his seat. "Just, well, if your Weasley's weren't okay with my being here, I mean."
"Well considering that you're supposed to be a Ministry professional—"
Obviously, they knew each other. Malfoy looked back and forth from him to Harry.
When they took their seats, Harry somehow ended up next to Malfoy. He still felt uncomfortably close to the eye-fucking tournament going on just a short bit of space away, so after lots of eyebrow-wiggling from Ginny that he was pretty sure was supposed to convey how funny she thought the whole situation was, Harry decided to scoot further down the stands, if only because seeing Ginny in such good spirits had become something of a rarity.
"I wasn't asking if you were, I was just asking if he accepted you for yourself."
d) Achieve Fame
Harry wasn't sure what had happened to them after the war. He knew Lucius had been put on trial for his crimes, but he hadn't paid any attention to the outcome. He felt almost guilty for it, now, because he wasn't sure how lightly to tread.
"Why are you here, then?"
Ron laughed and opened his mouth widely to taunt him.
"We can talk tomorrow."
"I thought that was lovely," Luna said.
He repackaged it and handed it to Malfoy who added it to his pile. It was still strange to look at the man in front of him but his expression was pure Malfoy.
"Paying the bill?"
"Stop that. We're both er... drinking lager."
"You could call Goyle."
Harry groaned. "I don't want people applying just to meet me. What if they're more crazies or they want to tell the Prophet how long
d) The Falmouth Falcons
"I know basically nothing about your life, Malfoy, and I went to school with you for 7 years, give or take a year. Your childhood may be common knowledge but I haven't talked to you more than is polite since the war and you bloody well know it."
Harry nodded, still not able to make words come.
"Ah, that's," Malfoy coughed awkwardly, "well that's quite unfortunate."
"Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Eagles..." he turned away. "These are all muggle."
Harry hadn't forgotten that the person sitting in front of him might be the killer. "Malfoy's important to me. I don't know why."
"We've been trying to find out who killed your husband."
The person he sat down in front of next was a witch with a crooked nose and a shirt that read 'Muggle-born and proud.' She looked to be at least five years younger than him and she smelled like a chimney.
“You all have to stop crying—” Draco huffed a watery laugh. “We haven’t even started yet—” They all chuckled in response as Draco sniffed loudly and Harry kissed his hand. Hestia turned around away from them with an ironic snort to gather herself, leaning on Neville.
“So, why us, then? Why us, if there were so many other possible candidates?” Harry’s voice had an edge of a plea.
It was a few days later that Harry brought up the subject again, this time while they were sitting at the kitchen table together.
Maybe Malfoy knew death, but he certainly would never understand what Harry was going through. It didn’t matter, Harry realised, as his vision began to fade, he was going to die out here in the cold, anyway.
Harry’s deep, slow breathing indicated that he was fast asleep. Draco studied his soft, relaxed features, breathing in his familiar smell, and feeling the rise and fall of his chest under Draco’s hand. He was finally comfortable with the want he felt. It was okay to want someone this badly. It was okay to have these feelings.
Draco had already denied Harry when he had asked to move in together. He had felt so touched by the thought, by the offer, and felt a sinking guilt to say no. But, Draco needed Harry to figure out who he was and what he wanted on his own first. If they were going to be together out in the real world, Draco couldn’t be the foundations on which Harry built his sobriety. So, in the end, he had said no.
The halls were covered in wreaths and fairy lights. Suits of armour lined the walls and mistletoe hung from the rafters. He stifled a laugh as a group of first years crowded around a suit of armour and tried to teach it an off-brand carol, before catching sight of the approaching adult and fleeing down the hall, shrieking with laughter. He felt an odd sense of joy that they ran from him because he was an adult who could tell them off and not because they knew who he was. Reaching the gargoyle he opened his letter from McGonagall to double check the password before saying, “Malva Pudding” and watching the statue leap aside to reveal a moving spiral staircase.
"Hi everyone." They started clapping again and he definitely blushed this time.
"It's so kind of you to come and speak personally for this event, Mr. Potter."
Neville's head was bobbing in the [green flames], the noise of a pub filling up Grimmauld's sitting room.
He snatched it out of her hands, scanning the page with a frown. "This Says 5 Must-Try Glamours to Spice Up Your Sex Life."
"So what's the plan?" Teddy asked. They had 10 minutes until their Portkey activated and they were all waiting around it to be safe.
"I'm not-"
"Cuppa Joe, 2 p.m. tomorrow," he confirmed. Now that Malfoy had accepted, he couldn't make himself say no. That would be wrong. Worse even, then what he was doing.
"Really?"
"Whoa, no way. You're too drunk for that. You should take a sober up, first." Harry's arms were still around Malfoy's middle and it was starting to get uncomfortable. He let go to where he was just keeping him steady with a hand on his arm.
The music in the shop was suddenly turned up to ear-splitting levels to drown them out, but that didn't temper the rant even slightly.
Ron shrugged and then got a beep on his pager, some of the very little technology St. Mungo's had gotten around to implementing since the war.
"What?"
Three days later, Harry was digging through all of the 'M' files there were and not having any luck. If only he could have asked the filing clerk, but it wasn't legal for him to access cases without express permission from Robards, and after sneaking in under his invisibility cloak, Harry was pretty sure Peter (that was the clerk's name) wouldn't have him on his good side.
"Ron, half the women that applied are Potter-Crazy, a third of them are already married but promise they're willing to leave their husband for me if I'm insistent on non-monogamy, and the rest all fail in one way or another I just can't ignore."
He walked back to his seat and Neville patted him on the back.
The younger kids pointed excitedly as a blue streak emanated from the fourth year girl's wand.
"You don't have any reason. Shaw easily could've done it. Patricia too."
Malfoy nodded as the door shut and then let his face twist into a sneer. "Barmy old man. He was practically gloating over the death of my father."
"I don't know."
"It's no surprise you're struggling to come up with ideas, Harry. Grimmauld's got a Boasting Diskie infestation like I've never seen before. I could have my dad come take a look if you like."
c) Puddlemere United
"Don't start on me about him being a bad influence or-"
"From the Ministry? Here to inspect the shop?"
Ooh, the answer's there
"That was my method of distracting her."
Harry slammed his fist on the counter. Fuck! He'd fucked up.
"You don't feel like a victim," he said after a long moment. Harry sat back in his seat. "I never did anything to you I didn't pay dearly for in the end. I never hurt you so badly you couldn't return the favour. Somehow."
"You work in the Healing department of Mungos now, though. I've seen you there."
Harry thought for a moment. "A list of everyone who was there. The names of the Aurors who didn't investigate the first time. DNA evidence from the crime scene and matches from the person who did it."
"Alright, Harry." She bit her lip, looking down at something he couldn't see, then back up at him. "They're both doing okay, yeah? I just, I feel so guilty being away."
He went into the kitchen and put on the kettle. He'd usually consider it too late for caffeine, but he needed something strong to get through the letter he'd been given that afternoon by a Gringotts Goblin and he'd finished the Firewhiskey after the Ball. The letter was one that Andromeda had written before her memory started to go, given to him in her will, along with a pouch he hadn't yet opened.
"You're trying for that?" Ron asked Harry. "You never... and with Malfoy?" His face brightened a bit at that. "Did you rough him up or something?"
They sat in silence until Harry walked back to his room later and passed out for a few hours. When Teddy woke him up at 4 to ask if he wanted to go exploring with him and Malfoy, Harry agreed. He'd promised Hermione he'd get her a present, after all.
"Now... I guess you're right. Not impossible." Not impossible if he ignored the fact that he wasn't ever going to see Malfoy again.
Luna beamed at Seamus and reached over to squeeze his cheek between two fingers.
"You mentioned tea."
"If you win, suppose it goes the other way around. I buy."
When he got to Ginny's door he knocked twice and waited. A few moments later it creaked open and she poked her head out.
"I..."
He worked off some of his nervous energy doing his Auror exercises, but he couldn't help feeling a bit silly about the whole thing. Was he really going to sign up for training next spring? It had always been the plan that he and Ron would do it together, but he had a feeling that wasn't happening anymore.
They shared a laugh that seemed more like crying and Daphne put her hand on Harry's arm.
Mr. Shaw took him down the stairs to the basement. Harry was pretty sure he could fix a tap after doing it for the Dursley's a few times, but he was still nervous. When they reached the bottom of the stairs, the lights went out. Was it a power failure?
"You should be thanking me, Potter. It's not good manners to steal the tears and snot of your ex-fiancée"
"Hey."
"Yeah, it'd be a weird place to start."
They glided out of the store and to the nearest apparition point while he still felt a little dazed, and the next thing he knew they were standing beside an old-looking blue car and Malfoy was opening the door to the driver's-side seat.
Hours stacked up till it was well past noon, then evening, then heading towards darkness. Lee was narrating over the official announcer, and it was almost more fun to watch Ginny and Malfoy pretend they didn't want to laugh than listen to what he said.
"Right."
"You really would have married Astoria? Even though you didn't love her? That other woman too?"
"I want to feel comfortable," Malfoy said, beating him to it.
"Fuck, Malfoy, all we know about her is that she hated your father, what if she's homophobic? She might not even talk to you. And what if she told the Prophet?"
Harry wanted to do anything in his power to get away from the strange energy around their interaction so he turned to Neville.
"If any of my friends were halfway across the globe."
Her smile grew strained, and she looked over her shoulder. "You're sure you want to see it? You wouldn't rather show Mr— sorry, Draco, around the main store?"
They sat stiffly and made small talk over tea, though Daphne didn't have any, leaving them without DNA. When Harry started thinking there was no good solution, Malfoy surprised him by asking Daphne, "Can I see her?"
b) Only after sex
She shrugged. "Not formally, but yeah."
"You'll be there too?" Harry asked, knowing the question was ridiculous, but still needing confirmation.
"With the plan, Potter, not the room."
My favourite Quidditch team is
They met for coffee the next day, though Hermione insisted on decaf as she was still breastfeeding Hugo. Harry told her the situation, minus the parts regarding the search for Malfoy's father's murderer, since she wouldn't approve of all the illegal and possibly immoral DNA gathering. He pretended that they'd instead bonded over their competitive Quidditch opinions.
It explained why George had left, too. The perfect ending to his career, Harry supposed. Everything exploding, and all of the ideas he and Fred had spent their lives cultivating suddenly gone forever.
They stared at each other, the pub much quieter now than it'd been the whole rest of the evening. It was almost possible to imagine that the people he could hear hooting and hollering outside were his friends, though he was sure they'd gone directly to the apparition point without much stalling.
Malfoy went on to tell him that he'd been able to recognise and label every bit of DNA so they wouldn't need a pensive. It'd all gone according to plan and the best part was, Harry's dancing hadn't been bad enough to attract reporters. They made a plan to meet at the lab the next day.
Ron struggled against Harry as he hit the floor, blanket still wrapped around him like a plaid cocoon.
He went to Robards the next day and told him about Ron's idea. It was apparently the most unethical sentence Harry had ever uttered because Robards told him he needed to go on an unpaid sabbatical and that if by the end of the month he was himself again, he'd consider giving him his job back.
Amber was glad to get her drink back and not shy about asking Harry to dance.
"I see. And you manage it now?"
His hair was ruffled, sticking up off his head even as he tried to force it to rights again, and his ears had pinked up profusely. Malfoy swore, brushing dirt off of his waistcoat and trousers, frowning at his foot.
Malfoy nodded slowly. "You live with Ron and Ginny, right?"
"Unaware," Malfoy continued carefully, clearly considering his career as he spoke, "as to not think to hire a professional? Sure, it's costly, but you don't even know the charms for this kind of thing! And not to mention the modifications to the jinx. You could trigger a repeat explosion! Do you honestly think you can perform the spells with enough accuracy to clean the entire room?"
They didn't make much small talk, though Rosier was quite willing to discuss the war and Harry's role in it. Harry himself tried to veer away from this topic.
"I don't need to clean the entire room," Harry said. "Just enough to find some of their old product ideas. Will you tell me the incantation or not?"
I am most prominently
Harry stopped and Draco looked at his mother without speaking.
Dean reached away from Seamus toward the coffee table, where he fumbled for the cardboard box sitting atop it.
"It was the only thing that made sense!"
"Oh!" Luna's face lit up. "I'll come up with names. Burning storm collector, hmm... Sign of Merlin... Flaming Left Nipple Twister!"
Harry apparated to the ministry on Saturday morning with a pit in his stomach. Today was the day they would test the last of their samples. At best, Harry's instincts would be proved simultaneously wrong and right and the killer would be one of the people they'd found in New York. At worst, it would be his closest friend since he was eleven.
"No, I did. Slytherin. I just don't think we should let house stereotypes control our lives now that we're adults. It's rather silly, isn't it?"
"It's fascinating stuff according to Patricia Gibson. She came right into my office all the way from New York, ranting about death eaters and an imperiused savior trying to steal her DNA. Care to explain?"
-Harry
Ron whistled through his teeth and huffed out a laugh, patting Harry on the back. "Well, I suppose you're freaking out because it was more than a fuck or something? Develop feelings for the ferret, did you?"
"Oh, I almost completely forgot due to the ah," he gestured towards Harry's chest who was starting to get the feeling that Malfoy was, in fact, gay. "I got the job. I had to apply under a fake name and I'm going to be wearing so many glamours I'll look like a regular at the Hog's Head, but I got the job."
d) Apparating
"Maybe, maybe not," said Ron.
"And she... is she sick?"
"Bugger off."
They were allowed up and took the lift. The woman who opened the door looked like she was in her late fifties. Her hair was dyed red and her lipstick matched, but the strangest part about her was the Brooklyn accent. She was friendly and invited them into where she'd set the table.
Harry smiled at him and Malfoy smiled back.
He nodded but then a problem arose.
"Harry?" he heard called from the other room.
"Potter! Get your crup off me."
"Erm, I'm here in place of my good friend Healer Hermione Granger to talk about Depression in War Orphans." He took a breath and looked out into the audience for a familiar face. Lorelai winked at him and he felt himself relax.
"Well, if it isn't the Golden Boy."
"I'm not leaving till you summarize your life story. Please use as much detail as you see fit, though leave out the gross bits."
a) Multiple times per week
Harry sighed. They were closer, that much was certain, but he knew something was missing from all of this. Two somethings, actually.
"As?"
Harry snorted but Hermione dropped her fork on the table.
Negative. Holy Fuck.
And my favourite non-alcoholic drink is
Harry snorted. "Yeah, fair enough." He struggled to think of anything. "We both went to Hogwarts, for one."
"Really?" It didn't look like an heirloom, more like something you'd get for a dollar at the flea market. Maybe he'd been wrong in his guess and the rubies were real.
Malfoy's arms wound around his neck and they moved to the rhythm. He could see Ginny and Oliver dancing now, much less appropriately than he and Malfoy. Beside them, Ron and Hermione were moving to the beat and smiling at each other. Dean and Seamus were dramatically mouthing the lyrics to each other at their table.
Could Harry really do that? Could he know something Draco wanted to know so badly and not tell him? Could he live with never seeing Draco again, never speaking to him, never kissing him?
Now, though, Harry remembered the part that asked him to think about the happiest day of his life. It had been a while since he'd had to conjure a Patronus and it had taken him some thinking. He'd realised that his happiest days had all been spent at Hogwarts and that since he'd graduated, few had measured up. Over the last couple of weeks though, the answer had shifted and his night spent teaching the children while Malfoy mixed drinks stood as one of the most fun of his life. There had been something so freeing about the night that he'd had so much worry over initially, even if he had had to suffer through dancing with a handsy witch twice his age.
When they got up to the rooms, Teddy went inside and slammed the door, leaving him outside with Malfoy.
"Sorry, I really shouldn't. There are too many things I need to take care of."
Hmm, hmm, hmm
"Mmm Saturday," he breathed.
"Getting into trouble already, darling?" she called.
"And how exactly did they do that?"
f) other (please specify)
"Not really. Just wondered." Harry took a sip of his drink and then remembered why he was there. He pulled a letter out of his pocket.
He unzipped Malfoy's trousers in a rush and shoved his hand into his pants. Malfoy's eyes flew open and he squeezed Harry's hips so hard he was sure it would bruise. It didn't matter. Harry stroked his hand along Malfoy's cock and Malfoy's mouth moved, trying to form words and not finding any except for a broken moan.
"I'm not. Is eight tonight okay?"
An arm was still clutched tight around his middle as he struggled to get his bearings, huffing for breath and staring up at the ceiling dazedly. He was directly on top of another rather bony body, their legs tangled together awkwardly.
He realised as he was lying in bed that though he could have done without the weird admission that he didn't dislike Malfoy anymore, he wasn't upset they were continuing with the Murder Misson, as he'd been secretly calling it. Malfoy's Murder Mission, actually. The Ministry was big on alliteration and it was a force of habit at this point. The amount of work he'd end up putting in was irrelevant. He wanted to do this. He wanted to help Malfoy.
• • •
b) Chocolate Frogs
"Shove off, Ron. It doesn't matter, anyway. I totally blew it. He asked if I was attracted to him and I said no."
"What? Why?"
"Well, I—" Harry sputtered. "I don't know. It just doesn't fit with the idea of you I've had since school."
c) Rarely
A security officer held a hand out to stop him from entering.
"They were engaged, betrothed really, and became close after the war."
b) Heros from the war
Hermione's smile fell at Ron's voice, and he shouted back, "Er, just a minute!"
He looked up when he heard the glass in front of him being filled with wine and he offered Malfoy a grateful grimace.
"Whose?"
e) I didn't attend Hogwarts
"I'll need a bit of your magical signature to compare."
Harry blew air out of his mouth slowly, waiting for his brain to resume making concrete thoughts.
Harry rolled his eyes. "You're impossible."
Now he had to fix it, and the rest of his life too.
"That all sounds very impressive. I'm not looking for an apprentice currently, or I'd snatch you right up. I'm happy to put in a good word for you, though. Have you taken your Potions N.E.W.T?"
Now Harry had to think about what would lead to his overall largest number of happiness spikes. For years, he'd been centering his life around the idea that that thing was a person. When he looked at all his friends and saw them happy and in love, he didn't miss the connection. However oblivious Hermione thought he was, it was impossible to miss some things. What if this date with Alicia was his only chance to find someone who wouldn't treat him like a hero because of something he did as a teenager? What if it was his only chance at love? And most worryingly, what if he blew it all over not being able to dance?
Harry swore internally.
"If you aren't here to help, bugger off. I have to learn these moves before the Auror's Ball."
"This is Alicia Baldwin."
"I take it we're both feeling pretty uncomfortable right now," Harry said.
"It says you were spotted together in 'varying states of disarray' standing in the middle of Dia— Hermione."
"I said QUIDDITCH game today!" he bellowed. "Front row seats for Puddlemere United."
"Why would I do that?"
"Shut up."
"Then drop the formalities, Potter. I'm not your boss anymore." Robards gave him one of his rare smiles and Harry returned it tentatively. After all, he'd just been fired.
He collapsed on the couch with Barkley and three blankets. He felt a sudden pang of remorse for leaving Hermione and Ron to take care of him on such short notice, especially considering their two kids. He'd go see them tomorrow and bring their gifts to smooth things over.
"We test both and see which one shows relation to you, and then we know the other is the culprit."
She laughed and blushed and put a hand on his arm. Women tended to do this when he was out in public and he'd gotten used to it. Sometimes it lead to a nice conversation, usually it lead to a broken-hearted witch releasing a Tell-All in The Prophet.
It was a valid point. The War Orphans funding went to supporting independent orphanages all around London and some even as far as Scotland, but the money from this auction was expected to be more than they'd ever had before.
"Ah. I was er.. sorry to hear of your father's passing."
"If we have to. We'll do whatever it takes to figure this out."
He arrived within seconds. The halls of St. Mungos were as stark as always but they felt too bright. He asked a Medi-Witch to point him in the direction of Andromeda's room before spotting it out of the corner of his eye. Well not it, Teddy, rather. Beside him was Malfoy, sitting stoically and not looking up from his hands.
"Hmm." She took a sip of her tea.
Malfoy stood slowly, his face impassive.
Harry sighed loudly and got up, walking to the door and gesturing for Malfoy to follow. There was a lab the Aurors were allowed to use for fieldwork that could identify magical signatures in DNA. It wasn't quite the same as muggle policing, but it worked nearly twice as well. DNA could lie, magical signatures could not.
"What's wrong?"
-Harry J. Potter
When Teddy stumbled blearily into the kitchen the next morning, he and Malfoy sat quietly as Harry made breakfast.
Harry scooted a bit closer. "Isn't it?" He wanted it to be—Merlin but he wanted. And why, so that he and Malfoy were on even ground? What would that give him, with all the history still filling the space between them?
"Time to face the day, mate!" he said, pulling the drawstring and letting light flood into the room.
"Shove off."
Professor Burnes stepped out of his office and shook hands with them all, including Teddy.
I live in
"Brilliant," he murmured, mind racing with possibilities, not feeling nearly as stuck as it had before. "Could I look it over for a sec, though? Make sure it's healthy?"
“I do-” he let out a shaky laugh- “Merlin, I do like you. A lot. It’s just, we can’t.” he repeated, and Harry tilted his head a little, still surprised. Draco had seemed into it, the kissing, he’d been as enthusiastic as Harry had. And then he’d said no, but then he said he liked Harry, and Harry was confused as fuck-
“There’s snow all over your hair,” he said, and Harry smiled.
Draco’s head popped up at Camille’s delighted exclamation, as did everyone else’s. They were at dinner, and sure enough, out the windows Draco could see white flakes floating down from the sky.
“Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder’s Map,” read Draco, taking the parchment from Potter. “Who are-”
“Just because you couldn’t save everyone doesn’t mean you did nothing.” murmured Harry. “You did what you could. Maybe you’ve made some bad decisions, but that’s life. And Dumbledore set up his own death. He and Snape talked, decided Snape would be the one to do it. You didn’t cause his death.”
forward and blushed a little. Harry did have a wonderful smile.
“Stop thinking about it,” said Draco sharply, and Harry looked back at him. “I’m fine. They aren’t that bad. You already apologized.” Harry sighed.
“Picnic?” asks Hermione skeptically, holding Draco’s note. “At night?”
“I’ll come with you.” offered Harry, and the two made their way through the crowd. Harry kept an eye out for either missing Slytherin, but didn’t see anything.
Harry was jittery as he walked down the final hallway, at the end of which lay his dorm room. His and Draco’s dorm room. Merlin, it was going to be ten times harder to keep this secret from Draco, especially because he was such an observant person. There was still a week until the ball, and if he wanted to wait until then...well there was nothing else for it.
They left their school bags in the classroom and went down to the carriages, tramping through the empty hallways.
“Where did you-” Harry cut him off.
“I understand that you’re worried about backlash,” replied Harry soothingly. “Honestly… I am a bit, too. But that isn’t going to scare me into not loving you.” he said quietly, and Draco’s head jerked up in surprise. Harry smiled.
Harry and Ron are seated on either side of Hermione, with Sue Li and Padma Patil nearby. They all watch apprehensively as Daphne tugged Malfoy over to them, and the two awkwardly sat across from Harry.
“Yeah, for the sound equipment and the lights.” replied Simon. “I’m going to go grab drinks for everyone.”
When the sun sinks beyond the horizon Draco reluctantly left the clearing and hiked back up the path to the school for dinner, preparing himself to interact with other people again.
“I don’t want to make your night worse,” she said hesitantly, and Draco braced himself for the worst. “But… Harry just told me he saw you kissing Theo. He’s left, back up to the school.”
The first thing he noticed was that he was glowing. His skin was glowing, and glittery, and his eyes were outlined in gold.
“They promised to do my makeup as well, so this isn’t that bad of a price.” he replied, and Draco shook his head with a grin. Daphne and Camille flounced over to his and sat down on either side of him, while Amelie and Simon joined Harry.
Five minutes later the two of them were out the door and entering the dining hall, where they spotted Camille and Simon sitting with Daphne and headed over to join them.
“Hey,” Harry said with a smile. Hermione, however, had a more serious expression.
“So, why did you want to go to France?” came Potter’s voice.
Harry strode over to Seamus, who Dean is trying to restrain. “What the hell, Seamus? Why are you attacking him? What’s going on?”
“...me too. I like hanging out with…” At Harry’s comment Draco flushes. He likes hanging out with me, yelled the loony part of his brain. Shut the hell up and stop blushing it’s embarrassing, snapped his rational side. So Draco did, sitting up and trying to maintain his composure while eavesdropping.
Draco and Harry walked into the common room. The only people there were the other students who’d returned from Beauxbatons, and they walked past all of them and went up to their dormitory. Longbottom and Thomas were still in classes, and Corner was in the common room talking to the Patil twins, so for the moment they were alone in the dorm.
“Harry!”
“Yeah?” he murmured back. “I didn’t wake you up, did I?”
“Of course. Who doesn’t?”
The girls positively shrieked, and Harry drew back from Draco, laughing, but secretly pleased at the tinge of pink on Draco’s cheeks.
“You’re happy with him?” she asked, tilting her head.
“Thanks.” he replied. They’re both quiet. He wondered if this change in Malfoy is around to stay. He wouldn't mind, it makes him easier to talk to; and the moments of vulnerability in the other boy remind Harry that he’s not the only person with scars, visible and not. Thinking on this takes his mind off of his nightmare, and eventually he rolled over and succumbed to sleep once more.
Harry sat up and began to unpack, setting his school things on his desk before entertaining himself with small charms as he waited for Draco to finish his shower.
“There you are!” Daphne waved him over to their table in the dining hall, and Draco hastened to sit down next to her, and across from Harry. “Harry said you went Christmas shopping today? What did you get for everyone?” she prodded, and Draco smirked. It wasn’t hard to tell she wanted to know what he’d gotten for her.
Harry stared after Draco as he strolled over to Daphne. The two Slytherins walked off, and Harry caught one last glimpse of Draco’s smile before they disappeared around a corner.
Harry felt very protective of him at the current moment, though he knew Draco would balk if he told him. But when Draco was in his arms, he just felt so precious, so amazing, and Harry wanted to keep him there as long as humanly possible.
“W-What?” he replied, all too aware of the quaver in his voice. Like...a date? What is this? Is this what they were hiding?
“Draco!” she exclaimed. “I dropped in this morning but you weren’t awake yet.”
“Get up, you two! Help me beat these three!” shouted Daphne, her hands cupped around her mouth, eyes sparkling. Draco looked beyond her to see the three Beauxbatons students behind one of the snow covered hedges, throwing snowballs at a zigzagging Daphne.
“And I didn’t want anyone else dead. I guess I knew you were the best bet at… at a better world. And I was too scared for my mother, my father to break away on my own.” he finished quietly. Harry glanced at Hermione and Ron and their surprised expression match his own.
“We’ll definitely write you,” added Simon, exchanging a sad, fond look with Daphne. Harry felt a pang of sympathy for them; assuming they were staying together, it would be difficult to have a relationship over that distance.
“You started it,” said Harry casually, leaning against a fountain, with his arms crossed, a satisfied smile on his face. “I told you Gryffindor’s always win.” Draco glared at him, not letting an inch of his plan show in his expression, before striding up and pushing Harry onto the snow.
“Why?”
“I think I should do this myself.” explained Draco. He’d arrived at this conclusion only a moment before. Harry nodded knowledgeably. “Can I take this?” Draco held up the Marauder’s Map. Harry eyed him.
“True. I’m only shopping for one Slytherin.” Harry teased, his green eyes sparkling. Draco pouted.
and Harry had sheepishly apologized. But now they were back to their normal.
“...Hope you had a good Thanksgiving, Draco and Harry.” Draco set down the letter that he’d been penning to Hermione and Ron, on Harry’s insistence that Draco’s handwriting was better than his. Harry nodded slowly.
He jogged up the staircase and knocked on the door of the Headmistress’s office. He still thought of it as Dumbledore’s. When a brisk “Come in,” sounds, he pushed open the door and saw McGonagall seated behind an ornate wooden desk. Harry is struck for a second at how almost nothing’s changed. Dumbledore’s random contraptions still lie around, and a consistent low whirring fills the room. Fawkes’s post still stood near the desk, and the portraits still cover the walls. Harry sees Phineas Nigellus, with a haughty expression, and then Dumbledore, who smiled tenderly at Harry, who’s eyes felt dangerously close to tears.
“What was that?” asked Harry innocently, fingers stroking over Draco’s skin slowly.
“If you call me that one more time I will turn you into a snake, you cretin.” Potter laughed and Draco scowled.
“It worked,” Draco said, a slight tone of wonder in his voice. Hermione nodded, looking between Draco and Harry, who didn’t take their eyes off of each other.
Twenty minutes later, when Ron and Draco were having an enthusiastic bickering match over Quidditch, while trying to also do Ron’s homework (it was very amusing) Hermione came over and sat beside Harry.
“Nothing,” protested the blond.
“We’ll be back,” he said with a quick smile, before he and Draco turned round and walked out of the ballroom. Draco visibly deflated once they were in a quiet hallway.
“Oh nevermind, I found them.” came Draco’s voice, and a few seconds later he trod out of the bathroom, green slippers on his feet. Harry laughed. “Shut up, Potty.” Draco scowled as he passed by Harry, who breathed in the smell of sweet mint.
“I need the lacewing flies.” he demanded, and Harry handed him the jar, which he snatched. “Grind the dragon eggshell. Fine powder.” he commanded, and with a slightly amused look Harry obliged.
“Is this about Nott?” prodded Harry. Draco laughed, a low, husky sound.
But he couldn’t do anything about it, only to wait. So here Harry sat, trying his hardest to take legible and useful notes, although he knew his were not up to standard with Malfoy’s. The Slytherin’s notes, like Hermione’s, were always neat and extensively knowledgeable.
“Hi.” said Harry, grinning. “Missed me?” Draco huffed but kissed him again. Harry pulled him closer, his head getting wonderfully light and dizzy, his focus solely on the boy in front of him. Draco pulled away after what seemed like an eternity. A perfect way to spend an eternity, thought Harry dizzily, his head spinning from exhilaration.
“No shit. I wrote two freaking pages, I’m not sending it off as well.” Draco commented, catching the pillow Harry chucked at him and tucking it behind his head.
said, shrugging.
She was all right, Luna, thought Draco. He’d used to share Pansy’s opinion of her, that she was an oddity, but she was the kindest person Draco had ever known, and he found her talk of magical creatures interesting, and calming, in a way. Soon Luna finished her store of meat, and she and Draco walked back up to the school.
Theo stepped up to him, bracing an arm beside Draco’s head on the wall. There was a slight noise in the hallway, like the scuff of someone’s shoe.
“He’s always been like this,” he commented, jerking his head at Malfoy, who’s gesturing wildly with his hands while he talks. “Too smart for the rest of us to keep up.” Harry’s a
“You could say that,” replied Draco wryly. “Did your potion turn out alright?”
“An exchange trip? With Beauxbatons?” Granger asked. Draco could almost
“What?” he asked innocently, and Draco’s hand tightened on his.
Draco huffed as he remembers the conversation he and Daphne had shared before Potions class earlier in the week. “Daphne, we’ve already talked about this. I don’t want her in
“I never met him, but I had a lot to do with his Sorcerer’s Stone.” responded Harry with amusement. “Why?”
“Especially,” she had pointed out, “since his father is no longer influencing him. If you think about it, he grew up only hearing that Muggles were scum. So of course when he gets to Hogwarts, he’s going to think that. But now that he has the chance to see different perspectives, different influences, maybe he’s decided that he disagrees with his parents. I’m not condoning what he’s done over the years, but there is a reason behind why he was the way he was.” Harry had thought on her words before he’d gone to sleep, and decided she was right. How had he not thought of this before?
Nott smirked. “All good things, I hope.” he drawled. He caught Harry’s eye. “Hey, Potter.”
“Oi, Potter! Hurry up!” called Malfoy, and Harry realized he’s stopped walking and was rooted to the path. He hastened to make his way down to the others. It’s dark out, the sun had set just before they’d left the castle. The air is pleasantly cool, and Harry can hear the croaking and chirping of hidden animals.
“Harry. Can you get the door?” Daphne blew strands of her blond hair out of her face as she held her wand aloft.
It’s been a few days since Potter invited Draco to the library, and one week before Draco and Potter leave for France. The three of them have been spending time together, and gradually become
“Or you could just ask,” he grumbled as he swung his legs off of the bed. “Are all Gryffindors this rude?” Harry just laughed and sauntered off to the bathroom. “Damn,” Draco muttered. “You would’ve been a decent Slytherin.”
“Er. Sorry.” Harry says into the awkward silence, backing up slowly. Malfoy has also backed up, his arms coming to wrap around his middle defensively. He looked thin. His mouth was drawn in a thin line.
“Hey, Harry. How are you?” said Dean Thomas as he came out of their dorm. Harry grinned.
Draco suddenly saw the rest of the Hogwarts students, clustered together before a large fountain, which had a small plaque on it, unreadable from his distance. He walked slowly to the group, still trying to take in everything around him.
“Your homework is a foot on the properties of dragon claw and it’s uses,” announced the professor, and with a wave of her hand she dismissed them. Harry grabs his things and leaves, walking back up to the eighth year common room.
“Who, me? Never. I have more class than that.”
“Bold of you, Daphne. Considering you two,” Draco shot back, nodding at Daphne and Simon, who were sitting close to each other, hands brushing. They blushed, and Draco looked over at Harry with a triumphant smile. Harry snorted.
“Alright,” said Harry vaguely. “Nice and quiet.”
“At some point. Not at this second, though.”
Camille leaned over Draco to talk to Harry. “We have the best chefs in the country here. It’s quite a treat. Here, try this.” She handed Harry a little tart of some sort, filled with what looked like apples. He obliged and bit into it, nodding as he chewed.
“What are you thinking about?” murmured Draco, his hands looped over Harry’s neck.
“So tell me, Harry,” declared Camille, swinging her legs back and forth. “Is Draco as clingy as we figured?” Draco’s mouth dropped in outrage and he heard Harry chuckled above him.
He was drunk, and he never got drunk. But he’d been so fucked up over Harry, and then he’d seen Amelie and Harry together… and his mood had dropped even further. So he’d
Thirty minutes later they were sprawled on Harry’s bed, writing a letter to Weasley and Hermione. Draco was on his stomach, Harry was sitting up with his legs tucked underneath him.
“I like the sketches.” he says, feeling slightly ashamed to have prodded so much. But Malfoy doesn’t seem to mind.
Harry glanced over his shoulder at the Ravenclaw boy, expecting to find him already gone, but instead he was filled with alarm as he saw the boy with a clenched jaw, his wand aimed at Draco and his hand already moving to cast a curse.
“I’m right here, Potter.” Draco said scathingly, and Potter shot him a look that said quite plainly, Sorry but I need you to shut up right now. Draco rolled his eyes but complied, silently cursing Potter as he did. Why couldn’t he ever say no to this boy? Oh, right. Because he’s bloody attractive and his eyes take your breath away, Draco sung inside his head, before squashing the thought. No, that’s not a good thing, he said in his mind. Bad thing. Very bad thing. With some effort, Draco pulled himself back to the present and is able to catch some snippets of conversation from where Weasley, Potter, and Hermione are sequestered at the other side of the common room, furiously whispering.
“Alright,” Potter said amicably, and grabbed the mortar and pestle.
No one spoke up, so McGonagall nodded and produced a large bowl of Floo powder.
“It’s a little dark for a Seeker’s game,” said Harry when he reaches the others on the Quidditch Pitch.
As he walked towards the Aurors over the damp grass, he felt the mask slide down. With his mother, he’s just Draco. Not a Death Eater, not hated, just a boy. With everyone else, he’s Draco Malfoy. The bully, the traitor. It had to be this way, for he knew the vulnerable side of him would be shredded if it was revealed. His father had taught him that.
“I thought you liked me. Liked me back,” said Harry, getting off of Draco. His lips were still tingling. Draco looked at him imploringly.
“Blast,” muttered Draco, closing the book with an audible slam. Maybe he could just go to Harry and make him agree to not celebrate Valentine’s Day. Draco wrinkled his nose. It was a horrid holiday, really. Too much pink and frilliness and glitter and squealing. He had a sudden and vivid memory of Valentine’s Day in his second year, when Lockhart had decorated (Draco only used that word for lack of a worse one) the Great Hall, and sent those absurd little dwarves or gnomes around with singing Valentine’s. Draco smirked suddenly.
“Alright. Ooo, nice job Daphne.” Camille said with admiration as she rejoined them. She powdered Draco’s face a bit more, before stepping back with a satisfied noise. “Done.”
The Transfiguration class was relatively similar to the Hogwarts one; they were still working on human transfiguration, but Harry perked up with interest when the teacher mentioned Animagus’s.
“I asked him the same thing on the way back. He just said something like, I don’t hate Malfoy, I just dislike him, but I wasn’t just going to not help him when he needed it.”
“I’ll tell you if you tell me why you were out here with a broken ankle.”
After dessert was cleared away, McGonagall rose from her seat again and made her way to the podium.
“Doubt it,” Ron scoffed. “Slytherins don’t change their colors.”
“Yeah, you were.” agreed Draco, and Harry snorted. “Oh Merlin, here we go,” moaned Draco as they spotted Daphne rushing towards them, her eyes locked on their clasped hands. Harry felt Draco’s head fall onto his shoulder again. “Where’s the Invisibility Cloak when you need it?” Draco asked plaintively, and Harry sniggered.
“I couldn’t think of anything to get Draco for Christmas,” Harry began, leaning against the wall. “But I was thinking of doing like, something else. Instead of buying him something, I mean. Do you think he would like it if we went, like, star-gazing? There’s supposed to be a meteor shower the night of the ball,” said Harry, well aware that he was babbling but unable to stop it. Daphne gave him a knowing, searching look.
When they entered the soft circle of grass, Draco cast hanging lights around, and Harry smiled.
Harry forced a smile. “I don’t do autographs. Sorry.”
“There’s a map that I have. Long story, but basically it shows all of Hogwarts and has everyone’s names, and where they are.” Malfoy blinked.
“I’ll see you later, I have to talk to Daphne about something,” he lied, again, and left Harry’s side abruptly, not letting himself look back. He jogged up to Daphne and fell into step with her. “Hey.”
“But why is he-”
“Different.” finished Draco, finally reaching her side. She nodded and pulled out a strip of meat to feed the thestral, which ate it greedily and nosed Luna’s hand for more. “I came to apologize. I’m so sorry that you were locked up, and had to go through all of that. And I’m terribly sorry I couldn’t help you more during that time.” Draco said seriously, and Luna smiled at him again.
“I’m not blind, Draco, I can see enough.”
So Draco took the easy way out lest his thoughts come out his mouth and offend someone, and stepped into the nearest carriage without saying a word and shut the door behind him. He felt the wheels turn and the thestrals pulling his carriage began up the path towards Hogwarts.
“Ron’s got us a compartment on the train. Want to join him?”
“Fine,” said Harry huffily, and Draco had a split second’s warning before Harry was kissing him. Draco’s lips parted, more out of shock than anything, but Harry took the opportunity to slip his tongue into Draco’s mouth, his hands cupping Draco’s face. When they drew apart at last, panting, Draco was surprised to see that his hands had somehow found their way to Harry’s arms without him noticing. He flushed, and Harry grinned.
“Oh, you’re serious? What do you want with her? She’s loony.”
Harry and Daphne turned to leave, Daphne a bit reluctantly. As they walked down the empty stone halls, footsteps echoing, Daphne spoke.
“That’s not a bad thing,” commented Harry, but he sat back and watched Draco, his green eyes following his every motion.
Daphne nodded. “Good,” she said. “And yes, I think he’d like the star-gazing. Merlin knows he’s not especially looking forward to this ball, anyways. You didn’t hear any of this from me.” Harry smiled weakly, his head still spinning with new realizations.
Twenty minutes later they were talking about tattoos, Daphne having spotted Harry’s on his shoulder, like Draco had done all those weeks ago.
“So how is it at Hogwarts? Is it very different from our school?”
“Well, now I know whenever I want you to do something for me I can just take your blanket and you’ll do it.” Draco huffed, but inwardly he knew that statement was probably true.
“Oh yeah, how was your class today, Professor Potter?” Draco smirked, propping his head on one arm as he looked at Harry.
“Bloody bug crawled over my hand. It had so many legs.” Draco shuddered comically and Harry laughed.
“Oh- sorry. Spaced out.” Daphne had an amused expression on her face. “You can go first?” Harry offered.
“Ron,” chided Hermione. “We’re friends now.” Some part of Draco is pleased with that statement; to hear Hermione say out loud that they were friends. The red head’s eyes widen and again Draco has to repress the urge to snort. He looked so comical it’s hard not to.
“Wow, that’s quite a tale. My first year was definitely not that exciting.” she remarked, as the little group reached the end of a hallway and stopped walking.
When he got to the place on the path where the thestral-drawn carriages parked, he saw two empty ones left and shook the mud off of his shoes in preparation. He walked to the other side of the carriages to where the doors of the carriages were and stopped abruptly. Because of course Potter and Weasley and Granger would have to be there. Bloody wonderful.
“Do you want to go somewhere?” he asked, and Draco blinked in surprise, unable to look away from Harry. He looked amazing tonight.
“Nothing much,” lied Harry, finally glancing over at the other girl and finding her studying him with a curious expression. “You?” Harry knocked his shoes against the step of the main doors to the school as they entered, the warmth wrapping around him like a blanket.
“Not my fault?” he repeated scathingly. “Of course it’s my fault. If I wasn’t with him he wouldn’t have been hurt. It was me that boy was aiming for.”
His mother sighed and levitated his school trunk, making her way down the drafty entrance hall of their manor. Draco trailed along behind her, casting a disdainful eye upon the neglected surroundings. With just himself and his mother and no house-elf, only the parts of the home that they lived in were kept in their former glory. The rest of the manor, like this hall, was dusty and dimly lit.
“I don’t really know what I’m doing either,” he said. Damn! There he went again, slipping up and talking about how he feels. His parents would be utterly disappointed if they knew the events of the past day or two.
Draco conjured a knife and grasped it. His hand is shaking, trembling. The silver of the blade seemed to grow larger, until everything else blurred and Draco’s staring at the knife in his palm, taking short, shallow breaths. Do it, you coward. It would be better for everyone if your dark stain was gone from the world. A tear seeped from Draco’s eye, trailing down his cheek. His heartbeat pounded in his ears, a frantic thumping. His eyes are squeezed shut, and over and over in his mind he saw Dumbledore’s body falling off of the tower, the pained faces of those he was forced to torture, Crabbe’s terrified mask as he was consumed by the flames-
“What’s going on?” Ron came up behind Harry. “Seamus, did you curse Malfoy?” he said incredulously, looking from Seamus to Malfoy slumped against the wall.
Ginger Newt.
“Hi.” replied Draco, nodding at the two of them. “I’m Draco, and this is Harry.”
“Set him down here.” She pulled out her wand as Daphne gingerly lowered him onto a bed. “What happened to the boy?”
“What’s on your mind?” asked Daphne conversationally, and Harry smiled wryly, his gaze snagging on Draco walking ahead of them, chatting with Simon in rapid French, the words indistinct but filled with smooth sounds.
“And then I set Filch on you? Yeah. I remember being mad that you somehow evaded being caught. You did that a lot, evading blame.” replied Draco. Harry glanced over at him
It had been more than Draco could’ve ever dreamed of, and yesterday morning, the day after, he’d woken up half thinking it had all been a very vivid dream, but then he’d realized it was indeed his reality when Harry had kissed him good morning.
Harry had not realized how much he’d missed this. Sitting in this small compartment with his two best friends, all of the things that crowded his mind are forgotten for a while, and it’s like he’s eleven years old again, fresh-faced and eager for the future.
“All I remember is seeing you, Weasley, and the Patil twins sitting on the sidelines the whole damn time.” commented Draco airily. “Didn’t some Durmstrang boy steal your date eventually?”
“Honestly, I forgot about that,” Harry said, leaning on the armrest. “I haven’t really thought about it. But I don’t think I want to be an Auror anymore- I’ve had enough of that life.”
“Your past doesn’t define you. You are more than your mistakes,” Harry said fiercely. “You are a good person, I know you are. You don’t deserve to be punished.” He was searching Draco’s face, looking for some shred of information.
“You’re doing fine, love.” he replied, and Draco felt his cheeks heat. Harry looked a little embarrassed for a second, but seemed to recover his confidence.
“Oh,” said Harry. “Er. No reason. I’ll be right back,” he added, and went to put it in his dorm. When he stashed it beside his bed and changed out of his Quidditch robes, Draco’s bed was silent, the hangings pulled around it entirely. Harry went back to the common room and rejoined Hermione.
The three boys watch Malfoy and Hermione go back and forth. Both of them are talking fast and seem to be enjoying it; Hermione and Malfoy have a gleam in their eyes that Harry associated with Hermione’s manic studying before end of year tests.
“A bit,” he replied. “But I’m glad for him. He seems more easily comfortable here.” Daphne nodded her agreement and they walked in silence for a little while.
“How’d it go?” asked Hermione. She had enchanted a pair of knitting needles, which were clacking busily in front of her, making something that looked- like a blob.
Hermione got up to go speak to the Healers; Draco heard their soft murmurings of conversation on the other side of the room. She’d been looking through obscure healing books, and had picked Draco’s brain on all the spells he knew, to see if any could be used or combined to be used. So far, nothing had shown itself.
Harry’s body was warm underneath of him, and every bit of Draco’s body was pressed into his. Draco could feel Harry’s heartbeat, thudding irregularly alongside his own. Could feel the rise and fall of his breathing, a steady metronome. Harry’s eyes were like a fire, Draco decided dazedly. Ever so many shades of the same color, and mesmerizing enough you could watch them for hours and never be bored of them.
“But this is the best chance we have, right?” said Draco quietly. Hermione nodded.
Harry nodded again, slowly, pondering this new information. So Draco had seen Fawkes, on that day he wouldn’t talk about, and had seen his happiest memories… Harry had never heard of that about a phoenix, but then again, they were powerful magical creatures.
“You aren’t dicing it properly, Potter.” protested Malfoy, sounding more like his old self. “You’re making it too big.”
“Luna said you talked to her. Brought her salve and food.” Ron spoke up suddenly, and Malfoy looked at him.
“I don’t care what people think, Draco. You said you didn’t either.” Harry said calmly as they walked through an empty hallway and began ascending one of the moving staircases. It began to shift and they paused until it was stationary again.
“I know right! She executed it so well.” Draco grinned, and Weasley smiled a little. Draco saw Hermione and Harry behind Weasley exchanging an amused look.
“You’re still fetching the ingredients for me, Potter. We need crushed unicorn horn. And please don’t drop it.” Draco said, but unlike their previous classes, his voice has no bite to it.
like friends. Draco was surprised at how easy it was for him to enjoy their company, and at how easily they accepted him.
Draco murmured agreement, and McGonagall dismissed him. He walked out of her office in a daze, and didn’t bother going to go grab his school bag. Instead he discreetly leaves the castle and wandered the grounds again, eventually finding himself at the same clearing as before. It’s bright and warmed from the sunlight that poured into the clearing, and he stumbled before sitting down.
“They expelled the Ravenclaw boy. And the Healers say that they’re getting close to a counter-curse.” said Daphne, laying her hand on Draco’s shoulder in a useless gesture of comfort. Draco felt numb. He didn’t respond to her words. “It’s not your fault, Draco.” Daphne whispered, and Draco turned around sharply.
Buckbeak tilted his head and cawed, one of his keen eyes fixed on Harry, who bowed without blinking. After a moment the hippogriff bowed back, sinking onto one leg, and Harry moved forward to stroke his beak.
“I think we should stop for today.” said Harry, peering at him with obvious concern. Draco cleared his head of it's jumble of thoughts, drew himself up and stood.
“Same.” repeated Harry. “He’s still Malfoy, but… in a better way. I hope it lasts.”
“Not yet.” Malfoy sniffed and turns back around. Harry pulled up a chair and sat at the table.
“Yeah, me too.” he said. Suddenly Draco groaned.
“Last night you were using me as a pillow, then told me to go get you a blanket, then wouldn’t let me go get you one because I would’ve had to leave you for a second.” pointed out Harry, and the girls cackled. Draco flushed.
“Draco, wake up, don’t you want to open presents?”
“What?” Harry replied curiously.
“No, I’m fine,” he replied noncommittally, walking over to his bed and doing his best not to stare at Draco as the blond returned to his book.
“Who told you that?”
“Sorry,” came Harry’s voice from the bathroom. “I had to wake you up and I forgot to close it.”
“Well, I still dislike him.” Harry amended, and Daphne laughed.
Draco smiled at the other boy in the mirror. “You see? It’s not bad.” he said casually, like butterflies weren’t battering his ribcage.
“I can borrow Blaise’s broom, though.” mused Draco, picking at his food. Harry perked up a little. Ron leaned forward to speak.
“Why the fuck is the window open, Potter?” Draco asked indignantly, his words a little sleep-slurred. Harry sauntered out of the bathroom, a toothbrush in hand.
A flash of gold. Over by one of the goalposts. Draco locked his gaze on it and lay horizontal on his broom as he flew towards it, watching the Snitch flit this way and that as he approached. He could hear the rushing sound of Harry flying behind him, catching up fast. Draco clutched his broom tightly and shot forward, then went vertical, following the Snitch into the sky.
“You don’t understand,” he said, and Harry grabbed Draco’s hand, gently, and the other boy turned startled eyes up to meet his.
Two hours later they went outside, having finished their goodbyes.
little surprised at Blaise’s nonchalant tone; he’s never heard him talk without a sneer or contempt in his voice.
“Hello,” Hermione said to Andromeda, pushing back her hair. Teddy babbled and his hair began to change to the tawny brown color of Hermione’s, who smiled when she noticed.
“Oh. Me too.” Draco wanted to knock his head on the table. This is worse than bickering, worse than being nice. This is just horrendous. Even the knowledge that Potter will be at Beauxbatons with him isn’t enough to distract him from the awkwardness that practically coats both of them.
“You are not your past, Draco. You are not a bad person. You may have done bad things, made bad decisions, but that does not make you a bad person. You deserve a life as much as I do.” said Harry firmly, and it felt like he was gazing into Draco’s soul.
“I should’ve Apparated right onto the train,” he said to Hermione wryly.
“Sod off.” Potter chucked a chess piece at him, and Draco, with the skill of a Seeker, caught it deftly and threw it back. The other boy caught it as well, and they toss it back and forth.
“It’ll be weird having other people in our dorm again,” said Harry, sighing as he dumped spellbooks into his trunk. Draco resisted the urge to make him pack neatly, instead of just throwing everything in.
“Don’t act like you weren’t about to come over here anyway,” teased Harry, nuzzling Draco’s neck.
Draco let the tear slip down his face, restraining the urge to rub at it and be angry with himself for crying. He’s tried that already. So he let himself sob quietly, bathed in the soft morning light.
Daphne turned to Draco. “You go first?” she offered, and Draco nodded.
“Well obviously.” stated Draco with a roll of his eyes. “It’s snowing.” Harry snickered, then burst out laughing as Draco felt someone tackle him from the side and send him flying onto the snowy, cold ground.
“Draco, how may I help you? You said earlier that you had a question for me?” His professor sat behind a desk, and Draco sat across from him.
Draco finally decided to revisit his more recent memories, deciding they were his happiest. Because he’d been with friends, real friends, not cronies or people he barely tolerated.
“You-you-” spluttered Draco, and Harry chuckled, the vibration rumbling through Draco’s body. “Tosser.” Draco finally muttered, before looking up and meeting Harry’s eyes.
“Well, the next time you decide to disappear please leave a note.” replied Daphne indignantly, finally letting go of him. Draco gave her a small nod, still wondering over the fact that she had cared enough to notice his absence. The two walk up the aisle to the eighth year table and sat across from the other two Slytherins.
Then Hermione let out a little “Oh!” and Ron’s eyes went to her. Harry could tell she knew, now. She was smiling as she watched them, and Harry decided this was a good a time as any to clue Ron in.
“I never said it was a bad thing. I like your eloquent-ness.” Harry said, smirking, then turned to put his shoes on.
someone.” Harry nodded.
“Alright.”
Draco moved smoothly through the air, his eyes scanning over the dusky Quidditch Pitch as he looped wide, lazy circles around the pitch. Harry was doing the same thing opposite him, the both of them retracing the same paths over and over. It was nice to be up in the air again, feeling the wind on his face, and being away from all the people.
“Hey,” he replied haltingly. Thomas had never been overly friendly with him, and vice versa. Just politeness, really. Never friends.
“Draco. Draco!”
“Mint sprigs. I add them to everything I brew, because the only effects it can have on any potion is to make it taste good or to counterbalance the side effects. For instance,” continued Draco, nodding at the potion Harry held, “no steam will come out of your ears.”
Harry hesitates before resting a hand on the chair opposite Malfoy at the small table, the slight noise making the other boy raise his head. Harry blinks.
“Well, you still should have told me earlier. Don’t lie, we both know you know how to make a letter tamper-proof.” she chided. Draco sighed.
“Yeah. She wants me to come visit. And apparently she spent Christmas with her sister and the baby.” Draco said, and Harry smiled in reminisce.
“Oh, good, you got him to come out.” greeted Daphne when they reached the bank of the frozen lake on the grounds. Draco peered at the ice covering the lake.
Harry’s hand was pressed to his chest, feeling his heartbeat. And Draco’s. It was so odd. But comforting at the same time. And that Draco had done this for him, agreed to this forever connection, made Harry feel honored, touched.
Camille asked Draco something in French with a mischievous grin, and Draco smirked before replying, also in French. Amelie snickered, and they all glanced at Harry. Talking in French again, looking at him, it wasn’t hard to guess what they were talking about.
“Thanks,” he said, downing the contents and shaking his head a little as the potion began to take effect. “How’d you make it taste good? The ones from the infirmary at Hogwarts always taste gross.”
“I’ll be right back,” said Harry loudly over the music, tapping Amelie on the shoulder. She nodded at him, and handed him his jacket. He grinned in thanks and wove his way
“Sorry.” Draco said quietly.
“So Potter says you like Quidditch?” Draco began conversationally as he nudged a pawn forward.
“Draco, tell us the interesting stuff,” Pansy insisted, buffing her nails. Draco rolled his eyes and prepared to drop his bomb on them. “The other interesting stuff,” Pansy amended, obviously having forgotten and then remembered about Theo.
“Yeah.” replied Harry. “He already told me not to tell Hermione.”
Harry sighed. “Sure, ‘Mione.” he said, and resigned himself to a study session with Hermione, which he and Ron had actively avoided for the better part of three years. Hermione had a tendency to be very nit-picky when studying, and would insist on them quizzing her but keep snatching the book back, among other things.
over to join them.
“I’m honored you told me,” she said softly, and patted his arm before letting go of his hand. Draco smiled again and tugged a strand of her hair.
“Sorry,” he replied, but Harry shook his head.
Potter fell to the side with a grunt and they both struggle to sit up. Draco’s eyes are drawn to the other boy almost instinctively, against his will, looking at pink lips and tan skin and those damn green eyes. No, no, no, thought Draco frantically. He cannot find Potter attractive. He hated him, for Merlin’s sake! He hated everything about Potter, from his black hair to his chiseled nose and oh god this needed to stop.
Draco and Daphne walk the familiar path through the corridors to the Potions classroom after eating lunch with Blaise and Pansy.
“Sorry,” whispered Harry immediately in Draco’s ear. Draco looked up at him and Harry was relieved to see there was no anger or panic in his eyes. Harry still felt shitty about it, though. He knew how long it had taken Draco to open up to him, about anything.
Draco smirked. “Alright.” he said, opening the door and stepping inside. “Potter, you left the window open all day?” he continued indignantly.
“I can’t believe we’ve been here for a month and a half,” he said.
“But I can tell.” he said, picking up his Firebolt. “Come on. Let’s go back to the school.”
“Thanks, Madam Pomfrey.”
“Y-yeah. Right.” said Draco faintly. “I don’t feel good.”
“Do it, then.” he said. “I’ll link with him.”
“I’m not leaving.”
Harry and Draco sat in silence for a while, Draco staring at his covered arm, Harry watching Draco.
“We could have a Seeker’s game,” cajoled Harry, knowing that if the bribe of competition and winning something didn’t draw Malfoy out, nothing will. A glint appears in Malfoy’s
“Food,” replied Ron, nodding to the tray brought by Madam Pomfrey.
“It’s amazing,” Harry breathed. The tattoo was captivating, and he almost wanted to run a finger down it to ensure it wasn’t real fire. Draco smiled self-consciously.
disgust as he passed them. When they pulled apart Harry had to press his lips together to keep from laughing, and Draco had a smug, satisfied look on his face.
Harry decided that he’d just try his best to be a supportive, comforting friend. Just be there for Draco, like Hermione and Ron were there for Harry.
They had then walked back to their dorm, after going to Camille’s room to borrow her eagle owl to deliver the note.
“Yeah.”
Harry wondered if Draco liked him, too. Was that what he and Daphne were keeping from him? He wasn’t sure. It would make a certain amount of sense, what with the Pepper-Up incident, or the random french whispers.
They trotted up the steps to the front doors and Harry saw with a small pang of relief that they were still open, but certainly not for much longer. The two boys walked through, and began up the stairs to the eighth year dorms.
But Draco couldn’t help it. It was like ever since he’d talked in the library yesterday, he kept messing up and admitting things that he, for the better part of seven years, had kept buried within. Even a simple “I don’t know.” He’d always thought that saying things like that or showing your true feelings would leave you vulnerable, and others would only use it to exploit you. But that wasn’t what was happening right now. Maybe his father had been wrong about this, too.
“Headmistress?”
“Alright. I’m finishing up an essay.” he replied. “How was the school thing?”
“Me either,” piped Harry. Not that he would know what to wear to a club.
“Hey.” he said.
But Malfoy hadn’t seemed....hostile. Not unfriendly. If anything he’d found Harry amusing. Or rather, Harry’s flushing and stammering and awkwardness had been laughable to him. Harry groaned and closed his eyes briefly. He was so bad at these things.
“Didn’t you faint then, too?” prodded Draco, still sniggering. Harry gave him a look and sighed deeply.
Harry shrugged and the officer didn't care enough to push further. He got inside and suddenly wondered if he'd come to the right place.
"Everyone beats the canons, I don't know why you're so determined to hate PU."
"All my bloody life, you prick."
"You're sure you'd want to get back at them if you knew who did it? After the war, I felt like that all the time, but letting go was just... easier."
"Okay and now the two bits of DNA."
He flipped open the file and found the tab 'Mysterious Deaths,' and then, 'Malfoy, Lucius.'
Draco shook his head. He was probably just overreacting. It’s not like anything had happened for the past few months that Draco had liked Harry, so why would that change now?
“Not really, no.” he admitted. Obviously when he’d been lost in his head they’d gone around and shared or something. Draco caught his eye and tipped his head toward the entrance, mouthing
Some time later Hermione and Ron joined him again. The three of them had stayed with Harry for the first few hours, but then the other two had left to get food and sleep. They’d been bringing Draco food whenever they came back to the hospital wing-which was often- but he ignored the offered sustenance.
“There’s this thing called skincare, Harry. And you’ve seen all my hair products, don’t get surprised now.” Draco retorted with a smirk. Harry sighed and walked into the bathroom, debating whether he should use some of Draco’s shampoo to piss him off or not.
“What about all the chocolate on your plate?” pointed out Hermione, with raised eyebrows.
“Mm. I can tell. You have that philosophical look on your face again.” said Harry, grinning slightly as he padded over to where Draco was standing out the window, throwing his arms around Draco’s waist and hugging him from behind. Draco twisted in his arms and kissed him briefly, enjoying the smell of vanilla that was enveloped around him. Harry’s smell.
As the other eight Hogwarts students queued up in front of the fireplace (which Harry was not looking at, just to stay calm) Draco leaned closer to Harry.
“Finally up, are we?” teased Draco. “You’re cute when you sleep. Even though you snore.” Harry blinked, before smiling indulgently.
“He likes me back?” he asked, a little desperately. His stress and shock at Daphne knowing that he liked Draco was wiped away, and in its place was the shock and hope of this new fact. Daphne simply nodded, her eyes scrutinizing him. Draco likes me back. Harry turned the words over in his head, those four words that shook him to his core.
“Potter,” sniffed Pansy, eyeing him like she thought he was going to throw something at her, “What have we done to earn the privilege of your presence, exactly?”
Draco strolled down to the student Potion’s room, which was one thing at Beauxbatons he liked that was not at Hogwarts. It was a large room, completely stocked with ingredients and textbooks, specifically for students to practice brewing. No one else was there at the moment, as it was a Friday morning on a day with no classes and everyone else was probably in bed or eating breakfast. Draco began collecting ingredients for a Pepper-Up potion, something he knew by heart as it was so simple, and was quick and easy to brew.
“Hey,” Draco said hesitantly.
Now they were in Potions class, taking notes on Everlasting Elixirs. It was quiet, except for Professor Athme’s steady voice and the scribbling of many quills.
“Nott,” replied Harry with a nod. They’d never been on speaking terms, but Harry wasn’t opposed to it, especially now that it looked like Nott was around for the night.
“..said that we have to meet with our Head of House about our careers when we leave Hogwarts.”
Draco smirked, the banter making him feel like his old self for once. “I’ll be sure to call the best cleaners before I go,” he drawled. “Wouldn’t want to inconvenience you.” Daphne snorted.
“You’re the godfather of my cousin’s kid?” Draco asked with surprise.
“Alright,” Harry replied vaguely. He saw Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini sitting in a corner, talking with Daphne Greengrass. Suddenly, he was struck by an idea. It might actually yield something, whether help in finding whoever attacked Draco or advice on taking to Draco about his self-deprecation. Or it would get Draco mad at him. Either one. “I’ll be right back,” he told Hermione, and before he could hesitate he went over to the Slytherins.
“You are cute. You’re shorter than me.” replied Harry, fingering the ends of Draco’s braid. His hair was very soft. Draco was right, it was a bit messy, but better than his last attempt.
“This is not fun- FUCK- Potter,” said Draco, cursing when his foot slipped and he fell onto the ice, a cold chill seeping through his clothes. He stood up slowly, wincing at the cold and his banged knees.
“Y-your hands are cold,” stuttered Draco breathlessly. Harry’s body pressed him down into the ground, and Harry grinned at him lazily.
“Dunno.” Harry says. Now that it was April, the eighth years were abuzz with plans and chatter on what they would do after they graduated. “I used to want to be an Auror. But not anymore. You?”
“Blimey,” whispered Ron, “I’ve never seen anyone debate with Hermione like this.” Harry nodded agreement, and Blaise overheard them.
“Aurea Anthos.” The portrait swung open and Harry stepped inside and went over to a table where Hermione’s scribbling busily away on a long roll of parchment, two books propped open across from her. Harry sat down. “Hey, Hermione.”
“Headmistress,” interjected Dean. “Are we still allowed to use the Quidditch Pitch? For our own flying?”
“Seriously?” Draco said indignantly. “That bloody chicken slashed my arm open, you know!”
“Get off!” Draco sputtered, and shoved him. His stomach was fluttering, and his face was flushed, and this was fucking ridiculous-
“I’m sorry,” said Harry suddenly. “I don’t mean to stare. Just- Draco, what happened?”
“Oh Merlin,” muttered Harry, and Draco snickered. “That was horrible.”
“Because I know you want to be a better person, and I know you can be a better person. This is the first step on that path. Pansy told me why you leave on days like yesterday-”
“Seamus, you can’t go around attacking people!” exclaimed Harry. When Seamus looked up at him defiantly, Harry threw up his hands and walked over to where Malfoy lay against the wall, Daphne kneeling next to him. Malfoy’s obviously unconscious; his eyes are closed, and Harry saw red staining Malfoy’s blond hair and with a jolt, remembered the fight in the bathroom in sixth year. There was blood in his hair then, too.
“You look cute when you sleep, too. And I don’t snore. You do, though.”
The other boy blinked at him with green eyes through those awful glasses like he was just as confused. For the second time that night, Draco didn’t know what to do. He stood there awkwardly, debating walking away a second time.
“Come walk the grounds with me,” she said in reply, but it was less of an offer and more of a command. Her tone was unreadable. Harry did so, walking next to her as they stepped outside. He shivered slightly as the cold night air washed over him, a small knot of anxiety twisting in his stomach. What was she on about?
“We need to take him to Madam Pomfrey,” said Harry quietly to Daphne. Her hands are balled into fists.
Harry nodded and they went their separate ways, Harry continuing down to the dining hall while Draco ascended the many staircases to his professor’s office.
“Fuck off,” he said sleepily, rolling back over and tucking the extra pillow under his head, but Harry’s voice sounded from behind him.
But he let himself succumb to the thoughts of him anyway.
“Merlin, Pansy. And no. I haven’t talked to him since… well, sixth year.”
Draco let Weasley win; it’s not too hard, as Weasley’s as good as him at Wizard’s chess. After that Weasley is significantly friendlier to Draco, and the four of them sat in the common room, talking about classes and Quidditch until people start trickling back in before dinner.
“Harry,” said Draco, appearing out of the bathroom. “Give me back my stuff. I need it.”
Harry snorted and Hermione rolled her eyes with a smile, Ron’s comment having diffused the tension a bit.
“Brilliant,” Harry said, and left the dorm room. Draco sighed into the empty space, shaking his head before changing out of his pajamas and into robes and brushing his teeth.
"The one standing between second and third base," Teddy said.
He scoffed—that was the understatement of the century.
Zabini barked a short laugh, eyes shining. "Hardly. I'm your solicitor."
Harry grabbed his collar and pulled him back until Malfoy could sit up and scowl at him.
when your whole world is black
"After losing Jeter they don't stand a chance!" Teddy told Malfoy.
"Emotionally, you prat."
"It's Ginny, actually," Ginny said at the same time that Ron said, "Everyone calls me Ron."
"Oi, you're the one who invited me."
He didn't feel even a sliver of guilt as he smashed the glass. A reparo would fix it right up and Patricia hadn't gotten on his good side anyway.
Finally, Hermione broke it. "What do we do now?"
"Maybe just try getting your mind off it for a while. Some of our best ideas come to us when we aren't trying to think of them."
His voice had taken on a hint of the jealous tone Harry knew so well from their Hogwarts days, and he sighed.
Daphne scowled but she clearly knew who Malfoy was talking about.
b) As soon as possible
Harry went to Hermione for advice on his date with Alicia now that he and Ron were fighting-not-fighting. Hermione and Ron would be there since they were both still considered major celebrities and Hermione wanted a night off from the kids.
c) Punch
There was a small chance that the killer was Protheus Longbottom and in that case, all the samples would test negative and no one would get hurt. Harry wasn't one to believe in small chances anymore.
'No colours anymore, I want them to turn black,' Harry responded.
"Not hungry."
Zabini stepped forward elegantly, commanding the room's attention. "My client was the original financier of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes and, as such, he maintains the authority to make any and all legal choices concerning its foreclosure under the 1896 Wizards for Welfare Act. It is the nature of such a business that, in the event of both former co-owners are no longer being alive, a decline of patronage, profit, and reputation is expected. Mr Potter cannot be held at fault for this eventuality, nor should he be prohibited from exercising his right to reestablish a plan for growth. Business turnover from one owner to the next is never without its trials. That is all, Your Worship, thank you."
"I didn't have sex with him!"
"If I may offer you a word of advice, Draco's mother was always so concerned with how everyone felt about her. If Draco's anything like her, he feels that pressure too. She waited, though, until she found someone she loved enough to commit to. She wasn't the type to settle down just because she was betrothed to someone. Lucky it worked out for her."
"If I could find them, I would. I would look them in the eye and know that they killed my father. Then I'd take it from there."
"Right, yeah. Being the one who goes around and tells people that their livelihood, their family business, their passion project has to close down was the dream right from the womb." He didn't take his eyes off the road, clearing his throat. "No, Potter, I didn't want to be a fucking inspector. It was the only job that was hiring and I needed the money. Still pays well, and no one else wants to take it, so I'm set."
Me and Ali nod our heads as we got our wands out. Mother smiled as we apparated to the train station.When we got there, I started to get some looks from some wizards and from the first year muggle-born muggle relatives. Usually, the muggle teenagers and some older Hogwarts students give me,what my sister calls, 'The Look' Or, when they start looking me up and down and liking their lips
I stand there, zoning out wondering what McGonagall could possibly want from me this early in the year. Did I do something wrong? Maybe she got a time-turner and witnessed me and my friends doing something stupid, so she called me here to stop me and Ron from being 'Babbling bumbling band of baboons.' Maybe-
Pansy bolted off me and glared daggers at both boys. "MY WHAT!" She shouted at said boys. They both began to talk about the weather and so-on as I still laid on the ground
~~~~~~At zeh Castle~~~~~
"Haha very funny! How do you even know who Pablo Picasso is? He is a muggle painter" I looked up at him questionably, finishing up the drawing. Malfoy just raises his eyebrow and states bluntly "He was a wizard, not a muggle. Have you been listening to anything in our Histories of Magic class?" I feel my face heat up in embarrassment as I roll my eyes.
"Anyway, take a seat Potter. Like I said before, we have important matters to discuss." I nodded and sat down on one of the chairs in front of her desk. "Recently, a student has reached out to me and shared their concerns for the new school year. She was scared that the occupants of the other houses were going to...act out... so to speak, and hurt some of the Slytherins. I wholeheartedly agreed with the young woman, which is why I am asking you, as not only the chosen one, but a brave gryffindor."
"Dra-*hiccup*-co! Where are you my little slut!" Father yelled as he walked inside of the manor. This is the fifth time he's gotten drunk this week. Mother was out at diagon alley and would be back in a few hours, so she wasn't there to help me.
Disclaimer; I do NOT own Harry Potter, so I am NOT J.K Rowling ( or else the books would be about drarry and not about Harry fighting Voldemort)
Hello my lovely dragons
"No reason Dray" Alex smiled at me "And I'm fine, I knew you guys would be fine with it." She looked at the gryffindors when she said 'it'
Minerva McGonagall
There will be ABUSE,RAPE, AND OTHER TRIGGERING SUBJECTS, SO READ AT YOUR OWN RISK! I also need to remind you that I do not own anything in this fanfic other than Alex and other characters I chose to add, and I also am tErRiBLe at writing... so I apologize.enjoy!
When he opened the door, he saw a girl about his age, with platinum blonde hair, light blue-grey like eyes, she was also wearing a white sweater with a very detailed dragon on it, and blue skinny jeans. She reminded Harry of someone, but he couldn't figure out who.
"GET THE FUCK OFF HIM!" A familiar voice shouted as a ball of red light flashed behind me. Suddenly, Dustin went limp and fell to the floor. I slide down to the floor, bringing my knees to my chest and burying my face in my hands. The people in the bathroom were talking, but I blocked them out. It took me a moment to realize that I was having a panic attack. The cuts on my wrist were getting agitated and itchy so I started scratching and clawing at them.
Draco's POV
"Did you not hear me?" My father asked, I could tell he was getting angry so I spoke up. "S-sorry Father" I said as I took off my clothes, sobbing in the process. "P-Please don't do t-this f-father" I begged, but he just smirked and pressed his body on mine. His hand grabbed my-
There were already multiple cuts on my arms, a few on my thighs, and one or two on my sides. I started doing this to myself ever since I got my Hogwarts letter. Yup, you heard it right here, I suffer from depression, anxiety, anorexia (Eating disorder) and I am addicted to muggle drugs and drinking. I remember the day all the depression started...
"Mister Potter?" Obviously, my brilliant mind responded with, "Hmm?" Looking up I see Headmistress McGonagall staring at me with an amused look. "I asked if you could come inside. We have important matters to discuss." She answered, turning on her heel. "What? Yes. Matters are all important to discuss." I blurt out walking behind her and into her office.
"Thank you.." I look up at Draco and just stare at him. I've never noticed how pretty Malfoy's eyes are, or how soft his hair looks. I wonder how soft it actually is I reached my hand up and-
(Draco's POV)
Pansy, Blaise, Theo, Alex and I sat at the right end of the table. Pansy and Alex were sitting by my left side, and we had our backs to the professors. Blaise was sitting across from me, and Theo sat on Blaise's left side.
Alex came only a few minutes before the Hogwarts express came to a stop. They had arrived at Hogwarts. We all got up and retrieved our bags, when we ran into the golden trio. Well, technically the weasel ran into me.
"Guys, I don't think we should do this'' The hufflepuff boy stuttered. The girl glared at him, "Shut up Austin! Stop being a pussy, the slimy death eater deserves it." she hissed. I focused my attention back on the guy pinning me to the wall. He looked me up and down, licking his lips.
The first two times, I was in first year. I tried to hang myself twice, but Pansy Parkinson and Alex just so happened to be sneaking into the prefects bathroom and found me before I let go of the chair that was underneath me. The second time, Theodore Nott found me in the slytherin common room, again, I was hanging myself. Then two more times in second year, once in third, twice in fifth year, and three times in sixth.
As soon as my friends and I walked into the Great Hall, I could feel multiple pairs of eyes watching my every move. I looked down and suddenly found the cracks in the floor mesmerizing. Everyone stayed by the doors as McGonagall spoke. "Welcome back to another year at Hogwarts, School of Witchcraft And Wizardry. As you know, we had to have the school rebuilt after-"
"Ally! There you are! The gang and I were looking for you every where!" The boy came into veiw, he was wearing a green hood,black beanie and black ripped jeans. Then...it hit Harry like a load of bricks. Draco Malfoy... Alex looks like Malfoy! "You can't just get up and leave right after you tell use that you are tr... Why are you with them?" Draco asked looking at the four students sitting in the compartment "No reason Dray" She smiled at him "And I'm fine, I knew you guys would be fine with it." She looked at us when she said 'it'
No ones POV
"DRAY! DRACO MALFOY, I MIGHT BE A WOMAN BUT I WILL NOT HESITATE TO WALK MY FINE ASS IN THERE IF YOU DON'T COME OUT HERE!" A shrill voice shrieked causing the both of us to jump away from each other. "COMING PANSY!!" Draco yelled back as he tried to fix his sleeves. When he finished, he looked back up to me and nodded a goodbye. We both stood up and walked outside the bathroom. There was a long line of the 8th years who seemed to be waiting for something or someone.
I would like to see you as soon as you get into school.
"Oi, watch where you're going next time ferret!" The weasel barked. I then muttered "Not my fault, you bumped me.." Which seemed to make him furious! As we continued to walk, I felt someone grab my arm and pulled me back. "Merde, pas maintenant. Lâche-moi fouine" (Shit, not now. Let me go weasel) I winced at the pressure Weasly was applying on my fresh cuts I made this morning, which only made Weasel's grip tighten around my wrist.  I noticed Pansy turn around and she got Theo's, Blaise's and Alex's attention  and tried to push Weasly away from me.
My eyes go wide, as I realize what he is going to do. I started struggling against him. I hear him chuckle and the sound of a zipper open.
In a desperate need to change the subject I ask, "Do you know who's name you want me to write down?" We both look down at his arm for a few seconds before Draco responds with a quiet "My mother, Narcissa. I want her name down" I smile gently at him and nod, writing down her name as neatly as possible.
Please stay safe and try not to go onto social media on June 1st💖💖
Please tell me what you think about the story so far, I would love to hear your opinions! Sorry for any spelling/grammar errors. I hopefully will get another chapter in by Friday, because of school and homework.
"Well, when your done with.." I waved my hand at them "..this, get back to the compartment, we want to talk to you about how we are going to celebrate...you now." I said turning around "Ok see you later Dray, love you" Alex said smiling "Love you too" I mumbled as I walked away from the compartment.
The welcome back fest was going great, and I actually felt happy for once. Well...before I eventually left so that I could purge the little food I did eat in the bathroom....
'Blood' that is the only thing I think as I dragged a small razor against my wrists. Well, that and the fact that I was invited to go back to Hogwarts for an 8th year. At first, I burned the letter and acted like I never got it, but then more letters came. But then, my mother saw the letters and she begged me to go, so that I would be away from my father.
I AM ALIVE!!! unfortunately haha.... Anyway, I'm sorry for not updating I'm shit I know. As y'all should know I am not 'She-who-must-not-be-named' therefor, I do not own any of these characters except for Alex and my other OC's that I am going to add. This story is on Ao3, and fanfiction.net if you are wondering. And I also have a few things on my tumblr (deefuckingsays) for this story and another story I am planing on working on.
"Oi, watch where you're going next time ferret!" Ron barked. Malfoy muttered something about Ron bumping into him. That made Ron furious! Ron grabbed Malfoy's arm and pulled him back. Malfoy winced, but that only made Ron's grip tighten around Malfoy's wrist. Malfoys friend (Pansy Parkinson, Theodore Nott, Blaise Zabini and Alex) noticed this and and tried to push Ron away from him.
Harry snapped back to reality as the Hogwarts express came to a stop. They had arrived at Hogwarts. As the four got up and retrived their bags they ran into, none other than, Draco Malfoy himself.
'Blood?' I thought to myself...
"RONALD!" She scowled. Alex gave him a sad smile and said, "Draco has been through a lot.. more than you could ever imagine. You guys should try to get along." With that she left. Hermione looked at Harry and Ron. "She is right you know. We should talk to Mal-Draco and get along better." she said "I ran into Pansy while in Dragon Alley. She is really nice when you get to know her." Hermione said looking at Ginny, then blushing slightly. (Should Pansmione be a thing or not?)
"Snape!? But! I-you! You died!" I yelled. Snape just rolled his eyes, and before he could respond McGonagall did it for him. "Not even death can get him out of this friendship Mister Potter." 'Friendship?' I thought. "Yes Potter, unfortunately I am alive. Minerva just wont let me get rest, no matter here or in the underworld. I already gave you your 15 galleons from our last bet, let me rest after my dramatic death oh my god." Snape added bluntly, though, I'm sure the last part was meant for McGonagall not me.
"ALRIGHT STUDENTS! MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE!" McGonagall called out in her usual loud teacher voice.
We tried to get as far away from the other students as possible, but of course The Gryffindor had a different idea, and sat one set away from us. "Hello Draco" a sing-song voice from my right said. I turned my head around, and saw Luna Love good sitting next to me.
He opened the letter, and read the parchment.
"Are you ok Dragon?" My mother asked. " I'm fine maman, I promise" I said, even though I knew it was a lie. I look at the letter that still lays in my mothers hands. "Whats that for?" I asked my Alex. She looked back at the letter and smiled, "It's a note from Headmistress McGonagall. She sent it to me asking if I could inform all the eighth year students of the new conditions at Hogwarts." She answered, taking it out of my mothers hand. "She only chose me because I sent her an owl a few days ago." She said, answering the question I had yet to ask.
She then said a few more words that I didn't bother listening to. At the end, she instructed use to sit down at our tables, while she sorted the first year.
Present
Have a great school year,
People are also saying that they are going to go out and rape, murder and threaten people who are part of the community.
Father has been beating me ever since I was 3, so even if it isn't new it still hurts. Father walked up the stairs and into my room. I tried to stand up straighter so he doesn't get mad at me. He looked me up and down as he licked his lips. He took a step closer to me, I closed my eyes expecting to get hit. But father didn't hit me, all he did was whisper in my ear "Strip for your daddy" He slurred. I stepped back and looked at him, I just froze 'This can't be happening! I'm to young! He-he wouldn't- he can't, can he?' I thought to myself.
"I can't believe McGonagall (Don't know if I spelled it right) is making us redo 7th year!" the redheaded boy exclaimed. It's been 3 years since the war ended, and McGonagall had fixed up the school and invited the Hogwarts 7th years back. Of course Hermione forced Ron and Harry to go with her to Hogwarts. Harry was lost in thought until he heard Ron yell, " WHAT!!! MALFOY!! THEY CAN'T DO THAT!!"
I looked down to see that my sleeve was rolled up, and you could see old dried scares, along with fresh red ones. Theo stared at me, and I gave him a pleading look. I saw him take his wand out and whisper a quick spell that hid my scares. The gryffindors looked up at me in disbelief. I sneered at them, and said "Did you really think they were real?"
Father looks at me, and I can tell he is mad that I took to long to get ready."Narcissa, take Alex outside and get ready to apparat Draco and yourselves to the platform." Father said curtly. Even though father had gotten out of Azkaban, he was under house arrest for another month. And since he's on house arrest, we are not allowed to use magic inside the house.
From the corner of his eye, Harry could see Pansy Parkinson whisper in something to Draco Malfoy. What ever she said, it made Malfoy Blush a bright crimson color, and hide is face in his hands. Harry didn't realize that he had zoned out until he felt a sudden gush of wind hit his face. He fell on his back, he could fell a cool liquid dripping onto the floor, then a burning sensation above his cheek. He felt like a scoop of ice cream on the sun.
"Well, when your done with.." He waved his hands at them "..this, get back to the compartment, we want to talk to you about how we are going to celebrate...you now." Harry notice that Malfoy looked tiered and had a few scares on his face. He also had a big bruise on his neck.
We stare at each other in silence. 'This is probably what Headmistress McGonagall meant when she said that she was concerned of how the other houses' response to Slytherins after the war' I thought.
Draco Malfoy's sleeve was rolled up, and you could see old dried scares, along with fresh red ones. Draco Lucius Malfoy, Harry Potters crush ever since 1st year, was cutting himself....
******************************
There was blood...
When we're about 10 minutes away from Hogwarts, Ali got up with the note that McGonagall had sent her. "Guys," she started, closing her eyes "I have something to tell you. I-I'mtransgenderanditisdefinitelynotaphasenoraproblem." She said quickly and then ran out of the compartment. We all look at each other, astonished. I had not known she was trans. Yeah, we all knew she was questioning her gender and or sexuality, but...
"You're kidding. You and Malfoy? I refuse to believe you would interact for anything unimportant. What do you even know about his life now."
"That's what you need, Harry. A questionnaire to weed out the people that just want you for your stunningly good looks and fame."
Harry snorted and told him how so-not-the-point that was.
"Thanks."
"How about we do dinner tonight?"
Ginny laughed delightedly at that, leaning across Harry to clap him on the shoulder. Malfoy flinched, looking startled but not displeased.
He should have asked earlier. Malfoy had this sick fantasy of wanting to get back at the killer somehow. They deserved to be locked up, Harry was almost positive, but if it was Ron, could Harry let that happen?
"Nothing."
Malfoy had grown into his features since Harry had last seen him, not looking nearly so pointy and now missing the dark bags he'd had under his eyes since the beginning of sixth year. His hair wasn't slicked back like it used to be, either, instead falling partially into his eyes until he brushed it away with a hand.
They started walking, the air tenser than he knew what to do with, though thankfully it didn't take long for Malfoy to break the silence.
Harry shoved Malfoy who smirked. "Prat. Don't act like you don't understand the parts we've already explained."
Her husband was already seated and he looked to be a few years older, though his hair was a more natural auburn colour and his beard only reached his shoulders.
Harry gestured to the office, knowing it was obvious how far he'd gotten.
"You sound like such a teenager talking to your mum in front of-" Harry cut himself off. "So, how'd you convince her to use muggle technology anyway?"
Once she was gone, Ron followed soon after, and the rest of them were left sprawled out in various positions on the floor and sofa for hours, trying to come up with ideas.
He sat down next to Teddy and brushed a strand of black hair out of his face. He'd have a crick in his neck tomorrow. Harry grabbed a pillow from his room and tucked it under his head.
"Well, you know, no excuse to miss watching Puddlemere get some of their confidence knocked out of them."
First, he needed to officially hire on his friends for their respective jobs. He didn't want to be exploiting them for free labour when he didn't have to. He also made a note to give Verity a pay bump and hire at least one more clerk for somewhere in the store. If everything worked as planned, she would need the help.
"Yes," Harry said immediately.
"You brought Malfoy."
"Not a problem."
c) One only ends when I'm right
"I do not."
"Please."
If I look hard enough into the settin' sun
Quite a few, actually, but Harry hadn't taken the time to look through any yet since he figured finding people who answered correctly was more important.
"There are no other employees who were deemed impartial enough."
"Quidditch game today," Harry replied, then he swept out of the room on his way back to the kitchen. He'd decided to take Malfoy's advice. Today, he wasn't going to think about the shop at all.
"Why didn’t they like him?"
"I must say, Mr. Potter, it certainly is refreshing to see your face out more often these days."
It was nice out, not too cold For January, and at Draco's request, Harry grabbed a bottle of Elderflower wine from the cupboard where Kreacher kept it for them to drink. It considerably lightened the atmosphere.
That's what they'd been doing so far, and there was no reason it shouldn't work. Verity was experienced enough with the day-to-day proceedings that she didn't need his help, and patronage had ground to a halt after the Prophet article announcing that George was gone.
Her lips thinned into a tight line, and she huffed out a breath through her nose. "Well, what are you going to do about it? Force them?"
"It's the principle of it!" Teddy told him, which wasn't really an answer but also kind of was.
"Well, if my initial impression is correct, then that means anything you might want in here is gone now. Completely solid..." Malfoy frowned, looking at the room... "orange."
